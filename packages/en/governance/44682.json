From such efforts, prepared, perhaps, after days of\r\nstudy and repeated revision, one can form but an imperfect idea of their\r\nauthor. Such a compilation might show the highest conceptions of the\r\nman, and evidence a wide range of thought and a surpassing grandeur of\r\nexpression; but it would be but a poor mirror of the man himself in his\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the people that the largest opportunity be given them to\r\nobserve the character of their public servants, to come into closest\r\ntouch with their daily thoughts, and to know them as they are--not when\r\nprepared for special occasions, but day after day and all the time. It\r\nis with this view that this collection of the speeches of President\r\nHarrison is offered to the public. It is a series of instantaneous\r\nphotographs that have caught him unawares. The studied pose is wanting,\r\nbut the pictures are true to life.\r\n\r\nThere are included the letter of acceptance, the inaugural address,\r\nthe letter to the commercial congress, extracts from his last annual\r\nmessage to Congress, his patriotic message on the Chilian affair, and\r\na few carefully prepared speeches, among them his notable addresses at\r\nthe banquet of the Michigan Club, February 22, 1888, and before the\r\nMarquette Club at Chicago, March 20, the same year; also his celebrated\r\nspeech at Galveston, in April last. All these are among the best models\r\nof statesmanlike thought and concise, forcible, and elegant expression.\r\nWith these exceptions, the speeches presented were delivered during the\r\npresidential campaign of 1888, often four or five in a day, to visiting\r\ndelegations of citizens, representing every occupation and interest,\r\nand during his tours of 1890 and 1891, when he often spoke eight or ten\r\ntimes a day from the platform of his car.\r\n\r\nIf these speeches contained no other merit, they would be remarkable\r\nin the fact that, while delivered during the excitement of a political\r\ncampaign and in the hurry of wayside pauses in a journey by railroad,\r\nthey contain not one carelessly spoken word that can detract from\r\ntheir dignity, or, by any possible distortion of language, be turned\r\nagainst their author by his political opponents. With no opportunity\r\nfor elaborately studied phrases, he did not utter a word that could be\r\nsneered at as weak or commonplace. This fact is all the more noteworthy\r\nwhen we recall the dismal failures that have been made by others under\r\nlike circumstances.\r\n\r\nA spirit of exalted patriotism and broad statesmanship is apparent in\r\nevery line; and notwithstanding the malignity of the partisan assaults\r\nthat were made upon him, no words of bitterness--only terms of generous\r\ntolerance--characterize his allusions to his political opponents.\r\n\r\nWith a single notable exception, no thought of sameness or repetition\r\nis ever suggested. That exception was the central thought and vital\r\nprinciple that was at stake in the campaign. One marvels at his\r\nversatility in adapting himself to every occasion, whether he was\r\naddressing a delegation of miners, of comrades in war, or of children\r\nfrom the public schools; we admire the lofty thoughts and the delicious\r\nhumor; but while he might soften in tender, playful greeting of\r\nchildren, or live again with his comrades the old life of tent and\r\nfield, he never for one moment forgot the great principle whose banner\r\nhe had been chosen to uphold. Protection of American industry was\r\nalways his foremost thought--and how well he presented it! What an\r\nexample to the politician who seeks by evasion or silence to avoid the\r\nquestions at issue!\r\n\r\nThe book is therefore presented with the gratifying belief that a\r\nvaluable service has been rendered in collecting these speeches and\r\nputting them in an enduring form, not only because they give the\r\nAmerican people the most lifelike mental portrait of their Chief\r\nMagistrate, but because they are a valuable contribution to American\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nIn order to the best understanding and appreciation of an address, it\r\nis often necessary to know the circumstances in which it was delivered.\r\nEspecially is this true when the address was made, as many of these\r\nwere, to some particular organization or class of citizens or at the\r\ncelebration of some important event. For this reason, as well as for\r\ntheir important historical value, an account is given of the occasion\r\nof each speech, including, as far as they could be learned, the names\r\nof the more distinguished persons who were present and took part in the\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\n                                                                   C. H.\r\n\r\n  WASHINGTON, D. C., February 20, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Harrison, twenty-third President of the United States, was born\r\nTuesday, August 20, 1833, at North Bend, Hamilton County, Ohio. He is\r\nthe second son of the late John Scott and Elizabeth Irwin Harrison.\r\n\r\nHis father--the third son of President William Henry Harrison and Anna\r\nSymmes--was born at Vincennes, Indiana, was twice elected to Congress as\r\na Democrat, from the Cincinnati district, and died in 1878.\r\n\r\nGeneral William Henry Harrison, ninth President of the United\r\nStates, was the third son of a famous signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence--Benjamin Harrison, of Virginia, and his wife Elizabeth\r\nBassett. This Benjamin Harrison, \"the signer,\" was one of the first\r\nseven delegates from Virginia to the Continental Congress. He reported\r\nthe resolution for independence, was Speaker of the House of Burgesses,\r\nand was thrice elected Governor of Virginia, dying in 1791; he was the\r\neldest son of Benjamin and Anna Carter Harrison, both of whom were\r\ndescended from ancestors distinguished for their high character and\r\ntheir services to the colony of Virginia.\r\n\r\nBen Harrison's boyhood was passed upon his father's farm in Ohio. At the\r\nage of 14, with his elder brother Irwin, he attended Farmer's College at\r\nCincinnati, preparatory to entering Miami University at Oxford, Ohio,\r\nfrom which institution he graduated in 1852.\r\n\r\nHe studied law in the office of Judge Belamy Storer at Cincinnati, and\r\nin March, 1854--with his bride, Miss Caroline W. Scott, to whom he\r\nwas wedded October 20, 1853--he located at Indianapolis and began the\r\npractice of the law.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 he was elected reporter of the decisions of the Supreme Court of\r\nIndiana, as a Republican, receiving 9,688 majority.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1862, he was commissioned by Gov. Oliver P. Morton as second\r\nlieutenant, and raised Company A of the Seventieth Indiana Volunteer\r\nInfantry, was commissioned captain, and on the organization of the\r\nregiment was commissioned colonel. In August his regiment entered the\r\nfield and became a part of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the\r\n20th Army Corps, Gen. W. T. Ward, of Kentucky, brigade commander. At\r\nthe battle of Resaca, Sunday, May 15, 1864, the Seventieth Regiment led\r\nthe brigade in a gallant charge, and its colonel signally distinguished\r\nhimself, being among the first to scale the bloody parapet. He actively\r\nparticipated in the engagements at Cassville, New Hope Church, Gilgal\r\nChurch, Kulps Hill, and Kenesaw. Following that great captain in the\r\nAtlanta campaign, initiatory to his famous march to the sea, Colonel\r\nHarrison at the battle of Peach Tree Creek, July 20, 1864, in the crisis\r\nof the fight, without awaiting orders, seized an important position and\r\nsuccessfully resisted, at great loss, the terrific assaults of a large\r\ndetachment of Hood's army. For this brilliant achievement, upon the\r\nrecommendation of Major-General Joe Hooker, he was brevetted in March,\r\n1865, by President Lincoln, a brigadier-general, to date from January\r\n23, 1865.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1864, while at the front, he was re-elected, by 19,713\r\nmajority, reporter of the Supreme Court, which office he had lost by\r\naccepting a commission in the army. After four years as reporter he\r\nresumed his law practice, forming a partnership with Albert G. Porter\r\nand W. P. Fishback. About 1870 Mr. Fishback retired, and the firm became\r\nPorter, Harrison & Hines; upon Governor Porter's retirement W. H. H.\r\nMiller took his place, and in 1883 Mr. Hines retired, and, John B. Elam\r\ncoming in, the firm became Harrison, Miller & Elam.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Hon. Godlove S. Orth was nominated as Republican candidate for\r\nGovernor of Indiana, but pending the canvass he unexpectedly withdrew.\r\nIn this emergency, during General Harrison's absence on a trip to Lake\r\nSuperior, the Central Committee substituted his name at the head of\r\nthe ticket. Undertaking the canvass despite adverse conditions, he was\r\ndefeated by Hon. James D. Williams--\"Blue Jeans\"--by a plurality of\r\n5,084 votes.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 he was chosen chairman of the Republican State Convention.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he was appointed by President Hayes a member of the Mississippi\r\nRiver Commission.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 he was chairman of the delegation from Indiana to the National\r\nConvention, and with his colleagues cast 34 consecutive ballots for\r\nJames G. Blaine in that historic contest.\r\n\r\nPresident Garfield tendered him any position but one in his Cabinet, but\r\nthe high honor was declined.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1881, he was elected United States Senator--the unanimous\r\nchoice of his party--to succeed Joseph E. McDonald, and served six years\r\nto March 3, 1887.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 he again represented his State as delegate at large to the\r\nNational Convention.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1887, he was a second time the unanimous choice of his party\r\nfor United States Senator, but after a protracted and exciting contest\r\nwas defeated on the sixteenth joint ballot, upon party lines, by 2\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nJune 25, 1888, he was nominated at Chicago by the Republican National\r\nConvention for President, on the eighth ballot, receiving 544 votes\r\nagainst 118 for John Sherman, 100 for Russell A. Alger, and 59 for\r\nWalter Q. Gresham. He was chosen President by 233 electoral votes\r\nagainst 168 for Grover Cleveland. The popular vote resulted: 5,536,242\r\n(48.63 per cent.) for the Democratic ticket, 5,440,708 (47.83 per cent.)\r\nfor the Republican ticket, 246,876 (2.16 per cent.) for the Prohibition,\r\n146,836 (1.27 per cent.) for the Union Labor, and 7,777 (0.11 per cent.)\r\nscattering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISON'S SPEECHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETROIT, FEBRUARY 22, 1888.\r\n\r\n_Michigan Club Banquet._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Club, the largest and most influential political\r\norganization in the State, held its third annual banquet at the Detroit\r\nRink on Washington's Birthday, 1888.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the club were: _President_, Clarence A. Black;\r\n_Vice-President_, William H. Elliott; _Secretary_, Fred. E. Farnsworth;\r\n_Treasurer_, Frederick Woolfenden.\r\n\r\nSenator Thomas W. Palmer was president of the evening; the\r\nvice-presidents were: Hons. F. B. Stockbridge, C. G. Luce, J. H.\r\nMacdonald, Austin Blair, H. P. Baldwin, David H. Jerome, R. A. Alger, O.\r\nD. Conger, Chas. D. Long, E. P. Allen, James O'Donnell, J. C. Burrows,\r\nM. S. Brewer, S. M. Cutcheon, Henry W. Seymour, Benj. F. Graves, Isaac\r\nMarston, Edward S. Lacy, John T. Rich, O. L. Spaulding, Geo. W. Webber,\r\nGeo. Willard, E. W. Keightley, R. G. Horr, E. O. Grosvenor, James\r\nBirney, C. E. Ellsworth, D. P. Markey.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished guests and speakers of the evening from other States\r\nwere: General Benjamin Harrison, Ind.; General Joseph R. Hawley, Conn.;\r\nHon. William McKinley, Jr., Ohio; Hon. Joseph G. Cannon, Hon. John F.\r\nFinerty, and General Green B. Raum, Ill.; Hon. L. E. McComas, Md.; and\r\nHon. James P. Foster, N. Y.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison responded to the sentiment, \"Washington, the\r\nrepublican. The guarantee of the Constitution that the State shall have\r\na republican form of government is only executed when the majority in\r\nthe States are allowed to vote and have their ballots counted.\"\r\n\r\nHis speech attracted widespread attention at the time, and is considered\r\none of his greatest. One expression therein--viz.: \"I am a dead\r\nstatesman, but a living and rejuvenated Republican\"--went broadcast over\r\nthe land and became one of the keynotes of the campaign.\r\n\r\nSenator Harrison made the first reference of the evening to the name of\r\n\"Chandler.\" It was talismanic; instantly a great wave of applause swept\r\nover the banquet-hall, and thenceforth the speaker carried his hearers\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThe Senator spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Michigan Club_--I feel that I\r\n  am at some disadvantage here to-night by reason of the fact that I\r\n  did not approach Detroit from the direction of Washington city. I\r\n  am a dead statesman [\"No! No!\"]; but I am a living and rejuvenated\r\n  Republican. I have the pleasure to-night, for the first time in\r\n  my life, of addressing an audience of Michigan Republicans. Your\r\n  invitations in the past have been frequent and urgent, but I have\r\n  always felt that you knew how to do your own work, that we could\r\n  trust the stalwart Republicans of this magnificent State to hold\r\n  this key of the lakes against all comers. I am not here to-night in\r\n  the expectation that I shall be able to help you by any suggestion,\r\n  or even to kindle into greater earnestness that zeal and interest\r\n  in Republican principles which your presence here to-night so well\r\n  attests. I am here rather to be helped myself, to bathe my soul in\r\n  this high atmosphere of patriotism and pure Republicanism [applause]\r\n  by spending a little season in the presence of those who loved and\r\n  honored and followed the Cromwell of the Republican party, Zachariah\r\n  Chandler. [Tremendous applause.]\r\n\r\n  The sentiment which has been assigned me to-night--\"Washington,\r\n  the republican; a free and equal ballot the only guarantee of the\r\n  Nation's security and perpetuity\"--is one that was supported with a\r\n  boldness of utterance, with a defiance that was unexcelled by any\r\n  leader, by Zachariah Chandler always and everywhere. [Applause.] As\r\n  Republicans we are fortunate, as has been suggested, in the fact\r\n  that there is nothing in the history of our party, nothing in the\r\n  principles that we advocate, to make it impossible for us to gather\r\n  and to celebrate the birthday of any American who honored or defended\r\n  his country. [Cheers.] We could even unite with our Democratic friends\r\n  in celebrating the birthday of St. Jackson, because we enter into\r\n  fellowship with him when we read his story of how by proclamation he\r\n  put down nullification in South Carolina. [Applause.] We could meet\r\n  with them to celebrate the birthday of Thomas Jefferson; because there\r\n  is no note in the immortal Declaration or in the Constitution of our\r\n  country that is out of harmony with Republicanism. [Cheers.] But our\r\n  Democratic friends are under limitation. They have a short calendar of\r\n  sense, and they must omit from the history of those whose names are\r\n  on their calendar the best achievements of their lives. I do not know\r\n  what the party is preserved for. Its history reminds me of the boulder\r\n  in the stream of progress, impeding and resisting its onward flow and\r\n  moving only by the force that it resists.\r\n\r\n  I want to read a very brief extract from a most notable paper--one\r\n  that was to-day in the Senate at Washington read from the desk by\r\n  its presiding officer--the \"Farewell Address of Washington;\" and\r\n  while it is true that I cannot quote or find in the writings of\r\n  Washington anything specifically referring to ballot-box fraud, to\r\n  tissue ballots, to intimidation, to forged tally-sheets [cheers],\r\n  for the reason that these things had not come in his day to disturb\r\n  the administration of the Government, yet in the comprehensiveness\r\n  of the words he uttered, like the comprehensive declarations of\r\n  the Holy Book, we may find admonition and guidance, and even with\r\n  reference to a condition of things that his pure mind could have never\r\n  contemplated. Washington said: \"Liberty is indeed little less than a\r\n  name where the Government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises\r\n  of factions, to confine each member of society within the limits\r\n  prescribed by the law, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil\r\n  enjoyment of the rights of persons and property.\" If I had read that\r\n  to a Democratic meeting they would have suspected that it was an\r\n  extract from some Republican speech. [Laughter.] My countrymen, this\r\n  Government is that which I love to think of as my country; for not\r\n  acres, or railroads, or farm products, or bulk meats, or Wall Street,\r\n  or all combined, are the country that I love. It is the institution,\r\n  the form of government, the frame of civil society, for which that\r\n  flag stands, and which we love to-day. [Applause.] It is what Mr.\r\n  Lincoln so tersely, yet so felicitously, described as a government of\r\n  the people, by the people, and for the people; a government of the\r\n  people, because they instituted it--the Constitution reads, \"We,\r\n  the people, have ordained;\" by the people, because it is in all its\r\n  departments administered by them; for the people, because it states as\r\n  its object of supreme attainment the happiness, security and peace of\r\n  the people that dwell under it. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  The bottom principle--sometimes it is called a corner-stone,\r\n  sometimes the foundation of our structure of government--is the\r\n  principle of control by the majority. It is more than the corner-stone\r\n  or foundation. This structure is a monolith, one from foundation\r\n  to apex, and that monolith stands for and is this principle of\r\n  government by majorities, legally ascertained by constitutional\r\n  methods. Everything else about our government is appendage, it is\r\n  ornamentation. This is the monolithic column that was reared by\r\n  Washington and his associates. For this the War of the Revolution\r\n  was fought, for this and its more perfect security the Constitution\r\n  was formed; for this the War of the Rebellion was fought; and when\r\n  this principle perishes the structure which Washington and his\r\n  compatriots reared is dishonored in the dust. The equality of the\r\n  ballot demands that our apportionments in the States for legislative\r\n  and congressional purposes shall be so adjusted that there shall be\r\n  equality in the influence and the power of every elector, so that it\r\n  shall not be true anywhere that one man counts two or one and a half\r\n  and some other man counts only one half.\r\n\r\n  But some one says that is fundamental. All men accept this truth.\r\n  Not quite. My countrymen, we are confronted by this condition of\r\n  things in America to-day; a government by the majority, expressed by\r\n  an equal and a free ballot, is not only threatened, but it has been\r\n  overturned. Why is it to-day that we have legislation threatening\r\n  the industries of this country? Why is it that the paralyzing shadow\r\n  of free trade falls upon the manufactures and upon the homes of our\r\n  laboring classes? It is because the laboring vote in the Southern\r\n  States is suppressed. There would be no question about the security of\r\n  these principles so long established by law, so eloquently set forth\r\n  by my friend from Connecticut, but for the fact that the workingmen\r\n  of the South have been deprived of their influence in choosing\r\n  representatives at Washington.\r\n\r\n  But some timid soul is alarmed at the suggestion. He says we are\r\n  endeavoring to rake over the coals of an extinct strife, to see if\r\n  we may not find some ember in which there is yet sufficient vitality\r\n  to rekindle the strife. Some man says you are actuated by unfriendly\r\n  feelings toward the South, you want to fight the war over again, you\r\n  are flaunting the bloody shirt. My countrymen, those epithets and that\r\n  talk never have any terrors for me. [Applause.] I do not want to\r\n  fight the war over again, and I am sure no Northern soldier--and there\r\n  must be many here of those gallant Michigan regiments, some of which I\r\n  had the pleasure during the war of seeing in action--not one of these\r\n  that wishes to renew that strife or fight the war over again. Not one\r\n  of this great assemblage of Republicans who listen to me to-night\r\n  wishes ill to the South. If it were left to us here to-night the\r\n  streams of her prosperity would be full. We would gladly hear of her\r\n  reviving and stimulated industry. We gladly hear of increasing wealth\r\n  in those States of the South. We wish them to share in the onward and\r\n  upward movement of a great people. It is not a question of the war,\r\n  it is not a question of the States between '61 and '65, at all, that\r\n  I am talking about to-night. It is what they have been since '65. It\r\n  is what they did in '84, when a President was to be chosen for this\r\n  country.\r\n\r\n  Our controversy is not one of the past; it is of the present. It has\r\n  relation to that which will be done next November, when our people\r\n  are again called to choose a President. What is it we ask? Simply\r\n  that the South live up to the terms of the surrender at Appomattox.\r\n  When that great chieftain received the surrender of the army of\r\n  Northern Virginia, when those who had for four years confronted us\r\n  in battle stacked arms in total surrender, the terms were simply\r\n  these: \"You shall go to your homes and shall be there unmolested so\r\n  long as you obey the laws in force where you reside.\" That is the sum\r\n  of our demand. We ask nothing more of the South to-night than that\r\n  they shall cease to use this recovered citizenship which they had\r\n  forfeited by rebellion to oppress and disfranchise those who equally\r\n  with themselves under the Constitution are entitled to vote--that and\r\n  nothing more.\r\n\r\n  I do not need to enter into details. The truth to-day is that the\r\n  colored Republican vote of the South, and with it and by consequence\r\n  the white Republican vote of the South, is deprived of all effective\r\n  influence in the administration of this Government. The additional\r\n  power given by the colored population of the South in the Electoral\r\n  College and in Congress was more than enough to turn the last\r\n  election for President, and more than enough to reverse--yes, largely\r\n  more than reverse--the present Democratic majority of the House of\r\n  Representatives. Have we not the spirit to insist that everywhere\r\n  north and south in this country of ours no man shall be deprived of\r\n  his ballot by reason of his politics? There is not in all this land a\r\n  place where any rebel soldier is subject to any restraint or is denied\r\n  the fullest exercise of the elective franchise. Shall we not insist\r\n  that what is true of those who fought to destroy the country shall be\r\n  true of every man who fought for it, or loved it, like the black man\r\n  of the South did [applause]--that to belong to Abraham Lincoln's party\r\n  shall be respectable and reputable everywhere in America? [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  But this is not simply a Southern question. It has come to be a\r\n  national question, for not only is the Republican vote suppressed\r\n  in the South, but I ask you to turn your eyes to as fair and\r\n  prosperous a territory as ever sat at the door of the Federal Union\r\n  asking admission to the sisterhood of the States. See yonder in the\r\n  northwest Dakota, the child of all these States, with 500,000 loyal,\r\n  intelligent, law-abiding, prosperous American citizens robbed to-day\r\n  of all participation in the affairs of this Nation. The hospitable\r\n  door which has always opened to territories seeking admission\r\n  is insolently closed in her face--and why? Simply because the\r\n  predominating sentiment in the Territory of Dakota is Republican--that\r\n  and nothing more. And that is not all. This question of a free,\r\n  honest ballot has crossed the Ohio River. The overspill of these\r\n  Southern frauds has reached Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, indicating\r\n  to my mind a national conspiracy, having its centre and most potent\r\n  influence in the Southern States, but reaching out into Ohio, Indiana\r\n  and Illinois in its attempt by frauds upon the ballot-box to possess\r\n  the Senate of the United States. Go down to Cincinnati in a recent\r\n  election and look at the election returns, shamelessly, scandalously\r\n  manipulated to return members to the Senate and House of Ohio, in\r\n  order that that grand champion of Republican principles, John Sherman,\r\n  might be defeated. Go yonder with me to Chicago and look into those\r\n  frauds upon the ballot--devised, executed in furtherance of the same\r\n  iniquitous scheme, intended to defeat the re-election of that gallant\r\n  soldier, that fearless defender of Republican principles, John A.\r\n  Logan of Illinois. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  And these people have even invaded Indiana. At the last election\r\n  in my own State, first by gerrymander, they disturbed and utterly\r\n  destroyed the equality of suffrage in that State; it was so framed as\r\n  to give the Democratic party a majority of 50 on joint ballot; and\r\n  Indiana gave a Republican majority on members of the Legislature of\r\n  10,000, and yet they claim to hold the Legislature. And that is not\r\n  all. Then, when gerrymander had failed, they introduced the eraser\r\n  to help it out [laughter]; scratched our tally-sheets, shamelessly\r\n  transferred ballots from Republican to Democratic candidates. How are\r\n  we going to deal with these fellows? What is the remedy? As to the\r\n  Southern aspect of this question, I have first to suggest that it is\r\n  in the power of the free people of the North, those who love the\r\n  Constitution and a free and equal ballot, those who, while claiming\r\n  this high privilege for themselves, will deny it to no other man, to\r\n  welcome a President who shall not come into office, into the enjoyment\r\n  of the usufruct of these crimes, against the ballot [applause]; that\r\n  will be great gain. And then we should aim to place in the Southern\r\n  States, in every office exercising federal authority, men whose local\r\n  influence will be against these frauds, instead of such men as the\r\n  district attorney appointed by Mr. Cleveland, who in this recent\r\n  outrage upon the ballot in Jackson, Miss., was found among the most\r\n  active conspirators, when, by public resolution of a Democratic\r\n  committee, Republicans of that city were warned away from the polls.\r\n  Then again we shall keep ourselves free from all partisanship if\r\n  we lift our voice steadily and constantly in protest against these\r\n  offences.\r\n\r\n  There is vast power in a protest. Public opinion is the most potent\r\n  monarch this world knows to-day. Czars tremble in its presence, and\r\n  we may bring to bear upon this question a public sentiment, by bold\r\n  and fearless denunciation of it, that will do a great deal towards\r\n  correcting it. Why, my countrymen, we meet now and then with these\r\n  Irish-Americans and lift our voices in denunciations of the wrongs\r\n  which England is perpetrating upon Ireland. [Applause.] We do not\r\n  elect any Members of Parliament, but the voice of free America\r\n  protesting against these centuries of wrongs has had a most potent\r\n  influence in creating, stimulating and sustaining the liberal policy\r\n  of William E. Gladstone and his associates. [Great applause.] Cannot\r\n  we do as much for oppressed Americans? Can we not make our appeal to\r\n  these Irish-American citizens who appeal to us in behalf of their\r\n  oppressed fellow-countrymen to rally with us in this crusade against\r\n  election frauds and intimidation in the country that they have made\r\n  their own? [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  There may be legislative remedies in sight when we can once again\r\n  possess both branches of the national Congress and have an executive\r\n  at Washington who has not been created by these crimes against the\r\n  ballot. [Applause.] Whatever they are, we will seek them out and\r\n  put them into force--not in a spirit of enmity against the men who\r\n  fought against us--forgetting the war, but only insisting that now,\r\n  nearly a quarter of a century after it is over, a free ballot shall\r\n  not be denied to Republicans in these States where rebels have been\r\n  rehabilitated with a full citizenship. [Applause.] Every question\r\n  waits the settlement of this. The tariff question would be settled\r\n  already if the 1,000,000 of black laborers in the South had their due\r\n  representation in the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n  And my soldier friends, interested that liberal provisions should\r\n  be made for the care of the disabled soldier--are they willing that\r\n  this question should be settled without the presence in the House of\r\n  Representatives of the power and influence of those faithful black\r\n  men in the South who were always their friends? [Applause.] The\r\n  dependent pension bill would pass over the President's veto if these\r\n  black friends of the Union soldier had their fair representation in\r\n  Congress. [Applause.] It is the dominant question at the foundation\r\n  of our Government, in its dominating influence embracing all others,\r\n  because it involves the question of a free and fair tribunal to\r\n  which every question shall be submitted for arbitrament and final\r\n  determination. Therefore, I would here, as we shall in Indiana, lift\r\n  up our protest against these wrongs which are committed in the name\r\n  of democracy, lift high our demand, and utter it with resolution,\r\n  that it shall no longer be true that anywhere in this country men are\r\n  disfranchised for opinion's sake.\r\n\r\n  I believe there are indications that this power is taking hold of\r\n  the North. Self-respect calls upon us. Does some devotee at the shrine\r\n  of Mammon say it will disturb the public pulse? Do we hear from New\r\n  York and her markets of trade that it is a disturbing question and we\r\n  must not broach it? I beg our friends, and those who thus speak, to\r\n  recollect that there is no peace, that there can be no security for\r\n  commerce, no security for the perpetuation of our Government, except\r\n  by the establishment of justice the country over. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, MARCH 20, 1888.\r\n\r\n_Marquette Club Banquet._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 20, 1888, General Harrison was the honored\r\nguest of the Marquette Club of Chicago--one of the leading social and\r\npolitical organizations of that great city--at their second annual\r\nbanquet, given at the Grand Pacific Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the club for that year were: George V. Lauman,\r\n_President_; William H. Johnson, _First Vice-President_; Hubert D.\r\nCrocker, _Second Vice-President_; Charles U. Gordon, _Secretary_; Will\r\nSheldon Gilbert, _Treasurer_.\r\n\r\nThe Banquet Committee and Committee of Reception for the occasion\r\ncomprised the following prominent members: James S. Moore, Frederick\r\nG. Laird, LeRoy T. Steward, Wm. H. Johnson, James E. Rogers, F. W. C.\r\nHayes, Henry T. Smith, Harry J. Jones, Chas. S. Norton, Irving L. Gould,\r\nT. A. Broadbent, Jas. Rood, Jr., Wm. A. Paulsen, T. M. Garrett, Geo. W.\r\nKeehn, Harry P. Finney, C. B. Niblock, Wm. A. Lamson, S. E. Magill, R.\r\nD. Wardwell, Fred. G. McNally.\r\n\r\nPresident Lauman was toastmaster, and opened the banquet with an address\r\nof welcome to Senator Harrison.\r\n\r\nThe other speakers of the evening were Edward J. Judd, Theodore\r\nBrentano, Hon. Thomas C. MacMillan, Hon. John S. Runnells, Newton Wyeth,\r\nMayor Roche and President Tracy of the State League of Republican Clubs.\r\n\r\nAmid hearty applause General Harrison rose to respond to the toast, \"The\r\nRepublican Party.\" He spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Marquette Club_--I am under\r\n  an obligation that I shall not soon forget in having been permitted\r\n  by your courtesy to sit at your table to-night and to listen to the\r\n  eloquent words which have fallen from the lips of those speakers who\r\n  have preceded me. I count it a privilege to spend an evening with so\r\n  many young Republicans. There seems to be a fitness in the association\r\n  of young men with the Republican party. The Republican party is a\r\n  young party. I have not yet begun to call myself an old man, and yet\r\n  there is no older Republican in the United States than I am. My first\r\n  presidential vote was given for the first presidential candidate of\r\n  the Republican party, and I have supported with enthusiasm every\r\n  successor of Frémont, including that matchless statesman who claimed\r\n  our suffrages in 1884. We cannot match ages with the Democratic party\r\n  any more than that party can match achievements with us. It has lived\r\n  longer, but to less purpose. \"Moss-backed\" cannot be predicated\r\n  of a Republican. Our Democratic friends have a monopoly of that\r\n  distinction, and it is one of the few distinguished monopolies that\r\n  they enjoy; and yet when I hear a Democrat boasting himself of the age\r\n  of his party I feel like reminding him that there are other organized\r\n  evils in the world, older than the Democratic party. \"The Republican\r\n  party,\" the toast which you have assigned to me to-night, seems to\r\n  have a past, a present and a future tense to it. It suggests history,\r\n  and yet history so recent that it is to many here to-night a story of\r\n  current events in which they have been participants. The Republican\r\n  party--the influences which called it together were eclectic in their\r\n  character. The men who formed it and organized it were picked men.\r\n  The first assembly that sounded in its camp was a call to sacrifice,\r\n  and not to spoils. It assembled about an altar to sacrifice, and in a\r\n  temple beset with enemies. It is the only political party organized\r\n  in America that has its \"Book of Martyrs.\" On the bloody fields of\r\n  Kansas, Republicans died for their creed, and since then we have put\r\n  in that book the sacred memory of our immortal leader who has been\r\n  mentioned here to-night--Abraham Lincoln--who died for his faith and\r\n  devotion to the principles of human liberty and constitutional union.\r\n  And there have followed it a great army of men who have died by reason\r\n  of the fact that they adhered to the political creed that we loved. It\r\n  is the only party in this land which in the past has been proscribed\r\n  and persecuted to death for its allegiance to the principles of human\r\n  liberty. After Lincoln had triumphed in that great forum of debate in\r\n  his contest with Douglas, the Republican party carried that debate\r\n  from the hustings to the battle-field and forever established the\r\n  doctrine that human liberty is of natural right and universal. It\r\n  clinched the matchless logic of Webster in his celebrated debate\r\n  against the right of secession by a demonstration of its inability.\r\n\r\n  No party ever entered upon its administration of the affairs of\r\n  this Nation under circumstances so beset with danger and difficulty\r\n  as those which surrounded the Republican party when it took up the\r\n  reins of executive control. In all other political contests those\r\n  who had resisted the victorious party yielded acquiescence at the\r\n  polls, but the Republican party in its success was confronted by\r\n  armed resistance to national authority. The first acts of Republican\r\n  administration were to assemble armies to maintain the authority of\r\n  the Nation throughout the rebellious States. It organized armies,\r\n  it fed them, and it fought them through those years of war with an\r\n  undying and persistent faith that refused to be appalled by any\r\n  dangers or discouraged by any difficulties. In the darkest days of the\r\n  rebellion the Republican party by faith saw Appomattox through the\r\n  smoke of Bull Run, and Raleigh through the mists of Chickamauga; and\r\n  not only did it conduct this great civil war to a victorious end, not\r\n  only did it restore the national authority and set up the flag on all\r\n  those places where it had been overthrown and that flag torn down,\r\n  but it in the act and as an incident in the restoration of national\r\n  authority accomplished that act which, if no other had been recorded\r\n  in its history, would have given it immortality. The emancipation of\r\n  a race, brought about as an incident of war under the proclamation of\r\n  the first Republican President, has forever immortalized the party\r\n  that accomplished it.\r\n\r\n  But not only were these dangers and difficulties and besetments and\r\n  discouragements of this long strife at home, but there was also a call\r\n  for the highest statesmanship in dealing with the foreign affairs\r\n  of the Government during that period of war. England and France not\r\n  only gave to the Confederacy belligerent rights, but threatened to\r\n  extend recognition, and even armed intervention. There was scarcely\r\n  a higher achievement in the long history of brilliant statesmanship\r\n  which stands to the credit of our party than the matchless management\r\n  of our diplomatic relations during the period of our war; dignified,\r\n  yet reserved, masterful, yet patient. Those enemies of republican\r\n  liberty were held at bay until we had accomplished perpetual peace\r\n  at Appomattox. That grasping avarice which has attempted to coin\r\n  commercial advantages out of the distress of other nations which has\r\n  so often characterized English diplomacy naturally made the Government\r\n  of England the ally of the Confederacy, that had prohibited protective\r\n  duties in its constitution, and yet Geneva followed Appomattox. A\r\n  trinity of effort was necessary to that consummation--war, finance\r\n  and diplomacy; Grant, Chase, Seward, and Lincoln over all, and each\r\n  a victor in his own sphere. When 500,000 veterans found themselves\r\n  without any pressing engagement, and Phil Sheridan sauntered down\r\n  towards the borders of Mexico, French evacuation was expedited, and\r\n  when Gen. Grant advised the English Government that our claims for\r\n  the depredations committed by those rebel cruisers that were sent\r\n  out from British ports to prey upon our commerce must be paid, but\r\n  that we were not in a hurry about it--we could wait, but in the mean\r\n  time interest would accumulate--the Geneva arbitration was accepted\r\n  and compensation made for these unfriendly invasions of our rights.\r\n  It became fashionable again at the tables of the English nobility to\r\n  speak of our common ancestry and our common tongue. Then again France\r\n  began to remind us of La Fayette and De Grasse. Five hundred thousand\r\n  veteran troops and an unemployed navy did more for us than a common\r\n  tongue and ancient friendships would do in the time of our distress.\r\n  And we must not forget that it is often easier to assemble armies\r\n  than it is to assemble army revenues. Though no financial secretary\r\n  ever had laid upon him a heavier burden than was placed upon Salmon\r\n  P. Chase to provide the enormous expenditures which the maintenance\r\n  of our army required, this ceaseless, daily, gigantic drain upon the\r\n  National Treasury called for the highest statesmanship.\r\n\r\n  And it was found, and our credit was not only maintained through the\r\n  war, but the debt that was accumulated, which our Democratic friends\r\n  said could never be paid, we at once began to discharge when the army\r\n  was disbanded.\r\n\r\n  And so it is that in this timely effort--consisting first in this\r\n  appeal to the courage and patriotism of the people of this country\r\n  that responded to the call of Lincoln and filled our armies with\r\n  brave men that, under the leadership of Grant and Sherman and Thomas,\r\n  suppressed the rebellion, and under the wise, magnificent system of\r\n  our revenue enabled us to defray our expenses, and under the sagacious\r\n  administration of our State Department held Europe at bay while we\r\n  were attending to the business at home. In these departments of\r\n  administration the Republican party has shown itself conspicuously\r\n  able to deal with the greatest questions that have ever been presented\r\n  to American statesmanship for solution. We must not forget that in\r\n  dealing with these questions we were met continually by the protest\r\n  and opposition of the Democratic party. The war against the States\r\n  was unconstitutional. There was no right to coerce sovereign States.\r\n  The war was a failure, and a dishonorable peace was demanded. The\r\n  legal tenders were illegal. The constitutional amendments were void.\r\n  And so through this whole brilliant history of achievement in this\r\n  administration we were followed by the Democratic statesman protesting\r\n  against every step and throwing every impediment in the way of\r\n  National success until it seemed to be true of many of their leaders\r\n  that in their estimation nothing was lawful, nothing was lovely, that\r\n  did not conduce to the success of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  Now, what conclusion shall we draw? Is there anything in this story,\r\n  so briefly and imperfectly told, to suggest any conclusion as to the\r\n  inadequacy or incompetency of the Republican party to deal with any\r\n  question that is now presented for solution or that we may meet in the\r\n  progress of this people's history? Why, countrymen, these problems\r\n  in government were new. We took the ship of state when there was\r\n  treachery at the helm, when there was mutiny on the deck, when the\r\n  ship was among the rocks, and we put loyalty at the helm; we brought\r\n  the deck into order and subjection. We have brought the ship into\r\n  the wide and open sea of prosperity, and is it to be suggested that\r\n  the party that has accomplished these magnificent achievements cannot\r\n  sail and manage the good ship in the frequented roadways of ordinary\r\n  commerce? What is there now before us that presents itself for\r\n  solution?\r\n\r\n  What questions are we to grapple with? What unfinished work\r\n  remains to be done? It seems to me that the work that is unfinished\r\n  is to make that constitutional grant of citizenship, the franchise\r\n  to the colored men of the South, a practical and living reality.\r\n  The condition of things is such in this country--a government by\r\n  constitutional majority--that whenever the people become convinced\r\n  that an administration or a law does not represent the will of the\r\n  majority of our qualified electors, then that administration ceases\r\n  to challenge the respect of our people and that law ceases to command\r\n  their willing obedience. This is a republican government, a government\r\n  by majority, the majorities to be ascertained by a fair count and each\r\n  elector expressing his will at the ballot-box. I know of no reason why\r\n  any law should bind my conscience that does not have this sanction\r\n  behind it. I know of no reason why I should yield respect to any\r\n  executive officer whose title is not based upon a majority vote of the\r\n  qualified electors of this country. What is the condition of things in\r\n  the Southern States to-day?\r\n\r\n  The Republican vote is absolutely suppressed. Elections in many of\r\n  those States have become a farce. In the last congressional election\r\n  in the State of Alabama there were several congressional districts\r\n  where the entire vote for members of Congress did not reach 2,000;\r\n  whereas in most of the districts of the North the vote cast at our\r\n  congressional elections goes from 30,000 to 50,000. I had occasion to\r\n  say a day or two ago that in a single congressional district in the\r\n  State of Nebraska there were more votes cast to elect one Congressman\r\n  than were cast in the State of Alabama at the same election to elect\r\n  their whole delegation. Out of what does this come? The suppression of\r\n  the Republican vote; the understanding among our Democratic friends\r\n  that it is not necessary that they should vote because their opponents\r\n  are not allowed to vote. But some one will suggest: \"Is there a remedy\r\n  for this?\" I do not know, my fellow citizens, how far there is a legal\r\n  remedy under our Constitution, but it does not seem to me to be an\r\n  adequate answer. It does not seem to me to be conclusive against the\r\n  agitation of the question even if we should be compelled to respond\r\n  to the arrogant question that is asked us: \"What are you going to\r\n  do about it?\" Even if we should be compelled to answer: \"We can do\r\n  nothing but protest,\" is it not worth while here, and in relation to\r\n  this American question, that we should at least lift up our protest;\r\n  that we should at least denounce the wrong; that we should at least\r\n  deprive the perpetrators of it of what we used to call the usufructs\r\n  of the crime? If you cannot prevent a burglar from breaking into your\r\n  house you will do a great deal towards discouraging burglary if you\r\n  prevent him from carrying off anything, and so it seems to me that if\r\n  we can, upon this question, arouse the indignant protest of the North,\r\n  and unite our efforts in a determination that those who perpetrate\r\n  these wrongs against popular suffrage shall not by means of those\r\n  wrongs seat a President in Washington to secure the Federal patronage\r\n  in a State, we shall have done much to bring this wrong to an end. But\r\n  at least while we are protesting by representatives from our State\r\n  Department at Washington against wrongs perpetrated in Russia against\r\n  the Jew, and in our popular assemblies here against the wrongs which\r\n  England has inflicted upon Ireland, shall we not at least in reference\r\n  to this gigantic and intolerable wrong in our own country, as a party,\r\n  lift up a stalwart and determined protest against it?\r\n\r\n  But some of these independent journalists, about which our friend\r\n  MacMillan talked, call this the \"bloody shirt.\" They say we are trying\r\n  to revive the strife of the war, to rake over the extinct embers, to\r\n  kindle the fire again. I want it understood that for one I have no\r\n  quarrel with the South for what took place between 1861 and 1865. I am\r\n  willing to forget that they were rebels, at least as soon as they are\r\n  willing to forget it themselves, and that time does not seem to have\r\n  come yet to them. But our complaint is against what was done in 1884,\r\n  not against what was done during the war. Our complaint is against\r\n  what will be done this year, not what was done between 1861 and 1865.\r\n  No bloody shirt--though that cry never had any terrors for me. I\r\n  believe we greatly underestimate the importance of bringing the issue\r\n  to the front, and with that oft-time Republican courage and outspoken\r\n  fidelity to truth denouncing it the land over. If we cannot do\r\n  anything else we can either make these people ashamed of this outrage\r\n  against the ballot or make the world ashamed of them.\r\n\r\n  There is another question to which the Republican party has\r\n  committed itself, and on the line of which it has accomplished, as\r\n  I believe, much for the prosperity of this country. I believe the\r\n  Republican party is pledged and ought to be pledged to the doctrine of\r\n  the protection of American industries and American labor. I believe\r\n  that in so far as our native inventive genius--which seems to have\r\n  no limit--our productive forces can supply the American market, we\r\n  ought to keep it for ourselves. And yet this new captain on the bridge\r\n  seems to congratulate himself on the fact that the voyage is still\r\n  prosperous notwithstanding the change of commanders; who seems to\r\n  forget that the reason that the voyage is still prosperous is because\r\n  the course of the ship was marked out before he went on the bridge and\r\n  the rudder tied down. He has attempted to take a new direction since\r\n  he has been in command, with a view of changing the sailing course of\r\n  the old craft, but it has seemed to me that he has made the mistake of\r\n  mistaking the flashlight of some British lighthouse for the light of\r\n  day. I do not intend here to-night in this presence to discuss this\r\n  tariff question in any detail. I only want to say that in the passage\r\n  of what is now so flippantly called the war tariff, to raise revenue\r\n  to carry on the war out of the protective duties which were then\r\n  levied, there has come to this country a prosperity and development\r\n  which would have been impossible without it, and that reversal of this\r\n  policy now, at the suggestion of Mr. Cleveland, according to the line\r\n  of the blind statesman from Texas, would be to stay and interrupt\r\n  this march of prosperity on which we have entered. I am one of those\r\n  uninstructed political economists that have an impression that some\r\n  things may be too cheap; that I cannot find myself in full sympathy\r\n  with this demand for cheaper coats, which seems to me necessarily to\r\n  involve a cheaper man and woman under the coat. I believe it is true\r\n  to-day that we have many things in this country that are too cheap,\r\n  because whenever it is proved that the man or woman who produces any\r\n  article cannot get a decent living out of it, then it is too cheap.\r\n\r\n  But I have not intended to discuss in detail any of these questions\r\n  with which we have grappled, upon which we have proclaimed a policy,\r\n  or which we must meet in the near future. I am only here to-night\r\n  briefly to sketch to you the magnificent career of this party to which\r\n  we give our allegiance--a union of the States, restored, cemented,\r\n  regenerated; a Constitution cleansed of its compromises with slavery\r\n  and brought into harmony with the immortal Declaration; a race\r\n  emancipated, given citizenship and the ballot; a national credit\r\n  preserved and elevated until it stands unequalled among the nations of\r\n  the world; a currency more prized than the coin for which it may be\r\n  exchanged; a story of prosperity more marvellous than was ever written\r\n  by the historian before. This is in brief outline the magnificent way\r\n  in which the Republican party has wrought. It stands to-day for a\r\n  pure, equal, honest ballot the country over. It stands to-day without\r\n  prejudice or malice, the well-wisher of every State in this Union;\r\n  disposed to fill all the streams of the South with prosperity, and\r\n  demanding only that the terms of the surrender at Appomattox shall be\r\n  complied with. When that magnificent act of clemency was witnessed,\r\n  when those sublime and gracious words were uttered by General Grant\r\n  at Appomattox, the country applauded. We said to those misguided men:\r\n  \"Go home\"--in the language of the parole--\"and you shall be unmolested\r\n  while you obey the laws in force at the place where you reside.\" We\r\n  ask nothing more, but we cannot quietly submit to the fact, while it\r\n  is true everywhere in the United States that the man who fought for\r\n  years against his country is allowed the full, free, unrestricted\r\n  exercise of his new citizenship, when it shall not also be true\r\n  everywhere that every man who followed Lincoln in his political views,\r\n  and every soldier who fought to uphold the flag, shall in the same\r\n  full, ample manner be secured in his political rights.\r\n\r\n  This disfranchisement question is hardly a Southern question in all\r\n  strictness. It has gone into Dakota, and the intelligent and loyal\r\n  population of that Territory is deprived, was at the last election,\r\n  and will be again, of any participation in the decision of national\r\n  questions solely because the prevailing sentiment of Dakota is\r\n  Republican. Not only that, but this disregard of purity and honesty in\r\n  our elections invaded Ohio in an attempt to seize the United States\r\n  Senate by cheating John Sherman, that gallant statesman, out of his\r\n  seat in the Senate. And it came here to Illinois, in an attempt also\r\n  to defeat that man whom I loved so much, John A. Logan, out of his\r\n  seat in the United States Senate. And it has come into our own State\r\n  (Indiana) by tally-sheet frauds, committed by individuals, it is true,\r\n  but justified and defended by the Democratic party of the State in an\r\n  attempt to cheat us all out of our fair election majorities. It was\r\n  and is a question that lies over every other question, for every other\r\n  question must be submitted to this tribunal for decision, and if the\r\n  tribunal is corrupted, why shall we debate questions at all? Who can\r\n  doubt whether, in defeat or victorious, in the future as in the past,\r\n  taking high ground upon all these questions, the same stirring cause\r\n  that assembled our party in the beginning will yet be found drawing\r\n  like a great magnet the young and intelligent moral elements of our\r\n  country into the Republican organization? Defeated once, we are ready\r\n  for this campaign which is impending, and I believe that the great\r\n  party of 1860 is gathering together for the coming election with a\r\n  force and a zeal and a resolution that will inevitably carry it, under\r\n  that standard-bearer who may be chosen here in June, to victory in\r\n  November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JUNE 25, 1888.\r\n\r\n_Nomination Day._\r\n\r\n\r\nA few hours after the receipt of the news of the nomination of General\r\nHarrison for President, on Monday, June 25, 1888, delegations from\r\nneighboring cities and towns began to arrive to congratulate him. From\r\nthe moment the result at Chicago was known, and for two days thereafter,\r\nthe city of Indianapolis was the scene of excitement and enthusiasm\r\nunparalleled in its history.\r\n\r\nThe first out-of-town delegation to arrive was the Republican Club of\r\nDanville, Hendricks County, Indiana, three hundred strong, led by the\r\nHon. L. M. Campbell, Rev. Ira J. Chase, Major J. B. Homan, Joel T.\r\nBaker, Capt. Worrel, and E. Hogate.\r\n\r\nThey came on the afternoon of the twenty-fifth and marched to the\r\nHarrison residence escorted by about five thousand excited citizens of\r\nIndianapolis, and it was to these men of Hendricks that General Harrison\r\nmade his first public speech--after his nomination--which proved to be\r\nthe opening words of a series of impromptu addresses remarkable for\r\ntheir eloquence, conciseness and variety, and generally conceded by the\r\npress of the day to have been the most brilliant and successful campaign\r\nspeeches of his generation.\r\n\r\nTo the Danville Club General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I am very much obliged to my Hendricks County friends\r\n  for this visit. The trouble you have taken to make this call so soon\r\n  after information of the result at Chicago reached you induces me\r\n  to say a word or two, though you will not, of course, expect any\r\n  reference to politics or any extended reference to the result at\r\n  Chicago. I very highly appreciate the wise, discreet and affectionate\r\n  interest which our delegation and the people of Indiana have displayed\r\n  in the convention which has just closed at Chicago. [Cries of \"Good!\"\r\n  \"Good!\" and cheers.] I accept your visit to-day as an expression of\r\n  your confidence and respect, and I thank you for it. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Danville visit concluded before another organization\r\nfrom Hendricks County arrived, the Republican Club of Plainfield, led by\r\nDr. Harlan, William G. Ellis, Oscar Hadley, and A. T. Harrison.\r\n\r\nResponding to their call, General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I can only thank you for this evidence of your\r\n  friendliness. That so many of my Hendricks County friends should have\r\n  reached Indianapolis so soon after hearing the result at Chicago is\r\n  very gratifying. The people of your county have always given me the\r\n  most hearty support whenever I have appealed to them for support. I\r\n  have a most affectionate interest in your county and in its people,\r\n  especially because of the fact that it furnished two companies to the\r\n  regiment which I took into the field. Some of the best and most loyal\r\n  of these soldiers gave their lives for their country in the battles in\r\n  which the regiment was engaged. These incidents have attached me to\r\n  the county, and I trust I have yet, even here among this group, some\r\n  of my friends of the Seventieth Indiana surviving, who will always be\r\n  glad to extend to me, as I to them, a comrade's hand. I thank you for\r\n  this call.\r\n\r\nA few moments later two large delegations arrived from Hamilton and\r\nHoward Counties: Hon. J. R. Gray of Noblesville and Milton Garrigus of\r\nKokomo delivered congratulatory addresses on behalf of their townsmen,\r\nto which General Harrison responded:\r\n\r\n  I thank you, my friends of Hamilton County, for this call. I know\r\n  the political steadfastness of that true and tried county. Your people\r\n  have always been kind to me. I thank you for this evidence of your\r\n  confidence and respect.\r\n\r\n  Howard County. Of that county I may say what I have said of Hamilton\r\n  County. It is a neighbor in location and it is a neighbor in good\r\n  works. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the twenty-fifth five thousand or more neighbors and\r\nresidents of the city congregated before the Harrison residence.\r\n\r\nThe General, on appearing, was greeted by a demonstration lasting\r\nseveral minutes. The standard-bearers, carrying the great banner of\r\nthe Oliver P. Morton Club, made their way to the steps and held the\r\nflag over his head. Hon. W. N. Harding finally quieted the crowd and\r\npresented General Harrison, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Neighbors and Friends_--I am profoundly sensible of the kindness\r\n  which you evidence to-night in gathering in such large numbers\r\n  to extend to me your congratulations over the result at Chicago.\r\n  It would be altogether inappropriate that I should say anything\r\n  of a partisan character. Many of my neighbors who differ with me\r\n  politically have kindly extended to me, as citizens of Indianapolis,\r\n  their congratulations over this event. [Cries of \"Good!\" \"Good!\"] Such\r\n  congratulations, as well as those of my neighbors who sympathize with\r\n  me in my political beliefs, are exceedingly grateful. I have been a\r\n  long time a resident of Indianapolis--over thirty years. Many who are\r\n  here before me have been with me, during all those years, citizens of\r\n  this great and growing capital of a magnificent State. We have seen\r\n  the development and growth of this city. We are proud of its position\r\n  to-day, and we look forward in the future to a development which shall\r\n  far outstrip that which the years behind us have told. I thank you\r\n  sincerely for this evidence that those who have known me well and long\r\n  give me still their confidence and respect. [Cheers and applause.]\r\n\r\n  Kings sometimes bestow decorations upon those whom they desire to\r\n  honor, but that man is most highly decorated who has the affectionate\r\n  regard of his neighbors and friends. [Great applause, and cries of\r\n  \"Hurrah for Harrison!\"] I will only again thank you most cordially\r\n  for this demonstration of your regard. I shall be glad, from time to\r\n  time, as opportunity offers, to meet you all personally, and regret\r\n  that to-night this crowd is so great that it will be impossible for me\r\n  to take each one of you by the hand [cries of \"We'll forgive you!\"],\r\n  but we will be here together and my house will always open its doors\r\n  gladly to any of you when you may desire to see me. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JUNE 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening of the day following his nomination General Harrison was\r\nvisited by the surviving members of his old regiment, the Seventieth\r\nIndiana Volunteers, led by Major George W. Grubbs of Martinsville. There\r\nwas also present a delegation from Boone County headed by the Hon. Henry\r\nL. Bynum, O. P. Mahan and S. J. Thompson; also the returning delegates\r\nfrom Vermont to the Chicago convention, headed by Gov. Redfield Proctor\r\nand General J. G. McCullough.\r\n\r\nResponding to the address of Major Grubbs, on behalf of the veterans,\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades_--Called, as I have been, by the national convention of\r\n  one of the great political parties of this country to be its candidate\r\n  for the presidency, it will probably be my fortune before the election\r\n  to receive many delegations representing various interests and classes\r\n  of our fellow-citizens, but I am sure that out of them all there will\r\n  come none whose coming will touch my heart so deeply as this visit\r\n  from my comrades of the Seventieth Indiana and these scattered members\r\n  of the other regiments that constituted the First Brigade of the Third\r\n  Division of the Twentieth Army Corps. I recall the scene to which\r\n  Major Grubbs has alluded. I remember that summer day, when, equipped\r\n  and armed, we were called to leave our homes and cross the Ohio River\r\n  and enter the territory that was in arms against the Government which\r\n  we were sworn to support. I recall, with you, the tender parting, the\r\n  wringing of hearts with which we left those we loved. I recall the\r\n  high and buoyant determination, the resolute carriage with which you\r\n  went to do your part in the work of suppressing the great rebellion.\r\n  I remember the scenes through which we went in that hard discipline\r\n  of service and sickness, and all of those hard incidents which are\r\n  necessary to convert citizens into veterans.\r\n\r\n  I remember the scenes of battle in which we stood together. I\r\n  remember especially that broad and deep grave at the foot of the\r\n  Resaca hill where we left those gallant comrades who fell in that\r\n  desperate charge. I remember, through it all, the gallantry, devotion\r\n  and steadfastness, the high set patriotism you always exhibited. I\r\n  remember how, after sweeping down with Sherman from Chattanooga to the\r\n  sea and up again through the Carolinas and Virginia, you, with those\r\n  gallant armies that had entered the gate of the South by Louisville\r\n  and Vicksburg, marched in the great review up the grand avenue of our\r\n  Nation's capital.\r\n\r\n  I remember that proud scene of which we were part that day; the\r\n  glad rejoicing as our faces were turned homeward, the applause which\r\n  greeted us as the banner of our regiment was now and then recognized\r\n  by some home friends who had gathered to see us--the whole course of\r\n  these incidents of battle, of sickness, of death, of victory, crowned\r\n  thus by the triumphant reassertion of national authority, and by the\r\n  muster out and our return to those homes that we loved, made again\r\n  secure against all the perils which had threatened them.\r\n\r\n  I feel that in this campaign upon which I am entering, and which\r\n  will undoubtedly cause careful scrutiny, perhaps unkind and even\r\n  malicious assault, all that related to my not conspicuous but loyal\r\n  services with you in the army I may confidently leave, with my honor,\r\n  in the hands of the surviving members of the Seventieth Indiana,\r\n  whatever their political faith may be. [Cries of \"That is true,\r\n  General!\" and \"Yes!\" \"Yes!\"]\r\n\r\n  May I ask you now, for I am too deeply moved by this visit to speak\r\n  as I would desire, that each one will enter this door, that will\r\n  always open with a hearty welcome to you, and let me take you by the\r\n  hand? [Cheering.]\r\n\r\nThe event of the night was the visit of the California delegation,\r\nat ten o'clock, accompanied by the Indiana delegation to Chicago and\r\nseveral hundred personal friends and neighbors of General Harrison just\r\nreturned from Chicago, where they had been laboring for his nomination.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. M. H. de Young and John F. Ellison of California delivered\r\ncongratulatory addresses, on conclusion of which the Californians\r\nhastened to their train; after they departed the great crowd refused to\r\ndisperse and called repeatedly for General Harrison, who responded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-Citizens, Ladies and Gentlemen_--I am very deeply impressed\r\n  and gratified with this magnificent demonstration of your respect. No\r\n  man can be so highly honored by any convention, or by any decoration\r\n  which any of the authorities of the Government can bestow, as by the\r\n  respect and confidence of those who live near him. My heart is touched\r\n  by this demonstration which my fellow-citizens have given me of their\r\n  personal respect for me. I do not, however, accept this manifestation\r\n  of interest as wholly due to myself. The great bulk of those who\r\n  are assembled here to-night manifest rather their interest in those\r\n  political principles which I have been called by the representatives,\r\n  in national convention of the Republican party, to represent in this\r\n  campaign. But I will not discuss any of those high issues to-night,\r\n  because I am glad to know that among those who are gathered here,\r\n  and among those who have paid me the compliment of their presence in\r\n  my home, there are many citizens of Indianapolis who differ with me\r\n  politically. I would not, therefore, if it were otherwise proper, mar\r\n  this occasion by the discussion of any political topic. I am glad to\r\n  have an opportunity to return my sincere and heartfelt thanks to the\r\n  Indiana delegation, and to that band of devoted friends who gathered\r\n  about them and assisted them in their work at Chicago. When I saw in\r\n  the newspaper press of the East and of the West the encomiums that\r\n  were passed by the correspondents upon the deportment and character of\r\n  the representatives of Indiana at Chicago, I was greatly pleased. When\r\n  I heard of their affectionate devotion, of their discreet and wise\r\n  presentation of the claims of Indiana, I was still further gratified.\r\n  And if the result of that convention had been, as it well might have\r\n  been if individuals had only been considered in the contest that was\r\n  there waged, the selection for this high place of some one other\r\n  than myself, I should have felt that the devoted interest, the wise\r\n  and faithful presentation by the Indiana delegation of the Indiana\r\n  situation was such that the failure to yield to their argument would\r\n  still have left me crowned with the highest crown that can be placed\r\n  upon mortal brow--the affection and confidence and discreet support\r\n  of my friends from Indiana. [Cries of \"Good!\" \"Good!\"] I am glad that\r\n  the despatches said of them, and truly said, that they conducted their\r\n  canvass with that gentle and respectful regard to the interests and\r\n  character of the others who were named for this high place, and that\r\n  they came home without those regrets which must have followed if this\r\n  victory had been won at the expense of any of those noble names that\r\n  were presented for the suffrage of the convention.\r\n\r\n  I do not feel at all that in selecting the candidate who was chosen\r\n  regard was had simply to the individual equipment and qualifications\r\n  for the duties of this high office. I feel sure that if the convention\r\n  had felt free to regard these things only, some other of those\r\n  distinguished men, old-time leaders of the Republican party, Blaine,\r\n  or Sherman, or Allison, or some of the others named--would have been\r\n  chosen in preference to me. I feel that it was the situation in\r\n  Indiana and its relation to the campaign that was impending rather\r\n  than the personal equipment or qualifications of the candidate that\r\n  was chosen that turned the choice of the convention in our direction.\r\n  We are here to-night to thank those members of the convention who\r\n  have done us the honor to pay our capital a visit to-night not only\r\n  for this visit, but for the support and interest which they took in\r\n  the Indiana candidacy in the convention at Chicago. I thank you again\r\n  for gathering here to-night. I am sure that in this demonstration\r\n  you give evidence that the interest in this campaign will not flag\r\n  until the election has determined the result of the contest. And I\r\n  feel sure, too, my fellow-citizens, that we have joined now a contest\r\n  of great principles, and that the armies which are to fight out this\r\n  great contest before the American people will encamp upon the high\r\n  plains of principle, and not in the low swamps of personal defamation\r\n  or detraction. [Cries of \"Hear!\" \"Hear!\" and \"Good!\"] Again I thank\r\n  you for the compliment of your presence here to-night, and bid you\r\n  good-night. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JUNE 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon representatives of the Marquette Club of\r\nChicago--of which General Harrison is an honorary member--called to\r\npresent a set of congratulatory resolutions adopted by the club. The\r\ncommittee comprised Geo. V. Lauman, H. D. Crocker, W. S. Gilbert, E. B.\r\nGould, H. M. Kingman and J. S. Moore.\r\n\r\nOne of the resolutions recited that\r\n\r\n\"The Marquette Club of Chicago takes great pride in the fact that within\r\nits walls and at its board was fired the first gun in Chicago of that\r\nmemorable contest which has culminated in the nomination of its most\r\nhonored member, General Benjamin Harrison, to fill the highest office\r\nwithin the gift of the American people.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison in response said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen of the Marquette Club_--I sincerely thank you for the\r\n  congratulations of the Marquette Club of Chicago. I well recollect\r\n  the evening I spent with you last February, and I remember how\r\n  favorably your club impressed me at that time as a body of active,\r\n  energetic young Republicans: not so much an organization for social\r\n  purposes as for active advancement of Republican principles in your\r\n  vicinity, and in the country as well. I thought I recognized in you\r\n  then an efficient body for work in the State of Illinois, one that\r\n  could in the coming campaign render signal service to the party whose\r\n  principles its members maintain. I rejoice in your coming to call on\r\n  me here, and I hope you will carry my sincere thanks to your members,\r\n  and make yourselves welcome at my home now and whenever you are in\r\n  Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of June 30 several thousand citizens, irrespective of\r\nparty, paid their respects to General Harrison; at the head of the\r\ncolumn marched four hundred veterans commanded by Moses G. McLain. Major\r\nJames L. Mitchell, a prominent Democrat, was spokesman for the veterans.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrade Mitchell and Fellow-Soldiers_--I sincerely thank you for\r\n  this evidence of your respect and comradeship. I am very certain that\r\n  there is no class whose confidence and respect I more highly prize or\r\n  more earnestly covet than that of the soldiers who, in the great war\r\n  from 1861 to 1865, upheld the loved banner of our country and brought\r\n  it home in honor. The comradeship of the war will never end until our\r\n  lives end. The fires in which our friendship was riveted and welded\r\n  were too hot for the bond ever to be broken. We sympathize with each\r\n  other in the glory of the common cause for which we fought. We went,\r\n  not as partisans, but as patriots, into the strife which involved\r\n  the national life. I am sure that no army was ever assembled in the\r\n  world's history that was gathered from higher impulses than the army\r\n  of the Union. [Cries of \"Right!\" \"Right!\"]\r\n\r\n  It was no sordid impulse, no hope of spoils that induced these men\r\n  to sunder the tender associations of home and forsake their business\r\n  pursuits to look into the grim face of death with unblanched cheeks\r\n  and firm and resolute eyes. They are the kind of men who draw their\r\n  impulses from the high springs of truth and duty. The army was great\r\n  in its assembling. It came with an impulse that was majestic and\r\n  terrible. It was as great in its muster-out as in the brilliant work\r\n  which had been done in the field. When the war was over the soldier\r\n  was not left at the tavern. Every man had in some humble place a chair\r\n  by some fireside where he was loved and towards which his heart went\r\n  forward with a quick step. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  And so this great army that had rallied for the defence and\r\n  preservation of the country was disbanded without tumult or riot or\r\n  any public disturbance. It had covered the country with the mantle of\r\n  its protection when it needed it, as the snows of spring cover the\r\n  early vegetation, and when the warm sun of peace shone upon it, it\r\n  disappeared as the snow sinks into the earth to refresh and vivify\r\n  the summer growth. They found their homes; they carried their brawn\r\n  and intellect into all the pursuits of peace to stimulate them and\r\n  lift them up; they added their great impulse to that great wave of\r\n  prosperity which has swept over our country ever since. [Applause.]\r\n  But in nothing was this war greater than in that it led a race into\r\n  freedom and brought those whom we had conquered in the struggle\r\n  into the full enjoyment of a restored citizenship, and shared again\r\n  with them the responsibilities and duties of a restored government.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you to-night most sincerely for this evidence of your\r\n  comradeship. I thank, specially, those friends who differ with me in\r\n  their political views, that they have put these things aside to-night,\r\n  and have come here to give me a comrade's greeting. [Applause.] May I\r\n  have the privilege now, without detaining you longer, of taking by the\r\n  hand every soldier here? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nLater, the same evening, the Harrison League of Indianapolis, numbering\r\nthree hundred colored men, assembled on the lawn and congratulated the\r\nRepublican nominee through its spokesman, Mr. Ben D. Bagby. General\r\nHarrison's response was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Bagby and Gentlemen of the Harrison Club_--I assure you that I\r\n  have a sincere respect for, and a very deep interest in, the colored\r\n  people of the United States. My memory, as a boy, goes back to the\r\n  time when slavery existed in the Southern States. I was born upon the\r\n  Ohio River, which was the boundary between the free State of Ohio and\r\n  the slave State of Kentucky. Some of my earliest recollections relate\r\n  to the stirring and dramatic interest which was now and then excited\r\n  by the pursuit of an escaping slave for the hope of offered rewards.\r\n\r\n  I remember, as a boy, wandering once through my grandfather's\r\n  orchard at North Bend, and in pressing through an alder thicket that\r\n  grew on its margin I saw sitting in its midst a colored man with the\r\n  frightened look of a fugitive in his eye, and attempting to satisfy\r\n  his hunger with some walnuts he had gathered. He noticed my approach\r\n  with a fierce, startled look, to see whether I was likely to betray\r\n  him; I was frightened myself and left him in some trepidation, but I\r\n  kept his secret. [Cries of \"Good!\" \"Good!\"] I have seen the progress\r\n  which has been made in the legislation relating to your race, and the\r\n  progress that the race itself has made since that day. When I came to\r\n  Indiana to reside the unfriendly black code was in force. My memory\r\n  goes back to the time when colored witnesses were first allowed to\r\n  appear in court in this State to testify in cases where white men were\r\n  parties. Prior to that time, as you know, you had been excluded from\r\n  the right to tell in court, under oath, your side of the story in any\r\n  legal controversy with white men. [Cries of \"I know that!\"] The laws\r\n  prevented your coming here. In every way you were at a disadvantage,\r\n  even in the free States. I have lived to see this unfriendly\r\n  legislation removed from our statute-books and the unfriendly section\r\n  of our State Constitution repealed. I have lived not only to see that,\r\n  but to see the race emancipated and slavery extinct. [Cries of \"Amen\r\n  to that!\"]\r\n\r\n  Nothing gives me more pleasure among the results of the war than\r\n  this. History will give a prominent place in the story of this great\r\n  war to the fact that it resulted in making all men free, and gave\r\n  to you equal civil rights. The imagination and art of the poet, the\r\n  tongue of the orator, the skill of the artist will be brought under\r\n  contribution to tell this story of the emancipation of the souls of\r\n  men. [Applause and cries of \"Amen!\"]\r\n\r\n  Nothing gives me so much gratification as a Republican as to feel\r\n  that in all the steps that led to this great result the Republican\r\n  party sympathized with you, pioneered for you in legislation, and was\r\n  the architect of those great measures of relief which have so much\r\n  ameliorated your condition. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I know nowhere in this country of a monument that I behold with so\r\n  much interest, that touches my heart so deeply, as that monument at\r\n  Washington representing the Proclamation of Emancipation by President\r\n  Lincoln, the kneeling black man at the feet of the martyred President,\r\n  with the shackles falling from his limbs.\r\n\r\n  I remember your faithfulness during the time of the war. I remember\r\n  your faithful service to the army as we were advancing through an\r\n  unknown country. We could always depend upon the faithfulness of the\r\n  black man. [Cries of \"Right you are!\"] He might be mistaken, but he\r\n  was never false. Many a time in the darkness of night have those\r\n  faithful men crept to our lines and given us information of the\r\n  approach of the enemy. I shall never forget a scene that I saw when\r\n  Sherman's army marched through a portion of North Carolina, between\r\n  Raleigh and Richmond, where our troops had never before been. The\r\n  colored people had not seen our flag since the banner of treason had\r\n  been set up in its stead. As we were passing through a village the\r\n  colored people flocked out to see once more the starry banner of\r\n  freedom, the emblem, promise, and security of their emancipation. I\r\n  remember an aged woman, over whom nearly a century of slavery must\r\n  have passed, pressed forward to see the welcome banner that told her\r\n  that her soul would go over into the presence of her God. I remember\r\n  her exultation of spirit as she danced in the dusty road before our\r\n  moving column, and, like Miriam of old, called upon her soul to\r\n  rejoice in the deliverance which God had wrought by the coming of\r\n  those who stood for and made secure the Proclamation of Emancipation.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I rejoice in all that you have accomplished since you have been\r\n  free. I recall no scene more pathetic than that which I have often\r\n  seen about our camp-fires. An aged man, a fugitive from slavery, had\r\n  found freedom in our camp. After a day of hard work, when taps had\r\n  sounded and the lights in the tents were out, I have seen him with the\r\n  spelling-book that the chaplain had given him, lying prone upon the\r\n  ground taxing his old eyes, and pointing with his hardened finger to\r\n  the letters of the alphabet, as he endeavored to open to his clouded\r\n  brain the avenues of information and light.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that that same desire to increase and enlarge\r\n  your information possesses the race to-day. It is the open way for\r\n  the race to that perfect emancipation which will remove remaining\r\n  prejudices and secure to you in all parts of the land an equal and\r\n  just participation in the government of this country. It cannot much\r\n  longer be withholden from you.\r\n\r\n  Again I thank you for your presence here to-night and will be glad\r\n  to take by the hand any of you who desire to see me. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 4, 1888.\r\n\r\n_The Notification._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indiana Republican State Committee, through its chairman, the Hon.\r\nJames N. Huston, designated as a committee to receive and escort the\r\ncommittee on notification from the National Convention the following\r\ngentlemen:\r\n\r\nEx-Gov. Albert G. Porter, Mayor Caleb S. Denny, Col. John C. New, J. N.\r\nHuston, Col. J. H. Bridgland, Hon. Stanton J. Peelle, William Wallace,\r\nM. G. McLain, N. S. Byram, Hon. W. H. Calkins, W. J. Richards, and Hon.\r\nH. M. LaFollette.\r\n\r\nAt noon on July 4 the notification committee representing the Republican\r\nNational Convention arrived under escort at the residence of General\r\nHarrison, No. 674 Delaware Street. The following delegates comprised the\r\ncommittee:\r\n\r\nJudge Morris M. Estee of California, _Chairman_; Alabama, A. H.\r\nHendricks; Arkansas, Logan H. Roots; California, Paris Kilburn;\r\nColorado, Henry R. Wolcott; Connecticut, E. S. Henry; Delaware, J.\r\nR. Whitaker; Florida, F. M. Wicker; Georgia, W. W. Brown; Illinois,\r\nThomas W. Scott; Indiana, J. N. Huston; Iowa, Thomas Updegraff; Kansas,\r\nHenry L. Alden; Kentucky, George Denny; Louisiana, Andrew Hero; Maine,\r\nSamuel H. Allen; Maryland, Wm. M. Marine; Massachusetts, F.

Minor; Wyoming, C. D. Clark.\r\n\r\nChairman Estee spoke for the committee; his address signed by each\r\nmember was also presented to General Harrison, who in a full, clear\r\nvoice replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee_--The official notice\r\n  which you have brought of the nomination conferred upon me by the\r\n  Republican National Convention recently in session at Chicago\r\n  excites emotions of a profound, though of a somewhat conflicting,\r\n  character. That after full deliberation and free consultation the\r\n  representatives of the Republican party of the United States should\r\n  have concluded that the great principles enunciated in the platform\r\n  adopted by the convention could be in some measure safely confided\r\n  to my care is an honor of which I am deeply sensible and for which\r\n  I am very grateful. I do not assume or believe that this choice\r\n  implies that the convention found in me any pre-eminent fitness or\r\n  exceptional fidelity to the principles of government to which we are\r\n  mutually pledged. My satisfaction with the result would be altogether\r\n  spoiled if that result had been reached by any unworthy methods or\r\n  by a disparagement of the more eminent men who divided with me the\r\n  suffrages of the convention. I accept the nomination with so deep a\r\n  sense of the dignity of the office and of the gravity of its duties\r\n  and the responsibilities as altogether to exclude any feeling of\r\n  exultation or pride. The principles of government and the practices\r\n  in administration upon which issues are now fortunately so clearly\r\n  made are so important in their relations to the national and to\r\n  individual prosperity that we may expect an unusual popular interest\r\n  in the campaign. Relying wholly upon the considerate judgment of our\r\n  fellow-citizens and the gracious favor of God, we will confidently\r\n  submit our cause to the arbitrament of a free ballot.\r\n\r\n  The day you have chosen for this visit suggests no thoughts that are\r\n  not in harmony with the occasion. The Republican party has walked in\r\n  the light of the Declaration of Independence. It has lifted the shaft\r\n  of patriotism upon the foundation laid at Bunker Hill. It has made\r\n  the more perfect union secure by making all men free. Washington and\r\n  Lincoln, Yorktown and Appomattox, the Declaration of Independence and\r\n  the Proclamation of Emancipation are naturally and worthily associated\r\n  in our thoughts to-day.\r\n\r\n  As soon as may be possible I shall by letter communicate to your\r\n  chairman a more formal acceptance of the nomination, but it may be\r\n  proper for me now to say that I have already examined the platform\r\n  with some care, and that its declarations, to some of which your\r\n  chairman has alluded, are in harmony with my views. It gives me\r\n  pleasure, gentlemen, to receive you in my home and to thank you for\r\n  the cordial manner in which you have conveyed your official message.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these formalities Charles W. Clisbee, one of\r\nthe secretaries of the National Convention, presented the nominee an\r\nengrossed official copy of the Republican platform.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1888, was a memorable day in the life of General Harrison and\r\nhis wife; for aside from the official notification of his nomination,\r\nthey were the recipients of congratulations of a unique character from\r\nthe Tippecanoe Club of Marion County, a political organization composed\r\nexclusively of veterans who had voted for General William Henry Harrison\r\nin the campaigns of 1836 or 1840.\r\n\r\nNearly all the younger and able-bodied members attended the Chicago\r\nConvention and worked unceasingly for the nomination of General Benjamin\r\nHarrison.\r\n\r\nTheir average age was seventy-five years, while one member, James\r\nHubbard of Mapleton, was over one hundred years old.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the fourth, ninety-one of these veterans commanded\r\nby their marshal, Isaac Taylor, marched to General Harrison's house\r\nthrough the rain. They had adopted a congratulatory address which was\r\npresented by a committee consisting of Dr. George W. New, Judge J. B.\r\nJulian, and Dr. Lawson Abbett, to which General Harrison feelingly\r\nreplied as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Tippecanoe Club of Marion\r\n  County_--I am very deeply touched by your visit to-day. The respect\r\n  and confidence of such a body of men is a crown. Many of you I\r\n  have known since I first came to Indianapolis. I count you my\r\n  friends. [Cries of \"Yes, sir, we are!\"] You have not only shown\r\n  your friendliness and respect in the political contests in which my\r\n  name has been used, but very many of you in the social and business\r\n  relations of life extended to me, when I came a young man among you,\r\n  encouragement and help. I know that at the beginning your respect and\r\n  confidence was builded upon the respect, and even affection--may I not\r\n  say, which you bore to my grandfather. [A voice, \"Yes, that is true!\"]\r\n  May I not, without self-laudation, now say that upon that foundation\r\n  you have since created a modest structure of respect for me? [Cries\r\n  of \"Yes, sir!\" \"We have!\" \"That's the talk!\"] I came among you with\r\n  the heritage I trust, of a good name [cries of \"That's so!\" \"Good\r\n  stock!\"], such as all of you enjoy. It was the only inheritance that\r\n  has been transmitted in our family. [Cries of \"It has been!\"] I think\r\n  you recollect, and, perhaps, it was that as much as aught else that\r\n  drew your choice in 1840 to the Whig candidate for the presidency,\r\n  that he came out of Virginia to the West with no fortune but the sword\r\n  he bore, and unsheathed it here in the defence of our frontier homes.\r\n  He transmitted little to his descendants but the respect he had won\r\n  from his fellow-citizens. It seems to be the settled habit in our\r\n  family to leave nothing else to our children. [Laughter and cries of\r\n  \"That's enough!\"] My friends, I am a thorough believer in the American\r\n  test of character [cries of \"That's right!\"]: the rule must be applied\r\n  to a man's own life when his stature is taken He will not build high\r\n  who does not build for himself. [Applause and cries of \"That's true!\"]\r\n  I believe also in the American opportunity which puts the starry sky\r\n  above every boy's head, and sets his foot upon a ladder which he may\r\n  climb until his strength gives out.\r\n\r\n  I thank you cordially for your greeting, and for this tender of\r\n  your help in this campaign. It will add dignity and strength to the\r\n  campaign when it is found that the zealous, earnest, and intelligent\r\n  co-operation of men of mature years like you is given to it. The\r\n  Whig party to which you belonged had but one serious fault--there\r\n  were not enough of them after 1840. [Laughter and applause.] We have\r\n  since received to our ranks in the new and greater party to which you\r\n  now belong accessions from those who were then our opponents, and\r\n  we now unite with them in the defence of principles which were dear\r\n  to you as Whigs, which were indeed the cherished and distinguishing\r\n  principles of the Whig party; and in the olden and better time, of the\r\n  Democratic party also. Chief among these were a reverent devotion to\r\n  the Constitution and the flag, and a firm faith in the benefits of a\r\n  protective tariff. If, in some of the States, under a sudden and mad\r\n  impulse some of the old Whigs who stood with you in the campaign of\r\n  1840, to which you have referred, wandered from us, may we not send to\r\n  them to-day the greetings of these their old associates, and invite\r\n  them to come again into the fold?\r\n\r\n  And now, gentlemen, I thank you again for your visit, and would be\r\n  glad if you would remain with us for a little personal intercourse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive hundred commercial travellers paid a visit to General Harrison\r\non July 7; they came from all parts of the country, principally from\r\nPhiladelphia, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Louisville. Major James R.\r\nRoss was marshal of their delegation; David E. Coffin presented the\r\n\"drummers\" to General and Mrs. Harrison.\r\n\r\nWhen all had gathered within or about the residence, Col. Ed. H. Wolfe\r\nof Rushville, Indiana, delivered a congratulatory address on behalf of\r\nthe visitors. General Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen of the Commercial Travellers' Association of Indiana\r\n  and Visiting Friends_--I most heartily thank you for this cordial\r\n  manifestation of your respect. It is to be expected when one has been\r\n  named for office by one of the great parties that those who are in\r\n  accord with him in his political convictions will show their interest\r\n  in the campaign which he represents, but it is particularly gratifying\r\n  to me that many of you who differ with me in political opinion,\r\n  reserving your own opinions and choice, have come here to-night to\r\n  express your gratification, personally, that I have been named by the\r\n  Republican party as its candidate for the presidency.\r\n\r\n  It is a very pleasant thing in politics when this sort of testimony\r\n  is possible, and it is very gratifying to me to-night to receive it at\r\n  your hands. I do not know why we cannot hold our political differences\r\n  with respect for each other's opinions, and with entire respect for\r\n  each other personally. Our opinions upon the great questions which\r\n  divide parties ought not to be held in such a spirit of bigotry as\r\n  will prevent us from extending to a political opponent the concession\r\n  of honesty in his opinion and that personal respect to which he may be\r\n  entitled. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I very much value this visit from you, for I think I know how to\r\n  estimate the commercial travellers of America. I am not going to open\r\n  before you to-night any store of flattery. I do not think there is\r\n  any market for it here. [Laughter and cries of \"That's good!\" and\r\n  cheers.] You know the value of that commodity perfectly. [Laughter\r\n  and continued applause.] I do not mean to suggest at all that you are\r\n  dealers in it yourselves [laughter] in your intercourse with your\r\n  customers, but I do mean to say that your wide acquaintance with men,\r\n  that judgment of character and even of the moods of men which is\r\n  essential to the successful prosecution of your business makes you a\r\n  very unpromising audience upon which to pass any stale compliments.\r\n\r\n  My memory goes back to the time when there were no commercial\r\n  travellers. When I first came to Indianapolis to reside your\r\n  profession was not known. The retail merchant went to the wholesale\r\n  house and made his selections there. I appreciate the fact that those\r\n  who successfully pursue your calling must, in the nature of things,\r\n  be masters of the business in which you are engaged and possess great\r\n  adaptability and a high order of intelligence.\r\n\r\n  I thank you again for this visit; and give you in return my most\r\n  sincere respect and regard. [Applause.] I regret that there is not\r\n  room enough here for your comfort [a voice: \"There will be more room\r\n  in the White House!\" Another: \"We will take your order now and deliver\r\n  the goods in November!\"], but I shall be glad if any or all of you\r\n  will remain for a better acquaintance and less formal intercourse.\r\n  [Great applause and rousing cheers for the next President.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of many delegations from other States arrived July 9, from\r\nthe city of Benton Harbor, Mich., and included many ladies. The leading\r\nmembers were F. R. Gilson, Ambrose H. Rowe, Wm. S. Farmer, G. M.\r\nValentines, W. B. Shanklin, E. M. Elick, A. J. Kidd, C. C. Sweet, O. B.\r\nHipp, R. M. Jones, W. L. Hogan, James McDonald, Allen Brunson, Frank\r\nMelton, P. W. Hall, Geo. W. Platt, W. L. McClure, J. C. Purrill, E. H.\r\nKelly, J. A. Crawford, M. J. Vincent, Dr. Boston, M. G. Kennedy, and\r\nDr. J. Bell. General L. M. Ward was spokesman for the visitors. General\r\nHarrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--This visit is exceptional in some of its features.\r\n  Already, in the brief time since my nomination, I have received\r\n  various delegations, but this is the first delegation that has\r\n  visited me from outside the borders of my own State. Your visit is\r\n  also exceptional and very gratifying in that you have brought with\r\n  you the ladies of your families to grace the occasion and to honor me\r\n  by their presence. I am glad to know that while the result of the\r\n  convention at Chicago brought disappointment to you, it has not left\r\n  any sores that need the ointment of time for their healing. Your own\r\n  favored citizen, distinguished civilian, and brave soldier, General\r\n  Alger, was among the first and among the most cordial to extend to me\r\n  his congratulations and the assurance of his earnest support in the\r\n  campaign. I am sure it cannot be otherwise than that the Republicans\r\n  of Michigan will take a deep interest in this campaign; an interest\r\n  that altogether oversteps all personal attachments. Your State has\r\n  been proudly associated with the past successes of the Republican\r\n  party, and your interests are now closely identified with its success\r\n  in the pending campaign. I am sure, therefore, that I may accept your\r\n  presence here to-night not only as a personal compliment, but as a\r\n  pledge that Michigan will be true again to those great principles of\r\n  government which are represented by the Republican party. We cherish\r\n  the history of our party and are proud of its high achievements; they\r\n  stir the enthusiasm of the young and crown those who were early in its\r\n  ranks with well-deserved laurels. The success of the Republican party\r\n  has always been identified with the glory of the flag and the unity of\r\n  the Government. There has been nothing in the history or principles\r\n  of our party out of line with revolutionary memories or with the\r\n  enlightened statesmanship of the framers of our Constitution. Those\r\n  principles are greater than men, lasting as truth, and sure of final\r\n  vindication and triumph. Let me thank you again for your visit, and\r\n  ask introduction to each of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison received four delegations this day. The first was a\r\ncommittee of veterans from John A. Logan Post, No. 99, G. A. R., of\r\nNorth Manchester, Wabash County, who came to invite the General to\r\nattend a soldiers' reunion for Northern Indiana. The committee comprised\r\nShelby Sexton, Senior Vice-Commander Indiana G. A. R.; John Elwood, Geo.\r\nLawrence, J. A. Brown, W. E. Thomas, I. D. Springdon, J. C. Hubbard, J.\r\nM. Jennings, E. A. Ebbinghous, L. J. Noftzger, and S. V. Hopkins. Rev.\r\nR. J. Parrott delivered the address of invitation. General Harrison\r\nresponded:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades and Gentlemen_--Your request is one that appeals to me\r\n  very strongly, and if it were single I should very promptly accede\r\n  to it, but, without being told, you will readily understand that\r\n  invitations of a kindred nature are coming to me every day, presented\r\n  by individual comrades and committees, but more frequently by written\r\n  communications.\r\n\r\n  I have felt that if I opened a door in this direction it would be\r\n  a very wide one, and I would either subject myself to the criticism\r\n  of having favored particular localities or particular organizations,\r\n  to the neglect of others having equal claims upon me, or that I\r\n  should be compelled to give to this pleasant duty--as it would be if\r\n  other duties did not crowd me--too much of my time. I am, therefore,\r\n  compelled to say to you that it will be impossible for me to accept\r\n  your invitation. But in doing this, I want to thank you for the\r\n  interest you have shown in my presence with you, and I want especially\r\n  to thank you for the spirit of comradeship which brings you here. I am\r\n  glad to know--and I have many manifestations of it--that the peculiar\r\n  position in which I am placed as a candidate of a political party\r\n  does not separate me from the cordial friendship and comradeship of\r\n  those who differ with me politically. I should greatly regret it if\r\n  it should be so. We held our opinions and fought for them when the\r\n  war was on, and we will hold them now in affectionate comradeship and\r\n  mutual respect. I thank you for your visit.\r\n\r\nThe second delegation also came from Wabash County and was under the\r\nleadership of William Hazen, Warren Bigler, James P. Ross, James E.\r\nStill, Robert Weesner, John Rodgers, Job Ridgway, and Joseph Ridgway,\r\naged 83, of Wabash City. Their spokesman was Mr. Cowgill. General\r\nHarrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Cowgill and my Wabash County Friends_--In 1860 I was first\r\n  a candidate before a convention for nomination to a public office.\r\n  Possibly some of those who are here to-day were in that convention.\r\n  Wabash County presented in the person of my friend, and afterwards\r\n  my comrade, Col. Charles Parrish, a candidate for the office which I\r\n  also sought, that of Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the\r\n  State of Indiana. We had a friendly yet earnest contest before the\r\n  convention, in which I succeeded. A little later in the campaign, as I\r\n  was attempting to render to my party the services which my nomination\r\n  seemed to imply, I visited your good county and received at your hands\r\n  a welcome so demonstrative and cordial that I have always had a warm\r\n  place in my heart for your people. I was then almost a boy in years,\r\n  and altogether a boy in public life. Since then, in campaigns in which\r\n  I have had a personal interest, and in very many more wherein I had\r\n  only the general interest that you all had, it has been my pleasure\r\n  to visit your county, and I can testify to the earnest, intelligent\r\n  and devoted republicanism of Wabash County. You have never faltered\r\n  in any of the great struggles in which the party has engaged; and I\r\n  believe you have followed your party from a high conviction that the\r\n  purposes it set before us involved the best interests of the country\r\n  that you love, and to which you owe the duty of citizens. I know how\r\n  generously you contributed to the army when your sons were called\r\n  to defend it; and I know how, since the war, you have endeavored to\r\n  preserve and to conserve those results which you fought for, and\r\n  which made us again one people, acknowledging, and I hope loving, one\r\n  flag and one Constitution. [Applause.] I want to thank you personally\r\n  for this visit, and I wish now, if it is your pleasure, to meet you\r\n  individually.\r\n\r\nBenton County, Indiana, contributed the third delegation of the day, led\r\nby H. S. Travis, Clark Cook, B. Johnson, Henry Taylor, Frank Knapp, and\r\nRobert L. Cox of Fowler. They were presented by Col. A. D. Streight.\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Streight, Fellow-citizens, and Comrades_--I am very\r\n  grateful to you for this visit, and for the cordial terms in which\r\n  your spokesman has extended to me the congratulations of my friends\r\n  of Benton County. We have men who boast that they are cosmopolitans,\r\n  citizens of the world. I prefer to say that I am an American\r\n  citizen [applause], and I freely confess that American interests\r\n  have the first place in my regard. [Applause.] This is not at all\r\n  inconsistent with the recognition of that comity between nations\r\n  which is necessary to the peace of the world. It is not inconsistent\r\n  with that philanthropy which sympathizes with human distress and\r\n  oppression the world around. We have been especially favored as an\r\n  apart nation, separated from the conflicts, jealousies, and intrigues\r\n  of European courts, with a territory embracing every feature of\r\n  climate and soil, and resources capable of supplying the wants of our\r\n  people, of developing a wholesome and gigantic national growth, and\r\n  of spreading abroad, by their full establishment here, the principles\r\n  of human liberty and free government. I do not think it inconsistent\r\n  with the philanthropy of the broadest teacher of human love that\r\n  we should first have regard for that family of which we are a part.\r\n  Here in Indiana the drill has just disclosed to us the presence of\r\n  inexhaustible quantities, in a large area of our State, of that new\r\n  fuel which has the facility of doing its own transportation, even to\r\n  the furnace door, and which leaves no residuum to be carried away\r\n  when it has done its work. This discovery has added an impulse to our\r\n  growth. It has attracted manufacturing industries from other States.\r\n  Many of our towns have received, and this city, we may hope, is yet\r\n  to receive, a great impulse in the development of their manufacturing\r\n  industries by reason of this discovery. It seems to me that when this\r\n  fuller development of our manufacturing interests, this building up of\r\n  a home market for the products of our farms, which is sure to produce\r\n  here that which has been so obvious elsewhere--a great increase in\r\n  the value of farms and farm products--is opening to us the pleasant\r\n  prospect of a rapid growth in wealth, we should be slow to abandon\r\n  that system of protective duties which looks to the promotion and\r\n  development of American industry and to the preservation of the\r\n  highest possible scale of wages for the American workman. [Applause.]\r\n  The development of our country must be on those lines that benefit\r\n  all our people. Any development that does not reach and beneficially\r\n  affect all our people is not to be desired, and cannot be progressive\r\n  or permanent.\r\n\r\n  Comrades, you still love the flag for which we fought. We are\r\n  preserved in God's providence to see the wondrous results of that\r\n  struggle in which you were engaged--a reunited country, a Constitution\r\n  whose authority is no longer disputed, a flag to which all men bow. It\r\n  has won respect at home; it should be respected by all nations of the\r\n  earth as an emblem and representative of a people desiring peace with\r\n  all men, but resolute in the determination that the rights of all our\r\n  citizens the world around shall be faithfully respected. [Applause and\r\n  cries of \"That's right!\"] I thank you again for this visit, and, if it\r\n  be your pleasure, and your committee will so arrange, I will be glad\r\n  to take you by the hand.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and largest delegation of the day came from Boone County,\r\nnumbering more than two thousand, led by Captain Brown, S. S. Heath, A.\r\nL. Howard, W. H. H. Martin, D. A. Rice, James Williamson, E. G. Darnell,\r\nD. H. Olive, and Captain Arbigas of Lebanon, the last-named veteran\r\ntotally blind.\r\n\r\nAnother contingent was commanded by David O. Mason, J. O. Hurst, J. N.\r\nHarmon, and Mr. Denny, an octogenarian, all of Zionsville. Dr. D. C.\r\nScull was orator for the visitors. General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--The magnitude of this demonstration puts us at a\r\n  disadvantage in our purpose to entertain you hospitably, as we had\r\n  designed when notified of your coming. [Cheers.] I regret that you\r\n  must stand exposed to the heat of the sun, and that I must be at the\r\n  disadvantage of speaking from this high balcony a few words of hearty\r\n  thanks. I hope it may be arranged by the committee so that I may yet\r\n  have the opportunity of speaking to you informally and individually.\r\n  I am glad to notice your quick interest in the campaign. I am sure\r\n  that that interest is stimulated by your devotion to the principles of\r\n  government which you conceive--rightly, as I believe--to be involved\r\n  in this campaign. [Applause.] I am glad to think that some of you,\r\n  veterans of a former political campaign to which your chairman has\r\n  alluded, and others of you, comrades in the great war for the Union,\r\n  come here to express some personal friendship for me. [Cheers.] But\r\n  I am sure that this campaign will be waged upon a plan altogether\r\n  above personal consideration. You are here as citizens of the State\r\n  of Indiana, proud of the great advancement the State has made since\r\n  those pioneer days when brave men from the East and South entered our\r\n  territory, blazing a pathway into the unbroken forest, upon which\r\n  civilization, intelligence, patriotism, and the love of God has walked\r\n  until we are conspicuous among the States as a community desirous of\r\n  social order, full of patriotic zeal, and pledged to the promotion of\r\n  that education which is to qualify the coming generations to discharge\r\n  honorably and well their duties to the Government which we will leave\r\n  in their hands. [Applause.] You are here also as citizens of the\r\n  United States, proud of that arch of strength that binds together\r\n  the States of this Union in one great Nation. But citizenship has\r\n  its duties as well as its privileges. The first is that we give our\r\n  energies and influence to the enactment of just, equal, and beneficent\r\n  laws. The second is like unto it--that we loyally reverence and\r\n  obey the will of the majority enacted into law, whether we are of a\r\n  majority or not [applause]; the law throws the ægis of its protection\r\n  over us all. It stands sentinel about your country homes to protect\r\n  you from violence; it comes into our more thickly populated community\r\n  and speaks its mandate for individual security and public order.\r\n  There is an open avenue through the ballot-box for the modification\r\n  or repeal of laws which are unjust or oppressive. To the law we bow\r\n  with reverence. It is the one king that commands our allegiance. We\r\n  will change our king, when his rule is oppressive, by these methods\r\n  appointed, and crown his more liberal successor. [Applause.] I thank\r\n  you again, most cordially, for this visit, and put myself in the\r\n  hands of your committee that I may have the privilege of meeting you\r\n  individually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thousand employees of the various railroads centreing at\r\nIndianapolis, organized as a Harrison and Morton Club--J. C. Finch,\r\nPresident, and A. D. Shaw, Marshal of the occasion--called on General\r\nHarrison on the night of July 13. Yardmaster Shaw was spokesman. General\r\nHarrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--Your visit is very gratifying to me, and is full\r\n  of significance and interest. If I read aright the language of\r\n  your lanterns you have signalled the Republican train to go ahead.\r\n  [Applause and cries of \"And she is going, too!\"] You have concluded\r\n  that it is freighted with the interests and hopes of the workingmen of\r\n  America, and must have the right of way. [Cheers and cries, \"That's\r\n  true!\" and \"We don't have to take water on this trip, either!\"]\r\n  The train has been inspected; you have given it your skilled and\r\n  intelligent approval; the track has been cleared and the switches\r\n  spiked down. Have I read your signals aright? [Cheers and cries of\r\n  \"You have!\" and \"There's no flat wheels under this train!\"] You\r\n  represent, I understand, every department of railroad labor--the\r\n  office, the train, the shop, the yard, and the road. You are the\r\n  responsible and intelligent agents of a vast system that, from a\r\n  rude and clumsy beginning, has grown to be as fine and well adapted\r\n  as the parts of the latest locomotive engine. The necessities and\r\n  responsibilities of the business of transportation have demanded a\r\n  body of picked men--inventive and skilful, faithful and courageous,\r\n  sober and educated--and the call has been answered, as your presence\r\n  here to night demonstrates. [Cheers.] Heroism has been found at the\r\n  throttle and the brake, as well as on the battle-field, and as well\r\n  worthy of song and marble. The trainman crushed between the platforms,\r\n  who used his last breath, not for prayer or message of love, but to\r\n  say to the panic-stricken who gathered around him, \"Put out the red\r\n  light for the other train,\" inscribed his name very high upon the\r\n  shaft where the names of the faithful and brave are written. [A voice:\r\n  \"Give him three cheers for that!\" Great and enthusiastic cheering.]\r\n\r\n  This early and very large gathering of Republican railroad men\r\n  suggests to me that you have opinions upon public questions which are\r\n  the product of your own observations and study. Some one will say that\r\n  the railroad business is a \"non-protected industry,\" because it has\r\n  to do with transportation and not with production. But I only suggest\r\n  what has already occurred to your own minds when I say that is a very\r\n  deceptive statement. You know there is a relation between the wages\r\n  of skilled and unskilled labor as truly as between the prices of two\r\n  grades of cotton cloth; that if the first is cut down, the other, too,\r\n  must come down. [Cries of \"That's just so!\"] You know, also, that if\r\n  labor is thrown out of one line or avenue, by so much the more will\r\n  the others be crowded; that any policy that transfers production from\r\n  the American to the English or German shop works an injury to all\r\n  American workmen. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  But, if it could be shown that your wages were unaffected by our\r\n  system of protective duties, I am sure that your fellowship with your\r\n  fellow toilers in other industries would lead you to desire, as I do\r\n  and always have, that our legislation may be of that sort that will\r\n  secure to them the highest possible prosperity [applause]--wages that\r\n  not only supply the necessities of life, but leave a substantial\r\n  margin for comfort and for the savings bank. No man's wages should\r\n  be so low that he cannot make provision in his days of vigor for the\r\n  incapacity of accident or the feebleness of old age. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to be assured to-night that the principles of our party\r\n  and all things affecting its candidates can be safely left to the\r\n  thoughtful consideration of the American workingmen--they will know\r\n  the truth and accept it; they will reject the false and slanderous.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  And now let me say in conclusion that my door will always be open\r\n  to any of you who may desire to talk with me about anything that\r\n  interests you or that you think will interest me. I regret that Mrs.\r\n  Harrison is prevented by a temporary sickness from joining with me in\r\n  receiving you this evening. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nA notable visit was that of two hundred and twenty members of the\r\nLincoln Club, one of the most influential political organizations of\r\nCincinnati. They were escorted by the First Regiment Band and led\r\nby their President, Hon. A. C. Horton, with Col. James I. Quinton,\r\nMarshal of the day. Among other prominent members in line were Col. Leo\r\nMarkbreit, Senator Richardson, Dr. M. M. Eaton, Hon. Fred Pfeister, W.\r\nE. Hutton, Samuel Baily, Jr., Albert Mitchell, H. M. Zeigler, B. O. M.\r\nDe Beck, W. T. Porter, Harry Probasco, John Ferinbatch, Geo. B. Fox, J.\r\nE. Strubbe, Dr. S. V. Wiseman, Joseph H. Thornton, C. H. Rockwell, Lewis\r\nWesner and Col. Moore. Hon. Drusin Wulsin, Vice-President of the club,\r\nwas the orator. General Harrison, who had been ill for two days, replied:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Wulsin and Gentlemen of the Lincoln Club of Cincinnati_--I\r\n  thank you very much for this visit, and I wish I found myself in\r\n  condition to talk to you with comfort to-night. I cannot, however,\r\n  let the occasion pass, in view of the kind terms in which you have\r\n  addressed me through your spokesman, without a word. I feel as if\r\n  these Hamilton County Republicans were my neighbors. The associations\r\n  of my early life were with that county, and of my student life largely\r\n  with the city of Cincinnati. You did not need to state to me that Ohio\r\n  supported John Sherman in the convention at Chicago [laughter] simply\r\n  to couple with it the suggestion that it was a matter of State pride\r\n  for you to do so. I have known him long and intimately. It was my good\r\n  fortune for four years to sit beside him in the Senate of the United\r\n  States. I learned there to value him as a friend and to honor him as\r\n  a statesman. There were reasons altogether wider than the State of\r\n  Ohio why you should support John Sherman in the convention. [Applause\r\n  and cries of \"Good!\" \"Good!\"] His long and faithful service to his\r\n  country and to the Republican party, his distinguished ability, his\r\n  fidelity as a citizen, all entitled him to your faithful support; and\r\n  I beg to assure you, as I have assured him both before and since the\r\n  convention, that I did not and would not, upon any consideration, have\r\n  made any attempt against him upon the Ohio delegation. [Applause.]\r\n  I have known of your club as an organization that early set the\r\n  example of perpetuating itself--an example that I rejoice to see is\r\n  being largely followed now throughout our country. If these principles\r\n  which are being urged by our party in these contests are worthy of our\r\n  campaign enthusiasm and ardor, they are worthy to be thought of and\r\n  advocated in the period of inter-campaign. They affect the business\r\n  interests of our country, and their full adoption and perpetuation,\r\n  we believe, will bring prosperity to all our individual and social\r\n  and community interests. Therefore, I think it wise that in those\r\n  times, when men's minds are more open to conviction and are readier of\r\n  access, you should press upon the attention of your neighbors through\r\n  your club organizations these principles to which you and I have given\r\n  the allegiance of our minds and the devotion of our hearts. I thank\r\n  you again for this visit. We are glad that you have come; therefore, I\r\n  welcome you, not only as Republicans, but as friends. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoward County sent a delegation of six hundred citizens this day, led\r\nby Major A. N. Grant. The Lincoln League Club of Kokomo was commanded\r\nby its President, John E. Moore. Other prominent citizens in the\r\ndelegation were Hon. J. N. Loop, J. A. Kautz, J. E. Vaile, John Ingalls,\r\nW. E. Blackledge, B. B. Johnson, J. B. Landen, Dr. James Wright, H.\r\nE. McMonigal, Edward Klum, Charles Pickett, and A. R. Ellis. Rev.\r\nFather Rayburn, a voter in the campaign of 1840, was spokesman. General\r\nHarrison, in reply, said:\r\n\r\n  _Father Rayburn and my Howard County Friends_--I think I may accept\r\n  this demonstration as evidence that the action of the Republican\r\n  convention at Chicago has been accepted with resignation by the\r\n  Republicans of Howard County. [Loud cheers.] You are the favored\r\n  citizens of a favored county. Your county has been conspicuous among\r\n  the counties of this State for its enterprise and intelligence. You\r\n  have been favored with a kindly and generous soil, cultivated by an\r\n  intelligent and educated class of farmers. Hitherto you have chiefly\r\n  drawn your wealth from the soil. You have had in the city of Kokomo\r\n  an enterprising and thrifty county town. You have been conspicuous\r\n  for your interest and devotion to the cause of education--for your\r\n  interest in bringing forward the coming generations well equipped for\r\n  the duties of citizenship. I congratulate you to-day that a new era of\r\n  prosperity has opened for your county in the discovery of this new and\r\n  free fuel to which Mr. Rayburn has alluded. A source of great wealth\r\n  has been opened to your people. You have already begun to realize what\r\n  it is to your county, though your expectations have hardly grasped\r\n  what it will be when the city of Kokomo and your other towns have\r\n  reached the full development which will follow this discovery. You\r\n  will then all realize--the citizens of that prosperous place as well\r\n  as the farmers throughout the county--the advantage of having a home\r\n  market for the products of your farms. [Cheers.] You may not notice\r\n  this so much in the appreciation of the prices of the staple products\r\n  of your farms, but you will notice it in the expansion of the market\r\n  for those more perishable products which cannot reach a distant market\r\n  and must be consumed near home. Is it not, then, time for you, as\r\n  thoughtful citizens, whatever your previous political affiliations\r\n  may have been, to consider the question, \"What legislation will most\r\n  promote the development of the manufacturing interests of your county\r\n  and enlarge the home market for the products of your farm?\" I shall\r\n  not enter upon a discussion of this question; it is enough to state\r\n  it, and leave it to your own intelligent consideration. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you again for this kindly visit, and beg you to excuse\r\n  any more extended remarks, and to give me now an opportunity of\r\n  thanking each of you personally for the kind things your chairman has\r\n  said in your behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllinois sent three large delegations this date from Springfield,\r\nJacksonville and Monticello. Conspicuous in the column was the famous\r\n\"Black Eagle\" Club of Springfield, led by its President, Sam H. Jones,\r\nand the Lincoln Club, commanded by Capt. John C. Cook.\r\n\r\nIn the Springfield delegation were twenty-one original Whigs who\r\nvoted for Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison, among them Jeriah Bonham, who\r\nwrote the first editorial--Nov. 8, 1858--proposing the candidacy of\r\nAbraham Lincoln for President. Others among the prominent visitors\r\nfrom Springfield were: Col. James T. King, C. A. Vaughan, Major James\r\nA. Connelly, Paul Selby, Hon. David T. Littler, Jacob Wheeler, Gen.\r\nCharles W. Pavey, Robert J. Oglesby, Ira Knight, C. P. Baldwin, James H.\r\nKellogg, Alexander Smith, Geo. Jameson, Augustus C. Ayers, Jacob Strong,\r\nDr. F. C. Winslow, Fred Smith, Charles T. Hawks, Hon. Henry Dement, Col.\r\nTheo. Ewert, Jacob Bunn, J. C. Matthews, J. R. Stewart, H. W. Beecher,\r\nAndrew J. Lester, Dr. Gurney, and Howes Yates, brother of the great war\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThe Jacksonville visitors were represented by Hon. Fred H. Rowe,\r\nex-Mayor Tomlinson, Judge T. B. Orear, J. B. Stevenson, Dr. Goodrich,\r\nProfessor Parr of Illinois College, J. W. Davenport, and Thomas Rapp.\r\n\r\nAttorney-General Hunt spoke on behalf of all the visitors. General\r\nHarrison's reply was one of his happiest speeches. He said:\r\n\r\n  _General Hunt and my Illinois Friends_--I thank you for this cordial\r\n  expression of your interest in Republican success. I thank you for the\r\n  kindly terms in which your spokesman has conveyed to me the assurance,\r\n  not only of your political support, but of your personal confidence\r\n  and respect.\r\n\r\n  The States of Indiana and Illinois are neighbors, geographically.\r\n  The river that for a portion of its length constitutes the boundary\r\n  between our States is not a river of division. Its tendency seems\r\n  to be, in these times when so many things are \"going dry\" [cheers],\r\n  rather to obliterate than to enlarge the obstruction between us.\r\n  [Cheers.] But I rejoice to know that we are not only geographically\r\n  neighbors, but that Indiana and Illinois have been neighborly in the\r\n  high sentiments and purposes which have characterized their people.\r\n  I rejoice to know that the same high spirit of loyalty and devotion\r\n  to the country that characterized the State of Illinois in the time\r\n  when the Nation made its appeal to the brave men of all the States to\r\n  rescue its flag and its Constitution from the insurrection which had\r\n  been raised against them was equally characteristic of Indiana--that\r\n  the same great impulse swept over your State that swept over\r\n  ours--that Richard Yates of Illinois [cheers] and Oliver P. Morton of\r\n  Indiana [prolonged cheers] stood together in the fullest sympathy and\r\n  co-operation in the great plans they devised to augment and re-enforce\r\n  the Union armies in the field and to suppress and put down treasonable\r\n  conspiracies at home.\r\n\r\n  As Americans and as Republicans we are glad that Illinois has\r\n  contributed so many and such conspicuous names to that galaxy of\r\n  great Americans and great Republicans whose deeds have been written\r\n  on the scroll of eternal fame. I recall that it was on the soil of\r\n  Illinois that Lovejoy died--a martyr to free speech. [Cries of \"Hear!\"\r\n  \"Hear!\"] He was the forerunner of Abraham Lincoln. He died, but his\r\n  protest against human slavery lived. Another great epoch in the march\r\n  of liberty found on the soil of Illinois the theatre of its most\r\n  influential event. I refer to that high debate in the presence of your\r\n  people, but before the world, in which Douglas won the senatorship and\r\n  Lincoln the presidency and immortal fame. [Loud cheers.]\r\n\r\n  But Lincoln's argument and Lincoln's proclamation must be made good\r\n  upon the battle-field--and again your State was conspicuous. You gave\r\n  us Grant and Logan [prolonged cheers] and a multitude of less notable,\r\n  but not less faithful, soldiers who underwrote the proclamation with\r\n  their swords. [Cheers.] I congratulate you to-day that there has\r\n  come out of this early agitation--out of the work of Lovejoy, the\r\n  disturber; out of the great debate of 1858, and out of the war for\r\n  the Union, a Nation without a slave [cheers]--that not the shackles\r\n  of slavery only have been broken, but that the scarcely less cruel\r\n  shackles of prejudice which bound every black man in the North have\r\n  also been unbound.\r\n\r\n  We are glad to know that the enlightened sentiment of the South\r\n  to-day unites with us in our congratulations that slavery has been\r\n  abolished. They have come to realize, and many of their best and\r\n  greatest men to publicly express, the thought that the abolition of\r\n  slavery has opened a gateway of progress and material development to\r\n  the South that was forever closed against her people while domestic\r\n  slavery existed.\r\n\r\n  We send them the assurance that we desire the streams of their\r\n  prosperity shall flow bank full. We would lay upon their people no\r\n  burdens that we do not willingly bear ourselves. They will not think\r\n  it amiss if I say that the burden which rests willingly upon our\r\n  shoulders is a faithful obedience to the Constitution and the laws.\r\n  A manly assertion by each of his individual rights, and a manly\r\n  concession of equal right to every other man, is the boast and the law\r\n  of good citizenship.\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you again and ask you to excuse me from further\r\n  public speech. I now ask an opportunity to meet my Illinois friends\r\n  personally [Loud and prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe second speech of the day was delivered at 9 o'clock at night to an\r\nenthusiastic delegation of fifteen hundred Republicans from Shelbyville,\r\nShelby County, led by Hon. H. C. Gordon, J. Walter Elliott, C. H.\r\nCampbell, James T. Caughey, C. X. Matthews, J. Richey, E. S. Powell,\r\nE. E. Elliott, L. S. Limpus, Orland Young, and Norris Winterowd. Judge\r\nJ. C. Adams was their spokesman. General Harrison touched upon civil\r\nservice; he said:\r\n\r\n  _Judge Adams and my Shelby County Friends_--This is only a new\r\n  evidence of your old friendliness. My association with the Republicans\r\n  of Shelby County began in 1855, when I was a very young man and\r\n  a still younger politician. In that year, if I recollect right,\r\n  I canvassed every township of your county in the interest of Mr.\r\n  Campbell, who was then a candidate for County Clerk. Since then I have\r\n  frequently visited your county, and have always been received with the\r\n  most demonstrative evidence of your friendship. But in addition to\r\n  these political associations, which have given me an opportunity to\r\n  observe and to admire the steadfastness, the courage, the unflinching\r\n  faithfulness of the Republicans of Shelby County [cheers], I have\r\n  another association with your county, which I cherish with great\r\n  tenderness and affection. Two companies of the Seventieth Indiana were\r\n  made up of your brave boys: Company B, commanded by Captain Sleeth,\r\n  and Company F, commanded by Captain Endsley, who still lives among\r\n  you. [Cheers.] Many of the surviving members of these companies still\r\n  dwell among you. Many others are in the far West, and they, too, from\r\n  their distant homes have sent me a comrade's greeting. I recollect\r\n  a little story of Peach Tree Creek that may interest you. When the\r\n  Seventieth Indiana, then under command of Col. Sam Merrill, swung\r\n  up from the reserve into the front line to meet the enemy's charge,\r\n  the adjutant-general of the brigade, who had been directed to order\r\n  the advance, reported that the left of the Seventieth Indiana was\r\n  exposed. He said he had ordered the bluff old captain of Company F,\r\n  who was commanding the left wing, to reserve his left in order to\r\n  cover his flank, but that the old hickory had answered him with an\r\n  expletive--which I have no doubt he has repented of--that he \"could\r\n  not see it,\" that he proposed that his end of the regiment should get\r\n  to the top of that hill as quick as the other end. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We will venerate the memory of the dead of these companies and their\r\n  associate companies in other commands who gave up their lives in\r\n  defence of the flag.\r\n\r\n  But I turn aside from these matters of personal recollection to\r\n  say a word of more general concern. We are now at the opening of a\r\n  presidential campaign, and I beg to suggest to you, as citizens of\r\n  the State of Indiana, that there is always in such campaigns a danger\r\n  to be avoided, viz. That the citizen may overlook the important\r\n  local and State interests which are also involved in the campaign. I\r\n  beg, therefore, to suggest that you turn your minds not only to the\r\n  consideration of the questions connected with the national legislation\r\n  and national administration, but that you think deeply and well of\r\n  those things that concern our local affairs. There are some such now\r\n  presented to you that have to do with the honor and prosperity of the\r\n  State.\r\n\r\n  There are some questions that ought not to divide parties, but\r\n  upon which all good men ought to agree. I speak of only one.\r\n  The great benevolent institutions--the fruit of our Christian\r\n  civilization--endowed by the bounty of the State, maintained by public\r\n  taxes, and intended for the care and education of the disabled classes\r\n  of our community, ought to be lifted above all party influences,\r\n  benefit or control. [Cheers.] I believe you can do nothing that will\r\n  more greatly enhance the estimation in which the State of Indiana\r\n  is held by her sister States than to see to it that a suitable,\r\n  well-regulated, and strict civil service is provided for the\r\n  administration of the benevolent and penal institutions of the State\r\n  of Indiana. I will not talk longer; I thank you for this magnificent\r\n  evidence that I am still held in kindly regard by the Republicans of\r\n  Shelby County, and bid you good-night. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of July Champaign County, Illinois, contributed a\r\nlarge delegation under the direction of Hon. F. K. Robeson, Z. Riley,\r\nH. W. Mahan, and W. M. Whindley. Their parade was conspicuous for the\r\nnumber of log-cabins, cider-barrels, coons, eagles, and other campaign\r\nemblems.\r\n\r\nProminent members of the delegation were Rev. I. S. Mahan, H. M.\r\nDunlap, F. M. McKay, J. J. McClain, James Barnes, Rev. John Henry, H.\r\nS. Clark, M. S. Goodrich, A. W. McNichols, Capt. J. H. Sands and three\r\nveterans of 1836, the Rev. S. K. Reed, Stephen Freeman, and W. B.\r\nDowning. Hon. Frank M. Wright delivered the address on behalf of the\r\nvisitors. General Harrison responded:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I feel very conscious of the compliment which is\r\n  conveyed by your presence here to-day. You come as citizens of an\r\n  adjoining State to manifest, as your spokesman has said, some personal\r\n  respect for me, but much more, I think--your interest in the pending\r\n  contention of principles before the people of the United States. It\r\n  is fortunate that you are allowed, not only to express your interest\r\n  by such popular gatherings as these, but that you will be called upon\r\n  individually, after the debate is over, to settle this contention by\r\n  your ballots. An American political canvass, when we look through the\r\n  noise and tinsel that accompanies it, presents a scene of profound\r\n  interest to the student of government. The theory upon which our\r\n  Government is builded is that every qualified elector shall have an\r\n  equal influence at the ballot-box with every other. Our Constitutions\r\n  do not recognize fractional votes; they do not recognize the right\r\n  of one man to count one and a half in the determination of public\r\n  questions. It is wisely provided that whatever differences may exist\r\n  in intelligence, in wealth, or in any other respect, at the ballot-box\r\n  there shall be absolute equality. No interest can be truly subserved,\r\n  whether local or general, by any invasion of this great principle.\r\n  The wise work of our fathers in constructing this Government will\r\n  stand all tests of internal dissension and revolution, and all tests\r\n  of external assault, if we can only preserve a pure, free ballot.\r\n  [Applause.] Every citizen who is a patriot ought to lend his influence\r\n  to that end, by promoting necessary reforms in our election laws and\r\n  by a watchful supervision of the processes of our popular elections.\r\n  We ought to elevate in thought and practice the free suffrage that\r\n  we enjoy. As long as it shall be held by our people to be the jewel\r\n  above price, as long as each for himself shall claim its free exercise\r\n  and shall generously and manfully insist upon an equally free\r\n  exercise of it by every other man, our Government will be preserved\r\n  and our development will not find its climax until the purpose of\r\n  God in establishing this Government shall have spread throughout the\r\n  world--governments \"of the people, by the people, and for the people.\"\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  You will not expect, nor would it be proper, that I should follow\r\n  the line of your spokesman's remarks, or even allude to some things\r\n  that he has alluded to; but I will not close without one word of\r\n  compliment and comradeship for the soldiers of Illinois. [Applause.]\r\n  I do not forget that many of them, like Logan--that fearless and\r\n  first of volunteer soldiers--at the beginning of the war were not\r\n  in sympathy with the Republican national administration. You had a\r\n  multitude of soldiers besides Logan, one of whom has been immortalized\r\n  in poetry--Sergeant Tillman Joy--who put their politics by \"to keep\r\n  till the war was through;\" and many, I may add, like Logan, when they\r\n  got home found new party associations. But we do not limit our praise\r\n  of the loyalty and faithfulness of your soldiers to any party lines,\r\n  for we realize that there were good soldiers who did resume their\r\n  ante-war politics when they came back from the army. To such we extend\r\n  a comrade's hand always, and the free and untrammelled exercise of his\r\n  political choice shall not bar our comradeship. It happened during the\r\n  war that three Illinois regiments were for some time under my command.\r\n  I had opportunity to observe their perfection in drill, their orderly\r\n  administration of camp duties, and, above all, the brilliant courage\r\n  with which they met the enemy. And, in complimenting them, I take\r\n  them as the type of that great army that Illinois sent out for the\r\n  preservation of the Union and the Constitution. Let me thank you again\r\n  for your friendly visit to-day; and if any of you desire a nearer\r\n  acquaintance, I shall be glad to make that acquaintance now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo thousand visitors from Edgar and Coles counties, Illinois, paid\r\ntheir respects to the Republican nominee this day.\r\n\r\nThe excursion was under the auspices of the John A. Logan Club of Paris,\r\nCharles P. Fitch, President. There were many farmers in the delegation,\r\nalso eighty-two veterans of the campaign of 1840, and the watchwords\r\nof the day were \"Old Tippecanoe and young Tippecanoe.\" The reception\r\ntook place at University Park, notable from this time forward for many\r\nsimilar events. Prominent among the visitors were Geo. F. Howard, Capt.\r\nF. M. Rude, J. W. Howell, E. R. Lodge, Capt. J. C. Bessier, M. Hackett,\r\nJames Stewart, and Mayor J. M. Bell of Paris; C. G. Peck and J. H. Clark\r\nof Mattoon; and Hon. John W. Custor of Benton. State Senator George E.\r\nBacon delivered the congratulatory address. General Harrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Senator Bacon and my Illinois Friends_--Some of my home friends\r\n  have been concerned lest I should be worn out by the frequent coming\r\n  of these delegations. I am satisfied from what I see before me\r\n  to-day that the rest of Illinois is here [laughter], and the concern\r\n  of my friends will no longer be excited by the coming of Illinois\r\n  delegations. [A voice, \"We are all here!\"] That you should leave the\r\n  pursuits of your daily life--the farm, the office, and the shop--to\r\n  make this journey gives me the most satisfactory evidence that your\r\n  hearts are enlisted in this campaign. I am glad to welcome here to-day\r\n  the John A. Logan Club of Paris. You have chosen a name that you will\r\n  not need to drop, whatever mutations may come in politics, so long as\r\n  there shall be a party devoted to the flag and to the Constitution,\r\n  and pledged to preserve the memories of the great deeds of those who\r\n  died that the Constitution might be preserved and the flag honored.\r\n  [Applause.] General Logan was indeed, as your spokesman has said, \"the\r\n  typical volunteer soldier.\" With him loyalty was not a sentiment; it\r\n  was a passion that possessed his whole nature.\r\n\r\n  When the civil war broke out no one did more than he to solidify\r\n  the North in defence of the Government. He it was who said that all\r\n  parties and all platforms must be subordinated to the defence of the\r\n  Government against unprovoked assault. [A voice, \"That's just what\r\n  he said!\"] In the war with Mexico, as a member of the First Illinois\r\n  Regiment, and afterwards as the commander of the Thirty-first Illinois\r\n  in the civil war, he gave a conspicuous example of what an untrained\r\n  citizen could do in the time of public peril. In the early fight at\r\n  Donelson he, with the First Illinois Brigade, successfully resisted\r\n  the desperate assaults that were made upon his line; twice wounded, he\r\n  yet refused to leave the field. The courage of that gallant brigade\r\n  called forth from a Massachusetts poet the familiar lines:\r\n\r\n          \"Thy proudest mother's eyelids fill,\r\n            As dares her gallant boy,\r\n          And Plymouth Rock and Bunker Hill\r\n            Yearn to thee, Illinois.\"\r\n\r\n  [Applause.] He commanded successively brigades, divisions, corps\r\n  and armies, and fought them with unvarying success. I greet these\r\n  veterans of the campaign of 1840. You recall the pioneer days, the\r\n  log cabin days of the West, the days when muddy highways were the\r\n  only avenues of travel and commerce. You have seen a marvellous\r\n  development. The State of your adoption has become a mighty\r\n  commonwealth; you have seen it crossed and recrossed by railroads,\r\n  bringing all your farms into easy communication with distant\r\n  markets; you have seen the schoolhouse and church brought into every\r\n  neighborhood; you have seen this country rocked in the cradle of war;\r\n  you have seen it emerge from that dreadful trial and enter upon an era\r\n  of prosperity that seems to surpass all that had gone before.\r\n\r\n  To these young men who will, for the first time this year, take part\r\n  as citizens in determining a presidential election, I suggest that\r\n  you have become members of a party of precious memories. There has\r\n  been nothing in the history of the Republican party, nothing in the\r\n  platform of principles that it has proclaimed, that is not calculated\r\n  to stir the high impulses of your young hearts. The Republican party\r\n  has walked upon high paths. It has set before it ever the maintenance\r\n  of the Union, the honor of its flag, and the prosperity of our people.\r\n  It has been an American party [great cheering] in that it has set\r\n  American interests always to the front.\r\n\r\n  My friends of the colored organization, I greet you as Republicans\r\n  to-day. I recall the time when you were disfranchised; when your race\r\n  were slaves; when the doors of our institutions of learning were\r\n  closed against you, and even admittance to many of our Northern States\r\n  was denied you. You have read the story of your disfranchisement, of\r\n  the restoration to you of the common rights of men. Read it again;\r\n  read the story of the bitter and bigoted opposition that every statute\r\n  and constitutional amendment framed for your benefit encountered. What\r\n  party befriended you when you needed friends? What party has stood\r\n  always as an obstruction to the development and enlargement of your\r\n  rights as citizens? When you have studied these questions well you\r\n  will be able to determine not only where your gratitude is due, but\r\n  where the hopes of your race lie. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Clay County, Indiana, came three thousand coal-miners and others,\r\nthis day, under the auspices of the Harrison Miners' Club of Brazil.\r\nTheir parade, with dozens of unique banners and devices, was one of\r\nthe most imposing of the campaign. Prominent in the delegation were\r\nDr. Joseph C. Gifford, L. A. Wolfe, Jacob Herr, P. H. Penna, John F.\r\nPerry, C. P. Eppert, E. C. Callihan, W. H. Lowery, Rev. John Cox, A. F.\r\nBridges, William Sporr, Carl Thomas, Geo. F. Fuller, John Gibbons, Sam'l\r\nBlair, Thomas Washington, and Judge Coffey of Brazil. Major William\r\nCarter and Edward Wilton, a miner, delivered addresses; Rob't L. McCowan\r\nspoke for the colored members of the delegation. General Harrison, in\r\nresponse, said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen and Friends from Clay County_--I thank you for this\r\n  enthusiastic demonstration of your interest. I am glad to be assured\r\n  by those who have spoken for you to-day that you have brought here,\r\n  and desire to evidence, some personal respect for me; but this\r\n  demonstration has relation, I am sure, rather to principles than to\r\n  men. You come as representatives of the diversified interests of\r\n  your county. You are fortunate in already possessing diversified\r\n  industries. You have not only agriculture, but the mine and factory\r\n  which provide a home market for the products of your farms. You come\r\n  here, as I understand, from all these pursuits, to declare that in\r\n  your opinion your interests, as farmers, as miners, as mechanics,\r\n  as tradesmen, are identified with the maintenance of the doctrine\r\n  of protection to American industries, and the preservation of the\r\n  American market for American products. [Cheers.] Some resort to\r\n  statistics to show that the condition of the American workman is\r\n  better than that of the workman of any other country. I do not care\r\n  now to deal with statistics. One fact is enough for me. The tide of\r\n  emigration from all European countries has been and is towards our\r\n  shores. The gates of Castle Garden swing inward. They do not swing\r\n  outward to any American laborer seeking a better country than this.\r\n  [Cries of \"Never!\"]\r\n\r\n  My countrymen, these men, who have toiled at wages in other lands\r\n  that barely sustained life, and opened no avenue of promise to them or\r\n  to their children, know the good land of hope as well as the swallow\r\n  knows the land of summer. [Applause.] They testify that here there\r\n  are better conditions, wider and more hopeful prospects for workmen\r\n  than in any other land. The next suggestion I have to make is this:\r\n  that the more work there is to do in this country the higher the\r\n  wages that will be paid for the doing of it. [Applause.] I speak to\r\n  men who know that when the product of their toil is in demand in the\r\n  market, when buyers are seeking it, wages advance; but when the market\r\n  for your products is depressed, and the manufacturer is begging for\r\n  buyers, then wages go down. Is it not clear, then, that that policy\r\n  which secures the largest amount of work to be done at home is the\r\n  policy which will secure to laboring men steady employment and the\r\n  best wages? [Cheers and cries of \"That is right!\"] A policy which will\r\n  transfer work from our mines and our factories to foreign mines and\r\n  foreign factories inevitably tends to the depression of wages here.\r\n  [Applause and cries of \"That is true!\"] These are truths that do not\r\n  require profound study.\r\n\r\n  Having here a land that throws about the workingman social and\r\n  political conditions more favorable than are found elsewhere, if we\r\n  can preserve also more favorable industrial conditions we shall secure\r\n  the highest interests of our working classes. [Great cheering.] What,\r\n  after all, is the best evidence of a nation's prosperity, and the\r\n  best guarantee of social order, if it is not an intelligent, thrifty,\r\n  contented working class? Can we look for contentment if the workman\r\n  is only able to supply his daily necessities by his daily toil, but\r\n  is not able in the vigor of youth to lay up a store against old age?\r\n  A condition of things that compels the laborer to contemplate want,\r\n  as an incident of sickness or disability, is one that tends to social\r\n  disorder. [Applause and cries of \"That is so!\"] You are called upon\r\n  now to consider these problems. I will not debate them in detail,\r\n  others will. I can only commend them to your thoughtful consideration.\r\n  Think upon them; conclude for yourselves what policy as to our tariff\r\n  legislation will best subserve your interests, the interests of your\r\n  families, and the greatness and glory of the Nation of which you are\r\n  citizens. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  My colored friends who are here to-day, the emancipation of the\r\n  slave removed from our country that which tended to degrade labor. All\r\n  men are now free; you are thrown upon your own resources; the avenues\r\n  of intelligence and of business success are open to all. I notice\r\n  that the party to which we belong has been recently reproached by the\r\n  suggestion that we have not thoroughly protected the colored man in\r\n  the South. This has been urged as a reason why the colored people\r\n  should join the Democratic party. I beg the gentlemen who urge that\r\n  plea to answer this question: Against whom is it that the Republican\r\n  party has been unable, as you say, to protect your race? [Applause and\r\n  cries of \"Good! Good!\"] Thanking you again for this demonstration and\r\n  for your friendly expressions, I will, if it be your pleasure, drop\r\n  this formal method of communication and take my Clay County friends by\r\n  the hand. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nThe Clay County miners had not concluded their reception before a\r\ndelegation of several hundred arrived from Bloomington, Illinois,\r\nheaded by the John A. Logan Club, under the lead of General Geo. F.\r\nDick, William Maddox, John A. Fullwiller, M. B. Herr, and Dr. F. C.\r\nVandervoort. Their orator was Dr. W. H. H. Adams, formerly President of\r\nthe Illinois Wesleyan University. General Harrison, replying, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Bloomington Friends_--When I received here, yesterday, a very\r\n  large delegation from Illinois, I expressed the opinion that they\r\n  must be the \"rest of the people of Illinois that had not been here\r\n  before.\" I suppose you are a remnant that could not get into line\r\n  yesterday. I thank you as I have thanked those who preceded you, for\r\n  the interest which the people of your State have manifested, and\r\n  for your cordial fellowship with Indiana. I will not discuss the\r\n  issues of the campaign. You have already thought upon the platforms\r\n  of the two parties. Some of you have perhaps taken your politics by\r\n  inheritance. It is now a good time to review the situation. We have\r\n  the same interests as citizens. Let us all consider the history and\r\n  declarations of the great parties and thoughtfully conclude which is\r\n  more likely to promote the general interests of our people. That is\r\n  the test. The British Parliament does not legislate with a view to\r\n  advance the interests of the people of the United States. [Cries of\r\n  \"No, never!\"] They--rightly--have in view the interest of that empire\r\n  over which Victoria reigns. Should we not, also, as Americans, in our\r\n  legislation, consider first the interests of our people? We invite\r\n  the thoughtful attention of those who have hitherto differed with us\r\n  as to these questions. Our interests are bound together. That which\r\n  promotes the prosperity of the community in which you dwell in kindly\r\n  association with your Democratic friends promotes your interests and\r\n  theirs alike. Thanking you for this visit, I will ask you to excuse me\r\n  from further speech. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nKosciusko County, Indiana, contributed two thousand visitors on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of July, under the leadership of Capt. C. W. Chapman,\r\nJames H. Cisney, Reub. Williams, Louis Ripple, J. E. Stevenson, Wm.\r\nB. Wood, T. Loveday, John Wynant, Charles Adams, Nelson Richhart,\r\nCaptain A. S. Miller, Clinton Lowe, P. L. Runyon, James A. Cook, Frank\r\nMcGee, and John Burbaker, all of Warsaw. Judge H. S. Biggs made the\r\npresentation address. General Harrison replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Biggs and my Kosciusko County Friends_--I did not need to be\r\n  assured of the friendliness of the Republicans of your county. It has\r\n  been evidenced too many times in the past. Before the convention at\r\n  Chicago the Republicans of your county gave me the assurance that my\r\n  nomination would meet the cordial approbation of your people. I am\r\n  glad to welcome you here to-day, and regret that your journey hither\r\n  has been so tedious. You are proud of the State in which you dwell;\r\n  proud of her institutions of learning; proud of her great benevolent\r\n  institutions, which I notice by one of these banners you have pledged\r\n  yourselves to protect from party spoliation and degradation. [Applause\r\n  and cries of \"Good! Good!\"] But while we have much that is cause for\r\n  congratulation, we are not enjoying that full equality of civil rights\r\n  in the State of Indiana to which we are entitled.\r\n\r\n  Our Government is a representative government. Delegates in Congress\r\n  and members of our State Senate and House of Representatives are\r\n  apportioned to districts, and the National and State Constitutions\r\n  contemplate that these districts shall be equal, so that, as far as\r\n  possible, each citizen shall have, in his district, the same potency\r\n  in choosing a Member of Congress or of our State Legislature as is\r\n  exercised by a voter in any other district. We do not to-day have that\r\n  condition of things. The apportionment of our State for legislative\r\n  and congressional purposes is unfair, and is known to be unfair to\r\n  all men. No candid Democrat can defend it as a fair apportionment. It\r\n  was framed to be unequal, it was designed to give to the citizens of\r\n  favored districts an undue influence. It was intended to discriminate\r\n  against Republicans. It is not right that it should be so. I hope the\r\n  time is coming, and has even now arrived, when the great sense of\r\n  justice which possesses our people will teach men of all parties that\r\n  party success is not to be promoted at the expense of an injustice to\r\n  any of our citizens. [Applause.] These things take hold of government.\r\n  If we would maintain that respect for the law which is necessary to\r\n  social order, our people must understand that each voter has his full\r\n  and equal influence in determining what the law shall be. I hope this\r\n  question will not be forgotten by our people until we have secured\r\n  in Indiana a fair apportionment for legislative and congressional\r\n  purposes. [Cheers.] When the Republicans shall secure the power of\r\n  making an apportionment, I hope and believe that the experiment of\r\n  seeking a party advantage by a public injustice will not be repeated.\r\n  [Great applause and cries of \"Good! Good!\"]\r\n\r\n  There are some other questions affecting suffrage, too, to which my\r\n  attention has, from circumstances, been particularly attracted. There\r\n  are in the Northwest several Territories organized under public law\r\n  with defined boundaries. They have been filled up with the elect of\r\n  our citizens--the brave, the enterprising and intelligent young men\r\n  from all the States. Many of the veterans of the late war have sought\r\n  under our beneficent homestead law new homes in the West. Several of\r\n  these Territories have been for years possessed of population, wealth,\r\n  and all the requisites for admission as States. When the Territory\r\n  of Indiana took the census which was the basis for its petition for\r\n  admission to the Union we had less than 64,000 people; we had only\r\n  thirteen organized counties. In the Territory of South Dakota there\r\n  are nearly half a million people. For years they have been knocking\r\n  for admission to the sisterhood of States.\r\n\r\n  They are possessed of all the elements of an organized and\r\n  stable community. It has more people, more miles of railroad, more\r\n  post-offices, more churches, more banks, more wealth, than any\r\n  Territory ever possessed when it was admitted to the Union. It\r\n  surpasses some of the States in these particulars. Four years ago,\r\n  when a President was to be chosen, the Committee on Territories in\r\n  the Senate, to meet the objection of our Democratic friends that the\r\n  admission of Dakota would add a disturbing element to the Electoral\r\n  College, provided in the Dakota bill that its organization should be\r\n  postponed until after the election; now four years more have rolled\r\n  around, and our people are called again to take part in a presidential\r\n  election, and the intelligent and patriotic Dakota people are again to\r\n  be deprived of any participation. I ask you why this is so? Is not the\r\n  answer obvious? [Cries of \"Yes!\"] They are disfranchised and deprived\r\n  of their appropriate influence in the Electoral College only because\r\n  the prevailing sentiment in the Territory is Republican. [Cries\r\n  of \"That's right!\" \"That's the reason!\"] The cause of Washington\r\n  Territory is more recent but no less flagrant. If we appropriately\r\n  express sympathy with the cause of Irish home rule, shall we not\r\n  also demand home rule for Dakota and Washington, and insist that\r\n  their disfranchisement shall not be prolonged? [Applause.] There is a\r\n  sense of justice, of fairness, that will assert itself against these\r\n  attempts to coin party advantage out of public wrong. The day when men\r\n  can be disfranchised or shorn of their political power for opinion's\r\n  sake must have an end in our country. [Cheers.] I thank you again for\r\n  your call, and if you will observe the arrangement which has been\r\n  suggested I will be glad to take each of you by the hand. I know that\r\n  some of you are fasting, and therefore we will shorten these exercises\r\n  in order that you may obtain needed refreshments. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nJennings County, Indiana, was represented on the above date by a large\r\ndelegation under the auspices of the Harrison and Morton Clubs of Vernon\r\nand North Vernon. The leaders of their delegation were Fred H. Nauer, J.\r\nC. Cope, C. E. Wagner, W. G. Norris, Dr. T. C. Bachelder, T. A. Pearce,\r\nP. C. McGannon, and Prof. Amos Saunders. Hon. Frank E. Little, President\r\nof the North Vernon Club, delivered the address. General Harrison, in\r\nresponse, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It is a source of regret to me that I can do so\r\n  little to compensate those who take the trouble to visit me. I need\r\n  hardly say to you that I very highly appreciate this evidence of your\r\n  friendliness and also the kind words which you have addressed to me\r\n  through your representative. Jennings County has a history of which\r\n  it may well be proud. It has contributed to the city of Indianapolis\r\n  some of our most distinguished and useful men. Your spokesman has\r\n  not exaggerated the fidelity and steadfastness of the people of your\r\n  county. Your republicanism has been as straight as the walls of your\r\n  cliffs [applause] and as solid as the limestone with which your hills\r\n  are buttressed. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  You have said to me that you are in favor of a free and equal\r\n  ballot the country over. We are so related in our Government that\r\n  any disturbance of the suffrage anywhere directly affects us all. Our\r\n  Members of Congress pass upon questions that are as wide as the domain\r\n  over which our flag floats. Therefore, our interest in the choice of\r\n  these representatives is not limited to our own districts. If the\r\n  debate upon public questions is to be of value the voter must be free\r\n  to register his conclusion. The tribunal which is to pronounce upon\r\n  the argument must not be coerced.\r\n\r\n  You have said to me that you favor the doctrine of protection. The\r\n  Republican party stands for the principles of protection. We believe\r\n  in the preservation of the American market for our American producers\r\n  and workmen. [Applause and cries of \"That's it!\"] We believe that\r\n  the development of home manufactures tends directly to promote the\r\n  interest of agriculture by furnishing a home market for the products\r\n  of the farm, and thus emancipating our farmers from the transportation\r\n  charges which they must pay when their products seek distant markets.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  We are confronted now with a Treasury surplus. Our position is\r\n  exceptional. We are not seeking, as many other nations are, new\r\n  subjects of taxation, new sources of revenue. Our quest is now how,\r\n  wisely, to reduce our national revenue. The attempt has been made to\r\n  use this surplus as a lever to overturn the protective system. The\r\n  promoters of this scheme, while professing a desire to diminish the\r\n  surplus, have acted as if their purpose was to increase it in part by\r\n  opposing necessary and legitimate appropriations. I agree that there\r\n  is danger that a surplus may promote extravagance, but I do not find\r\n  myself in sympathy with that policy that denies the appropriation\r\n  necessary for the proper defence of our people, and for the convenient\r\n  administration of our public affairs throughout the country, in order\r\n  that the threat of a surplus may be used for a sinister purpose. I\r\n  believe that in reducing our revenues to the level of our needful\r\n  and proper expenditures we can and should continue to favor and\r\n  protect our industries. I do not like to entrust this work to those\r\n  who declare protective duties to be vicious \"legalized robbery.\" The\r\n  Republican party has by its legislation shown its capacity wisely to\r\n  reduce our revenues and at the same time to preserve the American\r\n  system. [Applause.] It can be trusted to do the work that remains, and\r\n  to do it wisely. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JULY 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last delegation in July came from Henry County, Indiana, two\r\nthousand strong, headed by C. S. Hernley, W. H. Elliott, Hon. Eugene\r\nBundy, Judge Mark E. Forkner, A. Abernathy, A. D. Osborn, O. P. M.\r\nHubbard, David Luellen, O. B. Mooney, and Captain Armstrong, all of New\r\nCastle. Gen. William H. Grose was their orator.\r\n\r\nIn his response General Harrison at this early day out-lined his views\r\nupon reciprocal trade relations with South American nations--views which\r\nwere afterwards successfully, and with great profit to our people, put\r\ninto effect through the celebrated reciprocity treaties with Brazil,\r\nVenezuela and other countries.\r\n\r\nRepeated outbursts of enthusiasm punctured his address. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrade Grose and my Henry County Friends_--If we have here any\r\n  discouraged statesman who takes a despondent view of the future of the\r\n  country, I think he would recover his hopefulness if he could look,\r\n  once in a while, into the face of an audience like this. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  You came from a county that has been a bulwark of republicanism\r\n  since the party was organized. You had an early element in your\r\n  population that has done much to promote your material interests, and,\r\n  much more, to lift up those principles that relate to the purity of\r\n  the home and to the freedom of men. The Friends, who have been and\r\n  are so large and so influential an element in your population and in\r\n  the counties surrounding it, are a people notable for the purity of\r\n  their home life and for their broad and loving sympathy with all men.\r\n  They were the early enemies of slavery, and they have always naturally\r\n  been the strength of the Republican party in the community where they\r\n  reside. Your spokesman has expressed your continued interest in the\r\n  party to which some of you gave the confidence of your matured powers\r\n  and some of you the early devotion of your youth. The Republican party\r\n  has accomplished for the country a great work in the brief period of\r\n  its life. It preserved the Nation by a wise, courageous and patriotic\r\n  administration. What that means for you and your posterity, what it\r\n  means for the world, no man can tell. It would have been a climax of\r\n  disaster for the world if this Government of the people had perished.\r\n  The one unsolved experiment of free government was solved. We have\r\n  demonstrated the capacity of the people and a citizen soldiery to\r\n  maintain inviolate the unity of the Republic. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  There remain now, fortunately, chiefly economic questions to be\r\n  thought of and to be settled. We refer to the great war, not in any\r\n  spirit of hostility to any section or any class of men, but only\r\n  because we believe it to be good for the whole country that loyalty\r\n  and fidelity to the flag should be honored. [Great applause.] It was\r\n  one of the great triumphs of the war, a particular in which our war\r\n  was distinguished from all other wars of history, that we brought the\r\n  vanquished into the same full, equal citizenship under the law that we\r\n  maintained for ourselves.\r\n\r\n  In all the addresses which have been made to me there has been some\r\n  reference to the great question of the protection of our American\r\n  industries. I see it upon the banners which you carry. Our party\r\n  stands unequivocally, without evasion or qualification, for the\r\n  doctrine that the American market shall be preserved for our American\r\n  producers. [Great applause.] We are not attracted by the suggestion\r\n  that we should surrender to foreign producers the best market in the\r\n  world. Our sixty millions of people are the best buyers in the world,\r\n  and they are such because our working classes receive the best wages.\r\n  _But we do not mean to be content with our own market. We should seek\r\n  to promote closer and more friendly commercial relations with the\r\n  Central and South American States._ [Applause.] And what is essential\r\n  to that end? Regular mails are the first condition of commerce.\r\n\r\n  The merchant must know when his order will be received, and when his\r\n  consignment will be returned, or there can be no trade between distant\r\n  communities. What we need, therefore, is the establishment of American\r\n  steamship lines between our ports and the ports of Central and South\r\n  America. [Applause.] Then it will no longer be necessary that an\r\n  American minister, commissioned to an American State, shall take an\r\n  English ship to Liverpool to find another English ship to carry him to\r\n  his destination. We are not to be frightened by the use of that ugly\r\n  word \"subsidy.\" [Laughter.] We should pay to American steamship lines\r\n  a liberal compensation for carrying our mails, instead of turning them\r\n  over to British tramp steamships. [Applause.] We do not desire to\r\n  dominate these neighboring governments; we do not desire to deal with\r\n  them in any spirit of aggression. _We desire those friendly political,\r\n  mental, and commercial relations which shall promote their interests\r\n  equally with ours._ We should not longer forego those commercial\r\n  relations and advantages which our geographical relations suggest and\r\n  make so desirable. If you will excuse me from further public speech I\r\n  will be glad to take by the hand my Henry County friends. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nMr. Harrison arrived home--after the Henry County reception in\r\nUniversity Park--in time to welcome his guest, Gen. R. A. Alger of\r\nMichigan, the distinguished gentlemen meeting for the first time. In the\r\nafternoon several hundred of the Henry County visitors, escorted by the\r\nlocal clubs, marched to the Harrison residence to pay their respects to\r\nGeneral Alger.\r\n\r\nIn introducing his guest General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have had the pleasure to-day to receive\r\n  in my own home a distinguished citizen of a neighboring State;\r\n  distinguished not only for his relation to the civil administration of\r\n  affairs in his State, but also as one of those conspicuous soldiers\r\n  contributed by Michigan to the armies of the Union when our national\r\n  life was in peril. I am sure you will be glad to make broader the\r\n  welcome I have given him, and to show him that he has a warm place in\r\n  the affections of our Indiana people. Let me present to you General\r\n  Alger of Michigan. [Prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Alger responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I thank you very much for this cordial greeting. I\r\n  thank you very kindly, General Harrison, for the pleasant words you\r\n  have said of me personally. I wish to say--as you would know if you\r\n  lived in Michigan--that I am not a speechmaker. I composed a few\r\n  speeches some weeks ago, and General Harrison has been delivering them\r\n  ever since. [Laughter.] After reading his speeches carefully, each\r\n  one of them a gem of concentrated thought, I have made up my mind\r\n  that the Chicago Convention made no mistake. [Applause.] We have not\r\n  held any _post-mortem_ in our State. We are glad that we have such a\r\n  gallant candidate, a man in whose composition no flaw can be found,\r\n  in whose life no act or word can be adversely criticised. We are as\r\n  proud in Michigan of your candidate--who is our candidate also--as we\r\n  could possibly be were any other man in the universe named. We are all\r\n  Harrison men in Michigan now; and the place he has in our hearts is\r\n  just as warm as though he lived within our own borders. [Applause.]\r\n  You Hoosiers have no patent upon this. [Applause.] The people of the\r\n  United States have a great crisis before them. The question as to the\r\n  life and prosperity of our industrial institutions is at stake. We\r\n  have, as we have always had, since this country was worth caring for,\r\n  the opposition of the English Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe month of August opened with two thousand visitors from Morgan and\r\nBrown counties, including thirty survivors of General Harrison's former\r\nregiment. The several clubs comprising the Brown County delegation were\r\nled by Norman J. Roberts, Leander Woods, Wm. Griffin, E. D. Turner, and\r\nC. W. Mackenzie of Nashville.\r\n\r\nProminent in the Morgan County detachment were W. W. Kennedy, W. C.\r\nBanta, John Hardwick, M. G. Branch, David Wilson, H. C. Hodges, R. C.\r\nGriffitt, J. G. Bain, John S. Newby, J. G. Kennedy, U. M. Hinson, Merwin\r\nRowe, Hon. J. H. Jordan, H. R. Butler, W. C. Barnett, John C. Comer,\r\nGeo. Mitchell, and J. I. Hilton of Martinsville. Hon. G. A. Adams spoke\r\nfor the visitors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Adams and my Morgan and Brown County Friends_--In previous\r\n  campaigns I have not put you to the trouble to come and see me. My\r\n  habit has been to go to you, and it has been my pleasure often to\r\n  discuss before you the issues that were involved in our campaigns. The\r\n  limitations which are upon me now prevent me from following this old\r\n  habit, and put you, who desire to see me, to the trouble of coming\r\n  here. My associations with the county of Morgan have been very close.\r\n  Among its citizens are some of my most devoted personal and political\r\n  friends. There are also in your county a large number of my comrades,\r\n  to whom I am bound by the very close ties that must always unite those\r\n  who marched under the same regimental banner. Your county furnished\r\n  two companies for the Seventieth Indiana--brave, true men, commanded\r\n  by intelligent and capable officers, and having in the ranks of both\r\n  companies men as capable of command as any who wore shoulder-straps\r\n  in the regiment. These men, together with their comrades of the\r\n  Thirty-third and other regiments that were recruited in your county,\r\n  went into the service from very high motives. They heard the call of\r\n  their country, saying: \"He that loveth father or mother or wife or\r\n  child or houses or lands more than me is not worthy of me,\" and they\r\n  were found worthy by this supreme test. Many of you were so careless\r\n  of a money recompense for the service you offered and gave that when\r\n  you lifted your hands and swore to protect and defend the Constitution\r\n  and the flag you didn't even know what your pay was to be. [Cries\r\n  of \"That's so!\"] If there was any carefulness or thought in that\r\n  direction it was only that the necessary provision might be made for\r\n  those you left at home. No sordid impulse, no low emotion, called you\r\n  to the field. [Applause.] In remembering all the painful ways in which\r\n  you walked, ways of toil, and suffering, and sickness, and dying, to\r\n  emerge into the glorious sunlight of that great day at Washington, we\r\n  must not forget that in the homes you left there were also sacrifices\r\n  and sufferings. Anxiety dwelt perpetually with those you left behind.\r\n  We remember gratefully the sacrifices and sufferings of the fathers\r\n  and mothers who sent you to the field, and, much more, of the wives\r\n  who bravely gave up to the country the most cherished objects of their\r\n  love. And now peace has come; no hand is lifted against the flag; the\r\n  Constitution is again supreme and the Nation one. My countrymen, it is\r\n  no time now to use an apothecary's scale to weigh the rewards of the\r\n  men who saved the country. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  If you will pardon me I will not further follow the line of remarks\r\n  suggested by the kind words you have addressed to me through your\r\n  representative. I notice the limitation which your spokesman has put\r\n  upon you, but I beg to assure him and you that I am not so worn that I\r\n  have not the strength to greet any of you who may desire to greet me.\r\n  [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third of August, with the mercury registering ninety-nine\r\ndegrees, thirty-five hundred visitors arrived from Montgomery and\r\nClinton counties, Indiana. Their parade, carrying miniature log-cabins\r\nand other emblems, was one of the most enthusiastic demonstrations of\r\nthe campaign. Fifty voters of 1840 headed the column led by Major D.\r\nK. Price, aged 92. The Montgomery County delegation was marshalled by\r\nJohn H. Burford, W. W. Thornton, T. H. B. McCain, John S. Brown, E. P.\r\nMcClarkey, John Johnson, J. R. Bonnell, D. W. Roundtree, T. H. Ristine,\r\nH. M. Billingsley, Dumont Kennedy, and Clerk Hulett of Crawfordsville.\r\nTheir spokesman was Hon. Peter S. Kennedy.\r\n\r\nAmong the Clinton County leaders were Albert H. Coble, Edward R. Burns,\r\nA. T. Dennis, Wm. H. Staley, R. P. Shanklin, S. A. Coulton, J. W.\r\nHarrison, J. T. Hockman, Nicholas Rice, Ambrose Colby, Oliver Hedgecock,\r\nand Dr. Gard of Frankfort. Judge J. C. Suit was their orator.\r\n\r\nIn reply to their addresses General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--These daily and increasing delegations coming\r\n  to witness their interest in the great issues which are presented for\r\n  their consideration and determination, and bearing as they do to me\r\n  their kind personal greetings, quite overmatch my ability to fittingly\r\n  greet and respond to them.\r\n\r\n  You are here from every walk in life. Some of you have achieved\r\n  success in the mechanical arts, some in professional pursuits, and\r\n  more of you come from that first great pursuit of man--the tilling of\r\n  the soil--and you come to express the thought that you have common\r\n  interests; that these diverse pursuits are bound together harmoniously\r\n  in a common governmental policy and administration. Your interests\r\n  have had a harmonious and an amazing growth under that protective\r\n  system to which your representatives have referred, and you wisely\r\n  demand a continuation of that policy for their further advancement\r\n  and development. [Applause.] You are in large part members of the\r\n  Republican party. You have in the past contributed your personal\r\n  influence, as well as your ballots, to the great victories which it\r\n  has won. Among the great achievements of our party I think we may\r\n  worthily mention the passage of that beneficent act of legislation\r\n  known as the \"homestead law.\" It was impossible to the old parties.\r\n  It was possible only to a party composed of the sturdy yeomanry of\r\n  the free States. [Applause.] It has populated our Territories and\r\n  newer States with the elect of our citizenship. It opened a way\r\n  to an ownership of the soil to a vast number of our citizens, and\r\n  there is no surer bond in the direction of good citizenship than\r\n  that our people should have property in the soil upon which they\r\n  live. It is one of the best elements of our strength as a State\r\n  that our farm-lands are so largely possessed in small tracts, and\r\n  are tilled by the men who own them. It is one of the best evidences\r\n  of the prosperity of our cities that so large a proportion of the\r\n  men who work are covered by their own roof trees. If we would\r\n  perpetuate this condition, we must maintain the American scale of\r\n  wages. [Applause.] The policy of the subdivision of the soil is one\r\n  that tends to strengthen our national life. God grant that it may be\r\n  long before we have in this country a tenantry that is hopelessly\r\n  such from one generation to another. [Applause.] That condition of\r\n  things which makes Ireland a land of tenants, and which holds in\r\n  vast estates the lands of England, must never find footing here.\r\n  [Applause.] Small farms invite the church and the school-house into\r\n  the neighborhood. Therefore, it was in the beginning the Republican\r\n  party declared for free homes of a quarter-section each. That policy\r\n  should be perpetuated as long as our public domain lasts, and all our\r\n  legislation should tend in the direction which I have indicated. I\r\n  cannot discuss all the important questions to which you have called my\r\n  attention. I have before alluded to some of them. My Montgomery and\r\n  Clinton county friends, I thank you for the cordial and hopeful words\r\n  you have addressed to me. My highest ambition is to be found worthy of\r\n  your respect and confidence. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  To these veterans of 1840 who kindly transfer to this the interest\r\n  they felt in that campaign, to these first voters who come to join us\r\n  with the high impulses of youth, I desire to extend my sincere thanks.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable night demonstration of the campaign occurred August\r\n4, the occasion being the visit of the Harrison and Morton Railroad\r\nClub of Terre Haute, a thousand strong. They were met by twelve hundred\r\nmembers of the Indianapolis Railroad Club, and, escorted by several\r\nthousand citizens, marched to the Harrison residence.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the column rolled the model of a monster locomotive,\r\nemitting fire and smoke and bearing the significant number 544, Hundreds\r\nof stores and residences along the line of march were illuminated.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the visiting club marched its officers: President, D.\r\nT. Downs; Secretary, Chas. E. Carter; Treasurer, Benj. McKeen; and\r\nVice-Presidents, R. B. Woolsey, J. L. Pringle, J. N. Evanhart, E. G.\r\nSouth, L. M. Murphy, H. M. Kearns, George Leckert, and W. H. Miller.\r\n\r\nPresident Downs delivered an address and presented an engrossed copy of\r\nthe club roster. General Harrison spoke from a stand in front of his\r\nresidence, and said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Downs, Gentlemen of the Terre Haute Railroad Club, and\r\n  Fellow-citizens_--I am amazed and gratified at the character of this\r\n  demonstration to-night. I do not find words to express the emotions\r\n  which swell in my heart as I look into your faces and listen to the\r\n  kindly greetings which you have given me through your representative.\r\n  He has not spoken in too high praise of the railroad men of the United\r\n  States. The character of the duties they are called to discharge\r\n  require great intelligence, in many departments the best skill in the\r\n  highest mechanic arts, and in all, even in the lowest grade of labor\r\n  in connection with railroad management, there is required, for the\r\n  safety of the public who entrust themselves to your care, fidelity\r\n  and watchfulness, not only in the day, but in the darkness. The man\r\n  who attends the switch, the trackman who observes the condition of\r\n  the track--all these have put into their charge and keeping the\r\n  lives of men and women and the safety of our commerce. Therefore it\r\n  is that the exigencies of the service in which you are engaged have\r\n  operated to select and call into the service of our great railroad\r\n  corporations a picked body of men. I gratefully acknowledge to-night\r\n  the service you render to the country of which I am a citizen. The\r\n  great importance of the enterprises with which you are connected have\r\n  already suggested to our legislators that they owe duties to you as\r\n  well as to the travelling and mercantile public. The Congress of the\r\n  United States has, under that provision of the Constitution which\r\n  commits to its care all foreign and interstate commerce, undertaken\r\n  to regulate the great interstate railroads in the interest of equal\r\n  and fair competition and in the equal interest of all members of our\r\n  communities. I do not doubt that certain and necessary provisions\r\n  for the safety of the men who operate these roads will yet be made\r\n  compulsory by public and general law. [Applause.] The dangers\r\n  connected with your calling are very great, and the public interest,\r\n  as well as your own, requires that they should be reduced to the\r\n  minimum. I do not doubt that we shall yet require that uniformity\r\n  in the construction of railroad cars that will diminish the danger\r\n  of those who must pass between them in order to make up trains.\r\n  [Applause.] I do not doubt, either, that as these corporations are\r\n  not private corporations, but are recognized by the law to which I\r\n  have referred and by the uniform decisions of our courts as having\r\n  public relations, we shall yet see legislation in the direction of\r\n  providing some suitable tribunal of arbitration for the settlement of\r\n  differences between railroad men and the companies that engage their\r\n  services. [Great applause.] I believe that in these directions, and\r\n  others that I have not time to suggest, reforms will work themselves\r\n  out, with exact justice to the companies and with justice to the\r\n  men they employ. Because, my friends, I do not doubt--and I hope\r\n  you will never allow yourselves to doubt--that the great mass of\r\n  our people, of all vocations and callings, love justice and right\r\n  and hate oppression. [Applause.] The laboring men of this land may\r\n  safely trust every just reform in which they are interested to public\r\n  discussion and to the logic of reason; they may surely hope, upon\r\n  these lines, which are open to you by the ballot-box, to accomplish\r\n  under our American institutions all those right things you have\r\n  conceived as necessary to your highest success and well-being. Do not\r\n  allow yourselves to doubt, for one moment, the friendly sentiment of\r\n  the great masses of our people. Make your appeal wisely, and calmly,\r\n  and boldly, for every reform you desire, to that sentiment of justice\r\n  which pervades our American public. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  You come to-night from one of our most beautiful Indiana cities.\r\n  It was built on the Wabash in the expectation that that stream would\r\n  furnish the channel of its communication with the outside world.\r\n  But the Wabash is a small tributary to-day to the commerce of Terre\r\n  Haute. The railroads that span it are the great vehicles of your\r\n  commerce. They have largely superseded the water communication that\r\n  was deemed so important in the first settlement, and, perhaps, was so\r\n  decisive in the location of your city. Terre Haute is conspicuous for\r\n  its industries. The smoke of your factories goes up night and day.\r\n  The farms about your city have become gardens, and the cordial and\r\n  harmonious relations between the railroad shop and the factory and\r\n  the farms that lie about have a conspicuous illustration with you.\r\n  You have found that that policy which built up these shops, which\r\n  maintains them, which secures the largest output yearly from the\r\n  factories, which gives employment to the largest number of men, is\r\n  the best thing not only for the railroads that do the transportation,\r\n  but for the workingmen, who find steady employment at good wages,\r\n  and for the farmers, who supply their needs. [Applause.] You will\r\n  not willingly be led to believe that any policy that would check\r\n  the progress and the prosperity of these enterprises is good for\r\n  you or for the community in which you live. [Applause and cries of\r\n  \"No, never!\"] It will be hard to convince such an intelligent body\r\n  of workingmen that a policy which would transfer from this country\r\n  to any other the work that might be done here is good for them.\r\n  [Applause.] It can easily be demonstrated that if our revenue laws\r\n  were so adjusted that the imports from Great Britain should be doubled\r\n  it would be good for the workingmen of England, but I think it would\r\n  be hard to demonstrate that it would be good for the workingmen of\r\n  America. [Applause.] There is a wise selfishness; it begins at home,\r\n  and he who has the care of his own family first, of the community in\r\n  which he lives, of the nation of which he is a citizen, is wise in his\r\n  generation.\r\n\r\n  Now, my friends, I have been daily talking. I used to be thought by\r\n  my friends to be a reticent man. [Laughter.] I fear I am making an\r\n  impression that I am garrulous. [Cries of \"No! No!\"] And yet, when\r\n  friends such as you take the trouble you have to-night to visit me, I\r\n  feel that I owe it to you to say something.\r\n\r\n  Now, thanking you for this roster, which will furnish authentic\r\n  evidence, if it is challenged, that this visit to-night has been from\r\n  genuine railroad men [applause], I venture to invite my Terre Haute\r\n  friends to enter my house. I will ask the citizens of Indianapolis,\r\n  the escort club of my own home, railroad friends who have done so\r\n  much to make your coming here to-night pleasant, to kindly refrain\r\n  themselves, and allow me to greet the visitors. In order that that\r\n  may be accomplished, I will ask some of my Terre Haute friends to\r\n  place themselves by the door, that I may meet those who are of their\r\n  company. The others I have seen, or will see some other day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, August 6, General Harrison received a visit from one hundred\r\nmembers of the Kansas City Blaine Club, accompanied by many ladies, _en\r\nroute_ to New York to welcome the Maine statesman on his return from\r\nEurope. Col. R. H. Hunt led the club, and delivered a stirring address\r\non behalf of the Republicans of Missouri. On concluding he introduced\r\nMiss Abbie Burgess, who presented the General a beautiful badge\r\ninscribed \"The Kansas City Blaine Club Greet Their Next President.\"\r\nMiss Burgess made the presentation in the name of the working-women of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison responded briefly to these addresses, stating that he\r\nfound he had been talking a great deal of late; \"but,\" he added, \"I\r\nnever begin it; some one else always starts it.\" He returned his cordial\r\nthanks to the visitors for the compliment of their call.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the trip which the visitors were making, he commended its\r\npurpose in meeting upon his return to America \"that matchless defender\r\nof Republican principles--James G. Blaine.\" He felt sure that no\r\ncircumstance would be omitted in doing him merited honor. He was glad to\r\nknow that the Republicans of Missouri are so zealous and aggressive. He\r\nbelieved that they had, perhaps, too much acquiesced in the majorities\r\nagainst them, and had not offered such resistance as would prove their\r\nown strength. In the coming canvass he thought the economic questions\r\nat issue ought to work to the interest of Republicans in Missouri and\r\novercome in part the prevailing Democratic prejudices there. He also\r\nexpressed the hope that the race question would cease to divide men by\r\nprejudices that should long ago have become extinct.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Miss Burgess' address the General expressed his grateful\r\nappreciation of the souvenir, and said that the women of the land could\r\nnever be forgotten. To those of them who are toilers for their daily\r\nbread the first thought goes out in considering the question that\r\ninvolves depreciation of wages, and concluded by declaring if cheaper\r\ncoats and cheaper garments were to be had by still further reducing\r\nthe wages of the sewing-women of America, then he was not in favor of\r\ncheaper apparel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndianapolis contained several thousand visitors at this period, in\r\nattendance on the State convention; in addition to these, however, on\r\nthe seventh of August two large delegations arrived. The first came\r\nfrom Tippecanoe County. The city of Lafayette was represented by the\r\nLincoln Club, H. C. Tinney, President; the Garfield Club, Henry Vinton,\r\nPresident; and the Young Men's Republican Club Association. Among other\r\nprominent members of the delegation were James M. Reynolds, N. I.\r\nThrockmorton, W. H. Caulkins, Charles E. Wilson, Wm. Fraser, John B.\r\nSherwood, Charles Terry, John Opp, Alexander Stidham, Matt Heffner, S.\r\nVater, Maurice Mayerstein, Geo. A. Harrison, W. D. Hilt, P. W. Sheehan,\r\nC. H. Henderson, Henry Marshall, J. W. Jefferson, Wm. E. Beach, John B.\r\nGault, and H. M. Carter. Hon. B. Wilson Smith delivered an address on\r\nbehalf of his townsmen.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in his response, touched upon the origin and\r\nprinciples of the Republican party. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Smith and my Tippecanoe County Friends_--I am very grateful\r\n  for the evidence which you give me this morning by your presence, and\r\n  by the kind words which your representative has addressed to me, of\r\n  your respect and good-will. You are members, in great part, of a party\r\n  that was not machine-made. It had its birth in an impulse that stirred\r\n  simultaneously the hearts of those who loved liberty. The first\r\n  convention of our party did not organize it. Those men were great, but\r\n  they were delegates--representatives of principles which had already\r\n  asserted their power over the consciences and the hearts of the\r\n  people. [Applause.] The Republican party did not organize for spoils;\r\n  it assembled about an altar of sacrifice and in a sanctuary beset with\r\n  enemies. You have not forgotten our early battle-cry--\"Free speech,\r\n  a free press, free schools and free Territories.\" We have widened\r\n  the last word; it is now \"a free Nation.\" The appeals which we have\r\n  made and shall yet make are addressed to the hearts, the consciences,\r\n  and to the mind of our people. Therefore, we believe in schools\r\n  and colleges, and seminaries of learning. Education is the great\r\n  conservative and assimilating force. A doubter is not necessarily\r\n  an evil person. The capacity to doubt implies reason--the power of\r\n  solving doubts; and if the doubt is accompanied with a purpose to find\r\n  the truth and a supreme affection for the truth when it is found, he\r\n  will not go widely astray. Therefore, in our political campaigns let\r\n  men think for themselves, and the truth will assert its sway over\r\n  the minds of our people. Then everything that affects the record and\r\n  character of the candidate and the principles of the parties will\r\n  be brought to a safe tribunal whose judgment will be right. [Great\r\n  applause and cries of \"Good!\"]\r\n\r\n  I am not unaware of the fact that some of you had another convention\r\n  preference, but I have always believed that convention preferences\r\n  should be free in the Republican party [applause], and that no\r\n  prejudice should follow any Republican on account of that preference.\r\n  As party men, we will judge a man by his post-convention conduct.\r\n\r\nThe second delegation comprised fifteen hundred citizens from Vanderburg\r\nCounty. The Tippecanoe Club of Evansville, with sixty veterans, led the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nLeaders in the delegation were ex-Congressman Heilman, Henry S. Bennett,\r\nChas. H. McCarer, J. E. Iglehart, W. A. Wheeler, C. R. Howe, J. W.\r\nCompton, S. B. Sansom, S. A. Bate, John H. Osborn, John W. Davidson,\r\nHenry Ludwig, Wm. Koelling, A. S. Glover, J. W. Roelker, R. C.\r\nWilkinson, James D. Parvin, Wm. Warren, Chas. L. Roberts, and Geo. N.\r\nWells.\r\n\r\nDr. W. G. Ralston delivered an address in the name of the delegation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in reply, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Good Friends from the Pocket_--I feel very much complimented by\r\n  your visit to-day. Your coming here from so great a distance involved\r\n  much inconvenience which those who live nearer have not experienced.\r\n  You are geographically remote, but it does not follow from that that\r\n  you are remote from the sources of political influence and political\r\n  power.\r\n\r\n  The General then spoke of the extension of the Republican party from\r\n  the lakes to the Ohio in Indiana and all over the North, saying that\r\n  geographical lines marked its limits only in the South. He said that\r\n  the people of Vanderburg County, living as they did on the Ohio River,\r\n  a river that some men sought to make the division line between two\r\n  governments, knew what it was to guard their homes and what it was to\r\n  send out veterans from the sturdy yeomanry to the defence of their\r\n  country. He referred in the highest terms to General Shackelford and\r\n  his service in the hour of his country's need. \"I greet you to-day,\"\r\n  he continued, \"as Republicans--men whose judgment and conscience\r\n  compel their political opinions. It does not fall to my lot now to\r\n  argue or discuss at length any of the great political questions of\r\n  the day. I have done that in the past. It is reserved for others in\r\n  this campaign. I recall with pleasure my frequent visits to you and\r\n  your cordial reception when I came to speak to you. In this contest\r\n  others will maintain before you that great policy which, we believe,\r\n  dignifies every American, both at home and abroad.\"\r\n\r\n  Speaking in reference to wages, General Harrison said that he\r\n  thought we often forget the women who were compelled to work for their\r\n  daily bread. He sometimes thought those persons who demand cheaper\r\n  coats would be ashamed of themselves if they could realize that their\r\n  demand cut the wages of the women who made these coats. In concluding,\r\n  he greeted and thanked the Tippecanoe Club for coming, and the\r\n  Young Men's Republican Club also, saying that he had heard of their\r\n  efficient work in the highest terms of praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 8.\r\n\r\n_The Republican State Convention._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican State Convention convened at Tomlinson Hall, city of\r\nIndianapolis, August 8, 1888, and concluded its work in one day.\r\n\r\nIt was the largest attended and most enthusiastic convention ever held\r\nin Indiana. Hon. Wm. H. Calkins of Indianapolis was chosen Chairman,\r\nand Mark L. De Motte of Valparaiso Secretary. The following ticket was\r\nnominated, and in November triumphantly elected:\r\n\r\n_Governor_--Alvin P. Hovey, Posey County.\r\n\r\n_Lieutenant-Governor_--Ira J. Chase, Hendricks County.\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_--Charles F. Griffin, Lake County.\r\n\r\n_Auditor of State_--Bruce Carr, Orange County.\r\n\r\n_Treasurer_--J. A. Lemcke, Vanderburg County.\r\n\r\n_Attorney-General_--L. T. Michner, Shelby County.\r\n\r\n_Superintendent Public Instruction_--H. M. LaFollette, Boone County.\r\n\r\n_Reporter Supreme Court_--John L. Griffiths, Marion County.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDGES OF SUPREME COURT.\r\n\r\n_First District_--Silas T. Coffey, Clay County.\r\n\r\n_Second District_--J. G. Berkshire, Jennings County.\r\n\r\n_Fourth District_--Walter Olds, Whitely County.\r\n\r\n_Electors-at-Large_--James M. Shackelford, Vanderburg County; Thomas H.\r\nNelson, Vigo County.\r\n\r\nJudge Gardner, a delegate from Daviess County, introduced a resolution,\r\nwhich was unanimously adopted midst great enthusiasm, inviting General\r\nHarrison to visit the convention, and designating Hon. Richard W.\r\nThompson, John W. Linck and E. P. Hammond a committee to convey the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nOn the platform, with the presiding officer, to meet the distinguished\r\nguest were the Hon. James N. Huston, Hon. John M. Butler, Hon. Will\r\nCumback, William Wallace, Hon. W. P. Fishback, Hon. A. C. Harris, Rev.\r\nDr. Backus, Judge E. B. Martindale, General Thomas Bennett, Judge J. H.\r\nJordan, and the Republican State officials.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of General Harrison, escorted by the committee, was\r\nfollowed by a tumultuous scene rarely witnessed outside of a national\r\nconvention, the demonstration lasting nearly ten minutes. Chairman\r\nCalkins finally succeeded in introducing--\"the next President\"--and\r\nGeneral Harrison spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention_--When I received\r\n  your invitation to appear for a moment before you I felt that what\r\n  you asked could not involve any indelicacy, and as it offered me the\r\n  only opportunity which I shall have to look into the faces of my\r\n  Indiana Republican friends here assembled, I could not find it in\r\n  my heart to deny myself the pleasure of spending a moment in your\r\n  presence. [Applause.] This enthusiastic and kindly reception crowns\r\n  a long series of friendly acts on the part of my Republican friends\r\n  of Indiana. To have your confidence is very grateful to me, to be\r\n  worthy of your confidence is the highest ambition I can set before me.\r\n  [Applause.] Whatever may befall me, I feel that my fellow-citizens of\r\n  Indiana have crowned me and made me forever their debtor. [Applause.]\r\n  But I must not detain you from the business which has brought you\r\n  here. [Cries of \"Go on!\"] Such an assemblage as this is characteristic\r\n  of America. What you shall do to-day will influence the prosperity and\r\n  welfare of the State. Such a meeting is a notable historical event.\r\n  We have to-day transpiring in this country two other events that are\r\n  attracting wide interest. At the chief seaport of our country that\r\n  great Republican, and that great American, James G. Blaine, returns to\r\n  his home. [Applause.] We shall not be disappointed, I hope, in hearing\r\n  his powerful voice in Indiana before the campaign is old. [Applause.]\r\n  Another scene attracts our solemn and even tearful interest, for\r\n  while you are transacting your business here to-day a draped train is\r\n  bearing from the place of his sojourn by the sea to the place of his\r\n  interment at Washington the mortal part of Philip H. Sheridan. From\r\n  the convention at Chicago we sent him our greetings and our earnest\r\n  prayers for his restoration. To-day we mourn our hero dead. You called\r\n  him then a favorite child of victory, and such he was. He was one of\r\n  those great commanders who, upon the field of battle, towered a very\r\n  god of war. [Applause.] He was one of those earnest fighters for his\r\n  country who did not at the end of his first day's fight contemplate\r\n  rest and recuperation for his own command. He rested and refreshed\r\n  his command with the wine of victory, and found recuperation in the\r\n  dispersion of the enemy that confronted him. [Great applause.] This\r\n  gallant son of Ireland and America [great applause] has written a\r\n  chapter in the art of war that will not fail to instruct and to\r\n  develop, when the exigencies may come again, others who shall repeat\r\n  in defence of our flag his glorious achievements. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  And now, Mr. President, and gentlemen, I am sure the heat of this\r\n  hall and the labors that are before you suggest to you, as they do\r\n  to me, that I shall close these remarks and bid you good-by. [Great\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nGodfrey Commandery, Knights Templars, of Chicago, colored men, _en\r\nroute_ to the Grand Conclave at Louisville, paid their respects to\r\nGeneral Harrison on the 13th, and were individually presented by Eminent\r\nCommander H. S. Cooper. On August 14 the visitors aggregated 6,000.\r\n\r\nThe first delegation came from Hamilton County, Indiana, headed by\r\neighty veterans of the Tippecanoe Club, Charles Swain, President. There\r\nwere nine Lincoln League organizations in line. Among the leaders were\r\nJ. K. Bush, J. E. Walker, F. B. Pfaff, J. R. Christian, Benj. Goldsmith,\r\nIke Hiatt, and C. R. Davis, of Noblesville, and Captain Carl, of\r\nArcadia. Hon. J. R. Gray was their spokesman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in reply, said:\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Gray and my Hamilton County Friends_--The demonstration\r\n  which you have made this morning is worthy of Hamilton County; it is\r\n  worthy of the great party to which you have given the consent of your\r\n  minds and the love of your hearts; it is altogether more than worthy\r\n  of him whom you have come to greet. You come from a county that, as\r\n  your spokesman has said, is greatly favored, a county rich in its\r\n  agricultural capacity; but, as I look into your faces this morning\r\n  I turn from the contemplation of material wealth to the thought of\r\n  those things that are higher and better. [Applause and cries of \"Good!\r\n  Good!\"] Not long ago a distinguished Englishman and jurist visited our\r\n  country. On the eve of his return, in a public address, he alluded to\r\n  the fact that wherever he went he was asked whether he was not amazed\r\n  at the great size of our country. This student of law and government\r\n  very kindly, but very decidedly, rebuked this too prevalent pride of\r\n  bulk, and called our attention to the finer and higher things that he\r\n  had observed in our American civilization.\r\n\r\n  So to-day, as I look into these intelligent faces, my thoughts\r\n  are turned away from those things that are scheduled, that have\r\n  their places in our census returns, to those things which belong\r\n  to the higher man--his spiritual and moral nature. [Applause.] I\r\n  congratulate you, not so much upon the rich farm lands of your\r\n  county as upon your virtuous and happy homes. [Applause.] The home is\r\n  the best, as it is the first, school of good citizenship. It is the\r\n  great conservative and assimilating force. I should despair for my\r\n  country if American citizens were to be trained only in our schools,\r\n  valuable as their instruction is. It is in the home that we first\r\n  learn obedience and respect for law. Parental authority is the type of\r\n  beneficent government. It is in the home that we learn to love, in the\r\n  mother that bore us, that which is virtuous, consecrated, and pure.\r\n  [Applause.] I take more pride in the fact that the Republican party\r\n  has always been the friend and protector of the American home than in\r\n  aught else. [Applause.] By the beneficent homestead law it created\r\n  more than half a million of homes; by the Emancipation Proclamation it\r\n  converted a million cattle-pens into homes. [Applause] And it is still\r\n  true to those principles that will preserve contentment and prosperity\r\n  in our homes. I greet you as men who have been nurtured in such homes,\r\n  and call your thought to the fact that the Republican party has always\r\n  been, and can be trusted to be, friendly to all that will promote\r\n  virtue, intelligence and morality in the homes of our people.\r\n\r\n  Now, in view of the fact that I must greet other delegations to-day\r\n  [cries of \"Don't stop!\"], I am sure you will be content with these\r\n  brief remarks, though they are altogether an inadequate return for\r\n  your cordial demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe other delegations of the day came from Macon and Douglas counties,\r\nIllinois, numbering 3,000. A notable feature of the Douglas County\r\ndisplay was the tattered old battle-flag of the Twenty-first Illinois\r\nRegiment--General Grant's original regiment--borne by seven survivors.\r\n\r\nCapt. T. D. Minturn, of Tuscola, was spokesman. At the head of the\r\nMacon County column marched 300 uniformed members of the Young Men's\r\nRepublican Club of Decatur, led by Captain Wm. M. Strange and Wm.\r\nFrazier; Prof. L. A. Estes, of Westfield, headed a company from that\r\ntown. Andrew H. Mills, of Decatur, spoke for the Macon County people.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Republican Friends_--I feel myself unable to respond suitably\r\n  to this magnificent demonstration and to those kindly words which you\r\n  have addressed to me. Public duties involve grave responsibilities.\r\n  The conscientious man will not contemplate them without seriousness.\r\n  But the man who sincerely desires to know and to do his duty may\r\n  rely upon the favoring help of God and the friendly judgment of his\r\n  fellow-citizens. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  Your coming from another State and from distant homes testifies to\r\n  the observing interest which you feel in those questions which are to\r\n  be settled by the ballot in November. [Cries of \"We will settle them!\"]\r\n\r\n  The confessed free-traders are very few in this country. But English\r\n  statesmen and English newspapers confidently declare that in fact we\r\n  have a great many. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  We are told that it is only an average reduction of seven per\r\n  cent. that is contemplated. [Laughter.] Well, if that were true, and\r\n  not a very deceptive statement, as it really is, you might fairly\r\n  ask whether this average reduction does not sacrifice some American\r\n  industry or the wages of our workingmen and working-women. You may\r\n  also fairly ask to see the free list, which does not figure in this\r\n  \"average.\" [Applause, and cries of \"That's it!\"] We would have more\r\n  confidence in the protest of these reformers that they are not\r\n  \"free-traders\" if we could occasionally hear one of them say that\r\n  he was a protectionist [applause], or admit that our customs duties\r\n  should adequately favor our domestic industries. But they seem to be\r\n  content with a negative statement.\r\n\r\n  Those who would, if they could, eliminate the protective principle\r\n  from our tariff laws have, in former moments of candor, described\r\n  themselves as \"progressive free-traders,\" and it is an apt\r\n  designation. The protective system is a barrier against the flood of\r\n  foreign importations and the competition of underpaid labor in Europe.\r\n  [Applause.] Those who want to lower the dike owe it to those who live\r\n  behind it to make a plain statement of their purposes. Do they want to\r\n  invite the flood, or do they believe in the dike, but think it will\r\n  afford adequate protection at a lower level? [Great and enthusiastic\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n  What I say is only suggestive. I cannot in this brief talk go into\r\n  details, or even properly limit the illustrations I have used. But\r\n  this is an appropriate and timely inquiry: With what motive, what\r\n  ultimate design, what disposition toward the principle of protection\r\n  is it that our present tariff schedule is attacked? It may be that\r\n  reductions should be made; it may be that some duties should be\r\n  increased; but we want to know whether those who propose the revision\r\n  believe in taking thought of our American workingmen in fixing the\r\n  rates, or will leave them to the chance effects of a purely revenue\r\n  tariff. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Now, having spoken once already to-day, you will accept this\r\n  inadequate acknowledgment of this magnificent demonstration.\r\n\r\n  I thank you, my Illinois friends, not only on my own behalf, but on\r\n  behalf of the Republicans of Indiana, for the great interest you have\r\n  manifested. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nRush, Decatur, and Delaware counties, Indiana, contributed fully five\r\nthousand visitors on the 15th of August. Rush County sent twenty\r\nRepublican clubs, mainly township organizations, led by one hundred\r\nveterans of 1836 and '40. The prominent Republicans of the delegation\r\nwere Hon. John K. Gowdy, John M. Stevens, A. L. Riggs, W. J. Henley,\r\nJohn F. Moses, T. M. Green, J. C. Kiplinger, J. W. Study, and G. W.\r\nLooney, of Rushville; R. R. Spencer and J. A. Shannon, of Richland.\r\nJudge W. A. Cullen was their spokesman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Judge Cullen and my Rush County Friends_--I am glad to see you\r\n  here--glad to be assured by him who has spoken in your behalf that\r\n  your coming here in some measure is intended as an evidence of your\r\n  personal respect for me. The respect of one's fellow-citizens, who\r\n  have opportunities to know him, is of priceless value.\r\n\r\n  I cannot in these daily addresses enter much into public questions.\r\n\r\n  You are Indianians, some of you by birth; some of you, like me, by\r\n  choice. You are Republicans; you have opposed always the doctrine of\r\n  State's rights; you have believed and gloried in the great citizenship\r\n  that embraces all the people of all the States. You believe that\r\n  this Government is not a confederation to be dissolved at the will\r\n  of any member of it, but a Nation having the inherent right, by\r\n  arms, if need be, to perpetuate its beneficent existence. [Great\r\n  applause.] Many of you who are here to-day have aided in vindicating\r\n  that principle upon the battle-field [cries of \"Plenty of us!\"], and\r\n  yet these views are not inconsistent with a just State pride. We are\r\n  proud to be Indianians, proud of the story of her progress in material\r\n  development, proud of her educational and benevolent institutions,\r\n  proud of her Christian homes, proud of her part in the Civil War.\r\n  If there has been any just cause of reproach against our State we\r\n  will all desire that it may be removed. We may fairly appeal to all\r\n  Indianians, without distinction of party, to co-operate in promoting\r\n  such public measures as are calculated to lift up the dignity and\r\n  honor and estimation of Indiana among the States of the Union. [Great\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n  I will call your attention to one such subject that seems to me to\r\n  be worthy of your thought. It is the reform of our election laws.\r\n  [Applause and cries of \"That's it!\"] A constitutional amendment, to\r\n  which a great majority of our people gave their sanction, has removed\r\n  the impediments which stood in the way of progressive legislation in\r\n  the protection of an honest ballot in Indiana. Formerly we could not\r\n  require a definite period of residence in the voting precinct. Now we\r\n  may and have. The same amendment authorized our Legislature to enact\r\n  a just and strict registry law, which will enable the inspectors\r\n  properly to verify the claims of those who offer a ballot. Every\r\n  safeguard of law should be thrown around the ballot-box until fraud\r\n  in voting and frauds in counting shall receive the sure penalties of\r\n  law as well as the reprobation of all good men. [Great applause.] The\r\n  Republican party has always stood for election reforms. No measure\r\n  tending to secure the ballot-box against fraud has ever been opposed\r\n  by its representatives. I am not here to make imputations; I submit\r\n  this general suggestion: Find me the party that sets the gate of\r\n  election frauds open, or holds it open, and I will show you the party\r\n  that expects to drive cattle that way. [Applause.] Let us as citizens,\r\n  irrespective of party, unite to exalt the name of Indiana by making\r\n  her election laws models of justice and severity, and her elections\r\n  free from the taint of suspicion. [Great applause.] And now, as I must\r\n  presently speak to other delegations, I am sure my Rush County friends\r\n  will allow me to close these remarks. [Applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe visitors from Decatur and Delaware counties were received together.\r\nThe Decatur delegation numbered fifteen hundred, led by B. F. Bennett,\r\nJohn F. Goddard, V. P. Harris, J. J. Hazelrigg, Geo. Anderson, Edward\r\nSpeer, A. G. Fisher, F. M. Sherwood, and A. S. Creath, of Greensburg.\r\nTheir spokesman was the Hon. Will Cumback. Delaware County sent twelve\r\norganizations, conspicuous among which were the Tippecanoe Club, the\r\nVeterans Regiment, and Lincoln Colored Club. Among the leaders of the\r\ndelegation were ex-Senator M. C. Smith, A. F. Collins, Hon. James N.\r\nTempler, Major J. F. Wildman, Rev. T. S. Guthrie, J. D. Hoyt, Geo. F.\r\nMcCulloch, W. W. Orr, Joseph G. Lefler, Lee Coffeen, C. F. W. Neely,\r\nEd. R. Templer, W. H. Murray, W. H. Stokes, John S. Aldredge, J. R.\r\nShoemaker, Jacob Stiffler, Web S. Richey, T. H. Johnson and others, of\r\nMuncie. Rev. N. L. Bray spoke on behalf of the Lincoln Club, but R. S.\r\nGregory delivered the address for the delegation as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn reply to these several addresses General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--The man who does not believe that the issues of this\r\n  campaign have taken a very deep hold upon the minds and upon the\r\n  hearts of the American people would do well to come and stand with\r\n  me and look into the faces of the masses who gather here. I know\r\n  nothing of the human face if I do not read again in your faces and\r\n  eyes the lesson I have read here from day to day, and it is this: That\r\n  the thinking, intelligent, God-fearing and self-respecting citizens\r\n  of this country believe there are issues at stake that demand their\r\n  earnest effort. [Applause.] A campaign that is one simply of party\r\n  management, a campaign by committees and public speakers, may fail;\r\n  but a campaign to which the men and women of the country give their\r\n  unselfish and earnest efforts can never fail. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is no personal interest in the candidate that stirs these\r\n  emotions in your hearts; it is the belief that questions are involved\r\n  affecting your prosperity and the prosperity of your neighbors;\r\n  affecting the dignity of the nation; affecting the generation to which\r\n  you will presently leave the government which our fathers built and\r\n  you have saved. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  One subject is never omitted by those who speak for these visiting\r\n  delegations, viz.: the protective tariff. The purpose not to permit\r\n  American wages to be brought below the level of comfortable living,\r\n  and competence, and hope, by competition with the pauper labor of\r\n  Europe, has taken a very strong hold upon our people. [Applause.] And\r\n  of kin to this suggestion and purpose is this other: that we will not\r\n  permit this country to be made the dumping-ground of foreign pauperism\r\n  and crime. [Great applause.] There are some who profess to be eager to\r\n  exclude paupers and Chinese laborers, and at the same time advocate\r\n  a policy that brings the American workman into competition with the\r\n  product of cheap foreign labor. [Applause and cries of \"That's it!\"]\r\n  The disastrous effects upon our workingmen and working-women of\r\n  competition with cheap, underpaid labor are not obviated by keeping\r\n  the cheap worker over the sea if the product of his cheap labor is\r\n  allowed free competition in our market. We should protect our people\r\n  against competition with the products of underpaid labor abroad as\r\n  well as against the coming to our shores of paupers, laborers under\r\n  contract, and the Chinese labor. [Enthusiastic applause.] These two\r\n  thoughts are twin thoughts; the same logic supports both; and the\r\n  Republican party holds them as the dual conclusion of one great\r\n  argument.\r\n\r\n  Now, gentlemen, to the first voters, who come with the high impulse\r\n  of recruits into this strife; to these old men, seasoned veterans of\r\n  many a contest, and to these colored friends, whose fidelity has been\r\n  conspicuous, I give my thanks and hearty greetings. [Applause.] There\r\n  has been a desire expressed that the reception of these delegations\r\n  should be individualized; that Delaware should be received by itself,\r\n  and Decatur separately; but that is not possible. You are one in\r\n  thought and purpose; and if I am not able to individualize your\r\n  reception by counties, I will, so far as I can, now make it absolutely\r\n  individual by greeting each one of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelegations from Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, aggregating between nine\r\nand ten thousand visitors, paid their respects to the Republican nominee\r\non the seventeenth of August.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio delegation came from Bellefontaine, Logan County, led by Judge\r\nWilliam Lawrence. They carried a beautiful old silk banner that had been\r\npresented to a Logan County club at the hands of Gen. Wm. Henry Harrison\r\nin 1840.\r\n\r\nFord County, Illinois, sent a large delegation, headed by Judge A.\r\nSample and Col. C. Bogardus, of Paxton. The Young Men's Club--Wm.\r\nRamsey, President, and the Paxton League--T. T. Thompson, President,\r\nwere conspicuous in this delegation.\r\n\r\nThe Kankakee County (Illinois) delegation, headed by the Republican club\r\nof the City of Kankakee in campaign uniforms, was led by Judge T. S.\r\nSawyer, D. H. Paddock, F. S. Hatch, W. F. Kenoga, H. L. Richardson, J.\r\nF. Leonard, R. D. Sherman, Geo. R. Letourneau, and Judge J. N. Orr.\r\n\r\nMorgan County, Illinois, contributed the largest delegation of the day,\r\nover two thousand, with three drum corps, one, the Jacksonville Juvenile\r\nDrum Corps, led by Thomas Barbour, aged 81. Prominent in the Morgan\r\ndelegation were C. G. Rutledge, President Young Men's Republican Club,\r\nB. F. Hilligass, D. M. Simmons, Dr. P. G. Gillett, Sam'l W. Nichols,\r\nJudge M. T. Layman, J. G. Loomis, A. P. and J. M. Smith, veterans of\r\n'40, and Henry Yates, son of Illinois' war Governor--all of Jacksonville.\r\n\r\nThe Indiana visitors came from three counties--Bartholomew, Johnson, and\r\nVermilion.\r\n\r\nThe Bartholomew contingent was composed largely of veterans of the late\r\nwar, who were led by a company of their daughters in uniform. Among\r\ntheir representative members were John C. Orr, W. W. Lambert, John H.\r\nTaylor, John F. Ott, J. W. Morgan, John Sharp, T. B. Prother, Andrew\r\nPerkinson, and H. Rost, of Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe Johnson County delegation numbered two thousand, led by W. T.\r\nPritchard, D. W. Barnett, Jessie Overstreet, J. H. Vannuys, I. M.\r\nThompson, Jacob Hazlett, and John Brown, of Franklin.\r\n\r\nVermilion County sent fifteen hundred enthusiastic visitors, commanded\r\nby A. J. Ralph, Marshal of the delegation. Other leaders were Hon. R. B.\r\nSears, W. L. Porter, Rob't A. Parrett, S. B. Davis, R. H. Nixon, Geo. H.\r\nFisher, and Andrew Curtis, of Newport.\r\n\r\nThe speakers on behalf of these several delegations were: Hon. William\r\nLawrence, of Ohio; Hon. Frank L. Cook, Paxton, Ill.; Judge C. R. Starr,\r\nKankakee County, Ill.; Prof. Wm. D. Saunders, Jacksonville, Ill.; Major\r\nW. T. Strickland, Bartholomew County, Ind.; Col. Sam'l P. Oyler,\r\nJohnson County, Ind.; Hon. H. H. Connelly, Vermilion County, Ind. To\r\nthese addresses General Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--The magnitude of this gathering, I fear, quite\r\n  out-reaches the capacity of my voice. It is so great and so cordial,\r\n  it has been accompanied by so many kind expressions, that my heart is\r\n  deeply touched--too deeply to permit of extended or connected speech.\r\n  I return most cordially the greetings of these friends from Ohio,\r\n  Indiana, and Illinois [cheers], a trio of great States lying in this\r\n  great valley, endowed by nature with a productive capacity that rivals\r\n  the famous valley of the Nile, populated by a people unsurpassed in\r\n  intelligence, manly independence and courage. [Applause and cheers.]\r\n  The association of these States to-day brings to my mind the fact\r\n  that in the brigade with which I served Indiana, Ohio and Illinois\r\n  were represented [applause]--three regiments from Illinois, the One\r\n  Hundred and Second, the One Hundred and Fifth and the One Hundred and\r\n  Twenty-ninth; one from Ohio, the Seventy-ninth, and one from Indiana,\r\n  the Seventieth Infantry. I have seen the men of these States stand\r\n  together in the evening parade. I have seen them also charge together\r\n  in battle, and die together for the flag they loved [great applause],\r\n  and when the battle was over I have seen the dead gathered from the\r\n  field they had enriched with their blood and laid side by side in\r\n  a common grave. Again you evidence by your coming that these great\r\n  States have in peace common interests and common sympathies. The\r\n  Republican party has always been hospitable to the truth. [Applause\r\n  and laughter.] It has never shunned debate. It has boldly, and in\r\n  the courage of the principles it has advocated, opened the lists and\r\n  challenged all comers. It has never found it necessary or consistent\r\n  with its great principles to suppress free discussion of any question.\r\n  There is not a Republican community where any man may not advocate\r\n  without fear his political beliefs. [Cries of \"That's so!\"] There is\r\n  not a Republican voting precinct where any man, whatever may have been\r\n  his relations to the flag during the war, may not freely exercise his\r\n  right to vote. [Cheers.] There is not one such precinct where the\r\n  right of a Confederate soldier freely to cast the ballot of his choice\r\n  would not be defended by the Union veterans of the war. [Applause\r\n  and cries of \"That's true!\"] Our party is tolerant of political\r\n  differences. It has always yielded to others all that it demanded for\r\n  itself. It has been intolerant of but one thing: disloyalty to the\r\n  flag and to the Union of States. [Great applause.] It has had the\r\n  good fortune to set in the Constitution and in the permanent laws of\r\n  our country many of the great principles for which it has contended.\r\n  It has not only persuaded a majority of our thinking people, but it\r\n  has had the unusual fortune to compel those who opposed it to give a\r\n  belated assent to every great principle it has supported.\r\n\r\n  Now, gentlemen, I am sure you will excuse further speech. What I say\r\n  here must necessarily be very general. It would not be in good taste\r\n  for me to make too close or too personal an application of Republican\r\n  principles. [Laughter and applause and cries of \"You're a dandy!\"]\r\n\r\n  I do not know what to say further. I have up to this time greeted\r\n  personally all those who came. My courage is a little shaken as I\r\n  look upon this vast multitude, but for a time, at least--so long as\r\n  I can, and to those who especially desire it, I will give a personal\r\n  greeting. [Great and prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commercial travelling men, and their friends, from the cities of\r\nPeoria, Bloomington, Terre Haute, and Lafayette, about a thousand in\r\nnumber, paid their respects to General Harrison on the afternoon of the\r\n18th of August. The Bloomington delegation was led by J. H. Sprague and\r\nDan Van Elsler, the Peoria Club by J. G. Jones. Each delegation was\r\nescorted by a splendid band.\r\n\r\nThey were met and escorted to the Harrison residence by a committee from\r\nthe Indianapolis Commercial Travellers' Association, comprising G. C.\r\nWebster, C. H. McPherson, John V. Parker, W. H. Schmidt, D. W. Coffin,\r\nHarry Gates, R. K. Syfers, W. F. Winchester, Wm. Sisson, T. P. Swain,\r\nC. L. Schmidt, Ed. Finney, O. W. Moorman, Charles Lefler, M. P. Green,\r\nJ. L. Barnhardt, Berg. Applegate, G. R. Rhoads, Hon. J. H. Rowell, of\r\nBloomington; and Hon. J. S. Starr of Peoria spoke on behalf of the\r\nvisitors. General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen of the Commercial Travellers' Association of Peoria,\r\n  Bloomington, Lafayette, and Terre Haute_--I thank you for this most\r\n  cordial and beautiful demonstration. The respect of such a body of men\r\n  is a valuable acquisition. But I am particularly glad that a class so\r\n  large and so influential, and one that touches so many communities,\r\n  is loyally and earnestly devoted to the principles of the Republican\r\n  party. I have travelled somewhat in the wake of the commercial men,\r\n  and have observed that they have the habit of getting the best of\r\n  everything wherever they go. [Applause and laughter. A voice: \"That's\r\n  the reason we are here!\"] I am therefore quite ready to credit the\r\n  statement of the gentleman who has just spoken in your behalf when he\r\n  tells me that the commercial travellers are all Republicans. [Applause\r\n  and cries of \"He was right!\"] I should expect they would get the best\r\n  politics that were to be found. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  Your calling is an active one--you are always on the move. You are\r\n  quick to discover the wants of local trade. You are persuasive in\r\n  speech and address; you are honest for the love of integrity, and do\r\n  not forget that you must again face your customer after the goods are\r\n  delivered. [Laughter and applause.] The men who employed you have\r\n  chosen you, picked you out, and they subject you to the weekly test\r\n  of success. You have been proved and not found wanting. The wide\r\n  intercourse you have with your fellow-men and the wide view you get of\r\n  our country must tend to make you liberal and patriotic.\r\n\r\n  The provincialism that once existed in this country has largely\r\n  disappeared, and the commercial travellers have been an important\r\n  agency in bringing this about. This going to and fro has given you a\r\n  fuller comprehension, not only of the extent of this country, but of\r\n  the greatness and unity of its people. [Cheers.] I have thought that\r\n  the prophet Daniel must have had a vision of the commercial travellers\r\n  when he said that in the last days many should run to and fro and\r\n  knowledge should be increased. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  You will not expect me to enter upon the discussion of any of the\r\n  topics which have been suggested by those who have spoken for you.\r\n  Most of them I have already alluded to in public speech since my\r\n  nomination, and upon some of them I have spoken more fully before.\r\n  Let me suggest but this one thought: Do not allow any one to persuade\r\n  you that this great contest as to our tariff policy is one between\r\n  schedules. It is not a question of a seven per cent. reduction.\r\n  [Applause.] It is a question between wide-apart principles. [Cries of\r\n  \"That's right!\"]\r\n\r\n  The principle of protection, the intelligent recognition in the\r\n  framing of our tariff laws of the duty to protect our American\r\n  industries and maintain the American scale of wages by adequate\r\n  discriminating duties [cries of \"That's right!\" \"That's it!\"] on the\r\n  one hand, and on the other a denial of the constitutional right to\r\n  make our customs duties protective, or the assertion of the doctrine\r\n  that free competition with foreign products is the ideal condition to\r\n  which all our legislation should tend. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Let me now, in behalf not only of myself, but of my family, thank\r\n  you for your visit and ask you to enter our home. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOLEDO, OHIO, AUGUST 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison left Indianapolis on the morning of August 21, '88, for\r\na two weeks' outing and vacation at Middle Bass Island, Lake Erie, where\r\nhe was the guest--upon invitation of ex-Gov. Charles Foster, of Ohio--of\r\nthe Middle Bass Fishing Club, Mather Shoemaker, Sr., President.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by Mrs. Harrison, Judge Wm. A. Woods and wife, Miss\r\nWoods, Samuel Miller, and representatives of the Associated Press and\r\nCincinnati _Commercial-Gazette_.\r\n\r\nHis departure was not generally known, consequently there was no\r\ndemonstration along the line until Defiance, Ohio, was reached, where\r\nseveral hundred people had gathered. Hon. C. A. Flickinger delivered a\r\nbrief address of welcome.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, speaking from the train, said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I am very much obliged to you for this reception. You\r\n  will excuse me, I am sure, for not attempting to make any speech.\r\n  This evidence of your friendly feeling is gratifying to me. We were\r\n  intending to travel to-day in quietness, and I am confident you will\r\n  conform to our wishes in that respect by allowing me to say simply,\r\n  \"How do you do\" and \"Good-by.\"\r\n\r\nToledo was reached early in the evening, and several thousand citizens\r\nand militia welcomed the distinguished travellers. A committee of\r\nreception, comprising James M. Brown, Chairman, Mayor Hamilton, Hon.\r\nE. D. Potter, J. C. Bonner, John Berdan, C. A. King, Calvin Barker,\r\nFred Eaton, Col. S. C. Reynolds, Judge R. F. Doyle, Judge Joseph\r\nCummings, Hon. John F. Kumler, Hon. Richard Waite, Wm. Baker, and Judge\r\nAustin, escorted General Harrison and his party to the residence of Wm.\r\nCummings, whose guests they were. At night an open-air mass-meeting was\r\nheld in Memorial Hall Square, where ten thousand men assembled. Gov.\r\nFoster spoke at length, and was followed by General Harrison, who was\r\nintroduced by Hon. J. M. Brown, President of the Executive Committee\r\nUnited Republican Clubs, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--You have already been told that this reception was\r\n  not planned by me, and yet I do not regret that I have yielded to\r\n  the urgent solicitation of your representatives and have consented\r\n  to stand for a few moments in the presence of this magnificent\r\n  and instructive audience. [Applause.] I say instructive, for that\r\n  public man is dull indeed who does not gather both instruction and\r\n  inspiration from such meetings as this. [Applause.] I thank you for\r\n  any measure of personal respect and interest which your coming here\r\n  to-night may witness, but I do not see in this immense gathering any\r\n  testimony that is personal to me. I prefer to regard it as another\r\n  witness added to the long number I have seen before of the deep-seated\r\n  and earnest interest of our people in the public questions that are\r\n  to be settled in November. [Applause.] I choose rather to regard it\r\n  as a pledge that this interest you manifest in me to-night will not\r\n  stop here, but is the pledge of continued and earnest personal work\r\n  by each one of you for those principles which have won the consent of\r\n  your minds and the love of your hearts. [Applause.] I cannot enter\r\n  in any detail into the discussion of public questions; I would not\r\n  at all put myself between you and these great, important issues. I\r\n  would, in all I may say, put them to the front. We are here citizens\r\n  of a great, prosperous, magnificent Nation. We have common interests.\r\n  We are here charged with the common duties to perpetuate, if we can,\r\n  the prosperity and to maintain the honor of this great Republic.\r\n  [Applause.] We are here to-night in the enjoyment of free government.\r\n  We are here in the individual possession of better opportunities of\r\n  development, of a larger prosperity, and of more individual comfort\r\n  than are possessed by any other people in the world. [Applause.] The\r\n  great economic question as to what shall be our future legislative\r\n  policy is stated with a distinctness in this campaign that it has\r\n  never had before, and I believe the verdict and decision will have an\r\n  emphasis and finality that it has never had before. [Applause.] If\r\n  there is any one here present to-night that knows of any land that\r\n  spreads a more promising sky of hope above the heads of the poor and\r\n  the laboring man than this, I would be glad if he would name it. The\r\n  one fact that I do not need to stop to demonstrate by statistics,\r\n  the one fact that I could call out of this vast audience hundreds of\r\n  witnesses to support by their personal testimony, is that the scale of\r\n  American wages is higher than that of any other country in the world.\r\n  [Applause.] If this were not true, why is it that the workingmen and\r\n  the working-women of the older lands turn their faces hitherward? If\r\n  there is a better country, one that offers better wages, fuller hopes\r\n  than this, why is it that those who are in quest of such better things\r\n  have not found it out and turned their faces thitherward? Now, if that\r\n  is true, then why is it true, and how is it to be continued--this\r\n  condition of our country? It is because, and only because, we have for\r\n  years, by our protective tariff, discriminated in favor of American\r\n  manufacturers and American workingmen. [Applause.] Strike down this\r\n  protective system, bring our workingmen and working-women in equal\r\n  competition in the products of their toil with those who labor abroad,\r\n  and nothing is clearer than that these mills and factories must reduce\r\n  wages here to the level with wages abroad, or they must shut down. You\r\n  have the choice to make; you, the free citizens of this country, whose\r\n  ballots sway its destiny, will settle these questions in November.\r\n  [Applause.] I ask you how? Don't be deceived by the suggestion that\r\n  this is any contest over a seven per cent. reduction in the tariff\r\n  schedule. We are allowed now to say, I think, that all those who\r\n  are entitled to speak for the Democratic party have declared that\r\n  it is opposed to protection. That being so, the issue is clearly,\r\n  distinctly, strongly drawn. I beg you all--not in my interest, but\r\n  in your own; in the interest of your families and the country you\r\n  love--to ponder this question; to think upon it with that seriousness\r\n  its importance demands, and when you have thought it out, settle it,\r\n  settle it in November, so that we shall be free for years to come from\r\n  this agitation in behalf of free trade. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you again for this kindly demonstration. I beg you to accept\r\n  these brief suggestions as the only but inadequate return that I can\r\n  make you for this kindness. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUT-IN-BAY, OHIO, AUGUST 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe residents of Put-in-Bay Island, about five hundred in number,\r\ntendered General Harrison a reception on the thirty-first of August. The\r\nsteamboats from Cleveland, Detroit, Toledo, and Sandusky brought several\r\nthousand excursionists. General Harrison and his party on their arrival\r\nfrom Middle Bass Island were met at the pier by all the residents of\r\nPut-in-Bay Island, headed by their most distinguished citizen John\r\nBrown, Jr., son of the celebrated \"Ossawatomie\" Brown, of Harper's Ferry\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nFrom a pavilion in the adjacent grove John Brown introduced Hon. Charles\r\nFoster, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-citizens_--General Harrison came to Middle Bass for the\r\n  purpose of rest and quiet. At the solicitation of a number of people\r\n  of this section of country--a great number, I might say--he has kindly\r\n  consented to give a reception here to-day, upon one condition--that\r\n  he was not to make a speech. Now, fellow-citizens, I have the very\r\n  great pleasure of presenting to you General Benjamin Harrison, the\r\n  Republican candidate for the presidency. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAs Governor Foster concluded, General Harrison arose midst a shout of\r\nwelcome and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I have found Governor Foster to be a very agreeable\r\n  and thoughtful host, and I find him to-day to be the most agreeable\r\n  master of ceremonies who has ever attended me at a public reception. I\r\n  like his announcement of the condition under which I appear before you\r\n  to-day.\r\n\r\n  I never enjoy a banquet when my name is on the programme for a\r\n  toast. I do not, therefore, intend to speak to you about any of those\r\n  questions that are engaging your minds as citizens of this prosperous\r\n  and mighty and happy Nation. We are here to-day as Americans, proud\r\n  of the flag that symbolizes this great Union of States; proud of the\r\n  story that has been written by our fathers in council and in war,\r\n  in the formation and defence and perpetuation of our magnificent\r\n  institutions, We are here in the immediate neighborhood of one of\r\n  those great historic events that was among the most potential\r\n  agencies in settling our title to the great Northwest. If we had stood\r\n  where we stand to-day we could have heard the guns of Perry's fleet.\r\n  If we had stood where we stand to-day we could have welcomed him as he\r\n  came a victor into Put-in-Bay.\r\n\r\n  These institutions of ours are in our own keeping now, and not\r\n  only our fundamental institutions, but the fame that has been won\r\n  by those who have gone before. I may therefore properly say to-day\r\n  that a campaign like this demands the thoughtful consideration of\r\n  every American voter. We are prosperous. [Cheers.] The story of our\r\n  prosperity, of our development in wealth, of our achievements in\r\n  finance as a Nation, since and during the war, is almost as notable\r\n  and almost as admirable as that of our achievements in arms.\r\n\r\n  The assembling of our revenue was even more difficult than the\r\n  assembling of armies, and yet we were able to maintain those armies in\r\n  the field, and have been able since not only to bear up the great load\r\n  of debt, but to pay it off, until that which was once thought to be\r\n  a burden that would crush our industries has come to be in our hands\r\n  but as the ball the boy tosses in play [cheers]; and we are to-day\r\n  confronted with the question, not how we shall get money, but how we\r\n  shall wisely stop some of those avenues by which wealth is pouring\r\n  into our public treasury.\r\n\r\n  It is an easier problem than that which confronted the great war\r\n  Secretary, in whose name you so delight--how to raise revenue to\r\n  prosecute the war successfully. It will be wisely solved. And may I\r\n  note also the fact that, notwithstanding this complaint of excessive\r\n  revenue, there are some who suggest that they are not able adequately\r\n  to arouse the popular indignation against excessive taxation because\r\n  they cannot disclose to the people when or how they are paying the\r\n  taxes? [Applause.] It is taken, they say, so indirectly and so subtly\r\n  that these--our plain people--don't know that they are paying them at\r\n  all. [Applause.] But I must not cross this line of party discussion.\r\n  I have had a pleasant stay in this most delightful neighborhood, and\r\n  I cannot let this public opportunity pass without expressing, for\r\n  myself and for Mrs. Harrison, our grateful appreciation of the kind\r\n  and thoughtful hospitality which has been shown to us by the people of\r\n  these islands. [Prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT WAYNE, IND., SEPTEMBER 4, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison and party, _en route_ home from Middle Bass Island,\r\narrived at Toledo on the evening of Sept. 3, and were again the guests\r\nof Wm. Cummings. At night they were tendered a reception by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJohn Berdan, at their residence.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Sept. 4 the party started homeward. The first stop was\r\nat Fort Wayne, where several thousand Hoosiers welcomed their leader.\r\nSupt. Wall, of the Pittsburg and Fort Wayne Railroad, introduced the\r\ngeneral, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I desire to thank you for this cordial demonstration.\r\n  I thank you not so much for myself as for the party to which most of\r\n  us have given the consent of our minds. I am glad to know that the\r\n  people are moved to a thoughtful consideration of those questions\r\n  which are this year presented for their determination. Under a popular\r\n  government like ours it is of the first importance that every man\r\n  who votes should have some reason for his vote; that every man who\r\n  attaches himself to this or that political party should intelligently\r\n  understand both the creed and the purposes of the party to which he\r\n  belongs. I think it is universally conceded by Democrats as well\r\n  as by Republicans that the questions involved in this campaign do\r\n  have a very direct bearing upon the national prosperity, and upon\r\n  the prosperity and welfare of the individual citizen. I think it is\r\n  conceded that the result of this election will affect beneficently\r\n  or injuriously our great manufacturing interests, and will affect\r\n  for weal or for woe the workingmen and working-women who fill these\r\n  busy hives of industry. [Applause.] This much is conceded. I do not\r\n  intend to-day to argue the question in any detail. I want to call\r\n  your attention to a few general facts and principles, and the first\r\n  one--the one I never tire of mentioning; the one I deem so important\r\n  that I do not shun the charge that I am repeating myself--is this:\r\n  that the condition of the wage-workers of America is better than that\r\n  of the wage-workers of any other country in the world. [Applause.]\r\n  Now, if that be true, it is important that you should each find out\r\n  why it is so; that each one of you should determine for himself what\r\n  effect a protective tariff has had and is likely to have upon his\r\n  wages and his prosperity. Does it need to be demonstrated that if\r\n  we reduce our tariff to a revenue level, if we abolish from it every\r\n  consideration of protection, more goods will come in from abroad than\r\n  come in now? And what is the necessary effect? It is the transfer to\r\n  foreign shops of work that you need here; it is to diminish American\r\n  production and increase English production.\r\n\r\n  That is to be the effect of it. It is, not worth while to stand\r\n  upon nice definitions as to free trade. Some think it enough to say\r\n  that they are not free-traders because they are not in favor of\r\n  abolishing all customs duties. Let me remind such that the free-trade\r\n  countries of Europe, recognized to be such, have not abolished\r\n  all customs duties. A better distinction is this: The free-trader\r\n  believes in levying customs duties without any regard to the effect\r\n  of those duties upon the wages of our working people, or upon the\r\n  production of our own shops. This, then, is the issue. Take it to\r\n  your homes. There are many confusing and contradictory statements\r\n  made in the public press and by public speakers. Ask any of those\r\n  who assail our protective system whether they do not believe that if\r\n  their policy is adopted a larger amount of foreign-made goods will\r\n  come into this country. It is their purpose to increase importation\r\n  in order to cheapen prices. I think I may safely ask you to consider\r\n  the question whether this cheapening of prices, which they seem to\r\n  regard as the highest attainment of statesmanship, is consistent with\r\n  the rate of wages that our working people enjoy now, whether it will\r\n  not involve--if we are to have foreign competition without favoring\r\n  duties--a reduction of American wages to the standard of the wages\r\n  paid abroad. [Applause.] Do you believe for one moment that two\r\n  factories making the same product can be maintained in competition\r\n  when one pays thirty-three per cent. more to its workingmen than\r\n  the other? Is it not certain that wages must be equalized in those\r\n  competing establishments or the one paying the higher wages must\r\n  shut down? [Applause and cries, \"That's the thing!\"] Here in this\r\n  city of Fort Wayne, so important and so prosperous, we have a fine\r\n  illustration of the accruing advantages of a large factory and shop\r\n  population. It has made your city prosperous as well as populous, and\r\n  it has made these outlying Allen County farms vastly more valuable\r\n  than they otherwise would have been. These interests harmonize. But\r\n  I only want to ask you to think upon these questions; settle them in\r\n  your own minds, for it is agreed by all that, as they shall be settled\r\n  one way or the other, your interests and those of your families and\r\n  of this community, and of every other like community in this country,\r\n  are to be affected, favorably or unfavorably. May I not appeal to you\r\n  to review these questions, to throw off the shackles of preconceived\r\n  notions and of party prejudices, and consider them anew in the light\r\n  of all the information that is accessible to you? If you shall do\r\n  that I do not doubt that the working people of this country will this\r\n  November forever settle the question that American customs duties\r\n  shall by intention, by forethought, have regard to the wages of our\r\n  working people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  And now, if you will pardon further speech, I shall be glad to avail\r\n  myself of the arrangements which the committee have provided to greet\r\n  personally any of you who may desire to greet me. [Prolonged applause\r\n  and cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTINGTON, IND., SEPTEMBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stop was at Huntington, where two thousand people were\r\ncongregated.\r\n\r\nIn response to repeated calls General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--Our stop here is altogether too brief for me to\r\n  attempt to speak; yet I cannot refrain from expressing to you, my\r\n  friends of Huntington County, my sincere and grateful appreciation for\r\n  the evidence of your kindness in welcoming me so cordially to my home\r\n  after a brief absence. I have not travelled very far this time, but\r\n  I have seen nothing either on this visit, or any more extended visit\r\n  that I have heretofore made, to win away my interests and affection\r\n  from the great State of Indiana. [Great applause.] It is great in the\r\n  capabilities, both of its soil and its citizenship [applause]; great\r\n  in its achievements during the war. When our country was imperilled\r\n  no State more nobly or magnificently responded to the demands which\r\n  were made by the general Government for men to fight and to die for\r\n  the flag. [Applause.] I am glad to greet in this audience to-day my\r\n  comrades of the war, and all who have gathered here. I beg to thank\r\n  you again for your kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERU, IND., SEPTEMBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Peru a committee, headed by Hon. A. C. Bearss and Giles W. Smith,\r\nwaited upon General Harrison, who addressed an audience of over two\r\nthousand as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very much obliged to you for that kindness of\r\n  feeling which your gathering here to-day evinces. I have had a brief\r\n  visit for rest, and I am come back to my home with very kind feelings\r\n  toward my friends in Indiana, who have, not only during this important\r\n  campaign, but always, when I have appealed to them, treated me with\r\n  the utmost consideration. I have not time to-day to discuss the issues\r\n  of this campaign. They are extremely important, and they will have\r\n  a direct bearing upon the prosperity of our country. I can only ask\r\n  you to think of them, and not to mistake the issue. It is very plain.\r\n  It is the question of whether our tariff laws shall be a protection\r\n  to American workingmen and a protection to American manufacturing\r\n  establishments. Those who advocate tariff for revenue only do not take\r\n  any thought of our wage-workers, but let their interests take care\r\n  of themselves. On the other hand the Republican party believes that\r\n  high regard should be paid to the question what the effect will be\r\n  upon wages and upon the protection of our American shops. Those who\r\n  believe the doctrine agree with us; and those who assail it, and say\r\n  it is unconstitutional, as has recently been said by a distinguished\r\n  citizen, would destroy our protective system if they could. We must\r\n  believe so, because we must impute to them sincerity in what they\r\n  say. I believe this campaign will settle for many years to come the\r\n  question of whether legislation shall be intelligently directed in\r\n  favor of the doctrine that we will, so far as may be, see that our\r\n  farmers may find home consumers for their home product, and that these\r\n  populous manufacturing centres may give a larger value to the farms\r\n  that lie about them. You have these questions to settle. They affect\r\n  your interests as citizens. I am sure that everything that regards\r\n  them, as well as everything that regards the candidate, may be safely\r\n  left in the kind hands of these intelligent citizens of Indiana and of\r\n  the United States. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKOKOMO, IND., SEPTEMBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Kokomo welcomed the party in the evening with a brilliant\r\nillumination by natural gas. Three thousand people were present. General\r\nHarrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I very much appreciate this spontaneous evidence of\r\n  your friendliness. That so many of you should have gathered here this\r\n  evening to greet us on our return home after a brief absence from the\r\n  State is very gratifying to me. Kokomo has been for many years a very\r\n  prosperous place. It has been the happy home of a very intelligent and\r\n  very thrifty people. You are now, however, realizing a development\r\n  more rapid and much greater than the most sanguine among you could\r\n  have anticipated three years ago. The large increase in the number\r\n  and business of your manufacturing establishments, the coming here\r\n  from other parts of the country of enterprising men with their capital\r\n  to set up manufacturing plants, has excited your interest and has\r\n  promoted your development. There is not a resident of Kokomo, there\r\n  is not a resident of Howard County, who does not rejoice in this\r\n  great prosperity. I am sure there is not a man or woman in this city\r\n  who does not realize that this new condition of things gives to your\r\n  boys, who are growing up, new avenues of useful thrift. It opens to\r\n  those who might otherwise have pursued common labor access to skilled\r\n  trades and higher compensation. There is not a merchant in Kokomo who\r\n  does not appreciate the added trade which comes to his store. There\r\n  is not a farmer in Howard County who has not realized the benefits\r\n  of a home market for his crops [applause and cries of \"Good!\"], and\r\n  especially for those perishable products of the farm which do not bear\r\n  distant transportation. Now I submit to your consideration, in the\r\n  light of these new facts, whether you have not a very deep interest in\r\n  the protection of our domestic industries and the maintenance of the\r\n  American standard of wages. There can be no mistaking the issue this\r\n  year. In previous campaigns it has been observed by evasive platform\r\n  declarations. It is now so clear that all men can understand it. I\r\n  would leave this thought with you: Will the prosperity that is now\r\n  realized by you, and that greater prosperity which you anticipate, be\r\n  better advanced by the continuance of the protective policy or by its\r\n  destruction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIPTON, IND., SEPTEMBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tipton Junction, where several hundred people had congregated,\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--There is no time this evening for me to say more than\r\n  that I thank you very sincerely for this cordial evidence of your\r\n  kindly feeling. I will not have time to discuss any public questions.\r\n  You will consider them for yourselves, and can have ready access to\r\n  all necessary information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOBLESVILLE, IND., SEPTEMBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Noblesville the train was met by a special from Indianapolis, bearing\r\nthe Columbia Club, a uniformed organization of three hundred prominent\r\nyoung men, who had come to escort General Harrison to his home.\r\n\r\nTo the assembled citizens of Noblesville the general said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--You are very kind, and I am grateful for this\r\n  manifestation of your kindness. I cannot speak to you at any length\r\n  to-night. You are in the \"gas belt\" of Indiana. The result of the\r\n  discovery of this new fuel has been the rapid development of your\r\n  towns. You have shown your enterprise by hospitably opening the way\r\n  for the coming of new industrial enterprises. You have felt it worth\r\n  while not only to invite them, but to offer pecuniary inducements for\r\n  them to come. If it has been worth while to do so much in the hope\r\n  of developing your town and to add value to your farms by making a\r\n  home market for your farm product, is it not also worth your while\r\n  so to vote this fall as to save and enlarge these new industrial\r\n  enterprises? [Applause.] Let me acknowledge a new debt of gratitude\r\n  to my friends of Hamilton County, who have often before made me their\r\n  debtor, and bid you good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home-coming of General Harrison was a veritable ovation. Fifteen\r\nthousand people greeted and accompanied him to his residence, led by\r\nthe Columbia Club, the Veterans' Regiment, and the Railroad Men's Club.\r\nEscorted by Gen. Foster, Daniel M. Ransdell, and W. N. Harding, General\r\nHarrison--standing in his own door--facing the great assembly, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--Two weeks ago to-day I left Indianapolis quietly\r\n  for a brief season of rest. We met in Ohio very considerate and\r\n  hospitable friends, who allowed nothing to be lacking to the enjoyment\r\n  and comfort of our brief vacation. But, notwithstanding all the\r\n  attractions of that island home in Lake Erie, we are to-night very\r\n  happy to be again at home. The enthusiastic welcome you have extended\r\n  to us has added grace and joy. I think I may conclude that nothing has\r\n  happened since I have been gone that has disturbed your confidence\r\n  or diminished your respect. [Great applause and cries of \"No! no!\"]\r\n  At the outset of this campaign I said I would confidently commit all\r\n  that was personal to myself to the keeping of the intelligent and\r\n  fair-minded citizens of Indiana. [Applause.] We will go on our way in\r\n  this campaign upon that high and dignified plane upon which it has\r\n  been pitched, so far as it lay in our power, commending the principles\r\n  of our party to the intelligent interest of our fellow-citizens,\r\n  and trusting to truth and right for the victory. [Applause.] Most\r\n  gratefully I acknowledge the affectionate interest which has been\r\n  shown to-night by my old comrades of the war. [Applause.] I am glad\r\n  to know that in this veteran organization there are many who have\r\n  heretofore differed with me in political opinion, but who are drawn\r\n  in this campaign, by a sense of our common interests, to cast in\r\n  their influence with us. I desire also to thank the Railroad Club\r\n  for their kind greetings. There has been a special significance in\r\n  their friendly organization, and I am grateful, also, to the members\r\n  of the Columbia Club for their part in this demonstration. Now, with\r\n  an overwhelming sense of inability to respond fittingly to your\r\n  cordiality and kindness, I can only thank you once more and bid you\r\n  good-night. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the night of Sept. 6 General Harrison, in company with General A.\r\nP. Hovey, Ex-Gov. A. G. Porter, Hon. James N. Huston, Hon. R. B. F.\r\nPierce, Judge Walker, and other friends, reviewed from the balcony of\r\nthe New-Denison Hotel ten thousand marching Republicans.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most brilliant and successful demonstrations of the\r\ncampaign. The great line was composed of eighty-two Republican clubs and\r\nassociations of the city of Indianapolis, commanded by Chief Marshal\r\nHon. Geo. W. Spahr, assisted by the following mounted aids: Major Geo.\r\nHerriott, Moses G. McLain, Dan'l M. Ransdell, Thomas F. Ryan, W. H.\r\nH. Miller, John B. Elam, Dr. Austin Morris, Col. I. N. Walker, Wm.\r\nL. Taylor, W. A. Pattison, Capt. O. H. Hibben, Charles Murray, Ed.\r\nThompson, Charles Wright, S. D. Pray, J. E. Haskell, Wm. Thomas, W.\r\nH. Tucker, Joseph Forbes, Ed. Harmon, Lou Wade, John W. Bowlus, M. L.\r\nJohnson, Miles Reynolds, W. E. Tousey, R. H. Rees, and W. D. Wiles.\r\n\r\nThe column was divided into four divisions, commanded by Col. N. R.\r\nRuckle, Col. James B. Black, Horace McKay, and Hon. Stanton J. Peelle. A\r\ngreat mass-meeting followed the parade, and the issues of the campaign\r\nwere presented by General Hovey, Gov. Porter and Hon. John M. Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison on this date received perhaps the most unique\r\ndelegation of the campaign: a band of one hundred girls and misses, aged\r\nfrom seven to fifteen years, organized by Mrs. Mattie McCorkle. At their\r\nhead rode Master Charles Pettijohn, six years old, mounted upon a pony,\r\nfollowed by a drum corps of eight young boys. The girls marched four\r\nabreast, dressed in uniforms of red, white and blue, carrying mounted\r\nJapanese lanterns. They were commanded by Miss Florence Schilling. After\r\nsinging \"Marching through Georgia,\" Master Pettijohn, on behalf of the\r\nyoung ladies, presented the general a handsome bouquet and made an\r\naddress. General Harrison honored the young orator and the club with a\r\nspeech, and said:\r\n\r\n  When some one asked this afternoon, over the telephone, if I would\r\n  receive some children who wanted to pay me a visit, I gave a very\r\n  cheerful consent, because I thought I saw a chance to have a good\r\n  time. That you little ones would demand a speech from me never entered\r\n  my mind, nor did I expect to see a company so prettily uniformed and\r\n  so well drilled, both in marching and in song.\r\n\r\n  Children have always been attractive to me. I have found not only\r\n  entertainment but instruction in their companionship. Little ones\r\n  often say wise things. In the presence of such a company as this, one\r\n  who has any aspirations for the things that are good and pure cannot\r\n  fail to have them strengthened. The kind words you have addressed to\r\n  me in song come, I am sure, from sincere and loving hearts, and I am\r\n  very grateful for them and for your visit. Some of the best friends I\r\n  have are under ten years of age, and after to-night I am sure I shall\r\n  have many more, for all your names will be added.\r\n\r\n  And now I hope you will all come in where we can see you and show\r\n  you whatever there is in our home to interest you. I would like you\r\n  all to feel that we will be glad if you will come to see us often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's visitors to-day comprised six hundred G. A. R.\r\nveterans and their wives from Northwestern Kansas--_en route_ to the\r\nGrand Encampment--under the lead of General W. H. Caldwell, Frank\r\nMcGrath, C. E. Monell, W. S. Search, Dr. A. Patten, J. W. Garner, and\r\nDr. J. R. King, of Beloit, Kan. Colonel W. C. Whitney, Commander of the\r\nFirst Division, was orator, and assured General Harrison that \"Kansas\r\ngrew more corn and more babies than any other State in the Union.\" In\r\nresponse the General said:\r\n\r\n  _My Comrades_--I have a choice to make and you have one. I can\r\n  occupy the few moments I have to spare either in public address or\r\n  in private, personal greeting. I think you would prefer, as I shall\r\n  prefer, to omit the public speech that I may be presented to each of\r\n  you. [Cries of \"Good! Good!\"] I beg you, therefore, to permit me only\r\n  to say that I very heartily appreciate this greeting from my comrades\r\n  of Kansas.\r\n\r\n  The bond that binds us together as soldiers of the late war is one\r\n  that is enduring and close. No party considerations can break it; it\r\n  is stronger than political ties, and we are able thus in our Grand\r\n  Army associations to come together upon that broad and high plane\r\n  of fraternity, loyalty, and charity. [Applause and cries of \"Good!\r\n  Good!\"] Let me now, if it be your pleasure, extend a comrade's hand to\r\n  each of you. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL HARRISON'S LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INDIANAPOLIS, IND., September 11, 1888.\r\n  HON. M. M. ESTEE AND OTHERS, COMMITTEE, ETC.:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--When your committee visited me, on the Fourth of July\r\n  last, and presented the official announcement of my nomination for\r\n  the presidency of the United States by the Republican convention, I\r\n  promised as soon as practicable to communicate to you a more formal\r\n  acceptance of the nomination. Since that time the work of receiving\r\n  and addressing, almost daily, large delegations of my fellow-citizens\r\n  has not only occupied all of my time, but has in some measure rendered\r\n  it unnecessary for me to use this letter as a medium of communicating\r\n  to the public my views upon the questions involved in the campaign. I\r\n  appreciate very highly the confidence and respect manifested by the\r\n  convention, and accept the nomination with a feeling of gratitude and\r\n  a full sense of the responsibilities which accompany it.\r\n\r\n  It is a matter of congratulation that the declarations of the\r\n  Chicago convention upon the questions that now attract the interest\r\n  of our people are so clear and emphatic. There is further cause of\r\n  congratulation in the fact that the convention utterances of the\r\n  Democratic party, if in any degree uncertain or contradictory, can\r\n  now be judged and interpreted by executive acts and messages, and\r\n  by definite propositions in legislation. This is especially true of\r\n  what is popularly known as the Tariff question. The issue cannot\r\n  now be obscured. It is not a contest between schedules, but between\r\n  wide-apart principles. The foreign competitors for our market have,\r\n  with quick instinct, seen how one issue of this contest may bring them\r\n  advantage, and our own people are not so dull as to miss or neglect\r\n  the grave interests that are involved for them. The assault upon our\r\n  protective system is open and defiant. Protection is assailed as\r\n  unconstitutional in law, or as vicious in principle, and those who\r\n  hold such views sincerely cannot stop short of an absolute elimination\r\n  from our tariff laws of the principle of protection. The Mills bill is\r\n  only a step, but it is toward an object that the leaders of Democratic\r\n  thought and legislation have clearly in mind. The important question\r\n  is not so much the length of the step as the direction of it. Judged\r\n  by the executive message of December last, by the Mills bill, by the\r\n  debates in Congress, and by the St. Louis platform, the Democratic\r\n  party will, if supported by the country, place the tariff laws upon a\r\n  purely revenue basis. This is practical free trade--free trade in the\r\n  English sense. The legend upon the banner may not be \"Free Trade\"--it\r\n  may be the more obscure motto, \"Tariff Reform;\" but neither the banner\r\n  nor the inscription is conclusive, or, indeed, very important. The\r\n  assault itself is the important fact.\r\n\r\n  Those who teach that the import duty upon foreign goods sold\r\n  in our market is paid by the consumer, and that the price of the\r\n  domestic competing article is enhanced to the amount of the duty\r\n  on the imported article--that every million of dollars collected\r\n  for customs duties represents many millions more which do not reach\r\n  the treasury, but are paid by our citizens as the increased cost of\r\n  domestic productions resulting from the tariff laws--may not intend\r\n  to discredit in the minds of others our system of levying duties on\r\n  competing foreign products, but it is clearly already discredited in\r\n  their own. We cannot doubt, without impugning their integrity, that\r\n  if free to act upon their convictions they would so revise our laws\r\n  as to lay the burden of the customs revenue upon articles that are\r\n  not produced in this country, and to place upon the free list all\r\n  competing foreign products. I do not stop to refute this theory as to\r\n  the effect of our tariff duties. Those who advance it are students\r\n  of maxims and not of the markets. They may be safely allowed to call\r\n  their project \"Tariff Reform,\" if the people understand that in the\r\n  end the argument compels free trade in all competing products. This\r\n  end may not be reached abruptly, and its approach may be accompanied\r\n  with some expressions of sympathy for our protected industries and our\r\n  working people, but it will certainly come if these early steps do not\r\n  arouse the people to effective resistance.\r\n\r\n  The Republican party holds that a protective tariff is\r\n  constitutional, wholesome, and necessary. We do not offer a fixed\r\n  schedule, but a principle. We will revise the schedule, modify rates,\r\n  but always with an intelligent provision as to the effect upon\r\n  domestic productions and the wages of our working people. We believe\r\n  it to be one of the worthy objects of tariff legislation to preserve\r\n  the American market for American producers, and to maintain the\r\n  American scale of wages by adequate discriminative duties upon foreign\r\n  competing products. The effect of lower rates and larger importations\r\n  upon the public revenue is contingent and doubtful, but not so the\r\n  effect upon American production and American wages. Less work and\r\n  lower wages must be accepted as the inevitable result of the increased\r\n  offering of foreign goods in our market. By way of recompense for\r\n  this reduction in his wages, and the loss of the American market, it\r\n  is suggested that the diminished wages of the workingman will have an\r\n  undiminished purchasing power, and that he will be able to make up\r\n  for the loss of the home market by an enlarged foreign market. Our\r\n  workingmen have the settlement of the question in their own hands.\r\n  They now obtain higher wages and live more comfortably than those of\r\n  any other country. They will make choice of the substantial advantages\r\n  they have in hand and the deceptive promises and forecasts of these\r\n  theorizing reformers. They will decide for themselves and for their\r\n  country whether the protective system shall be continued or destroyed.\r\n\r\n  The fact of a treasury surplus, the amount of which is variously\r\n  stated, has directed public attention to a consideration of the\r\n  methods by which the national income may best be reduced to the level\r\n  of a wise and necessary expenditure. This condition has been seized\r\n  upon by those who are hostile to protective customs duties as an\r\n  advantageous base of attack upon our tariff laws. They have magnified\r\n  and nursed the surplus, which they affect to deprecate, seemingly\r\n  for the purpose of exaggerating the evil, in order to reconcile the\r\n  people to the extreme remedy they propose. A proper reduction of the\r\n  revenues does not necessitate, and should not suggest, the abandonment\r\n  or impairment of the protective system. The methods suggested by\r\n  our convention will not need to be exhausted in order to effect the\r\n  necessary reduction. We are not likely to be called upon, I think, to\r\n  make a present choice between the surrender of the protective system\r\n  and the entire repeal of the internal taxes. Such a contingency,\r\n  in view of the present relation of expenditures to revenues, is\r\n  remote. The inspection and regulation of the manufacture and sale of\r\n  oleomargarine is important, and the revenue derived from it is not so\r\n  great that the repeal of the law need enter into any plan of revenue\r\n  reduction. The surplus now in the treasury should be used in the\r\n  purchase of bonds. The law authorizes this use of it, and if it is not\r\n  needed for current or deficiency appropriations, the people, and not\r\n  the banks in which it has been deposited, should have the advantage\r\n  of its use by stopping interest upon the public debt. At least those\r\n  who needlessly hoard it should not be allowed to use the fear of a\r\n  monetary stringency, thus produced, to coerce public sentiment upon\r\n  other questions.\r\n\r\n  Closely connected with the subject of the tariff is that of the\r\n  importation of foreign laborers under contracts of service to be\r\n  performed here. The law now in force prohibiting such contracts\r\n  received my cordial support in the Senate, and such amendments as may\r\n  be found necessary effectively to deliver our working men and women\r\n  from this most inequitable form of competition will have my sincere\r\n  advocacy. Legislation prohibiting the importation of laborers under\r\n  contract to serve here will, however, afford very inadequate relief to\r\n  our working people if the system of protective duties is broken down.\r\n  If the products of American shops must compete in the American market,\r\n  without favoring duties, with the products of cheap foreign labor\r\n  the effect will be different, if at all, only in degree, whether the\r\n  cheap laborer is across the street or over the sea. Such competition\r\n  will soon reduce wages here to the level of those abroad, and when\r\n  that condition is reached we will not need any laws forbidding the\r\n  importation of laborers under contract--they will have no inducement\r\n  to come, and the employer no inducement to send for them.\r\n\r\n  In the earlier years of our history public agencies to promote\r\n  immigration were common. The pioneer wanted a neighbor with more\r\n  friendly instincts than the Indian. Labor was scarce and fully\r\n  employed. But the day of the immigration bureau has gone by. While\r\n  our doors will continue open to proper immigration, we do not need to\r\n  issue special invitations to the inhabitants of other countries to\r\n  come to our shores or to share our citizenship. Indeed, the necessity\r\n  of some inspection and limitation is obvious. We should resolutely\r\n  refuse to permit foreign governments to send their paupers and\r\n  criminals to our ports. We are also clearly under a duty to defend our\r\n  civilization by excluding alien races whose ultimate assimilation\r\n  with our people is neither possible nor desirable. The family has been\r\n  the nucleus of our best immigration, and the home the most potent\r\n  assimilating force in our civilization.\r\n\r\n  The objections to Chinese immigration are distinctive and\r\n  conclusive, and are now so generally accepted as such that the\r\n  question has passed entirely beyond the stage of argument. The laws\r\n  relating to this subject would, if I should be charged with their\r\n  enforcement, be faithfully executed. Such amendments or further\r\n  legislation as may be necessary and proper to prevent evasions of\r\n  the laws and to stop further Chinese immigration would also meet my\r\n  approval. The expression of the convention upon this subject is in\r\n  entire harmony with my views.\r\n\r\n  Our civil compact is a government by majorities, and the law loses\r\n  its sanction and the magistrate our respect when this compact is\r\n  broken. The evil results of election frauds do not expend themselves\r\n  upon the voters who are robbed of their rightful influence in\r\n  public affairs. The individual or community or party that practises\r\n  or connives at election frauds has suffered irreparable injury,\r\n  and will sooner or later realize that to exchange the American\r\n  system of majority rule for minority control is not only unlawful\r\n  and unpatriotic, but very unsafe for those who promote it. The\r\n  disfranchisement of a single legal elector by fraud or intimidation is\r\n  a crime too grave to be regarded lightly. The right of every qualified\r\n  elector to cast one free ballot and to have it honestly counted must\r\n  not be questioned. Every constitutional power should be used to make\r\n  this right secure and to punish frauds upon the ballot.\r\n\r\n  Our colored people do not ask special legislation in their\r\n  interest, but only to be made secure in the common rights of American\r\n  citizenship. They will, however, naturally mistrust the sincerity\r\n  of those party leaders who appeal to their race for support only in\r\n  those localities where the suffrage is free and election results\r\n  doubtful, and compass their disfranchisement where their votes would\r\n  be controlling and their choice cannot be coerced.\r\n\r\n  The Nation, not less than the States, is dependent for prosperity\r\n  and security upon the intelligence and morality of the people. This\r\n  common interest very early suggested national aid in the establishment\r\n  and endowment of schools and colleges in the new States. There is,\r\n  I believe, a present exigency that calls for still more liberal and\r\n  direct appropriations in aid of common-school education in the States.\r\n\r\n  The territorial form of government is a temporary expedient, not\r\n  a permanent civil condition. It is adapted to the exigency that\r\n  suggested it, but becomes inadequate, and even oppressive, when\r\n  applied to fixed and populous communities. Several Territories are\r\n  well able to bear the burdens and discharge the duties of free\r\n  commonwealths in the American Union. To exclude them is to deny the\r\n  just rights of their people, and may well excite their indignant\r\n  protest. No question of the political preference of the people of a\r\n  Territory should close against them the hospitable door which has\r\n  opened to two-thirds of the existing States. But admissions should be\r\n  resolutely refused to any Territory a majority of whose people cherish\r\n  institutions that are repugnant to our civilization or inconsistent\r\n  with a republican form of government.\r\n\r\n  The declaration of the convention against \"all combinations of\r\n  capital, organized in trusts or otherwise, to control arbitrarily the\r\n  condition of trade among our citizens,\" is in harmony with the views\r\n  entertained and publicly expressed by me long before the assembling\r\n  of the convention. Ordinarily, capital shares the losses of idleness\r\n  with labor; but under the operation of the trust, in some of its\r\n  forms, the wageworker alone suffers loss, while idle capital receives\r\n  its dividends from a trust fund. Producers who refuse to join the\r\n  combination are destroyed, and competition as an element of prices is\r\n  eliminated. It cannot be doubted that the legislative authority should\r\n  and will find a method of dealing fairly and effectively with those\r\n  and other abuses connected with this subject.\r\n\r\n  It can hardly be necessary for me to say that I am heartily in\r\n  sympathy with the declaration of the convention upon the subject of\r\n  pensions to our soldiers and sailors. What they gave and what they\r\n  suffered I had some opportunity to observe, and, in a small measure,\r\n  to experience. They gave ungrudgingly; it was not a trade, but an\r\n  offering. The measure was heaped up, running over. What they achieved\r\n  only a distant generation can adequately tell. Without attempting to\r\n  discuss particular propositions, I may add that measures in behalf of\r\n  the surviving veterans of the war and of the families of their dead\r\n  comrades should be conceived and executed in a spirit of justice and\r\n  of the most grateful liberality, and that, in the competition for\r\n  civil appointments, honorable military service should have appropriate\r\n  recognition.\r\n\r\n  The law regulating appointments to the classified civil service\r\n  received my support in the Senate in the belief that it opened the way\r\n  to a much-needed reform. I still think so, and, therefore, cordially\r\n  approve the clear and forcible expression of the convention upon this\r\n  subject. The law should have the aid of a friendly interpretation\r\n  and be faithfully and vigorously enforced. All appointments under it\r\n  should be absolutely free from partisan considerations and influence.\r\n  Some extensions of the classified list are practicable and desirable,\r\n  and further legislation extending the reform to other branches of\r\n  the service to which it is applicable would receive my approval. In\r\n  appointment to every grade and department, fitness, and not party\r\n  service, should be the essential and discriminating test, and fidelity\r\n  and efficiency the only sure tenure of office. Only the interests of\r\n  the public service should suggest removals from office. I know the\r\n  practical difficulties attending the attempt to apply the spirit of\r\n  the civil service rules to all appointments and removals. It will,\r\n  however, be my sincere purpose, if elected, to advance the reform.\r\n\r\n  I notice with pleasure that the convention did not omit to express\r\n  its solicitude for the promotion of virtue and temperance among our\r\n  people. The Republican party has always been friendly to everything\r\n  that tended to make the home life of our people free, pure, and\r\n  prosperous, and will in the future be true to its history in this\r\n  respect.\r\n\r\n  Our relations with foreign powers should be characterized by\r\n  friendliness and respect. The right of our people and of our ships\r\n  to hospitable treatment should be insisted upon with dignity and\r\n  firmness. Our Nation is too great, both in material strength\r\n  and in moral power, to indulge in bluster or to be suspected of\r\n  timorousness. Vacillation and inconsistency are as incompatible\r\n  with successful diplomacy as they are with the national dignity. We\r\n  should especially cultivate and extend our diplomatic and commercial\r\n  relations with the Central and South American States. Our fisheries\r\n  should be fostered and protected. The hardships and risks that are\r\n  the necessary incidents of the business should not be increased by an\r\n  inhospitable exclusion from the near-lying ports. The resources of a\r\n  firm, dignified, and consistent diplomacy are undoubtedly equal to the\r\n  prompt and peaceful solution of the difficulties that now exist. Our\r\n  neighbors will surely not expect in our ports a commercial hospitality\r\n  they deny to us in theirs.\r\n\r\n  I cannot extend this letter by a special reference to other subjects\r\n  upon which the convention gave an expression.\r\n\r\n  In respect to them, as well as to those I have noticed, I am\r\n  in entire agreement with the declarations of the convention. The\r\n  resolutions relating to the coinage, to the rebuilding of the navy,\r\n  to coast defences, and to public lands, express conclusions to all of\r\n  which I gave my support in the Senate.\r\n\r\n  Inviting a calm and thoughtful consideration of these public\r\n  questions, we submit them to the people. Their intelligent patriotism\r\n  and the good Providence that made and has kept us a Nation will lead\r\n  them to wise and safe conclusions.\r\n\r\n          Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n                                            BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAYTON, IND., SEPTEMBER 13.\r\n\r\n_Reunion of the Seventieth Indiana Regiment._\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, accompanied by Mrs. Harrison and Mrs. McKee, on\r\nSeptember 13 attended the fourteenth reunion of the Seventieth Indiana\r\nRegimental Association at Clayton village, Hendricks County.\r\n\r\nThe Seventieth Regiment was recruited from the counties of Hendricks,\r\nJohnson and Marion. Of the one hundred and fifty-nine regiments sent to\r\nthe front by Indiana, but few, if any, achieved a more honorable and\r\ndistinguished record. It was the first regiment to report for duty under\r\nPresident Lincoln's call of July, '62, and was recruited in less than a\r\nmonth by Second Lieutenant Benjamin Harrison.\r\n\r\nAfter the regiment had been recruited Lieutenant Harrison was elected\r\nCaptain of Company A, and when the regiment was organized, August\r\n7, 1862, Captain Harrison was commissioned its colonel. It left\r\nIndianapolis for the front August 13, 1862, and returned thirty-four\r\nmonths later, with a loss of 189 men. It participated in eleven\r\nengagements, including Resaca, Kenesaw, Marietta, Peach Tree Creek,\r\nAtlanta, Savannah and Bentonville. The regiment was a part of Sherman's\r\narmy, and was attached to the First Brigade, Third Division, Twentieth\r\nCorps. For several years past General Harrison has been successively\r\nchosen President of the Regimental Association.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred veterans, with their families, accompanied the General\r\nfrom Indianapolis, and were greeted at Clayton by five thousand people.\r\nThree hundred veterans of the Seventieth saluted their Colonel as\r\nhe walked to the front and, assuming command, led the column to a\r\nneighboring grove, where the exercises of the day were held. It was the\r\nlargest reunion in the history of the Association. Among the prominent\r\nnon-resident members in attendance were Lieutenant-Colonel James Burghs,\r\nof Topeka; Capt. Wm. M. Meredith, Chicago (he was captain of Company\r\nE, the color company of the regiment); Captain Tansey, now Judge,\r\nof Winfield, Kansas; Captain Willis Record, of Nebraska; Lieutenant\r\nHardenbrook and Private Snow, of Kansas, and Cyrus Butterfield, of\r\nMinneapolis. The orator of the day was Comrade J. M. Brown.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, as President of the Association, presided. The\r\nproceedings were opened with prayer by Comrade J. H. Meteer, followed by\r\nan address of welcome by Miss Mary L. Mitchell, daughter of Captain W.\r\nC. Mitchell, who directed her closing remarks to General Harrison.\r\n\r\nWith great earnestness the General replied as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Miss Mitchell_--I feel quite incompetent to discharge the duty\r\n  that now devolves upon me--that of making suitable response to the\r\n  touching, cordial and sympathetic words which you have addressed to\r\n  us. We thank you and the good citizens of Clayton, for whom you have\r\n  spoken, that you have opened your hearts so fully to us to-day. I am\r\n  sure we have never assembled under circumstances more attractive than\r\n  those that now surround us. The mellow sunshine of this autumn-time\r\n  that falls upon us, the balmy air which moves the leaves of those\r\n  shadowing trees, the sweet calm and spell of nature that is over\r\n  everything, makes the day one of those that may be described in the\r\n  language of the old poet as\r\n\r\n             \"A bridal of the earth and sky.\"\r\n\r\n  Your hospitable welcome makes us feel at home, and in behalf of this\r\n  large representation of our regiment, possibly the largest that has\r\n  assembled since the close of the war, gathered not only from these\r\n  adjacent counties, but from distant homes beyond the Mississippi and\r\n  the Missouri, I give you to-day in return our most hearty thanks for\r\n  your great kindness.\r\n\r\n  The autumn-time is a fit time for our gathering, for our spring-time\r\n  is gone. It was in the spring-time of our lives that we heard our\r\n  country's call. Full of vigor and youth and patriotism, we responded\r\n  to it. The exhaustion of march and camp and battle, and the civil\r\n  strife of the years that have passed since the close of the war,\r\n  have left their marks upon us, and, as we gather from year to year,\r\n  we notice the signs of advancing age, and the roster of our dead is\r\n  lengthened. We are reminded by the minutes of our last meeting, that\r\n  have been read, of the presence at our last reunion of that faithful\r\n  and beloved officer who went out from this county, Major Reagan.\r\n  With a prophetic instinct of what was before him, he told us then\r\n  that it was probably the last time that he should gather with us.\r\n  God has verified the thought that was in his mind, and that simple,\r\n  true-hearted, brave comrade has been enrolled with the larger company.\r\n  We are glad to-day to be together, yet our gladness is sobered. As I\r\n  look into those familiar faces I notice a deep sense of satisfaction,\r\n  but I have not failed to observe that there are tears in many eyes.\r\n  We are not moved to tears by any sense of regret that we gave some\r\n  service to our country and to its flag, but only by the sense that we\r\n  are not all here to-day, and that all who are here will never gather\r\n  again in a meeting like this. We rejoice that we were permitted to\r\n  make some contribution to the glory and credit and perpetuity of the\r\n  Nation we love. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Comrades who served under other regimental flags and who have\r\n  gathered here with us to-day, we do not boast of higher motives or\r\n  greater service than yours. We welcome you to a participation in\r\n  our reunion. We fully acknowledge that you had a full--possibly a\r\n  fuller--share than we in the great achievements of the war. We claim\r\n  only this for the Seventieth Indiana--that we went into the service\r\n  with the full purpose to respond to every order [cries of \"That's\r\n  so!\"], and that we never evaded a fight or turned our backs to the\r\n  enemy. [Applause.] We are not here to exalt ourselves, but I cannot\r\n  omit to say that a purer, truer self-consecration to the flag and\r\n  country was never offered than by you and your dead comrades who, in\r\n  1862, mustered for the defence of the Union. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It was not in the heyday of success, it was not under the impression\r\n  that sixty days would end the war, that you were mustered. It was when\r\n  the clouds hung low and disasters were thick. Buell was returning\r\n  from the Tennessee, Kirby Smith coming through Cumberland Gap, and\r\n  McClellan had been defeated on the Peninsula. It seemed as if the\r\n  frown of God was on our cause. It was then, in that hour of stress,\r\n  that you pledged your hearts and lives to the country [applause], in\r\n  the sober realization that the war was a desperate one, in which\r\n  thousands were to die. We are glad that God has spared us to see the\r\n  magnificent development and increase in strength and honor which has\r\n  come to us as a Nation, and in the glory that has been woven into the\r\n  flag we love. [Great applause.] We are glad that with most of us the\r\n  struggle in life has not left us defeat, if it has not crowned us with\r\n  the highest successes. We are veterans and yet citizens, pledged, each\r\n  according to his own conscience and thought, to do that which will\r\n  best promote the glory of our country and best conserve and set in\r\n  our public measures those patriotic thoughts and purposes that took\r\n  us into the war. [Applause.] It is my wish to-day that every relation\r\n  I occupy to the public or to a political party might be absolutely\r\n  forgotten [cries of \"Good! good!\"], and that I might for this day,\r\n  among these comrades, be thought of only as a comrade--your old\r\n  Colonel. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  Nothing has given me more pleasure on this occasion than to notice,\r\n  as I passed through your streets, so beautifully and so tastefully\r\n  decorated, that the poles that have been reared by the great parties\r\n  were intertwined [applause]--and now I remind myself that I am not\r\n  the orator of this occasion [cries of \"Go on!\"], but its presiding\r\n  officer. The right discharge of that duty forbids much talking.\r\n\r\n  Comrades of the Seventieth Indiana, comrades of all these associated\r\n  regiments, I am glad to meet you. Nothing shall sever that bond, I\r\n  hope. Nothing that I shall ever say, nothing that I shall ever do,\r\n  will weaken it. And now, if you will permit me again to acknowledge\r\n  the generous hospitality of this community, and in your behalf to\r\n  return them our most sincere thanks, I will close these remarks and\r\n  proceed with the programme which has been provided.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison was unanimously re-elected President of the\r\nAssociation, Colonel Samuel Merrill Vice-President, M. G. McLean\r\nSecretary, Major James L. Mitchell Treasurer.\r\n\r\nWhen the motion was put by one of the veterans on the adoption of\r\nthe report re-electing General Harrison to the presidency of the\r\nAssociation, the veterans answered with a \"Yea\" that brought cheer upon\r\ncheer from the crowd.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, visibly affected, simply said: \"I feel myself crowned\r\nagain to-day by this evidence of comradeship of the old soldiers of the\r\nSeventieth Indiana.\" [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nOn his return from Clayton, General Harrison was visited at his\r\nresidence by fifty veterans of Potter Post, G. A. R., Sycamore, Ill.,\r\n_en route_ home from the Columbus encampment. They were introduced by\r\nGeneral E. F. Dutton, colonel of the One Hundred and Fifth Illinois\r\nInfantry, and commander of the Second Brigade, Third Division of the\r\nTwentieth Army Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll trains arriving from the East this day brought large delegations of\r\nhomeward-bound veterans from the Columbus, Ohio, encampment. The first\r\nto arrive was one hundred veterans of Ransom Post, St. Louis--General\r\nSherman's Post--who were introduced by Col. Murphy. General Harrison,\r\nresponding to their greeting, said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades_--I esteem it a pleasure to be able to associate with you\r\n  by the use of that form of address. I know of no human organization\r\n  that can give a better reason for its existence than the Grand Army of\r\n  the Republic. [Cries of \"Good!\"] It needs no argument to justify it;\r\n  it stands unassailable, and admits of no criticism from any quarter.\r\n  Its members have rendered that service to their country in war, and\r\n  they maintain now, in peace, that honorable, courageous citizenship\r\n  that entitles them to every patriot's respect. I thank you for this\r\n  visit, and will be glad if you will now allow me to welcome you to my\r\n  home.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the streets of Indianapolis were overflowing with\r\nmarching veterans from Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, and\r\nKansas, headed by the National Drum Corps of Minneapolis, and commanded\r\nby Department Commander Col. James A. Sexton, of Chicago, and a\r\nbrilliant staff. The great column passed through the city out to the\r\nHarrison residence. Conspicuous at the head of the line marched the\r\ndistinguished Governor of Wisconsin, General Jere M. Rusk, surrounded\r\nby his staff of seventeen crippled veterans, among whom were Capt. E.\r\nG. Fimme, Secretary of State of Wisconsin; Col. H. B. Harshaw, State\r\nTreasurer; C. E. Estabrook, Attorney-General; Philip Cheek, Insurance\r\nCommissioner; Col. H. P. Fischer, Maj. J. R. Curran, Maj. F. L.\r\nPhillips, Maj. F. H. Conse; Captains W. W. Jones, H. W. Lovejoy, and W.\r\nH. McFarland. Eighty members of the Woman's Relief Corps accompanied\r\nthe veterans, and were given positions of honor at the reception.\r\nWhen General Harrison appeared he was tendered an ovation. Governor\r\nRusk said: \"Comrades--I consider it both an honor and a pleasure in\r\nintroducing to you the President of the United States for the next eight\r\nyears--General Benjamin Harrison.\" [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Rusk, Comrades of the Grand Army, and Ladies_--I did not\r\n  suppose that the Constitution of our country would be subjected to\r\n  so serious a fracture by the executive of one of our great States.\r\n  [Laughter.] Four years is the constitutional term of the President.\r\n  [Laughter.] I am glad to see you; I return your friendly greetings\r\n  most heartily. Your association is a most worthy one. As I said to\r\n  some comrades who visited me this morning, it has the best reason for\r\n  its existence of any human organization that I know of. [Applause.] I\r\n  am glad to know that your recent encampment at Columbus was so largely\r\n  attended, and was in all its circumstances so magnificent a success.\r\n  The National Encampment of the G. A. R. is an honor to any city. The\r\n  proudest may well array itself in its best attire to welcome the\r\n  Union veterans of the late war. In these magnificent gatherings, so\r\n  impressive in numbers and so much more impressive in the associations\r\n  they revive, there is a great teaching force. If it is worth while\r\n  to build monuments to heroism and patriotic sacrifice that may stand\r\n  as dumb yet eloquent instructors of the generation that is to come,\r\n  so it is worth while that these survivors of the war assemble in\r\n  their national encampments and march once more, unarmed, through the\r\n  streets of our cities, whose peace and prosperity they have secured.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Every man and every woman should do them honor. We have a body of\r\n  citizen soldiers instructed in tactics and strategy and accustomed to\r\n  the points of war that make this Nation very strong and formidable.\r\n  I well remember that even in the second year of the war instructors\r\n  in tactics were rare in our own camps. They are very numerous now.\r\n  [Laughter.] Yet, while this Nation was never so strong in a great\r\n  instructed, trained body of veteran soldiers, I think it was never\r\n  more strongly smitten with the love of peace. The man that would\r\n  rather fight than eat has not survived the last war. [Laughter.] He\r\n  was laid away in an early grave or enrolled on the list of deserters.\r\n  But he would be mistaken who supposes that all the hardships of the\r\n  war--its cruel, hard memories--would begin to frighten those veterans\r\n  from the front if the flag was again assailed or the national security\r\n  or dignity imperilled. [Applause and cries of \"You are right!\"] The\r\n  war was also an educator in political economy.\r\n\r\n  These veterans, who saw how the poverty of the South in the\r\n  development of her manufacturing interests paralyzed the skill of\r\n  her soldiers and the generalship of her captains, have learned to\r\n  esteem and value our diversified manufacturing interests. [Applause.]\r\n  You know that woollen mills and flocks would have been more valuable\r\n  to the Confederacy than battalions; that foundries and arsenals and\r\n  skilled mechanical labor was the great lack of the Confederacy. You\r\n  have learned that lesson so well that you will not wish our rescued\r\n  country, by any fatal free-trade policy, to be brought to a like\r\n  condition. [Applause and cries of \"Good! good!\"] And now, gentlemen, I\r\n  had a stipulation that I was not to speak at all. [Laughter.] You will\r\n  surely allow me now to stop this formal address, and to welcome my\r\n  comrades to our home. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison held three receptions this date. The first was tendered\r\nthe Scott Rifles of Kansas City, all members of the G. A. R., _en route_\r\nhome from the Columbus encampment. They wore the regulation blue uniform\r\nand carried muskets. Captain Brant introduced his company, stating that\r\nin bringing their arms with them \"they did not intend to do General\r\nHarrison any violence.\" The General responded:\r\n\r\n  _Captain and Comrades_--I did not need to be assured that comrades\r\n  of the Grand Army, whether bearing arms or not, brought me no peril.\r\n  No loyal and orderly citizen will mistrust their friendliness. The\r\n  people of Indiana will not ask that you procure any permit or give\r\n  bond to keep the peace before passing through this loyal State with\r\n  arms in your hands.\r\n\r\n  I am especially complimented by the visit of this organized company\r\n  of the Missouri militia, composed wholly of Union veterans. It gives\r\n  evidence that those who served in the Civil War are still watchful of\r\n  the honor and safety of our country and its flag; that our Government\r\n  may rest with security upon the defence which our citizen-soldiers\r\n  offer.\r\n\r\n  And now, without alluding at all to any topic of partisan interest,\r\n  I bid you welcome, and will be pleased to have a personal introduction\r\n  to each of you, if that is your pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe second reception was extended to a delegation of twelve hundred\r\nworkingmen from New Albany, Floyd County, organized into political\r\nclubs, among whose leaders were Walter B. Godfrey, M. Y. Mallory,\r\nGeo. B. Cardwell, M. M. Hurley, W. A. Maynor, Andrew Fite, Chas. R.\r\nClarke, J. W. Edmonson, L. L. Pierce, Horace Brown, N. D. Morris, T. W.\r\nArmstrong, D. C. Anthony, John Hahn, R. E. Burke, Albert Hopkins, F.\r\nD. Connor, Frank Norton, M. McDonald, M. H. Sparks, W. H. Russell, J.\r\nN. Peyton, Daniel Prosser, Geo. Roberts, and G. H. Pennington. A band\r\nof G. A. R. veterans from far-off Texas happened to be present at the\r\nreception, among them Col. J. C. De Gress, Wm. Long, John Herman, S. C.\r\nSlade, W. H. Nye, W. H. Tuttle, Geo. A. Knight, and Dr. S. McKay. James\r\nA. Atkinson, a glassblower of the De Pauw works at New Albany, delivered\r\nan able address on behalf of the visitors. General Harrison responded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--There is something very distinctive, very\r\n  interesting, and very instructive in this large delegation of\r\n  workingmen from the city of New Albany. Your fellow-workman and\r\n  spokesman has so eloquently presented that particular issue upon which\r\n  you have the greatest interest that I can add nothing to the force\r\n  or conclusiveness of his argument. He has said that the interests\r\n  of the workingmen were especially involved in the pending political\r\n  contest. I think that is conceded even by our political opponents.\r\n  I do not think there is a man so dull or so unfair as to deny that\r\n  the reduction of our tariff rates so as to destroy the principle of\r\n  protection now embodied in our laws will have an influence on your\r\n  wages and on the production of your mills and factories. If this be\r\n  true, then your interest in the question is apparent. You will want to\r\n  know whether the influence of the proposed reduction of rates is to\r\n  be beneficial or hurtful; whether the effect will be to stimulate or\r\n  diminish production; whether it will be to maintain or increase the\r\n  rate of wages you are now receiving, or to reduce them. As you shall\r\n  settle these questions, so will you vote in November. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  No man can doubt that a reduction of duties will stimulate the\r\n  importation of foreign merchandise. None of these plate-glass workers\r\n  can doubt that a reduction of the duty upon plate-glass will increase\r\n  the importation of French plate-glass.\r\n\r\n  None of these workers in your woollen mills can doubt that the\r\n  reduction of the duty upon the product of their mills will increase\r\n  the importation of foreign woollen goods.\r\n\r\n  And, if that is true, is it not also clear that this increased\r\n  importation of foreign-made goods means some idle workingmen in your\r\n  mills? The party that favors such discriminating duties as will\r\n  develop American production and secure the largest amount of work\r\n  for our American shops is the party whose policy will promote your\r\n  interests. [Applause and cries of \"Hit him again!\"] I have heard it\r\n  said by some leaders of Democratic thought that the reduction proposed\r\n  by the Mills bill, and the further reduction which some of them are\r\n  candid enough to admit they contemplate, will stimulate American\r\n  production by opening foreign markets and that the interests of our\r\n  Indiana manufacturing establishments would thus be promoted. But those\r\n  who advance this argument also say that it will not do to progress\r\n  too rapidly in the direction of free trade--that we must go slowly,\r\n  because our protected industries cannot stand too rapid an advance;\r\n  it would not be safe. [Laughter.] Now, my countrymen, if this plan of\r\n  revenue reform is to be promotive of our manufacturing interests, why\r\n  go slowly? Why not open the gates wide and let us have the promised\r\n  good all at once? [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  Is it that these philosophers think the cup of prosperity will\r\n  be so sweet and full that our laboring people cannot be allowed to\r\n  drink it at one draught? [Applause and cries of \"Good! good!\"] No,\r\n  my countrymen, this statement implies what these gentlemen know to\r\n  be true--that the effect of the proposed legislation is diminished\r\n  production and diminished wages, and they desire that you shall have\r\n  an opportunity to get used to it. [Applause.] But I cannot press\r\n  this discussion further. I want to thank you for the cordial things\r\n  you have said to me by him who has spoken for you. I trust, and have\r\n  always trusted, the intelligence and conscience of our working people.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  They will inevitably find out the truth, and when they find it they\r\n  will justify it. Therefore, there are many things that have been said\r\n  to which I have not and shall not allude while this contest is on.\r\n  They are with you: the truth is accessible to you, and you will find\r\n  it. Now, thanking you most heartily for the personal respect you have\r\n  evidenced, and congratulating you upon your intelligent devotion to\r\n  that great American system which has spread a sky of hope above you\r\n  and your children, I bid you good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe crowning event of the day was the reception of several hundred\r\nmembers of the Irish-American Republican Club of Cook County and\r\nChicago. The visitors were met by the Home Irish-American Protection\r\nClub, Patrick A. Ward, President, assisted by the Columbia Club and\r\nseveral thousand citizens. Their demonstration was one of the most\r\nnotable of the campaign. This club was the first political organization\r\nin the country to congratulate General Harrison on his nomination. The\r\nevening of June 25 the club met and adopted the following, which was\r\ntelegraphed the General:\r\n\r\n  The Irish-American Republican Club of Cook County, Illinois,\r\n  congratulate you and the country upon your nomination. We greet\r\n  the gallant soldier and true American, and rejoice with our\r\n  fellow-citizens of every nationality in the glad assurance your\r\n  nomination gives that the industries of our country will be protected\r\n  and the honor of the Nation maintained with the same courage and\r\n  devotion that distinguished you on the bloody field of Resaca. We\r\n  salute the next President of the Republic.\r\n\r\n                                       NATHAN P. BRADY, _President_.\r\n\r\nLeaders of the delegation were Hon. John F. Finerty, F. J. Gleason,\r\nDennis Ward, Richard Powers, and Messrs. Russell and O'Morey. Thomas\r\nF. Byron, of Lowell, Mass., founder of the Land League in America,\r\naccompanied the club. In the absence of President Brady their spokesman\r\nwas Mr. John F. Beggs. General Harrison delivered one of his happiest\r\nresponses. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Beggs and my Friends of the Irish-American Republican\r\n  Club of Cook County, Ill._--You were Irishmen, you are Americans\r\n  [cheers]--Irish-Americans [continued cheering], and though you have\r\n  given the consecrated loyalty of your honest hearts to the starry flag\r\n  and your adopted country, you have not and you ought not to forget\r\n  to love and venerate the land of your nativity. [Great applause.] If\r\n  you could forget Ireland, if you could be unmoved by her minstrelsy,\r\n  untouched by the appeals of her splendid oratory, unsympathetic with\r\n  her heroes and martyrs, I should fear that the bonds of your new\r\n  citizenship would have no power over hearts so cold and consciences so\r\n  dead. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  What if a sprig of green were found upon the bloody jacket of a\r\n  Union soldier who lay dead on Missionary Ridge? The flag he died for\r\n  was his flag and the green was only a memory and an inspiration.\r\n\r\n  We, native or Irish born, join with the Republican convention in\r\n  the hope that the cause of Irish home rule, progressing under the\r\n  leadership of Gladstone and Parnell [cheers] upon peaceful and lawful\r\n  lines, may yet secure for Ireland that which as Americans we so much\r\n  value--local home rule. [Cheering.] I am sure that you who have,\r\n  in your own persons or in your worthy representatives, given such\r\n  convincing evidence of your devotion to the American Constitution\r\n  and flag and to American institutions will not falter in this great\r\n  civil contest which your spokesman has so fittingly described. Who,\r\n  if not Irish-Americans versed in the sad story of the commercial\r\n  ruin of the island they love, should be instructed in the beneficent\r\n  influence of a protective tariff? [Continuous cheering.] Who, if not\r\n  Irish-Americans should be able to appreciate the friendly influences\r\n  of the protective system upon their individual and upon their home\r\n  life? Which of you has not realized that not the lot of man only, but\r\n  the lot of woman, has been made softer and easier under its influence?\r\n  [Applause and \"Hear! hear!\"] Contrast the American mother and wife,\r\n  burdened only with the cares of motherhood and of the household, with\r\n  the condition of women in many of the countries of the Old World,\r\n  where she is loaded also with the drudgery of toil in the field.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I know that none more than Irishmen, who are so characterized by\r\n  their deference for women, and whose women have so fitly illustrated\r\n  that which is pure in female character, will value this illustration\r\n  of the good effects of our American system upon the home life.\r\n  [Continued applause.]\r\n\r\n  There are nations across the sea who are hungry for the American\r\n  market. They are waiting with eager expectation for the adoption of\r\n  a free-trade policy by the United States. [Cries of \"That will never\r\n  happen!\"] The English manufacturer is persuaded that an increased\r\n  market for English goods in America is good for him, but I think it\r\n  will be impossible to persuade the American producer and the American\r\n  workman that it is good for them. [Applause and cries of \"That's\r\n  right!\"] I believe that social order, that national prosperity, are\r\n  bound up in the preservation of our existing policy. [Loud cheering\r\n  and cries of \"You are right!\"] I do not believe that a republic can\r\n  live and prosper whose wage-earners do not receive enough to make life\r\n  comfortable, who do not have some upward avenues of hope open before\r\n  them. When the wage-earners of the land lose hope, when the star goes\r\n  out, social order is impossible, and after that anarchy or the Czar.\r\n  [Cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I gratefully acknowledge the compliment of your call, and\r\n  exceedingly regret that the storm without made it impossible for me\r\n  to receive you at my house. [Applause and cries of \"Thanks! thanks!\"]\r\n  I will now be glad to take each member of your club by the hand.\r\n  [Continued cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's callers to-day numbered about five thousand, over\r\nhalf of whom came from Vermilion County, Illinois, led by a company of\r\nyoung ladies, in uniform, from the town of Sidell. Hon. Samuel Stansbury\r\nof Danville was Marshal of the delegation, aided by E. C. Boudinot, D.\r\nG. Moore, Chas. A. Allen, J. G. Thompson, and W. C. Cowan. Col. W. R.\r\nJewell, editor Danville _Daily News_, was spokesman. General Harrison,\r\nin response, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Illinois Friends_--The people of your State were very early\r\n  in giving evidence to our people and to me that they are deeply and\r\n  generally interested in this campaign. I welcome you and accept\r\n  your coming as evidence that the early interest you manifested has\r\n  suffered no abatement. It was not an impulse that stirred you, but\r\n  a deep conviction that matters of great and lasting consequence to\r\n  your country are involved in this campaign. Your representative in\r\n  Congress, Hon. Joseph Cannon, is well known in Indiana. [Applause.]\r\n  I have known him for many years; have observed his conduct in the\r\n  National Congress, and always with admiration. He is a fearless,\r\n  aggressive, honest Republican leader. [Applause and cries of \"Good!\r\n  good!\"] He is worthy of the favor and confidence you have shown him.\r\n\r\n  If some one were to ask to-day, \"What is the matter with the United\r\n  States?\" [laughter and cries of \"She's all right!\"] I am sure we would\r\n  hear some Democratic friend respond, \"Its people are oppressed and\r\n  impoverished by tariff taxation.\" [Laughter.] Ordinarily our people\r\n  can be trusted to know when they are taxed; but this Democratic friend\r\n  will tell us that the tariff tax is so insidious that our people pay\r\n  it without knowing it. That is a very unhappy condition, indeed. But\r\n  his difficulties are not all surmounted when he has convinced his\r\n  hearers that a customs duty is a tax, for history does not run well\r\n  with his statement that our people have been impoverished by our\r\n  tariff system. Another answer to your question will be perhaps that\r\n  there is now a great surplus in the Treasury--he will probably not\r\n  state the figures, for there seems to be a painful uncertainty about\r\n  that. I have sometimes thought that this surplus was held chiefly to\r\n  be talked about. The laws provide a use for it that would speedily\r\n  place it in circulation. If a business man finds an accumulated\r\n  surplus that he does not need in his business, that stands as a bank\r\n  balance and draws no interest, and if he has notes outside to mature\r\n  in the future he will make a ready choice between leaving his balance\r\n  in the bank and using it to take up his obligations. [Applause.]\r\n  But in our national finances the other choice has been made, and\r\n  this surplus remains in the national bank without interest, while\r\n  our bonds, which, under the law, might be retired by the use of it,\r\n  continue to draw interest.\r\n\r\n  You have a great agricultural State. Its prairies offer the most\r\n  tempting invitation to the settler. I have heard it suggested that one\r\n  reason why you have outstripped Indiana in population was because the\r\n  men who were afraid of the \"deadening\" passed over us to seek your\r\n  treeless plains. [Applause.] But you have not been contented to be\r\n  only an agricultural community. You have developed your manufactures\r\n  and mechanical industries until now, if my recollection is not at\r\n  fault, for every two persons engaged in agricultural labor you have\r\n  one engaged in manufacturing, in the mechanical arts and mining. It is\r\n  this subdivision of labor, these diversified industries, that make\r\n  Illinois take rank so near the head among the States. By this home\r\n  interchange of the products of the farm and shop, made possible by our\r\n  protective system, Illinois has been able to attain her proud position\r\n  in the union of the States. Shall we continue a policy that has\r\n  wrought so marvellously since the war in the development of all those\r\n  States that have given hospitable access to manufacturing capital and\r\n  to the brawn and skill of the workingman? [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\nFrom Louisville, Ky., came 1,000 enthusiastic visitors, led by the Hon.\r\nWm. E. Riley, Hon. R. R. Glover, Hon. Albert Scott, W. W. Huffman, W. M.\r\nCollins, M. E. Malone, and J. J. Jonson. A. E. Willson, of Louisville,\r\ndelivered a stirring address on behalf of the Republicans of Kentucky,\r\nto which General Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Kentucky Friends_--There have been larger delegations assembled\r\n  about this platform, but there has been none that has in a higher\r\n  degree attracted my interest or touched my heart. [Applause.] It\r\n  has been quite one thing to be a Republican in Illinois and quite\r\n  another to be a Republican in Kentucky. [Applause.] Not the victors\r\n  only in a good fight deserve a crown; those who fight well and are\r\n  beaten and fight again, as you have done, deserve a crown, though\r\n  victory never yet has perched on your banner. [A voice, \"It will perch\r\n  there, though, don't you forget it!\"] Yes, it will come, for the\r\n  bud of victory is always in the truth. I will not treat you to-day\r\n  to any statistics from the census reports [laughter], nor enter the\r\n  attractive field of the history of your great State. I have believed\r\n  that these visiting delegations were always well advised as to the\r\n  history and statistics of their respective States. [Laughter.] If\r\n  this trust has been misplaced in other cases, certainly Kentuckians\r\n  can be trusted to remember and perhaps to tell all that is noble in\r\n  the thrilling history of their great State. [Great applause.] Your\r\n  history is very full of romantic and thrilling adventure and of\r\n  instances of individual heroism. Your people have always been proud,\r\n  chivalric, and brave. In the late war for the Union, spite of all\r\n  distraction and defection, Kentucky stood by the old flag. [Applause.]\r\n  And now that the war is over and its bitter memory is forgotten,\r\n  there is not one, I hope, in all your borders, who does not bless the\r\n  outcome of that great struggle. [Applause.] Surely there are none in\r\n  Kentucky who do not rejoice that the beautiful river is not a river\r\n  of division. [Great applause.] And now what hinders that Kentucky\r\n  shall step forward in the great industrial rivalry between the\r\n  States? Is there not, as your spokesman has suggested, in the early\r\n  and thorough instruction which the people of Kentucky received from\r\n  the mouth of your matchless orator, Henry Clay [applause], a power\r\n  that shall yet and speedily bring back Kentucky to the support of our\r\n  protective system? [Applause.] Can the old Whigs, who so reverently\r\n  received from the lips of Clay the gospel of protection, much longer\r\n  support a revenue policy that they know to be inimical to our national\r\n  interests? If when Kentucky was a slave State she found a protective\r\n  tariff promoted the prosperity of her people, what greater things will\r\n  the same policy not do for her as a free State? She has now opened\r\n  her hospitable doors to skilled labor; her coal and metals and hemp\r\n  invite its transforming touch. Why should she not speedily find great\r\n  manufacturing cities spring up in her beautiful valleys? Shall any old\r\n  prejudice spoil this hopeful vision? [Great applause.] I remember that\r\n  Kentucky agitated for seven years and held nine conventions before\r\n  she secured a separate statehood. May I not appeal to the children of\r\n  those brave settlers who, when but few in number, composed of distant\r\n  and feeble settlements, were received into the Union of States, to\r\n  show their chivalry and love of justice by uniting with us in the\r\n  demand that Dakota and Washington shall be admitted? [Applause.] Does\r\n  not your own story shame those who represent you in the halls of\r\n  Congress and who bar the door against communities whose numbers and\r\n  resources so vastly outreach what you possessed when you were admitted\r\n  to statehood? We look hopefully to Kentucky. The State of Henry Clay\r\n  and Abraham Lincoln [enthusiastic cheering] cannot be much longer\r\n  forgetful [cries of \"No! no!\"] of the teachings of those great leaders\r\n  of thought.\r\n\r\n  I believe that Kentucky will place herself soon upon the side of the\r\n  truth upon these great questions. [A voice, \"We believe it!\" Another\r\n  voice, \"We will keep them out of Indiana, anyhow!\" Great cheering.]\r\n  Thank you. There is no better way that I know of to keep one\r\n  detachment of an army from re-enforcing another than by giving that\r\n  detachment all it can do in its own field. [Applause and laughter.]\r\n\r\nThe last visitors of the day were 200 delegates, in attendance upon\r\nthe sessions of the National Association of Union Ex-Prisoners of War.\r\nThey were led by Gen. W. H. Powell, of Belleville, Iowa, President of\r\nthe Association; E. H. Williams, of Indianapolis, Vice-President;\r\nChaplain C. C. McCabe, New York City; Historian Frank E. Moran,\r\nPhiladelphia; President-elect Thomas H. McKee and Secretary L. P.\r\nWilliams, Washington, D. C.; S. N. Long, of New Jersey, and J. W. Green,\r\nof Ohio. Every one of the visiting veterans had undergone imprisonment\r\nat Andersonville, Libby, or some less noted Southern prison. Conspicuous\r\namong them was Gen. B. F. Kelly, of Virginia, the first Union officer\r\nwounded in the rebellion, and J. A. January, of Illinois, who amputated\r\nboth his own feet while in Libby Prison, to prevent gangrene spreading.\r\nGeneral Powell, in a brief address, touchingly referred to the perils\r\nand hardships they had survived. General Harrison was greatly affected\r\nby the scene--the veterans grouped closely about him in his own house.\r\nHe paused a moment in silence, then in a low, sympathetic voice, said:\r\n\r\n  _General Powell and Comrades_--I am always touched when I meet\r\n  either with those who stood near about me in the service, or those who\r\n  shared the general comradeship of the war. It seems to me that the\r\n  wild exhilaration which in the earlier reunions we often saw is very\r\n  much sobered as we come together now. I have realized in meeting with\r\n  my own regiment this fall that it was a time when one felt the touches\r\n  of the pathetic. And yet there was a glow of satisfaction in being\r\n  together again and in thinking of what was and what is. The annals of\r\n  the war fail to furnish a sadder story than that of the host of Union\r\n  veterans who suffered war's greatest hardship--captivity. The story of\r\n  the rebel prison pens was one of grim horror. In the field our armies,\r\n  always brave, were generally always chivalric and humane. But the\r\n  treatment of the captured Union soldiers surpassed in fiendish cruelty\r\n  the best achievements of the savage. It is the black spot without any\r\n  lining of silver or any touch of human nature. But you have cause for\r\n  congratulation that you have been spared to the glory and prosperity\r\n  that your services and sufferings have brought to the Nation. The\r\n  most vivid imagination has drawn no picture of the full meaning to\r\n  our people and to the world of these simple words--we saved the\r\n  Union, perpetuated free government, and abolished slavery. [Prolonged\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 19.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive delegations paid their respects to the Republican nominee this day.\r\nThe first was sixty veterans of the Seventh Indiana Cavalry--General\r\nJ. P. Shanks' old regiment. Colonel Lewis Reeves, of Mentone, Ind.,\r\nmade the address on behalf of the veterans, to which General Harrison\r\nresponded:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades_--I recall the services of your gallant regiment.\r\n  I welcome you as men who had as honorable a part in the great\r\n  achievements of the Union army as any in the Civil War. I congratulate\r\n  you that you have been spared to see the fruits of your labors and\r\n  sacrifices. In these meetings the thought of those who did not live to\r\n  see the end of the bloody struggle is always present. Their honor also\r\n  is in our keeping. I am glad to know that at last in our State a shaft\r\n  is being lifted to the honor of the Indiana soldier. It will not only\r\n  keep alive a worthy memory, but it will instil patriotism into our\r\n  children. I thank you for this friendly visit. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nFrom Illinois came two large delegations--that from Iroquois County\r\nnumbering 1,000, commanded by Chief Marshal Slattery, of Onargo. A\r\nTippecanoe club of veterans headed their column, led by Chairman Owen,\r\nfollowed by the John A. Logan Club, commanded by Capt. A. L. Whitehall.\r\nProminent in the delegation were State Senator Secrist, Judge S. G.\r\nBovie, B. F. Price, J. F. Ireland, A. Powell, James Woodworth, G.\r\nB. Joiner, W. M. Coney, Dr. J. H. Gillam, Dr. Scull, editors E. A.\r\nNye and M. S. Taliaferro, of Watseka; also W. H. Howe, of Braidwood,\r\nfather of the \"Drummer Boy of Vicksburg.\" Robert Meredith, of Onargo,\r\nspoke on behalf of the colored members of the delegation, and Capt.\r\nR. W. Hilscher, of Watseka, for the veterans. La Porte County, Ind.,\r\nwas represented by a large delegation, the Michigan City detachment\r\ncommanded by Major Biddle, Uriah Culbert, and Major Wood. The Laporte\r\nCity clubs were led by Wm. C. Weir, Marshal of the delegation. Other\r\nprominent members were S. M. Closser, W. C. Miller, Frank E. Osborn,\r\nJ. N. Whitehead, M. L. Bramhall, Nelson Larzen, Samuel Bagley, Brook\r\nTravis, Wm. Hastings, S. A. Rose, Swan Peterson, and editor Sonneborn.\r\nThe presentation address was made by Col. J. W. Crumpacker, of Laporte.\r\n\r\nTo these several addresses General Harrison responded:\r\n\r\n  _My Illinois and my Indiana Friends_--If I needed any stimulus to\r\n  duty, or to have my impression of the dignity and responsibility of\r\n  representative office increased, I should find it in such assemblies\r\n  as these and in the kind and thoughtful words which have been\r\n  addressed to me in your behalf. The American people under our system\r\n  of government have their public interests in their own keeping. All\r\n  laws and proclamations may be revoked or repealed by them. They will\r\n  be called on in November to mark out the revenue policy for our\r\n  Government by choosing public officers pledged to the principles\r\n  which a majority of our people approve. Fortunately you have now an\r\n  issue very clearly drawn and very easy to be understood. In previous\r\n  campaigns we have not quite known where our adversaries stood. Now we\r\n  do know. Our Democratic friends say a protective tariff is robbery.\r\n  You see this written at the head of campaign tracts circulated\r\n  by their committees. You hear it said in the public speeches of\r\n  their leaders. You have not once, I think, in the campaign heard\r\n  any Democratic speaker admit that even a low protective tariff was\r\n  desirable. Those who, like Mr. Randall, have in former campaigns\r\n  been used to allay the apprehension of our working people by talking\r\n  protection have been silenced. On the other hand, the Republican party\r\n  declares by its platform and by its speakers that a protective tariff\r\n  is wise and necessary. There is the issue. Make your own choice. If\r\n  you approve by your votes the doctrine that a protective tariff is\r\n  public robbery, you will expect your representatives to stop this\r\n  public robbery, and if they are faithful they will do it; not seven\r\n  per cent. of it, but all of it. [Applause and cries of \"That's it!\"]\r\n  So that I beg you all to recollect that you will vote this fall for\r\n  or against the principle of protection. You are invited to a feast of\r\n  cheapness. You are promised foreign-made goods at very low prices,\r\n  and domestic competing goods, if any are made, at the same low rates.\r\n  But do not forget that the spectre of low wages will also attend the\r\n  feast. [Applause and cries of \"That's so!\"] Inevitably, as certain as\r\n  the night follows the day, the adoption of this policy means lower\r\n  wages. Choose, then, and do not forget that this cheapening process\r\n  may be pushed so far as to involve the cheapening of human life and\r\n  the loss of human happiness. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  And now a word about the surplus in the Treasury. Our Democratic\r\n  friends did not know what else to do with it, and so they have\r\n  deposited it in certain national banks. The Government gets no\r\n  interest upon it, but it is loaned out by the banks to our citizens at\r\n  interest. Our income is more than our current expenses. There is no\r\n  authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to lend the money, and so\r\n  only three methods of dealing with it presented themselves, under the\r\n  law--first, to lock it up in the Treasury vaults; second, to deposit\r\n  it in the banks without interest; or, third, to use it in the purchase\r\n  of bonds not yet due. The objection to the first method was that the\r\n  withdrawal of so large a sum might result in a monetary stringency;\r\n  the second obviated this objection by allowing the banks to put the\r\n  money in circulation; but neither method resulted in any advantage to\r\n  the Government.\r\n\r\n  As to it the money was dead; only the banks received interest for\r\n  its use. By the third method the money would be returned to the\r\n  channels of trade and the Government would make the difference between\r\n  the premium paid for the bond and the interest that the bonds would\r\n  draw if left outstanding until they matured. If a Government bond\r\n  at the market premium is a good investment for a capitalist who is\r\n  free to use his money as he pleases, can it be bad finance for the\r\n  Government, having money that it cannot use in any other way, to use\r\n  it in buying up its bonds? [Great applause.] It is not whether we will\r\n  purposely raise money to buy our bonds at a premium--no one would\r\n  advise that--but will we so use a surplus that we have on hand and\r\n  cannot lawfully pay out in any other way? Do our Democratic friends\r\n  propose to give the banks the free use of it until our bonds mature,\r\n  or do they propose to reduce our annual income below our expenditure\r\n  by a revision of the tariff until this surplus is used, and then\r\n  revise the tariff again to restore the equilibriums? [Great applause.]\r\n  I welcome the presence to-day of these ladies of your households. We\r\n  should not forget that we have working-women in America. [Applause and\r\n  cries of \"Good! good!\"] None more than they are interested in this\r\n  policy of protection which we advocate. If want and hard conditions\r\n  come into the home, the women bear a full share. [Applause.] And now\r\n  I have been tempted to speak more at length than I had intended.\r\n  I thank you for this cordial manifestation of your confidence and\r\n  respect. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth delegation of the day came from Grundy County, Illinois,\r\nheaded by the Logan Club of Morris. An enthusiastic member of this\r\ndelegation was the venerable Geo. P. Augustine, of Braceville,\r\nIll., aged 77, who in the summer of 1840 employed the boy \"Jimmie\"\r\nGarfield--afterward President of the United States--to ride his horses\r\non the tow-path of the Ohio canal between Portsmouth and Cleveland.\r\nHon. P. C. Hayes, of Morris, was spokesman for the delegation. General\r\nHarrison said:\r\n\r\n  _General Hayes and my Illinois Friends_--I regret that your arrival\r\n  was postponed so long as to make it impossible for you to meet with\r\n  the other friends from your State who, a little while ago, assembled\r\n  about the platform. I thank you for the kind feelings that prompted\r\n  you to come, and for the generous things General Hayes has said in\r\n  your behalf. There is little that I can say and little that I can\r\n  appropriately do to promote the success of the Republican principles.\r\n  A campaign that enlists the earnest and active co-operation of the\r\n  individual voters will have a safe issue. I am glad to see in your\r\n  presence an evidence that in your locality this individual interest\r\n  is felt. [Applause.] But popular assemblies, public debate, and\r\n  conventions are all an empty mockery unless, when the debate is\r\n  closed, the election is so conducted that every elector shall have\r\n  an equal and full influence in determining the result. That is our\r\n  compact of government. [Cheers.] I thank you again for your great\r\n  kindness, and it will now give me pleasure to accede to the suggestion\r\n  of General Hayes and take each of you by the hand.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last delegation of the day reached the Harrison residence\r\nin the evening, and comprised 200 survivors of the Second and Ninth\r\nIndiana Cavalry and the Twenty-sixth Indiana Infantry. Col. John A.\r\nBridgland, the old commander of the Second Cavalry, spoke on behalf of\r\nthe veterans. General Harrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Bridgland and Comrades_--I am fast losing my faith in men.\r\n  [Laughter.] This morning a representative or two of this regiment\r\n  called upon me and made an arrangement that I should receive you at\r\n  this hour. It was expressly stipulated--though I took no security\r\n  [laughter]--that there should be no speech-making at all. Now I find\r\n  myself formally introduced to you and under the necessity of talking\r\n  to you. [Laughter.] I am under so much stress in this way, from day\r\n  to day, that I am really getting to be a little timid when I see a\r\n  corporal's guard together anywhere, for fear they will want a speech.\r\n  [Laughter.] And even at home, when I sit down at the table with my\r\n  family, I have some apprehensions lest some one may propose a toast\r\n  and insist that I shall respond. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  I remember that the Second Indiana Cavalry was the first full\r\n  cavalry regiment I ever saw. I saw it marching through Washington\r\n  Street from the windows of my law office; and as I watched the long\r\n  line drawing itself through the street, it seemed to me the call\r\n  for troops might stop; that there were certainly enough men and\r\n  horses there to put down the rebellion. [Laughter.] It is clear I\r\n  did not rightly measure the capacities of a cavalry regiment, or the\r\n  dimensions of the rebellion. [Laughter.] I am glad to see you here\r\n  to-day. You come as soldiers, and I greet you as comrades. I will not\r\n  allude to political topics, on which any of us might differ. [A voice,\r\n  \"There ain't any differences!\"] Of course, the members of the Ninth\r\n  Cavalry and the Twenty-sixth Infantry must understand I am speaking\r\n  to all my comrades. [A voice, \"The Twenty-sixth were waiting for the\r\n  cavalry to get out of the way!\" Laughter.] Well, during the war you\r\n  were willing to wait, weren't you? [Hearty laughter.] I was going to\r\n  say that I had an express promise from Mr. Adams, of the Twenty-sixth\r\n  Indiana, there should be no speaking on the occasion of your visit.\r\n  [Laughter.] Perhaps his comrades of the Twenty-sixth will say I had\r\n  not sufficient reason for so thinking, as we all know that he is given\r\n  to joking. [Laughter.] I will be pleased now to meet each of you\r\n  personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 20 a distinguished delegation arrived from Cincinnati,\r\nfor the purpose of inviting General and Mrs. Harrison to attend the\r\nCincinnati Exposition. The committee, representing the Board of\r\nCommissioners of the Exposition, was headed by Chairman Goodale and\r\nPresident Allison and wife, accompanied by Mayor Amor Smith and wife,\r\nComptroller E. P. Eshelby and wife, Hon. John B. Peaslee, Mrs. and Miss\r\nDevereaux, C. H. Rockwell and wife, and others.\r\n\r\nIn the evening 300 gentlemen, exhibiting implements and agricultural\r\nmachinery at the State Fair--then in progress--called on General\r\nHarrison. John C. Wingate, of Montgomery County, was their spokesman.\r\n\r\nResponding to their greeting the General said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--When I was asked yesterday whether it would be\r\n  agreeable to me to see about one hundred gentlemen who were here in\r\n  attendance upon the Indiana State Fair and connected with the exhibit\r\n  of machinery, I was assured their call would be of the most informal\r\n  character--that they would simply visit me at my home and spend a few\r\n  moments socially. [Laughter.] Until I heard the music of your band and\r\n  saw the torchlights, that was my understanding of what was in store\r\n  for me this evening. I am again the victim of a misunderstanding.\r\n  [Laughter and applause.] Still, though my one hundred guests have been\r\n  multiplied several times, and though I find myself compelled to speak\r\n  to you en masse rather than individually, I am glad to see you. I\r\n  thank you for your visit, and for the cordial terms in which you have\r\n  addressed me. What your speaker has said as to the favorable condition\r\n  of our working people is true; and we are fortunate in the fact that\r\n  we do not need to depend for our evidence on statistics or the reports\r\n  of those who casually visit the countries of the Old World. There is\r\n  probably not a shop represented here that has not among its workingmen\r\n  those who have tried the conditions of life in the old country, and\r\n  are able to speak from personal experience. It cannot be doubted that\r\n  our American system of levying discriminating duties upon competing\r\n  foreign products has much to do with the better condition of our\r\n  working people. I welcome you as representatives of one of the great\r\n  industries of our country. The demands of the farm have been met by\r\n  the ingenuity of your shops. The improvement in farm machinery within\r\n  my own recollection has been marvellous. The scythe and the cradle\r\n  still held control in the harvest field when I first went out to\r\n  carry the noon meal to the workmen. Afterward it sometimes fell to my\r\n  lot in the hay-field to drive one of the old-fashioned combination\r\n  reapers and mowers. It was a great advance over the scythe and cradle,\r\n  and yet it was heavy and clumsy--a very horse-killer. [Laughter and\r\n  applause.] When the drivers struck a stump the horse had no power\r\n  over the machine in either direction. Now these machines have been so\r\n  lightened and improved that they are the perfection of mechanism. Your\r\n  inventive genius has responded to the necessities of the farm until\r\n  that which was drudgery has become light and easy. I thank you again\r\n  for your call, and will be glad to meet personally those strangers who\r\n  are here. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandolph and Jay counties, Indiana, contributed 3,000 visitors on\r\nSeptember 21. At the head of the Randolph column marched 200 members\r\nof the \"Old Men's Tippecanoe Club,\" of Winchester, led by Marshals J.\r\nB. Ross, A. J. Stakebake, and Auditor Cranor. Other leaders in the\r\ndelegation were Mayor F. H. Bowen, Hon. Theo. Shockley, Geo. Patchell,\r\nW. S. Ensign, Frank Parker, Samuel Bell, Dr. G. Rynard, and Washington\r\nSmith, of Union City; J. W. Macy, J. S. Engle, Reverdy Puckett, A. C.\r\nBeeson, and John E. Markle, of Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe Jay County contingent was led by James A. Russell, B. D. Halfhill,\r\nIsaac McKinney, J. W. Williams, Eli Clark, J. C. Andrews, T. J.\r\nCartwright, and Albert Martin. L. C. Hauseman was spokesman for the\r\nHoosiers. Gen. Stone, of Randolph, spoke on behalf of the veterans.\r\n\r\nFrom Dayton, Ohio, came 500 visitors, including 60 veterans of the\r\ncampaign of '40, led by Secretary Edgar. Marshal James Applegate, Mr.\r\nEckley, Dr. J. A. Ronspert, and W. R. Knaub were other leaders of the\r\nOhio contingent. Col. John G. Lowe was their speaker, and referred to\r\nthe fact that Gen. Harrison \"had won his education and Miss Caroline M.\r\nScott, now his estimable wife, when a resident of Ohio.\"\r\n\r\nTo these addresses the General, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Ohio and Indiana Friends_--The magnitude and the cordiality of\r\n  this demonstration are very gratifying. That these representatives of\r\n  the State of my nativity, and these, my neighbors in this State of my\r\n  early adoption, should unite this morning in giving this evidence of\r\n  their respect and confidence is especially pleasing. I do remember\r\n  Ohio, the State of my birth and of my boyhood, with affection and\r\n  veneration. I take pride in her great history, the illustrious men she\r\n  furnished to lead our armies, and the army of her brave boys who bore\r\n  the knapsack and the gun for the Union. I take pride in her pure and\r\n  illustrious statesmen. Ohio was the first of the Northwestern States\r\n  to receive the western emigration after the Revolutionary War. When\r\n  that tide of patriotism which had borne our country to freedom and had\r\n  established our Constitution threw upon the West many of the patriots\r\n  whose fortunes had been maimed or broken by their sacrifices in the\r\n  Revolutionary War, this pure stream, pouring over the Alleghanies,\r\n  found its first basin in the State of Ohio. [Cries of \"Good! Good!\"]\r\n\r\n  The waters of patriotism that had been distilled in the fires of the\r\n  Revolution fertilized her virgin fields. [Applause.] I do not forget,\r\n  however, that my manhood has all been spent in Indiana--that all the\r\n  struggle which is behind me in life has this for its field. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I brought to this hospitable State only that to which Col. Lowe has\r\n  alluded--an education and a good wife. [Great cheering.] Whatever\r\n  else I have, whatever else I have accomplished, for myself and for\r\n  my family or the public, has been under the favoring and friendly\r\n  auspices of these, my fellow-citizens of Indiana. [Applause.] To\r\n  them I owe more than I can repay. My Indiana friends, you come from\r\n  a county largely devoted to agriculture. The invitation of Nature\r\n  was so generous that your people have generally accepted it. Guarded\r\n  as your early settlers were, and as those of Ohio were, by that\r\n  sword of liberty which was placed at your gates by the ordinance of\r\n  1787, stimulated, as you have been, by the suggestions of that great\r\n  ordinance in favor of morality and education, you have, in your rural\r\n  homes, one of the best communities in the world. [Applause.] You do\r\n  not forget, farmers though you are, that 95 per cent. of the product\r\n  of your farms is consumed at home, and you are too wise to put that\r\n  in peril in a greedy search after foreign trade. [Great applause.] You\r\n  will not sacrifice these great industries that have created in our\r\n  country a consuming class for your products. [Cheers.] I do not think\r\n  that there is any doubt what tariff policy England would wish us to\r\n  adopt, and yet some say that England is trembling lest we should adopt\r\n  free trade here [laughter], and so rob her of other markets that she\r\n  now enjoys. [Laughter.] The story of our colonial days, when England,\r\n  with selfish and insatiate avarice, laid her repressive hand upon our\r\n  infant manufactories and attempted to suppress them all, furnishes\r\n  the first object-lesson she gave us. Another was given when the life\r\n  of this Nation--the child of England, as she has been wont to call\r\n  us, speaking the mother tongue, having many institutions inherited\r\n  from her--was imperilled. The offer of free trade by the Confederacy\r\n  so touched the commercial greed of England that she forgot the ties\r\n  of blood and went to the verge of war with us to advance the cause of\r\n  the rebel Government. [Cheers.] But what England wants, or what any\r\n  other country wants, is not very important--certainly not conclusive.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  What is best for us and our people should be the decisive question.\r\n  [Cheers.] My Randolph County friends, there are State questions that\r\n  must take a strong hold upon the minds of people like yours. The\r\n  proposition to lift entirely out of the range and control of partisan\r\n  politics the great benevolent institutions of the State is one that\r\n  must commend itself to all your people. [Cheers.] If all those friends\r\n  who sympathize with us upon this question had acted with us in 1886 we\r\n  should then have accomplished this great reform. [Applause.] And now,\r\n  to these old gentlemen whose judgment and large experience in life\r\n  gives added value to their kind words; to these young friends who,\r\n  for the first time, take a freeman's place in the line of battle to\r\n  do duty for the right, I give my kindly greetings and best wishes in\r\n  return for theirs. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of September 22 General Harrison was visited by 600\r\nChicago \"drummers,\" organized as the Republican Commercial Travellers'\r\nAssociation of Chicago and accompanied by the celebrated Second Regiment\r\nBand. They were escorted to the Harrison residence by the Columbia Club\r\nand 200 members of the Republican Commercial Travellers' Escort Club of\r\nIndianapolis, George C. Webster, President; Ernest Morris, Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe entire business community turned out to greet the visitors as they\r\nmarched through the city, performing difficult evolutions, under the\r\ncommand of Chief Marshal Vandever and his aids--C. S. Felton, P. H.\r\nBrockway, B. F. Horton, Joseph Pomroy, W. H. Haskell, Geo. W. Bristol,\r\nA. C. Boyd, Geo. H. Green, and Secretary H. A. Morgan.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's appearance was signalized by a remarkable\r\ndemonstration. Col. H. H. Rude delivered the address on behalf of his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nIn response General Harrison made one of his best speeches. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Sir, and Gentlemen of the Republican Commercial Travellers'\r\n  Association of Chicago_--I bid you welcome to my home. I give you\r\n  my most ardent thanks for this cordial evidence of your interest\r\n  in those great principles of government which are advocated by the\r\n  Republican party, whose candidate I am. I am not unfamiliar with the\r\n  value, efficiency, and intelligence of the commercial travellers\r\n  of our country. [Cheers.] The contribution you make to the success\r\n  of the business communities with which you are identified is large\r\n  and indispensable. I do not doubt that one of the strongest props\r\n  of Chicago's commercial greatness would be destroyed if you were\r\n  withdrawn from the commercial forces of that great city. [Cheers.] The\r\n  growth and development of Chicago has been one of the most marvellous\r\n  incidents in the story of American progress. It is gratifying to know\r\n  that your interest is enlisted in this political campaign. It is very\r\n  creditable to you that in the rush of the busy industries and pushing\r\n  trade of your city you have not forgotten that you are American\r\n  citizens and that you owe service, not to commerce only, but to your\r\n  country. [Great cheering.] It is gratifying to be assured that you\r\n  propose to bring your influence into the great civil contest which is\r\n  now engaging the interest of our people. The intelligence and energy\r\n  which you give to your commercial pursuits will be a most valuable\r\n  contribution to our cause. [Cheers.] The power of such a body of men\r\n  is very great.\r\n\r\n  I want now to introduce to you for a moment another speaker--an\r\n  Englishman. Within the last year I have been reading, wholly without\r\n  any view to politics, the story of our diplomatic relations with\r\n  England during the Civil War. The motive that most strongly influenced\r\n  the English mind in its sympathy with the South was the expectancy of\r\n  free trade with the Confederacy [cries of \"That's right!\"], and among\r\n  the most influential publications intended to urge English recognition\r\n  and aid to the Confederates was a book entitled \"The American Union,\"\r\n  by James Spence. It was published in 1862, and ran through several\r\n  editions. Speaking of the South he said:\r\n\r\n    \"No part of the world can be found more admirably placed for\r\n    exchanging with this country the products of industry to mutual\r\n    advantage than the Southern States of the Union. Producing in\r\n    abundance the material we chiefly require, their climate and the\r\n    habits of the people indispose them to manufactures, and leave to\r\n    be purchased precisely the commodities we have to sell. They have\r\n    neither the means nor the desire to enter into rivalry with us.\r\n    Commercially they offer more than the capabilities of another India\r\n    within a fortnight's distance from our shores. The capacity of a\r\n    Southern trade when free from restrictions may be estimated most\r\n    correctly by comparison. The condition of those States resembles\r\n    that of Australia, both non-manufacturing countries, with the\r\n    command of ample productions to offer in exchange for the imports\r\n    they require.\"\r\n\r\n  The author proceeds to show that at the time England's exports to\r\n  our country were only thirteen shillings per capita of our population,\r\n  while the exports to Australia were ten pounds sterling per capita.\r\n  Let me now read you what is said of the Northern States:\r\n\r\n    \"The people of the North, whether manufacturers or ship-owners,\r\n    regard us as rivals and competitors, to be held back and cramped\r\n    by all possible means. [Applause and cries of \"That's it!\"] They\r\n    possess the same elements as ourselves--coal, metals, ships, an\r\n    aptitude for machinery, energy and industry--while the early\r\n    obstacles of deficient capital and scanty labor are rapidly\r\n    disappearing. [Applause and a voice, \"Exactly!\"]\r\n\r\n    \"For many years they have competed with us in some manufactures\r\n    in foreign markets, and their peculiar skill in the contrivance of\r\n    labor-saving machinery daily increases the number of articles they\r\n    produce cheaper than ourselves. [Loud cheering and a voice, \"We'll\r\n    knock them out again!\"]\r\n\r\n    \"Thus, to one part of the world our exports are at the rate of\r\n    ten pounds sterling per head, while those to the Union amount to but\r\n    thirteen shillings per head.\"\r\n\r\n  I have read these extracts because they seemed to me very suggestive\r\n  and very instructive. The South offered free trade to Europe in\r\n  exchange for an expected recognition of their independence by England\r\n  and France. [Cries of \"You are right!\"] The offer was very attractive\r\n  and persuasive to the ruling classes of England. They took Confederate\r\n  bonds and sent out armed cruisers to prey upon our commerce. They\r\n  dallied with Southern agents, fed them with delusive hopes, and thus\r\n  encouraged the South to protract a hopeless struggle. They walked to\r\n  the very edge of open war with the United States, forgetful of all the\r\n  friendly ties that had bound us as nations, and all this to satisfy\r\n  a commercial greed. We may learn from this how high a price England\r\n  then set upon free trade with a part only of the States. [A voice, \"We\r\n  remember it!\"]\r\n\r\n  But now the Union has been saved and restored. Men of both armies\r\n  and of all the States rejoice that England's hope of a commercial\r\n  dependency on our Southern coast was disappointed. The South is under\r\n  no stress to purchase foreign help by trade concessions. She will now\r\n  open her hospitable doors to manufacturing, capital, and skilled labor.\r\n\r\n  It is not now true that either climate or the habits of her people\r\n  indispose them to manufactures. Of the Virginias, North Carolina,\r\n  Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Missouri, it may be now said, as\r\n  Mr. Spence said of the more northern States, \"They possess the same\r\n  elements as ourselves [England]--coal, metals, ships, an aptitude\r\n  for machinery, energy, and industry--while the early obstacles of\r\n  deficient capital and scanty labor are rapidly disappearing.\" And I\r\n  am sure there is a \"New South\"--shackled as it is by traditions and\r\n  prejudices--that is girding itself to take part in great industrial\r\n  rivalry with England, which Mr. Spence so much deprecates. These great\r\n  States will no longer allow either Old England or New England to spin\r\n  and weave their cotton, but will build mills in the very fields where\r\n  the great staple is gathered. [Applause.] They will no longer leave\r\n  Pennsylvania without an active rival in the production of iron. They\r\n  surely will not, if they are at all mindful of their great need and\r\n  their great opportunity, unite in this crusade against our protected\r\n  industries.\r\n\r\n  Our interests no longer run upon sectional lines, and it cannot be\r\n  good for any part of our country that Mr. Spence's vision of English\r\n  trade with us should be realized. [Cries of \"Never! Never!\"] Commerce\r\n  between the States is working mightily, if silently, to efface all\r\n  lingering estrangements between our people, and the appeal for the\r\n  perpetuation of the American system of protection will, I am sure,\r\n  soon find an answering response among the people of all the States.\r\n  [Loud cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you again for this beautiful and cordial demonstration, and\r\n  will now be glad to meet you personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third delegation from Wabash County during the campaign arrived\r\non September 25, a thousand strong, headed by Hon. Jesse Arnold, Col.\r\nHoman Depew, Thomas Black, W. D. Caldwell, Obed Way, Thomas McNamee,\r\nRob't Thompson, Wm. Alexander, Robert Wilson, Andrew Egnew, C. S. Haas,\r\nW. W. Stewart, W. H. Bent, Robert Stewart, and W. D. Gachenour. Their\r\nspokesman was Capt. B. F. Williams. Parke County, Indiana, contributed a\r\nlarge delegation the same day, under the lead of John W. Stryker, Jacob\r\nChurch, John R. Johnson, A. O. Benson, W. W. McCune, Joseph H. Jordan,\r\nand A. A. Hargrave, of Rockville, and 300 school children, in charge of\r\nA. R. McMurty. Dr. T. F. Leech was orator for the Parke visitors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Wabash County Friends and my Little Friends from Parke_--I\r\n  am very glad to meet you here to-day. My friend who has spoken for\r\n  Wabash County has very truly said that the relations between me and\r\n  the Republicans of that county have always been exceedingly cordial.\r\n  I remember well when I first visited your county in 1860, almost a\r\n  boy in years, altogether a boy in political experience. I was then a\r\n  candidate for Reporter of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of this\r\n  State. You had in one of your own citizens, afterward a distinguished\r\n  soldier, a candidate for that office in the convention that nominated\r\n  me, but that did not interfere at all with the cordial welcome from\r\n  your people when, as the nominee of the party, I came into your\r\n  county. I think from that day to this my name has never been mentioned\r\n  in any convention for any office that I have not had almost the\r\n  unanimous support of the Republicans of Wabash County. [Applause.]\r\n  This is no new interest which you now manifest to-day. The expressions\r\n  of your confidence have been very numerous and have been continued\r\n  through nearly thirty years.\r\n\r\n  There is one word on one subject that I want to say. Our Democratic\r\n  friends tell us that there are about a hundred millions--their\r\n  arithmeticians do not agree on the exact figures--in the public\r\n  Treasury for which the Government has no need. They have found only\r\n  this method of using it, viz.: depositing it in the national banks of\r\n  the country, to be loaned out by them to our citizens at interest, the\r\n  Government getting no interest whatever from the banks. I suggested,\r\n  and it was not an original suggestion with me--Senator Sherman has\r\n  advocated the same policy with great ability in the Senate--that\r\n  this money had better be used in buying Government bonds, because\r\n  the Government would make some money in applying it that way, and\r\n  there was no other way in which they could get any interest on it\r\n  at all. But it is said if we use it in this manner we pay a premium\r\n  to the bondholders. But it is only the same premium that the bonds\r\n  are bringing in the market. In other words, as I said the other day,\r\n  capitalists who can use their money as they please--put it out on\r\n  mortgages, at interest, or in any other way--think the Government\r\n  bond at the current rate of premium is a good investment for them.\r\n  Now, the Government can buy those bonds at that premium and save a\r\n  great deal of interest. I will not undertake to give you figures. One\r\n  issue of these bonds matures in 1907, and bears four per cent. annual\r\n  interest. Now, suppose this surplus money were to remain all that\r\n  time in the banks without bringing any interest to the Government;\r\n  is there a man here so dull that he cannot see the great loss that\r\n  would result to the people? I have another objection to this policy:\r\n  the favoritism that is involved in it. We have heard--and from such\r\n  high authority that I think that we must accept it as true--that the\r\n  great patronage appertaining to the office of President of the United\r\n  States involves a public peril. Now, suppose we add to that danger a\r\n  hundred millions of dollars that the Secretary of the Treasury can put\r\n  in this community or that, in this bank or that, at his pleasure; is\r\n  not the power of the executive perilously increased? Is it right that\r\n  the use of this vast sum should be a matter of mere favoritism, that\r\n  the Secretary should be allowed to put $10,000,000 of this surplus\r\n  in Indianapolis and none of it in Kansas City, or $75,000,000 in New\r\n  York and none in Indianapolis? If the money is used in buying bonds it\r\n  finds its natural place--goes where it belongs. This is a most serious\r\n  objection to the present method of dealing with the surplus. But if\r\n  you still object to paying the market premium when we buy these bonds,\r\n  see how it works the other way. The banks deposit their bonds in the\r\n  Treasury to secure these deposits, get the Government money without\r\n  interest, and still draw interest on their bonds. If any of you had a\r\n  note for a thousand dollars due in five years, bearing interest, and\r\n  your credit was so good that the note was worth a premium, and you had\r\n  twelve hundred dollars that you could not put out at interest so as\r\n  to offset the interest on your note, would you not make money by using\r\n  this surplus to take up the note at a fair premium? Would you think\r\n  it wise finance to give the thousand dollars that you had on hand to\r\n  your creditor without interest and allow him to deposit your note with\r\n  you as security, you paying interest on the note until it was due and\r\n  getting no interest on your deposit? [Laughter and applause.].\r\n\r\n  I welcome my young friends from Parke County. There is nothing\r\n  fuller of interest than childhood. There is so much promise and\r\n  hope in it. Expectancy makes life very rosy to them and them very\r\n  interesting to us who have passed beyond the turn of life. [Applause.]\r\n  You are fortunate in these kind instructors, who from week to week\r\n  instil into your minds the principles of religion and of morality;\r\n  but do not forget that there is another vine of beauty that may be\r\n  appropriately twined with those--the love of your country and her\r\n  institutions. [Applause.] I thank you again for this cordial evidence\r\n  of your regard. The skies are threatening, and as there is danger that\r\n  our meeting may be interrupted by rain I will stop here in order that\r\n  I may meet each of you personally. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nOhio and Indiana united to-day again, through their delegations,\r\naggregating 4,000 citizens, in paying their respects to General\r\nHarrison. The Tippecanoe Veteran Association of Columbus, Ohio, J. E.\r\nSt. Clair, President, comprising 200 veterans, whose ages averaged 76\r\nyears, was escorted by the Foraker Club of Columbus, led by President\r\nReeves. The veterans were accompanied by the venerable Judge John\r\nA. Bingham, of Cadiz, and Gen. Geo. B. Wright, of Columbus, both of\r\nwhom made addresses. No other club or organization, during the entire\r\ncampaign, was the recipient of such marked attentions as the Ohio\r\nveterans; the youngest among them was 68 years of age. Among the oldest\r\nwere Wm. Armstrong, aged 91; Ansel Bristol, 80; H. H. Chariton, 84;\r\nFrancis A. Crum, 82; Joseph Davis, 84; Henry Edwards, 80; John Fields,\r\n82; John A. Gill, 82; J. L. Grover, 81; J. A. S. Harlow, 87; Harris\r\nLoomis, 84; Dan'l Melhousen, 80; Sam'l McCleland, 80; Judge John Otstot,\r\n86; James Park, 80; Daniel Short, 83; John Saul, 86; George Snoffer,\r\n85; David Taylor, 87; Jacob Taylor, 88; J. D. Fuller, 82, and Luther\r\nHillery, aged 90, who knew William Henry Harrison before his first\r\nnomination. Prominent in the Foraker Club were Dr. A. W. Harden and D.\r\nK. Reif.\r\n\r\nThe Tipton County, Indiana, visitation was under the auspices of the\r\nFirst Voters' Club of the town of Tipton. A large club of Tippecanoe\r\ncampaign veterans headed their column, led by Chief Marshal J. A.\r\nSwoveland, assisted by M. W. Pershing, James Johns, John F. Pyke, R. J.\r\nMcCalion, Isaac Booth, J. Q. Seright, and J. Wolverton. Judge Daniel\r\nWaugh, of Tipton, was the mouthpiece of the delegation.\r\n\r\nFrom Elkhart County, Indiana, came a notable delegation of a thousand\r\nbusiness men, prominent among whom were State Senator Davis, Hon. Geo.\r\nW. Burt, Daniel Zook, H. J. Beyerle, E. G. Herr, D. W. Neidig, T. H.\r\nDailey, D. W. Granger, and I. W. Nash, of Goshen; and James H. State, A.\r\nC. Manning, J. W. Fieldhouse, J. G. Schreiner, A. P. Kent, J. H. Cainon,\r\nFrank Baker, and Jacob Berkley, of Elkhart City. Hon. O. Z. Hubbell\r\nwas spokesman for the delegation. Judge Bingham's eloquent address was\r\nlistened to with marked attention.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen, my Ohio and Indiana Friends_--Again about this platform\r\n  there are gathered representatives from these two great States. Your\r\n  coming is an expression of a common interest, a recognition of the\r\n  fact that there is a citizenship that is wider than the lines of any\r\n  State. [Cheers.] That over and above that just pride in your own\r\n  communities, which you cherish so jealously, there is a fuller pride\r\n  in the one flag, to which we all give our allegiance, and in the\r\n  one Constitution, which binds the people of these States together\r\n  indissolubly in a Government strong enough to protect its humblest\r\n  citizen wherever he may sojourn. [Prolonged cheers.] Your State\r\n  institutions are based, like those of the Nation, upon the great\r\n  principles of human liberty and equality, and are consecrated to the\r\n  promotion of social order and popular education. But, above all this,\r\n  resting on like foundations, is the strong arch of the Union that\r\n  binds us together as a Nation. You are citizens of the United States,\r\n  and as such have common interests that suggest this meeting. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I cannot speak separately to the various organizations represented\r\n  here. There is a broad sense in which you are one. But I cannot omit\r\n  to pay a hearty tribute of thanks to these venerable men who are\r\n  gathered about me to-day. I value this tribute from them more than\r\n  words can tell. I cannot, without indelicacy, speak much of that\r\n  campaign to which they brought the enthusiasm of their earlier life\r\n  and to which their memories now turn with so much interest. If, out\r\n  of it, they have brought on with them in life to this moment and have\r\n  transferred to me some part of the respect which another won from\r\n  them, then I will find in their kindness a new stimulus to duty.\r\n  [Applause and cries, \"We have; we have!\"] In looking over, the other\r\n  day, a publication of the campaign of 1840, I fell upon a card signed\r\n  by fifteen Democrats of Orange, N. J., giving their reasons for\r\n  leaving the Democratic party. It has occurred to me that it might be\r\n  interesting to some of these old gentlemen. [Cries of \"We want to hear\r\n  it!\" and \"Read it!\"]\r\n\r\n  It was as follows: \"We might give many reasons for this change in\r\n  our political opinions. The following, however, we deem sufficient:\r\n  We do not believe the price of labor in this free country should be\r\n  reduced to the standard prescribed by despots in foreign countries.\r\n  [Applause.] We do not believe in fighting for the country and being\r\n  unrepresented in the councils of the country. We do not believe in an\r\n  exclusive, hard, metallic currency any more than we believe in hard\r\n  bread or no bread! We do not believe it was the design of the framers\r\n  of the Constitution that the President should occupy his time during\r\n  the first term in electioneering for his re-election to a second\r\n  term!\" [Loud laughter and applause.] I have read this simply as an\r\n  historical curiosity and to refresh your recollections as to some of\r\n  the issues of that campaign. If it has any application to our modern\r\n  politics I will leave you to make it. [Laughter and applause.] I have\r\n  recently been talking, and have one thing further to say, about the\r\n  surplus.\r\n\r\n  There is a very proper use I think that can be made of more than\r\n  twenty millions of it. During the Civil War our customs receipts and\r\n  our receipts from internal taxes, which last had brought under tribute\r\n  almost every pursuit in life, were inadequate to the great drain\r\n  upon our Treasury caused by the Civil War. Our Congress, exercising\r\n  one of the powers of the Constitution, levied a direct tax upon the\r\n  States. Ohio paid her part of it, Indiana paid hers, and so did the\r\n  other loyal States. The Southern States were in rebellion and did\r\n  not pay theirs. Now we have come to a time when the Government has\r\n  surplus money, and the proposition was made in Congress to return this\r\n  tax to the States that had paid it. [Applause.] The State of Indiana\r\n  would have received one million dollars, which my fellow-citizens of\r\n  this State know would have been a great relief to our taxpayers in\r\n  the present depleted condition of our treasury. [Cheers.] I do not\r\n  recall the exact amount Ohio would have received, but it was much\r\n  larger. If any one asks, Why repay this tax? this illustration will\r\n  be a sufficient answer: Suppose five men are associated in a business\r\n  corporation. The corporation suffers losses and its capital is\r\n  impaired. An assessment becomes necessary, and three members pay their\r\n  assessments while two do not. The corporation is again prosperous and\r\n  there is a surplus of money in the treasury. What shall be done with\r\n  it? Manifestly, justice requires that the two delinquents should pay\r\n  up or that there should be returned to the other three the assessment\r\n  levied upon them. [Great cheering.] A bill providing for the repayment\r\n  of the tax was killed in the House of Representatives, not by voting\r\n  it down, but by filibustering, a majority of the House being in favor\r\n  of its passage. And those who defeated the bill by those revolutionary\r\n  tactics were largely from the States that had not paid the tax.\r\n  [Cheers.] I mention these facts to show that twenty millions of the\r\n  surplus now lying in the banks, where it draws no interest, might\r\n  very righteously be used so as to greatly lighten the real burdens\r\n  of taxation now resting on the people--burdens that the people know\r\n  to be taxes without any argument from our statesmen. [Applause and\r\n  laughter.] I am a lover of silence [laughter], and yet when such\r\n  assemblies as these greet me with their kind, earnest faces and their\r\n  kinder words, I do not know how I can do less than to say a few words\r\n  upon some of these great public questions. I have spoken frankly and\r\n  fearlessly my convictions upon these questions. [Cheers and cries of\r\n  \"Good! Good!\"] And now, unappalled by the immensity of this audience,\r\n  I will complete the accustomed programme and take by the hand such of\r\n  you as desire to meet me personally. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's visitors this day came from Ohio and Pennsylvania.\r\nHancock and Allen counties, Ohio, sent over a thousand, including\r\nthe Harrison and Morton Battalion of Lima, commanded by Capt. Martin\r\nAtmer, and the Republican Veteran Club of Findlay, Rev. R. H. Holliday,\r\nPresident. The Chief Marshal of the combined delegations was Major S. F.\r\nEllis, of Lima, hero of the forlorn hope storming column which carried\r\nthe intrenchments at Port Hudson, La., June 15, 1863. Prominent members\r\nof the Allen County delegation were Hon. Geo. Hall, Geo. P. Waldorf, S.\r\nS. Wheeler, J. F. Price, W. A. Campbell, J. J. Marks, and Burt Hagedorn.\r\nMajor S. M. Jones was spokesman for the visitors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, with his usual vigor, replied:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen and my Ohio Friends_--The State of my nativity has again\r\n  placed me under obligations by this new evidence of the respect of her\r\n  people. I am glad to meet you and to notice in the kind and interested\r\n  faces into which I look a confirmation of the cordial remarks which\r\n  have been addressed to me on your behalf. You each feel a personal\r\n  interest and, I trust, a personal responsibility in this campaign.\r\n  The interest which expresses itself only in public demonstrations is\r\n  not of the highest value. The citizen who really believes that this\r\n  election will either give a fresh impulse to the career of prosperity\r\n  and honor in which our Nation has walked since the war, or will clog\r\n  and retard that progress, comes far short of his duty if he does not\r\n  in his own place as a citizen make his influence felt for the truth\r\n  upon those who are near him. [Applause.] You come from a community\r\n  that has recently awakened to the fact that beneath the soil which\r\n  has long yielded bounteous harvests to your farmers there was stored\r\n  by nature a great and new source of wealth. You, in common with\r\n  neighboring communities in Ohio and with other communities in our\r\n  State, have only partially realized as yet the increase in wealth\r\n  that oil and natural gas will bring to them, if it is not checked by\r\n  destructive changes in our tariff policy. This fact should quicken and\r\n  intensify the interest of these communities in this contest for the\r\n  preservation of the American system of protection. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is said by some of our opponents that a protective tariff has\r\n  no influence upon wages; that labor in the United States has nothing\r\n  to fear from the competition from pauper labor; that in the contest\r\n  between pauper labor and high priced labor pauper labor was always\r\n  driven out. Do such statements as these fall in line with experiences\r\n  of these workingmen who are before me? [Cries of \"No, no!\"] If that\r\n  is true, then why the legislative precautions we have wisely taken\r\n  against the coming of pauper labor to our shores? It is because\r\n  you know, every one of you, that in a contest between two rival\r\n  establishments here, or between two rival countries, that that shop\r\n  or that country that pays the lowest wages--and so produces most\r\n  cheaply--can command the market. If the products of foreign mills\r\n  that pay low wages are admitted here without discriminating duties,\r\n  you know there is only one way to meet such competition, and that\r\n  is by reducing wages in our mills. [Applause.] They seek to entice\r\n  you by the suggestion that you can wear cheaper clothing when free\r\n  access is given to the products of foreign woollen mills; and yet\r\n  they mention also that now, in some of our own cities, the men, and\r\n  especially the women, who are manufacturing the garments we wear\r\n  are not getting adequate wages, and that among some of them there\r\n  is suffering. Do they hope that when the coat is made cheaper the\r\n  wages of the man or woman who makes it will be increased? The power\r\n  of your labor organizations to secure increased wages is greatest\r\n  when there is a large demand for the product you are making at fair\r\n  prices. You do not strike for better wages on a falling market. When\r\n  the mills are running full time, when there is a full demand at good\r\n  prices for the product of your toil, and when warehouses are empty,\r\n  then your organization may effectively insist upon increased wages.\r\n  Did any of you ever see one of the organized efforts for better wages\r\n  succeed when the mill was running on half time, and there was a small\r\n  demand at falling prices in the market for the product? [Applause.]\r\n  The protective system works with your labor organization to secure\r\n  and maintain a just compensation for labor. Whenever it becomes\r\n  true--as it is in some other countries--that the workingman spends\r\n  to-day what he will earn to-morrow, then your labor organizations\r\n  will lose their power. Then the workman becomes in very fact a part\r\n  of the machine he operates. He cannot leave it, for he has eaten\r\n  to-day bread that he is to earn to-morrow. But when he eats to-day\r\n  bread that he earned last week or last year, then he may successfully\r\n  resist any unfair exactions. [Applause.] I do not say that we have\r\n  here an ideal condition. I do not deny that in connection with some\r\n  of our employments the conditions of life are hard. But the practical\r\n  question is this: Is not the condition of our working people on the\r\n  average comparatively a great deal better than that of any other\r\n  country? [Applause and cries of \"Good! Good!\"]\r\n\r\n  If it is, then you will carefully scan all these suggestions before\r\n  you consent that the work of foreign workmen shall supply our market,\r\n  now supplied by the products of the hands of American workmen. I thank\r\n  you again. The day is threatening and cool, and I beg you to excuse\r\n  further public speech. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAt night 200 Pennsylvanians, who came to Indiana to aid in developing\r\nthe natural gas industry, called upon General Harrison at his residence,\r\nunder the direction of a committee composed of Capt. J. C. Gibney, J.\r\nB. Wheeler, and Geo. A. Richards. Their spokesman was Wm. McElwaine, a\r\nfellow-workman.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison addressed them and said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--It is very pleasant for me to meet you to-night in\r\n  my own home. The more informal my intercourse can be made with my\r\n  fellow-citizens the more agreeable it is to me. To you, and all others\r\n  who will come informally to my home, I will give a hearty greeting. I\r\n  am glad to see these representatives from the State of Pennsylvania\r\n  whose business pursuits have called them to make their home with us\r\n  in Indiana. The State of Pennsylvania has a special interest for me\r\n  in the fact that it was the native State of a mother who, though\r\n  nearly forty years dead, still lives affectionately in my memory. I\r\n  welcome you here to this State as those who come to settle among us\r\n  under new conditions of industrial and domestic life, to bring into\r\n  our factories and our homes this new fuel from which we hope so much,\r\n  not only in the promotion of domestic comfort and economy, but in\r\n  the advancement of our manufacturing institutions. Your calling is\r\n  one requiring high skill and intelligence and great fidelity. The\r\n  agent with which you deal is an admirable servant but a dangerous\r\n  master, and through carelessness may bring a peril instead of a\r\n  blessing into our households and into our communities. I am glad that\r\n  Indiana, so long drained upon by the States west of the Mississippi,\r\n  has at last felt in your coming from that stanch, magnificent\r\n  Republican commonwealth some restoration of this drain, which has\r\n  made the struggle for Republican success in Indiana doubtful in our\r\n  previous elections. It is time some of the States east of us, having\r\n  such majorities as Pennsylvania, were contributing not only to our\r\n  business enterprise and prosperity, but to the strengthening of the\r\n  Republican ranks, which have been depleted by the invitations which\r\n  the agricultural States of the West have extended to our enterprising\r\n  young men. I welcome your here to-night, and will be glad to have a\r\n  personal introduction to each of you. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, SEPTEMBER 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nOhio and Illinois did honor this day again to the Republican nominee.\r\nFrom Cleveland came 800 voters; their organizations were the Harrison\r\nBoys in Blue--200 veterans of the Civil War--commanded by Gen. James\r\nBarnett; the Garfield Club, led by Thomas R. Whitehead and Albert M.\r\nLong; the Logan Club, headed by Capt. W. R. Isham, and the German\r\nCentral Club. Prominent in the delegation were Hon. Amos Townsend, John\r\nGibson, and Major Palmer, the blind orator. Gen. E. Myers spoke for the\r\nBuckeyes. The city of Normal, McLean County, Illinois, sent a delegation\r\nof 200 teachers and students of the State Normal School, including 70\r\nladies. Student William Galbraith spoke for his associates.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in response, said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen and Friends_--The organizations represented here this\r\n  morning have for me each an individual interest. Each is suggestive of\r\n  a line of thought which _I_ should be glad to follow, but I cannot, in\r\n  the few moments that I can speak to you in this chilly atmosphere, say\r\n  all that the names and character of your respective clubs suggest as\r\n  appropriate. I welcome those comrades in the Union army in the Civil\r\n  War. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Death wrought its work in ghastly form in those years when,\r\n  patiently, fearlessly, and hopefully, you carried the flag to the\r\n  front and brought it at last in triumph to the Nation's capital.\r\n  [Cheers.] Death, since, in its gentler forms, has been coming into\r\n  the households where the veterans that were spared from shot and\r\n  shell abide. The muster-roll of the living is growing shorter. The\r\n  larger company is being rapidly recruited. You live not alone in the\r\n  memories of the war. Your presence here attests that, as citizens, you\r\n  feel the importance of these civil strifes. You recall the incidents\r\n  of the great war, not in malice, not to stir or revive sectional\r\n  divisions, or to re-mark sectional lines, but because you believe\r\n  that it is good for the Nation that loyalty to the flag and heroism\r\n  in its defence should be remembered and honored. [Cheers.] There is\r\n  not a veteran here, in this Republican Club of veterans, who does not\r\n  desire that the streams of prosperity in the Southern States should\r\n  run bank-full. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  There is not one who does not sympathize with her plague-stricken\r\n  communities, and rejoice in every new evidence of her industrial\r\n  development. The Union veterans have never sought to impose hard\r\n  conditions upon the brave men they vanquished. The generous terms of\r\n  surrender given by General Grant were not alone expressions of his\r\n  own brave, magnanimous nature. The hearts of soldiers who carried\r\n  the gun and the knapsack in his victorious army were as generous as\r\n  his. You were glad to accept the renewal of the Confederate soldier's\r\n  allegiance to the flag as the happy end of all strife; willing that he\r\n  should possess the equal protection and power of a citizenship that\r\n  you had preserved for yourselves and secured to him. [Cheers.] You\r\n  have only asked--and you may confidently submit to the judgment of\r\n  every brave Confederate soldier whether the terms are not fair--that\r\n  the veteran of the Union army shall have, as a voter, an equal\r\n  influence in the affairs of the country that was saved by him for\r\n  both with the man who fought against the flag, and that soldiers of\r\n  neither army shall abridge the rights of others under the law. [Great\r\n  cheering.] Less than that you cannot accept with honor; less than that\r\n  a generous foe would not consent to offer.\r\n\r\n  To the gentlemen of the John A. Logan Club let me say: You have\r\n  chosen a worthy name for your organization. Patriot, soldier, and\r\n  statesman, Logan's memory will live in the affectionate admiration of\r\n  his comrades and in the respect of all his opponents. His home State\r\n  was Illinois, but his achievements were national.\r\n\r\n  To these German-American Republicans I give a most cordial welcome.\r\n  You have been known in our politics as a people well informed upon all\r\n  the great economic questions that have arisen for settlement. You have\r\n  always been faithful to an honest currency. [Cheers.] The enticements\r\n  of depreciated money did not win you from sound principle. You bravely\r\n  stood for a paper currency that should be the true equivalent of coin.\r\n  [Cries of \"Good! Good!\"] Those who, like your people, have learned\r\n  the lessons of thrift and economy in your old-country homes, and\r\n  have brought them here with you, realized that above all things the\r\n  laborer needed honest money that would not shrink in his hands when\r\n  it had paid him for an honest day's toil. And now, when another great\r\n  economic question is pressing for determination, I do not doubt that\r\n  you will as wisely and as resolutely help to settle that also.\r\n\r\n  As the great German chancellor, that student of human government\r\n  and affairs, turning his thoughtful study toward the history of\r\n  our country since the war, has declared that in his judgment our\r\n  protective tariff system was the source of our strength, that by\r\n  reason of it we were able to deal with a war debt that seemed to be\r\n  appalling and insurmountable, I do not doubt that you, too, men who\r\n  believe in work and in thrift, and so many of whom are everywhere\r\n  sheltered under a roof of their own, will unite with us in this\r\n  struggle to preserve our American market for our own workingmen, and\r\n  to maintain here a living standard of wages. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  To these students who come fresh from the class-room to give me a\r\n  greeting this morning I also return my sincere thanks. I suggest to\r\n  them that they be not only students of books and maxims, but also of\r\n  men and markets; that in the study of the tariff question they do not\r\n  forget, as so many do, that they are Americans.\r\n\r\n  I thank you all again for your visit. I regret that I am not able\r\n  to give you, in my own home, a personal and more cordial greeting. My\r\n  house is not large enough to receive you. [A voice, \"Your heart is!\"]\r\n  Yes, I have room enough in my heart for all. [Great cheering.] I am\r\n  very sincerely grateful for these evidences of your personal regard.\r\n  Out of them all; out of the coming of these frequent and enthusiastic\r\n  crowds of my fellow-citizens; out of all these kind words; out of\r\n  these kind faces of men and women; out of the hearty \"God-speeds\" you\r\n  give me, I hope to bring an inspiration and an endowment for whatever\r\n  may be before me in life, whether I shall walk in private or public\r\n  paths. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nThe largest delegation of the day, numbering over a thousand business\r\nmen, arrived from Chicago, after stopping _en route_ at several\r\nimportant points, where their orators, Gen. H. H. Thomas, George\r\nDrigg, and Judge John W. Green, made speeches. Their notable political\r\norganizations were the First Tippecanoe Club of Chicago, 100 veterans\r\nof 1840, led by Dr. D. S. Smith; the Logan Club, and the Twelfth Ward\r\nRepublican Club, led by Charles Catlin, E. S. Taylor, Wm. Wilkes, and\r\nJoseph Dixon. Judge Green and Dr. Smith delivered addresses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Illinois Friends_--It is a source of great regret to me that\r\n  we are not able to make your reception more comfortable. The chill\r\n  of this September evening and of this open grove is not suggestive\r\n  of the hospitable and cordial welcome that our people would have\r\n  been glad to extend to you. Our excuse for this time may be found\r\n  in the vastness of this assemblage. I am pleased to have this fresh\r\n  and imposing evidence of the enthusiasm and interest of the Illinois\r\n  Republicans. [Cheers.] There is nothing in the great history of\r\n  the Republican party that need make any man blush to own himself a\r\n  Republican. [Cheers.] There is much to kindle the enthusiasm of all\r\n  lovers of their country. We do not rest in the past, but we rejoice in\r\n  it. [Cheers.] The Republican party has so consistently followed the\r\n  teachings of those great Americans whose names the world reveres that\r\n  we may appropriately hold a Republican convention on the birthday of\r\n  any one of them. [Cheers.] The calendar of our political saints does\r\n  not omit one name that was conspicuous in peace or war. [Cheers.] We\r\n  can celebrate Jackson's birthday or the anniversary of the battle of\r\n  New Orleans because he stood for the unity of the Nation, and his\r\n  victory confirmed it in the respect of the world. [Great cheering.]\r\n  There is no song of patriotism that we do not sing in our meetings.\r\n  There is no marble that has been builded to perpetuate the glory\r\n  of our soldiers about which we may not appropriately assemble and\r\n  proclaim the principles that we advocate. [Cheers.] We believe in our\r\n  country, and give it our love and first care. We have always advocated\r\n  that policy in legislation which was promotive of the interests and\r\n  honor of our country. [Cheers.] I will not discuss any particular\r\n  public topic to-day, as the conditions are so unfavorable for out-door\r\n  speaking. Let me thank you again for this cordial evidence of your\r\n  interest and for the personal respect which you have shown to me.\r\n  I hope you will believe that my heart is deeply touched in these\r\n  manifestations of the friendliness of my fellow-citizens. If in\r\n  anything I shall come short of the high expectations and hopes they\r\n  have formed, it will not be because I do not feel myself put under\r\n  the highest obligations by these evidences of their friendly regard\r\n  to do my utmost to continue in their respect and confidence. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth week of General Harrison's public receptions opened\r\nthis date with the arrival of an enthusiastic Republican club from\r\nthe distant city of Tower, Minn., most of whose members were engaged\r\nin the iron industry. They left a huge specimen of Vermilion range\r\niron ore--weighing over 500 pounds--in the front yard of the Harrison\r\nresidence. Prominent in the delegation were Dr. Fred Barnett, Capt.\r\nElisha Marcom, S. F. White, Chas. R. Haines, John Owens, W. N. Shepard,\r\nN. H. Bassett, S. J. Noble, J. E. Bacon, J. B. Noble, Frank Burke, W. H.\r\nWickes, Chas. L. White, A. Nichaud, D. McKinley, and Page Norris; also\r\nGeo. M. Smith and W. H. Cruikshank, of Duluth.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the reception of the Minnesota visitors came two\r\nlarge delegations from Fulton and Marshall counties, Indiana. The Fulton\r\nleaders were J. H. Bibler, Dr. W. S. Shafer, Dr. E. Z. Capell, Arthur\r\nHoward, Samuel Heftly, Henry Mow, C. D. Sisson, Arch Stinson, J. F.\r\nCollins, A. F. Bowers, W. J. Howard, and T. M. Bitters, of Rochester.\r\nM. L. Essick was their spokesman. Among the prominent members of the\r\nMarshall County delegation were M. W. Simons, John W. Parks, J. W.\r\nSiders, Edward McCoy, M. S. Smith, John V. Astley, Enoch Baker, I.\r\nH. Watson, and Abram Shafer, of Plymouth. H. G. Thayer delivered the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Indiana Friends_--This is a home company to-day. Usually our\r\n  Indiana visitors have met here delegations from other States. I am\r\n  sure you will understand that I place a special value upon these\r\n  evidences of the interest Indiana Republicans are taking in the\r\n  campaign. Whatever the fate of the battle may be elsewhere, it is\r\n  always a source of pride to the soldier and to his leader that the\r\n  part of the line confided to their care held fast. [Applause.] I feel\r\n  that I ought also to acknowledge the friendliness and co-operation\r\n  which has been already extended to us in this campaign by many who\r\n  have differed with us heretofore. [Applause.] It is encouraging to\r\n  hear that the prosperous and intelligent farmers of Marshall and\r\n  Fulton counties have not been misled by the attempt to separate the\r\n  agricultural vote from the vote of the shop. It has seemed to me\r\n  that the Mills bill was framed for the purpose of driving from the\r\n  protection column the agricultural voters, not by showing them favor,\r\n  but the reverse--by placing agricultural products on the free list,\r\n  thus withdrawing from the farmer the direct benefits he is receiving\r\n  from our tariff laws as affecting the products of his labor, hoping\r\n  that the farmers might then be relied upon to pull down the rest\r\n  of the structure. I am glad to believe that we have in Indiana a\r\n  class of farmers too intelligent to be caught by these unfriendly\r\n  and fallacious propositions. [Applause.] I had to-day a visit from\r\n  twenty or more gentlemen who came from the town of Tower, in the\r\n  most northern part of Minnesota, where, within the last four years,\r\n  there has been discovered and developed a great deposit of iron ore\r\n  especially adapted to the manufacture of steel. Within the four years\r\n  since these mines were opened they tell me that about a million tons\r\n  of ore have been mined and sent to the furnaces. They also mentioned\r\n  the fact that arrangements are already being made to bring block coal\r\n  of Indiana to the mouth of these iron mines, that the work of smelting\r\n  may be done there. This is a good illustration of the interlocking of\r\n  interests between widely separated States of the Union [applause]--a\r\n  new market and a larger demand for Indiana coal.\r\n\r\n  The attempt is often made to create the impression that only\r\n  particular classes of workingmen are benefited by a protective tariff.\r\n  There can be nothing more untrue. The wages of all labor--labor upon\r\n  the farm, labor upon our streets--has a direct and essential relation\r\n  to the scale of wages that is paid to skilled labor. [Applause.] One\r\n  might as well say that you could bring down the price of a higher\r\n  grade of cotton cloth without affecting the price of lower grades\r\n  as to say that you can degrade the price of skilled labor without\r\n  dragging down the wages of unskilled labor. [Applause.] This attempt\r\n  to classify and schedule the men who are benefited by a protective\r\n  tariff is utterly deceptive. [Applause.] The benefits are felt by all\r\n  classes of our people--by the farmer as well as by the workmen in\r\n  our mills; by the man who works on the street as well as the skilled\r\n  laborer who works in the mill; by the women in the household, and by\r\n  the children who are now in the schools and might otherwise be in the\r\n  mills. [Applause.] It is a policy broad enough to embrace within the\r\n  scope of its beneficent influence all our population. [Applause.]\r\n  I thank you for your visit, and will be glad to meet any of you\r\n  personally who desire to speak to me. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Porter-Columbian Club, a local organization named in honor of\r\nGovernor Porter, with a membership of 700 workingmen, paid their\r\nrespects to General Harrison on this night, commanded by their President\r\nand founder, Marshall C. Woods, who delivered an address.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in reply, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Woods and my Friends_--My voice is not in condition to speak at\r\n  much length in this cool night air. I am very deeply grateful for this\r\n  evidence of the respect of this large body of Indianapolis workingmen.\r\n  I am glad to be assured by what has been said to me that you realize\r\n  that this campaign has a special interest for the wage-earners of\r\n  America. [Cries of \"Good! Good!\"]\r\n\r\n  That is the first question in life with you, because it involves the\r\n  subsistence and comfort of your families. I do not wonder then that,\r\n  out of so many different associations in life, you have come together\r\n  into this organization to express your determination to vote for the\r\n  maintenance of the American system of protection. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I think you can all understand that it is not good for American\r\n  workingmen that the amount of work to be done in this country should\r\n  be diminished by transferring some of it to foreign shops. [Applause.]\r\n  Nor ought the wages paid for the work that is done here to be\r\n  diminished by bringing you into competition with the underpaid labor\r\n  of the old country. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am not speaking any new sentiment to-night. Many times before the\r\n  Chicago convention I have, in public addresses, expressed the opinion\r\n  that every workingman ought to have such wages as would not only yield\r\n  him a decent and comfortable support for his family, and enable him\r\n  to keep his children in school and out of the mill in their tender\r\n  age, but would allow him to lay up against incapacity by sickness or\r\n  accident, or for old age, some fund on which he could rely. These\r\n  views I entertain to-night. I beg you to excuse further public speech\r\n  and to allow me to receive personally such of you as care to speak to\r\n  me. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree States did homage to the Republican nominee this date. From Grand\r\nRapids and Muskegon, Mich., came 500 visitors, under the auspices of the\r\nBelknap Club of Grand Rapids. The wife of Governor Luce was a member\r\nof the delegation, accompanied by R. C. Luce and W. A. Davitt. Other\r\nprominent members were: Judge F. J. Russell, Hon. A. B. Turner, Col. C.\r\nT. Foote, J. B. Pantlind, Don J. Leathers, Col. E. S. Pierce, Wm. A.\r\nGavett, H. J. Felker, D. G. Crotty, H. J. Stevens, Aldrich Tateum, Louis\r\nKanitz, A. E. Yerex, and N. McGraft, of Grand Rapids; Thomas A. Parish\r\nand Geo. Turner, of Grand Haven; and John J. Cappon, of Holland. John\r\nPatton, Jr., of Grand Rapids, was orator.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio visitors came from Tiffin, Seneca County, led by the venerable\r\nA. C. Baldwin, Capt. John McCormick, Albert Corthell, Capt. Edward\r\nJones, Edward Naylor, and J. B. Rosenburger. The wife of Gen. Wm. H.\r\nGibson was an honored guest of the delegation, accompanied by Mrs.\r\nRobert Lysle and Mrs. Root. J. K. Rohn was spokesman for the Ohio\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nThe third delegation comprised 1,200 voters from Jay County, Indiana,\r\nled by Gen. N. Shepherd, Theodore Bailey, Richard A. Green, John Geiger,\r\nE. J. Marsh, Frank H. Snyder, and M. V. Moudy, of Portland. Jesse M. La\r\nFollette was their speaker.\r\n\r\nTo these several addresses General Harrison, in response, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana Friends_--These cordial\r\n  manifestations of your personal regard move me very deeply [applause],\r\n  but I do not at all appropriate to myself the great expressions of\r\n  popular interest of which this meeting is only one. I understand\r\n  that my relation to these public questions and to the people is a\r\n  representative one--that the interest which thus expresses itself is\r\n  in principles of government rather than in men. [Cheers.] I am one\r\n  of the oldest Republicans; my first presidential vote was given to\r\n  the first Republican candidate for that office [applause], and it has\r\n  always been a source of profound gratification to me that, in peace\r\n  and war, a high spirit of patriotism and devotion to our country has\r\n  always pervaded and dominated the party. [Cheers.] When, during the\r\n  Civil War, the clouds hung low, disasters thickened, and the future\r\n  was crowded with uncanny fears, never did any Republican convention\r\n  assemble without declaring its faith in the ultimate triumph of our\r\n  cause [great cheering]; and now, with a broad patriotism that embraces\r\n  and regards the interests of all the States, it advocates policies\r\n  that will develop and unite all our communities in the friendly and\r\n  profitable interchange of commerce as well as in a lasting political\r\n  union. [Applause.] These great Western States will not respond to\r\n  the attempt to excite prejudice against New England. We advocate\r\n  measures that are as broad as our national domain; that are calculated\r\n  to distil their equal blessing upon all the land. [Cheers.] The\r\n  people of the great West recognize and value the great contribution\r\n  which those commonwealths about Plymouth Rock have made to the\r\n  civilization, material growth, and manhood of our Western States.\r\n  [Cheers.] We are not envious of the prosperity of New England; we\r\n  rejoice in it. We believe that the protective policy developed her\r\n  great manufacturing institutions and made her rich, and we do not\r\n  doubt that a continuance of that policy will produce the same results\r\n  in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. [Cheers.] We are not content to remain\r\n  wholly agricultural States in our relations to either New England or\r\n  old England. [Applause.] We believe that in all these great Western\r\n  States there are minerals in the soil and energy and skill in the\r\n  brains and arms of our people that will yet so multiply and develop\r\n  our manufacturing industries as to give us a nearer home market for\r\n  much of the products of our soil. [Cheers.] And for that great surplus\r\n  which now and always, perhaps, we shall not consume at home we think\r\n  a New England market better than a foreign market. [Enthusiastic and\r\n  prolonged cheering.] The issue upon this great industrial question\r\n  is drawn as sharply as the lines were ever drawn between contending\r\n  armies. Men are readjusting their party relations upon this great\r\n  question. The appeal that is now made for the defence of our American\r\n  system is finding its response, and many of those who are opposed to\r\n  us upon other questions are committing such questions to the future\r\n  for settlement, while they help us to settle now and for an indefinite\r\n  future the great question of the preservation of our commercial\r\n  independence. [Applause.] The Democratic party has challenged our\r\n  protected industries to a fight of extermination. The wage-earners of\r\n  our country have accepted the challenge. The issue of the contest will\r\n  settle for many years our tariff policy. [Prolonged cheering.] The\r\n  eloquent descriptions to which we have listened of the material wealth\r\n  of the great State of Michigan have been full of interest to us as\r\n  citizens of Indiana. We cannot doubt that the people of a State having\r\n  such generous invitations to the developments of great home wealth in\r\n  manufacturing and mining pursuits will understand the issue that is\r\n  presented, and will cast their influence in favor of that policy which\r\n  will make that development rapid and sure; and more than all, and\r\n  better than all, will maintain in her communities a well-paid class\r\n  of wage-workers. [Cheers.] Our wage-workers vote; they are American\r\n  citizens, and it is essential that they be kept free from the slavery\r\n  of want and the discontents bred of injustice. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I thank my Michigan friends for these handsome specimens of the\r\n  products of their mines and of their mills. I shall cherish them with\r\n  grateful recollection of this pleasant visit. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  To my Indiana friends, always generous, I return my thanks for this\r\n  new evidence of their esteem. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  To my Ohio friends, who so often before have visited me with kind\r\n  expressions of their regard, I return the thanks of a native-born\r\n  Ohioan. [Prolonged cheers from the Ohio delegation.]\r\n\r\n  Three great States are grouped here to-day. I remember at Resaca,\r\n  when the field and staff of the regiments that were to make the\r\n  assault were ordered to dismount, there was a Michigan officer too\r\n  sick to go on foot and too proud to subject himself to the imputation\r\n  of cowardice by staying behind.\r\n\r\n  He rode alone, the one horseman in that desperate charge, and\r\n  died on that bloody hillside rather than subject his State to the\r\n  imputation that one of her sons had lingered when the enemy was to be\r\n  engaged. He was a noble type of the brave men these great States gave\r\n  to the country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nWisconsin and Indiana were the States represented at this day's\r\nreception. The Wisconsin visitors came from Madison, Janesville, and\r\nBeloit. Prominent among them were General Atwood, editor Wisconsin\r\n_State Journal_, Surgeon-General Palmer, W. T. Van Kirk, and T. G.\r\nMaudt. R. C. Spooner spoke for the Badgers.\r\n\r\nFountain County, Indiana, sent 2,000 visitors, led by a club of\r\nTippecanoe veterans. Among their representative men were H. La Tourette,\r\nW. W. Layton, John H. Spence, of Covington; A. H. Clark, and W. H.\r\nMalory, of Veedersburg; A. S. Peacock, H. C. Martin, and C. E. Holm, of\r\nAttica. Capt. Benj. Hegeler, of Attica, delivered the address on behalf\r\nof the Hoosiers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Wisconsin and my Indiana Friends_--These great daily\r\n  manifestations of the interest of great masses of our people in the\r\n  principles represented by the Republican party are to me increasingly\r\n  impressive. I am glad to-day that Indiana has opportunity to welcome\r\n  a delegation from the magnificent State of Wisconsin. [Cheers.] It\r\n  offers a fitting opportunity to acknowledge my personal obligation and\r\n  the obligation of the Indiana Republicans for the early and constant\r\n  support which Wisconsin gave to the efforts of the Indiana delegation\r\n  in the Chicago convention. [Prolonged cheers.] To-day two States, not\r\n  contiguous in territory, but touching in many interests, are met to\r\n  express the fact that these great electoral contests affect all our\r\n  people. It is not alone in the choice of Presidential electors that\r\n  we have common interests. Our national Congress, though chosen in\r\n  separate districts, legislates for all our people. Wisconsin has a\r\n  direct interest that the ballot shall be free and pure in Indiana, and\r\n  Wisconsin and Indiana have a direct interest that the ballot shall be\r\n  free and pure in all the States. [Great cheering.] Therefore let no\r\n  man say that it is none of our business how elections are conducted in\r\n  other States. [Cheers.] I believe that this great question of a free\r\n  ballot, so much disturbed by race questions in the South, would be\r\n  settled this year if the men of the South who believe with us upon the\r\n  great question of the protection of American industries would throw\r\n  off old prejudices and vote their convictions upon that question.\r\n  [Cheers and cries of \"Good! Good!\"] I believe there are indications\r\n  that the independent manhood of the South will this year strongly\r\n  manifest itself in this direction. Those intelligent and progressive\r\n  citizens of the South who are seeking to build up within their own\r\n  States diversified industries will not much longer be kept in bondage\r\n  to the traditions of the days when the South was wholly a community of\r\n  planters.\r\n\r\n  When they assert their belief in a protective tariff, by supporting\r\n  the only party that advocates that policy, the question of a free\r\n  ballot, so far as it is a Southern question, will be settled forever,\r\n  for they will have the power to insist that those who believe with\r\n  them shall vote, and that their votes shall be counted. [Applause.]\r\n  The protective policy, by developing a home supply and limiting\r\n  importations, helps us to maintain the balance of trade upon our side\r\n  in our dealings with the world. [Cheers.] Under the tariff of 1846\r\n  from the year 1850 to 1860 the balance of trade was continuously\r\n  against us, aggregating in that period over three hundred millions\r\n  of dollars. Under the influence of a protective tariff the balance\r\n  of trade has been generally and largely with us, unless disturbed\r\n  by special conditions. Instead of sending our gold abroad to pay a\r\n  foreign balance we have usually been bringing foreign gold here to\r\n  augment our store. [Cheers.] I will not detain you further. These\r\n  daily demands upon me make it necessary that I shall speak briefly.\r\n  Let me thank most profoundly those gentlemen and ladies from Wisconsin\r\n  who have come so far to bring me this tribute of their respect. I very\r\n  highly value it. These, my Indiana friends, unite with me in thanking\r\n  you for your presence to-day. [Cheers from the Indianians.] To my\r\n  nearer friends, my Fountain County friends, let me say I am profoundly\r\n  grateful to you for this large and imposing demonstration and for the\r\n  interest you are individually taking in this campaign. [Cheers.] I\r\n  do not think of it as a personal campaign. It has always seemed to\r\n  me to be altogether greater than that, and when I thank you for your\r\n  interest and commend your zeal it is an interest in principles and a\r\n  zeal for the truth that I approve. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, October 6, was one of the great days of the campaign. The\r\nfirst delegation, numbering 2,000, came from Wells and Blackford\r\ncounties, Indiana. Conspicuous in their ranks were two large uniformed\r\nclubs of ladies, one from Montpelier, and the Carrie Harrison Club of\r\nBluffton. In the Wells County contingent were many 1840 veterans and\r\n21 newly-converted Democrats. Their leaders were Asbury Duglay, D. H.\r\nSwaim, B. W. Bowman, Peter Ulmer, Silas Wisner, Joseph Milholland, J.\r\nC. Hatfield, and T. A. Doan. J. J. Todd was their spokesman. Prominent\r\nin the Blackford delegation were Frank Geisler, H. M. Campbell, W. L.\r\nRitter, Eli Hamilton, R. V. Ervin, W. A. Williams, John Sipe, and John\r\nCantwell, of Hartford City; J. C. Summerville, Wm. Pugh, J. H. Morrical,\r\nG. A. Mason, John G. Ward, and J. M. Tinsley, of Montpelier. Hon. B. G.\r\nShinn delivered the address on behalf of the Blackford people.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison confined his speech to State questions. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Wells and Blackford County Friends_--I am glad to meet you.\r\n  It is extremely gratifying to be assured by your presence here\r\n  this inclement day, and by the kind words which you have addressed\r\n  to me through your representatives, that I have some part in your\r\n  friendly regard as an individual. But individuals are not of the\r\n  first importance. That man who thinks that the prosperity of this\r\n  country or the right administration of its affairs is wholly dependent\r\n  upon him grossly exaggerates his value. The essential things to us\r\n  are the principles of government upon which our institutions were\r\n  builded, and by and through which we make that symmetrical and safe\r\n  growth which has characterized our Nation in the past, and which is\r\n  yet to raise it to a higher place among the nations of the earth.\r\n  [Applause.] We are Indianians--Hoosiers, if you please [cheers]--and\r\n  are proud of the State of which we are citizens. Your spokesmen have\r\n  referred with an honest pride to the counties from which you have\r\n  come, and that is well. But I would like to suggest to you that\r\n  every political community and neighborhood has a character of its\r\n  own, a moral character, as well as every man and every woman, and it\r\n  is exceedingly important, looked at even from the side of material\r\n  advantage, that our communities should maintain a good reputation\r\n  for social order, intelligence, virtue, and a faithful and willing\r\n  obedience to law. [Applause.] It cannot be doubted that such a\r\n  character possessed by any State or county attracts immigration and\r\n  capital, advances its material development, and enhances the value\r\n  of its farms. There has been much in the history of Indiana that is\r\n  exceedingly creditable. There have been some things--there are some\r\n  things to-day--that are exceedingly discreditable to us as a political\r\n  community; things that I believe retard the advancement of our State\r\n  and affect its material prosperity by degrading it in the estimation\r\n  of right-thinking men. One of those things is this patent and open\r\n  fact: that the great benevolent institutions of this State, instead\r\n  of being operated upon the high plane that public charities should\r\n  occupy, are being operated and managed upon the lowest plane of party\r\n  purposes and advantage. [Cries of \"That's so!\"] Another such thing is\r\n  of recent occurrence. In the campaign of 1886, after advising with\r\n  the chief law officer of the State, a Democratic Governor declared\r\n  to the people of this State that there was a vacancy in the office\r\n  of Lieutenant-Governor which the people were entitled to fill at the\r\n  ensuing general election. The Democratic party acted upon that advice,\r\n  assembled in convention in this hall, and nominated John C. Nelson\r\n  for Lieutenant-Governor. The Republican party followed with their\r\n  convention, and placed in nomination that gallant soldier, Robert S.\r\n  Robertson. [Cheers.] These two gentlemen went before the people of\r\n  Indiana and made a public canvass for the office. The election was\r\n  held, and Colonel Robertson was chosen by a majority of about 3,000.\r\n  [Applause.] Is there a man in the State, Democratic or Republican,\r\n  who doubts that if the choice had been otherwise, and Mr. Nelson\r\n  had received a majority at the polls, the House of Representatives,\r\n  which was Republican, would have met with the Democratic Senate in an\r\n  orderly joint meeting, for canvassing the votes, and that Mr. Nelson\r\n  would have been inaugurated as Lieutenant-Governor? [Cries of \"No,\r\n  no!\"] But the result was otherwise; and the public fame, the good\r\n  reputation of this State, was dishonored when, by force and brutal\r\n  methods, the voice of the people was stifled, and the man they had\r\n  chosen was excluded from the right to exercise the duties of the\r\n  office of Lieutenant-Governor. [Cries of \"Yes, yes!\"] Do the people\r\n  think that the attractiveness of Indiana as a home for Americans who\r\n  believe in social order and popular government has been increased\r\n  by this violent and disgraceful incident? Do our Democratic friends\r\n  who have an honest State pride, who would like to maintain the honor\r\n  and good reputation of the State, who would have the people of our\r\n  sister States believe that we have a people who believe in a warm\r\n  canvass but in a free ballot, and a manly and ready acquiescence in\r\n  election results, intend to support their leaders in this violent\r\n  exclusion from office of a duly chosen public officer? Do those\r\n  who are Democrats from principle, and not for personal spoils,\r\n  intend to support the men who have first prostituted our benevolent\r\n  institutions to party and now to personal advantage? These things, if\r\n  not reproved and corrected by our people, will not only disgrace us in\r\n  the estimation of all good people, but will substantially retard the\r\n  material development of the State. [Cheers.] I am not talking to-day\r\n  of questions in which I have any other interest than that you have,\r\n  my fellow-citizens. [Applause.] I believe the material prosperity of\r\n  Indiana, much more the honor, will be advanced if her people in this\r\n  State election shall rebuke the shameless election frauds that have\r\n  recently scandalized our State, the prostitution of our benevolent\r\n  institutions, and the wanton violence that overturned the result of\r\n  the popular election in 1886. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO VETERANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great event of the day was the reception tendered the veterans and\r\ncitizens from Chicago, Hyde Park, Pullman, South Chicago, and the town\r\nof Lake. They numbered over 3,000, and arrived in the evening, after\r\nstopping _en route_ at Danville, Ill., and Crawfordsville, Ind., to\r\nparticipate in demonstrations. The Chicago contingent comprised 800\r\nmembers of the Union Veteran Club, commanded by its President, Capt.\r\nJohn J. Healy; 600 members of the Veteran Union League, led by Capt.\r\nJames J. Healy; the Blaine Club, Second Regiment Band, and many smaller\r\nclubs. Leaders in the delegation were Major McCarty, Col. Dan. W. Munn,\r\nHon. Stephen A. Douglas, Jr., S. W. King, Charles H. Hann, and others.\r\nHyde Park sent several hundred rolling-mill men; the city of Pullman 200\r\ncar-builders; the town of Lake--\"the largest village in the world\"--was\r\nrepresented by a flambeau club, the Lake View Screw Club, and numerous\r\nother organizations. Their leading representatives were Col. J.\r\nHodgkins, Judge C. M. Hawley, Hon. John E. Cowells, Hon. B. E. Hoppin,\r\nGeo. C. Ingham, Judge Freen, Hon. L. D. Condee, Joseph Hardacre, Edward\r\nMaher, M. J. McGrath, A. G. Proctor, Frank I. Bennett, and Col. Foster.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were met by about 10,000 citizens and escorted to Tomlinson\r\nHall. When General Harrison appeared, accompanied by Judge E. B.\r\nMartindale, Chairman of the Reception Committee, there ensued a scene\r\nnever to be forgotten by those who witnessed it. The 6,000 people\r\npresent arose to their chairs, surrounding the visiting veterans, all\r\nfrantically waving flags and banners. The demonstration continued\r\nwithout abatement for ten minutes. General Harrison stood as if dazed by\r\nthe spectacle. Finally ex-Governor Hamilton, of Illinois, secured quiet,\r\nand on behalf of the veterans addressed the gathering, followed by Judge\r\nE. W. Keightly on behalf of the Hyde Park visitors.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's response was by many regarded as his greatest speech\r\nof the campaign. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades and Friends_--It is a rare sight, and it is one very\r\n  full of interest to us as citizens of Indiana, to see this great\r\n  hall filled with the people of another State, come to evidence their\r\n  interest in great principles of government. [Cheers.] I welcome\r\n  to-night for myself and for our people this magnificent delegation\r\n  from Chicago and Hyde Park. [Cheers.] We have not before in the\r\n  procession of these great delegations seen its equal in numbers,\r\n  enthusiasm, and cordiality. I thank you profoundly for whatever of\r\n  personal respect there is in this demonstration [cheers]; but above\r\n  all, as an American citizen, I rejoice in this convincing proof that\r\n  our people realize the gravity and urgency of the issues involved in\r\n  this campaign. [Cheers.] I am glad to know that this interest pervades\r\n  all classes of our people. [Cheers.] This delegation, composed of the\r\n  business men of Chicago and of the men who wield the hammer in the\r\n  shops, shows a common interest in the right decision of these great\r\n  questions. [Great cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Our Government is not a government by classes or for classes of\r\n  our fellow-citizens. [Cheers.] It is a government of the people and\r\n  by the people. [Renewed cheering.] Its wise legislation distills its\r\n  equal blessings upon the homes of the rich and the poor. [Cheers.] I\r\n  am especially glad that these skilled, intelligent workmen coming out\r\n  of your great workshops have manifested, by their coming, to their\r\n  fellow-workmen throughout the country their appreciation of what is\r\n  involved for them in this campaign. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n  May that God who has so long blessed us as a Nation long defer that\r\n  evil day when penury shall be a constant guest in the homes of our\r\n  working people, and long preserve to us that intelligent, thrifty\r\n  and cheerful body of workmen that was our strength in war and is our\r\n  guaranty of social order in time of peace! [Great cheering.] Comrades\r\n  of the Civil War, it was true of the great Union army, as it is said\r\n  to be of the kingdom of heaven--not many rich. [Cheers.] It was out of\r\n  the homes of our working people the great army came. It was the strong\r\n  arm inured to labor on the farm or in the shop that bore up the flag\r\n  in the smoke of battle, carried it through storms of shell and shot,\r\n  and lifted it again in honor over our national Capital. [Prolonged\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n  After so many historical illustrations of the evil effects of\r\n  abandoning the policy of protection for that of a revenue tariff,\r\n  we are again confronted by the suggestion that the principle of\r\n  protection shall be eliminated from our tariff legislation. Have we\r\n  not had enough of such experiments? Does not the history of our tariff\r\n  legislation tell us that every revenue tariff has been followed by\r\n  business and industrial crashes, and that a return to the policy\r\n  of protection has stimulated our industries and set our throbbing\r\n  workshops again in motion? [Cheers.] And yet, again and again, the\r\n  Democratic party comes forward with this pernicious proposition--for\r\n  it has been from that party always that the proposition to abandon our\r\n  protective policy and to substitute a revenue tariff has come. [Cries\r\n  of \"That's so!\"]\r\n\r\n  I had placed in my hands yesterday a copy of the London News for\r\n  September 13. The editor says in substance that, judging the purposes\r\n  of the Democratic party by the executive message of last December,\r\n  the English people were justified in believing that party meant free\r\n  trade; but if they were to accept the more recent utterances of its\r\n  leader, protesting that that was not their purpose, then the editor\r\n  thus states the issue presented by the Democratic party. I read but\r\n  a single sentence: \"It is, at any rate, a contest between protection\r\n  and something that is not protection.\" [Prolonged and wild cheering.]\r\n  It is not of the smallest interest to you what that other thing is.\r\n  [Continued cheering.] It is enough to know that it is not protection.\r\n  [Renewed cheering.] Those who defend the present Democratic policy\r\n  declare that our people not only pay the tariff duty upon all imported\r\n  goods, but that a corresponding amount is added to the price of every\r\n  domestic competing article. That for every dollar that is paid into\r\n  the Treasury in the form of a customs duty the people pay several\r\n  dollars more in the enhanced cost of the domestic competing article.\r\n  Those who honestly hold such doctrines cannot stop short of the\r\n  absolute destruction of our protective system. [Cries of \"No, no!\"]\r\n  The man who preaches such doctrines and denies that he is on the road\r\n  to free trade is like the man who takes passage on a train scheduled\r\n  from here to Cincinnati without a stop, and when the train is speeding\r\n  on its way at the rate of forty miles an hour, denies that he is going\r\n  to Cincinnati. [Great laughter and cheering.] The impulse of such\r\n  logic draws toward free trade as surely and swiftly as that engine\r\n  pulls the train to its appointed destination. It inevitably brings us\r\n  to the English rule of levying duties only upon such articles as we do\r\n  not produce at home, such as tea and coffee. That is purely revenue\r\n  tariff, and is practically free trade.\r\n\r\n  Against this the Republican party proposes that our tariff duty\r\n  shall be of an intelligent purpose, be levied chiefly upon competing\r\n  articles. [Cheers.] That our American workmen shall have the benefit\r\n  of discriminating duties upon the products of their labor. [Cheers.]\r\n  The Democratic policy increases importation, and, by so much,\r\n  diminishes the work to be done in America. It transfers work from the\r\n  shops of South Chicago to Birmingham. [Cries of \"Right you are!\"]\r\n  For, if a certain amount of any manufactured article is necessary for\r\n  a year's supply to our people, and we increase the amount that is\r\n  brought from abroad, by just so much we diminish the amount that is\r\n  made at home, and in just that proportion we throw out of employment\r\n  the men that are working here. And not only so, but when this equal\r\n  competition is established between our shops and the foreign shops,\r\n  there is not a man here who does not know that the only condition\r\n  under which the American shop can run at all is that it shall reduce\r\n  the wages of its employees to the level of the wages paid in the\r\n  competing shops abroad. [Cheers.] This is, briefly, the whole story.\r\n  I believe we should look after and protect our American workingmen;\r\n  therefore I am a Republican. [Renewed enthusiastic cheering.]\r\n\r\n  But I will not detain you longer. [Cries of \"Go on!\"] You must\r\n  excuse me; I have been going on for three months. [A voice, \"And\r\n  you'll go on for four years!\"] I am somewhat under restraint in what I\r\n  can say, and others here are somewhat under restraint as to what they\r\n  can appropriately say in my presence. I beg you therefore to allow me,\r\n  after thanking you again for your kindness, to retire that others who\r\n  are here may address you. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers the greatest day of the Indiana campaign was\r\nThursday, October 11, when over 50,000 visitors arrived from all points\r\nin Indiana and along the border counties of Ohio to participate in the\r\ngreeting to the Hon. James G. Blaine, who was the guest of General\r\nHarrison.\r\n\r\nFrom the balcony of the New-Denison Hotel General and Mrs. Harrison,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Blaine, Gen. Adam King, of Baltimore; Col. A. L.\r\nSnowden and Gen. D. H. Hastings, of Pennsylvania; Col. M. J. Murray, of\r\nMassachusetts; Gen. W. C. Plummer, of Dakota; Corporal James Tanner,\r\nof New York; ex-Senator Ferry, of Michigan; Hon. R. W. Thompson,\r\nex-Governor A. G. Porter, Hon. J. N. Huston, Gen. A. P. Hovey, and Ira\r\nJ. Chase, reviewed probably the greatest political parade ever witnessed\r\nin this country outside of the city of New York. Twenty-five thousand\r\nmen constituted the marching column, in nine great divisions, commanded\r\nby Col. Charles S. Millard, Chief Marshal, with Gen. James S. Carnahan,\r\nChief of Staff, and 200 aids. The division commanders and principal aids\r\nwere:\r\n\r\nFirst Division, Gen. N. R. Ruckle, of Indianapolis. Chief of Staff,\r\nCharles J. Many, of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nSecond Division, Capt. H. M. Caylor, of Noblesville. Chief of Staff,\r\nMajor J. M. Watt, of Delphi.\r\n\r\nThird Division, John W. Lovett, of Anderson. Chief of Staff, Col. George\r\nParker.\r\n\r\nFourth Division, Gen. Tom Bennett, of Richmond. Chief of Staff, Capt.\r\nIra B. Myers, of Peru.\r\n\r\nFifth Division, Col. T. C. Burnside, of Liberty. Chief of Staff, J. W.\r\nReam, of Muncie.\r\n\r\nSixth Division, Col. J. M. Story, of Franklin. Chief of Staff, Capt.\r\nDavid Wilson, of Martinsville.\r\n\r\nSeventh Division, Col. W. R. McClellen, of Danville. Chief of Staff,\r\nCapt. W. H. Armstrong, of Terre Haute.\r\n\r\nEighth Division, Capt. T. H. B. McCain, of Crawfordsville. Chief of\r\nStaff, Edward Watson, of Brazil.\r\n\r\nNinth Division, Capt. J. O. Pedigo, of Lebanon. Chief of Staff, C. C.\r\nShirley, of Kokomo.\r\n\r\nMr. Blaine visited the Exposition grounds in the afternoon, where Major\r\nW. H. Calkins introduced him to an audience of about 30,000, to whom he\r\naddressed a few words. At night Mr. Blaine delivered one of his masterly\r\nspeeches at Tomlinson Hall to an audience of 6,000. At the close of the\r\nBlaine meeting General Harrison received a delegation from Cincinnati,\r\nconsisting of A. B. Horton, H. D. Emerson, Wm. Fredberger, James A.\r\nGraff, H. R. Probasco, Dr. M. T. Carey, Abram Myer, Fred Pryor, and\r\nWalter Hartpense, who called to invite him to attend the Cincinnati\r\nExposition on \"Republican Day.\" A St. Louis delegation, members of the\r\nLoyal Legion, also paid their respects. Among them were Col. R. C.\r\nKerens, Col. Nelson Cole, Col. J. S. Butler, Major W. R. Hodges, Captain\r\nGleason, G. B. Adams, H. L. Morrill, C. H. Sampson, and W. B. Gates.\r\n\r\nOn October 18 a party of distinguished railroad magnates visited General\r\nHarrison. They were Hon. Chauncey M. Depew, J. D. Layng, H. W. Webb,\r\nSam'l Barton, Seward C. Webb, and C. F. Cox, of New York; J. De Koven,\r\nof Chicago; S. M. Beach, of Cleveland, and J. Q. Van Winkle, of St.\r\nLouis.\r\n\r\nOn October 19 General Harrison received informally 150 survivors of\r\nthe Eleventh Indiana Regiment, headed by their first colonel, Gen. Lew\r\nWallace, and General McGinnis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo large and influential organizations visited General Harrison\r\non October 13. From Milwaukee came 400 members of the Young Men's\r\nRepublican Club--Paul D. Carpenter, President; George Russell,\r\nSecretary. Among other prominent members were Samuel Chandler,\r\nwho organized the pilgrimage, and Walter W. Pollock. President\r\nCarpenter--son of the late Senator Matt Carpenter--and C. S. Otjen, a\r\nwage-worker, were spokesmen for the club.\r\n\r\nThe second and largest delegation was the Chicago German-American\r\nRepublican Club--Franz Amberg, President; F. J. Buswick, Secretary.\r\nAccompanying them was the Excelsior Band and sixteen voices from the\r\nOrpheus Maennerchor Society of Chicago. Among the widely known members\r\nwith the club were Hon. Chris. Mamer, Louis Huck, Peter Hand, Edward\r\nBert, Peter Mahr, Henry Wulf, City Treasurer Plantz, N. F. Plotke, and\r\nAlderman Tiedemann. As General Harrison entered the hall the reception\r\nexercises were opened by the Maennerchor Society with the inspiring\r\nhymn--\"This is the Lord's own day.\" Addresses on behalf of the visitors\r\nwere made by Hon. Wm. Vocke, Henry Greenbaum, and Andrew Soehngen; also,\r\nGeneral Fred Knefler for the German Republicans of Indiana, and Hon A.\r\nB. Ward, of Dakota.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, responding to both visiting delegations, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends of the German-American Republican Club of Chicago, and\r\n  of the Club of Milwaukee, and my Home German Friends_--I am very\r\n  grateful for the kind words you have addressed to me. The long journey\r\n  most of you have taken upon this inclement day to tender your respects\r\n  to me as the candidate of the Republican party is very convincing\r\n  evidence that you believe this civil contest to be no mock tournament,\r\n  but a very real and a very decisive battle for great principles.\r\n  [Cheers]. My German-American friends, you are a home-loving people;\r\n  father, mother, wife, child are words that to you have a very full\r\n  and a very tender meaning. [Cheers.] The old father and mother never\r\n  outlive the veneration and love of the children in a German household.\r\n  [Cheers.] You have come from the fatherland in families, and have set\r\n  up again here the old hearth-stones. Out of this love of home there\r\n  is naturally born a love of country--it is only the widening of the\r\n  family circle--and so our fellow-citizens of German birth and descent\r\n  did not fail to respond with alacrity and enthusiasm to the call of\r\n  their adopted country when armies were mustered for the defence of the\r\n  Union. [Cheers.] The people of Indiana will long remember the veteran\r\n  Willich and the Thirty-second Regiment of Indiana Volunteers (or First\r\n  German), which he took into the field in 1861. The repulse by this\r\n  regiment alone of an attacking force under General Hindman of 1,100\r\n  infantry, a battalion of Texas Rangers, and four pieces of artillery\r\n  at Rowlett's Station, in December, 1861, filled our people with\r\n  enthusiasm and pride. Again and again the impetuous Texas horsemen\r\n  threw themselves with baffled fury upon that square of brave hearts.\r\n  No bayonet point was lowered, no skulker broke the wall of safety that\r\n  enclosed the flag. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Your people are industrious, thrifty, and provident. To lay by\r\n  something is one of life's earliest lessons in a German home. These\r\n  national traits naturally drew your people to the support of the\r\n  Republican party when it declared for freedom and free homes in the\r\n  Territories. [Cheers.] They secured your adherence to the cause of the\r\n  Union in the Civil War. They gave us your help in the long struggle\r\n  for resumption and an honest currency, and I do not doubt that they\r\n  will now secure our sympathy and help in this great contest in behalf\r\n  of our American homes. Your people are largely wage-earners. They have\r\n  prospered under a protective tariff, and will not, I am sure, vote for\r\n  such a change in our tariff policy as will cut them off from their\r\n  wages that margin which they are now able to lay aside for old age and\r\n  for their children.\r\n\r\n  And now a word to my young friends from Wisconsin. You have come\r\n  into the possession of the suffrage at an important, if not critical,\r\n  time in our public affairs. The Democratic party out of power was a\r\n  party of negations. It did not secure its present lease of power upon\r\n  the platform or the policies it now supports and advocates. [Cheers.]\r\n  The campaign of 1884 was not made upon the platform of a tariff for\r\n  revenue only. Our workingmen were soothed with phrases that implied\r\n  some regard to their interests, and Democrats who believed in a\r\n  protective tariff were admitted to the party councils and gladly heard\r\n  in public debate. [Cheers.] But four years of power have changed all\r\n  this. Democrats who thought they could be protectionists and still\r\n  maintain their party standing have been silenced or their opinions\r\n  coerced. The issue is now distinctly made between \"protection and\r\n  something that is not protection.\" [Cheers.] The Republican party\r\n  fearlessly accepts the issue and places itself upon the side of the\r\n  American home and the American workingman. [Cheers.] We invite these\r\n  young men who were too young to share the glory of the struggle for\r\n  our political unity to a part in this contest for the preservation of\r\n  our commercial independence. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now to these friends who are the bearers of gifts, one word of\r\n  thanks. I especially value this cane as a token of the confidence and\r\n  respect of the workingmen of Bay View. [Cheers.] I accept their gift\r\n  with gratitude, and would wish you, sir, to bear in return my most\r\n  friendly regards and good wishes to every one of them. I do not need\r\n  to lean on this beautiful cane, but I do feel like resting upon the\r\n  intelligent confidence of the men who sent it. [Great cheering.] I am\r\n  glad to know that they have not stumbled over the simple problem that\r\n  is presented for their consideration in this campaign. They know that\r\n  an increase of importation means diminished work in American shops.\r\n  [Cheers.] To my friend who brings this beautiful specimen of American\r\n  workmanship, this commonly accepted token of good luck, I give my\r\n  thanks. But we will not trust wholly in this symbol of good luck. The\r\n  earnest individual effort of the American people only can make the\r\n  result of this contest so decisive, so emphatic, that we shall not for\r\n  a generation hear any party contest the principle that our tariff laws\r\n  shall adequately protect our own workingmen. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nOhio's chief executive, Gov. Joseph B. Foraker, escorted by the Garfield\r\nClub and the Fourteenth Regiment Band of Columbus, made a pilgrimage to\r\nthe Republican Mecca on October 17. The widely known Columbus Glee Club\r\naccompanied them. Among the prominent Republicans with the delegation\r\nwere Auditor of State Poe, Adjutant-General Axline, Hon. Estes G.\r\nRathbone, C. L. Kurtz, D. W. Brown, C. E. Prior, L. D. Hogerty, J. W.\r\nFirestone, and Ira H. Crum. Escorted by the Columbia Club, the Buckeyes\r\nmarched to the residence of General Harrison and were introduced by\r\nGovernor Foraker.\r\n\r\nIn response to their greeting General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--It was very appropriate that these representative\r\n  Ohio Republicans should accompany to the State of Indiana your\r\n  distinguished Governor, whose presence among us to-day is so welcome\r\n  to our people. We know his story as the young Ohio volunteer, the\r\n  fearless champion of Republican principles in public debate, and the\r\n  resolute, courageous, and sagacious executive of the great State of\r\n  Ohio. [Applause.] We welcome him and we welcome you. The fame of\r\n  this magnificent glee club has preceded them. We are glad to have an\r\n  opportunity to hear you.\r\n\r\n  To these members of the Garfield Club I return my thanks for this\r\n  friendly call. You bear an honored name. I look back with pleasure to\r\n  the small contribution I was able to make in Indiana toward securing\r\n  the electoral vote of this State to that great son of Ohio, whose\r\n  tragic death spread gloom and disappointment over our land. I welcome\r\n  you as citizens of my native State--a State I shall always love,\r\n  because all of my early associations are with it. In this State, to\r\n  which I came in my earliest manhood, the Republicans are as staunch\r\n  and true, as valorous and resolute, as can be found in any of the\r\n  States. You have no advantage of us except in numbers. We welcome\r\n  you all as Republicans. [A voice, \"That's what we are!\"] We believe\r\n  that our party now advocates another great principle that needs to be\r\n  established--made fast--put where it shall be beyond assault. It is\r\n  a principle which has wrought marvellously in the development of our\r\n  country since the war. It has enabled us to handle a great national\r\n  debt, which our desponding Democratic friends said would inevitably\r\n  sink our country into bankruptcy, so that we are not troubled about\r\n  getting the money to pay our maturing bonds, but are getting it\r\n  faster than our bonds mature. We need to establish this principle of\r\n  protection, the defence of our American workers against the degrading\r\n  and unfriendly competition of pauper labor in all other countries\r\n  [cheers], so unmistakably that it shall not again be assailed. [A\r\n  voice, \"Amen!\"] Our Democratic friends in previous campaigns have\r\n  deceived the people upon this great question by uncertain and evasive\r\n  utterances. We are glad to know that now they have drawn the issue\r\n  clearly; we accept it. [Applause.] If we shall be able in this\r\n  campaign, as I believe we will, to arouse our people to the importance\r\n  of maintaining our defences against unfair foreign competition,\r\n  we shall administer those who believe in revenue tariffs and in\r\n  progressive free trade a wholesome lesson--one that will last them a\r\n  lifetime. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I had resolutely determined when I came upon these steps not to make\r\n  a speech. [Laughter and cries of \"Go on!\"] I am absolutely determined\r\n  to stop now. [Laughter.] I shall be glad to meet the members of these\r\n  escort clubs personally in my house. [Three cheers.]\r\n\r\nLater in the day about 100 survivors of the Seventy-ninth Indiana\r\nRegiment, led by their first colonel, General Fred Knefler, called on\r\nGeneral Harrison, and were presented by their leader in a brief speech,\r\nin response to which General Harrison, speaking from his doorway, said:\r\n\r\n  _General Knefler and Comrades_--I am always deeply touched when\r\n  my comrades visit me and offer their kindly greetings. I have no\r\n  higher ambition than to stand well in the estimation of my comrades\r\n  of the old Union army. I will not speak of any political topic. These\r\n  men who stand before me gave the supreme evidence of their love and\r\n  devotion to their country. No man could give more than they offered.\r\n  The perpetuity of our institutions, the honor of what General Sherman\r\n  so felicitously called the \"old glory,\" demand the country shall\r\n  always and in every appropriate way honor and reward the men who kept\r\n  it a Nation. Whatever may be said of our great prosperity since the\r\n  war, and it can scarcely be exaggerated, if we look for the cause\r\n  under God, is it not found in the stout hearts of these men? They\r\n  have opened this wide avenue of prosperity and honor in which we are\r\n  moving. It will be a shame if our people do not in every way properly\r\n  recognize that debt and properly honor the men who gave this supreme\r\n  evidence of their devotion to the country and its institutions.\r\n  Thanking you again for this visit, I will be glad if you will enter my\r\n  house and let me meet you personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the fifth time during the campaign the commercial travellers visited\r\nGeneral Harrison, each time with increased numbers. On Saturday,\r\nOctober 20, under the supervision of the Commercial Travellers'\r\nRepublican Club of Indianapolis--G. C. Webster, President; Ernest\r\nMorris, Secretary--they held one of the largest and most successful\r\ndemonstrations of this remarkable campaign. Their gathering partook\r\nof a national character, as large numbers of \"drummers\" were present\r\nfrom Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, West Virginia, and Vermont, while every important\r\ncity in Indiana sent its complement.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were received by a local committee of travelling men,\r\nconsisting of Fred Schmidt, Chairman; C. McPherson, Wm. Faucet, Joseph\r\nStubbs, Jeff Cook, Ed. Allcott, J. C. Norris, M. P. Green, Geo. White,\r\nO. W. Morman, Chas. D. Pearson, Jeff Taylor, Wm. P. Bone, Henry Ramey,\r\nAlbert A. Womack, John A. Wright, James W. Muir, and Frank Brough. It\r\nwas estimated that 40,000 spectators witnessed their fine parade, a\r\nconspicuous feature of which was a big bull covered with a white cloth\r\non which was printed the words--\"John Bull rides the Democratic party\r\nand we ride John Bull.\" On his back rode \"Drummer\" Dan'l B. Long in an\r\nemerald suit, while L. A. Worch, dressed as Uncle Sam, led the bovine.\r\nThe parade was in charge of Chief Marshal J. R. Ross and his aids. As\r\nthe column passed their residence it was reviewed by General and Mrs.\r\nHarrison. Later in the day the visitors were received at Tomlinson Hall.\r\nWhen General Harrison appeared a great demonstration occurred. President\r\nWebster presided; the speakers were: John E. Dowell, of Boston; R. T.\r\nDow, of Atlanta; C. L. Young and John L. Fennimore, of Columbus, Ohio;\r\nChas. P. Banks, of Brooklyn; John L. Griffiths and John C. Wingate, of\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--Four times already, I believe, the commercial\r\n  travellers have honored me by calling upon me in large delegations.\r\n  You have assembled to-day, not from a single State or locality, but\r\n  from many States, upon the invitation of your associates of this\r\n  city, to show your intelligent interest in the principles that are\r\n  involved in this campaign. [Cheers.] I do not need to repeat what I\r\n  have said on former occasions, that I very highly value the respect\r\n  and confidence of the commercial travellers of the United States.\r\n  [Cheers.] I value it because I believe they give their adherence to\r\n  the party whose candidate I am upon an intelligent investigation and\r\n  upon an earnest conviction as to what is good for the country of which\r\n  they are citizens. [Cheers.] Who should be able, better than you, to\r\n  know the commercial and business needs of our country? You, whose hand\r\n  is every day upon the business pulse of the people; you, who travel\r\n  the country up and down upon all the swift highways of commerce, and\r\n  who are brought in contact with the business men of the country, not\r\n  only in our great centres of commerce, but in all the hamlets of the\r\n  land. I believe I may say for you that, as a result of this personal\r\n  knowledge of our business needs, you have concluded that the policy\r\n  for America is the policy of a protective tariff. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  There are doubtless here many representatives of great American\r\n  manufacturing establishments; and who should know better than they the\r\n  prostrating effects upon the industries they represent of this policy\r\n  of a revenue tariff, or the not much differing policy of free trade?\r\n  [Cheers.] Who should know better than you that if the discriminating\r\n  duties now levied, which enable our American manufacturers to maintain\r\n  a fair competition with the manufacturers of other countries, and at\r\n  the same time to pay a scale of living wages to the men and women who\r\n  work for them, is once broken down, American competition with foreign\r\n  production becomes impossible, except by the reduction of the scale\r\n  of American wages to the level of the wages paid abroad? [Cheers.]\r\n  Certainly you do not need to be told that that shop or mill that\r\n  has the smallest pay-roll in proportion to its production will take\r\n  the market. [Cheers.] Certainly you do not need to be told that the\r\n  wages now enjoyed by our American workmen are greatly larger and the\r\n  comforts they enjoy greatly more than those enjoyed by the working\r\n  people of any other land. [Cheers.] Certainly you do not need to be\r\n  told that if the American Government, instead of patronizing home\r\n  industries, buys its blankets for the public service in England there\r\n  is just that much less work for American workmen to do. [Cheers.] This\r\n  is to me the beginning and the end of the tariff question. Since I\r\n  was old enough to have opinions or to utter them, I have held to the\r\n  doctrine that the true American policy was that which should maintain\r\n  not only a living rate of wages, but one with a margin for savings and\r\n  comfort for our workmen. I believe that policy is essential to the\r\n  prosperity and possibly to the perpetuity of our Government. [Cheers.]\r\n  The two propositions that now stare our working people--and our whole\r\n  country--in the face are these: competition with foreign countries,\r\n  without adequate discriminating and favoring duties, means lower wages\r\n  to our working people; a revenue-only tariff, or progressive free\r\n  trade, means larger importations of foreign goods, and that means less\r\n  work in America. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Let our Democratic friends fairly meet these two indisputable\r\n  conclusions. How do they do it? [Cries, \"They don't; they can't!\"]\r\n  By endeavoring to prevent and poison the minds of our working people\r\n  by utterly false and scandalous campaign stories. [Enthusiastic\r\n  cheering.] Let me say in conclusion that I believe the managers of\r\n  the Democratic campaign greatly underestimate the intelligence,\r\n  the sense of decency, and the love of fair play that prevail among\r\n  out people. [Great cheering.] You will pardon further remark. The\r\n  evening is drawing on, and many of you, I am sure, have been made\r\n  uncomfortable by your muddy walk through the streets of our city. I\r\n  cannot omit, however, to thank my friends from Lafayette for this\r\n  beautiful floral tribute which they have placed at my side--an emblem\r\n  of their profession. [Floral gripsack.] I accept it gratefully, and\r\n  very highly appreciate it as a mark of the confidence and respect of\r\n  the intelligent body of my own fellow-citizens of Indiana. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree thousand enthusiastic citizens of Springfield, Clarke County,\r\nOhio, paid their respects to the Republican nominee on this date, under\r\nthe auspices of the Republican White Hat Brigade, Gen. A. S. Bushnell,\r\nCommander; E. T. Thomes, Vice-Commander; S. J. Wilkerson, Chief of\r\nStaff; J. W. R. Cline, Sam'l Hoffman, and J. H. Arbogast, Aids. The\r\nbrigade, comprising 2,300 voters, each wearing a white beaver hat, was\r\ndivided into three regiments and accompanied by six excellent bands.\r\n\r\nThe First Regiment was commanded by Col. J. A. Dickus, Lieut.-Col.\r\nGeo. Lentz, Major Henry Harper. Second Regiment--Col. Wm. F. Bakhaus,\r\nLieut.-Col. Darwin Pierce, Major Wm. Robinson. Third Regiment--Col.\r\nH. N. Taylor, Lieut.-Col. Henry Hains, Major P. M. Hawk. When General\r\nHarrison entered the hall every Buckeye stood on his chair and\r\nfrantically waved his high hat in one hand and a flag in the other.\r\nGeneral Bushnell made the presentation address, to which General\r\nHarrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _General Bushnell and my Ohio Friends_--The people of Clarke\r\n  County owed me a visit. I recall, with great pleasure, two occasions\r\n  when I visited your prosperous county and the rich and busy city\r\n  of Springfield to speak in behalf of the Republican party and its\r\n  candidates. I recall with pleasure the cordiality with which I was\r\n  received by your people. [Applause.] I noted then the intelligent\r\n  interest manifested by the masses of your people in public questions,\r\n  and the enthusiasm with which you rallied to the defense of Republican\r\n  principles. [Cheers.] We are glad to welcome you to Indiana, but\r\n  regret that this inclement day and our muddy streets have thrown\r\n  about your visit so many incidents of discomfort. I hope that you\r\n  will not allow these incidents to give you an unfavorable impression\r\n  of the beautiful capital city of Indiana. [Cheers and cries of \"We\r\n  won't!\"] Our people are glad to have this added evidence of the\r\n  interest which the people of your State take in the question which\r\n  the issue of this campaign will settle. I say settle, because I\r\n  believe that the question of the life of protective tariff system is\r\n  now very distinctly presented. The enemies of the system have left\r\n  their ambuscades and taken to the open field, and we are to have a\r\n  decisive battle over this question. [Great cheers.] I believe that\r\n  never before, in any campaign, has this question been so fully and\r\n  ably discussed in the hearing of our people. [Cheers.] There can\r\n  be found nowhere in this country a better illustration of what a\r\n  great manufacturing centre will do for the farmer in enhancing the\r\n  value of his farm and in furnishing a home market for his products\r\n  than the city of Springfield. [Cheers.] Your city and county--your\r\n  merchants and farmers--are prosperous, because you have a great body\r\n  of well-paid wage-earners in your great shops and factories. [Cheers.]\r\n  It is the policy of the Republican party to multiply, all through our\r\n  agricultural regions, such centres of manufacturing industries as\r\n  Springfield. [Cheers.] It is conceded that to all our working people,\r\n  all those who earn their subsistence by toil, this campaign involves\r\n  most important interests. I will not pursue in its details this\r\n  question. You have heard it discussed, and most of you, perhaps all,\r\n  have made up your conclusions. It is of such importance as, wholly\r\n  without respect to the candidate who may by chance represent it, to\r\n  be worthy of the intelligent and earnest thought and vigorous effort\r\n  of every American citizen. [Cheers.] Let me now only thank you for\r\n  this most remarkable evidence of the interest of your people. We have\r\n  rarely, if it all, seen here, in this long procession of delegations,\r\n  one that equalled that which I see before me now. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of General Harrison's speech General Bushnell\r\npresented him with a highly polished horse-shoe, manufactured from\r\nAmerican steel by S. B. Thomas, formerly an Englishman. Repeated calls\r\nfor Mr. Thomas brought that gentleman out, and there was another\r\nprolonged demonstration as General Harrison cordially clasped his hand\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n  I accept with pleasure this product of the skill and industry of\r\n  one who, out of his own experience, can speak of the benefits of a\r\n  protective tariff. One who sought our land because it offered better\r\n  wages and better hopes [cheers], and who in his life here has been\r\n  able to contrast the condition of working people in England and in\r\n  America. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign in Indiana several prominent labor representatives\r\nfrom the East canvassed the State in advocacy of a protective tariff\r\nand the Republican ticket. Chief among these speakers were Charles H.\r\nLitchman, of Massachusetts, ex-Secretary-General of the Knights of\r\nLabor; John J. Jarrett, Hon. Henry Hall, Eccles Robinson, and Robert\r\nD. Layton, of Pennsylvania, and Jeremiah Murphy, of New York. These\r\ngentlemen, assisted by John R. Rankin, Marshall C. Woods, and other\r\nprominent Indiana labor leaders, signalized the conclusion of their\r\ncampaign work by a notable workingmen's demonstration on October 25.\r\nAbout 10,000 voters from over the State participated in the parade, led\r\nby Chief Marshal John R. Rankin, assisted by C. A. Rodney, George E.\r\nClarke, Wm. R. Mounts, John Baker, Fred Andler, Wm. H. Baughmier, Geo.\r\nE. Perry, Lewis Rathbaust, J. N. Loop, Wm. Cook, Gustave Schneider, John\r\nW. Browning, A. Raphel, and Michael Bamberger.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, with Hon. William McKinley, Jr., of Ohio, Senator John\r\nC. Spooner, of Wisconsin, and Senator Henry W. Blair, of New Hampshire,\r\nreviewed the column and later attended a great meeting at Tomlinson\r\nHall. Many ladies occupied seats on the stage, among them Mrs. Harrison.\r\nWhen General Harrison appeared, escorted by Secretary Litchman, the vast\r\naudience arose and cheered frantically for full five minutes.\r\n\r\nL. W. McDaniels, a prominent member of the Typographical Union,\r\npresided, and in his address among other things said:\r\n\r\n  We are here to repudiate the authority claimed by a few professional\r\n  men to speak for the wage-workers of Indiana, to deny the truthfulness\r\n  of their statements, and to contradict the assertion that there is\r\n  other than the kindliest feeling among the workingmen of Indiana\r\n  toward General Harrison. While General Harrison has never acted the\r\n  blatant demagogue by making loud professions, yet we have had evidence\r\n  of his earnest sympathy and sincere friendship on more than one\r\n  occasion, notably his advocacy while in the Senate of the bill making\r\n  arbitration the means of settlement of labor troubles and excluding\r\n  contract labor from our shores. Also the bill prohibiting the use of\r\n  convict labor on Government works, or the purchasing by the Government\r\n  of any of the products of convict labor.\r\n\r\nAs General Harrison arose to respond there was another prolonged\r\noutbreak; he appeared greatly moved, and delivered probably his most\r\nearnest speech of the campaign. The demonstrations of approval were very\r\nmarked, especially as the General warmed up to his denials of matters\r\nsuggested by Chairman McDaniels' remarks. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. McDaniels and my Friends_--I have seen, during this\r\n  busy summer, many earnest and demonstrative assemblages of my\r\n  fellow-citizens. I have listened to many addresses full of the kindest\r\n  expressions toward me personally; but, among them all, none have been\r\n  more grateful to me, none have more deeply touched me than this great\r\n  assemblage of the workingmen of Indiana and these kind words which\r\n  have been addressed to me in your behalf. [Great cheering.] There\r\n  are reasons why this should be so that will readily occur to your\r\n  minds, and to some of which Mr. McDaniels has alluded. Early in this\r\n  campaign certain people, claiming to speak for the laboring men, but\r\n  really in the employ of the Democratic campaign managers, promulgated\r\n  through the newspaper press and by campaign publications that were not\r\n  given the open endorsement of the Democratic campaign managers, but\r\n  were paid for by their funds and circulated under their auspices, a\r\n  number of false and scandalous stories relating to my attitude toward\r\n  organized labor. [Great and prolonged cheering.] The purpose of all\r\n  these stories was to poison the minds of the workingmen against the\r\n  candidate of the party that stands in this campaign for the principle\r\n  of protection to American labor. [Great cheering.] I have only once,\r\n  in all the addresses I have made to my fellow-citizens, alluded to\r\n  these malicious and scandalous stories, but, now and in the presence\r\n  of this great gathering of workingmen, I do pronounce them to be\r\n  utterly false. [Tumultuous cheering, waving of flags and banners,\r\n  continued for several minutes.] The story that I ever said that one\r\n  dollar a day was enough for a workingman, with all its accompaniments\r\n  and appendages, is not a perversion of anything I ever said--it is a\r\n  false creation. [Enthusiastic cheering.] I will not follow in detail\r\n  this long catalogue of campaign slanders, but will only add that it is\r\n  equally false that anywhere or at any time I ever spoke disparagingly\r\n  of my fellow-citizens of Irish nativity or descent. Many of them\r\n  are now enrolling themselves on the side of protection for American\r\n  labor--this created the necessity for the story. [Cheers.] I want\r\n  to say again that those who pitch a campaign upon so low a level\r\n  greatly underestimate the intelligence, the sense of decency, and\r\n  the love of fair play of the American people. [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n  I said to one of the first delegations that visited me that this was\r\n  a contest of great principles; that it would be fought out upon the\r\n  high plains of truth, and not in the swamps of slander and defamation.\r\n  [Great cheering.] Those who will encamp their army in the swamp will\r\n  abandon the victory to the army that is on the heights. [Cheers.]\r\n  The Republican party stands to-day as the bulwark and defense of the\r\n  wage-earners of this country against a competition which may reduce\r\n  American wages even below the standard they falsely impute to my\r\n  suggestion. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  There are two very plain facts that I have often stated--and others\r\n  more forcibly than I--that it seems to me should be conclusive with\r\n  the wage-earners of America. The policy of the Democratic party--the\r\n  revision of our tariff laws as indicated by the Democratic party,\r\n  a revenue-only tariff, or progressive free trade--means a vast and\r\n  sudden increase of importations. Is there a man here so dull as not to\r\n  know that this means diminished work in our American shops? [Cheers\r\n  and cries of \"No, no!\"] If some one says that labor is not fully\r\n  employed now, do you hope it will be more fully employed when you\r\n  have transferred one-third of the work done in our shops to foreign\r\n  workshops? [Cries of \"No, no!\"] If some one tells me that labor is not\r\n  sufficiently rewarded here, does he hope to have its rewards increased\r\n  by striking down our protective duties and compelling our workmen to\r\n  compete with the underpaid labor of Europe? [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I conclude by saying that less work and lower wages are the\r\n  inevitable result of the triumph of the principles advocated by the\r\n  Democratic party. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now you will excuse further speech from me. [Cries of \"Go\r\n  on!\"] There are here several distinguished advocates of Republican\r\n  principles. You will be permitted to hear now, I understand, from the\r\n  Hon. Henry W. Blair, a Senator from the State of New Hampshire, who\r\n  has been so long at the head of the Committee on Education and Labor\r\n  in the United States Senate; and to-night in this hall you will be\r\n  permitted to listen to the Hon. William McKinley, Jr., of Ohio. Now\r\n  will you allow me again to thank you out of a full heart for this\r\n  cordial tender of your confidence and respect. I felt that in return I\r\n  could not omit to say what I have said, not because you needed to be\r\n  assured of my friendliness, but in recognition of a confidence that\r\n  falsehood and slander could not shake. I have not thought it in good\r\n  taste to make many personal references in my public addresses. If any\r\n  one thinks it necessary that a comparison should be instituted between\r\n  the candidates of the two great parties as to their friendliness to\r\n  the reforms demanded by organized labor, I must leave others to make\r\n  it. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, OCTOBER 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railroad men of Indiana held their last gathering of the great\r\ncampaign on Saturday night, October 27. Its estimated 7,000 voters\r\nparticipated in their parade under Chief Marshal A. D. Shaw and\r\nChief of Staff Geo. Butler. The Porter Flambeau Club, the Harrison\r\nZouaves, and 1,000 members of the Indianapolis Railroad Club--each\r\nman carrying a colored lantern--escorted the visiting organizations.\r\nGeneral Harrison and the Hon. W. R. McKeen, of Terre Haute, reviewed\r\nthe brilliant procession from the balcony of the New-Denison and then\r\nrepaired to Tomlinson Hall, where the General's arrival was signalized\r\nby an extraordinary demonstration. Chairman Finch introduced Hon.\r\nMathew O'Doherty, of Louisville, and A. F. Potts, of Indianapolis, who\r\naddressed the meeting later in the evening.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison was the first speaker. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends of the Railroad Republican Clubs_--Before your committee\r\n  waited upon me to request my presence here to-night I had resolutely\r\n  determined that I would not make another address in this campaign. But\r\n  when they presented their suggestion that I should meet my railroad\r\n  friends, I said to them--the kindness which has been shown to me from\r\n  an early period in this campaign by the railroad men of Indiana has\r\n  been so conspicuous and so cordial that I could not deny any request\r\n  that is presented in their name. [Cheers.] And so I am here to-night,\r\n  not to speak upon any political topic, but only to express, if I\r\n  can find words to express, the deep and earnest thankfulness I feel\r\n  toward you who have shown so much kindness and confidence in me.\r\n  [Cheers.] Very early in this campaign there were those who sought to\r\n  make a breach between you and me. You did not wait for my answer, but\r\n  you made answer yourselves. [Cheers.] And time and again you have\r\n  witnessed your faith that my disposition toward you and toward the men\r\n  who toil for their living was one of friendliness, and the principles\r\n  which I represented and have always advocated were those that promoted\r\n  the true interests of the workingmen of America. [Cheers.] I have\r\n  always believed and held that the prosperity of our country, that the\r\n  supremacy of its institutions and its social order all depended upon\r\n  our pursuing such a policy in our legislation that we should have in\r\n  America a class of workingmen earning adequate wages that would bring\r\n  comfort into their homes and maintain hope in their hearts. [Cheers.]\r\n  A despairing man, a man out of whose horizon the star of hope has\r\n  gone, is not a safe citizen in a republic. [Cheers.] Therefore I would\r\n  preserve against unfriendly competition the highest possible scale of\r\n  wages to our working people. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I know the stout hearts, I know the intelligence, I know the\r\n  enterprise of those men who man our railway trains and push them at\r\n  lightning speed through darkness and storm. I know the skill and\r\n  faithfulness of those who sit at the telegraph instrument, holding\r\n  in their watchfulness the safety of those who journey. I know the\r\n  fidelity of the men who conduct this business, which has grown to\r\n  be a system as fine and perfect as the finest product of mechanical\r\n  art. [Cheers.] And so I value to-night this evidence of your cordial\r\n  respect; and let me say that whatever may happen to me in the future,\r\n  whether I shall remain a citizen of Indianapolis to bear with you\r\n  the duties and responsibilities of private citizenship, or shall be\r\n  honored with office, I shall never forget this great demonstration of\r\n  your friendliness. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's unequalled campaign of speech-making closed on the\r\nafternoon of this day with a visit from 80 young lady students of\r\nOxford, Ohio, College. They were organized as the \"Carrie Harrison Club\r\nof Oxford,\" and their visit was in honor of that distinguished lady,\r\nwho, 36 years before, as Miss Carrie Scott, graduated from this same\r\ninstitution, of which her venerable father, the Rev. Dr. John W. Scott,\r\nwas the first President. The students were accompanied by President and\r\nMrs. Faye Walker and Professors Wilson, Fisher, and Dean.\r\n\r\nMiss Nellie F. Deem, of Union City, Indiana, the youngest teacher in\r\nthe college, addressed Mrs. Harrison on behalf of the school. General\r\nHarrison responded briefly in a happy little speech, in which he\r\nexpressed the pleasure felt by both over the visit of the Oxford young\r\nladies. He spoke of their mutual memories of the school and the happy\r\ndays spent in its charming surroundings, and said they both rejoiced\r\nin the prosperity of the college, noted as it was for its scholarship\r\nand the Christian training of its pupils. In conclusion he thanked them\r\nfor their visit, and assured them that the kind words spoken of Mrs.\r\nHarrison and himself were fully appreciated and would be long remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, NOVEMBER 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last day of the great campaign brought a delegation of nearly 100\r\nladies and gentlemen from Terre Haute, Indiana, who came to deliver a\r\nhandsome present of a miniature silver-mounted plush chair, designated\r\nthe \"Presidential Chair.\" They also brought Mrs. Harrison a valuable\r\nflower-stand, voted to her at Germania Fair as the most popular lady. In\r\nreturning thanks for these gifts and their visit General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Captain Ebel and Gentlemen_--I am very much obliged to you for this\r\n  friendly visit. It comes in the nature of a surprise, for it was only\r\n  a little while ago that I was advised of your intention. I thank you\r\n  for this gift. It is intended, I suppose, as a type, and a type of a\r\n  very useful article, one that does not come amiss in any station of\r\n  life. Only those who for months found their only convenient seat upon\r\n  a log or a cracker-box know what infinite luxury there was in even a\r\n  common Windsor chair. We are glad to welcome you to our home, and will\r\n  be glad to greet personally the members of this club and those ladies\r\n  who accompany you.\r\n\r\nThe General then, in behalf of Mrs. Harrison, thanked the ladies for\r\ntheir present to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTION, NOVEMBER, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this work to more than chronicle the result\r\nof the great presidential campaign of 1888. The election fell on\r\nNovember 6. Twenty States gave the Republican candidate 233 votes in the\r\nElectoral College, and 18 States cast 168 votes for Mr. Cleveland, the\r\nDemocratic candidate. The total vote cast in the 38 States, for the 7\r\nelectoral tickets, was 11,386,632, of which General Harrison received\r\n5,440,551. The Republican electoral ticket was chosen in Indiana by a\r\nplurality of 2,392 votes.\r\n\r\nWhen it became evident that General Harrison had won the election a\r\ndemonstration without parallel was inaugurated at Indianapolis and\r\ncontinued three days. The exciting street parades and gatherings\r\nwitnessed at the time of his nomination were re-enacted with tenfold\r\nenergy and enthusiasm. Delegations came from all points in the State\r\nto offer their congratulations, and 10,000 telegrams and letters from\r\ndistinguished countrymen poured in upon the successful candidate. From\r\nan early hour on the morning of the 7th, for days thereafter, the\r\nstreets of Indianapolis were thronged with enthusiastic visitors.\r\n\r\nThe first delegation to call upon General Harrison after his election\r\ncame from Hendricks County, numbering 400 veterans and others, headed\r\nby Ira J. Chase, the newly elected Lieutenant-Governor, Rev. J. H.\r\nHull, and John C. Ochiltree. General Harrison made no formal response\r\nto their congratulatory address. On November 9 a delegation from the\r\nCommercial Club of Cincinnati arrived, and at night the saw-makers of\r\nIndianapolis--about 100 in number--bedecked in red from head to foot,\r\nmarched with glaring torches to the residence of General Harrison, and\r\nafter a serenade called upon him for a speech.\r\n\r\nComing out on the steps the General said:\r\n\r\n  The time for speech-making is over. The debate is closed, and I\r\n  believe the polls are closed. [\"Right you are!\"] I will only thank\r\n  you for your call to-night and for that friendly spirit which you have\r\n  shown to me during the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Famous Telegram._\r\n\r\nThe State of New York gave Harrison (Rep.) over Cleveland (Dem.) a\r\nplurality of 13,074 votes; but for Governor--at the same election--the\r\nState gave David B. Hill (Dem.) a plurality of 19,171 over Warner\r\nMiller (Rep.). These opposite results called forth the following famous\r\ntelegram from the President-elect:\r\n\r\n                                          INDIANAPOLIS, IND., Nov. 9, 1888.\r\n  _To_ HON. WARNER MILLER, _Herkimer, N. Y._:\r\n\r\n  I am greatly grieved at your defeat. If the intrepid leader fell\r\n  outside the breastworks, the column, inspired by his courage, went on\r\n  to victory.\r\n\r\n                                                  BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, JANUARY 1, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe installation of officers by George H. Thomas Post, G. A. R., on the\r\nnight of New Year's Day, '89, was attended by General Harrison, who for\r\nmany years had been an active member of this post. Many comrades from\r\nother posts in the city were present. The President-elect was escorted\r\nby Col. Irvin Robbins, who was commander of the Democratic regiment\r\nduring the recent campaign, and Col. George W. Spahr, who commanded a\r\nRepublican regiment. He was received with full honors by the retiring\r\ncommander, James B. Black, who presented him to the post.\r\n\r\nIn response to their enthusiastic greeting, General Harrison--speaking\r\nin public for the first time since his election--in substance said:\r\n\r\n  _Commander and Comrades_--It affords me pleasure to meet with you\r\n  again on this occasion. When I left the army so many years ago I\r\n  little expected to enter it again, as I soon will. Among the many\r\n  honors which may be placed on me in the future there will be none, I\r\n  can assure you, that I will esteem more highly than my membership in\r\n  this order, instituted by those who sustained the flag of Washington,\r\n  the flag of Perry, the flag that was baptized in the blood of the\r\n  Revolution and again in the second conflict with the mother country;\r\n  that floated over the halls of the Montezumas, and was sustained\r\n  in other wars, and which you made possible to wave over every foot\r\n  of our beloved country. I esteem it my greatest honor that I bore\r\n  even an humble part with you and all the comrades of the Grand Army\r\n  in bringing about this most desirable result. I wish to say before\r\n  parting with you, if I may never look upon your faces collectively\r\n  again, that the parting request I would make of you would be that each\r\n  of you, without regard to party (and I believe I can say this without\r\n  offence to any comrade of the Grand Army), stand shoulder to shoulder,\r\n  as we did during the war, to preserve a free and honest ballot.\r\n  There is nothing, I can assure you, that will do more to preserve\r\n  and maintain our institutions than this. Our country, separated as\r\n  it is by the great watery waste, need have no fear of interference\r\n  by foreign countries with its institutions; nor do we desire in any\r\n  way to interfere with them. Nor, indeed, is there any fear of another\r\n  civil war. The only fear we should now have is a corruption or\r\n  suppression of the free ballot, and your utmost exertions should be to\r\n  prevent it.\r\n\r\nIn concluding, he called for the choicest blessings upon his comrades,\r\nsaying: \"To each one, God bless you and your families; God keep you and\r\nprotect you in your homes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, FEBRUARY 25, 1889.\r\n\r\n_The Departure for Washington._\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident-elect and Mrs. Harrison bade their friends and neighbors\r\ngood-by and left Indiana on February 25 for Washington. Governor\r\nHovey, Mayor Denny, and several thousand citizens escorted them from\r\ntheir residence to the railroad station. In the escort column were\r\n1,000 G. A. R. veterans from Geo. H. Thomas and other posts, commanded\r\nby H. C. Allen. Conspicuous in their ranks was that distinguished\r\nsoldier-diplomat, General Lew Wallace. The members of the Indiana\r\nLegislature saluted and joined the _cortége_ as it passed through\r\nPennsylvania Street.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's carriage was completely enclosed within a hollow\r\nsquare composed of 32 prominent citizens--a body-guard of honor. The\r\nentire population of the city turned out to witness the eventful\r\ndeparture, while numerous delegations were present from Danville,\r\nRichmond, Crawfordsville, Terre Haute, and other cities. A great throng\r\ngreeted the distinguished travellers at the Union Station. From the rear\r\nplatform of the special inaugural train Governor Hovey presented the\r\nPresident-elect amid tumultuous cheering.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison was greatly affected by the scene and the occasion.\r\nSpeaking with emotion he said:\r\n\r\n  _My Good Friends and Neighbors_--I cannot trust myself to put in\r\n  words what I feel at this time. Every kind thought that is in your\r\n  minds and every good wish that is in your hearts for me finds its\r\n  responsive wish and thought in my mind and heart for each of you. I\r\n  love this city. It has been my own cherished home. Twice before I have\r\n  left it to discharge public duties and returned to it with gladness,\r\n  as I hope to do again. It is a city on whose streets the pompous\r\n  displays of wealth are not seen. It is full of pleasant homes, and in\r\n  these homes there is an unusual store of contentment. The memory of\r\n  your favor and kindness will abide with me, and my strong desire to\r\n  hold your respect and confidence will strengthen me in the discharge\r\n  of my new and responsible duties. Let me say farewell to all my\r\n  Indiana friends. For the public honors that have come to me I am their\r\n  grateful debtor. They have made the debt so large that I can never\r\n  discharge it. There is a great sense of loneliness in the discharge of\r\n  high public duties. The moment of decision is one of isolation. But\r\n  there is One whose help comes even into the quiet chamber of judgment,\r\n  and to His wise and unfailing guidance will I look for direction and\r\n  safety. My family unite with me in grateful thanks for this cordial\r\n  good-by, and with me wish that these years of separation may be full\r\n  of peace and happiness for each of you. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIGHTSTOWN, INDIANA, FEBRUARY 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the inaugural train sped along it was greeted at every station by\r\nthousands of cheering spectators. The first stop was at Knightstown,\r\nwhere the Soldiers' Orphans' Home is located. In response to their calls\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I thank you for this cordial gathering and\r\n  demonstration. I can detain the train but a moment, and I only stopped\r\n  at the request of the Superintendent of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home,\r\n  so that the children might have an opportunity to see me and that I\r\n  might wish them the bright and prosperous future which the sacrifices\r\n  of their fathers won for them. I bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, INDIANA, FEBRUARY 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Richmond was reached at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, where\r\nseveral thousand people greeted the travellers. General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I have so long had my home among you that I cannot\r\n  but feel a sense of regret in leaving the soil of Indiana. I go with\r\n  a deep sense of inadequacy, but I am sure you will be patient with my\r\n  mistakes, and that you will all give me your help as citizens [cheers\r\n  and cries of \"We will!\"] in my efforts to promote the best interests\r\n  of our people and the honor of the Nation we love. I thank you for\r\n  this cordial greeting. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS, OHIO, FEBRUARY 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Piqua the President-elect and his party were welcomed by Ohio's chief\r\nexecutive, Gov. J. B. Foraker, and his wife; and, notwithstanding the\r\nhour, some 20,000 people greeted their arrival at Columbus. The roar of\r\ncannon rendered speaking difficult. Governor Foraker presented General\r\nHarrison, who here made his last public speech before being inaugurated\r\nas President. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I thank you for the wonderful demonstration\r\n  of this evening. In these evidences of the good will of my friends\r\n  I receive a new stimulus as I enter upon the duties of the great\r\n  office to which I have been chosen. I beg to thank you again for your\r\n  interest. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH 4, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison and his family, accompanied by Hon. James N. Huston,\r\nHon. W. H. H. Miller, Mr. E. W. Halford, Mr. E. F. Tibbott and family,\r\nMiss Sanger, and the representatives of the press, arrived in Washington\r\non the evening of February 26. The President-elect was met by Col. A.\r\nT. Britton, Geo. B. Williams, Gen. H. V. Boynton, J. K. McCammon, Gen.\r\nDaniel Macauley, and other members of the Inaugural Committee, and\r\nescorted to the Arlington Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural celebration was conducted by several hundred residents\r\nof Washington, acting through committees. The Executive Committee,\r\nhaving supervising charge of all matters pertaining to the celebration,\r\ncomprised the following prominent Washingtonians: Alex. T. Britton,\r\nChairman; Myron M. Parker, Vice-Chairman; Brainerd H. Warner, Treasurer;\r\nHenry L. Swords, Secretary; Elmon A. Adams, Joseph K. McCammon, James\r\nE. Bell, James G. Berret, Robert Boyd, Henry V. Boynton, Almon M.\r\nClapp, A. H. S. Davis, Frederick Douglass, John Joy Edson, Lawrence\r\nGardner, George Gibson, Charles C. Glover, Stilson Hutchins, E. Kurtz\r\nJohnson, George E. Lemon, John McElroy, Geo. A. McIlhenny, Crosby S.\r\nNoyes, Albert Ordway, Charles B. Purvis, Melancthon L. Ruth, Thomas\r\nSomerville, Orren G. Staples, John W. Thompson, Henry A. Willard, George\r\nB. Williams, Louis D. Wine, Simon Wolf, Levi P. Wright, and Hallett\r\nKilbourn. General James Beaver, Governor of Pennsylvania, was Chief\r\nMarshal of the day, and with a brilliant staff led the great column\r\nin its march to and from the Capitol. The veterans of the Seventieth\r\nIndiana Regiment were accorded the post of honor on the route to\r\nthe Capitol, and on conclusion of the ceremonies escorted their old\r\ncommander to the White House. Chief-Justice Fuller administered the oath\r\nof office.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison delivered his inaugural address from the terrace of\r\nthe Capitol in the presence of a vast concourse and during a rainfall.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n  There is no constitutional or legal requirement that the President\r\n  shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people. But\r\n  there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to\r\n  office of the chief executive officer of the Nation that from the\r\n  beginning of the Government the people, to whose service the official\r\n  oath consecrates the officer, have been called to witness the solemn\r\n  ceremonial. The oath taken in the presence of the people becomes a\r\n  mutual covenant; the officer covenants to serve the whole body of the\r\n  people by a faithful execution of the laws, so that they may be the\r\n  unfailing defence and security of those who respect and observe them,\r\n  and that neither wealth and station nor the power of combinations\r\n  shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest them from a\r\n  beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness.\r\n  My promise is spoken; yours unspoken, but not the less real and\r\n  solemn. The people of every State have here their representatives.\r\n  Surely I do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when I assume\r\n  that the whole body of the people covenant with me and with each other\r\n  to-day to support and defend the Constitution and the Union of the\r\n  States, to yield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every\r\n  other citizen his equal civil and political rights. Entering thus\r\n  solemnly in covenant with each other, we may reverently invoke and\r\n  confidently expect the favor and help of Almighty God, that He will\r\n  give to me wisdom, strength, and fidelity, and to our people a spirit\r\n  of fraternity and a love of righteousness and peace.\r\n\r\n  This occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the\r\n  presidential term which begins this day is the twenty-sixth under our\r\n  Constitution. The first inauguration of President Washington took\r\n  place in New York, where Congress was then sitting, on April 30, 1789,\r\n  having been deferred by reason of delays attending the organization\r\n  of the Congress and the canvass of the electoral vote. Our people\r\n  have already worthily observed the centennials of the Declaration of\r\n  Independence, of the battle of Yorktown, and of the adoption of the\r\n  Constitution, and will shortly celebrate in New York the institution\r\n  of the second great department of our constitutional scheme of\r\n  government. When the centennial of the institution of the judicial\r\n  department by the organization of the Supreme Court shall have been\r\n  suitably observed, as I trust it will be, our Nation will have fully\r\n  entered its second century.\r\n\r\n  I will not attempt to note the marvellous and, in great part, happy\r\n  contrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its\r\n  second century of organized existence under the Constitution, and that\r\n  weak but wisely ordered young Nation that looked undauntedly down the\r\n  first century, when all its years stretched out before it.\r\n\r\n  Our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which\r\n  accompanied the institution of government under the Constitution,\r\n  or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of\r\n  Washington and his great associates, and hope and courage in the\r\n  contrast which thirty-eight populous and prosperous States offer to\r\n  the thirteen States, weak in everything except courage and the love of\r\n  liberty, that then fringed our Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\n  The Territory of Dakota has now a population greater than any of\r\n  the original States--except Virginia--and greater than the aggregate\r\n  of five of the smaller States in 1790. The centre of population when\r\n  our national capital was located was east of Baltimore, and it was\r\n  argued by many well-informed persons that it would move eastward\r\n  rather than westward. Yet in 1880 it was found to be near Cincinnati,\r\n  and the new census, about to be taken, will show another stride to\r\n  the westward. That which was the body has come to be only the rich\r\n  fringe of the nation's robe. But our growth has not been limited to\r\n  territory, population, and aggregate wealth, marvellous as it has\r\n  been in each of those directions. The masses of our people are better\r\n  fed, clothed, and housed than their fathers were. The facilities\r\n  for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally\r\n  diffused. The virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent\r\n  proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts\r\n  and over the lives of our people. The influences of religion have been\r\n  multiplied and strengthened. The sweet offices of charity have greatly\r\n  increased. The virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation. We\r\n  have not attained an ideal condition. Not all of our people are happy\r\n  and prosperous; not all of them are virtuous and law-abiding. But,\r\n  on the whole, the opportunities offered to the individual to secure\r\n  the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere, and largely\r\n  better than they were here 100 years ago.\r\n\r\n  The surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the general\r\n  Government, effected by the adoption of the Constitution, was not\r\n  accomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly re-enforced\r\n  by the more imperative voice of experience. The divergent interests\r\n  of peace speedily demanded a \"more perfect union.\" The merchant, the\r\n  ship-master, and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our\r\n  statesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be\r\n  added to the political freedom which had been so bravely won. The\r\n  commercial policy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its\r\n  hard and oppressive features. To hold in check the development of\r\n  our commercial marine, to prevent or retard the establishment and\r\n  growth of manufactures in the States, and so to secure the American\r\n  market for their shops and the carrying trade for their ships, was the\r\n  policy of European statesmen, and was pursued with the most selfish\r\n  vigor. Petitions poured in upon Congress urging the imposition of\r\n  discriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed\r\n  things at home. The patriotism of the people, which no longer found a\r\n  field of exercise in war, was energetically directed to the duty of\r\n  equipping the young republic for the defence of its independence by\r\n  making its people self-dependent. Societies for the promotion of home\r\n  manufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of\r\n  the people were organized in many of the States. The revival at the\r\n  end of the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation\r\n  and development of domestic industries and the defence of our working\r\n  people against injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of\r\n  attention.\r\n\r\n  It is not a departure, but a return, that we have witnessed. The\r\n  protective policy had then its opponents. The argument was made, as\r\n  now, that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections. If\r\n  the question became in any sense, or at any time, sectional, it was\r\n  only because slavery existed in some of the States. But for this there\r\n  was no reason why the cotton-producing States should not have led\r\n  or walked abreast with the New England States in the production of\r\n  cotton fabrics. There was this reason only why the States that divide\r\n  with Pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern\r\n  and central mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to\r\n  the smelting furnace and the mill the coal and iron from their near\r\n  opposing hillsides. Mill-fires were lighted at the funeral pile of\r\n  slavery. The emancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the\r\n  earth as well as in the sky--men were made free and material things\r\n  became our better servants.\r\n\r\n  The sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff\r\n  discussion. We have no longer States that are necessarily only\r\n  planting States. None are excluded from achieving that diversification\r\n  of pursuit among the people which brings wealth and contentment.\r\n  The cotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is\r\n  spun in the country town by operatives whose necessities call for\r\n  diversified crops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural\r\n  products. Every new mine, furnace, and factory is an extension of the\r\n  productive capacity of the State more real and valuable than added\r\n  territory.\r\n\r\n  Shall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang\r\n  upon the skirts of progress? How long will those who rejoice that\r\n  slavery no longer exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it puts\r\n  upon their communities? I look hopefully to the continuance of our\r\n  protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing\r\n  and mining enterprises in the States hitherto wholly given to\r\n  agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification of our\r\n  people. The men who have invested their capital in these enterprises,\r\n  the farmers who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood, and the\r\n  men who work in shop or field will not fail to find and to defend\r\n  a community of interest. Is it not quite possible that the farmers\r\n  and the promoters of the great mining and manufacturing enterprises\r\n  which have recently been established in the South may yet find that\r\n  the free ballot of the workingman, without distinction of race, is\r\n  needed for their defence as well as for his own? I do not doubt that\r\n  if these men in the South who now accept the tariff views of Clay and\r\n  the constitutional expositions of Webster would courageously avow and\r\n  defend their real convictions they would not find it difficult, by\r\n  friendly instruction and co-operation, to make the black man their\r\n  efficient and safe ally, not only in establishing correct principles\r\n  in our national Administration, but in preserving for their local\r\n  communities the benefits of social order and economical and honest\r\n  government. At least until the good offices of kindness and education\r\n  have been fairly tried the contrary conclusion cannot be plausibly\r\n  urged.\r\n\r\n  I have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special executive\r\n  policy for any section of our country. It is the duty of the Executive\r\n  to administer and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities\r\n  pointed out and provided by the Constitution all the laws enacted by\r\n  Congress. These laws are general, and their administration should be\r\n  uniform and equal. As a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey,\r\n  neither may the Executive elect which he will enforce. The duty to\r\n  obey and execute embraces the Constitution in its entirety and the\r\n  whole code of laws enacted under it. The evil example of permitting\r\n  individuals, corporations, or communities to nullify the laws because\r\n  they cross some selfish or local interests or prejudices is full of\r\n  danger, not only to the Nation at large, but much more to those who\r\n  use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to\r\n  obtain an unjust advantage over others. They will presently themselves\r\n  be compelled to appeal to the law for protection, and those who would\r\n  use the law as a defence must not deny that use of it to others.\r\n\r\n  If our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their\r\n  legal obligations and duties they would have less cause to complain of\r\n  the unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference\r\n  with their operations. The community that by concert, open or secret,\r\n  among its citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain\r\n  rights under the law has severed the only safe bond of social order\r\n  and prosperity. The evil works, from a bad centre, both ways. It\r\n  demoralizes those who practise it, and destroys the faith of those who\r\n  suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector. The man\r\n  in whose breast that faith has been darkened is naturally the subject\r\n  of dangerous and uncanny suggestions. Those who use unlawful methods,\r\n  if moved by no higher motive than the selfishness that prompts them,\r\n  may well stop and inquire what is to be the end of this. An unlawful\r\n  expedient cannot become a permanent condition of government. If the\r\n  educated and influential classes in a community either practise or\r\n  connive at the systematic violation of laws that seem to them to\r\n  cross their convenience, what can they expect when the lesson that\r\n  convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for\r\n  lawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes? A community\r\n  where law is the rule of conduct, and where courts, not mobs, execute\r\n  its penalties, is the only attractive field for business investments\r\n  and honest labor.\r\n\r\n  Our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry\r\n  into the character and good disposition of persons applying for\r\n  citizenship more careful and searching. Our existing laws have been in\r\n  their administration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form.\r\n  We accept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness,\r\n  and he assumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to\r\n  what they are. The privileges of American citizenship are so great and\r\n  its duties so grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of\r\n  every person applying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of\r\n  our institutions. We should not cease to be hospitable to immigration,\r\n  but we should cease to be careless as to the character of it. There\r\n  are men of all races, even the best, whose coming is necessarily a\r\n  burden upon our public revenues or a threat to social order. These\r\n  should be identified and excluded.\r\n\r\n  We have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference\r\n  with European affairs. We have been only interested spectators of\r\n  their contentions in diplomacy and in war, ready to use our friendly\r\n  offices to promote peace, but never obtruding our advice and never\r\n  attempting unfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into\r\n  commercial advantage to ourselves. We have a just right to expect that\r\n  our European policy will be the American policy of European courts.\r\n\r\n  It is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our\r\n  peace and safety, which all the great powers habitually observe and\r\n  enforce in matters affecting them, that a shorter water-way between\r\n  our eastern and western seaboards should be dominated by any European\r\n  Government, that we may confidently expect that such a purpose will\r\n  not be entertained by any friendly power. We shall in the future, as\r\n  in the past, use every endeavor to maintain and enlarge our friendly\r\n  relations with all the great powers, but they will not expect us\r\n  to look kindly upon any project that would leave us subject to the\r\n  dangers of a hostile observation or environment.\r\n\r\n  We have not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker\r\n  neighbors, but rather to aid and encourage them to establish free and\r\n  stable governments, resting upon the consent of their own people. We\r\n  have a clear right to expect, therefore, that no European Government\r\n  will seek to establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of\r\n  these independent American States. That which a sense of justice\r\n  restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to\r\n  forego.\r\n\r\n  It must not be assumed, however, that our interests are so\r\n  exclusively American that our entire inattention to any events that\r\n  may transpire elsewhere can be taken for granted. Our citizens\r\n  domiciled for purposes of trade in all countries and in many of the\r\n  islands of the sea demand and will have our adequate care in their\r\n  personal and commercial rights. The necessities of our navy require\r\n  convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges. These and\r\n  other trading privileges we will feel free to obtain only by means\r\n  that do not in any degree partake of coercion, however feeble the\r\n  Government from which we ask such concessions. But having fairly\r\n  obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely consistent with the\r\n  most friendly disposition toward all other powers, our consent will be\r\n  necessary to any modification or impairment of the concession.\r\n\r\n  We shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation\r\n  or the just rights of its citizens, nor to exact the like treatment\r\n  for our own. Calmness, justice, and consideration should characterize\r\n  our diplomacy. The offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly\r\n  arbitration, in proper cases, should be adequate to the peaceful\r\n  adjustment of all international difficulties. By such methods we will\r\n  make our contribution to the world's peace, which no nation values\r\n  more highly, and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation\r\n  that ruthlessly breaks it.\r\n\r\n  The duty devolved by law upon the President to nominate and, by\r\n  and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint all public\r\n  officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the\r\n  Constitution or by act of Congress has become very burdensome, and its\r\n  wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty. The civil list is so\r\n  large that a personal knowledge of any large number of the applicants\r\n  is impossible. The President must rely upon the representations of\r\n  others, and these are often made inconsiderately and without any just\r\n  sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\n  I have a right, I think, to insist that those who volunteer or are\r\n  invited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration\r\n  and fidelity. A high sense of duty and an ambition to improve the\r\n  service should characterize all public officers. There are many ways\r\n  in which the convenience and comfort of those who have business with\r\n  our public officers may be promoted by a thoughtful and obliging\r\n  officer, and I shall expect those whom I may appoint to justify their\r\n  selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their\r\n  duties. Honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed by\r\n  me a disqualification for public office; but it will in no case be\r\n  allowed to serve as a shield for official negligence, incompetency, or\r\n  delinquency. It is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper\r\n  methods and with proper motives, and all applications will be treated\r\n  with consideration; but I shall need, and the heads of departments\r\n  will need, time for inquiry and deliberation. Persistent importunity\r\n  will not, therefore, be the best support of an application for office.\r\n\r\n  Heads of departments, bureaus, and all other public officers having\r\n  any duty connected therewith, will be expected to enforce the Civil\r\n  Service law fully and without evasion. Beyond this obvious duty\r\n  I hope to do something more to advance the reform of the civil\r\n  service. The ideal, or even my own ideal, I shall probably not\r\n  attain. Retrospect will be a safer basis of judgment than promises.\r\n  We shall not, however, I am sure, be able to put our civil service\r\n  upon a non-partisan basis until we have secured an incumbency that\r\n  fair minded men of the opposition will approve for impartiality and\r\n  integrity. As the number of such in the civil list is increased\r\n  removals from office will diminish.\r\n\r\n  While a treasury surplus is not the greatest evil, it is a serious\r\n  evil. Our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands\r\n  upon our treasury, with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary\r\n  but scarcely less imperative demands which arise now and then.\r\n  Expenditure should always be made with economy, and only upon\r\n  public necessity. Wastefulness, profligacy, or favoritism in public\r\n  expenditures is criminal; but there is nothing in the condition of\r\n  our country or of our people to suggest that anything presently\r\n  necessary to the public prosperity, security, or honor should be\r\n  unduly postponed. It will be the duty of Congress wisely to forecast\r\n  and estimate these extraordinary demands, and, having added them to\r\n  our ordinary expenditures, to so adjust our revenue laws that no\r\n  considerable annual surplus will remain. We will fortunately be able\r\n  to apply to the redemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen\r\n  excess of revenue. This is better than to reduce our income below\r\n  our necessary expenditures with the resulting choice between another\r\n  change of our revenue laws and an increase of the public debt. It is\r\n  quite possible, I am sure, to effect the necessary reduction in our\r\n  revenues without breaking down our protective tariff or seriously\r\n  injuring any domestic industry.\r\n\r\n  The construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of\r\n  their necessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent\r\n  with care and perfection in plans and workmanship. The spirit,\r\n  courage, and skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times\r\n  in our history given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating\r\n  greatly beyond that of the naval list. That they will again do so\r\n  upon occasion I do not doubt; but they ought not, by premeditation or\r\n  neglect, to be left to the risks and exigencies of an unequal combat.\r\n\r\n  We should encourage the establishment of American steamship lines.\r\n  The exchanges of commerce demand stated, reliable, and rapid means of\r\n  communication, and until these are provided the development of our\r\n  trade with the States lying south of us is impossible.\r\n\r\n  Our pension law should give more adequate and discriminating relief\r\n  to the Union soldiers and sailors and to their widows and orphans.\r\n  Such occasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to\r\n  their valor and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n  It is a subject of congratulation that there is a near prospect of\r\n  the admission into the Union of the Dakotas and Montana and Washington\r\n  Territories. This act of justice has been unreasonably delayed in the\r\n  case of some of them. The people who have settled those Territories\r\n  are intelligent, enterprising, and patriotic, and the accession\r\n  of these new States will add strength to the Nation. It is due to\r\n  the settlers in the Territories who have availed themselves of the\r\n  invitations of our land laws to make homes upon the public domain that\r\n  their titles should be speedily adjusted and their honest entries\r\n  confirmed by patent.\r\n\r\n  It is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being\r\n  manifested in the reform of our election laws. Those who have been for\r\n  years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about\r\n  the ballot-box and about the elector further safeguards, in order\r\n  that our elections might not only be free and pure, but might clearly\r\n  appear to be so, will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon\r\n  discover the need of reform. The national Congress has not as yet\r\n  taken control of elections in that case over which the Constitution\r\n  gives it jurisdiction, but has accepted and adopted the election laws\r\n  of the several States, provided penalties for their violation and a\r\n  method of supervision. Only the inefficiency of the State laws or an\r\n  unfair partisan administration of them could suggest a departure from\r\n  this policy. It was clearly, however, in the contemplation of the\r\n  framers of the Constitution that such an exigency might arise, and\r\n  provision was wisely made for it. No power vested in Congress or in\r\n  the Executive to secure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon\r\n  occasion.\r\n\r\n  The people of all the Congressional districts have an equal\r\n  interest that the election in each shall truly express the views and\r\n  wishes of a majority of the qualified electors residing within it.\r\n  The results of such elections are not local, and the insistence of\r\n  electors residing in other districts that they shall be pure and free\r\n  does not savor at all of impertinence. If in any of the States the\r\n  public security is thought to be threatened by ignorance among the\r\n  electors, the obvious remedy is education. The sympathy and help of\r\n  our people will not be withheld from any community struggling with\r\n  special embarrassments or difficulties connected with the suffrage,\r\n  if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are promoted\r\n  by just and honorable methods. How shall those who practise election\r\n  frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is\r\n  the first condition and obligation of good citizenship? The man who\r\n  has come to regard the ballot-box as a juggler's hat has renounced his\r\n  allegiance.\r\n\r\n  Let us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions. Let\r\n  those who would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better\r\n  proof of their patriotism and a higher glory to their country by\r\n  promoting fraternity and justice. A party success that is achieved by\r\n  unfair methods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful\r\n  and evanescent, even from a party standpoint. We should hold our\r\n  differing opinions in mutual respect, and, having submitted them to\r\n  the arbitrament of the ballot, should accept an adverse judgment with\r\n  the same respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the\r\n  decision had been in our favor.\r\n\r\n  No other people have a government more worthy of their respect and\r\n  love, or a land so magnificent in extent, so pleasant to look upon,\r\n  and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor. God has\r\n  placed upon our head a diadem, and has laid at our feet power and\r\n  wealth beyond definition or calculation. But we must not forget that\r\n  we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall\r\n  hold the reins of power, and that the upward avenues of hope shall be\r\n  free to all the people.\r\n\r\n  I do not mistrust the future. Dangers have been in frequent ambush\r\n  along our path, but we have uncovered and vanquished them all.\r\n  Passion has swept some of our communities, but only to give us a new\r\n  demonstration that the great body of our people are stable, patriotic,\r\n  and law-abiding. No political party can long pursue advantage at the\r\n  expense of public honor or by rude and indecent methods, without\r\n  protest and fatal disaffection in its own body. The peaceful agencies\r\n  of commerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our\r\n  communities, and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting\r\n  mutual respect. We shall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation\r\n  which our next census will make of the swift development of the great\r\n  resources of some of the States. Each State will bring its generous\r\n  contribution to the great aggregate of the Nation's increase. And when\r\n  the harvest from the fields, the cattle from the hills, and the ores\r\n  of the earth shall have been weighed, counted, and valued, we will\r\n  turn from them all to crown with the highest honor the State that has\r\n  most promoted education, virtue, justice, and patriotism among the\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY, APRIL 30, 1889.\r\n\r\n_The Nation's Centenary._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebration, at the city of New York, of the one hundredth\r\nanniversary of the inauguration of George Washington as first President\r\nof the United States was more than national in its scope and influence.\r\nThe people of the entire continent manifested a gratifying interest\r\nin it, and no event in our history has been commemorated with greater\r\nsuccess. The occasion called together more than two million people\r\nwithin the gateways of the great metropolis, many of them our most\r\ndistinguished and representative citizens. The celebration was conducted\r\nunder the auspices of one hundred prominent citizens, organized as a\r\ngeneral committee, of which the Hon. Hamilton Fish was President; Mayor\r\nHugh J. Grant, Chairman; Hon. Elbridge T. Gerry, Chairman Executive\r\nCommittee; and Clarence W. Bowen, Secretary.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of April 29 the President, accompanied by Mrs.\r\nHarrison, Mrs. J. R. McKee, Mr. and Mrs. Russell B. Harrison, the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, Chief Justice and Mrs. Fuller, Justice and Mrs.\r\nField, Justice Blatchford, Justice Strong, Major-General Schofield, Mr.\r\nWalker Blaine and Miss Blaine, Col. Thos. F. Barr, Lieut. T. B. M. Mason\r\nand Mrs. Mason, left Washington by special train tendered by President\r\nGeo. R. Roberts and Vice-President Frank Thomson, of the Pennsylvania\r\nCompany. The distinguished guests were escorted by the following members\r\nof the Centennial Committee designated for this honorable duty: John A.\r\nKing, Chairman; John Jay, Edward Cooper, Wm. H. Wickham, Wm. R. Grace,\r\nFrederick J. DePeyster, Wm. H. Robertson, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Wm. M.\r\nEvarts, Frank Hiscock, Seth Low, Orlando B. Potter, Clifford S. Sims,\r\nJas. Duane Livingston, and Frank S. Witherbee.\r\n\r\nAt Trenton the party was met by the New Jersey Centennial Committee,\r\nconsisting of Governor Green, General Sewell, Rev. Dr. Hamill, Colonel\r\nStockton, General Grubb, Colonel Donnelly, Captain Skirm, Senator\r\nCramner, Senator Cattell, Colonel Chambers, and others.\r\n\r\nArrived at Elizabeth the President breakfasted with Governor Green\r\nand then held a reception, conducted by Col. Rob't S. Green, assisted\r\nby Col. Suydam, Chas. G. Parkhurst, and John L. Boggs. Following the\r\nroute taken by Washington, President Harrison and his party embarked\r\nat Elizabethport on board the U. S. S. _Despatch_, and, escorted by a\r\nmagnificent fleet of war ships, merchant marine, and craft of all kinds,\r\nproceeded up the Kills to the bay amid the roar of cannon from the\r\nseveral forts and the men-of-war.\r\n\r\nAt the gangway of the _Despatch_ the President was received by Jackson\r\nS. Schultz and the following gentlemen, comprising the Committee on\r\nNavy: John S. Barnes, George G. Haven, D. Willis James, Frederick R.\r\nCoudert, Capt. Henry Erben, Ogden Goelet, John Jay Pierrepont, Loyall\r\nFarragut, Alfred C. Cheney, Buchanan Winthrop, and S. Nicholson Kane.\r\nOther distinguished guests on the _Despatch_ were Gov. David B. Hill,\r\nGen. William T. Sherman, Admiral David D. Porter, Commodore Ramsey,\r\nand Jas. M. Varnum. Several hundred thousand patriotic people greeted\r\nthe _Despatch_ as she proudly entered the harbor. The scene was a most\r\nmemorable one.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of Washington, President Harrison was rowed ashore\r\nin a barge, landing at Pier 16, where he was met by the venerable\r\nHamilton Fish, who welcomed him to New York. Proceeding to the Equitable\r\nBuilding, the President was tendered a reception in the rooms of\r\nthe Lawyers' Club, followed by a banquet under the auspices of the\r\nCommittee on States, consisting of the following distinguished citizens:\r\nWilliam G. Hamilton, Chairman; James C. Carter, John Schuyler, J. T.\r\nVan Rensselaer, James W. Husted, Theo. Roosevelt, Jacob A. Cantor, E.\r\nEllery Anderson, Floyd Clarkson, Henry W. LeRoy, John B. Pine, Samuel\r\nBorrowe, and Jas. M. Montgomery. Among the guests--other than the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet and the other prominent gentlemen who accompanied\r\nthe President on the _Despatch_--were ex-President R. B. Hayes and the\r\nGovernors of thirty-five States.\r\n\r\nAt night the President and his Cabinet attended the grand centennial\r\nball at the Metropolitan Opera House, at which 6,000 guests were\r\npresent. This brilliant entertainment, rendered memorable by the\r\npresence of so many distinguished people, was given under the auspices\r\nof a committee composed of the following society leaders: Stuyvesant\r\nFish, Chairman; William Waldorf Astor, William K. Vanderbilt, William\r\nJay, Egerton L. Winthrop, Robert Goelet, Wm. B. Beekman, Stephen H.\r\nOlin, Wm. E. D. Stokes, and Gouverneur Morris.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 30th--Centennial Day--the President, members of his\r\nCabinet, with ex-Presidents Cleveland and Hayes, Governor Hill, and\r\nmany other noted guests, attended thanksgiving services at St. Paul's\r\nChurch. The President and his family occupied the Washington pew. The\r\nexercises were conducted by the Rt. Rev. Henry C. Potter, Bishop of New\r\nYork. The literary exercises were held on the steps of the sub-Treasury,\r\nwhere General Washington took his oath of office a hundred years before.\r\nCountless thousands surrounded the speaker's stand and congregated in\r\nthe vicinity. Elbridge T. Gerry presided and introduced Rev. Richard\r\nS. Storrs, who delivered the invocation. Secretary Bowen read a poem\r\nentitled \"The Vow of Washington,\" composed for the occasion by the\r\nvenerable John Greenleaf Whittier. Hon. Chauncey M. Depew then delivered\r\nthe Centennial oration. On conclusion, Chairman Gerry introduced\r\nPresident Harrison, who was greeted with a grand outburst as he advanced\r\nto the front. Amid repeated interruptions with cheers he spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, my Countrymen_--Official duty of a very exacting\r\n  character has made it quite impossible that I should deliver an\r\n  address on this occasion. Foreseeing this, I early notified your\r\n  committee that the programme must not contain any address by me. The\r\n  selection of Mr. Depew as the orator of this occasion makes further\r\n  speech not only difficult, but superfluous. He has met the demand of\r\n  this great occasion on its own high level. He has brought before us\r\n  the incidents and the lessons of the first inauguration of Washington.\r\n  We seem to have been a part of that admiring and almost adoring throng\r\n  that filled these streets one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n  We have come into the serious, but always inspiring, presence\r\n  of Washington. He was the incarnation of duty, and he teaches us\r\n  to-day this great lesson: That those who would associate their\r\n  names with events that shall outlive a century can only do so by\r\n  high consecration to duty. Self-seeking has no public observance or\r\n  anniversary. The captain who gives to the sea his cargo of goods,\r\n  that he may give safety and deliverance to his imperilled fellow-men,\r\n  has fame; he who lands the cargo has only wages. Washington seemed to\r\n  come to the discharge of the duties of his high office impressed with\r\n  a great sense of his unfamiliarity with these new calls thrust upon\r\n  him, modestly doubtful of his own ability, but trusting implicitly in\r\n  the sustaining helpfulness and grace of that God who rules the world,\r\n  presides in the councils of nations, and is able to supply every human\r\n  defect. We have made marvellous progress in material things since\r\n  then, but the stately and enduring shaft that we have erected at the\r\n  national capital at Washington symbolizes the fact that he is still\r\n  the First American Citizen. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Military Parade and Banquet._\r\n\r\nOn conclusion of the ceremonies at the sub-Treasury the President and\r\nother honored guests of the day reviewed the grand military parade\r\nfrom a stand in Madison Square. Along the line of march, especially on\r\nBroadway and Fifth Avenue, for several miles the gorgeous pageant moved\r\nbetween two living walls. Never were so many people congregated on this\r\ncontinent. The glittering column, commanded by General Schofield, moved\r\nwith continuous precision, and was five hours and twenty-five minutes\r\nin passing the reviewing stand. The President remained at his post,\r\nsaluting the last company. The troops of the various States were led by\r\ntheir Governors.\r\n\r\nThis monster military demonstration and the great industrial parade of\r\nthe day following were conducted under the management of a committee\r\ncomprising the following well-known gentlemen: S. Van Rensselaer Cruger,\r\nChairman; John Cochrane, Locke W. Winchester, J. Hampden Robb, Frederick\r\nGallatin, Frederick D. Tappen, and John C. Tomlinson.\r\n\r\nThe President's visit concluded with his participation in the greatest\r\nbanquet known to modern times, held at the Metropolitan Opera House.\r\nThe lavish decorations, the magnitude and occasion of the entertainment\r\nhave rendered it historical. Eight hundred guests were seated at\r\nthe tables, while the surrounding boxes and stalls were overflowing\r\nwith distinguished ladies eagerly partaking of the feast of reason.\r\nMayor Grant presided, and introduced Governor Hill, who welcomed the\r\nguests. Ex-President Cleveland responded to the toast \"Our People;\"\r\nGov. Fitzhugh Lee, of Virginia, spoke to \"The States;\" Chief-Justice\r\nFuller responded to \"The Federal Constitution;\" Hon. John W. Daniel\r\nspoke to \"The Senate;\" ex-President Hayes to \"The Presidency.\" Among\r\nother prominent guests were Vice-President Morton, General Sherman,\r\nLieutenant-Governor Jones, of New York, Judge Charles Andrews, Hon.\r\nHannibal Hamlin, Mayor Chapin, of Brooklyn, Governor Foraker, of Ohio,\r\nAbram S. Hewitt, Cornelius N. Bliss, Fred'k S. Tallmadge, Samuel D.\r\nBabcock, Chauncey M. Depew, Erastus Wiman, Charles W. Dayton, Josiah\r\nM. Fisk, William Henry Smith, Thomas S. Moore, Henry Clews, Austin\r\nCorbin, Philip L. Livingston, Brayton Ives, Darius O. Mills, Richard\r\nT. Wilson, William L. Strong, Henry B. Hyde, James M. Brown, Louis\r\nFitzgerald, Allan Campbell, John Sloane, James D. Smith, Edward V. Loew,\r\nEugene Kelly, Walter Stanton, John F. Plummer, J. Edward Simmons, John\r\nJay Knox, De Lancey Nicoll, Henry G. Marquand, Gordon L. Ford, Daniel\r\nHuntington, F. Hopkinson Smith, William E. Dodge, Chas. Parsons, A. W.\r\nDrake, Oliver H. Perry, Frank D. Millet, H. H. Boyesen, Charles Henry\r\nHart, Rutherford Stuyvesant, John L. Cadwalader, Lispenard Stewart,\r\nChas. H. Russell, Jr., and Richard W. Gilder.\r\n\r\nAfter the Chief-Justice's address President Harrison was introduced and\r\nreceived with a storm of applause. He spoke to the toast \"The United\r\nStates of America\" as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Fellow-citizens_--I should be unjust to myself,\r\n  and, what is more serious, I should be unjust to you, if I did not\r\n  at this first and last opportunity express to you the deep sense of\r\n  obligation and thankfulness which I feel for these many personal and\r\n  official courtesies which have been extended to me since I came to\r\n  take part in this celebration. The official representatives of the\r\n  State of New York and of this great city have attended me with the\r\n  most courteous kindness, omitting no attention that could make my\r\n  stay among you pleasant and gratifying. From you and at the hands of\r\n  those who have thronged the streets of the city to-day I have received\r\n  the most cordial expressions of good will. I would not, however,\r\n  have you understand that these loud acclaims have been in any sense\r\n  appropriated as a personal tribute to myself. I have realized that\r\n  there was that in this occasion and all these interesting incidents\r\n  which have made it so profoundly impressive to my mind which was above\r\n  and greater than any living man. I have realized that the tribute of\r\n  cordial interest which you have manifested was rendered to that great\r\n  office which, by the favor of a greater people, I now exercise, rather\r\n  than to me.\r\n\r\n  The occasion and all of its incidents will be memorable not only\r\n  in the history of your own city, but in the history of our country.\r\n  New York did not succeed in retaining the seat of national government\r\n  here, although she made liberal provision for the assembling of the\r\n  first Congress in the expectation that the Congress might find its\r\n  permanent home here. But though you lost that which you coveted, I\r\n  think the representatives here of all the States will agree that it\r\n  was fortunate that the first inauguration of Washington took place in\r\n  the State and the city of New York.\r\n\r\n  For where in our country could the centennial of the event be so\r\n  worthily celebrated as here? What seaboard offered so magnificent a\r\n  bay on which to display our merchant and naval marine? What city\r\n  offered thoroughfares so magnificent, or a people so great, so\r\n  generous, as New York has poured out to-day to celebrate that event?\r\n\r\n  I have received at the hands of the committee who have been charged\r\n  with the details--onerous, exacting, and too often unthankful--of this\r\n  demonstration evidence of their confidence in my physical endurance.\r\n  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  I must also acknowledge still one other obligation. The committee\r\n  having in charge the exercises of this event have also given me\r\n  another evidence of their confidence, which has been accompanied with\r\n  some embarrassment. As I have noticed the progress of this banquet, it\r\n  seemed to me that each of the speakers had been made acquainted with\r\n  his theme before he took his seat at the banquet, and that I alone\r\n  was left to make acquaintance with my theme when I sat down to the\r\n  table. I prefer to substitute for the official title which is upon the\r\n  programme the familiar and fireside expression, \"Our Country.\"\r\n\r\n  I congratulate you to-day, as one of the instructive and interesting\r\n  features of this occasion, that these great thoroughfares dedicated\r\n  to trade have closed their doors and covered up the insignias of\r\n  commerce; that your great exchanges have closed and your citizens\r\n  given themselves up to the observance of the celebration in which we\r\n  are participating.\r\n\r\n  I believe that patriotism has been intensified in many hearts by\r\n  what we have witnessed to-day. I believe that patriotism has been\r\n  placed in a higher and holier fane in many hearts. The bunting with\r\n  which you have covered your walls, these patriotic inscriptions,\r\n  must go down and the wage and trade be resumed again. Here may I not\r\n  ask you to carry those inscriptions that now hang on the walls into\r\n  your homes, into the schools of your city, into all of your great\r\n  institutions where children are gathered, and teach them that the eye\r\n  of the young and the old should look upon that flag as one of the\r\n  familiar glories of every American? Have we not learned that no stocks\r\n  and bonds, nor land, is our country? It is a spiritual thought that\r\n  is in our minds--it is the flag and what it stands for; it is the\r\n  fireside and the home; it is the thoughts that are in our hearts, born\r\n  of the inspiration which comes with the story of the flag, of martyrs\r\n  to liberty. It is the graveyard into which a common country has\r\n  gathered the unconscious deeds of those who died that the thing might\r\n  live which we love and call our country, rather than anything that can\r\n  be touched or seen.\r\n\r\n  Let me add a thought due to our country's future. Perhaps never\r\n  have we been so well equipped for war upon land as now, and we have\r\n  never seen the time when our people were more smitten with the love of\r\n  peace. To elevate the morals of our people; to hold up the law as that\r\n  sacred thing which, like the ark of God of old, may not be touched\r\n  by irreverent hands, but frowns upon any attempt to dethrone its\r\n  supremacy; to unite our people in all that makes home comfortable, as\r\n  well as to give our energies in the direction of material advancement,\r\n  this service may we render. And out of this great demonstration let us\r\n  draw lessons to inspire us to consecrate ourselves anew to this love\r\n  and service of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 22, 1889.\r\n\r\n_Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument._\r\n\r\n\r\nA memorable event in the history of Indiana was the laying of the\r\ncorner-stone of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument at Indianapolis\r\non August 22, 1889. The Board of Commissioners for the erection of\r\nthe monument--under whose supervision the attendant exercises were\r\nconducted--comprised: George J. Langsdale, of Greencastle, President;\r\nGeo. W. Johnston, of Indianapolis, Secretary; T. W. Bennett, of\r\nRichmond; S. B. Voyles, of Salem; and D. C. McCollum, of La Porte.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison and his party were honored guests on the occasion; he\r\nwas accompanied by Secretary Jeremiah M. Rusk, Attorney-General W. H.\r\nH. Miller, Private Secretary E. W. Halford, Capt. William M. Meredith,\r\nMarshal Daniel M. Ransdell, and General Thomas J. Morgan.\r\n\r\nAt College Corner, on the Indiana border, the President was met by Gov.\r\nAlvin P. Hovey, Mayor Caleb S. Denny, Hon. William H. English, William\r\nScott, John P. Frenzel, Robert S. McKee, J. A. Wildman, Albert Gall,\r\nDr. Henry Jameson, and others, comprising an honorary escort committee.\r\nGovernor Hovey welcomed the President to Indiana in a brief, cordial\r\naddress, to which President Harrison responded:\r\n\r\n  I thank the Governor for this larger welcome extended as Governor on\r\n  the part of the people of the whole State. You have well said that the\r\n  people of Indiana have been kind to me, and if, when my public career\r\n  is ended, I can return to you the happy possessor of your respect and\r\n  good-will, I shall not leave public office with regret.\r\n\r\nArriving at Indianapolis on the evening of the 21st, the President\r\nwas formally waited upon by the Monument Commissioners and Board of\r\nTrade Reception Committee. General James R. Carnahan, on behalf of the\r\nCommissioners, and George G. Tanner, President of the Board of Trade,\r\nwarmly welcomed him.\r\n\r\nTo their addresses President Harrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen of the Committees and Friends_--I scarcely know how to\r\n  convey to you my deep impressions at this cordial welcome back to\r\n  Indianapolis. I cannot hope to do it. I have been deeply touched by\r\n  this generous and courteous reception. It was not my expectation when\r\n  I left Indianapolis a few months ago, under so serious a sense of my\r\n  responsibilities, that I would return again so soon to my home. But\r\n  this occasion was one which I could not well be absent from. It is one\r\n  that should enlist to a degree that nothing else can do our patriotic\r\n  interests and State pride. It is true, as General Carnahan has said,\r\n  that I took an early interest in this movement. I felt that until this\r\n  monument was built, until its top-stone was laid, and its voice had\r\n  been heard by the people of this State in expressive speech, we had\r\n  not done that for our soldier dead which we should, and that we had\r\n  neglected those who died for us. I am glad, therefore, to be present\r\n  and see this monument started. I reverently rejoice with you on this\r\n  occasion, and hail the work which these commissioners have so wisely\r\n  and magnificently begun.\r\n\r\nAmong other distinguished guests participating in the ceremonies were\r\nMrs. Jennie Meyerhoff, of Evansville, President of the Woman's Relief\r\nCorps, Department of Indiana; Col. George C. Harvey, of Danville,\r\ncommanding the Sons of Veterans, Division of Indiana; Mrs. Zelda\r\nSeguin-Wallace and Miss Laura McManis, Indianapolis; Miss Kate Hammond,\r\nGreencastle, and Rev. H. J. Talbott.\r\n\r\nThe march to the monument was one of the most imposing demonstrations\r\never witnessed in Indiana. Fifteen thousand veterans and others formed\r\nthe great column, commanded by Chief Marshal Charles A. Zollinger, of\r\nFort Wayne; Chief of Staff, Major Irvin Robbins; Adjutant-General, Major\r\nWilbur F. Hitt, assisted by a brilliant staff of 60 prominent citizens.\r\nIn addition to these officers of the day was a mounted honorary staff,\r\nrepresenting the thirteen Congressional districts. They were: First\r\nDistrict, Gil R. Stormont, Princeton; Second, Col. Elijah Cavens,\r\nBloomfield; Third, Capt. James B. Patton, Jeffersonville; Fourth,\r\nMarine D. Tackett, Greensburg; Fifth, Maj. J. G. Dunbar, Greencastle;\r\nSixth, Maj. J. F. Wildman, Muncie; Seventh, Capt. D. W. Hamilton,\r\nIndianapolis; Eighth, Capt. A. C. Ford, Terre Haute; Ninth, Col. R. P.\r\nDeHart, Lafayette; Tenth, Capt. M. L. DeMotte, Valparaiso; Eleventh,\r\nCol. C. E. Briant, Huntington; Twelfth, Capt. J. C. Peltier, Fort Wayne;\r\nThirteenth, Gen. Reub. Williams, Warsaw. More than 100,000 people\r\nwitnessed the pageant.\r\n\r\nThe monument is a majestic square embellished shaft of Indiana\r\nlimestone, some 250 feet high, surmounted by a heroic figure of Victory,\r\nthe pedestal resting upon a great circular stone terrace. The architects\r\nwere Bruno Schmitz, of Berlin, and Frederick Baumann, of Chicago. The\r\nceremony of laying the corner-stone was conducted by the following\r\nofficials of the Grand Army of the Republic: Commander of the Department\r\nof Indiana Charles M. Travis, of Crawfordsville; Senior Vice Department\r\nCommander P. D. Harris, of Shelbyville; Junior Vice-Commander B. B.\r\nCampbell, of Anderson; Assistant Adjutant-General I. N. Walker, of\r\nIndianapolis; Officers of the Day Wm. H. Armstrong, of Indianapolis, and\r\nLieut.-Gov. Ira J. Chase, of Danville.\r\n\r\nGov. Alvin P. Hovey, as presiding officer, delivered an eloquent opening\r\naddress, which was followed by the singing of the hymn \"Dedication,\"\r\nwritten for the occasion by Charles M. Walker, of Indianapolis. The\r\nspeakers of the day were Gen. Mahlon D. Manson, of Crawfordsville, and\r\nGen. John Coburn, of Indianapolis. Their masterly orations were followed\r\nby the reading of a poem, \"What Shall It Teach?\" written by Capt. Lee O.\r\nHarris, of Greenfield.\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Hovey introduced the Chief Executive of the Nation the\r\nvast audience swayed with enthusiasm. In a voice low, and with a slight\r\ntremble in it, President Harrison began his fine tribute to the men who\r\nresponded to the country's call. As he proceeded his voice rose higher\r\nuntil it rang out clear as a bugle and drew from the multitude repeated\r\nand vociferous cheers. He spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Fellow-citizens_--I did not expect to make any\r\n  address on this occasion. It would have been pleasant, if I could\r\n  have found leisure to make suitable preparation, to have accepted\r\n  the invitation of the committee having these exercises in charge\r\n  to deliver an oration. I would have felt it an honor to associate\r\n  my name with an occasion so great as this. Public duties, however,\r\n  prevented the acceptance of the invitation, and I could only promise\r\n  to be present with you to-day. It seemed to me most appropriate that\r\n  I should take part with my fellow-citizens of Indiana in this great\r\n  ceremony. There have been few occasions in the history of our State\r\n  so full of interest, so magnificent, so inspiring, as that which\r\n  we now witness. The suggestion that a monument should be builded\r\n  to commemorate the valor and heroism of those soldiers of Indiana\r\n  who gave their lives for the flag attracted my interest from the\r\n  beginning. Five years ago last January, when the people assembled in\r\n  the opera-house yonder to unveil the statue which had been worthily\r\n  set up to our great war Governor, I ventured to express the hope that\r\n  near by it, as a twin expression of one great sentiment, there might\r\n  be builded a noble shaft, not to any man, not to bear on any of its\r\n  majestic faces the name of a man, but a monument about which the sons\r\n  of veterans, the mothers of our dead, the widows that are yet with us,\r\n  might gather, and, pointing to the stately shaft, say: \"There is his\r\n  monument.\" The hope expressed that day is realized now. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I congratulate the people of Indiana that our Legislature\r\n  has generously met the expectations of our patriotic people. I\r\n  congratulate the commission having this great work in charge that\r\n  they have secured a design which will not suffer under the criticism\r\n  of the best artists of the world. I congratulate you that a monument\r\n  so costly as to show that we value that which it commemorates, so\r\n  artistic as to express the sentiment which evoked it, is to stand in\r\n  the capital of Indiana. Does any one say there is wastefulness here?\r\n  [Cries of \"No, no!\"] My countrymen, $200,000 has never passed, and\r\n  never will pass, from the treasury of Indiana that will give a better\r\n  return than the expenditure for the erection of this monument. As I\r\n  have witnessed these ceremonies and listened to these patriotic hymns\r\n  I have read in the faces of the men who stand about me that lifting up\r\n  of the soul, that kindling of patriotic fire, that has made me realize\r\n  that on such occasions the Nation is laying deep and strong its future\r\n  security.\r\n\r\n  This is a monument by Indiana to Indiana soldiers. But I beg\r\n  you to remember that they were only soldiers of Indiana until the\r\n  enlistment oath was taken; that from that hour until they came back\r\n  to the generous State that had sent them forth they were soldiers of\r\n  the Union. So that it seemed to me not inappropriate that I should\r\n  bring to you to-day the sympathy and cheer of the loyal people of\r\n  all the States. No American citizen need avoid it or pass it with\r\n  unsympathetic eyes, for, my countrymen, it does not commemorate a war\r\n  of subjugation. There is not in the United States to-day a man who, if\r\n  he realizes what has occurred since the war and has opened his soul to\r\n  the sight of that which is to come, who will not feel that it is good\r\n  for all our people that victory crowned the cause which this monument\r\n  commemorates. I do seriously believe that if we can measure among the\r\n  States the benefits resulting from the preservation of the Union, the\r\n  rebellious States have the larger share. It destroyed an institution\r\n  that was their destruction. It opened the way for a commercial life\r\n  that, if they will only embrace it and face the light, means to them a\r\n  development that shall rival the best attainments of the greatest of\r\n  our States.\r\n\r\n  And now let me thank you for your pleasant greeting. I have felt\r\n  lifted up by this occasion. It seems to me that our spirits have been\r\n  borne up to meet those of the dead and glorified, and that from this\r\n  place we shall go to our homes more resolutely set in our purpose\r\n  as citizens to conserve the peace and welfare of our neighborhoods,\r\n  to hold up the dignity and honor of our free institutions, and to\r\n  see that no harm shall come to our country, whether from internal\r\n  dissensions or from the aggressions of a foreign foe. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nA camp-fire was held at night at Tomlinson Hall, presided over by\r\nCharles M. Travis, Commander of Indiana G. A. R., where an audience of\r\nover 5,000 assembled. The orators of the occasion were Hon. Samuel B.\r\nVoyles, of Salem; Judge Daniel Waugh, of Tipton; General Jasper Packard,\r\nof New Albany; Col. I. N. Walker and Albert J. Beveridge, Indianapolis;\r\nHon. Benj. S. Parker, New Castle, and Hon. Wm. R. Myers, Anderson.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison's appearance was greeted by a prolonged\r\ndemonstration, the audience rising with one impulse. Commander Travis\r\nsaid: \"I told you I would treat you to a surprise. Here is your\r\nPresident. He needs no introduction.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison's reply was:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman, Comrades_--I think I will treat you to another\r\n  surprise. My Indiana friends have been so much accustomed to have\r\n  me talk on all occasions that I am sure nothing would gratify them\r\n  more--nothing would be a greater surprise than for me to decline to\r\n  talk to-night. I am very grateful for this expression of your interest\r\n  and respect. That comradeship and good feeling which your cordial\r\n  salutation has expressed to me I beg every comrade of the Grand Army\r\n  here to-night to believe I feel for him.\r\n\r\n  Now, I am sure, in view of the labors of yesterday and to-day,\r\n  that you will allow me to wish you prosperous, happy, useful lives,\r\n  honorable and peaceful deaths, and that those who survive you may\r\n  point to this shaft, which is being reared yonder, as a worthy tribute\r\n  of your services in defence of your country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, AUGUST 23, 1889.\r\n\r\n_Reunion of the Seventieth Indiana._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day following the ceremonies at the Soldiers' Monument President\r\nHarrison attended the fifteenth annual reunion of his old regiment,\r\nthe Seventieth Indiana, at Tomlinson Hall. Many survivors of the One\r\nHundred and Second and One Hundred and Fifth Indiana, the One Hundred\r\nand Twenty-ninth Illinois, and the Seventy-ninth Ohio regiments were\r\npresent. These regiments, with the Seventieth, constituted the First\r\nBrigade--General Harrison's command. The gathering, therefore, was\r\nalternately a regimental and brigade reunion.\r\n\r\nCol. Samuel Merrill, who delivered the annual address, escorted the\r\nPresident, and amid enthusiastic cheering installed him as presiding\r\nofficer of the assembly. Other prominent members of the Seventieth\r\npresent were Gen. Thomas J. Morgan, Capt. Wm. M. Meredith, Daniel M.\r\nRansdell, Moses G. McLain, Capt. H. M. Endsley, Capt. Wm. Mitchell,\r\nand Capt. Chas. H. Cox. General Harrison was unanimously re-elected\r\nPresident of the regimental association; he was also chosen first\r\nPresident of the brigade association. The other brigade officers were\r\nVice-President, Gen. Daniel Dustin; Second Vice-President, Gen. A. W.\r\nDoane; Secretary, J. M. Ayers; Treasurer, E. H. Conger.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Mayor Denny, City Attorney W. L. Taylor cordially\r\nwelcomed the veterans to Indianapolis. To this greeting the presiding\r\nofficer, President Harrison, responded:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Taylor_--The survivors of the Seventieth Indiana Volunteer\r\n  Infantry, now assembled in annual reunion, have heard, with great\r\n  gratification, the cordial words of welcome which you have addressed\r\n  to us. We have never doubted the hospitality of the citizens of this\r\n  great city, and have several times held our reunions here; and if\r\n  we have more frequently sought some of the quieter towns in this\r\n  Congressional district--where the regiment was organized--it has\r\n  only been because we could be a little more to ourselves than was\r\n  possible in this city. You will not think this a selfish instinct when\r\n  I tell you that, as the years go on, these reunions of our regiment\r\n  become more and more a family affair; and as in the gathering of\r\n  the scattered members of a family in the family reunion, so we have\r\n  loved, when we get together as comrades, to be somewhat apart, that\r\n  we might enjoy each other. It has been pleasant, I am sure, however,\r\n  to link this annual reunion with the great event of yesterday. It did\r\n  us good to meet with our comrades of the whole State--those who had\r\n  other numbers on their uniforms, but carried the same flag under which\r\n  we marched--in these exercises connected with the dedication of a\r\n  monument that knows no regimental distinction. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  If those having charge now will announce some proper arrangement by\r\n  which I can take by the hand the members, not only of the Seventieth\r\n  Indiana, but any comrades of the First Brigade, who have done us honor\r\n  by meeting with us to-day, I would be glad to conform to their wishes.\r\n  It is perhaps possible that, without leaving the hall, simply by an\r\n  exchange of seats, this may be accomplished, and when that is done\r\n  there may yet be time before dinner to proceed with some other of the\r\n  exercises upon the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, DECEMBER 9, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning, December 9, 1889, President Harrison, accompanied\r\nby Mr. and Mrs. Russell B. Harrison, Mrs. McKee, and First Ass't\r\nPostmaster-General J. S. Clarkson and wife, arrived in Chicago for the\r\npurpose of participating in the dedication of the great Auditorium\r\nbuilding, in which--while in an unfinished state--was held the\r\nconvention of June, 1888, that nominated General Harrison for the\r\npresidency. The distinguished party was met by a committee comprising\r\nMayor D. C. Cregier, Ferd. W. Peck, Gen. Geo. W. Crook, Hon. A. L.\r\nSeeberger, Col. James A. Sexton, Alexander H. Revell, Franklin S.\r\nHead, C. L. Hutchinson, Charles Counselman, J. J. P. Odell, Col. O. A.\r\nSchaffner, F. S. Bissell, and R. W. Dunham.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning the President and Vice-President Morton, under the\r\nguidance of Mr. Ferd. Peck, visited the Board of Trade and were tendered\r\nan enthusiastic reception by the members of that famous exchange. Then\r\nfollowed a reception and lunch at the Union League Club, as the guests\r\nof Mr. Peck and President Bissell of the Club. Other prominent citizens\r\npresent were Governor Fifer, Geo. M. Pullman, Marshall Field, Joseph\r\nMedill, S. M. Nickerson, J. R. Rumsey, N. K. Fairbank, Sam. W. Allerton,\r\nA. A. Sprague, H. H. Kohlsaat, Wm. Penn Nixon, A. L. Patterson, Adolph\r\nCaron, C. I. Peck, A. L. Coe, John R. Walsh, J. W. Scott, John B.\r\nCarson, M. A. Ryerson, V. F. Lawson, and O. W. Meysenberg. Later in the\r\nafternoon the President and Mr. Morton, accompanied by Governor Hoard,\r\nof Wisconsin, General Alger, and Judge Thurston, visited the Marquette\r\nClub--of which the President is an honorary member--and were received by\r\nPresident Revell, Secretary Gould, H. M. Kingman, C. W. Gordon, and C.\r\nE. Nixon, comprising the Reception Committee.\r\n\r\nThe dedication of the auditorium hall in the evening was an event of\r\nrare interest in the history of Chicago. President Harrison and his\r\nparty and Vice-President and Mrs. Morton were the honored guests of\r\nthe occasion. Other distinguished out-of-town guests were Sir Adolph\r\nCaron, Hon. G. A. Kirkpatrick, C. H. McIntosh, and Mr. Wells, of Canada;\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Fifer; Governor and Mrs. Merriam, of Minnesota;\r\nGovernor Hoard, of Wisconsin; Governor and Mrs. Larrabee, of Iowa; Mrs.\r\nGovernor Gordon; ex-Governor Morton, of Nebraska; General Alger, Judge\r\nand Mrs. Walter Q. Gresham; Mr. and Mrs. House, of St. Louis, and Mr.\r\nand Mrs. F. J. Mackey, of Kansas City.\r\n\r\nThe Auditorium--the modern Parthenon--typifying the spirit of the age,\r\nis largely the conception of Mr. Ferd. W. Peck, and its realization is\r\nthe fruit of his zeal, supported and encouraged by the wealthy men of\r\nChicago. The great structure, costing three and a half million dollars,\r\nwas built by the Chicago Auditorium Association, whose officers at the\r\ntime of completion were: Ferd. W. Peck, President; N. K. Fairbank,\r\nFirst Vice-President; John R. Walsh, Second Vice-President; Charles\r\nL. Hutchinson, Treasurer; Charles H. Lunt, Secretary. The building\r\nwas begun June 1, 1887; the laying of the corner-stone occurred in\r\nSeptember that year, and was witnessed by President Cleveland and other\r\ndistinguished visitors. It has a frontage of 710 feet on Congress\r\nStreet, Michigan and Wabash avenues. The exterior material is granite\r\nand Bedford stone. The height of the main structure is 145 feet, or\r\nten stories; height of tower above main building 95 feet, or eight\r\nfloors; height of lantern above main tower 30 feet, or two floors;\r\ntotal height 270 feet--one of the tallest buildings in the world. The\r\npermanent seating capacity of the auditorium is over 4,000, but for\r\nconventions--by utilizing stage--this capacity is increased to 8,000.\r\nA feature of the great hall is the grand organ. In addition to this\r\nunrivalled convention hall the colossal structure contains a recital\r\nhall, 136 stores and offices, a hotel with 400 guest rooms, and a\r\nmagnificent banquet hall 175 feet long.\r\n\r\nThe gathering at the dedicatory exercises nationalized the Auditorium;\r\n15,000 people were within its walls. The President and Mrs. McKee were\r\nthe guests of Mr. and Mrs. Ferd. W. Peck. Among the several thousand\r\nprominent residents present were the following gentlemen and their\r\nfamilies--stockholders in the Auditorium Association: G. E. Adams, A.\r\nC. Bartlett, G. M. Bogue, C. W. Brega, J. W. Doane, J. B. Drake, J.\r\nK. Fisher, Carter H. Harrison, Charles Henrotin, O. R. Keith, G. F.\r\nKimball, S. D. Kimbark, J. T. Lester, W. L. Peck, R. W. Roloson, W.\r\nC. Seipp, Lazarus Silverman, Robert Warren, John Wilkinson, Jr., C.\r\nS. Willoughby, C. T. Yerkes, J. McGregor Adams, W. T. Baker, Gen. J.\r\nC. Black, H. Botsford, R. R. Cable, C. R. Cummings, J. C. Dore, G. L.\r\nDunlap, C. B. Farwell, J. J. Glessner, E. G. Kieth, W. D. Kerfoot, W. W.\r\nKimball, L. Z. Leiter, J. M. Loomis, A. A. Munger, N. B. Ream, Conrad\r\nSeipp, J. G. Shortall, W. Sooy Smith, P. B. Weare, Norman Williams, F.\r\nH. Winston, and J. Otto Young.\r\n\r\nThe exercises opened with an address of welcome by Mayor Cregier,\r\nfollowed by a speech from Mr. Peck, President of the Association, who\r\nreceived an ovation. President Harrison's address was followed by the\r\nrendition of the hymn \"America\" by the Apollo Club of 500 trained\r\nvoices. Hon. John S. Runnells delivered the dedicatory oration. Then\r\ncame the real event of the day--\"Home, Sweet Home\" and the \"Swiss Echo\r\nSong\" by the incomparable songstress Adelina Patti, who shared the\r\nhonors of the occasion with the President. The programme concluded with\r\nan address by Governor Fifer and the grand \"Hallelujah\" chorus from \"The\r\nMessiah.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Peck introduced President Harrison the great assembly\r\nenthusiastically testified its welcome. The President spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--Some of my newspaper friends have been\r\n  puzzling themselves in order to discover the reason why I left\r\n  Washington to be present here to-night. I do not think I need, in view\r\n  of the magnificent spectacle presented to us here to-night, to state\r\n  the motives which have impelled my presence. Surely no loyal citizen\r\n  of Chicago who sits here to-night under this witching and magnificent\r\n  scene will ask for any other reason than that which is here presented.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I do most heartily congratulate you upon the completion and\r\n  inauguration of this magnificent building--without an equal in this\r\n  country, and, so far as I know, without an equal in the world.\r\n  [Applause.] We have here about us to-night in this grand architecture,\r\n  in this tasteful decoration, that which is an education and an\r\n  inspiration. [Applause.] It might well tempt one whose surroundings\r\n  were much farther removed from this scene than is the capital city\r\n  to make a longer journey than I have done to stand for an hour\r\n  in the view of such a spectacle of magnificence and grandeur and\r\n  architectural triumph as this. [Applause.] And if that be true,\r\n  surely there is reason enough why the President may turn aside for a\r\n  little while from public duty to mingle with his fellow-citizens in\r\n  celebrating an event so high and so worthy of commemoration as this\r\n  triumph to-night. [Prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\n  Not speech, certainly, not the careless words of an extemporaneous\r\n  speech, can adequately express all the sentiments I feel in\r\n  contemplating the fitting culmination of this deed. [Applause.] Only\r\n  the voice of the immortal singer can bring from these arches those\r\n  echoes which will tell us the true purpose of their construction.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  You will permit me, then, to thank you, to thank the Mayor of\r\n  Chicago, to thank the President of this Association, and to thank all\r\n  those good citizens with whom I have to-day been brought in personal\r\n  contact, for the kindness and respect with which you and they have\r\n  received me; and you will permit me to thank you, my fellow-citizens,\r\n  for the cordiality which you have kindly displayed here to-night.\r\n\r\n  It is my wish, and may it be the wish of all, that this great\r\n  building may continue to be to all your population that which it\r\n  should be--an edifice opening its doors from night to night, calling\r\n  your people here away from the care of business to those enjoyments,\r\n  and pursuits, and entertainments which develop the souls of men\r\n  [applause], which will have power to inspire those whose lives are\r\n  heavy with daily toil, and in its magnificent and enchanting presence\r\n  lift them for a time out of these dull things into those higher things\r\n  where men should live. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND, OHIO, MAY 30, 1890.\r\n\r\n_Garfield Memorial Dedication._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Decoration Day, 1890, President Harrison and Vice-President Morton,\r\naccompanied by Secretary Windom, Postmaster-General Wanamaker,\r\nAttorney-General Miller, Secretary of Agriculture Rusk, and Marshal\r\nDaniel M. Ransdell, visited the city of Cleveland for the purpose of\r\nparticipating in the dedication of the grand mausoleum erected to the\r\nmemory of the lamented President James Abram Garfield. Fifty thousand\r\npeople greeted the President and his party on arrival.\r\n\r\nThe mausoleum is situated in Lake View Cemetery, overlooking a region\r\nclosely associated with Garfield's memory; it is built of Ohio\r\nsandstone--a large and imposing circular tower 50 feet in diameter,\r\nrising 180 feet. At the base projects a square porch, decorated\r\nexternally with an historical frieze, divided into panels containing\r\nlife-size bas-reliefs picturing the career of Garfield as teacher,\r\nstatesman, soldier, and President. This imposing monument was erected\r\nunder the auspices of the Garfield National Memorial Association, whose\r\nofficers were: Rutherford B. Hayes, President; J. H. Wade and T.

Bole, Dan'l P. Eells, H. R. Hatch,\r\nJohn F. Pankhurst, John Tod, and George P. Welch.\r\n\r\nThe event called together one of the most distinguished assemblies of\r\nthe decade. Among the guests not previously mentioned--who occupied\r\nplaces of honor--were Gen. William T. Sherman, Chief-Justice Melville\r\nW. Fuller, Maj.-Gen. John M. Schofield, ex-Postmaster-General Thomas L.\r\nJames, Gov. James E. Campbell, Lieutenant-Governor Marquis, Hon. William\r\nMcKinley, Jr., Bishop William A. Leonard, Bishop Gilmour, Col. Wm. Perry\r\nFogg, and many others. Mrs. Garfield was accompanied by her four sons,\r\nher daughter, and General and Mrs. John Newell.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular event of the day was the grand military and civic\r\nparade, participated in by President Harrison and the other guests.\r\nSix thousand men were in line, commanded by Chief Marshal Gen. James\r\nBarnett and a brilliant staff. At the head of the great column marched\r\n115 survivors of Garfield's old regiment--the Forty-second Ohio--led by\r\nCapt. C. E. Henry, of Dallas, Texas, the Colonel, Judge Don A. Pardee,\r\nbeing absent. The procession comprised twelve divisions, commanded by\r\nthe following marshals: Capt. J. B. Molyneaux, Gen. M. D. Leggett, Col.\r\nW. H. Hayward, Em. Sir M. J. Houck, Col. Louis Black, Col. John Dunn,\r\nCapt. E. H. Bohm, Captain McNiel, Capt. Louis Perczel, Col. Allen T.\r\nBrinsmade, Col. C. L. Alderson, and Capt. M. G. Browne.\r\n\r\nEx-President Hayes officiated as Chairman of the dedicatory meeting\r\nat the mausoleum, and introduced Hon. Jacob D. Cox, of Cincinnati,\r\nwho delivered the oration of the occasion. Many other distinguished\r\nmen spoke briefly. When the Chairman introduced President Harrison an\r\novation was tendered him, and almost every sentence of his address was\r\nenthusiastically cheered.\r\n\r\nThe President spoke with great earnestness. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and Fellow-citizens_--I thank you most sincerely\r\n  for this cordial greeting, but I shall not be betrayed by it into a\r\n  lengthy speech. The selection of this day for these exercises--a day\r\n  consecrated to the memory of those who died that there might be one\r\n  flag of honor and authority in this republic--is most fitting. That\r\n  one flag encircles us with its folds to-day, the unrivalled object of\r\n  our loyal love.\r\n\r\n  This monument, so imposing and tasteful, fittingly typifies the\r\n  grand and symmetrical character of him in whose honor it has been\r\n  builded. His was \"the arduous greatness of things done.\" No friendly\r\n  hands constructed and placed for his ambition a ladder upon which\r\n  he might climb. His own brave hands framed and nailed the cleats\r\n  upon which he climbed to the heights of public usefulness and fame.\r\n  He never ceased to be student and instructor. Turning from peaceful\r\n  pursuits to army service, he quickly mastered tactics and strategy,\r\n  and in a brief army career taught some valuable lessons in military\r\n  science. Turning again from the field to the councils of state, he\r\n  stood among the great debaters that have made our National Congress\r\n  illustrious. What he might have been or done as President of the\r\n  United States is chiefly left to friendly augury, based upon a career\r\n  that had no incident of failure or inadequacy. The cruel circumstances\r\n  attending his death had but one amelioration--that space of life was\r\n  given him to teach from his dying bed a great lesson of patience and\r\n  forbearance. His mortal part will find honorable rest here, but the\r\n  lessons of his life and death will continue to be instructive and\r\n  inspiring incidents in American history. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON, AUGUST 11, 1890.\r\n\r\n_The Guest of Massachusetts._\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday afternoon, August 11, the cruiser _Baltimore_, bearing President\r\nHarrison, Secretary Rusk, Secretary Noble, and a number of friends,\r\nentered Boston harbor, saluted by the _Atlanta_, the _Kearsage_,\r\nthe _Petrel_, the _Yorktown_, the _Dolphin_, the dynamite cruiser\r\n_Vesuvius_, and the torpedo-boat _Cushing_.

Charles L.\r\nTaylor acted as toastmaster and presented General Harrison, who received\r\nan ovation.\r\n\r\nIn response to these cordial greetings the President said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades_--I do not count it the least of those fortunate\r\n  circumstances which have occasionally appeared in my life that I am\r\n  able to be here to-night to address you as comrades of the Grand Army\r\n  of the United States. [Great applause.] It is an association great\r\n  in its achievement and altogether worthy of perpetuation until the\r\n  last of its members have fallen into an honorable grave. It is not my\r\n  purpose to-night to address you in an extended speech, but only to say\r\n  that, whether walking with you in the private pursuits of life, or\r\n  holding a place of official responsibility, I can never, in either,\r\n  forget those who upheld the flag of this Nation in those days when\r\n  it was in peril. Everything that was worthy of preservation in our\r\n  history past, everything that is glowing and glorious in the future,\r\n  which we confront, turned upon the issue of that strife in which you\r\n  were engaged. Will you permit me to wish for each of you a life full\r\n  of all sweetness, and that each of you may preserve, undimmed, the\r\n  love for the flag which called you from your homes to stand under its\r\n  folds amid the shock of battle and amid dying men. I believe there are\r\n  indications to-day in this country of a revived love for the flag.\r\n  [Applause.] I could wish that no American citizen would look upon it\r\n  without saluting it. [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON, AUGUST 12.\r\n\r\n_G. A. R. National Encampment._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of August 12 the President and the several members of his\r\nCabinet, with Vice-President Morton, Governor Brackett, Mayor Hart,\r\nGeneral Sherman, Governor Dillingham and staff, of Vermont; Governor\r\nDavis, of Rhode Island; Hon. William McKinley, Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge,\r\nMrs. John A. Logan, Mrs. R. A. Alger, Mrs. McKee, Mrs. A. L. Coolidge,\r\nand Lillian Nordica, the _prima donna_, reviewed the grand parade of the\r\nveterans from a stand in Copley Square. As the head of the great column\r\nappeared, led by Commander-in-Chief R. A. Alger, with mounted staff\r\nand escort numbering 600 officers, the President and his Cabinet arose\r\nand saluted the veterans. General Alger and Gen. B. F. Butler reviewed\r\nthe column from a stand in Adams Square. The parade was five hours and\r\nthirty-five minutes in passing.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Mayor's Club of Boston tendered a banquet to\r\nPresident Harrison and other distinguished visitors. Mayor Fisher, of\r\nWaltham, introduced the Chief Executive, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman_--I wish only to thank you for this cordial welcome.\r\n  Being upon my feet, I cannot refrain from expressing here my deep\r\n  sense of gratitude for all the evidences of friendliness which have\r\n  been shown me during my brief stay in Boston. The President of the\r\n  United States, whosoever he may have been, from the first to the last,\r\n  has always found in the citizenship of Massachusetts stanch supporters\r\n  of the Union's Constitution. [Applause.] It has never occurred that he\r\n  has called upon this great commonwealth for support that it has not\r\n  been cordially and bravely rendered. In this magnificent parade which\r\n  we have seen to-day of the survivors of the Massachusetts regiments\r\n  in the war for the Union, and in this magnificent parade of the Sons\r\n  of Veterans, coming on now to take the fathers' place in civil life\r\n  and to stand as they were in their day as bulwarks of the Nation's\r\n  defence, we have seen a magnificent evidence of what Massachusetts has\r\n  done in defence of the Union and of the flag, and in these young men\r\n  sure promise of what she would do again if the exigencies should call\r\n  upon her to give her blood in a similar cause. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Let me again cordially thank you for your interest and friendliness\r\n  and to bid you good-night, and, as I must leave you to-night for\r\n  Washington, to hope that the closing exercises of this grand and\r\n  instructive week may be pleasant, and as the outcome of it all that\r\n  there may be kindled in the hearts of you all, and of these comrades\r\n  of the Grand Army of the Republic, a newer love for the flag and for\r\n  the Constitution, and that this may all inure to us in social, family,\r\n  and public life. [Applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\nQuitting the Mayor's banquet, the President and members of the Cabinet,\r\nwith Admiral Gherardi and staff, proceeded to Mechanics' Hall,\r\nwhere a joint reception of the Grand Army and Woman's Relief Corps\r\nwas in progress. At least 15,000 people greeted the arrival of the\r\ndistinguished visitors. On the platform with the President's party were\r\nMiss Florence Barker, first President Woman's Relief Corps; Mrs. Annie\r\nWittenmyer, National President; Miss Clara Barton, President Red Cross\r\nAssociation; Mrs. Mary E. Knowles, Massachusetts Department President;\r\nMrs. Cheney, National Secretary; Mrs. Lynch, National Treasurer; Mrs.\r\nNichols, National Inspector of the Relief Corps; Department Commander\r\nT. S. Clarkson, Nebraska; Department Commander P. H. Darling, Ohio;\r\nGovernor Brackett and Congressman McKinley. George H. Innis, Commander\r\nMassachusetts Department, welcomed the visiting comrades. Other speakers\r\nwere General Sherman, Commander-in-Chief Alger, and Vice-President\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison was introduced as Comrade Harrison, President of the\r\nUnited States, and was greeted with tremendous applause. He spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and Comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic_--I\r\n  had impressions both pleasurable and painful as I looked upon the\r\n  great procession of veterans which swept through the streets of this\r\n  historic capital to-day; pleasurable in the contemplation of so\r\n  many faces of those who shared together the perils and glories of\r\n  the great struggle for the Union; sensations of a mournful sort as\r\n  I thought how seldom we should meet again. Not many times more here.\r\n  As I have stood in the great national cemetery at Arlington and have\r\n  seen those silent battalions of the dead, I have thought how swiftly\r\n  the reaper is doing his work and how soon in the scattered cemeteries\r\n  of the land the ashes of all the soldiers of the great war shall be\r\n  gathered to honored graves. And yet I could not help but feel that\r\n  in the sturdy tread of those battalions there was yet strength of\r\n  heart and limb that would not be withheld if a present peril should\r\n  confront the Nation that you love. [Applause.] And if Arlington is\r\n  the death, we see to-day in the springing step of those magnificent\r\n  battalions of the Sons of Veterans the resurrection. [Applause.] They\r\n  are coming on to take our places, the Nation will not be defenceless\r\n  when we are gone, but those who have read about the firesides of the\r\n  veterans' homes, in which they have been born and reared, the lessons\r\n  of patriotism and the stories of heroism will come fresh armed to any\r\n  conflict that may confront us in the future. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  And so to-night we may gather from this magnificent spectacle a\r\n  fresh and strong sense of security for the permanency of our country\r\n  and our free institutions. I thought it altogether proper that I\r\n  should take a brief furlough from official duties at Washington to\r\n  mingle with you here to-day as a comrade [applause], because every\r\n  President of the United States must realize that the strength of the\r\n  Government, its defence in war, the army that is to muster under its\r\n  banner when our Nation is assailed, is to be found here in the masses\r\n  of our people. [Applause and cries of \"Good!\"] And so, as my furlough\r\n  is almost done, and the train is already waiting that must bear me\r\n  back to Washington, I can only express again the cordial, sincere,\r\n  and fraternal interest which I feel this day in meeting you all. I\r\n  can only hope that God will so order the years that are left to you\r\n  that for you and those who are dear to you they may be ordered in all\r\n  gentleness and sweetness, in all prosperity and success, and that,\r\n  when at last the comrades who survive you shall wrap the flag of the\r\n  Union about your body and bear it to the grave, you may die in peace\r\n  and in the hope of a glorious resurrection! [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRESSON, PENNSYLVANIA, SEPTEMBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly 1,000 veterans from the several G. A. R. posts of Altoona,\r\nTyronne, and Holidaysburg visited Cresson on September 13, 1890, for\r\nthe purpose of paying their respects to President Harrison. General\r\nEkin and Col. Theo.

The President\r\nreceived the veterans at the Mountain House. After the reception J. D.\r\nHicks delivered a congratulatory address on behalf of the veterans.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, speaking from the balcony of the hotel, warmly thanked\r\nhis comrades for their good wishes, and in mentioning the events of\r\nthe war referred feelingly to the tragic death of the great Lincoln\r\nand the memorable words of Garfield on that occasion. His reference to\r\nthe Constitution and the flag, and the love of the people for them,\r\nelicited a hearty response. He concluded as follows: \"Now, my comrades,\r\nwho have suffered and still suffer for your country, I wish in this\r\nworld all good to you and your dear ones, and in the world to come joy\r\neverlasting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCEOLA, PENNSYLVANIA, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of the President and his family at Cresson Springs\r\nin September, 1890, they made an excursion through the celebrated\r\nClearfield coal regions, under the guidance of Frank L. Sheppard,\r\nGeneral Superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Geo. W. Boyd, Ass't\r\nGen'l Passenger Agent, Gen. D. H. Hastings, and S. S. Blair.

Dill, of Clearfield, and F. N.\r\nBarksdale.\r\n\r\nThe first point visited was Osceola, where 5,000 people tendered the\r\nPresident a rousing reception. The Committee of Reception were Geo. M.\r\nBrisbin, D. R. Good, R. J. Walker, T. C. Heims, and J. R. Paisley. The\r\nveterans of McLarren Post, G. A. R., acted as an escort through the town\r\nfrom one depot to the other. The President briefly thanked the veterans\r\nand citizens for extending him such a cordial reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUTZDALE, PENNSYLVANIA, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived at Houtzdale, about noon Saturday, the President and his party\r\nwere welcomed by an assemblage numbering fully 10,000. They were met at\r\nOsceola by an escort committee consisting of G. W. Dickey, Abe Feldman,\r\nJulius Viebahn, Thos. Rolands, B. W. Hess, W. E. Meek, W. C. Davis, W.\r\nB. Hamilton, J. V. Henderson, J. B. McGrath, James White, D. W. Smith,\r\nJohn Charlton, W. H. Patterson, and Thomas Byers.\r\n\r\nAll work in the mines and stores was suspended for the day, and the\r\nvisit of the Chief Magistrate was celebrated with a grand parade and\r\ndemonstration directed by Chief Burgess John Argyle, aided by the G. A.\r\nR. veterans. The President was received by the following committee of\r\nprominent citizens: W. Irvin Shaw, Esq., of the Clearfield County Bar;\r\nW. C. Langsford, Alex. Monteith, John F. Farrell, Geo. P. Jones, Joseph\r\nDelehunt, Harry Roach, Ad. Hanson, S. T. Henderson, R. R. Fleming, and\r\nE. J. Duffy. The veterans of Wm. H. Kinkead Post acted as a guard of\r\nhonor to the President during the parade.\r\n\r\nA notable incident of the demonstration was the reception by the\r\nchildren of the parochial school. After the parade the formal reception\r\nof the distinguished visitors took place in the presence of the great\r\nassemblage. John F. Farrell presided, and introduced Chairman W. I.\r\nShaw, who delivered an eloquent address of welcome on behalf of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I beg to assure you that I very highly\r\n  appreciate your cordial welcome. I did not need the assurance of\r\n  him who has spoken in your name that we are welcome in this home of\r\n  profit and industry. As I have passed along the streets, and as I\r\n  now look into your eyes, I have read welcome in every face. I do not\r\n  regard this greeting as personal. How can it be, since you look into\r\n  my face as I into yours for the first time? I assume that in this\r\n  demonstration you are evidencing your loyalty and fidelity to the\r\n  Government of which we are all citizens.\r\n\r\n  You welcome me as one who, for the time being by your choice, is\r\n  charged with the execution of the law. It is a great thing to be a\r\n  citizen of this country, and the privilege has its corresponding\r\n  obligations. This Government can never be wrecked by the treason or\r\n  fault of those who for the time are placed in public position so\r\n  long as the people are true to the principles of the Government and\r\n  to the flag. [Applause.] Set your love upon the flag and that which\r\n  it represents. Be ready, if occasion should call, to defend it, as\r\n  my brave comrades did in the time of its greatest peril. Honor it\r\n  in peace, cherish your loyal institutions, civil and educational;\r\n  maintain social order in your community, let every one have respect\r\n  for the rights and privileges of others while asserting his own.\r\n\r\n  These are the springs of our national and social life. If these\r\n  springs are kept pure and strong the great river they form will ever\r\n  flow on in purity and majesty. If local interests are carefully\r\n  preserved the general good is secured, and all our people, each in his\r\n  own place--the place where he labors, the place where he lives, the\r\n  roof under which his family is sheltered--will continue to enjoy the\r\n  benison of liberty in the fear of God.\r\n\r\n  To every one of you, those who come from the village shops, those\r\n  who come from the mines and every vocation of life to join in this\r\n  welcome, let me declare that I have no other purpose as President of\r\n  the United States than to so administer my office as to promote the\r\n  general good of all our people. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA, SEPTEMBER 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther points visited were Clearfield, where the veterans of Lamar\r\nPost and Colonel Barrett at the head of a committee received the\r\ndistinguished excursionists.

Irwin, Dr. T. B. Potter, Capt. J. H. Boring, M. G. Lewis, Henry\r\nLehman, H. K. Grant, Al. Jones, W. T. Bair, Geo. W. Wythes, A. B. Herd,\r\nJohn Nuttall, and A. J. Graham. The President and Mrs. Harrison were\r\ndriven through the city, which was elaborately decorated.\r\n\r\nReturning to the station Mayor Warfel introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Citizens of Philipsburg_--I thank you for this very cordial\r\n  expression of your esteem. You must excuse my not addressing you at\r\n  any length because of the very limited time at our disposal. I again\r\n  thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN TOUR, OCTOBER, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 6, 1890, President Harrison left Washington\r\nto attend the reunion of the First Brigade, Twentieth Army Corps,\r\nat Galesburg, Ill., and to visit points in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri,\r\nand Indiana. He was accompanied by Secretary Tracy, Gen. Charles H.\r\nGrosvenor, Private Secretary Halford, Marshal Daniel M. Ransdell, Capt.\r\nWm. M. Meredith, Gen. T. J. Morgan, and E. F. Tibbott, stenographer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIFTON FORGE, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trip through Virginia was uneventful. At Staunton the President was\r\nserenaded, and among those who met him were ex-Congressman Desendorf, of\r\nVirginia, and David Stewart, of Indianapolis. Clifton Forge was reached\r\nat twilight, and nearly 1,000 residents heartily cheered the President\r\nand called for a speech. In response he said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I hope you will excuse me from making a speech. I have\r\n  travelled for the first time over the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad,\r\n  and I have noticed with great interest and pleasure the development\r\n  which is being made along the road of the mineral resources of the\r\n  State of Virginia. What I have seen moves me to offer my sincere\r\n  congratulations on what you have already accomplished, and what is\r\n  surely in store for you if you but make use of your resources and\r\n  opportunities. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWRENCEBURG, INDIANA, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Cincinnati, Tuesday morning, the party was joined by Archibald Eaton,\r\nthe President's nephew; Col. W. B. Shattuc, Col. John C. New, and a\r\ncommittee of escort from Lawrenceburg, comprising Gen. Thomas J. Lucas,\r\nArchibald Shaw, John O. Cravens, John K. Thompson, and Valentine J.\r\nKoehler. Near North Bend, Ohio, the old Harrison homestead was reached,\r\nand the train came to a stop just abreast the house in which Benjamin\r\nHarrison was born, and but a few yards from the white shaft that marks\r\nthe tomb of his illustrious ancestor, President William Henry Harrison.\r\nThe occasion was not for words, and as the President passed to the rear\r\nplatform he was unaccompanied by the rest of the party, who left him to\r\nthe memories that the scenes of his childhood and youth called forth.\r\n\r\nArrived at Lawrenceburg the President was visibly affected at meeting\r\nmany old friends and neighbors of years ago. Among the leading citizens\r\nwho welcomed him were: John Isherwood, Z. Heustes, Peter Braun, Dr. J.\r\nD. Gatch, Frank R. Dorman, D. W. C. Fitch, J. H. Burkham, W. H. Rucker,\r\nWm. Probasco, Louis Adler, H. G. Kidd, John S. Dorman, John B. Garnier,\r\nA. D. Cook, Chas. Decker, John F. Cook, Dr. T. C. Craig, C. J. B. Ragin,\r\nJ. E. Larimer, D. E. Sparks, and Capt. John Shaw; also, M. C. Garber, of\r\nMadison, Robert Cain, of Brookville, and Alfred Shaw, of Vevay, Ind.\r\n\r\nThe President addressed the large assembly in a voice heavy with\r\nemotion. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I want to thank you very cordially for this greeting.\r\n  All the scenes about here are very familiar to me. This town of\r\n  Lawrenceburg is the first village of my childish recollections,\r\n  and as I approached it this morning, past the earliest home of my\r\n  recollections, the home in which my childhood and early manhood were\r\n  spent, memories crowded in upon me that were very full of interest,\r\n  very full of pleasure, and yet full of sadness. They bring back to me\r\n  those who once made the old home very dear, the most precious spot\r\n  on earth. I have passed with bowed head the place where they rest.\r\n  We are here in our generation, with the work of those who have gone\r\n  before upon us. Let us see, each of us, that in the family, in the\r\n  neighborhood, and in the State, we do at least with equal courage,\r\n  and grace, and kindness, the work which was so bravely, kindly, and\r\n  graciously done by those who filled our places fifty years ago. Now,\r\n  for I must hurry on, to these old friends, and to these new friends\r\n  who have come in since Lawrenceburg was familiar to me, I extend again\r\n  my hearty thanks for this welcome, and beg, in parting, to introduce\r\n  the only member of my Cabinet who accompanies me, General Tracy,\r\n  Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH VERNON, INDIANA, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt North Vernon, Jennings County, many old acquaintances greeted the\r\nPresident, among them J. C. Cope, John Fable, P. C. McGannon, and\r\nothers. Acknowledging the repeated cheers of the assembly, the President\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very glad to see you, and very much obliged to\r\n  you for your pleasurable greeting. It is always a pleasure to see my\r\n  old Indiana friends. We have had this morning a delightful ride across\r\n  the southern part of the State, one that has given me a great deal of\r\n  refreshment and pleasure. [Cheers.] Let me again assure you that I am\r\n  very much obliged to you for this evidence of your friendship. I hope\r\n  you will excuse me from further speech on this occasion. It gives me\r\n  pleasure now, my fellow-citizens, to introduce to you General Tracy,\r\n  of New York, the Secretary of the Navy, who accompanies me on this\r\n  trip. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEYMOUR, INDIANA, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Seymour, Jackson County, 2,000 citizens gave evidence of General\r\nHarrison's popularity in that town. Among the prominent residents who\r\nwelcomed him were Hon. W. K. Marshall, Louis Schneck, Travis Carter, Ph.\r\nWilhelm, W. F. Peters, J. B. Morrison, R. F. White, S. E. Carter, John\r\nA. Ross, John A. Weaver, L. M. Mains, John A. Goodale, Theo. B. Ridlen,\r\nand V. H. Monroe.\r\n\r\nAfter he had introduced Secretary Tracy, the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I feel that I ought to thank you for your friendly\r\n  greeting this beautiful morning. It is a pleasure indeed to me to\r\n  greet so many of you. Again I thank you for this welcome. A request\r\n  has just been handed me that I speak a few minutes to the school\r\n  children here assembled. I scarcely know what to say to them, except\r\n  that I have a great interest in them, and the country has a great\r\n  interest in them. Those who, like myself, have passed the meridian\r\n  of life realize more than younger men that the places we now hold\r\n  and the responsibilities we now carry in society and in all social\r\n  and business relations must devolve upon those who are now in the\r\n  school. Our State has magnificently provided for their education, so\r\n  that none of them need be ignorant, and I am sure that in these happy\r\n  homes the fathers and mothers are not neglecting their duties, but are\r\n  instilling into these young minds morality and respect for the law\r\n  which must crown intelligence in order to make them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOALS, INDIANA, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Shoals, the county seat of Martin County, gave the\r\nPresident a most cordial reception. Prominent among those friends who\r\nwelcomed him were R. E. Hunt, J. A. Chenoweth, J. P. Albaugh, J. B.\r\nFreeman, J. T. Rogers, M. Shirey, S. P. Yeune, H. Q. Houghton, James\r\nMahany, C. H. Mohr, S. N. Gwin, F. J. Masten, C. S. Dobbins, and N. H.\r\nMatsinger.\r\n\r\nResponding to their cheers and calls the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I am very glad to see you. My trip this\r\n  morning is more like a holiday than I have had for a long time. I am\r\n  glad to see the cordiality of your welcome. It makes me feel that I am\r\n  still held somewhat in the esteem of the people whose friendship I so\r\n  very much covet and desire to retain. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSULLIVAN, INDIANA, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable surprise to the President to find several thousand\r\npeople awaiting an opportunity to greet him at the town of Sullivan. Of\r\nprominent townsmen there were present J. H. Clugage, G. W. Buff, Rob't\r\nH. Crowder, John T. Hays, C. P. Lacey, C. F. Briggs, O. H. Crowder, S.\r\nGoodman, R. B. Mason, W. A. Bell, Joseph Hayden, John H. Dickerson, and\r\nR. F. Knotts.\r\n\r\nIn answer to repeated calls for a speech the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--Some of you have requested that I would give you a\r\n  little talk. The range of things that I can say on an occasion like\r\n  this is very limited, but one thing, though it seems to involve\r\n  repetition, I can say to you very heartily and very sincerely: I am\r\n  very glad to again look into the faces of my Indiana friends. I trust\r\n  I have friends that are not in Indiana, but my earliest and my best\r\n  are here. Again I thank you. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRE HAUTE, INDIANA, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal demonstration of the day was at Terre Haute, where fully\r\n10,000 people greeted the President. The following Reception Committee\r\nescorted the party from Vincennes: Hon. W. R. McKeen, H. Hulman, Sr.,\r\nJudge C. F. McNutt, George W. Faris, Samuel Huston, A. Herz, W. C.\r\nIsbell, R. A. Campbell, Dr. Rob't Van Valzah, Jacob D. Early, George\r\nE. Pugh, A. G. Austin, F. E. Benjamin, and B. G. Hudnut. _En route_ to\r\nthe speaker's stand every bell and steam whistle in the city added its\r\ntribute to the enthusiasm of the occasion. This unique Hoosier welcome\r\nwas arranged by D. C. Greiner. Other leading citizens participating\r\nprominently in the reception were: D. W. Minshall, N. Filbeck, Judge B.\r\nE. Rhoades, S. C. Beach, J. S. Tally, Senator Bischawsky, G. W. Bement,\r\nJay Cummings, Geo. M. Allen, and P. S. Westfall.\r\n\r\nMayor Frank C. Danaldson made the welcoming address, and concluded by\r\nintroducing President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, Fellow-citizens of Indiana, Ladies and Gentlemen_--I\r\n  very heartily appreciate this large gathering assembled to greet me.\r\n  I very heartily appreciate the welcome which your kind and animated\r\n  faces, as well as the spoken words of the chief officer of your city,\r\n  have extended to me. I have known this pretty city for more than\r\n  thirty years, and have watched its progress and growth. It has always\r\n  been the home of some of my most cherished personal friends, and I am\r\n  glad to know that your city is in an increasing degree prosperous,\r\n  and your people contented and happy. I am glad to know that the local\r\n  industries which have been established in your midst are to-day busy\r\n  in producing their varied products, and that these find a ready market\r\n  at remunerative prices. I was told as we approached your city that\r\n  there was not an idle wheel in Terre Haute. It is very pleasant to\r\n  know that this prosperity is so generally shared by all our people.\r\n  Hopefulness, and cheer, and courage tend to bring and maintain good\r\n  times.\r\n\r\n  We differ widely in our views of public politics, but I trust every\r\n  one of us is devoted to the flag which represents the unity and\r\n  power of our country and to the best interests of the people, as we\r\n  are given to see and understand those interests. [Applause.] We are\r\n  in the enjoyment of the most perfect system of government that has\r\n  ever been devised for the use of men. We are under fewer restraints;\r\n  the individual faculties and liberties have wider range here than in\r\n  any other land. Here a sky of hope is arched over the head of every\r\n  ambitious, industrious, and aspiring young man. There are no social\r\n  conditions; there are no unneeded legal restrictions. Let us continue\r\n  to cherish these institutions and to maintain them in their best\r\n  development. Let us see that as far as our influence can bring it to\r\n  pass they are conducted for the general good. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It gives me pleasure to bring into your city to-day one who is the\r\n  successor as the head of the Navy Department of that distinguished\r\n  citizen of Indiana who is especially revered and loved by all the\r\n  people of Terre Haute, but is also embraced in the wider love of all\r\n  the citizens of Indiana--Col. Richard W. Thompson. Let me present to\r\n  you Gen. Benjamin F. Tracy, of New York, the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANVILLE, ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nDanville was reached at 6 P.M. The roar of cannon sounded a hearty\r\nwelcome to the Prairie State. Fully 10,000 people were assembled around\r\nthe pavilion erected near the station. Among the prominent residents who\r\nreceived the President on the part of the citizens were: Hon. Joseph G.\r\nCannon, Mayor W. R. Lawrence, Justice J. W. Wilkin, of the Supreme Court\r\nof Illinois, Col. Samuel Stansbury, H. P. Blackburn, W. R. Jewell, M. J.\r\nBarger, W. C. Tuttle, Henry Brand, and Capt. J. G. Hull.\r\n\r\nCongressman Cannon introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I regret that the time of our arrival and the\r\n  brief time we can give you should make it so inconvenient for you\r\n  who have assembled here to greet us. Yet, though the darkness shuts\r\n  out your faces, I cannot omit to acknowledge with the most heartfelt\r\n  gratitude the enthusiastic greeting of this large assembly of my\r\n  fellow-citizens. It is quite worth while, I think, for those who are\r\n  charged with great public affairs now and then to turn aside from\r\n  the routine of official duties to look into the faces of the people.\r\n  [Applause.] It is well enough that all public officers should be\r\n  reminded that under our republican institutions the repository of\r\n  all power, the originator of all policy, is the people of the United\r\n  States. [Great applause.] I have had the pleasure of visiting this\r\n  rich and prosperous section of your great State before, and am glad\r\n  to notice that, if the last year has not yielded an average return to\r\n  your farms, already the promise of the coming year is seen in your\r\n  well-tilled fields. Let me thank you again and bid you good-night.\r\n  [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Urbana, Ill., Secretary Tracy addressed several thousand residents.\r\nAt Champaign the citizens were attended by the students of the\r\nUniversity of Illinois, who received the President with their college\r\ncheer. Among the leading citizens who participated in welcoming the\r\nChief Executive were Dr. L. S. Wilcox, John W. Spalding, F. K. Robinson,\r\nP. W. Woody, H. H. Harris, J. L. Ray, T. J. Smith, H. Swannell, Ozias\r\nRiley, A. P. Cunningham, J. B. Harris, Edward Bailey, Solon Philbrick,\r\nC. J. Sabin, W. S. Maxwell, L. W. Faulkner, J. W. Mulliken, Judge C.\r\nB. Smith, W. P. Lockwood, W. A. Heath, Geo. F. Beardsley, Hon. Abel\r\nHarwood, W. H. Munhall, A. W. Spalding, and C. M. Sherfey.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Good Friends_--It is very evident that there is a large\r\n  representation here of the Greek societies. [Cheers.] I thank you\r\n  for this greeting. We are on our way to Galesburg to unite with\r\n  my old comrades in arms of the First Brigade, Third Division,\r\n  Twentieth Army Corps, in a reunion. I had not expected here, or at\r\n  any other intermediate point on the journey, to make addresses, but\r\n  I cannot fail to thank these young gentlemen from the University of\r\n  Illinois for the interest their presence gives to this meeting. Your\r\n  professors, no doubt, give you all needed admonition and advice,\r\n  and you will, I am sure, thank me for not adding to your burdens.\r\n  Good-night. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEORIA, ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third day of the President's journey found him in Peoria, where\r\nhe was warmly welcomed by Mayor Charles C. Clarke at the head of the\r\nfollowing committee of prominent citizens: Alexander G. Tyng, Jr.,\r\nPresident Board of Trade; John D. Soules, President Travelling Men's\r\nAssociation; editor Eugene Baldwin, and Hon. Julius S. Starr. Miss Elsie\r\nLeslie Lyde, the child actress, on behalf of the citizens and the Grand\r\nArmy, presented the President with a beautiful bouquet, which the Chief\r\nMagistrate acknowledged by kissing the little orator in the presence of\r\nthe great assemblage.\r\n\r\nMayor Clarke introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is not possible that I should introduce\r\n  this morning any serious theme. I have greatly enjoyed this trip\r\n  through my own State and yours, sisters in loyalty and sacrifice for\r\n  the Union, sisters also in prosperity and honor. I find myself simply\r\n  saying thank you, but with an increasing sense of the kindness of the\r\n  people. If anything could add to the solemn sense of responsibility\r\n  which my official oath places upon me, it would be these evidences\r\n  of friendliness and confidence. The great mass of the people of this\r\n  country are loyal, loving, dutiful citizens, ready to support every\r\n  faithful officer in the discharge of his duties and to applaud every\r\n  honest effort for their good. It is a source of great strength to know\r\n  this, and this morning, not less from this bright sunshine and this\r\n  crisp Illinois air than from these kindly faces, I draw an inspiration\r\n  to do what I can, the very best I can, to promote the good of the\r\n  people of the United States. I go to-day to meet with some comrades\r\n  of your State who stood with me in the army of the great Union for\r\n  the defence of the flag. I beg now to thank these comrades of Peoria\r\n  and this company of National Guards and all these friends, and you,\r\n  Mr. Mayor and gentlemen of the Reception Committee, for this kindly\r\n  greeting, and to say that I have great satisfaction in knowing the\r\n  people of this community are very prosperous. May that prosperity\r\n  increase until every citizen, even the humblest, shares it. May peace,\r\n  social order, and the blessing of God abide in every house is my\r\n  parting wish for you. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGALESBURG, ILLINOIS, OCTOBER 8.\r\n\r\n_The Public Reception._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the trip from Peoria the President and Secretary Tracy rode a\r\ngoodly portion of the distance on the locomotive with Engineer Frank\r\nHilton, a veteran who served in the President's old command. Galesburg,\r\nthe principal objective point of the journey, was reached at noon on\r\nOctober 8, where 10,000 patriotic citizens greeted their arrival. Mayor\r\nLoren Stevens, at the head of the following committee, received and\r\nwelcomed the President: Forrest F. Cooke, President of the Day, Judge\r\nA. A. Smith, Hon. H. M. Sisson, Hon. O. F. Price, Maj. H. H. Clay, Z.\r\nBeatty, Henry Emerich, James M. Ayres, Francis A. Free, Gersh Martin, F.\r\nC. Rice, C. D. Hendryx, Gen. F. C. Smith, John Bassett, R. W. Sweeney,\r\nSam'l D. Harsh, Colonel Phelps, Hon. Philip S. Post, Rev. John Hood,\r\nRev. G. J. Luckey, H. A. Drake, Matthias O'Brien, K. Johnson, C. P.\r\nCurtis, H. C. Miles, Capt. E. O. Atchinson, and Mr. Weeks. Fully 2,000\r\nveterans participated in the parade; also the local militia, commanded\r\nby Captain Elder and Lieutenants Ridgley and Tompkins; Company D,\r\nFifth Regiment, from Quincy, Capt. F. B. Nichols, Lieutenants Treet\r\nand Whipple; Company H, Sixth Regiment, Monmouth, Capt. D. E. Clarke,\r\nLieutenants Shields and Turnbull; Company I, Sixth Regiment, Morrison,\r\nCapt. W. F. Colebaugh, Lieutenants Griffin and Baker.\r\n\r\nArriving at the Court-House Park, Mayor Stevens delivered the address of\r\nwelcome. President Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--The magnitude of this vast\r\n  assemblage to-day fills me with surprise and with consternation as I\r\n  am called to make this speech to you. I came here to meet with the\r\n  survivors of my old brigade. I came here with the expectation that the\r\n  day would chiefly be spent in their companionship and in the exchange\r\n  of those cordial greetings which express the fondness and love which\r\n  we bear to each other; but to my surprise I have found that here\r\n  to-day the First Brigade, for the first time in its history, has been\r\n  captured. One or two of them I have been able to take by the hand, a\r\n  few more of them I have seen as they marched by the reviewing stand,\r\n  but they seemed to have been swallowed up in this vast concourse of\r\n  their associate comrades and their fellow-citizens of Illinois. I hope\r\n  there may yet be a time during the day when I shall be able to take\r\n  each by the hand, and to assure them that in the years of separation\r\n  since muster-out day I have borne them all sacredly in my affectionate\r\n  remembrance. They were a body of representative soldiers, coming from\r\n  these great central States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and as the\r\n  borders of those States touch in friendly exchange, so the elbows of\r\n  these great heroes and patriots touched in the great struggle for the\r\n  Union. Who shall say who was chiefest? Who shall assign honors where\r\n  all were brave? The distinction that Illinois may claim in connection\r\n  with this organization is that, given equal courage, fidelity, and\r\n  loyalty to every man, Illinois furnished three-fifths of the brigade.\r\n  But possibly I should withhold here those suggestions which come to\r\n  me, and which will be more appropriate when I meet them in a separate\r\n  organization.\r\n\r\n  I have been greatly impressed with this assemblage to-day in this\r\n  beautiful city, in this rich and prosperous State. The thought had\r\n  occurred to me, and the more I thought of it the more sure I was\r\n  of the conclusion, that nowhere on the face of the earth except in\r\n  the United States of America, under no flag that kisses any breeze,\r\n  could such an assemblage as this have been gathered. Who are these?\r\n  Look into these faces; see the evidences of contentment, thrift,\r\n  prosperity, and intelligence that we read in all these faces. They\r\n  have come by general summons from all these homes, of village,\r\n  city, and farm, and here they are to-day the strength and rock of\r\n  our security as a Nation; the people who furnished an invincible\r\n  army when its flag was in danger; the people upon whose enlightened\r\n  consciences and God-fearing hearts this country may rest with\r\n  unguarded hope. Where is the ultimate distribution of governmental\r\n  powers? How can all the efforts of President, cabinet and judges,\r\n  and armies, even, serve to maintain this country, to continue it in\r\n  its great career of prosperity, if there were lacking this great\r\n  law-abiding, liberty-loving people by whom they are chosen to these\r\n  important offices? It is the great thought of our country that men\r\n  shall be governed as little as possible, but full liberty shall be\r\n  given to individual effort, and that the restraints of law shall be\r\n  reserved for the turbulent and disorderly. What is it that makes our\r\n  communities peaceful? What is it that makes these farm-houses safe?\r\n  It is not the policemen. It is not the soldiers. It is this great and\r\n  all-pervading American sentiment that exalts the law, that stands with\r\n  threatening warning to the law-breaker, and, above all, that pervading\r\n  thought that gives to every man what is his and claims only what is\r\n  our own. The war was only fought that the law might not lose its\r\n  sanction and its sanctity. If we had suffered that loss, dismemberment\r\n  would have been a lesser one. But we taught those who resisted law and\r\n  taught the world that the great sentiment of loyalty to our written\r\n  laws was so strong in this country that no associations, combinations,\r\n  or conspiracies could overturn it. Our Government will not fail to go\r\n  on in this increased career of development, in population, in wealth,\r\n  in intelligence, in morality, so long as we hold up everywhere in the\r\n  local communities and in the Nation this great thought that every man\r\n  shall keep the law which secures him in his own rights, and shall not\r\n  trample upon the rights of another. Let us divide upon tariff and\r\n  finance, but let there never be a division among the American people\r\n  upon this question, that nowhere shall the law be overturned in the\r\n  interests of anybody. If it fails of beneficent purpose, which should\r\n  be the object of all law, then let us modify it, but while it is a\r\n  law let us insist that it shall be obeyed. When we turn from that\r\n  and allow any other standard of living to be set up, where is your\r\n  security, where is mine, when some one else makes convenience more\r\n  sacred, more powerful than the law of the land?\r\n\r\n  I believe to-day that the great rock of our security is this deeply\r\n  imbedded thought in the American heart that does not, as in many of\r\n  our Spanish-American countries, give its devotion to the man, but to\r\n  the law, the Constitution, and to the flag. So that in that hour of\r\n  gloom, when that richest contribution of all gems that Illinois has\r\n  ever set in our Nation's diadem, Abraham Lincoln, and in that hour\r\n  of the consummation of his work, dies by the hand of the assassin,\r\n  Garfield, who was to meet a like fate, might say to the trembling and\r\n  dismayed people: \"Lincoln is dead, but the Government at Washington\r\n  still lives.\"\r\n\r\n  My fellow-citizens, to all those who, through your Mayor, have\r\n  extended me their greeting, to all who are here assembled, I return\r\n  my most sincere thanks. I do not look upon such assemblages without\r\n  profound emotion. They touch me, and I believe they teach me, and\r\n  I am sure that the lessons are wholesome lessons. We have had here\r\n  to-day this procession of veterans, aged and feeble many of them.\r\n  That is retrospective. That is part of the great story of the past,\r\n  written in glorious letters on the firmament that is spread above\r\n  the world. And in these sweet children who have followed we read the\r\n  future. How sweet it was to see them bearing in their infant hands\r\n  these same banners that those veterans carried amid the shot and\r\n  battle and dying of men! I had occasion at the centennial celebration\r\n  of the inauguration of Washington in New York, being impressed by the\r\n  great display of national colors, to make a suggestion that the flag\r\n  should be taken into the schoolhouses, and I am glad to know that in\r\n  that State there is daily a little drill of the children that pays\r\n  honor to the flag. But, my friends, the Constitution provides that\r\n  I shall annually give information to Congress of the state of the\r\n  Union and make such recommendations as I may think wise, and it has\r\n  generally been understood, I think, that this affirmative provision\r\n  contains a negative and implies that the President is to give no one\r\n  except Congress any information as to the state of the Union, and\r\n  that he shall especially make no suggestions that can be in any shape\r\n  misconstrued.\r\n\r\n  I confess that it would give me great pleasure, if the occasion were\r\n  proper, to give you some information as to the state of the Union as I\r\n  see it, and to make some suggestions as to what I think would be wise\r\n  as affecting the state of the Union. But I would not on an occasion\r\n  like this, when I am greeted here by friends, fellow-citizens of all\r\n  shades of thought in politics and in the Church, say a word that could\r\n  mar the harmony of this great occasion. I trust we are all met here\r\n  together to-day as loyal-loving American citizens, and that over all\r\n  our divisions and differences there is this great arch of love and\r\n  loyalty binding us together.\r\n\r\n  And now you will excuse me from further speech when I have said\r\n  again that I am profoundly grateful to the people of Galesburg and\r\n  this vicinity, and to these, my comrades in arms, who have so warmly\r\n  opened their arms to welcome me to-day. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reunion First Brigade, Third Division, Twentieth Army Corps._\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon General Harrison attended the reunion of the First\r\nBrigade Association, of which he is President. This brigade was the\r\nGeneral's command in the late war, and comprised the Seventieth Indiana\r\nRegiment, Seventy-ninth Ohio, One Hundred and Second, One Hundred and\r\nFifth, and One Hundred and Twenty-ninth Illinois. Many veterans were\r\npresent from these regiments. Among the prominent participants were:\r\nGenerals Daniel Dustin and E. F. Dutton, Sycamore, Ill.; Gen. F. C.\r\nSmith, Galesburg; Gen. A. W. Doane, Wilmington, Ohio; General Miles,\r\nCol. H. C. Corbin, H. H. Carr, N. E. Gray, Dr. P. L. McKinnie, and\r\nColonel Sexton, Chicago; H. H. McDowell, Pontiac; Capt. Edward L.\r\nPatterson, Cleveland; Capt. F. E. Scott, Brokenbow, Neb.; Capt. J. T.\r\nMerritt, Aledo; Major M. G. McLain, Indianapolis; Capt. J. E. Huston,\r\nClearfield, Iowa; James M. Ayers, R. M. Smock, Colonel Mannon, Major\r\nJack Burst, Wm. Eddleman, C. D. Braidemeyer, Capt. T. U. Scott, Capt.\r\nT. S. Rogers, C. P. Curtis, Captain Bodkins, and others. Congressman\r\nThos. J. Henderson and many of the above-mentioned officers made brief\r\nspeeches during the reunion. General Dustin occupied the chair pending\r\nthe election of officers for the ensuing year. General Harrison's\r\nre-election as President of the Association was carried amid cheers, and\r\nas he appeared to assume the presiding chair the veterans gave him a\r\nrousing reception.\r\n\r\nThe President then addressed the brigade as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades_--The object of my visit to Galesburg was this meeting\r\n  which we are to have now. I should not, I think, have been persuaded\r\n  to make this trip except for the pleasure which I expected to find\r\n  in meeting the men of the old brigade, from most of whom I have been\r\n  separated since the muster-out day. We have had a great demonstration,\r\n  one very full of interest, on the streets and in the park, but I think\r\n  we are drawn a little closer in this meeting and understand each other\r\n  a little better than in the larger assemblages of which we have made a\r\n  part. It is very pleasant for me to see so many here. I cannot recall\r\n  the names of all of you. Time has wrought its changes upon the faces\r\n  of us all. You recognize me because there were not so many colonels\r\n  as there were soldiers--fortunately, perhaps, for the country.\r\n  [Laughter.] I saw you as individuals in the brigade line when it was\r\n  drawn up either for parade or battle. It is quite natural, therefore,\r\n  and I trust it will not be held against me, that you should have a\r\n  better recollection of my features than I can possibly have of yours.\r\n  And yet some of you I recall and all of you I love. [Applause.] When\r\n  you were associated in a brigade in 1862 we were all somewhat new to\r\n  military duties and life. The officers as well as the men had come\r\n  together animated by a common purpose from every pursuit in life. We\r\n  were not so early in the field as some of our comrades. We yield them\r\n  the honor of longer service, but I think we may claim for ourselves\r\n  that when our hands were lifted to take the enlistment oath there was\r\n  no inducement for any man to go into the army under any expectation\r\n  that he was entering on a holiday. In the early days of the war men\r\n  thought or hoped it would be brief. They did not measure its extent or\r\n  duration. They did not at all rightly estimate the awful sacrifices\r\n  that were to be made before peace with honor was assured.\r\n\r\n  I well remember an incident of the early days of volunteering at\r\n  Indianapolis, when the first companies in response to the first call\r\n  of President Lincoln came hurrying to the capital. Among the first\r\n  to arrive was one from Lafayette, under the command of Capt. Chris.\r\n  Miller. They came in tumultuously and enthusiastic for the fight.\r\n  These companies were organized into regiments, which one by one were\r\n  sent into West Virginia or other fields of service. It happened that\r\n  the regiment to which my friend Miller was assigned was the last to\r\n  leave the State. I met him one day on the street, and a more mad and\r\n  despondent soldier I never saw. He was not absolutely choice in the\r\n  use of his language--all soldiers were not. I think the First Brigade\r\n  was an exception. [Laughter.] He was swearing like a pirate over the\r\n  disgrace that had befallen him and his associates, growing out of the\r\n  fact that he was absolutely certain that the war would be over before\r\n  they got into the field, and left in camp a stranded regiment, having\r\n  no part in putting down the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  Well, his day came presently, and he was ordered to West Virginia,\r\n  and among the first of those who, under the fire of the enemy at Rich\r\n  Mountain, received a bullet through his body was Capt. Chris. Miller.\r\n  When these regiments of ours were enlisted we were not apprehensive\r\n  that the war would be over before we had an adequate share of it. We\r\n  were pretty certain we would all have enough before we were through.\r\n  The clouds were dark in those days of '62. McClellan was shut up\r\n  in the Peninsula; Buell was coming back from Alabama; Kirby Smith\r\n  was entering through Cumberland Gap, and everything seemed to be\r\n  discouraging. I think I may claim for these men of Illinois, and these\r\n  men of Indiana and of Ohio--if some of them are here to meet with us\r\n  to-day--that when they enlisted there was no other motive than pure,\r\n  downright patriotism, and there was no misunderstanding of the serious\r\n  import of the work on which they entered. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Those early days in which we were being transformed from civilians\r\n  into soldiers were full of trial and hardship. The officers were\r\n  sometimes bumptious and unduly severe--I am entering a plea in my own\r\n  behalf now. [Laughter.] The soldiers had not yet got to understand\r\n  why a camp guard should be established, why they should not be at\r\n  perfect liberty to go to town as they were when on the farm and the\r\n  day's work was over. It was supposed that an army was composed of so\r\n  many men, but we had not learned at that time that it was absolutely\r\n  necessary that all those men should be at the same place at the same\r\n  time, and that they could not be scattered over the neighborhood.\r\n  There were a good many trials of that sort while the men were being\r\n  made soldiers and the officers were learning their duties, and to know\r\n  the proper margin between the due liberty of the individual and the\r\n  necessary restraint of discipline. But those days were passed soon,\r\n  and they passed the sooner when the men went into active duties. Camp\r\n  duties were always irksome and troublesome, but when they were changed\r\n  for the active duties of the march and field there was less need of\r\n  restraint.\r\n\r\n  I always noticed there was no great need of a camp guard after\r\n  the boys had marched twenty-five miles. They did not need so much\r\n  watching at night. Then the serious time came when sickness devastated\r\n  us and disease swept its dread swath, and that dreadful progress of\r\n  making soldiers was passed through when diseases which should have\r\n  characterized childhood prostrated and destroyed men. Then there came\r\n  out of all this, after the sifting out of those who were weak and\r\n  incapable, of those who could not stand this acclimating process, that\r\n  body of tough, strong men, ready for the march and fight, that made up\r\n  the great armies which under Grant and Sherman and Sheridan carried\r\n  the flag to triumph.\r\n\r\n  The survivors of some of them are here to-day, and whatever else has\r\n  come to us in life, whether honor or disappointment, I do not think\r\n  there are any of us--not me, I am sure--who would to-day exchange the\r\n  satisfaction, the heart comfort we have in having been a part of the\r\n  great army that subdued the rebellion, that saved the country, the\r\n  Constitution, and the flag. [Applause.] If I were asked to exchange it\r\n  for any honor that has come to me, I would lay down any civil office\r\n  rather than surrender the satisfaction I have in having been an humble\r\n  partaker with you in that great war. [Applause.] Who shall measure it?\r\n  Well, generations hence, when this country, which had 30,000,000, now\r\n  64,000,000, has become 100,000,000, when these institutions of ours\r\n  grow and develop and spread, and homes in which happiness and comfort\r\n  have their abiding place, then we may begin to realize, North and\r\n  South, what this work was. We but imperfectly see it now, yet we have\r\n  seen enough of the glory of the Lord to fill our souls full of a quiet\r\n  enthusiasm. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Here we are pursuing our different works in life to-day just as when\r\n  we stood on picket or on guard, just as in the front rank of battle\r\n  facing the foe--trying to do our part for the country. I hope there\r\n  is not a soldier here in whom the love of the flag has died out. I\r\n  believe there is not one in whose heart it is not a growing passion.\r\n  I think a great deal of the interest of the flag we see among the\r\n  children is because you have taught them what the flag means. No one\r\n  knows how beautiful it is when we see it displayed here on this quiet\r\n  October day, amid these quiet autumnal scenes, who has not seen it\r\n  when there was no other beautiful thing to look upon. [Applause.] And\r\n  in those long, tiresome marches, in those hours of smoke and battle\r\n  and darkness, what was there that was beautiful except the starry\r\n  banner that floated over us? [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Our country has grown and developed and increased in riches until\r\n  it is to-day marvellous among the nations of the earth, sweeping from\r\n  sea to sea, embracing almost every climate, touching the tropics and\r\n  the arctic, covering every form of product of the soil, developing in\r\n  skill in the mechanical arts, developing, I trust and believe, not\r\n  only in these material things which are great, but not the greatest,\r\n  but developing also in those qualities of mind and heart, in morality,\r\n  in the love of order, in sobriety, in respect for the law, in a\r\n  God-fearing disposition among the people, in love for our country, in\r\n  all these high and spiritual things. I believe the soldiers in their\r\n  places have made a large contribution to all these things.\r\n\r\n  The assembling of our great army was hardly so marvellous as\r\n  its disbanding. In the olden time it was expected that a soldier\r\n  would be a brawler when the campaign was over. He was too often a\r\n  disturber. Those habits of violence which he had learned in the field\r\n  followed him to his home. But how different it was in this war of\r\n  ours. The army sprang into life as if by magic, on the call of the\r\n  martyred President--Illinois' greatest gift, as I have said, to the\r\n  Nation. They fought through the war, and they came out of it without\r\n  demoralization. They returned to the very pursuits from which they had\r\n  come. It seemed to one that it was like the wrapping of snow which\r\n  nature sometimes puts over the earth in the winter season to protect\r\n  and keep warm the vegetation which is hidden under it, and which\r\n  under the warm days of spring melts and disappears, and settles into\r\n  the earth to clothe it with verdure and beauty and harvest. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alumni Hall, Knox College._\r\n\r\nAfter the public reception was concluded the President and party\r\nparticipated in the laying of the corner-stone of the Alumni Hall\r\non the campus of Knox College. Dr. Newton Bateman, president of the\r\ncollege, conducted the exercises. Prof. Milton L. Comstock read a brief\r\nhistory of Knox College, at the conclusion of which Dr. Adams introduced\r\nPresident Harrison, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--Speaking this morning in the open air, which\r\n  since my official isolation from campaigning has made my voice\r\n  unaccustomed to it, will make it impossible for me to speak further\r\n  at this time. I do not deem this ceremony at all out of accord with\r\n  the patriotic impulses which have stirred our hearts to-day. Education\r\n  was early in the thought of the framers of our Constitution as one of\r\n  the best, if not the only guarantee of their perpetuation. Washington,\r\n  as well as the founders of the venerable and useful institution,\r\n  appreciated and expressed his interest in the establishment of\r\n  institutions of learning. How shall one be a safe citizen when\r\n  citizens are rulers who are not intelligent? How shall he understand\r\n  those great questions which his suffrage must adjudge without thorough\r\n  intellectual culture in his youth? We are here, then, to-day engaged\r\n  in a patriotic work as we lay this corner-stone of an institution that\r\n  has had a great career of usefulness in the past and is now entering\r\n  upon a field of enlarged usefulness. We lay this corner-stone and\r\n  rededicate this institution to truth, purity, loyalty, and a love of\r\n  God.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phi Delta Theta Banquet._\r\n\r\nIn the evening the President attended a banquet tendered him by Lombard\r\nand Knox chapters of Phi Delta Theta, of which college fraternity\r\nGeneral Harrison was a member in his student days. At the President's\r\ntable sat Toastmaster Lester L. Silliman, of Lombard Chapter, with\r\nGeneral Miles, Generals Grosvenor, Morgan, and Post, Mayor Stevens, Dr.\r\nAyres, and Rev. Dr. Hood. Brother Geo. W. Prince delivered the welcoming\r\naddress on behalf of the local chapters, to which the distinguished Phi\r\nbrother, President Harrison, arising amid great applause, responded.\r\nAfter a few pleasant remarks regarding his recollections of college life\r\nand his pleasure at meeting again with the members of the Phi Delta\r\nTheta, he said:\r\n\r\n  My college associations were broken early in life, partly by\r\n  necessity and partly by choice; by necessity so far as the compulsion\r\n  to work for a living was upon me, and by choice in that I added to my\r\n  responsibility at an early date, so that it has not been my pleasure\r\n  often to meet with or sit about the banquet board with members of this\r\n  society. It gives me pleasure to meet with you to-night. I feel the\r\n  greatest sympathy with these young men who are now disciplining their\r\n  minds for the work of life. I would not have them make these days too\r\n  serious, and yet they are very full of portent and promise. It is not\r\n  inconsistent, I think, with the joyfulness and gladness which pertains\r\n  to youth that they shall have some sense of the value of these golden\r\n  days. They are days that are to affect the whole future. If I were to\r\n  select a watchword that I would have every young man write above his\r\n  door and on his heart, it would be that good word \"Fidelity.\" I know\r\n  of no better. The man who meets every obligation to the family, to\r\n  society, to the State, to his country, and his God, to the very best\r\n  measure of his strength and ability, cannot fail of that assurance and\r\n  quietness that comes of a good conscience, and will seldom fail of the\r\n  approval of his fellow-men, and will never fail of the reward which is\r\n  promised to faithfulness. Unfaithfulness and lack of fidelity to duty,\r\n  to work, and to obligation is the open door to all that is disgraceful\r\n  and degrading.\r\n\r\n  I want to thank you again, gentlemen, for this pleasant greeting,\r\n  and to ask you, after the rather exhaustive duties of this day, to\r\n  excuse me from further address and accept the best wishes of a brother\r\n  in the Phi Delta Theta organization. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brigade Banquet._\r\n\r\nLater in the evening the President and party attended a banquet given by\r\nthe citizens in honor of the First Brigade. It was a brilliant affair,\r\nconducted by the ladies of the city, active among whom were Mrs. Geo.\r\nLescher, Miss Tillie Weeks, Miss Maude Stewart, Miss Winnie Hoover,\r\nand Mrs. Whiffen. Mrs. George Gale had charge of the table of honor,\r\nassisted by Mrs. Otto M. Smith and Miss Louise Tryon. Gen. Philip S.\r\nPost was Master of Ceremonies and presented General Harrison.\r\n\r\nThe President prologued his parting words with an incident of a visit\r\nhe made to a small town down the Potomac. Although he was introduced\r\nas President all over the town, no special attention was paid to him,\r\nand when the local paper came out with a column and a half report of\r\nthe visit of the Chief Executive, the good people of the town were\r\nastonished, but explained their lack of attention by saying they thought\r\nMr. Harrison was president of some fishing club. Aside from jokes, said\r\nthe President:\r\n\r\n  One serious word in leaving. This day in Galesburg I shall long\r\n  remember. The enthusiasm and the cordiality of the citizens, the\r\n  delicacy and kindness of their attention, have impressed me deeply.\r\n  I shall ever gratefully recollect Galesburg as a spot of especial\r\n  interest, as the place of the meeting of the old brigade. Comrades,\r\n  I hope to meet you again when my time is more my own, and on several\r\n  occasions like this to speak to you more familiarly, and to recall\r\n  this time. I have tried not to be stinted in my intercourse with you,\r\n  for I have wanted you to feel me warm and sincere. I have expressed\r\n  myself, but not as freely as I would if by ourselves, or if I were\r\n  but a private citizen or member of the brigade. But I would say to\r\n  you and all your families, to the wives that sit here, to the wives\r\n  and children that are at home, to those who have gone out from your\r\n  roof-tree to prepare homes, to your grand-children--and I hope all of\r\n  you have them--to one and all, I extend the hearty sympathy and best\r\n  wishes of the \"old-timer\" you served so faithfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTUMWA, IOWA, OCTOBER 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's party left Galesburg the night of the 8th, arriving\r\nat Burlington at 10 o'clock, where about 8,000 people greeted them.\r\nThe President was escorted to the Commercial Club rooms, where Mayor\r\nDuncan, on behalf of the city of Burlington, and P. M. Crapo, president\r\nof the club, made addresses of welcome. A reception of one hour's\r\nduration followed, during which President Harrison shook hands with\r\n3,000 callers. Ottumwa was reached at 8 o'clock Thursday morning. A\r\ncommittee of citizens, headed by Hon. J. G. Hutchison, met the President\r\nat Galesburg. On arrival the President and his brother, John Scott\r\nHarrison, were immediately driven to the residence of their sister, Mrs.\r\nT. J. Devin, where they passed the morning.\r\n\r\nAt the Coal Palace the President and Secretary Tracy were met by Gov.\r\nHorace Boies and his staff, headed by Adjt.-Gen Greene; also Senator\r\nWm. B. Allison, Senator James F. Wilson, ex-Senator Harlan, Hon. John\r\nF. Lacey, and the following Committee of Reception, representing the\r\ncity of Ottumwa: T. J. Devin, W. T. Harper, J. E. Hawkins, W. B. Smith,\r\nHenry Phillips, Sam'l A. Flager, J. C. Manchester, A. W. Johnson, W. T.\r\nFenton, J. G. Meek, Calvin Manning, Geo. Withall, J. W. Garner, J. J.\r\nSmith, W. W. Epps, H. B. Hendershott, J. H. Merrill, W. B. Bonnifield,\r\nA. H. Hamilton, C. F. Blake, John C. Fisher, Hon. John N. Irwin, J. T.\r\nHackworth, W. C. Wyman, John C. Jordan, A. G. Harrow, Allen Johnston,\r\nT. D. Foster, J. W. Edgerly, A. W. Lee, William Daggett, G. H. Sheffer,\r\nW. D. Elliott, Charles Bachman, H. A. Zangs, R. H. Moore, Capt. S. B.\r\nEvans, Capt. S. H. Harper, H. W. Merrill, J. R. Burgess, J. B. Mowrey,\r\nA. C. Leighton, W. S. Cripps, R. L. Tilton, Dr. L. J. Baker, D. A.\r\nEmery, Samuel Mahon, W. S. Coen, O. C. Graves, Thomas Swords, and\r\nJohn F. Henry. Other cities in Iowa were represented on the Reception\r\nCommittee by the following prominent citizens: Hon. John Craig, of\r\nKeokuk; Judge Traverse and Senator Taylor, of Bloomfield; Gen. W. W.\r\nWright and Gen. F. M. Drake, Centerville; Gen. B. M. McFall, Oskaloosa;\r\nT. B. Perry and J. H. Drake, Albia; Geo. D. Woodin and Hon. F. E. White,\r\nSigourney; Hon. Chas. D. Leggett and Chas. D. Fullen, Fairfield; Hon.\r\nEdwin Manning and Capt. W. A. Duckworth, Keosauqua; F. R. Crocker\r\nand E. A. Temple, Chariton; O. P. Wright, Knoxville; E. B. Woodruff,\r\nMarion Co.; Col. Al. Swalm, Oskaloosa; Hon. W. P. Smith, Hon. Josiah\r\nGiven, Hon. Fred Lehman, G. W. Wright, Des Moines; Hon. John H. Gear,\r\nHon. John J. Seely, Burlington; Hon. F. C. Hormel, Capt. M. P. Mills,\r\nCedar Rapids; Hon. Geo. H. Spahr, Hon. W. I. Babb, Mt. Pleasant; Hon.\r\nJ. B. Grinnell, of Grinnell; Dr. Engle, Newton; Frank Letts and J. S.\r\nMcFarland, Marshalltown; Hon. J. B. Harsh and M. A. Robb, Creston;\r\nex-Governor Kirkwood and Ezekiel Clark, Iowa City.\r\n\r\nThe President and Governor Boies reviewed the parade from a stand\r\nin the park. The column was led by the veterans of the famous Third\r\nIowa Cavalry. Three thousand school children participated in the\r\ndemonstration, which was witnessed by fully 40,000 spectators. The\r\npublic reception took place in the afternoon at the Coal Palace; the\r\ngreat building was overflowing. Hon. P. G. Ballingall, President of the\r\nCoal Palace Exposition, introduced Governor Boies, who welcomed the\r\nPresident in behalf of the people of Iowa.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Boies and Fellow-citizens_--I accept in the same cordial\r\n  and friendly spirit in which they have been offered these words of\r\n  welcome spoken on behalf of the good people of the great State of\r\n  Iowa. It gives me pleasure in this hasty journey to pause for a\r\n  little time in the city of Ottumwa. I have had especial pleasure in\r\n  looking upon this structure and the exhibits which it contains. It is\r\n  itself a proof of the enterprise, skill, and artistic taste of the\r\n  people of this city of which they may justly be very proud. I look\r\n  about it and see that its adornment has been wrought with materials\r\n  that are familiar and common, and that these have assumed, under the\r\n  deft fingers and artistic thoughts of your people, shapes of beauty\r\n  that are marvellously attractive. If I should attempt to interpret\r\n  the lesson of this structure, I should say it was an illustration of\r\n  how much that is artistic and graceful is to be found in the common\r\n  things of life; and if I should make an application of the lesson, it\r\n  would be to suggest that we might profitably carry into all our homes\r\n  and into all neighborly intercourse the same transforming spirit.\r\n  The common things of this life, touched by a loving spirit, may be\r\n  made to glow and glisten. The common intercourse of life, touched by\r\n  friendliness and love, may be made to fill every home and neighborhood\r\n  with a brightness that jewels cannot shed. And it is pleasant to think\r\n  that in our American home-life we have reached this ideal in a degree\r\n  unexcelled elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  I believe that in the American home, whether in the city or on\r\n  the farm, the American father and the American mother, in their\r\n  relations to the children, are kinder, more helpful, and benignant\r\n  than any others. [Cries of \"Good! Good!\" and cheers.] In these homes\r\n  is the strength of our institutions. Let these be corrupted and\r\n  the Government itself has lost the stone of strength upon which it\r\n  securely rests.\r\n\r\n(Here, by some accident of arrangement, the water of an artificial\r\nwaterfall immediately behind the President was turned on, and the rush\r\nand roar of the water drowned his voice almost completely.)\r\n\r\n  I have contended with a brass band while attempting to address a\r\n  popular audience, but I have never before been asked to speak in the\r\n  rush and roar of Niagara. [Laughter and cheers.] I think if I were to\r\n  leave it to this audience whether they would rather see that beautiful\r\n  display and hear the rippling of these waters [pointing] than to hear\r\n  me, they would vote for the waterfall. [Cries of \"No, no!\" and \"Shut\r\n  off the water!\"]\r\n\r\n(At this point the management succeeded in finally turning off the water\r\nso that the deafening noise ceased.)\r\n\r\n  I had supposed that there were limitations upon the freedom of this\r\n  meeting this afternoon, both as to the Governor and myself, and that\r\n  no political suggestion of any sort was to be introduced into this\r\n  friendly concourse of American citizens; and I think both of us have\r\n  good cause for grievances against the prohibitionists for interrupting\r\n  us with this argument for cold water. [Great laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is quite difficult, called upon as I am every day, and\r\n  sometimes three or four times a day, to make short addresses with\r\n  the limitations that are upon me as to the subjects upon which I may\r\n  speak, to know what to say when I meet my fellow-citizens. I was\r\n  glad to hear the Governor say that Iowa is prosperous. We have here\r\n  a witness that it is so. It offers also, I think, a solution of the\r\n  origin of that prosperity, and suggests how it may be increased and\r\n  developed. We have in this structure a display of all the products of\r\n  the farm, and side by side with it a display of the mechanic arts. I\r\n  think in this combination, in this diversity of interest and pursuit,\r\n  in this mutual and helpful relation between the toilers of the soil\r\n  and the workers in our shops, each contributing to the commonwealth\r\n  and each giving to the other that which he needs, we have that which\r\n  has brought about the prosperity you now enjoy, and which is to\r\n  increase under the labors of your children to a degree that we have\r\n  not realized. The progress in the mechanical arts that men not older\r\n  than I have witnessed, the application of new agencies to the use of\r\n  men within the years of my own notice and recollection, read like a\r\n  fairy tale. Let us not think that we have reached the limits of this\r\n  development. There are yet uses of the agencies already known to be\r\n  developed and applied. There are yet agencies perhaps in the great\r\n  storehouse of nature that have not been harnessed for the use of\r\n  man. The telegraph, the telephone, and the phonograph have all come\r\n  within the memory of many who stand about me to-day. The application\r\n  of steam to ocean travel is within the memory of many here. The\r\n  development of our railroad system has all come within your memory\r\n  and mine. The railroad was but a feeble agency in commerce when\r\n  my early recollection begins; and now this great State is covered\r\n  with railroads like a network. Every farm is within easy reach of a\r\n  shipping station, and every man can speak to his neighbor any day of\r\n  the week, though that neighbor live on the opposite side of the globe.\r\n  Out of all this what is yet to come? Who can tell? You are favored\r\n  here in having not only a surface soil that yields richly to the labor\r\n  of the farmer, but in also having hidden beneath that surface rich\r\n  mines of coal which are to be converted into power to propel the mills\r\n  that will supply the wants of your people.\r\n\r\n  Now, my friends, thanking you for the kindness with which you have\r\n  listened to me, expressing again my appreciation of the taste and\r\n  beauty of this great structure in which we stand, and wishing for Iowa\r\n  and all its citizens the largest increase of prosperity in material\r\n  wealth, the most secure social order in all their communities, and the\r\n  crowning blessing of home happiness, I bid you good-by. [Prolonged\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. JOSEPH, MISSOURI, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first reception in the State of Missouri took place at St. Joseph\r\nat 6:30 the morning of October 10. Many thousands greeted the President\r\nat the Union Depot. Conspicuous in the assemblage were the veterans of\r\nCuster Post, G. A. R., who escorted the party to the neighboring hotel.\r\nThe Committee of Reception consisted of Col. A. C. Dawes, Chairman;\r\nMayor Wm. Shepard, Hon. John L. Bittinger, Capt Chas. F. Ernst, Capt. F.\r\nM. Posegate, Col. N. P. Ogden, August Nunning, Wm. M. Wyeth, Major T. J.\r\nChew, Hon. Geo. J. Englehart, Hon. O. M. Spencer, Dr. J. D. Smith, James\r\nMcCord, ex-Gov. Silas Woodson, John M. Frazier, Frank M. Atkinson, Rev.\r\nH. L. Foote, and Major Joseph Hansen.\r\n\r\nColonel Dawes made a brief welcoming address and presented the\r\nPresident, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--If you are glad to see me at this hour in the\r\n  morning, if you are so kind and demonstrative before breakfast, how\r\n  great would have been your welcome if I had come a little later in the\r\n  day? [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I beg to thank you, who at an inconvenient and early hour, have\r\n  turned out to speak these words of welcome to us as we pass through\r\n  your beautiful city. Many years ago I read of St. Joseph. I know\r\n  something of its history, when, instead of being a large city, it was\r\n  a place for outfitting those slow and toilsome trains that bore the\r\n  early pioneers toward California and the far West. Those days are not\r\n  to be forgotten. Those means of communication were slow, but they\r\n  bore men and women, full of courage and patriotism, to do for us on\r\n  the Pacific and in the great West the work of peaceful conquest that\r\n  has added greatly to the glory and prosperity of our country. And yet\r\n  we congratulate ourselves that the swifter means of communication\r\n  have taken the place of the old; we congratulate ourselves that these\r\n  conveniences, both of business and social life, have come to crown\r\n  our day. And yet in the midst of them, enjoying the luxuries which\r\n  modern civilization brings to our doors, let us not lose from our\r\n  households those plain and sturdy virtues which are essential to\r\n  true American citizenship; let us remember always that above all\r\n  surroundings, above all that is external, there is to be prized those\r\n  solid and essential virtues that make home happy and that make our\r\n  country great, and that enable us in every time of trial and necessity\r\n  to call out from among the people some who are fit to lead our armies\r\n  or to meet every emergency in the history of the State. We are here\r\n  as American citizens, not as partisans; we are here as comrades of\r\n  the late war, or, if there are here those who under the other banner\r\n  fought for what seemed to them to be right, we are here to say one\r\n  and all that God knew what was best for this country when he cast\r\n  the issue in favor of the Union and the Constitution. [Applause and\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Now, again united under its ample guarantee of personal liberty and\r\n  public security, united again under one flag, we have started forward,\r\n  if we are true to our obligations, upon a career of prosperity that\r\n  would not otherwise have been possible. Let us therefore, in all\r\n  kindliness and faithfulness, in devotion to the right, as God shall\r\n  give us light to see it, go forward in the discharge of our duties,\r\n  setting above everything else the flag and the Constitution on which\r\n  all our rights and securities are based. Now, my comrades of the Grand\r\n  Army of the Republic and fellow-citizens of Missouri, again I thank\r\n  you and bid you good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATCHISON, KANSAS, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntering Kansas the President was the recipient of a unique welcome at\r\nAtchison, where 1,000 school children and several thousand citizens\r\ngreeted him. Little Edna Elizabeth Downs was the orator on behalf of the\r\nchildren, and delivered a beautiful address, at the conclusion of which\r\nthe children showered the President with flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Atchison, Hon. B. P. Waggener, and the following prominent\r\ncitizens welcomed the Chief Executive: Hon. John J. Ingalls, Hon.\r\nEdward K. Blair, Hon. Clem Rohr, Hon. S. C. King, Hon. S. H. Kelsey,\r\nHon. John C. Tomlinson, Hon. A. J. Harwi, Hon. Henry Elleston, Hon. S.\r\nR. Stevenson, Hon. C. W. Benning, Judge Rob't M. Eaton, ex-Gov. Geo.\r\nW. Glick, Hon. H. C. Solomon, Judge A. G. Otis, Judge David Martin, L.\r\nC. Challiss, E. W. Howe, David Auld, B. T. Davis, Chas. E. Faulkner,\r\nMajor W. H. Haskell, Major S. R. Washer, Capt. J. K. Fisher, Capt. David\r\nBaker, Capt. John Seaton, Stanton Park, T. B. Gerow, and H. Claypark.\r\nChief-Justice Albert H. Horton made the welcoming address and introduced\r\nPresident Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I stand to-day for the first time upon the\r\n  soil of Kansas. I am glad to have been permitted to enter it by the\r\n  vestibule of this attractive city, the home of one of your most\r\n  brilliant statesmen. I cannot refrain from saying, God be thanked\r\n  that freedom won its early battle in Kansas. [Applause.] All this\r\n  would have been otherwise impossible. You have a soil christened with\r\n  the blood of men who died for liberty, and you have well maintained\r\n  the lessons they taught, living and dying. It was appropriate that\r\n  the survivors of the late war, men who came home crowned with the\r\n  consummating victory of liberty, should make the State of Kansas\r\n  pre-eminently the soldier State of the Union. Now, after telling you\r\n  that I am very grateful for your friendly greeting this morning, you\r\n  will, I am sure, excuse me, in this tumult, from attempting further\r\n  speech. May every good attend you in your homes; may the career of\r\n  this great State be one of unceasing prosperity in things material,\r\n  and may your citizenship never forget that the spiritual things that\r\n  take hold of liberty and human rights are higher and better than all\r\n  material things. [Prolonged cheering.] Allow me now to present to you\r\n  the only member of my Cabinet who accompanied me, General Tracy, of\r\n  New York, the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPEKA, KANSAS, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's reception at Topeka on Friday, October 10, was a\r\nremarkable ovation; over 50,000 people from every county in the State\r\ngreeted him. The famous Seventh U. S. Cavalry, Gen. J. W. Forsythe\r\ncommanding, acted as the guard of honor. The President was welcomed by\r\nGov. Lyman U. Humphrey, Senator John J. Ingalls, Chief-Justice Albert\r\nH. Horton, Mayor Robert L. Cofran, and the following distinguished\r\ncommittee: Ex-Gov. Thomas A. Osborn, ex-Gov. Geo. T. Anthony, Capt.\r\nGeo. R. Peck, Col. James Burgess, Hon. S. B. Bradford, Judge N. C.\r\nMcFarland, Judge John Martin, A. J. Arnold, John Guthrie, Wm. P.\r\nDouthitt, John Mileham, William Sims, Cyrus K. Holliday, Perry G.\r\nNoel, S. T. Howe, Bernard Kelly, J. Lee Knight, N. D. McGinley, Wm. H.\r\nRossington, Rev. Dr. F. S. McCabe, Geo. W. Reed, Elihu Holcomb, Lark\r\nOdin, L. J. Webb, Milo B. Ward, J. K. Hudson, F. P. McLennan, H. O.\r\nGarvey, Frank Root, John M. Bloss, John F. Gwinn, A. M. Fuller, J. W. F.\r\nHughes, John R. Peckham, James L. King, Henry Bennett, Geo. H. Evans,\r\nM. C. Holman, John C. Gordon, H. P. Throop, Joseph R. Hankland, T. W.\r\nDurham, Judge C. G. Foster, A. K. Rodgers, A. B. Jetmore, and Thomas F.\r\nOenes.\r\n\r\nThe parade was an imposing affair. Thirty thousand veterans were in\r\nline. The Indiana contingent numbered over 1,000, and as they passed\r\nthe reviewing carriage, led by Major George Noble, cheer after cheer\r\nwas given in honor of the distinguished Hoosier. Nearly 6,000 school\r\nchildren participated in the parade. In the afternoon the President\r\nvisited the reunion grounds with Commander Ira F. Collins and other\r\nofficers of the Kansas Department, G. A. R. Governor Humphrey delivered\r\nthe welcoming address.\r\n\r\nThe President responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I am strongly tempted to omit even an attempt\r\n  to speak to you to-day; I think it would be better that I should go\r\n  home and write you an open letter. [Great laughter and cheering.] I\r\n  have been most profoundly impressed with the incidents which have\r\n  attended this tremendous and, I am told, unprecedented gathering\r\n  of the soldiers and citizens of the great State of Kansas. No one\r\n  can interpret in speech the lessons of this occasion. No power of\r\n  description is adequate to convey to those who have not looked upon\r\n  it or into the spirit and power of this meeting. This assembly is\r\n  altogether too large to be greeted individually--one cannot get his\r\n  arms around it. [Laughter and cheers.] And yet so kindly have you\r\n  received me that I would be glad if to each of you I could convey the\r\n  sense of gratitude and appreciation which is in my heart. There is\r\n  nothing for any of us to do but to open wide our hearts and let these\r\n  elevating suggestions take possession of them. I am sure there has\r\n  been nothing here to-day that does not point in the direction of a\r\n  higher individual, social, State and national life. Who can look upon\r\n  this vast array of soldiers who fought to a victorious consummation\r\n  the war for the Union without bowing his head and his heart in\r\n  grateful reverence? [Great applause.] Who can look upon these sons of\r\n  veterans, springing from a patriotic ancestry, full of the spirit of\r\n  '61, and coming into the vigor and strength of manhood to take up the\r\n  burdens that we must soon lay down, and who, turning from these to the\r\n  sweet-faced children whose hands are filled with flowers and flags,\r\n  can fail to feel those institutions of liberty are secure for two\r\n  generations at least? [Great cheering.] I never knew until to-day the\r\n  extent of the injury which the State of Kansas had inflicted upon the\r\n  State of Indiana [laughter and cheers]--never until I had looked upon\r\n  that long line of Indiana soldiers that you plucked from us when the\r\n  war was over by the superior inducement which your fields and cities\r\n  offered to their ambitious toil. Indiana grieves for their loss, but\r\n  rejoices in the homes and prosperity they have found here. [Cheers.]\r\n  They are our proud contribution to the great development which this\r\n  State has made. They are our proud contribution to that great national\r\n  reputation which your State has established as the friend as well as\r\n  one of the bulwarks of liberty and law. [Cheers.] It was not unnatural\r\n  that they, coming back from scenes where comrades had shed their blood\r\n  for liberty, should choose to find homes in a State that had the\r\n  baptism of martyrs' blood upon its infant brow. [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n  The future is safe if we are but true to ourselves, true to these\r\n  children whose instruction is committed to us. There is no other foe\r\n  that can at all obstruct or hinder our onward progress except treason\r\n  in our own midst--treachery to the great fundamental principle of our\r\n  Government, which is obedience to the law. The law, the will of the\r\n  majority expressed in orderly, constitutional methods, is the only\r\n  king to which we bow. But to him all must bow. Let it be understood\r\n  in all your communities that no selfish interest of the individual,\r\n  no class interests, however entrenched, shall be permitted to assert\r\n  their convenience against the law. This is good American doctrine,\r\n  and if it can be made to prevail in all the States of the Union until\r\n  every man, secure under the law in his own right, is compelled by the\r\n  law to yield to every other man his rights, nothing can shake our\r\n  repose. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Now, fellow-citizens, you will excuse me from the attempt at further\r\n  speech. I beg you again to believe that I am grateful, so far as\r\n  your presence here has any personal reference to myself--grateful as\r\n  a public officer for this evidence of your love and affection for the\r\n  Constitution and the country which we all love. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  There is some grumbling in Kansas, and I think it is because your\r\n  advantages are too great. [Laughter.] A single year of disappointment\r\n  in agricultural returns should not make you despair of the future or\r\n  tempt you to unsafe expedients. Life is made up of averages, and I\r\n  think yours will show a good average. Let us look forward with hope,\r\n  with courage, fidelity, thrift, patience, good neighborly hearts, and\r\n  a patriotic love for the flag. Kansas and her people have an assured\r\n  and happy future. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTONVILLE, KANSAS, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Nortonville the citizens, and especially the school children, turned\r\nout _en masse_ and gave the President the heartiest of welcomes. Among\r\nthe prominent residents who participated in the greeting were Hon. A. J.\r\nPerry, S. P. Griffin, Thomas Eckles, C. C. McCarthy, Dr. D. T. Brown, L.\r\nP. King, D. A. Ellsworth, O. U. Babcock, Dr. R. D. Webb, J. G. Roberts,\r\nW. T. Eckles, Harry Ellison, Rev. T. Hood, and M. Crowberger. On behalf\r\nof the school children a little girl climbed the steps and presented the\r\nChief Magistrate with an armful of beautiful bouquets, for which she\r\nreceived a hearty kiss.\r\n\r\nGovernor Humphrey introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--This brief stop forbids that I should say\r\n  anything more than thank you and to extend to you all my most\r\n  friendly greeting. The sky is overcast, but in this assemblage of\r\n  your school children, with flags and flowers, and in this gathering\r\n  of the sturdy men who have made Kansas great among States, there are\r\n  suggestions that spread a sky of beauty and hope above our country\r\n  and its destiny. It gives me great pleasure to make this first visit\r\n  to Kansas. It gives me great pleasure to see both at Atchison and\r\n  here the interest which the presence of these children shows you\r\n  take in public education. There are many here who in their early\r\n  days experienced the hardships and privations of pioneer life. The\r\n  avenues of learning were shut against them, but it is much to their\r\n  credit that what they lacked in early life, the impediments which have\r\n  burdened their careers, they have bravely resolved shall not burden\r\n  their children. I thank you again for this pleasant reception, and I\r\n  bid you good-by, as we proceed on our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALLEY FALLS, KANSAS, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Valley Falls, Kan., another large crowd was assembled. The President\r\nwas welcomed by Mayor A. D. Kendall, Dr. A. M. Cowan, R. H. Crosby, M.\r\nM. Maxwell, Dr. Frank Swallow, Mrs. J. H. Murry, Miss L. M. Ring, and\r\nother prominent residents. Mrs. Dr. Cowan, on behalf of the ladies,\r\npresented General Harrison with a basket of flowers.\r\n\r\nIn response to the enthusiastic greetings the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I thank you sincerely for this cordial reception. I\r\n  will not attempt any speech further than to say that this greeting\r\n  puts me, if possible, under still stronger obligations in every\r\n  official duty that devolves upon me to consult the interests of the\r\n  people and do that which seems to be most promotive of public good.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE, KANSAS, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historic city of Lawrence was reached at 4:40 o'clock, where the\r\ncheers of an immense multitude, including a battalion from Haskell\r\nInstitute, welcomed the President. The Reception Committee consisted of\r\nMayor A. Henley, George Innis, W. H. Whitney, Gov. Chas. Robinson, Gen.\r\nJ. N. Roberts, and E. F. Goodrich. The veterans of Washington Post, G.\r\nA. R., Gen. H. S. Hall, Commander, were present in a body.\r\n\r\nMayor Henley, in the name of the city, welcomed the President, who,\r\nresponding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am sure you are kind, and the greatest kindness you\r\n  can do me is not to ask me to attempt to speak again so recently after\r\n  attempting at Topeka to talk to all the rest of the people in Kansas\r\n  [laughter] who are not here. I supposed until the train pulled into\r\n  this city that the entire citizenship of the State was in the immense\r\n  crowd congregated at Topeka to-day. My voice was so strained in\r\n  attempting to speak there that I will only say to you that it gives me\r\n  great pleasure to see you and to speak to you, even for a moment, at\r\n  this hospitable town. All the inspiration connected with the story of\r\n  the early history of Kansas clusters around the city of Lawrence. I am\r\n  sure you will find in that story inspiration and suggestion that will\r\n  keep the cause of liberty ever near to your hearts. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS CITY, OCTOBER 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party reached Kansas City at 5:30 P.M. Friday, where\r\na grand reception was tendered the Chief Executive. The Committee\r\nof Reception, representing the municipality and business interests,\r\ncomprised the following prominent citizens, who escorted the President\r\nfrom Topeka: Mayor Benjamin Holmes, Witten McDonald, J. C. James, Joseph\r\nSpeyer, Judge C. L. Dobson, Col. M. J. Payne, W. S. Woods, Hon. E. H.\r\nAllen, F. L. Kaufman, M. E. Lawrence, Joseph Cahn, Col. T. B. Bullene,\r\nCol. E. H. Phelps, Col. J. F. Richards, George R. Barse, Major William\r\nWarner, William Taylor, Col. Louis Hammerslough, E. C. Sattley, J. H.\r\nFink, Col. W. A. Wilson, Marshal Tracy, F. B. Nofsinger, Collector\r\nDevol, Surveyor Guffin, Dr. F. W. Schulte, W. T. Urie, G. S. Hampton, J.\r\nH. Smith, M. D. Henderson, H. J. Rosecrans, R. M. Easley, H. C. Fike,\r\nB. S. Flersheim, Wm. Barton, H. J. Long, E. M. Clendening, T. James,\r\nJames M. Coburn, L. E. Irwin, C. L. Valandingham, G. W. Hollinger, E. E.\r\nRichardson, E. M. Wilcox, J. M. Cooper, W. H. Bundage, M. H. Dickerson,\r\nC. A. Brockett, S. A. Pierce, J. H. Neff, S. R. Hudson, A. H. Moffitt,\r\nS. B. Stokely, P. L. Whipple, J. W. Merrill, D. G. Saunders, F. W.\r\nHatch, G. Bernheimer, B. C. Burgess, S. T. Smith, and J. L. Walker.\r\n\r\nAn enormous crowd greeted the President as he was driven to the Coates\r\nHouse, where the distinguished party were entertained at dinner by Mayor\r\nHolmes, ex-Governor Crittenden, Mayor W. A. Coy, of Kansas City, Kan.;\r\nGov. A. J. Smith, of the Soldiers' Home at Leavenworth; Hon. John Scott\r\nHarrison--the President's brother--and other leading citizens.\r\n\r\nIn response to a toast to the President's health, General Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I am sorry to cause even this temporary interruption by\r\n  leaving the banquet, but I am sure you will all appreciate the desire\r\n  I have to spend a few minutes under my brother's roof in your city,\r\n  and will therefore excuse me. Let me say that I very much appreciate\r\n  the friendly and hospitable spirit of the business men of Kansas\r\n  City, to whom I am indebted for this banquet and reception. It has\r\n  never been my pleasure before to visit your city, but it has been\r\n  well advertised, and I have heard of it frequently. [Laughter and\r\n  applause.] So far as I could tell by the dim light of the evening in\r\n  riding through the city, it realizes fully my expectations in growth\r\n  and prosperity. [Applause.] Let me say, in conclusion, that I hope all\r\n  your dreams for Kansas City may be realized. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nAfter passing the evening at his brother's residence, at 8 P.M. the\r\nPresident was escorted by 300 members of the Third Regiment and a\r\ncavalry guard, commanded by Col. Milton Moore, to the Chamber of\r\nCommerce, where an informal reception was held.\r\n\r\nMajor William Warner introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow citizens_--I will not attempt to say more than that I\r\n  am very grateful to you for your kindness, for this cordial, genuine\r\n  Kansas City welcome. [Cheers.] The arrangements which have been made,\r\n  and which are intended to give me an opportunity to meet some of you\r\n  personally, and the early hour at which we are to take the train for\r\n  St. Louis, make it inappropriate that I should attempt to speak at\r\n  any length. I thank you again for your kindness, and will now submit\r\n  myself to such arrangements as the committee have made to spend the\r\n  little time I have to spend with you. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS, OCTOBER 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President arrived in St. Louis at 9:30 in the morning and received\r\na royal welcome. As he drove through the city amid the roar of cannon,\r\nit is estimated that fully 200,000 people greeted him, and his journey\r\npartook of a triumph. The committee of escort that met the President at\r\nKansas City consisted of ex-Gov. E. O. Stanard, Col. S. W. Fordyce, Hon.\r\nR. C. Kerens, and Marcus Bernheimer. The guard of honor was a detail\r\nfrom the Grand Army, commanded by Major Leo Rassieur.\r\n\r\nThe President was met on arrival by the following distinguished\r\nCommittee of Reception: His Honor, Mayor Noonan, D. M. Houser, Geo. D.\r\nReynolds, R. M. Scruggs, Nelson Cole, Col. James G. Butler, Col. J. O.\r\nChurchill, Daniel Catlin, Wm. M. Senter, John Orrick, John S. Moffett,\r\nS. Newman, D. P.

H. King, C. P. Walbridge, B. F.\r\nHarnett, Geo. Taylor, R. P. Tansey, A. S. White, F. A. Wann, M. M.\r\nBodenheimer, W. A. Hargadine, George A. Baker, John N. Booth, Geo. W.\r\nParker, J. D.

West.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the parade from the balcony of the Southern Hotel the\r\nPresident and Secretary Tracy visited the Merchants' Exchange and\r\nwere tendered a reception by the business men of the city. Mr. Marcus\r\nBernheimer, President of the Exchange, occupied the presiding chair and\r\nintroduced Gov. D. R. Francis, who, in an eloquent address, welcomed\r\nthe President in the name of the people of Missouri. The Governor was\r\nfollowed by Hon. Edward A. Noonan, Mayor of St. Louis, who extended a\r\n\"sincere and hearty greeting,\" on behalf of the residents of the city.\r\n\r\nHon. Charles Parsons then introduced the President, who addressed the\r\nassemblage as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Francis, Mr. Mayor, and Fellow-citizens_--It is very\r\n  grateful and very healthful to be so cordially received by you this\r\n  morning. The office which I have been called upon to administer\r\n  is very great in dignity, but it is very full of care and heavy\r\n  responsibility. The man who with conscientious regard and a proper\r\n  appreciation of the great trust seeks to administer it for the public\r\n  good will find himself daily beset with perplexities and doubts,\r\n  and daily besieged by those who differ with him as to the public\r\n  administration. But it is a great comfort to know that we have an\r\n  intelligent, thoughtful, and, at the same time, a very kind people,\r\n  who judge benevolently and kindly the acts of those public servants\r\n  of whose good disposition to do right they are not left in doubt. And\r\n  it is very pleasant to know--and I do not need these eloquent words\r\n  of assurance to have already impressed upon me--the great lesson that\r\n  there are more things in which we agree and have common interests\r\n  than in which we differ. But our differences of opinion as to public\r\n  administration are all brought together in a genuine patriotism and\r\n  love of country. [Applause]. It gives me pleasure to witness since\r\n  my last visit to St. Louis evidence of that steady and uninterrupted\r\n  growth which this great commercial centre has made since its birth as\r\n  an Indian trading-post on the Mississippi. No year has been without\r\n  its added evidences of progress, development, accumulation of wealth,\r\n  and increase in population. You have now passed any period of doubt or\r\n  uncertainty, and the career of St. Louis is assured. You have grown\r\n  like the oak, annually adding a ring to the prosperity and wealth and\r\n  commercial importance of your great city. You have struck the roots\r\n  of your influence broad and deep into the nourishing earth of this\r\n  great fertile land in which you have lived; and the branches--the\r\n  high branches of your enterprise--are reaching toward the sunlight\r\n  that shines upon them. You are situated upon the Mississippi River,\r\n  giving you water communication with the sea, a communication which\r\n  this Government has undertaken to improve and secure, and which I\r\n  believe will be made secure by appropriate legislation. [Applause.]\r\n  Nor do I know any reason why these great lines of railway stretching\r\n  from St. Louis to the Southwest may not yet touch great ports of\r\n  commerce, deep harbors, until they shall become trunk lines. We have\r\n  come to regard only these lines of railway communication to eastern\r\n  seaboards as trunk lines. I do not know why. Indeed, I believe that in\r\n  the future, when we shall have seized again, as we will seize if we\r\n  are true to ourselves, our own fair part of commerce upon the sea, and\r\n  when we shall have again our appropriate share of South American trade\r\n  [cheers], that these railroads from St. Louis, touching deep harbors\r\n  on the gulf, and communicating there with lines of steamships, shall\r\n  touch the ports of South America and bring their tribute to you. You\r\n  shall in all these things find a special interest, but an interest\r\n  that will be shared, as all great interests are, by the Nation and\r\n  people, of which you are a loyal and enterprising part. And now, my\r\n  friends, again let me thank you, and all those who have spoken in your\r\n  behalf, for these friendly words. These great industries of commerce\r\n  and manufactures here are entwined in friendly helpfulness. As they\r\n  are diversified your prosperity is increased; but under them all,\r\n  as the only secure rock upon which they can rest, is social order\r\n  and obedience to the law. Let it never be forgotten anywhere that\r\n  commerce builds only upon social order. Be watchful and careful of\r\n  every instrumentality or suggestion which puts itself against the law.\r\n  Where the law is wrong make it right. [Cries of \"Good!\" and cheering.]\r\n  Let that be the one rule of conduct in the public relations of every\r\n  American citizen. And now, my friends, again let me say thank you and\r\n  good-by.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the reception on 'Change the President, escorted\r\nby the Committee of Reception, visited the Fair Grounds and attended\r\na banquet in his honor at the Jockey Club House. In the evening the\r\ndistinguished guests visited the Exposition, where a tremendous crowd\r\ngathered. As the President entered Music Hall, Gilmore's famous band\r\nstruck up \"Hail to the Chief.\" The great audience stood and called\r\nrepeatedly for a speech. The President arose in his box and bowed\r\nseveral times; but there was no denying their demands, and Governor\r\nFrancis finally introduced his excellency, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--I have sometimes thought that the life of\r\n  the President of the United States is like that of the policeman in\r\n  the opera--not a happy one. So many cares strew his path, so many\r\n  people's welfare is to be considered, that wiser heads than mine may\r\n  well be puzzled. The attention of this mighty audience to-night has\r\n  been distracted from the concert by my entrance, not withstanding the\r\n  fact that it has a leader more a master of his art than any other on\r\n  the continent. I did not, nor do I desire to make a speech to-night.\r\n  But as I have always declared myself in favor of the rule of the\r\n  majority, I feel compelled to do so.\r\n\r\n  From early morn till late this evening the day has been one of\r\n  unalloyed pleasure to me. Every possible courtesy has been shown our\r\n  party, and we have gathered, I assure you, a most high opinion of your\r\n  people and your city. This building is in every way a credit to St.\r\n  Louis, the metropolis of the Southwest, and its exhibits do credit to\r\n  the merchants and manufacturers represented. I am glad to see that the\r\n  higher arts go hand-in-hand with mechanics. Art, music, poetry, and\r\n  song should not be separated from the homes of the poor, and such an\r\n  institution as this cannot fail to instil all that is good into the\r\n  hearts of every one. Before I close let me tell you all how grateful\r\n  and how complimented I feel at my hearty reception in your midst. I\r\n  shall always recall this day with happy remembrance. Now, won't you\r\n  crown the great courtesies of the day by allowing me to end my speech?\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, INDIANA, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison passed the Sabbath quietly at his Indianapolis\r\nresidence, and early Monday morning, accompanied by Secretary Tracy and\r\nMarshal Ransdell, started for Washington.\r\n\r\nThe first stop was at Pendleton, where the President shook hands with\r\nquite a crowd. Anderson, the county seat of Madison County, was reached\r\nat 7:10, and a large concourse of people greeted the travellers. The\r\nPresident was received by Hon. Winfield T. Durbin, Chas. T. Doxey, W. A.\r\nKittinger, John F. McClure, Caleb Brown, Jacob Koehler, Francis Watkins,\r\nA. A. Small, and other leading citizens. Mayor Terhune, in a patriotic\r\naddress, presented the Chief Executive.\r\n\r\nAfter acknowledging the cordial greeting, the President spoke of the\r\nrapid industrial development of that section consequent upon the\r\ndiscovery and development of natural gas, and predicted a fine future\r\nfor the county. Concluding, he said:\r\n\r\n  I am here to-day, returning to my duties at Washington from a trip\r\n  taken to meet some of my old comrades during the war. There are some\r\n  here this morning. I bid them God-speed; I give them a comrade's\r\n  greeting; and to you, my old-time friends, not in politics, but in\r\n  that pride and association which makes us all Indianians--we are\r\n  all proud of our State and proud of our communities--I desire to\r\n  say that while I have friends elsewhere, these were my earliest\r\n  friends--friends of my boyhood almost, for I was scarcely more than\r\n  a boy when I became a citizen of this State, and I always turn to it\r\n  with affectionate interest. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNCIE, INDIANA, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Muncie the assemblage was very large, numbering over 10,000, and the\r\nPresident received the most vociferous greeting of the day. Here, as at\r\nother points in the State, hundreds of General Harrison's old friends\r\ncrowded forth to welcome him and bid him God-speed. Prominent among\r\nthese were: Hon. Frank Ellis, Mayor of the city; Hon. M. C. Smith, Hon.\r\nJohn C. Eiler, Hon. Fred W. Heath, Hon. W. W. Orr, Hon. O. N. Cranor,\r\nHon. Geo. W. Cromer, Judge O. J. Lotz, Dr. G. W. H. Kemper, Dr. Thos.\r\nJ. Bowles, Dr. A. B. Bradbury, A. L. Kerwood, Geo. L. Lenon, F. E.\r\nPutnam, Thos. H. Kirby, Charles H. Anthony, D. H. H. Shewmaker, Theodore\r\nF. Rose, N. N. Spence, Chas. M. Kimbrough, Webster S. Richey, Thos. L.\r\nZook, John T. Watterhouse, J. W. Ream, C. E. Jones, and R. I. Patterson.\r\nMayor Ellis delivered a brief welcoming address and introduced the\r\nPresident, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have known this beautiful city of yours and\r\n  many of the people of this prosperous county for more than thirty\r\n  years. I have known in a general way the development of your interests\r\n  by almost yearly visits to the city of Muncie, but it seems to me that\r\n  in these two years I have been out of the State you have made more\r\n  progress than in any ten years when I was in the State. [Cheers.] I\r\n  think it was in the year 1886, when I spent a night in Muncie, that\r\n  my attention was drawn by some of your citizens, as darkness settled\r\n  down, to a remarkable and what was then thought to be chiefly a\r\n  curious red glow in your horizon. It was, if I recollect aright, about\r\n  the earliest development of natural gas in Indiana, and the extent of\r\n  this great field was wholly unknown. How rapidly events have crowded\r\n  each other since! You have delved into the earth and have found the\r\n  supply of this most adaptable and extraordinary fuel inexhaustible;\r\n  and what has it done for you? No longer are you transporting coal from\r\n  the distant mines to feed your furnaces. No longer are you sending the\r\n  choppers into the woods to cut your trees and haul them in, that they\r\n  may bring you winter heat and fuel. The factories have been coming\r\n  to you. This convenient heat and serviceable fuel is found in the\r\n  humblest home in Muncie. How it has added to your comfort only those\r\n  who have used it know. How much it has added to your prosperity and\r\n  development of manufactures here you have only begun to know. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  The sunlight will not more surely shed its beams on us this morning\r\n  than this great tide of prosperity which has set in through this gas\r\n  belt in Indiana shall go on increasing until all these cities and\r\n  towns within its radius are full of busy men and humming machinery.\r\n  What does all this mean? It means employment for men. It means happy\r\n  and comfortable homes for an increasing population. It means an\r\n  increased home market for the products of your farm. It means that\r\n  the farmer will have a choice of crops, and will have consumers for\r\n  perishable products of his farm at his very door. It means, if you\r\n  preserve the order of your community, if this good county of Delaware\r\n  continues to maintain its reputation as a law-abiding, liberty-loving,\r\n  free-school-loving population [cheers], that you shall have a\r\n  prosperity--an increase of riches and of human comfort that we have\r\n  scarcely conceived.\r\n\r\n  And now, my friends, all over this, and above all this, and better\r\n  than it all, let us keep in mind those higher things that make our\r\n  country great. I do not forget that your good county sent to the war\r\n  of the Union, in the gallant regiments that went from this State, a\r\n  multitude of brave men to stand by the flag. [Cheers.] Some of them\r\n  are with you to-day. [Applause.] Now let that love of the flag be\r\n  still uppermost in your hearts. Nothing has pleased me more as I\r\n  passed through some of our Western States than to see that the school\r\n  children everywhere had the starry flag in their hands. [Cheers.] Let\r\n  it be so here and everywhere. Let them learn to love it, to know its\r\n  beauty, in order that when the time of peril comes they may be ready\r\n  to defend it. [Applause.] Now to these friends, I am most grateful for\r\n  your appreciative kindness, and if I shall be able, in the discharge\r\n  of high and difficult duties, to maintain the respect and confidence\r\n  of my fellow-citizens of Indiana, other things will take care of\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINCHESTER, INDIANA, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinchester's greeting was of the most cordial character; a large share\r\nof the population of Randolph County seemed to have turned out to do\r\nthe President honor. Among the prominent citizens participating were:\r\nLeander J. Monks, Albert O. Marsh, Martin B. Miller, C. W. Moore, Dennis\r\nKelley, W. R. Way, W. E. Miller, T. F. Moorman, Albert Canfield, John\r\nR. Engle, A. C. Beeson, E. L. Watson, Thos. S. Gordon, H. P. Kizer, J.\r\nE. Watson, John T. Chenoweth, W. H. Reinheimer, B. Hawthorne, and B. W.\r\nSimmons.\r\n\r\nGen. Thomas M. Browne, on behalf of the citizens, delivered an eloquent\r\naddress of welcome, and closed by introducing President Harrison, who\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It gives me great pleasure to hear from the lips of\r\n  your honored fellow-citizen, my old-time army comrade, these words of\r\n  welcome, spoken in your behalf. I thank you and him for his assurance\r\n  that your assembling here together is without regard to difference\r\n  in belief, and as American citizens having common interests and a\r\n  common love for the flag and the Constitution. Now, to these good\r\n  people of Randolph County I render this morning my sincere thanks\r\n  for their hearty and cordial welcome. No public servant, in whatever\r\n  station, can ever be indifferent to the good esteem of men and women\r\n  and children like these. You do not know how much these kindly faces,\r\n  these friendly Indiana greetings, help me in the discharge of duties\r\n  that are not always easy.\r\n\r\n  I bid you good-by and God-speed. I do wish for Indiana and all her\r\n  people the greatest happiness that God can give. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION CITY, INDIANA, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President found another great crowd awaiting him at Union City,\r\nincluding several hundred school children, each waving a flag. Between\r\nrows of children he was escorted to the park near the station by a\r\ncommittee consisting of Hon. Theo. Shockney, B. F. Coddington, J. S.\r\nReeves, and Geo. W. Patchell. Arrived at the park he was met by James\r\nB. Ross, S. R. Bell, L. C. Huesman, J. F. Rubey, W. S. Ensign, L. D.\r\nLambert, J. B. Montani, C. S. Hardy, J. C. Platt, Judge J. W. Williams,\r\nR. G. Clark, H. H. Le Fever, H. D. Grahs, Chas. Hook, and other\r\nprominent citizens. Senator Shockney made the welcoming address. The\r\nPresident, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Senator Shockney and Fellow-citizens_--The conditions are not such\r\n  here that I can hope to make many of you hear the few words that\r\n  it is possible for me to speak to you. I have found myself in this\r\n  tour through these Western States, undertaken for the purpose of\r\n  meeting some of my comrades of the late war, who had invited me to\r\n  be with them at their annual gatherings, repeating the words \"Thank\r\n  you\" everywhere. I have felt how inadequate this word or any other\r\n  word was to express the sense of gratitude I should feel to these\r\n  friendly fellow-citizens who everywhere greeted me with kind words and\r\n  kinder faces. I feel very grateful to see you, and to realize that\r\n  if there are any fault-finders, sometimes with reason, and sometimes\r\n  without, that the great body of our people are interested only in good\r\n  government, in good administration, and that the offices shall be\r\n  filled by men who understand that they are the servants of the people,\r\n  and who serve them faithfully and well. If it were not so a President\r\n  would despair. Great as the Government is, vast as is our civil list,\r\n  it is wholly inadequate to satisfy the reasonable demands of men, and\r\n  so, from disappointment, reasonable or unreasonable, we turn with\r\n  confidence and receive with encouragement these kindly greetings from\r\n  the toilers of the country--the men and women who only ask from the\r\n  Government that it shall protect them in their lives, their property,\r\n  and their homes; that it shall encourage education, provide for these\r\n  sweet young children, so that they shall have an easier road in life\r\n  than their fathers had, and that there shall be an absence of corrupt\r\n  intent or act in the administration of public business.\r\n\r\n  And now, standing on the line which divides these two States,\r\n  the one for which I have the regard every man should feel for his\r\n  birthplace, and the other to which I owe everything I have received\r\n  in civil life or public honor, I beg to call your attention to the\r\n  fact how little State lines have to do with American life. Some of\r\n  you pay your taxes on that side of the line, some on this, but in\r\n  your intercourse, business, and social ties you cross this line\r\n  unknowingly. Above both and greater than both--above the just pride\r\n  which Ohioans have in that noble State, and above the just pride which\r\n  we have in Indiana--there floats this banner that is the common banner\r\n  of us all. We are one in citizenship; we are one in devotion to the\r\n  Government, which makes the existence of States possible and their\r\n  destruction impossible. [Cheers.] And now, to these children, to my\r\n  Grand Army friends, and to these old citizens, many of whom I have\r\n  met under other conditions, I beg to say God bless you every one, and\r\n  good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE GRAFF, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing the Ohio line a short stop was made at Sidney, where the\r\nPresident shook hands and received a delegation from Bellefontaine\r\nheaded by Judge Wm. Lawrence. At De Graff the President met with a\r\ncordial reception, especially from the school children. He was welcomed\r\nby ex-Mayor H. P. Runyon, Dr. W. W. Hamer, Dr. W. H. Hinkle, W. E.\r\nHaris, G. W. Harnish, John F. Rexer, Dr. F. M. Galer, Dr. Wm. Hance, R.\r\nO. Bigley, D. S. Spellman, D. W. Koch, Benjamin Bunker, W. H. Valentine,\r\nJ. W. Strayer, and S. E. Loffer.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Schools Joseph Swisher introduced the President, who\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very glad to see you all, and especially these\r\n  dear young children. I have been passing through a country glorious\r\n  in the autumnal tints which make a landscape that can be seen nowhere\r\n  else in the world, and yet I turn always from these decaying glories\r\n  of nature with great delight to look into the bright faces of these\r\n  happy children, where I see a greater, because immortal, glory. I\r\n  thank them for their presence here this morning. I wish their lives\r\n  may be as sunny and bright through manhood and through womanhood,\r\n  finding happiness in usefulness. I wish I had time to shake hands with\r\n  you all. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLEFONTAINE, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nBellefontaine accorded the President an enthusiastic welcome. The\r\nCommittee of Reception consisted of Dr. A. L. Wright, Mayor of the\r\ncity; Judge William Lawrence, Judge West, Judge Price, J. C. Brand, D.\r\nHennesy, Geo. W. Emerson, Aaron Gross, A. C. Elliott, A. E. Griffen, H.\r\nJ. King, J. E. West, I. N. Zearing, and J. Q. A. Campbell.\r\n\r\nMayor Wright delivered a brief welcoming address and introduced the\r\nPresident, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I wish all of you could have seen what I have\r\n  seen in this extended but hasty visit through some of the great States\r\n  of the central West, the broader view which we get as we journey\r\n  through this country of the capabilities of its soil, of the beauties\r\n  of its landscape, of the happiness of its homes, but, above all, of\r\n  the sturdy manhood of its people, can but be useful to every public\r\n  man and every patriot. [Applause.] No one can make such a journey\r\n  as we have and look into the faces of hundreds of thousands of his\r\n  fellow-citizens and see how here in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,\r\n  Kansas, and Missouri they are everywhere characterized by a sturdy\r\n  independence and intelligent thoughtfulness and manhood, and doubt\r\n  the future of this country of which they are citizens. Nothing can\r\n  shake its repose as long as this great mass of people in these homes,\r\n  on these farms, in these shops and city dwelling-places are true to\r\n  themselves and to their children. Not every one can hope to reach the\r\n  maximum of human wealth or enjoyment, but nowhere else is there so\r\n  general a diffusion of human comfort and the conveniences of life as\r\n  in this land of ours. You must not, then, show unthankfulness to the\r\n  framers of our great Constitution or to God by indulging in gloomy\r\n  forebodings or in unreasonable complaint. He has not promised that\r\n  everywhere and every season the fields should give full returns. He\r\n  has promised that the food of man should not fail, and where else\r\n  is famine unknown? Other countries have now and then appealed for\r\n  philanthropic help from abroad to feed their population, greater or\r\n  less. The United States has always a surplus after its people are fed,\r\n  and for this we should be thankful. I have been told everywhere that\r\n  though crops in some respects and in some places have been short, the\r\n  general prosperity is very great. Everywhere I have been told that no\r\n  wheel is idle, and that no hand is idle that seeks employment that\r\n  honest bread may come to his household. I believe that we are on an\r\n  upward grade of prosperity, if we will be brave and hopeful and true,\r\n  that shall lead us perhaps to a development and an increase of wealth\r\n  we have never before attained. And now, my fellow-citizens, thanking\r\n  you for this friendly morning greeting, I bid you good-by. [Applause.]\r\n  Let me have the pleasure, however, of introducing to you my valued\r\n  associate at Washington--Secretary Tracy. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRESTLINE, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Crestline honored the President with a large assembly,\r\nprominent among whom were: Mayor P. W. Pool, Hon. Daniel Babst, John\r\nG. Barney, Alexander Hall, B. F. Miller, John Whittle, John F. Castle,\r\nC. F. Frank, Dr. W. P. Bennett, L. G. Russell, A. Howorth, G. B.\r\nThrailkill, E. S. Bagley, D. L. Zink, J. P. Davis, T. P. Kerr, W. R.\r\nBoyd, E. W. Hadley, Samuel Gee, C. C. Hall, D. S. Patterson, and Richard\r\nYoungblood.\r\n\r\nMayor Pool welcomed and introduced the President in a brief address.\r\nGeneral Harrison responded:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--Already some seven or eight times this\r\n  morning, beginning before breakfast, I have been called upon to talk\r\n  briefly to my fellow-citizens who have gathered at the various points\r\n  where we made brief stops at their request. The story I must tell\r\n  you is the same old story I have been telling them--that I am very\r\n  grateful for your friendly expressions and presence; very grateful for\r\n  the kindliness which speaks through those who address me, and for the\r\n  kindness which appears in all your faces. It is pleasant to know that\r\n  as against all enemies of our country we are one, that we have great\r\n  pride, just pride in our birthright as American citizens, just pride\r\n  in the country of our adoption as to those who have found a home here\r\n  with us. It is the people's land more than any other country in the\r\n  world. Mr. Lincoln felicitously expressed it to be a \"government of\r\n  the people, by the people, for the people.\" [Applause.] They originate\r\n  it; they perpetuate it. If it does not miss its purpose it is\r\n  administered for their good. [Applause.] And so to you upon whom the\r\n  burden of citizenship now rests, you who have the care of these homes\r\n  and the responsibilities of womanhood; to these lads who will soon be\r\n  citizens, and to these girls who are coming on to womanhood, to all I\r\n  express my thanks for your friendly greeting. [Applause.] To every one\r\n  of you I wish the most abundant success; that every home represented\r\n  here may be a typical American home, in which morality and purity and\r\n  love sit as the crowning virtues and are household gods. Our country\r\n  is prosperous, though not all have attained this year the measure of\r\n  success which they had hoped for. If there was any shortness of crops\r\n  anywhere, already the fields are green with the promise of another\r\n  year. Let our hearts be hopeful, let us be faithful and true, and the\r\n  future of our country and our own comfort are assured. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANSFIELD, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Mansfield, the home of Senator Sherman, a large assemblage greeted\r\nthe President, prominent among whom was the distinguished Senator, and\r\nHon. Henry C. Hedges, Frank W. Pierson, J. M. Waugh, Frank K. Tracy,\r\nMaj. Joseph S. Hedges, Hon. W. S. Kerr, J. R. Brown, Nelson Ozier, Capt.\r\nW. S. Bradford, Hon. W. S. Cappeller, Hon. W. M. Hahn, Capt. Joseph\r\nBrown, G. U. Harn, Maj. W. W. Smith, Geo. C. Wise, Judge Jas. E. Lowry,\r\nJames McCoy, John Crum, Ried Carpenter, and Wm. C. Hedges, Jr.\r\n\r\nSenator Sherman introduced the President, who spoke briefly, saying:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We stop so frequently upon this journey and\r\n  our time at each station is so brief, that I cannot hope to say\r\n  anything that would be interesting or instructive. I thank you most\r\n  sincerely for these friendly manifestations. I am glad to be permitted\r\n  to stop at the home of your distinguished Senator and my friend.\r\n  [Cheers.] I am sure, however you may differ from him in political\r\n  opinion, the people of Mansfield and of Ohio are proud of the eminence\r\n  which he has attained in the counsels of the Nation and of the\r\n  distinguished service he has been able to render to his country not\r\n  only in Congress but in the Treasury Department. [Cheers.] He is twin\r\n  in greatness with that military brother who led some of you, as he did\r\n  me, in some of the great campaigns of the war, and they have together\r\n  rendered conspicuous services to this country, which we, as they, love\r\n  with devoted affection. We have so many common interests and so much\r\n  genuine friendliness among the American people that except in the very\r\n  heat and ardor of a political campaign the people are kind to each\r\n  other, and we soon forget the rancor of these political debates. We\r\n  ought never to forget that we are American citizens; we ought never to\r\n  forget that we are put in charge of American interests, and that it\r\n  is our duty to defend them. [Applause.] Thanking you again for your\r\n  presence and kindliness, I bid you good-by. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOSTER, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Wooster, the seat of the well-known university, the presidential\r\nparty received a rousing greeting, especially from the students with\r\ntheir college cry. At the head of the Committee of Reception was the\r\nvenerable Professor Stoddard, formerly professor of chemistry at Miami\r\nUniversity when Benjamin Harrison attended that institute. Among other\r\nprominent townsmen who received the President were: Hon. M. L. Smyser,\r\nHon. A. S. McClure, Jacob Frick, Col. C. V. Hard, Capt. Harry McClarran,\r\nDr. John A. Gann, Dr. R. N. Warren, Capt. R. E. Eddy, Lieut. W. H.\r\nWoodland, W. O. Beebe, Dr. J. D. Robison, Wm. Annat, John C. Hall, Enos\r\nPierson, R. J. Smith, Samuel Metzler, Geo. W. Reed, C. W. McClure, A. G.\r\nCoover, A. M. Parish, Anthony Wright, Abram Plank, J. S. R. Overholt,\r\nJesse McClellan, David Nice, Andrew Branstetter, Charles Landam, Wm. F.\r\nKane, Capt. Lemuel Jeffries, Sylvester F. Scovel, D.D., O. A. Hills,\r\nD.D., Jas. M. Quinby, R. W. Funck, and Harry Heuffstot.\r\n\r\nCongressman Smyser introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--If anything could relieve the sense of\r\n  weariness which is ordinarily incident to extended railroad travel,\r\n  it would be the exceeding kindness with which we have been everywhere\r\n  received by our fellow-citizens, and to look upon an audience like\r\n  that assembled here, composed in part of venerable men who experienced\r\n  the hardships of early life in Ohio, of some of those venerable women\r\n  who shared those labors and self-denials of early life in the West,\r\n  and in part of their sons, that gallant second generation, who, in the\r\n  time of the Nation's peril in 1861, sprang to its defence and brought\r\n  the flag home in honor [applause], and in part of these young men here\r\n  undergoing that discipline of mind which is to fit them for useful\r\n  American citizenship, full of the ambitions of early manhood, and, I\r\n  trust, rooted in the principles of morality and loyalty [applause],\r\n  and in part of these sweet-faced children, coming from your schools\r\n  and homes to brighten with their presence this graver assembly. Where\r\n  else in the world could such a gathering be assembled? Where else so\r\n  much social order as here? The individual free to aspire and work,\r\n  the community its own police officer and guardian.\r\n\r\n  We are here as American citizens, having, first, duties to our\r\n  families, then to our neighborhood--to the institutions and business\r\n  with which we are connected--but above all, and through and by all\r\n  these duties, to our country and to God, by whose beneficial guidance\r\n  our Government was founded, by whose favor and protection it has\r\n  been preserved. [Applause.] Friendly to all peoples of the world, we\r\n  will not thwart their course or provoke quarrels by unfriendly acts,\r\n  neither will we be forgetful of the fact that we are charged here\r\n  first with the conservation and promotion of American interests, and\r\n  that our Government was founded for its own citizenship. [Applause\r\n  and cheers.] But I cannot speak at further length. I must hurry on to\r\n  other places, where kind people are impatiently awaiting our coming,\r\n  and to duties which will be assumed and undertaken with more courage\r\n  since I have so often looked into the kind faces of the people whom\r\n  I endeavor to serve. [Applause.] Let me present to you now, and I do\r\n  so with great pleasure, one of the gentlemen called by me under the\r\n  Constitution to assist in the administration of the Government--one\r\n  whom I know you have learned to love and honor as you are now\r\n  privileged to know--Gen. Benjamin F. Tracy, the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORRVILLE, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Orrville, Wayne County, it was not contemplated to stop; but so large\r\nand enthusiastic was the crowd the President held a brief reception.\r\nAmong the prominent townsmen who welcomed him were: A. H. Walkey, S.\r\nN. Coe, A. E. Clark, J. W. Hostetter, A. Dennison, N. S. Brice, D. J.\r\nLuikheim, and John Trout.\r\n\r\nIn response to repeated cries of \"speech,\" the President said:\r\n\"Fellow-citizens--The American people are very kind\"--at this point the\r\ntrain started, and the President closed abruptly by saying-\"and I feel\r\nsure that they will here excuse my failure to make a speech.\" There were\r\nloud shouts of laughter at the President's readiness as the train pulled\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSILLON, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Massillon several thousand people assembled and great enthusiasm\r\nprevailed. The Committee of Reception consisted of Hon. William M. Reed,\r\nMayor of the city; Prof. E. A. Jones, Hon. J. Walter McClymonds, Hon. S.\r\nA. Conrad, William F. Ricks, Clement Russell, and Joseph Grapevine, Esq.\r\nThe Grand Army veterans and school children were present in force. Mayor\r\nReed made the welcoming address.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--The burden of obligation connected\r\n  with this visit is put upon me by the enthusiasm and magnitude of this\r\n  welcome which you have extended to me. It gives me pleasure to stop\r\n  for a brief moment in a city widely celebrated for its industries, and\r\n  among a people widely celebrated for their virtues and intelligence.\r\n  [Cheers.] It was especially gratifying as we passed in your suburbs,\r\n  one of these busy hives of industry, to see upon the bank, waving\r\n  with hearty cheers, the operatives in their work-day clothes. It is\r\n  of great interest to know that you have these diversified industries\r\n  among you. Your lot would be unhappy and not prosperous if you were\r\n  all pursuing the same calling, even if it were the calling to which I\r\n  belong, the profession of the law. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  It is well that your interchanging industries and pursuits lean upon\r\n  and help each other, increasing and making possible indeed the great\r\n  prosperity which you enjoy. I hope it is true here that everybody is\r\n  getting a fair return for his labor. We cannot afford in America to\r\n  have any discontented classes, and if fair wages are paid for fair\r\n  work we will have none. [Cheers.] I am not one of those who believe\r\n  that cheapness is the highest good. I am not one of those who believe\r\n  that it can be to my interest, or to yours, to purchase in the market\r\n  anything below the price that pays to the men who make it fair living\r\n  wages. [Great cheering.] We should all \"live and let live\" in this\r\n  country. [Cheers.] Our strength, our promise for the future, our\r\n  security for social happiness are in the contentment of the great\r\n  masses who toil. It is in kindly intercourse and relationship between\r\n  capital and labor, each having its appropriate increase, that we\r\n  shall find the highest good, the capitalist and employer everywhere\r\n  extending to those who work for human rights a kindly consideration\r\n  with compensatory wages. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Now, to these children and Grand Army friends who greet me here, I\r\n  say, thank you and God speed you and good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTON, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanton, the home of Hon. William McKinley, Jr., gave the President\r\na most cordial and clamorous greeting. The G. A. R. and other\r\norganizations were out in full force. Among the leading citizens who\r\nwelcomed the Chief Executive were: W. K. Miller, W. L. Alexander, Judge\r\nJ. P. Fawcett, J. M. Campbell, Judge J. W. Underhill, Andrew D. Braden,\r\nCol. J. E. Dougherty, Col. J. J. Clark, N. Holloway, and Capt. C. T.\r\nOldfield.\r\n\r\nMajor McKinley introduced the President, who addressed the large\r\nassemblage, saying:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--The inconvenience which you suffer to-day,\r\n  and under which I labor in attempting to speak to you, comes from the\r\n  fact that there are more of you here than can come within the range\r\n  of my voice, but not more, I assure you, my fellow-citizens, than I\r\n  can take and do take most hospitably in my regard. [Cheers.] It gives\r\n  me great pleasure to stand here in the prosperous and growing city\r\n  of Canton. I am glad to be at the home of one with whom I have been\r\n  associated in Congressional duties for a number of years, and who in\r\n  all personal relations with me, as I believe in all personal relations\r\n  with you, his neighbors, has won my regard, as I am sure he has won\r\n  yours [cheers]; and without any regard to what may be thought of the\r\n  McKinley bill, I am sure here to-day you are all the good neighbors\r\n  and friends of William McKinley. [Cheers.] Kind-hearted and generous\r\n  as he seems to me, I am sure he has not failed in these social\r\n  relations, whatever judgment you may have of his political opinions,\r\n  in making the masses of the people proud of him as their distinguished\r\n  friend. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  You have here to-day the representatives of men from the shops,\r\n  from the railroads, from the stores, from the offices of your city.\r\n  You are living together in those helpful and interchanging relations\r\n  which make American life pleasant and which make American cities\r\n  prosperous. The foundation of our society is in the motto that every\r\n  man shall have such wages as will enable him to live decently and\r\n  comfortably, and rear his children as helpful and safe and useful\r\n  American citizens. [Cheers.] We all desire, I am sure--every kindly\r\n  heart--that all the relations between employers and workmen shall be\r\n  friendly and kind. I wish everywhere the associations were closer and\r\n  employers more thoughtful of those who work for them. I am sure there\r\n  is one thing in which we all agree, whatever our views may be on the\r\n  tariff or finance, and that is, there is no prosperity that in the\r\n  wide, liberal sense does not embrace within it every deserving and\r\n  industrious man and woman in the community. [Cheers.] We are here all\r\n  responsible citizens, and we should all be free from anything that\r\n  detracts from our liberties and independence, or that retards the\r\n  development of our intelligence, morality, and patriotism.\r\n\r\n  I am glad here to speak to some, too, who were comrades in the great\r\n  struggle of the Civil War [cheers]; glad that there are here soldiers\r\n  who had part in that great success by which our institutions were\r\n  preserved and the control and sovereignty of the Constitution and law\r\n  were forever established. [Cheers.] To them, and to all such friends,\r\n  I extend to-day a hearty greeting, and would if I could extend a\r\n  comrade's hand. [Cheers.] And now, my friends, the heat of this day,\r\n  the exhaustion of a dozen speeches, made at intervals as we have come\r\n  along, renders it impossible that I should speak to you longer. I beg\r\n  to thank you all for your presence. I beg to hope that, as American\r\n  citizens, however we differ about particular matters of legislation or\r\n  administration, we are all pledged, heart and soul, life and property,\r\n  to the preservation of the Union and to the honor of our glorious\r\n  flag. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALLIANCE, OHIO, OCTOBER 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Alliance the assembly was very large. A Reception Committee, headed\r\nby Mayor J. M. Stillwell and comprising the following leading citizens,\r\nmet the President: Hon. David Fording, H. W. Harris, T. R. Morgan, Wm.\r\nBrinker, Madison Trail, Dr. J. H. Tressel, H. W. Brush, W. H. Morgan,\r\nThos. Brocklebank, Chas. Ott, Dr. W. P. Preston, E. N. Johnston, J. H.\r\nFocht, W. H. Ramsey, W. W. Webb, E. E. Scranton, Henry Heer, Jr., and\r\nHarper Brosius.\r\n\r\nChairman Fording delivered a welcoming address and introduced President\r\nHarrison, who in response said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--There is nothing in which the American people\r\n  are harder upon their public servants than in the insatiable demand\r\n  they make for public speech. I began talking before breakfast this\r\n  morning, and have been kept almost continuously at it through the\r\n  day, with scarcely time for lunch; and yet, as long as the smallest\r\n  residuum of strength or voice is left I cannot fail to recognize these\r\n  hearty greetings and to say some appreciative word in return. I do\r\n  very much thank you, and I do very deeply feel the cordial enthusiasm\r\n  with which you have received me. It is very pleasant to know that\r\n  as American citizens we love our Government and its institutions,\r\n  and are all ready to pay appropriate respect to any public officer\r\n  who endeavors in such light as he has to do his public duty. This\r\n  homage is not withheld by one's political opponents, and it is\r\n  pleasant to know that in all things that affect the integrity and\r\n  honor and perpetuity of our Government we rise above party ties and\r\n  considerations. The interests of this Government are lodged with you.\r\n  There is not much that a President can do to shape its policy. He is\r\n  charged under the Constitution with the duty of making suggestions to\r\n  Congress, but, after all, legislation originates with the Congress of\r\n  the United States, and the policy of our laws is directed by it. The\r\n  President may veto, but he cannot frame a bill. Therefore it is of\r\n  great interest to you, and to all our people, that you should choose\r\n  such men to represent you in the Congress of the United States as\r\n  will faithfully promote those policies to which you have given your\r\n  intelligent adhesion. This country of ours is secure, and social\r\n  order is maintained, because the great masses of our people live in\r\n  contentment and some good measure of comfort. God forbid that we\r\n  should ever reach the condition which has been reached by some other\r\n  countries, where all that is before many of their population is the\r\n  question of bare subsistence, where it is simply \"how shall I find\r\n  bread for to-day?\" No hopes of accumulation; no hope of comfort; no\r\n  hope of education, or higher things for the children that are to come\r\n  after them. God be blessed that that is not our condition in America!\r\n  Here is a chance to every man; here fair wages for fair work, with\r\n  education for the masses, with no classes or distinctions to keep down\r\n  the ambitious young. We have a happy lot. Let us not grumble if now\r\n  and then things are not prosperous as they might be. Let us think of\r\n  the average, and if this year's crop is not as full as we could wish,\r\n  we have already in these green fields the promise of a better one to\r\n  come. Let us not doubt that we are now--as I have seen the evidence of\r\n  it in a very extended trip through the West--entering upon an up grade\r\n  in all departments of business. [Cheers.] Everywhere I went, in the\r\n  great city of St. Louis and the smaller manufacturing towns through\r\n  which we passed, there was one story to tell--and I have no doubt it\r\n  is true in your midst--every wheel is running and every hand is busy.\r\n  [Cheers.] I believe the future is bright before us for increasingly\r\n  better times for all, and as it comes I hope it may be so generally\r\n  diffused that its kindly touch may be felt by every one who hears me,\r\n  and that its beneficent help may come into every home. [Prolonged\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, APRIL 14, 1891.\r\n\r\n_Letter to Western States Commercial Congress._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Western States Commercial Congress met at Kansas City, Mo.,\r\nApril 14, 1891. Delegations composed mainly of business men, appointed\r\nby the Governors of the various States and Territories, were present\r\nfrom the following Western and Southern States and Territories: Alabama,\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nKentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,\r\nMontana, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, Wyoming, New\r\nMexico, and Oklahoma. On motion of Governor Francis, of Missouri, State\r\nSenator H. B. Kelly, of Kansas, was chosen Chairman of the Congress and\r\nHon. John W. Springer, of Illinois, Secretary. Letters of regret were\r\nread from those who had been specially invited to attend the Congress.\r\nAmong the letters was the following from President Harrison:\r\n\r\n                                           WASHINGTON, April 7.\r\n  HON. H. B. KELLY, _Chairman, Kansas City, Mo._:\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter\r\n  of March 24, inviting me to attend the meeting of the commercial\r\n  congress of the Western agricultural and mining States, to assemble in\r\n  Kansas City, April 14 to 19, for the purpose of considering measures\r\n  affecting the general agricultural and business prosperity of the\r\n  Mississippi Valley States. I regret that it will not be possible for\r\n  me to accept this invitation. If I am not detained here by public\r\n  business I shall probably start about that time for the Pacific coast\r\n  by the Southern route; and if that purpose should be thwarted it will\r\n  be by considerations that will also prevent the acceptance of your\r\n  invitation.\r\n\r\n  A public discussion of the conditions affecting agricultural and\r\n  business prosperity cannot but be helpful, if it is conducted on broad\r\n  lines and is hospitable to differences of opinion. The extraordinary\r\n  development of the productions of agriculture which has taken place\r\n  in a recent period in this country by reason of the rapid enlargement\r\n  of the area of tillage under the favoring land laws of the United\r\n  States, very naturally has called attention to the value, and, indeed,\r\n  the necessity of larger markets. I am one of those who believe that\r\n  a home market is necessarily the best market for the producer, as\r\n  it measurably emancipates him in proportion to its nearness from\r\n  the exactions of the transportation companies. If the farmer could\r\n  deliver his surplus produce to the consumer out of his farm-wagon\r\n  his independence and his profits would be larger and surer. It seems\r\n  to me quite possible to attain a largely increased market for our\r\n  staple farm products without impairing our home market by opening the\r\n  manufacturing trades to a competition in which foreign producers,\r\n  paying a lower scale of wages, would have the advantage. A policy that\r\n  would reduce the number of our people engaged in mechanical pursuits\r\n  or diminish their ability to purchase food products by reducing wages\r\n  cannot be helpful to those now engaged in agriculture. The farmers\r\n  insist that the prices of farm products have been too low--below the\r\n  point of fair living and fair profits. I think so too, but I venture\r\n  to remind them that the plea they make involves the concession that\r\n  things may be too cheap. A coat may be too cheap as well as corn.\r\n  The farmer who claims a good living and profits for his work should\r\n  concede the same to every other man and woman who toils.\r\n\r\n  I look with great confidence to the completion of further reciprocal\r\n  trade arrangements, especially with the Central and South American\r\n  states, as furnishing new and large markets for meats, breadstuffs,\r\n  and an important line of manufactured products. Persistent and earnest\r\n  efforts are also being made, and a considerable measure of success has\r\n  already been attained, to secure the removal of restrictions which we\r\n  have regarded as unjust upon the admission and use of our meats and\r\n  live cattle in some of the European countries. I look with confidence\r\n  to a successful termination of the pending negotiations, because I\r\n  cannot but assume that when the absolutely satisfactory character of\r\n  the sanitary inspections now provided by our law is made known to\r\n  those foreign states they will promptly relax their discriminating\r\n  regulations. No effort and none of the powers vested in the Executive\r\n  will be left unused to secure an end which is so desirable.\r\n\r\n  Your deliberations will probably also embrace consideration of the\r\n  question of the volume and character of our currency. It will not be\r\n  possible and would not be appropriate for me in this letter to enter\r\n  upon any elaborate discussion of these questions. One or two things\r\n  I will say, and first, I believe that every person who thoughtfully\r\n  considers the question will agree with me upon a proposition which is\r\n  at the base of all my consideration of the currency question, namely,\r\n  that any dollar, paper or coin, that is issued by the United States\r\n  must be made and kept in its commercial uses as good as any other\r\n  dollar. So long as any paper money issued or authorized by the United\r\n  States Government is accepted in commercial use as the equivalent of\r\n  the best coined dollar that we issue, and so long as every coined\r\n  dollar, whether of silver or gold, is assured of an equivalent value\r\n  in commercial use, there need be no fear as to an excess of money. The\r\n  more such money the better. But, on the other hand, when any issue of\r\n  paper or coined dollars is, in buying and selling, rated at a less\r\n  value than other paper or coined dollars, we have passed the limit of\r\n  safe experiment in finance. If we have dollars of differing values,\r\n  only the poorest will circulate. The farmer and the laborer, who are\r\n  not in hourly touch with the ticker of the telegraph, will require,\r\n  above all other classes of our community, a dollar of full value.\r\n  Fluctuations and depreciations are always at the first cost of these\r\n  classes of our community. The banker and the speculator anticipate,\r\n  discount, and often profit by such fluctuations. It is very easy,\r\n  under the impulse of excitement of the stress of money stringency, to\r\n  fall into the slough of a depreciated or irredeemable currency. It is\r\n  a very painful and slow business to get out when once in.\r\n\r\n  I have always believed, and do now more than ever believe, in\r\n  bimetallism, and favor the fullest use of silver in connection with\r\n  our currency that is compatible with the maintenance of the parity\r\n  of the gold and silver dollars in their commercial uses. Nothing, in\r\n  my judgment, would so much retard the restoration of the free use of\r\n  silver by the commercial nations of the world as legislation adopted\r\n  by us that would result in placing this country upon a basis of\r\n  silver monometallism. The legislation adopted by the first session\r\n  of the Fifty-first Congress I was assured by leading advocates of\r\n  free coinage--representatives of the silver States--would promptly\r\n  and permanently bring silver to $1.29 per ounce and keep it there.\r\n  That anticipation has not been realized. Our larger use of silver has\r\n  apparently, and for reasons not yet agreed upon, diminished the demand\r\n  for silver in China and India.\r\n\r\n  In view of the fact that it is impossible in this letter to\r\n  elaborate, and that propositions only can be stated, I am aware\r\n  that what I have said may be assailed in points where it is easily\r\n  defensible, but where I have not attempted to present the argument.\r\n\r\n  I have not before, excepting in an official way, expressed myself\r\n  on these subjects; but feeling the interest, dignity, and importance\r\n  of the assemblage in whose behalf you speak, I have ventured, without\r\n  bigotry of opinion, without any assumption of infallibility, but as an\r\n  American citizen, having a most earnest desire that every individual\r\n  and every public act of my life shall conduce to the glory of our\r\n  country and the prosperity of all our people, to submit these views\r\n  for your consideration.\r\n\r\n          Very respectfully,                     BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS THE CONTINENT, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison started on his memorable journey to Texas and\r\nthe Pacific Coast States at 12:15 o'clock Tuesday morning, April\r\n14, 1891. The party consisted of the President and Mrs. Harrison,\r\nPostmaster-General John Wanamaker, Secretary of Agriculture J. M. Rusk,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Russell B. Harrison, Mrs. J. R. McKee, Mrs. Dimmick, Maj.\r\nJ. P. Sanger, Military Aid to the President, Marshal Daniel M. Ransdell,\r\nMr. and Mrs. Geo. W. Boyd, Mr. E. F. Tibbott, stenographer to the\r\nPresident, and Alfred J. Clark, O. P. Austin, and R. Y. Oulahan, press\r\nrepresentatives. At Chattanooga the party was joined by the President's\r\nyounger brother, Mr. Carter B. Harrison, and wife, and at Los Angeles by\r\nMr. C. L. Saunders.\r\n\r\nThe train that safely carried the head of the Nation on this great tour\r\nwas a marvel of mechanical perfection unrivalled in equipment. Mr. Geo.\r\nW. Boyd, General Assistant Passenger Agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad,\r\nprepared the schedule and had charge of the train throughout.\r\n\r\nNo predecessor of President Harrison ever attempted the great task of\r\ntravelling 10,000 miles, or delivering 140 impromptu addresses within\r\nthe limit of 30 days--an achievement remarkable in many respects. His\r\nlong-extended itinerary was an almost continuous series of receptions\r\nand responses, and there is no instance where any man in public life,\r\nsubjected to the requirements of a similar hospitable ordeal, has\r\nacquitted himself with greater dignity, tact, and good sense both as\r\nto the matter and manner of his utterances. This series of speeches is\r\nin marked contrast with his incisive utterances during the campaign of\r\n1888, and disclose General Harrison's ability to seize the vital topic\r\nof the moment and present it to a mixed audience in such a way that\r\nwhile consistent with his own record he yet raises no antagonisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROANOKE, VIRGINIA, APRIL 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Washington shortly after midnight, the train passed through\r\nLynchburg at an early hour and arrived at Roanoke, its first\r\nstopping-point, at 8:50 A.M. Seemingly the entire population of the\r\nenterprising city was out to welcome the President to Old Virginia.\r\nProminent among those who greeted the party were Mr. and Mrs. Charles G.\r\nEddy, W. B. Bevill, John A. Pack, Allen Hull, A. S. Asberry, and John D.\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking hands with several hundred, President Harrison, in\r\nresponse to repeated calls, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I desire to thank you very sincerely for\r\n  this friendly greeting. The State of Virginia is entitled, I think,\r\n  to high estimation among the States for its great history--for the\r\n  contribution it has made to the great story of our common country.\r\n  This fact you discovered, I think, long ago. For personal reasons I\r\n  have great affection for Virginia. It is the State of my fathers. I am\r\n  glad this morning to congratulate you upon the marvellous development\r\n  which has come, and the greater which is coming, to your commonwealth.\r\n\r\n  You not only have an illustrious story behind you, but before you\r\n  prospects of development in wealth and prosperity, in all that makes a\r\n  great State, such as never entered into the imagination of those who\r\n  laid the foundation of the commonwealth. [Cheers.] You are arousing\r\n  now to a realization of the benefits of diversity of industries.\r\n\r\n  In the olden time Virginia was a plantation State. I hope she may\r\n  never cease to have large agricultural interests. It is the foundation\r\n  of stable society, but I rejoice with you that she has added to\r\n  agriculture the mining of coal and iron, and, bringing these from\r\n  their beds, is producing all the products that enter into the uses of\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  In this is the secret of that great growth illustrating what I see\r\n  about me here, and the promise of a future which none of us can fully\r\n  realize. In all of these things we have a common interest, and I beg\r\n  to assure you that in everything that tends to the social order of\r\n  your people and the development and increased prosperity of the State\r\n  of Virginia I am in most hearty sympathy with you all. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRISTOL, TENNESSEE, APRIL 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Radford, Va., acknowledged the honor of the President's\r\nvisit in a cordial way. General Harrison shook hands with many of the\r\ninhabitants. At Bristol, Tenn., a crowd of several thousand greeted\r\nthe party at the station. The President was met and escorted to a high\r\nbluff overlooking the city by Hon. Harvey C. Wood, at the head of the\r\nfollowing committee of prominent citizens: Col. E. C. Manning, Hon. I.\r\nC. Fowler, Judge M. B. Wood, A. S. McNeil, W. A. Sparger, A. C. Smith,\r\nC. H. Slack, Rockingham Paul, Esq., Capt. J. H. Wood, Judge C. J. St.\r\nJohn, Col. Nat M. Taylor, and John H. Caldwell.\r\n\r\nJudge Wood made the welcoming address and introduced the President, who,\r\nin response, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have found not only pleasure but instruction\r\n  in riding to-day through a portion of the State of Virginia that is\r\n  feeling in a very striking way the impulse of a new development. It\r\n  is extremely gratifying to notice that those hidden sources of wealth\r\n  which were so long unobserved and so long unused are now being found,\r\n  and that these regions, once so retired, occupied by a pastoral\r\n  people, having difficult access to the centres of population, are\r\n  now being rapidly transformed into busy manufacturing and commercial\r\n  centres.\r\n\r\n  In the early settlement of this city the emigrants poured over the\r\n  Alleghanies and the Blue Ridge like waters over an obstructing ledge,\r\n  seeking the fertile and attractive farm regions of the great West.\r\n  They passed unobserved these marvellous hidden stores of wealth which\r\n  are now being brought into use. Having filled those great basins of\r\n  the West, they are now turning back to Virginia and West Virginia and\r\n  Tennessee to bring about a development and production for which the\r\n  time is ripe, and which will surprise the world. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It has not been long since every implement of iron, domestic,\r\n  agricultural, and mechanical, was made in other States. The iron\r\n  point of the wooden mould-board plough with which the early farmers\r\n  here turned the soil came from distant States. But now Virginia and\r\n  Tennessee are stirring their energies to participate in a large degree\r\n  in mechanical productions and in the great awakening of American\r\n  influence which will lift the Nation to a place among the nations of\r\n  the world never before attained. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  What hinders us, secure in the market of our own great population,\r\n  from successful competition in the markets of the world? What hinders\r\n  our people, possessing every element of material wealth and endowed\r\n  with inventive genius and energy unsurpassed, from having again upon\r\n  the seas a merchant marine flying the flag of our country and carrying\r\n  its commerce into every sea and every port?\r\n\r\n  I am glad to stand for this moment among you, glad to express my\r\n  sympathy with you in every enterprise that tends to develop your\r\n  State and local communities; glad to stand with you upon the one\r\n  common platform of respect to the Constitution and the law, differing\r\n  in our policies as to what the law should be, but pledged with a\r\n  common devotion and obedience to law as the majority shall by their\r\n  expressions make it.\r\n\r\n  I shall carry away from here a new impulse to public duty, a new\r\n  inspiration as a citizen with you of a country whose greatness is\r\n  only dawning. And may I now express the pleasure I shall have in\r\n  every good that comes to you as a community and to each of you as\r\n  individuals? May peace, prosperity, and social order dwell in your\r\n  communities, and the fear and love of God in every home! [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON CITY, TENNESSEE, APRIL 14. 1891\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President was welcomed at Johnson City by 3,000 people. S. K. N.\r\nPatton Post, G. A. R, with Maj. A. Cantwell, J. M. Erwin, and W. Hodges,\r\nacted as a guard of honor to the Chief Magistrate. The committee to\r\nreceive and entertain the President comprised: Mayor Ike T. Jobe, Hon.\r\nW. G. Mathes, President Board of Trade; Hon. T. F. Singiser, Hon. A.\r\nB. Bowman, Hon. B. F. Childress, Thos. E. Matson, Jas. M. Martin, J.\r\nC. Campbell, H. C. Chandler, J. W. Cox, C. W. Marsh, L. W. Wood, J.\r\nA. Mathes, H. W. Hargraves, J. F. Crumley, M. N. Johnson, and W. W.\r\nKirkpatrick.\r\n\r\nCongressman Alfred A. Taylor presented the President, who spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--The office of President of the United States\r\n  is one of very high honor and is also one of very high responsibility.\r\n  No man having conscientiously at heart the good of the whole people,\r\n  whose interests are, under the law, in some degree committed to his\r\n  care, can fail to feel a most oppressive sense of inadequacy when he\r\n  comes to the discharge of these high functions.\r\n\r\n  Elected under a system of government which gives to the majority\r\n  of our people who have expressed their wishes through constitutional\r\n  methods the right to choose their public servants, when he has taken\r\n  the oath that inducts him into office he becomes the servant of all\r\n  the people, and while he may pursue the advocacy of those measures to\r\n  which the people have given their approval by his choice, he should\r\n  always act and speak with a reserve and a respect for the opinion\r\n  of others that shall not alienate from him the good-will of his\r\n  fellow-citizens, without regard to political belief.\r\n\r\n  I shall not speak of what has been done, but I have a supreme regard\r\n  for the honor of the Nation, a profound respect for the Constitution,\r\n  and a most sincere desire to meet the just expectations of my\r\n  fellow-citizens. I am not one of those who believe that the good of\r\n  any class can be permanently and largely attained except upon lines\r\n  which promote the good of all our people.\r\n\r\n  I rejoice in the Union of the States. I rejoice to stand here\r\n  in East Tennessee among a people who so conspicuously and at such\r\n  sacrifice during the hour of the Nation's peril stood by the flag\r\n  and adhered to their convictions of public duty [cheers]; and I am\r\n  especially glad to be able to say that those who, following other\r\n  views of duty, took sides against us in that struggle, without\r\n  division in voice or heart to-day praise Almighty God that He\r\n  preserved us one Nation. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  There is no man, whatever his views upon the questions that then\r\n  divided us, but, in view of the marvellous benefits which are\r\n  disseminating themselves over these States, must also bless God to-day\r\n  that slavery no longer exists and that the Union of free States is\r\n  indissoluble. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  What is it that has stirred the public of this great region, that\r\n  has kindled these furnace fires, that has converted these retired and\r\n  isolated farms upon which you and your ancestors dwelt into centres\r\n  of trade and mechanical pursuits, bringing a market close to the door\r\n  of the farmer and bringing prosperity into every home? It is that we\r\n  have no line of division between the States; it is that these impulses\r\n  of freedom and enterprise, once limited in their operations, are now\r\n  common in all the States. We have a common heritage. The Confederate\r\n  soldier has a full, honorable, and ungrudged participation in all the\r\n  benefits of a great and just Government. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I do not doubt to-day that these would be among the readiest of our\r\n  population to follow the old flag if it should be assailed from any\r\n  quarter. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Now, my fellow-countrymen, I can pause but a moment with you. It\r\n  does me good to look into your faces, to receive these evidences of\r\n  your good-will. I hope I may have guidance and courage in such time as\r\n  remains to me in public life conscientiously to serve the public good\r\n  and the common glory of our beloved country. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJONESBORO, TENNESSEE, APRIL 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jonesboro, the oldest city in Tennessee and the ancient capital\r\nof the State of Franklin, the President was the recipient of a most\r\ncordial welcome. All the residents of the town seemed to be present.\r\nAmong the prominent citizens who participated in the greeting were:\r\nMayor I. E. Reeves, Judge Newton Hacker, R. M. May, Col. T. H. Reeves,\r\nA. J. Patterson, S. H. Anderson, Capt. A. S. Deaderick, James H. Epps,\r\nJacob Leab, S. H. L. Cooper, Judge A. J. Brown, John D. Cox, E. H. West,\r\nJ. A. Febuary, T. B. Hacker, R. N. Dosser, Capt. Geo. McPherson, and\r\nChancellor J. P. Smith.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison's allusion to John Sevier and his struggle to establish\r\nthe State of Franklin elicited hearty applause. He spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We tarry but a moment at this ancient and\r\n  interesting city, whose story goes back, I think, to the establishment\r\n  of the State of Franklin, of which perhaps not all of you, certainly\r\n  not these little ones, ever heard, which John Sevier attempted to set\r\n  up as an independent commonwealth.\r\n\r\n  But yet it is not of antiquity that I desire to speak, for ancient\r\n  history is not of the greatest interest to you now. The Scripture\r\n  speaks, I think--my Postmaster-General is near, and if I fall into\r\n  error will correct me [laughter]--of a time when the old things shall\r\n  pass away and all things shall become new. Tennessee is realizing that\r\n  beatitude; the old things, the old way of doing things, the stiff clay\r\n  and steep mountain roads have passed away and the steam-car has come.\r\n\r\n  The old times of isolation in these valleys, when these pioneers,\r\n  some of whom I see, made their frontier homes, have passed away, and\r\n  influences from the outside have come; life has been made easier to\r\n  men and easier to the toiling women who used to carry the water from\r\n  the spring at the bottom of the hill in a piggin, but who now by\r\n  modern appliances have it brought into the kitchen.\r\n\r\n  You have come to know now that not only the surface of the soil\r\n  has wealth in it, but that under the surface there are vast sources\r\n  of wealth to gladden the homes of your people and to bring with new\r\n  industries a thrifty population. But of all these old things that\r\n  have passed away and the new ones that have come, I am sure you are\r\n  exultantly glad in this region, where there was so much martyrdom for\r\n  the flag, so much exile, so much suffering, that the one Union, the\r\n  one Constitution, and the one flag might be preserved, to know that\r\n  those old strifes have passed away, and that a period of fraternity\r\n  has come when all men are for the flag and all for the Constitution,\r\n  when it has been forever put out of the minds of all people that\r\n  this Union can be dissolved or this Constitution overthrown. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n  On all these new things I congratulate the citizens of Tennessee.\r\n  Turn your faces to the morning, for the sun is lightening the\r\n  hill-tops; there is coming to our country a great growth, an\r\n  extraordinary development, and you are to be full participants in it\r\n  all. While other nations of the world have reached a climax in their\r\n  home development, and are struggling to parcel out remote regions of\r\n  the earth that their commerce may be extended, we have here prodigious\r\n  resources that are yet to be touched by the finger of development, and\r\n  we have the power, if we will, to put our flag again on the sea and to\r\n  share in the world's commerce. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENVILLE, TENNESSEE, APRIL 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home of President Andrew Johnson--Greenville, Tenn.--gave the\r\nPresident a cordial greeting through its welcoming committee, consisting\r\nof Mayor John M. Brabson, Aldermen A. N. Shown, J. D. Britton, E. C.\r\nMiller, and W. H. Williams; also Burnside Post, G. A. R., W. T. Mitchell\r\nCommander; A. J. Frazier, and the children of the public schools, in\r\ncharge of Principal L. McWhisler.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--The arrangements for our journey will not\r\n  permit me to tarry with you long. I thank you most sincerely for this\r\n  cordial demonstration. I rejoice to see in the hands of the children\r\n  here that banner of glory which is the symbol of our greatness and the\r\n  promise of our security.\r\n\r\n  I am glad that by the common consent of all our people, without any\r\n  regard to past differences, we have once and forever struck hands\r\n  upon the proposition that from the lakes to the gulf, from the St.\r\n  Lawrence to the Bay of California, there shall be one flag and one\r\n  Constitution. [Great cheering.] The story that it brings to us from\r\n  the time of its adoption as our national emblem is one in which we may\r\n  all find instruction and inspiration. It is the flag of the free.\r\n\r\n  It symbolizes a government most aptly expressed by the greatest\r\n  statesman of the people, Abraham Lincoln, to be \"a government of the\r\n  people, by the people, and for the people\"--a government that spreads\r\n  a sky of hope above the head of every child, that has abolished\r\n  all class distinctions, and has opened all places of eminence and\r\n  usefulness in the state and in commerce to the ambitious and energetic\r\n  young man.\r\n\r\n  This city has given to the country a conspicuous illustration in\r\n  your distinguished former fellow-citizen, Andrew Johnson, of what free\r\n  institutions may do, and what an aspiring young man may do against all\r\n  adverse conditions in life. To every one perfect freedom is guaranteed\r\n  within the limits of due respect to the rights of others. Thanking you\r\n  again for this presence and friendly greeting, I bid you good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRISTOWN, TENNESSEE, APRIL 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Morristown several thousand citizens and residents of Hamblen, Cocke,\r\nGrainger, and Jefferson counties assembled to greet the President. The\r\nReception Committee was Mayor W. S. Dickson, R. L. Gaut, H. Williams, W.\r\nH. Maze, A. S. Jenkins, and James A. Goddard. At the conclusion of the\r\nPresident's speech an old grizzled veteran stepped upon the platform,\r\nand reaching out his hand said: \"Mr. President, I was in that Atlanta\r\ncampaign, on the other side, and helped to keep you back, but now the\r\nwar is over I'm proud to take your hand.\" The President showed great\r\npleasure at this greeting, and held the old soldier's hand several\r\nminutes, the spectators meanwhile cheering lustily. A large number of\r\nex-Confederates witnessed this incident.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison's speech on the occasion was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow citizens_--It will not be possible for me to speak to you\r\n  for more than a moment, and yet I cannot refuse, in justice to my own\r\n  feelings, to express my deep appreciation of your cordial reception.\r\n  I visit to-day for the first time East Tennessee, but it is a region\r\n  in which I have always felt a profound interest and for whose people I\r\n  have always entertained a most sincere respect.\r\n\r\n  It seems to be true in the history of man that those who are called\r\n  to dwell among mountain peaks, in regions where the convulsions\r\n  of nature have lifted the rocks toward the sky, have always been\r\n  characterized by a personal independence of character, by a devotion\r\n  to liberty, and by courage in defence of their rights and their homes.\r\n  The legends that cluster about the mountain peaks of Scotland and the\r\n  patriotic devotion that makes memorable the passes of Switzerland have\r\n  been repeated in the mountains of East Tennessee.\r\n\r\n  In those periods of great struggles, when communications were\r\n  difficult and often interrupted, the hearts of the people of Indiana\r\n  went out to the beleaguered friends of the Union beyond the Cumberland\r\n  Gap. I am glad to know that it is no longer difficult to reach you\r\n  for succor or for friendly social intercourse, for travel has been\r\n  quickened and made easy. Some one mentioned just now that it was only\r\n  four hours and a half from Chattanooga to Atlanta. That is not my\r\n  recollection [laughter]; I think we spent as many months making that\r\n  trip. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that now, by the consent of all your people,\r\n  without regard to the differences that separated you then, your\r\n  highways are open to all of us, without prejudice; that your hearts\r\n  are true to the Union and the Constitution, and that the high sense\r\n  of public duty which then characterized you still abides among your\r\n  people. May your valleys be always full of prosperity, your homes the\r\n  abode of affection and love, and of all that makes the American home\r\n  the best of all homes and the sure nursery of good citizens. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE, APRIL 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the first day of the journey Knoxville was reached.\r\nThe distinguished travellers were welcomed by a citizens' committee,\r\ncomposed of William Rule, Chairman; Col. E. J. Sanford, Hon. J. C.\r\nJ. Williams, Hon. L. C. Houk, Col. J. Vandeventer, M. L. Ross, John\r\nT. Hearn, Alex. Summers, Wm. M. Baxter, F. A. Moses, John W. Conner,\r\nB. R. Strong, Hon. Peter Kern, Capt. W. P. Chamberlain, Col. J. B.\r\nMinnis, W. H. Simmonds, John L. Hudiburg, Capt. A. J. Albers, Hon. J. W.\r\nCaldwell, and W. P. Smith. After visiting Fort Sanders and viewing the\r\nbattle-field by twilight the party returned to the city, where a vast\r\naudience was assembled.\r\n\r\nCol. William A. Henderson introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It gives me pleasure to visit this historical\r\n  city--a city that has given to the country many men who have been\r\n  eminent in its councils and brought to the Nation they served and to\r\n  the people who called them into the public service great honor. I am\r\n  glad to visit East Tennessee, the scene of that early immigration and\r\n  of those early struggles of men who, for vigor of intellect, strength\r\n  of heart, and devotion to republican principles, were among the most\r\n  conspicuous of the early pioneers of the West and Southwest.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that that deep devotion to the cause of the\r\n  Union which manifested itself in the early contributions of\r\n  Tennessee to the armies that went to the defence of the homes of the\r\n  Northwest abides still in these valleys and crowns with its glory\r\n  and lustre every hill-top of the Alleghanies. You are feeling now a\r\n  material development that is interesting and pleasing to all your\r\n  fellow-citizens of the States.\r\n\r\n  I beg to say to you that whoever supposes that there is anywhere\r\n  in the Northern States any jealousy of this great material progress\r\n  which the South is making wholly misconceives the friendly heart of\r\n  the people of the North. It is my wish, as I am sure it is the wish\r\n  of all with whom I associate in political life, that the streams of\r\n  prosperity in the South may run bank-full; that in everything that\r\n  promotes the prosperity of the State, the security and comfort of the\r\n  community, and the happiness of the individual home, your blessings\r\n  may be full and unstinted.\r\n\r\n  We live in a Government of law. The compact of our organization\r\n  is that a majority of our people, taking those methods which are\r\n  prescribed by the Constitution and law, shall determine our public\r\n  policies and choose our rulers. It is our solemn compact; it cannot\r\n  safely be broken. We may safely differ about policies; we may safely\r\n  divide upon the question as to what shall be the law; but when the\r\n  law is once enacted no community can safely divide on the question of\r\n  implicit obedience to the law.\r\n\r\n  It is the one rule of conduct for us all. I may not choose as\r\n  President what laws I will enforce, and the citizen may not choose\r\n  what laws he will obey. Upon this broad principle our institutions\r\n  rest. If we save it, all the agitations and tumults of our campaigns,\r\n  exciting though they may be, will be harmless to move our Government\r\n  from its safe and abiding foundation.\r\n\r\n  If we abandon it, all is gone. Therefore, my appeal everywhere is\r\n  to hold the law in veneration and reverence. We have no other king;\r\n  public officers are your servants; but in the august and majestic\r\n  presence of the law we all uncover and bow the knee.\r\n\r\n  May every prosperity attend you. May this ground, made memorable by\r\n  one of the most gallant assaults and by one of the most successful\r\n  defences in the story of the war, never again be stained by\r\n  blood; but may our people, in one common love of one flag and one\r\n  Constitution, in a common and pervading fealty to the great principles\r\n  of our Government, go on to achieve material wealth, and in social\r\n  development, in intelligence, in piety, in everything that makes\r\n  a nation great and a people happy, secure all the Lord has in His\r\n  mind for a Nation that He has so conspicuously blessed. [Great and\r\n  prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE, APRIL 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nChattanooga was reached Wednesday morning at 8:30 o'clock. The President\r\nwas received with marked cordiality and enthusiasm by the several\r\nthousand citizens assembled at the station. At this point the party\r\nwas joined by the President's younger brother, Mr. Carter B. Harrison,\r\nand his wife, of Murfreesboro, Tenn. The following prominent citizens\r\ncomprised the committee that received the President: Hon. J. B. Merriam,\r\nMayor of Chattanooga; Hon. H. Clay Evans, Judge David M. Key, H. S.\r\nChamberlain, D. J. O'Connell, Henophen Wheeler, John Crimmins, Maj. J.\r\nF. Shipp, Col. Tomlinson Fort, John T. Wilder, Adolph S. Ochs, John B.\r\nNicklin, L. G. Walker, A. J. Gahagan, C. E. James, F. G. Montague, H. M.\r\nWiltse, John W. Stone, J. B. Pound, E. W. Mattson, and Judge Whiteside.\r\n\r\nThe committee escorted the distinguished guests to the summit of\r\nLookout Mountain. At the Lookout Inn President Harrison pointed out\r\nto his immediate companions the spot where he was encamped for a time\r\nduring the war. From the mountain the party was driven about the city,\r\nwhich was profusely decorated. All the school children in the city stood\r\nin front of their respective schools and waved flags and shouted as the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Harrison drove by. Assembled around the platform\r\nwhere the general reception was held were many thousand people.\r\n\r\nEx-Congressman Evans, amid deafening cheers, introduced the President,\r\nwho said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have greatly enjoyed the opportunity of\r\n  seeing Chattanooga again. I saw it last as the camp of a great army.\r\n  Its only industries were military, its stores were munitions of war,\r\n  its pleasant hill-tops were torn with rifle-pits, its civic population\r\n  the attendants of an army campaign. I see it to-day a great city, a\r\n  prosperous commercial centre. I see these hill-tops, then bristling\r\n  with guns, crowned with happy homes; I see these streets, through\r\n  which the worn veterans of many campaigns then marched, made glad with\r\n  the presence of happy children. Everything is changed.\r\n\r\n  The wand of an enchanter has touched these hills, and old Lookout,\r\n  that frowned over the valleys from which the plough had been\r\n  withdrawn, now looks upon the peaceful industries of country life.\r\n  All things are changed, except that the flag that then floated over\r\n  Chattanooga floats here still. [Cheers.] It has passed from the hand\r\n  of the veterans, who bore it to victory in battle, into the hands\r\n  of the children, who lift it as an emblem of peace. [Cheers.] Then\r\n  Chattanooga was war's gateway to the South; now it is the gateway of\r\n  peace, commerce, and prosperity. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  There have been two conquests--one with arms, the other with the\r\n  gentle influences of peace--and the last is greater than the first.\r\n  [Cheers.] The first is only great as it made way for that which\r\n  followed; and now, one again in our devotion to the Constitution and\r\n  the laws, one again in the determination that the question of the\r\n  severance of the federal relations of these States shall never again\r\n  be raised, we have started together upon a career of prosperity and\r\n  development that has as yet given only the signs of what is to come.\r\n\r\n  I congratulate Tennessee, I congratulate this prosperous city, I\r\n  congratulate all those who through this gateway give and receive\r\n  the interchanges of friendly commerce, that there is being wrought\r\n  throughout our country a unification by commerce, a unification by\r\n  similarity of institutions and habits, that shall in time erase every\r\n  vestige of difference, and shall make us, not only in contemplation of\r\n  the law, but in heart and sympathy, one people. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you for your cordial greeting to-day, and hope for the\r\n  development of the industries of our country and for the settling of\r\n  our institutions upon the firm base of a respect for the law. In this\r\n  glad springtime, while the gardens are full of blossoms and the fields\r\n  give promise of another harvest, and your homes are full of happy\r\n  children, let us thank God for what He has wrought for us as a people,\r\n  and, each in our place, resolutely maintain the great idea upon which\r\n  everything is builded--the rule of the majority, constitutionally\r\n  expressed, and the absolute equality of all men before the law.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTERSVILLE, GEORGIA, APRIL 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop after crossing the Georgia State line was Cartersville,\r\nwhere a citizens' committee, headed by M. G. Dobbins, W. H. Howard, and\r\nWalter Akerman, received the President, who in response to repeated\r\ncalls said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very much obliged to you for coming here in this\r\n  shower to show your good-will. I can only assure you that I entirely\r\n  reciprocate your good feelings. I have had great pleasure to-day in\r\n  passing over some parts of the old route that I took once before under\r\n  very different and distressing circumstances, to find how easy it is,\r\n  when we are all agreed, to travel between Chattanooga and Atlanta.\r\n  I am glad to see the evidences of prosperity that abound through\r\n  your country, and I wish you in all your relations every human good.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTA, GEORGIA, APRIL 15.\r\n\r\n          \"What War has ravaged Commerce can bestow,\r\n          And he returns a Friend who came a Foe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party travelled over the Western and Atlantic route\r\nfrom Chattanooga to Atlanta, passing through historic battle-grounds\r\nwith which the President and other members of his party were once\r\nfamiliar. General Harrison actively participated in the Atlanta campaign\r\nand held the chief command at the battle of Resaca. It was with keen\r\ninterest, therefore, that he viewed this memorable field in company\r\nwith Marshal Ransdell, who lost an arm there. Short stops were made\r\nat the battle-fields of Chickamauga, Tunnel Hill, Resaca, Dug Gap,\r\nand Kennesaw. At Marietta the President was met by a committee from\r\nthe city government of Atlanta, consisting of Mayor W. A. Hemphill,\r\nAldermen Hutchison, Woodward, Rice, Shropshire, and Middlebrooks;\r\nCouncilmen Murphy, Hendrix, Lambert, Holbrook, Sawtell, King, Turner,\r\nMcBride, and City Clerk Woodward. These officials were accompanied by a\r\nspecial committee of citizens representing the Chamber of Commerce and\r\nthe veteran associations, comprising ex-Gov. R. B. Bullock, Gen. J. R.\r\nLewis, Capt. John Milledge, Julius L. Brown, S. M. Inman, Hon. J. T.\r\nGlenn, and Hon. W. L. Calhoun.\r\n\r\nA vast throng greeted the President's arrival. Gov. William J. Northen\r\nand the other members of the Reception Committee received the party.\r\nGovernor Northen said: \"I am glad to welcome your excellency to the\r\nState of Georgia. You will find among us a loyal and hospitable people,\r\nand in their name I welcome you to the State.\"\r\n\r\nReplying, the President said it gave him great pleasure to visit the\r\nEmpire State of the South, the wonderful evidences of the prosperity of\r\nwhich were manifest in the stirring city of Atlanta.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the President and his party were tendered a reception\r\nat the Capitol by Governor Northen and Mayor Hemphill, assisted by\r\nChief-Justice Bleckley, Judge Simmons, Judge Lumpkin, Gen.

M. Scott, A. B.\r\nCarrier, W. B. Miles, T. C. Watson, and L. B. Nelson.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the reception the President, accompanied by Mayor\r\nHemphill, Hon. A. L. Kontz, and Superintendent Slaton, visited the night\r\nschool, where the boys gave him an enthusiastic welcome and called for a\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe President said:\r\n\r\n  I am glad to be with you to-night. Having but a few minutes to spare\r\n  I would offer a few words of encouragement to you. Most, if not all,\r\n  of you are here at night because your circumstances are such that the\r\n  day must be given to toil. The day is your earning period. The night\r\n  must, therefore, be set apart for study. I am glad to see that so many\r\n  find it in your hearts to be here in this school; it is a very hopeful\r\n  sign. I think it has in it the promise that you will each become a\r\n  useful citizen in this country. Pluck and energy are two essential\r\n  elements. A boy wants to be something. With pluck and energy success\r\n  is assured. There is a day of hope above every one of you.\r\n\r\n  I bid you good cheer and would offer encouragement to every one of\r\n  you, and I know every one of you may be useful and honorable citizens\r\n  in this community, whose officers have taken the interest to organize\r\n  this school for your benefit. I very sincerely and earnestly wish\r\n  you God-speed. Stick to your studies and don't neglect to acquire a\r\n  needful education, and you may one day occupy the positions of honor\r\n  which are held by those to-day in charge of the affairs of your city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATLANTA, APRIL 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th the President's party bade adieu to Atlanta.\r\nMore than 10,000 people were present. Mayor Hemphill invited the\r\nPresident to the rear platform of the train and presented him to the\r\nassemblage. In response to their cheers he said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I desire, in parting from you, to give\r\n  public expression of my satisfaction and enjoyment in my brief visit\r\n  to Atlanta. I saw this city once under circumstances of a very\r\n  unfavorable character. I did not think I would like it, although we\r\n  were making great efforts to get it. [Laughter.] I am glad after all\r\n  these years to see the great prosperity and development that has come\r\n  to you. I think I am able to understand some of the influences that\r\n  are at the bottom of it, and I am sure that I look into the faces of\r\n  a community that, whatever their differences may have been, however\r\n  they viewed the question of the war when it was upon us, can have but\r\n  one thought as to what was best. We can all say with the Confederate\r\n  soldier who carried a gun for what seemed to him to be right, that God\r\n  knew better than any of us what was best for the country and for the\r\n  world.\r\n\r\n  You are thankful for what He has wrought and chiefly for\r\n  emancipation. It has opened up to diversified industries these States\r\n  that were otherwise exclusively agricultural, and made it possible\r\n  for you not only to raise cotton, but to spin and weave it, and has\r\n  made Georgia such a State as it could not have been under the old\r\n  conditions. I am sure we have many common purposes, and as God shall\r\n  give us power to see truth and right, let us do our duty, and, while\r\n  exacting all our own rights, let us bravely and generously give every\r\n  other man his equal rights before the law. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Thanking you for your reception, which has been warm and\r\n  hospitable, I go from you very grateful for your kindness and very\r\n  full of hope for your future.\r\n\r\n  I cannot wish more than that those enterprising land-owners whose\r\n  work in grading and laying new additions I saw yesterday will realize\r\n  all their hopes. I am very sure if that is done Atlanta will not long\r\n  be rated the second city of the South. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the President's address there were many calls for\r\nMr. Wanamaker. These finally brought the Postmaster-General to the\r\nplatform, who said:\r\n\r\n  That man is unfortunate who is called on to speak after a President.\r\n  But at such a moment as this, parting from people who in a single\r\n  night have shown so much kindness and good-fellowship, it is not\r\n  difficult to return at least our grateful thanks for your most\r\n  generous welcome. Of all objects in your city I have looked with most\r\n  interest upon the house where a great light had gone out, and felt\r\n  again the common sorrow in the absence of Henry Grady, a man whose\r\n  life and influences were larger than Atlanta. The words he spoke and\r\n  the principles he stood for cannot be forgotten. If we can but learn\r\n  to know each other and understand each other there will be fewer\r\n  differences than might be supposed. By more frequent intercourse and a\r\n  fairer consideration of each other we should rise to a higher level of\r\n  happiness. I wish we had come sooner and could stay longer. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALLAPOOSA, GEORGIA, APRIL 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Tallapoosa was bedecked with flags and bunting in honor of\r\nthe distinguished visitors, and gave the President a cordial reception.\r\nMayor A. J. Head and the following representative citizens were among\r\nthose who greeted the Chief Executive: James H. Rineard, Walker Brock,\r\nU. G. Brock, J. A. Head, R. M. Strickland, J. C. Parker, W. T. King, R.\r\nG. Bently, T. J. Barrett, J. T. Tuggle, R. J. McBride, G. W. Bullard, C.\r\nTallafario, J. A. Burns, J. R. Knapp, C. W. Fox, M. C. Reeve, M. Munson,\r\nW. W. Summerlin, S. J. Cason, J. H. Davis, S. White, A. Hass, T. L.\r\nDougherty, G. A. Stickney, N. L. Hutchens, O. F. Sampson, H. Martin, M.\r\nC. Haiston, G. W. Tumlin, and J. C. Murrey.\r\n\r\nResponding to the welcoming cheers the President addressed the assembly\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--This large assemblage of people from this new\r\n  and energetic city is very pleasant, and I thank you for the welcome\r\n  that it implies. All of these evidences of extending industry are\r\n  extremely pleasing to me as I observe them. They furnish employment to\r\n  men; they imply comfortable homes, contented families, a safe social\r\n  organization, and are the strength of the Nation.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to see that these enterprises that are taking the ores\r\n  from the earth and adapting them to the uses of civilization have\r\n  not been started here unaccompanied by that more important work--the\r\n  work of gathering the children into the schools and instructing them,\r\n  that they in their turn may be useful men and women. [Applause.] I am\r\n  glad to greet these little ones this morning; it is a cheerful sight.\r\n  We are soon to lay down the work of life and the responsibilities of\r\n  citizenship, these mothers are soon to quit the ever-recurring and\r\n  never-ending work of the home and give it into new hands.\r\n\r\n  It is of the utmost consequence that these little ones be trained\r\n  in mind and taught the fear of God and a benevolent regard for their\r\n  fellow-men, in order that their lives and social relations may be\r\n  peaceful and happy. We are citizens of one country, having one flag\r\n  and one destiny. We are starting upon a new era of development, and I\r\n  hope this development is to keep pace and to be the promoting cause of\r\n  a very perfect unification of our people. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We have a Government whose principles are very simple and very\r\n  popular. The whole theory of our institutions is that, pursuing those\r\n  election methods which we have prescribed under the Constitution,\r\n  every man shall exercise freely the right that the suffrage law\r\n  confides to him, and that the majority, if it has expressed its will,\r\n  shall conclude the issue for us all. There is no other foundation.\r\n  This was the enduring base upon which the fathers of our country\r\n  placed our institutions. Let us always keep them there. Let us press\r\n  the debate in our campaigns as to what the law should be; but let us\r\n  keep faith and submit with the reverence and respect which are due to\r\n  the law when once lawfully enacted. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  The development which is coming to you in these regions of the\r\n  South is marvellous. In ten years you increased your production of\r\n  iron about 300 per cent.--nearly a million and a quarter of tons--and\r\n  you have only begun to open these mines and to put these ores to the\r\n  process of reduction. Now, I want to leave this thought with you: In\r\n  the old plantations of the South you got everything from somewhere\r\n  else; why not make it all yourselves? [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNISTON, ALABAMA, APRIL 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thousands greeted the President on his arrival at Anniston. The\r\nReception Committee consisted of Mayor James Noble, J. W. Lapsley, H. W.\r\nBailey, T. G. Garrett, B. F. Cassady, John J. Mickle, C. H. Camfield, J.\r\nJ. Willett, J. C. Sproull, R. H. Cobb, I. Finch, and Alex. S. Thweatt.\r\nThe committee appointed by the Alabama State Sunday-School Association,\r\nthen in session, was: Joseph Hardie, Geo. B. Eager, P. P. Winn, M.\r\nJ. Greene, and C. W. O'Hare. On the part of the colored citizens the\r\nCommittee of Reception was: Rev. W. H. McAlpine, Wm. J. Stevens, S. E.\r\nMoses, Rev. J. F. Fitspatrick, and Rev. Jas. W. Brown. Daniel Tyler\r\nPost, G. A. R., H. Rosenbaum, Commander, G. B. Randolph acting Adjutant,\r\nalso participated. The Hon. John M. McKleroy delivered the address of\r\nwelcome, followed by Wm. J. Stevens in behalf of the colored people.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-citizens_--I very much regret that I am able to make so\r\n  little return to you for this cordial manifestation of your respect\r\n  and friendship; and yet, even in these few moments which I am able to\r\n  spend with you, I hope I shall gather and possibly be able to impart\r\n  some impulse that may be mutually beneficial. I am glad to see with\r\n  the eye that of which I have kept informed--the great development\r\n  which is taking place in the mineral regions of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n  I remember, as a boy, resident upon one of the great tributaries\r\n  of the Mississippi, how the agricultural products of those States,\r\n  the corn and provisions raised upon the fertile acres of the Ohio and\r\n  Mississippi valleys, were marketed in the South. The old broad-horn\r\n  took its way down the Mississippi, stopping at the plantations to\r\n  sell the provisions upon which the people of the South were largely\r\n  sustained. The South was then essentially a plantation region,\r\n  producing one or two great staples that found a ready market in the\r\n  world, but dependent for its implements of industry and domestic\r\n  utensils upon the States of the North Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n  I am glad all this is changed, that you are realizing the benefits\r\n  of diversified agriculture, and that the production upon your farms of\r\n  the staples which you once bought elsewhere is largely increasing; and\r\n  I am glad that to diversified agriculture you have also added these\r\n  great mechanical pursuits which have brought into your communities\r\n  artisans and laborers who take from the adjacent farms the surplus of\r\n  your fertile lands. [Cheers.] There has been received in the South\r\n  since the war not less than $8,000,000,000 for cotton, and while I\r\n  rejoice in that, I am glad to know that in this generous region there\r\n  are near 100,000 acres devoted to raising watermelons. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  No farmer, certainly no planter in the old time, would have\r\n  consented to sell watermelons. You are learning that things which were\r\n  small and despised have come to be great elements in your commerce.\r\n  Now your railroads make special provision for the transportation of a\r\n  crop which brings large wealth to your people.\r\n\r\n  I mention this as a good illustration of the changing conditions\r\n  into which you are entering. You are realizing the benefits of home\r\n  markets for what you produce, and I am sure you will unite with me\r\n  in those efforts which we ought to make, not only to fill our own\r\n  markets with all that this great Nation of 65,000,000 needs, but to\r\n  reach out to other markets and enter into competition with the world\r\n  for them. [Cheers.] This we shall do, and with all this mechanical\r\n  and commercial development we shall realize largely that condition of\r\n  unification of heart and interest to which those who have spoken for\r\n  you have so eloquently alluded. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now, wishing that the expectations of all who are interested in\r\n  this stirring young city may be realized, that all your industries\r\n  may be active and profitable, I add the wish that those gentler and\r\n  kindlier agencies of the school and church, of a friendly social life,\r\n  may always pervade and abide with you as a community. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, APRIL 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge delegations came from Mobile, Selma, Montgomery, Sheffield, and\r\nother points in Alabama, to participate in the grand ovation tendered\r\nPresident Harrison and his party at Birmingham on April 16. Gov.\r\nThomas G. Jones and the following members of his staff welcomed the\r\npresidential party at Henryellen: Adjt.-Gen. Charles B. Jones, Col. F.\r\nL. Pettus, Col. Eugene Stollenwerck, Col. M. P. Le Grand, Col. W. W.\r\nQuarles, Col. B. L. Holt, Lieut. James B. Erwin, and J. K. Jackson,\r\nSecretary to the Governor. The Governor's party was accompanied by five\r\nmembers from the Citizens' Committee: Col. E. T. Taliaferro, Rufus N.\r\nRhodes, J. W. Hughes, R. L. Houston, and C. A. Johnston.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Birmingham, in the afternoon, the President was greeted by\r\nan enormous gathering and formally welcomed by Mayor A. O. Lane at the\r\nhead of the following distinguished committee: H. M. Caldwell, Joseph\r\nF. Johnston, B. L. Hibbard, William Youngblood, W. J. Cameron, J. A.\r\nVan Hoose, R. H. Pearson, E. H. Barron, M. M. Williams, J. O. Wright,\r\nJames Weatherly, Chappell Cory, Louis Saks, D. D. Smith, J. P. Mudd,\r\nCharles M. Shelley, Paul Giacopazzi, James A. Going, Joe Frank, T. H.\r\nSpencer, P. G. Bowman, J. M. Martin, G. W. Hewitt, T. T. Hillman, E.\r\nSoloman, F. P. O'Brien, Lewis M. Parsons, Robert Jemison, John McQueen,\r\nGeo. L. Morris, B. Steiner, Mack Sloss, J. A. Yeates, J. M. Handley,\r\nFergus W. McCarthy, E. V. Gregory, F. H. Armstrong, Geo. M. Morrow,\r\nThomas Seddon, E. W. Rucker, W. H. Graves, Gus Shillinger, M. T. Porter,\r\nEdwin C. Campbell, Eugene F. Enslen, R. L. Thornton, Charles Whelan,\r\nW. S. Brown, John M. Cartin, Wm. M. Bethea, I. R. Hochstadter, John W.\r\nJohnston, Wm. Vaughn, Jas. E. Webb, and Robert Warnock. George A. Custer\r\nPost, G. A. R., commanded by Ass't Adjt.-Gen. W. J. Pender, escorted\r\nthe President on the march through the city. The following officers\r\nparticipated: W. H. Hunter, Department Commander; F. G. Sheppard, Past\r\nDepartment Commander; William Snyder, Commander; A. A. Tyler, Senior\r\nVice-Commander; Henry Asa N. Ballard, Surgeon; Edward Birchenough,\r\nAssistant Quartermaster-General; A. W. Fulghum, Past Commander; and John\r\nMackenzie, Officer of the Day.\r\n\r\nBoth the Governor and the Mayor delivered eloquent addresses of welcome,\r\nto which President Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Jones, Mr. Mayor, and Fellow-citizens_--The noise of\r\n  your industries will not stay itself, I fear, sufficiently to enable\r\n  me to make myself heard by many in this immense throng that has\r\n  gathered to welcome us. I judge from what we have seen as we neared\r\n  your station that we have here at Birmingham the largest and most\r\n  enthusiastic concourse of people that has met us since we left the\r\n  national capital. [Great and prolonged cheering.] For all this I am\r\n  deeply grateful. The rapidity with which we must pursue this journey\r\n  will not allow us to look with any detail into the great enterprises\r\n  which cluster about your city; but if we shall only have opportunity\r\n  to see for a moment these friendly faces and listen to these friendly\r\n  words, we shall carry away that which will be invaluable, and, I\r\n  trust, by the friendly exchange of greetings, may leave something\r\n  to you that is worth cherishing. [Great cheering.] I have read of\r\n  the marvellous development which, in the last few years, has been\r\n  stirring the solitude of these southern mountains, and I remember that\r\n  not many years after the war, when I had resumed my law practice at\r\n  Indianapolis, I was visited by a gentleman, known, I expect, to all of\r\n  you, upon some professional business. He came to pursue a collection\r\n  claim against a citizen of Indiana; but he seemed to be more\r\n  interested in talking about Birmingham than anything else. [Laughter\r\n  and cheers.] That man was Colonel Powell, one of the early promoters\r\n  of your city. [Cheers.] I listened to his story of the marvellous\r\n  wealth of iron and coal that was stored in this region; of their\r\n  nearness to each other, and to the limestone necessary for smelting;\r\n  to his calculations as to the cheapness with which iron could be\r\n  produced here, and his glowing story of the great city that was to be\r\n  reared, with a good deal of incredulity. I thought he was a visionary;\r\n  but I have regretted ever since that I did not ask him to pay me my\r\n  fee in town lots in Birmingham. [Laughter and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  My countrymen, we thought the war a great calamity, and so it was.\r\n  The destruction of life and of property was sad beyond expression;\r\n  and yet we can see now that God led us through that Red Sea to a\r\n  development in material prosperity and to a fraternity that was\r\n  not otherwise possible. [Cheers.] The industries that have called\r\n  to your midst so many toiling men are always and everywhere the\r\n  concomitants of freedom. Out of all this freedom from the incubus\r\n  of slavery the South has found a new industrial birth. Once almost\r\n  wholly agricultural, you are now not the less fruitful in crops, but\r\n  you have added all this. [Cheers.] You have increased your production\r\n  of cotton, and have added an increase in ten years of nearly 300 per\r\n  cent. in the production of iron. You have produced three-fourths\r\n  of the cotton crop of the world, and it has brought you since the\r\n  war about $8,000,000,000 of money to enrich your people. But as\r\n  yet you are spinning in the South only 8 per cent, of it. Why not,\r\n  with the help we will give you in New England and the North, spin\r\n  it all? [Cheers.] Why not establish here cotton mills that shall\r\n  send, not the crude agricultural product to other markets, but the\r\n  manufactured product? [Cheers.] Why not, while supplying 65,000,000\r\n  of people, reach out and take a part we have not had in the commerce\r\n  of the world? [Cheers.] I believe we are to see now a renaissance\r\n  in American prosperity and in the up-building again of our American\r\n  merchant marine. [Cheers.] I believe that these Southern ports that so\r\n  favorably look out with invitations to the States of Central and South\r\n  America shall yet see our fleets carrying the American flag and the\r\n  products of Alabama to the markets of South America. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  In all this we are united; we may differ as to method, but if\r\n  you will permit me I will give an illustration to show how we have\r\n  been dealing with this shipping question. I can remember when no\r\n  wholesale merchant ever sent a drummer into the field. He said to his\r\n  customers, \"Come to my store and buy;\" but competition increased and\r\n  the enterprising merchant started out men to seek customers; and so\r\n  his fellow-merchant was put to the choice to put travelling men into\r\n  the field or to go out of business. It seems to me, whatever we may\r\n  think of the policy of aiding our steamship lines, that since every\r\n  other great nation does it, we must do it or stay out of business,\r\n  for we have pretty much gone out. [Cheers.] I am glad to reciprocate\r\n  with the very fulness of my heart every fraternal expression that has\r\n  fallen from the lips of these gentlemen who have addressed me in your\r\n  behalf. [Cheers.] I have not been saved from mistakes; probably I\r\n  shall not be. I am sure of but one thing--I can declare that I have\r\n  simply at heart the glory of the American Nation and the good of all\r\n  its people. [Great and prolonged cheering.] I thank these companies\r\n  of the State militia, one of whom I recognize as having done me the\r\n  honor to attend the inaugural ceremony, for their presence. They are\r\n  deserving, sir [to the Governor], of your encouragement and that of\r\n  the State of Alabama. They are the reserve army of the United States.\r\n  It is our policy not to have a large regular army, but to have a\r\n  trained militia that, in any exigency, will step to the defence of the\r\n  country; and if that exigency shall ever arise--which God forbid--I\r\n  know that you would respond as quickly and readily as any other State.\r\n  [Cheers.] [The Governor: \"You will find all Alabama at your back,\r\n  sir!\"] [Continued cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that in addition to all this business you are\r\n  doing you are also attending to education and to those things that\r\n  conduce to social order. The American home is the one thing we cannot\r\n  afford to lose out of the American life. [Cheers.] As long as we have\r\n  pure homes and God-fearing, order-loving fathers and mothers to rear\r\n  the children that are given to them, and to make these homes the\r\n  abodes of order, cleanliness, piety, and intelligence, the American\r\n  society and the American Union are safe [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nAfter the parade the President's party, the Governor and staff, and the\r\ncitizens' Reception Committee sat down to luncheon. On the right of\r\nthe President was Mrs. Jones, wife of the Governor; on his left, Mrs.\r\nLane, wife of the Mayor. Mr. Rufus N. Rhodes proposed the health of the\r\nPresident of the United States, to which General Harrison responded\r\nbriefly, saying:\r\n\r\n  We have seen something of the marvellous material growth of\r\n  Birmingham, and seen evidence of the great richness of your \"black\r\n  diamonds\" and your iron, and now we see something of your home life.\r\n  The many beautiful women whom we have had the happiness to meet, and\r\n  some of whom are now with us, are the angels of your homes, and right\r\n  glad we are to be favored by their presence. After all, it is their\r\n  homes which make a people great. We are glad to be here; for, really,\r\n  you overwhelm us with kindness. [Long-continued applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, APRIL 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party arrived at Memphis early on the morning of the\r\n17th and were greeted by 10,000 people.

A. J. Vaughn, Gen. G. W.\r\nGordon, and Gen. R. F. Patterson.\r\n\r\nChairman Clapp made the address of welcome. President Harrison responded\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--The name of the city of Memphis was familiar\r\n  to me in my early boyhood. Born and reared upon one of the tributaries\r\n  of the great river upon which your city is located, these river marts\r\n  of commerce were the familiar trading-posts of the farmers of the Ohio\r\n  Valley. I well remember when, on the shores of father's farm, the old\r\n  \"broad-horn\" was loaded from the hay-press and the corn-crib to market\r\n  with the plantations along the Lower Mississippi. I remember to have\r\n  heard from him and the neighbors who constituted the crew of those\r\n  pioneer craft of river navigation of the perils of these great waters;\r\n  of the snags and caving banks of the Lower Mississippi. In those times\r\n  these States were largely supplied with grain and forage from the\r\n  Northwestern States. Here you were giving your attention to one or two\r\n  great staple products, for which you found a large foreign market. I\r\n  congratulate you that the progress of events has made you not less\r\n  agricultural, but has diversified your agriculture so that you are not\r\n  now wholly dependent upon these great staples for the income of your\r\n  farms.\r\n\r\n  The benefits of this diversification are very great and the change\r\n  symbolizes more than we at first realize. This change means that we\r\n  are now coming to understand that meanness cannot be predicated of\r\n  any honest industry. I rejoice that you are adding to diversified\r\n  agriculture diversified manufacturing pursuits; that you are turning\r\n  your thought to compressing and spinning cotton as well as raising it.\r\n  I know no reason why these cotton States, that produce 75 per cent. of\r\n  the cotton of the world, should not spin the greater portion of it. I\r\n  know no reason why they should export it as raw material, rather than\r\n  as a manufactured product, holding in their midst the profits of this\r\n  transformation of the raw material to the finished product. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I hope it may be so. I see evidence that the people are turning\r\n  their attention to new industries, and are bringing into the midst of\r\n  these farming communities a large population of artisans and laborers\r\n  to consume at your own doors the product of your farms. I am glad that\r\n  a liberal Government is making this great waterway to the sea safe and\r\n  capable of an uninterrupted use. I am glad that it is here making the\r\n  shores of your own city convenient and safe, and that it is opening,\r\n  north and south, an uninterrupted and cheap transportation for the\r\n  products of these lands that lie along this great system of rivers. I\r\n  am glad that it is bringing you in contact with ports of the Gulf that\r\n  look out with near and inviting aspect toward a great trade in South\r\n  America that we shall soon possess. I am glad to believe that these\r\n  great river towns will speedily exchange their burdens with American\r\n  ships at the mouth of the Mississippi to be transported to foreign\r\n  ports under the flag of our country. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  This Government of ours is a compact of the people to be governed by\r\n  a majority, expressing itself by lawful methods. [Cheers.] Everything\r\n  in this country is to be brought to the measure of the law. I propose\r\n  no other rule, either as an individual or as a public officer. I\r\n  cannot in any degree let down this rule [cries of \"No!\" and cheers]\r\n  without violating my official duty. There must be no other supremacy\r\n  than that of lawful majorities. We must all come at last to this\r\n  conclusion--that the supremacy of the law is the one supremacy in this\r\n  country of ours. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Now, my fellow citizens, I thank you for this warm and magnificent\r\n  demonstration of your respect, accepting cordially the expression of\r\n  the chief of your city Government that you are a sincere, earnest,\r\n  patriotic, devoted people. I beg to leave with you the suggestion that\r\n  each in his place shall do what he can to maintain social order and\r\n  public peace; that the lines here and everywhere shall be between the\r\n  well-disposed and the ill-disposed.\r\n\r\n  The effort of speech to this immense throng is too great for me.\r\n  I beg to assure you that I carry from the great war no sentiment of\r\n  ill-will to any. [Cheers.] I am glad that the Confederate soldier,\r\n  confessing that defeat which has brought him blessings that would\r\n  have been impossible otherwise, has been taken again into full\r\n  participation in the administration of the Government; that no\r\n  penalties, limitations, or other inflictions rest upon him. I have\r\n  taken and can always take the hand of a brave Confederate soldier with\r\n  confidence and respect. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I would put him under one yoke only, and that is the yoke that the\r\n  victors in that struggle bore when they went home and laid off their\r\n  uniforms--the yoke of the law and the obligation always to obey it.\r\n  [Cheers.] Upon that platform, without distinction between the victors\r\n  and the vanquished, we enter together upon possibilities as a people\r\n  that we cannot overestimate. I believe the Nation is lifting itself\r\n  to a new life; that this flag shall float on unfamiliar seas, and\r\n  that this coming prosperity will be equally shared by all our people.\r\n  [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, APRIL 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the presidential party crossed the Mississippi they were met on the\r\nArkansas shore by Gov. James P. Eagle and wife, Judge John A. Williams,\r\nMayor H. L. Fletcher, James Mitchell, Col. Logan H. Roots, Mrs. Judge\r\nCaldwell, Mrs. C. C. Waters, Mrs. Wm. G. Whipple, Mrs. W. C. Ratcliffe,\r\nMiss Jean Loughborough, and Miss Fannie Mitchell. Arriving at Little\r\nRock, late in the afternoon, the President was welcomed by Hon. Josiah\r\nH. Shinn, R. A. Edgerton, Chas. C. Waters, B. D. Caldwell, W. A. Clark,\r\nH. F. Roberts, T. H. Jones, and the other members of the Committee of\r\nReception. McPherson and Ord posts, G. A. R., in charge of Marshal\r\nO. M. Spellman, Lee Clough, and C. Altenberg, acted as escort to the\r\nPresident, accompanied by the McCarthy Light Guards. The parade was in\r\ncharge of Grand Marshal Zeb Ward, Jr., assisted by Col. W. T. Kelley,\r\nHorace G. Allis, and Oscar Davis. The Lincoln Club, commanded by P.\r\nRaleigh and P. C. Dooley, participated in the reception. At the State\r\nHouse Governor Eagle formally welcomed the distinguished travellers.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Eagle and Fellow-citizens_--No voice is large enough\r\n  to compass this immense throng. But my heart is large enough to\r\n  receive all the gladness and joy of your great welcome here to-day.\r\n  [Applause.] I thank you one and all for your presence, for the kind\r\n  words of greeting which have been spoken by your Governor, and for\r\n  these kind faces turned to me. In all this I see a great fraternity;\r\n  in all this I feel new impulses to a better discharge of every public\r\n  and every private duty. I cannot but feel that in consequence of this\r\n  brief contact with you to-day I shall carry away a better knowledge\r\n  of your State, its resources, its capabilities, and of the generous\r\n  warm-heartedness of its people. We have a country whose greatness this\r\n  meeting evidences, for there are here assembled masses of independent\r\n  men. The commonwealth rests upon the free suffrage of its citizens\r\n  and their devotion to the Constitution, and the flag is the bulwark\r\n  of its life. [Cheers.] We have agreed, I am sure, that we will do no\r\n  more fighting among ourselves. [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and cheers.]\r\n  I may say to you confidentially that Senator Jones and I agreed\r\n  several years ago, after observing together the rifle practice at Fort\r\n  Snelling, that shooting had been reduced to such accuracy that war was\r\n  too dangerous for either of us to engage in it. [Laughter and cheers.]\r\n  But, my friends, I cannot prolong this talk. Once already to-day\r\n  in the dampness of this atmosphere I have attempted to speak, and\r\n  therefore you will allow me to conclude by wishing for your State, for\r\n  its Governor and all its public officers, for all its citizens without\r\n  exception, high or humble, the blessing of social order, peace, and\r\n  prosperity--the fruits of intelligence and piety. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXARKANA, ARKANSAS, APRIL 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding it was nearly midnight when the presidential train\r\nreached Texarkana, about 2,000 citizens were present. Foremost in the\r\nmovement to give a fitting reception to the President were: George H.\r\nLangsdale, Robert Langsdale, Richard Brunazzi, and Edward Donnelly.\r\nAmong other well-known citizens present were Lyman S. Roach, Commander\r\nof Dick Yates Post, G. A. R.; Ira A. Church, J. A. Mifflin, Wm.\r\nRhinders, W. F. Loren, W. W. Shaw, Fred A. Church, J. P. Ashcraft, Wm.\r\nH. Bush, A. B. Matson, W. W. De Prato, T. P. McCalla, J. W. Hatcher,\r\nJohn McKenna, Peter Gable, John Mayher, Martin Foster, J. K. Langsdale,\r\nand F. L. Schuster.\r\n\r\nThe President spoke briefly and said:\r\n\r\n  Having had notice of your request that we stop here for a few\r\n  moments, I have remained up in order to thank you for your expressed\r\n  interest and for this very large and cordial demonstration. I have\r\n  spoken several times during the day, and am sure you will excuse\r\n  me from attempting now, at midnight, to make a speech. I hope that\r\n  prosperity is here and that it may abide with you. Thanking you again,\r\n  I bid you good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALESTINE, TEXAS, APRIL 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop in the Lone Star State was at Palestine, where the\r\nPresident received a royal welcome, the population of the city turning\r\nout to do him honor. His excellency Gov. James S. Hogg cordially\r\ngreeted the President at this point. Hon. John H. Reagan, Hon. Geo. A.\r\nWright, Mayor of Palestine, and the City Council in a body, constituted\r\nthe Committee of Reception, together with the following prominent\r\nresidents: Capt. T. T. Gammage, A. H. Bailey, Geo. E. Dilley, N. R.\r\nRoyall, W. C. Kendall, A. Teah, J. R. Hearne, J. W. Ozment, P. W. Ezell,\r\nO. B. Sawyers, G. W. Burkitt, W. M. Lacy, Henry Ash, A. C. Green,\r\nA. R. Howard, A. L. Bowers, D. W. Heath, Wm. Broyles, John J. Word,\r\nE. R. Kersh, R. J. Wallace, J. M. Fullinwider, Rev. E. F. Fales and\r\nMrs. Fales, who welcomed her distinguished brother Postmaster-General\r\nWanamaker.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hogg made the formal address of welcome, to which the President\r\nresponded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Hogg and Fellow-citizens_--It gives me pleasure to come\r\n  this fresh morning into this great State--a kingdom without a king,\r\n  an empire without an emperor, a State gigantic in proportions and\r\n  matchless in resources, with diversified industries and infinite\r\n  capacities to sustain a tremendous population and to bring to every\r\n  home where industry abides prosperity and comfort. Such homes, I am\r\n  sure, are represented here this morning--the American home, where the\r\n  father abides in the respect and the mother in the deep love of the\r\n  children that sit about the fireside; where all that makes us good\r\n  is taught and the first rudiments of obedience to law, of orderly\r\n  relations one to another, are put into the young minds. Out of this\r\n  comes social order; on this rests the security of our country.\r\n  The home is the training-school for American citizenship. There we\r\n  learn to defer to others; selfishness is suppressed by the needs of\r\n  those about us. There self-sacrifice, love, and willingness to give\r\n  ourselves for others are born.\r\n\r\n  I thank you that so many of you have come here this morning from\r\n  such homes, and all of us are thankful together that peace rests upon\r\n  our whole country. All of us have pledged ourselves that no sectional\r\n  strife shall ever divide us, and that while abiding in peace with all\r\n  the world we are, against all aggression, one mighty, united people.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I desire to assure you, my countrymen, that in my heart I make no\r\n  distinction between our people anywhere. [Cheers.] I have a deep\r\n  desire that everywhere in all our States there shall be that profound\r\n  respect for the will of the majority, expressed by our voters, that\r\n  shall bring constant peace into all our communities. It is very kind\r\n  of you to come here this morning before breakfast. Perhaps you are\r\n  initiating me into the Texas habit--is it so?--of taking something\r\n  before breakfast. [Laughter and cheers.] This exhilarating draught of\r\n  good-will you have given me this morning will not, I am sure, disturb\r\n  either my digestion or comfort during this day. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSTON, TEXAS, APRIL 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party reached Houston at noon on April 18 and were\r\ngreeted by an enthusiastic assemblage estimated at 20,000. The welcoming\r\ncommittee, headed by Mayor Scherffius, comprised the following-named\r\nprominent citizens: Hon. Charles Stewart, Geo. A. Race, J. W. Temby,\r\nMaj. R. B. Baer, A. K. Taylor, Col. John T. Brady, W. D. Cleveland,\r\nD. C. Smith, C. Lombardi, Dr. E. F. Schmidt, Capt. J. C. Hutcheson,\r\nT. W. House, S. K. Dick, W. B. Chew, James F. Dumble, R. B. Morris,\r\nJames A. Patton, Jr., A. P. Root, W. V. R. Watson, G. W. Kidd, G.\r\nC. Felton, H. W. Garrow, Geo. E. Dickey, F. Halff, John F. Dickson,\r\nE. W. Cave, Charles Dillingham, A. C. Herndon, J. W. Jones, D. M.\r\nAngle, Geo. L. Porter, Rufus Cage, F. A. Rice, Dr. D. F. Stuart, and\r\nPresident Mitchell, of the Commercial Club. Many prominent ladies of\r\nthe city participated in receiving and entertaining the ladies in the\r\npresidential party.\r\n\r\nCongressman Stewart introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--Your faces all respond to the words of welcome\r\n  which have been spoken in your behalf. We have been not only pleased\r\n  but touched by the delicate and kindly expressions of regard which we\r\n  have received since entering the State of Texas. I remained up last\r\n  night until after midnight that I might not unconsciously pass into\r\n  this great State, and I was called very early from my bed this morning\r\n  to receive a draught of welcome, before I had breakfasted, from\r\n  another Texas audience. You have a State whose greatness I think you\r\n  have discovered.\r\n\r\n  A stranger can hardly hope to point out to you that which you\r\n  have not already known. Perhaps Virginia and Kentucky have been\r\n  heard to say more about their respective States than Texas; but I\r\n  think their voices are likely soon to be drowned by the enthusiastic\r\n  and affectionate claims which you will present to the country for\r\n  your great commonwealth. [Cheers.] You have the resources in some\r\n  measure--in a great measure--of all the States gathered within your\r\n  borders; a soil adapted to the production of all the cereals and\r\n  grasses; and to this you add cotton, sugar, and tobacco. You are very\r\n  rightly diversifying your crops, because the history of intelligent\r\n  farming shows that as the crops are diversified the people prosper.\r\n\r\n  All is not staked upon the success of a single crop. You do well,\r\n  therefore, to raise cotton, sugar, and tobacco, and I am glad you are\r\n  not neglecting cattle, sheep, hogs, corn, and all the cereals. We\r\n  have been trying to do what we could from Washington to make for you\r\n  a larger and better market for your enormous meat products. [Cheers.]\r\n  We have felt that the restrictions imposed by some of the European\r\n  governments could not be fairly justified upon the ground stated by\r\n  them. Already the Secretary of Agriculture--himself a farmer, who has\r\n  with his own hands wrought in all the work of the farm--has succeeded\r\n  in procuring the removal of some of these injurious restrictions,\r\n  and has announced to the country that exportation of cattle has\r\n  increased 100 per cent. in the last year. [Cheers.] I beg to assure\r\n  you that these interests will have the most careful attention from\r\n  the Government at Washington and from our representatives at foreign\r\n  courts. It is believed that we have now by legislation a system of\r\n  sanitary inspection of our meat products that, when once put in\r\n  operation and examined by the European governments, will remove the\r\n  last excuse for the exclusion of our meats from those foreign states.\r\n\r\n  Our time is so limited that I can scarcely say more than \"thank\r\n  you.\" We cannot at all repay you for this demonstration of welcome,\r\n  but let me say that in all your prosperity I shall rejoice. I do\r\n  desire that all our legislation and all our institutions and the\r\n  combined energies of all our people shall work together for the common\r\n  good of all our States and all our population. [Great cheering.] You\r\n  have great resources of a material sort, and yet above all this I\r\n  rejoice that the timely forethought of your public men has provided an\r\n  unexampled school fund for the education of the children.\r\n\r\n  These things that partake of the life that is spiritual are better\r\n  after all than the material. Indeed, there can be no true prosperity\r\n  in any State or community where they are not thoughtfully fostered.\r\n  Good social order, respect for the law, regard for other men's rights,\r\n  orderly, peaceful administration are the essential things in any\r\n  community. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGALVESTON, TEXAS, APRIL 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President and his party, accompanied by Governor Hogg, arrived at\r\nGalveston on the afternoon of Saturday, April 18, and were tendered\r\nan ovation by the hospitable residents of the Island City. The\r\ndistinguished travellers were met at Houston by a committee of escort\r\nconsisting of Chairman Leo N. Levi, George Sealy, Julius Runge, R. B.\r\nHawley, W. F. Ladd, Col. R. G. Lowe, Maj. C. J. Allen, Aldermen C. M.\r\nMason and T. W. Jackson, D. D. Bryan, J. W. Burson, Mrs. R. L. Fulton,\r\nMrs. R. B. Hawley, Mrs. Aaron Blum, Mrs. W. F. Ladd, and Mrs. C. J.\r\nAllen.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in the city the President was welcomed by the other members\r\nof the Reception Committee, headed by Mayor Roger L. Fulton, the Board\r\nof Aldermen, and the following prominent citizens: Leon Blum, R. S.\r\nWillis, J. C. League, H. A. Landes, J. E. Wallis, Col. J. S. Rogers, P.\r\nJ. Willis, Robert Bornefeld, C. C. Sweeney, M. F. Mott, Albert Weis, M.\r\nLasker, J. Z. Miller, Fen Cannon, Col. John D. Rogers, J. N. Sawyer, W.\r\nH. Sinclair, Joseph Cuney, Geo. Seeligson, Julius Weber, J. D. Skinner,\r\nThos. H. Sweeney, James Montgomery, F. L. Dana, James Moore, W. F.\r\nBeers, J. H. Hutchings, Wm. H. Masters, M. W. Shaw, W. B. Denson, H.\r\nB. Cullum, C. H. Rickert, W. B. Lockhart, U. Muller, F. Lammers, H. F.\r\nSproule, Judge C. L. Cleveland, Judge Wm. H. Stewart, R. T. Wheeler, N.\r\nW. Cuney, Thomas W. Cain, Samuel Penland, R. G. Street, J. Lobit, D.\r\nM. Erlich, C. M. Trueheart, L. Fellman, C. R. Reifel, Charles Vidor,\r\nGeorge Butler, W. Vowrinckle, Joe Owens, C. E. Angel, Rev. S. M. Bird,\r\nDr. A. W. Fly, Dr. J. T. Y. Paine, Dr. H. P. Cooke, J. R. Gibson, Howard\r\nCarnes, Charles Maddox, Bishop Gallagher, Rev. A. T. Spaulding, A. B.\r\nTuller, Dr. J. D. Daviss, Rev. J. E. Edwards, A. B. Homer, Rev. Joseph\r\nB. Sears, J. Singer, R. C. Johnson, J. W. Riddell, B. Tiernan, T. A.\r\nGary, John Focke, Joseph Scott, W. E. McDonald, Geo. Schneider, F. O.\r\nBecker, Thomas Goggan, J. D. Sherwood, O. H. Cooper, E. O'C. MacInerney,\r\nThos. S. King, Robert Day, Daniel Buckley, J. J. Hanna, F. W. Fickett,\r\nWm. Selkirk, and J. A. Robertson.\r\n\r\nImmediately following their arrival the presidential party, escorted by\r\nHon. Wm. H. Crain, Mr. Leon Blum, and other members of the Reception\r\nCommittee, enjoyed a trip about the harbor aboard one of the Mallory\r\nline steamships, enabling them to view the extensive Government works\r\nfor deepening the channel at the entrance to the harbor. This excursion\r\nwas followed by a ride across the island amid a shower of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe parade was participated in by all the military and industrial\r\norganizations of the city; also by the Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias,\r\nand other orders, and was a most imposing demonstration. The G. A. R.\r\nveterans acted as a guard of honor to the President on the march, and\r\nthe day was just closing when the column arrived at the Beach Hotel,\r\non the very shore of the Gulf of Mexico, where the formal address of\r\nwelcome was ably delivered by Gen. T. N. Waul.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison's response was the longest speech of his trip, and\r\nattracted wide-spread and favorable comment. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We close to-night a whole week of travel, a\r\n  whole week of hand-shaking, a whole week of talking. I have before me\r\n  10,000 miles of hand-shaking and speaking, and I am not, by reason of\r\n  what this week has brought me, in voice to contend with the fine but\r\n  rather strong Gulf breeze which pours in upon us to-night; and yet it\r\n  comes to me laden with the fragrance of your welcome. [Cheers.] It\r\n  comes with the softness, refreshment, and grace which have accompanied\r\n  all my intercourse with the people of Texas. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  The magnificent and cordial demonstration which you have made in our\r\n  honor to-day will always remain a bright and pleasant picture in my\r\n  memory. [Great cheers.] I am glad to have been able to rest my eyes\r\n  upon the city of Galveston. I am glad to have been able to traverse\r\n  this harbor and to look upon that work which a liberal and united\r\n  Government has inaugurated for your benefit and for the benefit of\r\n  the Northwest. [Great and prolonged cheers.] I have always believed\r\n  that it was one of the undisputed functions of the general Government\r\n  to make these great waterways which penetrate our country and these\r\n  harbors into which our shipping must come to receive the tribute of\r\n  rail and river safe and easy of access.\r\n\r\n  This ministering care should extend to our whole country, and I\r\n  am glad that, adopting a policy with reference to the harbor work,\r\n  here at least, which I insisted upon in a public message [great and\r\n  prolonged cheering], the appropriation has been made adequate to a\r\n  diligent and prompt completion of the work. [Great cheering.] In\r\n  the past the Government has undertaken too many things at once, and\r\n  its annual appropriations have been so inadequate that the work of\r\n  the engineers was much retarded and often seriously damaged in the\r\n  interval of waiting for fresh appropriations.\r\n\r\n  It is a better policy, when a work has once been determined to be of\r\n  national significance, that the appropriation should be sufficient to\r\n  bring it speedily and without loss to a conclusion. [Great cheering.]\r\n  I am glad that the scheme of the engineer for giving deep water to\r\n  Galveston is thus to be prosecuted.\r\n\r\n  I have said some of our South Atlantic and Gulf ports occupy a most\r\n  favorable position for the new commerce toward which we are reaching\r\n  out our hands, and which is reaching out its hands to us. [Great\r\n  cheering.] I am an economist in the sense that I would not waste\r\n  one dollar of public money, but I am not an economist in the sense\r\n  that I would leave incomplete or suffer to lag any great work highly\r\n  promotive of the true interests of our people. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n  We are great enough and rich enough to reach forward to grander\r\n  conceptions than have entered the minds of some of our statesmen in\r\n  the past. If you are content, I am not, that the nations of Europe\r\n  shall absorb nearly the entire commerce of these near sister republics\r\n  that lie south of us. It is naturally in large measure ours--ours by\r\n  neighborhood, ours by nearness of access, ours by that sympathy that\r\n  binds a hemisphere without a king. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  The inauguration of the Three Americas Congress, or more properly\r\n  the American Conference, the happy conduct of that meeting, the\r\n  wise and comprehensive measures which were suggested by it, with\r\n  the fraternal and kindly spirit that was manifested by our southern\r\n  neighbors, has stimulated a desire in them and in our people for a\r\n  larger intercourse of commerce and of friendship. The provisions of\r\n  the bill passed at the last session looking to a reciprocity of trade\r\n  not only met with my official approval when I signed the bill, but\r\n  with my zealous promotion before the bill was reported. [Great and\r\n  prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n  Its provision concerning reciprocity is that we have placed upon our\r\n  free list sugar, tea, coffee and hides, and have said to those nations\r\n  from whom we receive these great staples: Give us free access to your\r\n  ports for an equivalent amount of our produce in exchange, or we will\r\n  reimpose duties upon the articles named. The law leaves it wholly to\r\n  the Executive to negotiate these arrangements. It does not need that\r\n  they shall take the form of a treaty.\r\n\r\n  They need not be submitted for the concurrence of the Senate. It\r\n  only needs that we, having made our offer, shall receive their offer\r\n  in return; and when they shall have made up an acceptable schedule of\r\n  articles produced by us that shall have free access to their ports,\r\n  a proclamation by the President closes the whole business. [Cheers.]\r\n  Already one treaty with that youngest of the South American republics,\r\n  the great republic of Brazil, has been negotiated and proclaimed. I\r\n  think, without disclosing an Executive secret, I may tell you that\r\n  the arrangement with Brazil is not likely to abide in lonesomeness\r\n  much longer [great and prolonged cheering]; that others are to follow,\r\n  and that as a result of these trade arrangements the products of\r\n  the United States--our meats, our breadstuffs, and certain lines of\r\n  manufactured goods--are to find free or favored access to the ports of\r\n  many of these South and Central American States. All the States will\r\n  share in these benefits. We have had some analysis of the manifests\r\n  of some of our steamers now sailing to South American ports, and in a\r\n  single steamer it was found that twenty-five States contributed to the\r\n  cargo.\r\n\r\n  But we shall need something more. We shall need American steamships\r\n  to carry American goods to these ports. [Great cheering.] The last\r\n  Congress passed a bill appropriating about $1,500,000, and authorized\r\n  the Postmaster-General to contract with steamship companies for a\r\n  period not exceeding ten years for the carrying of the United States\r\n  mail. The foreign mail service is the only mail service out of which\r\n  the Government has been making a net profit. We do not make a profit\r\n  out of our land service.\r\n\r\n  There is an annual deficiency which my good friend the\r\n  Postmaster-General has been trying very hard to reduce or wipe out.\r\n  The theory of our mail service is that it is for the people, that we\r\n  are not to make a profit out of it, that we are to give them as cheap\r\n  postage as is possible. We are, many of us, looking forward to a time\r\n  when we shall have one-cent postage in this country. [Cheers.] We have\r\n  been so close and penurious in dealing with our ships in the carrying\r\n  of foreign mails that we have actually made revenues out of that\r\n  business, not having spent for it what we have received from it. Now\r\n  we propose to change that policy and to make more liberal contracts\r\n  with American lines carrying American mail. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Some one may say we ought not to go into this business, that it is\r\n  subsidy. But, my friend, every other great nation of the world has\r\n  been doing it and is doing it to-day. Great Britain and France have\r\n  built up their great steamship lines by Government aid, and it seems\r\n  to me our attitude with reference to that is aptly portrayed by an\r\n  illustration I mentioned the other day. In olden times no wholesale\r\n  merchant sent out travelling men to solicit custom, but he stood\r\n  in his own store and waited for his customers. But presently some\r\n  enterprising merchant began to send out men with their samples to seek\r\n  the trade, to save the country buyer the cost of the trip to New York\r\n  or Philadelphia, until finally that practice has become universal, and\r\n  these active, intelligent travelling men are scurrying this country\r\n  over, pushing and soliciting in their several lines of business. Now\r\n  imagine some conservative merchant in New York saying to himself: \"All\r\n  this is wrong; the trade ought to come to me.\" If he should refuse to\r\n  adopt these modern methods what would be the result? He must adopt\r\n  the new methods or go out of business. We have been refusing to adopt\r\n  the universal method of our competitors in commerce to stimulate\r\n  their shipping interest and have gone out of the business. [Laughter\r\n  and cheers.] Encouraged by what your spokesman has said to-night,\r\n  I venture to declare that I am in favor of going into business\r\n  again, and when it is re-established I hope Galveston will be in the\r\n  partnership. [Great cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It has been the careful study of the Postmaster-General in preparing\r\n  to execute the law to which I have referred to see how much increase\r\n  in routes and ships we could secure by it. We have said to the few\r\n  existing American lines: You must not treat this appropriation as\r\n  a plate of soup, to be divided and consumed. You must give us new\r\n  lines, new ships, increased trips, and new ports of call. Already the\r\n  steamship lines are looking over the routes to see what they can do,\r\n  with a view of increasing their tonnage and establishing new lines.\r\n\r\n  The Postmaster-General has invited the attention and suggestion\r\n  of all the boards of trade of all our seaboard cities. Undoubtedly\r\n  you have received such a letter. This appropriation is for one year;\r\n  what the future is to be must depend upon the deliberate judgment of\r\n  the people. If during my term of office they shall strike down a law\r\n  that I believe to be beneficial or destroy its energy by withholding\r\n  appropriations, I shall bow to their will, but I shall feel great\r\n  disappointment if we do not make an era for the revival of American\r\n  commerce. I do much want that the time shall come when our citizens\r\n  living in temporary exile in foreign ports shall now and then see\r\n  steaming into these distant ports a fine modern man-of-war, flying the\r\n  United States flag [cheers], with the best modern guns on her deck,\r\n  and a brave American crew in her forecastle. [Cheers.] I want, also,\r\n  that in these ports, so long unfamiliar with the American flag, there\r\n  shall again be found our steamships and our sailing vessels flying the\r\n  flag that we all love, and carrying from our shores the products that\r\n  these men of toil have brought to them to exchange for the products of\r\n  other climes.\r\n\r\n  I think we should add to all this, and happily it is likely to\r\n  be accomplished by individual efforts, the early completion of the\r\n  Nicaragua Canal. [Cheers.] The Pacific coast should no longer be found\r\n  by sea only by the passage of the Horn. The short route should be\r\n  opened, and it will be, and then with this wondrous stirring among the\r\n  people of all our States, this awakening to new business plans and\r\n  more careful and economical work, there will come great prosperity to\r\n  all our people. Texas will spin more of the cotton that she raises.\r\n\r\n  The great States of the South will be in discontent with the old\r\n  condition that made them simply agricultural States, and will rouse\r\n  themselves to compete with the older manufacturing States of the North\r\n  and East. [Cheers.] The vision I have, all the thoughts I have of this\r\n  matter embrace all the States and all my countrymen. I do not think of\r\n  it as a question of party; I think of it as a great American question.\r\n  [Cheers.] By the invitation of the address which was made to me I have\r\n  freely spoken my mind to you on these topics. I hope I have done so\r\n  with no offence or impropriety. [Cries of \"No, no!\" and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I would not on an occasion so full of general good feeling as this\r\n  obtrude anything that should induce division or dissent. For all\r\n  who do dissent I have the most respectful tolerance. The views I\r\n  hold are the result of some thought and investigation, and as they\r\n  are questions of public concern I confidently submit them to the\r\n  arbitrament of brave and enlightened American suffrage. [Applause and\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, APRIL 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President and his party passed their first Sunday at Galveston,\r\nleaving the Island City at midnight and arriving at San Antonio at\r\n11:15 Monday morning. A special committee, consisting of Hon. C. W.\r\nOgden, Chairman; Col. C. M. Terrell, S. M. Johnson, J. S. McNamara,\r\nMrs. Ogden, Mrs. Johnson, and Miss Eleanor Sullivan, escorted the party\r\nfrom Galveston. The _Alamo City_ was profusely decorated in honor of\r\nthe visit, and a great throng greeted the President's arrival. He was\r\nreceived by the Hon. Bryan Callaghan, Mayor of the city, at the head of\r\nthe following committee of leading citizens: Gen. David S. Stanley, U.\r\nS. A.; Col. J. P. Martin, Col. W. B. Wright, Col. H. B. Andrews, Maj. C.\r\nC. Cresson, Hon. W. W. King, L. M. Gregory, B. F. Yoakum, C. W. Ogden,\r\nH. D. Kampmann, J. S. Alexander, W. J. B. Patterson, A. W. Houston,\r\nReagan Houston, Richard Wooley, Jr., R. H. Russell, N. Mackey, George\r\nDullnig, J. V. Dignowity, J. S. Thornton, F. Groos, H. P. Drought, D.\r\nSullivan, Charles Hugo, Rev. Dr. Giddings, C. K. Breneman, W. H. Weiss,\r\nFrank Grice, Alex. Joske, Henry Elmendorf, Robert Driscoll, Paul Wagner,\r\nJ. Ronse, J. E. Pancoast, Adolph Wagner, George H. Kalteyer, Charles J.\r\nLangholz, C. B. Mullaly, R. H. McCracken, A. G. Cooper, Dr. G. Graham\r\nWatts, Dr. J. P. Ornealus, Dr. Amos Graves, and A. T. Wilson. Mayor\r\nMcDonald, of Austin, and Hon. L. L. Foster also participated in the\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nA rainstorm interfered with the parade, and the public reception\r\nwas held at the Opera House, thousands being unable to enter. Mayor\r\nCallaghan made the welcoming address and introduced President Harrison,\r\nwho spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I very much regret that frequent\r\n  speaking in the open air during the past week and the very heavy\r\n  atmosphere which we have this morning have somewhat impaired my\r\n  voice. I am sure you will crown your hospitality and kindness by\r\n  allowing me to speak to you very briefly. I sympathize with you in the\r\n  distress which you feel that the day is so unpropitious for any street\r\n  demonstration, but I have been told by one wise in such matters that\r\n  this rain is worth $5,000,000 to Western Texas. That being the case,\r\n  it greatly moderates our regret. It has come to be a popular habit\r\n  of attributing to the President whatever weather may happen on any\r\n  demonstration in which he takes a part. I suppose I may claim credit\r\n  this morning for this beneficial rain. [Applause.] I generously assure\r\n  you that if it is worth as much money as my friend has estimated I\r\n  shall not take more than half that sum. [Laughter.] In visiting for\r\n  a little while this historic city, I had anticipated great pleasure\r\n  in looking upon the remains of an earlier occupancy of this territory\r\n  in which you now dwell. Our glance this morning must be brief and\r\n  imperfect, but the history has been written and the traditions of\r\n  these martyrdoms which occurred here for liberty are fresh in your\r\n  minds and are still an inspiring story to be repeated to your children.\r\n\r\n  I remember in my early boyhood to have heard in our family thrilling\r\n  descriptions of the experiences of an uncle, whose name I bear, in\r\n  some of those campaigns for freedom in Texas in which he took a part,\r\n  so that the story to me goes back to those dim early recollections of\r\n  childhood. I am glad to stand where those recollections are revived\r\n  and freshened, for they were events of momentous importance to this\r\n  country, to this State, and to the whole Union. I rejoice that you\r\n  have here so great a commonwealth. The stipulations under which Texas\r\n  came into the Union of the States, and which provided that that great\r\n  Territory might be subdivided into five States, seem not to attract\r\n  much attention in Texas now.\r\n\r\n  Indeed, as far as I can judge, no man would be able successfully to\r\n  appeal to the suffrages of any hamlet in Texas upon the issue that\r\n  the State should be divided at all. [Cheers.] The great industrial\r\n  capacities which you have, the beneficent climate that spreads over\r\n  much of your vast territory, the great variety of productions which\r\n  your soil and climate render possible, give a promise for the future\r\n  of a prominence among the great States of the Union that seems to me\r\n  can scarcely fail to bring Texas to the front rank. [Cheers.] You are\r\n  only now beginning to plough this vast stretch of land. You are only\r\n  now beginning to diversify those interests, to emancipate yourselves\r\n  by producing at home in your fields all of those products which are\r\n  necessary to comfortable existence.\r\n\r\n  I hope you will soon add, indeed, you are now largely adding, to\r\n  this diversity of agricultural pursuits a diversity of mechanical\r\n  pursuits. The advantages which you have to transmute the great\r\n  production of the field into the manufactured product are very great.\r\n  There can be certainly no reason why a very large part of the million\r\n  bales of cotton which you produce should not be spun in Texas.\r\n  [Cheers.] I hope your people will more and more turn their thoughts to\r\n  this matter, for just in proportion as a community or State suitably\r\n  divides its energies among various industries, so does it retain the\r\n  wealth it produces and increase its population. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  A great Englishman, visiting this country some time ago, in speaking\r\n  of the impressions which were made upon his mind, said he was\r\n  constantly asked as he travelled through the country whether he was\r\n  not amazed at its territorial extent. He said while this, of course,\r\n  was a notable incident of travel, he wondered that we did not forget\r\n  all our bigness of territory in a contemplation of the great spectacle\r\n  we presented as a free people in organized and peaceful community. He\r\n  regarded this side of our country and her institutions as much more\r\n  important than its material development or its territorial extent, and\r\n  he was right in that judgment.\r\n\r\n  My fellow-citizens, the pride of America, that which should attract\r\n  the admiration and has attracted the imagination of many people upon\r\n  the face of the earth, is our system of government. [Applause.] I am\r\n  glad to know, and to have expressed my satisfaction before, that here\r\n  in this State of Texas you are giving attention to education; that\r\n  you have been able to erect a school fund, the interest upon which\r\n  promises a most magnificent endowment for your common schools. These\r\n  schools are the pride and safety of your State. They gather into them\r\n  upon a common level with us, and I hope with you, the children of the\r\n  rich and poor. In the State in which I dwell everybody's children\r\n  attend the common schools.\r\n\r\n  This lesson of equality, the perfect system which has been developed\r\n  by this method of instruction, is training a valued class of citizens\r\n  to take up the responsibilities of government when we shall lay them\r\n  down. [Applause.] I hope every one of your communities, even your\r\n  scattered rural communities, will pursue this good work. I am sure\r\n  this hope is shared by my honored host, Governor Hogg, who sits beside\r\n  me [applause], and who, in the discharge of his public duties, can\r\n  influence the progress of this great measure. No material greatness,\r\n  no wealth, no accumulation of splendor, is to be compared with those\r\n  humble and homely virtues which have generally characterized our\r\n  American homes.\r\n\r\n  The safety of the State, the good order of the community--all\r\n  that is good--the capacity, indeed, to produce material wealth, is\r\n  dependent upon intelligence and social order. [Applause.] Wealth and\r\n  commerce are timid creatures; they must be assured that the nest will\r\n  be safe before they build. So it is always in those communities where\r\n  the most perfect order is maintained, where intelligence is protected,\r\n  where the Church of God and the institutions of religion are revered\r\n  and respected, that we find the largest development in material\r\n  wealth. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Thanking you for your cordial greeting, thanking all your people,\r\n  and especially the Governor of your State, for courtesies which have\r\n  been unfailing, for a cordiality and friendliness that has not found\r\n  any stint or repression in the fact that we are of different political\r\n  opinions [great cheering], I beg to thank you for this special\r\n  manifestation of respect, and to ask you to excuse me from further\r\n  speech. I shall follow such arrangements as your committee have made,\r\n  and shall be glad if in those arrangements there is some provision by\r\n  which I may meet as many of you as possible individually. [Prolonged\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEL RIO, TEXAS, APRIL 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief incident of the long run from San Antonio to El Paso was the\r\nenthusiastic reception tendered the President by the residents of the\r\nthriving frontier town of Del Rio, county seat of Val Verde County. The\r\ntown was handsomely decorated, and the following Reception Committee\r\nwelcomed the President and party: Judge W. K. Jones, C. S. Brodbent,\r\nZeno Fielder, J. A. Price, H. D. Bonnett, E. L. Dignowity, Paul Flato,\r\nClyde Woods, Thomas Cunningham, W. C. Easterling, J. C. Clarkson, E. G.\r\nNicholson, C. G. Leighton, and R. J. Felder.\r\n\r\nRev. Dr. H. S. Thrall, the veteran historian of Texas, delivered the\r\naddress of welcome. The President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I had supposed when we left San Antonio that we were\r\n  not to be stopped very often between that point and El Paso with such\r\n  assemblages of our fellow-citizens. We had settled down to an easy\r\n  way of living on the train, and I had supposed that speech-making\r\n  would not be taken up until to-morrow. I thank you most cordially\r\n  for this friendly evidence of your interest, and I assure you that\r\n  all of these matters to which your spokesman has alluded are having\r\n  the most careful consideration of the authorities at Washington.\r\n  The Secretary of Agriculture, who is with me on the train, has been\r\n  diligent in an effort to open European markets for American meats,\r\n  and he has succeeded so far that our exportation has very largely\r\n  increased in the last year. It is our hope that these restrictions\r\n  may still further be removed, and that American meat products may\r\n  have a still larger market in Europe than they have had for very many\r\n  years past. The inspections now provided by law certainly must remove\r\n  every reasonable objection to the use of American meats; for we shall\r\n  demonstrate to them that they are perfectly wholesome and pure. I want\r\n  to say, from the time of my induction into office until this hour I\r\n  have had before me constantly the need of the American farmer of a\r\n  larger market for his products. [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and cheers.]\r\n  Whatever we can do to accomplish that will be done. I want to thank\r\n  the public-school children for this address which they have placed in\r\n  my hands. What a blessed thing it is that the public school system is\r\n  found with the pioneer! It follows the buffalo very closely. I am\r\n  glad to find that your children are being trained in intelligence and\r\n  in those moral restraints which shall make them good citizens. I thank\r\n  you for your kindly presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL PASO, TEXAS, APRIL 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enterprising city of El Paso was reached at 10 o'clock Tuesday\r\nmorning, and the President was tendered a veritable ovation. The\r\nreception at this point partook of an international aspect. President\r\nDiaz of Mexico was represented in the person of Governor Carrillo,\r\nChief Executive of the State of Chihuahua, accompanied by a brilliant\r\nstaff of 20 officers. The War Department of the Mexican Government was\r\nrepresented by Gen. José Maria Ranjel, Chief of the Second Military\r\nZone, accompanied by his staff, a company of artillery, and the Eleventh\r\nBattalion Band of 45 instruments. From the City of Mexico came Col.\r\nRicardo Villanueva and Col. Ygnacio J. Monroy, representing the Federal\r\nGovernment, while the neighboring city of Juarez was represented by\r\nColonel Ross, commander of the garrison, Señor Mejia, Señor Urtetiga,\r\nand many other prominent citizens. The city of El Paso was represented\r\nby Mayor Richard Caples and the members of the City Council. The\r\nCitizens' Committee of Reception comprised W. S. Hills, Chairman; E. B.\r\nBronson, M. B. Davis, S. W. Russell, W. F. Payne, Frank P. Clark, C. F.\r\nSlack, Geo. L. Stewart, H. S. Beattie, Judge Allen Blacker, A. Solomon,\r\nW. B. Merrick, A. Berla, Louis Papin, Geo. E. Bovee, James A. Smith,\r\nHon. S. W. T. Lanham, A. J. Eaton, Z. T. White, W. S. McCutcheon, A. M.\r\nLoomis, H. C. Myles, Ben Schuster, A. J. Sampson, D. W. Reckhart, and J.\r\nF. Satterthwaite.\r\n\r\nGovernor Carrillo stood beside President Harrison during the reception.\r\nAfter the distinguished Mexicans had paid their respects and greeted our\r\nChief Magistrate, Gen. A. G. Malloy, on behalf of the citizens of El\r\nPaso, in an eloquent address welcomed him to the Gate City of the two\r\nrepublics.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have been journeying for several days\r\n  throughout the great State of Texas. We are now about to leave her\r\n  territory and receive from you this parting salutation. Our entrance\r\n  into the State was with every demonstration of respect and enthusiasm.\r\n  This is a fitting close to the magnificent expression which the\r\n  people of this State have given to us. I am glad to stand at this\r\n  gateway of trade with the great republic of Mexico. [Cries of \"Hear!\r\n  hear!\" and cheers.] I am glad to know that it is not only a gateway\r\n  of commerce, but a gateway of friendship [cheers]; that not only do\r\n  these hurrying vehicles of commerce bear the products of the fields\r\n  and mines in mutual exchange, but that they have facilitated those\r\n  personal relations which have promoted and must yet more promote the\r\n  friendliness of two independent liberty-loving peoples. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I receive with great satisfaction these tributes of respect\r\n  which have been brought to me by the Governor of Chihuahua and the\r\n  representatives of the army of Mexico. [Cheers.] I desire to return to\r\n  them and through them to the people of Mexico and to that illustrious\r\n  and progressive statesman who presides over her destinies [cheers] not\r\n  only my sincere personal regard, but an assurance of the friendliness\r\n  and respect of the American Government and the American people. I look\r\n  forward with interest to a larger development of our trade; to the\r\n  opening of new lines of commerce and new avenues of friendship. We\r\n  have passed that era in our history, I hope, when we were aggressive\r\n  and unpleasant neighbors. We do not covet the territory of any other\r\n  people [cheers], but do covet their friendship and those trade\r\n  exchanges which are mutually profitable. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now to you, my fellow-citizens, I bring congratulations for\r\n  the rapid development which you are making here, and extend the most\r\n  cordial good wishes for the realization of every hope you have for\r\n  El Paso and its neighborhood. [Cheers.] All republics are builded\r\n  on the respect and confidence of the people. They are enduring and\r\n  stable as their institutions and their rulers continue to preserve\r\n  their respect. I rejoice that those influences that tend to soften the\r\n  asperities of human life--the home, the school, and the church--have\r\n  kept pace with the enterprises of commerce and are established here\r\n  among you. All commerce and trade rest upon the foundation of social\r\n  order. You cannot attract an increased citizenship except as you give\r\n  to the world a reputation for social order [cheers], in which crime is\r\n  suppressed, in which the rights of the humble are respected [cheers],\r\n  and where the courts stand as the safe bulwark of the personal and\r\n  public rights of every citizen, however poor. [Cheers.] I trust that\r\n  as your city grows you will see that these foundations are carefully\r\n  and broadly laid, and then you may hope that the superstructure,\r\n  magnificent in its dimensions, perfect in its security and grace,\r\n  shall rise in your midst. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to meet my comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic\r\n  [cheers], the survivors of the grand struggle for the Union. It was\r\n  one of the few wars in history that brought blessings to the \"victors\r\n  and vanquished,\" and was followed by no proscriptions, no block, no\r\n  executions, but by the reception of those who had striven for the\r\n  destruction of the country into friendly citizenship, laying upon them\r\n  no yoke that was not borne by the veterans--that of obedience to the\r\n  law and a due respect for the rights of others. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Again, sir [to the Mexican representative], I thank you for the\r\n  friendly greeting you have brought from across this narrow river that\r\n  separates us, and to you my fellow-countrymen, I extend my thanks and\r\n  bid you good-by. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMING, NEW MEXICO, APRIL 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the train crossed the Rio Grande and entered New Mexico Hon. L.\r\nBradford Prince, Governor of that Territory, gave the Chief Magistrate\r\na cordial welcome. Deming was reached at 2 o'clock. The city was in\r\nholiday attire; a battery of artillery thundered the presidential\r\nsalute, two companies of the Tenth Cavalry, under Captain Keyes, came\r\nto a present as the President appeared, and the Twenty-fourth Infantry\r\nBand burst forth in patriotic strains. The Committee of Reception\r\ncomprised the following prominent citizens: Judge Boone, C. H. Dane, B.\r\nA. Knowles, J. R. Meyers, A. J. Clark, J. P. Bryon, W. H. Hudson, S.\r\nM. Ashenfelter, Gustav Wormser, Ed. Pennington, W. Burg, James Martin,\r\nColonel Fitzerell, James A. Lockhart, Seaman Field, John Corbett, E.\r\nG. Ross, and Robert Campbell. Professor Hayes delivered the welcoming\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nIn reply President Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It gives me great pleasure to tarry for a\r\n  moment here and to receive out on these broad and sandy plains the\r\n  same evidence of friendliness that has greeted me in the States. I\r\n  feel great interest in your people, and thinking that you have labored\r\n  under a disadvantage by reason of the unsettled state of your land\r\n  titles--because no country can settle up and become populous while the\r\n  titles to its land remain insecure--it was my pleasure to urge upon\r\n  Congress, both in a general and special message, the establishment of\r\n  a special land court to settle this question once for all. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad that the statute is now a law, and immediately upon my\r\n  return from this trip I expect to announce the judges of that court,\r\n  and to set them immediately to work upon these cases, so that you\r\n  shall certainly, within two years, have all these questions settled.\r\n  I hope you will then see an increase of population that has not as\r\n  yet been possible, and which will tend to develop your great mineral\r\n  resources and open up your lands to settlement. Thanking you, on\r\n  behalf of our party, for this pleasant greeting, I bid you good-by.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORDSBURG, NEW MEXICO, APRIL 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Lordsburg, New Mexico, the train made a brief stop. A number of\r\ncitizens, headed by Don. H. Kedzee, welcomed the President and presented\r\nhim a handsome silver box, manufactured from metal mined in the\r\nvicinity. On the case was inscribed, \"Protect the chief industry of our\r\nTerritories. Give us free coinage of silver.\" In accepting the memento\r\nthe President said: \"Mr. Kedzee and gentlemen, I thank you for this\r\ncordial welcome and for this elegant souvenir, and assure you due care\r\nwill be taken of your interests.\" [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUCSON, ARIZONA, APRIL 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nTucson, the metropolis of Arizona, was brilliantly illuminated in\r\nhonor of the visitors, who were welcomed by 5,000 citizens and a band\r\nof Papago Indians. Negley Post, G. A. R., J. J. Hill, Commander,\r\nrepresented the veterans. The city government was present in the persons\r\nof Mayor Frederick Maish and Councilmen M. G. Sameniego, M. Lamont, Geo.\r\nLesure, Wm. Reid, Frank Miltenberg, and Julius Goldbaum. The Committee\r\nof Reception on the part of the citizens comprised many of the most\r\ndistinguished men of the Territory as well as of the city, among whom\r\nwere: Federal Judges R. E. Sloan and H. C. Gooding, Gen. R. A. Johnson,\r\nGen. R. H. Paul, Charles R. Drake, Herbert Brown, Brewster Cameron,\r\nJ. Knox Corbett, George Christ, J. S. McGee, S. Ainsa, Samuel Hughes,\r\nJuan Elias, Rev. Howard Billman, Albert Steinfeld, H. S. Stevens, M.\r\nP. Freeman, S. M. Franklin, W. C. Davis, W. M. Lovell, J. S. Noble, H.\r\nB. Tenny, F. H. Hereford, D. C. Driscoll, J. C. Handy, J. A. Black,\r\nThomas Hughes, A. J. Keen, J. M. Ormsby, H. E. Lacy, G. B. Henry, Frank\r\nAllison, George Pusch, H. W. Fenner, R. D. Furguson, F. J. Henry, and C.\r\nC. Eyster.\r\n\r\nHon. Thos. F. Wilson made the address of welcome. The President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is surprising as well as gratifying to\r\n  see so many friends assembled to greet us on our arrival at Tucson\r\n  to-night. I beg to assure you that the interests of the Territories\r\n  are very close to my heart. By reason of my service as Chairman of the\r\n  Territory Committee in the United States Senate I was brought to study\r\n  very closely the needs of the Territories. I have had great pleasure\r\n  issuing the proclamations admitting five Territories to the sisterhood\r\n  of States since I became President. I realize the condition of the\r\n  people of the Territory without having representation in Congress as\r\n  one of disadvantage, and I am friendly to the suggestion that these\r\n  Territories, as they have sufficient population to sustain a State\r\n  Government and to secure suitable administration of the own affairs,\r\n  shall be received into the Union. [Cheers.] It will be gratifying to\r\n  me if you shall come into that condition during the time that I occupy\r\n  the presidential chair. [Cheers.] I thank you again for your cordial\r\n  demonstration, and beg to present to you that gentleman of the Cabinet\r\n  who has charge of the postal affairs, Mr. Wanamaker. [Prolonged\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 22d brought the President and his party out of the\r\ngreat desert to the borders of California, where at Indio, the first\r\nstation, they were enthusiastically greeted by the Governor of the\r\nState, Hon. Henry H. Markham, at the head of the following distinguished\r\ncommittee: Senator Charles N. Felton, ex-Gov. Geo. C. Perkins, Col.\r\nCharles F. Crocker, Hon. R. F. Del Valle, Hon. Stephen M. White, Gen.\r\nE. P. Johnson, Hon. Hervey Lindley, Hon. Freeman G. Teed, Hon. Irwin\r\nC. Stump, Hon. Frank McCoppin, and Adjutant-General Allen. From the\r\ndistricts adjacent to Indio were gathered several hundred people to\r\ngreet the Chief Magistrate, mostly Indians. Postmaster A. G. Tingman\r\nintroduced the venerable Chief Cabazon, head of the Cohuilla tribe\r\nand over 100 years old, who presented a petition to the President\r\nasking that the lands guaranteed his people by the treaty with Mexico\r\nbe restored to them. Governor Markham delivered a cordial welcoming\r\naddress, wherein he reviewed the wonderful growth of California.\r\n\r\nThe President, in reply, said he would not undertake, while almost\r\nchoked with the dust of the plains he had just left, to say all that\r\nhe hoped to say in the way of pleasant greetings to the citizens of\r\nCalifornia. Some time, when he had been refreshed by their olive oil and\r\ntheir vineyards, he would endeavor to express his gratification at being\r\nable to visit California. He had long desired to visit California, and\r\nit was the objective point of this trip. He had seen the northern coast\r\nand Puget Sound, but had never before been able to see California. He\r\nremembered from boyhood the excitement of the discovery of gold, and\r\nhad always distantly followed California's growth and progress. The\r\nacquisition of California was second only to that of Louisiana and the\r\ncontrol of the Mississippi River. It secured us this great coast, and\r\nmade impossible the ownership of a foreign power on any of our coast\r\nline. It has helped to perfect our magnificent isolation, which is our\r\ngreat protection against foreign aggression. He thanked the Governor and\r\ncommittee for their kindly reception, and assured them that if he should\r\nhave any complaints to make of his treatment in California it would be\r\nbecause its people had been too hospitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLTON, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Colton the presidential party were enthusiastically greeted by\r\nseveral thousand people. The Citizens' Committee comprised A. B. Miner,\r\nChairman; Dr. Fox, J. B. Shepardson, Wilson Hays, W. H. Wright, F. M.\r\nHubbard, Dr. Hutchinson, H. B. Smith, J. W. Davis, S. M. Goddard, J. B.\r\nHanna, Captain Topp, W. W. Wilcox, M. A. Murphy, Prof. Mathews, R. A.\r\nKuhn, C. B. Hamilton, J. M. White, Dr. Sprecher, Geo. E. Slaughter, R.\r\nF. Franklin, E. A. Pettijohn, E. E. Thompson, Dan Swartz, R. M. McKie,\r\nWm. McCully and Proctor McCann. The committee appointed to wait on Mrs.\r\nHarrison were: Mesdames Hubbard, Button, Shepardson, Fuller, Gilbert,\r\nShibley, Hebbard, and Wright. Twelve school-girls presented as many\r\nbaskets of oranges to the lady of the White House.\r\n\r\nThe President addressed the assemblage and said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We have travelled now something more than\r\n  3,500 miles. They have been 3,500 miles of cordial greeting from my\r\n  fellow-citizens; they have been 3,500 miles of perpetual talk. It\r\n  would require a brain more fertile in resources, more diversified\r\n  in its operations than the State of California in its richness and\r\n  productions, to say something original or interesting at each one of\r\n  these stopping places; but I can say always with a warm heart to my\r\n  fellow-citizens who greet me so cordially, who look to me out of such\r\n  kindly faces, I thank you; I am your servant in all things that will\r\n  conduce to the general prosperity and happiness of the American people.\r\n\r\n  Remote from us of the far East in distance, we are united to you\r\n  not only by the ties of a common citizenship, by the reverence and\r\n  honor we joyfully give to the one flag, but by those interchanges\r\n  of emigration which have brought so many of the people of the older\r\n  States to you. At every station where I have stopped since entering\r\n  California some Hoosier has reached up his hand to greet me [laughter\r\n  and cheers], and the omnipresent Ohio man, of course, I have found\r\n  everywhere. I was assured by these gentlemen that they were making\r\n  their full contributions to the development of your country, and that\r\n  they have possessed themselves of their fair share of it.\r\n\r\n  I have been greatly pleased this morning to come out of the land of\r\n  the desert and the drifting sand into this land of homes and smiling\r\n  women and bright children. I have been glad to see these beautiful\r\n  gardens and these fertile fields, and to know that you are now, by\r\n  the economical collection and distribution of the waters of the\r\n  hills, making all these valleys to blossom like the garden of Eden.\r\n  We do not come to spy the land with any view of dispossessing you, as\r\n  the original spies went into Palestine. We come simply to exchange\r\n  friendly greetings, and we shall hope to carry away nothing that does\r\n  not belong to us. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  If we shall leave your happy and prosperous State freighted with\r\n  your good-will and love, as we shall leave ours with you, it will be a\r\n  happy exchange. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONTARIO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Ontario the President received a most patriotic greeting; throngs of\r\nschool children brought him flowers. The Reception Committee was G. T.\r\nStamm, I. S. Miller, E. P. Clarke, S. G. Blood, R. E. Blackburn, G. W.\r\nA. Luckey, Dr. O. S. Ensign, Dr. R. H. Tremper, and O. S. Picher.\r\n\r\nH. Z. Osborne, of the Los Angeles committee, introduced the President,\r\nwho spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I thank you for this cordial greeting. I am sure you\r\n  will excuse me from extended remarks. I have been subjected to such\r\n  a strain in that direction that my brain needs irrigation to make it\r\n  blossom with new thoughts. It to me is a pleasure to look into the\r\n  intelligent faces of American citizens. No such people gather in any\r\n  other country as meet me at every station. They come from good homes,\r\n  which are the safety of our commonwealth. I am pleased to see these\r\n  children here. Good schools have everywhere followed the pioneer. You\r\n  have brought to this new country the old New England ideas of thrift,\r\n  of living on a little and having a good deal left over. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANNING, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nBanning, the gateway to Southern California, gave the presidential\r\nparty an enthusiastic welcome and loaded them down with fruits and\r\nflowers. Mr. Louis Munson, editor of the Banning _Herald_, at the head\r\nof the Reception Committee, delivered the welcoming address. The next\r\nday at Arlington, where he had gone to again assist in receiving the\r\nPresident, Mr. Munson was suddenly taken with hemorrhage and died as the\r\ntrain passed. Other members of the committee were M. G. Kelley, W. S.\r\nHathaway, C. H. Ingelow, W. H. Ingelow, Dr. J. C. King, F. J. Clancy, W.\r\nMorris, and M. L. Bridge. Two hundred Indian school children, in charge\r\nof Miss Morris and Father Hahn, were objects of interest to the party.\r\n\r\nReplying to Mr. Munson's address, the President said that although the\r\ngood people of Banning were far in point of distance from the seat of\r\ngovernment, yet he was sure they were bound nearly and close to it by\r\nties of loyalty and of patriotism. He expressed his pleasure at meeting\r\nthe citizens of Banning and his appreciation of their cordial welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMONA, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Pomona the President's car was profusely decorated with floral\r\ndesigns by the ladies of the town. The members of the Reception\r\nCommittee were Senator J. E. McComas, Rev. Chas. F. Loop, W. E. Ward,\r\nW. M. Woody, A. H. Wilbur, F. P. Firey, C. I. Lorbeer, Capt. T. C.\r\nThomas, Geo. Osgoodby, C. D. Ambrose, Con Howe, John E. Packard, and E.\r\nB. Smith. Vicksburg Post, G. A. R., H. H. Williams, Commander, was in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nResponding to their cheers and calls the President said:\r\n\r\n  This cordial demonstration of respect, these friendly greetings,\r\n  make me your debtor. I beg to thank you for it all, and out of such\r\n  gatherings as these, out of the friendly manifestations you have\r\n  given me on my entrance to California, I hope to get new impulses to\r\n  a more faithful and diligent discharge of the public duties which\r\n  my fellow-citizens have devolved upon me. No man can feel himself\r\n  adequate to these responsible functions, but I am sure if you shall\r\n  judge your public servants to be conscientiously devoted to your\r\n  interests, to the bringing to the discharge of their public duties a\r\n  conscientious fidelity and the best intelligence with which they are\r\n  endowed, you will pardon any shortcoming. Again I thank you for your\r\n  friendliness and beg you to excuse me from further speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous city of Los Angeles was reached at 3 o'clock on the afternoon\r\nof the 22d. An ovation awaited the President and his party here the like\r\nof which they had not witnessed. They were met at Colton by a committee\r\nof escort consisting of Mayor Henry T. Hazard and Mrs. Hazard, Mr. and\r\nMrs. E. F. Spence, H. W. Hellman, Gen. and Miss Mathews, W. C. Furrey\r\nand wife, Judge and Mrs. S. O. Houghton, A. W. Francisco and wife, Col.\r\nH. G. Otis and wife, J. A. Kelly and wife, H. Z. Osborne and wife,\r\nCapt. George J. Ainsworth, Mrs. Hervey Lindley, E. H. Lamme, and L.\r\nN. Breed. Fully 20,000 voices greeted the President's arrival at the\r\nstation, where the members of the Citizens' Reception Committee, of\r\nwhich Mayor Hazard was Chairman, received him. This committee comprised\r\nthe leading men of the city, among whom were Hon. R. F. Del Valle, Gen.\r\nJohn Mansfield, Gen. E. P. Johnson, Gen. A. McD. McCook, Gen. E. E.\r\nHewitt, Maj. Geo. E.

M.\r\nWagner, and F. E. Lopez.\r\n\r\nAs the President passed through the crowded streets of the city,\r\nescorted by several hundred G. A. R. veterans, he encountered a\r\nveritable rain of flowers at the hands of several thousand school\r\nchildren. Arriving at the grand stand Mayor Hazard, for the Reception\r\nCommittee, formally welcomed the President, who responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--My stay among you will not be long\r\n  enough to form an individual judgment of the quality of your people,\r\n  but it has been long enough already to get a large idea of the number\r\n  of them. [Cheers.] I beg of you to accept my sincere thanks for this\r\n  magnificent demonstration of your respect. I do not at all assume\r\n  that these huzzas and streamers and banners with which you have\r\n  greeted me to-day are a tribute to me individually. I receive them as\r\n  a most assuring demonstration of the love of the people of California\r\n  for American institutions. [Great and prolonged cheering.] And well\r\n  are these institutions worthy of all honor. The flag that you have\r\n  displayed here to-day, the one flag, the banner of the free and the\r\n  symbol of the indissoluble union of the States, is worthy of the\r\n  affections of our people. Men have died for it on the field of battle;\r\n  women have consecrated it with their tears and prayers as they placed\r\n  the standard in the hands of brave men on the morning of battle. It\r\n  is historically full of tender interest and pride. It has a glorious\r\n  story on the sea in those times when the American navy maintained our\r\n  prestige and successfully beat the navies of our great antagonist.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It has a proud record from the time of our great struggle for\r\n  independence down to the last sad conflict between our own citizens.\r\n  We bless God to-day that these brave men who, working out His purpose\r\n  on the field of battle, made it again the symbol of a united people.\r\n  [Cheers.] Our institutions, of which this flag is an emblem, are free\r\n  institutions. These men and women into whose faces I look are free\r\n  men and women. I do not honor you by my presence here to-day. I hold\r\n  my trust from you and you honor me in this reception. [Great cheers.]\r\n  This magnificent domain on the Pacific coast, seized for the Union\r\n  by the energy and courage and wise forethought of Frémont and his\r\n  associates, is essential to our perfection. Nothing more important in\r\n  territorial extension, unless it be the purchase of the territory of\r\n  Louisiana and the control of the Mississippi River, has ever occurred\r\n  in our national history. [Great cheering.] We touch two oceans, and\r\n  on both we have built commonwealths and great cities, thus securing\r\n  in that territory individuality and association which give us an\r\n  assurance of perpetual peace. [Cheers.] No great conflict of arms\r\n  can ever take place on American soil if we are true to ourselves and\r\n  have forever determined that no civil conflict shall again rend our\r\n  country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We are a peace-loving Nation, and yet we cannot be sure that\r\n  everybody else will be peaceful, and therefore I am glad that by\r\n  the general consent of our people and by the liberal appropriations\r\n  from Congress we are putting on the sea some of the best vessels of\r\n  their class afloat [cheers], and that we are now prepared to put\r\n  upon their decks as good guns as are made in the world; and when we\r\n  have completed our programme, ship by ship, we will put in their\r\n  forecastles as brave Jack Tars as serve under any flag. [Great\r\n  cheering.] The provident care of our Government should be given to\r\n  your sea-coast defences until all these great ports of the Atlantic\r\n  and Pacific are made safe. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  But, my countrymen, this audience overmatches a voice that has been\r\n  in exercise from Roanoke, Va., to Los Angeles. I beg you, therefore,\r\n  again to receive my most hearty thanks and excuse me from further\r\n  speech. [Great and prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\nIn the evening the President was escorted to the pavilion, with a view\r\nto receiving personally the citizens, but when he viewed the great\r\nassemblage he desisted from the herculean task of taking each one by the\r\nhand, and instead thereof made the following address:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--I thank you for the warm greeting that you\r\n  have given me and the royal welcome you have extended to my party and\r\n  myself to your lovely city. I am thoroughly aware of the non-partisan\r\n  character of this gathering, and appreciate the good-will with which\r\n  you have gathered here in this vast building to receive me. I had a\r\n  touching evidence of the non-partisan character of this gathering--and\r\n  the good-will as well--just now when a man said to me: \"I want to\r\n  shake hands with you, even if I did lose a thousand dollars on your\r\n  election.\" There will be no trouble to keep the flame of patriotism\r\n  and love of country glowing so long as the American people thus\r\n  manifest their loyalty to the officers whom the will of the people\r\n  has placed in power. I thank you again for your good-will and hearty\r\n  welcome. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party reached San Diego Wednesday evening and was\r\nescorted at once to Coronado Beach Hotel. The Indiana residents of the\r\ncity called upon the President shortly after his arrival, and Mr. Wright\r\ndelivered an address in their behalf.\r\n\r\nThe President, in response, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I regret that I can only say thank you. Our time is\r\n  now due to the citizens of San Diego, and I have promised not to\r\n  detain that committee. It is particularly pleasurable to me to see,\r\n  as I have done at almost every station where our train stopped, some\r\n  Indianian, who stretched up the hand of old neighborship to greet\r\n  me as I passed along. It is this intermingling of our people which\r\n  sustains the merit of the home. The Yankee intermingles with the\r\n  Illinoisian, the Hoosier with the Sucker, and the people of the South\r\n  with them all; and it is this commingling which gives that unity which\r\n  marks the American Nation. I am glad to know that there are so many of\r\n  you here, and as I said to some Hoosiers as I came along, I hope you\r\n  have secured your share of these blessings.\r\n\r\nThe formal reception of the President took place Thursday morning, when\r\nhe was welcomed by Mayor Douglas Gunn, at the head of the following\r\nCommittee of Reception: Hon. John D. Works, Hon. Eli H. Murray, Hon.\r\nW. W. Bowers, Howard M. Kutchin, Hon. Olin Wellborn, E. S. Babcock,\r\nCol. W. G. Dickinson, Col. Chalmers Scott, Hon. G. W. Hardacre, W.

Mayor Gunn delivered the\r\naddress of welcome.\r\n\r\nThe President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I am in slavery to a railroad\r\n  schedule, and have but a few moments longer to tarry in your beautiful\r\n  city. If there were no other reward for our journey across the\r\n  continent, we have seen to-day about your magnificent harbor that\r\n  which would have repaid us for all the toil of travel. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I do not come to tell you anything about California, for I have\r\n  perceived in my intercourse with Californians in the East and during\r\n  this brief stay among you that already you know all about California.\r\n  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  You are, indeed, most happily situated. Every element that makes\r\n  life comfortable is here; every possibility that makes life successful\r\n  and prosperous is here; and I am sure, as I look into those kindly,\r\n  upturned faces, that your homes have as healthful a moral atmosphere\r\n  as the natural one that God has spread over your smiling land.\r\n\r\n  It is with regret that we now part from you. The welcome you\r\n  have extended to us is magnificent, kindly, and tasteful. We shall\r\n  carry away the most pleasant impression, and shall wish for you all\r\n  that you anticipate in your largest dreams for your beautiful city\r\n  [cheers]--that your harbor may be full of foreign and coast-wise\r\n  traffic, that it may not be long until the passage of our naval and\r\n  merchant marine shall not be by the Horn, but by Nicaragua. [Cheers.]\r\n  I believe that great enterprise, which is to bring your commerce into\r\n  nearer and cheaper contact with the Atlantic seaboard cities, both of\r\n  this continent and of South America, will not be long delayed.\r\n\r\n  And now, again with most grateful thanks for your friendly\r\n  attention, in my own behalf and in behalf of all who journey with me I\r\n  bid you a most kindly farewell. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the President's address Governor Torres, of Lower\r\nCalifornia, in the uniform of a Major-General of the Mexican army,\r\napproached the President and read the following telegram from Gen.\r\nPorfirio Diaz, President of Mexico:\r\n\r\n  It has come to my knowledge that the President of the United States,\r\n  Hon. Benjamin Harrison, shall visit San Diego on the 23d instant, and\r\n  I let you know it so that you may call to congratulate him in my name\r\n  and present him with my compliments.\r\n\r\n                                [Signed]              PORFIRIO DIAZ.\r\n\r\nResponding to this friendly international salute, President Harrison\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Torres_--This message from that progressive and\r\n  intelligent gentleman who presides over the destinies of our sister\r\n  republic is most grateful to me. I assure you that all our people,\r\n  that the Government, through all its instituted authorities,\r\n  entertain for President Diaz and for the chivalrous people over which\r\n  he presides the most friendly sentiments of respect. [Cheers and\r\n  applause.] We covet, sir, your good-will and those mutual exchanges\r\n  which are mutually profitable, and we hope that the two republics may\r\n  forever dwell in fraternal peace.\r\n\r\nAs the President sat down Governor Torres remarked: \"The Mexican people\r\nrespond heartily to your kind wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA ANA, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the return route from San Diego the presidential train stopped at\r\nSanta Ana, a thriving town in Orange County, where 5,000 people had\r\nassembled to greet the Chief Magistrate. The Committee of Reception was\r\nJohn T. Nourse, C. S. McKelvey, W. S. Taylor, J. A. Crane, John Beatty,\r\nGeo. E. Edgar, Geo. T. Insley, Capt. H. T. Matthews, W. H. Drips, and\r\nRobert Cummings. Sedgwick Post, G. A. R., H. F. Stone, Commander, was\r\npresent. Prof. M. Manley delivered the address of welcome, and the Hon.\r\nW. H. Spurgeon, founder of the city, introduced the President, who spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have already proved your hospitality. It is\r\n  very, very generous, and it is very graceful. I have but one doubt in\r\n  regard to it, and that is whether I can stand so much of it. [Laughter\r\n  and applause.] It has given me great gladness of heart to look into\r\n  your faces. I have been discharging some public business far remote\r\n  from you, and I hope with some concern for your interest, for I have\r\n  tried to take a wide view of public questions and to have in my mind a\r\n  thought of the people of this great land.\r\n\r\n  Our politics should be as broad as the territory over which our\r\n  people have spread. It is a part of the history of the country which\r\n  has always kept in memory the safety and interests of those who pushed\r\n  civilization to the Rocky Mountains and over its rugged peaks into\r\n  these fruitful valleys. I am glad to see here this afternoon these\r\n  little children. The order in which they have assembled gives me\r\n  assurance that they have come from the school-houses, those nurseries\r\n  of knowledge and common interests in our American States.\r\n\r\n  I am glad that you grow not only the olive-tree in your garden, but\r\n  that to the olive-trees that are planted in the household and bloom\r\n  about your table you give your greatest attention. Now, thanking you\r\n  very kindly and confessing very humbly that I am not able to repay you\r\n  for your generous welcome, and leaving to all these little ones my\r\n  best hopes for useful, prosperous, and honorable lives, I bid you all\r\n  good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the zealous efforts of Mrs. T. I. Halsted, President of the\r\nWoman's Relief Corps of Orange, Mrs. Emilie N. Tener, and others, the\r\npresidential train stopped at that town. The Committee of Reception was:\r\nRev. A. Parker, Robert E. Tener, E. E. Risley, Wm. H. Arne, Mrs. E. B.\r\nStrong, H. W. Wilson, and D. C. Pixley. Gordon Granger Post, G. A. R.,\r\nA. Meacham, Commander, was present in full force.\r\n\r\nResponding to enthusiastic cheers the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am glad to look into your smiling faces, and I\r\n  thank you for this welcome. California is a State that is favorably\r\n  situated, and, so far as I can judge, this section is among the most\r\n  favored in the State. There is no time for a speech, but we can shake\r\n  hands with a few of those who are nearest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most enjoyable visits of the President and his party was\r\nto Riverside, San Bernardino County, where, on driving from Arlington\r\nstation, they were welcomed by several thousand residents of the\r\ndistrict. The Committee of Reception comprised Hon. H. M. Streeter,\r\nJudge W. W. Noland, Judge Harvey Potter, C. O. Perrine, Capt. C. H.\r\nVosburg, C. M. Loring, A. P. Johnson, F. M. Dunbar, A. Keith, C. T.\r\nRice, Capt. J. T. Lawler, A. H. Naftzger, E. W. Holmes, F. McChoppin,\r\nFrank A. Miller, G. W. Dickson, J. A. Wilbur, F. M. Heath, C. N.\r\nAndrews, J. R. Newberry, F. E. Abbott, W. C. Fitzsimmons, D. W. McLeod,\r\nB. R. Williams, C. P. Hayt, and Mrs. S. A. Ames, representing the city\r\nof Riverside; Mrs. C. W. Sylvester, representing the Woman's Relief\r\nCorps; Mrs. C. Button, representing the W. C. T. U., and Mrs. Davis.\r\n\r\nThe President and Mrs. Harrison and all the other members of the party\r\nwere treated to a delightful drive through the celebrated orange groves.\r\nThe President was accompanied by Hon. S. C. Evans. Returning from the\r\ngroves the President's carriage was halted in front of the High School\r\nbuilding, where 1,400 scholars and several thousand others had assembled.\r\n\r\nOn being presented by Mr. Evans the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--We can tarry only for a moment, as we are already\r\n  behind the regular time for leaving. I cannot, however, drive by this\r\n  large assemblage of friends, gathered to greet us on the way, without\r\n  expressing the delight with which I have looked upon these beautiful\r\n  surroundings. My trip from Washington has been full of pleasures and\r\n  surprises, but nothing has given me greater surprise and more pleasure\r\n  than the drive of this afternoon through this magnificent valley of\r\n  Riverside. I am glad you are interested in cultivating the children as\r\n  well as the orange, and I trust that their young minds may be kept as\r\n  free from all that is injurious as these fine orange orchards are of\r\n  weeds and everything that is noxious. May their lives be as fruitful\r\n  as your trees, and their homes as happy and full of joy as this land\r\n  seems to be of the bright sunshine of God.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished visitors then proceeded through the city and reviewed\r\nthe parade, at the conclusion of which the President, speaking without\r\nintroduction, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am sorry that we can tarry with you only for a\r\n  moment. We are now twenty minutes behind our schedule time for\r\n  leaving. If we should stay with you longer we should disappoint others\r\n  who are waiting for us at an appointed time.\r\n\r\n  We are grateful to you for your presence. I have enjoyed very much\r\n  the ride through the valley. You are a favored people, and ought to\r\n  be, as I have no doubt you are, a law-abiding, liberty-loving, and\r\n  patriotic people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother typical gathering, full of California enthusiasm, greeted\r\nthe party at San Bernardino. The Reception Committee comprised C. C.\r\nHaskell, Chairman; J. C. Lynch, Hon. Samuel Merrill, W. A. Harris,\r\nJoseph Brown, J. N. Victor, L. C. Waite, Richard Gird, W. E. W.\r\nLightfoot, W. B. Beamer, R. J. Waters, Truman Reeves, Dr. A. Thompson,\r\nCol. T. J. Wilson, D. A. Scott, A. S. Hawley, J. J. Hewitt, E. B.\r\nStanton, A. G. Kendall, Dr. J. P. Booth, W. H. Timmons, Wilson Hays,\r\nGeo. Cooley, R. B. Taylor, H. A. Keller, E. E. Katz, Lewis Jacobs, H. L.\r\nDrew, N. G. Gill, and I. W. Lord. Mr. W. J. Curtis delivered the address\r\nof welcome. In response the President said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow citizens_--I can only repeat to you what I\r\n  have already had occasion to say to many similar audiences assembled\r\n  in California, that I am delighted with my visit to the Pacific coast;\r\n  that much as I had heard of the richness and high cultivation,\r\n  what I have seen to-day in this great valley has far surpassed my\r\n  expectations. You have subdued an unpromising soil and made it blossom\r\n  as the rose; but better than all the fruits and harvests, and better\r\n  than all the products of the field, is this intelligent population\r\n  which out of their kindly faces extend to us a greeting wherever we go.\r\n\r\n  I am glad, coming from the far East, to observe how greatly our\r\n  people are alike. But that is not surprising, because I find all\r\n  through this valley many Hoosiers and Buckeyes I knew at home. It is\r\n  not singular that you should be alike when you are really and truly\r\n  the same people, not only in lineage and general characteristics, but\r\n  the same men and women we have known in the older States. And now I\r\n  thank you again, and beg you will excuse me from further speech, with\r\n  the assurance that if it were in my power I would double the rich\r\n  blessings which you already enjoy. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASADENA, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was 8 o'clock in the evening when the presidential train rolled into\r\nPasadena, the home of Governor Markham.

McGowan, G. A. Gibbs, F. K. Burnham,\r\nand C. E. Brooks.\r\n\r\nThe women's Reception Committee to receive Mrs. Harrison and the other\r\nladies in the party consisted of: Mrs. L. A. Sheldon, Mrs. J. A.\r\nBuchanan, Mrs. J. W. Wood, Mrs. C. D. Daggett, Mrs. J. R. Bowler, Mrs.\r\nJames Clarke, Miss Greenleaf, Mrs. W. E. Arthur, and Mrs. W. U. Masters.\r\n\r\nIt was 11 o'clock at night when the President and the gentlemen of his\r\nparty attended an elegant banquet at the Hotel Green, over which the\r\nHon. W. U. Masters presided. Mr. Buchanan proposed the President's\r\nhealth in words of welcome.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I beg you to accept my thanks for this banquet spread\r\n  in honor of this community of strangers who have dropped in upon you\r\n  to-night. We come to you after dark. I am not, therefore, prepared to\r\n  speak of Pasadena. When the sun shall have lightened your landscape\r\n  again and our expectant eyes shall have rested upon its glories,\r\n  I shall be able to give you my impressions of your city, which I\r\n  am already prepared to believe is one of the gems in the crown of\r\n  California. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Perhaps no other place in California has by name been more familiar\r\n  to me than Pasadena, if you except your great commercial city of San\r\n  Francisco. That comes from the fact that many of your early settlers\r\n  were Indiana friends. I am glad to meet some of these friends here\r\n  to-night. It is pleasant to renew these old acquaintances, to find\r\n  that they have been received with esteem in this new community. I\r\n  have found a line of Hoosiers all along these railroads we have been\r\n  traversing.\r\n\r\n  Everywhere our train has stopped some Hoosier has lifted his hand to\r\n  me, and often by dozens. As I said the other day, Ohio men identify\r\n  themselves to me by reason of that State being my birthplace, but it\r\n  is not a surprise to me to find an Ohio man anywhere. [Laughter.] Ohio\r\n  people are especially apt to be found in the vicinity of a public\r\n  office. [Laughter.] I suppose whatever good fortune has come to me in\r\n  the way of political preferment must be traced to the fact that I am\r\n  a Buckeye by birth. [Laughter.] And now I thank you most cordially\r\n  again for your attention and kindness. California has been full of the\r\n  most affectionate interest to us. I have never looked into the faces\r\n  of a more happy and intelligent people than those I have seen on the\r\n  Pacific coast. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  You occupy the most important position in the sisterhood of States,\r\n  stretching for these several hundred miles along the Pacific shore.\r\n  You have fortunate birth, and your history has been a succession of\r\n  fortunate surprises. You have wrought out here great achievements in\r\n  converting these plains that seemed to be so unpromising to the eye\r\n  into such gardens as cannot be seen anywhere else upon the continent.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  And now, when I remind you that bedtime was 1 o'clock last night and\r\n  the reveille sounded at 6 o'clock this morning on our car, I am sure\r\n  you will permit me to say good-night. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FERNANDO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop on Friday was at San Fernando, the home of Dr. J. K.\r\nHawks, who for twenty years was General Harrison's near neighbor. The\r\nCommittee of Reception was: R. P. Waite, S. Maclay, J. Burr, J. S.\r\nKerns, C. Smith, Colonel Hubbard, Mesdames Bodkin, Hubbard, Smith, and\r\nMisses Platt, Gower, and Jennie Hawks.\r\n\r\nDr. Hawks made a brief address of welcome and introduced the President,\r\nwho said:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--I am pleased to be introduced to you by my\r\n  old and honored friend, and I do sincerely hope that he has won your\r\n  respect to the same extent which I learned to respect him when he was\r\n  my neighbor. I hope you will excuse me from speaking further. I thank\r\n  you all for your friendly greeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA PAULA, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thriving town of Santa Paula, Ventura County, gave the President\r\nand his party a hearty reception, distinguished above others by a truly\r\nmammoth floral piece 24 feet long by 6 feet in width, covered with\r\ncalla-lilies, and bearing the word \"Welcome\" in red geranium letters\r\n40 inches in height. The Committee of Reception was: W. L. Hardison,\r\nChairman; Casper Taylor, Rev. F. D. Mather, C. J. McDevitt, F. A.\r\nMorgan, F. E. Davis, J. B. Titus, C. H. McKevett, N. W. Blanchard, Dr.\r\nD. W. Mott, C. N. Baker, A. Wooleven, Harry Youngken, and S. C. Graham.\r\nThe Major Eddy Post, G. A. R., Henry Proctor, Commander, was present.\r\n\r\nMaj. Joseph R. Haugh, an old Indianapolis acquaintance, welcomed the\r\nPresident on behalf of the committee. President Harrison, replying, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I cannot feel myself a stranger in this State, so\r\n  distant from home, when I am greeted by some familiar faces from my\r\n  Indiana home at almost every station. Your fellow-citizen who has\r\n  spoken in your behalf was an old-time Indianapolis friend. I hope he\r\n  is held in the same esteem in which he was held by the people among\r\n  whom he spent his early years as a boy and man. [Cries of \"He is!\"]\r\n  That you should have gone to the pains to make such magnificent\r\n  decorations and to come out in such large numbers for this momentary\r\n  greeting very deeply touches my heart.\r\n\r\n  I have never seen in any State of the Union what seems to me to\r\n  be a more happy and contented people than I have seen this morning.\r\n  Your soil and sun are genial, healthful, and productive, and I have\r\n  no doubt that these genial and kindly influences are manifested in\r\n  the homes that are represented here, and that there is sunshine in\r\n  the household as well as in the fields; that there is contentment\r\n  and love and sweetness in these homes as well as in these gardens\r\n  that are so adorned with flowers. Our pathway has been strewn with\r\n  flowers; we have literally driven for miles over flowers that in\r\n  the East would have been priceless, and these favors have all been\r\n  accompanied with manifestations of friendliness for which I am very\r\n  grateful, and everywhere there has been set up as having greater\r\n  glory than sunshine, greater glory than flowers, this flag of our\r\n  country. [Applause.] Everywhere I have been greeted by some of these\r\n  comrades, veterans of the late war, whose presence among you should\r\n  be the inspiration to increased patriotism and loyalty. I bid them\r\n  affectionate greeting, and am sorry that I cannot tarry with them\r\n  longer. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN BUENAVENTURA, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree thousand people welcomed the party at San Buenaventura, including\r\nnearly 1,000 school-children, who bounteously provided the President\r\nand Mrs. Harrison with flowers. The Reception Committee consisted of:\r\nMayor J. S. Collins, J. R. Willoughby, E. M. Jones, P. Bennett, C. D.\r\nBonestel, N. H. Shaw, and Cushing Post, G. A. R., D. M. Rodibaugh,\r\nCommander.\r\n\r\nGen. William Vandever welcomed the party, and the President spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very glad to meet my old friend and your former\r\n  representative, General Vandever. I have had some surprise at almost\r\n  every station at which we have stopped. I did not know until he came\r\n  upon the platform that this was his home. I have not time to make a\r\n  speech, and I have not the voice to make one. I can only say of these\r\n  hearty and friendly Californians that my heart is deeply touched with\r\n  this evidence of friendly regard. You have strewn my way with flowers;\r\n  you have graced every occasion, even the briefest stop, with a most\r\n  friendly greeting, and I assure you that we are most grateful for it\r\n  all. You are fortunate in your location among the States; and I am\r\n  sure that in all this great republic nowhere is there a more loyal and\r\n  patriotic people than we have here on the Pacific coast. I thank you\r\n  again for this greeting. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reception at Santa Barbara was the most unique that the presidential\r\nparty experienced on their trip, and also one of the most enjoyable; it\r\nwas a veritable flower carnival.\r\n\r\nLeading the procession was a Spanish cavalcade commanded by Carlos de la\r\nGuerra. The President's escort was a cavalcade of children marshalled\r\nby Mrs. Schermerhorn, with flower-decked saddles and bridles; then\r\nfollowed over 100 flower-trimmed equipages, each displaying a different\r\ndesign and flower and bespeaking the marvellous flora of Santa Barbara\r\nin the month of April. The stand from whence the President reviewed\r\nthe procession and witnessed the Battle of Flowers was a floral\r\ntriumph; 20,000 calla-lilies were used in its decoration and as many\r\nbright-colored flowers. The battle scene occurred on the grand stand,\r\nimmediately opposite the reviewing stand, between several hundred\r\nladies and gentlemen. The whole was a spectacle to be witnessed but\r\nonce in a lifetime. The parade was under the direction of Grand Marshal\r\nD. W. Thompson, assisted by special aids George Culbertson, Dr. H.\r\nL. Stambach, T. R. Moore, Samuel Stanwood, Paschal Hocker, and C. A.\r\nFernald. The Committee of Reception comprised Mayor P. J. Barber, C. F.\r\nEaton, W. W. Burton, W. C. Clerk, I. G. Waterman, D. Baxter, E. P. Roe,\r\nJr., C. E. Bigelow, Alston Hayne, Frank Stoddard, L. P. Lincoln, W. N.\r\nHawley, J. W. Calkins, Geo. A. Edwards, C. C. Hunt, Edward M. Hoit, Hon.\r\nE. H. Heacock, Dr. J. M. McNulta, W. B. Cope, C. F. Swan, W. M. Eddy, J.\r\nC. Wilson, R. B. Canfield; also, Joseph Sexton, of Goleta; E. J. Knapp,\r\nof Carpinteria; T. R. Bard, of Hueneme; R. E. Jack and E. W. Steele,\r\nof San Luis Obispo; H. H. Poland, of Lompoc, and Dr. W. T. Lucas and\r\nThomas Boyd, of Santa Maria. Starr King Post, G. A. R., C. A. Storke,\r\nCommander, participated in the reception.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the parade the entire party, including the ladies,\r\nvisited the ancient Mission of Santa Barbara and were taken within its\r\nsacred precincts, it being the second occasion on which any woman was\r\nadmitted. At night they witnessed a Spanish dance, conducted by many\r\nladies and gentlemen, under the direction of F. M. Whitney, Mrs. Bell,\r\nand Mrs. Dibblee. The eventful day closed with a public reception,\r\nparticipated in by 15,000 people.\r\n\r\nGen. Wm. Vandever delivered an address of welcome, to which the\r\nPresident, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _General Vandever, Gentlemen of the Committee and Friends_--If I\r\n  have been in any doubt as to the fact of the perfect identity of\r\n  your people with the American Nation, that doubt has been displaced\r\n  by one incident which has been prominent in all this trip, and that\r\n  is that the great and predominant and all-pervading American habit\r\n  of demanding a speech on every occasion has been characteristically\r\n  prominent in California. [Laughter.] I am more than delighted by this\r\n  visit to your city. It has been made brilliant with the display of\r\n  banners and flowers--one the emblem of our national greatness and\r\n  prowess, the other the adornment which God has given to beautify\r\n  nature. With all this I am sure I have read in the faces of the men,\r\n  women and children who have greeted me that these things--these\r\n  flowers of the field and this flag, representing organized\r\n  government--typify what is to be found in the homes of California.\r\n  The expression of your welcome to-day has been unique and tasteful\r\n  beyond description. I have not the words to express the high sense\r\n  of appreciation and the amazement that filled the minds of all our\r\n  party as we looked upon this display which you have improvised for our\r\n  reception. No element of beauty, no element of taste, no element of\r\n  gracious kindness has been lacking in it, and for that we tender you\r\n  all our most hearty thanks. We shall keep this visit a bright spot in\r\n  our memories. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop of the presidential train on Friday, April 25, was at\r\nBakersfield, the gateway of the famous San Joaquin Valley, which was\r\nreached at 8:30 in the morning. Fifteen hundred residents greeted the\r\nPresident, who was met by W. E. Houghton, W. H. Scribner, W. Canfield,\r\nand C. E. Sherman, constituting a special Committee of Reception. The\r\ngeneral committee for the occasion comprised the following prominent\r\ncitizens: N. R. Packard, E. M. Roberts, John J. Morrison, Emil\r\nDinkelspiel, H. L. Borgwardt, Jr., J. Neideraur, P. Galtes, O. D. Fish,\r\nH. A. Jastro, Geo. K. Ober, Dr. Helm, J. J. Mack, E. A. Pueschel, S.\r\nN. Reed, H. A. Blodget, C. A. Maul, Chas. E. Jewett, A. Harrell, G. W.\r\nWear, Wm.

Weill, H.\r\nC. Lechner, S. W. Wible, Dr. John Snook, L. McKelvy, A. Morgan, E. C.\r\nPalmes, John S. Drury, W. A. Howell, A. C. Maude, Chas. Vandever, Alonzo\r\nCoons, T. A. Metcalf, R. M. Walker, Richard Hudnut, Sol. Jewett, J. C.\r\nSmith, S. A. Burnap, H. H. Fish, S. W. Fergusson, J. W. Mahon, A. Fay,\r\nChas. Bickirdike, H. F. Condict, H. C. Park, and I. L. Miller.\r\n\r\nA large number of beautiful bouquets were showered upon the party here.\r\nJudge A. R. Conklin made the welcoming address. President Harrison spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very much obliged to you for your friendly\r\n  greeting and for these bouquets. You must excuse me if I seem a little\r\n  shy of the bouquets. I received one in my eye the other day which gave\r\n  me a good deal of trouble. You are very kind to meet us here so early\r\n  in the morning with this cordial demonstration. It has been a very\r\n  long journey, and has been accompanied with some fatigue of travel,\r\n  but we feel this morning, in this exhilarating air and this sweet\r\n  sunshine, and refreshed with your kind greeting, as bright and more\r\n  happy than when we left the national capital.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to feel that here, on the western edge of the continent,\r\n  in this Pacific State, there is that same enthusiastic love for the\r\n  flag, that same veneration and respect for American institutions, for\r\n  the one Union and the one Constitution, that is found in the heart\r\n  of the country. We are one people absolutely. We follow not men, but\r\n  institutions. We are happy in the fact that though men may live or\r\n  die, come or go, we still have that toward which the American citizen\r\n  turns with confidence and veneration--this great Union of the States\r\n  devised so happily by our fathers. General Garfield, when Mr. Lincoln\r\n  was stricken down by the foul hand of an assassin, and when that great\r\n  wave of dismay and grief swept over the land, standing in a busy\r\n  thoroughfare of New York, could say: \"The Government at Washington\r\n  still lives.\" It is dependent upon no man. It is lodged safely in the\r\n  affections of the people, and having its impregnable defence and its\r\n  assured perpetuity in their love and veneration for law. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTULARE, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nTulare was reached at 10 o'clock. Nearly 6,000 people awaited the\r\nPresident's arrival. Capt. Thomas H. Thompson, E. W. Holland, and Hon.\r\nO. B. Taylor met the distinguished travellers. The other members of the\r\ncommittee were: Hon. John. G. Eckles, Hon. J. O. Lovejoy, I. N. Wright,\r\nJ. Wolfrom, E. T. Cosper, Hon. J. W. Davis, Sam Richardson, Dr. C. F.\r\nTaggart, M. W. Cooley, H. H. Francisco, C. C. Brock, James Scoon, D. O.\r\nHamman, J. L. Bachelder, R. B. Bohannan, James Morton, A. O. Erwin, J.\r\nB. Zumwalt, Hon. E. De Witt, Alfred Fay, J. H. Whited, J. A. Goble, W.\r\nL. Blythe, M. M. Burnett, Scott Bowles, R. L. Reid, F. M. Shultz, B. F.\r\nMoore, F.

John Roth,\r\nA. Borders, T. W. Maples, E. D. Lake, S. S. Ingham, D. W. Madden, Sam\r\nNewell, M. C. Hamlin, W. C. Ambrose, H. C. Faber, C. Talbot, L. E.\r\nSchoenemann, M. C. Hunt, G. W. Zartman, A. P. Hall, J. H. Woody, Isaac\r\nRoberts, Capt. E. Oakford, J. C. Gist, H. F. Tandy, C. F. Stone, and Dr.\r\nB. M. Alford.\r\n\r\nThe committee escorted the presidential party to a unique platform\r\nconstructed inside the stump of a gigantic redwood tree, and there was\r\nample seating capacity upon the platform for the entire party; about the\r\nbase of the great stump were arranged boxes of elegant flowers. Mrs.\r\nHarrison and the other ladies in the party were escorted to the stand by\r\nMrs. E. B. Oakford, Mrs. T. H. Thompson, Mrs. G. J. Reading, and Mrs.\r\nPatrick, of Visalia. Gettysburg Post, G. A. R., and Company E, from\r\nVisalia, were a guard of honor to the Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nGovernor Markham introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--This seems to be a very happy and smiling audience,\r\n  and I am sure that the gladness which is in your hearts and in\r\n  your faces does not depend at all upon the presence of this little\r\n  company of strangers who tarry with you for a moment. It is born of\r\n  influences and conditions that are permanent. It comes of the happy\r\n  sunshine and sweet air that are over your fields, and still more\r\n  from the contentment, prosperity, and love and peace that are in\r\n  your households. California has been spoken of as a wonderland, and\r\n  everywhere we have gone something new, interesting, and surprising has\r\n  been presented to our observation. There has been but one monotone in\r\n  our journey, and that is the monotone of universal welcome from all\r\n  your people. [Cheers.] Everything else has been new and exceptional at\r\n  every stop.\r\n\r\n  My own heart kindles with gladness, my own confidence in American\r\n  interests is firmer and more settled as I mingle with the great masses\r\n  of our people. You are here in a great agricultural region, reclaimed\r\n  from desert waste by the skill and energy of man--a region populated\r\n  by a substantial, industrious, thrifty, God-fearing people, a people\r\n  devoted to the institutions under which they live, proud to be\r\n  Americans, feeling that the American birthright is the best heritage\r\n  they can hand down to their children; proud of the great story of\r\n  our country from the time of independence to this day; devoted to\r\n  institutions that give the largest liberty to the individual and at\r\n  the same time secure social order. Here is the firm foundation upon\r\n  which our hopes for future security rest. What but our own neglect,\r\n  what but our own unfaithfulness, can put in peril either our national\r\n  institutions or our local organizations of government? True to\r\n  ourselves, true to those principles which we have embodied in our\r\n  Government, there is to the human eye no danger that can threaten the\r\n  firm base of our institutions.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to see and meet these happy children. I feel like kneeling\r\n  to them as the future sovereigns of this country, and feel as if\r\n  it were a profanation to tread upon these sweet flowers that they\r\n  have spread in my pathway. God bless them, every one; keep them in\r\n  the lives they are to live from all that is evil, fill their little\r\n  hearts with sunshine and their mature lives with grace and usefulness.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESNO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nA crowd of 10,000 greeted the party at Fresno; upward of 1,000 school\r\nchildren were present, led by Professors Heaton, Sturges, and Sheldon.\r\nThe Committee of Reception consisted of Mayor S. H. Cole, Dr. Chester\r\nA. Rowell, F. G. Berry, Dr. A. J. Pedlar, Dr. St. George Hopkins, W. W.\r\nPhillips, I. N. Pattison, Louis Einstein, Nathan W. Moodey, C. W. De\r\nLong, and J. C. Herrington. Altanta Post, G. A. R., Capt. Fred Banta,\r\nCommander, also Company C, National Guard, Capt. M. W. Muller, and\r\nCompany F, Capt. C. Chisholm, participated in the reception. A number\r\nof handsome floral designs and other mementoes were presented to the\r\nseveral members of the party.\r\n\r\nDr. Rowell delivered the welcoming address. President Harrison,\r\nresponding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is altogether impossible for me to reach\r\n  with my voice this vast concourse of friends. I can only say I am\r\n  profoundly grateful for this enthusiastic greeting. I receive with\r\n  great satisfaction the memento you have given me of the varied\r\n  products of this most fertile and happy valley. I shall carry it with\r\n  me to Washington as a reminder of a scene that will never fade from\r\n  my memory. It is very pleasant to know that all these pursuits that\r\n  so much engage your thoughts and so industriously employ your time\r\n  have not turned your minds away from the love of the flag and of those\r\n  institutions which spread their secure power over all your homes. What\r\n  is it that makes the scattered homes of our people secure? There is no\r\n  policeman at the door; there is no guard to accompany us as we move\r\n  across this great continent. You and I are in the safe keeping of the\r\n  law and of the affection and regard of all our people. Each respects\r\n  the rights of the other. I am glad to receive this manifestation of\r\n  your respect. I am glad to drink in this morning with this sunshine\r\n  and this sweet balmy air a new impulse to public duty, a new love\r\n  for the Union and flag. It is a matter of great regret that I can\r\n  return in such a small measure your affectionate greeting. I wish it\r\n  were possible I could greet each one of you personally, that it were\r\n  possible in some way other than in words to testify to you my grateful\r\n  sense of your good-will. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCED, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party arrived at Merced shortly after noon and was\r\nwelcomed by several thousand enthusiastic residents. The Committee of\r\nReception was composed of the following representative citizens: E. T.\r\nDixon, Maj. G. B. Cook, L. R. Fancher, C. H. Marks, E. M. Stoddard, S.\r\nA. D. Jones, Frank Howell, W. J. Quigley, M. Goldman, C. E. Fleming, J.\r\nH. Rogers, J. A. Norvell, Thomas Harris, Maj. C. Ralston, F. H. Farrar,\r\nR. N. Hughes, Judge J. K. Law, Thomas H. Leggett, and H. J. Ostrander.\r\nHancock Post, G. A. R., J. Q. Blackburn, Commander, participated in the\r\nreception. Three little girls, Dottie Norvell, Mattie Hall, and Baby\r\nIngalsbe, representing the citizens of Merced, presented Mrs. Harrison\r\nwith a beautiful souvenir in the shape of a large American flag woven\r\nfrom roses and violets.\r\n\r\nChairman Dixon made the welcoming address, and President Harrison\r\nreplied in the following words:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have scarcely been able to finish a meal\r\n  since I have been in California. [Laughter.] I find myself hardly\r\n  seated at the table till some one reminds me that in about five\r\n  minutes I am to meet another throng of cordial and friendly people.\r\n  But I think I could have subsisted on this trip through California\r\n  without anything to eat, and have dined the while upon the stimulus\r\n  and inspiration which your good-will and kindly greetings have\r\n  given me. I do not think, however, from what I have seen of these\r\n  valleys, that it will be necessary for anyone to live without eating.\r\n  [Laughter.] I have been greatly delighted with the agricultural\r\n  richness, with the surprises in natural scenery, and in the production\r\n  which have met us on this journey. Everywhere something has been\r\n  lying in ambush for us, and when I was thinking of prunes and English\r\n  walnuts and oranges we suddenly pulled up to a station where they had\r\n  a pyramid of pig tin to excite our wonder and interest at the variety\r\n  of the production in this marvellous State. But let me say, above all\r\n  those fruits and flowers, above all these productions of mine and\r\n  field, I have been most pleased with the men and women of California.\r\n  [Applause.] It gives me great pleasure, too, to meet everywhere\r\n  these little ones. I am fond of children. They attract my interest\r\n  always, and the little ones of my own household furnish about the only\r\n  relaxation and pleasure I have at Washington. [Applause.] I wish for\r\n  your children and for you, out of whose homes they come, and where\r\n  they are treasured with priceless affection and tender supervision,\r\n  all the blessings that a benign Providence and a good Government\r\n  can bestow. I shall be glad if in any way I have the opportunity to\r\n  conserve and promote your interests. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODESTO, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nModesto was reached at 2:40 P.M. The veterans of Grant Post, G. A.\r\nR., with Company D, N. G. C., and several hundred citizens, gave the\r\nPresident a rousing greeting. The Committee of Reception was Hon. John\r\nS. Alexander, Charles A. Post, and Rev. Dr. Webb.\r\n\r\nGeorge Perley introduced President Harrison, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-citizens_--It is very pleasant for me to meet here,\r\n  as at all the stations I have passed, a kindly assembly of my\r\n  fellow-countrymen. We do not need any one to watch us, nor do we need\r\n  to keep watch against anybody else. Peace and good-will characterize\r\n  our communities. I was quite amused at a station not far from here to\r\n  hear a wondering Chinaman remark as he came up to the train, \"Why,\r\n  they have no guns on board!\" [Laughter.] How different it is with\r\n  us!--no retinue, no guards. We travel across this broad country safe\r\n  in the confidence and fellowship and kindness of its citizenship. What\r\n  other land is there like it? Where else are there homes like ours?\r\n  Where else institutions so free and yet so adequate to all the needs\r\n  of government, to make the home and community safe, to restrain the\r\n  ill-disposed, and everywhere to promote peace and individual happiness?\r\n\r\n  We congratulate each other that we are American citizens. Without\r\n  distinction of party, without taking note of the many existing\r\n  differences of opinion, we are all glad to do all in our power to\r\n  promote the dignity and prosperity of the country we love. We cannot\r\n  love it too much; we cannot be too careful that all our influence is\r\n  on the side of good government and of American interests. We do not\r\n  wish ill to any other nation or people in the world, but they must\r\n  excuse us if we regard our own fellow-citizens as having the highest\r\n  claim on our regard. We will promote such measures as look to our own\r\n  interests. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLATHROP, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's arrival at Lathrop was celebrated by several thousand\r\nresidents, re-enforced by large delegations from the neighboring city\r\nof Stockton. The Committee of Reception consisted of James J. Sloan,\r\nA. Henry Stevens, Z. T. White, O. H. P. Bailey, E. Jesurun, T. B.\r\nWalker, W. S. Reyner, D. Sanguinite, Geo. H. Seay, O. D. Wilson, C. F.\r\nSherburne, F. D. Simpson, and F. J. Walker. The Committee of Reception\r\nappointed by the Mayor of Stockton, and participating in behalf of that\r\ncity, was J. K. Doak, F. J. Ryan, I. S. Haines, Willis Lynch, H. R.\r\nMcNoble, J. M. Dormer, and F. T. Baldwin. A feature of the reception\r\nwas 100 school children, each carrying a bouquet, which they presented\r\nto the President and Mrs. Harrison, both of whom kissed several of the\r\nlittle donors. Postmaster Sloan delivered the welcoming address. The\r\nPresident, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I should be less than human if I were not\r\n  touched by the rapid succession of hearty greetings received by us in\r\n  our journey through California. I should be more than human if I were\r\n  able to say something new or interesting at each of these assemblies.\r\n\r\n  My heart has but one language: it is, \"I thank you.\"\r\n\r\n  Most tenderly do I feel as an individual so much of this kindness\r\n  as is personal to me, and as a public official I am most profoundly\r\n  grateful that the American people so unitedly show their love and\r\n  devotion to the Constitution and the flag.\r\n\r\n  We have a Government of the majority; it is the original compact\r\n  that when the majority has been fairly counted at the polls, the\r\n  expressed will of that majority, taking the form of public law enacted\r\n  by State Legislatures or the national Congress, shall be the sole rule\r\n  of conduct of every loyal man. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We have no other king than law, and he is entitled to the allegiance\r\n  of every heart and bowed knee of every citizen. [Cries of \"Good!\r\n  good!\" and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I cannot look forward with any human apprehension to any danger to\r\n  our country, unless it approaches us through a corrupt ballot-box.\r\n  [Applause.] Let us keep that spring pure, and these happy valleys\r\n  shall teem with an increasing population of happy citizens, and our\r\n  country shall find in an increasing population only increased unity\r\n  and strength. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, APRIL 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Keyes Station, near Merced, the presidential train was joined by a\r\nspecial car containing the San Francisco escort committee. The following\r\ngentlemen composed the party and represented the organizations named:\r\nMexican Veterans--Maj. R. P. Hammond. California Pioneers--L. L.\r\nBaker, W. B. Farwell, Nathaniel Holland, and Col. A. W. von Schmidt.\r\nCitizens' Committee--E. S. Pillsbury, J. B. Crockett, M. M. Estee,\r\nIrving M. Scott, W. D. English, and Rev. Dr. Samuel V. Leech. Loyal\r\nLegion and Grand Army of the Republic--Chief Engineer J. W. Moore, U.\r\nS. N., Commander Loyal Legion; Past Senior Vice-Commander-in-Chief S.\r\nW. Backus; Past Department Commanders W. H. Aiken, E. Carlson, C. Mason\r\nKinne, W. A. Robinson, R. H. Marfield, W. R. Smedburg, E. S. Salomon, T.\r\nH. Goodman, G. E. Gard, and A. J. Buckles; Past Junior Vice-Commander\r\nJesse B. Fuller, Adjt.-Gen. T. C. Mastellar, Past Commander J. M.\r\nLitchfield, Congressmen E. F. Loud and John T. Cutting, comrades J. P.\r\nMeehan, S. S. Flint, and A. J. Hawes.\r\n\r\nSeven o'clock Saturday evening the boom of cannon and clang of bells\r\nsignalized the President's arrival at Oakland, where he immediately\r\nembarked on the ferry steamer _Piedmont_ for passage across the bay.\r\nOn board the _Piedmont_, in addition to the veteran guard of the G. A.\r\nR., commanded by Capt. Geo. F. Knowlton, Jr., and Lieutenants Wiegand,\r\nFranks and Stateler, were the following prominent residents: Senator\r\nand Mrs. Leland Stanford, A. N. Towne, R. H. Platt, A. J. Bolfing,\r\nH. C. Bunker, C. F. Bassett, Maj. J. N. E. Wilson, Capt. G. D. Boyd,\r\nJ. C. Quinn, Geo. L. Seybolt, George Sanderson, J. Steppacher, Ass't\r\nPostmaster Richardson, G. W.

The scene of\r\nthe _Piedmont_ crossing the bay, illuminated with thousands of lights,\r\ncovered with flying flags, and greeted by all the craft in the harbor\r\nwith myriads of rockets and lights, was a bewildering spectacle. At a\r\nsignal great tongues of flame shot up from the summits of Telegraph and\r\nNob hills, and the monstrous bonfires from the deck of the _Piedmont_\r\nresembled volcanoes. The entire population of the city came out to\r\ndo honor to the head of the Nation, and the principal streets were\r\nbeautifully illuminated.\r\n\r\nAs the President descended on the arm of Hon. W. W. Morrow he was met on\r\nthe wharf by Mayor George H. Sanderson, Col. Basil Norris, Lieut.-Col.\r\nGeo. H. Burton, Lieut.-Col. John P. Hawkins, Maj. Frank M. Coxe, Maj.\r\nEdward Hunter, Maj. James H. Lord, Capt. Chas. N. Booth, and First\r\nLieutenants L. A. Lovering and James E. Runcie, of the regular army;\r\nGeneral Dickinson and staff and city officials. Mayor Sanderson formally\r\nwelcomed the President and presented him a beautiful gold tablet bearing\r\na resolution of the Board of Supervisors tendering the freedom of the\r\ncity and county of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIn response the President said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor_--I have received with great gratification these words\r\n  of welcome which you have extended to me on behalf of the city of San\r\n  Francisco. They are but new expressions of the welcome which has been\r\n  extended to me since I entered the State of California. Its greatness\r\n  and glory I knew something of by story and tradition, but what I have\r\n  seen of its resources has quite surpassed my imagination. But what\r\n  has deeply impressed me is the loyal and intelligent and warm-hearted\r\n  people I have everywhere met. I thank you for this reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, APRIL 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, April 27, the President and his party reviewed many thousand\r\nschool children assembled on Van Ness Avenue. Escorted by Mayor\r\nSanderson, General Ruger, and other distinguished citizens, the party\r\nwere driven through the famous Golden Gate Park. At the entrance the\r\nPresident was met and welcomed by Park Commissioner Hammond, while\r\nawaiting the guests inside was a reception committee consisting of E. S.\r\nPilsbury, W. D. English, General Sheehan, Chief Crowley, C. F. Crocker,\r\nMr. and Mrs. W. B. Wilshire, Judge Hawley, of Nevada, ex-Mayor Pond,\r\nColonel Taylor, Marshal Long, Park Commissioner Austin, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFrancis G. Newlands, Samuel Shortridge, C. M. Leavy, Surveyor-General\r\nPratt, Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Le Count, Mr. and Mrs. E. P. Danforth, Colonel\r\nand Mrs. J. B. Wright, of Sacramento, Mr. and Mrs. Wendell Easton, Mr.\r\nGregory, Mr. and Mrs. Paris Kilbourn, Mr. and Mrs. Timothy G. Phelps,\r\nSenator Carpenter, of Los Angeles, Miss Harriet Bolinger, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBolinger, District Attorney Garter, Mrs. Judge W. T. Wallace, F. W.\r\nSharon, T. B. Shannon, Mrs. B. L. Haseltine, and others.\r\n\r\nThe reception concluded, the drive was continued to the Cliff House,\r\noverlooking Seal Rocks; from thence the party visited Sutro Heights and\r\nbecame the guests of Mr. Adolph Sutro. At the close of luncheon Mr.\r\nSutro, addressing President Harrison, said in part:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President_--I rise to present you a photo-lithographic letter\r\n  written by Sebastian Viscano, the great Spanish navigator. This is\r\n  probably the first letter in existence written by any human being from\r\n  California. It is dated at the port of Monterey, December 28, 1602,\r\n  named in honor of the Conde de Monterey, then Viceroy of Mexico. It\r\n  is addressed to the Court of Spain, and states that he (Viscano) had\r\n  taken possession of this country for his majesty.\r\n\r\n  The original of this letter I found in hunting through the Archives\r\n  de las Indias at Seville, Spain. At the date of this letter Queen\r\n  Elizabeth was still on the throne of England, Louis XIV. of France was\r\n  not born yet, and the Pilgrim Fathers had not yet landed on Plymouth\r\n  Rock.\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, we all thank you for having come to see our beautiful\r\n  land, and permit me especially to thank you for the honor of your\r\n  visit to Sutro Heights.\r\n\r\nWith the closing words Mr. Sutro extended to the President a red plush\r\nalbum inclosing the letter. President Harrison, in accepting it, said:\r\n\r\n  I beg to thank you both for this letter and your generous welcome\r\n  to a spot the natural beauty of which has been so much enhanced by\r\n  your efforts. My visit to Sutro Heights, the cliff, and park will be a\r\n  red-letter day in my journey.\r\n\r\nThe next visit was to the Presidio, where the President and\r\nGeneral Ruger witnessed the brilliant manoeuvres of the troops.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Graham was in command; Captain Zalinski was the\r\nofficer of the day. Captain Morris led the heavy artillery; Captains\r\nBrinkle and Kinzie commanded the mounted batteries; Colonel Mills headed\r\nthe cavalry aided by Captains Wood and Dorst.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phi Delta Theta._\r\n\r\nIn the evening the President attended a banquet in his honor by\r\nCalifornia Alpha Chapter of the State University of the Phi Delta Theta\r\nfraternity, of which Mr. Harrison is a member. George E. de Golbia\r\npresided. When the President arrived he was greeted with the fraternity\r\ncheer. J. N. E. Wilson introduced the honored guest and proposed the\r\nhealth of \"the President.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends and Brothers in this Old Society_--I enjoy this moment\r\n  very much in being able to associate with you. I was a member of the\r\n  first chapter of this fraternity, which you all know was founded at\r\n  Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. I have not lost the impression of\r\n  solemnity and reverence which I experienced hunting in the dark in\r\n  those early times to find my chapter room, and I am very glad to know\r\n  that those meetings were not meetings in the dark. I belonged to the\r\n  order when it was young, and now I find its members scattered in all\r\n  States, where they all hold positions of trust and influence. I find\r\n  that in its history it has produced nothing discreditable to itself,\r\n  but always something of which we may all well be proud. I thank you\r\n  for these few moments of association with you. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAt night President and Mrs. Harrison, Secretary Rusk, and\r\nPostmaster-General Wanamaker attended an official card reception at the\r\nPalace Hotel, tendered by the citizens of San Francisco. The visitors\r\nwere introduced by Col. J. P. Jackson and George R. Sanderson. The\r\noccasion was one of unusual brilliancy, rendered especially so by the\r\npresence of Admiral A. E. K. Benham and the officers of the fleet, Gen.\r\nThomas H. Ruger, Gen. G. D. Green, Gen. John P. Hawkins, Gen. John G.\r\nChandler, Col. Geo. N. Burton, and a hundred or more other officers of\r\nthe regular army; Governor Markham and staff in full uniform, Maj. Gen.\r\nW. H. Dimond and staff, Gen. J. H. Dickinson, and scores of officers\r\nof the National Guard, and a thousand or more private citizens of\r\nprominence accompanied by their wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, APRIL 28.\r\n\r\n_Launch of the Monterey._\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday, April 28, the President enjoyed an excursion on the bay on\r\nboard the steamer _Puebla_.

Grant, and\r\nother gentlemen of prominence.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, at the Union Iron Works, the President and Mrs.\r\nHarrison participated in the launch of the armored coast-defence vessel\r\n_Monterey_. Mrs. Harrison pressed the button which signalized the\r\nlaunching of the great ship, and Miss Gunn, daughter of J. O'B. Gunn,\r\nchristened the ship with a bottle of California champagne. On the\r\nplatform with the President's party were Henry T. Scott and Irving M.\r\nScott, builders of the _Monterey_; master shipwright Geo. W. Dickie,\r\nGovernor Markham, and other prominent people.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the distinguished visitors attended a banquet and\r\nreception at the mansion of Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford.

The first stop _en\r\nroute_ to Monterey was at Redwood City, where a large and enthusiastic\r\ncrowd, including 200 school children, welcomed the President. Geo. S.\r\nEvans Post, G. A. R., C. D. Harkins, Commander, was present. Among\r\nthe prominent citizens participating were: H. R. Judah, of San Mateo;\r\nGeo. C. Ross, W. R. Welch, Geo. W. Lovie, John Poole, Henry Buger,\r\nSheriff Kinne, Marshal Jamieson, and Judge Geo. H. Buck, who delivered\r\nthe speech of welcome and presented the President, on behalf of the\r\ncitizens, with a polished redwood tablet two feet in width.\r\n\r\nAs the train moved off President Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am sorry that I can say nothing more to you in\r\n  the limited time we have than that I am sincerely thankful for your\r\n  friendly demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN JOSÉ, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nArriving at San José the President remained an hour and reviewed a\r\nparade in his honor. He was received at the depot by Mayor S. N.\r\nRucker at the head of the following Committee of Reception: Judge John\r\nReynolds, Judge F. E. Spencer, D. B. Moody, R. O. Shively, S. F. Lieb,\r\nV. A. Schellar, C. M. Shortridge, T. E. Beans, L. G. Nesmith, C. T.\r\nRyland, O. A. Hale, H. W. Wright, J. W. Rea, C. T. Park, A. McDonald, C.\r\nT. Settle, H. M. Leonard, B. D. Murphy, J. H. Henry, A. E. Mintie, S. F.\r\nAyer, Judge W. G. Lorigan, and H. V. Morehouse. Mayor Rucker delivered\r\nthe address of welcome at the court house.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, responding, said.\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I am again surprised by this large\r\n  outpouring of my friends and by the respectful interest which they\r\n  evince. I cannot find words to express the delight which I have felt\r\n  and which those who journey with me have felt as we have observed\r\n  the beauty and, more than all, the comfort and prosperity which\r\n  characterize the great State of California. I am glad to observe here,\r\n  as I have elsewhere, that my old comrades of the great war for the\r\n  Union have turned out to witness afresh by this demonstration their\r\n  love for the flag and their veneration for American institutions.\r\n\r\n  My comrades, I greet you, every one, affectionately. I doubt not\r\n  that every loyal State has representatives here of that great army\r\n  that subdued the rebellion and brought home the flag in triumph. I\r\n  hope that you have found in this flowery and prosperous land, in the\r\n  happy homes which you have builded up here, in the wives and children\r\n  that grace your firesides, a sweet contrast to those times of peril\r\n  and hardship which you experienced in the army, and I trust above all\r\n  that under these genial and kindly influences you still maintain your\r\n  devotion to our institutions and are teaching it to the children that\r\n  shall take your places.\r\n\r\n  We often speak of the children following in the footsteps of\r\n  their fathers. A year ago nearly, in Boston, at the great review of\r\n  the Grand Army of the Republic, after those thousands of veterans,\r\n  stricken with years and labor, had passed along, a great army, nearly\r\n  as large, came on with the swinging step that characterized you when\r\n  you carried the flag from your home to the field. They were the sons\r\n  of veterans, literally marching in their fathers' steps; and so I love\r\n  to think that in the hands of this generation that is coming on to\r\n  take our places our institutions are safe and the honor and glory of\r\n  the flag will be maintained. We may quietly go to our rest when God\r\n  shall call us, in the full assurance that His favoring providence will\r\n  follow us, and that in your children valor and sacrifice for the flag\r\n  will always manifest themselves on every occasion.\r\n\r\n  Again thanking you for your presence and friendly interest, I must\r\n  beg you to excuse further speech, as we must journey on to other\r\n  scenes like this. Good-by and God bless you, comrades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGILROY, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo thousand people welcomed the President on his arrival at Gilroy at 6\r\no'clock in the evening. The floral decorations were particularly fine;\r\nthe piece attracting the greatest attention was a life-size white bear\r\nmade of tea-roses. The Committee of Reception was Mayor Loupe, Thomas\r\nRea, Geo. E. Hersey, Victor Bassignsno, F. W. Blake, Professor Hall, and\r\nMessrs. Eckhart, Casey, and Cleveland.\r\n\r\nMayor Loupe introduced the President, who made one of his briefest\r\nspeeches. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It gives me great pleasure to see you for a moment,\r\n  and thank you for your kindness in coming out on this occasion. In\r\n  all my travels I have never seen a more intelligent and happy people\r\n  than I have met in California. Let me introduce you to Mr. Wanamaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATSONVILLE, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Pajaro Station the presidential party was welcomed by the Board of\r\nTrustees and 2,000 residents of the thriving city of Watsonville, in\r\nthe beautiful Pajaro Valley. Six hundred school children and a young\r\nladies' zouave company participated in the greeting. The Committee of\r\nReception comprised the Board of Trustees, E. H. Madden, T. J. Horgan,\r\nJames A. Linscott, H. P. Brassell, and the following prominent citizens\r\nof Watsonville: W. A. Sanborn, A. B. Hawkins, Geo. A. Shearer, Geo. W.\r\nPeckham, W. R. Radcliff, J. A. Hetherington, James Waters, Mark Hudson,\r\nGeo. A. Trafton, John T. Porter, John F. Kane, and F. E. Mauk; also,\r\nWm. Wilson and C. E. Bowman, representing the town of Corralitos, and\r\nC. R. Whitcher, Jr., representing Castroville. Chairman Madden made the\r\nwelcoming address.\r\n\r\nThe President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very glad to see you this evening. I am sorry\r\n  that the fatigues of the past few days have left us all in a state\r\n  not quite so fresh and blooming as your fields and gardens. We are a\r\n  little dusty and a little worn, but you quite rekindle our spirits by\r\n  this demonstration. We have ridden with great delight through this\r\n  beautiful valley to-day. It seems to me, as we pass each ridge or\r\n  backbone and come into a new valley, that we see something that still\r\n  more resembles the Garden of Eden. It is a constant succession of\r\n  surprises, but most of all I delight to see such convincing evidence\r\n  of the contentment and happiness of your people. I am sure that those\r\n  I see here to-day must come from happy and prosperous homes. I wish\r\n  you all good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEREY, CALIFORNIA, APRIL 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party arrived at Del Monte depot at 8 o'clock Wednesday\r\nevening and were the guests of Manager Schonewald, of the famous Hotel\r\nDel Monte. The next morning the distinguished travellers were driven\r\nover to Monterey, the historic old capital of California; they were\r\nmet at the outskirts by the City Trustees and a committee of prominent\r\ncitizens, among whom were: C. I. Burks, Capt. Thomas Bralee, Francis\r\nDoud, David Rodrick, F. R. Day, Edward Ingram, Job Wood, Thomas Doud,\r\nJ. T. Stockdale, Jacob R. Leese, Wm. Kay, A. A. Osio, and H. Whitcomb.\r\nThe reception was held on the grounds fronting the old Capitol--now\r\nused as a school-house. After the reception the visitors were taken on\r\nan 18-mile drive through the parks and groves along the Pacific Ocean.\r\nMayor W. J. Hill, of Salinas, delivered the address of welcome on behalf\r\nof the citizens of Monterey and Salinas, and presented the President\r\nwith a silver plate engraved with a fac-simile of the old Custom House\r\nand the words \"The Custom House where the American flag was first raised\r\nin California, July 7, 1846. Monterey, April 30, 1891. Greeting to our\r\nPresident.\"\r\n\r\nIn response the President said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--Our whole pathway through the State\r\n  of California has been paved with good-will. We have been made to walk\r\n  upon flowers. Our hearts have been touched and refreshed at every\r\n  point by the voluntary offerings of your hospitable people. Our trip\r\n  has been one continued ovation of friendliness. I have had occasion\r\n  to say before that no man is entitled to appropriate to himself these\r\n  tributes. They witness a peculiar characteristic of the American\r\n  people. Unlike many other people less happy, we give our devotion to\r\n  a Government, to its Constitution, to its flag, and not to men. We\r\n  reverence and obey those who have been placed by our own suffrages\r\n  and choice in public stations, but our allegiance, our affection, is\r\n  given to our beneficent institutions, and upon this rock our security\r\n  is based. We are not subject to those turbulent uprisings that prevail\r\n  where the people follow leaders rather than institutions; where they\r\n  are caught by the glamour and dash of brilliant men rather than by the\r\n  steady law of free institutions.\r\n\r\n  I rejoice to be for a moment among you this morning. The history\r\n  of this city starts a train of reflections in my mind that I cannot\r\n  follow out in speech, but the impression of them will remain with me\r\n  as long as I live. [Applause.] California and its coast were essential\r\n  to the integrity and completeness of the American Union. But who\r\n  can tell what may be the result of the establishment here of free\r\n  institutions, the setting up by the wisdom and foresight and courage\r\n  of the early pioneers in California of a commonwealth that was very\r\n  early received into the American Union? We see to-day what has been\r\n  wrought. But who can tell what another century will disclose, when\r\n  these valleys have become thick with a prosperous and thriving and\r\n  happy people? I thank you again for your cordial greeting and bid you\r\n  good-morning. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA CRUZ, CALIFORNIA, MAY 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 8 o'clock Friday morning the presidential train halted at Santa Cruz,\r\nthe City of the Holy Cross, where another floral greeting awaited the\r\ndistinguished guests. They were met by Mayor G. Bowman at the head of a\r\ncommittee of prominent citizens, among whom were: Col. Thomas P. Robb,\r\nW. P. Young, Dr. T. W. Drullard, W. Finkeldey, O. J. Lincoln, W. J.\r\nMcCollum, A. L. Weeks, P. R. Hinds, W. H. Galbraith, E. C. Williams,\r\nDuncan McPherson, Wm. T. Jeter, A. A. Taylor, W. D. Storey, F. A.\r\nHihn, Z. N. Goldsby, Richard Thompson, R. C. Kirby, J. H. Logan, A. J.\r\nJennings, Judge McCann, J. F. Cunningham, Benj. Knight, Z. Barnet, E. C.\r\nWilliams, and J. T. Sullivan. Grand Marshal J. O. Wanzer, with his aids,\r\nU. S. Nichols, M. S. Patterson, H. Fay, W. D. Haslam, R. H. Pringle, W.\r\nC. Hoffman, and George Chittenden, acted as an escort of honor to the\r\nPresident during the parade. When the Pacific Ocean House was reached\r\nMayor Bowman made a welcoming address. After the reception the party\r\nvisited the grove of big trees near the city.\r\n\r\nAs the President arose to respond the great audience cheered\r\nenthusiastically. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--It seems to me like improvidence\r\n  that all this tasteful and magnificent display should be but for a\r\n  moment. In all my journeying in California, where every city has\r\n  presented some surprise and where each has been characterized by\r\n  lavish and generous display, I have not seen anything so suddenly\r\n  created and yet so beautiful. I am sure we have not ridden through\r\n  any street more attractive than this. I thank you most sincerely for\r\n  this cordial welcome. I am sure you are a loyal, and I know you are a\r\n  loving and kindly people. [Cheers.] We have been received, strangers\r\n  as we were, with affection, and everywhere as I look into the faces of\r\n  this people I feel my heart swell with pride that I am an American and\r\n  that California is one of the American States. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOS GATOS, CALIFORNIA, MAY 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop after leaving Santa Cruz was at Los Gatos, overlooking\r\nthe Santa Clara Valley, where a large assemblage welcomed the party. The\r\nCommittee of Reception comprised the Board of Town Trustees and W. H. B.\r\nTrantham, James H. Lyndon, G. A. Dodge, and C. F. Wilcox. E. O. C. Ord\r\nPost, G. A. R., James G. Arthur, Commander, was out in full force.\r\n\r\nChairman J. W. Lyndon made the address of welcome and introduced\r\nPresident Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow citizens_--If California had lodged a complaint against\r\n  the last census I should have been inclined to entertain it and to\r\n  order your people to be counted again. [Laughter.] From what I have\r\n  seen in these days of pleasant travel through your State I am sure\r\n  the census enumerators have not taken you all. We have had another\r\n  surprise in coming over these mountains to find that not the valleys\r\n  alone of California, but its hill-tops are capable of productive\r\n  cultivation. We have been greatly surprised to see vineyards and\r\n  orchards at these altitudes, and to know that your fields rival in\r\n  productiveness the famous valleys of your State.\r\n\r\n  I thank you for your cordial greeting. It overpowers me I feel that\r\n  these brief stops are but poor recompense for the trouble and care\r\n  you have taken. I wish we could tarry longer with you. I wish I could\r\n  know more of you individually, but I can only thank you and say that\r\n  we will carry away most happy impressions of California, and that in\r\n  public and in private life it will give me pleasure always to show my\r\n  appreciation of your great State. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, MAY 1.\r\n\r\n_Chamber of Commerce Reception._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President returned to San Francisco from his trip to Monterey and\r\nSanta Cruz at noon Friday, May 1. He was met across the bay by W. W.\r\nMontague, Geo. C. Perkins, and Oliver Eldridge, constituting a committee\r\nof escort from the Chamber of Commerce. Arrived at the Chamber of\r\nCommerce the President was met by the following Reception Committee,\r\ntrustees of the Chamber, composed of: William L. Merry, A. J. Ralston,\r\nW. T. Y. Schenck, Robert Watt, A. R. Briggs, James Carolan, N. W.\r\nSpaulding, General Dimond, John Rosenfeld, Charles R. Allen, J. J.\r\nMcKinnon, C. B. Stone, and Louis Parrott. On the floor of the Merchants'\r\nExchange the President was greeted by a great and enthusiastic assembly,\r\ncomposed of members of the following bodies invited to participate in\r\nthe reception: Mexican War Veterans, Society of Pioneers, Territorial\r\nPioneers, Geographical Society, Art Association, Geological Society,\r\nState Board of Trade, Board of Trade of the city, Bar Association,\r\nBankers' Association, Produce Exchange, San Francisco Stock Exchange,\r\nMerchants' Exchange, Boards of Brokers, Boards of Marine Institute,\r\nChamber of Commerce, Manufacturers' Association, and California Academy\r\nof Sciences. Colonel Taylor, President of the Chamber of Commerce,\r\ndelivered an able address upon the trade of the Pacific coast, and\r\nclosed by cordially welcoming President Harrison, Postmaster-General\r\nWanamaker, and Secretary Rusk.\r\n\r\nWhen the President arose to respond he was greeted with a storm of\r\napplause. His address was punctured throughout with cheers. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen of these Assembled Societies_--I have\r\n  been subjected during my stay in California in some respects to\r\n  the same treatment the policeman accords to the tramp--I have been\r\n  kept moving on. You have substituted flowers and kindness for the\r\n  policeman's baton. And yet, notwithstanding all this, we come to you\r\n  this morning not exhausted or used up, but a little fatigued. Your\r\n  cordial greetings are more exhilarating than your wine, and perhaps\r\n  safer for the constitution. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to stand in the presence of this assemblage of business\r\n  men. I have tried to make this a business Administration. [Applause.]\r\n  Of course we cannot wholly separate politics from a national\r\n  Administration, but I have felt that every public officer owed his\r\n  best service to the people, without distinction of party [cries of\r\n  \"Good! good!\" and applause]; that in administering official trusts\r\n  we were in a very strict sense, not merely in a figurative sense,\r\n  your servants. It has been my desire that in every branch of the\r\n  public service there should be improvement. I have stimulated all the\r\n  Secretaries and have received stimulus from them in the endeavor, in\r\n  all the departments of the Government that touch your business life,\r\n  to give you as perfect a service as possible. This we owe to you; but\r\n  if I were pursuing party ends I should feel that I was by such methods\r\n  establishing my party in the confidence of the people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I feel that we have come to a point where American industries,\r\n  American commerce, and American influence are to be revived and\r\n  extended. The American sentiment and feeling was never more\r\n  controlling than now; and I do not use that term in the narrow sense\r\n  of native American, but to embrace all loyal citizens, whether\r\n  native-born or adopted, who have the love of our flag in their hearts.\r\n  [Great cheering.] I shall speak to-night, probably, at the banquet of\r\n  business men, and will not enter into any lengthy discussion here.\r\n  Indeed, I am so careful not to trespass upon any forbidden topic,\r\n  that I may not in the smallest degree offend those who have forgotten\r\n  party politics in extending this greeting to us, that I do not know\r\n  how far I should talk upon these public questions. But since your\r\n  Chairman has alluded to them, I can say I am in hearty sympathy with\r\n  the suggestions he has made. I believe there are methods by which\r\n  we shall put the American flag upon the sea again. [Applause.] In\r\n  speaking the other day I used an illustration which will perhaps be\r\n  apt in this company of merchants. You recall, all of you, certainly\r\n  those of my age, the time when no merchant sent out travelling men. He\r\n  expected the buyer to come to his store. Perhaps that was well enough;\r\n  but certain enterprising men sought custom by putting travelling men\r\n  with samples on the road. However the conservative merchant regarded\r\n  that innovation, he had but one choice--to put travelling men on the\r\n  road or go out of business. In this question of shipping we are in a\r\n  similar condition. The great commercial governments of the world have\r\n  stimulated their shipping interests by direct or indirect subsidies,\r\n  while we have been saying: \"No, we prefer the old way.\" We must\r\n  advance or--I will not say go out of business, for we have already\r\n  gone out. [Applause.] I thank you most cordially for your greeting,\r\n  and bid you good-by. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE VETERANS, MAY 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Chamber of Commerce the President and his party were escorted\r\nto the Mechanics' Pavilion by the Veteran Guard under Captain Knowlton,\r\npreceded and followed by Lincoln, Garfield, Cass, Meade, Liberty, and\r\nGeo. Sykes posts, G. A. R. Fully 10,000 children and citizens were\r\nassembled to witness the May Day festivities under the auspices of\r\nthe G. A. R. posts. Escorted by Grand Marshal Saloman, the President\r\nadvanced to the stage and was received by Hon. Henry C. Dibble, who\r\npresented him to the throng of veterans and children.\r\n\r\nHe spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic_--It will not be\r\n  possible in so large a hall for me to make myself heard, and yet I\r\n  cannot refuse when appealed to to say a word of kindly greeting to\r\n  those comrades who have found their homes on the Pacific coast. I have\r\n  no doubt that all the loyal States of the Union are represented in\r\n  this assembly, and it is pleasant to know that, after the strife and\r\n  hardships of those years of battle, you have found among the flowers\r\n  and fruits of the earth homes that are full of pleasantness and peace.\r\n\r\n  It was that these things might continue to be that you went to\r\n  battle; it was that these homes might be preserved; it was that the\r\n  flag and all that it symbolizes might be perpetuated, that you fought\r\n  and many of our comrades died. All this land calls you blessed. The\r\n  fruits of division and strife that would have been ours if secession\r\n  had succeeded would have been full of bitterness. The end that was\r\n  attained by your valor under the providence of God has brought peace\r\n  and prosperity to all the States. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It gave me great pleasure in passing through the Southern States\r\n  to see how your work had contributed to their prosperity. No man can\r\n  look upon any of these States through which we campaigned and fought\r\n  without realizing that what seemed to their people a disaster was,\r\n  under God, the opening of a great gate of prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\n  All those fires of industry which I saw through the South were\r\n  lighted at the funeral pyre of slavery. [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and\r\n  applause.] They were impossible under the conditions that existed\r\n  previously in those States. We are now a homogeneous people. You in\r\n  California, full of pride and satisfaction with the greatness of your\r\n  State, will always set above it the greater glory and the greater\r\n  citizenship which our flag symbolizes. [Cheers.] You went into the\r\n  war for the defence of the Union; you have come out to make your\r\n  contribution to the industries and progress of this age of peace. As\r\n  in our States of the Northwest the winter covering of snow hides and\r\n  warms the vegetation, and with the coming of the spring sun melts and\r\n  sinks into the earth to refresh the root, so this great army was a\r\n  covering and defence, and when the war was ended, turned into rivulets\r\n  of refreshment to all the pursuits of peace. There was nothing greater\r\n  in all the world's story than the assembling of this army except its\r\n  disbandment. It was an army of citizens; and when the war was over the\r\n  soldier was not left at the tavern--he had a fireside toward which\r\n  his steps hastened. He ceased to be a soldier and became a citizen.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I observe, as I look into your faces, that the youth of the army\r\n  must have settled on the Pacific coast. [Laughter and applause.] You\r\n  are younger men here than we are in the habit of meeting at our Grand\r\n  Army posts in the East. May all prosperity attend you; may you be\r\n  able to show yourselves in civil life, as in the war, the steadfast,\r\n  unfaltering, devoted friends of this flag you are willing to die for.\r\n  [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALACE HOTEL BANQUET, MAY 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening President Harrison attended a grand banquet given in\r\nhis honor by the prominent citizens at the Palace Hotel. Of all the\r\nentertainments extended to the distinguished visitors on their journey\r\nthis banquet was beyond question the most notable. Representatives of\r\nthe business, professional, political, educational, and society circles\r\nof the city were present in numbers. The brilliant affair was largely\r\ndirected by Colonel Andrews, Alfred Bovier, Geo. R. Sanderson, and\r\nMessrs. Le Count, Jackson, and Menzies of the Citizens' Committee.\r\n\r\nThe President was escorted to the banquet hall by General Barnes and\r\nintroduced to the distinguished assembly quite early in the evening.\r\nAfter the vociferous cheering subsided General Harrison rewarded the\r\nmagnificent assemblage with an address that called forth from the press\r\nof the country general commendation, and is only second to his great\r\nspeech at Galveston. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen_--When the Queen of Sheba visited the\r\n  court of Solomon and saw its splendors she was compelled to testify\r\n  that the half had not been told her. Undoubtedly the emissaries of\r\n  Solomon's court, who had penetrated to her distant territory, found\r\n  themselves in a like situation to that which attends Californians\r\n  when they travel East--they are afraid to put too much to test\r\n  the credulity of their hearers [laughter and applause], and as a\r\n  gentleman of your State said to me, it has resulted in a prevailing\r\n  indisposition among Californians to tell the truth out of California.\r\n  [Laughter and applause.] Not at all because Californians are\r\n  unfriendly to the truth, but solely out of compassion for their\r\n  hearers they address themselves to the capacity of those who hear\r\n  them. [Laughter.] And taking warning by the fate of the man who told a\r\n  sovereign of the Indies that he had seen water so solid that it could\r\n  be walked upon, they do not carry their best stories away from home.\r\n  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  It has been, much as I have heard of California, a brilliant\r\n  disillusion to me and to those who have journeyed with me. The half\r\n  had not been told of the productiveness of your valleys, of the\r\n  blossoming orchards, of the gardens laden with flowers. We have seen\r\n  and been entranced. Our pathway has been strewn with flowers. We have\r\n  been surprised, when we were in a region of orchards and roses, to be\r\n  suddenly pulled up at a station and asked to address some remarks to a\r\n  pyramid of pig tin. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  Products of the mine, rare and exceptional, have been added to the\r\n  products of the field, until now the impression has been made upon my\r\n  mind that if any want should be developed in the arts, possibly if\r\n  any wants should be developed in statesmanship, or any vacancies in\r\n  office [great laughter], we have here a safe reservoir that can be\r\n  drawn upon _ad libitum_. [Laughter]. But, my friends, sweeter than all\r\n  the incense of flowers, richer than all the products of mines, has\r\n  been the gracious, unaffected, hearty kindness with which the people\r\n  of California have everywhere received us. Without division, without\r\n  dissent, a simple yet magnificent and enthusiastic American welcome.\r\n  [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is gratifying that it should be so. We may carry into our\r\n  campaigns, to our conventions and congresses, discussions and\r\n  divisions, but how grand it is that we are a people who bow reverently\r\n  to the decision when it is rendered, and who will follow the flag\r\n  always, everywhere, with absolute devotion of heart without asking\r\n  what party may have given the leader in whose hands it is placed.\r\n  [Enthusiastic cheering.]\r\n\r\n  I believe that we have come to a new epoch as a Nation. There are\r\n  opening portals before us inviting us to enter--opening portals to\r\n  trade and influence and prestige such as we have never seen before.\r\n  [Great applause.] We will pursue the paths of peace; we are not\r\n  a warlike Nation; all our instincts, all our history is in the\r\n  lines of peace. Only intolerable aggression, only the peril of our\r\n  institutions--of the flag--can thoroughly arouse us. [Great applause.]\r\n  With capability for war on land and on sea unexcelled by any nation in\r\n  the world, we are smitten with the love of peace. [Applause.] We would\r\n  promote the peace of this hemisphere by placing judiciously some large\r\n  guns about the Golden Gate [great and enthusiastic cheering]--simply\r\n  for saluting purposes [laughter and cheers], and yet they should be of\r\n  the best modern type. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We should have on the sea some good vessels. We don't need as\r\n  great a navy as some other people, but we do need a sufficient navy\r\n  of first-class ships, simply to make sure that the peace of the\r\n  hemisphere is preserved [cheers]; simply that we may not leave the\r\n  great distant marts and harbors of commerce and our few citizens who\r\n  may be domiciled there to feel lonesome for the sight of the American\r\n  flag. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We are making fine progress in the construction of the navy. The\r\n  best English constructors have testified to the completeness and\r\n  perfection of some of our latest ships. It is a source of great\r\n  gratification to me that here in San Francisco the energy, enterprise,\r\n  and courage of some of your citizens have constructed a plant capable\r\n  of building the best modern ships. [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I saw with delight the magnificent launch of one of these new\r\n  vessels. I hope that you may so enlarge your capacities for\r\n  construction that it will not be necessary to send any naval vessel\r\n  around the Horn. We want merchant ships. [Cheers.] I believe we have\r\n  come to a time when we should choose whether we will continue to be\r\n  non-participants in the commerce of the world or will now vigorously,\r\n  with the push and energy which our people have shown in other lines of\r\n  enterprise, claim our share of the world's commerce. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I will not enter into the discussion of methods of the Postal bill\r\n  of the last session of Congress, which marks the beginning. Here in\r\n  California, where for so long a time a postal service that did not pay\r\n  its own way was maintained by the Government, where for other years\r\n  the Government has maintained mail lines into your valleys, reaching\r\n  out to every remote community, and paying out yearly a hundred times\r\n  the revenue that was derived, it ought not to be difficult to persuade\r\n  you that our ocean mail should not longer be the only service for\r\n  which we refuse to expend even the revenues derived from it.\r\n\r\n  It is my belief that, under the operation of the law to which I have\r\n  referred, we shall be able to stimulate ship-building, to secure some\r\n  new lines of American steamships, and to increase the ports of call of\r\n  all those now established. [Enthusiastic cheering.]\r\n\r\n  It will be my effort to do what may be done under the powers lodged\r\n  in me by the law to open and increase trade with the countries of\r\n  Central and South America. I hope it may not be long--I know it will\r\n  not be long if we but unitedly pursue this great scheme--until one can\r\n  take a sail in the bay of San Francisco and see some deep-water ships\r\n  come in bearing our own flag. [Enthusiastic and continued cheering.]\r\n\r\n  During our excursion the other day I saw three great vessels come\r\n  in; one carried the Hawaiian and two the English flag. I am a thorough\r\n  believer in the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. You have pleased\r\n  me so much that I would like a shorter water communication between\r\n  my State and yours. [Cheers.] Influences and operations are now\r\n  started that will complete, I am sure, this stately enterprise; but,\r\n  my fellow-citizens and Mr. President, this is the fifth time this day\r\n  that I have talked to gatherings of California friends, and we have so\r\n  much taxed the hospitality of San Francisco in making our arrangements\r\n  to make this city the centre of a whole week's sight-seeing that I do\r\n  not want to add to your other burdens the infliction of longer speech.\r\n  [Cries of \"Go on!\"] Right royally have you welcomed us with all that\r\n  is rich and prodigal in provision and display. With all graciousness\r\n  and friendliness I leave my heart with you when I go. [Great and\r\n  prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, MAY 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Saturday morning, May 2, the President left San Francisco,\r\naccompanied by Mrs. Harrison and Mrs. Dimmick, Secretary Rusk, Marshal\r\nRansdell, and Major Sanger, to visit the capital city, Sacramento. They\r\nwere met at Davisville by a special committee consisting of: Hon. Newton\r\nBooth, Hon. A. P. Catlin, Hon. W. C. Van Fleet, Col. J. B. Wright, Hon.\r\nJ. O. Coleman, Maj. Wm. McLaughlin, Col. C. H. Hubbard, Hon. N. Curtis,\r\nHon. Theo. Reichert, R. B. Harmon, and Hon. W. C.

Larkin, Richard Burr, and Samuel Lavenson.\r\n\r\nThe march from the depot to the Capitol grounds was one continuous\r\novation. The veterans of Warren, Sumner, and Fair Oaks posts, G. A.\r\nR., acted as an escort of honor. The militia was commanded by Gen. T.\r\nW. Sheehan. More than 30,000 people witnessed or participated in the\r\ndemonstration. As the President passed Pioneer Hall he halted the column\r\nto receive the greetings of the venerable members of the Sacramento\r\nSociety. Governor Markham delivered an eloquent address, reciting\r\nthe discovery of gold in California, reviewing the President's tour\r\nthrough the State, and bidding him \"good-by and God-speed.\" Ex-Governor\r\nBooth and Secretary Rusk also made short speeches. Postmaster-General\r\nWanamaker was detained at San Francisco, inspecting sites for a new\r\npost-office. His absence was a disappointment to the postal employees,\r\nwho sent him a silver tablet, the size of a money-order, engraved with\r\ntheir compliments, as a memento.\r\n\r\nThe President's address was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Markham and Fellow-citizens_--Our eyes have rested upon no\r\n  more beautiful or impressive sight since we entered California. This\r\n  fresh, delightful morning, this vast assemblage of contented and happy\r\n  people, this building, dedicated to the uses of civil government--all\r\n  things about us tend to inspire our hearts with pride and with\r\n  gratitude.\r\n\r\n  Gratitude to that overruling Providence that turned hither after the\r\n  discovery of this continent the steps of those who had the capacity to\r\n  organize a free representative government.\r\n\r\n  Gratitude to that Providence that has increased the feeble colonies\r\n  on an inhospitable coast to these millions of prosperous people, who\r\n  have found another sea and populated its sunny shores with a happy and\r\n  growing people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Gratitude to that Providence that led us through civil strife to\r\n  a glory and a perfection of unity as a people that was otherwise\r\n  impossible.\r\n\r\n  Gratitude that we have to-day a Union of free States without a slave\r\n  to stand as a reproach to that immortal declaration upon which our\r\n  Government rests. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Pride that our people have achieved so much; that, triumphing over\r\n  all the hardships of those early pioneers, who struggled in the face\r\n  of discouragement and difficulties more appalling than those that met\r\n  Columbus when he turned the prows of his little vessels toward an\r\n  unknown shore; that, triumphing over perils of starvation, perils of\r\n  savages, perils of sickness, here on the sunny slope of the Pacific\r\n  they have established civil institutions and set up the banner of the\r\n  imperishable Union. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Every Californian who has followed in their footsteps, every man and\r\n  woman who is to-day enjoying the harvest of their endeavors, should\r\n  always lift his hat to the pioneer of '49. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We stand here at the political centre of a great State, in this\r\n  building where your lawmakers assemble, chosen by your suffrages\r\n  to execute your will in framing those rules of conduct which shall\r\n  control the life of the citizen. May you always find here patriotic,\r\n  consecrated men to do your work. May they always assemble here with a\r\n  high sense of duty to those brave, intelligent, and honorable people.\r\n  May they catch the great lesson of our Government, that our people\r\n  need only such regulation as shall restrain the ill-disposed and shall\r\n  give the largest liberty to individual enterprise and effort. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  No man is gifted with speech to describe the beauty and the\r\n  impressiveness of this great occasion. I am awed in this presence.\r\n  I bow reverently to this great assembly of free, intelligent,\r\n  enterprising American sovereigns. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to have this hasty glimpse of this early centre of\r\n  immigration. I am glad to stand at the place where that momentous\r\n  event, the discovery of gold, transpired, and yet, after you have\r\n  washed your sand of gold, after the eager rush for sudden wealth,\r\n  after all this you have come into a heritage in the possession of\r\n  these fields, in those enduring and inexhaustible treasures of your\r\n  soil, which will perpetually sustain a great population.\r\n\r\n  In parting, sir [to the Governor], to you as the representative of\r\n  this people I give the most hearty thanks of all who journey with me\r\n  and my own for the early, continuous, kindly, yea, even affectionate\r\n  attention which has followed us in all our footsteps through\r\n  California. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENICIA, CALIFORNIA, MAY 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Sacramento the President made a brief stop at Benicia, where\r\na large crowd greeted him, including the school children, who bombarded\r\nhim with flowers. The welcoming committee was D. M. Hart, President of\r\nthe Board of Trustees; A. Dalton, Jr., S. C. Gray, and W. H. Foreman.\r\n\r\nIn response to calls for a speech the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I thank you most sincerely for this pleasant tribute\r\n  which I have received from these children. It is a curious thing,\r\n  perhaps, that among the earliest towns that became familiar to me in\r\n  my younger days was Benicia. In 1857, when the United States sent an\r\n  armed expedition to Utah, and thence across the continent, I happened\r\n  to have an elder and much-beloved brother who was a lieutenant in that\r\n  campaign. He was stationed at Benicia Barracks, and his letters from\r\n  this place have fixed it in my memory, and recalls to me, as I stand\r\n  here this morning, very tender memories of one who has long since gone\r\n  to his rest. I thank you again for this demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, MAY 2.\r\n\r\n_State University._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President arrived at West Berkeley station at 1 o'clock and was\r\nmet by the Berkeley Reception Committee, consisting of C. R. Lord,\r\nJ. L. Scotchler, R. Rickard, E. F. Neihauser, Samuel Heywood, C.\r\nGaines, J. S. Eastman, John Squires, F. B. Cone, Chris. Johnson, John\r\nFinn, George Schmidt, L. Gottshall, A. F. Fonzo, H. W. Taylor, and\r\nC. E. Wulferdingen. A procession was formed, and amid thousands of\r\nenthusiastic onlookers the party was driven to the State University.\r\nAt the main entrance the President found the Faculty, the University\r\nBattalion, and about 1,000 other people awaiting his coming. Acting\r\nPresident Kellogg briefly welcomed the distinguished guest.\r\n\r\nThe President, standing with uncovered head in the carriage, spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  It gives me great pleasure even to inspect these grounds\r\n  and the exterior of these buildings devoted to education. Our\r\n  educational institutions, beginning with the primary common schools\r\n  and culminating in the great universities of the land, are the\r\n  instrumentalities by which the future citizens of this country are\r\n  to be trained in the principles of morality and in the intellectual\r\n  culture which will fit them to maintain, develop, and perpetuate what\r\n  their fathers have begun.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to receive your welcome, and only regret that it is\r\n  impossible for me to make a closer observation of your work. I unite\r\n  with you in mourning the loss which has come to you in the death of\r\n  Professor Le Conte. I wish for the institution and for those who are\r\n  called here to train the young the guidance and blessing of God in all\r\n  their endeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Institute of the Dumb and Blind._\r\n\r\nLeaving the University the President was rapidly driven through a\r\nbeautiful residence district and entered the grounds of the California\r\nInstitute of the Deaf, Dumb and Blind. Before the great edifice stood\r\nthe teachers: G. B. Goodall, T. D'Estrella, T. Grady, F. O'Donnell,\r\nHenry Frank, Douglas Kieth, C. T. Wilkinson, N. F. Whipple, Mary Dutch,\r\nLaura Nourse, Elizabeth Moffitt, Rose Sedgwick, Otto Fleissner, and\r\nCharles S. Perry. Assembled on the green were more than 200 afflicted\r\nlittle ones. The blind welcomed the President with their sympathetic\r\nvoices, the dumb looked upon him and smiled, while the deaf waved their\r\nlittle hands with joy. Superintendent Wilkinson in an address warmly\r\nthanked the party for their visit.\r\n\r\nThe President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  It gives me great pleasure to stop for a moment at one of these\r\n  institutions so characteristic of our Christian civilization. In\r\n  the barbarous ages of the world the afflicted were regarded by\r\n  superstition unhelpful, or treated with cruel neglect; but in this\r\n  better day the States are everywhere making magnificent provision for\r\n  the comfort and education of the blind and deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\n  Where one avenue to the mind has been closed science is opening\r\n  another. The eye does the work of the ear, the finger the work of\r\n  the tongue for the dumb, and touch becomes sight to the blind. I am\r\n  sure that gladness has come to all these young hearts through the\r\n  benevolent, careful, and affectionate instruction they are receiving\r\n  here. I thank you, and wish all of you the utmost happiness through\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOAKLAND, CALIFORNIA, MAY 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the Asylum for the Blind the presidential party was driven\r\nrapidly to Oakland, passing through the suburban town of Temescal, where\r\na large crowd, including several hundred school children, greeted the\r\ndistinguished visitors. The President was accompanied by Mayor Melvin\r\nChapman and the following members of the Oakland Reception Committee:\r\nEx-Mayor John R. Glascock, Hon. Geo. E. Whitney, Senator W. E. Dargie,\r\nJ. G. McCall, A. C. Donnell, T. C. Coogan, John P. Irish, Hon. E. S.\r\nDenison, C. D. Pierce, J. W. McClymonds, W. D. English, H. M. Sanborn,\r\nM. J. Keller, J. F. Evans, A. W. Bishop, W. W. Foote, Robert McKillican,\r\nCharles G. Yale, G. W. McNear, W. R. Thomas, C. B. Evans, and Maj. F. R.\r\nO'Brien.\r\n\r\nAs the presidential carriage turned into Jackson Street at half-past\r\n1 o'clock nearly 10,000 school children welcomed the Chief Magistrate\r\nwith a fusillade of bouquets. The crowd was so great the President was\r\nunable to reach the reviewing stand, where Mr. Wanamaker awaited him.\r\nMaking the best of the situation, Mayor Chapman arose in the carriage\r\nand formally welcomed the President on behalf of the citizens.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, speaking from the same carriage, responded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I am glad to meet you all, and\r\n  I assure you I appreciate this magnificent demonstration. I must\r\n  congratulate you upon your fine institutions, and particularly your\r\n  streets, which, I believe, are the best in the country. I thank you\r\n  for this reception most heartily. I regret that your enthusiasm and\r\n  the vast size of this assembly has somewhat disconcerted the programme\r\n  marked out, but I can speak as well from here as from the stand, which\r\n  seems to be inaccessible. I return my sincere thanks for your welcome\r\n  and express the interest and gratification I have felt this morning\r\n  in riding through some of the streets of your beautiful city. I thank\r\n  you most sincerely for your friendliness and bid you good-by. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, MAY 2.\r\n\r\n_Union League Reception._\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately on returning from his arduous trip to Sacramento and Oakland\r\nthe President attended a reception in his honor tendered by members of\r\nthe Union League at their club-house. The affair was one of the most\r\nnotable of any in which the presidential guests participated during\r\ntheir visit to the golden West, and was conducted under the direction\r\nof the following committee: A. E. Castle, Joseph S. Spear, Jr., F. S.\r\nChadbourne, W. H. Chamberlain, T. H. Minor, J. H. Hegler, Frank J.\r\nFrench, J. T. Giesting, William Macdonald, J. S. Mumaugh, R. D. Laidlaw,\r\nS. K. Thornton, W. D. Sanborn, Joseph Simonson, J. M. Litchfield, and L.\r\nH. Clement.\r\n\r\nThe President entered upon the arm of Wendell Easton, President of the\r\nUnion League Club, followed by the first lady of the land, escorted by\r\nGovernor Markham. The Reception Committee comprised: Senator Stanford,\r\nGeneral Dimond, M. H. de Young, Judge Estee, I. C. Stump, W. C. Van\r\nFleet, C. J. Bandmann, W. E. Dargie, N. P. Chipman, Lewis Gerstle, F. A.\r\nVail, Col. W. R. Shafter, Mrs. Leland Stanford, Mrs. R. D. Laidlaw, Mrs.\r\nW. H. Chamberlain, Mrs. Joseph S. Spear, Jr., Mrs. W. W. Morrow, Mrs. F.\r\nL. Castle, Mrs. M. H. de Young, Mrs. N. P. Chipman, Mrs. C. J. Bandmann,\r\nMiss Emma Spreckels, Miss Thornton, Mrs. Wendell Easton, Mrs. S. W.\r\nBackus, Mrs. G. H. Sanderson, Mrs. W. E. Dargie, Miss Stump, Miss Reed,\r\nand others prominent in society.\r\n\r\nAfter the long and brilliant column had passed before the presidential\r\nline Samuel M. Shortridge stepped before the President and in an\r\neloquent address in behalf of the Union League Club presented him with a\r\nfac-simile, in gold, of the invitation issued to the reception.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison, in accepting the beautiful souvenir, said:\r\n\r\n  California is full of ambuscades, not of a hostile sort, but with\r\n  all embarrassments that attend surprise. In a hasty drive this\r\n  afternoon, when I thought I was to visit Oakland, I was suddenly\r\n  drawn up in front of a college and asked to make an address, and in a\r\n  moment afterward before an asylum for the deaf, dumb, and blind, the\r\n  character of which I did not know until the carriage stopped in front\r\n  of it. All this taxes the ingenuity as your kindness moves the heart\r\n  of one who is making a hurried journey through California. I do not\r\n  need such souvenirs as this to keep fresh in my heart this visit to\r\n  your State. It will be pleasant, however, to show to others who have\r\n  not participated in this enjoyment the record of a trip that has been\r\n  very eventful and one of perpetual sunshine and happiness. I do not\r\n  think I could have endured the labor and toil of travel unless I had\r\n  been borne up by the inspiriting and hearty good-will of your people.\r\n  I do not know what collapse is in store for me when it is withdrawn.\r\n  I fear I shall need a vigorous tonic to keep up to the high level of\r\n  enjoyment and inspiration which your kind treatment has given me. I\r\n  thank you for this pleasant social enjoyment and this souvenir of it.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, MAY 3.\r\n\r\n_Farewell._\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday evening the President and his party, after passing a restful\r\nday at the Palace Hotel, quietly took their leave of San Francisco and\r\nrepaired to their palatial train. Mayor Sanderson and his secretary,\r\nMr. Steppacher, Col. Charles F. Crocker and Colonel Andrews, of the\r\nReception Committee, escorted the party to their train. The President\r\npersonally thanked these gentlemen for their kind and unremitting\r\nattentions during their visit. Shortly before the train resumed its\r\nlong journey, at a quarter past midnight, the President gave out the\r\nfollowing card of thanks to the people of California:\r\n\r\n  I desire, for myself and for the ladies of our party, to give\r\n  an expression of our thanks for many individual acts of courtesy,\r\n  which, but for the pressure upon our time, would have been specially\r\n  acknowledged. Friends who have been so kind will not, I am sure,\r\n  impute to us any lack of appreciation or intended neglect. The very\r\n  excess of their kindness has made any adequate, and much more, any\r\n  particular, return impossible. You will all believe that there has\r\n  been no purposed neglect of any locality or individual. We leave you\r\n  with all good wishes for the State of California and all her people.\r\n\r\n                                                  BENJ. HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA, MAY 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning, May 4, found the presidential train rolling through\r\nNorthern California. A short stop was made at Tehama, where the\r\nPresident shook hands with the crowd in the rain. Red Bluff, the county\r\nseat of Tehama County, was reached at 8:30 o'clock, and several thousand\r\npeople greeted the President, among them D. D. Dodson and Capt. J. T.\r\nMatlock, the latter an old army friend who served in General Harrison's\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nOn being presented to the assemblage by his former comrade the President\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It is very pleasant to meet here an old comrade of\r\n  the Seventieth Indiana Volunteers. Your fellow citizen, Captain\r\n  Matlock, who has spoken for you, commanded one of the companies of my\r\n  regiment, and is, therefore, a very old and very dear friend. Once\r\n  before in California I had a like surprise. The other day a glee club\r\n  began to sing a song that was familiar to me, and I said to those\r\n  standing about me. \"Why, that song was written by a lieutenant in my\r\n  old regiment, and I have not heard it since the war.\" Presently the\r\n  leader of the glee club turned his face toward me and I found he was\r\n  the identical lieutenant and the composer of the song, singing it\r\n  for my benefit. All along I have met old Indiana acquaintances, and\r\n  I am glad to see them, whether they were of my old command or from\r\n  other regiments of the great war. They all seem to be prosperous and\r\n  happy. Captain Matlock was about the same size during the war that he\r\n  is now. I very well remember, according to his own account, that at\r\n  Resaca he undertook to make a breastwork of some \"down timber,\" but he\r\n  found, after looking about, that it was insufficient cover, and took a\r\n  standing tree. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  Seriously, my friends, you have a most beautiful State, capable of\r\n  promoting the comfort of your citizens in a very high degree, and\r\n  although already occupying a high place in the galaxy of States, it\r\n  will, I am sure, take a much higher one. It is pleasant to see how the\r\n  American spirit prevails among all your people, the love for the flag\r\n  and the Constitution, those settled and permanent things that live\r\n  whether men go or come. They came to us from our fathers and will pass\r\n  down to our children. You are blessed with a genial climate and a most\r\n  productive soil. I see you have in this northern part of California\r\n  what I have seen elsewhere--a well-ordered community, with churches\r\n  and school-houses, which indicates that you are not giving all your\r\n  thoughts to material things, but thinking of those things that qualify\r\n  the soul for the hereafter. We have been treated to another surprise\r\n  this morning in the first shower we have seen in California. I\r\n  congratulate you that it rains here. May all blessings fall upon you,\r\n  like the gentle rain. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREDDING, CALIFORNIA, MAY 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Redding, Shasta County, the distinguished travellers were welcomed\r\nby several hundred school children, marshalled by William Jackson.\r\nMayor Brigman and the members of the City Council, with W. P. England,\r\nL. H. Alexander, B. F. Roberts, Mrs. E. A. Reid, and other prominent\r\nresidents, participated in the reception. Judge C. C. Bush, through\r\nwhose exertions the visit was secured, delivered an address of welcome\r\nand introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is very pleasant, as we near the northern\r\n  line of California, after having traversed the valleys of the\r\n  south, and are soon to leave the State in which we have had so much\r\n  pleasurable intercourse with its people, to see here, as I have seen\r\n  elsewhere, multitudes of contented, prosperous, and happy people. I\r\n  am assured you are here a homogeneous people, all Americans, all by\r\n  birth or by free choice lovers of one flag and one Constitution. It\r\n  seems to me as I look into the faces of these California audiences\r\n  that life must be easier here than it is in the old States. I see\r\n  absolutely no evidences of want. Every one seems to be well nourished.\r\n  Your appearance gives evidence that the family board is well supplied,\r\n  and from the gladness on your faces it is evident that in your social\r\n  relations everything is quiet, orderly, and hopeful. I thank you\r\n  for your friendly demonstrations. I wish it were possible for me to\r\n  do more in exchange for all your great kindness than simply to say\r\n  thank you; but I do profoundly thank you, and shall carry away from\r\n  your State the very happiest impressions and very pleasant memories.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSISSON, CALIFORNIA, MAY 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief stop was made at Dunsmuir, where the President shook hands with\r\nand thanked the people for their greeting, remarking that he was glad\r\nto find that even on the hilltops of California they found something\r\nprofitable to do.\r\n\r\nSisson, at the foot of Mount Shasta, was reached at 3 o'clock; it\r\nwas the last stopping-point in California, and the entire population\r\nturned out in honor of the visitors. The Committee of Reception was Asa\r\nPersons, Hugh B. Andrews, Oliver E. Moors, T. J. Sullivan, Frank B.\r\nMoors, and the veterans of Mount Shasta Post, G. A. R.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, addressing the assemblage, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I have been talking now over a trip of 6,000 miles and\r\n  feel pretty well talked out; but I can always say, as I say to you\r\n  now, that it is ever a very great pleasure to me to see these kindly\r\n  faces turned toward me. We have received in South California, in their\r\n  orange groves, a very hearty welcome, and it is very pleasant to come\r\n  now to this fine scenery among these snow-capped mountains. I have no\r\n  doubt that you find here in this high altitude an inspiration for all\r\n  good things. I thank you again for your cordial greeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASHLAND, OREGON, MAY 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop in Oregon was at Ashland, at 8 P.M., in a drizzling rain.\r\nAn escort committee from the Oregon Legislature and the Portland Board\r\nof Trade, headed by Hon. Joseph Simon, President of the Senate, met the\r\nChief Executive at this point. The local Reception Committee comprised\r\nMayor G. M. Grainger, Hon. J. M. McCall, D. R. Mills, Dr. J. Hall, and\r\nCol. J. T. Bowditch, Judge Advocate General O. N. G.\r\n\r\nResponding to the greeting of the Legislative Committee the President\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Simon and Gentlemen of the Committee_--I esteem it an honor\r\n  that the Legislature of the State of Oregon has taken this notice of\r\n  my visit, and I receive with pleasure this welcome you have extended\r\n  to me. I am very glad to greet you, and it will give me pleasure to\r\n  see you further before leaving the State.\r\n\r\nThe President then appeared on the platform, and was presented to the\r\ncitizens by the Mayor, and spoke briefly, saying:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--This cordial welcome, under the infelicitous\r\n  circumstances, is very gratifying to us as we enter the great State of\r\n  Oregon. In the State of California we had sunshine, and it was perhaps\r\n  to be expected that the favorable weather conditions should draw about\r\n  our platform a large concourse of people, but you have evidenced your\r\n  interest in the Government and the flag and your friendly interest\r\n  in us by turning out on this inclement night to bid us welcome to\r\n  your State. I thank you most sincerely, and wish for you and yours\r\n  all good, and for your State a continued career of development and\r\n  prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDFORD, OREGON, MAY 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's visit to Medford at 10 P.M. was acknowledged by a\r\ngeneral illumination. The veterans of Chester A. Arthur Post, G. A. R.,\r\nJ. R. Erford, Commander, and J. H. Faris, Adjutant, were out _en masse_.\r\nMayor G. W. Howard made a brief address and introduced the President,\r\nwho said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades and Fellow-citizens_--It gives me great pleasure to see\r\n  you to-night, especially these old comrades, to whom I am glad to\r\n  give a comrade's greeting. I would have you think of me as a comrade.\r\n  I recall those army scenes which are fresh in your minds as well as\r\n  mine, the scenes of privation, suffering, and battle, and I am glad to\r\n  see that the old flag you took to the field and brought home in honor\r\n  is still held in honor among you. It is a beautiful emblem of a great\r\n  Government. We ought to teach our children to love it and to regard\r\n  it as a sacred thing, a thing for which men have died and for which\r\n  men will die. It symbolizes the government of the States under one\r\n  Constitution, for while you are all Oregonians as I am an Indianian,\r\n  and each has his pride in State institutions and all that properly\r\n  pertains to our State Government, we have a larger and greater pride\r\n  in the fact that we are citizens of a Nation, of a Union of States,\r\n  having a common Constitution. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It is this flag that represents us on the sea and in foreign\r\n  countries, it is under this flag that our navies sail and our armies\r\n  march. I thank you for this cordial greeting. I hope you have found\r\n  in this State comfortable homes, and that in the years that remain to\r\n  you God will follow you with those blessings which your courage and\r\n  patriotism and sacrifices have so well merited. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALBANY, OREGON, MAY 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party arrived at the thriving city of Albany, in the\r\nWillamette Valley, at 8 o'clock on the morning of the 5th, and were\r\nreceived by 5,000 people. Mayor J. L. Cowan headed the Committee of\r\nReception, consisting of J. W. Cusick, Judge L. Flinn, W. C. Tweedale,\r\nJ. R. Whitney, L. E. Blain, M. Sternberg, G. F. Simpson, Dr. D. M.\r\nJones, A. Hackleman, and Thomas Monteith. McPherson Post, G. A. R.,\r\nJ. F. Whiting, Commander, and Company F, O. N. G., Capt. Geo. E.\r\nChamberlain, together with 200 students from the State Agricultural\r\nCollege at Corvallis, under Prof. J. D. Letcher, participated in the\r\nreception. Mayor Cowan delivered the address of welcome.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison, in response, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It gives me great pleasure to see you, and\r\n  to have the testimony of your presence here this wet morning to the\r\n  interest you take in this little party of strangers who are pausing\r\n  only for a moment with you. We do not need any assurance, as we\r\n  look over an American audience like this, that upon some things,\r\n  at least, we are of one mind. One of these things is that we have a\r\n  Union indissoluble; that we have a flag we all honor, and that shall\r\n  suffer no dishonor from any quarter. While I regret the inclemency of\r\n  the morning, I have been thinking that after all there was a sort of\r\n  instructive moral force in the uncertainty of the weather, which our\r\n  friends in Southern California do not enjoy. How can a boy or young\r\n  woman be well trained in self-denial and resignation who does not\r\n  know what it is to have a picnic or picnic dress spoiled by a shower,\r\n  or some fishing excursion by a storm? I thank you for this welcome.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALEM, OREGON, MAY 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalem, the capital of Oregon, was reached at 9 A.M. The local militia\r\nand several thousand citizens assembled to greet the President,\r\nincluding Governor Pennoyer, Mayor P. H. D'Arcy, Charles Morris, E.\r\nM. Waite, A. N. Gilbert, William Brown, and other prominent citizens;\r\nalso, the Legislative Reception Committee, headed by Hon. Joseph Simon,\r\nPresident of the Senate, and Hon. T. T. Geer, Speaker of the House. _En\r\nroute_ from the depot to the State House thousands of people lined the\r\nsidewalks and several hundred school children, bearing flags, waved\r\na cordial greeting. Arriving at the Assembly Chamber, Mayor D'Arcy\r\npresided and welcomed the President in the name of the city; he was\r\nfollowed by Governor Pennoyer, who extended \"a generous, heartfelt\r\nwelcome on behalf of the people of Oregon.\"\r\n\r\nWith marked earnestness President Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Pennoyer, Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--It is very\r\n  pleasant to be assured by these kindly words which have been spoken\r\n  by the Governor of this State and by the chief officer of this\r\n  municipality that we are welcome to the State of Oregon and to the\r\n  city of Salem. I find here, as I found elsewhere, that these cordial\r\n  words of welcome are repeated with increased emphasis by the kindly\r\n  faces of those who assemble to greet us. I am glad that here as\r\n  elsewhere we look into the faces of happy, prosperous, contented,\r\n  liberty-loving, patriotic American citizens. Our birthright, the\r\n  wise anticipation of those who framed our Government, our national\r\n  and constitutional organization, which has repeated itself in all\r\n  the States of the Union, this wholesome and just division of power\r\n  between the three great independent, co-ordinate branches of the\r\n  Government--the executive, the legislative, and the judicial--has\r\n  already demonstrated that what seems to the nations of Europe to be\r\n  a complicated and jangling system produces in fact the most perfect\r\n  harmony, and the most complete and satisfactory organization for\r\n  social order and for national strength.\r\n\r\n  We stand here to-day in one of these halls set apart to the\r\n  law-making body of your State. Those who assemble here are chosen by\r\n  your suffrages. They come here as representatives to enact into laws\r\n  those views of public questions which have met the sanction of the\r\n  majority of your people, expressed in an orderly and honest way at\r\n  the ballot-box. I hope it may be always found to be true of Oregon\r\n  that your legislative body is a representative body; that coming\r\n  from the people, its service is consecrated to the people, and the\r\n  purpose of its creation is attained by giving to the well-ordered\r\n  and well-disposed the largest liberty, by curbing, by wholesome\r\n  laws, the ill-disposed and the lawless, and providing by economical\r\n  methods for the public needs. The judiciary, that comes next in our\r\n  system, to interpret and apply the public statutes, has been in our\r\n  country a safe refuge for all who are oppressed. It is greatly to our\r\n  credit as a Nation that with rare exceptions those who have worn the\r\n  judicial ermine in the highest tribunals of the country, and notably\r\n  in the Supreme Court of the United States, have continued to retain\r\n  the confidence of the people of the whole country. The duty of the\r\n  Executive is to administer the law; the military power is lodged with\r\n  him under constitutional limitations. He does not frame statutes,\r\n  though in most States, and under our national Government, a veto\r\n  power is lodged in him with a view to secure reconsideration of any\r\n  particular measure.\r\n\r\n  But a public executive officer has one plain duty: it is to enforce\r\n  the law with kindness and forbearance, but with promptness and\r\n  inexorable decision. He may not choose what laws he will enforce any\r\n  more than the citizen may choose what laws he will obey. We have here\r\n  but one king: it is the law, passed by those constitutional methods\r\n  which are necessary to make it binding upon the people, and to that\r\n  king all men must bow. It is my great pleasure to find so generally\r\n  everywhere a disposition to obey the law. I have but one message for\r\n  the North and for the South, for the East and the West, as I journey\r\n  through this land. It is to hold up the law, and to say everywhere\r\n  that every man owes allegiance to it, and that all law-breakers\r\n  must be left to the deliberate and safe judgment of an established\r\n  tribunal. You are justly proud of your great State. Its capabilities\r\n  are enormous; its adaptation to comfortable life is peculiar and fine.\r\n  The years will bring you increased population and increased wealth.\r\n  I hope they will bring with it, marching in this stately progress of\r\n  material things, those finer things--piety, pure homes, and orderly\r\n  communities. But above all this State pride, over all our rejoicings\r\n  in the advantages which are about us in our respective States, we look\r\n  with greater pride to that great arch of government that unites these\r\n  States and makes of them all one great Union. But, my fellow-citizens,\r\n  the difficulties that I see interposed between us and the train which\r\n  is scheduled to depart very soon warn me to bring these remarks\r\n  to a speedy close. I beg again, most profoundly, to thank you for\r\n  this evidence of your respect, this evidence of your love for the\r\n  institutions of our common country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMAWA, OREGON, MAY 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Chemawa, the seat of an Indian training-school, the President\r\nreviewed the pupils and, in response to calls for a speech, addressed\r\nthem as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Young Friends_--It gives me great pleasure to stop for a moment\r\n  to see these evidences of the good work the Government is doing for\r\n  you and the good work you are doing for yourselves. All the purposes\r\n  of the Government toward you and your people are benevolent and\r\n  friendly. It is our wish that you may become such people as your\r\n  neighbors are--industrious, kindly, peaceful, and self-respecting.\r\n  Everything that I can do to promote this end will be gladly done.\r\n  I hope your instructors and all those who are brought close to you\r\n  will in every way express and carry out the benevolent and kindly\r\n  intentions of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON CITY, OREGON, MAY 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cordial greeting was accorded the President at Oregon City by the\r\npioneers and army veterans. The Committee of Reception was Hon. J. T.\r\nApperson, Hon. H. E. Cross, Hon. T. W. Sullivan, and T. Rands. From\r\nbeneath a triumphal floral arch near the station the Mayor delivered a\r\nwelcoming address, closing with three cheers.\r\n\r\nThe President, in response, said:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-citizens_--This is a very pleasant morning reception. The\r\n  heartiness and genuineness of your greeting is unmistakable, and I\r\n  beg to assure you that we most heartily appreciate and return your\r\n  kindly thoughts. You have here a most important State, one of those\r\n  bordering on the Pacific, completing the autonomy of our great\r\n  country, and giving us a seaboard on the Pacific as well as upon the\r\n  Atlantic which was essential to our completeness and separateness as\r\n  a people. The interesting story of the early settlement of Oregon, of\r\n  the international contest which for some time threatened international\r\n  war, is fresh in the minds of these pioneers, and I am sure is taught\r\n  to these children of your public schools. The work of those who set up\r\n  the American flag here, and who secured to us this fertile region, is\r\n  worthy of mention and of honorable commemoration by this generation,\r\n  which is entering into their labors. Your State has added another\r\n  to that succession of kindly greetings which began when we left the\r\n  national capital. We have come out of the land of irrigation and\r\n  roses into this land where the Lord takes care of the crops; and this\r\n  dependence upon the seasons is not without its instructive and moral\r\n  influences. Nature seems to have made a fresh, white toilet for us as\r\n  we have come down the banks of this beautiful river. To the pioneers,\r\n  to those who have entered in with less labor to the inheritance left\r\n  to them, to these children and to these comrades of the Grand Army, I\r\n  give my most hearty greeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTLAND, OREGON, MAY 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday, at noon, found the President and his party at Portland, where\r\nthey received an enthusiastic greeting. Ten thousand people were\r\npresent, notwithstanding the rainy weather. The President was welcomed\r\nat the station by Mayor Van B. De Lashmutt and wife, Chief-Justice R.\r\nS. Strahan, Supreme Judges W. P. Lord and R. S. Bean, Federal Judge M.\r\nP. Deady, Hon. Joseph Simon, President of the Senate; Hon. T. T. Geer,\r\nSpeaker of the House; ex-Atty.-Gen. Geo. H. Williams, Hon. T. F. Osborn,\r\nPresident Chamber of Commerce; Hon. E. B. McElroy, Gen. O. Summers, Gen.\r\nWm. Kapus, Hon. M. C. George, Hon. Henry Failing, Hon. C. A. Dolph, Hon.\r\nP. L. Willis, Hon. F. V. Drake, Hon. G. L. Story, Hon. J. C. Moreland,\r\nHon. J. C. Fullerton, Hon. H. B. Miller, Philip Metschan, and Mrs. Rosa\r\nF. Burrell; also W. F. Matlock, J. H. McClung, and S. B. Eakin, Jr., of\r\nEugene City.\r\n\r\nThe parade was a brilliant affair. The veterans of the several G. A.\r\nR. posts acted as the guard of honor. The great column was directed by\r\nCol. T. M. Anderson, U. S. A., aided by O. F. Paxton, Chief of Staff;\r\nC. M. Idleman, D. S. Tuthill, Dr. Henry E. Jones, J. G. Woodworth, R.\r\nW. Mitchell, F. K. Arnold, L. A. Lewis, E. C. Michenor, C. R. Holcomb,\r\nCharles E. Dodd, J. C. Courtney, J. A. Sladden, John Gwilt, G. A.\r\nHarding, Gen. C. S. Wright, Gen. C. P. Holloway, Col. R. S. Greenleaf,\r\nCol. D. H. Turner, N. S. Pierce, G. E.

E. Dubois, H. P. Wilson, and M. G. Steffen.\r\n\r\nConspicuous in the procession were the following staff officers of the\r\nDepartment of the Columbia: Maj. C. A. Wikoff, Maj. W. H. Nash, Maj.\r\nJ. C. Muhlenberg, Maj. J. G. C. Lee, and Captains C. McClure and C.\r\nH. Ingalls; also Hon. R. P. Earhart, Geo. A. Steel, F. P. Mays, E. T.\r\nHatch, J. T. Stewart, Mayor of East Portland; D. M. McLauchlin, Mayor of\r\nAlbina; A. M. Crawford, of Roseburg, and the French, Russian, and Danish\r\nvice-consuls.\r\n\r\nIn the evening five companies of the First Regiment, O. N. G., commanded\r\nby Col. Charles F. Beebe, escorted the President, Secretary Rusk, and\r\nPostmaster-General Wanamaker to the Exposition Building, where an\r\naudience of 15,000 greeted them. Mayor De Lashmutt delivered an eloquent\r\naddress of welcome.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was tendered an ovation as he arose to respond. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--No more brilliant or inspiring\r\n  scene than this has been presented to our eyes in this wonderful\r\n  series of receptions which have been extended to us on our journey.\r\n  You have been filled with regret to-day that your weeping skies did\r\n  not present to us the fair spectacle which you had hoped; and yet this\r\n  very discouragement has but added to the glory of this magnificent\r\n  reception. [Cheers.] To stand in the bright sunshine of a genial day\r\n  and to wave a welcome is not so strong a proof of the affectionate\r\n  interest of a people as you have given to-day standing in this\r\n  down-pouring rain [Cheers.] In the presence of a multitude like this,\r\n  in a scene made brilliant by these decorations, I stand inadequate to\r\n  any suitable expression of the gratitude that fills my heart. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I was quite inclined to stand by the Superintendent of the Census\r\n  in the count which he made of the States; but I am afraid if I had\r\n  witnessed this scene, pending your application for a recount, that it\r\n  would have been granted. [Laughter and great cheering.] I am sorry\r\n  that it could not have been made as the people turned out to give us\r\n  this welcome; I am sure no one would have been missed. [Laughter and\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n  This State is interesting in its history. The establishment of the\r\n  authority of the United States over this region was an important event\r\n  in our national history. The possession of the Columbia and of Puget\r\n  Sound was essential to the completeness and the roundness of our\r\n  empire. We have here in this belt of States, reaching from the Gulf\r\n  of California to the Straits of Fuca, a magnificent possession which\r\n  we could not have dispensed with at all. [Cheers.] The remoteness\r\n  of Oregon from the older settled States, the peril and privation\r\n  which attended the steps of the pioneer as he came hither, delayed\r\n  the development of this great country. You are now but beginning to\r\n  realize the advantage of closer and easier communications. You are but\r\n  now beginning to receive from an impartial and beneficent Government\r\n  that attention which you well deserve. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  That this river of yours should be made safe and deep, so that\r\n  waiting commerce may come without obstruction to your wharf, is to be\r\n  desired. [Cheers.] It should receive those appropriations which are\r\n  necessary to make the work accomplish the purpose in view. [Cheers.] I\r\n  believe that you may anticipate a largely increased commerce. Looking\r\n  out as you do toward the regions across the Pacific, it would be but\r\n  natural that this important centre should draw from them and exchange\r\n  with them a great and increasing commerce. [Cheers.] I am in entire\r\n  sympathy with the suggestion of the Mayor that it is important that\r\n  this commerce should be carried in American ships. [Cheers.] A few\r\n  days ago, when I sailed in the harbor of San Francisco, I saw three\r\n  great deep water ships come into that port. One carried the flag of\r\n  Hawaii and two the English flag. None bore at the masthead the Stars\r\n  and Stripes. I believe it is the duty of the national Government\r\n  to take such steps as will restore the American merchant marine.\r\n  [Cheers.] Why shall we not have our share in the great commerce of\r\n  the world? I cannot but believe--and such inspiring presences as this\r\n  but kindle and confirm my belief--that we are come to a time when\r\n  this Nation should look to the future and step forward bravely and\r\n  courageously in new lines of enterprise. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  The Nicaragua Canal should be completed. [Cheers.] Our harbors\r\n  should have adequate defence. [Cheers.] We should have upon the sea a\r\n  navy of first-class ships. [Cheers.] We are here in the most kindly\r\n  relations to these South American and Central American countries. We\r\n  have been content that Europe should do the commerce of these nations.\r\n  We have not availed ourselves of the advantages of neighborhood\r\n  and of friendly kindred republican institutions to develop our\r\n  commerce with those people. We have, fortunately, as a result of the\r\n  great conference of American nations, set on foot measures that I\r\n  confidently hope will bring to us speedily our just share of this\r\n  great commerce. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that we are here to-night as American citizens,\r\n  lovers of the one flag and the one Constitution. [Enthusiastic\r\n  cheering.] Proud of Oregon! Yes, you may well be proud of Oregon.\r\n  But, my countrymen, above all, crowning all, greater than all, is our\r\n  American citizenship. [Great cheering.] What would one of these States\r\n  be without the other? What is it that gives us prestige abroad and\r\n  power at home? It is that we have formed a government of the people,\r\n  that we have one flag and speak with one voice to all the nations\r\n  of the earth. [Enthusiastic cheering.] I hope that narrow sentiment\r\n  that regards the authority of the United States or its officers as\r\n  alien or strange has once and forever been extinguished in this land\r\n  of ours. [Great cheering.] My countrymen, I am profoundly grateful\r\n  for this magnificent demonstration. I accept it as a tribute to your\r\n  institutions and to your country. No man is worthy of it; he can\r\n  only return for it a fresh consecration of himself to the duties of\r\n  public office and private citizenship. [Great cheering.] Again I\r\n  assure you that you have given us to-day what is to my mind, under the\r\n  conditions, taking into account the population of your city, the most\r\n  splendid demonstration we have seen on the whole journey. [Prolonged\r\n  and enthusiastic cheering.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the President's address the great assemblage\r\nbegan calling for Postmaster-General Wanamaker. After a few moments'\r\nhesitation the distinguished Philadelphian came forward and was the\r\nrecipient of an ovation. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-countrymen_--I am proud to be present at this magnificent\r\n  demonstration. I am especially pleased at the address the President\r\n  has delivered. Instead of having it printed for Congress he has\r\n  reserved it for the people of Oregon, and personally brought you his\r\n  message. [Cheers.] What you have done to-day has certainly touched\r\n  his heart; and no man would be human who did not feel moved at this\r\n  wonderful welcome that you have prepared for your President. I think\r\n  you had him in mind all the time, and wanted to show that your loyalty\r\n  and affection would wash. [Laughter and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am proud to be an American citizen, and to see how the people\r\n  rally round the flag and the chief standard-bearer, the President of\r\n  the United States. [Cheers.] From the day he started from home his\r\n  pathway has been strewn with garlands, and many times our way has lain\r\n  through a path knee-deep with flowers. They have been scattered all\r\n  the way from Virginia to Oregon; but above all is the hearty, loving,\r\n  loyal welcome that has been extended to us at every stop we have made.\r\n  On the boundary of your State, at the little town of Salem [laughter],\r\n  I think, a welcome was spoken most beautifully and heartily by your\r\n  Governor. [Tremendous cheering.] But you have about 60,000 majority\r\n  over Salem. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  How can any one thank you for it except to go back to Washington and\r\n  do the very best in his power for your good and the good of the whole\r\n  people? Some of us Eastern people are doing now what Columbus did 400\r\n  years ago--we are discovering America. [Cheers.] If what you have done\r\n  for us here to-night and what you have done to-day is a true index to\r\n  your energy and determination, what is there you will not grasp and do\r\n  when you get at it? [Cheers.] I am sure you will find one opportunity\r\n  in aiding in the postal telegraph. We are going to have penny postage\r\n  all the country over. [Cheers.] But before that time comes let us go\r\n  out into the new States as the villages and hamlets build up and let\r\n  us give them the mail with the freest intercourse and the fullest\r\n  facility. I will now make way for the next man, for the largest\r\n  Secretary of all is still to come. [Cheers and laughter.]\r\n\r\nSecretary Rusk also received a hearty welcome. His remarks about the\r\nWeather Bureau had a peculiar zest because of the presence of Gen. A. W.\r\nGreely, chief signal officer. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--It is with great pleasure that I meet you\r\n  here to-night. I would not have a heart if I did not say that I have\r\n  been touched by this demonstration and the demonstration on your\r\n  streets to-day. [Cheers.] I account for this in a different way from\r\n  those who have preceded me. I saw on your streets to-day more ladies\r\n  than I saw in any city which we have visited since we left Washington.\r\n  And the beautiful children! While we have had more flowers in other\r\n  States, we have not met more beautiful women and lovely children. I\r\n  tell you, in order to raise anything sweetly and beautifully you must\r\n  have rain. [Cheers.] Congress has passed a law providing that the\r\n  Weather Bureau be turned over to me July 1, and if I can control the\r\n  weather and another President comes here I will see that you have a\r\n  flood. [Cheers and laughter.] I will endeavor, however, after July 1\r\n  to give you thirteen months' rain every year. I have been touched to\r\n  the heart in many ways since I came to your beautiful city. I have\r\n  met friends who were my boyhood's friends away back in Wisconsin, and\r\n  comrades who served with me in battle and in camp. [Cheers.] I would\r\n  fail to do my duty if I did not say that I am glad to see you all.\r\n  God bless them and may the future deal kindly with you all. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRALIA, WASHINGTON, MAY 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 6th the presidential train crossed the\r\nState line and entered the new State of Washington, stopping a moment\r\nat Chehalis, and reaching Centralia at 7 o'clock. Here the President\r\nwas received with a national salute, and notwithstanding the rain\r\nseveral thousand people were present. Mayor D. B. Rees and the following\r\nprominent residents welcomed the Chief Magistrate: J. H. Corwin, H. J.\r\nMiller, W. H. Bachtall, H. L. Meade, Geo. Miller, E. R. Butherworth,\r\nCharles Johnson, Henry Shield, N. B. Kelsey, A. J. Wright, and Geo. H.\r\nEllsbury.\r\n\r\nThe President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is very kind of you to turn out so early\r\n  in the morning. I can count among my pleasantest experiences in the\r\n  Northwest this very early rising. I am a good deal of a Daniel Webster\r\n  as to early risings. [Laughter.] It gives me great pleasure to notice\r\n  the evidence of increased population as contrasted with what I saw\r\n  six years ago as I passed through this country. I was so unfortunate\r\n  then as to find it enveloped in smoke, so that the mountain tops were\r\n  invisible. I am afraid we are to have this experience repeated on this\r\n  visit on account of the fog. I suppose this is because the beauties\r\n  of your country are so great that they have to be shaded to the eyes\r\n  of a stranger. Seriously, however, you have a great commonwealth.\r\n  I do not doubt that your future is to be one of great development\r\n  and great increase in population, and that you are to found here a\r\n  very contented, prosperous, and happy people. Fortunately you have a\r\n  capacity for great agricultural development after you have cleared\r\n  away the forests; and that, after all, is the permanent foundation\r\n  of every American city. It is well enough to have trees on the land\r\n  and mines in the earth; but trees will be cut down and mines be dug\r\n  out, and the only thing that lasts is good soil in the hands of good\r\n  husbandmen. I thank you most sincerely. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTACOMA, WASHINGTON, MAY 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen thousand cheers greeted the arrival of the President at Tacoma\r\nWednesday morning. Gov. Elisha P. Ferry, Mayor Geo. B. Kandle, and\r\nJudge Wm. H. Calkins, at the head of the following Committee of\r\nReception, met the party: Gen. John W. Sprague, Samuel Collyer, Colonel\r\nGarretson, Judge Allyn, Hon. M. Hill, Mrs. Frank Allyn, W. D. Tyler,\r\nMrs. Derrickson, Thomas Carroll, Dr. Munson, Judge John Beverly, Judge\r\nApplegate, H. C. Wallace, Senator John B. Allen and wife, Mrs. Galusha\r\nParsons, Charles Hale, George Reed, Charles Catlin, S. C. Slaughter,\r\nThomas Sloane, L. E. Post, Nelson Bennett, F. F. Jacobs, I. W. Anderson,\r\nA. C. Mason, C. W. Griggs, G. W. Holmes, E. M. Hunt, John D. Hills, L.\r\nR. Manning, Hon. Thomas Carroll, Col. Charles Reichenbach, Atty.-Gen.\r\nJones, State Treasurer Lindsley, J. D. Hogue, C. B. Zabriskie, and Fred\r\nT. Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe decorations were upon an elaborate scale. Chief among the\r\nattractions of this order were five mammoth arches spanning Pacific\r\nAvenue, constructed from products typifying the principal industries of\r\nthe State, to wit: the timber arch, coal arch, iron arch, grain arch,\r\nand shingle arch. Notwithstanding the rain the parade, under Chief\r\nMarshal C. W. Griggs, was a brilliant success.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy incident was the special reception tendered to Mrs.\r\nHarrison and the other ladies of the presidential party by the ladies of\r\nTacoma at the Opera House. Fully 5,000 paid their respects. Mrs. S. C.\r\nSlaughter, on behalf of the ladies of Tacoma, presented to Mrs. Harrison\r\na beautiful painting of Mt. Tacoma by the artist Rollins. Accompanying\r\nthe picture was an illustrated copy of Mrs. Bernice E. Wewell's poem on\r\n\"Mt. Tacoma,\" also a gold engraved spoon, the latter for the President's\r\ngrandson. In acknowledging the receipt of these souvenirs Mrs. Harrison\r\nmade perhaps her first public speech on the trip. She said:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies_--I cannot thank you enough for all your kindness. I shall\r\n  take your gifts home and treasure them all my life as mementos of a\r\n  most enjoyable visit to your beautiful city. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAfter the review of the procession Governor Ferry, in the presence of\r\nmany thousands, formally welcomed President Harrison to the State of\r\nWashington. The distinguished veteran General Sprague made the address\r\non behalf of the citizens of Tacoma.\r\n\r\nThe President responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I feel that it would be cruel to prolong\r\n  this exposure which you are enduring in the inclement weather of the\r\n  day. I visited your city and the region of Puget Sound six years\r\n  ago. I found this country then enveloped in smoke, so that these\r\n  grand mountain-tops, of which mention has been made in the address\r\n  of welcome, were hidden from our view. I come again and the smoke is\r\n  replaced by fog, and we are still, I suppose, to take the existence of\r\n  these snow-clad peaks on faith. [Laughter and applause.] I don't know\r\n  but there is a benevolent provision for your comfort in the fact that\r\n  this magnificent scenery, this unmatched body of water are frequently\r\n  hidden from the eye of the traveller. If every one who journeys hither\r\n  could see it all everybody would want to live here, and there wouldn't\r\n  be room. [Laughter and cheers.] I congratulate you, citizens of\r\n  Tacoma, upon the magnificent, almost magical, transformation which has\r\n  been wrought here in these six years since I first saw your city. It\r\n  has been amazing: it is a tribute to the energy and the enterprise and\r\n  courage of your people that will endure and increase and attract in a\r\n  yet higher degree the attention of the whole country.\r\n\r\n  A harbor like this, so safe and commodious and deep, upon Puget\r\n  Sound, should be made to bear a commerce that is but yet in its\r\n  infancy. I would like to see the prows of some of these great\r\n  steamship lines entering your ports and carrying the American flag\r\n  at the masthead. [Cheers.] I believe we have come to the time in our\r\n  development as a people when we must step forward with bold progress,\r\n  or we will lose the advantage we have already attained. We have within\r\n  ourselves the resources, and a market of which the world is envious.\r\n  We have been content, in the years gone by, to allow other nations\r\n  to do the carrying trade of the world. We have been content to see\r\n  the markets of these American republics lying south of us mastered\r\n  and controlled by European nations. I think the period of discontent\r\n  with these things has now come to our people, and I believe the time\r\n  is auspicious for the enlargement of our commerce with these friendly\r\n  republics lying to the south of us. I believe the time is propitious\r\n  for re-establishing upon the sea the American merchant marine, that\r\n  shall do its share of the carrying trade of the world. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  My friends, I desire to again express to you my regret that to give\r\n  us this magnificent welcome, under circumstances so inauspicious, you\r\n  have been exposed to so much wet. I especially regretted, as I passed\r\n  those long lines of dear school children, that they should have been\r\n  exposed in order to do us honor. I will not detain you longer. For\r\n  your city, for this magnificent young State that we have received\r\n  into the great sisterhood of the Union, of which you are a glorious\r\n  part, we give our aspirations, our prayers, and our best endeavors.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Steamer \"City of Seattle,\" Puget Sound._\r\n\r\nAt 11:30 A.M. the President and his party left Tacoma, embarking on the\r\nsteamer _City of Seattle_ for the Queen City of the Northwest. There\r\nwas a great outpouring at Tacoma to witness the departure, and the\r\npresidential convoy was escorted down the sound by all the steamers in\r\nthe bay. As the President came aboard he was met by Mayor and Mrs. Harry\r\nWhite at the head of the following committee of prominent citizens of\r\nSeattle: Jacob Furth, John H. McGraw, A. W. Bash, Postmaster Griffith\r\nDavies, A. M. Brookes, A. A. Denny, L. S. J. Hunt, W. E. Bailey, F. J.\r\nGrant, President and Mrs. G. W. Hall, President and Mrs. R. W. Jones,\r\nMaj. J. R. Hayden, Mr. and Mrs. E. Brainerd, Mrs. George H. Heilbron,\r\nMrs. J. C. Haines, Mrs. R. C. Washburn, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Holman, Mrs.\r\nE. L. Terry, Mrs. J. F. McNaught, Mrs. A. B. Stewart, Mrs. James A.\r\nPanting, Mrs. H. F. Jackson and daughter, Mrs. Charles F. Jackson, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. W. R. Bentley, Miss Ina Jameson, Miss Annie Longfellow, Miss\r\nMillie Longfellow, Walter F. Cushing, Col. G. G. Lyon, Dr. Young, D. B.\r\nWard, Colonel Langley, J. T. Ronald, John Wiley, C. M. Ogden, Colonel\r\nStreet, Judge Roger S. Greene, Mr. John Collins, Capt. W. A. Snyder,\r\nex-Atty.-Gen. J. B. Metcalfe, Lieut. A. B. Wyckoff, and Dr. Whyte\r\nFredrick.\r\n\r\nWhen the convoy and her noisy consorts had passed out of Commencement\r\nBay and entered Puget Sound the Reception Committee assembled on deck,\r\nand Mayor White in an address cordially welcomed the President, who, in\r\nresponse, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor_--I accept with great gratification these words of\r\n  welcome on behalf of the citizens of Seattle. It will give me great\r\n  pleasure to contrast my observations of your State in 1885 with what\r\n  I shall see to-day. I have not lost track of the progress of Seattle,\r\n  but have, through friends, been advised of the marvellous development\r\n  which you have made, and how you have repeated in the substantial\r\n  character of your edifices the story of the Chicago fire, coming as\r\n  you have out of what seemed a disaster with increased magnificence,\r\n  and finding in it really an advantage. I will defer until I am in the\r\n  presence of your people any further acknowledgment of your courtesies,\r\n  and will now only thank you, as you are repeating here what we have\r\n  observed on our whole trip, namely, the unification of all our people\r\n  and the absolute oneness of sentiment in devotion to our institutions\r\n  and the flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON, MAY 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steamer bearing the presidential party, followed by a great flotilla\r\nthat had come out to greet them, arrived at Seattle at 1:30 P.M., and\r\nfully 40,000 people witnessed the disembarking. The city was profusely\r\ndecorated. On Pioneer Place stood a triumphal arch bearing the ensigns\r\nof all nations. Ranged at its entrance were the Sons of Veterans in\r\nuniform and 75 school-girls. As the President's carriage entered the\r\ngreat arch the choir-girls greeted him with a song of welcome, composed\r\nfor the occasion by Prof. L. A. Darling. Near the arch, on a platform,\r\nsat the shrivelled form of Angeline, daughter of Chief Seattle, the last\r\nof the race of royal barbarians who once ruled in the bays and forests\r\nof the sound. She was an object of great interest to the President\r\nand his party. After visiting Lake Washington on the cable cars the\r\nPresident was escorted to the University campus by Stevens, Miller, and\r\nCushing posts, G. A. R., M. M. Holmes and J. St. Clair, commanders.\r\nThirty thousand people were assembled on the campus; officials were\r\npresent from every part of the State, also from British Columbia.\r\nOpposite the speakers' stand were 2,000 school children, each waving\r\na flag. Governor Ferry, Senator John B. Allen, Hon. John H. McGraw,\r\nJacob Furth, and numerous other prominent men were on the platform with\r\nthe President, Secretary Rusk, and Mr. Wanamaker. Rev. G. A. Tewksbury\r\npronounced the invocation. Judge Thomas Burke then delivered the\r\nwelcoming address on behalf of the citizens.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Judge Burke and Fellow-citizens_--I am sure you have too much\r\n  kindness in your heart to ask me to make an address to you this\r\n  afternoon. This chilly air, this drizzling rain, the long exposure\r\n  during the day which you and these precious children have suffered,\r\n  warn me, on your account as well as my own, that I should say but a\r\n  few words in recognition of this magnificent welcome. Six years ago\r\n  I visited your beautiful city, and the distinguished gentleman who\r\n  has been your spokesman to-day was one of a hospitable committee that\r\n  pointed out to me the beauties of this location. You were then largely\r\n  a prospective city. Some substantial and promising improvements\r\n  had been begun, but it was a period of expectancy rather than of\r\n  realization. I am glad to come to-day and to see how fully and\r\n  perfectly the large expectations then entertained by your enterprising\r\n  people have been realized. It is a matter of amazement to look upon\r\n  these towering substantial granite and iron structures in which the\r\n  great business of your city is transacted. That disaster, as it seemed\r\n  to you, which swept away a large portion of the business part of your\r\n  city was like the afflictions that come to the saints, a blessing in\r\n  disguise. [Cheers.] You have done what Chicago did. You have improved\r\n  the disaster by rearing structures and completing edifices that were\r\n  unthought of before. Those who were not enterprising or liberal have\r\n  been compelled to be liberal and enterprising in order that they might\r\n  realize rents for their property made vacant by fire. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I fully appreciate the importance of this great body of water upon\r\n  which your city is situated. This sound, this inland sea, must be in\r\n  the future the highway, the _entrepot_, of a great commerce. I do most\r\n  sincerely believe that we are entering now upon a new development\r\n  that will put the American flag upon the seas and bring to our ports\r\n  in American bottoms a largely increased share of the commerce of\r\n  the world. [Cheers.] As I have said in other places, for one I am\r\n  thoroughly discontented with the present condition of things. We\r\n  may differ as to methods, but I believe the great patriotic heart\r\n  of our people is stirred, and that they are bent upon recovering\r\n  that share of the world's commerce which we once happily enjoyed.\r\n  Your demonstration to day under these unfavorable environments has\r\n  been most creditable to your city. We have certainly seen nothing\r\n  in a journey characterized by great demonstrations to surpass this\r\n  magnificent scene. [Cheers.] I realize what your spokesman has said,\r\n  that in all this there is a patriotic expression of the love of our\r\n  people for the flag and for the Constitution. [Cheers.] And now, my\r\n  friends, thanking you for all you have done for me, humbly confessing\r\n  my inability to repay you, pledging to you my best efforts to\r\n  promote the good of all our people, and that I will have a watchful\r\n  observation of the needs of your State, of your harbors, for defence,\r\n  improvement, and security, I bid you good by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAfter the President's address an effort was made to present the veterans\r\nindividually, but the inclement weather forbade it. Turning to those\r\nabout him President Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  I leave you very reluctantly, and I shall always be sorry that\r\n  my time was so limited here that I could not do justice to your\r\n  hospitality. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nAt 5 o'clock the party boarded their train, but a great crowd had\r\nassembled and called repeatedly for the President, who responded and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n  I can only thank you once more; you have given me a royal welcome,\r\n  and I carry away with me the most grateful memory of your kindness.\r\n  I was up until past midnight last night, making a speech, and had\r\n  to be up at 6 o'clock this morning to speak to some friends in\r\n  Oregon. I leave you with the best wishes for your city and the State.\r\n  [Enthusiastic cheers.]\r\n\r\nAs the President concluded there were loud calls for Postmaster-General\r\nWanamaker, who waved his hand toward the children and said:\r\n\r\n  The reasons given by the President for not making a speech certainly\r\n  apply to those who are in your programme to follow him. I cannot,\r\n  however, leave the platform without thanking you for that share of the\r\n  welcome that falls to us who attended. There is a chill in the air,\r\n  but there is no lack of warmth in the cordial greeting that you have\r\n  given to us who, though we felt ourselves to be strangers among you,\r\n  have found ourselves to be among friends. I have been trying to find\r\n  out since the census report was announced what the reason was that\r\n  Philadelphia had fallen behind. [Laughter and applause.] It is all\r\n  very plain to me now. This city set on a hill I shall put down in my\r\n  book as Philadelphia Junior. [Applause.] You have the family likeness.\r\n  I recognize some of you by name, and I do not wonder that you have\r\n  settled in this beautiful spot, so rich in its resources, where you\r\n  discovered everything that we have in Pennsylvania except one thing,\r\n  and I expect you will find that before long, and I am sure that I hope\r\n  that you will find the anthracite coal stored away somewhere in your\r\n  hills. I know if you undertake to find it you will do it. [Applause.]\r\n  You need no better illustration than the choir over yonder, that\r\n  could not be stopped even to allow the President to speak. [Applause\r\n  and laughter.] I shall carry away from here a story that I am afraid\r\n  they will call a California story, but I will get your Mayor to give\r\n  me a certificate that I was perfectly sober--that there was nothing\r\n  but water. [Applause and laughter.] And I shall try to recommend\r\n  what I have seen in this wild West, where people have their splendid\r\n  schools, their many churches, their refined homes, and where there is\r\n  such a hearty welcome for all that come in their midst. For my part\r\n  of the work at Washington I have already given you evidence that the\r\n  Post-office Department was thinking of the Pacific coast. I shall\r\n  do the best that I can as a business man for this splendid business\r\n  people that you have in your city and for the many more that are to\r\n  come; that all the facilities of the mail--quickening it, increasing\r\n  it--shall be given to you; that you shall not say that your Government\r\n  does not give you all the assistance in building up your great\r\n  enterprises and swelling the prosperity of all this coast. I say\r\n  good-by to you and give you a heart full of good wishes. [Continued\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUYALLUP, WASHINGTON, MAY 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was 10 P.M. when the train stopped at Puyallup, where a goodly crowd\r\nawaited the visitors. The President shook hands with several score, and\r\nin response to calls for a speech said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I am very glad to see you to-night, but I am\r\n  sure you will excuse me from speaking when you remember that I have\r\n  been out in the rain all day at Tacoma and Seattle, and have had to\r\n  talk several times. I am glad to see you, and appreciate the friendly\r\n  interest you manifest in coming out here to-night in such great\r\n  numbers to greet us with such kindliness. I have known for a long time\r\n  of the great hop industry of this region, and I am glad to know that\r\n  it has proven profitable. The question of the Puyallup reservation was\r\n  one of the last which was brought officially to my attention before\r\n  leaving, and I expect it will be one of the first I shall take up on\r\n  my return. Good-night and good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEHALIS, WASHINGTON, MAY 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great crowd greeted the President with cannon and bonfires on his\r\narrival at Chehalis at 10:30 at night. The Committee of Reception\r\nconsisted of Mayor Milet, who delivered an address of welcome; Judge\r\nAshman, an old comrade of the President's at Resaca; and J. F. Sachs, an\r\nearly pioneer, who presented the President a native hawthorn cane.\r\n\r\nResponding to greetings the President said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very much obliged to you for this midnight\r\n  reception. We passed you this morning without stopping, and regretted\r\n  it when we saw the number who had collected here. We gladly yielded\r\n  to your request to stop to-night in order to show our appreciation of\r\n  your kindness. It is very pleasant for me to see those people who have\r\n  no interest in politics except for good government. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASCADE LOCKS, OREGON, MAY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop on the morning of the 7th was at Cascade Locks, where\r\nseveral hundred people gave an early morning greeting to the President,\r\nwho responded briefly, saying:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very much obliged to you for your kindly\r\n  greeting, and, as we stop only a few moments, I can only express my\r\n  sincere thanks for your presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOD RIVER STATION, OREGON, MAY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Hood River Station the President shook hands with a number and\r\naddressed the gathering as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It is very pleasant to see you this morning, and to\r\n  come out into the sunshine after two or three days of chilly rain. I\r\n  have been talking so much, and so much in the dampness, that my voice\r\n  is not very good; but my heart is always fresh and open to these\r\n  receptions. I thank you very sincerely for your friendliness and wish\r\n  for you all, and especially for these little ones, every happiness in\r\n  life. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DALLES, OREGON, MAY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the famous gorge of the Columbia River the presidential\r\ntrain at 11 o'clock emerged within view of the city of The Dalles, where\r\nan enthusiastic welcome was extended the Chief Executive. The Committee\r\nof Reception consisted of Mayor Moody, D. M. French, Dr. William\r\nShackelford, J. A. Varney, R. F. Gibson, Robert Mays, H. M. Beall, John\r\nMcCaul, J. P. McInerry, M. T. Nolan, George Ruch, and the following\r\nprominent ladies of the city: Mrs. T. S. Lang, Mrs. N. B. Sinnott,\r\nMrs. A. M. Williams, Mrs E. M. Wilson, Mrs. S. French, Mrs. S. Brooks,\r\nMrs. Geo. Liebe, Mrs. Charles Hilton, and Mrs. J. Patterson. Many old\r\nsoldiers and a large number of school children were present.\r\n\r\nMayor Moody, in behalf of the city, welcomed the President, who\r\nresponded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I have spoken at all times of the night and all\r\n  hours of the day, and under conditions much less auspicious than\r\n  those around us this morning. We have here a bright sunshine and a\r\n  bracing air, and everything in nature adds to the gladness of this\r\n  demonstration which you have made in our honor. I most sincerely thank\r\n  you for this evidence of your friendliness. I assure you that it is\r\n  very pleasant, and I cannot but believe that it is very useful for\r\n  those who are charged with public duties at Washington occasionally to\r\n  move about a little and look into the faces of the plain, patriotic\r\n  people of the country. Most of the people who come to see me at\r\n  Washington want something, and as the provision made by law is not\r\n  adequate to meet all these wants there is very apt to be a great\r\n  deal of discontent; but when we get out among the great masses of\r\n  the people, among those who are doing the work of the farm, of the\r\n  shop, and of the office, who have a patriotic pride in their country\r\n  and its institutions, and are kindly disposed, charitable in their\r\n  judgments, and who have no other interests than that the laws shall be\r\n  faithfully executed and the whole interest of the people faithfully\r\n  looked after, we find great refreshment in their presence. I am sure\r\n  we have such an audience here this morning. You will not expect of any\r\n  officer that he will altogether avoid mistakes; you have a right to\r\n  expect a conscientious, courageous fidelity to public duty. I quite\r\n  sympathize with the suggestion of your Mayor, that it is one of the\r\n  proper Government functions to improve and to open to safe navigation\r\n  the great waterways of our country. The Government of the United\r\n  States has reserved to itself the exclusive control of all navigable\r\n  inland waters, and that being so, it is, of course, incumbent upon\r\n  the Government to see that the people have the best possible use of\r\n  them. They are important, as they furnish cheap transportation, and\r\n  touch points that are often, either for economy or natural reasons,\r\n  inaccessible to railway traffic. I thank you again for your interest\r\n  and bid you a kindly farewell. If no ill happens to you that I do not\r\n  wish, and all the good comes to you that I do wish in your behalf,\r\n  your lives will be full of pleasantness and peace. [Enthusiastic\r\n  cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENDLETON, OREGON, MAY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving The Dalles the presidential party encountered a sand\r\nstorm. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon they arrived at the beautiful\r\ncity of Pendleton and were greeted by a large crowd, including several\r\nhundred Umatilla Indians, led by Chiefs Peo and Ten-a-ow-itz. Chief Peo\r\nmade an address and said:\r\n\r\n  I am glad to greet the great father. Indian and white man are now\r\n  one family, friendly, and I give you the hand of welcome for my\r\n  people. You represent one race, I another, but we are all of one\r\n  Government, and between red man and white there should no longer be\r\n  war. My people want only peace. In behalf of my tribe I say welcome,\r\n  President.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Reception comprised Mayor J. H. Raley, Judge J. A.\r\nFee, J. M. Leezer, Senator Matlock, Capt. A. L. Ewing, T. C. Taylor, W.\r\nD. Fletcher, S. Rothchild, T. F. Rourke, R. Alexander, Lot Livermore,\r\nBenj. S. Burroughs, H. L. Marston, T. G. Hailey, W. D. Hansford, F. W.\r\nVincent, Mrs. M. B. Clopton, Mrs. T. C. Taylor, and Mesdames Fee, De\r\nSpain, and Fletcher. Mayor Raley made an address of welcome.\r\n\r\nThe President replied:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--Among all the surprises that have greeted us\r\n  on our journey I do not remember any that burst upon us with more\r\n  suddenness than this beautiful sight that you have arranged for our\r\n  welcome here. Travelling for some hours through a sparsely settled\r\n  region, I did not at all anticipate that so large an assemblage could\r\n  be gathered here. I am glad to read in your faces a full confirmation\r\n  of the Mayor's words of welcome. You have a pride in the common\r\n  heritage of Government which our fathers organized for us. You honor\r\n  the flag which floats about us here. It is pleasant to meet here,\r\n  scattered over these plains of the West, so many veterans of the great\r\n  Civil War, men who came out of the army poor as they went into it,\r\n  men who did not serve their country for reward, but out of a loving\r\n  fealty to its flag and to their Government; men who asked no questions\r\n  about pay, but went with loyal hearts to battle, determined that the\r\n  flag should be maintained in its supremacy from sea to sea; men who,\r\n  returning safely from the vicissitudes of the camp and the march and\r\n  from the perils of battle, have been ever since giving their brave\r\n  endeavors to open this new country, to increase its prosperity, and\r\n  by honorable labor to make comfortable homes for themselves and their\r\n  children. I greet you to-day, comrades, with a loving heart. God grant\r\n  that these later days--for years are increasing with us all--may be\r\n  full of sunshine, full of the respect of your neighbors, full of\r\n  prosperity, and crowned at last with the full blessing of immortality.\r\n\r\n  To these little ones now enjoying the beneficent provisions which\r\n  your State has made for their care and education I give the most\r\n  affectionate greeting. The children of this land are the light and\r\n  the life of our households. They are in the family what the blossoms\r\n  are in the orchard and garden. May they appreciate the blessings they\r\n  enjoy, and when they come to mature years and take up the unfinished\r\n  labors of their fathers, may they hold aloft the flag which their\r\n  fathers followed to battle and maintain all those things that conduce\r\n  to decent and orderly communities and to the purity of the home. To\r\n  these pioneers who have under discouragements and great difficulties\r\n  sought these Western homes and opened the way for civilization I give\r\n  my greeting, and to all I give the assurance that these distant States\r\n  are not forgotten by us who are, for the time, chosen to administer\r\n  public office at Washington. We take you all into our consideration,\r\n  our confidence, and our affection. I believe there is a great\r\n  community of interest that touches all our States. I believe that our\r\n  legislation should be as broad as our territory, should not be for\r\n  classes, but should be always in the interest of all our people. And\r\n  now, thanking you for this most interesting and cordial welcome, I bid\r\n  you good-by. [Cheers].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLE GRANDE, OREGON, MAY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President had an enthusiastic reception at Le Grande from several\r\nthousand residents. The city was beautifully illuminated in honor of\r\nthe visit. The Committee of Reception consisted of Hon. J. H. Slater,\r\nE. S. McComas, M. F. Honan, and R. E. Bryan. Mayor C. H. Finn made the\r\nwelcoming address.\r\n\r\nThe President responded:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is very gratifying to see this vast\r\n  assembly here to-night, and I regret that our arrival was not in\r\n  the daylight, that we might have a better view of this city and its\r\n  surroundings, as well as of these prosperous and happy people who are\r\n  assembled here to-night. We have travelled many thousands of miles\r\n  on this journey, and it has been one continued succession of happy\r\n  greetings. We have passed through the land of flowers, and they have\r\n  strewn our pathway with them. We have come now to this north land\r\n  where the flowers are not so abundant, but where the welcome and\r\n  heartiness of the people is quite as manifest and quite as sincere.\r\n  I rejoice to have had the opportunity to see portions of the State\r\n  of Oregon which I had not previously visited. Your industries and\r\n  products are so varied that working together, supplying the wants of\r\n  different communities by the productions of each, it must be that you\r\n  shall grow in population, and that the rewards of your labor shall be\r\n  full and rich. But above all these material things in which you show\r\n  the country the resources of your people, I rejoice that social order,\r\n  education, good morals, and all those things that tend to promote\r\n  the human happiness, the peace of your communities, and the glory of\r\n  your State, are also here thought of and promoted. [Cheers.] We are\r\n  citizens of one great country, and I do not believe there is a nation\r\n  in the world where there is a more perfect unification of heart and\r\n  purpose than in the United States of America. I do not believe there\r\n  is anywhere any people more earnestly in love with their institutions\r\n  and with the flag that symbolizes them, more in love with peace and\r\n  peaceful industries, and yet stronger in their defence of the truth\r\n  and of the right. [Cheers.] I beg again to thank your citizens of this\r\n  city and of the surrounding country for this gracious and hospitable\r\n  welcome. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKER CITY, OREGON, MAY 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing event of the long day was the reception at Baker City\r\nat 11:30 P.M. Fifteen hundred people were present and the town was\r\nilluminated. The Reception Committee was Mayor S. B. McCord, Hon. R. S.\r\nAnderson, and Geo. H. Tracy. Joe Hooker Post, G. A. R., Fred K. Ernst,\r\nCommander, was present.\r\n\r\nResponding to Mr. Anderson's welcoming address President Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--It is very pleasing, so late at\r\n  night, to be greeted on our arrival here by this large audience and\r\n  by these hearty cheers. We thank you very sincerely for this evidence\r\n  of your friendly interest, and beg to assure you in return that not\r\n  only as public officers, but as citizens with you of this great\r\n  country, we are in hearty sympathy with all your pursuits and plans\r\n  and hopes in this distant State. I have heard before of its beauty\r\n  and the fertility and productiveness of its wheat fields and of the\r\n  rich mines which are found in this vicinity. Situated as you are, the\r\n  great question with you must be one of transportation, one of getting\r\n  the products of your field, the surplus of your agricultural products,\r\n  to a market. I hope you appreciate all the advantages in this regard\r\n  which the development of these Pacific cities is giving. Every great\r\n  manufacturing establishment that is built there produces and increases\r\n  population, and makes additional and nearer market for the products\r\n  of your fields. I hope the day is not far distant when the completion\r\n  of the Nicaragua Canal will make a shorter way to the Atlantic\r\n  seaboard States and much shorter and cheaper communication with a\r\n  European market. I am glad to be assured--indeed, I do not need the\r\n  assurance--that here in Oregon, as in the Central and Eastern States,\r\n  we are one people, loyal and united in the love for the flag which\r\n  some of these comrades aided to be victorious in the great war, and\r\n  that you are thoroughly in love with our American institutions. I am\r\n  glad to assure you that, so far as I am concerned, I know no sections\r\n  in this country. I desire to promote those measures which shall always\r\n  be for the interests of all classes, and which shall diffuse the\r\n  benefits of our institutions equally and fairly among all the States\r\n  and among all our people. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOISE CITY, IDAHO, MAY 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoise City, the capital of Idaho, was reached at 7 o'clock the morning\r\nof the 8th, where a stop of two hours was made. The following committee\r\nof distinguished officials and citizens received the President: His\r\nExcellency Gov. N. B. Willey and official staff, comprising Col. E. J.\r\nCurtis, Col. J. A. Torrance, Lieutenant-Colonel Casswell, and Maj. Geo.\r\nF. Hinton; Senator Geo. L. Shoup, Hon. James A. Pinney, Mayor of Boise\r\nCity; R. Z. Johnson, President Board of Trade; John Lemp, Charles A.\r\nClark, E. R. Leonard, C. W. Moore, J. W. Daniels, Calvin Cobb, A. J.\r\nGlorieaux, Nathan Falk, Peter Sonna, A. R. Andola, J. H. Richards, Hon.\r\nS. W. Moody, Capt. C. C. Stevenson, and Capt. D. W. Figgins.\r\n\r\nThe President was escorted to the Capitol grounds by Phil. Sheridan\r\nPost, G. A. R., D. F. Baker Commander, A. C. Bellus, Senior\r\nVice-Commander, N. F. Kimball, Junior Vice-Commander. The parade was in\r\ncharge of Maj. H. E. Noyes, of the Fourth Cavalry, and was one of the\r\nmost creditable demonstrations witnessed on the trip. The local militia\r\nand more than 1,000 school children participated. Every veteran and\r\neach scholar carried a flag, which elicited from President Harrison a\r\nbeautiful tribute to the national symbol.\r\n\r\nAfter the review Governor Willey and Mayor Pinney formally welcomed the\r\nPresident, who responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--This is instructive and inspiring to us all as\r\n  American citizens. It is my great pleasure to stand for a little while\r\n  this morning in the political Capitol of this fresh and new State.\r\n  I had great satisfaction in taking an official part in admitting\r\n  Idaho to the Union of States. I believed that it was possessed of a\r\n  population and resources and capable of a development that fairly\r\n  entitled her to take her place among the States of the American Union.\r\n  You are starting now upon a career of development which I hope and\r\n  believe will be uninterrupted. Your great mineral resources, now being\r\n  rapidly developed, have already brought you great wealth. Undoubtedly\r\n  these are to continue to be a source of enrichment and prosperity to\r\n  your State, but I do not forget that we must look at last for that\r\n  paramount and enduring prosperity and increase which our States should\r\n  have to a development of their agricultural resources. You will, of\r\n  course, as you have done, carefully guard and secure your political\r\n  institutions. You will organize them upon a basis of economy, and yet\r\n  of liberal progress. You will take care that only so much revenue\r\n  is taken from the people as is necessary to the proper public\r\n  expenditure. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to see that this banner of liberty, this flag of our\r\n  fathers, this flag that these--my comrades here present--defended\r\n  with honor and brought home with victory from the bloody strife of\r\n  the Civil War, is held in honor and estimation among you. [Great\r\n  applause.] Every man should take off his hat when the starry flag\r\n  moves by. It symbolizes a free republic; it symbolizes a Nation; not\r\n  an aggregation of States, but one compact, solid Government in all\r\n  its relations to the nations of the earth. [Applause.] Let us always\r\n  hold it in honor. I am glad to see that it floats not only over your\r\n  political Capitol, but over the school-houses of your State; the\r\n  children should be taught in the primary schools to know its story\r\n  and to love it. To these young children, entering by the beneficent\r\n  and early provision of your State into the advantages of that great\r\n  characteristic American institution--the common school--I give my\r\n  greeting this morning. May every good attend them in life, and as the\r\n  cares of life come on to take the place of the joys of childhood, God\r\n  grant that, instructed in mind and heart in those things that are high\r\n  and good, they may bear with honor the responsibility which you will\r\n  soon lay down.\r\n\r\n  To these comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic, survivors\r\n  of the great war, upon whom the years are making their impression,\r\n  I do not doubt that these who stand by me have borne an honorable\r\n  part among your fellow-citizens in the development of the resources\r\n  of this, their adopted State. Not long will we tarry; but, my\r\n  comrades, the story of what you have done is undying, and I doubt\r\n  not this morning that the satisfaction of having had some small part\r\n  in redeeming this Nation and preserving its integrity will fill\r\n  your hearts with gladness, even under adverse conditions of life.\r\n  A grateful Nation honors you. Every community should give you its\r\n  respect, and I can only add to-day a comrade's greeting and a hearty\r\n  God bless you all! [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOCATELLO, IDAHO, MAY 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great crowd, including several hundred Indians, greeted the\r\nPresident's arrival at Pocatello the night of the 8th. The Committee of\r\nReception consisted of Frederick K. Walker, A. B. Bean, A. F. Caldwell,\r\nJohn S. Baker, O. L. Cleveland, R. J. Hayes, E. C. Hasey, George Dash,\r\nFrank Ramsey, J. J. Guheen, H. G. Guynn, and L. A. West. A large\r\ndelegation from Blackfoot was represented on the committee by Hon. F. W.\r\nBeane, Col. J. W. Jones, and F. W. Vogler.\r\n\r\nChairman Savidge of the committee delivered the welcoming address and\r\nintroduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-citizens_--In 1881, that sad summer when General Garfield\r\n  lay so long in agony and the people suffered so long in painful\r\n  suspense, I passed up the Utah and Northern Narrow Gauge Railroad\r\n  through this place--if it was a place then--to Montana on a visit.\r\n  The country through which we have passed is therefore not unfamiliar\r\n  to me. I have known of its natural conditions, and I have seen\r\n  its capabilities when brought under the stimulating influence of\r\n  irrigation. I have had, during my term in the Senate, as Chairman of\r\n  the Committee on Territories of that body, to give a good deal of\r\n  attention to the condition and needs of our Territories. My sympathy\r\n  and interest have always gone out to those who, leaving the settled\r\n  and populous parts of our country, have pushed the frontiers of\r\n  civilization farther and farther to the westward until they have met\r\n  the Pacific Ocean and the setting sun. Pioneers have always been\r\n  enterprising people. If they had not been they would have remained at\r\n  home; they endured great hardships and perils in opening these great\r\n  mines of minerals which show in your State, and in bringing into\r\n  subjection these wild plains and making them blossom like gardens.\r\n  To all such here I would do honor, and you should do honor, for they\r\n  were heroes in the struggle for the subjugation of an untamed country\r\n  to the uses of man. I am glad to see that you have here so many happy\r\n  and prosperous people. I rejoice at the increase of your population,\r\n  and am glad to notice that with this development in population and in\r\n  material wealth you are giving attention to those social virtues--to\r\n  education and those influences which sanctify the home, make social\r\n  order secure, and honor and glorify the institutions of our common\r\n  country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad, not only for the sake of the white man, but of the red\r\n  man, that these two extensive and useless reservations are being\r\n  reduced by allotment to the Indians for farms, which they are expected\r\n  to cultivate and thereby to earn their own living [cheers], that the\r\n  unneeded lands shall furnish homes for those who need homes. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now, fellow-citizens, extending to such comrades of the Grand\r\n  Army of the Republic as I see scattered about through this audience my\r\n  most cordial greeting as a comrade, to these children and these ladies\r\n  who share with you the privations of early life on the frontier, and\r\n  to all my most cordial greeting and most sincere thanks for your\r\n  kindly demonstration, I will bid you good-by. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT LAKE CITY, UTAH, MAY 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Pocatello the President was met by a committee representing the\r\ncitizens of Ogden, Utah, who took this opportunity to pay their\r\nrespects, it being impracticable to hold a reception in that city owing\r\nto the late hour the train passed. The Ogden committee consisted of\r\nMayor W. H. Turner and wife, Hon. James A. Miner, E. M. Allison and\r\nwife, J. R. Elliott, W. N. Shilling and wife, Capt. Ransford Smith, Wm.\r\nH. Smith, M. N. Graves and wife, Col. A. C. Howard, Rev. A. J. Bailey,\r\nE. M. Correl and wife, Thomas Bell, J. Cortez and wife, W. W. Funge\r\nand wife, O. E. Hill and wife, John N. Boyle, Gilbert Belnap and wife,\r\nJoseph Belnap, J. S. Painter, Maj. R. H. Whipple, W. R. White, and Prof.\r\nT. B. Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed by Governor Thomas to meet and welcome the\r\nPresident at the State line on behalf of the Territory of Utah consisted\r\nof Hon. E. P. Ferry, of Park City; H.

Varian,\r\nColonel Godfrey, John E. Dooly, Heber M. Wells, E. C. Coffin, and\r\nSpencer Clawson.\r\n\r\nThe presidential party arrived at the \"City of Zion\" at 2:45 A.M. At\r\n8 o'clock they were met by Governor Thomas and Mayor Geo. M. Scott at\r\nthe head of the following Citizens' Committee of Reception: Secretary\r\nSells, Irving A.

Toronto, and Mesdames Zane, Salisbury,\r\nDooly, Blunt, Chambers, Goodwin, James, Anderson, Lawrence, Gaylord,\r\nSimon, and Bartch; Miss Robertson, Mrs. I. A. Benton, and Mrs. Hobbs.\r\nThis committee and a large body of citizens escorted the party to the\r\nWalker House, where breakfast was served. The President then headed a\r\nprocession, composed of U.S. troops, State guards, G. A. R. veterans,\r\npioneers, and many other local organizations, and was escorted to a\r\npavilion in Liberty Park.\r\n\r\nGovernor Thomas and Mayor Scott delivered welcoming addresses, to which\r\nPresident Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Fellow-citizens_--The scenes which have been presented to us in\r\n  this political and commercial metropolis of the Territory of Utah have\r\n  been very full of beauty and full of hope. I have not seen in all this\r\n  long journey, accompanied as it has been with every manifestation of\r\n  welcome and crowned with flowers, anything that touched my heart more\r\n  than that beautiful picture on one of your streets this morning when\r\n  the children from the free public schools of Salt Lake City, waving\r\n  the one banner that we all love [cheers] and singing an anthem of\r\n  praise to that beneficent Providence that led our worthy forefathers\r\n  to land and has followed the pathway of this Nation with His\r\n  beneficent care until this bright hour, gave us their glad welcome.\r\n  [Applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  My service in public life has been such as to call my special\r\n  attention to, and to enlist my special interest in, the people of\r\n  the Territories. It has been a pleasant duty to welcome the Dakotas,\r\n  Washington, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming into the great sisterhood of\r\n  the States. I think it has not fallen to any President of the United\r\n  States to receive into the Union so large a number of States. The\r\n  conditions that surround you in this Territory are of the most hopeful\r\n  character. The diversity of your productions, your mines of gold and\r\n  silver, iron, lead and coal, placed in such proximity as to make the\r\n  work of mining and reduction easy and economical; your well-watered\r\n  valley, capable, under the skilful touch of the husbandman, of\r\n  transformation from barren wastes into fruitful fields--all these\r\n  lying in easy reach and intercommunication, one with the other, must\r\n  make the elements of a great commercial and political community. You\r\n  do not need to doubt the future. You will step forward confidently and\r\n  progressively in the development of your great material wealth.\r\n\r\n  The great characteristic of our American institutions--the compact\r\n  of our Government--is that the will of the majority, expressed by\r\n  legal methods at the ballot box, shall be the supreme law of all\r\n  our community. To the Territories of the United States a measure of\r\n  local government has always been given, but the supervisory control,\r\n  the supreme legislative and executive power has been, continuously,\r\n  as to the Territories, held and exercised by the general Government\r\n  at Washington. The territorial state has always been regarded as a\r\n  temporary one. The general Government has always looked forward to a\r\n  division of its vast domain--first, the territory northwest of the\r\n  Ohio, then the Louisiana purchase, then these accessions upon the\r\n  Pacific coast--into suitable sections for the establishment of free\r\n  and independent States. This great work of creating States has gone\r\n  forward from the Ohio to the Pacific, and now we may journey from\r\n  Maine to Puget Sound through established States. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  The purity of the ballot-box, the wise provisions and careful\r\n  guardianship that shall always make the expression of the will of the\r\n  people fair, pure and true, is the essential thing in American life.\r\n  We are a people organized upon principles of liberty, but, my good\r\n  countrymen, it is not license. It is liberty within and under the law.\r\n  [Great applause.] I have no discord, as a public officer, with men of\r\n  any creed or politics if they will obey the law. My oath of office, my\r\n  public duty, requires me to be against those who violate the law.\r\n\r\n  The foundation of American life is the American home. That which\r\n  distinguishes us from other nations whose political experience and\r\n  history have been full of strife and discord is the American home,\r\n  where one wife sits in single uncrowned glory. [Great applause and\r\n  cheers.] And now, my countrymen, I beg to assure you that every hope\r\n  you have for safe running on these lines of free government, on these\r\n  lines of domestic and social order, I have. For every one of you I\r\n  have the most cordial greeting. God bless and keep you and guide you\r\n  in the paths of social purity, order, and peace, and make you one of\r\n  the great communities of the American Union. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chamber of Commerce Speech._\r\n\r\nThe visitors were then taken to the new Chamber of Commerce, where the\r\nbusiness men of the city greeted the Chief Executive. The occasion was\r\nalso the formal opening of the building for business.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison made an address. He said:\r\n\r\n  I am very glad to witness in this magnificent structure which\r\n  you are opening to-day for your use an evidence of the commercial\r\n  importance of the city. Organizations of this character are very\r\n  useful when rightly conducted, very promotive of the business\r\n  prosperity of the cities in which they are established, and of the\r\n  best interest of their membership. It is quite right that those who\r\n  may be engaged in the rivalries of business, pushing their several\r\n  lines of trade with the energy and enterprise that characterize our\r\n  people, should now and then assemble and lay aside things that are\r\n  personal and selfish and consider the things that affect the whole\r\n  community. These organizations, as I have known them in other States,\r\n  have been the council chamber in which large and liberal things have\r\n  been devised for the development of the interests and prosperity of\r\n  the community. I do not doubt that you will do so here; that new\r\n  enterprise will be welcomed, and that the friendly business hand\r\n  will be extended to those who are seeking investments. I wish you\r\n  all success in this enterprise, and I hope you may grow until its\r\n  membership shall embrace all of your commercial classes, and that\r\n  its influence may do for your business here what the water of your\r\n  mountain streams has done for the plains--make them grow longer and\r\n  more productive, and at the same time expel from them those mean\r\n  jealousies which sometimes divide men. [Prolonged Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Address to the School Children._\r\n\r\nThe party visited the Mormon Tabernacle, which was profusely decorated\r\nwith bunting and flags. On the side of the Temple in large letters\r\nwas the motto \"Fear God; Honor the President.\" The entire city was\r\ntastefully decorated. The President reviewed the school children, about\r\n2,000 in number. They rendered patriotic songs, and he addressed them in\r\nthe following happy speech:\r\n\r\n  _To the School Children_--In all this joyous journey through\r\n  this land of flowers and the sunny South I have seen nothing more\r\n  beautiful and inspiring than this scene which burst upon us so\r\n  unexpectedly. This multitude of children bearing waving banners\r\n  makes a scene which can never fade from our memories. Here, in these\r\n  children from the free schools established and guarded by your public\r\n  authorities, is the hope of Utah and the country. [Cheers.] I give you\r\n  my thanks for a demonstration that has cheered my heart. May each of\r\n  you enjoy every blessing that a free country and a more beneficent and\r\n  kindly Creator can bestow. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEHI CITY, UTAH, MAY 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop after leaving the capital of Utah was at Lehi City, where\r\na large sugar factory is located. The Committee of Reception consisted\r\nof Mayor A. J. Evans, Bishop T. R. Cutler, James Harwood, and C. A.\r\nGranger.\r\n\r\nThe President made a brief address, saying:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--This industry which you have established here is very\r\n  interesting to me. I hope it is to open the way to a time when we\r\n  shall have a home supply of sugar for every household. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVO CITY, UTAH, MAY 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential train arrived at Provo--the Garden City of Utah--at\r\n1:30 P.M. The greeting was a cordial one; about 1,000 school children\r\nwere present. The Reception Committee was Mayor J. E. Booth, R. H. Dodd,\r\nJ. R. Bishop, J. B. McCauslin, M. M. Kellogg, W. S. Myton, E. A. Wilson,\r\nWm. H. King, D. D. Houtz, Dr. J. N. Christensen, Dr. H. Simmons, F. F.\r\nReed, G. W. Olger, and W. Burlew.\r\n\r\nMayor Booth introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--This is another of those bright\r\n  and beautiful pictures that have been spread before our eyes on this\r\n  whole journey from Washington. I am glad to stop for a moment in this\r\n  enterprising and prosperous city. I am glad to know that you are\r\n  adding manufacturing to your agriculture, and that you are weaving\r\n  some of the abundance of wool that is furnished by your flocks. It is\r\n  the perfection of society, commercially, when you find immediately\r\n  at your own doors a market for those things that you have to sell.\r\n  You are a long way from the seaboard. The transportation companies,\r\n  however fair their rates may be, must levy very heavy tolls upon your\r\n  produce for taking it to the Atlantic or to the Pacific. It is then\r\n  a pleasing thing when, instead of sending your wool to some distant\r\n  city to be woven into cloth, you can do that work yourselves as you\r\n  develop, bringing in these manufacturing industries whose employees\r\n  consume the products of your farm and in turn give to the farmer that\r\n  which he and his children have to wear. You are approaching the most\r\n  independent commercial condition. When every farmer is able to sell\r\n  from his own wagon everything he produces and is emancipated from\r\n  transportation tolls, he is independent and prosperous.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to see these dear children here coming from the free\r\n  schools of your city. The public school is a most wholesome and\r\n  hopeful institution. It has an assimilative power possessed by no\r\n  other institution in our country. Where the children of rich and poor\r\n  mingle together on the play-ground and in the school-room, there is\r\n  produced a unity of feeling and a popular love for public institutions\r\n  that can be brought about in no other way. [Cheers.] God bless and\r\n  promote your public schools until every child in your Territory shall\r\n  be gathered into them. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FORK, UTAH, MAY 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon a brief stop was made at American Fork, where\r\nseveral hundred children were marshalled under Bishop George Halliday\r\n(Mormon) and Rev. F. G. Webster. The Reception Committee consisted of\r\nMayor George Cunningham, James Chipman, John J. Cushing, and John F.\r\nPribyl.\r\n\r\nThe President, addressing the school children, said:\r\n\r\n  I want to express my interest in these dear children who have\r\n  gathered here. It is very pleasant to have at all these little\r\n  stations these expressions of your good-will. I rejoice to see the\r\n  development which has taken place in these regions since I was here a\r\n  few years ago, and I have no doubt that it will go on until all your\r\n  valleys are prosperous and full of happy homes. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGVILLE, UTAH, MAY 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the presidential train reached Castle Gate, a mining town on the\r\nsummit of the Wahsatch Mountains, the people turned out _en masse_. A\r\nsalute was fired with dynamite cartridges. The President briefly thanked\r\nthe people for their greeting.\r\n\r\nAt Springville, the last stopping-point in Utah, the committee that\r\nwelcomed the President consisted of Don C. Johnson, Joseph M. Westwood,\r\nH. M. Dougall, R. A. Deal, and Anthony Ethier.\r\n\r\nGovernor Thomas introduced President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--Your towns in Utah are very close together. I scarcely\r\n  close an address at one before we are in the corporate limits of\r\n  another; but I am glad to receive here this pleasant welcome. The\r\n  evidence of kindliness which I read in all your faces is very\r\n  reassuring and very comforting. It is delightful, I think, to those\r\n  who are charged with public duties to come now and then and look\r\n  into the faces of the people who have no other interest than that\r\n  the Government shall be well administered. [Cheers.] I cannot hope,\r\n  of course, to give a post office to everybody. I have endeavored in\r\n  the selection of those who are to administer the functions of public\r\n  office for the general Government to secure good men. I have desired\r\n  that everywhere they should understand that they were the servants of\r\n  the people [applause], that they were to give the best public service\r\n  possible, and that they were to treat everybody alike.\r\n\r\n  It has been very pleasant to-day to ride through this most\r\n  extraordinary valley, and to notice how productive your fields are and\r\n  how genial and kindly your people are. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am to do whatever I can in public office to serve our people.\r\n  I am glad to contribute whatever I can as a citizen to the general\r\n  prosperity and to the glory and dignity of our country. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now one word or two to these few comrades who gather about me.\r\n  They are not many, but they are entitled to honor. Those who struggled\r\n  in the early years to establish homes in the West, and those who in\r\n  the hour of public distress and peril bared their breasts to the\r\n  shaft of battle that the Nation might live, are worthy of the highest\r\n  regard. [Cheers.] You have entered into the heritage which they\r\n  bought and preserved. May you, with as true, loyal hearts as they,\r\n  preserve and hand down to your children these institutions. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLENWOOD SPRINGS, COLORADO, MAY 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt an early hour Sunday morning, May 10, the presidential party arrived\r\nat Glenwood Springs, where they were met by the Governor of Colorado,\r\nHon. J. L. Routt, Chief-Justice J. C. Helm, Hon. N. P. Hill, ex-Senator\r\nH. A. W. Tabor, and Congressman Townsend, from Denver. At 8 o'clock\r\nthe Hon. J. L. Hodges, Mayor of the city, with Judge G. D. Thayer,\r\nL. Schwarz, C. W. Darrow, J. H. Fesler, F. Mager, and M. W. Mather,\r\nescorted the party to the Hotel Glenwood, where they passed the day. The\r\nPresident and Postmaster-General Wanamaker attended divine services at\r\nthe Presbyterian Church. The pastor, Rev. W. S. Rudolph, was assisted by\r\nRev. A. E. Armstrong, of Leadville, and Rev. L. N. Haskell, of Denver,\r\nChaplain of the State Senate. The city was filled with thousands of\r\nvisitors from Aspen and other neighboring mining towns and camps until\r\nover 10,000 people were gathered--notwithstanding it was the Sabbath--to\r\ngreet the Chief Magistrate of the Nation.\r\n\r\nWhen the President returned from witnessing several members of his party\r\nenjoy a dip in the mammoth pool he was met by Mayor Hodges at the head\r\nof the following Reception Committee of prominent citizens: Joseph Love,\r\nA. W. Dennis, Reed Burritt, F. C. Ewing, F. S. Dart, F. C. Sohram, H.\r\nC. Eaton, J. R. De Remer, Alex. Anderson, A. W. Dennis, Miles Standish,\r\nJ. L. Hays, W. H. Hallett, H. R. Kamm, J. T.

Stevenson, C. B. Brown, M. N. Edwards, and Harry Van Sickle.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor made the welcoming address and presented the President with a\r\nsolid silver plate, superbly engraved with the coat-of-arms of Colorado.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison replied:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--In arranging the programme of this\r\n  trip, and desiring to find one day in the seven for rest, we selected\r\n  this spot because of its fame throughout the East as one of delightful\r\n  location and natural attractions. I am glad this selection was made.\r\n  It has given me much pleasure--the beauty of your surroundings\r\n  and especially the picturesque attractiveness and magnificence of\r\n  the scenery. The city which you are launching forth upon the tide\r\n  of usefulness and prosperity will grow in fame. I thank you most\r\n  cordially for this souvenir, and I leave with you my most earnest hope\r\n  for the prosperity of the city.\r\n\r\nSenator Tabor introduced a delegation from Aspen representing 1,000\r\nminers from that famous camp. Col. E. F. Browne then presented a most\r\nunique souvenir--a silver card bearing mottoes worked in native wire\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nIn accepting this rare token the President said:\r\n\r\n  This is one of the most beautiful of all the souvenirs that have\r\n  been presented me on this trip. I wish to say to you that I do not\r\n  regard your visit as an intrusion. I will not undertake to dilate upon\r\n  the fatigue of this trip. I have been leaning over the hind rail of\r\n  the train for a long time, and I came to Glenwood Springs tired. I\r\n  wish to remain quiet, not from any puritanical notion of the Sabbath,\r\n  and I hope none of you will feel that way. It is not because I don't\r\n  want to see you. It is the contrary, I assure you, and I regret my\r\n  inability to give you all a public reception.\r\n\r\n  I have for Aspen and her people the kindest wishes. As for the State\r\n  of Colorado, it will grow more vigorous and richer in all that makes\r\n  an American commonwealth.\r\n\r\n  In common with Western States, Colorado has had the pick of the\r\n  people of the Eastern States. It seems to me as though her citizens\r\n  had passed competitive examination for push and enterprise, and only\r\n  the worthless were turned back at the ferry. I thank you for your\r\n  liberality.\r\n\r\nCharles R. Bell, of Aspen, State President Patriotic Order Sons of\r\nAmerica, presented the President with an address. In the afternoon\r\nPresident Harrison and Mr. Wanamaker attended union services and\r\nchildren's mass-meeting at Durand's Hall. Rev. H. M. Law presided, but\r\nMayor Hodges introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, Fellow-citizens and Children_--Our stop at Glenwood\r\n  Springs was, as you all know, intended to be for rest; and yet I\r\n  have not felt that I could deny myself to this large body of friends\r\n  assembled from the homes of this city, and, perhaps, to an even larger\r\n  body of friends who have come from some of the neighboring towns to\r\n  pay their respects and testify their good-will. The trip we have\r\n  been making has been a prolonged one, and it has been a continued\r\n  experience of speech-making and hand-shaking. The physical labor has\r\n  been very great, and I think if one had been called upon to do the\r\n  same amount of work without the stimulus and inspiration which have\r\n  come from the happy faces and kind hearts of the people who have\r\n  greeted us, almost any man would have given out. Certainly I would had\r\n  I not been borne up and helped by the wonderful kindness of our people.\r\n\r\n  I have been intensely interested in what I have seen. It has\r\n  testified to me of the unity of the people East and West. Out here\r\n  you take on some peculiarities as we do in Indiana, but underneath\r\n  these peculiarities there is the same true American grit and spirit.\r\n  [Applause.] It is not wonderful that this should be so. It is not a\r\n  mere likeness between different people, because you are precisely\r\n  the same people that I have known in the Central and Eastern States.\r\n  Everywhere I have gone I have seen Hoosiers; everywhere Mr. Wanamaker\r\n  has gone he has seen Pennsylvanians; everywhere General Rusk has gone\r\n  Wisconsin hands have been reached up to him. These new States have\r\n  been filled up by the enterprising and pushing young men of the older\r\n  States. They have set out to find here greater advantages, more rapid\r\n  pathways to wealth and competence. Many of them have found it, many of\r\n  them are still perhaps in the hard struggle of life; but to you all,\r\n  to every man, whether he is mine-owner or handles the pick, I bring\r\n  you my warmest sympathy and my most sincere thanks for your friendly\r\n  greeting. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Our Government was instituted by wise men--men of broad views. It\r\n  was based upon the idea of the equal rights of men. It absolutely\r\n  rejects the idea of class distinction and insists that men should\r\n  be judged by their behavior. That is a good rule; those who are\r\n  law-abiding and well-disposed, those who pursue their vocations\r\n  lawfully and with due respect to the rights of others, are the true\r\n  American citizens. I am glad to know that the love of our institutions\r\n  is so deeply imbedded in your hearts. It has been a most delightful\r\n  and cheering thing to see that the starry banner, the same old flag\r\n  that some of you carried amid the smoke of battle, the rattle of\r\n  musketry, booming of cannon, and the dying of men, is in the hands of\r\n  such children. [Applause.] Some of the prettiest as well as some of\r\n  the most hopeful sights we have looked upon have been these companies\r\n  of children gathered on the streets or hill-sides waving this banner.\r\n\r\n  The American institutions deserve our watchful care. All our\r\n  communities should be careful in the beginning to establish law and\r\n  maintain it. It is very difficult when lawlessness once obtains the\r\n  upper hand to put it down. It is very easy to keep it out of any\r\n  community if the well-disposed, true-hearted people will sink all\r\n  their differences, religious and political, and stand together as\r\n  citizens for the good of their municipalities. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I want to thank the children who have gathered for this\r\n  Sabbath-day's observance. I have had a life that has been full of\r\n  labor. From my early manhood until this hour my time has had many\r\n  demands upon it. I have been under the pressure of the practice of\r\n  my profession. I have been under the pressure of political campaigns\r\n  and of public office, and yet in all these pursuits, and under all\r\n  these conditions, I have found, simply as a physical question, without\r\n  reference to its religious aspects at all, that I could do more by\r\n  working six days than seven.\r\n\r\n  I think you will all find it so, and that as a civil institution\r\n  rest on the Sabbath day is good for man. It is not only good, but it\r\n  is the right of the workingman. Men should have one free day in which\r\n  to think of their families, of themselves, of things that are not\r\n  material, but are spiritual. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I desire to express from a sincere and earnest heart my thanks to\r\n  you all for all your kindness, giving you in return simply the pledge\r\n  that I will in all things keep in mind what seems to me to be the true\r\n  interests of our people. I have no thought of sections, I have no\r\n  thought upon any of the great public questions that does not embrace\r\n  the rights and interests of all our people and all our States. I\r\n  believe we shall find a common interest and safe ground upon all the\r\n  great questions, and by moderating our own views and making reasonable\r\n  and just concessions we shall find them all settled wisely and in the\r\n  true interest of the people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEADVILLE, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeadville, the Cloud City, was reached at 7:30 A.M. Monday. Ten thousand\r\ncitizens greeted the Chief Magistrate at this greatest of silver camps.\r\nThe following delegation met the presidential party at Glenwood and\r\nescorted them to Leadville: His Honor Mayor John E. Foutz, Hon. H. I.\r\nHiggins, W. Arens, John Harvey, A. Sherwin, A. V. Hunter, S. F. Maltby,\r\nJohn Ewing, John Williams, W. F. Patrick, H. C. Burnett, Rev. A. E.\r\nArmstrong, Mrs. Foutz, Mrs. Hunter, Mrs. Morgan H. Williams, and Mrs.\r\nE. Forbes. The ladies of this committee presented Mrs. Harrison with\r\nnumerous beautiful silver souvenirs.\r\n\r\nChairman Higgins and the following members of the Reception Committee\r\nescorted the party to the Hotel Kitchen: Mrs. W. F. Patrick, W. W. Old,\r\nMrs. J. Y. Oliver, A. A. Blow, Mrs. H. W. Hardinge, Charles Cavender,\r\nRev. E. S. Ralston, B. S. Buell, Samuel Brown, A. Sherwin, Robert Estey,\r\nH. R. Pendery, Charles L. Hill, J. S. Jones, Robert Cary, Geo. W.\r\nTrimble, C. P. Schumacher, J. S. Saunders, John Harvey, J. H. Weddle,\r\nJohn Nowland, W. F. Patrick, Hon. Wm. Kellogg, Frank G. White, John\r\nF. Champion, James Smith, Moses Londoner, J. J. M. McRobbie, Maj. A.\r\nV. Bohn, and John Lumsden. The veterans of Garfield Post, G. A. R.,\r\ncomposed the guard of honor. Judge Luther M. Goddard made the welcoming\r\naddress, and in the name of the city presented the distinguished visitor\r\na silver brick.\r\n\r\nThe President responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--This rare, pure atmosphere, this\r\n  bright sunshine, the national colors, this multitude of lifted,\r\n  smiling faces to greet us is a scene that should raise the dullest\r\n  heart to emotions of thankfulness and pride--pride wholly separated\r\n  from personal considerations, a pride in which everything personal\r\n  is swallowed up by the contemplation that all this is the outcome,\r\n  the manifestation, the culmination of free American institutions.\r\n  [Cheers.] We stand here on this mountain-top and see what I think\r\n  is the highest evidence of American pluck to be found in the United\r\n  States. [Laughter and applause.] I have addressed my fellow-citizens\r\n  on many thousands of occasions, but never before stood so near\r\n  the dome. [Cheers.] It is a wonderful testimony to the energy and\r\n  adaptation of the American that he should have pushed his way to this\r\n  high altitude, above the snow-line, and erected here these magnificent\r\n  and extensive industries and these beautiful and happy homes. I\r\n  rejoice with you in all that has been accomplished here.\r\n\r\n  I bring thanks to you for that great contribution you have made to\r\n  the wealth of a country we all love. [Cheers.] I bring to you the\r\n  assurance that as an individual citizen and as a public officer my\r\n  interest, my affection, and my duty embrace all the people of this\r\n  land. [Cries of \"Good!\" and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know we have in the past history of our country found\r\n  that happy unity of interest which has acted beneficially upon all\r\n  our institutions and all our people. With due regard to all local\r\n  interests, we should seek that general legislation which touches with\r\n  kindly fingers the humblest homes in our land. I do most sincerely\r\n  thank you for this token of the product of your mines. It is a\r\n  precious metal, but much more precious to me is the kindly thought and\r\n  the generous welcome which you have given us in Leadville. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  My lungs are unaccustomed to this rare and stimulating atmosphere,\r\n  and you will permit me to close by giving you all, to the men who,\r\n  deep down in these mines, are toilsomely working out the precious\r\n  metal, to those who welcome you in your homes when you return from\r\n  your toil, the wives and children who add grace and sweetness to our\r\n  lives, to these children who have gathered to greet us, a most cordial\r\n  salutation and a regretful good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUENA VISTA, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuena Vista gave the President a cordial greeting. The Committee of\r\nReception included Mayor Mason, Hon. A. R. Kenedy, Capt. A. V. P. Day,\r\nA. H. Wade, Col. Henry Logan, J. C. Stuart, and A. C. Bottorff. Phil.\r\nSheridan Post, G. A. R., Col. G. D. Childs Commander, participated in\r\nthe reception. Dr. Struthers and W. W. Fay presented the President with\r\nthree fine trout caught in Thompson's Lake, and weighing six pounds each.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very glad to see your bright and kind faces this\r\n  morning, and to tarry for a few moments, just long enough to say \"How\r\n  do you do?\" and \"Good-by.\" It is very pleasant to find everywhere\r\n  and at every station the same friendly looks and the same kindly\r\n  greeting. I am glad to have an opportunity that I have not previously\r\n  had of seeing the State of Colorado, great in her present condition\r\n  and having a greater future development than perhaps you yourselves\r\n  realize. This combination of agricultural and mining industries can\r\n  work but good for the high development of Colorado. Your cattle and\r\n  your sheep and your mines and your agriculture in your valleys all\r\n  produce that ideal condition of things in which you find a nearer\r\n  market for what you raise. I hope the time will come when in addition\r\n  to smelting furnaces in your mines you will learn to weave the\r\n  wool from your sheep in place of sending it abroad to be made into\r\n  clothing. The more you can develop these things and do your own work\r\n  the more prosperous will be your condition. These dear children have\r\n  cheered me heartily all the way on this journey. The public schools\r\n  are worthy of your most thoughtful care. It is there that the children\r\n  meet on a common ground. It is there class distinctions are wiped out.\r\n  It is the great American institution. You have well named your little\r\n  hamlet Buena Vista. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALIDA, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree thousand people from the surrounding district welcomed the\r\nPresident at Salida. The Reception Committee consisted of Mayor John G.\r\nHollenbeck, J. H. Stead, S. M. Jackson, W. W. Roller, J. A. Israel, E.\r\nB. Jones, and W. P. Harbottle. Stanton Post, G. A. R., W. G. Westfall\r\nCommander, and the children of the public schools were present. Miss\r\nClara Ayers, on behalf of the public schools, presented Mrs. Harrison\r\nwith a handsome portfolio of Colorado wild flowers prepared by Mrs.\r\nE. P. Chester. Dr. Durbin, on behalf of the citizens of Villa Grove,\r\npresented a fine collection of mineral specimens.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have looked with great interest, in passing through these\r\n  mountain gorges, at the enterprise of the people who have constructed\r\n  intersecting lines of railroad upon these difficult grades and\r\n  through threatening cañons. It has not been many days since such\r\n  feats of engineering would have been regarded as impossible, and yet\r\n  now railroads have touched the highest points, have gone above the\r\n  snow line, have reached elevated mines, and brought isolated valleys\r\n  into rapid and easy communication with the more settled parts of the\r\n  country. It has given me great pleasure to look upon the beautiful\r\n  valley in which the town of Salida is situated, and which will\r\n  undoubtedly be capable of large agricultural production when a system\r\n  of irrigation is completed. It might be desirable to the people of\r\n  Indiana and Illinois and other agricultural States if Colorado had\r\n  to buy her wheat and corn from them, but our larger interest makes\r\n  it desirable that every community should supply its own wants. I\r\n  anticipate with pleasure the day when these mountain States will\r\n  not be content with mining, but shall add agricultural pursuits and\r\n  manufacturing, and when the wool which is sheared from the flocks will\r\n  be woven at home. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It is a pleasant condition of things when all classes are\r\n  prosperous, when the workingman has fair wages that leave him some\r\n  margin above his daily necessities. I should lose hope for our\r\n  institutions when there should be despairing classes among us. An\r\n  American citizen could not be a good citizen who did not have hope in\r\n  his heart. Every boy, however humble, can pass through our public\r\n  schools and climb to any position of usefulness and honor he has\r\n  the ability to attain. There have been marvellous instances of what\r\n  courage and pluck and intelligence may do in this way.\r\n\r\n  To the children I give a cordial greeting. They have been a happy\r\n  feature of almost every gathering in the journey. I hope they may\r\n  all receive that attention which will make them men and women of\r\n  intelligence, and capable of taking a full share in all these good\r\n  things in the community and in the State, for which they are to be\r\n  responsible. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAÑON CITY, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Salida the route lay through a stretch of country unsurpassed\r\nin grandeur. The train made a short stop on the hanging bridge over the\r\nArkansas River in the Grand Cañon. Emerging through the Royal Gorge\r\nthe party reached Cañon City at 2 P.M. amid the cheers of its entire\r\npopulation, including 400 school children. Mayor J. M. Bradbury, T. M.\r\nHarding, A. D. Cooper, and Warden W. A. Smith were among the prominent\r\nresidents who welcomed the President; also, Greenwood Post, G. A. R.,\r\nDr. J. L. Prentiss, Commander.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades and Fellow-citizens_--It gives me great pleasure to see\r\n  you and accept with a thankful heart those cordial greetings with\r\n  which you have met us. I have been talking so much since I left\r\n  Washington that I really am almost talked out; and yet, until I shall\r\n  have altogether lost my voice, of which there does not seem to be any\r\n  prospect, I cannot refrain from saying thank you to those friends who\r\n  greet us with such affectionate interest. We do appreciate it very\r\n  highly. But I do not at all assume it is merely your interest in me.\r\n  It is, I am sure, your interest in the country, in its Constitution,\r\n  and in its flag--the flag for which these comrades fought, which they\r\n  carried through the stress of battle and brought home in honor. It is\r\n  our free institutions, our free ballot, our representative Government,\r\n  that you all honor in coming here to-day. It is very surprising and\r\n  very pleasant to drop down out of these snow-clad summits and to have\r\n  passed into our hands in the valley, branches of peach and pear and\r\n  bouquets of flowers, the first fruits of spring--a spring more genial\r\n  here than it seemed at Leadville this morning. [Applause.] I am very\r\n  glad to have revealed to me the possibilities of this country, and to\r\n  see how, under the system of irrigation, that which seemed to be a\r\n  waste--accursed of God--comes to be a very garden of Eden in beauty\r\n  and productiveness. I hope you have not only the fruits and flowers\r\n  of paradise, but that you have in your homes that state of peace and\r\n  blessedness which prevailed before our first mother took the apple.\r\n  [Applause.] To these comrades I want to give a comrade's greeting. I\r\n  know of no higher honor in this world than to be called \"comrade\" by\r\n  the survivors of those who saved the Union, [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORENCE, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next stop was at Florence, in the oil district, whose citizens gave\r\nthe President a most cordial greeting. The Reception Committee comprised\r\nMayor Isaac Canfield, Senator J. A. McCandless, J. F. Collins, J. H.\r\nMcDaniel, Thomas Robinson, Thomas E. Spencer, Richard McDonald, W. J.\r\nDaniels, and Joseph Patterson. An enthusiastic citizen proposed three\r\ncheers \"for the first President who has thought enough of us to come and\r\nsee us.\" They were given with a will, and the President responded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow citizens_--I am very much obliged to you for this\r\n  greeting. I expect there have been other Presidents who thought\r\n  of you, though they have not visited you. This has been a very\r\n  pleasant and instructive journey to me. I thought I had kept myself\r\n  reasonably well informed of the capabilities of this country and of\r\n  its productions, but I am amazed to find how things are put together.\r\n  We come out of the snow where everything is barren and where labor\r\n  is under ground, where the precious metals are being extracted, and\r\n  there is nothing pleasant in the landscape except the snow covered\r\n  mountains, and presently we are into a land of fruit, and have handed\r\n  up to us great branches laden with well-set peach and pear, and are\r\n  showered again, as we were in California, with the flowers of the\r\n  early spring, and now, to my surprise, we seem to be in the oil\r\n  region of Pennsylvania. These numerous derricks and oil lodes remind\r\n  us of things about Oil City. Until I saw them I was not aware that\r\n  you had here in Colorado oil production. It shows us how impartial,\r\n  after all, the great Creator has been. He has given us everywhere\r\n  possibilities which, if well improved, will make comfortable, happy\r\n  homes. You have the metals, precious and common, and the coal that\r\n  is needed for the smelter; oil to light your homes and lubricate\r\n  your machinery, and these orchards and beautiful valleys, all in the\r\n  right proximity. No man could have improved upon it. [Applause.] Our\r\n  Government intends to have a careful and impartial consideration of\r\n  all its people. We do not recognize classes or distinctions. We want\r\n  everybody to be prosperous and happy, especially the working people.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I do not know how our institutions could endure unless we so\r\n  conduct our public affairs and society that every man who is sober\r\n  and industrious shall be able to make a good, comfortable living and\r\n  lay something aside for old age or for evil days; to have hope in his\r\n  heart and better prospects for his children. That is the strength\r\n  of American institutions. Whatever promotes that I want to favor.\r\n  Whatever tends to pauperize our people or impair the earning power of\r\n  the laboring class I do not favor. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUEBLO, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn artillery salute welcomed the party to Pueblo at 3:30 P.M. Mayor W.\r\nB. Hamilton, Col. M. H. Fitch, D. W. Barkley, Hon. I. W. Stanton, A.\r\nMcClelland, and O. H. P. Baxter comprised the committee that escorted\r\nthe President from Glenwood Springs. Arrived at the station the Chief\r\nExecutive was conveyed to the Court House Square by the following\r\nCommittee of Reception: E. C. Lyman, Paul Wilson, Benjamin Guggenheim,\r\nD. L. Holden, E. R. Chew, Fred Betts, N. O. McClees, W. A. Moses, F.\r\nE. Baldwin, A. S. Dwight, J. R. Flickenger, R. M. Stevenson, W. B.\r\nMcKinney, John Lockin, E. C. Billings, A. F. Ely, W. B. Palmer, J. S.\r\nJohnston, N. E. Guyot, M. Studzinski, G. T. Nash, J. W. Purdy, P. F.\r\nSharp, S. A. Abbey, E. H. Martin, N. S. Walpole, T. J. Cribbs, J. G.\r\nKeller, and C. C. Gaines. Upton Post, G. A. R., C. J. Long Commander,\r\nand many other organizations participated in the parade.\r\n\r\nAt the Court House Square 6,000 children greeted the President, who was\r\nintroduced by Dr. William A. Olmsted and said:\r\n\r\n  _Children of the Public Schools and Others_--I am glad to meet\r\n  such an immense number here, and I can't allow this opportunity\r\n  to pass without expressing to you my thanks for this whole-souled\r\n  reception. It moves my heart to say that from your appearances you are\r\n  well taught, not only in manners but in your intellectual pursuits;\r\n  your bright, ruddy faces show health, and as you are living in this\r\n  healthful place it speaks marvels for Pueblo. The country need fear\r\n  no attack from foreign foes when such an army as you'll some day make\r\n  would be called into action. You have your destiny all before you, and\r\n  no one can tell but that some of these boys may be a President and\r\n  these beautiful girls advise those who are born to fill high places\r\n  in the Government. Children, I am pleased to see you, and will hold\r\n  in dear remembrance this, my first visit to Pueblo--a city full of\r\n  American genius and enterprise, which will hold its own and keep on\r\n  apace with that progress characteristic of Americans. God bless you\r\n  all. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Harrison's carriage drew up the school children presented her\r\nwith a handsome painting--the \"Colorado Columbine.\" The President then\r\nvisited the Colorado Mineral Palace, where President L. S. McLain and\r\nSecretary Livezey of the Exposition presented him with specimens of rich\r\nore.\r\n\r\nColonel Stanton made the welcoming address and introduced President\r\nHarrison to the great assemblage, who responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--The brief time which we are able\r\n  in this hasty journey to allot to the city of Pueblo has now almost\r\n  expired. It has given me pleasure to drive through the streets of\r\n  this prosperous and enterprising municipality and to see that you\r\n  are concentrating great business interests which must in the future\r\n  make you a very important centre in this great State. You have in\r\n  this State a variety of resources unexcelled, I think, by any other\r\n  State. Your attention was very naturally first directed toward the\r\n  precious metals, to the mining of gold and silver. The commoner ores\r\n  were neglected. Your cities were mining camps. Nowhere in all our\r\n  history has the American capacity for civil organization been so\r\n  perfectly demonstrated as in the mining camps of the West. Coming\r\n  here entirely beyond the range of civil institutions, where courts,\r\n  sheriffs, and police officers could not give a hand to suppress the\r\n  unruly at a time when our mining laws were unframed, these pioneer\r\n  miners of California, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, and Idaho wrought out\r\n  for themselves in their mining camps a system of government and mining\r\n  laws that have received the approval of the State. [Cheers.] It was\r\n  quite natural that interest should have been first directed toward the\r\n  precious metals. You are coming to realize that the baser metals, as\r\n  we call them, with which your great hills are stored are of great and\r\n  more lasting value. [Cheers.] We passed this morning through a region\r\n  where I was surprised to see orchards that reminded me of California.\r\n  Now for all these things, for the beneficent influence under which you\r\n  live, for that good law that has distributed this public domain freely\r\n  to every man who desires to make a home for himself and family, for\r\n  this free Government that extends its protection over the humblest as\r\n  well as the mighty, for all these resources of sky and air and earth,\r\n  the people of Colorado should be joyously thankful. [Cheers.] I am\r\n  glad to hail you as fellow-citizens. I am glad for a moment to stand\r\n  in the midst of you, to see your great capabilities, and to assure\r\n  you that my best wishes are with you in the development of them all.\r\n  [Cheers] I am glad to know that Colorado, this young Centennial State,\r\n  has established a system of free public schools unexcelled by any\r\n  State in the Union [Cheers.] But, my friends, as I said once before, I\r\n  am in slavery to a railroad schedule, and time is up Good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO, MAY 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential party arrived at Colorado Springs at 6 o'clock in the\r\nevening and received the heartiest kind of a welcome. They were met at\r\nthe station by the Hon. Ira G. Sprague, Mayor of the city, at the head\r\nof a large Committee of Reception, comprising the following prominent\r\ncitizens: Judge John Campbell, J. F. Seldomridge, J. H.

M. Carrington.\r\n\r\nThe G. A. R. veterans comprised the presidential guard of honor during\r\nthe parade through the city. Civic organizations from Manitou, Colorado\r\nCity, Colfax, and Koener participated in the demonstration, which was\r\nvery fine and received the special commendation of President Harrison.\r\n\r\nAfter the parade the Garfield School was visited, and the President\r\naddressed the scholars as follows:\r\n\r\n  You have very appropriately named this school in which you\r\n  have gathered a portion of the children of Colorado Springs for\r\n  instruction--Garfield. I understand another of your public schools\r\n  is named after Abraham Lincoln. That, too, is a most appropriate\r\n  designation; for where, in all the story of our country, among its\r\n  men who have been illustrious in civil pursuits or in war, can two\r\n  names be found which furnish more inspiration and hope to the youth\r\n  of the land than the names of Lincoln and Garfield? [Applause.] Both\r\n  men came of parentage so poor that no advantages attended their early\r\n  years, and yet each by his own indomitable will, by the persevering\r\n  improvement of the meagre opportunities they enjoyed, reached the\r\n  highest place in our land, and are to-day embalmed in the affectionate\r\n  recollection of their countrymen. I bid you all to read the lessons\r\n  of these great lives, and to ponder them well, for while not all may\r\n  achieve all they achieved, useful and honorable position may be\r\n  achieved by you all. Wishing you every prosperity and success, I bid\r\n  you good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAt night the city was brilliantly illuminated. A public reception was\r\nheld at the Hotel Antlers. The President and his party were assisted\r\nby Governor and Mrs. Routt and the Citizens' Committee. The welcoming\r\nceremonies took place before a great assemblage; Mayor Sprague made the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nThe President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I am sure you will crown the\r\n  kindness which you have shown me to-day by permitting me to make my\r\n  response to these words of welcome exceedingly brief. I have spoken\r\n  four or five times to-day, and the chill of the evening will not allow\r\n  me to exercise my voice with the accustomed immunity, but I cannot\r\n  refrain from saying to you how much we have been pleased by the hasty\r\n  glimpse we have been permitted to get of this beautiful city. The fame\r\n  of Colorado Springs has spread throughout the entire East. I heard\r\n  much of the beauty of its location, the grandeur and sublimity of\r\n  these mountains that stand about bulwarked, as it is, like Jerusalem\r\n  of old; of the health-giving atmosphere that fills this valley, of\r\n  the marvellous springs, refreshing and life giving, which break out\r\n  from your mountain sides; of these marvellous and weird products of\r\n  time that stand in the Garden of the Gods--of all this I had heard.\r\n  But, my countrymen, no spring that ever broke from mountain side, no\r\n  bracing air that ever filled these valleys, was more refreshing and\r\n  invigorating to the invalid or to the weary than your hearty greeting\r\n  has been to us. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I visit your great State for the first time. When this journey has\r\n  been completed only two of the States of the Union, and only its\r\n  most distant Territory, will have escaped my personal inspection and\r\n  observation. From Maine to California, from the northern line of\r\n  Michigan, where it is washed by the waters of the Sault Ste. Marie,\r\n  to the Savannah, I have traversed this broad land of ours, and out\r\n  of all this journeying, out of all this mingling with our people, I\r\n  have come to be a prouder and, I hope, a better American. We have\r\n  a country whose diversity of climate, soil, and production makes\r\n  it, in a degree not true of other people in the world, independent\r\n  and self-contained. None of the necessaries of life, and few of its\r\n  luxuries, would be denied to us if we were to limit ourselves to\r\n  articles of American growth and production. [Cheers.] But better than\r\n  all this, greater than our bulk, are those things that enter into and\r\n  characterize the American social and political life. A distinguished\r\n  Englishman journeying in this country not many years ago, speaking\r\n  of his observations, rather caustically mentioned that the question\r\n  most often propounded to him was whether he was not surprised by the\r\n  great size of the country. He was a man of discernment, one who looked\r\n  beneath the surface, who had learned to measure the mighty impulses\r\n  which turn the current of human civilization, and rebuking this pride\r\n  of bulk he said: Yes, it was a surprise, but greater still to him was\r\n  the surprise that over 60,000,000 people could maintain and preserve\r\n  under free republican institutions the social order and individual\r\n  liberty which was maintained here; greater to him than bulk was the\r\n  marvel that this great people could have survived and maintained\r\n  its institutions under the terrible stress of the great Civil War;\r\n  greater than all else to him was that unification of the people which\r\n  seemed to follow that period of deadly strife. I rejoice to be with\r\n  you to-night as an American citizen. I rejoice in the glory which the\r\n  Centennial State has brought to the Union, and which will greatly\r\n  increase. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENVER, COLORADO, MAY 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Denver, at 9:45 Tuesday morning, President Harrison\r\nreceived an ovation. The tribute was a spontaneous, hearty one,\r\nemphasized by the acclaim of 100,000 people. Governor Routt, ex-Senator\r\nTabor, ex-Senator Hill, and other distinguished citizens escorted the\r\npresidential party from Glenwood Springs.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Executive was met at the Union Depot by the Hon.

Byers, William M. Bliss, George H. Graham, Lewis Price, Jay Cook,\r\nJr., C. S. Prowitt, S. C. Shepard, O. Carstarphen, Captain J. T. Smith,\r\nand Hugh Butler.\r\n\r\nThe parade was an imposing and brilliant spectacle, in charge of Chief\r\nMarshal A. H. Jones, assisted by Gen. E. K. Stimson, Chief of Staff,\r\nand the following aides: John C. Kennedy, Adjutant-General of Colorado;\r\nBenjamin F. Klee, E. J. Brooke, W. H. Conley, John A. McBeth, W. Y.\r\nSedam, N. G. Dunn, George Ady, Thomas R. Scott, John Corcoran, B. A.\r\nHarbour, Thomas Baldwin, G. G. Symes, S. A. Shepard, and Robert R.\r\nWright. Over 1,000 G. A. R. comrades were in line, led by George W.\r\nCook, and several hundred Sons of Veterans, commanded by Col. C. H.\r\nAnderson. The President's carriage, drawn by six white horses, was\r\nescorted by Lieut. Col. A. W. Hogle and staff. Countless thousands\r\nthronged the streets along the route of the procession. As the column\r\npassed the High School 10,000 scholars and children gave the President\r\nand Mrs. Harrison an enthusiastic greeting. A vast assemblage awaited\r\nthe President's arrival at the reviewing stand, where he was met by the\r\nColorado Pioneers, led by Maj. William Wise. Governor Routt delivered an\r\neloquent address of welcome, followed by Mayor Rogers, who portrayed\r\nthe triumphant struggle and growth of Denver. President Harrison\r\nresponded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Routt, Mr. Mayor, Pioneers of Colorado, Comrades of the\r\n  Grand Army_ [cheers] _and Fellow-citizens_--This scene is inspiring.\r\n  This beautiful city, the fame of which your journeying citizens\r\n  have not failed to carry to the far East [laughter and cheers], has\r\n  become known to me as we can know by the hearing of the ear; and I am\r\n  rejoiced to add to my pleasant impressions of Colorado, and of its\r\n  commercial and political capital, that which is in sight of the eye,\r\n  which has but deepened and enlarged the favorable impressions which\r\n  I brought to your State. It is a marvellous thing that all we see\r\n  here is in a State whose existence dates from the dawn of the second\r\n  century of our national life. What a tremendous testimony to the\r\n  organizing power and energy of the American people this great State\r\n  is! That these wastes, so unpromising to the eye in that early time,\r\n  should have been invaded by the restless energy of indomitable men;\r\n  that they should have seen in visions that which was to follow their\r\n  heroic labor for the development of these hidden resources; that no\r\n  drought or drifting sand, no threat of mountain nor of sky, could turn\r\n  back these brave-hearted men who had set their faces to pierce and\r\n  uncover the hidden riches of these mountains. The pioneers of Colorado\r\n  are worthy of honor. Those who have entered into their labors, who\r\n  have come not toilsomely but on swift and easy wings into the heritage\r\n  that they have opened, should, always and everywhere, gratefully\r\n  acknowledge the services of those who made this easy pathway for their\r\n  feet. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Your State is blessed in the diversity of its resources. You do not\r\n  depend on any one of the great industries of civilized life. You have\r\n  taken from your mines immense stores of the precious metals, but when\r\n  these are gone or their supply is diminished you will turn your eyes\r\n  toward those metals that we call base, but that after all enter in\r\n  so many ways into human life that they supply more enduring and in\r\n  the end more profitable industries. Your iron, and coal, and lead,\r\n  and building stone will be sources of income inexhaustible. These\r\n  valleys, touched by the magical power of irrigation, will yield to\r\n  your population abundant food, and you will yet have within yourselves\r\n  that happy commercial condition of a State producing and exchanging\r\n  within its own limits nearly all the necessaries of life. [Cheers.]\r\n  Transportation is always a burden. The industrial condition is always\r\n  best when the producers and the consumers are near together.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that you have not been so busy in delving into\r\n  the earth; that you have not so turned your minds to the precious\r\n  metal as to have forgotten that there is a blue sky above you; that\r\n  there are aspirations, and hopes, and glories that are greater than\r\n  all material things. [Cheers.] You have not failed to make sure that\r\n  the children, the blessed children of your homes, that are now coming\r\n  on, are made secure in the possession of a well-ordered and of a\r\n  well-endowed school system. [Cheers.] What a testimony it is to the\r\n  American character that, however intense the push for the things of\r\n  this life, however eager the pursuit of gain, you can never assemble a\r\n  community of 200 people that they do not begin to organize schools for\r\n  the children. [Cheers.] These common schools are not simply nurseries\r\n  of intellectual training; they are nurseries of citizenship. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It has been a most happy sight to see the same old banner that we\r\n  bore into the smoke of battle and carried over dying comrades to\r\n  place it in triumph on the ramparts of the enemy now in the hands of\r\n  the children of Colorado. [Cheers.] Proof has been made a thousand\r\n  times--proof will be made whenever the occasion requires--that, as\r\n  much as we pursue gain and personal ends, we have nothing--property or\r\n  life--that we do not freely lay down upon the altar of our country for\r\n  the general good. [Cheers.] But, my fellow-citizens, this assemblage\r\n  is too vast, and the demand upon my time for public speech has been\r\n  too protracted, to enable me to pursue these remarks further.\r\n\r\n  Comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic, survivors of the\r\n  great war whose success preserved all that our fathers had devised\r\n  and established, whose success brought back this flag in honor and\r\n  established it again the undisputed emblem of an indissoluble Union\r\n  [cheers], God has bountifully lengthened out your days that you might\r\n  catch some glimpse of the glory that has come from the achievements in\r\n  which you bore an honorable part. But only the vision of the prophet\r\n  reaching out over centuries to come can catch the full glory of\r\n  what your deeds have wrought. I give you to-day a most affectionate\r\n  greeting [cheers]; I give you a regretful good-by. May you hold in\r\n  the community where you live that respect and honor to which you are\r\n  entitled. Let no Grand Army man ever dishonor in civil life the noble\r\n  record he made in war. May every blessing follow you, and if it shall\r\n  not be in God's dispensation to give you riches, at least, comrades,\r\n  you shall die with the glorious satisfaction of having contributed to\r\n  the greatest work that man ever wrought for humanity and good; and,\r\n  wrapped in the flag you followed, your comrades will, one by one, see\r\n  that in honored graves your bodies rest until the resurrection, and\r\n  that on each returning day of decoration flowers are strewn upon your\r\n  graves.\r\n\r\n  Citizens of Denver, I cannot close without expressing the great\r\n  satisfaction and surprise with which I have witnessed this morning the\r\n  magnificent commercial developments which have been made here. These\r\n  streets, these towering, substantial, and stately houses in which your\r\n  commerce is transacted, place you in the front rank of enterprise. I\r\n  do not think any city so young can claim so high a place. [Cheers.]\r\n  I thank you very sincerely for a demonstration which I cannot accept\r\n  as personal--all this is too great for any man--but as a spontaneous\r\n  tribute to our free institutions. I accept this as an evidence that in\r\n  all essential things we are one people. The fuller revelation of that\r\n  fact to us all has been worth all the labor and time we have mutually\r\n  expended in this long journey. In all essential things we are one; we\r\n  divide and strive and debate, but we are patriotic American citizens,\r\n  having a love for the Constitution and the flag that brings us all\r\n  at last to submit our opinion to the lawfully expressed wish of the\r\n  majority. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  And now again good-by. I shall leave behind me every good wish\r\n  for your prosperity, individually as a municipality and as a State.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAfter a drive over Capitol Hill the President and the gentlemen of his\r\nparty were the guests of W. H. Bush at the Hotel Metropole. Senator\r\nTeller presided at luncheon.\r\n\r\nResponding to a toast in honor of the President of the United States,\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I cannot fail to respond to such a toast. Indeed, I\r\n  should be unkind to you and to myself as well if I did not. However,\r\n  I cannot speak at length in thanking you for the gracious hospitality\r\n  I have received in Denver. I can truly say my visit has culminated\r\n  in Denver. For pleasure during my stay here, for perfection in\r\n  arrangement, for cordiality, and all things which go to make a stop\r\n  pleasant, Denver has given a climax of enjoyment.\r\n\r\n  It has given me great pleasure to take note of some of the things\r\n  which have made this beautiful city here and its recent and massive\r\n  developments a wonder to the civilization of to-day. I am apt to judge\r\n  the city by the home. That is with me the test, more than the business\r\n  buildings, the manufactories, etc. It gives me great pleasure to\r\n  state that in all my travels, and they have included all the States\r\n  but two, I have never seen a city with such elegant homes as here.\r\n  [Cheers.] I am sure, when you have worked out your silver mines and\r\n  the more common products, stone and granite, you will have that which\r\n  will last you for an indefinite time, and which will also add to the\r\n  beauty of your already beautiful city. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I have the pleasure of testifying to the satisfaction with which the\r\n  party has spent these few days in the Centennial State. I hope I may\r\n  have the pleasure of being with you again at some near future time.\r\n\r\n  I say good-by, and again express our thanks for your hospitality,\r\n  which has been excelled nowhere on our journey. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAKRON, COLORADO, MAY 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President made his farewell Colorado speech at Akron at 9 o'clock\r\nat night. The Reception Committee consisted of Hon. D. W. Irwin, R.\r\nS. Langley, and J. M. Aitkin. Upward of 3,000 people welcomed the\r\ndistinguished travellers. Colonel Griffith and Gen. L. C. Colby,\r\nCommander Nebraska State Guards, joined the party at Akron as the\r\nrepresentatives of Governor John M. Thayer.\r\n\r\nCommander John N. Tague, of Akron Post, G. A. R., introduced President\r\nHarrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It is very kind of you to gather here to-night as\r\n  we pass by. We have had a very pleasant trip. Our interest in your\r\n  State and our appreciation of its great resources have been very much\r\n  increased on this visit. I am glad to find--indeed, I knew I should\r\n  find--the same people here that we have in Illinois, Indiana, and\r\n  Ohio. Most of you come from some of those States, and you are not new\r\n  people. I have been very much pleased to notice that here, as well as\r\n  in the East, you take deep interest in schools and in all those things\r\n  that tend to elevate a community and to set social order on a firm and\r\n  secure basis. Allow me to thank you again, and to bid you good-night.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHASTINGS, NEBRASKA, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nHastings, Nebraska's third city, was reached at 6:30 the morning of\r\nthe 13th, and notwithstanding the early hour fully 10,000 people were\r\npresent to welcome the President. The Reception Committee consisted of\r\nMayor A. L. Clarke, Hon. John M. Ragan, C. H. Dietrich, Judge W. R.\r\nBurton, F. H. Firman, W. M. Kerr, General Dilworth, J. J. Buchanan, R.\r\nA. Batty, James B. Heartwell, A. F. Powers, A. V. Cole, M. Van Fleet,\r\nDr. Johnson, Dr. J. E. Hilts, A. H. Brown, Dr. Cook, R. B. Wahlquist,\r\nand C. Cameron.\r\n\r\nJ. N. Clarke delivered the address of welcome and introduced President\r\nHarrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-countrymen_--There is a freshness and a beauty about\r\n  the Nebraska prairies, but I hope I will not fall in your esteem\r\n  if I say I do not like to get up early. [Shouts, \"Neither do we!\"]\r\n  Occasionally, in our trip, we seem to pick up an hour. When I retired\r\n  at Denver last night, at none too early an hour, I was told that we\r\n  would be at Hastings at 6:30. But we arrived here, it seems to me, at\r\n  5:20 by the time I went to bed by last night; but, my friends, all\r\n  these things that make labor of travel are as nothing compared with\r\n  the great gratification we find in such assemblages as this.\r\n\r\n  As we journeyed eastward we have seen the arid land where the\r\n  water ran in ditches and did not fall in showers. That system has\r\n  its advantages and its disadvantages, but I must confess that it\r\n  seems more homelike for me to get back to the land where the showers\r\n  fall and everything is fresh and green. This diversity of natural\r\n  conditions and of agricultural and mineral wealth makes the greatness\r\n  of our country. Diversity is found everywhere in nature, and it is\r\n  a happy thing. It is found in the field and crop, but never in the\r\n  people--any observing man can see that we are one people. [Cheers.]\r\n  The people I saw in California, in Arizona, and all along our journey,\r\n  were just such people as I see here; indeed, they were in a strict\r\n  sense the same people, because they are Yankees, Pennsylvanians,\r\n  Wisconsin men, Hoosiers, and Buckeyes--I think the Ohio man must be\r\n  here. [Several responses of \"Here we are!\"]\r\n\r\n  The Westerners are the overspill of the enterprising population\r\n  of the East. They kept going a little farther west, still a little\r\n  farther, until at last they touched the Pacific; and so anywhere the\r\n  traveller may go, if he will make himself known, the hands of old\r\n  neighbors will be stretched out to him. Out of all this comes the love\r\n  for the one flag, and I am glad to say that we have not passed any\r\n  little way station--even in Arizona, where a few scores had gathered\r\n  from distant ranches--but some one with an American flag was there and\r\n  American cheers for that flag. Sometimes the incidents were almost\r\n  pathetic. At one little station in Arizona, as we drew up in the\r\n  darkness, there were half a dozen ranchers on the platform. I noticed\r\n  on the lapels of two or three coats the Grand Army button. One of them\r\n  shouted, \"There are but few of us, but let us give a cheer for the old\r\n  flag, boys!\" [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you most cordially for your gathering here. I do not know\r\n  whether it is prejudice or not, but anyway I always have a very high\r\n  opinion of a State whose chief production is corn. [Laughter and\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRETE, NEBRASKA, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Crete the President received a musical welcome. Nedela's band\r\nrendered \"America,\" and over 2,000 voices joined in the chorus. It was\r\na beautiful tribute to patriotism. Governor Thayer, accompanied by\r\nLieut. Gov. T. J. Majors, Secretary of State J. C. Allen, Auditor T. H.\r\nBenton, Treasurer J. E. Hill, Atty. Gen. Geo. H. Hastings, Adjt. Gen. A.\r\nV. Cole, Commissioner A. R. Humphry, and Col. H. E. Palmer, came down\r\nfrom Lincoln and met the President's party at Crete. The local Reception\r\nCommittee consisted of Mayor Norris, ex-Governor Dawes, S. L. Andrews,\r\nCapt. John Sherrill, and H. M. Wells.\r\n\r\nGovernor Thayer introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It appears sometimes in the heat of political\r\n  campaigns that the American people do not agree upon anything; but\r\n  after it is all over we take a broader survey of things and we find\r\n  that underneath all these divisions is the bed rock of patriotism. In\r\n  that at least we have a common purpose.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to see these children here this morning. They have greeted\r\n  me everywhere with their happy smiles, and they brighten the way\r\n  quite as much as the flowers that have been given us. It is pleasant\r\n  to know that in these pioneer countries you are establishing common\r\n  schools in order that the generation which is coming on may have a\r\n  better chance than you had. I do not know of anything better than the\r\n  father and mother working and striving that their children may have an\r\n  easier and better chance in life than they had. I am very glad to see\r\n  you all this morning, and thank you for your cordial welcome. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN, NEBRASKA, MAY 13\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capital of Nebraska was reached at 9 o'clock in the morning and the\r\nLincolnites gave the President a warm greeting. The State officials,\r\nwith Mayor Weir and the following prominent citizens, comprised the\r\nCommittee of Reception: Maj. H. C. McArthur, Charles H. Gere, E. E.\r\nBrown, N. S. Harwood, C. M. Parker, C. E. Montgomery, S. S. Royce, A.\r\nH. Weir, J. B. Archibald, W. E. Churchill, Alva Brown, John D. Wright,\r\nPhelps Paine, J. B. Strode, C. H. Gould, Joseph Teeters, J. J. Imhoff,\r\nJohn H. McClay, D. W. Mosely, J. H. McMurtry, Professor Bessey, and\r\nAlva Kennard. During the march to the Capitol grounds the President was\r\nescorted by the veterans of Farragut Post, Martin Howe Commander, and\r\nAppomattox Post, C. W. Lyman Commander. Governor Thayer and Mayor Weir\r\neach delivered an address welcoming the President to Nebraska and to\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison responded:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Thayer and Mr. Mayor_--It will, I think, be entirely\r\n  impossible for me to make myself heard by this vast assemblage,\r\n  situated as you are here this morning. Our stay with you is\r\n  necessarily brief, and yet I do not want you to feel that we have\r\n  discriminated against the political capital of one of the very\r\n  greatest of the newer States. I have been so pressed with the\r\n  engagements which have been suggested to us that I have only been able\r\n  to give three-quarters of an hour to Indianapolis, my own home. I have\r\n  given you the same, and I had hoped, very much, that this time could\r\n  be extended and that I would be able to address you with more comfort\r\n  to myself and to you.\r\n\r\n  We are here as American citizens, for common hope and love; we are\r\n  here the friends of the flag, of the Constitution, of social order,\r\n  of every school, of all that characterizes this Nation and makes it\r\n  better than any other nation in the world.\r\n\r\n  I thank you, most cordially thank you, for this magnificent\r\n  demonstration. It has but one fault, and that is it is altogether too\r\n  large to be suitably arranged with a view to public speaking.\r\n\r\n  I hope you will allow me again to thank you very sincerely for your\r\n  most cordial and magnificent welcome, and wish for you and your State\r\n  all prosperity and for the country of which we are common citizens a\r\n  career of unchecked glory. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\nAs the President was about to depart he was met by a committee\r\nrepresenting the Nebraska Travelling Men's Association, consisting of\r\nPresident Fred A. Wilson, Secretary R. M. Simons, and Capt. J. S. Agey,\r\nwho presented him with an address of welcome printed on satin in gold.\r\nIn accepting the souvenir the President said:\r\n\r\n  Convey my thanks to the travelling men, for whom I entertain the\r\n  kindest regard. I remember them in the last campaign, and shall always\r\n  be thankful for the favors extended. I noticed your body in the\r\n  parade, and have never seen a finer representation of the fraternity.\r\n  [Renewed cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASHLAND, NEBRASKA, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 2,000 people greeted the President at Ashland. The school children\r\nwere assembled at the station under Superintendent Crabtree. Mayor J. C.\r\nRailsback, H. H. Shedd, S. G. Bryan, Col. J. K. Clarke, R. E. Butler,\r\nC. N. Folsom, M. Newman, W. T. Spere, J. H. Snell, J. H. Oliver, J. W.\r\nMoon, and S. B. Hall, Commander of Bob McCook Post, G. A. R., welcomed\r\nthe President, who made a brief address, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I am very much obliged to you for your cordial\r\n  welcome. We pause but for a moment, and it will not be possible for me\r\n  to make a speech. You are talking yourselves, and I am sure in very\r\n  high tones of patriotism, by your display of the national colors in\r\n  your own hands and in the hands of the school children, and by this\r\n  welcome to one who for the time is placed at the head of the national\r\n  Government. I have not accepted what I have seen on this trip as\r\n  personal; it is too much for any man. I accept it as the expression of\r\n  our people for the love of our flag and for the institutions which it\r\n  symbolizes. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOMAHA, NEBRASKA, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison arrived at Omaha Wednesday noon and was accorded a\r\nreception that in numbers and enthusiasm was scarcely surpassed during\r\nthe entire trip. He was met at Lincoln by an escort committee consisting\r\nof Senator Charles F. Manderson, Senator A. S. Paddock, Hon. J. C.\r\nCowin, ex-Gov. R. B. Furnas, Maj. D. H. Wheeler, Judge J. M. Thurston,\r\nG. W. Willard, W. V. Morse, D. J. O'Donohue, B. B. Wood, Dr. G. L.\r\nMiller, C. Hartman, Maj. T. S. Clarkson, C. J. Greene, A. J. Poppleton,\r\nHon. J. E. Boyd, J. H. Millard, Thomas Swobe, A. P. Hopkins, Max Meyer,\r\nW. F. Bechel, and T. J. Lowry.\r\n\r\nArrived at the station the President and his party were met and\r\nwelcomed by Mayor R. C. Cushing at the head of the following committee\r\nof prominent citizens: Hon. E. S. Dundy, E. Wakely, T. J. Mahoney,\r\nDr. J. E. Summers, L. Berka, W. J. Broatch, Fred Metz, T. L. Kimball,\r\nG. M.

Cusadore, O. G. Decker, Charles L. Thomas, M.\r\nJ. Feenan, Frank Moores, General Brooke and staff, and the following\r\ncity officials: C. S. Goodrich, John Rush, Lee Helsley, W. S. Shoemaker,\r\nSilas Cobb, John Groves, Geo. W. Tillson, P. W. Birkhauser, Geo. C.\r\nWhitlock, Geo. L. Dennis, A. B. Howatt, Clark Gapan, J. J. Galligan,\r\nWilber S. Seavey, James Flannery, H. L. Rammacciotti, James Gilbert,\r\nThomas J. McLean, J. H. Standeven, Thomas Riley, Thomas Bermingham, Fred\r\nHickstein, Peter A. Welch, and Frank R. Morrisey.\r\n\r\nThe ladies on the Reception Committee were Mrs. Alvin Saunders, Mrs.\r\nGeneral Brooke, Mrs. General Wheaton, Mrs. Judge Dundy, Mrs. Clark\r\nWoodman, Mrs. H. W. Yates, Mrs. E. Rosewater, Mrs. S. S. Caldwell, and\r\nMrs. Geo. M. O'Brien.\r\n\r\nAn imposing procession, conducted by Chief Marshal C. F. Weller,\r\nassisted by Jacob Fawcett and Capt. Geo. Porter, escorted the\r\npresidential party to the pavilion near the Court House, from whence\r\nthe President reviewed the column, headed by the Second Regiment U.S.\r\nInfantry. General Frederick, Col. M. V. Sheridan, Colonel Turson,\r\nGeneral Mulcahy, Captain Morseman, Major Potwin, Colonel Curtis, Colonel\r\nStrong, Captain Richardson, Captain Rhodes, Captain Stickle, Major\r\nLuddington, Lieutenant Jensen, Lieutenant Korty, and other members of\r\nthe Loyal Legion, awaited the Commander-in-Chief at the pavilion, around\r\nwhich a vast concourse assembled. Mayor Cushing made the welcoming\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nWhen the demonstration subsided President Harrison responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I can accept without question\r\n  and with very deep gratitude these cordial words of welcome which\r\n  you have spoken on behalf of the people of this great city. Twice\r\n  before it has been my pleasure to spend a brief time in this great\r\n  commercial metropolis of the great Valley of the Missouri. I have had\r\n  opportunity, therefore, to witness the rapid development which your\r\n  city has made. I recollect it as I saw it in 1881, and as I see it\r\n  to-day I feel that I need to be told where I am. [Applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  These magnificent structures dedicated to commerce, these\r\n  magnificent churches lifting their spires toward the heavens, these\r\n  many school-houses consecrated to the training of those who shall\r\n  presently stand in our places to be responsible for these our public\r\n  institutions, these great stock-yards, where the meat product of the\r\n  great meat-producing States of the Missouri Valley is prepared for\r\n  market, and, above all and crowning all, these thousands of happy,\r\n  comfortable homes which characterize and constitute your great city\r\n  are a marvel and tribute to the enterprise and power of development of\r\n  the American people, unsurpassed, I think, by any city in the United\r\n  States. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  As I turn my face now toward Washington, as I hasten on to take up\r\n  public duties partially laid aside during this journey, I rejoice to\r\n  receive here in Omaha that same kindly greeting with which we were\r\n  welcomed as we journeyed from Washington through the South to the\r\n  Pacific. If anything were needed to call for a perfect surrender\r\n  of all personal thought in an absolute consecration of public duty\r\n  to the general good of all our people, I have found it in these\r\n  magnificent demonstrations. [Cheers.] We shall always have parties--it\r\n  is characteristic of free people--we need to have party divisions,\r\n  debate, and political contention; but it is pleasant to observe in all\r\n  this journey we have taken how large a stock of common patriotism we\r\n  find in all the people. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  You have here in Nebraska a State of magnificent capabilities. I\r\n  have seen the orange grove, and all those fruits which enrich and\r\n  characterize the State of California. I have seen Leadville, the\r\n  summit city, these mining camps upon the peaks where men are delving\r\n  into the earth to bring out the riches stored there, but I return\r\n  again to the land of the cornstalk with an affection that I cannot\r\n  describe. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am sure these friends who have delighted us with the visions\r\n  of loveliness and prosperity will excuse me if my birth and early\r\n  training in Ohio and Indiana leads me to the conclusion that the\r\n  States that raise corn are the greatest States in the world. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We have a surplus production in these great valleys for which we\r\n  must seek foreign markets. It is pleasant to know that 90 per cent.\r\n  or more of our agricultural productions are consumed by our own\r\n  people. I do not know how soon it may be that we shall cease to be\r\n  dependent upon any foreign market for our farm products. With the\r\n  rapid development which is being made in manufacturing pursuits, with\r\n  the limitation which the rapid occupation of our public domain now\r\n  brings to our minds as to the increase of agriculture, it cannot be a\r\n  very distant day when the farmer shall realize the ideal condition and\r\n  find a market out of his own farm wagon for what he produces.\r\n\r\n  It has been a source of constant thought and zealous effort on the\r\n  part of the Administration at Washington to secure larger foreign\r\n  markets for our farm products. I rejoice that in the last two years\r\n  some of those obstructions which hindered the free access of our\r\n  meat products to American markets have been removed. I rejoice to\r\n  know that we have now freer, larger access for our meats to the\r\n  markets of England and of Europe than we have had in many years.\r\n  [Applause.] I rejoice to know that this has brought better prices to\r\n  the stock-raisers of these great western valleys. I believe, under the\r\n  provision looking to reciprocal trade in the law of the last Congress,\r\n  that we shall open yet larger and nearer markets for the products of\r\n  Nebraska farmers. [Cheers.] So distant as you are from the Atlantic\r\n  seaboard, it may have seemed to you that your interest in the revival\r\n  of our trade, in the re-establishment of an American merchant marine,\r\n  was not perceptible or direct.\r\n\r\n  Not long since an inquiry was made as to the origin of the freight\r\n  that was carried by one of the Brazilian steamers from the port of New\r\n  York, and it was found that twenty-five States had made contribution\r\n  to that cargo, and among those States was the State of Nebraska.\r\n  [Cheers.] And so by such methods as we can it is our purpose to\r\n  enlarge our foreign markets for the surplus productions of our great\r\n  country. And we hope--and we think this hope fills the great West as\r\n  well as the East--that when this increased traffic and commerce is\r\n  found upon the sea it shall be carried in American bottoms. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  A few days ago, sailing in the harbor of San Francisco, I saw three\r\n  great deep-water ships enter the Golden Gate. One carried the flag of\r\n  Hawaii and two the British flag, and at Portland they took the pains\r\n  to tow up from the lower harbor and to deck in bunting an American\r\n  ship that was lying in the harbor. It was a curious sight--one they\r\n  thought important to exhibit to strangers visiting that city. Why,\r\n  my countrymen, I hope the day is not far distant when the sight of\r\n  great American ships flying the Stars and Stripes at the fore will be\r\n  familiar not only in our own ports, but in every busy mart of commerce\r\n  the world around. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  This Government of ours cannot do everything for everybody. The\r\n  theory of our Government is large individual liberty. It is that we\r\n  shall take out of the way all legislative obstructions to the free and\r\n  honest pursuit of all human industries; that each individual shall in\r\n  his own place have the best chance possible to develop the highest\r\n  prosperity for himself and his family.\r\n\r\n  Some functions are lodged with our Government. It must provide a\r\n  currency for the use of our people, for I believe the time has gone\r\n  by when we will be content to return to the old system of an issue\r\n  of money by State banks. But I will not discuss such questions. I\r\n  only desire to say this--which is common ground upon which we can all\r\n  stand--that whatever money the Government issues, paper or coin, must\r\n  be good money. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I have an idea that every dollar we issue should be as good as any\r\n  dollar we issue, for, my countrymen, whenever we have any money, paper\r\n  or coin, the first errand that dollar does is to pay some workingman\r\n  for his daily toil. No one so much as the laboring man and the farmer\r\n  requires a full value dollar of permanent value the year around.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  But, my countrymen, I had not intended to speak so long. I hope\r\n  I have not intruded upon any ground of division. I am talking, not\r\n  as a partisan, but as an American citizen, desiring by every method\r\n  to enhance the prosperity of all our people; to have this great\r\n  Government in all that it undertakes touch with beneficence and equal\r\n  hands the pursuits of the rich and of the poor. [Cheers.] Nothing\r\n  has been so impressive in all this journey as the magnificent spirit\r\n  of patriotism which pervades our people. I have seen enough American\r\n  flags to wrap the world around. [Great applause and cheers.]\r\n\r\n  The school children have waved it joyously to us, and many a time\r\n  in some lonesome country home on the bleak sand I have seen a man or\r\n  woman or a little boy come to the door of a cabin as we hurried by\r\n  waving the starry banner in greeting to our train. I am sure, as your\r\n  Mayor has said, that this same magnificent, patriotic, American spirit\r\n  pervades you all here to-day.\r\n\r\n  God bless you all; prosper you in every endeavor; give glory and\r\n  increase to your city, and settle all its institutions upon a secure\r\n  basis of social order and obedience to the law. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_At the High-School Grounds._\r\n\r\nOn concluding the formal reception the President and his party became\r\nthe guests of Hon. E. Rosewater, editor and proprietor of the Omaha\r\n_Daily Bee_, and after inspecting the editorial rooms the President held\r\na reception in the rotunda of the _Bee_ building. This was followed\r\nby a ride over the city, escorted by the Reception Committee. As the\r\n_cortége_ passed the High-School grounds 20,000 children and adults gave\r\nthe President a most patriotic greeting.\r\n\r\nHalting in front of the building, the President arose in his carriage\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n  It gives me great pleasure to receive this cordial greeting from\r\n  the teachers and pupils of the Omaha public schools. The most\r\n  pleasant features of this journey have been the beautiful and cordial\r\n  receptions given us by the school children. I am pleased to notice the\r\n  magnificent system of schools you have here in Omaha--part of a system\r\n  that had its origin in New England and now extends over this entire\r\n  country, the mainstay of this great Government. A number of years ago\r\n  I was standing upon the banks of the headwaters of the Missouri River,\r\n  where its waters are pure and limpid, but after passing through the\r\n  bad lands of Dakota the waters of the mighty river become contaminated\r\n  and impure, as you see it rolling by your beautiful city. Let me hope\r\n  that none of you, my little friends, will ever become tainted by\r\n  contact with the bad lands of experience as you journey through life\r\n  on to manhood and womanhood. God bless you all; good-by.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these remarks General Harrison was apprised that\r\na mistake had been made in halting at the entrance, as the children\r\nwere unable to either hear or see him. Upon learning this the President\r\nimmediately alighted and made his way with some difficulty to the\r\nplatform, where he addressed the children, saying:\r\n\r\n  _My Little Friends_--You do not feel half as badly as I do at the\r\n  thought that I made my speech intended for you to your papas and\r\n  mammas. I have not the time to attempt to repeat it, but I can't get\r\n  away without telling you of the affectionate interest I have in all\r\n  the children of this great country. Bless you--you are the blossoms of\r\n  our homes. With a good-by and another God bless you I am off. [Great\r\n  cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nA short stop was made at Council Bluffs, where several thousand people\r\ngreeted the party. Owing to the brief time allowed by the schedule no\r\ncommittees were appointed, but the veterans of Abe Lincoln Post, G. A.\r\nR., Dr. F. S. Thomas Commander, greeted the party. Hon. Joseph R. Reed\r\nmade a brief welcoming address.\r\n\r\nThe President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It gives me great pleasure to thank you for this\r\n  cordial greeting as we cross the river. I was not anticipating a\r\n  meeting here or any call for an address. I see about me some of my old\r\n  comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic, and I want to give them a\r\n  comrade's greeting. I have seen them everywhere; even out on the sands\r\n  of Arizona I found them gathered together, and it has always been a\r\n  pleasure to meet them. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHENANDOAH, IOWA, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Shenandoah was illuminated in honor of the President's\r\nvisit. The travellers were welcomed by Mayor H. S. Nichols, Hon.\r\nBenjamin Todd, C. M. Conway, W. H. Harrison, R. W. Morse, C. S. Keenan,\r\nCapt. C. V. Mount, and the veterans of Burnside Post, G. A. R.,\r\ncommanded by C. P. Coleneous.\r\n\r\nThe President, responding to cheers from the large crowd, said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It gives me great pleasure to see you and to receive\r\n  from you this hearty greeting. Our schedule is so close that we can\r\n  tarry only a moment with you, and therefore I can only say thank you\r\n  and good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARYVILLE, MISSOURI, MAY 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was 11 P.M. when the train made its first stop in Missouri, at\r\nMaryville, where an unusually large crowd greeted the President.\r\nThe welcoming committee consisted of Judge Lafayette Dawson, Ira K.\r\nAlderman, James Todd, W. C. Pierce, H. E. Robinson, and Lyman Parcher.\r\n\r\nWhen the cheering subsided President Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--This multitude is a great surprise. I have already\r\n  spoken six or seven times to-day, and am very much fatigued, so that\r\n  I shall not attempt to speak. Indeed, my time is so close that I can\r\n  tarry but a moment. But I would be untrue to myself if I did not\r\n  acknowledge this most magnificent demonstration. I thank you most\r\n  sincerely for your kindness and bid you good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANNIBAL, MISSOURI, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the earliest reception on the great journey occurred at Hannibal,\r\nwhich was reached at 5:30 the morning of the 14th. Notwithstanding\r\nthe hour, 5,000 people gave the President an enthusiastic welcome.\r\nSecretary Rusk and Postmaster-General Wanamaker appeared on the platform\r\nwith General Harrison. The Reception Committee comprised Capt. John E.\r\nCatlett, C. P. Heywood, J. J. Kirkland, Smith Alexander, Lewis Jackson,\r\nW. H. Dulany, Edward Price, S. J. Miller, James C. Gill, J. H. McVeigh,\r\nJohn T. Leighter, J. H. Pelhem, W. E. Chamberlain, J. H. Boughton,\r\nThomas H. Bacon, G. O. Bishop, S. W. Philips, and W. F. Drescher. The\r\nveterans of W. T. Sherman Post, G. A. R., W. H. Davis Commander, and\r\nseveral hundred school children were conspicuous in the reception.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have only time to assure you that I\r\n  appreciate very highly this evidence of your respect. We have\r\n  extended our journey to the Pacific coast: we have crossed the sandy\r\n  plain, where for days together the eye saw little to refresh it,\r\n  where the green of the blue grass that is so restful to the eye was\r\n  wanting, and yet again and again at some lone station in the desert\r\n  a few children from a school and some of the enterprising people who\r\n  had pushed out there to make new homes assembled with this old banner\r\n  in their hands and gave us a hearty American welcome. I am glad to\r\n  return to this central body of States in which I was raised; glad\r\n  to be again in the land of the buckeye, the beech, and the maple.\r\n  To these dear children I want to say one word of thanks. They have\r\n  done for us much on this journey to make it pleasant; their bright\r\n  faces have cheered us; I love to see them. The care the States are\r\n  taking for their education is wisely bestowed. God bless them all;\r\n  open to their feet pleasant ways and qualify them better than we have\r\n  been in our generation to uphold and perpetuate these magnificent\r\n  civil institutions. Thanking you most sincerely for this kindly\r\n  demonstration I bid you good-by. [Great cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n_At the Tomb of Lincoln._\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief stops were made at Barry, Baylis, Griggsville, and Jacksonville,\r\nbut not long enough for speech-making. Thousands of visitors from\r\nneighboring towns helped the people of Springfield welcome the President\r\non his arrival at 9:15 o'clock. The Committee of Reception that met the\r\npresidential party and escorted them through the principal streets to\r\nthe Lincoln Monument in Oak Ridge Cemetery consisted of the Hon. Joseph\r\nW. Fifer, Governor of Illinois; Senator Shelby M. Cullum, Senator John\r\nM. Palmer, ex-Governor Oglesby, Representatives Henderson and Springer,\r\nLieut.-Gov. L. B. Ray, Secretary of State J. N. Pearson, Auditor\r\nof State C. W. Pavey, Treasurer of State E. S. Wilson, Atty.-Gen.\r\nGeorge Hunt, Adjt-Gen. J. W. Vance, Hon. Rheuna D. Lawrence, Mayor of\r\nSpringfield, and Hon. James C. Conkling; also, Hon. John M. Clark and\r\nCol. E. D. Swain, of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe procession, composed of Illinois National Guards, veterans of the\r\nG. A. R., Sons of Veterans, Knights of Pythias, and the City Fire\r\nDepartment, was marshalled by Gen. Jasper N. Reese, assisted by Col.\r\nJ. H. Barkley. During the exercises at the monument Mayor Lawrence\r\npresided. Governor Fifer delivered an eloquent address of welcome, to\r\nwhich the President made the following response:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Fifer and Fellow-citizens_--During this extended journey,\r\n  in the course of which we have swept from the Atlantic coast to the\r\n  Golden Gate, and northward to the limits of our territory, we have\r\n  stood in many spots of interest and looked upon scenes that were full\r\n  of historical associations and of national interest and inspiration.\r\n  The interest of this journey culminates to-day as we stand here for\r\n  a few moments about the tomb of Lincoln. As I passed through the\r\n  Southern States and noticed those great centres of busy industry which\r\n  had been builded since the war, as I saw how the fires of furnaces had\r\n  been kindled where there was once a solitude, I could not then but\r\n  think and say that it was the hand that now lies beneath these stones\r\n  that kindled and inspired all that we beheld; all these fires of\r\n  industry were lighted at the funeral pyre of slavery. The proclamation\r\n  of Abraham Lincoln can be read on all those mountain sides where free\r\n  men are now bending their energies to the development of States that\r\n  had long been under the paralysis of human slavery.\r\n\r\n  I come to-day to this consecrated and sacred spot with a heart\r\n  filled with emotions of gratitude that that God who wisely turned\r\n  toward our Eastern shores a body of God-fearing and liberty-loving men\r\n  to found this republic did not fail to find for us in the hour of our\r\n  extremity one who was competent to lead the hearts and sympathies and\r\n  hold up the courage of our people in the time of our greatest national\r\n  peril.\r\n\r\n  The life of Abraham Lincoln teaches more useful lessons than any\r\n  other character in American history. Washington stands remote from us.\r\n  We think of him as dignified and reserved, but we think of Lincoln\r\n  as one whose tender touch the children, the poor--all classes of our\r\n  people--felt at their firesides and loved. The love of our people\r\n  is drawn to him because he had such a great heart--such a human\r\n  heart. The asperities and hardships of his early life did not dull,\r\n  but broadened and enlivened, his sympathies. That sense of justice,\r\n  that love of human liberty which dominated all his life, is another\r\n  characteristic that our people will always love. You have here in\r\n  keeping a most precious trust. Toward this spot the feet of the\r\n  reverent patriots of the years to come will bend their way. As the\r\n  story of Lincoln's life is read his virtues will mould and inspire\r\n  many lives.\r\n\r\n  I have studied it and have been filled with wonder and admiration.\r\n  His life was an American product; no other soil could have produced\r\n  it. The greatness of it has not yet been fully discovered or measured.\r\n  As the inner history of the times in which he lived is written we find\r\n  how his great mind turned and moved, in time of peril and delicacy,\r\n  the affairs of our country in their home and foreign relations with\r\n  that marvellous tact, with that never-failing common-sense which\r\n  characterized this man of the people. And that impressive lesson we\r\n  have here this morning. I see in the military uniform of our country,\r\n  standing as guards about this tomb, the sons of a race that had been\r\n  condemned to slavery and was emancipated by his immortal proclamation.\r\n  And what an appropriate thing it is that these whose civil rights were\r\n  curtailed even in this State are now the trusted, affectionate guards\r\n  of the tomb in which he sleeps!\r\n\r\n  We will all again and again read the story of Lincoln's life, and\r\n  will find our hearts and minds enlarged, our loves and our charities\r\n  broadened, and our devotion to the Constitution, the flag, and the\r\n  free Government which he preserved to us, intensified. And now,\r\n  my friends, most cordially do I thank you for these kind words of\r\n  welcome. I shall go from this tomb impressed with new thoughts as to\r\n  the responsibilities of those who bear the responsibilities, though in\r\n  less troublous times, of that great man to whose memory my soul bows\r\n  this morning. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_At the State House._\r\n\r\nWhen the President closed he was presented by Governor Fifer, on\r\nbehalf of the citizens of Petersburg, Ill., with a gold-headed cane\r\nmade from the Lincoln store building at New Salem. Speeches were made\r\nby Postmaster-General Wanamaker and Secretary Rusk, during which the\r\nPresident and Governor Fifer proceeded to the State House, where a large\r\ncrowd collected and the President made the following address:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I feel that we make a very poor return to you\r\n  here for your cordial welcome, and for these extensive preparations\r\n  which you have made to do us honor, but this journey has been so\r\n  long, the time consumed already so great, the demand for my presence\r\n  in Washington is such that I cannot protract the stay here with you\r\n  this morning. I beg all to believe that most heartily and sincerely I\r\n  thank you for this cordial welcome from Illinois, for the interesting\r\n  moments that we have spent about the tomb of that man who would have\r\n  made the fame of Illinois imperishable and Springfield the Mecca for\r\n  patriotic feet if no other man in the history of the State had ever\r\n  come to eminence--Abraham Lincoln. [Cheers.] In his life you have a\r\n  treasury of instruction for your children, a spring of inspiration for\r\n  your people that will be lasting. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECATUR, ILLINOIS, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecatur tendered the President an enthusiastic greeting. Ten\r\nthousand citizens and school children participated in the welcoming\r\ndemonstrations. The Committee of Reception consisted of Mayor Chambers,\r\nHon. S. S. Jack, Hon. W. C. Johns, Dr. John T. Hubbard, Dr. William\r\nA. Barnes, W. H. Bramble, Maj. F. L. Hays, M. F. Kanan, Mrs. W. B.\r\nChambers, Mrs. J. M. Clokey, Mrs. W. F. Calhoun, and Miss Belle Burrows.\r\nHon. J. H. Rowell, of Bloomington, was also a member of the committee.\r\n\r\nIn response to Mayor Chambers' welcoming address President Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--We have been now something\r\n  more than four weeks traversing this broad and beautiful domain\r\n  which, without regard to State lines, we call our country. We have\r\n  passed with such rapidity that our intercourse with the people has\r\n  necessarily been brief and attended by many inconveniences to them.\r\n  Everything that kind hearts could do to make the trip pleasant to us\r\n  has been done, and yet I have always felt that our hasty call at these\r\n  prosperous cities where so much pains have been taken in decoration\r\n  to do honor to us gives us opportunity to make very inadequate\r\n  returns to them. We have been shooting like a meteor as to rapidity,\r\n  but without its luminosity. [Laughter.] It is very pleasant after\r\n  seeing California, Arizona, Idaho, and Colorado, States in which the\r\n  annual rainfall is inadequate to the annual crops, and where the\r\n  dependence of the husbandman is wholly upon irrigation, to come again\r\n  in these Central States, familiar to me from my boyhood, to see crops\r\n  that the Lord waters in every season. The land of the blue grass is\r\n  the land of my love. Nowhere can there be seen fairer landscapes,\r\n  nowhere richer farms, than here in your own great State of Illinois,\r\n  a State whose history has been full of illustrious achievements, rich\r\n  in possibilities, where lived our illustrious sons; a State whose\r\n  population is intelligent, contented, orderly, and liberty-loving; a\r\n  State whose development has not yet begun to approach its possible\r\n  limits; a State having advantages by the location, swept as it is by\r\n  two of the great waterways of the continent, advantages of access\r\n  and markets by lake and rail and river unexcelled by any State in\r\n  the Union; a State that has not forgotten that the permanence of\r\n  our free institutions depends upon the intelligence of the people,\r\n  and has carefully, at the very beginning, laid a foundation for a\r\n  common-school system in which every man's child may have a free\r\n  education. [Cheers.] These are not simply schools of intelligence,\r\n  but, as I have said before, they are schools of statesmanship. They\r\n  tend as much as any other public institution to make our people a\r\n  Nation of loving people. Here on these benches and on this playground\r\n  the people of rich and poor mingle together, and the pampered son gets\r\n  his airs rubbed off with the vigor of his playmates. [\"That's so!\"\r\n  and cheers.] Our Government does not undertake to regulate many of\r\n  the affairs of civil life. The bright blue sky of hope is above every\r\n  boy's head, affording great opportunities for advancement, and then\r\n  our people are left to themselves. Certain great duties are devolved\r\n  upon the Government--to provide revenue and finance and in every\r\n  branch of public interest to legislate in the general interests of all\r\n  the people. I thank you most heartily for this great demonstration. We\r\n  leave you with our thanks, our best wishes for your State, your city,\r\n  and especially for these dear little ones from your schools who come\r\n  to greet us. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUSCOLA, ILLINOIS, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tuscola another large assemblage greeted the travellers most\r\nenthusiastically. The Committee of Reception consisted of Mayor Patrick\r\nC. Sloan, A. W. Wallace, J. J. Knox, Frank Pearce, Dr. S. V. Ramsey, O.\r\nH. Sloan, Hans Heurichs, A. C. Sluss, J. W. King, P. M. Moore, D. A.\r\nConover, and Col. W. Taggart.\r\n\r\nIn response to a hasty but cordial welcome from Mayor Sloan the\r\nPresident said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is very kind of you to assemble here in\r\n  such large numbers to extend to us a greeting as we hurry through your\r\n  beautiful State. We can tarry with you but for a moment, for we are in\r\n  true sense pilgrims. It is pleasant to look in your faces and to read\r\n  there the same kindly thoughts and the same friendliness that seems\r\n  to have covered this whole land as we have journeyed through it. I do\r\n  not like to say anything anywhere that makes a line of division; for I\r\n  know that these assemblages are without regard to politics, and that\r\n  men of all parties have extended to us a cordial greeting. The flag,\r\n  the institutions, and the general good of our people are themes which\r\n  we appreciate, are themes which we honor, though we may approach them\r\n  on different lines. I am glad to notice as I journey through your\r\n  State the evidences of a coming harvest that I hope will be bountiful.\r\n  Wishing for you every good, I bid you good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISMAN, ILLINOIS, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Chrisman the President met with another hearty welcome. More than\r\n6,000 people were present, many coming from Paris, Danville, and other\r\nneighboring points. The Reception Committee consisted of J. F. Van\r\nVoorhees, C. E. Kenton, C. A. Smith, and Revs. Wiley and Wilkin. Kenesaw\r\nPost, G. A. R., of Paris, Ill., J. M. Moody Commander, and a number of\r\nveterans from Ridge Farm were present.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Voorhees introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I have but one message for all these vast assemblies\r\n  of my fellow-citizens who have been greeting us for something more\r\n  than a month at every point where we have stopped. That message is\r\n  to thank you for all these greetings and for the friendliness which\r\n  shines in your faces. I am glad this is a Government by the people,\r\n  because they are the most capable governors that can be found. No\r\n  man can traverse this country, as I have done, from the Potomac to\r\n  the Golden Gate and from the Golden Gate to the cities that open on\r\n  Puget Sound, to the great North Sea, and can look into the faces\r\n  of these people that come from every pursuit, without feeling that\r\n  this Government, raised upon the bulwark of patriotism, is, by God's\r\n  goodness, a perpetual institution. The patriotism of our people, their\r\n  unselfish love for the flag, the great good-nature with which they lay\r\n  aside all sharp party divisions and come together under one banner,\r\n  is very gratifying to us all. Our trip has been attended by many\r\n  incidents that have been full of pleasure and sometimes full of pathos.\r\n\r\n  We have never lost sight of the flag in all this journey. Sometimes\r\n  out on the Great American Desert, as it used to be called, where\r\n  nothing but the sage brush gave evidence of the power of nature to\r\n  clothe the earth, from a little dug-out, where some man had set out to\r\n  make a home for himself, would float the starry banner. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  This is a great country, girded around by the Grand Army of the\r\n  Republic. I have never been out of the fellowship of that great\r\n  organization. I have never stopped on all this trip but some comrade\r\n  did not stretch up his hand to greet me. I have evidence that some\r\n  of you are here to-day in this great State, such a magnificent\r\n  contribution to the Grand Army that they were. I am glad to see these\r\n  children. They have added grace and beauty to every meeting which we\r\n  have had in this long journey. Cherish it in your community--this most\r\n  beneficial institution--the common school of your State.\r\n\r\n  And now, thanking your kindly welcome, and sorry that we can tarry\r\n  for only these few minutes, I bid you good-by, and God bless you.\r\n  [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEZUMA, INDIANA, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about 3 P.M. Thursday when the train crossed the Indiana line\r\nand arrived at Montezuma, where the President was met by a very large\r\nand enthusiastic delegation from Indianapolis, headed by Gov. Alvin P.\r\nHovey, Mayor Thomas L. Sullivan, Gen. Lew Wallace, ex-Gov. Isaac P.\r\nGray, Judge William A. Woods, ex-Senator McDonald, and Senator David\r\nTurpie. The escort from Indianapolis included representatives from 52\r\nlabor organizations, from each G. A. R. post in the city, and delegates\r\nfrom the Hendricks, Gray, Cleveland, Columbia, Marion, Metropolitan,\r\nand Tippecanoe clubs. The Montezuma committee consisted of Rev. Thomas\r\nGriffith, Joseph Burns, T. A. Welshan, J. E. Johnston, N. S. Wheeler,\r\nand H. B. Griffith.\r\n\r\nNo meeting could have been more cordial. Hon. James T. Johnston, of\r\nRockville, in a few eloquent sentences welcomed the President and Mrs.\r\nHarrison on their home-coming.\r\n\r\nThe greeting overcame the President for a few moments, and he was unable\r\nto respond to the demand for a speech at any length. He said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--We have had a long journey, and one that has been\r\n  attended by a great many pleasant incidents. We have had cheers of\r\n  welcome reaching from our first stop, at Roanoke, Va., stretching\r\n  across the mountains of Tennessee and Northern Georgia and Alabama,\r\n  down through Arkansas and Texas, and along the Pacific coast.\r\n  Everywhere we have had the most cordial and kindly greeting; but as\r\n  I cross to-day the border line of Indiana and meet again these old\r\n  friends I find in your welcome a sweetness that exceeds it all.\r\n\r\nAt this point tears came to the President's eyes, and his utterance\r\nbecame so choked he could say no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nPromptly on schedule time, at 4:45, the presidential train arrived at\r\nIndianapolis. Its approach was heralded by an artillery salute. The stay\r\nin the city was limited to forty-five minutes. The Escort and Reception\r\nCommittee--in addition to the distinguished officials mentioned at\r\nMontezuma--consisted in part of the following prominent citizens:\r\nHon. R. B. F. Peirce, Hon. C. W. Fairbanks, Rev. M. L. Haines, Daniel\r\nStewart, Col. Eli Lilly, George L. Knox, George G. Tanner, President\r\nof the Board of Trade; W. D. Wiles, John W. Murphy, George E. Townley,\r\nSilas T. Bowen, W. B. Holton, John M. Shaw, Albert Gall, I. S. Gordon,\r\nJohn P. Frenzel, D. A. Richardson, W. F. C. Golt, Arthur Gillet, John\r\nH. Holliday, Dr. Henry Jameson, Robert Kipp, Thomas C. Moore, V. K.\r\nHendricks, Charles E. Hall, Nathan Morris, E. E. Perry, Smiley N.\r\nChambers, G. B. Thompson, Franklin Landers, and R. K. Syfers.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the President's reception were upon an extensive\r\nscale; the business houses were covered with bunting, and pictures\r\nof the distinguished traveller were seen everywhere. Fully 50,000\r\npeople participated in the welcome home. A speakers' stand was erected\r\nin Jackson Place. The parade was a most successful feature of the\r\ndemonstration; thousands of veterans, sons of veterans, and other\r\ncitizens were in line. Gen. Fred Knefler was Marshal of the day, aided\r\nby the following staff: Major Holstein, George W. Spahr, J. Hauch, John\r\nV. Parker, J. B. Heywood, W. O. Patterson, Samuel Laing, J. A. Wildman,\r\nH. C. Adams, A. W. Hendricks, John W. Keeling, Charles Martindale, W. H.\r\nTucker, J. M. Paver, H. C. Cale, Josh Zimmerman, T. S. Rollins, E. S.\r\nKise, O. P. Ensley, Frank Sherfey, and Berry Robinson.\r\n\r\nCheer after cheer went up from the vast concourse as the President made\r\nhis way to the stand, accompanied by Secretary Rusk, Postmaster-General\r\nWanamaker, and the Escort Committee. It was a genuine Hoosier\r\nwelcome. Governor Hovey made a brief but feeling address, welcoming\r\nthe President's return with \"pride and pleasure.\" Mayor Sullivan\r\nfollowed the Governor in a warm greeting on behalf of the citizens of\r\nIndianapolis.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was visibly affected at the manifestations of love\r\nand esteem, and during the speech-making clearly betrayed the emotion he\r\nfelt at the cordiality of his welcome. He spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Hovey, Mayor Sullivan and Friends_--I do not think I can\r\n  speak much to-day. The strain of this long journey, the frequent\r\n  calls that have been made upon me to speak to my fellow citizens from\r\n  Washington to the Golden Gate, from the Golden Gate to the Straits of\r\n  Fuca, and from the most northwestern portion of our territory here to\r\n  my own home, has left me somewhat exhausted in body and in mind, and\r\n  has made my heart so open to these impressions, as I greet my old home\r\n  friends, that I cannot, I fear, command myself sufficiently to speak\r\n  to you at any length. Our path has been attended by the plaudits of\r\n  multitudes; our way has been strewn with flowers; we have journeyed\r\n  through the orchards of California, laden with its golden fruit; we\r\n  have climbed to the summit of great mountains and have seen those\r\n  rich mines from which the precious metals are extracted; we have\r\n  dropped again suddenly into fruitful valleys, and our pathway has\r\n  been made glad by the cheerful and friendly acclaim of our American\r\n  fellow-citizens without regard to any party division [applause]; but\r\n  I beg to assure you that all the sweetness of the flowers that have\r\n  been showered upon us, that all the beauty of these almost tropical\r\n  landscapes upon which we have looked, that all the richness of these\r\n  precious mines sink into forgetfulness as I receive to day this\r\n  welcome from my old friends. [Great applause.] My manhood has known\r\n  no other home but this. It was the scene of my early struggles; it\r\n  has been the scene, and you have been the instruments and supporters\r\n  in every success I have achieved in life. I come to lay before you\r\n  to-day my thankful offering for your friendly helpfulness that was\r\n  extended to me as a boy and that has been mine in all the years of\r\n  our intercourse that have intervened until this hour. [Applause.]\r\n  I left you a little more than two years ago to take up the work of\r\n  the most responsible office in the world. I went to these untried\r\n  duties sustained by your helpful friendliness. I come to you again\r\n  after these two years of public office to confess many errors, but to\r\n  say to you that I have had but one thought in my mind. It was to use\r\n  whatever influence had been confided to me for the general good of all\r\n  our people. [Applause.] Our stay to-day is so brief that I must deny\r\n  myself the pleasure I would have in taking these old friends by the\r\n  hand. God bless you all. I have not forgotten, I can never forget,\r\n  Indianapolis. [Prolonged applause.] I look forward to it, if my life\r\n  shall be spared, as the city in which I shall rest when the hard work\r\n  of life is done. I rejoice in its increase, in its development as a\r\n  commercial centre. I love its homes, its people; and now if you will\r\n  pardon me the effort of further speech and believe me when I say this\r\n  is a most interesting and tender moment to me, allow me to say to you\r\n  for a time, God bless you every one and good-by. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, INDIANA, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Richmond, Ind., a very large and enthusiastic assemblage cheered the\r\nPresident. The Reception Committee consisted of Mayor Perry J. Freeman,\r\nHon. Henry U. Johnson, C. C. Binkley, John Harrington, Everett A.\r\nRichey, Andrew F. Scott, J. H. Macke, John H. Nicholson, Col. John F.\r\nMiller, Capt. J. Lee Yaryan, Dr. J. R. Weist, E. D. Palmer, H. C. Starr,\r\nFrank J. Brown, J. B. Howes, and Isaac Jenkins.\r\n\r\nCongressman Johnson introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We are now about completing a very long\r\n  journey. For something more than four weeks we have been speeding\r\n  across the country, from the Potomac to the Golden Gate, and northward\r\n  along Puget Sound. The trip, while it has been full of pleasurable\r\n  incidents, while it has been attended with every demonstration of\r\n  friendliness and respect, has, as you can well understand, been full\r\n  of labor. I began this day--and it is only a sample of many--at 5\r\n  o'clock this morning, by speaking to my fellow-citizens at Hannibal,\r\n  Mo., and from that place to this I have been almost continuously on\r\n  my feet or shaking hands over this platform with friends who had\r\n  gathered there. We have seen regions that were new to me, people that\r\n  were strangers, and yet, throughout the whole of this journey we\r\n  have been pervaded, surrounded, inspired by the magnificent spirit\r\n  of American patriotism. [Cheers.] I come now to pass through my own\r\n  State. I have so often within the last two years been at Indianapolis\r\n  and passed through Richmond that I did not expect you would take any\r\n  special notice of our passage to-night. I am all the more gratified\r\n  that you should have surprised us by this magnificent demonstration.\r\n  As I had occasion to say at Indianapolis, the respect, the confidence,\r\n  the affectionate interest of my Indiana friends is more valuable\r\n  to me than anything else in life. I went from you two years ago to\r\n  new duties, borne down with a sense of the great responsibility\r\n  that was upon me, and I am glad to believe from what I see to-night\r\n  that I have at least saved the respect and friendship of my Indiana\r\n  fellow-citizens. [Cries of \"That's so!\" and cheers.] And now, as\r\n  I return again to labors and duties that are awaiting me, I leave\r\n  with you my most affectionate greeting and sincere desire for the\r\n  prosperity of Indiana and all its citizens. I hope that my life will\r\n  be spared to be once more a dweller in this great State. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAYTON, OHIO, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great assembly, numbering over 10,000 people, greeted the President\r\non arrival at Dayton, Ohio, at 9 o'clock. The veterans of \"The Old\r\nGuard Post\", Parker Rusby Commander, were present in a body; also\r\nmany veterans from Dister Post, Hiram Strong Post, Birch, and Martin\r\nDe Lancy posts, together with a large representation of the Sons of\r\nVeterans. Among the prominent citizens and ladies who received the\r\npresidential party were Mrs. W. D. Bickham, Miss Rebecca Strickel,\r\nCharles and Daniel Bickham, Hon. Ira Crawford, Hon. Washington Silzel,\r\nWm. P. Callahan, Fred G. Withoft, Dr. J. M. Weaver, E. B. Lyon, Dr. J.\r\nS. Beck, C. M. Hassler, A. L. Bauman, Dr. Joseph E. Lowes, B. T. Guion,\r\nHenry Kissinger, Hon. Dennis Dwyer, E. F. Pryor, Charles P. Garman,\r\nD. K. Hassler, Charles Auderton, N. D. Bates, John A. Miller, John\r\nA. Bell, C. Y. Osborn, Joseph S. Crane, Ed. Best, Daniel E. Meade,\r\nSamuel Craighead, Warren Munger, H. C. Harries, G. C. Kennedy, William\r\nCraighead, A. A. Simonds, S. Brenner, D. F. Giddinger, Simon Gebhart,\r\nGeorge La Rue, D. E. McSherry, Charles James John Patterson, Dr. J. A.\r\nWalters, and Rev. Dr. A. A. Willett.\r\n\r\nThe President's appearance was the signal for a prolonged outburst of\r\npatriotic feeling, in recognition and response to which he spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We have journeyed now about nine thousand\r\n  miles, and I have never been, in all this distance, out of sight of an\r\n  Ohio man. [Laughter and cheers.] Everywhere we have journeyed, whether\r\n  in the New South, awakening under the new influences of freedom to\r\n  an industrial life that was not possible under slavery; whether on\r\n  the deserts of Arizona or among the orange groves of California, or\r\n  in one of those wonderful States that have been builded within the\r\n  last few years on Puget Sound, some one, noting the fact that I was\r\n  Ohio-born, would claim kin-ship, and so far as I could judge, in my\r\n  limited observation of them, I think they carried the Ohio faculty\r\n  with them to their new homes of getting their fair share of things.\r\n  [Laughter and cheers.] I do most cordially thank you, citizens of\r\n  Dayton, for this pleasant and friendly demonstration. I cannot talk\r\n  long. This whole journey has been a succession of speeches. I have\r\n  come to think it must be tiresome to you to have one of my speeches\r\n  every morning with your breakfast coffee. [Cries of \"No! no!\" and\r\n  applause.] But it has been a most cheerful thing to me to observe\r\n  everywhere, even in those distant and sparsely settled regions of\r\n  the West, that the American flag was never out of sight. I do not\r\n  think I have ever lost sight of the Stars and Stripes since we left\r\n  Washington. [Cheers.] Several times we have been deeply touched as we\r\n  moved along over the sandy plains to see at some isolated and very\r\n  humble cabin a man or child step to the door and unfurl the Starry\r\n  Banner. [Cheers.] Everywhere I have met comrades of the Grand Army of\r\n  the Republic, everywhere the atmosphere seemed to be pervaded by a\r\n  magnificent spirit of Americanism. [Cheers.] We are one people--one\r\n  in our purposes, aims and lives; one in our fealty to the flag, the\r\n  Constitution, and the indissoluble Union of the States. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Ohio has always maintained a magnificently conspicuous place in the\r\n  sisterhood of the States--peopled, as she was, by the great patriots\r\n  of the Revolutionary period; receiving, as she did, in this great\r\n  basin, that overspill of patriotism that moved toward the West after\r\n  the Revolutionary struggle was ended. She has given to the Government,\r\n  in army life and in the civil service, a magnificent galaxy of great\r\n  men. [Cheers.] In the hope that this journey, which has been full of\r\n  toil, may not prove unprofitable to the people, as it certainly has\r\n  not been unprofitable to me, I leave you to take up my public duties\r\n  with new encouragement and new resolves to do the best I can for all\r\n  the people. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXENIA, OHIO, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly 10 o'clock when the city of Xenia was reached, but a large\r\ncrowd greeted the tired travellers. A reception committee, consisting of\r\nHon. Charles F. Howard, Mayor; Hon. John Little, Hon. N. A. Fulton, Hon.\r\nGeorge Good, Charles L. Spencer, and F. E. James escorted the party from\r\nDayton.\r\n\r\nJudge Little introduced President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I began my day's work at 5 o'clock and have already\r\n  made ten speeches, but I feel that a few spoken words are but small\r\n  return to those who have gathered to express their friendly regard. No\r\n  man is worthy to hold office in this Republic who does not sincerely\r\n  covet the good-will and respect of the people. The people may not\r\n  agree in their views on public questions, but while they have a great\r\n  many points of difference they have more of agreement, and I believe\r\n  we are all pursuing the same great end--the glory of our country, the\r\n  permanency of our institutions, and the general good of our people.\r\n  The springs of all good government--the most important things after\r\n  all--are in the local communities. In the townships, school districts,\r\n  and municipalities, there the utmost care should be taken. If their\r\n  affairs are wisely and economically administered, those of the State\r\n  and the Nation are sure to be. Upon these foundation stones the safety\r\n  of the Nation rests, and I am glad to know that so much careful\r\n  thought is being given to these questions by public men and the people\r\n  generally. Thanking you for your attendance and cordial greeting. I\r\n  bid you good-night. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBUS, OHIO, MAY 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt lacked but fifteen minutes of midnight when the train rolled into\r\nthe Union Depot at Columbus. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour a\r\nfair-sized and enthusiastic crowd was present, including a number of G.\r\nA. R. veterans.\r\n\r\nIn response to repeated calls the President appeared, accompanied by\r\nSecretary Rusk, and said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I left Hannibal, Mo., this morning at 6\r\n  o'clock, and have made twelve speeches to-day. You have been very\r\n  thoughtful to meet us here, and I know you will excuse me if I say\r\n  nothing more than I thank you. Good-night. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA, MAY 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last day of the long journey began with a speech at Altoona at 10\r\no'clock. Superintendent and Mrs. Theodore N. Eby joined the party here.\r\nThe assemblage was a large one and the President shook hands with many\r\nuntil the crowd began calling for a speech.\r\n\r\nPostmaster-General Wanamaker introduced the distinguished traveller,\r\nsaying: \"Outside of Indiana I think the President could not be more at\r\nhome than he is in Pennsylvania, and he requires no introduction.\"\r\n\r\nThe President spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--The book has been closed. I have been talking so much\r\n  while on this trip that I am sure you will excuse me this morning. It\r\n  has been a delightful journey, yet we experienced, perhaps, that which\r\n  is the crowning joy of all trips--getting back home; that is the place\r\n  for us. [Cheers.] I am glad to have this greeting from my Pennsylvania\r\n  friends this morning. Mr. Wanamaker was not far wrong when he said\r\n  that after Indiana Pennsylvania was pretty close to me. It was in\r\n  one of these valleys, not very distant from your political Capitol,\r\n  that my mother was born and reared, and of course this State and this\r\n  section of Pennsylvania has always had a very dear interest for me.\r\n  [Cheers and great noise from steam being blown off at shops.] Of the\r\n  applause that we have enjoyed on this journey our reception here has\r\n  been the most original of all. [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA, MAY 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival at Harrisburg at 1:15 P.M. was heralded by a presidential\r\nsalute, and 10,000 cheers went up as the President emerged on the rear\r\nplatform, accompanied by Secretary Rusk and Postmaster-General Wanamaker.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent citizens who pressed forward to greet the travellers\r\nwas his excellency Governor Pattison, Speaker Thompson, of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, Secretary of the Commonwealth Harrity, Adjutant-General\r\nMcClelland, Hon. B. F. Meyers, Private Secretary Tate, and many members\r\nof the Legislature. The Governor's Troop, commanded by Lieutenant Ott,\r\npresented arms and Bugler Bierbower sounded the President's march as\r\nthe Chief Magistrate appeared. Governor Pattison cordially welcomed the\r\nPresident and presented him to the great assemblage.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison closed his long series of brilliant and interesting\r\naddresses in the following words:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Pattison and Fellow citizens_--I thank you for the\r\n  courtesy of this reception at the political centre of the great\r\n  State of Pennsylvania. I was informed, a little while ago, by the\r\n  stenographer who had accompanied me on this trip, that I had made\r\n  138 speeches, and when I saw the magnitude of my offence against the\r\n  American people I was in hopes I should be permitted to pass through\r\n  Harrisburg without adding anything to it. I will only express my\r\n  thanks and appreciation. No one needs to tell you anything about\r\n  Pennsylvania or its resources; indeed, my work was very much lightened\r\n  on this journey, because I found that all the people clear out to\r\n  Puget Sound had already found out more about their country than I\r\n  could possibly tell them. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It is a pleasant thing that we appreciate our surroundings. We\r\n  love our own home, our own neighborhood, our own State. It would be a\r\n  sad thing if it were not so. There is only just enough discontent to\r\n  keep our people moving a little. Now and then some boy gets restless\r\n  in the homestead and pushes out to the West; the result is a thorough\r\n  mingling of the people. I do not know what would have become of\r\n  Pennsylvania if some people from other States had not come in and\r\n  some of your people gone out. It is this that makes the perfect unity\r\n  of our country. It was delightful on our trip to meet old faces from\r\n  home. Though they had apparently been discontented with Indiana and\r\n  left it, they were willing to recall the fact, as I came near to them,\r\n  that they were Hoosiers. It was very pleasant, also, to see people\r\n  as they met the Postmaster-General put up their hands and say, \"I am\r\n  from the old Keystone State.\" General Rusk was never out of sight of a\r\n  Wisconsin man, and of course the Ohio man was always there. [Laughter\r\n  and applause.] Our journey has been accompanied with the labor of\r\n  travel, but out of it all I think I have a higher sense of the perfect\r\n  unity of our people and of their enduring, all-pervading patriotism.\r\n  [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no demonstration at Baltimore. As the train neared\r\nWashington--on the homestretch of its great run of 9,232 miles--the\r\nPresident gathered all the members of his party about him in the\r\nobservation car, including the train employees and servants, and made\r\na short speech, in which he thanked all who accompanied him for their\r\ncourtesy and attention. He referred to the long journey--without\r\naccident of any kind and without a minute's variance from the\r\nprearranged schedule--as a most remarkable achievement, and paid a high\r\ncompliment to Mr. George W. Boyd, the General Assistant Passenger Agent\r\nof the Pennsylvania Railroad for his successful management of the trip,\r\nadding that it was a superb exhibition of what energy and training could\r\ndo for a man. He then returned his thanks individually to the engineer,\r\nconductor, and every employee.\r\n\r\nThe train reached Washington at 5:30 o'clock, exactly on time to a\r\nfraction of a minute. General Harrison was the first to alight to meet\r\nhis young grandson, Master Benjamin McKee, and the latter's little\r\nsister. There was no unusual demonstration or speech-making. The\r\nPresident was met by Secretaries Foster and Proctor, Attorney-General\r\nMiller, Ass't Atty.-Gen. James N. Tyner, Assistant Secretary Nettleton,\r\nAssistant Secretary Willetts, Major Pruden, and Captain Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, MAY 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Decoration Day, 1891, President Harrison, accompanied by\r\nPostmaster-General Wanamaker, Secretary Proctor, Secretary Tracy,\r\nand Private Secretary Halford, visited Philadelphia as the guests of\r\nGeorge G. Meade Post, No. 1, G. A. R., to participate in their memorial\r\nceremonies. They were met at the station by a committee from the post,\r\ncomprising the following veterans: Post Commander Louis P. Langer,\r\nSenior Vice-Commander Alexander M. Appel, Junior Vice-Commander James\r\nThompson, Adjutant A. C. Johnston, Officer of the Day Robert M. Green,\r\nGuard Charles Harris, Chaplain Rev. I. Newton Ritner, and Past Post\r\nCommanders Henry H. Bingham, Joseph R. C. Ward, George W. Devinny, L. D.\r\nC. Tyler, Alfred J. Sellers, William J. Simpson, James C. Wray, John A.\r\nStevenson, Alexander Reed, Lewis W. Moore, John W. Wiedersheim, Isaiah\r\nPrice, W. Wayne Vogdes, G. Harry Davis, Charles L. Sherman, Henry C.\r\nHarper, Penn Righter, and Isaac R. Oakford. Department Commander George\r\nBoyer and Asst. Adjt.-Gen. Samuel Town were also present to welcome the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. The historic City Troop of cavalry--who, from the\r\nday that General Washington entered Philadelphia to take his second\r\ninaugural oath, have acted as an escort to every President who has\r\nbeen a guest of the city--escorted the President and the committee to\r\nIndependence Hall, where in a brief speech Mayor Stuart, in behalf of\r\nthe city, welcomed the Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nThe President, replying to the address of welcome, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor, Comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic, and\r\n  Fellow-citizens_--I esteem it a great pleasure to stand in this\r\n  historic edifice in this historic city and to take part to-day as a\r\n  comrade of the Grand Army of the Republic in these most interesting\r\n  and instructive exercises, which commemorate events which have been\r\n  most deeply sunk in our hearts. I think it eminently appropriate that\r\n  we should stand for a little time before going to the graves of our\r\n  fallen comrades in this edifice, where the foundations of independence\r\n  were laid and put into development to make this great Nation to-day.\r\n  In my recent extensive trip through the country I was able to see the\r\n  effects of planting these seeds of freedom, in the flourishing plants\r\n  that have grown. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  We are here in a community that was instituted on principles of\r\n  peace and good will among men. But you gave a conspicuous illustration\r\n  of the facts that the fruits of peace need to be protected.\r\n\r\n  You did not all depart from the great lessons taught when you united\r\n  with the comrades from all the other States to hold up the banner of\r\n  the Union and to maintain peace and to perpetuate it at all times. You\r\n  went out to maintain peace, and you have established in the affections\r\n  of all of us the flag of our faith, and the question of submission to\r\n  the Constitution and the law in all States has been settled to the\r\n  contentment of all.\r\n\r\n  I appreciate most highly this welcome, and I take part in these\r\n  exercises with a sense of their fitness and a sense of the greatness\r\n  of the event which they commemorate.\r\n\r\n  I have never been able to think that this day is one for mourning,\r\n  but think that instead of the flag being at half mast it should be at\r\n  the peak. I feel that the comrades whose graves we honor to-day would\r\n  rejoice if they could see where their valor has placed us. I feel that\r\n  the glory of their dying and the glory of their achievement covers all\r\n  grief and has put them on an imperishable roll of honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_At General Meade's Grave._\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the public reception at Independence Hall the\r\nPresident and his party were escorted to Laurel Hill Cemetery, where\r\nthey took part in the ceremonies over the grave of Gen. George G. Meade,\r\nthe hero of Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nAlong the entire line of march to the stand were immense crowds, who\r\ngreeted the President with silent demonstrations of respect.\r\n\r\nThe usual Memorial Day exercises were held, and at their conclusion\r\nCommander Langer said: \"I wish to introduce to you the honored guest of\r\nthe day, Comrade Harrison, the Chief Magistrate of the Nation.\"\r\n\r\nAs the President stepped forward he was heartily cheered. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Commander, Comrades of the Grand Army of the Republic, and\r\n  Fellow-citizens_--I have neither the strength nor the voice adequate\r\n  to any extended speech to-day. I come to you as a comrade to take\r\n  part in the interesting exercises of this Memorial Day. It gives me\r\n  special pleasure to combine with that tribute which I have usually\r\n  been able to pay since this day was instituted to the dead of all\r\n  our armies a special mark of respect to that great soldier who won\r\n  Gettysburg. It is impossible to separate some impressions of sorrow\r\n  from these exercises, for they bring to memory comrades who have gone\r\n  from us. How vividly there comes to my memory many battle scenes; not\r\n  the impetuous rush of conflict, but the hour of sadness that followed\r\n  victory. Then it was our sad duty to gather from the field the bodies\r\n  of those who had given the last pledge of loyalty.\r\n\r\n  There is open to my vision more than one yawning trench in which we\r\n  laid the dead of the old brigade. We laid them, elbow touching elbow,\r\n  in the order in which they had stood in the line of battle. We left\r\n  them in the hasty sepulchre and marched on. Now we rejoice that a\r\n  grateful Government has gathered together the scattered dust of all\r\n  these comrades and placed them in beautiful and safe places of honor\r\n  and repose. I cannot but feel that if they could speak to us to-day\r\n  they would say put the flag at the top of the mast.\r\n\r\n  I have recently returned from an extended tour of the States, and\r\n  nothing so impressed and refreshed me as the universal display of\r\n  this banner of beauty and glory. It waved over every school-house, it\r\n  was in the hands of the school children. As we sped across the sandy\r\n  wastes at some solitary house a man, a woman, a child would come to\r\n  the door and wave it in loyal greeting. Two years ago I saw a sight\r\n  that has ever been present in my memory. As we were going out of the\r\n  harbor of Newport about midnight on a dark night some of the officers\r\n  of the torpedo station had prepared for us a beautiful surprise. The\r\n  flag at the top of the station was unseen in the darkness of the\r\n  night, when suddenly electric search-lights were turned on it, bathing\r\n  it in a flood of light.\r\n\r\n  All below the flag was hidden, and it seemed to have no touch with\r\n  earth, but to hang from the battlements of heaven. It was as if Heaven\r\n  was approving the human liberty and human equality typified by that\r\n  flag.\r\n\r\n  Let us take on this occasion a new draught of courage, make new\r\n  vows of consecration, for, my countrymen, it was not because it was\r\n  inconvenient that the rebel States should go, not that it spoiled the\r\n  autonomy of the country, but because it was unlawful that all this\r\n  sacrifice had to be made, to bring them back to their allegiance.\r\n  Let us not forget that as good citizens and good patriots it is our\r\n  duty always to obey the law and to give it our loyal support and\r\n  insist that every one else shall do so. There is no more mischievous\r\n  suggestion made than that the soldiers of the Union Army desire to lay\r\n  any yoke on those who fought against us other than the yoke of the\r\n  law. We cannot ask less than that in all relations they shall obey\r\n  the law, and that they shall yield to every other man his full rights\r\n  under the law.\r\n\r\n  I thank you for the pleasure of participating in these exercises\r\n  with you to-day, and give you a comrade's best wishes and a comrade's\r\n  good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BENNINGTON TRIP, AUGUST, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, August 18, President Harrison left Cape May Point on a\r\njourney to Bennington, to participate in the dedication of Bennington\r\nBattle Monument. He was accompanied by Private Secretary Halford,\r\nRussell B. Harrison, Mr. Howard Cale, of Indianapolis, and George W.\r\nBoyd, of the Pennsylvania Company. The trip through New Jersey was\r\nuneventful. At Vineland, Glassboro, Camden, Trenton, and Burlington\r\ncrowds greeted the President, but as it was raining there was no\r\nspeech-making. At Jersey City the party was joined by John A. Sleicher,\r\nW. J. Arkell, and E. F. Tibbott, the President's stenographer.\r\n\r\nLeaving New York at noon the first stop was at Cornwall, where the\r\nPresident was heartily welcomed by a large crowd and bowed his\r\nacknowledgments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWBURGH, NEW YORK, AUGUST 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather cleared as the party reached historic Newburgh, where 3,000\r\npeople gave the Chief Executive a rousing welcome. Hon. M. Doyle, Mayor\r\nof Newburgh, and the following representative citizens received the\r\nPresident: Ex-Mayor B. B. Odell, Hon. A. S. Cassedy, Hon. B. B. Odell,\r\nJr., William G. Taggart, Daniel S. Waring, William Chambers, Charles H.\r\nHasbrouck, J. M. Dickey, Henry B. Lawson, James G. Graham, Thomas R.\r\nSpier, A. E. Layman, George Hasting, Maj. E. C. Boynton, A. Woolsey,\r\nJohn F. Tucker, William Lynn, George Brown, Dr. D. L. Kidd, H. C. Smith,\r\nAugustus Denniston, E. M. Murtfeldt, and John J. Nutt.\r\n\r\nColonel Sleicher introduced President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I am very much obliged to you for this\r\n  friendly greeting. It is pleasant to run out of the rain and mist\r\n  that have hung about our train for an hour or two into this bright\r\n  sunshine and into the gladness of the pleasant welcome which you have\r\n  extended to us. You are situated here in a region full of historic\r\n  interest. Every child learns early here the story of the sacrifice and\r\n  courage of those who laid the foundation of this Government, which\r\n  has grown beyond the conception of even the wisest of our fathers. I\r\n  am sure that in these things you must all find inspiration to good\r\n  citizenship, and it is pleasant to know that you rejoice that it has\r\n  left its impress upon the hearts of all our people; that upon the\r\n  Sacramento as well as upon the Hudson men love the old memories and\r\n  the old flag. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to pause with you a moment in passing to the observance\r\n  in Vermont of one of those great battle events which led to the\r\n  independence of our country. We have great common interests as a\r\n  people, and, while we divide as to the method by which we would\r\n  promote the national prosperity, I am sure we are all devoted in heart\r\n  to the country and the institutions that have done so much for us. In\r\n  the interest of good government we are one; we all believe that the\r\n  Government should be so administered that all the people shall share\r\n  equally in its benefits; that there shall be no favored class. I thank\r\n  you again, and bid you good-by. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGSTON, NEW YORK, AUGUST 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Kingston fully 2,000 people were assembled. Prominent among those who\r\nwelcomed the President were Hon. James G. Linsley, Hon. Geo. M. Brink,\r\nH. W. Baldwin, William D. Brinnier, D. C. Overbaugh, S. B. Sharpe, B. J.\r\nWinnie, Charles B. Safford, George B. Merritt, O. P. Carpenter, James E.\r\nPhinney, and Noah Wolven.\r\n\r\nAfter shaking hands for several minutes, Hon. William H. Turner\r\nintroduced President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--Perhaps I had better spend the moment or two\r\n  that remains in saying a word to all of you than in shaking hands\r\n  with the few that can gather about the car. You ask for a speech. It\r\n  is not very easy to know what one can talk about on such an occasion\r\n  as this. Those topics that are most familiar to me, because I am\r\n  brought in daily contact with them, namely, public affairs, are in\r\n  some measure prohibited to me, and I must speak therefore only of\r\n  those things upon which we agree; for I have no doubt, if we were\r\n  closely interrogated, some differences would develop in the views\r\n  of those assembled here. That is one of the things we are proud of\r\n  and that tend to the perpetuity and purity of our institutions--that\r\n  we are permitted to differ in our views, to be independent in our\r\n  opinions, and to be answerable to our consciences and to God only for\r\n  the convictions we entertain. I am sure, however, we all rejoice in\r\n  the evidences of prosperity which are spread over this good land of\r\n  ours. We rejoice in the freedom and happiness and contentment that are\r\n  in our communities and in our homes. We rejoice to know that no cloud\r\n  is over our horizon; that we are at peace with the world and at peace\r\n  among ourselves. I think the world has come to understand that it is\r\n  well to be at peace with us [applause], and I am sure we have come\r\n  to understand that it is very well to be at peace among our selves.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Our situation is one of great favor. We are pretty widely separated\r\n  from those who would hurt us, if there are any such. We are secure\r\n  in our great isolation, and we are secure, too, in our great and\r\n  patriotic people. [Applause.] We do not maintain armies; we do not\r\n  need to extend the conscription list until it takes old age and youth.\r\n  We maintain only the merest skeleton of an army, but we have already\r\n  seen how speedily it may develop into gigantic proportions, and how,\r\n  in a few months, it may take on the discipline that makes it the equal\r\n  of any of the great armies of the world. [Applause.] We have this year\r\n  a season of unusual productiveness. The orchards are laden with fruit,\r\n  the gardens yield their abundant supplies to the table, and the fields\r\n  have produced crops that are too great for our storehouses.\r\n\r\n  God has greatly blessed us, and it happens that this season of our\r\n  abundance is not only good for us, but for the world; for again, as\r\n  many times before, the nations of Europe, by reason of crop failures,\r\n  must look to us to feed their people. We have a great surplus and an\r\n  assorted market for it. Our riches must be greatly increased as the\r\n  result of two magnificent harvests. Their good effects will be felt\r\n  in every home, contentment upon the farm, and well-paid labor in all\r\n  our cities and centres of manufacture. Thus it should be. Thus, I am\r\n  sure, we all rejoice that it is, because these institutions of ours\r\n  can have no danger except in a discontented citizenship. As long as\r\n  men have a free and equal chance, as long as the labor of their hands\r\n  may bring the needed supplies into the household, as long as there are\r\n  open avenues of hope and advancement to the children they love, men\r\n  are contented--they are good, loyal, American citizens. [Applause.]\r\n  And now I thank you again for your kindness. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALBANY, NEW YORK, AUGUST 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was 6 o'clock in the afternoon when the President arrived at Albany,\r\nduring a heavy rain. In anticipation of this visit from the head of the\r\nNation, the following telegraphic correspondence had passed between the\r\ncourteous Governor of New York and President Harrison:\r\n\r\n                                                  ALBANY, August 12.\r\n  HON. BENJAMIN HARRISON, _Cape May, N. J._:\r\n\r\n  I learn for the first time to-day that you have accepted the\r\n  invitation of Mayor Manning to stop at Albany on your way to Vermont.\r\n  If the plan of your journey will enable you to pass a night in Albany,\r\n  as I hope it may, I shall be pleased to have yourself and party become\r\n  my guests at the Executive Mansion. Personally, as well as officially,\r\n  I assure you it gives me great pleasure to extend this invitation, and\r\n  I sincerely trust that you will so arrange your plans as to give me\r\n  the opportunity of entertaining you. The Executive Mansion is ample\r\n  for the accommodation of such members of your Cabinet or friends as\r\n  may accompany you. On behalf of the people of the State, also, I shall\r\n  be pleased to tender you a public reception at the State Capitol.\r\n\r\n                                                      DAVID B. HILL.\r\n\r\n                                STOCKTON HOUSE, CAPE MAY, August 12.\r\n  GOV. D. B. HILL, _Albany_:\r\n\r\n  I am very much obliged for your very cordial invitation, but it\r\n  will be only possible for me to make a brief stay at Albany. How\r\n  long depends upon the railroad schedule, not yet communicated to me.\r\n  As soon as details are arranged will advise you. For such time as\r\n  I can spare I will place myself in the hands of the city and State\r\n  authorities.\r\n\r\n                                                  BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n\r\nThe following prominent citizens of Albany met the President at Selkirk\r\nand escorted him to the city: James Ten Eyck, Chairman; Col. A. E.\r\nMather, John G. Myers, James M. Warner, Henry C. Nevitt, and William\r\nBarnes. Among others who greeted the President on his arrival were\r\nCapt. John Palmer, Commander-in-Chief of the G. A. R., Hon. Simon W.\r\nRosendale, Deputy Controller Westbrook, H. N. Fuller, C. B. Templeton,\r\nWilliam H. Cull, and Oscar Smith.\r\n\r\nThe reception was held in City Hall Square, where many thousand\r\nAlbanians assembled. On the platform Governor Hill, Mayor Manning, with\r\nthe Common Council, Secretary of State Rice, State Treasurer Danforth,\r\nand other State and municipal officers were gathered. The President\r\nreceived an ovation as he approached the stand. Mayor Manning welcomed\r\nhim in the name of the city and presented Governor Hill, who extended to\r\nthe Chief Magistrate a broader welcome in the name of the people of the\r\nEmpire State.\r\n\r\nResponding to these hospitable addresses, the President said:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Hill, Mr. Mayor, and Fellow-citizens_--The conditions\r\n  of the evening, these threatening and even dripping clouds, are not\r\n  favorable to any extended speech. I receive with great gratification\r\n  the very cordial expressions which have fallen from the lips of his\r\n  excellency, the Governor of this great State, and of his honor,\r\n  the Mayor of this great municipality. It is very gratifying to me\r\n  to be thus assured that as American citizens, as public officers\r\n  administering each different functions in connection with the\r\n  government of the Nation, of the State, and of the municipality, we,\r\n  in common with this great body of citizens, whose servants we all\r\n  are, have that common love for our institutions, and that common\r\n  respect for those who, by the appointed constitutional methods, have\r\n  been chosen to administer them, as on such occasions as this entirely\r\n  obliterates all differences and brings us together in the great and\r\n  enduring brotherhood of American citizens. [Prolonged cheering.]\r\n\r\n  This great capital of a great State I have had the pleasure of\r\n  visiting once or twice before. I have many times visited your\r\n  commercial capital, and have traversed in many directions the great\r\n  and prosperous Empire State. You have concentrated here great wealth\r\n  and great productive capacity for increased wealth, great financial\r\n  institutions that reach out in their influences and effects over\r\n  the whole land. You have great prosperity and great responsibility.\r\n  The general Government is charged with certain great functions in\r\n  which the people have a general interest. Among these is the duty\r\n  of providing for our people the money with which its business\r\n  transactions are conducted. There has sometimes been in some regions\r\n  of the great West a thought that New York, being largely a creditor\r\n  State, was disposed to be a little hard with the debtor communities\r\n  of the great West; but, my fellow-citizens, narrow views ought not to\r\n  prevail with them or with you and will not in the light of friendly\r\n  discussion. The law of commerce may be selfishness, but the law of\r\n  statesmanship should be broader and more liberal. I do not intend to\r\n  enter upon any subject that can excite division; but I do believe that\r\n  the general Government is solemnly charged with the duty of seeing\r\n  that the money issued by it is always and everywhere maintained at\r\n  par. I believe that I speak that which is the common thought of us all\r\n  when I say that every dollar, whether paper or coin, issued or stamped\r\n  by the general Government should always and everywhere be as good as\r\n  any other dollar. I am sure that we would all shun that condition of\r\n  things into which many peoples of the past have drifted, and of which\r\n  we have had in one of the great South American countries a recent\r\n  example--the distressed and hopeless condition into which all business\r\n  enterprise falls, when a nation issues an irredeemable or depreciated\r\n  money. The necessities of a great war can excuse that.\r\n\r\n  I am one of those that believe that these men from your shops, these\r\n  farmers remote from money centres, have the largest interest of all\r\n  people in the world in having a dollar that is worth one hundred cents\r\n  every day in the year, and only such. If by any chance we should fall\r\n  into a condition where one dollar is not so good as another I venture\r\n  the assertion that that poorer dollar will do its first errand in\r\n  paying some poor laborer for his work. Therefore, in the conduct of\r\n  our public affairs I feel pledged, for one, that all the influences of\r\n  the Government should be on the side of giving the people only good\r\n  money and just as much of that kind as we can get. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  Now, my fellow-citizens, we have this year a most abundant, yes,\r\n  extraordinary, grain crop. All of the great staples have been yielded\r\n  to the labor of the farmer in a larger measure than ever before. A\r\n  leading agricultural paper estimated that the produce of our farms\r\n  will be worth $1,000,000,000 more this year than ever before, and\r\n  it happens that just with this great surplus in our barns we find\r\n  a scarcity in all the countries of Europe. Russia has recently\r\n  prohibited the export of rye, because she needs her crop to feed her\r\n  own people. The demands in France and in England and Germany will\r\n  absorb every bushel of the great surplus we shall have after our\r\n  people are fed, and, whatever complaints there may have been in the\r\n  past, I believe this year will spread a smile of gladness over the\r\n  entire agricultural population of our country.\r\n\r\n  This is our opportunity, and I cannot see how it shall be possible\r\n  but that these exports of grain, now reaching the limit of the\r\n  capacity of our railroads and of our ships, shall soon bring back to\r\n  us the lost gold we sent to Europe and more that we did not lose. I\r\n  was told by an officer of the West Shore road to-day that that road\r\n  alone was carrying 100,000 bushels of wheat every day into New York,\r\n  and that it scarcely stopped an hour in the elevator, but was run\r\n  immediately into the bottom of a steam vessel that was to carry it\r\n  abroad. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  This is only an illustration of what is going on. As the result\r\n  of it our people must be greatly enriched. Where there has been\r\n  complaint, where there has been poverty, there must come this year\r\n  plenty, for the gardens have loaded the table, the orchards cannot\r\n  bear the burdens that hang upon their reddening limbs, and the\r\n  granaries are not equal to the product of our fields. We ought,\r\n  then, this day to be a happy people. We ought to be grateful for\r\n  these conditions and careful everywhere to add to them the virtue\r\n  of patience, frugality, love of order, and, to crown all, a great\r\n  patriotism and devotion to the Constitution and the law--always our\r\n  rule of conduct as citizens. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  My fellow-citizens, it is very difficult to speak in this heavy\r\n  atmosphere. I beg, therefore, that you will allow me to thank you for\r\n  your friendly demonstration, and bid you good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROY, NEW YORK, AUGUST 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the special train reached Troy in the evening an immense throng\r\ngreeted the President. It was the noisiest demonstration of the day.\r\nGeneral Harrison shook hands with hundreds, many of them working men\r\njust from the shops. The following prominent Trojans composed the\r\nCommittee of Reception and escorted the party from Albany: Gen. Joseph\r\nB. Carr, Charles W. Tillinghast, William Kemp, Thomas Dickson, F. N.\r\nMann, William H. Hollister Jr., Col. Lee Chamberlin, John I. Thompson,\r\nCol. Arthur MacArthur, D. S. Hasbrouck, Samuel Morris, James H. Potts,\r\nJ. F. Bridgeman, C. L. Fuller, T. J. O'Sullivan, Cornelius Hannan,\r\nHenry McMillen, H. M. Reynolds, George H. Mead, Dr. C. B. Herrick, and\r\nWilliam Kemp, Jr. The veterans of Willard Post G. A. R., under Commander\r\nLeet, participated in the reception.\r\n\r\nEx-Mayor Wm. Kemp made the address of welcome in the unavoidable\r\nabsence of Mayor Whelan. Midst great enthusiasm and cheers General Carr\r\nintroduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--I attempted a little while ago to speak in Albany in\r\n  this damp atmosphere, and find my voice is so much roughened by the\r\n  effort that I can hardly hope to make myself heard by you. I am glad\r\n  to have the opportunity to pause some moments in the city of Troy,\r\n  to look into the faces of its industrious and thrifty population.\r\n  I have long known of your city as a city of industry--as a great\r\n  manufacturing city--sending out its products to all the land, and by\r\n  the skill of its workmen and the integrity of its merchants finding\r\n  everywhere a market for wares kept up to the standard. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe President was here interrupted by the blowing of steam-whistles, and\r\ncontinued, smiling:\r\n\r\n  I am quite used to having my speeches punctuated by steam-whistles.\r\n  I am sure that you realize here in a large degree the benefit of\r\n  a policy that keeps the American market for the American workmen.\r\n  [Cries of \"Good!\" and applause.] I try to be broadly philanthropic in\r\n  my thoughts about the human race, but cannot help thinking that an\r\n  American workman has a stronger claim on my sympathy and help than any\r\n  other workman. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I believe that our institutions are only safe while we have\r\n  intelligent and contented working classes. I would adopt\r\n  constitutional methods--any administrative method--that would\r\n  preserve this country from the condition into which some others\r\n  have unfortunately fallen, where a hard day's work does not bring\r\n  sustenance for the workman and his family. [Applause.] I would be glad\r\n  if there were not a home in Troy--not a home in the United States of\r\n  America--where there was not plenty for man and wife and child; where\r\n  there was not only sustenance, but a margin of saving that might make\r\n  the old age of the husband and wife and the life of the children\r\n  easier than this generation has been. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENNINGTON, VERMONT, AUGUST 19.\r\n\r\n_Dedication of the Battle Monument._\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison and his party reached North Bennington at 8 o'clock\r\non the night of the eighteenth. He was met by the following Committee of\r\nReception on the part of the city of Bennington: Gen. J. G. McCullough,\r\nM. S. Colburn, J. V. Carney, S. B. Hall, and A. P. Childs; also, Dr.\r\nWilliam Seward Webb, and Col. Geo. W. Hooker, representing the State\r\nEntertainment Committee. As the President appeared he was greeted with\r\nrousing cheers by the large crowd and escorted to the residence of\r\nGeneral McCullough, whose guest he was.\r\n\r\nThe following morning the distinguished visitors reviewed the grand\r\nparade in honor of the centenary of the admission of Vermont into\r\nthe Union and the dedication of the Bennington Battle Monument.\r\nCol. W. Seward Webb, President-General of the Sons of the American\r\nRevolution, accompanied by a mounted Grand Army Post, escorted President\r\nHarrison to the Soldiers' Home, where Gov. Carroll S. Page and all\r\nthe living ex-Governors of Vermont greeted him. The presidential\r\nparty to review the parade consisted of sixty guests of the State,\r\nand included Secretary of War Proctor, Attorney-General Miller, Gen.\r\nO. O. Howard, Governor Russell, of Massachusetts; Governor Tuttle,\r\nof New Hampshire; Senator Henry L. Dawes and ex-Gov. A. H. Rice, of\r\nMassachusetts; Senators Edmunds and Morrill; Senators Wm. E. Chandler\r\nand J. H. Gallinger, of New Hampshire; Congressmen Grout and Powers;\r\nAdjutant-General Ayling and Hon. John King, of New York.\r\n\r\nThe parade was the most brilliant and imposing ever seen in the State. A\r\nfeature of the decorations was a magnificent triumphal arch, the turrets\r\nand embrasures of which were filled with young maidens clad in brilliant\r\ncolors, while on the top of the arch were 125 little girls dressed\r\nin white, with flowing hair, singing patriotic songs. In the loftiest\r\nturret was a gorgeous throne of gold, occupied by Miss Lillie Adams,\r\npersonating the Goddess of Liberty.\r\n\r\nAfter the review the presidential party was escorted to the grand stand\r\nat the monument, where 15,000 people assembled.\r\n\r\nThe battle monument is a plain, square shaft of magnesian limestone\r\n302 feet high. The interior at the base is 22 feet square and has a\r\nstairway. It was built under the supervision of the Trustees of the\r\nBennington Battle Monument Association. The Building Committee comprised\r\nGen. John G. McCullough, H. G. Root, A. B. Valentine, M. C. Huling, and\r\nL. F. Abbott.\r\n\r\nGen. Wheelock G. Veazey was President of the Day, and introduced Rev.\r\nDr. Charles Parkhurst, of Boston, who opened the dedicatory exercises\r\nwith prayer. Governor Page delivered the address of welcome, and\r\nwas followed by ex-Gov. B. F. Prescott, of New Hampshire, President\r\nof the Bennington Battle Monument Association, who transferred the\r\nmonument to the care and keeping of Vermont. Hon. Edward J. Phelps,\r\nthe chosen orator of the occasion, then delivered a historical and\r\nscholarly address, which was listened to with marked attention by his\r\ndistinguished audience.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Phelps' oration Chairman Veazey introduced\r\nPresident Harrison, who arose midst prolonged cheers and spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Fellow-citizens_--There are several obvious\r\n  reasons why I should not attempt to speak to you at this time.\r\n  This great audience is so uncomfortably situated that a further\r\n  prolongation of these exercises cannot be desirable, but the stronger\r\n  reason is that you have just listened with rapt attention to a most\r\n  scholarly and interesting review of those historical incidents which\r\n  have suggested this assemblage and to those lessons which they furnish\r\n  to thoughtful and patriotic men. [Applause.] A son of Vermont honored\r\n  by his fellow-citizens, honored by the Nation which he has served in\r\n  distinguished public functions, honored by the profession of which he\r\n  is an ornament and an instructor, has spoken for Vermont [applause];\r\n  and it does not seem to me fit that these golden sentences should be\r\n  marred by any extemporaneous words which I can add. I come to you\r\n  under circumstances that altogether forbid preparation. I have no\r\n  other preparation for speech than this inspiring cup of good-will\r\n  which you have presented to my lips. [Applause.] The most cordial\r\n  welcome which has been extended to me to-day makes it unfitting that\r\n  I should omit to make a cordial acknowledgment of it. Perhaps I may\r\n  be permitted, as a citizen of a Western State, to give expression to\r\n  the high regard and honor in which Vermont is held. Perhaps I may\r\n  assume, as a public officer representing in some sense all the States\r\n  of the Union, to bring to-day their appreciation of the history and\r\n  people of this patriotic State. Its history is unique, as Mr. Phelps\r\n  has said. The other colonies staked their lives, their fortunes and\r\n  honor upon the struggle for independence, with the assurance that\r\n  if, by their valor and sacrifice, independence was achieved, all\r\n  these were assured. The inhabitants of the New Hampshire grants alone\r\n  fought with their fellow-countrymen of the colonies for liberty, for\r\n  political independence, unknowing whether, when it had been achieved,\r\n  the property, the homes upon which they dwelt, would be assured by\r\n  the success of the confederate colonies. They could not know--they\r\n  had the gravest reason to fear--that when the authority of the\r\n  confederation of the States had been established this very Government,\r\n  to whose supremacy Vermont had so nobly contributed, might lend its\r\n  authority to the establishment of the claims of New York upon their\r\n  homes; and yet, in all this story, though security of property would\r\n  undoubtedly have been pledged by the royal representative, Vermont\r\n  took a conspicuous, unselfish, and glorious part in achieving the\r\n  independence of the united colonies, trusting to the justice of her\r\n  cause for the ultimate security of the homes of her people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is a most noble and unmatched history; and if I may deliver the\r\n  message of Indiana as a citizen of that State, and as a public officer\r\n  the message of all the States, I came to say, \"Worthy Vermont!\"\r\n  [Cheers]. She has kept the faith unfalteringly from Bennington\r\n  until this day. She has added, in war and peace, many illustrious\r\n  names to our roll of military heroes and of great statesmen. Her\r\n  representation in the national Congress, as it has been known to\r\n  me, has been conspicuous for its influence, for the position it has\r\n  assumed in committee and in debate, and, so far as I can recall, has\r\n  been without personal reproach. [Cheers] We have occasionally come to\r\n  Vermont with a call that did not originate with her people, and those\r\n  have been answered with the same pure, high consecration to public\r\n  duty as has been the case with those who have been chosen by your\r\n  suffrages to represent the State, and I found when the difficult task\r\n  of arranging a Cabinet was devolved upon me that I could not get along\r\n  without a Vermont stick in it [laughter and applause], and I am sure\r\n  you have plenty of timber left in each of the great political parties.\r\n  [Cheers.] The participation of this State in the War of the Rebellion\r\n  was magnificent. Her troops took to the fields of the South that high\r\n  consecration to liberty which had characterized their fathers in the\r\n  Revolutionary struggle. [Applause.] They did not forget, on the hot\r\n  savannas of the South, the green tops of these hills, ever in their\r\n  vision, lifting up their hearts in faith that God would again bring\r\n  the good cause of freedom to a just issue. [Applause.] We are to-day\r\n  approaching the conclusion of a summer of extraordinary fruitfulness.\r\n  How insignificant the stores that were gathered at Bennington in 1777\r\n  compared with these great storehouses bursting with fulness to-day!\r\n  Our excess meets the deficiency of Europe, and a ready market is\r\n  offered for all our cereals. We shall grow richer by contributions\r\n  which other countries shall make as they take from our storehouses\r\n  the food needed to sustain their people. But after all, it is not\r\n  the census tables of production or of wealth that tell the story of\r\n  the greatness of this country. Vermont has not been one of the rich\r\n  States of the Union in gold and silver, and its lands have not given\r\n  the returns that some of the fertile riversides of the West yield.\r\n  There has been here constant effort and honest toil; but out of all\r\n  this there has been brought a sturdy manhood, which is better than\r\n  riches, on which, rather than to wealth, the security of our country\r\n  rests. [Applause.] I beg you to accept my sincere thanks again for the\r\n  evidence of your friendliness, and my apology that the conditions are\r\n  not such as to enable me to speak as I could wish. [Cheers]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Banquet in the Tent._\r\n\r\nAt 4 o'clock the President's party and the State's invited guests were\r\nentertained at a banquet spread in a mammoth tent. The ladies of the\r\nparty were seated in front of the President. Among the notable ladies\r\npresent were the wives of General Alger and Attorney-General Miller,\r\nMrs. E. J. Phelps, Mrs. H. H. Baxter, Mrs. A. F. Walker, Mrs. Horatio\r\nLoomis, Mrs. W. G. Veazey, and the wives of ex-Governor Ormsbee and Gen.\r\nL. G. Kingsley, Miss Roberts, Miss Brown, Miss Ormsbee, the wife of\r\nSenator Morrill, Mrs. B. B. Smalley, the wives of ex-Governors Farnham\r\nand Pingree, and of Auditor Towell. President Harrison was seated\r\nbetween Governor Page and Secretary Proctor.\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished guests--other than those previously\r\nenumerated--were Justice Blatchford, of the Supreme Court; Gen. Russell\r\nA. Alger; Gen. Alexander S. Webb, of New York; Col. A. F. Walker, of\r\nChicago; Speaker W. E. Barrett, Massachusetts; Col. Albert Clarke,\r\nBoston; Maj.-Gen. J. M. Warner, of Albany; John King, President Erie\r\nRailway; H. W. Bruce, Kentucky; ex-Gov. R. S. Green, New Jersey; Hon.\r\nB. B. Smalley, Dr. E. H. Doty, Asa B. Gardner, Maj.-Gen. William Walls;\r\nSurg.-Gen. J. C. Rutherford and Quartermaster-General W. H. Gilmore,\r\nof Vermont, F. B. Barrett and L. L. Tarbell, Massachusetts; Col. H. C.\r\nCutler, Col. M. J. Horton, Col. W. H. H. Slack, and Col. H. F. Brigham,\r\nof Governor Page's staff. The following ex-Governors of Vermont were\r\npresent: J. W. Stewart, Barstow, Pingree, Farnham, and E. J. Ormsbee.\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was upon an extraordinary scale, inasmuch as over\r\n3,500 persons were seated at the banquet tables at one time, and 16,000\r\npieces of figured china were used, while the President's table was\r\nprovided with a dinner service of rare Sèvres and old Delft ware.\r\n\r\nGeneral Veazey, the President of the Committee, again introduced\r\nPresident Harrison, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Fellow-citizens_--Whatever temporary injury my\r\n  voice has suffered was not at the hands of Vermont. [Laughter and\r\n  applause.] New York is responsible. In Albany I spoke in the rain to a\r\n  large assemblage. Perhaps, if it were worth while to trace this vocal\r\n  infirmity further, I might find its origin at Cape May [laughter],\r\n  for I think I started upon this trip with the elements of a cold that\r\n  has to some degree marred the pleasure which I had anticipated to-day.\r\n  But, notwithstanding what my friend, General Veazey, has described\r\n  as \"the dilapidated condition\" of my voice, I will respond to his\r\n  request to say a word to you. I know that General Veazey had been\r\n  put in charge of the transportation lines of the country; but I did\r\n  not expect to find him in charge of what the boys used to call the\r\n  \"cracker line.\" [Laughter.] It seems that his capacity for usefulness\r\n  in the public service is so great and so diversified that you have\r\n  called upon him to conduct the exercises of this magnificent occasion.\r\n  He is a most excellent Interstate Commerce Commissioner [applause], an\r\n  honor to your State, and I have no criticism of him as President of\r\n  the day, except that he calls too much attention to me. [Laughter and\r\n  applause.]\r\n\r\n  This scene, these tables so bountifully and so tastefully spread,\r\n  was one full of beauty when we entered, but it seems now to have\r\n  taken on some of that \"dilapidation\" which General Veazey ascribed\r\n  to my voice. [Laughter.] I am sure that if the supplies gathered at\r\n  Bennington to-day had been here in 1777 that struggle would have been\r\n  much more obstinate. [Laughter.] But, my fellow-citizens, there is\r\n  much in this occasion that is full of instruction to the strangers\r\n  who by your hospitable invitation have the privilege of meeting with\r\n  you. Wherever men may have been born within this galaxy of great\r\n  States, which makes the greater Union, there is respect and honor\r\n  for the New England character. It has been a source of strength to\r\n  the Nation in its development in material things. It has furnished\r\n  to literature and to invention some of the largest contributions;\r\n  but, more than all this, it has done a great work for all the States,\r\n  and especially those States of the West and Northwest, in which its\r\n  enterprising sons have found new homes, in establishing everywhere a\r\n  love of social order and a patriotic devotion to the Union of States.\r\n  [Applause.] If we seek to find the institutions of New England that\r\n  have formed the character of its own people and have exercised a\r\n  stronger moulding influence than that of any other section upon our\r\n  whole people we shall find them, I think, in their temples, in their\r\n  schools, in their town meetings and in their God-fearing homes.\r\n  [Applause.] The courage of those who fought at Bennington, at Concord,\r\n  Lexington, Bunker Hill, and Saratoga was born of a high trust in God.\r\n  They were men who, fearing God, had naught else to fear. That devotion\r\n  to local self-government which originated and for so long maintained\r\n  the town meeting, establishing and perpetuating a true democracy, an\r\n  equal, full participation and responsibility in all public affairs\r\n  on the part of every citizen, was the cause of the development of\r\n  the love of social order and respect for law which has characterized\r\n  your communities, has made them safe and commemorable abodes for\r\n  your people. These migrations between the States have been to your\r\n  loss, but there is now a turning back to these States of New England\r\n  and to some of its unused farms, which I believe is to continue and\r\n  increase. The migration which you have sent into the South to develop\r\n  its industries, to open its mines, to set up factories and furnaces,\r\n  is doing marvellous work in unifying our people. [Applause.] As I\r\n  journeyed recently across the continent this oneness of our people was\r\n  strongly impressed upon me. I think these centennial observances which\r\n  have crowded one upon another from Concord to the centennial of the\r\n  adoption of the Constitution and the organization of the Supreme Court\r\n  have turned the thought of our people to the most inspiring incident\r\n  in our history, and have greatly intensified and developed our love\r\n  of the flag and our Constitution. [Applause.] I do not believe there\r\n  has been a time in our history when there has been a deeper, fonder\r\n  love for the unity of the States, for the flag that emblematizes this\r\n  unity, and for the Constitution which cements it. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I believe we have come to a time when we may look out to greater\r\n  things. Secure in our own institutions, enriched almost beyond\r\n  calculation, I believe we have reached a time when we may take a large\r\n  part in the great transactions of the world. [Cheers.] I believe\r\n  our people are prepared now to insist that the American flag shall\r\n  again be seen upon the sea [applause], and that our merchants and\r\n  manufacturers are ready to seize the golden opportunity that is now\r\n  offered for extending our commerce into the States of Central and\r\n  South America. [Cheers.] I believe that conservative views of finance\r\n  will prevail in this country. [Applause.] I am sure discontent and\r\n  temporary distress will not tempt our people to forsake those safe\r\n  lines of public administration in which commercial security alone\r\n  rests. [Applause.] As long as the general Government furnishes the\r\n  money of the people for their great business transactions I believe\r\n  we will insist, as I have said before, that every dollar issued,\r\n  whether paper or coin, shall be as good and be kept as good as any\r\n  other dollar that issues. [Cheers.] The purity, the equality of what\r\n  we call dollars must be preserved, or an element of uncertainty and\r\n  of bankruptcy will be introduced into all business transactions. This\r\n  I may say without crossing lines of division: How this end is to be\r\n  attained I will not attempt to sketch, but I do not hesitate to say\r\n  that I feel myself, in the public interest, pledged so far as in me\r\n  lies to maintain that equality between our circulating money that is\r\n  essential to the perfect use of all. [Prolonged applause.]\r\n\r\n  I have gone beyond the promise of the President of the day, and have\r\n  been betrayed by your friendliness into speaking two or three words.\r\n  May I, in closing, tender to these good women of Vermont my thanks\r\n  for the grace and sweetness which their services and their presence\r\n  have lent to this happy occasion? May I say to them that the devoted\r\n  services of their mothers, their courage and patience and helpfulness\r\n  shown by the women in the great struggle for liberty cannot be too\r\n  highly appreciated? It was an easier fate to march with bared breasts\r\n  against the Hessian ramparts at Bennington than to sit in the lonely\r\n  homestead awaiting the issue with tearful eyes uplifted to God in\r\n  prayer for those who perilled their lives for the cause. All honor to\r\n  the New England mother, the queen of the New England home! [Applause.]\r\n  There, in those nurseries of virtue and truth, have been found the\r\n  strongest influences that have moulded your people for good and led\r\n  your sons to honor. [Great cheering.]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion John B. Carney, Chairman of the Citizens' Committee,\r\npresented General Harrison with a gold medal bearing a likeness of the\r\nBennington Monument. As the medal was pinned on the President's coat he\r\nremarked: \"It needed not this memento to remind me of this auspicious\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMT. M'GREGOR, AUGUST 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison and his party arrived at Saratoga on the morning of\r\nthe 20th, and were heartily greeted. He immediately embarked for Mt.\r\nMcGregor, where another large gathering welcomed him. After visiting the\r\nhistoric Grant cottage the President became the guest of W. J. Arkell,\r\nat the latter's cottage on the mountain. In the afternoon the party\r\npartook of a \"country dinner\" at the Hotel Balmoral, given by the Hon.\r\nJames Arkell in honor of the President's fifty-eighth birthday.\r\n\r\nAbout 120 guests participated. Senator Arkell presided. Among those\r\npresent besides the President's party were: B. Gillam, Capt. John\r\nPalmer, Commander G. A. R.; Hugh Reilly, W. H. Bockes, M. L. Staver,\r\nP. Farrelly, J. S. Lamoreaux, J. M. Francis, William Barnes, Jr.,\r\nand William Whitney, of Albany; Edward Ellis and Samuel Insul, of\r\nSchenectady; John W. Vrooman, of Herkimer; J. Y. Foster, C. C. Shayne,\r\nSpencer Trask, John A. Sleicher, J. H. Breslin, W. A. Sweetzer, S. E.\r\nMay, and Marshall P. Wilder, of New York; D. F. Ritchie, W. T. Rockwood,\r\nH. B. Hanson, J. G. B. Woolworthy, W. Lester, C. S. Lester, W. W.\r\nWorden, E. H. Peters, J. M. Marvin, E. C. Clark, and T. F. Hamilton, of\r\nSaratoga; J. A. Manning, of Troy; D. W. Mabee, Frank Jones, and S. C.\r\nMedberry, of Ballston, and John Kellogg and W. J. Kline, of Amsterdam.\r\nMr. Arkell paid an eloquent tribute to the memory of General Grant and\r\ncongratulated his distinguished guest.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison arose and amid great cheering began:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Arkell and Friends_--It was a part of the covenant of\r\n  this feast that it should be a silent one; not exactly a Quaker\r\n  meeting, as Mr. Arkell has said, because silence there is apt to\r\n  be broken by the moving of the spirit. That is not a safe rule for\r\n  a banquet. [Laughter.] I rise only to thank your generous host and\r\n  these gentlemen from different parts of the State who honor this\r\n  occasion for their friendliness and their esteem. We are gathered\r\n  here in a spot which is historic. This mountain has been fixed in\r\n  the affectionate and reverent memory of all our people and has been\r\n  glorified by the death on its summit of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.\r\n  [Applause.] It is fit that that great spirit that had already lifted\r\n  its fame to a height unknown in American history should take its\r\n  flight from this mountain-top. It has been said that a great life went\r\n  out here; but great lives, like that of General Grant, do not go out.\r\n  They go on. [Cries of \"Good! Good!\" and great applause.] I will ask\r\n  you in a reverent and affectionate and patriotic remembrance of that\r\n  man who came to recover all failures in military achievement, and with\r\n  his great generalship and inflexible purpose to carry the flag of the\r\n  republic to ultimate triumph, recalling with reverent interest his\r\n  memory, to drink a toast in silence as a pledge that we will ever\r\n  keep in mind his great services, and in doing so will perpetuate his\r\n  great citizenship and the glory of the Nation he fought to save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSARATOGA SPRINGS, NEW YORK, AUGUST 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President left Mt. McGregor the afternoon of the 21st, and reached\r\nSaratoga at 4 o'clock, where 50,000 people joined in an ovation to him.\r\nIt was the largest gathering ever seen in Saratoga, and the town was\r\nresplendent with colors. The Chief Executive was met by a reception\r\ncommittee composed of Hon. John R. Putnam, Hon. A. Bockes, Hon. Henry\r\nHilton, Hon. H. S. Clement, Hon. James M. Marvin, Hon. John W. Crane,\r\nHon. J. W. Houghton, Gen. W. B. French, Hon. John Foley, Hon. D. Lohnas,\r\nCol. David F. Ritchie, Hon. Lewis Varney, Lieut. A. L. Hall, Edward\r\nKearney, John A. Manning, George B. Cluett, Prof. Edward N. Jones, and\r\nJ. G. B. Woolworth. Wheeler Post, G. A. R., acted as an escort of honor.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Grand Union Hotel, the President was greeted with great\r\nclapping of hands and the waving of 10,000 handkerchiefs by the ladies.\r\nHe reviewed the procession from the piazza, and, on being introduced by\r\nVillage President Lohnas, spoke a follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--The greatness of this assembly makes it\r\n  impossible that I should do more than thank you for the magnificent\r\n  welcome which you have extended me to-day. I have great pleasure in\r\n  being again for a few days in Saratoga--this world renowned health\r\n  and pleasure resort. It gives me great satisfaction to witness, on\r\n  the part of the citizens of Saratoga and of the visitors who are\r\n  spending a season for refreshment or recuperation here, the expression\r\n  of kindness which beams upon me from all your faces. I am sure the\r\n  explanation of all this is that you are all American citizens, lovers\r\n  of the flag and the Constitution [applause], and in thus assembling\r\n  you give expression to your loyalty and patriotism. [Applause.] It\r\n  is not, I am sure, an individual expression; it is larger and better\r\n  than that, for this country of ours is distinguished in naught else\r\n  more than in the fact that its people give their love and loyalty\r\n  and service, not to individuals, but to institutions. [Applause.]\r\n  We love this country because it is a land of liberty, because the\r\n  web and woof of its institutions are designed to promote and secure\r\n  individual liberty and general prosperity. [Applause.] We love it\r\n  because it not only does not create, but because it does not tolerate,\r\n  any distinction between men other than that of merit. [Applause.] I\r\n  desire to thank those comrades who wear the honored badge of the Grand\r\n  Army of the Republic for their escort and their welcome. I never see\r\n  this badge anywhere that I do not recognize its wearer as a friend.\r\n  [Applause.] Survivors of a great struggle for the perpetuity of our\r\n  institutions--having endured in march and camp and battle the utmost\r\n  that men can endure, and given the utmost that men can give--they are\r\n  now as citizens of this republic in civic life doing their part to\r\n  maintain order in its communities and to promote in peace the honor\r\n  and prosperity of the country they saved. [Applause.] Thanking you\r\n  once more for your friendliness and cordial enthusiasm, I will ask you\r\n  to excuse me from further speech. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM SARATOGA THROUGH VERMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last day of the President's stay at Saratoga Springs he was tendered\r\na reception by Mr. and Mrs. J. S. T. Stranahan, of Brooklyn, at the\r\nPompeiian House of Pansa. Admission was by card, and several hundred\r\nwell-known people paid their respects to the Chief Magistrate. The wives\r\nof Governor Jackson, of Maryland, ex-Governor Baldwin, of Michigan,\r\nand Hon. George Bliss, of New York, assisted the host and hostess in\r\nreceiving. Hon. David F. Ritchie introduced the guests.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 25 the President, accompanied by Secretary\r\nProctor and the other members of his party, left Saratoga on a\r\njourney through the Green Mountain State. They were accompanied\r\nby Vice-President E. C. Smith, of the Vermont Central road, and\r\nSuperintendent C. D. Hammond, of the Delaware and Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITEHALL, NEW YORK, AUGUST, 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first stop was at Whitehall, where the party was met by Hon. H. G.\r\nBurleigh, Gen. J. C. Rogers, William Sinnott, Luke H. Carrington, A. J.\r\nTaft, and Maj. John Dwyer, President of the Washington County Veteran\r\nAssociation. A train containing several hundred veterans, on their way\r\nto a reunion at Dresden, was in waiting, and a large crowd assembled\r\naround the President's car. The Burleigh Corps acted as a guard of\r\nhonor. Ex-Congressman Burleigh, in a brief speech, introduced the\r\nPresident, whose remarks created much enthusiasm. He said:\r\n\r\n  _Comrades and Fellow-citizens_--It is pleasant to come this morning\r\n  upon an assemblage of comrades gathering with their families to a\r\n  social reunion to recall their services and sacrifices and to bathe\r\n  their souls in the glory of this bright day and of this great land\r\n  that they fought to save. [Applause.] Such assemblages are full\r\n  of interest to the veterans, and they are full of instruction and\r\n  inspiration to those who gather with them. It is our habit in the\r\n  West, as it is yours here, to have these annual meetings, and it is\r\n  always a pleasure to me when I can arrange to meet with the comrades\r\n  of my old regiment, or of the old brigade, or with the veterans of\r\n  any regiment of any State who stood for the flag. [Applause.] There\r\n  is a pathetic side to all this. We gather with diminished ranks from\r\n  year to year. We miss the comrades who are dropping by the way. We see\r\n  repeated now that which we saw as the great column moved on in the\r\n  campaign of the war--a comrade dropping out, borne to the hospital,\r\n  followed to the grave--and yet these soldier memories and thoughts\r\n  are brightened by the glories which inspire and attend all these\r\n  gatherings of the veterans of the war. We see the old flag again, and\r\n  I am glad to believe that there has never been a period in our history\r\n  when there was more love for it. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is quite natural that it should be so. These veterans who stand\r\n  about me have seen many days and months in camps and battlefields and\r\n  in devastated country through which they marched when there was on\r\n  all the horizon one thing of beauty--that glorified flag. [Applause.]\r\n  They brought home the love of it in their hearts, wrought in every\r\n  fibre of their nature; and it is very natural that the children who\r\n  have come on should catch this inspiration and love from the fathers\r\n  who perilled everything that the flag might still be held in honor,\r\n  and still be an emblem of the authority of one Constitution over an\r\n  undivided Nation. We see to-day how worthy the land was for which\r\n  our comrades died, and for which you, my comrades, offered your\r\n  lives, in its great development and its increasing population, in\r\n  its multiplying homes, where plenty and prosperity, the love of God\r\n  and social order, and all good things abide. In this great Nation,\r\n  striding on in wealth and prosperity to the very first place among the\r\n  nations of the earth; in this land, in truth as well as in theory the\r\n  land of the free, we see that which was worthy of the utmost sacrifice\r\n  of the truest men. [Prolonged Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I recall with pleasure that some of the New York regiments, coming\r\n  to the Western army with Hooker and Howard and Gerry and Williams and\r\n  others, served in the same corps to which I was designated during the\r\n  great campaign upon Atlanta. Some of the comrades who made that march\r\n  from Chattanooga to Atlanta and the sea are here to-day, survivors of\r\n  one of the greatest, in all its aspects, of all the campaigns of the\r\n  war. You came from those bloody fields upon the Potomac, and struck\r\n  hands with us of the West as brothers. You helped us in the struggle\r\n  there to cut the Confederacy in twain, and, lapping around by the sea,\r\n  to strike hands with Grant again near Appomattox. [cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you again most cordially for your friendly demonstration\r\n  and presence. If I had the power to call down blessings upon my\r\n  fellow-men, the home of every comrade here would be full of all\r\n  prosperity. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIR HAVEN, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Whitehall the party was joined by Adj.-Gen. T. S. Peck and Col.\r\nM. J. Horton, of Governor Page's staff. When the Vermont line was\r\nreached General Peck, in the name of the Governor, formally welcomed\r\nthe President to the State. Fair Haven was reached at 10 o'clock. The\r\nReception Committee was Hon. Samuel L. Hazard, Andrew N. Adams, George\r\nM. Fuller, and Wm. V. Roberts.\r\n\r\nMr. Hazard introduced President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--We have already lost some minutes at your\r\n  station, and it will not be possible for me to hold the train longer.\r\n  I thank you for this friendly greeting, and for the kindness which\r\n  beams upon me from the faces of these contented and happy men and\r\n  women of the good State of Vermont. I am glad to see about me the\r\n  evidences of the indomitable pluck and successful enterprise which\r\n  characterize so highly all of your New England States. When you found\r\n  the stones too thick to make agriculture profitable you compelled\r\n  the rocks to yield you a subsistence, and these great slate and\r\n  marble industries have become the centre of wealthy and prosperous\r\n  communities. You are here, each in his own place; these good ladies in\r\n  that supremely influential position, the American home, and you, my\r\n  countrymen, in the shops and in the fields, making contributions to\r\n  the prosperity and glory of this great Nation. It is pleasant to know\r\n  that the love of country, stimulated by the teaching of the father and\r\n  of the mother, revived by these recollections of the first struggle\r\n  for independence, deepened by the sacrifices which were made in the\r\n  Civil War to preserve what our fathers had purchased for us, are still\r\n  holding sway in the hearts of our people. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  We are conspicuously a people abiding in respect and honor for\r\n  the law. The law, as expressed in our constitutions and in our\r\n  statute-books, is the sovereign to which we all bow. We acknowledge\r\n  no other. To the law each and every one should give his undivided\r\n  allegiance and his faithful service. There is no other rule that\r\n  will bring and maintain in our communities that peaceful and orderly\r\n  condition, that good neighborhood and kindly intercourse, which is\r\n  so essential to the happiness of any community. I am sure that these\r\n  things, now as of old, characterize these New England communities,\r\n  where the strife which your colder climate and your soil compel you\r\n  to make for your subsistence has bred habits of thrift, economy, and\r\n  independence, and the love of liberty which I am sure is as fadeless\r\n  as the stars. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Thanking you again for this pleasant morning reception, I will bid\r\n  you good-by. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLETON, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Castleton there was a large crowd, including 200 pupils of the\r\nNormal School, who pelted the President with roses and golden-rod. The\r\nReception Committee comprised Hon. Henry L. Clark, A. E. Leavenworth, S.\r\nB. Ellis, and A. L. Ramson.\r\n\r\nJudge Clark introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--It is very pleasant to meet here, mingling\r\n  with the citizens of this neighborhood, the pupils of your Normal\r\n  School. One of the most influential characters in the history of the\r\n  United States is the New England school-teacher. If we could follow\r\n  the track of these intelligent men and women who have gone out from\r\n  the New England States into the West and South; if we could trace\r\n  those strong, yet slender and hard-to-be-discovered, threads of\r\n  influence which they have started in the communities to which they\r\n  went; if we could know how they have impressed on the minds of the\r\n  pupils brought under their care the great lessons of self-respect\r\n  and love for free institutions and social order,--we should have a\r\n  higher thought than we have yet had of the power and dignity of these\r\n  pioneers of education. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANDON, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrandon gave the travellers a hearty reception at 11 A.M. Ex-Gov.\r\nJ. W. Stewart, of Middlebury, Hon. Aldace F. Walker, of Chicago; G.\r\nG. Benedict and C. S. Forbes, of St. Albans, joined the party here.\r\nEx-Governor Ormsbee welcomed the President on behalf of the residents of\r\nBrandon.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harrison said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--The kindly pelting which I have received at\r\n  the hands of some of your ladies and of these bright children reminds\r\n  me of a like experience on the California trip, when we were so pelted\r\n  with bouquets of handsome flowers that we were very often compelled\r\n  to retreat from the platform and take cover in the car. These gifts\r\n  of flowers which you bring to me here are the products of your fields\r\n  and not of your gardens. The beautiful golden-rod! It is pleasant to\r\n  think that in this plant, so widely distributed, slightly diversified\r\n  in its characteristics, but spreading over nearly our whole country,\r\n  we have a type of the diversity and yet the oneness of our people; and\r\n  I am glad to think that its golden hue typifies the gladness and joy\r\n  and prosperity that is over all our fields this happy year, and, I\r\n  trust, in all your homes. I thank you for your pleasant greeting this\r\n  morning, and bid you good-by. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLEBURY, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of the train at Middlebury at 11:30 A.M. another large\r\nand enthusiastic throng was on hand. The President was greeted by\r\nex-Gov. John W. Stewart, Col. A. A. Fletcher, G. S. Wainwright, Judge\r\nJames M. Slade, Charles M. Wilds, E. H. Thorp, E. P. Russell, B. S.\r\nBeckwith, E. J. Mathews, John H. Stewart, A. J. Marshall, Col. T. M.\r\nChapman, Rufus Wainwright, and Frank A. Bond. The veterans of Russel\r\nPost, G. A. R., were present in a body, also the Sons of Veterans.\r\n\r\nGovernor Stewart introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--Though I have not before had the pleasure of\r\n  looking into the faces of many of you, Vermont has for many years\r\n  been familiar to me, and has been placed high in my esteem by the\r\n  acquaintance I have formed at Washington with the representatives\r\n  you have sent there. It has been a great pleasure to me to know your\r\n  esteemed fellow-citizen, Governor Stewart. Your State and district and\r\n  the Nation at large have had in him a most able and faithful champion\r\n  of all that was true and clean and right. [Three cheers were given for\r\n  Governor Stewart.]\r\n\r\n  You have been particularly fortunate, I think, in your\r\n  representatives at Washington, as I had occasion to say the other day\r\n  at Bennington. I am glad to be here at the site of this institution of\r\n  learning--Middlebury College, which is soon to complete its hundredth\r\n  year of modest yet efficient service in training the minds of your\r\n  young men for usefulness in life. These home institutions, in which\r\n  these able and faithful men assiduously give themselves and their\r\n  lives to the building up and development of the intelligence--and\r\n  not only that, but of the moral side of your young men--are bulwarks\r\n  of strength to your State and to your community. They cannot be too\r\n  highly esteemed and honored by you; because, my countrymen, kings may\r\n  rule over an ignorant people, and by their iron control hold them in\r\n  subjection and in the quietness of tyranny, but a free land rests\r\n  upon the intelligence of its people, and has no other safety than in\r\n  well-grounded education and thorough moral training. [Cries of \"Good!\r\n  Good!\" and applause.] Again I thank you for this cordial greeting\r\n  which Vermont gives me this morning, and to these comrades and friends\r\n  I extend a comrade's greeting and good wishes. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERGENNES, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Vergennes a large and joyful crowd greeted the distinguished\r\ntraveller. The Reception Committee comprised Hon. J. G. Hindes, Mayor of\r\nthe city; Hon. J. D. Smith, Herrick Stevens, and J. N. Norton.\r\n\r\nSecretary Proctor introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I have had, as you know, some experience in\r\n  this business of speaking from the end of a railroad train. But it has\r\n  seemed to me this morning that these Vermont towns are closer together\r\n  than on any other route I have travelled. [Laughter.] Perhaps it is\r\n  because your State is not very large, and you have had to put your\r\n  towns close together in order to get them all in. [Laughter.] I have\r\n  heard an interesting story of the origin of this city of Vergennes.\r\n  I suppose it was one of the earliest instances in the history of our\r\n  country, if not the very first, of a city being constructed upon paper\r\n  before it was built upon the ground. [Laughter.] That has come to be\r\n  quite a familiar practice in these late days of speculation, but it\r\n  is singular that a city charter and the ample corporate limits of one\r\n  mile square should have been given to Vergennes before this century\r\n  began. If the expectations of the founder of this city have not been\r\n  realized fully, you have more than realized all the thoughts of Ethan\r\n  Allan and his contemporaries in the greatness and prosperity of your\r\n  State and in the richer glory and higher greatness of the Nation of\r\n  which you are a part. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad this morning to look into the contented faces of another\r\n  audience of New England people. You were greatly disparaged in the\r\n  estimation of some of our people before the Civil War. There had\r\n  spread unfortunately over the minds of our Southern brethren the\r\n  impression that you were so much given to money, to thrift, and\r\n  to toil that your hands had forgotten how to fight. It was a most\r\n  wholesome lesson when the whole country learned again in the gallant\r\n  charges and stubborn resistances of the Vermont Brigade that the\r\n  old New England spirit still lived; that Paul Revere still rode the\r\n  highways of New England; and that the men of Concord and Lexington\r\n  and Bennington still ploughed her fields. [Applause.] I am glad to\r\n  meet you this bright, joyous morning; and I am sure, in view of the\r\n  fatigues that have preceded and that are to follow, you will excuse\r\n  me from further speech, and accept my most heartfelt thanks for your\r\n  friendliness. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURLINGTON, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurlington gave the President a royal reception Tuesday noon. The Queen\r\nCity was elaborately decorated, and all business was suspended during\r\nthe demonstration. The distinguished visitors were welcomed by Senator\r\nGeorge F. Edmunds, his honor Mayor Hazelton, Col. Le Grand B. Cannon,\r\nHon. E. J. Phelps, Gen. William Wells, ex-Gov. U. A. Woodbury, Hon. B.\r\nB. Smalley, Hon. G. G. Benedict, C. F. Wheeler, ex-Governor Barstow, C.\r\nW. Woodhouse, and Elias Lyman, President of the Board of Aldermen. After\r\nluncheon at the home of Senator Edmunds, the President was escorted\r\nthrough the Fletcher Library to a platform fronting the park, where\r\n20,000 people greeted him.\r\n\r\nMayor Hazelton delivered the address of welcome and introduced President\r\nHarrison, who responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor and Fellow-citizens_--I am not a little intimidated as I\r\n  face so unexpectedly this vast concourse of the citizens of this great\r\n  State of Vermont. I say great, though your territorial extent does not\r\n  place you among large States; great in an origin that gave occasion\r\n  for an early and resolute expression of that love of liberty which\r\n  has always pervaded your people; great in a population that has never\r\n  bowed the knee to the arrogance of power or to the blandishments of\r\n  wealth, and has, through all the history of the State, maintained the\r\n  inspiration of its early annals for love of personal independence. I\r\n  rejoice to be present to-day at the home of one of your distinguished\r\n  public servants, with whom it was my good fortune for a time to be\r\n  associated in the discharge of public duties. I am glad to see here,\r\n  at his own home, the respect and honor in which George F. Edmunds\r\n  is deservedly held by the people of Vermont. [Applause.] Having for\r\n  six years witnessed the value of his services as a legislator in the\r\n  Senate of the United States, I share with you the regret that this\r\n  country is no longer to enjoy those services; though it is a source\r\n  of gratification to you, as it is to me, to know that in his love and\r\n  loyalty to the State that he has so highly honored, in his love and\r\n  loyalty to the Union of States, there will be no call for his wise\r\n  counsel and help that will not find a ready response from the walks of\r\n  life which he has chosen to resume. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  My fellow-citizens, it is true, as your Mayor has said, happily\r\n  true, that we not infrequently, and with ease, lift ourselves above\r\n  all the contentions of party strife and stand in the clear, inspiring\r\n  and stimulating sunshine as American patriots. [Applause.] We are\r\n  conspicuously a people who give their allegiance to institutions and\r\n  not to men. [Applause.] It were a happy thing for others of our sister\r\n  republics on this hemisphere if they could follow this great example.\r\n  Our people are not slow to appreciate public services. They are not\r\n  reluctant to acknowledge transcendent genius, but they give their\r\n  loyalty as citizens to institutions, and not to parties or to men.\r\n  [Applause.] This was happily shown in our great rebellion, when party\r\n  divisions, that seemed to lift barriers between us like these mountain\r\n  peaks, were obliterated in a moment by that love for the Constitution\r\n  and the flag which pervaded all our people [applause]--a love that\r\n  made the people of all these great States one; that sent from Vermont\r\n  and Massachusetts, as from Indiana, those stalwart and devoted sons\r\n  who offered--many of them gave--their lives for the perpetuity of the\r\n  Union and the honor of the flag. Let us pursue our lines of division.\r\n  It is characteristic of a free people--it is essential--that mental\r\n  agitation and unrest out of which the highest and best is evolved. But\r\n  let us never forget that the fundamental thought of our Government\r\n  is the rule of the majority, lawfully expressed at pure and clean\r\n  elections, and that, when thus expressed, the laws enacted by those\r\n  chosen to make our laws are not less of the minority than of the\r\n  majority. [Applause.] Those who make the laws are our servants, to\r\n  whom we yield the respect of office and that measure of personal\r\n  regard to which their lives may entitle them. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  We are this year a most favored and happy people. Drouth has blasted\r\n  the crops of many of the nations of the world. Most of the peoples\r\n  of Europe are short of food. And God has this year, mercifully to\r\n  us, mercifully to them, made our store-houses to burst with plenty.\r\n  We have a great surplus of breadstuffs, and there is not a bushel of\r\n  wheat, corn, rye or oats that will not find a ready market this year.\r\n  Happy are we in this great prosperity; happy that again out of your\r\n  abundance the lack of other peoples may be supplied. Let us be careful\r\n  that our heads are not turned by too much prosperity. It has been out\r\n  of hardness, out of struggles, out of self-denials, out of that thrift\r\n  and economy which was an incident of your soil, that the best things\r\n  in New England have come. [Applause.] And, while thankful to God for a\r\n  season that diffuses its blessings as this sweet sunshine is diffused\r\n  into all our homes, let us remember that it is not, after all, riches\r\n  that exalt the Nation. It is a pure, clean, high, intellectual, moral,\r\n  and God-fearing citizenship that is our glory and security as a\r\n  Nation. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you again for the friendliness of your manifestations,\r\n  for the opportunity to stand for a few moments in this most\r\n  beautiful city. [Applause.] You have the advantage of many of our\r\n  municipalities. You have not only the beauties of these groves and\r\n  gardens and pleasant streets and lovely homes, but from these hilltops\r\n  you have laid under contribution fifty miles in either direction to\r\n  beautify Burlington. [Applause.] I thank you, and part with you with\r\n  regret that my stay cannot be longer and my intercourse with you more\r\n  personal and informal. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ALBANS, VERMONT, AUGUST 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President and party embarked at Burlington on board Col. W. Seward\r\nWebb's yacht _Elfrida_ and greatly enjoyed the sail on Lake Champlain,\r\nlanding at Maquam in the evening, whence a special train carried them\r\nto St. Albans, where they were welcomed by the Committee of Reception,\r\nconsisting of Hon. A. D. Tenney, George T. Childs, Alfred A. Hall, T. M.\r\nDeal, W. Tracy Smith, B. F. Kelley, A. L. Weeks, and A. W. Fuller. After\r\ndining at Governor Smith's the President, at 9 P.M., was escorted to the\r\nWelden House, fronting St. Albans Park. Twelve thousand people greeted\r\nhim. The scene was one of unusual beauty; from the branching elms hung\r\n2,000 Chinese lanterns.\r\n\r\nWhen the President appeared on the balcony the enthusiasm was great. He\r\nwas introduced by Hon. E. C. Smith, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I fear that my voice will not permit me\r\n  suitably to acknowledge this magnificent demonstration. In the tour\r\n  which I made this spring across the continent I witnessed very many\r\n  great assemblages and looked upon very many brilliant and entrancing\r\n  scenes, but I recall none outside the greater cities more beautiful\r\n  and worthy than this in St. Albans to-night. [Applause.] Most deeply\r\n  do I feel whatever of personal respect you thus evidence, and yet more\r\n  highly do I appreciate that love of American institutions, that fealty\r\n  to the flag, which I am sure is the dominant impulse in this great\r\n  assembly. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Your situation upon this great water line connecting the St.\r\n  Lawrence with the Hudson was an early suggestion to the trader as\r\n  well as to the invader. The Indian canoe, the boat of the fur-trader,\r\n  ploughed these waters in the early days of our history. At a later\r\n  time they suggested to the military leaders of Great Britain who\r\n  commanded the armies sent for the subjection of the colonies that\r\n  familiar strategy of severing the colonies into two parts by moving\r\n  and establishing posts upon Champlain and the Hudson. These attempts\r\n  and the brave resistance which was made by our people, in which\r\n  Vermont had so conspicuous and creditable a part, have made all the\r\n  shores of Lake Champlain historic ground. In the address delivered\r\n  by President Bartlett in 1877 at the observance of the centennial of\r\n  the battle of Bennington, I noticed that he said, \"Trading Manchester\r\n  sent two regiments to conquer a market,\" and it recalled to my mind\r\n  the fact that one of the great motives of resistance on the part of\r\n  the colonies was the unjust trade restrictions and exactions which\r\n  were imposed upon them by the mother country in order to secure the\r\n  American markets for the British manufacturer. You recall how severe\r\n  and persistent were the measures adopted in order to repress and crush\r\n  out the establishment of manufacturing industries in the colonies.\r\n  This battle for a market was never more general or more strenuous than\r\n  now among all of the nations of the world, though now generally not\r\n  pushed to bloodshed. [Applause.] All of the countries of the Old World\r\n  have through colonial extension by the division of Africa, much as a\r\n  boy might divide a watermelon among his fellows, had reference largely\r\n  to trade extensions and enlarged markets. In this contest we have\r\n  ourselves engaged, not by attempting to push our political domain into\r\n  lands that are not rightfully ours, not by attempting to overthrow or\r\n  subjugate the weaker but friendly powers of this hemisphere, but by\r\n  those methods of peaceful and profitable interchange which are good\r\n  for them as for us, [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and applause.] Secure in\r\n  the great American market for our manufactures--a market the best\r\n  per capita of any in the world--we have come now to believe that\r\n  we may well extend our trade and send our manufactured products to\r\n  other countries across the seas and in ships carrying the American\r\n  flag. [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and applause.] We do not need in any\r\n  degree to break down or injure our own domestic industries. We are\r\n  consuming, to an enormous extent, of tropical products not produced\r\n  by our people, and by a fair exchange with the nations sending us\r\n  sugar, tea, and coffee we propose and have entered successfully upon\r\n  the enterprise of opening the markets of Central and South America to\r\n  the manufacturing establishments of New England and the United States.\r\n  [Cries of \"Good! good!\" and applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am sure every American will rejoice in the success which has\r\n  thus far attended these efforts, and will rejoice that with this\r\n  expanding trade to the southward there opens before us this year a\r\n  largely increased traffic in agricultural products with the nations\r\n  of Europe. We have never in the history of our country harvested such\r\n  a crop as has now been gathered into the granaries of the United\r\n  States. [Applause.] We shall have an enormously large surplus of\r\n  breadstuffs for exportation, and it happens that in this period of\r\n  our abundance crop failures or shortages in India, in Russia, in\r\n  France, in Germany, and England have opened a market that will require\r\n  the last bushel of grain we have to sell. [Cries of \"Good! good!\"\r\n  and applause.] Rejoicing in the peace that pervades our land, proud\r\n  of institutions which have for more than a hundred years witnessed\r\n  their adequacy to give peace and security at home and to preserve our\r\n  National honor abroad, rejoicing in the great increase of material\r\n  wealth which is flowing in upon us, may we not on these great lines\r\n  of enterprise, lifting ourselves now to newer and larger thoughts of\r\n  what this country may be, enter upon these opening avenues of trade\r\n  and influence upon which are the beckoning invitations of friendly\r\n  peoples? [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you again for this magnificent assemblage of Vermont\r\n  patriots and of Vermont women, who have shared with her gallant men\r\n  the sacrifices and suffering that this State has borne that it might\r\n  be born among the States, and, having been admitted to the sisterhood,\r\n  might, though small in geographical extent and population, bear a\r\n  noble and honorable part in the work of holding up the American\r\n  character and defending the American flag. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, VERMONT, AUGUST 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison passed the night at St. Albans. On his departure,\r\nthe morning of the 26th, he was accompanied by Secretary Proctor,\r\nex-Governor Smith and wife, Colonel and Mrs. E. C. Smith, Tracy Smith,\r\nHon. H. H. Powers, Henry R. Start, D. Sage McKay, Col. Geo. T. Childs,\r\nand Col. M. J. Horton, of Governor Page's staff.\r\n\r\nThe first stop of the day was at Richmond, where a large audience\r\ngreeted the party. Among the prominent citizens who received the\r\nPresident were: Judge E. B. Andrews, Hon. U. S. Whitcomb, Capt. G. A.\r\nEdwards, Dr. C. W. Jacobs, Hon. H. A. Hodges, C. P. Rhodes and Edgar T.\r\nJacobs. The veterans of Bronson Barber Post, G. A. R., were present in a\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nCongressman Powers introduced the President, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--It is a little early in the morning to begin\r\n  the daily round of speech-making, and yet I cannot refrain from saying\r\n  to you how highly I appreciate your morning welcome. There is the\r\n  tonic of your fine mountain air and the glory of your sunshine in\r\n  these cordial manifestations of your respect and good-will. I hope\r\n  no American citizen will ever begrudge the President of the United\r\n  States the refreshment which comes from these occasional visits\r\n  through the country, and from that draught of good-will which he\r\n  receives as he looks into the faces and takes the hands of these\r\n  good people, who have no other interest in the Government than that\r\n  it shall be honestly administered for the general good. Washington\r\n  is not always full of that kind of people; we are more certain,\r\n  perhaps, to find them in the country. And yet no one should complain\r\n  of honest criticism, and perhaps fault-finding has its use, for\r\n  occasionally it must be well grounded and disclose to us errors we\r\n  might otherwise have failed to discern. But, after all, the bracing\r\n  of the good-will of the good people of this country is very essential\r\n  to those who, in the midst of great perplexity and doubt and under\r\n  staggering responsibility, endeavor as they see the right to do it.\r\n  No man can do more than this, and I look upon this popular feature\r\n  of our Government, the readiness of communication, the nearness\r\n  and familiarity of access which the people have with all public\r\n  servants, as a great safeguard to those who might otherwise become\r\n  separated from those impulses which are, after all, the safest and\r\n  best. [Applause.] I have had great pleasure in passing through your\r\n  beautiful valley this morning. I can most sincerely commend what I see\r\n  in these farms and thrifty homes. Vermont is a mountain State, and, I\r\n  suppose, because your horizon is a little high you are more frequently\r\n  than we who live on the plains compelled to look up. That may account\r\n  for a great many of the good things which we discover in the New\r\n  England character. I thank you for your kindness. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERBURY, VERMONT, AUGUST, 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaterbury was reached at 10:30 A.M. Governor Page and Hon. W. W. Grout\r\njoined the party here. About 10,000 people were assembled to greet\r\nthe President, prominent among whom were: G. E. Moody, Esq., Hon. G.\r\nW. Rundall, Hon. E. F. Palmer, M. M. Knight, George W. Atkins, John\r\nBatchelder, L. H. Haines, Justin W. Moody, C. C. Warren, W. R. Elliott,\r\nC. H. Arms, Charles Wells, Dr. Henry Janes, and F. H. Atherton.\r\n\r\nHon. Wm. Paul Dillingham made the welcoming address and introduced the\r\nPresident, who responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Friends_--It is very pleasant to know that a public officer may\r\n  travel everywhere through this great land of ours--and only those who\r\n  have traversed it can understand how great it is--and find always\r\n  his sure defence and care in the good-will and respect of the people\r\n  who surround him. If we bar out the irresponsible crank, so far as I\r\n  can see the President is in no peril, except that he may be killed\r\n  by the superabundant kindness of the people. [Laughter.] There seems\r\n  to be an impression that his strength and capacity for speech-making\r\n  is unfailing [laughter] and that his arm is a hickory limb. But it\r\n  is very kind of you and all these good, people of Vermont who have\r\n  met me on this journey to express so pleasantly by your cheers, and\r\n  much more by your kindly faces, the love and loyalty you have for\r\n  those in the situation with which the suffrage of the people has for\r\n  the time connected me. The New England character is one that has\r\n  been much written about, much discussed, and I think that even those\r\n  who have found points for the sharpest criticism have, when they\r\n  adopted the Yankee method of averages, concluded that the influences\r\n  emanating from Plymouth Rock and diffusing themselves first through\r\n  the New Hampshire Grants and then the Western Reserve of Ohio, and\r\n  so scattering and disseminating the seeds of intelligence and love\r\n  of liberty throughout the whole land, have been good for the whole\r\n  country. The New England man is a man with his eye open everywhere.\r\n  I have sometimes thought that the habit of attention, of giving the\r\n  whole mind to the business in hand, had its very natural origin and\r\n  development in New England agriculture. The man who holds a plough in\r\n  a stumpy or stony ground learns the lesson that he had better give\r\n  his mind to the business in hand. [Laughter.] Otherwise the revenge\r\n  and punishments for inattention are so prompt and severe that he is\r\n  quickly called back from any mental wanderings into which he may\r\n  have fallen. I had occasion to say a moment ago that the fact that\r\n  the mountain regions of the world had always furnished the bravest\r\n  champions of liberty and the most strenuous defenders of the faith was\r\n  possibly owing to the fact that their horizon was so high that if they\r\n  looked at all they were compelled to look up. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n  My countrymen, we have a great and happy land--a people dwelling in\r\n  happy homes, and that is the origin of government, and there is the\r\n  essential of a contented citizenship. As long as we can preserve this\r\n  independence and self-respect, and that degree of comfort in the home\r\n  that makes it a pleasant abode when the day's toil is ended, and that\r\n  enables by the most careful thrift the head of the household to lay by\r\n  for the family and to lighten in some measure the care and labor of\r\n  the children that are to follow him, there can be no happier land than\r\n  ours. If we would perpetuate and secure that which we have had handed\r\n  down to us and which we have so well preserved until this hour, this\r\n  is the essential thing.\r\n\r\n  I thank you for this kindly greeting, and beg you to accept my\r\n  sincerest good-will. I can say nothing of public affairs. Every man\r\n  called to public office is subject to the infirmities that belong to\r\n  our nature--the capacity to make mistakes. He can be, if he is true,\r\n  sure of one thing--that in all that he does he has it in his mind to\r\n  do the best he can for all the people. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTPELIER, VERMONT, AUGUST 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great throng greeted the President's arrival at the Vermont capital.\r\nHe was met by a Reception Committee consisting of 15 prominent citizens:\r\nCol. Fred E. Smith, Hon. Charles Dewey, Prof. J. A. DeBoer, J. C.\r\nHoughton, M. E. Smilie, L. Bart Cross, G. H. Gurnsey, T. C. Phinney,\r\nH. W. Kemp, D. F. Long, C. P. Pitkin, J. W. Brock, George Wing, F.\r\nW. Morse, and Thomas Marvin. The First Regiment N. G. V., commanded\r\nby Adjutant-General Peck, with the Sons of Veterans, escorted the\r\nPresident and Governor Page to the State House, the former walking the\r\nentire distance with uncovered head, surrounded by a guard of honor\r\ndetailed from George Crook Post, G. A. R. From the Governor's Room they\r\nwere conducted to the hall of the House of Representatives, where the\r\nLegislature of Vermont was assembled in joint session. The members arose\r\nand remained standing until the Chief Magistrate was seated between\r\nGovernor Page and Lieutenant-Governor Fletcher.\r\n\r\nAfter the applause subsided the Lieutenant-Governor introduced President\r\nHarrison, who addressed the legislators as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President and Gentlemen, the Legislature of the State of\r\n  Vermont_--I am grateful to you for this cordial reception, which\r\n  crowns a series of friendly demonstrations which began with my entry\r\n  into this good State and have continued to this interesting and\r\n  important occasion. I am glad to meet the chosen representatives of\r\n  the towns of Vermont, appointed to the discharge of functions of\r\n  legislating for the general good. The wisdom of our fathers devised\r\n  that system of governmental division for the general Government which\r\n  has found adoption or adaptation in all the States--the division of\r\n  the powers of the Government into three great co-ordinate departments,\r\n  each independent, and yet having close and important relations one\r\n  with the other, and each adapted in the highest degree to secure the\r\n  liberty of the individual, the welfare of our community, and the\r\n  national honor and prosperity. [Applause.] It has been fortunate for\r\n  us as a people that no serious clash has occurred to these great\r\n  departments. The constitutional balance and counterbalance have\r\n  preserved with marvellous exactness, with the perfection of the most\r\n  perfect machinery, the relations of these several departments, each\r\n  doing its appropriate work and producing the great result which had\r\n  been intended. Surely there is no other country where the springs\r\n  of government are higher than here. The impulses of our people are\r\n  drawn from springs that lie high in the hills of duty and loyalty.\r\n  They respect and obey the law, because it is the orderly expression\r\n  of their own will. The compact of our Government is a rule by the\r\n  majority.\r\n\r\n  The sanction of all law is that it is the expression by popular\r\n  election of the will of a majority of our people. Law has no other\r\n  sanction than that with us; and happy are we, and happy are those\r\n  communities where the election methods are so honestly and faithfully\r\n  prescribed and observed that no doubt is thrown upon the popular\r\n  expression and no question of the integrity of the ballot is ever\r\n  raised. [Applause.] If we shall ever or anywhere allow a doubt to\r\n  settle into the minds of our people whether the results of our\r\n  elections are honestly attained, whether the laws made are framed by\r\n  those who have been properly chosen by the majority, then all sanction\r\n  is withdrawn from law and all respect from the rulers who by a false\r\n  ballot are placed in public office. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am glad to congratulate you upon your constituencies, intelligent,\r\n  devoted and patriotic. I am glad to congratulate you that the State\r\n  of Vermont, from its earliest aspirations and efforts for liberty\r\n  and self-government, which developed into your Constitution in 1777,\r\n  down through all the story of toil and the struggles which have beset\r\n  you as a State, and the vicissitudes which have beset the country of\r\n  which you are an honored part, that the State of Vermont and her sons\r\n  in the councils of the Nation and on the blood-stained battle-fields\r\n  of the great war have borne themselves worthily. [Applause.] Will you\r\n  permit me now to thank you again for this demonstration and for the\r\n  opportunity to stand for a moment in your presence? I am sure that we\r\n  may each, from this occasion, in the discharge of public duty, draw\r\n  some impulse to a more perfect exercise of our powers for the public\r\n  good. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Public Reception._\r\n\r\nThe speech-making within doors being over, President Harrison entered\r\na side room, where he received the Tippecanoe Club, shaking hands\r\ncordially with all. He was then conducted to the Governor's Room,\r\nwhere he received the members of the Legislature. Meanwhile a great\r\ncrowd massed on the beautiful grounds and waited impatiently for the\r\nreappearance of the President. Finally he made his way from the interior\r\nto the front of the Capitol. Governor Page introduced him. The President\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Governor Page and Fellow-citizens_--This sunshine is as warm as a\r\n  Vermont welcome. [Applause.] It is of the highest quality. It has life\r\n  in it. But too much of it is prostrating. [Laughter.] I have felt, in\r\n  endeavoring to respond to these calls, that I was possibly overtaxing\r\n  my own strength, and perhaps overcrowding the Press Association.\r\n  [Laughter.] I am not naturally a gossip, I think I had some reputation\r\n  as a taciturn man, but it is gone. [Laughter.] I have not given it up\r\n  willingly. I have struggled to retain it, but it has been forcefully\r\n  taken from me by kindness of my fellow-citizens, whom I have met so\r\n  frequently within the last year. Perhaps, however, if I preserve other\r\n  virtues I can let this go. [Laughter.] It is a great thing to be a\r\n  citizen of the United States. I would not have you abate at all the\r\n  love and loyalty you have for Vermont. But I am glad to know that\r\n  always in your history as a State and a people you have felt that the\r\n  higher honor, the more glorious estate, was to be a citizen of the\r\n  United States of America. [Applause.] This association of States is a\r\n  geographical necessity. We can never consent that hostile boundaries\r\n  shall be introduced with all that such divisions imply. We must be one\r\n  from Maine to California, one from the Lakes to the Gulf [applause],\r\n  and everywhere in all that domain we must insist that the behests\r\n  of the Federal Constitution and of the laws written in the Federal\r\n  statute-book shall be loyally obeyed. [Applause.] A statesman of one\r\n  of the Southern States said to me, with tears in his eyes, shortly\r\n  after my inauguration: \"Mr. President, I hope you intend to give the\r\n  poor people of my State a chance.\" I said in reply: \"A chance to do\r\n  what? If you mean, sir, that they shall have a chance to nullify\r\n  any law, and that I shall wink at the nullification of it, you ask\r\n  that which you ought not to ask and that which I cannot consider.\r\n  [Applause.] If you mean that obeying every public law and giving to\r\n  every other man his full rights under the law and the Constitution,\r\n  they shall abide in my respect and in the security and peace of our\r\n  institutions. Then they shall have, so far as in my power lies, an\r\n  equal chance with all our people.\" [Applause.] We may not choose\r\n  what laws we will obey; the choice is made for us. When a majority\r\n  have, by lawful methods, placed a law upon the statute-book, we may\r\n  endeavor to repeal it, we may challenge its wisdom, but while it is\r\n  the law it challenges our obedience. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I thank you for the kindliness of this greeting in this capital of\r\n  Vermont. I wish for you and your gallant State and for all your people\r\n  in all their good, God-fearing homes continuance of that personal\r\n  liberty, that material prosperity, that love of the truth which has\r\n  always characterized them. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAINFIELD, VERMONT, AUGUST 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Montpelier the President's party was joined by Hon. F. A. Dwinnel,\r\nGen. F. E. Alfred, Gen. W. H. Gilmore, V. R. Sartwell, W. A. Stowell,\r\nCol. H. E. Folsom, Fletcher D. Proctor, Frank C. Partridge; also, E. W.\r\nSmith and John Bailey, of Newbury.\r\n\r\nThe first stop in the afternoon was at Plainfield, where 1,000 people\r\ngave the President a cordial greeting. Among the leading citizens\r\nparticipating in the reception were: Joseph Lane, George D. Kidder,\r\nLeroy F. Fortney, E. J. Bartlett, H. E. Cutler, Henry Q. Perry, D. B.\r\nSmith, H. G. Moore, John A. Fass, Ira F. Page, Nelson Shorey, H. W.\r\nBatchelder, and W. B. Page. W. E. Martin Post, G. A. R., H. H. Hollister\r\nCommander, occupied a conspicuous position.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison was introduced by Senator Dwinnel, and said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens and Comrades_--For I see here, as everywhere,\r\n  some of those who wore the blue and carried the flag in the great\r\n  Civil War gathered to greet me. It gives me pleasure to stop for a\r\n  moment and to thank you for the friendliness which has brought you\r\n  from your homes to make this journey bright with your presence and\r\n  cordial welcome. I have been talking so much to-day that I will not\r\n  attempt to make a speech. I have already said a great deal about\r\n  Vermont, have expressed my esteem for it and for its people, and all\r\n  that. I have been very sincere, for I think that your State does hold\r\n  a very high place among the States. Your sons, who have gone out to\r\n  represent you and to take part in those stirring enterprises which\r\n  have laid the foundations of new States, have already borne themselves\r\n  with honor and with true New England thrift, obtaining in the long\r\n  run the full share of all the good things that were going. I met some\r\n  of them in California. They are scattered this broad land over, and I\r\n  think they carry with them everywhere the love of the flag, respect\r\n  for law and order, love of liberty and of education, and interest in\r\n  all those things that make the communities where they abide prosperous\r\n  and happy. I think I owe a special debt to this neighborhood for a\r\n  pair of good Vermont horses that Secretary Proctor selected for me,\r\n  and in the driving of which I have had great relaxation and pleasure.\r\n  Your Vermont horses are well trained. The Morgan horse has the good\r\n  habit of entering into consultation with the driver whenever there is\r\n  any trouble. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST. JOHNSBURY, VERMONT, AUGUST 26.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief stops were made at Wells River, McIndoes, and Barnet, and the\r\nPresident cordially thanked the people at each place. St. Johnsbury,\r\nwhere great preparations were made to welcome the distinguished guest,\r\nwas reached at 4:30 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe President's party headed a procession which moved through the\r\nprincipal streets over a distance of two miles. The guard of honor\r\nconsisted of 300 mounted veterans with drawn swords. The following\r\nprominent citizens met the President: Col. Franklin Fairbanks, Hon.\r\nJonathan Ross, Chief Justice of Vermont, and Mrs. Ross; Rev. Dr. C. M.\r\nLamson, L. D. Hazen, A. H. McLeod, Charles T. Walter, Hon. H. H. Powers,\r\nCol. Frederick Fletcher, H. H. Carr, C. H. Stevens, E. H. Blossom, S. H.\r\nBrackett, Lucius K. Hazen, Osborne Chase, George H. Cross, N. P. Bowman,\r\nAlbert Worcester, H. I. Woods, Dr. G. B. Bullard, A. F. Walker, C. P.\r\nCarpenter, N. R. Switser, F. A. Carter, L. W. Fisher, J. B. Gage, C.\r\nH. Horton, L. N. Smythe, and Wm. H. Sargent. An incident of the parade\r\nwas the reception by the school children. The President's carriage\r\nhalted and several hundred of the children, led by H. H. May, rendered\r\n\"America,\" at the conclusion of which six pretty little girls--Misses\r\nMay Masten, Lala McNeil, Marian Moore, Lottie Holder, Beatrice May,\r\nand Emma May--stepped forward and presented a beautiful floral key,\r\nthus tendering the freedom of the city to the illustrious guest. The\r\nPresident reviewed the procession from \"Undercliffe,\" the stately\r\nresidence of Colonel and Mrs. Fairbanks, whose guest he was.\r\n\r\nAt night the town was brilliantly illuminated, and 10,000 residents\r\ngathered in the public park. Colonel Fairbanks made the welcoming\r\naddress and introduced the President, who received an ovation and spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I could wish that I were in better voice and\r\n  in full strength, that I might better respond to this most magnificent\r\n  demonstration. I have rarely looked upon a scene more calculated\r\n  to inspire a patriot than this upon which my eye rests to-night. I\r\n  do most profoundly thank you for this great welcome. The taste and\r\n  beauty and elaboration of these preparations exceed anything that I\r\n  have looked upon in this journey. [Applause.] I am sure you are here\r\n  to-night after making all this preparation to give witness by your\r\n  presence of your love to the flag of our country [applause] and to\r\n  those institutions of civil government and of liberty which that flag\r\n  represents. [Applause.] It gives me great pleasure to see that the\r\n  flag is everywhere. I journeyed across this continent, and, except\r\n  when darkness shut in the landscape, I was never out of sight of the\r\n  American flag. [Applause.] On those wide plains of the West, once\r\n  called the Great American Desert, now and again, in the home of some\r\n  adventurous settler, the flag appeared and was waved in greeting as\r\n  our train sped on its way. I rejoiced to see it everywhere in the\r\n  sight of school children. On that great demonstration in New York in\r\n  observance of the centennial of the inauguration of Washington, as I\r\n  moved from the Battery up through those streets dedicated to commerce,\r\n  I saw every front covered with flags, hiding for the time those\r\n  invitations to trade which covered their walls. The thought occurred\r\n  to me, What will be done with these flags when this celebration is\r\n  over? And it occurred to me to suggest at the centennial banquet\r\n  that the flags should be taken into our school-houses. [Applause.]\r\n  I rejoice to know that everywhere throughout the land, in all our\r\n  patriotic towns and villages, movements are being inaugurated to\r\n  display the American flag over our institutions of learning.\r\n\r\n  I have several times been brought in contact with incidents showing\r\n  this love of the flag. I remember that when Hood was investing\r\n  Nashville, and when that gallant, sturdy, unostentatious, but always\r\n  faithful and victorious leader, Gen. George H. Thomas, was gathering\r\n  the remnants of an army that he might confront his adversary in\r\n  battle, it was assigned to me to intrench through the beautiful\r\n  grounds of a resident in the suburbs of Nashville. The proprietor was\r\n  a Tennessee Unionist. While I was digging and tearing the sod of his\r\n  beautiful lawn, he was removing his library and other valuables from\r\n  his mansion, for it was within easy range of the rebel fire. Happening\r\n  into his library while he was thus engaged, he opened a closet below\r\n  the book-shelf, and, taking out a handsome bunting, asked me whether I\r\n  had a garrison flag. I told him no. \"Well,\" he said, \"take this. Sir,\r\n  I have never been without the American flag in my house.\" [Applause.]\r\n  I would be glad if that could be said by every one of our people.\r\n  There is inspiration in it. It has a story wrought into its every fold\r\n  until every thread has some lesson to tell of sacrifice and heroism.\r\n  It is the promise of all that we hope for. It is to it and about it\r\n  that we must gather and hold the affections of our people if these\r\n  institutions are to be preserved. I have it in my mind as I saw it one\r\n  night in Newport harbor. Going out of that harbor upon a Government\r\n  vessel about midnight, when the heavens were darkened clouds, I saw\r\n  a sight that lives fresh in my memory. The officers of the torpedo\r\n  station had run up the Starry Banner upon the staff, and turned upon\r\n  it as we moved out of the harbor two great electric search-lights. It\r\n  revealed the banner, while the staff and buildings below it were all\r\n  hidden in the blackness. I could see it as if it had been hung out\r\n  of the battlements of heaven, lifting its folds in the darkness of\r\n  night, a glorified emblem of the hope of a free people. [Applause.]\r\n  Let us keep it thus in our hearts; let no other flag be borne in our\r\n  marching processions. We have no place for the red flag of anarchy.\r\n  [Applause.] This emblem typifies a free people, who have voluntarily\r\n  placed themselves under the restraints of the law, who have consented\r\n  that individual liberty shall cease where it infringes upon the right\r\n  or property of another. This is our contract. This is the liberty\r\n  which we offer those who cast in their lot with us, not a liberty to\r\n  destroy, but a liberty to conserve and perpetuate. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  I am most happy to witness in this prosperous New England town so\r\n  many evidences that your community is intelligent, industrious,\r\n  enterprising, and your people lovers of home and order. You have here\r\n  some great manufacturing establishments, whose fame and products have\r\n  spread throughout the world. You have here a class of enterprising,\r\n  public-spirited citizens, who are building these free libraries and\r\n  galleries of art and are ministering to the good of generations that\r\n  are to come. You have here an intelligent and educated class of\r\n  skilled workmen, and nothing pleased me more as I passed through your\r\n  streets to-day than to be told that here and there were the homes of\r\n  the working people of St. Johnsbury [applause]--homes where every\r\n  evidence of comfort was apparent; homes where taste has been brought\r\n  to make attractive the abodes where tired men sought rest; homes that\r\n  must have been made sweet for the children that are reared there,\r\n  and comfortable for the wives whose place of toil and responsibility\r\n  it is. Here is the anchor of our safety. This is the state that\r\n  binds men to good order, to good citizenship, to the flag of the\r\n  Constitution, a contented and prosperous working class. [Applause.]\r\n  I will not cross any lines of division in my remarks to night, for\r\n  this reception is general; but I will venture to say that all our\r\n  public policy, all our legislation, may wisely keep in view the end\r\n  of perpetuating an independent, contented, prosperous and hopeful\r\n  working class in America. [Applause.] When hope goes out of the heart\r\n  and life becomes so hard that it is no longer sweet, men are not safe\r\n  neighbors and they are not good citizens, Let us, then, in cheerful,\r\n  loving, Christian good neighborhood see that the blessings of our\r\n  institutions, the fruits of labor, have that fair distribution that\r\n  shall bring contentment into our homes. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  But, my countrymen, I did not intend to speak even so long. I wish\r\n  it were in my power to make some adequate return for the generous\r\n  welcome you have given me. I am not a man of promises. I abhor\r\n  pretension, but every such assembly as this that I see--this great cup\r\n  of good-will which you put to my lips--gives me strength to do what I\r\n  can for our country and for you. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLINGS PARK, AUGUST 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the presidential party left St. Johnsbury on the morning of the\r\n27th, they were joined by Hon. A. A. Woolson, C. S. Forbes, ex-Governor\r\nFarnham, and ex-Senator Pingree. At White River Junction the President's\r\ncar was switched to a siding running to Billings Park, where the Vermont\r\nAssociation of Road and Trotting Horse Breeders was holding its annual\r\nexhibition. Senator Morrill, Col. Geo. W. Hooker, and Capt. A. W. Davis\r\naccompanied the party to the park, where carriages conveyed them over\r\nthe grounds. A large crowd was present.\r\n\r\nCol. Hooker, as President of the Association, introduced President\r\nHarrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Hooker and Fellow-citizens_--I have been called upon to\r\n  address my fellow-citizens under many diverse and some very peculiar\r\n  circumstances, but I think that those that surround me this morning\r\n  are absolutely unique. I understood that in the programme Secretary\r\n  Proctor had arranged for a day of pleasure here at this horse fair,\r\n  and that a more attractive entertainment was to be provided for you\r\n  and for me than speech-making. I am not well up in the rules of the\r\n  track, but I suppose on a morning like this some allowance will be\r\n  made for a heavy track, and if the horses are entitled to it I think\r\n  I may claim an allowance myself. [Laughter.] Therefore, I have only\r\n  to thank you for the friendliness of your reception and to express\r\n  my interest in this great industry which is represented here--the\r\n  breeding of horses. I understand that it was so arranged that, after I\r\n  had seen the flower of the manhood and womanhood of Vermont, I should\r\n  be given an exhibition of the next grade in intelligence and worth in\r\n  the State--your good horses. [Applause.] I have had recently, through\r\n  the intervention of the Secretary of War, the privilege of coming into\r\n  possession of a pair of Vermont horses. They are all I could wish for,\r\n  and, as I said the other day at the little village from which they\r\n  came, they are of good Morgan stock, of which some one has said that\r\n  their great characteristic was that they enter into consultation with\r\n  the driver whenever there is any difficulty. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n  Thanking you again, I hope you will give me the allowance to which a\r\n  heavy track entitles me. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADFORD, VERMONT, AUGUST 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Bradford 1,000 people assembled to do honor to the President, who\r\narrived at 10 A.M. The visitors were escorted to a platform near the\r\nstation. Among the prominent residents who welcomed the Chief Executive\r\nwere H. E. Parker, Judge S. M. Gleason, Roswell Farnham, John H. Watson,\r\nDr. J. H. Jones, and L. J. Brown.\r\n\r\nEx-Governor Farnham introduced the President, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen_--I will only say a few words to thank you for\r\n  this welcome which is extended to me this morning, and which it seems\r\n  to me furnishes some proof of your well wishes and kindly feelings. I\r\n  have had a journey through Vermont that will be very pleasant in my\r\n  recollection, although attended with some instances of an unpleasant\r\n  nature. As I understood the purpose of this trip when I gave my\r\n  assent to it at the request of your excellent fellow-citizen, whom\r\n  you kindly loaned me for a little while, and are now, as far as I can\r\n  see, about to reclaim, the trip was to be one of relaxation, and to\r\n  visit him and some of his friends. It seems to me that the circle has\r\n  been enlarged beyond the limit of his friends, and if not that they\r\n  include the whole of the people of Vermont. It is very pleasant to\r\n  pass through your enterprising manufacturing towns, and to see this\r\n  rural population, which, after all, is the foundation of all State\r\n  organizations, which are based upon the farms of old New England. The\r\n  farm has been, perhaps, one of the most productive measures toward\r\n  the enrichment of this country in things that are greater than the\r\n  material things--in manhood, valor in warfare, and statesmanship in\r\n  political life. It has been a matter of great pleasure to me as we\r\n  have driven through the streets of these cities, from Bennington until\r\n  this time, to observe one thing. As we pass by your streets I have\r\n  seen some aged father or mother or grandfather or grandmother placed\r\n  in a position for best observation and kindly attended by some member\r\n  of the family, showing that family love, that veneration for the aged,\r\n  that has, to me, been a source of particular gratification. For, after\r\n  all, the home is the beginning and centre of all good things. The\r\n  life of our Nation is learned in the first rudiments of government\r\n  at home and that lesson of veneration for things that are good. With\r\n  these elements I think you are sure to make the career of Vermont not\r\n  greater in temporary things, but greater in those things which are\r\n  more productive to the Nation and to mankind. [Prolonged cheers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINDSOR, VERMONT, AUGUST 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was raining when the President arrived at Windsor, at 1 P.M. He was\r\nmet by Senator William M. Evarts, accompanied by Hon. C. C. Beaman,\r\nof New York; Hon. Chester Pike, of Cornish, N. H., and the following\r\nprominent citizens, comprising the local Committee of Reception: Col.\r\nMarsh O. Perkins, Dwight Tuxbury, Hon. G. A. Davis, Dr. C. P. Holden,\r\nDr. J. S. Richmond, U. L. Comings, George T. Low, Hon. Rollin Amsden,\r\nE. C. Howard, Charles H. Fitch, O. L. Patrick, Rev. E. N. Goddard, S.\r\nN. Stone, S. R. Bryant, J. M. Howe, George T. Hazen, S. M. Blood, S. E.\r\nHoisington, Horace Weston, A. E. Houghton, A. J. Hunter, Allen Dudley,\r\nDr. Deane Richmond, J. R. Brewster, A. D. Cotton, G. R. Guernsey,\r\nCharles N. Adams, Col. M. K. Paine, H. W. Stocker, George M. Stone,\r\nHarvey Miller, George T. Winn, and C. D. Penniman.\r\n\r\nAfter partaking of luncheon at the residence of Senator and Mrs. Evarts,\r\nthe President was conducted to the Town Hall, and, being introduced to\r\nthe assemblage by Colonel Perkins, he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I am about completing a very pleasant trip\r\n  through the State of Vermont--a trip which, while not the first,\r\n  has furnished the only occasion on which I have really been brought\r\n  in contact with the people of your State. My previous journeys were\r\n  those of a summer tourist, snatching these fine and attractive views\r\n  as we sped along some of your lines of railway, but getting little\r\n  impression of the character of the people who occupy these towns and\r\n  rural homesteads. It has given me great pleasure on this occasion\r\n  to receive at the hands of your people everywhere a most cordial\r\n  reception, It has been a source of constant regret to me that I am\r\n  able on such occasions as we have here this afternoon to make so\r\n  small a return for the care, preparation, and friendly interest which\r\n  the people manifest. I am under such limitations as to them and\r\n  about which I may talk that the fertility of a very rich and highly\r\n  cultivated mind and imagination would be necessary to furnish one\r\n  with something new or interesting to say in response to the repeated\r\n  calls. I have supposed that all of these meetings were expressions\r\n  of patriotism and of popular interest in a Government which Mr.\r\n  Lincoln so felicitously described as \"a government of the people, by\r\n  the people, for the people.\" [Applause.] It is pleasant to have the\r\n  personal esteem and respect of my fellow-citizens, but I have not\r\n  thought of appropriating to myself these demonstrations. It is very\r\n  gratifying to see a people in love with their civil institutions and\r\n  with that glorious flag which typifies our diversity and our unity.\r\n  [Applause.] I have said before that it seemed to me this is the\r\n  essential element and base of every republican government, that the\r\n  loyalty and love of the people should be given to our institutions\r\n  and not to men. [Applause.] I think it is one element of discord and\r\n  unhappiness in some of our sister republics that the minds of these\r\n  patriotic and generous people are too much swayed by their admiration\r\n  for men, that they are often swept away from the moorings of principle\r\n  by the love of a leader. I have rejoiced to find everywhere in the\r\n  State of Vermont what seemed to me to be a deep-seated, earnest\r\n  patriotism. [Applause.] It is to be hoped that we may not soon have\r\n  any call for such manifestations as you have given in the past on the\r\n  battle-fields from Bennington to the surrender of Appomattox. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  It is pleasant to be here to day at the home of my esteemed friend\r\n  and your fellow-townsman, the Hon. William M. Evarts. [Applause.] I\r\n  am glad that he has introduced into Vermont model farming [laughter\r\n  and applause], and has shown you what the income of a large city\r\n  law practice can do in the fertilization of a farm. [Laughter and\r\n  applause.] He has assured me to-day that his farm yields a net income.\r\n  I accept the statement of my host with absolute faith--and yet Mr.\r\n  Evarts' reputation as a bookkeeper is not the best in the world.\r\n  [Laughter and applause.] It is pleasant to see him and to be for a\r\n  while in his genial presence, and to have this journey illuminated by\r\n  a visit to his home. I hope he may dwell long with you in peace and\r\n  honor, as he will always dwell in the honor and esteem of our whole\r\n  people. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLESTOWN, NEW HAMPSHIRE, AUGUST 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the heavy downpour, 1,000 or more sturdy citizens of\r\nhistoric old Charlestown welcomed the President to New Hampshire. The\r\nReception Committee consisted of Hon. George Olcott, George S. Bond,\r\nFrank Finnigan, Col. Samuel Webber, Herbert W. Bond, and Frank W.\r\nHamlin. Lincoln Post, G. A. R., Lyman F. Partridge Commander, also\r\nparticipated in the reception. Colonel Webber delivered an eloquent\r\naddress of welcome.\r\n\r\nThe President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Colonel Webber and Fellow-citizens_--I think it might be said\r\n  to-day that New Hampshire has \"gone wet,\" as they say when the\r\n  election returns come in on a vote against prohibition. I am very much\r\n  obliged to you for this extraordinary manifestation of your interest,\r\n  for to stand in this downpour of rain is certainly an evidence that\r\n  you have a most friendly interest in this little party of tourists,\r\n  who touch in a journey through Vermont the mainspring of the State of\r\n  New Hampshire. I have been talking about Vermont for the last two or\r\n  three days, but if you will take the pains, in the comfort of your own\r\n  homesteads, to read all the good things I have said about Vermont,\r\n  and then understand that they are all said of New Hampshire, it will\r\n  abbreviate my speech and will be expressive of my opinion of that\r\n  sturdy, enterprising, masterful New England character which you share\r\n  with them. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLOWS FALLS, VERMONT, AUGUST 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the train arrived at Bellows Falls, the rain was pouring in\r\ntorrents and the President was conducted to the Opera House by the\r\nveterans of E. H. Stoughton Post, G. A. R. The Committee of Reception\r\nconsisted of Hon. Wm. A. Russell, Hon. A. N. Swain, Judge L. M. Read,\r\nBarnes Cannon, Jr., Wyman Flint, John T. Moore, C. W. Osgood, Thomas\r\nE. O'Brien, George H. Babbitt, and Capt. Walter Taylor, the latter a\r\nveteran of eighty years, who marshalled the hosts for Gen. Wm. Henry\r\nHarrison in 1836 and '40. The building was packed.\r\n\r\nMr. Swain introduced President Harrison, who said:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens_--I will wait a moment until they turn out the\r\n  footlights. They put a barrier between us, and I always prefer to get\r\n  my light from above. [Applause.] We can only tarry in this busy city\r\n  a few moments. The inclement character of the day has driven us to\r\n  shelter, and the finding of a shelter has consumed some small part\r\n  of the allotment of time which our schedule gives to you. I greatly\r\n  appreciate the value and importance of these manufacturing centres,\r\n  which are now, fortunately for us, not characteristic of New England\r\n  alone, but are found west of the Ohio and of the Mississippi and of\r\n  the Missouri. I am one of those who believe that in a diversification\r\n  of pursuits we make most rapid increase in wealth and attain best\r\n  social relations and development. I am one of those who believe\r\n  that Providence did not set apart the United States to be a purely\r\n  agricultural region, furnishing its surplus to supply the lack of\r\n  other people of the world while they do all the manufacturing for us.\r\n  I think there are suggestions in our very geographical position, and\r\n  a great many of them in our history and experience, that we may well\r\n  desire and reach for that condition in which we shall raise our own\r\n  food and in which a manufacturing class, withdrawn from agriculture\r\n  and other pursuits, shall furnish the farmer a market for his surplus\r\n  near to his fields and gardens, while he exchanges with the farmer the\r\n  products of the shop and the loom.\r\n\r\n  I would not introduce politics. I do not intend to cross any lines\r\n  of division, but I think we all agree, though we may differ as to\r\n  the means by which it is to be done, that the nearer together the\r\n  producer and the consumer can be brought the less waste there is in\r\n  transportation and the greater the wealth. [Applause.] It is known\r\n  to you all that our 65,000,000 people furnish per capita a larger\r\n  market than any other like number of people. This grows out of the\r\n  fact that our capacity for purchasing is larger than is found in those\r\n  countries where poverty holds a larger sway. The workingman buys\r\n  more, has more to buy with in America than in any other land in the\r\n  world. [Applause.] I mentioned the other day at St. Albans that this\r\n  was the era of the battle for a market. The whole world is engaged in\r\n  it. The thought was suggested to me by a sentence in the address of\r\n  President Bartlett at the observance of the centennial of the battle\r\n  of Bennington in 1877. He says, \"Trading Manchester furnished two\r\n  regiments to Burgoyne to conquer a market.\" The foreign policy of\r\n  the United States has never been selfish. There has always been, if\r\n  you will trace it through the struggles of Greece and of our South\r\n  American neighbors for independence and a free Government, a brave,\r\n  generous tone of sympathy with struggling people the world round in\r\n  our diplomatic policy. I think we may well challenge comparison with\r\n  the foreign policy of any other great Government in the world in this\r\n  regard. It has never been our policy to push our trade forward at the\r\n  point of the bayonet. We have always believed that it should be urged\r\n  upon the ground of mutual advantage; and upon this ground alone are we\r\n  now endeavoring, by every means in our power, to open the markets of\r\n  our sister republics in Central and South America to the products of\r\n  American shops and farmers. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  We do not covet their territory. The day of filibustering aggression\r\n  has gone by in the United States. We covet their good will. We wish\r\n  for them settled institutions of government, and we desire those\r\n  exchanges that are mutually profitable. We have found that we were\r\n  receiving from some of these countries enormous annual imports of\r\n  sugar, coffee, and hides, and we have now placed these articles on the\r\n  free list upon the condition that they give to the products of the\r\n  United States fair reciprocity. [Applause.] If our own laws, or any\r\n  aggressive movement we are making for a larger share in the commerce\r\n  of the world, should excite the commercial jealousy and rivalry of\r\n  other countries we shall not complain if those rivalries find only\r\n  proper expressions. We have come to a time in our development as a\r\n  Nation when I believe that interest on money is low enough for us to\r\n  turn some of our accumulated capital from the railways into steam\r\n  transportation on the sea; that the time has come when we shall\r\n  recover a full participation in the carrying trade of the world,\r\n  when under the American flag steamships shall carry our products to\r\n  neighboring markets and bring back their exchange to our harbors.\r\n  Larger foreign markets for the products of our farms and of our\r\n  factories and a larger share in the carrying trade of the world,\r\n  peaceful relations with all mankind, with naval and coast defences\r\n  that will silently make an effective argument on the side of peace,\r\n  are the policies that I would pursue. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRATTLEBORO, VERMONT, AUGUST 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before the train reached Brattleboro the rain ceased, and the\r\nPresident rode in a procession to the house of Col. J. J. Estey. The\r\nCommittee of Reception consisted of Colonel Estey, Col. Kittredge\r\nHaskins, Dr. H. D. Holton, N. I. Hawley, F. W. Childs, ex-Governor\r\nHolbrook, Judge Wheeler, Hon. B. D. Harris, Hon. J. L. Martin, E. C.\r\nCrosby, Judge R. W. Clarke, C. F. Thompson, Col. W. C. Holbrook, George\r\nS. Dowley, Colonel Fuller, Dr. Conland, Dr. Ketchum, and G. A. Hines.\r\nVeterans of the G. A. R., and the Estey Guard, escorted the Chief\r\nExecutive through the city. Several thousand were assembled on the\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nColonel Estey welcomed and presented the President, who made the\r\nfollowing address:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow citizens_--Governor Proctor held out to me the suggestion\r\n  that this trip to Vermont would be a very restful one. He has the\r\n  queerest appreciation of what rest means of any man I know. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  When I attended the centennial demonstration of the inauguration\r\n  of Washington in New York, I spent part of one day on the bridge of\r\n  the _Despatch_ bowing to the fleet in the bay as we moved down to\r\n  the Battery, and the balance of the day shaking hands at the City\r\n  Hall, attending a ball at night; ten hours the next day reviewing a\r\n  procession, with a banquet at night; and about as many hours the day\r\n  following reviewing the civic procession; and when released from the\r\n  stand about 5 o'clock in the evening I hurried to the Jersey City\r\n  depot to take the train, scarcely able to stand upon my feet. One\r\n  of the gentlemen of the committee said to me: \"Well, Mr. President,\r\n  I hope you have enjoyed these three days of rest in New York.\"\r\n  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  I wish I could see you more satisfactorily than I am able to do on a\r\n  hurried trip like this, but Governor Proctor kept me up very late last\r\n  night, and he was the last man down to breakfast this morning himself.\r\n\r\n  All that I have seen in your State has but increased the respect I\r\n  have always entertained for your people. My recent journey of somewhat\r\n  great length through the country has very deeply impressed upon me the\r\n  fact of the unity of our people. The building of these great railroad\r\n  lines making every part of every State familiar, and stretching across\r\n  the continent so as to bring within easy access the most distant parts\r\n  of our country, has had a great tendency to unify our people and to\r\n  wipe out whatever there was provincial or local in our character. It\r\n  has rubbed off some of the edges of the New England character, and\r\n  has rubbed on some of the New England polish upon the West. In fact,\r\n  wherever we have any combining, nothing makes it homogeneous except\r\n  a thorough mixer, and the American people have certainly had a most\r\n  thorough mixing. [Cheers.]\r\n\r\n  One of your war Governors was saying to me to-day, as we came along\r\n  in the train, your own distinguished fellow-citizen, that on a journey\r\n  West not long ago everywhere Vermont men came to meet him; and as I\r\n  went recently across the continent the railroad train scarcely stopped\r\n  at any station that some one from Indiana did not reach up his hand\r\n  and claim recognition; and so it is in all the States.\r\n\r\n  The West is now turning a little back toward the East, and I have\r\n  found some people, who probably had some ancestral connection with\r\n  New England, but whose birth, early residence, and business life\r\n  were in the West, who have come back to the old home. All this is\r\n  pleasant, all this is surety of the future of our country. It is\r\n  pleasant to know that the South is being obliterated, that all that\r\n  made it distinctive in the sense of separation or alienation is being\r\n  gradually wiped out. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Of course, the prejudices of generations are not like marks upon\r\n  the blackboard, that can be rubbed out with a sponge. These are more\r\n  like the deep glacial lines that the years have left in the rock; but\r\n  the water, when that surface is exposed to its quiet, gentle, and\r\n  perpetual influence, wears even these out, until the surface is smooth\r\n  and uniform. And so these influences are at work in our whole country,\r\n  and we should be hopeful for it, hopeful for its future. I am sure you\r\n  each feel pride in your American citizenship, and would show readiness\r\n  to defend it in war, and I am sure that from every class of your\r\n  community would come the response: \"We will maintain it, honorable and\r\n  high, in peace.\"\r\n\r\n  I thank you most sincerely for your friendly greeting, and regret\r\n  that I am not able to speak to you more satisfactorily, and can only\r\n  accept with a heart full of appreciation these marks of your respect.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTLAND, VERMONT, AUGUST 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President and his party were guests of Secretary Proctor on the\r\nnight of the 27th, at the village of Proctor, in the Green Mountains.\r\nThe morning of the 28th, the party visited Rutland, and were met by\r\nthe local Reception Committee: J. C. Baker, H. H. Dyer, W. G. Veazey,\r\nex-Judge Barrett, J. W. Cramton, Dr. J. D. Hanrahan, C. H. Joyce, J.\r\nN. Woodfin, E. P. Gilson, P. W. Clement, George E. Lawrence, Henry\r\nF. Field, John N. Baxter, P. M. Meldon, John A. Sheldon, George J.\r\nWardwell, Dr. Norman Seaver, and Henry Carpenter, President of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nArrived at Memorial Hall the President was greeted by a large\r\nassemblage, including many ladies. He was presented by Colonel Baker and\r\nmade the following address:\r\n\r\n  _My Fellow-citizens and Comrades of the Grand Army of the\r\n  Republic_--It gives me great pleasure this morning, tired as I am,\r\n  to see and to have an opportunity to express my thanks to this large\r\n  assemblage of the good citizens of Rutland. My journey through your\r\n  State has been attended with every evidence of respect which it was\r\n  possible for the people to bestow. Your chairman has spoken of the\r\n  fact that the President of the United States may travel everywhere\r\n  through our country without any attendance of policemen. As I have\r\n  had occasion to say before, the only peril he is likely to meet, if\r\n  the railroads take good care of him and the cranks keep out of the\r\n  way, is from the over-kindness of the people [laughter and applause];\r\n  and there is more peril in that than you will understand at first\r\n  thought. It is pleasant to stand upon the steps of this Memorial\r\n  Hall, erected as a place of deposit for trophies of the great Civil\r\n  War and as a monument of honor to those soldiers from Vermont who\r\n  aided so conspicuously in making that war successful. We cannot tell\r\n  how much hung upon that contest. No orator has yet been inspired to\r\n  describe adequately the gravity of the great issue which was fought\r\n  out upon the battle-fields of the War of the Rebellion. We say it was a\r\n  contest to preserve the unity of our republic, and so it was; but what\r\n  dismemberment would have meant; how greatly it would have increased\r\n  the cost of government; how sadly it would have disturbed the plan\r\n  of our border communities; how it would have degraded in the eyes of\r\n  the world this great people; how it would have rejoiced the enemies\r\n  of popular government, no tongue has yet adequately described. But\r\n  it was not to be so. God has desired that this experiment of free\r\n  government should have a more perfect trial, and it was impossible\r\n  that the brave men of the loyal States should consent to dismemberment\r\n  of the Union. We were very patient, so patient, in the early contest,\r\n  as it ranged through the great debate of convention and Congress that\r\n  our brethren of the South altogether mistook the temper of our people.\r\n  Undoubtedly there were evidences that the men of trade were reluctant\r\n  to have those lines of profitable communication, which had been so\r\n  long maintained with the South, broken off. Undoubtedly that character\r\n  so undesirable in our politics--the doughface--was particularly\r\n  conspicuous in those days of discussion, but we were altogether\r\n  misjudged when the people of the South concluded that they might\r\n  support their threats of disunion which had so long rung in Congress,\r\n  and so long filled their boasting press, by force of arms.\r\n\r\n  I shall never forget, nor will any of you who are old enough to\r\n  remember it, that great electric thrill and shock which passed through\r\n  our whole country when the first gun was fired at Sumter. Debate was\r\n  closed. Our orators were withdrawn, and a great wave of determined\r\n  patriotism swept over the country higher than any tidal wave ever\r\n  lifted itself upon a devastated coast [applause], and it was not to be\r\n  stayed in its progress until the last vestige of rebellion had been\r\n  swept from the face of our beloved land. The men of New England were a\r\n  peaceful people. The farmers and the farmers' sons were not brawlers.\r\n  They were not found at the tavern. They were abiding under the\r\n  sheltering moral influences and quietude of these New England hills.\r\n  But the man who thought that the spirit of 1776 had been quenched was\r\n  badly mistaken. The same resolute love of liberty, the same courage\r\n  to face danger for a cause that had its inspiration in high moral\r\n  purposes and resolves abided in the hearts of your people. [Applause.]\r\n  Possibly the war might have been avoided if the South had understood\r\n  this, but it was so written in the severe but benevolent purposes of\r\n  God. There was a great scroll of emancipation to be written. There was\r\n  a martyr President, who was to affix his name to a declaration that\r\n  would be as famous as that to which your fathers fixed their signature\r\n  in 1776. It was to be in truth as well as in theory a free people\r\n  [applause], and there was no other pathway to emancipation than along\r\n  the bloody track of armies, not seeing at the beginning nor having\r\n  the purpose that finally was accomplished, but guided by the hand of\r\n  power and wisdom that is above us and over us to the accomplishment of\r\n  that glorious result that struck the shackles from four millions of\r\n  slaves. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I greet most affectionately these comrades of the war who are before\r\n  me to-day. Let them abide in honor in all your communities. Let\r\n  shafts of marble and bronze lift themselves in all your towns to tell\r\n  the story of patriots' work well done and to teach the generations\r\n  that are to come how worthy their fathers were. Let us preserve all\r\n  these inspiring lessons of history, all these individual examples of\r\n  heroism, of which Vermont furnished so many during the war. Let them\r\n  not be forgotten. Let them be the illuminated and inspiring pages of\r\n  your State's history, and then, whatever shock may come to us in the\r\n  future, whenever the hand of anarchy or disorder shall be raised,\r\n  whenever foreign powers shall seek to invade the rights or liberties\r\n  of this great people, there will be found again an impenetrable\r\n  bulwark in the brave hearts of a sturdy and patriotic people.\r\n  [Applause.] You will, I am sure, crown your kindness by excusing\r\n  me from attempting further speech and allowing me to express, as I\r\n  part from you, my good wishes for Vermont and all her good people.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCTOR, VERMONT, AUGUST 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the return to Proctor in the evening the President was tendered the\r\nfinal reception of his trip to Vermont. The village was elaborately\r\ndecorated; an illuminated evergreen arch spanned the entrance to\r\nSecretary Proctor's beautiful grounds. The residences and grounds of E.\r\nR. Morse, F. D. Proctor, B. F. Taylor, W. E. Higbee, G. H. Davis, E. J.\r\nBoyce, J. H. Edson, and H. E. Spencer were also brilliantly illuminated.\r\nFrom a platform fronting the Secretary's home the party reviewed the\r\nprocession of 1,000 workmen from the marble quarries.\r\n\r\nSecretary Proctor, in an affectionate address, introduced President\r\nHarrison, who spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n  It is not my privilege to call you neighbors, but I am sure I may\r\n  call you friends. This journey in Vermont is crowned to-night by a\r\n  reception and a good-by that is surpassingly brilliant and artistic\r\n  in its preparation and one that I have never seen exceeded. But\r\n  above all this, I have been able here in Proctor to witness in its\r\n  best manifestation that which I have seen elsewhere in New England\r\n  and especially in Vermont--a community of workers, men industriously\r\n  pursuing mechanical avocations and doing it under conditions of\r\n  the greatest possible comfort. As I look upon these homes in which\r\n  you dwell and contrast them with the wretchedness of the crowded\r\n  tenement-houses of our great cities; as I inhale to-night the bracing\r\n  air of these mountains, and as my eye has looked to-day upon their\r\n  green summits, I have said how happy is the lot of that man and that\r\n  woman who work in one of these bright, wholesome New England villages.\r\n  [Applause.] It has seemed to me that the relation of our mutual friend\r\n  who has inaugurated and developed these works in which many of you\r\n  find employment was that of a public benefactor and a personal friend.\r\n  [Applause.] The simplicity and naturalness of his own life among you,\r\n  his ready appreciation of the loyalty and intelligence of those who\r\n  are employed by him, his interest in their success in life, is the\r\n  ideal relation between the employer and his workmen. [Applause.] I\r\n  would to God it was always and everywhere so, that when a man is put\r\n  at a machine he should not be regarded by his employer as a part of\r\n  it, that the human nature, the aspirations of a man, should still be\r\n  recognized, and the relations with the employer be that of mutual\r\n  confidence and helpfulness and respect! [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  You are sharers in the responsibilities of local government, of the\r\n  government of your State and of the Nation, of which Vermont is one\r\n  of the honored members. I am sure that you have pride in the faithful\r\n  discharge of all these duties. I cannot but feel that our national\r\n  policy should be in the direction of saving our working people from\r\n  that condition of hopelessness which comes when wages are barely\r\n  adequate to the sustenance of animal life. [Applause.] There is no\r\n  hope for any community where this state of things exists, and there\r\n  will be no hope for the Nation should it become the general condition\r\n  of the workingmen of America. That man or woman out of whose heart\r\n  hope has gone, who sees nothing better in life, before whom the vista\r\n  of life stretches in one dead level of unending and half-requited\r\n  toil, that man's estate is calculated to make him reckless in\r\n  character. It is one of the beneficent conditions of citizenship here\r\n  that there are no disabilities put in the way of ambitions and the\r\n  aspiring. I hope it may always be so. I cannot always sympathize with\r\n  that demand which we hear so frequently for cheap things. Things may\r\n  be too cheap. They are too cheap when the man who produces them upon\r\n  the farm or the man or woman who produces them in the factory does not\r\n  get out of them living wages with a margin for old age and for a dowry\r\n  for the incidents that are to follow. [Applause.] I pity that man who\r\n  wants a coat so cheap that the man or woman who produces the cloth or\r\n  shapes it into a garment shall starve in the process. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  I am most profoundly grateful to you, my fellow-citizens, and to my\r\n  good friend Governor Proctor, for this beautiful demonstration--this\r\n  magnificent rural welcome which we have had here to-day. It will live\r\n  always in my memory. I shall carry this community in my thoughts as\r\n  one of the best types of American neighborhood life. I have found\r\n  in him a most valuable contribution to the administration of the\r\n  Government at Washington. [Applause.] You cannot know fully how he has\r\n  grown into the respect and confidence of all who have been associated\r\n  with him in the Cabinet and of all our legislators in Congress without\r\n  distinction of party. I regret that there is some danger that you may\r\n  reclaim him for Vermont [applause]; yet it is quite natural that it\r\n  should be so, and I shall do the best I can to get a substitute. The\r\n  labors of public office at Washington are full of high responsibility\r\n  and most burdensome toil. No man is endowed with an incapacity to make\r\n  mistakes. We can, however, all of us, in public or private trust,\r\n  be sure of our motives. These are our own. We can know whether we\r\n  are pursuing low and selfish ends or have set before us the general\r\n  good, the highest good of all our people. Judgment upon what has been\r\n  done is with you. I am sure only that I have had it in my heart to\r\n  do that which should in the highest degree promote the prosperity of\r\n  our people and lift the glorious flag yet higher in the esteem of the\r\n  world. [Great applause.] We have been endeavoring to open a foreign\r\n  market for American trade. If these efforts are met, as I trust they\r\n  will be, by enterprise on the part of our merchants and manufacturers,\r\n  I do not doubt that the next ten years will see a most gratifying\r\n  increase in our foreign trade. [Applause.] They should diligently set\r\n  themselves to the study of the new markets into which their goods may\r\n  now go. The most intelligent representatives should be sent there,\r\n  and their goods adapted to the market that is to be supplied. This I\r\n  have no doubt they will do, and I add the expectation that we shall\r\n  presently have a most gratifying increase in the American merchant\r\n  marine. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 17, 1891.\r\n\r\n_The Augusta Exposition._\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison on the above date received at the Executive Mansion\r\na delegation of prominent citizens of Georgia, who extended to him a\r\nformal invitation to attend the Augusta Exposition in November. The\r\ndelegation comprised the following citizens and Exposition directors:\r\nHon. Patrick Walsh, Walter M. Jackson, J. P. Verdery, H. G. Smith, J.\r\nL. Gow, C. H. Ballard, J. J. Doughty, W. A. Garrett, G. J. Howard, W.\r\nH. Landrum, J. E. Barton, W. E. Keener, Percy Burum, J. P. Bones, J. M.\r\nCranston, Crawford Mays, Maurice Walton, L. J. Henry, T. R. Gibson, P.\r\nJ. O'Connor, Jules Rival, Joseph Ganahl, Jr., W. H. Barrett, Jr., P.\r\nA. Stovall, W. E. Platt, A. J. Gouley, Frank X. Dorr, and Hon. J. C.\r\nClements.\r\n\r\nChairman Walsh, on behalf of the committee, made the invitation address,\r\nto which the President, responding, said:\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_--I recall with pleasure the visit made by some of\r\n  your representatives. I think I have repeatedly, on every suitable\r\n  occasion, especially during my recent visit to the South, expressed\r\n  my sincere hope of the development of those marvellous resources\r\n  so long hidden from sight, but now about to be opened up. I had\r\n  occasion to say then that you would realize the advantage of\r\n  combining manufactures with agriculture. The old system made of\r\n  Georgia a plantation State. I would not have it less so. But you may\r\n  still develop other industries without destroying the surface of\r\n  the country. There is no competition between these industries; one\r\n  does not supersede the other. The farmer still has his near market\r\n  for some products that will not bear transportation. Out of this\r\n  diversity I think the highest development will come. Recently I made\r\n  a trip through New England and was deeply impressed with the numerous\r\n  industries and small factories showing in little places, where the\r\n  lives and homes of the workmen were so much cleaner and purer than in\r\n  the great cities, and this was made possible by the great diversity\r\n  of small interests. In Vermont I came upon a busy little factory\r\n  surrounded by cottages in the midst of the hills. I was told that the\r\n  proprietor made stethoscopes, and out of a small beginning had built\r\n  up a great trade. These little things make happy homes; bring money,\r\n  trade, and development. I am greatly interested in these things, and\r\n  I would be very happy to see this development in Alabama and Georgia\r\n  as in any Northern State. We all wish it. Whether I can be with you\r\n  or not I cannot now say. I have a good many very important matters\r\n  demanding attention from now on to the meeting of Congress. Some are\r\n  home matters of importance and some are foreign. Looking back over\r\n  the last year, it would seem probable that there was a conspiracy\r\n  among the powers to see that those in responsible places should have\r\n  no rest. Many of these things must now come to my personal attention.\r\n  If I cannot be with you, you will know that my heart is with you. If\r\n  I can I will come, but the time now being so close to the meeting of\r\n  Congress it is doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., OCTOBER 17, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ecumenical Conference of the Methodist Church convened in the\r\nMetropolitan Church at Washington, D. C., on October 7, 1891. Rt. Rev.\r\nThomas Bowman, Senior Bishop of the Church in America, presided at\r\nthe opening, and Rev. William Arthur, M.A., of London, delivered the\r\ninaugural sermon. It was in every respect the greatest assembly in the\r\nhistory of Methodism.\r\n\r\nAmong a few of the distinguished preachers and orators from abroad were:\r\nRev. T. B. Stephenson, D.D., LL.D., Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, M.A., Rev.\r\nJohn Bond, Rev. F. W. Bourne, Rev. J. Ernest Clapham, and Rev. David\r\nJ. Waller, D.D., all of London. The following Washingtonians comprised\r\nthe Committee on Reception: Bishop J. F. Hurst, D.D.; Rev. G. H. Corey,\r\nD.D., Chairman; Rev. C. W. Baldwin, Rev. J. H. Becket, Rev. J. W. E.\r\nBowen, Rev. T. E. Carson, Rev. R. H. G. Dyson, Rev. George Elliott,\r\nRev. S. R. Murray, Rev. C. H. Phillips, Rev. J. A. Price, Rev. E. S.\r\nTodd, Rev. L. T. Widerman, Rev. J. T. Wightman, Rev. L. B. Wilson,\r\nAlexander Ashley, E. S. Atkinson, W. S. Birch, Gen. Cyrus Bussey, J. F.\r\nChestnut, D. S. Cissell, Robert Cohen, George Compton, L. A. Cornish,\r\nG. S. Deering, Robert Dunn, A. B. Duval, Hon. M. G. Emery, Prof. Edgar\r\nFrisbie, D. B. Groff, T. A. Harding, Gen. S. S. Henkle, W. H. Houghton,\r\nW. J. Hutchinson, Thomas Jarvis, B. F. Leighton, William Mayse, H. B.\r\nMoulton, Hon. Hiram Price, B. Robinson, W. J. Sibley, T. B. Stahl, B.\r\nH. Stinemetz, H. L. Strang, G. W. F. Swartzell, Frederick Tasker, J. S.\r\nTopham, L. H. Walker, E. S. Wescott, J. B. Wilson, and W. R. Woodward.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day of the Conference, President Harrison, escorted by\r\nRev. Dr. J. M. King, Secretary, and Rev. Dr. Corey, the pastor of\r\nMetropolitan Church, attended the session. Other distinguished visitors\r\nwere Secretary of the Treasury Foster, Secretary of the Interior Noble,\r\nand Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Minister.\r\n\r\nThe chief essay of the session was delivered by Mr. Thomas Snape, of\r\nLiverpool, upon the topic of the day, \"International Arbitration,\" a\r\nsubject which made the presence of the President and the British envoy\r\nparticularly appropriate.\r\n\r\nAs the President ascended to the pulpit, all the delegates and the great\r\naudience instantly arose. The presiding officer of the day, Rev. T. G.\r\nWilliams, of Montreal, presented the distinguished visitor, who was\r\nreceived with prolonged applause, in which the English delegates led.\r\n\r\nPresident Harrison then addressed the Conference as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Conference_--I come here this\r\n  morning to make an expression of my respect and esteem for this great\r\n  body of delegates assembled from all the countries of the world, and\r\n  much more to give a manifestation of my respect and love for that\r\n  greater body of Christian men and women for whom you stand. Every\r\n  Ecumenical Conference is a distinct step in the direction, not only\r\n  of the unification of the Church, but of the unification of the human\r\n  race.\r\n\r\n  Assembling from countries unlike in their civil institutions, from\r\n  churches not wholly in accord as to doctrine or church order, you\r\n  come together to find that the unlikeness is not so great as you\r\n  had thought, and to find your common sympathies and common purposes\r\n  greater and larger than you had thought--large enough presently to\r\n  overspread and to extinguish all these transitory lines of division.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that as followers of Wesley, whose hymns we sing,\r\n  you have been in consultation as to the methods by which these minor\r\n  divisions among you might be obliterated. It is the natural order that\r\n  subdivisions should be wiped out before the grand divisions of the\r\n  Church can be united. [Applause.] Who does not greatly rejoice that\r\n  the controversial clash of the churches is less than it once was; that\r\n  we hear more of the Master and His teachings of love and duty than of\r\n  hair-splitting theological differences? [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Many years ago, while visiting in Wisconsin, when Sunday came\r\n  around I went with some friends to the little Methodist church\r\n  in an adjoining village. The preacher undertook to overturn my\r\n  Presbyterianism. [Laughter and applause.] An irreverent friend who\r\n  sat beside me as the young man delivered his telling blows against\r\n  Calvinism was constantly emphasizing the points made by nudging me\r\n  with his elbow. [Laughter.] Now I am glad to say that very often since\r\n  then I have worshipped in Methodist churches, and that is the last\r\n  experience of that kind I have had. [Applause]\r\n\r\n  You have to-day as the theme of discussion the subject of\r\n  international arbitration; and this being a public, or, in a large\r\n  sense of the word, a political question, perhaps makes my presence\r\n  here as an officer of the United States especially appropriate.\r\n  [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is a curious incident that some days ago, and before I was aware\r\n  of the theme or the occasion which we have here this morning, I had\r\n  appointed this afternoon to visit the great gun foundry of the United\r\n  States at the navy yard. Things have come in their proper sequence. I\r\n  am here at this arbitration meeting before I go to the gun factory.\r\n  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  This subject is one that has long attracted the attention, and I\r\n  think I may say has, perhaps, as greatly attracted the interest and\r\n  adherence of the United States as that of any other Christian power in\r\n  the world. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  It is known to you all that in the recent conference of the American\r\n  states at Washington the proposition was distinctly made and adopted\r\n  by the representatives of all, or nearly all, of the governments\r\n  of America that, as applied to this hemisphere, all international\r\n  disputes should be settled by arbitration. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Of course there are limitations as yet, in the nature of things,\r\n  to the complete and general adoption of such a scheme. It is quite\r\n  possible to apply arbitration to a dispute as to a boundary line;\r\n  it is quite impossible, it seems to me, to apply it to a case of\r\n  international feud. If there is present a disposition to subjugate,\r\n  an aggressive spirit to seize territory, a spirit of national\r\n  aggrandizement that does not stop to consider the rights of other men\r\n  and other people--to such a case and to such a spirit international\r\n  arbitration has none, or, if any, a remote and difficult application.\r\n\r\n  It is for a Christian sentiment, manifesting itself in a nation, to\r\n  remove forever such causes of dispute; and then what remains will be\r\n  the easy subject of adjustment by fair international arbitration. But\r\n  I had not intended to enter into a discussion of this great theme, for\r\n  the setting forth of which you have appointed those who have given\r\n  it special attention. Let me, therefore, say simply this: that for\r\n  myself--temporarily in a place of influence in this country--and much\r\n  more for the great body of its citizenship, I express the desire of\r\n  America for peace with the whole world. [Applause.] It would have been\r\n  vain to suggest the pulling down of block-houses or family disarmament\r\n  to the settlers on a hostile Indian frontier. They would have told\r\n  you rightly that the conditions were not ripe. And so it may be and\r\n  is probably true that a full application of the principle is not\r\n  presently possible, the devil still being unchained. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n  We will have our gun foundries, and possibly will best promote the\r\n  settlement of international disputes by arbitration, by having it\r\n  understood that if the appeal is to a fiercer tribunal we shall not be\r\n  out of the debate. [Great applause.] There is a unity of the Church\r\n  and of humanity, and the lines of progress are the same.\r\n\r\n  It is by this great Christian sentiment, characterized not only by\r\n  a high sense of justice, but by a spirit of love and forbearance,\r\n  mastering the civil institutions and governments of the world, that\r\n  we shall approach universal peace and adopt arbitration methods of\r\n  settling disputes. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n  Let me thank you, Mr. Chairman, and you, gentlemen of this\r\n  Conference, for the privilege of standing before you for a moment, and\r\n  for this most cordial welcome which you have given to me. I beg to\r\n  express again my high appreciation of the character of this delegation\r\n  and the membership of the great Church from which you come, and to\r\n  wish that in your remaining deliberations and in your journeys to\r\n  far-distant homes you may have the guidance and care of that God whom\r\n  we all revere and worship. [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN TIN PLATE, OCTOBER 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the gubernatorial campaign in Ohio was in progress and Major\r\nMcKinley was making his famous race, the question as to the successful\r\nmanufacture of tin plate in the United States was one of the leading\r\nissues of the day. At this juncture W. C. Cronemyer, of the United\r\nStates Iron and Steel Tin Plate Works, at Demmler, Pa., sent President\r\nHarrison a box of tin plate manufactured at the Demmler works, and\r\nreceived in return the following interesting letter, which was given\r\nwide publicity at the time:\r\n\r\n                                EXECUTIVE MANSION, October 19, 1891.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR--I have your letter of October 15, and also a box of\r\n  bright tin plate which you send as a specimen of the product being\r\n  turned out by the United States Iron and Tin Plate Company. I have no\r\n  skill in determining the character of this work; but, to the eye, it\r\n  seems to be eminently satisfactory, and I thank you for this evidence\r\n  that a new industry has been established in the United States.\r\n\r\n  I cannot quite understand how an American can doubt that we have the\r\n  mechanical skill and business sagacity to establish successfully here\r\n  the manufacture of tin plate. No other country, certainly, surpasses\r\n  us in the inventive genius of its citizens or in the business sagacity\r\n  of its capitalists. It is surprising to me that any patriotic American\r\n  should approach this question with a desire to see this great and\r\n  interesting experiment fail, or with an unwillingness to accept the\r\n  evidences of its success. It will be a great step in the direction of\r\n  commercial independence when we produce our own tin plate.\r\n\r\n  It seems to me that nothing, unless it be a lack of faith in the\r\n  maintenance of the present law, can thwart this desirable achievement.\r\n  I can understand how our success should be doubted and our failure\r\n  accepted with satisfaction in Wales, but I cannot understand how any\r\n  American can take that view of the question or why he should always\r\n  approach every evidence of the successful establishment of this\r\n  industry in this country with a disposition to discredit it and reject\r\n  it. If the great experiment is to fail, our own people should not add\r\n  to the mortification of failure the crime of rejoicing in it.\r\n\r\n                                      Very truly yours,\r\n                                                  BENJAMIN HARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 14 AND DECEMBER 9, 1891.\r\n\r\n_The Chilian Imbroglio._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1891, civil war broke out in the republic of Chili between\r\nthe Congressional forces and the established Government under President\r\nBalmaceda. Deeds of cruelty signalized the conflict, which continued\r\nuntil August 28, when the insurgent forces landed near Valparaiso and,\r\nafter a bloody engagement, captured that city. President Balmaceda\r\nbecame a fugitive, and a few weeks later committed suicide, by shooting,\r\nat the residence of Señor Uribirru, the Argentine Minister.\r\n\r\nDuring the conduct of the war, the _Itata_, an armed vessel, commanded\r\nby an officer of the Chilian insurgent fleet, was seized under process\r\nof the United States Court at San Diego, Cal., for a violation of the\r\nneutrality laws. This seizure and the subsequent escape, surrender,\r\nand return of the _Itata_, and the strict neutrality observed by the\r\nAmerican Minister, Hon. Patrick Egan, and Admiral Brown, commanding\r\nthe squadron, caused the victorious Chilians to manifest a spirit of\r\nanimosity toward the Government and people of the United States. This\r\nfeeling was intensified by the false statements published in the British\r\npress, notably the London _Times_, touching the conduct of Admiral Brown\r\nand the American Minister, and by the fact that the American Legation,\r\nexercising the established right of asylum, opened its doors to several\r\nprominent political refugees of the defunct Balmaceda Government.\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 1891, this hostility culminated in an attack, in the\r\nstreets of Valparaiso, upon a number of sailors attached to the U. S.\r\ncruiser _Baltimore_, who were upon shore leave. These sailors, wearing\r\ntheir uniforms, were assaulted by armed men in different localities\r\nin the city; one petty officer was killed outright, and eight seamen\r\nseriously wounded, one of whom died a few days later. Many of their stab\r\nwounds were in the back. The news of this bloody and unprovoked attack\r\nsent a thrill of indignation across the American continent, and it was\r\nfelt that the deadly insult must be atoned in blood. The war feeling was\r\nnot lessened by the impudent tone of the reply from the Chilian Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs. American indignation subsided somewhat pending a\r\njudicial inquiry into the attack, but the determination to expiate the\r\ninsult had in no degree abated when, on November 14, Señor Don Pedro\r\nMontt was presented to President Harrison as the newly accredited\r\nChilian Minister to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe reception of a new Minister is ordinarily a very formal and\r\nuninteresting affair, but the circumstances narrated--with the two\r\ngovernments apparently on the verge of war--lent an unusual interest to\r\nthis official meeting; and the President's remarks, characterized by his\r\nusual frankness and firmness, called forth the approval of the whole\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nThe Minister was accompanied by Señors Anibal Cruz, Secretary of\r\nLegation; Guillermo Arenanetegan and Valentin del Campo, attachés. After\r\nthe formal introductions by Secretary Blaine, Señor Montt addressed the\r\nPresident in Spanish as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President_--I have the honor to present the credentials which\r\n  accredit me in the capacity of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\n  Plenipotentiary of the republic of Chili in the United States of North\r\n  America. The object of the mission which the Government of Chili has\r\n  confided to me is to cultivate and maintain the relations of peace\r\n  and friendship between the United States and Chili, which have ever\r\n  been close and cordial. For the accomplishment of this purpose I rely\r\n  upon the kindness and good-will which the United States Government\r\n  has always manifested for the representatives of Chili. Permit me to\r\n  express my country's sincere wishes for the prosperity and welfare of\r\n  this noble country, which is so highly favored by Providence, and for\r\n  your own happiness.\r\n\r\nThe President, in response, said:\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Minister_--I am glad to receive from your hands the\r\n  letters accrediting you as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\n  Plenipotentiary of the republic of Chili to the United States. The\r\n  presence of a representative of the Government of Chili at this\r\n  capital will, I hope, tend to promote a good understanding between\r\n  the two governments and the early settlement, upon terms just and\r\n  honorable to both, of the diplomatic questions now somewhat urgently\r\n  awaiting adjustment. The Government of the United States, as well as\r\n  its people, particularly desire and rejoice in the prosperity of all\r\n  our neighbors in this hemisphere. Our diplomatic relations with them\r\n  have always been and will continue to be free from intermeddling with\r\n  their internal affairs. Our people are too just to desire that the\r\n  commercial or political advantage of this Government should be sought\r\n  by the promotion of disastrous dissensions in other countries. We\r\n  hear with sorrow every fresh tale of war or internal strife, and are\r\n  always ready to give our friendly offices to the promotion of peace.\r\n  If these are not acceptable or do not avail, it is our policy to\r\n  preserve an honorable and strict neutrality, as was done during the\r\n  recent war in Chili. Tempting commercial and political advantages may\r\n  be offered for our aid or influence by one or the other of the two\r\n  contending parties, but this we have not deemed to be consistent with\r\n  the obligations of international honor and good-will. This Government\r\n  was quite as determined in its refusal to allow a war-vessel of the\r\n  United States to carry to a neutral port, where it could be made\r\n  available for war purposes, the silver of Balmaceda, as it was to give\r\n  aid to the forces opposing him. The questions involved were Chilian\r\n  questions, and this Government endeavored to observe those principles\r\n  of non-intervention upon which it had so strongly insisted when civil\r\n  war disturbed our own people. I cannot doubt that this policy will\r\n  commend itself to those who now administer the Government of Chili;\r\n  nor can I doubt that when excitement has given place to calmness, when\r\n  the truth is ascertained and the selfish and designing perversions of\r\n  recent incidents have been exposed, our respective governments will\r\n  find a basis of increased mutual respect, confidence, and friendship.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Minister, this Government and our people rejoice that peace has\r\n  been restored in Chili, and that its Government is the expression of\r\n  the free choice of its people. You may assure your honored President,\r\n  who has been chosen under circumstances which so strongly testify to\r\n  his moderation and to the esteem in which he is held by the people of\r\n  all parties, that the Government of the United States entertains only\r\n  good-will for him and for the people of Chili, and cannot doubt that\r\n  the existing and all future differences between the two governments\r\n  will find an honorable adjustment. To you, Mr. Minister, I tender a\r\n  personal welcome.\r\n\r\nIn his annual message to Congress, December 9, President Harrison\r\nconcludes his remarks upon Chilian affairs relating to the attack upon\r\nthe sailors of the cruiser _Baltimore_ with the following significant\r\nparagraphs:\r\n\r\n  So far as I have yet been able to learn, no other explanation of\r\n  this bloody work has been suggested than that it had its origin in\r\n  hostility to these men as sailors of the United States, wearing the\r\n  uniform of their Government, and not in any individual act or personal\r\n  animosity. The attention of the Chilian Government was at once\r\n  called to this affair, and a statement of the facts obtained by the\r\n  investigation we had conducted was submitted, accompanied by a request\r\n  to be advised of any other or qualifying facts in the possession of\r\n  the Chilian Government that might tend to relieve this affair of the\r\n  appearance of an insult to this Government. The Chilian Government\r\n  was also advised that if such qualifying facts did not exist, this\r\n  Government would confidently expect full and prompt reparation.\r\n\r\n  It is to be regretted that the reply of the Secretary for Foreign\r\n  Affairs of the Provisional Government was couched in an offensive\r\n  tone. To this no response has been made. This Government is now\r\n  awaiting the result of an investigation which has been conducted\r\n  by the criminal court at Valparaiso. It is reported unofficially\r\n  that the investigation is about completed, and it is expected that\r\n  the result will soon be communicated to this Government, together\r\n  with some adequate and satisfactory response to the note by which\r\n  the attention of Chili was called to this incident. If these just\r\n  expectations should be disappointed or further needless delay\r\n  intervene, I will, by a special message, bring this matter again to\r\n  the attention of Congress for such action as may be necessary. The\r\n  entire correspondence with the Government of Chili will at an early\r\n  day be submitted to Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FOR RAILROAD EMPLOYEES.\r\n\r\n[_Extract from President's Message, December 9, 1891._]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August 5, 1888, at Indianapolis, General Harrison,\r\nresponding to an address from D. T. Downs, President of the Terre\r\nHaute Railroad Club, and in the presence of several thousand railroad\r\nemployees, speaking of the heroic services rendered by the men who\r\noperate the great railroad lines of the country, said:\r\n\r\n  I do not doubt that certain and necessary provisions for the safety\r\n  of the men who operate these roads will yet be made compulsory by\r\n  public and general law. The dangers connected with your calling are\r\n  very great, and the public interest, as well as your own, requires\r\n  that they should be reduced to the minimum. I do not doubt that we\r\n  shall yet require that uniformity in the construction of railroad cars\r\n  that will diminish the danger of those, who must pass between them in\r\n  order to make up trains.\r\n\r\nConsistent with these views, President Harrison, in his message to\r\nCongress, December 9, 1891, made the following pertinent suggestions:\r\n\r\n  I have twice before urgently called the attention of Congress to the\r\n  necessity of legislation for the protection of the lives of railroad\r\n  employees, but nothing has yet been done. During the year ending June\r\n  30, 1890, 369 brakemen were killed and 7,841 maimed while engaged in\r\n  coupling cars. The total number of railroad employees killed during\r\n  the year was 2,451 and the number injured 22,390. This is a cruel and\r\n  largely a needless sacrifice, The Government is spending nearly one\r\n  million dollars annually to save the lives of shipwrecked seamen;\r\n  every steam-vessel is rigidly inspected and required to adopt the most\r\n  approved safety appliances. All this is good; but how shall we excuse\r\n  the lack of interest and effort in behalf of this army of brave young\r\n  men who in our land commerce are being sacrificed every year by the\r\n  continued use of antiquated and dangerous appliances? A law requiring\r\n  of every railroad engaged in inter-State commerce the equipment each\r\n  year of a given per cent. of its freight cars with automatic couplers\r\n  and air brakes would compel an agreement between the roads as to the\r\n  kind of brakes and couplers to be used, and would very soon and very\r\n  greatly reduce the present fearful death-rate among railroad employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPOINTMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS.\r\n\r\n[_From Annual Message to Congress, December 9, 1891._]\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no official utterance of President Harrison received more\r\nserious and profound consideration--as indicated through the press\r\nof the day--than the following patriotic admonishment regarding the\r\ndanger lurking within certain possible methods of choosing presidential\r\nelectors. He said:\r\n\r\n  The method of appointment by the States of electors of President and\r\n  Vice-President has recently attracted renewed interest by reason of a\r\n  departure by the State of Michigan from the method which had become\r\n  uniform in all the States. Prior to 1832 various methods had been\r\n  used by the different States, and even by the same State. In some the\r\n  choice was made by the Legislature; in others electors were chosen by\r\n  districts, but more generally by the voters of the whole State upon\r\n  a general ticket. The movement toward the adoption of the last-named\r\n  method had an early beginning and went steadily forward among the\r\n  States, until in 1832 there remained but a single State--South\r\n  Carolina--that had not adopted it. That State, until the Civil War,\r\n  continued to choose its electors by a vote of the Legislature, but\r\n  after the war changed its method and conformed to the practice of the\r\n  other States. For nearly sixty years all the States save one have\r\n  appointed their electors by a popular vote upon a general ticket, and\r\n  for nearly thirty years this method was universal.\r\n\r\n  After a full test of other methods, without important division or\r\n  dissent in any State and without any purpose of party advantage, as\r\n  we must believe, but solely upon the considerations that uniformity\r\n  was desirable and that general election in territorial divisions not\r\n  subject to change was most consistent with the popular character of\r\n  our institutions, best preserved the equality of the voters, and\r\n  perfectly removed the choice of President from the baneful influence\r\n  of the \"gerrymander,\" the practice of all the States was brought into\r\n  harmony. That this concurrence should now be broken is, I think, an\r\n  unfortunate and even a threatening episode, and one that may well\r\n  suggest whether the States that still give their approval to the\r\n  old and prevailing method ought not to secure, by a constitutional\r\n  amendment, a practice which has had the approval of all. The recent\r\n  Michigan legislation provides for choosing what are popularly\r\n  known as the Congressional electors for President by Congressional\r\n  districts, and the two Senatorial electors by districts created for\r\n  that purpose. This legislation was, of course, accompanied by a new\r\n  Congressional apportionment, and the two statutes bring the electoral\r\n  vote of the State under the influence of the \"gerrymander.\"\r\n\r\n  These gerrymanders for Congressional purposes are in most cases\r\n  buttressed by a gerrymander of the legislative districts, thus making\r\n  it impossible for a majority of the legal voters of the State to\r\n  correct the apportionment and equalize the Congressional districts.\r\n  A minority rule is established that only a political convulsion\r\n  can overthrow. I have recently been advised that in one county of\r\n  a certain State three districts for the election of members of the\r\n  Legislature are constituted as follows: One has 65,000 population,\r\n  one 15,000, and one 10,000; while in another county, detached,\r\n  non-contiguous sections have been united to make a legislative\r\n  district. These methods have already found effective application to\r\n  the choice of Senators and Representatives in Congress, and now an\r\n  evil start has been made in the direction of applying them to the\r\n  choice by the States of electors of President and Vice-President. If\r\n  this is accomplished, we shall then have the three great departments\r\n  of the Government in the grasp of the \"gerrymander,\" the legislative\r\n  and executive directly and the judiciary indirectly, through the power\r\n  of appointment.\r\n\r\n  An election implies a body of electors having prescribed\r\n  qualifications, each one of whom has an equal value and influence in\r\n  determining the result. So when the Constitution provides that \"each\r\n  State shall appoint [elect], in such manner as the legislature thereof\r\n  may direct, a number of electors,\" etc., an unrestricted power was not\r\n  given to the legislatures in the selection of the methods to be used.\r\n  \"A republican form of government\" is guaranteed by the Constitution\r\n  to each State, and the power given by the same instrument to the\r\n  legislatures of the States to prescribe methods for the choice, by\r\n  the State, of electors must be exercised under that limitation. The\r\n  essential features of such a government are the right of the people\r\n  to choose their own officers and the nearest practicable equality of\r\n  value in the suffrages given in determining that choice.\r\n\r\n  It will not be claimed that the power given to the Legislature\r\n  would support a law providing that the persons receiving the smallest\r\n  vote should be the electors, or a law that all the electors should\r\n  be chosen by the voters of a single Congressional district. The\r\n  State is to choose, and under the pretence of regulating methods\r\n  the legislature can neither vest the right of choice elsewhere nor\r\n  adopt methods not conformable to republican institutions. It is not\r\n  my purpose here to discuss the question whether a choice by the\r\n  Legislature or by the voters of equal single districts is a choice by\r\n  the State, but only to recommend such regulation of this matter by\r\n  constitutional amendment as will secure uniformity and prevent that\r\n  disgraceful partisan jugglery to which such a liberty of choice, if it\r\n  exist, offers a temptation.\r\n\r\n  Nothing just now is more important than to provide every guaranty\r\n  for the absolutely fair and free choice by an equal suffrage, within\r\n  the respective States, of all the officers of the national Government,\r\n  whether that suffrage is applied directly, as in the choice of members\r\n  of the House of Representatives, or indirectly, as in the choice of\r\n  Senators and electors of President. Respect for public officers and\r\n  obedience to law will not cease to be the characteristics of our\r\n  people until our elections cease to declare the will of majorities\r\n  fairly ascertained, without fraud, suppression, or gerrymander. If I\r\n  were called upon to declare wherein our chief national danger lies, I\r\n  should say, without hesitation, in the overthrow of majority control\r\n  by the suppression or perversion of the popular suffrage. That there\r\n  is a real danger here all must agree, but the energies of those who\r\n  see it have been chiefly expended in trying to fix responsibility upon\r\n  the opposite party, rather than in efforts to make such practices\r\n  impossible by either party.\r\n\r\n  Is it not possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive\r\n  debate while we take, by consent, one step in the direction of reform\r\n  by eliminating the gerrymander, which has been denounced by all\r\n  parties, as an influence in the selection of electors of President\r\n  and members of Congress? All the States have, acting freely and\r\n  separately, determined that the choice of electors by a general ticket\r\n  is the wisest and safest method, and it would seem there could be no\r\n  objection to a constitutional amendment making that method permanent.\r\n  If a legislature chosen in one year upon purely local questions\r\n  should, pending a presidential contest, meet, rescind the law for a\r\n  choice upon a general ticket, and provide for the choice of electors\r\n  by the legislature, and this trick should determine the result, it\r\n  is not too much to say that the public peace might be seriously and\r\n  widely endangered.\r\n\r\n  I have alluded to the \"gerrymander\" as affecting the method of\r\n  selecting electors of President by Congressional districts, but the\r\n  primary intent and effect of this form of political robbery have\r\n  relation to the selection of members of the House of Representatives.\r\n  The power of Congress is ample to deal with this threatening and\r\n  intolerable abuse. The unfailing test of sincerity in election reform\r\n  will be found in a willingness to confer as to remedies and to put\r\n  into force such measures as will most effectually preserve the right\r\n  of the people to free and equal representation.\r\n\r\n  An attempt was made in the last Congress to bring to bear the\r\n  constitutional powers of the general Government for the correction\r\n  of frauds against the suffrage. It is important to know whether the\r\n  opposition to such measures is really vested in particular features\r\n  supposed to be objectionable or includes any proposition to give to\r\n  the election laws of the United States adequacy to the correction\r\n  of grave and acknowledged evils. I must yet entertain the hope that\r\n  it is possible to secure a calm, patriotic consideration of such\r\n  constitutional or statutory changes as may be necessary to secure\r\n  the choice of the officers of the Government to the people by fair\r\n  apportionments and free elections. I believe it would be possible to\r\n  constitute a commission, non-partisan in its membership and composed\r\n  of patriotic, wise, and impartial men, to whom a consideration of the\r\n  question of the evils connected with our election system and methods\r\n  might be committed with a good prospect of securing unanimity in some\r\n  plan for removing or mitigating those evils. The Constitution would\r\n  permit the selection of the commission to be vested in the Supreme\r\n  Court, if that method would give the best guaranty of impartiality.\r\n\r\n  This commission should be charged with the duty of inquiring into\r\n  the whole subject of the law of elections as related to the choice of\r\n  officers of the national Government, with a view to securing to every\r\n  elector a free and unmolested exercise of the suffrage and as near an\r\n  approach to an equality of value in each ballot cast as is attainable.\r\n\r\n  While the policies of the general Government upon the tariff,\r\n  upon the restoration of our merchant marine, upon river and harbor\r\n  improvements, and other such matters of grave and general concern are\r\n  liable to be turned this way or that by the results of Congressional\r\n  elections and administrative policies, sometimes involving issues that\r\n  tend to peace or war, to be turned this way or that by the results\r\n  of a presidential election, there is a rightful interest in all the\r\n  States and in every Congressional district that will not be deceived\r\n  or silenced by the audacious pretence that the question of the right\r\n  of any body of legal voters in any State or in any Congressional\r\n  district to give their suffrages freely upon these general questions\r\n  is a matter only of local concern or control. The demand that the\r\n  limitations of suffrage shall be found in the law, and only there, is\r\n  a just demand, and no just man should resent or resist it. My appeal\r\n  is, and must continue to be, for a consultation that shall \"proceed\r\n  with candor, calmness, and patience upon the lines of justice and\r\n  humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty.\"\r\n\r\n  To the consideration of these very grave questions I invite not only\r\n  the attention of Congress, but that of all patriotic citizens. We must\r\n  not entertain the delusion that our people have ceased to regard a\r\n  free ballot and equal representation as the price of their allegiance\r\n  to laws and to civil magistrates.\r\n\r\n  I have been greatly rejoiced to notice many evidences of the\r\n  increased unification of our people and of a revived national spirit.\r\n  The vista that now opens to us is wider and more glorious than\r\n  ever before. Gratification and amazement struggle for supremacy as\r\n  we contemplate the population, wealth, and moral strength of our\r\n  country. A trust, momentous in its influence upon our people and upon\r\n  the world, is for a brief time committed to us, and we must not be\r\n  faithless to its first condition--the defence of the free and equal\r\n  influence of the people in the choice of public officers and in the\r\n  control of public affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILIAN MESSAGE, JANUARY 25, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as this book is going to the printer there has appeared a most\r\nsatisfactory closing chapter--the masterly message on the Chilian\r\ndifficulty. This message quickly won the approval of the civilized\r\nworld, and has stirred, as it has not been stirred in years, the\r\npatriotic pride of our own people. It will rank side by side with\r\nMonroe's famous declaration of American policy. It at once impresses\r\none with its character as the official statement of their position by\r\na powerful yet generous people, who, conscious of their own strength,\r\nwill firmly assert their rights and maintain their dignity, without any\r\ndisposition to despoil or humiliate their weaker neighbors. The position\r\ntaken by the President was so firm and the justice of our claims was so\r\nclearly set forth that three days after the date of the message he was\r\nenabled to announce to Congress that Chili had substantially complied\r\nwith our demands.\r\n\r\nSuch parts of the message as contained only a recital of facts, or were\r\nnot necessary to an understanding of the policy announced have, for the\r\nsake of brevity, been omitted.\r\n\r\n  _To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n  We have now received from the Chilian Government an abstract of the\r\n  conclusions of the _Fiscal General_ upon the testimony taken by the\r\n  Judge of Crimes in an investigation which was made to extend over\r\n  nearly three months. I very much regret to be compelled to say that\r\n  this report does not enable me to modify the conclusion announced in\r\n  my annual message. I am still of the opinion that our sailors were\r\n  assaulted, beaten, stabbed, and killed, not for anything they or any\r\n  one of them had done, but for what the Government of the United States\r\n  had done, or was charged with having done, by its civil officers and\r\n  naval commanders. If that be the true aspect of the case, the injury\r\n  was to the Government of the United States, not to these poor sailors\r\n  who were assaulted in a manner so brutal and so cowardly.\r\n\r\n       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n  It is not claimed that every personal collision or injury in\r\n  which a sailor or officer of such naval vessel visiting the shore\r\n  may be involved raises an international question; but I am clearly\r\n  of the opinion that where such sailors or officers are assaulted\r\n  by a resident populace, animated by hostility to the Government\r\n  whose uniform these sailors and officers wear, and in resentment of\r\n  acts done by their Government, not by them, their nation must take\r\n  notice of the event as one involving an infraction of its rights and\r\n  dignity--not in a secondary way, as where a citizen is injured and\r\n  presents his claim through his own Government, but in a primary way,\r\n  precisely as if its minister or consul or the flag itself had been the\r\n  object of the same character of assault. The officers and sailors of\r\n  the _Baltimore_ were in the harbor of Valparaiso under the orders of\r\n  their Government, not by their own choice. They were upon the shore\r\n  by the implied invitation of the Government of Chili and with the\r\n  approval of their commanding officer; and it does not distinguish\r\n  their case from that of a consul that his stay is more permanent\r\n  or that he holds the express invitation of the local government to\r\n  justify his longer residence. Nor does it affect the question that\r\n  the injury was the act of a mob. If there had been no participation\r\n  by the police or military in this cruel work and no neglect on their\r\n  part to extend protection, the case would still be one, in my opinion,\r\n  when its extent and character are considered, involving international\r\n  rights.\r\n\r\nHere follow the details of the attack upon the sailors of the\r\n_Baltimore_ in the streets of Valparaiso, October 16th.\r\n\r\n  The scene ... is very graphically set before us by the Chilian\r\n  testimony. The American sailors, who, after so long an examination,\r\n  have not been found guilty of any breach of the peace so far as the\r\n  Chilian authorities are able to discover, unarmed and defenceless,\r\n  are fleeing for their lives, pursued by overwhelming numbers, and\r\n  fighting only to aid their own escape from death or to succor some\r\n  mate whose life is in greater peril. Eighteen of them are brutally\r\n  stabbed and beaten, while one Chilian seems, from the report, to\r\n  have suffered some injury; but how serious or with what character or\r\n  weapon, or whether by a missile thrown by our men or by some of his\r\n  fellow-rioters, is unascertained.\r\n\r\n  The pretence that our men were fighting \"with stones, clubs, and\r\n  bright arms\" is, in view of these facts, incredible. It is further\r\n  refuted by the fact that our prisoners, when searched, were absolutely\r\n  without arms, only seven penknives being found in the possession of\r\n  the men arrested, while there were received by our men more than\r\n  thirty stab wounds, every one of which was inflicted in the back, and\r\n  almost every contused wound was in the back or back of the head. The\r\n  evidence of the ship's officer of the day is that even the jack-knives\r\n  of the men were taken from them before leaving the ship....\r\n\r\n  No amount of evasion or subterfuge is able to cloud our clear vision\r\n  of this brutal work....\r\n\r\n  It is quite remarkable and quite characteristic of the management of\r\n  this affair by the Chilian police authorities that we should now be\r\n  advised that Seaman Davidson, of the _Baltimore_, has been included\r\n  in the indictment, his offence being, so far as I have been able to\r\n  ascertain, that he attempted to defend a shipmate against an assailant\r\n  who was striking at him with a knife. The perfect vindication of our\r\n  men is furnished by this report; one only is found to have been guilty\r\n  of criminal fault, and that for an act clearly justifiable....\r\n\r\n  The evidence of our sailors clearly shows that the attack was\r\n  expected by the Chilian people, that threats had been made against\r\n  our men, and that, in one case somewhat early in the afternoon, the\r\n  keeper of one house into which some of our men had gone closed his\r\n  establishment in anticipation of the attack, which he advised them\r\n  would be made upon them as darkness came on....\r\n\r\n  Several of our men sought security from the mob by such complete\r\n  or partial changes in their dress as would conceal the fact of their\r\n  being seamen of the _Baltimore_, and found it then possible to\r\n  walk the streets without molestation. These incidents conclusively\r\n  establish that the attack was upon the uniform--the nationality--and\r\n  not upon the men.\r\n\r\n       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n  The testimony of Captain Jenkins, of the American merchant ship\r\n  _Keweenaw_, which had gone to Valparaiso for repairs, and who was a\r\n  witness of some part of the assault upon the crew of the _Baltimore_,\r\n  is strongly corroborative of the testimony of our own sailors when\r\n  he says that he saw Chilian sentries drive back a seaman, seeking\r\n  shelter, upon a mob that was pursuing him. The officers and men of\r\n  Captain Jenkins' ship furnish the most conclusive testimony as to\r\n  the indignities which were practised toward Americans in Valparaiso.\r\n  When American sailors, even of merchant ships, can only secure their\r\n  safety by denying their nationality, it must be time to readjust our\r\n  relations with a government that permits such demonstrations.\r\n\r\n  As to the participation of the police, the evidence of our sailors\r\n  shows that our men were struck and beaten by police officers before\r\n  and after arrest, and that one at least was dragged with a lasso\r\n  about his neck by a mounted policeman. That the death of Riggin was\r\n  the result of a rifle-shot fired by a policeman or soldier on duty is\r\n  shown directly by the testimony of Johnson, in whose arms he was at\r\n  the time, and by the evidence of Charles Langen, an American sailor\r\n  not then a member of the _Baltimore's_ crew, who stood close by and\r\n  saw the transaction. The Chilian authorities do not pretend to fix the\r\n  responsibility of this shot upon any particular person, but avow their\r\n  inability to ascertain who fired it, further than that it was fired\r\n  from a crowd....\r\n\r\n  The communications of the Chilian Government in relation to this\r\n  cruel and disastrous attack upon our men, as will appear from the\r\n  correspondence, have not in any degree taken the form of a manly and\r\n  satisfactory expression of regret, much less of apology. The event\r\n  was of so serious a character that, if the injuries suffered by our\r\n  men had been wholly the result of an accident in a Chilian port, the\r\n  incident was grave enough to have called for some public expression\r\n  of sympathy and regret from the local authorities. It is not enough\r\n  to say that the affair was lamentable, for humanity would require\r\n  that expression, even if the beating and killing of our men had been\r\n  justifiable. It is not enough to say that the incident is regretted,\r\n  coupled with the statement that the affair was not of an unusual\r\n  character in ports where foreign sailors are accustomed to meet. It is\r\n  not for a generous and sincere government to seek for words of small\r\n  or equivocal meaning in which to convey to a friendly power an apology\r\n  for an offence so atrocious as this. In the case of the assault by a\r\n  mob in New Orleans upon the Spanish consulate in 1851, Mr. Webster\r\n  wrote to the Spanish minister, Mr. Calderon, that the acts complained\r\n  of were \"a disgraceful and flagrant breach of duty and propriety,\"\r\n  and that his Government \"regrets them as deeply as Minister Calderon\r\n  or his Government could possibly do;\" that \"these acts have caused\r\n  the President great pain, and he thinks a proper acknowledgment is\r\n  due to Her Majesty's Government.\" He invited the Spanish consul to\r\n  return to his post, guaranteeing protection, and offered to salute the\r\n  Spanish flag if the consul should come in a Spanish vessel. Such a\r\n  treatment by the Government of Chili of this assault would have been\r\n  more creditable to the Chilian authorities; and much less can hardly\r\n  be satisfactory to a government that values its dignity and honor.\r\n\r\n       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n  On the 21st instant I caused to be communicated to the Government of\r\n  Chili, by the American minister at Santiago, the conclusions of this\r\n  Government after a full consideration of all the evidence and of every\r\n  suggestion affecting this matter, and to these conclusions I adhere.\r\n  They were stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"First. That the assault is not relieved of the aspect which the\r\n  early information of the event gave to it, viz.: That of an attack\r\n  upon the uniform of the United States Navy, having its origin and\r\n  motive in a feeling of hostility to this Government, and not in any\r\n  act of the sailors or of any of them.\r\n\r\n  \"Second. That the public authorities of Valparaiso flagrantly\r\n  failed in their duty to protect our men, and that some of the police\r\n  and of the Chilian soldiers and sailors were themselves guilty of\r\n  unprovoked assaults upon our sailors before and after arrest. He [the\r\n  President] thinks the preponderance of the evidence and the inherent\r\n  probabilities lead to the conclusion that Riggin was killed by the\r\n  police or soldiers.\r\n\r\n  \"Third. That he [the President] is therefore compelled to bring the\r\n  case back to the position taken by this Government in the note of Mr.\r\n  Wharton of October 23 last, ... and to ask for a suitable apology and\r\n  for some adequate reparation for the injury done to this Government.\"\r\n\r\n  In the same note the attention of the Chilian Government was\r\n  called to the offensive character of a note addressed by Mr. Matta,\r\n  its Minister of Foreign Affairs, to Mr. Montt, its minister at\r\n  this capital, on the 11th ultimo. This despatch was not officially\r\n  communicated to this Government; but, as Mr. Montt was directed to\r\n  translate it and to give it to the press of this country, it seemed\r\n  to me that it could not pass without official notice. It was not\r\n  only undiplomatic, but grossly insulting to our naval officers and\r\n  to the Executive Department, as it directly imputed untruth and\r\n  insincerity to the reports of the naval officers and to the official\r\n  communications made by the Executive Department to Congress. It will\r\n  be observed that I have notified the Chilian Government that, unless\r\n  this note is at once withdrawn and an apology as public as the offence\r\n  made, I will terminate diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\n  The request for the recall of Mr. Egan upon the ground that he was\r\n  not _persona grata_ was unaccompanied by any suggestion that could\r\n  properly be used in support of it, and I infer that the request is\r\n  based upon official acts of Mr. Egan which have received the approval\r\n  of this Government. But however that may be, I could not consent to\r\n  consider such a question until it had first been settled whether our\r\n  correspondence with Chili could be conducted upon a basis of mutual\r\n  respect.\r\n\r\n  In submitting these papers to Congress for that grave and patriotic\r\n  consideration which the questions involved demand, I desire to say\r\n  that I am of the opinion that the demands made of Chili by this\r\n  Government should be adhered to and enforced. If the dignity as\r\n  well as the prestige and influence of the United States are not to\r\n  be wholly sacrificed, we must protect those who, in foreign ports,\r\n  display the flag or wear the colors of this Government against insult,\r\n  brutality, and death inflicted in resentment of the acts of their\r\n  Government, and not for any fault of their own. It has been my desire\r\n  in every way to cultivate friendly and intimate relations with all\r\n  the governments of this hemisphere. We do not covet their territory;\r\n  we desire their peace and prosperity. We look for no advantage in our\r\n  relations with them, except the increased exchanges of commerce upon a\r\n  basis of mutual benefit. We regret every civil contest that disturbs\r\n  their peace and paralyzes their development, and are always ready to\r\n  give our good offices for the restoration of peace. It must, however,\r\n  be understood that this Government, while exercising the utmost\r\n  forbearance toward weaker powers, will extend its strong and adequate\r\n  protection to its citizens, to its officers, and to its humblest\r\n  sailors when made the victims of wantonness and cruelty in resentment,\r\n  not of their personal misconduct, but of the official acts of their\r\n  Government.\r\n\r\n  Upon information received that Patrick Shields, an Irishman and\r\n  probably a British subject, but at the time a fireman of the American\r\n  steamer _Keweenaw_, in the harbor of Valparaiso for repairs, had been\r\n  subjected to personal injuries in that city--largely by the police--I\r\n  directed the Attorney-General to cause the evidence of the officers\r\n  and crew of that vessel to be taken upon its arrival in San Francisco;\r\n  and that testimony is also herewith transmitted. The brutality and\r\n  even savagery of the treatment of this poor man by the Chilian police\r\n  would be incredible if the evidence of Shields was not supported by\r\n  other direct testimony and by the distressing condition of the man\r\n  himself when he was finally able to reach his vessel....\r\n\r\n  A claim for reparation has been made in behalf of this man, for\r\n  while he was not a citizen of the United States, the doctrine long\r\n  held by us, as expressed in the Consular Regulations, is \"the\r\n  principles which are maintained by this Government in regard to the\r\n  protection, as distinguished from the relief, of seamen are well\r\n  settled. It is held that the circumstance that the vessel is American\r\n  is evidence that the seamen on board are such; and in every regularly\r\n  documented merchant vessel the crew will find their protection in the\r\n  flag that covers them.\"\r\n\r\n  I have as yet received no reply to our note of the 21st instant, but\r\n  in my opinion I ought not to delay longer to bring these matters to\r\n  the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nBENJ.
