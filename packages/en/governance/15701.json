A few\r\ndays after the prorogation some few observations were added. I was,\r\nhowever, resolved to let it lie by me for a considerable time, that, on\r\nviewing the matter at a proper distance, and when the sharpness of\r\nrecent impressions had been worn off, I might be better able to form a\r\njust estimate of the value of my first opinions.\r\n\r\nI have just now read it over very coolly and deliberately. My latest\r\njudgment owns my first sentiments and reasonings, in their full force,\r\nwith regard both to persons and things.\r\n\r\nDuring a period of four years, the state of the world, except for some\r\nfew and short intervals, has filled me with a good deal of serious\r\ninquietude. I considered a general war against Jacobins and Jacobinism\r\nas the only possible chance of saving Europe (and England as included in\r\nEurope) from a truly frightful revolution. For this I have been\r\ncensured, as receiving through weakness, or spreading through fraud and\r\nartifice, a false alarm. Whatever others may think of the matter, that\r\nalarm, in my mind, is by no means quieted. The state of affairs\r\n_abroad_ is not so much mended as to make me, for one, full of\r\nconfidence. At _home_, I see no abatement whatsoever in the zeal of the\r\npartisans of Jacobinism towards their cause, nor any cessation in their\r\nefforts to do mischief. What is doing by Lord Lauderdale on the first\r\nscene of Lord George Gordon's actions, and in his spirit, is not\r\ncalculated to remove my apprehensions. They pursue their first object\r\nwith as much eagerness as ever, but with more dexterity. Under the\r\nplausible name of peace, by which they delude or are deluded, they would\r\ndeliver us unarmed and defenceless to the confederation of Jacobins,\r\nwhose centre is indeed in France, but whose rays proceed in every\r\ndirection throughout the world. I understand that Mr. Coke, of Norfolk,\r\nhas been lately very busy in spreading a disaffection to this war (which\r\nwe carry on for our being) in the country in which his property gives\r\nhim so great an influence. It is truly alarming to see so large a part\r\nof the aristocratic interest engaged in the cause of the new species of\r\ndemocracy, which is openly attacking or secretly undermining the system\r\nof property by which mankind has hitherto been governed. But we are not\r\nto delude ourselves. No man can be connected with a party which\r\nprofesses publicly to admire or may be justly suspected of secretly\r\nabetting this French Revolution, who must not be drawn into its vortex,\r\nand become the instrument of its designs.\r\n\r\nWhat I have written is in the manner of apology. I have given it that\r\nform, as being the most respectful; but I do not stand in need of any\r\napology for my principles, my sentiments, or my conduct. I wish the\r\npaper I lay before your Grace to be considered as my most deliberate,\r\nsolemn, and even testamentary protest against the proceedings and\r\ndoctrines which have hitherto produced so much mischief in the world,\r\nand which will infallibly produce more, and possibly greater. It is my\r\nprotest against the delusion by which some have been taught to look upon\r\nthis Jacobin contest at home as an ordinary party squabble about place\r\nor patronage, and to regard this Jacobin war abroad as a common war\r\nabout trade or territorial boundaries, or about a political balance of\r\npower among rival or jealous states. Above all, it is my protest against\r\nthat mistake or perversion of sentiment by which they who agree with us\r\nin our principles may on collateral considerations be regarded as\r\nenemies, and those who, in this perilous crisis of all human affairs,\r\ndiffer from us fundamentally and practically, as our best friends. Thus\r\npersons of great importance may be made to turn the whole of their\r\ninfluence to the destruction of their principles.\r\n\r\nI now make it my humble request to your Grace, that you will not give\r\nany sort of answer to the paper I send, or to this letter, except barely\r\nto let me know that you have received them. I even wish that at present\r\nyou may not read the paper which I transmit: lock it up in the drawer of\r\nyour library-table; and when a day of compulsory reflection comes, then\r\nbe pleased to turn to it. Then remember that your Grace had a true\r\nfriend, who had, comparatively with men of your description, a very\r\nsmall interest in opposing the modern system of morality and policy, but\r\nwho, under every discouragement, was faithful to public duty and to\r\nprivate friendship. I shall then probably be dead. I am sure I do not\r\nwish to live to see such things. But whilst I do live, I shall pursue\r\nthe same course, although my merits should be taken for unpardonable\r\nfaults, and as such avenged, not only on myself, but on my posterity.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Lord; and do me the justice to believe me ever, with most\r\nsincere respect, veneration, and affectionate attachment,\r\n\r\nYour Grace's most faithful friend,\r\n\r\nAnd most obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE.\r\n\r\nBEACONSFIELD, Sept. 29, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching towards the close of a long period of public service, it is\r\nnatural I should be desirous to stand well (I hope I do stand tolerably\r\nwell) with that public which, with whatever fortune, I have endeavored\r\nfaithfully and zealously to serve.\r\n\r\nI am also not a little anxious for some place in the estimation of the\r\ntwo persons to whom I address this paper. I have always acted with them,\r\nand with those whom they represent. To my knowledge, I have not\r\ndeviated, no, not in the minutest point, from their opinions and\r\nprinciples. Of late, without any alteration in their sentiments or in\r\nmine, a difference of a very unusual nature, and which, under the\r\ncircumstances, it is not easy to describe, has arisen between us.\r\n\r\nIn my journey with them through life, I met Mr. Fox in my road; and I\r\ntravelled with him very cheerfully, as long as he appeared to me to\r\npursue the same direction with those in whose company I set out. In the\r\nlatter stage of our progress a new scheme of liberty and equality was\r\nproduced in the world, which either dazzled his imagination, or was\r\nsuited to some new walks of ambition which were then opened to his view.\r\nThe whole frame and fashion of his politics appear to have suffered\r\nabout that time a very material alteration. It is about three years\r\nsince, in consequence of that extraordinary change, that, after a\r\npretty long preceding period of distance, coolness, and want of\r\nconfidence, if not total alienation on his part, a complete public\r\nseparation has been made between that gentleman and me. Until lately the\r\nbreach between us appeared reparable. I trusted that time and\r\nreflection, and a decisive experience of the mischiefs which have flowed\r\nfrom the proceedings and the system of France, on which our difference\r\nhad arisen, as well as the known sentiments of the best and wisest of\r\nour common friends upon that subject, would have brought him to a safer\r\nway of thinking. Several of his friends saw no security for keeping\r\nthings in a proper train after this excursion of his, but in the reunion\r\nof the party on its old grounds, under the Duke of Portland. Mr. Fox, if\r\nhe pleased, might have been comprehended in that system, with the rank\r\nand consideration to which his great talents entitle him, and indeed\r\nmust secure to him in any party arrangement that _could_ be made. The\r\nDuke of Portland knows how much I wished for, and how earnestly I\r\nlabored that reunion, and upon terms that might every way be honorable\r\nand advantageous to Mr. Fox. His conduct in the last session has\r\nextinguished these hopes forever.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox has lately published in print a defence of his conduct. On\r\ntaking into consideration that defence, a society of gentlemen, called\r\nthe Whig Club, thought proper to come to the following\r\nresolution:--\"That their confidence in Mr. Fox is confirmed,\r\nstrengthened, and increased by the calumnies against him.\"\r\n\r\nTo that resolution my two noble friends, the Duke of Portland and Lord\r\nFitzwilliam, have given their concurrence.\r\n\r\nThe calumnies supposed in that resolution can be nothing else than the\r\nobjections taken to Mr. Fox's conduct in this session of Parliament; for\r\nto them, and to them alone, the resolution refers. I am one of those who\r\nhave publicly and strongly urged those objections. I hope I shall be\r\nthought only to do what is necessary to my justification, thus publicly,\r\nsolemnly, and heavily censured by those whom I most value and esteem,\r\nwhen I firmly contend that the objections which I, with many others of\r\nthe friends to the Duke of Portland, have made to Mr. Fox's conduct, are\r\nnot _calumnies_, but founded on truth,--that they are not _few_, but\r\nmany,--and that they are not _light and trivial_, but, in a very high\r\ndegree, serious and important.\r\n\r\nThat I may avoid the imputation of throwing out, even privately, any\r\nloose, random imputations against the public conduct of a gentleman for\r\nwhom I once entertained a very warm affection, and whose abilities I\r\nregard with the greatest admiration, I will put down, distinctly and\r\narticulately, some of the matters of objection which I feel to his late\r\ndoctrines and proceedings, trusting that I shall be able to demonstrate\r\nto the friends whose good opinion I would still cultivate, that not\r\nlevity, nor caprice, nor less defensible motives, but that very grave\r\nreasons, influence my judgment. I think that the spirit of his late\r\nproceedings is wholly alien to our national policy, and to the peace, to\r\nthe prosperity, and to the legal liberties of this nation, _according to\r\nour ancient domestic and appropriated mode of holding them_.\r\n\r\nViewing things in that light, my confidence in him is not increased, but\r\ntotally destroyed, by those proceedings. I cannot conceive it a matter\r\nof honor or duty (but the direct contrary) in any member of Parliament\r\nto continue systematic opposition for the purpose of putting government\r\nunder difficulties, until Mr. Fox (with all his present ideas) shall\r\nhave the principal direction of affairs placed in his hands, and until\r\nthe present body of administration (with their ideas and measures) is of\r\ncourse overturned and dissolved.\r\n\r\nTo come to particulars.\r\n\r\n1. The laws and Constitution of the kingdom intrust the sole and\r\nexclusive right of treating with foreign potentates to the king. This is\r\nan undisputed part of the legal prerogative of the crown. However,\r\nnotwithstanding this, Mr. Fox, without the knowledge or participation of\r\nany one person in the House of Commons, with whom he was bound by every\r\nparty principle, in matters of delicacy and importance, confidentially\r\nto communicate, thought proper to send Mr. Adair, as his representative,\r\nand with his cipher, to St. Petersburg, there to frustrate the objects\r\nfor which the minister from the crown was authorized to treat. He\r\nsucceeded in this his design, and did actually frustrate the king's\r\nminister in some of the objects of his negotiation.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding of Mr. Fox does not (as I conceive) amount to absolute\r\nhigh treason,--Russia, though on bad terms, not having been then\r\ndeclaredly at war with this kingdom. But such a proceeding is in law not\r\nvery remote from that offence, and is undoubtedly a most\r\nunconstitutional act, and an high treasonable misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThe legitimate and sure mode of communication between this nation and\r\nforeign powers is rendered uncertain, precarious, and treacherous, by\r\nbeing divided into two channels,--one with the government, one with the\r\nhead of a party in opposition to that government; by which means the\r\nforeign powers can never be assured of the real authority or validity of\r\nany public transaction whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the advantage taken of the discontent which at that\r\ntime prevailed in Parliament and in the nation, to give to an individual\r\nan influence directly against the government of his country, in a\r\nforeign court, has made a highway into England for the intrigues of\r\nforeign courts in our affairs. This is a sore evil,--an evil from which,\r\nbefore this time, England was more free than any other nation. Nothing\r\ncan preserve us from that evil--which connects cabinet factions abroad\r\nwith popular factions here--but the keeping sacred the crown as the only\r\nchannel of communication with every other nation.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding of Mr. Fox has given a strong countenance and an\r\nencouraging example to the doctrines and practices of the Revolution and\r\nConstitutional Societies, and of other mischievous societies of that\r\ndescription, who, without any legal authority, and even without any\r\ncorporate capacity, are in the habit of proposing, and, to the best of\r\ntheir power, of forming, leagues and alliances with France.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding, which ought to be reprobated on all the general\r\nprinciples of government, is in a more narrow view of things not less\r\nreprehensible. It tends to the prejudice of the whole of the Duke of\r\nPortland's late party, by discrediting the principles upon which they\r\nsupported Mr. Fox in the Russian business, as if they of that party also\r\nhad proceeded in their Parliamentary opposition on the same mischievous\r\nprinciples which actuated Mr. Fox in sending Mr. Adair on his embassy.\r\n\r\n2. Very soon after his sending this embassy to Russia, that is, in the\r\nspring of 1792, a covenanting club or association was formed in London,\r\ncalling itself by the ambitious and invidious title of \"_The Friends of\r\nthe People_.\" It was composed of many of Mr. Fox's own most intimate\r\npersonal and party friends, joined to a very considerable part of the\r\nmembers of those mischievous associations called the Revolution Society\r\nand the Constitutional Society. Mr. Fox must have been well apprised of\r\nthe progress of that society in every one of its steps, if not of the\r\nvery origin of it. I certainly was informed of both, who had no\r\nconnection with the design, directly or indirectly. His influence over\r\nthe persons who composed the leading part in that association was, and\r\nis, unbounded. I hear that he expressed some disapprobation of this club\r\nin one case, (that of Mr. St. John,) where his consent was formally\r\nasked; yet he never attempted seriously to put a stop to the\r\nassociation, or to disavow it, or to control, check, or modify it in any\r\nway whatsoever. If he had pleased, without difficulty, he might have\r\nsuppressed it in its beginning. However, he did not only not suppress it\r\nin its beginning, but encouraged it in every part of its progress, at\r\nthat particular time when Jacobin clubs (under the very same or similar\r\ntitles) were making such dreadful havoc in a country not thirty miles\r\nfrom the coast of England, and when every motive of moral prudence\r\ncalled for the discouragement of societies formed for the increase of\r\npopular pretensions to power and direction.\r\n\r\n3. When the proceedings of this society of the Friends of the People, as\r\nwell as others acting in the same spirit, had caused a very serious\r\nalarm in the mind of the Duke of Portland, and of many good patriots,\r\nhe publicly, in the House of Commons, treated their apprehensions and\r\nconduct with the greatest asperity and ridicule. He condemned and\r\nvilified, in the most insulting and outrageous terms, the proclamation\r\nissued by government on that occasion,--though he well knew that it had\r\npassed through the Duke of Portland's hands, that it had received his\r\nfullest approbation, and that it was the result of an actual interview\r\nbetween that noble Duke and Mr. Pitt. During the discussion of its\r\nmerits in the House of Commons, Mr. Fox countenanced and justified the\r\nchief promoters of that association; and he received, in return, a\r\npublic assurance from them of an inviolable adherence to him singly and\r\npersonally. On account of this proceeding, a very great number (I\r\npresume to say not the least grave and wise part) of the Duke of\r\nPortland's friends in Parliament, and many out of Parliament who are of\r\nthe same description, have become separated from that time to this from\r\nMr. Fox's particular cabal,--very few of which cabal are, or ever have,\r\nso much as pretended to be attached to the Duke of Portland, or to pay\r\nany respect to him or his opinions.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of this session, when the sober part of the nation\r\nwas a second time generally and justly alarmed at the progress of the\r\nFrench arms on the Continent, and at the spreading of their horrid\r\nprinciples and cabals in England, Mr. Fox did not (as had been usual in\r\ncases of far less moment) call together any meeting of the Duke of\r\nPortland's friends in the House of Commons, for the purpose of taking\r\ntheir opinion on the conduct to be pursued in Parliament at that\r\ncritical juncture. He concerted his measures (if with any persons at\r\nall) with the friends of Lord Lansdowne, and those calling themselves\r\nFriends of the People, and others not in the smallest degree attached to\r\nthe Duke of Portland; by which conduct he wilfully gave up (in my\r\nopinion) all pretensions to be considered as of that party, and much\r\nmore to be considered as the leader and mouth of it in the House of\r\nCommons. This could not give much encouragement to those who had been\r\nseparated from Mr. Fox, on account of his conduct on the first\r\nproclamation, to rejoin that party.\r\n\r\n5. Not having consulted any of the Duke of Portland's party in the House\r\nof Commons,--and not having consulted them, because he had reason to\r\nknow that the course he had resolved to pursue would be highly\r\ndisagreeable to them,--he represented the alarm, which was a second time\r\ngiven and taken, in still more invidious colors than those in which he\r\npainted the alarms of the former year. He described those alarms in this\r\nmanner, although the cause of them was then grown far less equivocal and\r\nfar more urgent. He even went so far as to treat the supposition of the\r\ngrowth of a Jacobin spirit in England as a libel on the nation. As to\r\nthe danger from _abroad_, on the first day of the session he said little\r\nor nothing upon the subject. He contented himself with defending the\r\nruling factions in France, and with accusing the public councils of this\r\nkingdom of every sort of evil design on the liberties of the\r\npeople,--declaring distinctly, strongly, and precisely, that the whole\r\ndanger of the nation was from the growth of the power of the crown. The\r\npolicy of this declaration was obvious. It was in subservience to the\r\ngeneral plan of disabling us from taking any steps against France. To\r\ncounteract the alarm given by the progress of Jacobin arms and\r\nprinciples, he endeavored to excite an opposite alarm concerning the\r\ngrowth of the power of the crown. If that alarm should prevail, he knew\r\nthat the nation never would be brought by arms to oppose the growth of\r\nthe Jacobin empire: because it is obvious that war does, in its very\r\nnature, necessitate the Commons considerably to strengthen the hands of\r\ngovernment; and if that strength should itself be the object of terror,\r\nwe could have no war.\r\n\r\n6. In the extraordinary and violent speeches of that day, he attributed\r\nall the evils which the public had suffered to the proclamation of the\r\npreceding summer; though he spoke in presence of the Duke of Portland's\r\nown son, the Marquis of Tichfield, who had seconded the address on that\r\nproclamation, and in presence of the Duke of Portland's brother, Lord\r\nEdward Bentinck, and several others of his best friends and nearest\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n7. On that day, that is, on the 13th of December, 1792, he proposed an\r\namendment to the address, which stands on the journals of the House, and\r\nwhich is, perhaps, the most extraordinary record which ever did stand\r\nupon them. To introduce this amendment, he not only struck out the part\r\nof the proposed address which alluded to insurrections, upon the ground\r\nof the objections which he took to the legality of calling together\r\nParliament, (objections which I must ever think litigious and\r\nsophistical,) but he likewise struck out _that part which related to the\r\ncabals and conspiracies of the French faction in England_, although\r\ntheir practices and correspondences were of public notoriety. Mr. Cooper\r\nand Mr. Watt had been deputed from Manchester to the Jacobins. These\r\nambassadors were received by them as British representatives. Other\r\ndeputations of English had been received at the bar of the National\r\nAssembly. They had gone the length of giving supplies to the Jacobin\r\narmies; and they, in return, had received promises of military\r\nassistance to forward their designs in England. A regular correspondence\r\nfor fraternizing the two nations had also been carried on by societies\r\nin London with a great number of the Jacobin societies in France. This\r\ncorrespondence had also for its object the pretended improvement of the\r\nBritish Constitution. What is the most remarkable, and by much the more\r\nmischievous part of his proceedings that day, Mr. Fox likewise struck\r\nout everything in the address which _related to the tokens of ambition\r\ngiven by France, her aggressions upon our allies, and the sudden and\r\ndangerous growth of her power upon every side_; and instead of all those\r\nweighty, and, at that time, necessary matters, by which the House of\r\nCommons was (in a crisis such as perhaps Europe never stood) to give\r\nassurances to our allies, strength to our government, and a check to the\r\ncommon enemy of Europe, he substituted nothing but a criminal charge on\r\nthe conduct of the British government for calling Parliament together,\r\nand an engagement to inquire into that conduct.\r\n\r\n8. If it had pleased God to suffer him to succeed in this his project\r\nfor the amendment to the address, he would forever have ruined this\r\nnation, along with the rest of Europe. At home all the Jacobin\r\nsocieties, formed for the utter destruction of our Constitution, would\r\nhave lifted up their heads, which had been beaten down by the two\r\nproclamations. Those societies would have been infinitely strengthened\r\nand multiplied in every quarter; their dangerous foreign communications\r\nwould have been left broad and open; the crown would not have been\r\nauthorized to take any measure whatever for our immediate defence by sea\r\nor land. The closest, the most natural, the nearest, and at the same\r\ntime, from many internal as well as external circumstances, the weakest\r\nof our allies, Holland, would have been given up, bound hand and foot,\r\nto France, just on the point of invading that republic. A general\r\nconsternation would have seized upon all Europe; and all alliance with\r\nevery other power, except France, would have been forever rendered\r\nimpracticable to us. I think it impossible for any man, who regards the\r\ndignity and safety of his country, or indeed the common safety of\r\nmankind, ever to forget Mr. Fox's proceedings in that tremendous crisis\r\nof all human affairs.\r\n\r\n9. Mr. Fox very soon had reason to be apprised of the general dislike of\r\nthe Duke of Portland's friends to this conduct. Some of those who had\r\neven voted with him, the day after their vote, expressed their\r\nabhorrence of his amendment, their sense of its inevitable tendency, and\r\ntheir total alienation from the principles and maxims upon which it was\r\nmade; yet the very next day, that is, on Friday, the 14th of December,\r\nhe brought on what in effect was the very same business, and on the same\r\nprinciples, a _second_ time.\r\n\r\n10. Although the House does not usually sit on Saturday, he a _third_\r\ntime brought on another proposition in the same spirit, and pursued it\r\nwith so much heat and perseverance as to sit into Sunday: a thing not\r\nknown in Parliament for many years.\r\n\r\n11. In all these motions and debates he wholly departed from all the\r\npolitical principles relative to France (considered merely as a state,\r\nand independent of its Jacobin form of government) which had hitherto\r\nbeen held fundamental in this country, and which he had himself held\r\nmore strongly than any man in Parliament. He at that time studiously\r\nseparated himself from those to whose sentiments he used to profess no\r\nsmall regard, although those sentiments were publicly declared. I had\r\nthen no concern in the party, having been, for some time, with all\r\noutrage, excluded from it; but, on general principles, I must say that a\r\nperson who assumes to be leader of a party composed of freemen and of\r\ngentlemen ought to pay some degree of deference to their feelings, and\r\neven to their prejudices. He ought to have some degree of management for\r\ntheir credit and influence in their country. He showed so very little of\r\nthis delicacy, that he compared the alarm raised in the minds of the\r\nDuke of Portland's party, (which was his own,) an alarm in which they\r\nsympathized with the greater part of the nation, to the panic produced\r\nby the pretended Popish plot in the reign of Charles the\r\nSecond,--describing it to be, as that was, a contrivance of knaves, and\r\nbelieved only by well-meaning dupes and madmen.\r\n\r\n12. The Monday following (the 17th of December) he pursued the same\r\nconduct. The means used in England to coöperate with the Jacobin army in\r\npolitics agreed with their modes of proceeding: I allude to the\r\nmischievous writings circulated with much industry and success, as well\r\nas the seditious clubs, which at that time added not a little to the\r\nalarm taken by observing and well-informed men. The writings and the\r\nclubs were two evils which marched together. Mr. Fox discovered the\r\ngreatest possible disposition to favor and countenance the one as well\r\nas the other of these two grand instruments of the French system. He\r\nwould hardly consider any political writing whatsoever as a libel, or as\r\na fit object of prosecution. At a time in which the press has been the\r\ngrand instrument of the subversion of order, of morals, of religion,\r\nand, I may say, of human society itself, to carry the doctrines of its\r\nliberty higher than ever it has been known by its most extravagant\r\nassertors, even in France, gave occasion to very serious reflections.\r\nMr. Fox treated the associations for prosecuting these libels as tending\r\nto prevent the improvement of the human mind, and as a mobbish tyranny.\r\nHe thought proper to compare them with the riotous assemblies of Lord\r\nGeorge Gordon in 1780, declaring that he had advised his friends in\r\nWestminster to sign the associations, whether they agreed to them or\r\nnot, in order that they might avoid destruction to their persons or\r\ntheir houses, or a desertion of their shops. This insidious advice\r\ntended to confound those who wished well to the object of the\r\nassociation with the seditious against whom the association was\r\ndirected. By this stratagem, the confederacy intended for preserving the\r\nBritish Constitution and the public peace would be wholly defeated. The\r\nmagistrates, utterly incapable of distinguishing the friends from the\r\nenemies of order, would in vain look for support, when they stood in the\r\ngreatest need of it.\r\n\r\n13. Mr. Fox's whole conduct, on this occasion, was without example. The\r\nvery morning after these violent declamations in the House of Commons\r\nagainst the association, (that is, on Tuesday, the 18th,) he went\r\nhimself to a meeting of St. George's parish, and there signed an\r\nassociation of the nature and tendency of those he had the night before\r\nso vehemently condemned; and several of his particular and most intimate\r\nfriends, inhabitants of that parish, attended and signed along with him.\r\n\r\n14. Immediately after this extraordinary step, and in order perfectly to\r\ndefeat the ends of that association against Jacobin publications,\r\n(which, contrary to his opinions, he had promoted and signed,) a\r\nmischievous society was formed under his auspices, called _The Friends\r\nof the Liberty of the Press_. Their title groundlessly insinuated that\r\nthe freedom of the press had lately suffered, or was now threatened\r\nwith, some violation. This society was only, in reality, another\r\nmodification of the society calling itself _The Friends of the People_,\r\nwhich in the preceding summer had caused so much uneasiness in the Duke\r\nof Portland's mind, and in the minds of several of his friends. This new\r\nsociety was composed of many, if not most, of the members of the club of\r\nthe Friends of the People, with the addition of a vast multitude of\r\nothers (such as Mr. Horne Tooke) of the worst and most seditious\r\ndispositions that could be found in the whole kingdom. In the first\r\nmeeting of this club Mr. Erskine took the lead, and directly (without\r\nany disavowal ever since on Mr. Fox's part) _made use of his name and\r\nauthority in favor of its formation and purposes_. In the same meeting\r\nMr. Erskine had thanks for his defence of Paine, which amounted to a\r\ncomplete avowal of that Jacobin incendiary; else it is impossible to\r\nknow how Mr. Erskine should have deserved such marked applauses for\r\nacting merely as a lawyer for his fee, in the ordinary course of his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n15. Indeed, Mr. Fox appeared the general patron of all such persons and\r\nproceedings. When Lord Edward Fitzgerald, and other persons, for\r\npractices of the most dangerous kind, in Paris and in London, were\r\nremoved from the King's Guards, Mr. Fox took occasion in the House of\r\nCommons heavily to censure that act, as unjust and oppressive, and\r\ntending to make officers bad citizens. There were few, however, who did\r\nnot call for some such measures on the part of government, as of\r\nabsolute necessity for the king's personal safety, as well as that of\r\nthe public; and nothing but the mistaken lenity, with which such\r\npractices were rather discountenanced than punished, could possibly\r\ndeserve reprehension in what was done with regard to those gentlemen.\r\n\r\n16. Mr. Fox regularly and systematically, and with a diligence long\r\nunusual to him, did everything he could to countenance the same\r\nprinciple of fraternity and connection with the Jacobins abroad, and the\r\nNational Convention of France, for which these officers had been removed\r\nfrom the Guards. For when a bill (feeble and lax, indeed, and far short\r\nof the vigor required by the conjuncture) was brought in for removing\r\nout of the kingdom the emissaries of France, Mr. Fox opposed it with all\r\nhis might. He pursued a vehement and detailed opposition to it through\r\nall its stages, describing it as a measure contrary to the existing\r\ntreaties between Great Britain and France, as a violation of the law of\r\nnations, and as an outrage on the Great Charter itself.\r\n\r\n17. In the same manner, and with the same heat, he opposed a bill which\r\n(though awkward and inartificial in its construction) was right and wise\r\nin its principle, and was precedented in the best times, and absolutely\r\nnecessary at that juncture: I mean the Traitorous Correspondence Bill.\r\nBy these means the enemy, rendered infinitely dangerous by the links of\r\nreal faction and pretended commerce, would have been (had Mr. Fox\r\nsucceeded) enabled to carry on the war against us by our own resources.\r\nFor this purpose that enemy would have had his agents and traitors in\r\nthe midst of us.\r\n\r\n18. When at length war was actually declared by the usurpers in France\r\nagainst this kingdom, and declared whilst they were pretending a\r\nnegotiation through Dumouriez with Lord Auckland, Mr. Fox still\r\ncontinued, through the whole of the proceedings, to discredit the\r\nnational honor and justice, and to throw the entire blame of the war on\r\nParliament, and on his own country, as acting with violence,\r\nhaughtiness, and want of equity. He frequently asserted, both at the\r\ntime and ever since, that the war, though declared by France, was\r\nprovoked by us, and that it was wholly unnecessary and fundamentally\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\n19. He has lost no opportunity of railing, in the most virulent manner\r\nand in the most unmeasured language, at every foreign power with whom we\r\ncould now, or at any time, contract any useful or effectual alliance\r\nagainst France,--declaring that he hoped no alliance with those powers\r\nwas made, or was in a train of being made.[1] He always expressed\r\nhimself with the utmost horror concerning such alliances. So did all\r\nhis phalanx. Mr. Sheridan in particular, after one of his invectives\r\nagainst those powers, sitting by him, said, with manifest marks of his\r\napprobation, that, if we must go to war, he had rather go to war alone\r\nthan with such allies.\r\n\r\n20. Immediately after the French declaration of war against us,\r\nParliament addressed the king in support of the war against them, as\r\njust and necessary, and provoked, as well as formally declared against\r\nGreat Britain. He did not divide the House upon this measure; yet he\r\nimmediately followed this our solemn Parliamentary engagement to the\r\nking with a motion proposing a set of resolutions, the effect of which\r\nwas, that the two Houses were to load themselves with every kind of\r\nreproach for having made the address which they had just carried to the\r\nthrone. He commenced this long string of criminatory resolutions against\r\nhis country (if King, Lords, and Commons of Great Britain, and a decided\r\nmajority without doors are his country) _with a declaration against\r\nintermeddling in the interior concerns of France_. The purport of this\r\nresolution of non-interference is a thing unexampled in the history of\r\nthe world, when one nation has been actually at war with another. The\r\nbest writers on the law of nations give no sort of countenance to his\r\ndoctrine of non-interference, in the extent and manner in which he used\r\nit, _even when there is no war_. When the war exists, not one authority\r\nis against it in all its latitude. His doctrine is equally contrary to\r\nthe enemy's uniform practice, who, whether in peace or in war, makes it\r\nhis great aim not only to change the government, but to make an entire\r\nrevolution in the whole of the social order in every country.\r\n\r\nThe object of the last of this extraordinary string of resolutions moved\r\nby Mr. Fox was to advise the crown not to enter into such an engagement\r\nwith any foreign power so as to hinder us from making a _separate_ peace\r\nwith France, or which might tend to enable any of those powers to\r\nintroduce a government in that country other than such as those persons\r\nwhom he calls the people of France shall choose to establish. In short,\r\nthe whole of these resolutions appeared to have but one drift, namely,\r\nthe sacrifice of our own domestic dignity and safety, and the\r\nindependency of Europe, to the support of this strange mixture of\r\nanarchy and tyranny which prevails in France, and which Mr. Fox and his\r\nparty were pleased to call a government. The immediate consequence of\r\nthese measures was (by an example the ill effects of which on the whole\r\nworld are not to be calculated) to secure the robbers of the innocent\r\nnobility, gentry, and ecclesiastics of France in the enjoyment of the\r\nspoil they have made of the estates, houses, and goods of their\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\n21. Not satisfied with moving these resolutions, tending to confirm this\r\nhorrible tyranny and robbery, and with actually dividing the House on\r\nthe first of the long string which they composed, in a few days\r\nafterwards he encouraged and supported Mr. Grey in producing the very\r\nsame string in a new form, and in moving, under the shape of an address\r\nof Parliament to the crown, another virulent libel on all its own\r\nproceedings in this session, in which not only all the ground of the\r\nresolutions was again travelled over, but much new inflammatory matter\r\nwas introduced. In particular, a charge was made, that Great Britain had\r\nnot interposed to prevent the last partition of Poland. On this head\r\nthe party dwelt very largely and very vehemently. Mr. Fox's intention,\r\nin the choice of this extraordinary topic, was evident enough. He well\r\nknows two things: first, that no wise or honest man can approve of that\r\npartition, or can contemplate it without prognosticating great mischief\r\nfrom it to all countries at some future time; secondly, he knows quite\r\nas well, that, let our opinions on that partition be what they will,\r\nEngland, by itself, is not in a situation to afford to Poland any\r\nassistance whatsoever. The purpose of the introduction of Polish\r\npolitics into this discussion was not for the sake of Poland; it was to\r\nthrow an odium upon those who are obliged to decline the cause of\r\njustice from their impossibility of supporting a cause which they\r\napprove: as if we, who think more strongly on this subject than he does,\r\nwere of a party against Poland, because we are obliged to act with some\r\nof the authors of that injustice against our common enemy, France. But\r\nthe great and leading purpose of this introduction of Poland into the\r\ndebates on the French war was to divert the public attention from what\r\nwas in our power, that is, from a steady coöperation against France, to\r\na quarrel with the allies for the sake of a Polish war, which, for any\r\nuseful purpose to Poland, he knew it was out of our power to make. If\r\nEngland can touch Poland ever so remotely, it must be through the medium\r\nof alliances. But by attacking all the combined powers together for\r\ntheir supposed unjust aggression upon France, he bound them by a now\r\ncommon interest not separately to join England for the rescue of Poland.\r\nThe proposition could only mean to do what all the writers of his party\r\nin the Morning Chronicle have aimed at persuading the public to, through\r\nthe whole of the last autumn and winter, and to this hour: that is, to\r\nan alliance with the Jacobins of France, for the pretended purpose of\r\nsuccoring Poland. This curious project would leave to Great Britain no\r\nother ally in all Europe except its old enemy, France.\r\n\r\n22. Mr. Fox, after the first day's discussion on the question for the\r\naddress, was at length driven to admit (to admit rather than to urge,\r\nand that very faintly) that France had discovered ambitious views, which\r\nnone of his partisans, that I recollect, (Mr. Sheridan excepted,) did,\r\nhowever, either urge or admit. What is remarkable enough, all the points\r\nadmitted against the Jacobins were brought to bear in their favor as\r\nmuch as those in which they were defended. For when Mr. Fox admitted\r\nthat the conduct of the Jacobins did discover ambition, he always ended\r\nhis admission of their ambitious views by an apology for them, insisting\r\nthat the universally hostile disposition shown to them rendered their\r\nambition a sort of defensive policy. Thus, on whatever roads he\r\ntravelled, they all terminated in recommending a recognition of their\r\npretended republic, and in the plan of sending an ambassador to it. This\r\nwas the burden of all his song:--\"Everything which we could reasonably\r\nhope from war would be obtained from treaty.\" It is to be observed,\r\nhowever, that, in all these debates, Mr. Fox never once stated to the\r\nHouse upon what ground it was he conceived that all the objects of the\r\nFrench system of united fanaticism and ambition would instantly be given\r\nup, whenever England should think fit to propose a treaty. On proposing\r\nso strange a recognition and so humiliating an embassy as he moved, he\r\nwas bound to produce his authority, if any authority he had. He ought to\r\nhave done this the rather, because Le Brun, in his first propositions,\r\nand in his answers to Lord Grenville, defended, _on principle, not on\r\ntemporary convenience_, everything which was objected to France, and\r\nshowed not the smallest disposition to give up any one of the points in\r\ndiscussion. Mr. Fox must also have known that the Convention had passed\r\nto the order of the day, on a proposition to give some sort of\r\nexplanation or modification to the hostile decree of the 19th of\r\nNovember for exciting insurrections in all countries,--a decree known to\r\nbe peculiarly pointed at Great Britain. The whole proceeding of the\r\nFrench administration was the most remote that could be imagined from\r\nfurnishing any indication of a pacific disposition: for at the very time\r\nin which it was pretended that the Jacobins entertained those boasted\r\npacific intentions, at the very time in which Mr. Fox was urging a\r\ntreaty with them, not content with refusing a modification of the decree\r\nfor insurrections, they published their ever-memorable decree of the\r\n15th of December, 1792, for disorganizing every country in Europe into\r\nwhich they should on any occasion set their foot; and on the 25th and\r\nthe 30th of the same month, they solemnly, and, on the last of these\r\ndays, practically, confirmed that decree.\r\n\r\n23. But Mr. Fox had himself taken good care, in the negotiation he\r\nproposed, that France should not be obliged to make any very great\r\nconcessions to her presumed moderation: for he had laid down one\r\ngeneral, comprehensive rule, with him (as he said) constant and\r\ninviolable. This rule, in fact, would not only have left to the faction\r\nin France all the property and power they had usurped at home, but most,\r\nif not all, of the conquests which by their atrocious perfidy and\r\nviolence they had made abroad. The principle laid down by Mr. Fox is\r\nthis,--\"_That every state, in the conclusion of a war, has a right to\r\navail itself of its conquests towards an indemnification_.\" This\r\nprinciple (true or false) is totally contrary to the policy which this\r\ncountry has pursued with France at various periods, particularly at the\r\nTreaty of Ryswick, in the last century, and at the Treaty of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, in this. Whatever the merits of his rule may be in the\r\neyes of neutral judges, it is a rule which no statesman before him ever\r\nlaid down in favor of the adverse power with whom he was to negotiate.\r\nThe adverse party himself may safely be trusted to take care of his\r\n_own_ aggrandizement. But (as if the black boxes of the several parties\r\nhad been exchanged) Mr. Fox's English ambassador, by some odd mistake,\r\nwould find himself charged with the concerns of France. If we were to\r\nleave France as she stood at the time when Mr. Fox proposed to treat\r\nwith her, that formidable power must have been infinitely strengthened,\r\nand almost every other power in Europe as much weakened, by the\r\nextraordinary basis which he laid for a treaty. For Avignon must go from\r\nthe Pope; Savoy (at least) from the King of Sardinia, if not Nice.\r\nLiege, Mentz, Salm, Deux-Ponts, and Basle must be separated from\r\nGermany. On this side of the Rhine, Liege (at least) must be lost to the\r\nEmpire, and added to France. Mr. Fox's general principle fully covered\r\nall this. How much of these territories came within his rule he never\r\nattempted to define. He kept a profound silence as to Germany. As to\r\nthe Netherlands he was something more explicit. He said (if I recollect\r\nright) that France on that side might expect something towards\r\nstrengthening her frontier. As to the remaining parts of the\r\nNetherlands, which he supposed France might consent to surrender, he\r\nwent so far as to declare that England ought not to permit the Emperor\r\nto be repossessed of the remainder of the ten Provinces, but that _the\r\npeople_ should choose such a form of independent government as they\r\nliked. This proposition of Mr. Fox was just the arrangement which the\r\nusurpation in France had all along proposed to make. As the\r\ncircumstances were at that time, and have been ever since, his\r\nproposition fully indicated what government the Flemings _must_ have in\r\nthe stated extent of what was left to them. A government so set up in\r\nthe Netherlands, whether compulsory, or by the choice of the\r\n_sans-culottes_, (who he well knew were to be the real electors, and the\r\nsole electors,) in whatever name it was to exist, must evidently depend\r\nfor its existence, as it had done for its original formation, on France.\r\nIn reality, it must have ended in that point to which, piece by piece,\r\nthe French were then actually bringing all the Netherlands,--that is, an\r\nincorporation with France as a body of new Departments, just as Savoy\r\nand Liege and the rest of their pretended independent popular\r\nsovereignties have been united to their republic. Such an arrangement\r\nmust have destroyed Austria; it must have left Holland always at the\r\nmercy of France; it must totally and forever cut off all political\r\ncommunication between England and the Continent. Such must have been the\r\nsituation of Europe, according to Mr. Fox's system of politics, however\r\nlaudable his personal motives may have been in proposing so complete a\r\nchange in the whole system of Great Britain with regard to all the\r\nContinental powers.\r\n\r\n24. After it had been generally supposed that all public business was\r\nover for the session, and that Mr. Fox had exhausted all the modes of\r\npressing this French scheme, he thought proper to take a step beyond\r\nevery expectation, and which demonstrated his wonderful eagerness and\r\nperseverance in his cause, as well as the nature and true character of\r\nthe cause itself. This step was taken by Mr. Fox immediately after his\r\ngiving his assent to the grant of supply voted to him by Mr. Serjeant\r\nAdair and a committee of gentlemen who assumed to themselves to act in\r\nthe name of the public. In the instrument of his acceptance of this\r\ngrant, Mr. Fox took occasion to assure them that he would always\r\npersevere _in the same conduct_ which had procured to him so honorable a\r\nmark of the public approbation. He was as good as his word.\r\n\r\n25. It was not long before an opportunity was found, or made, for\r\nproving the sincerity of his professions, and demonstrating his\r\ngratitude to those who had given public and unequivocal marks of their\r\napprobation of his late conduct. One of the most virulent of the Jacobin\r\nfaction, Mr. Gurney, a banker at Norwich, had all along distinguished\r\nhimself by his French politics. By the means of this gentleman, and of\r\nhis associates of the same description, one of the most insidious and\r\ndangerous handbills that ever was seen had been circulated at Norwich\r\nagainst the war, drawn up in an hypocritical tone of compassion for the\r\npoor. This address to the populace of Norwich was to play in concert\r\nwith an address to Mr. Fox; it was signed by Mr. Gurney and the higher\r\npart of the French fraternity in that town. In this paper Mr. Fox is\r\napplauded for his conduct throughout the session, and requested, before\r\nthe prorogation, to make a motion for an immediate peace with France.\r\n\r\n26. Mr. Fox did not revoke to this suit: he readily and thankfully\r\nundertook the task assigned to him. Not content, however, with merely\r\nfalling in with their wishes, he proposed a task on his part to the\r\ngentlemen of Norwich, which was, _that they should move the people\r\nwithout doors to petition against the war_. He said, that, without such\r\nassistance, little good could be expected from anything he might attempt\r\nwithin the walls of the House of Commons. In the mean time, to animate\r\nhis Norwich friends in their endeavors to besiege Parliament, he\r\nsnatched the first opportunity to give notice of a motion which he very\r\nsoon after made, namely, to address the crown to make peace with France.\r\nThe address was so worded as to coöperate with the handbill in bringing\r\nforward matter calculated to inflame the manufacturers throughout the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n27. In support of his motion, he declaimed in the most virulent strain,\r\neven beyond any of his former invectives, against every power with whom\r\nwe were then, and are now, acting against France. In the _moral_ forum\r\nsome of these powers certainly deserve all the ill he said of them; but\r\nthe _political_ effect aimed at, evidently, was to turn our indignation\r\nfrom France, with whom we were at war, upon Russia, or Prussia, or\r\nAustria, or Sardinia, or all of them together. In consequence of his\r\nknowledge that we _could_ not effectually do _without_ them, and his\r\nresolution that we _should_ not act _with_ them, he proposed, that,\r\nhaving, as he asserted, \"obtained the only avowed object of the war (the\r\nevacuation of Holland) we ought to conclude an instant peace.\"\r\n\r\n28. Mr. Fox could not be ignorant of the mistaken basis upon which his\r\nmotion was grounded. He was not ignorant, that, though the attempt of\r\nDumouriez on Holland, (so very near succeeding,) and the navigation of\r\nthe Scheldt, (a part of the same piece,) were among the _immediate_\r\ncauses, they were by no means the only causes, alleged for Parliament's\r\ntaking that offence at the proceedings of France, for which the Jacobins\r\nwere so prompt in declaring war upon this kingdom. Other full as weighty\r\ncauses had been alleged: they were,--1. The general overbearing and\r\ndesperate ambition of that faction; 2. Their actual attacks on every\r\nnation in Europe; 3. Their usurpation of territories in the Empire with\r\nthe governments of which they had no pretence of quarrel; 4. Their\r\nperpetual and irrevocable consolidation with their own dominions of\r\nevery territory of the Netherlands, of Germany, and of Italy, of which\r\nthey got a temporary possession; 5. The mischiefs attending the\r\nprevalence of their system, which would make the success of their\r\nambitious designs a new and peculiar species of calamity in the world;\r\n6. Their formal, public decrees, particularly those of the 19th of\r\nNovember and 15th and 25th of December; 7. Their notorious attempts to\r\nundermine the Constitution of this country; 8. Their public reception of\r\ndeputations of traitors for that direct purpose; 9. Their murder of\r\ntheir sovereign, declared by most of the members of the Convention, who\r\nspoke with their vote, (without a disavowal from any,) to be perpetrated\r\nas an example to _all_ kings and a precedent for _all_ subjects to\r\nfollow. All these, and not the Scheldt alone, or the invasion of\r\nHolland, were urged by the minister, and by Mr. Windham, by myself, and\r\nby others who spoke in those debates, as causes for bringing France to a\r\nsense of her wrong in the war which she declared against us. Mr. Fox\r\nwell knew that not one man argued for the necessity of a vigorous\r\nresistance to France, who did not state the war as being for the very\r\nexistence of the social order here, and in every part of Europe,--who\r\ndid not state his opinion that this war was not at all a foreign war of\r\nempire, but as much for our liberties, properties, laws, and religion,\r\nand even more so, than any we had ever been engaged in. This was the war\r\nwhich, according to Mr. Fox and Mr. Gurney, we were to abandon before\r\nthe enemy had felt in the slightest degree the impression of our arms.\r\n\r\n29. Had Mr. Fox's disgraceful proposal been complied with, this kingdom\r\nwould have been stained with a blot of perfidy hitherto without an\r\nexample in our history, and with far less excuse than any act of perfidy\r\nwhich we find in the history of any other nation. The moment when, by\r\nthe incredible exertions of Austria, (very little through ours,) the\r\ntemporary deliverance of Holland (in effect our own deliverance) had\r\nbeen achieved, he advised the House instantly to abandon her to that\r\nvery enemy from whose arms she had freed ourselves and the closest of\r\nour allies.\r\n\r\n30. But we are not to be imposed on by forms of language. We must act on\r\nthe substance of things. To abandon Austria in this manner was to\r\nabandon Holland itself. For suppose France, encouraged and strengthened\r\nas she must have been by our treacherous desertion,--suppose France, I\r\nsay, to succeed against Austria, (as she had succeeded the very year\r\nbefore,) England would, after its disarmament, have nothing in the world\r\nbut the inviolable faith of Jacobinism and the steady politics of\r\nanarchy to depend upon, against France's renewing the very same attempts\r\nupon Holland, and renewing them (considering what Holland was and is)\r\nwith much better prospects of success. Mr. Fox must have been well\r\naware, that, if we were to break with the greater Continental powers,\r\nand particularly to come to a rupture with them, in the violent and\r\nintemperate mode in which he would have made the breach, the defence of\r\nHolland against a foreign enemy and a strong domestic faction must\r\nhereafter rest solely upon England, without the chance of a single ally,\r\neither on that or on any other occasion. So far as to the pretended sole\r\nobject of the war, which Mr. Fox supposed to be so completely obtained\r\n(but which then was not at all, and at this day is not completely\r\nobtained) as to leave us nothing else to do than to cultivate a\r\npeaceful, quiet correspondence with those quiet, peaceable, and moderate\r\npeople, the Jacobins of France.\r\n\r\n31. To induce us to this, Mr. Fox labored hard to make it appear that\r\nthe powers with whom we acted were full as ambitious and as perfidious\r\nas the French. This might be true as to _other_ nations. They had not,\r\nhowever, been so to _us_ or to Holland. He produced no proof of active\r\nambition and ill faith against Austria. But supposing the combined\r\npowers had been all thus faithless, and been all alike so, there was one\r\ncircumstance which made an essential difference between them and\r\nFrance. I need not, therefore, be at the trouble of contesting this\r\npoint,--which, however, in this latitude, and as at all affecting Great\r\nBritain and Holland, I deny utterly. Be it so. But the great monarchies\r\nhave it in their power to keep their faith, _if they please_, because\r\nthey are governments of established and recognized authority at home and\r\nabroad. France had, in reality, no government. The very factions who\r\nexercised power had no stability. The French Convention had no powers of\r\npeace or war. Supposing the Convention to be free, (most assuredly it\r\nwas not,) they had shown no disposition to abandon their projects.\r\nThough long driven out of Liege, it was not many days before Mr. Fox's\r\nmotion that they still continued to claim it as a country which their\r\nprinciples of fraternity bound them to protect,--that is, to subdue and\r\nto regulate at their pleasure. That party which Mr. Fox inclined most to\r\nfavor and trust, and from which he must have received his assurances,\r\n(if any he did receive,) that is, the _Brissotins_, were then either\r\nprisoners or fugitives. The party which prevailed over them (that of\r\nDanton and Marat) was itself in a tottering condition, and was disowned\r\nby a very great part of France. To say nothing of the royal party, who\r\nwere powerful and growing, and who had full as good a right to claim to\r\nbe the legitimate government as any of the Parisian factions with whom\r\nhe proposed to treat,--or rather, (as it seemed to me,) to surrender at\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\n32. But when Mr. Fox began to come from his general hopes of the\r\nmoderation of the Jacobins to particulars, he put the case that they\r\nmight not perhaps be willing to surrender Savoy. He certainly was not\r\nwilling to contest that point with them, but plainly and explicitly (as\r\nI understood him) proposed to let them keep it,--though he knew (or he\r\nwas much worse informed than he would be thought) that England had at\r\nthe very time agreed on the terms of a treaty with the King of Sardinia,\r\nof which the recovery of Savoy was the _casus fœderis_. In the teeth of\r\nthis treaty, Mr. Fox proposed a direct and most scandalous breach of our\r\nfaith, formally and recently given. But to surrender Savoy was to\r\nsurrender a great deal more than so many square acres of land or so much\r\nrevenue. In its consequences, the surrender of Savoy was to make a\r\nsurrender to France of Switzerland and Italy, of both which countries\r\nSavoy is the key,--as it is known to ordinary speculators in politics,\r\nthough it may not be known to the weavers in Norwich, who, it seems, are\r\nby Mr. Fox called to be the judges in this matter.\r\n\r\nA sure way, indeed, to encourage France not to make a surrender of this\r\nkey of Italy and Switzerland, or of Mentz, the key of Germany, or of any\r\nother object whatsoever which she holds, is to let her see _that the\r\npeople of England raise a clamor against the war before terms are so\r\nmuch as proposed on any side_. From that moment the Jacobins would be\r\nmasters of the terms. They would know that Parliament, at all hazards,\r\nwould force the king to a separate peace. The crown could not, in that\r\ncase, have any use of its judgment. Parliament could not possess more\r\njudgment than the crown, when besieged (as Mr. Fox proposed to Mr.\r\nGurney) by the cries of the manufacturers. This description of men Mr.\r\nFox endeavored in his speech by every method to irritate and inflame. In\r\neffect, his two speeches were, through the whole, nothing more than an\r\namplification of the Norwich handbill. He rested the greatest part of\r\nhis argument on the distress of trade, which he attributed to the war;\r\nthough it was obvious to any tolerably good observation, and, much more,\r\nmust have been clear to such an observation as his, that the then\r\ndifficulties of the trade and manufacture could have no sort of\r\nconnection with our share in it. The war had hardly begun. We had\r\nsuffered neither by spoil, nor by defeat, nor by disgrace of any kind.\r\nPublic credit was so little impaired, that, instead of being supported\r\nby any extraordinary aids from individuals, it advanced a credit to\r\nindividuals to the amount of five millions for the support of trade and\r\nmanufactures under their temporary difficulties, a thing before never\r\nheard of,--a thing of which I do not commend the policy, but only state\r\nit, to show that Mr. Fox's ideas of the effects of war were without any\r\ntrace of foundation.\r\n\r\n33. It is impossible not to connect the arguments and proceedings of a\r\nparty with that of its leader,--especially when not disavowed or\r\ncontrolled by him. Mr. Fox's partisans declaim against all the powers of\r\nEurope, except the Jacobins, just as he does; but not having the same\r\nreasons for management and caution which he has, they speak out. He\r\nsatisfies himself merely with making his invectives, and leaves others\r\nto draw the conclusion. But they produce their Polish interposition for\r\nthe express purpose of leading to a French alliance. They urge their\r\nFrench peace in order to make a junction with the Jacobins to oppose the\r\npowers, whom, in their language, they call despots, and their leagues, a\r\ncombination of despots. Indeed, no man can look on the present posture\r\nof Europe with the least degree of discernment, who will not be\r\nthoroughly convinced that England must be the fast friend or the\r\ndetermined enemy of France. There is no medium; and I do not think Mr.\r\nFox to be so dull as not to observe this. His peace would have involved\r\nus instantly in the most extensive and most ruinous wars, at the same\r\ntime that it would have made a broad highway (across which no human\r\nwisdom could put an effectual barrier) for a mutual intercourse with the\r\nfraternizing Jacobins on both sides, the consequences of which those\r\nwill certainly not provide against who do not dread or dislike them.\r\n\r\n34. It is not amiss in this place to enter a little more fully into the\r\nspirit of the principal arguments on which Mr. Fox thought proper to\r\nrest this his grand and concluding motion, particularly such as were\r\ndrawn from the internal state of our affairs. Under a specious\r\nappearance, (not uncommonly put on by men of unscrupulous ambition,)\r\nthat of tenderness and compassion to the poor, he did his best to appeal\r\nto the judgments of the meanest and most ignorant of the people on the\r\nmerits of the war. He had before done something of the same dangerous\r\nkind in his printed letter. The ground of a political war is of all\r\nthings that which the poor laborer and manufacturer are the least\r\ncapable of conceiving. This sort of people know in general that they\r\nmust suffer by war. It is a matter to which they are sufficiently\r\ncompetent, because it is a matter of feeling. The _causes_ of a war are\r\nnot matters of feeling, but of reason and foresight, and often of remote\r\nconsiderations, and of a very great combination of circumstances which\r\n_they_ are utterly incapable of comprehending: and, indeed, it is not\r\nevery man in the highest classes who is altogether equal to it. Nothing,\r\nin a general sense, appears to me less fair and justifiable (even if no\r\nattempt were made to inflame the passions) than to submit a matter on\r\ndiscussion to a tribunal incapable of judging of more than _one side_ of\r\nthe question. It is at least as unjustifiable to inflame the passions of\r\nsuch judges against _that side_ in favor of which they cannot so much as\r\ncomprehend the arguments. Before the prevalence of the French system,\r\n(which, as far as it has gone, has extinguished the salutary prejudice\r\ncalled our country,) nobody was more sensible of this important truth\r\nthan Mr. Fox; and nothing was more proper and pertinent, or was more\r\nfelt at the time, than his reprimand to Mr. Wilberforce for an\r\ninconsiderate expression which tended to call in the judgment of the\r\npoor to estimate the policy of war upon the standard of the taxes they\r\nmay be obliged to pay towards its support.\r\n\r\n35. It is fatally known that the great object of the Jacobin system is,\r\nto excite the lowest description of the people to range themselves under\r\nambitious men for the pillage and destruction of the more eminent orders\r\nand classes of the community. The thing, therefore, that a man not\r\nfanatically attached to that dreadful project would most studiously\r\navoid is, to act a part with the French _Propagandists_, in attributing\r\n(as they constantly do) all wars, and all the consequences of wars, to\r\nthe pride of those orders, and to their contempt of the weak and\r\nindigent part of the society. The ruling Jacobins insist upon it, that\r\neven the wars which they carry on with so much obstinacy against all\r\nnations are made to prevent the poor from any longer being the\r\ninstruments and victims of kings, nobles, and the aristocracy of\r\nburghers and rich men. They pretend that the destruction of kings,\r\nnobles, and the aristocracy of burghers and rich men is the only means\r\nof establishing an universal and perpetual peace. This is the great\r\ndrift of all their writings, from the time of the meeting of the states\r\nof France, in 1789, to the publication of the last Morning Chronicle.\r\nThey insist that even the war which with so much boldness they have\r\ndeclared against all nations is to prevent the poor from becoming the\r\ninstruments and victims of these persons and descriptions. It is but too\r\neasy, if you once teach poor laborers and mechanics to defy their\r\nprejudices, and, as this has been done with an industry scarcely\r\ncredible, to substitute the principles of fraternity in the room of that\r\nsalutary prejudice called our country,--it is, I say, but too easy to\r\npersuade them, agreeably to what Mr. Fox hints in his public letter,\r\nthat this war is, and that the other wars have been, the wars of kings;\r\nit is easy to persuade them that the terrors even of a foreign conquest\r\nare not terrors for _them_; it is easy to persuade them, that, for their\r\npart, _they_ have nothing to lose,--and that their condition is not\r\nlikely to be altered for the worse, whatever party may happen to prevail\r\nin the war. Under any circumstances this doctrine is highly dangerous,\r\nas it tends to make separate parties of the higher and lower orders, and\r\nto put their interests on a different bottom. But if the enemy you have\r\nto deal with should appear, as France now appears, under the very name\r\nand title of the deliverer of the poor and the chastiser of the rich,\r\nthe former class would readily become not an indifferent spectator of\r\nthe war, but would be ready to enlist in the faction of the\r\nenemy,--which they would consider, though under a foreign name, to be\r\nmore connected with them than an adverse description in the same land.\r\nAll the props of society would be drawn from us by these doctrines, and\r\nthe very foundations of the public defence would give way in an instant.\r\n\r\n36. There is no point which the faction of fraternity in England have\r\nlabored more than to excite in the poor the horror of any war with\r\nFrance upon any occasion. When they found that their open attacks upon\r\nour Constitution in favor of a French republic were for the present\r\nrepelled, they put that matter out of sight, and have taken up the more\r\nplausible and popular ground of general peace, upon merely general\r\nprinciples; although these very men, in the correspondence of their\r\nclubs with those of France, had reprobated the neutrality which now they\r\nso earnestly press. But, in reality, their maxim was, and is, \"Peace and\r\nalliance with France, and war with the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\n37. This last motion of Mr. Fox bound up the whole of his politics\r\nduring the session. This motion had many circumstances, particularly in\r\nthe Norwich correspondence, by which the mischief of all the others was\r\naggravated beyond measure. Yet this last motion, far the worst of Mr.\r\nFox's proceedings, was the best supported of any of them, except his\r\namendment to the address. The Duke of Portland had directly engaged to\r\nsupport the war;--here was a motion as directly made to force the crown\r\nto put an end to it before a blow had been struck. The efforts of the\r\nfaction have so prevailed that some of his Grace's nearest friends have\r\nactually voted for that motion; some, after showing themselves, went\r\naway; others did not appear at all. So it must be, where a man is for\r\nany time supported from personal considerations, without reference to\r\nhis public conduct. Through the whole of this business, the spirit of\r\nfraternity appears to me to have been the governing principle. It might\r\nbe shameful for any man, above the vulgar, to show so blind a partiality\r\neven to his own country as Mr. Fox appears, on all occasions, this\r\nsession, to have shown to France. Had Mr. Fox been a minister, and\r\nproceeded on the principles laid down by him, I believe there is little\r\ndoubt he would have been considered as the most criminal statesman that\r\never lived in this country. I do not know why a statesman out of place\r\nis not to be judged in the same manner, unless we can excuse him by\r\npleading in his favor a total indifference to principle, and that he\r\nwould act and think in quite a different way, if he were in office. This\r\nI will not suppose. One may think better of him, and that, in case of\r\nhis power, he might change his mind. But supposing, that, from better or\r\nfrom worse motives, he might change his mind on his acquisition of the\r\nfavor of the crown, I seriously fear, that, if the king should to-morrow\r\nput power into his hands, and that his good genius would inspire him\r\nwith maxims very different from those he has promulgated, he would not\r\nbe able to get the better of the ill temper and the ill doctrines he has\r\nbeen the means of exciting and propagating throughout the kingdom. From\r\nthe very beginning of their inhuman and unprovoked rebellion and\r\ntyrannic usurpation, he has covered the predominant faction in France,\r\nand their adherents here, with the most exaggerated panegyrics; neither\r\nhas he missed a single opportunity of abusing and vilifying those who,\r\nin uniform concurrence with the Duke of Portland's and Lord\r\nFitzwilliam's opinion, have maintained the true grounds of the\r\nRevolution Settlement in 1688. He lamented all the defeats of the\r\nFrench; he rejoiced in all their victories,--even when these victories\r\nthreatened to overwhelm the continent of Europe, and, by facilitating\r\ntheir means of penetrating into Holland, to bring this most dreadful of\r\nall evils with irresistible force to the very doors, if not into the\r\nvery heart, of our country. To this hour he always speaks of every\r\nthought of overturning the French Jacobinism by force, on the part of\r\nany power whatsoever, as an attempt unjust and cruel, and which he\r\nreprobates with horror. If any of the French Jacobin leaders are spoken\r\nof with hatred or scorn, he falls upon those who take that liberty with\r\nall the zeal and warmth with which men of honor defend their particular\r\nand bosom friends, when attacked. He always represents their cause as a\r\ncause of liberty, and all who oppose it as partisans of despotism. He\r\nobstinately continues to consider the great and growing vices, crimes,\r\nand disorders of that country as only evils of passage, which are to\r\nproduce a permanently happy state of order and freedom. He represents\r\nthese disorders exactly in the same way and with the same limitations\r\nwhich are used by one of the two great Jacobin factions: I mean that of\r\nPétion and Brissot. Like them, he studiously confines his horror and\r\nreprobation only to the massacres of the 2d of September, and passes by\r\nthose of the 10th of August, as well as the imprisonment and deposition\r\nof the king, which were the consequences of that day, as indeed were the\r\nmassacres themselves to which he confines his censure, though they were\r\nnot actually perpetrated till early in September. Like that faction, he\r\ncondemns, not the deposition, or the proposed exile or perpetual\r\nimprisonment, but only the murder of the king. Mr. Sheridan, on every\r\noccasion, palliates all their massacres committed in every part of\r\nFrance, as the effects of a natural indignation at the exorbitances of\r\ndespotism, and of the dread of the people of returning under that yoke.\r\nHe has thus taken occasion to load, not the actors in this wickedness,\r\nbut the government of a mild, merciful, beneficent, and patriotic\r\nprince, and his suffering, faithful subjects, with all the crimes of the\r\nnew anarchical tyranny under which the one has been murdered and the\r\nothers are oppressed. Those continual either praises or palliating\r\napologies of everything done in France, and those invectives as\r\nuniformly vomited out upon all those who venture to express their\r\ndisapprobation of such proceedings, coming from a man of Mr. Fox's fame\r\nand authority, and one who is considered as the person to whom a great\r\nparty of the wealthiest men of the kingdom look up, have been the cause\r\nwhy the principle of French fraternity formerly gained the ground which\r\nat one time it had obtained in this country. It will infallibly recover\r\nitself again, and in ten times a greater degree, if the kind of peace,\r\nin the manner which he preaches, ever shall be established with the\r\nreigning faction in France.\r\n\r\n38. So far as to the French practices with regard to France and the\r\nother powers of Europe. As to their principles and doctrines with\r\nregard to the constitution of states, Mr. Fox studiously, on all\r\noccasions, and indeed when no occasion calls for it, (as on the debate\r\nof the petition for reform,) brings forward and asserts their\r\nfundamental and fatal principle, pregnant with every mischief and every\r\ncrime, namely, that \"in every country the people is the legitimate\r\nsovereign\": exactly conformable to the declaration of the French clubs\r\nand legislators:--\"La souveraineté est _une, indivisible, inalienable,\r\net imprescriptible_; elle appartient à la nation; aucune _section_ du\r\npeuple ni aucun _individu_ ne peut s'en attribuer l'exercise.\" This\r\nconfounds, in a manner equally mischievous and stupid, the origin of a\r\ngovernment from the people with its continuance in their hands. I\r\nbelieve that no such doctrine has ever been heard of in any public act\r\nof any government whatsoever, until it was adopted (I think from the\r\nwritings of Rousseau) by the French Assemblies, who have made it the\r\nbasis of their Constitution at home, and of the matter of their\r\napostolate in every country. These and other wild declarations of\r\nabstract principle, Mr. Fox says, are in themselves perfectly right and\r\ntrue; though in some cases he allows the French draw absurd consequences\r\nfrom them. But I conceive he is mistaken. The consequences are most\r\nlogically, though most mischievously, drawn from the premises and\r\nprinciples by that wicked and ungracious faction. The fault is in the\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n39. Before society, in a multitude of men, it is obvious that\r\nsovereignty and subjection are ideas which cannot exist. It is the\r\ncompact on which society is formed that makes both. But to suppose the\r\npeople, contrary to their compacts, both to give away and retain the\r\nsame thing is altogether absurd. It is worse, for it supposes in any\r\nstrong combination of men a power and right of always dissolving the\r\nsocial union; which power, however, if it exists, renders them again as\r\nlittle sovereigns as subjects, but a mere unconnected multitude. It is\r\nnot easy to state for what good end, at a time like this, when the\r\nfoundations of all ancient and prescriptive governments, such as ours,\r\n(to which people submit, not because they have chosen them, but because\r\nthey are born to them,) are undermined by perilous theories, that Mr.\r\nFox should be so fond of referring to those theories, upon all\r\noccasions, even though speculatively they might be true,--which God\r\nforbid they should! Particularly I do not see the reason why he should\r\nbe so fond of declaring that the principles of the Revolution have made\r\nthe crown of Great Britain _elective_,--why he thinks it seasonable to\r\npreach up with so much earnestness, for now three years together, the\r\ndoctrine of resistance and revolution at all,--or to assert that our\r\nlast Revolution, of 1688, stands on the same or similar principles with\r\nthat of France. We are not called upon to bring forward these doctrines,\r\nwhich are hardly ever resorted to but in cases of extremity, and where\r\nthey are followed by correspondent actions. We are not called upon by\r\nany circumstance, that I know of, which can justify a revolt, or which\r\ndemands a revolution, or can make an election of a successor to the\r\ncrown necessary, whatever latent right may be supposed to exist for\r\neffectuating any of these purposes.\r\n\r\n40. Not the least alarming of the proceedings of Mr. Fox and his friends\r\nin this session, especially taken in concurrence with their whole\r\nproceedings with regard to France and its principles, is their eagerness\r\nat this season, under pretence of Parliamentary reforms, (a project\r\nwhich had been for some time rather dormant,) to discredit and disgrace\r\nthe House of Commons. For this purpose these gentlemen had found a way\r\nto insult the House by several atrocious libels in the form of\r\npetitions. In particular they brought up a libel, or rather a complete\r\ndigest of libellous matter, from the club called the Friends of the\r\nPeople. It is, indeed, at once the most audacious and the most insidious\r\nof all the performances of that kind which have yet appeared. It is said\r\nto be the penmanship of Mr. Tierney, to bring whom into Parliament the\r\nDuke of Portland formerly had taken a good deal of pains, and expended,\r\nas I hear, a considerable sum of money.\r\n\r\n41. Among the circumstances of danger from that piece, and from its\r\nprecedent, it is observable that this is the first petition (if I\r\nremember right) _coming from a club or association, signed by\r\nindividuals, denoting neither local residence nor corporate capacity_.\r\nThis mode of petition, not being strictly illegal or informal, though in\r\nits spirit in the highest degree mischievous, may and will lead to other\r\nthings of that nature, tending to bring these clubs and associations to\r\nthe French model, and to make them in the end answer French purposes: I\r\nmean, that, without legal names, these clubs will be led to assume\r\npolitical capacities; that they may debate the forms of Constitution;\r\nand that from their meetings they may insolently dictate their will to\r\nthe regular authorities of the kingdom, in the manner in which the\r\nJacobin clubs issue their mandates to the National Assembly or the\r\nNational Convention. The audacious remonstrance, I observe, is signed\r\nby all of that association (the Friends of the People) _who are not in\r\nParliament_, and it was supported most strenuously by all the\r\nassociators _who are members_, with Mr. Fox at their head. He and they\r\ncontended for referring this libel to a committee. Upon the question of\r\nthat reference they grounded all their debate for a change in the\r\nconstitution of Parliament. The pretended petition is, in fact, a\r\nregular charge or impeachment of the House of Commons, digested into a\r\nnumber of articles. This plan of reform is not a criminal impeachment,\r\nbut a matter of prudence, to be submitted to the public wisdom, which\r\nmust be as well apprised of the facts as petitioners can be. But those\r\naccusers of the House of Commons have proceeded upon the principles of a\r\ncriminal process, and have had the effrontery to offer proof on each\r\narticle.\r\n\r\n42. This charge the party of Mr. Fox maintained article by article,\r\nbeginning with the first,--namely, the interference of peers at\r\nelections, and their nominating in effect several of the members of the\r\nHouse of Commons. In the printed list of grievances which they made out\r\non the occasion, and in support of their charge, is found the borough\r\nfor which, under Lord Fitzwilliam's influence, I now sit. By this\r\nremonstrance, and its object, they hope to defeat the operation of\r\nproperty in elections, and in reality to dissolve the connection and\r\ncommunication of interests which makes the Houses of Parliament a mutual\r\nsupport to each other. Mr. Fox and the Friends of the People are not so\r\nignorant as not to know that peers do not interfere in elections as\r\npeers, but as men of property; they well know that the House of Lords\r\nis by itself the feeblest part of the Constitution; they know that the\r\nHouse of Lords is supported only by its connections with the crown and\r\nwith the House of Commons, and that without this double connection the\r\nLords could not exist a single year. They know that all these parts of\r\nour Constitution, whilst they are balanced as opposing interests, are\r\nalso connected as friends; otherwise nothing but confusion could be the\r\nresult of such a complex Constitution. It is natural, therefore, that\r\nthey who wish the common destruction of the whole and of all its parts\r\nshould contend for their total separation. But as the House of Commons\r\nis that link which connects both the other parts of the Constitution\r\n(the Crown and the Lords) _with the mass of the people_, it is to that\r\nlink (as it is natural enough) that their incessant attacks are\r\ndirected. That artificial representation of the people being once\r\ndiscredited and overturned, all goes to pieces, and nothing but a plain\r\n_French_ democracy or arbitrary monarchy can possibly exist.\r\n\r\n43. Some of these gentlemen who have attacked the House of Commons lean\r\nto a representation of the people by the head,--that is, to _individual\r\nrepresentation_. None of them, that I recollect, except Mr. Fox,\r\ndirectly rejected it. It is remarkable, however, that he only rejected\r\nit by simply declaring an opinion. He let all the argument go against\r\nhis opinion. All the proceedings and arguments of his reforming friends\r\nlead to individual representation, and to nothing else. It deserves to\r\nbe attentively observed, _that this individual representation is the\r\nonly plan of their reform which has been explicitly proposed_. In the\r\nmean time, the conduct of Mr. Fox appears to be far more inexplicable,\r\non any good ground, than theirs, who propose the individual\r\nrepresentation; for he neither proposes anything, nor even suggests that\r\nhe has anything to propose, in lieu of the present mode of constituting\r\nthe House of Commons; on the contrary, he declares against all the plans\r\nwhich have yet been suggested, either from himself or others: yet, thus\r\nunprovided with any plan whatsoever, he pressed forward this unknown\r\nreform with all possible warmth; and for that purpose, in a speech of\r\nseveral hours, he urged the referring to a committee the libellous\r\nimpeachment of the House of Commons by the association of the Friends of\r\nthe People. But for Mr. Fox to discredit Parliament _as it stands_, to\r\ncountenance leagues, covenants, and associations for its further\r\ndiscredit, to render it perfectly odious and contemptible, and at the\r\nsame time to propose nothing at all in place of what he disgraces, is\r\nworse, if possible, than to contend for personal individual\r\nrepresentation, and is little less than demanding, in plain terms, to\r\nbring on plain anarchy.\r\n\r\n44. Mr. Fox and these gentlemen have for the present been defeated; but\r\nthey are neither converted nor disheartened. They have solemnly declared\r\nthat they will persevere until they shall have obtained their\r\nends,--persisting to assert that the House of Commons not only is not\r\nthe true representative of the people, but that it does not answer the\r\npurpose of such representation: most of them insist that all the debts,\r\nthe taxes, and the burdens of all kinds on the people, with every other\r\nevil and inconvenience which we have suffered since the Revolution, have\r\nbeen owing solely to an House of Commons which does not speak the sense\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n45. It is also not to be forgotten, that Mr. Fox, and all who hold with\r\nhim, on this, as on all other occasions of pretended reform, most\r\nbitterly reproach Mr. Pitt with treachery, in declining to support the\r\nscandalous charges and indefinite projects of this infamous libel from\r\nthe Friends of the People. By the animosity with which they persecute\r\nall those who grow cold in this cause of pretended reform, they hope,\r\nthat, if, through levity, inexperience, or ambition, any young person\r\n(like Mr. Pitt, for instance) happens to be once embarked in their\r\ndesign, they shall by a false shame keep him fast in it forever. Many\r\nthey have so hampered.\r\n\r\n46. I know it is usual, when the peril and alarm of the hour appears to\r\nbe a little overblown, to think no more of the matter. But, for my part,\r\nI look back with horror on what we have escaped, and am full of anxiety\r\nwith regard to the dangers which in my opinion are still to be\r\napprehended both at home and abroad. This business has cast deep roots.\r\nWhether it is necessarily connected in theory with Jacobinism is not\r\nworth a dispute. The two things are connected in fact. The partisans of\r\nthe one are the partisans of the other. I know it is common with those\r\nwho are favorable to the gentlemen of Mr. Fox's party and to their\r\nleader, though not at all devoted to all their reforming projects or\r\ntheir Gallican politics, to argue, in palliation of their conduct, that\r\nit is not in their power to do all the harm which their actions\r\nevidently tend to. It is said, that, as the people will not support\r\nthem, they may safely be indulged in those eccentric fancies of reform,\r\nand those theories which lead to nothing. This apology is not very much\r\nto the honor of those politicians whose interests are to be adhered to\r\nin defiance of their conduct. I cannot flatter myself that these\r\nincessant attacks on the constitution of Parliament are safe. It is not\r\nin my power to despise the unceasing efforts of a confederacy of about\r\nfifty persons of eminence: men, for the far greater part, of very ample\r\nfortunes either in possession or in expectancy; men of decided\r\ncharacters and vehement passions; men of very great talents of all\r\nkinds, of much boldness, and of the greatest possible spirit of\r\nartifice, intrigue, adventure, and enterprise, all operating with\r\nunwearied activity and perseverance. These gentlemen are much stronger,\r\ntoo, without doors than some calculate. They have the more active part\r\nof the Dissenters with them, and the whole clan of speculators of all\r\ndenominations,--a large and growing species. They have that floating\r\nmultitude which goes with events, and which suffers the loss or gain of\r\na battle to decide its opinions of right and wrong. As long as by every\r\nart this party keeps alive a spirit of disaffection against the very\r\nConstitution of the kingdom, and attributes, as lately it has been in\r\nthe habit of doing, all the public misfortunes to that Constitution, it\r\nis absolutely _impossible_ but that some moment must arrive in which\r\nthey will be enabled to produce a pretended reform and a real\r\nrevolution. If ever the body of this _compound Constitution_ of ours is\r\nsubverted, either in favor of unlimited monarchy or of wild democracy,\r\nthat ruin will _most certainly_ be the result of this very sort of\r\nmachinations against the House of Commons. It is not from a confidence\r\nin the views or intentions of any statesman that I think he is to be\r\nindulged in these perilous amusements.\r\n\r\n47. Before it is made the great object of any man's political life to\r\nraise another to power, it is right to consider what are the real\r\ndispositions of the person to be so elevated. We are not to form our\r\njudgment on those dispositions from the rules and principles of a court\r\nof justice, but from those of private discretion,--not looking for what\r\nwould serve to criminate another, but what is sufficient to direct\r\nourselves. By a comparison of a series of the discourses and actions of\r\ncertain men for a reasonable length of time, it is impossible not to\r\nobtain sufficient indication of the general tendency of their views and\r\nprinciples. There is no other rational mode of proceeding. It is true,\r\nthat in some one or two perhaps not well-weighed expressions, or some\r\none or two unconnected and doubtful affairs, we may and ought to judge\r\nof the actions or words by our previous good or ill opinion of the man.\r\nBut this allowance has its bounds. It does not extend to any regular\r\ncourse of systematic action, or of constant and repeated discourse. It\r\nis against every principle of common sense, and of justice to one's self\r\nand to the public, to judge of a series of speeches and actions from the\r\nman, and not of the man from the whole tenor of his language and\r\nconduct. I have stated the above matters, not as inferring a criminal\r\ncharge of evil intention. If I had meant to do so, perhaps they are\r\nstated with tolerable exactness. But I have no such view. The intentions\r\nof these gentlemen may be very pure. I do not dispute it. But I think\r\nthey are in some great error. If these things are done by Mr. Fox and\r\nhis friends with good intentions, they are not done less dangerously;\r\nfor it shows these good intentions are not under the direction of safe\r\nmaxims and principles.\r\n\r\n48. Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, and the gentlemen who call themselves the\r\nPhalanx, have not been so very indulgent to others. They have thought\r\nproper to ascribe to those members of the House of Commons, who, in\r\nexact agreement with the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, abhor\r\nand oppose the French system, the basest and most unworthy motives for\r\ntheir conduct;--as if none could oppose that atheistic, immoral, and\r\nimpolitic project set up in France, so disgraceful and destructive, as I\r\nconceive, to human nature itself, but with some sinister intentions.\r\nThey treat those members on all occasions with a sort of lordly\r\ninsolence, though they are persons that (whatever homage they may pay to\r\nthe eloquence of the gentlemen who choose to look down upon them with\r\nscorn) are not their inferiors in any particular which calls for and\r\nobtains just consideration from the public: not their inferiors in\r\nknowledge of public law, or of the Constitution of the kingdom; not\r\ntheir inferiors in their acquaintance with its foreign and domestic\r\ninterests; not their inferiors in experience or practice of business;\r\nnot their inferiors in moral character; not their inferiors in the\r\nproofs they have given of zeal and industry in the service of their\r\ncountry. Without denying to these gentlemen the respect and\r\nconsideration which it is allowed justly belongs to them, we see no\r\nreason why they should not as well be obliged to defer something to our\r\nopinions as that we should be bound blindly and servilely to follow\r\nthose of Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Lambton,\r\nMr. Whitbread, Mr. Taylor, and others. We are members of Parliament and\r\ntheir equals. We never consider ourselves as their followers. These\r\ngentlemen (some of them hardly born when some of us came into\r\nParliament) have thought proper to treat us as deserters,--as if we had\r\nbeen listed into their phalanx like soldiers, and had sworn to live and\r\ndie in their French principles. This insolent claim of superiority on\r\ntheir part, and of a sort of vassalage to them on that of other members,\r\nis what no liberal mind will submit to bear.\r\n\r\n49. The society of the Liberty of the Press, the Whig Club, and the\r\nSociety for Constitutional Information, and (I believe) the Friends of\r\nthe People, as well as some clubs in Scotland, have, indeed, declared,\r\n\"that their confidence in and attachment to Mr. Fox has lately been\r\nconfirmed, strengthened, and increased by the calumnies\" (as they are\r\ncalled) \"against him.\" It is true, Mr. Fox and his friends have those\r\ntestimonies in their favor, against certain old friends of the Duke of\r\nPortland. Yet, on a full, serious, and, I think, dispassionate\r\nconsideration of the whole of what Mr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan and their\r\nfriends have acted, said, and written, in this session, instead of doing\r\nanything which might tend to procure power, or any share of it\r\nwhatsoever, to them or to their phalanx, (as they call it,) or to\r\nincrease their credit, influence, or popularity in the nation, I think\r\nit one of my most serious and important public duties, in whatsoever\r\nstation I may be placed for the short time I have to live, effectually\r\nto employ my best endeavors, by every prudent and every lawful means, to\r\ntraverse all their designs. I have only to lament that my abilities are\r\nnot greater, and that my probability of life is not better, for the\r\nmore effectual pursuit of that object. But I trust that neither the\r\nprinciples nor exertions will die with me. I am the rather confirmed in\r\nthis my resolution, and in this my wish of transmitting it, because\r\nevery ray of hope concerning a possible control or mitigation of the\r\nenormous mischiefs which the principles of these gentlemen, and which\r\ntheir connections, full as dangerous as their principles, might receive\r\nfrom the influence of the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam, on\r\nbecoming their colleagues in office, is now entirely banished from the\r\nmind of every one living. It is apparent, even to the world at large,\r\nthat, so far from having a power to direct or to guide Mr. Fox, Mr.\r\nSheridan, Mr. Grey, and the rest, in any important matter, they have\r\nnot, through this session, been able to prevail on them to forbear, or\r\nto delay, or mitigate, or soften, any one act, or any one expression,\r\nupon subjects on which they essentially differed.\r\n\r\n50. Even if this hope of a possible control did exist, yet the declared\r\nopinions, and the uniform line of conduct conformable to those opinions,\r\npursued by Mr. Fox, must become a matter of serious alarm, if he should\r\nobtain a power either at court or in Parliament or in the nation at\r\nlarge, and for this plain reason: he must be the most active and\r\nefficient member in any administration of which he shall form a part.\r\nThat a man, or set of men, are guided by such not dubious, but delivered\r\nand avowed principles and maxims of policy, as to need a watch and check\r\non them in the exercise of the highest power, ought, in my opinion, to\r\nmake every man, who is not of the same principles and guided by the\r\nsame maxims, a little cautious how he makes himself one of the\r\ntraverses of a ladder to help such a man, or such a set of men, to climb\r\nup to the highest authority. A minister of this country is to be\r\ncontrolled by the House of Commons. He is to be trusted, not\r\n_controlled_, by his colleagues in office: if he were to be controlled,\r\ngovernment, which ought to be the source of order, would itself become a\r\nscene of anarchy. Besides, Mr. Fox is a man of an aspiring and\r\ncommanding mind, made rather to control than to be controlled, and he\r\nnever will be nor can be in any administration in which he will be\r\nguided by any of those whom I have been accustomed to confide in. It is\r\nabsurd to think that he would or could. If his own opinions do not\r\ncontrol him, nothing can. When we consider of an adherence to a man\r\nwhich leads to his power, we must not only see what the man is, but how\r\nhe stands related. It is not to be forgotten that Mr. Fox acts in close\r\nand inseparable connection with another gentleman of exactly the same\r\ndescription as himself, and who, perhaps, of the two, is the leader. The\r\nrest of the body are not a great deal more tractable; and over them, if\r\nMr. Fox and Mr. Sheridan have authority, most assuredly the Duke of\r\nPortland has not the smallest degree of influence.\r\n\r\n51. One must take care that a blind partiality to some persons, and as\r\nblind an hatred to others, may not enter into our minds under a color of\r\ninflexible public principle. We hear, as a reason for clinging to Mr.\r\nFox at present, that nine years ago Mr. Pitt got into power by\r\nmischievous intrigues with the court, with the Dissenters, and with\r\nother factious people out of Parliament, to the discredit and weakening\r\nof the power of the House of Commons. His conduct nine years ago I still\r\nhold to be very culpable. There are, however, many things very culpable\r\nthat I do not know how to punish. My opinion on such matters I must\r\nsubmit to the good of the state, as I have done on other occasions,--and\r\nparticularly with regard to the authors and managers of the American\r\nwar, with whom I have acted, both in office and in opposition, with\r\ngreat confidence and cordiality, though I thought many of their acts\r\ncriminal and impeachable. Whilst the misconduct of Mr. Pitt and his\r\nassociates was yet recent, it was not possible to get Mr. Fox of himself\r\nto take a single step, or even to countenance others in taking any step,\r\nupon the ground of that misconduct and false policy; though, if the\r\nmatters had been then taken up and pursued, such a step could not have\r\nappeared so evidently desperate as now it is. So far from pursuing Mr.\r\nPitt, I know that then, and for some time after, some of Mr. Fox's\r\nfriends were actually, and with no small earnestness, looking out to a\r\ncoalition with that gentleman. For years I never heard this circumstance\r\nof Mr. Pitt's misconduct on that occasion mentioned by Mr. Fox, either\r\nin public or in private, as a ground for opposition to that minister.\r\nAll opposition, from that period to this very session, has proceeded\r\nupon the separate measures as they separately arose, without any\r\nvindictive retrospect to Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784. My memory, however,\r\nmay fail me. I must appeal to the printed debates, which (so far as Mr.\r\nFox is concerned) are unusually accurate.\r\n\r\n52. Whatever might have been in our power at an early period, at this\r\nday I see no remedy for what was done in 1784. I had no great hopes\r\neven at the time. I was therefore very eager to record a remonstrance on\r\nthe journals of the House of Commons, as a caution against such a\r\npopular delusion in times to come; and this I then feared, and now am\r\ncertain, is all that could be done. I know of no way of animadverting on\r\nthe crown. I know of no mode of calling to account the House of Lords,\r\nwho threw out the India Bill in a way not much to their credit. As\r\nlittle, or rather less, am I able to coerce the people at large, who\r\nbehaved very unwisely and intemperately on that occasion. Mr. Pitt was\r\nthen accused, by me as well as others, of attempting to be minister\r\nwithout enjoying the confidence of the House of Commons, though he did\r\nenjoy the confidence of the crown. That House of Commons, whose\r\nconfidence he did not enjoy, unfortunately did not itself enjoy the\r\nconfidence (though we well deserved it) either of the crown or of the\r\npublic. For want of that confidence, the then House of Commons did not\r\nsurvive the contest. Since that period Mr. Pitt has enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the crown, and of the Lords, and _of the House of\r\nCommons_, through two successive Parliaments; and I suspect that he has\r\never since, and that he does still, enjoy as large a portion, at least,\r\nof the confidence of the people without doors as his great rival. Before\r\nwhom, then, is Mr. Pitt to be impeached, and by whom? The more I\r\nconsider the matter, the more firmly I am convinced that the idea of\r\nproscribing Mr. Pitt _indirectly_, when you cannot _directly punish_\r\nhim, is as chimerical a project, and as unjustifiable, as it would be to\r\nhave proscribed Lord North. For supposing that by indirect ways of\r\nopposition, by opposition upon measures which do not relate to the\r\nbusiness of 1784, but which on other grounds might prove unpopular, you\r\nwere to drive him from his seat, this would be no example whatever of\r\npunishment for the matters we charge as offences in 1784. On a cool and\r\ndispassionate view of the affairs of this time and country, it appears\r\nobvious to me that one or the other of those two great men, that is, Mr.\r\nPitt or Mr. Fox, must be minister. They are, I am sorry for it,\r\nirreconcilable. Mr. Fox's conduct _in this session_ has rendered the\r\nidea of his power a matter of serious alarm to many people who were very\r\nlittle pleased with the proceedings of Mr. Pitt in the beginning of his\r\nadministration. They like neither the conduct of Mr. Pitt in 1784, nor\r\nthat of Mr. Fox in 1793; but they estimate which of the evils is most\r\npressing at the time, and what is likely to be the consequence of a\r\nchange. If Mr. Fox be wedded, they must be sensible that his opinions\r\nand principles on the now existing state of things at home and abroad\r\nmust be taken as his portion. In his train must also be taken the whole\r\nbody of gentlemen who are pledged to him and to each other, and to their\r\ncommon politics and principles. I believe no king of Great Britain ever\r\nwill adopt, for his confidential servants, that body of gentlemen,\r\nholding that body of principles. Even if the present king or his\r\nsuccessor should think fit to take that step, I apprehend a general\r\ndiscontent of those who wish that this nation and that Europe should\r\ncontinue in their present state would ensue,--a discontent which,\r\ncombined with the principles and progress of the new men in power, would\r\nshake this kingdom to its foundations. I do not believe any one\r\npolitical conjecture can be more certain than this.\r\n\r\n53. Without at all defending or palliating Mr. Pitt's conduct in 1784, I\r\nmust observe, that the crisis of 1793, with regard to everything at home\r\nand abroad, is full as important as that of 1784 ever was, and, if for\r\nno other reason, by being present, is much more important. It is not to\r\nnine years ago we are to look for the danger of Mr. Fox's and Mr.\r\nSheridan's conduct, and that of the gentlemen who act with them. It is\r\nat _this_ very time, and in _this_ very session, that, if they had not\r\nbeen strenuously resisted, they would not only have discredited the\r\nHouse of Commons, (as Mr. Pitt did in 1784, when he persuaded the king\r\nto reject their advice, and to appeal from them to the people,) but, in\r\nmy opinion, would have been the means of wholly subverting the House of\r\nCommons and the House of Peers, and the whole Constitution actual and\r\nvirtual, together with the safety and independence of this nation, and\r\nthe peace and settlement of every state in the now Christian world. It\r\nis to our opinion of the nature of Jacobinism, and of the probability,\r\nby corruption, faction, and force, of its gaining ground everywhere,\r\nthat the question whom and what you are to support is to be determined.\r\nFor my part, without doubt or hesitation, I look upon Jacobinism as the\r\nmost dreadful and the most shameful evil which ever afflicted mankind, a\r\nthing which goes beyond the power of all calculation in its\r\nmischief,--and that, if it is suffered to exist in France, we must in\r\nEngland, and speedily too, fall into that calamity.\r\n\r\n54. I figure to myself the purpose of these gentlemen accomplished, and\r\nthis ministry destroyed. I see that the persons who in that case must\r\nrule can be no other than Mr. Fox, Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Grey, the Marquis\r\nof Lansdowne, Lord Thurlow, Lord Lauderdale, and the Duke of Norfolk,\r\nwith the other chiefs of the Friends of the People, the Parliamentary\r\nreformers, and the admirers of the French Revolution. The principal of\r\nthese are all formally pledged to their projects. If the Duke of\r\nPortland and Lord Fitzwilliam should be admitted into that system, (as\r\nthey might and probably would be,) it is quite certain they could not\r\nhave the smallest weight in it,--less, indeed, than what they now\r\npossess, if less were possible: because they would be less wanted than\r\nthey now are; and because all those who wished to join them, and to act\r\nunder them, have been rejected by the Duke of Portland and Lord\r\nFitzwilliam themselves; and Mr. Fox, finding them thus by themselves\r\ndisarmed, has built quite a new fabric, upon quite a new foundation.\r\nThere is no trifling on this subject. We see very distinctly before us\r\nthe ministry that would be formed and the plan that would be pursued. If\r\nwe like the plan, we must wish the power of those who are to carry it\r\ninto execution; but to pursue the political exaltation of those whose\r\npolitical measures we disapprove and whose principles we dissent from is\r\na species of modern politics not easily comprehensible, and which must\r\nend in the ruin of the country, if it should continue and spread. Mr.\r\nPitt may be the worst of men, and Mr. Fox may be the best; but, at\r\npresent, the former is in the interest of his country, and of the order\r\nof things long established in Europe: Mr. Fox is not. I have, for one,\r\nbeen born in this order of things, and would fain die in it. I am sure\r\nit is sufficient to make men as virtuous, as happy, and as knowing as\r\nanything which Mr. Fox, and his friends abroad or at, home, would\r\nsubstitute in its place; and I should be sorry that any set of\r\npoliticians should obtain power in England whose principles or schemes\r\nshould lead them to countenance persons or factions whose object is to\r\nintroduce some new devised order of things into England, or to support\r\nthat order where it is already introduced, in France,--a place in which\r\nif it can be fixed, in my mind, it must have a certain and decided\r\ninfluence in and upon this kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis is my account of my conduct to my private friends. I have already\r\nsaid all I wish to say, or nearly so, to the public. I write this with\r\npain and with an heart full of grief.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It is an exception, that in one of his last speeches (but not\r\nbefore) Mr. Fox seemed to think an alliance with Spain might be proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF M. BRISSOT\r\n\r\nTO HIS CONSTITUENTS.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED BY\r\n\r\nTHE LATE WILLIAM BURKE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO BRISSOT'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution has been the subject of various speculations and\r\nvarious histories. As might be expected, the royalists and the\r\nrepublicans have differed a good deal in their accounts of the\r\nprinciples of that Revolution, of the springs which have set it in\r\nmotion, and of the true character of those who have been, or still are,\r\nthe principal actors on that astonishing scene.\r\n\r\nThey who are inclined to think favorably of that event will undoubtedly\r\nobject to every state of facts which comes only from the authority of a\r\nroyalist. Thus much must be allowed by those who are the most firmly\r\nattached to the cause of religion, law, and order, (for of such, and not\r\nof friends to despotism, the royal party is composed,)--that their very\r\naffection to this generous and manly cause, and their abhorrence of a\r\nRevolution not less fatal to liberty than to government, may possibly\r\nlead them in some particulars to a more harsh representation of the\r\nproceedings of their adversaries than would be allowed by the cold\r\nneutrality of an impartial judge. This sort of error arises from a\r\nsource highly laudable; but the exactness of truth may suffer even from\r\nthe feelings of virtue. History will do justice to the intentions of\r\nworthy men, but it will be on its guard against their infirmities; it\r\nwill examine with great strictness of scrutiny whatever appears from a\r\nwriter in favor of his own cause. On the other hand, whatever escapes\r\nhim, and makes against that cause, comes with the greatest weight.\r\n\r\nIn this important controversy, the translator of the following work\r\nbrings forward to the English tribunal of opinion the testimony of a\r\nwitness beyond all exception. His competence is undoubted. He knows\r\neverything which concerns this Revolution to the bottom. He is a chief\r\nactor in all the scenes which he presents. No man can object to him as a\r\nroyalist: the royal party, and the Christian religion, never had a more\r\ndetermined enemy. In a word, it is BRISSOT. It is Brissot, the\r\nrepublican, the Jacobin, and the philosopher, who is brought to give an\r\naccount of Jacobinism, and of republicanism, and of philosophy.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, that this his account of the genius of\r\nJacobinism and its effects is not confined to the period in which that\r\nfaction came to be divided within itself. In several, and those very\r\nimportant particulars, Brissot's observations apply to the whole of the\r\npreceding period before the great schism, and whilst the Jacobins acted\r\nas one body; insomuch that the far greater part of the proceedings of\r\nthe ruling powers since the commencement of the Revolution in France, so\r\nstrikingly painted, so strongly and so justly reprobated by Brissot,\r\nwere the acts of Brissot himself and his associates. All the members of\r\nthe Girondin subdivision were as deeply concerned as any of the Mountain\r\ncould possibly be, and some of them much more deeply, in those horrid\r\ntransactions which have filled all the thinking part of Europe with the\r\ngreatest detestation, and with the most serious apprehensions for the\r\ncommon liberty and safety.\r\n\r\nA question will very naturally be asked,--What could induce Brissot to\r\ndraw such a picture? He must have been sensible it was his own. The\r\nanswer is,--The inducement was the same with that which led him to\r\npartake in the perpetration of all the crimes the calamitous effects of\r\nwhich he describes with the pen of a master,--ambition. His faction,\r\nhaving obtained their stupendous and unnatural power by rooting out of\r\nthe minds of his unhappy countrymen every principle of religion,\r\nmorality, loyalty, fidelity, and honor, discovered, that, when authority\r\ncame into their hands, it would be a matter of no small difficulty for\r\nthem to carry on government on the principles by which they had\r\ndestroyed it.\r\n\r\nThe rights of men and the new principles of liberty and equality were\r\nvery unhandy instruments for those who wished to establish a system of\r\ntranquillity and order. They who were taught to find nothing to respect\r\nin the title and in the virtues of Louis the Sixteenth, a prince\r\nsucceeding to the throne by the fundamental laws, in the line of a\r\nsuccession of monarchs continued for fourteen hundred years, found\r\nnothing which could bind them to an implicit fidelity and dutiful\r\nallegiance to Messrs. Brissot, Vergniaud, Condorcet, Anacharsis Clootz,\r\nand Thomas Paine.\r\n\r\nIn this difficulty, they did as well as they could. To govern the\r\npeople, they must incline the people to obey. The work was difficult,\r\nbut it was necessary. They were to accomplish it by such materials and\r\nby such instruments as they had in their hands. They were to accomplish\r\nthe purposes of order, morality, and submission to the laws, from the\r\nprinciples of atheism, profligacy, and sedition. Ill as the disguise\r\nbecame them, they began to assume the mask of an austere and rigid\r\nvirtue; they exhausted all the stores of their eloquence (which in some\r\nof them were not inconsiderable) in declamations against tumult and\r\nconfusion; they made daily harangues on the blessings of order,\r\ndiscipline, quiet, and obedience to authority; they even showed some\r\nsort of disposition to protect such property as had not been\r\nconfiscated. They who on every occasion had discovered a sort of furious\r\nthirst of blood and a greedy appetite for slaughter, who avowed and\r\ngloried in the murders and massacres of the 14th of July, of the 5th and\r\n6th of October, and of the 10th of August, now began to be squeamish and\r\nfastidious with regard to those of the 2nd of September.\r\n\r\nIn their pretended scruples on the sequel of the slaughter of the 10th\r\nof August, they imposed upon no living creature, and they obtained not\r\nthe smallest credit for humanity. They endeavored to establish a\r\ndistinction, by the belief of which they hoped to keep the spirit of\r\nmurder safely bottled up and sealed for their own purposes, without\r\nendangering themselves by the fumes of the poison which they prepared\r\nfor their enemies.\r\n\r\nRoland was the chief and the most accredited of the faction. His morals\r\nhad furnished little matter of exception against him. Old, domestic, and\r\nuxorious, he led a private life sufficiently blameless. He was therefore\r\nset up as the _Cato_ of the republican party, which did not abound in\r\nsuch characters.\r\n\r\nThis man, like most of the chiefs, was the manager of a newspaper, in\r\nwhich he promoted the interest of his party. He was a fatal present\r\nmade by the revolutionists to the unhappy king, as one of his ministers\r\nunder the new Constitution. Amongst his colleagues were Clavière and\r\nServan. All the three have since that time either lost their heads by\r\nthe axe of their associates in rebellion, or, to evade their own\r\nrevolutionary justice, have fallen by their own hands.\r\n\r\nThese ministers were regarded by the king as in a conspiracy to dethrone\r\nhim. Nobody who considers the circumstances which preceded the\r\ndeposition of Louis the Sixteenth, nobody who attends to the subsequent\r\nconduct of those ministers, can hesitate about the reality of such a\r\nconspiracy. The king certainly had no doubt of it; he found himself\r\nobliged to remove them; and the necessity, which first obliged him to\r\nchoose such regicide ministers constrained him to replace them by\r\nDumouriez the Jacobin, and some others of little efficiency, though of a\r\nbetter description.\r\n\r\nA little before this removal, and evidently as a part of the conspiracy,\r\nRoland put into the king's hands, as a memorial, the most insolent,\r\nseditious, and atrocious libel that has probably ever been penned. This\r\npaper Roland a few days after delivered to the National Assembly,[2] who\r\ninstantly published and dispersed it over all France; and in order to\r\ngive it the stronger operation, they declared that he and his brother\r\nministers had carried with them the regret of the nation. None of the\r\nwritings which have inflamed the Jacobin spirit to a savage fury ever\r\nworked up a fiercer ferment through the whole mass of the republicans\r\nin every part of France.\r\n\r\nUnder the thin veil of _prediction_, he strongly _recommends_ all the\r\nabominable practices which afterwards followed. In particular, he\r\ninflamed the minds of the populace against the respectable and\r\nconscientious clergy, who became the chief objects of the massacre, and\r\nwho were to him the chief objects of a malignity and rancor that one\r\ncould hardly think to exist in an human heart.\r\n\r\nWe have the relics of his fanatical persecution here. We are in a\r\ncondition to judge of the merits of the persecutors and of the\r\npersecuted: I do not say the accusers and accused; because, in all the\r\nfurious declamations of the atheistic faction against these men, not one\r\nspecific charge has been made upon any one person of those who suffered\r\nin their massacre or by their decree of exile.\r\n\r\nThe king had declared that he would sooner perish under their axe (he\r\ntoo well saw what was preparing for him) than give his sanction to the\r\niniquitous act of proscription under which those innocent people were to\r\nbe transported.\r\n\r\nOn this proscription of the clergy a principal part of the ostensible\r\nquarrel between the king and those ministers had turned. From the time\r\nof the authorized publication of this libel, some of the manoeuvres long\r\nand uniformly pursued for the king's deposition became more and more\r\nevident and declared.\r\n\r\nThe 10th of August came on, and in the manner in which Roland had\r\npredicted: it was followed by the same consequences. The king was\r\ndeposed, after cruel massacres in the courts and the apartments of his\r\npalace and in almost all parts of the city. In reward of his treason to\r\nhis old master, Roland was by his new masters named Minister of the Home\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe massacres of the 2nd of September were begotten by the massacres of\r\nthe 10th of August. They were universally foreseen and hourly expected.\r\nDuring this short interval between the two murderous scenes, the furies,\r\nmale and female, cried out havoc as loudly and as fiercely as ever. The\r\nordinary jails were all filled with prepared victims; and when they\r\noverflowed, churches were turned into jails. At this time the relentless\r\nRoland had the care of the general police;--he had for his colleague the\r\nbloody Danton, who was Minister of Justice; the insidious Pétion was\r\nMayor of Paris; the treacherous Manuel was Procurator of the Common\r\nHall. The magistrates (some or all of them) were evidently the authors\r\nof this massacre. Lest the national guard should, by their very name, be\r\nreminded of their duty in preserving the lives of their fellow-citizens,\r\nthe Common Council of Paris, pretending that it was in vain to think of\r\nresisting the murderers, (although in truth neither their numbers nor\r\ntheir arms were at all formidable,) obliged those guards to draw the\r\ncharges from their muskets, and took away their bayonets. One of their\r\njournalists, and, according to their fashion, one of their leading\r\nstatesmen, Gorsas, mentions this fact in his newspaper, which he\r\nformerly called the Galley Journal. The title was well suited to the\r\npaper and its author. For some felonies he had been sentenced to the\r\ngalleys; but, by the benignity of the late king, this felon (to be one\r\nday advanced to the rank of a regicide) had been pardoned and released\r\nat the intercession of the ambassadors of Tippoo Sultan. His gratitude\r\nwas such as might naturally have been expected; and it has lately been\r\nrewarded as it deserved. This liberated galley-slave was raised, in\r\nmockery of all criminal law, to be Minister of Justice: he became from\r\nhis elevation a more conspicuous object of accusation, and he has since\r\nreceived the punishment of his former crimes in proscription and death.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, how the Minister of the Home Department was employed\r\nat this crisis. The day after the massacre had commenced, Roland\r\nappeared; but not with the powerful apparatus of a protecting\r\nmagistrate, to rescue those who had survived the slaughter of the first\r\nday: nothing of this. On the 3rd of September, (that is, the day after\r\nthe commencement of the massacre,[3]) he writes a long, elaborate,\r\nverbose epistle to the Assembly, in which, after magnifying, according\r\nto the _bon-ton_ of the Revolution, his own integrity, humanity,\r\ncourage, and patriotism, he first directly justifies all the bloody\r\nproceedings of the 10th of August. He considers the slaughter of that\r\nday as a necessary measure for defeating a conspiracy which (with a full\r\nknowledge of the falsehood of his assertion) he asserts to have been\r\nformed for a massacre of the people of Paris, and which he more than\r\ninsinuates was the work of his late unhappy master,--who was universally\r\nknown to carry his dread of shedding the blood of his most guilty\r\nsubjects to an excess.\r\n\r\n\"Without the day of the 10th,\" says he, \"it is evident that we should\r\nhave been lost. The court, prepared for a long time, waited for the\r\nhour which was to accumulate all treasons, to display over Paris the\r\nstandard of death, and to reign there by terror. The sense of the\r\npeople, (_le sentiment_,) always just and ready when their opinion is\r\nnot corrupted, foresaw the epoch marked for their destruction, and\r\nrendered it fatal to the conspirators.\" He then proceeds, in the cant\r\nwhich has been applied to palliate all their atrocities from the 14th of\r\nJuly, 1789, to the present time:--\"It is in the nature of things,\"\r\ncontinues he, \"and in that of the human heart, that victory should bring\r\nwith it _some_ excess. The sea, agitated by a violent storm, roars\r\n_long_ after the tempest; but _everything has bounds_, which ought _at\r\nlength_ to be observed.\"\r\n\r\nIn this memorable epistle, he considers such _excesses_ as fatalities\r\narising from the very nature of things, and consequently not to be\r\npunished. He allows a space of time for the duration of these\r\nagitations; and lest he should be thought rigid and too scanty in his\r\nmeasure, he thinks it may be _long_. But he would have things to cease\r\n_at length_. But when? and where?--When they may approach his own\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\"_Yesterday_,\" says he, \"the ministers _were denounced: vaguely_,\r\nindeed, as to the _matter_, because subjects of reproach were wanting;\r\nbut with that warmth and force of assertion which strike the imagination\r\nand seduce it for a moment, and which mislead and destroy confidence,\r\nwithout which no man should remain in place in a free government.\r\n_Yesterday, again_, in an assembly of the presidents of all the\r\nsections, convoked by the ministers, with the view of conciliating all\r\nminds, and of mutual explanation, I perceived _that distrust which\r\nsuspects, interrogates, and fetters operations_.\"\r\n\r\nIn this manner (that is, in mutual suspicions and interrogatories) this\r\nvirtuous Minister of the Home Department, and all the magistracy of\r\nParis, spent the first day of the massacre, the atrocity of which has\r\nspread horror and alarm throughout Europe. It does not appear that the\r\nputting a stop to the massacre had any part in the object of their\r\nmeeting, or in their consultations when they were met. Here was a\r\nminister tremblingly alive to his own safety, dead to that of his\r\nfellow-citizens, eager to preserve his place, and worse than indifferent\r\nabout its most important duties. Speaking of the people, he says \"that\r\ntheir hidden enemies may make use of this _agitation_\" (the tender\r\nappellation which he gives to horrid massacre) \"to hurt _their best\r\nfriends and their most able defenders. Already the example begins_: let\r\nit restrain and arrest a _just_ rage. Indignation carried to its height\r\ncommences proscriptions which fall only on the _guilty_, but in which\r\nerror and particular passions may shortly involve the _honest man_.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw that the able artificers in the trade and mystery of murder did\r\nnot choose that their skill should be unemployed after their first work,\r\nand that they were full as ready to cut off their rivals as their\r\nenemies. This gave him _one_ alarm that was serious. This letter of\r\nRoland, in every part of it, lets out the secret of all the parties in\r\nthis Revolution. _Plena rimarum est; hoc atque illac perfluit_. We see\r\nthat none of them condemn the occasional practice of murder,--provided\r\nit is properly applied,--provided it is kept within the bounds which\r\neach of those parties think proper to prescribe. In this case Roland\r\nfeared, that, if what was occasionally useful should become habitual,\r\nthe practice might go further than was convenient. It might involve the\r\nbest friends of the last Revolution, as it had done the heroes of the\r\nfirst Revolution: he feared that it would not be confined to the La\r\nFayettes and Clermont-Tonnerres, the Duponts and Barnaves, but that it\r\nmight extend to the Brissots and Vergniauds, to the Condorcets, the\r\nPétions, and to himself. Under this apprehension there is no doubt that\r\nhis humane feelings were altogether unaffected.\r\n\r\nHis observations on the massacre of the preceding day are such as cannot\r\nbe passed over. \"Yesterday,\" said he, \"was a day upon the events of\r\nwhich it is perhaps necessary to leave a _veil_. I know that the people\r\nwith their vengeance _mingled a sort of justice_: they did not take for\r\nvictims _all_ who presented themselves to their fury; they directed it\r\nto _them who had for a long time been spared by the sword of the law_,\r\nand who they _believed_, from the peril of circumstances, should be\r\nsacrificed without delay. But I know that it is easy to _villains and\r\ntraitors_ to misrepresent this _effervescence_, and that it must be\r\nchecked; I know that we owe to all France the declaration, that the\r\n_executive power_ could not foresee or prevent this excess; I know that\r\nit is due to the constituted authorities to place a limit to it, or\r\nconsider themselves as abolished.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this carnage he thinks of nothing but throwing a veil\r\nover it,--which was at once to cover the guilty from punishment, and to\r\nextinguish all compassion for the sufferers. He apologizes for it; in\r\nfact, he justifies it. He who (as the reader has just seen in what is\r\nquoted from this letter) feels so much indignation at \"vague\r\ndenunciations,\" when made against himself, and from which he then feared\r\nnothing more than the subversion of his power, is not ashamed to\r\nconsider the charge of a conspiracy to massacre the Parisians, brought\r\nagainst his master upon denunciations as vague as possible, or rather\r\nupon no denunciations, as a perfect justification of the monstrous\r\nproceedings against him. He is not ashamed to call the murder of the\r\nunhappy priests in the Carmes, who were under no criminal denunciation\r\nwhatsoever, a \"_vengeance_ mingled with a _sort of justice_\"; he\r\nobserves that they \"had been a long time spared by the sword of the\r\nlaw,\" and calls by anticipation all those who should represent this\r\n\"_effervescence_\" in other colors _villains and traitors_: he did not\r\nthan foresee how soon himself and his accomplices would be under the\r\nnecessity of assuming the pretended character of this new sort of\r\n\"_villany and treason_\", in the hope of obliterating the memory of their\r\nformer real _villanies and treasons_; he did not foresee that in the\r\ncourse of six months a formal manifesto on the part of himself and his\r\nfaction, written by his confederate Brissot, was to represent this\r\n\"_effervescence_\" as another \"_St. Bartholomew_\" and speak of it as\r\n\"_having made humanity shudder, and sullied the Revolution forever_.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that he takes upon himself to know the motives of\r\nthe assassins, their policy, and even what they \"believed.\" How could\r\nthis be, if he had no connection with them? He praises the murderers for\r\nnot having taken as yet _all_ the lives of those who had, as he calls\r\nit, \"_presented themselves_ as victims to their fury.\" He paints the\r\nmiserable prisoners, who had been forcibly piled upon one another in\r\nthe Church of the Carmelites by his faction, as _presenting themselves_\r\nas victims to their fury,--as if death was their choice, or (allowing\r\nthe idiom of his language to make this equivocal) as if they were by\r\nsome accident _presented_ to the fury of their assassins: whereas he\r\nknew that the leaders of the murderers sought these pure and innocent\r\nvictims in the places where they had deposited them and were sure to\r\nfind them. The very selection, which he praises as a _sort of justice_\r\ntempering their fury, proves beyond a doubt the foresight, deliberation,\r\nand method with which this massacre was made. He knew that circumstance\r\non the very day of the commencement of the massacres, when, in all\r\nprobability, he had begun this letter,--for he presented it to the\r\nAssembly on the very next.\r\n\r\nWhilst, however, he defends these acts, he is conscious that they will\r\nappear in another light to the world. He therefore acquits the executive\r\npower, that is, he acquits himself, (but only by his own assertion,) of\r\nthose acts of \"_vengeance mixed with a sort of justice_,\" as an\r\n\"_excess_ which he could neither foresee nor prevent.\" He could not, he\r\nsays, foresee these acts, when he tells us the people of Paris had\r\nsagacity so well to foresee the designs of the court on the 10th of\r\nAugust,--to foresee them so well as to mark the precise epoch on which\r\nthey were to be executed, and to contrive to anticipate them on the very\r\nday: he could not foresee these events, though he declares in this very\r\nletter that victory _must_ bring with it some _excess_,--that \"the sea\r\nroars _long_ after the tempest.\" So far as to his foresight. As to his\r\ndisposition to prevent, if he had foreseen, the massacres of that\r\nday,--this will be judged by his care in putting a stop to the massacre\r\nthen going on. This was no matter of foresight: he was in the very midst\r\nof it. He does not so much as pretend that he had used any force to put\r\na stop to it. But if he had used any, the sanction given under his hand\r\nto a sort of justice in the murderers was enough to disarm the\r\nprotecting force.\r\n\r\nThat approbation of what they had already done had its natural effect on\r\nthe executive assassins, then in the paroxysm of their fury, as well as\r\non their employers, then in the midst of the execution of their\r\ndeliberate, cold-blooded system of murder. He did not at all differ from\r\neither of them in the principle of those executions, but only in the\r\ntime of their duration,--and that only as it affected himself. This,\r\nthough to him a great consideration, was none to his confederates, who\r\nwere at the same time his rivals. They were encouraged to accomplish the\r\nwork they had in hand. They did accomplish it; and whilst this grave\r\nmoral epistle from a grave minister, recommending a cessation of their\r\nwork of \"vengeance mingled with a sort of justice,\" was before a grave\r\nassembly, the authors of the massacres proceeded without interruption in\r\ntheir business for four days together,--that is, until the seventh of\r\nthat month, and until all the victims of the first proscription in Paris\r\nand at Versailles and several other places were immolated at the shrine\r\nof the grim Moloch of liberty and equality. All the priests, all the\r\nloyalists, all the first essayists and novices of revolution in 1789,\r\nthat could be found, were promiscuously put to death.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of this long letter of Roland, it is curious to remark\r\nhow the nerve and vigor of his style, which had spoken so potently to\r\nhis sovereign, is relaxed when he addresses himself to the\r\n_sans-culottes,_--how that strength and dexterity of arm, with which he\r\nparries and beats down the sceptre, is enfeebled and lost when he comes\r\nto fence with the poniard. When he speaks to the populace, he can no\r\nlonger be direct. The whole compass of the language is tried to find\r\nsynonymes and circumlocutions for massacre and murder. Things are never\r\ncalled by their common names. Massacre is sometimes _agitation_,\r\nsometimes _effervescence_, sometimes _excess_, sometimes too continued\r\nan exercise of a _revolutionary power_.\r\n\r\nHowever, after what had passed had been praised, or excused, or\r\npardoned, he declares loudly against such proceedings _in future_.\r\nCrimes had pioneered and made smooth the way for the march of the\r\nvirtues, and from that time order and justice and a sacred regard for\r\npersonal property were to become the rules for the new democracy. Here\r\nRoland and the Brissotins leagued for their own preservation, by\r\nendeavoring to preserve peace. This short story will render many of the\r\nparts of Brissot's pamphlet, in which Roland's views and intentions are\r\nso often alluded to, the more intelligible in themselves, and the more\r\nuseful in their application by the English reader.\r\n\r\nUnder the cover of these artifices, Roland, Brissot, and their party\r\nhoped to gain the bankers, merchants, substantial tradesmen, hoarders of\r\nassignats, and purchasers of the confiscated lands of the clergy and\r\ngentry to join with their party, as holding out some sort of security to\r\nthe effects which they possessed, whether these effects were the\r\nacquisitions of fair commerce, or the gains of jobbing in the\r\nmisfortunes of their country and the plunder of their fellow-citizens.\r\nIn this design the party of Roland and Brissot succeeded in a great\r\ndegree. They obtained a majority in the National Convention. Composed,\r\nhowever, as that assembly is, their majority was far from steady. But\r\nwhilst they appeared to gain the Convention, and many of the outlying\r\ndepartments, they lost the city of Paris entirely and irrecoverably: it\r\nwas fallen into the hands of Marat, Robespierre, and Danton. Their\r\ninstruments were the _sans-culottes_, or rabble, who domineered in that\r\ncapital, and were wholly at the devotion of those incendiaries, and\r\nreceived their daily pay. The people of property were of no consequence,\r\nand trembled before Marat and his janizaries. As that great man had not\r\nobtained the helm of the state, it was not yet come to his turn to act\r\nthe part of Brissot and his friends in the assertion of subordination\r\nand regular government. But Robespierre has survived both these rival\r\nchiefs, and is now the great patron of Jacobin order.\r\n\r\nTo balance the exorbitant power of Paris, (which threatened to leave\r\nnothing to the National Convention but a character as insignificant as\r\nthat which the first Assembly had assigned to the unhappy Louis the\r\nSixteenth,) the faction of Brissot, whose leaders were Roland, Pétion,\r\nVergniaud, Isnard, Condorcet, &c., &c., &c., applied themselves to gain\r\nthe great commercial towns, Lyons, Marseilles, Rouen, Nantes, and\r\nBordeaux. The republicans of the Brissotin description, to whom the\r\nconcealed royalists, still very numerous, joined themselves, obtained a\r\ntemporary superiority in all these places. In Bordeaux, on account of\r\nthe activity and eloquence of some of its representatives, this\r\nsuperiority was the most distinguished. This last city is seated on the\r\nGaronne, or Gironde; and being the centre of a department named from\r\nthat river, the appellation of Girondists was given to the whole party.\r\nThese, and some other towns, declared strongly against the principles of\r\nanarchy, and against the despotism of Paris. Numerous addresses were\r\nsent to the Convention, promising to maintain its authority, which the\r\naddressers were pleased to consider as legal and constitutional, though\r\nchosen, not to compose an executive government, but to form a plan for a\r\nConstitution. In the Convention measures were taken to obtain an armed\r\nforce from the several departments to maintain the freedom of that body,\r\nand to provide for the personal safety of the members: neither of which,\r\nfrom the 14th of July, 1789, to this hour, have been really enjoyed by\r\ntheir assemblies sitting under any denomination.\r\n\r\nThis scheme, which was well conceived, had not the desired success.\r\nParis, from which the Convention did not dare to move, though some\r\nthreats of such a departure were from time to time thrown out, was too\r\npowerful for the party of the Gironde. Some of the proposed guards, but\r\nneither with regularity nor in force, did indeed arrive: they were\r\ndebauched as fast as they came, or were sent to the frontiers. The game\r\nplayed by the revolutionists in 1789, with respect to the French guards\r\nof the unhappy king, was now played against the departmental guards,\r\ncalled together for the protection of the revolutionists. Every part of\r\ntheir own policy comes round, and strikes at their own power and their\r\nown lives.\r\n\r\nThe Parisians, on their part, were not slow in taking the alarm. They\r\nhad just reason to apprehend, that, if they permitted the smallest\r\ndelay, they should see themselves besieged by an army collected from all\r\nparts of France. Violent threats were thrown out against that city in\r\nthe Assembly. Its total destruction was menaced. A very remarkable\r\nexpression was used in these debates,--\"that in future times it might be\r\ninquired on what part of the Seine Paris had stood.\" The faction which\r\nruled in Paris, too bold to be intimidated and too vigilant to be\r\nsurprised, instantly armed themselves. In their turn, they accused the\r\nGirondists of a treasonable design to break _the republic one and\r\nindivisible_ (whose unity they contended could only be preserved by the\r\nsupremacy of Paris) into a number of _confederate_ commonwealths. The\r\nGirondin faction on this account received also the name of\r\n_Federalists_.\r\n\r\nThings on both sides hastened fast to extremities. Paris, the mother of\r\nequality, was herself to be equalized. Matters were come to this\r\nalternative: either that city must be reduced to a mere member of the\r\nfederative republic, or the Convention, chosen, as they said, by all\r\nFrance, was to be brought regularly and systematically under the\r\ndominion of the Common Hall, and even of any one of the sections of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nIn this awful contest, thus brought to issue, the great mother club of\r\nthe Jacobins was entirely in the Parisian interest. The Girondins no\r\nlonger dared to show their faces in that assembly. Nine tenths at least\r\nof the Jacobin clubs, throughout France, adhered to the great\r\npatriarchal Jacobinière of Paris, to which they were (to use their own\r\nterm) _affiliated_. No authority of magistracy, judicial or executive,\r\nhad the least weight, whenever these clubs chose to interfere: and they\r\nchose to interfere in everything, and on every occasion. All hope of\r\ngaining them to the support of property, or to the acknowledgment of any\r\nlaw but their own will, was evidently vain and hopeless. Nothing but an\r\narmed insurrection against their anarchical authority could answer the\r\npurpose of the Girondins. Anarchy was to be cured by rebellion, as it\r\nhad been caused by it.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to this attempt on the Jacobins and the commons of\r\nParis, which it was hoped would be supported by all the remaining\r\nproperty of France, it became absolutely necessary to prepare a\r\nmanifesto, laying before the public the whole policy, genius, character,\r\nand conduct of the partisans of club government. To make this exposition\r\nas fully and clearly as it ought to be made, it was of the same\r\nunavoidable necessity to go through a series of transactions, in which\r\nall those concerned in this Revolution were, at the several periods of\r\ntheir activity, deeply involved. In consequence of this design, and\r\nunder these difficulties, Brissot prepared the following declaration of\r\nhis party, which he executed with no small ability; and in this manner\r\nthe whole mystery of the French Revolution was laid open in all its\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to mention to the reader the fate of the design to\r\nwhich this pamphlet was to be subservient. The Jacobins of Paris were\r\nmore prompt than their adversaries. They were the readiest to resort to\r\nwhat La Fayette calls the _most sacred of all duties, that of\r\ninsurrection_. Another era of holy insurrection commenced the 31st of\r\nlast May. As the first fruits of that insurrection grafted on\r\ninsurrection, and of that rebellion improving upon rebellion, the\r\nsacred, irresponsible character of the members of the Convention was\r\nlaughed to scorn. They had themselves shown in their proceedings against\r\nthe late king how little the most fixed principles are to be relied\r\nupon, in their revolutionary Constitution. The members of the Girondin\r\nparty in the Convention were seized upon, or obliged to save themselves\r\nby flight. The unhappy author of this piece, with twenty of his\r\nassociates, suffered together on the scaffold, after a trial the\r\niniquity of which puts all description to defiance.\r\n\r\nThe English reader will draw from this work of Brissot, and from the\r\nresult of the last struggles of this party, some useful lessons. He will\r\nbe enabled to judge of the information of those who have undertaken to\r\nguide and enlighten us, and who, for reasons best known to themselves,\r\nhave chosen to paint the French Revolution and its consequences in\r\nbrilliant and flattering colors. They will know how to appreciate the\r\nliberty of France, which has been so much magnified in England. They\r\nwill do justice to the wisdom and goodness of their sovereign and his\r\nParliament, who have put them into a state of defence, in the war\r\naudaciously made upon us in favor of that kind of liberty. When we see\r\n(as here we must see) in their true colors the character and policy of\r\nour enemies, our gratitude will become an active principle. It will\r\nproduce a strong and zealous coöperation with the efforts of our\r\ngovernment in favor of a Constitution under which we enjoy advantages\r\nthe full value of which the querulous weakness of human nature requires\r\nsometimes the opportunity of a comparison to understand and to relish.\r\n\r\nOur confidence in those who watch for the public will not be lessened.\r\nWe shall be sensible that to alarm us in the late circumstances of our\r\naffairs was not for our molestation, but for our security. We shall be\r\nsensible that this alarm was not ill-timed,--and that it ought to have\r\nbeen given, as it was given, before the enemy had time fully to mature\r\nand accomplish their plans for reducing us to the condition of France,\r\nas that condition is faithfully and without exaggeration described in\r\nthe following work. We now have our arms in our hands; we have the means\r\nof opposing the sense, the courage, and the resources of England to the\r\ndeepest, the most craftily devised, the best combined, and the most\r\nextensive design that ever was carried on, since the beginning of the\r\nworld, against all property, all order, all religion, all law, and all\r\nreal freedom.\r\n\r\nThe reader is requested to attend to the part of this pamphlet which\r\nrelates to the conduct of the Jacobins with regard to the Austrian\r\nNetherlands, which they call Belgia or Belgium. It is from page\r\nseventy-two to page eighty-four of this translation. Here their views\r\nand designs upon all their neighbors are fully displayed. Here the whole\r\nmystery of their ferocious politics is laid open with the utmost\r\nclearness. Here the manner in which they would treat every nation into\r\nwhich they could introduce their doctrines and influence is distinctly\r\nmarked. We see that no nation was out of danger, and we see what the\r\ndanger was with which every nation was threatened. The writer of this\r\npamphlet throws the blame of several of the most violent of the\r\nproceedings on the other party. He and his friends, at the time alluded\r\nto, had a majority in the National Assembly. He admits that neither he\r\nnor they _ever publicly_ opposed these measures; but he attributes their\r\nsilence to a fear of rendering themselves suspected. It is most certain,\r\nthat, whether from fear or from approbation, they never discovered any\r\ndislike of those proceedings till Dumouriez was driven from the\r\nNetherlands. But whatever their motive was, it is plain that the most\r\nviolent is, and since the Revolution has always been, the predominant\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIf Europe could not be saved without our interposition, (most certainly\r\nit could not,) I am sure there is not an Englishman who would not blush\r\nto be left out of the general effort made in favor of the general\r\nsafety. But we are not secondary parties in this war; _we are principals\r\nin the danger, and ought to be principals in the exertion_. If any\r\nEnglishman asks whether the designs of the French assassins are confined\r\nto the spot of Europe which they actually desolate, the citizen Brissot,\r\nthe author of this book, and the author of the declaration of war\r\nagainst England, will give him his answer. He will find in this book,\r\nthat the republicans are divided into factions full of the most furious\r\nand destructive animosity against each other; but he will find also that\r\nthere is one point in which they perfectly agree: that they are all\r\nenemies alike to the government of all other nations, and only contend\r\nwith each other about the means of propagating their tenets and\r\nextending their empire by conquest.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in this present work, which the author professedly\r\ndesigned for an appeal to foreign nations and posterity, he has dressed\r\nup the philosophy of his own faction in as decent a garb as he could to\r\nmake her appearance in public; but through every disguise her hideous\r\nfigure may be distinctly seen. If, however, the reader still wishes to\r\nsee her in all her naked deformity, I would further refer him to a\r\nprivate letter of Brissot, written towards the end of the last year, and\r\nquoted in a late very able pamphlet of Mallet Du Pan. \"We must\" (says\r\nour philosopher) \"_set fire to the four corners of Europe_\"; in that\r\nalone is our safety. \"_Dumouriez cannot suit us_. I always distrusted\r\nhim. Miranda is the general for us: he understands the _revolutionary\r\npower_; he has _courage, lights_,\" &c.[5] Here everything is fairly\r\navowed in plain language. The triumph of philosophy is the universal\r\nconflagration of Europe; the only real dissatisfaction with Dumouriez is\r\na suspicion of his moderation; and the secret motive of that preference\r\nwhich in this very pamphlet the author gives to Miranda, though without\r\nassigning his reasons, is declared to be the superior fitness of that\r\nforeign adventurer for the purposes of subversion and destruction. On\r\nthe other hand, if there can be any man in this country so hardy as to\r\nundertake the defence or the apology of the present monstrous usurpers\r\nof France, and if it should be said in their favor, that it is not just\r\nto credit the charges of their enemy Brissot against them, who have\r\nactually tried and condemned him on the very same charges among others,\r\nwe are luckily supplied with the best possible evidence in support of\r\nthis part of his book against them: it comes from among themselves.\r\nCamille Desmoulins published the History of the Brissotins in answer to\r\nthis very address of Brissot. It was the counter-manifesto of the last\r\nholy revolution of the 31st of May; and the flagitious orthodoxy of his\r\nwritings at that period has been admitted in the late scrutiny of him by\r\nthe Jacobin Club, when they saved him from that guillotine \"which he\r\ngrazed.\" In the beginning of his work he displays \"the task of glory,\"\r\nas he calls it, which presented itself at the opening of the Convention.\r\nAll is summed up in two points: \"To create the French Republic; _to\r\ndisorganize Europe; perhaps to purge it of its tyrants by the eruption\r\nof the volcanic principles of equality_.\"[6] The coincidence is exact;\r\nthe proof is complete and irresistible.\r\n\r\nIn a cause like this, and in a time like the present, there is no\r\nneutrality. They who are not actively, and with decision and energy,\r\nagainst Jacobinism are its partisans. They who do not dread it love it.\r\nIt cannot be viewed with indifference. It is a thing made to produce a\r\npowerful impression on the feelings. Such is the nature of Jacobinism,\r\nsuch is the nature of man, that this system must be regarded either with\r\nenthusiastic admiration, or with the highest degree of detestation,\r\nresentment, and horror.\r\n\r\nAnother great lesson may be taught by this book, and by the fortune of\r\nthe author and his party: I mean a lesson drawn from the consequences of\r\nengaging in daring innovations from an hope that we may be able to limit\r\ntheir mischievous operation at our pleasure, and by our policy to secure\r\nourselves against the effect of the evil examples we hold out to the\r\nworld. This lesson is taught through almost all the important pages of\r\nhistory; but never has it been taught so clearly and so awfully as at\r\nthis hour. The revolutionists who have just suffered an ignominious\r\ndeath, under the sentence of the revolutionary tribunal, (a tribunal\r\ncomposed of those with whom they had triumphed in the total destruction\r\nof the ancient government,) were by no means ordinary men, or without\r\nvery considerable talents and resources. But with all their talents and\r\nresources, and the apparent momentary extent of their power, we see the\r\nfate of their projects, their power, and their persons. We see before\r\nour eyes the absurdity of thinking to establish order upon principles of\r\nconfusion, or with the materials and instruments of rebellion to build\r\nup a solid and stable government.\r\n\r\nSuch partisans of a republic amongst us as may not have the worst\r\nintentions will see that the principles, the plans, the manners, the\r\nmorals, and the whole system of France is altogether as adverse to the\r\nformation and duration of any rational scheme of a republic as it is to\r\nthat of a monarchy, absolute or limited. It is, indeed, a system which\r\ncan only answer the purposes of robbers and murderers.\r\n\r\nThe translator has only to say for himself, that he has found some\r\ndifficulty in this version. His original author, through haste, perhaps,\r\nor through the perturbation of a mind filled with a great and arduous\r\nenterprise, is often obscure. There are some passages, too, in which his\r\nlanguage requires to be first translated into French,--at least into\r\nsuch French as the Academy would in former times have tolerated. He\r\nwrites with great force and vivacity; but the language, like everything\r\nelse in his country, has undergone a revolution. The translator thought\r\nit best to be as literal as possible, conceiving such a translation\r\nwould perhaps be the most fit to convey the author's peculiar mode of\r\nthinking. In this way the translator has no credit for style, but he\r\nmakes it up in fidelity. Indeed, the facts and observations are so much\r\nmore important than the style, that no apology is wanted for producing\r\nthem in any intelligible manner.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Presented to the king June 13; delivered to him the preceding\r\nMonday.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[3] Letter to the National Assembly, signed, _The Minister of the\r\nInterior_, ROLAND; dated Paris, Sept. 3rd, _4th year of Liberty_.\r\n\r\n[4] See p. 12 and p. 13 of this translation.\r\n\r\n[5] See the translation of Mallet Du Pan's work, printed for Owen, p.\r\n53.\r\n\r\n[6] See the translation of the History of the Brissotins by Camille\r\nDesmoulins, printed for Owen, p. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n [The Address of M. Brissot to his Constituents being now almost\r\n forgotten, it has been thought right to add, as an Appendix,\r\n that part of it to which Mr. Burke points our particular\r\n attention and upon which he so forcibly comments in his\r\n Preface.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThree sorts of anarchy have ruined our affairs in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe anarchy of the administration of Pache, which has completely\r\ndisorganized the supply of our armies; which by that disorganization\r\nreduced the army of Dumouriez to stop in the middle of its conquests;\r\nwhich struck it motionless through the months of November and December;\r\nwhich hindered it from joining Beurnonville and Custine, and from\r\nforcing the Prussians and Austrians to repass the Rhine, and afterwards\r\nfrom putting themselves in a condition to invade Holland sooner than\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\nTo this state of ministerial anarchy it is necessary to join that other\r\nanarchy which disorganized the troops, and occasioned their habits of\r\npillage; and lastly, that anarchy which created the revolutionary power,\r\nand forced the union to France of the countries we had invaded, before\r\nthings were ripe for such a measure.\r\n\r\nWho could, however, doubt the frightful evils that were occasioned in\r\nour armies by that doctrine of anarchy which, under the shadow of\r\nequality of _right_, would establish equality of fact? This is universal\r\nequality, the scourge of society, as the other is the support of\r\nsociety: an anarchical doctrine which would level all things, talents\r\nand ignorance, virtues and vices, places, usages, and services; a\r\ndoctrine which begot that fatal project of organizing the army,\r\npresented by Dubois de Crancé, to which it will be indebted for a\r\ncomplete disorganization.\r\n\r\nMark the date of the presentation of the system of this equality of\r\nfact, entire equality. It had been projected and decreed even at the\r\nvery opening of the Dutch campaign. If any project could encourage the\r\nwant of discipline in the soldiers, any scheme could disgust and banish\r\ngood officers, and throw all things into confusion at the moment when\r\norder alone could give victory, it is this project, in truth, so\r\nstubbornly defended by the anarchists, and transplanted into their\r\nordinary tactic.\r\n\r\nHow could they expect that there should exist any discipline, any\r\nsubordination, when even in the camp they permit motions, censures, and\r\ndenunciations of officers and of generals? Does not such a disorder\r\ndestroy all the respect that is due to superiors, and all the mutual\r\nconfidence without which success cannot be hoped for? For the spirit of\r\ndistrust makes the soldier suspicious, and intimidates the general. The\r\nfirst discerns treason in every danger; the second, always placed\r\nbetween the necessity of conquest and the image of the scaffold, dares\r\nnot raise himself to bold conception, and those heights of courage which\r\nelectrify an army and insure victory. Turenne, in our time, would have\r\ncarried his head to the scaffold; for he was sometimes beat: but the\r\nreason why he more frequently conquered was, that his discipline was\r\nsevere; it was, that his soldiers, confiding in his talents, never\r\nmuttered discontent instead of fighting. Without reciprocal confidence\r\nbetween the soldier and the general, there can be no army, no victory,\r\nespecially in a free government.\r\n\r\nIs it not to the same system of anarchy, of equalization, and want of\r\nsubordination, which has been recommended in some clubs and defended\r\neven in the Convention, that we owe the pillages, the murders, the\r\nenormities of all kinds, which it was difficult for the officers to put\r\na stop to, from the general spirit of insubordination,--excesses which\r\nhave rendered the French name odious to the Belgians? Again, is it not\r\nto this system of anarchy, and of robbery, that we are indebted for the\r\n_revolutionary power_, which has so justly aggravated the hatred of the\r\nBelgians against France?\r\n\r\nWhat did enlightened republicans think before the 10th of August, men\r\nwho wished for liberty, _not only for their own country, but for all\r\nEurope? They believed that they could generally establish it by exciting\r\nthe governed against the governors, in letting the people see the\r\nfacility and the advantages of such insurrections_.\r\n\r\nBut how can the people be led to that point? By the example of good\r\ngovernment established among us; by the example of order; by the care of\r\nspreading nothing but moral ideas among them: to respect their\r\nproperties and their rights; to respect their prejudices, even when we\r\ncombat them: by disinterestedness in defending the people; by a zeal to\r\nextend the spirit of liberty amongst them.\r\n\r\nThis system was at first followed.[7] Excellent pamphlets from the pen\r\nof Condorcet prepared the people for liberty; the 10th of August, the\r\nrepublican decrees, the battle of Valmy, the retreat of the Prussians,\r\nthe victory of Jemappes, all spoke in favor of France: all was rapidly\r\ndestroyed by _the revolutionary power_. Without doubt, good intentions\r\nmade the majority of the Assembly adopt it; they would plant the tree of\r\nliberty in a foreign soil, under the shade of a people already free. To\r\nthe eyes of the people of Belgium it seemed but the mask of a new\r\nforeign tyranny. This opinion was erroneous; I will suppose it so for a\r\nmoment; but still this opinion of Belgium deserved to be considered. In\r\ngeneral, we have always considered our own opinions and our own\r\nintentions rather than the people whose cause we defend. We have given\r\nthose people a will: that is to say, we have more than ever alienated\r\nthem from liberty.\r\n\r\nHow could the Belgic people believe themselves free, since we exercise\r\nfor them, and over them, the rights of sovereignty,--when, without\r\nconsulting them, we suppress, all in a mass, their ancient usages, their\r\nabuses, their prejudices, those classes of society which without doubt\r\nare contrary to the spirit of liberty, but the utility of whose\r\ndestruction was not as yet proved to them? How could they believe\r\nthemselves free and sovereign, when we made them take such an oath as we\r\nthought fit, as a test to give them the right of voting? How could they\r\nbelieve themselves free, when openly despising their religious worship,\r\nwhich religious worship that superstitious people valued beyond their\r\nliberty, beyond even their life; when we proscribed their priests; when\r\nwe banished them from their assemblies, where they were in the practice\r\nof seeing them govern; when we seized their revenues, their domains, and\r\nriches, to the profit of the nation; when we carried to the very censer\r\nthose hands which they regarded as profane? Doubtless these operations\r\nwere founded on principles; but those principles ought to have had the\r\nconsent of the Belgians, before they were carried into practice;\r\notherwise they necessarily became our most cruel enemies.\r\n\r\nArrived ourselves at the last bounds of liberty and equality, trampling\r\nunder our feet all human superstitions, (after, however, a four years'\r\nwar with them,) we attempt all at once to raise to the same eminence\r\nmen, strangers even to the first elementary principles of liberty, and\r\nplunged for fifteen hundred years in ignorance and superstition; we\r\nwished to force men to see, when a thick cataract covered their eyes,\r\neven before we had removed that cataract; we would force men to see,\r\nwhose dulness of character had raised a mist before their eyes, and\r\nbefore that character was altered.[8]\r\n\r\nDo you believe that the doctrine which now prevails in France would have\r\nfound many partisans among us in 1789? No: a revolution in ideas and in\r\nprejudices is not made with that rapidity; it moves gradually; it does\r\nnot escalade.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy does not inspire by violence, nor by seduction; nor is it the\r\nsword that begets love of liberty.\r\n\r\nJoseph the Second also borrowed the language of philosophy, when he\r\nwished to suppress the monks in Belgium, and to seize upon their\r\nrevenues. There was seen on him a mask only of philosophy, covering the\r\nhideous countenance of a greedy despot; and the people ran to arms.\r\nNothing better than another kind of despotism has been seen in the\r\n_revolutionary power_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the commissioners of the National Convention nothing but\r\nproconsuls working the mine of Belgium for the profit of the French\r\nnation, seeking to conquer it for the sovereign of Paris,--either to\r\naggrandize his empire, or to share the burdens of the debts, and furnish\r\na rich prize to the robbers who domineered in France.\r\n\r\nDo you believe the Belgians have ever been the dupes of those\r\nwell-rounded periods which they vended in the pulpit in order to\r\nfamiliarize them to the idea of an union with France? Do you believe\r\nthey were ever imposed upon by those votes and resolutions, made by what\r\nis called acclamation, for their union, of which corruption paid one\r\npart,[9] and fear forced the remainder? Who, at this time of day, is\r\nunacquainted with the springs and wires of their miserable puppet-show?\r\n_Who does not know the farces of primary assemblies, composed of a\r\npresident, of a secretary, and of some assistants, whose day's work was\r\npaid for?_ No: it is not by means which belong only to thieves and\r\ndespots that the foundations of liberty can be laid in an enslaved\r\ncountry. It is not by those means, that a new-born republic, a people\r\nwho know not yet the elements of republican governments, can be united\r\nto us. Even slaves do not suffer themselves to be seduced by such\r\nartifices; and if they have not the strength to resist, they have at\r\nleast the sense to know how to appreciate the value of such an attempt.\r\n\r\nIf we would attach the Belgians to us, we must at least enlighten their\r\nminds by _good writings_; we must send to them _missionaries_, and not\r\ndespotic commissioners.[10] We ought to give them time to see,--to\r\nperceive by themselves the advantages of liberty, the unhappy effects of\r\nsuperstition, the fatal spirit of priesthood. And whilst we waited for\r\nthis moral revolution, we should have accepted the offers which they\r\nincessantly repeated to join to the French army an army of fifty\r\nthousand men, to entertain them at their own expense, and to advance to\r\nFrance the specie of which she stood in need.\r\n\r\nBut have we ever seen those fifty thousand soldiers who were to join our\r\narmy as soon as the standard of liberty should be displayed in Belgium?\r\nHave we ever seen those treasures which they were to count into our\r\nhands? Can we either accuse the sterility of their country, or the\r\npenury of their treasure, or the coldness of their love for liberty? No!\r\ndespotism and anarchy, these are the benefits which we have transplanted\r\ninto their soil. We have acted, we have spoken, like masters; and from\r\nthat time we have found the Flemings nothing but jugglers, who made the\r\ngrimace of liberty for money, or slaves, who in their hearts cursed\r\ntheir new tyrants. Our commissioners address them in this sort: \"You\r\nhave nobles and priests among you: drive them out without delay, or we\r\nwill neither be your brethren nor your patrons.\" They answered: \"Give us\r\nbut time; only leave to us the care of reforming these institutions.\"\r\nOur answer to them was: \"No! it must be at the moment, it must be on the\r\nspot; or we will treat you as enemies, we will abandon you to the\r\nresentment of the Austrians.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could the disarmed Belgians object to all this, surrounded as they\r\nwere by seventy thousand men? They had only to hold their tongues, and\r\nto bow down their heads before their masters. They did hold their\r\ntongues, and their silence is received as a sincere and free assent.\r\n\r\nHave not the strangest artifices been adopted to prevent that people\r\nfrom retreating, and to constrain them to an union? It was foreseen,\r\nthat, as long as they were unable to effect an union, the States would\r\npreserve the supreme authority amongst themselves. Under pretence,\r\ntherefore, of relieving the people, and of exercising the sovereignty in\r\ntheir right, at one stroke they abolished all the duties and taxes, they\r\nshut up all the treasuries. From that time no more receipts, no more\r\npublic money, no more means of paying the salaries of any man in office\r\nappointed by the States. Thus was anarchy organized amongst the people,\r\nthat they might be compelled to throw themselves into our arms. It\r\nbecame necessary for those who administered their affairs, under the\r\npenalty of being exposed to sedition, and in order to avoid their\r\nthroats being cut, to have recourse to the treasury of France. What did\r\nthey find in this treasury? ASSIGNATS.--These assignats were advanced at\r\npar to Belgium. By this means, on the one hand, they naturalized this\r\ncurrency in that country, and on the other, they expected to make a good\r\npecuniary transaction. Thus it is that covetousness cut its throat with\r\nits own hands. _The Belgians have seen in this forced introduction of\r\nassignats nothing but a double robbery_; and they have only the more\r\nviolently hated the union with France.\r\n\r\nRecollect the solicitude of the Belgians on that subject. With what\r\nearnestness did they conjure you to take off a retroactive effect from\r\nthese assignats, and to prevent them from being applied to the payment\r\nof debts that were contracted anterior to the union!\r\n\r\nDid not this language energetically enough signify that they looked\r\nupon the assignats as a leprosy, and the union as a deadly contagion?\r\n\r\nAnd yet what regard was paid to so just a demand? It was buried in the\r\nCommittee of Finance. That committee wanted to make anarchy the means of\r\nan union. They only busied themselves in making the Belgic Provinces\r\nsubservient to their finances.\r\n\r\nCambon said loftily before the Belgians themselves: The Belgian war\r\ncosts us hundreds of millions. Their ordinary revenues, and even some\r\nextraordinary taxes, will not answer to our reimbursements; and yet we\r\nhave occasion for them. The mortgage of our assignats draws near its\r\nend. What must be done? Sell the Church property of Brabant. There is a\r\nmortgage of two thousand millions (eighty millions sterling). How shall\r\nwe get possession of them? By an immediate union. Instantly they decreed\r\nthis union. Men's minds were not disposed to it. What does it signify?\r\nLet us make them vote by means of money. Without delay, therefore, they\r\nsecretly order the Minister of Foreign Affairs to dispose of four or\r\nfive hundred thousand livres (20,000_l._ sterling) _to make the\r\nvagabonds of Brussels drunk, and to buy proselytes to the union in all\r\nthe States_. But even these means, it was said, will obtain but a weak\r\nminority in our favor. What does that signify? _Revolutions_, said they,\r\n_are made only by minorities. It is the minority which has made the\r\nRevolution of France; it is a minority which, has made the people\r\ntriumph_.\r\n\r\nThe Belgic Provinces were not sufficient to satisfy the voracious\r\ncravings of this financial system. Cambon wanted to unite everything,\r\nthat he might sell everything. Thus he forced the union of Savoy. In\r\nthe war with Holland, he saw nothing but gold to seize on, and\r\nassignats to sell at par.[11] \"Do not let us dissemble,\" said he one day\r\nto the Committee of General Defence, in presence even of the patriot\r\ndeputies of Holland, \"you have no ecclesiastical goods to offer us for\r\nour indemnity. IT IS A REVOLUTION IN THEIR COUNTERS AND IRON CHESTS[12]\r\nthat must be made amongst the DUTCH.\" The word was said, and the bankers\r\nAbema and Van Staphorst understood it.\r\n\r\nDo you think that that word has not been worth an army to the\r\nStadtholder? that it has not cooled the ardor of the Dutch patriots?\r\nthat it has not commanded the vigorous defence of Williamstadt?\r\n\r\nDo you believe that the patriots of Amsterdam, when they read the\r\npreparatory decree which gave France an execution on their goods,--do\r\nyou believe that those patriots would not have liked better to have\r\nremained under the government of the Stadtholder, who took from them no\r\nmore than a fixed portion of their property, than to pass under that of\r\na revolutionary power, which would make a complete revolution in their\r\nbureaus and strong-boxes, and reduce them to wretchedness and rags?[13]\r\nRobbery and anarchy, instead of encouraging, will always stifle\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" they object to me, \"have not you and your friends chosen to\r\nexpose these measures in the rostrum of the National Convention? Why\r\nhave you not opposed yourself to all these fatal projects of union?\"\r\n\r\nThere are two answers to make here,--one general, one particular.\r\n\r\nYou complain of the silence of honest men! You quite forget, then,\r\nhonest men are the objects of your suspicion. Suspicion, if it does not\r\nstain the soul of a courageous man, at least arrests his thoughts in\r\ntheir passage to his lips. The suspicions of a good citizen freeze those\r\nmen whom the calumny of the wicked could not stop in their progress.\r\n\r\nYou complain of their silence! You forget, then, that you have often\r\nestablished an insulting equality between them and men covered with\r\ncrimes and made up of ignominy.\r\n\r\nYou forget, then, that you have twenty times left them covered with\r\nopprobrium by your galleries.\r\n\r\nYou forget, then, that you have not thought yourself sufficiently\r\npowerful to impose silence upon these galleries.\r\n\r\nWhat ought a wise man to do in the midst of these circumstances? He is\r\nsilent. He waits the moment when the passions give way; he waits till\r\nreason shall preside, and till the multitude shall listen to her voice.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the tactic displayed during all these unions? Cambon,\r\nincapable of political calculation, boasting his ignorance in the\r\ndiplomatic, flattering the ignorant multitude, lending his name and\r\npopularity to the anarchists, seconded by their vociferations, denounced\r\nincessantly, as counter-revolutionists, those intelligent persons who\r\nwere desirous at least of having things discussed. To oppose the acts of\r\nunion appeared to Cambon an overt act of treason. The wish so much as to\r\nreflect and to deliberate was in his eyes a great crime. He calumniated\r\nour intentions. The voice of every deputy, especially my voice, would\r\ninfallibly have been stifled. There were spies on the very monosyllables\r\nthat escaped our lips.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The most seditious libels upon all governments, in order to excite\r\ninsurrection in Spain, Holland, and other countries,--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[8] It may not be amiss, once for all, to remark on the style of all the\r\nphilosophical politicians of France. Without any distinction in their\r\nseveral sects and parties, they agree in treating all nations who will\r\nnot conform their government, laws, manners, and religion to the new\r\nFrench fashion, as _an herd of slaves_. They consider the content with\r\nwhich men live under those governments as stupidity, and all attachment\r\nto religion as the effect of the grossest ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe people of the Netherlands, by their Constitution, are as much\r\nentitled to be called free as any nation upon earth. The Austrian\r\ngovernment (until some wild attempts the Emperor Joseph made on the\r\nFrench principle, but which have been since abandoned by the court of\r\nVienna) has been remarkably mild. No people were more at their ease than\r\nthe Flemish subjects, particularly the lower classes. It is curious to\r\nhear this great oculist talk of couching the _cataract_ by which the\r\nNetherlands were _blinded_, and hindered from seeing in its proper\r\ncolors the beautiful vision of the French republic, which he has himself\r\npainted with so masterly an hand. That people must needs be dull, blind,\r\nand brutalized by fifteen hundred years of superstition, (the time\r\nelapsed since the introduction of Christianity amongst them,) who could\r\nprefer their former state to the _present state of France_! The reader\r\nwill remark, that the only difference between Brissot and his\r\nadversaries is in the _mode_ of bringing other nations into the pale of\r\nthe French republic. _They_ would abolish the order and classes of\r\nsociety, and all religion, at a stroke: Brissot would have just the same\r\nthing done, but with more address and management.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[9] See the correspondence of Dumouriez, especially the letter of the\r\n12th of March.\r\n\r\n[10] They have not as yet proceeded farther with regard to the English\r\ndominions. Here we only see as yet _the good writings_ of Paine, and of\r\nhis learned associates, and the labors of the _missionary clubs_, and\r\nother zealous instructors.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[11] The same thing will happen in Savoy. The persecution of the clergy\r\nhas soured people's minds. The commissaries represent them to us as good\r\nFrenchmen. I put them to the proof. Where are the legions?

It signifies all\r\nmovable property which may be represented in bonds, notes, bills,\r\nstocks, or any sort of public or private securities.

I confess I should have liked the composition rather better, if it\r\nhad been quite new. But every man has his taste, and his Grace is an\r\nadmirer of ancient music.\r\n\r\nThere may be sometimes too much even of a good thing. A toast is good,\r\nand a bumper is not bad: but the best toasts may be so often repeated as\r\nto disgust the palate, and ceaseless rounds of bumpers may nauseate and\r\noverload the stomach. The ears of the most steady-voting politicians may\r\nat last be stunned with \"three times three.\" I am sure I have been very\r\ngrateful for the flattering remembrance made of me in the toasts of the\r\nRevolution Society, and of other clubs formed on the same laudable plan.\r\nAfter giving the brimming honors to Citizen Thomas Paine and to Citizen\r\nDr. Priestley, the gentlemen of these clubs seldom failed to bring me\r\nforth in my turn, and to drink, \"Mr. Burke, and thanks to him for the\r\ndiscussion he has provoked.\"\r\n\r\nI found myself elevated with this honor; for, even by the collision of\r\nresistance, to be the means of striking out sparkles of truth, if not\r\nmerit, is at least felicity.\r\n\r\nHere I might have rested. But when I found that the great advocate, Mr.\r\nErskine, condescended to resort to these bumper toasts, as the pure and\r\nexuberant fountains of politics and of rhetoric, (as I hear he did, in\r\nthree or four speeches made in defence of certain worthy citizens,) I\r\nwas rather let down a little. Though still somewhat proud of myself, I\r\nwas not quite so proud of my voucher. Though he is no idolater of fame,\r\nin some way or other Mr. Erskine will always do himself honor. Methinks,\r\nhowever, in following the precedents of these toasts, he seemed to do\r\nmore credit to his diligence as a special pleader than to his invention\r\nas an orator. To those who did not know the abundance of his resources,\r\nboth of genius and erudition, there was something in it that indicated\r\nthe want of a good assortment, with regard to richness and variety, in\r\nthe magazine of topics and commonplaces which I suppose he keeps by him,\r\nin imitation of Cicero and other renowned declaimers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nMr. Erskine supplied something, I allow, from the stores of his\r\nimagination, in metamorphosing the jovial toasts of clubs into solemn\r\nspecial arguments at the bar. So far the thing showed talent: however, I\r\nmust still prefer the bar of the tavern to the other bar. The toasts at\r\nthe first hand were better than the arguments at the second. Even when\r\nthe toasts began to grow old as sarcasms, they were washed down with\r\nstill older pricked election Port; then the acid of the wine made some\r\namends for the want of anything piquant in the wit. But when his Grace\r\ngave them a second transformation, and brought out the vapid stuff\r\nwhich had wearied the clubs and disgusted the courts, the drug made up\r\nof the bottoms of rejected bottles, all smelling so wofully of the cork\r\nand of the cask, and of everything except the honest old lamp, and when\r\nthat sad draught had been farther infected with the jail pollution of\r\nthe Old Bailey, and was dashed and brewed and ineffectually stummed\r\nagain into a senatorial exordium in the House of Lords, I found all the\r\nhigh flavor and mantling of my honors tasteless, flat, and stale.\r\nUnluckily, the new tax on wine is felt even in the greatest fortunes,\r\nand his Grace submits to take up with the heel-taps of Mr. Erskine.\r\n\r\nI have had the ill or good fortune to provoke two great men of this age\r\nto the publication of their opinions: I mean Citizen Thomas Paine, and\r\nhis Grace the **** of *******. I am not so great a leveller as to put\r\nthese two great men on a par, either in the state, or the republic of\r\nletters; but \"the field of glory is a field for all.\" It is a large one,\r\nindeed; and we all may run, God knows where, in chase of glory, over the\r\nboundless expanse of that wild heath whose horizon always flies before\r\nus. I assure his Grace, (if he will yet give me leave to call him so,)\r\nwhatever may be said on the authority of the clubs or of the bar, that\r\nCitizen Paine (who, they will have it, hunts with me in couples, and who\r\nonly moves as I drag him along) has a sufficient activity in his own\r\nnative benevolence to dispose and enable him to take the lead for\r\nhimself. He is ready to blaspheme his God, to insult his king, and to\r\nlibel the Constitution of his country, without any provocation from me\r\nor any encouragement from his Grace. I assure him that I shall not be\r\nguilty of the injustice of charging Mr. Paine's next work against\r\nreligion and human society upon his Grace's excellent speech in the\r\nHouse of Lords. I farther assure this noble Duke that I neither\r\nencouraged nor provoked that worthy citizen to seek for plenty, liberty,\r\nsafety, justice, or lenity, in the famine, in the prisons, in the\r\ndecrees of Convention, in the revolutionary tribunal, and in the\r\nguillotine of Paris, rather than quietly to take up with what he could\r\nfind in the glutted markets, the unbarricadoed streets, the drowsy Old\r\nBailey judges, or, at worst, the airy, wholesome pillory of Old England.\r\nThe choice of country was his own taste. The writings were the effects\r\nof his own zeal. In spite of his friend Dr. Priestley, he was a free\r\nagent. I admit, indeed, that my praises of the British government,\r\nloaded with all its incumbrances, clogged with its peers and its beef,\r\nits parsons and its pudding, its commons and its beer, and its dull\r\nslavish liberty of going about just as one pleases, had something to\r\nprovoke a jockey of Norfolk,[14] who was inspired with the resolute\r\nambition of becoming a citizen of France, to do something which might\r\nrender him worthy of naturalization in that grand asylum of persecuted\r\nmerit, something which should entitle him to a place in the senate of\r\nthe adoptive country of all the gallant, generous, and humane. This, I\r\nsay, was possible. But the truth is, (with great deference to his Grace\r\nI say it,) Citizen Paine acted without any provocation at all; he acted\r\nsolely from the native impulses of his own excellent heart.\r\n\r\nHis Grace, like an able orator, as he is, begins with giving me a great\r\ndeal of praise for talents which I do not possess. He does this to\r\nentitle himself, on the credit of this gratuitous kindness, to\r\nexaggerate my abuse of the parts which his bounty, and not that of\r\nNature, has bestowed upon me. In this, too, he has condescended to copy\r\nMr. Erskine. These priests (I hope they will excuse me, I mean priests\r\nof the Rights of Man) begin by crowning me with their flowers and their\r\nfillets, and bedewing me with their odors, as a preface to their\r\nknocking me on the head with their consecrated axes. I have injured, say\r\nthey, the Constitution; and I have abandoned the Whig party and the Whig\r\nprinciples that I professed. I do not mean, my dear Sir, to defend\r\nmyself against his Grace. I have not much interest in what the world\r\nshall think or say of me; as little has the world an interest in what I\r\nshall think or say of any one in it; and I wish that his Grace had\r\nsuffered an unhappy man to enjoy, in his retreat, the melancholy\r\nprivileges of obscurity and sorrow. At any rate, I have spoken and I\r\nhave written on the subject. If I have written or spoken so poorly as to\r\nbe quite forgot, a fresh apology will not make a more lasting\r\nimpression. \"I must let the tree lie as it falls.\" Perhaps I must take\r\nsome shame to myself. I confess that I have acted on my own principles\r\nof government, and not on those of his Grace, which are, I dare say,\r\nprofound and wise, but which I do not pretend to understand. As to the\r\nparty to which he alludes, and which has long taken its leave of me, I\r\nbelieve the principles of the book which he condemns are very\r\nconformable to the opinions of many of the most considerable and most\r\ngrave in that description of politicians. A few, indeed, who, I admit,\r\nare equally respectable in all points, differ from me, and talk his\r\nGrace's language. I am too feeble to contend with them. They have the\r\nfield to themselves. There are others, very young and very ingenious\r\npersons, who form, probably, the largest part of what his Grace, I\r\nbelieve, is pleased to consider as that party. Some of them were not\r\nborn into the world, and all of them were children, when I entered into\r\nthat connection. I give due credit to the censorial brow, to the broad\r\nphylacteries, and to the imposing gravity of those magisterial rabbins\r\nand doctors in the cabala of political science. I admit that \"wisdom is\r\nas the gray hair to man, and that learning is like honorable old age.\"\r\nBut, at a time when liberty is a good deal talked of, perhaps I might be\r\nexcused, if I caught something of the general indocility. It might not\r\nbe surprising, if I lengthened my chain a link or two, and, in an age of\r\nrelaxed discipline, gave a trifling indulgence to my own notions. If\r\nthat could be allowed, perhaps I might sometimes (by accident, and\r\nwithout an unpardonable crime) trust as much to my own very careful and\r\nvery laborious, though perhaps somewhat purblind disquisitions, as to\r\ntheir soaring, intuitive, eagle-eyed authority. But the modern liberty\r\nis a precious thing. It must not be profaned by too vulgar an use. It\r\nbelongs only to the chosen few, who are born to the hereditary\r\nrepresentation of the whole democracy, and who leave nothing at all, no,\r\nnot the offal, to us poor outcasts of the plebeian race.\r\n\r\nAmongst those gentlemen who came to authority as soon or sooner than\r\nthey came of age I do not mean to include his Grace. With all those\r\nnative titles to empire over our minds which distinguish the others, he\r\nhas a large share of experience. He certainly ought to understand the\r\nBritish Constitution better than I do. He has studied it in the\r\nfundamental part. For one election I have seen, he has been concerned in\r\ntwenty. Nobody is less of a visionary theorist; nobody has drawn his\r\nspeculations more from practice. No peer has condescended to superintend\r\nwith more vigilance the declining franchises of the poor commons. \"With\r\nthrice great Hermes he has outwatched the Bear.\" Often have his candles\r\nbeen burned to the snuff, and glimmered and stunk in the sockets, whilst\r\nhe grew pale at his constitutional studies; long, sleepless nights has\r\nhe wasted, long, laborious, shiftless journeys has he made, and great\r\nsums has he expended, in order to secure the purity, the independence,\r\nand the sobriety of elections, and to give a check, if possible, to the\r\nruinous charges that go nearly to the destruction of the right of\r\nelection itself.\r\n\r\nAmidst these his labors, his Grace will be pleased to forgive me, if my\r\nzeal, less enlightened, to be sure, than his by midnight lamps and\r\nstudies, has presumed to talk too favorably of this Constitution, and\r\neven to say something sounding like approbation of that body which has\r\nthe honor to reckon his Grace at the head of it, Those who dislike this\r\npartiality, or, if his Grace pleases, this flattery of mine, have a\r\ncomfort at hand. I may be refuted and brought to shame by the most\r\nconvincing of all refutations, a practical refutation. Every individual\r\npeer for himself may show that I was ridiculously wrong; the whole body\r\nof those noble persons may refute me for the whole corps. If they\r\nplease, they are more powerful advocates against themselves than a\r\nthousand scribblers like me can be in their favor. If I were even\r\npossessed of those powers which his Grace, in order to heighten my\r\noffence, is pleased to attribute to me, there would be little\r\ndifference. The eloquence of Mr. Erskine might save Mr. ***** from the\r\ngallows, but no eloquence could save Mr. Jackson from the effects of his\r\nown potion.\r\n\r\nIn that unfortunate book of mine, which is put in the _Index\r\nExpurgatorius_ of the modern Whigs, I might have spoken too favorably\r\nnot only of those who wear coronets, but of those who wear crowns.\r\nKings, however, have not only long arms, but strong ones too. A great\r\nNorthern potentate, for instance, is able in one moment, and with one\r\nbold stroke of his diplomatic pen, to efface all the volumes which I\r\ncould write in a century, or which the most laborious publicists of\r\nGermany ever carried to the fair of Leipsic, as an apology for monarchs\r\nand monarchy. Whilst I, or any other poor, puny, private sophist, was\r\ndefending the Declaration of Pilnitz, his Majesty might refute me by the\r\nTreaty of Basle. Such a monarch may destroy one republic because it had\r\na king at its head, and he may balance this extraordinary act by\r\nfounding another republic that has cut off the head of its king. I\r\ndefended that great potentate for associating in a grand alliance for\r\nthe preservation of the old governments of Europe; but he puts me to\r\nsilence by delivering up all those governments (his own virtually\r\nincluded) to the new system of France. If he is accused before the\r\nParisian tribunal (constituted for the trial of kings) for having\r\npolluted the soil of liberty by the tracks of his disciplined slaves, he\r\nclears himself by surrendering the finest parts of Germany (with a\r\nhandsome cut of his own territories) to the offended majesty of the\r\nregicides of France. Can I resist this? Am I responsible for it, if,\r\nwith a torch in his hand, and a rope about his neck, he makes _amende\r\nhonorable_ to the _sans-culotterie_ of the Republic one and indivisible?\r\nIn that humiliating attitude, in spite of my protests, he may supplicate\r\npardon for his menacing proclamations, and, as an expiation to those\r\nwhom he failed to terrify with his threats, he may abandon those whom he\r\nhad seduced by his promises. He may sacrifice the royalists of France,\r\nwhom he had called to his standard, as a salutary example to those who\r\nshall adhere to their native sovereign, or shall confide in any other\r\nwho undertakes the cause of oppressed kings and of loyal subjects.\r\n\r\nHow can I help it, if this high-minded prince will subscribe to the\r\ninvectives which the regicides have made against all kings, and\r\nparticularly against himself? How can I help it, if this royal\r\npropagandist will preach the doctrine of the Rights of Men? Is it my\r\nfault, if his professors of literature read lectures on that code in all\r\nhis academies, and if all the pensioned managers of the newspapers in\r\nhis dominions diffuse it throughout Europe in an hundred journals? Can\r\nit be attributed to me, if he will initiate all his grenadiers and all\r\nhis hussars in these high mysteries? Am I responsible, if he will make\r\n_Le Droit de l'Homme_, or _La Souverainté du Peuple_ the favorite parole\r\nof his military orders? Now that his troops are to act with the brave\r\nlegions of freedom, no doubt he will fit them for their fraternity. He\r\nwill teach the Prussians to think, to feel, and to act like them, and to\r\nemulate the glories of the _régiment de l'échafaud_. He will employ the\r\nillustrious Citizen Santerre, the general of his new allies, to instruct\r\nthe dull Germans how they shall conduct themselves towards persons who,\r\nlike Louis the Sixteenth, (whose cause and person he once took into his\r\nprotection,) shall dare, without the sanction of the people, or with it,\r\nto consider themselves as hereditary kings. Can I arrest this great\r\npotentate in his career of glory? Am I blamable in recommending virtue\r\nand religion as the true foundation of all monarchies, because the\r\nprotector of the three religions of the Westphalian arrangement, to\r\ningratiate himself with the Republic of Philosophy, shall abolish all\r\nthe three? It is not in my power to prevent the grand patron of the\r\nReformed Church, if he chooses it, from annulling the Calvinistic\r\nsabbath, and establishing the _décadi_ of atheism in all his states. He\r\nmay even renounce and abjure his favorite mysticism in the Temple of\r\nReason. In these things, at least, he is truly despotic. He has now\r\nshaken hands with everything which at first had inspired him with\r\nhorror. It would be curious indeed to see (what I shall not, however,\r\ntravel so far to see) the ingenious devices and the elegant\r\ntransparencies which, on the restoration of peace and the commencement\r\nof Prussian liberty, are to decorate Potsdam and Charlottenburg\r\n_festeggianti_. What shades of his armed ancestors of the House of\r\nBrandenburg will the committee of _Illuminés_ raise up in the\r\nopera-house of Berlin, to dance a grand ballet in the rejoicings for\r\nthis auspicious event? Is it a grand master of the Teutonic order, or is\r\nit the great Elector? Is it the first king of Prussia, or the last? or\r\nis the whole long line (long, I mean, _a parte ante_) to appear like\r\nBanquo's royal procession in the tragedy of Macbeth?\r\n\r\nHow can I prevent all these arts of royal policy, and all these displays\r\nof royal magnificence? How can I prevent the successor of Frederick the\r\nGreat from aspiring to a new, and, in this age, unexampled kind of\r\nglory? Is it in my power to say that he shall not make his confessions\r\nin the style of St. Austin or of Rousseau? that he shall not assume the\r\ncharacter of the penitent and flagellant, and, grafting monkery on\r\nphilosophy, strip himself of his regal purple, clothe his gigantic limbs\r\nin the sackcloth and the _hair-shirt_, and exercise on his broad\r\nshoulders the disciplinary scourge of the holy order of the\r\n_Sans-Culottes_? It is not in me to hinder kings from making new orders\r\nof religious and martial knighthood. I am not Hercules enough to uphold\r\nthose orbs which the Atlases of the world are so desirous of shifting\r\nfrom their weary shoulders. What can be done against the magnanimous\r\nresolution of the great to accomplish the degradation and the ruin of\r\ntheir own character and situation?\r\n\r\nWhat I say of the German princes, that I say of all the other dignities\r\nand all the other institutions of the Holy Roman Empire. If they have a\r\nmind to destroy themselves, they may put their advocates to silence and\r\ntheir advisers to shame. I have often praised the Aulic Council. It is\r\nvery true, I did so. I thought it a tribunal as well formed as human\r\nwisdom could form a tribunal for coercing the great, the rich, and the\r\npowerful,--for obliging them to submit their necks to the imperial laws,\r\nand to those of Nature and of nations: a tribunal well conceived for\r\nextirpating peculation, corruption, and oppression from all the parts of\r\nthat vast, heterogeneous mass, called the Germanic body. I should not be\r\ninclined to retract these praises upon any of the ordinary lapses into\r\nwhich human infirmity will fall; they might still stand, though some of\r\ntheir _conclusums_ should taste of the prejudices of country or of\r\nfaction, whether political or religious. Some degree even of corruption\r\nshould not make me think them guilty of suicide; but if we could suppose\r\nthat the Aulic Council, not regarding duty or even common decorum,\r\nlistening neither to the secret admonitions of conscience nor to the\r\npublic voice of fame, some of the members basely abandoning their post,\r\nand others continuing in it only the more infamously to betray it,\r\nshould give a judgment so shameless and so prostitute, of such monstrous\r\nand even portentous corruption, that no example in the history of human\r\ndepravity, or even in the fictions of poetic imagination, could possibly\r\nmatch it,--if it should be a judgment which, with cold, unfeeling\r\ncruelty, after long deliberations, should condemn millions of innocent\r\npeople to extortion, to rapine, and to blood, and should devote some of\r\nthe finest countries upon earth to ravage and desolation,--does any one\r\nthink that any servile apologies of mine, or any strutting and bullying\r\ninsolence of their own, can save them from the ruin that must fell on\r\nall institutions of dignity or of authority that are perverted from\r\ntheir purport to the oppression of human nature in others and to its\r\ndisgrace in themselves? As the wisdom of men mates such institutions,\r\nthe folly of men destroys them. Whatever we may pretend, there is always\r\nmore in the soundness of the materials than in the fashion of the work.\r\nThe order of a good building is something. But if it be wholly declined\r\nfrom its perpendicular, if the cement is loose and incoherent, if the\r\nstones are scaling with every change of the weather, and the whole\r\ntoppling on our heads, what matter is it whether we are crushed by a\r\nCorinthian or a Doric ruin? The fine form of a vessel is a matter of use\r\nand of delight. It is pleasant to see her decorated with cost and art.\r\nBut what signifies even the mathematical truth of her form,--what\r\nsignify all the art and cost with which she can be carved, and painted,\r\nand gilded, and covered with decorations from stem to stern,--what\r\nsignify all her rigging and sails, her flags, her pendants, and her\r\nstreamers,--what signify even her cannon, her stores, and her\r\nprovisions, if all her planks and timbers be unsound and rotten?\r\n\r\n    Quamvis Pontica pinus,\r\n    Silvæ filia nobilis,\r\n    Jactes et genus et nomen inutile.\r\n\r\nI have been stimulated, I know not how, to give you this trouble by what\r\nvery few except myself would think worth any trouble at all. In a speech\r\nin the House of Lords, I have been attacked for the defence of a scheme\r\nof government in which that body inheres, and in which alone it can\r\nexist. Peers of Great Britain may become as penitent as the sovereign of\r\nPrussia. They may repent of what they have done in assertion of the\r\nhonor of their king, and in favor of their own safety. But never the\r\ngloom that lowers over the fortune of the cause, nor anything which the\r\ngreat may do towards hastening their own fall, can make me repent of\r\nwhat I have done by pen or voice (the only arms I possess) in favor of\r\nthe order of things into which I was born and in which I fondly hoped to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nIn the long series of ages which have furnished the matter of history,\r\nnever was so beautiful and so august a spectacle presented to the moral\r\neye as Europe afforded the day before the Revolution in France. I knew,\r\nindeed, that this prosperity contained in itself the seeds of its own\r\ndanger. In one part of the society it caused laxity and debility; in the\r\nother it produced bold spirits and dark designs. A false philosophy\r\npassed from academies into courts; and the great themselves were\r\ninfected with the theories which conducted to their ruin. Knowledge,\r\nwhich in the two last centuries either did not exist at all, or existed\r\nsolidly on right principles and in chosen hands, was now diffused,\r\nweakened, and perverted. General wealth loosened morals, relaxed\r\nvigilance, and increased presumption. Men of talent began to compare, in\r\nthe partition of the common stock of public prosperity, the proportions\r\nof the dividends with the merits of the claimants. As usual, they found\r\ntheir portion not equal to their estimate (or perhaps to the public\r\nestimate) of their own worth. When it was once discovered by the\r\nRevolution in France that a struggle between establishment and rapacity\r\ncould be maintained, though but for one year and in one place, I was\r\nsure that a practicable breach was made in the whole order of things,\r\nand in every country. Religion, that held the materials of the fabric\r\ntogether, was first systematically loosened. All other opinions, under\r\nthe name of prejudices, must fall along with it; and property, left\r\nundefended by principles, became a repository of spoils to tempt\r\ncupidity, and not a magazine to furnish arms for defence. I knew, that,\r\nattacked on all sides by the infernal energies of talents set in action\r\nby vice and disorder, authority could not stand upon authority alone. It\r\nwanted some other support than the poise of its own gravity. Situations\r\nformerly supported persons. It now became necessary that personal\r\nqualities should support situations. Formerly, where authority was\r\nfound, wisdom and virtue were presumed. But now the veil was torn, and,\r\nto keep off sacrilegious intrusion, it was necessary that in the\r\nsanctuary of government something should be disclosed not only\r\nvenerable, but dreadful. Government was at once to show itself full of\r\nvirtue and full of force. It was to invite partisans, by making it\r\nappear to the world that a generous cause was to be asserted, one fit\r\nfor a generous people to engage in. From passive submission was it to\r\nexpect resolute defence? No! It must have warm advocates and passionate\r\ndefenders, which an heavy, discontented acquiescence never could\r\nproduce. What a base and foolish thing is it for any consolidated body\r\nof authority to say, or to act as if it said, \"I will put my trust, not\r\nin my own virtue, but in your patience; I will indulge in effeminacy, in\r\nindolence, in corruption; I will give way to all my perverse and vicious\r\nhumors, because you cannot punish me without the hazard of ruining\r\nyourselves.\"\r\n\r\nI wished to warn the people against the greatest of all evils,--a blind\r\nand furious spirit of innovation, under the name of reform. I was,\r\nindeed, well aware that power rarely reforms itself. So it is,\r\nundoubtedly, when all is quiet about it. But I was in hopes that\r\nprovident fear might prevent fruitless penitence. I trusted that danger\r\nmight produce at least circumspection. I flattered myself, in a moment\r\nlike this, that nothing would be added to make authority\r\ntop-heavy,--that the very moment of an earthquake would not be the time\r\nchosen for adding a story to our houses. I hoped to see the surest of\r\nall reforms, perhaps the only sure reform,--the ceasing to do ill. In\r\nthe mean time I wished to the people the wisdom of knowing how to\r\ntolerate a condition which none of their efforts can render much more\r\nthan tolerable. It was a condition, however, in which everything was to\r\nbe found that could enable them to live to Nature, and, if so they\r\npleased, to live to virtue and to honor.\r\n\r\nI do not repent that I thought better of those to whom I wished well\r\nthan they will suffer me long to think that they deserved. Far from\r\nrepenting, I would to God that new faculties had been called up in me,\r\nin favor not of this or that man, or this or that system, but of the\r\ngeneral, vital principle, that, whilst it was in its vigor, produced the\r\nstate of things transmitted to us from our fathers, but which, through\r\nthe joint operation of the abuses of authority and liberty, may perish\r\nin our hands. I am not of opinion that the race of men, and the\r\ncommonwealths they create, like the bodies of individuals, grow effete\r\nand languid and bloodless, and ossify, by the necessities of their own\r\nconformation, and the fatal operation of longevity and time. These\r\nanalogies between bodies natural and politic, though they may sometimes\r\nillustrate arguments, furnish no argument of themselves. They are but\r\ntoo often used, under the color of a specious philosophy, to find\r\napologies for the despair of laziness and pusillanimity, and to excuse\r\nthe want of all manly efforts, when the exigencies of our country call\r\nfor them the more loudly.\r\n\r\nHow often has public calamity been arrested on the very brink of ruin by\r\nthe seasonable energy of a single man! Have we no such man amongst us? I\r\nam as sure as I am of my being, that one vigorous mind, without office,\r\nwithout situation, without public functions of any kind, (at a time when\r\nthe want of such a thing is felt, as I am sure it is,) I say, one such\r\nman, confiding in the aid of God, and full of just reliance in his own\r\nfortitude, vigor, enterprise, and perseverance, would first draw to him\r\nsome few like himself, and then that multitudes, hardly thought to be in\r\nexistence, would appear and troop about him.\r\n\r\nIf I saw this auspicious beginning, baffled and frustrated as I am, yet\r\non the very verge of a timely grave, abandoned abroad and desolate at\r\nhome, stripped of my boast, my hope, my consolation, my helper, my\r\ncounsellor, and my guide, (you know in part what I have lost, and would\r\nto God I could clear myself of all neglect and fault in that loss,) yet\r\nthus, even thus, I would rake up the fire under all the ashes that\r\noppress it. I am no longer patient of the public eye; nor am I of force\r\nto win my way and to justle and elbow in a crowd. But, even in solitude,\r\nsomething may be done for society. The meditations of the closet have\r\ninfected senates with a subtle frenzy, and inflamed armies with the\r\nbrands of the Furies. The cure might come from the same source with the\r\ndistemper. I would add my part to those who would animate the people\r\n(whose hearts are yet right) to new exertions in the old cause.\r\n\r\nNovelty is not the only source of zeal. Why should not a Maccabæus and\r\nhis brethren arise to assert the honor of the ancient law and to defend\r\nthe temple of their forefathers with as ardent a spirit as can inspire\r\nany innovator to destroy the monuments of the piety and the glory of\r\nancient ages? It is not a hazarded assertion, it is a great truth, that,\r\nwhen once things are gone out of their ordinary course, it is by acts\r\nout of the ordinary course they can alone be reëstablished. Republican\r\nspirit can only be combated by a spirit of the same nature,--of the same\r\nnature, but informed with another principle, and pointing to another\r\nend. I would persuade a resistance both to the corruption and to the\r\nreformation that prevails. It will not be the weaker, but much the\r\nstronger, for combating both together. A victory over real corruptions\r\nwould enable us to baffle the spurious and pretended reformations. I\r\nwould not wish to excite, or even to tolerate, that kind of evil spirit\r\nwhich evokes the powers of hell to rectify the disorders of the earth.\r\nNo! I would add my voice with better, and, I trust, more potent charms,\r\nto draw down justice and wisdom and fortitude from heaven, for the\r\ncorrection of human vice, and the recalling of human error from the\r\ndevious ways into which it has been betrayed. I would wish to call the\r\nimpulses of individuals at once to the aid and to the control of\r\nauthority. By this, which I call the true republican spirit, paradoxical\r\nas it may appear, monarchies alone can be rescued from the imbecility of\r\ncourts and the madness of the crowd. This republican spirit would not\r\nsuffer men in high place to bring ruin on their country and on\r\nthemselves. It would reform, not by destroying, but by saving, the\r\ngreat, the rich, and the powerful. Such a republican spirit we perhaps\r\nfondly conceive to have animated the distinguished heroes and patriots\r\nof old, who knew no mode of policy but religion and virtue. These they\r\nwould have paramount to all constitutions; they would not suffer\r\nmonarchs, or senates, or popular assemblies, under pretences of dignity\r\nor authority or freedom, to shake off those moral riders which reason\r\nhas appointed to govern every sort of rude power. These, in appearance\r\nloading them by their weight, do by that pressure augment their\r\nessential force. The momentum is increased by the extraneous weight. It\r\nis true in moral as it is in mechanical science. It is true, not only in\r\nthe draught, but in the race. These riders of the great, in effect, hold\r\nthe reins which guide them in their course, and wear the spur that\r\nstimulates them to the goals of honor and of safety. The great must\r\nsubmit to the dominion of prudence and of virtue, or none will long\r\nsubmit to the dominion of the great. _Dîs te minorem quod geris,\r\nimperas_. This is the feudal tenure which they cannot alter.\r\n\r\nIndeed, my dear Sir, things are in a bad state. I do not deny a good\r\nshare of diligence, a very great share of ability, and much public\r\nvirtue to those who direct our affairs. But they are incumbered, not\r\naided, by their very instruments, and by all the apparatus of the state.\r\nI think that our ministry (though there are things against them which\r\nneither you nor I can dissemble, and which grieve me to the heart) is by\r\nfar the most honest and by far the wisest system of administration in\r\nEurope. Their fall would be no trivial calamity.\r\n\r\nNot meaning to depreciate the minority in Parliament, whose talents are\r\nalso great, and to whom I do not deny virtues, their system seems to me\r\nto be fundamentally wrong. But whether wrong or right, they have not\r\nenough of coherence among themselves, nor of estimation with the public,\r\nnor of numbers. They cannot make up an administration. Nothing is more\r\nvisible. Many other things are against them, which I do not charge as\r\nfaults, but reckon among national misfortunes. Extraordinary things must\r\nbe done, or one of the parties cannot stand as a ministry, nor the other\r\neven as an opposition. They cannot change their situations, nor can any\r\nuseful coalition be made between them. I do not see the mode of it nor\r\nthe way to it. This aspect of things I do not contemplate with pleasure.\r\n\r\nI well know that everything of the daring kind which I speak of is\r\ncritical: but the times are critical. New things in a new world! I see\r\nno hopes in the common tracks. If men are not to be found who can be got\r\nto feel within them some impulse, _quod nequeo monstrare, et sentio\r\ntantum_, and which makes them impatient of the present,--if none can be\r\ngot to feel that private persons may sometimes assume that sort of\r\nmagistracy which does not depend on the nomination of kings or the\r\nelection of the people, but has an inherent and self-existent power\r\nwhich both would recognize, I see nothing in the world to hope.\r\n\r\nIf I saw such a group beginning to cluster, such as they are, they\r\nshould have (all that I can give) my prayers and my advice. People talk\r\nof war or cry for peace: have they to the bottom considered the\r\nquestions either of war or peace, upon the scale of the existing world?\r\nNo, I fear they have not.\r\n\r\nWhy should not you yourself be one of those to enter your name in such a\r\nlist as I speak of? You are young; you have great talents; you have a\r\nclear head; you have a natural, fluent, and unforced elocution; your\r\nideas are just, your sentiments benevolent, open, and enlarged;--but\r\nthis is too big for your modesty. Oh! this modesty, in time and place,\r\nis a charming virtue, and the grace of all other virtues. But it is\r\nsometimes the worst enemy they have. Let him whose print I gave you the\r\nother day be engraved in your memory! Had it pleased Providence to have\r\nspared him for the trying situations that seem to be coming on,\r\nnotwithstanding that he was sometimes a little dispirited by the\r\ndisposition which we thought shown to depress him and set him aside, yet\r\nhe was always buoyed up again; and on one or two occasions he discovered\r\nwhat might be expected from the vigor and elevation of his mind, from\r\nhis unconquerable fortitude, and from the extent of his resources for\r\nevery purpose of speculation and of action. Remember him, my friend, who\r\nin the highest degree honored and respected you; and remember that great\r\nparts are a great trust. Remember, too, that mistaken or misapplied\r\nvirtues, if they are not as pernicious as vice, frustrate at least their\r\nown natural tendencies, and disappoint the purposes of the Great Giver.\r\n\r\nAdieu. My dreams are finished.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Mr. Paine is a Norfolk man, from Thetford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS AND DETAILS\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nSCARCITY.\r\n\r\nORIGINALLY PRESENTED\r\n\r\nTO THE RIGHT HON. WILLIAM PITT,\r\n\r\nIN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER,\r\n\r\n1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS AND DETAILS\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nSCARCITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all things, an indiscreet tampering with the trade of provisions is\r\nthe most dangerous, and it is always worst in the time when men are most\r\ndisposed to it,--that is, in the time of scarcity; because there is\r\nnothing on which the passions of men are so violent, and their judgment\r\nso weak, and on which there exists such a multitude of ill-founded\r\npopular prejudices.\r\n\r\nThe great use of government is as a restraint; and there is no restraint\r\nwhich it ought to put upon others, and upon itself too, rather than that\r\nwhich is imposed on the fury of speculating under circumstances of\r\nirritation. The number of idle tales spread about by the industry of\r\nfaction and by the zeal of foolish good-intention, and greedily devoured\r\nby the malignant credulity of mankind, tends infinitely to aggravate\r\nprejudices which in themselves are more than sufficiently strong. In\r\nthat state of affairs, and of the public with relation to them, the\r\nfirst thing that government owes to us, the people, is _information_;\r\nthe next is timely coercion: the one to guide our judgment; the other to\r\nregulate our tempers.\r\n\r\nTo provide for us in our necessities is not in the power of government.\r\nIt would be a vain presumption in statesmen to think they can do it.\r\nThe people maintain them, and not they the people. It is in the power of\r\ngovernment to prevent much evil; it can do very little positive good in\r\nthis, or perhaps in anything else. It is not only so of the state and\r\nstatesman, but of all the classes and descriptions of the rich: they are\r\nthe pensioners of the poor, and are maintained by their superfluity.\r\nThey are under an absolute, hereditary, and indefeasible dependence on\r\nthose who labor and are miscalled the poor.\r\n\r\nThe laboring people are only poor because they are numerous. Numbers in\r\ntheir nature imply poverty. In a fair distribution among a vast\r\nmultitude none can have much. That class of dependent pensioners called\r\nthe rich is so extremely small, that, if all their throats were cut, and\r\na distribution made of all they consume in a year, it would not give a\r\nbit of bread and cheese for one night's supper to those who labor, and\r\nwho in reality feed both the pensioners and themselves.\r\n\r\nBut the throats of the rich ought not to be cut, nor their magazines\r\nplundered; because, in their persons, they are trustees for those who\r\nlabor, and their hoards are the banking-houses of these latter. Whether\r\nthey mean it or not, they do, in effect, execute their trust,--some with\r\nmore, some with less fidelity and judgment. But, on the whole, the duty\r\nis performed, and everything returns, deducting some very trifling\r\ncommission and discount, to the place from whence it arose. When the\r\npoor rise to destroy the rich, they act as wisely for their own purposes\r\nas when they burn mills and throw corn into the river to make bread\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that we of the people ought to be informed, inclusively I\r\nsay we ought not to be flattered: flattery is the reverse of\r\ninstruction. The _poor_ in that case would be rendered as improvident as\r\nthe rich, which would not be at all good for them.\r\n\r\nNothing can be so base and so wicked as the political canting language,\r\n\"the laboring _poor_.\" Let compassion be shown in action,--the more, the\r\nbetter,--according to every man's ability; but let there be no\r\nlamentation of their condition. It is no relief to their miserable\r\ncircumstances; it is only an insult to their miserable understandings.\r\nIt arises from a total want of charity or a total want of thought. Want\r\nof one kind was never relieved by want of any other kind. Patience,\r\nlabor, sobriety, frugality, and religion should be recommended to them;\r\nall the rest is downright _fraud_. It is horrible to call them \"the\r\n_once happy_ laborer.\"\r\n\r\nWhether what may be called the moral or philosophical happiness of the\r\nlaborious classes is increased or not, I cannot say. The seat of that\r\nspecies of happiness is in the mind; and there are few data to ascertain\r\nthe comparative state of the mind at any two periods. Philosophical\r\nhappiness is to want little. Civil or vulgar happiness is to want much\r\nand to enjoy much.\r\n\r\nIf the happiness of the animal man (which certainly goes somewhere\r\ntowards the happiness of the rational man) be the object of our\r\nestimate, then I assert, without the least hesitation, that the\r\ncondition of those who labor (in all descriptions of labor, and in all\r\ngradations of labor, from the highest to the lowest inclusively) is, on\r\nthe whole, extremely meliorated, if more and better food is any standard\r\nof melioration. They work more, it is certain; but they have the\r\nadvantage of their augmented labor: yet whether that increase of labor\r\nbe on the whole a _good_ or an _evil_ is a consideration that would lead\r\nus a great way, and is not for my present purpose. But as to the fact of\r\nthe melioration of their diet, I shall enter into the detail of proof,\r\nwhenever I am called upon: in the mean time, the known difficulty of\r\ncontenting them with anything but bread made of the finest flour and\r\nmeat of the first quality is proof sufficient.\r\n\r\nI further assert, that, even under all the hardships of the last year,\r\nthe laboring people did, either out of their direct gains, or from\r\ncharity, (which it seems is now an insult to them,) in fact, fare better\r\nthan they did in seasons of common plenty, fifty or sixty years ago,--or\r\neven at the period of my English observation, which is about forty-four\r\nyears. I even assert that full as many in that class as ever were known\r\nto do it before continued to save money; and this I can prove, so far as\r\nmy own information and experience extend.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that the rate of wages has not increased with the nominal\r\nprice of provisions. I allow, it has not fluctuated with that\r\nprice,--nor ought it; and the squires of Norfolk had dined, when they\r\ngave it as their opinion that it might or ought to rise and fall with\r\nthe market of provisions. The rate of wages, in truth, has no _direct_\r\nrelation to that price. Labor is a commodity like every other, and rises\r\nor falls according to the demand. This is in the nature of things;\r\nhowever, the nature of things has provided for their necessities. Wages\r\nhave been twice raised in my time; and they hear a full proportion, or\r\neven a greater than formerly, to the medium of provision during the\r\nlast bad cycle of twenty years. They bear a full proportion to the\r\nresult of their labor. If we were wildly to attempt to force them beyond\r\nit, the stone which we had forced up the hill would only fall back upon\r\nthem in a diminished demand, or, what indeed is the far lesser evil, an\r\naggravated price of all the provisions which are the result of their\r\nmanual toil.\r\n\r\nThere is an implied contract, much stronger than any instrument or\r\narticle of agreement between the laborer in any occupation and his\r\nemployer,--that the labor, so far as that labor is concerned, shall be\r\nsufficient to pay to the employer a profit on his capital and a\r\ncompensation for his risk: in a word, that the labor shall produce an\r\nadvantage equal to the payment. Whatever is above that is a direct\r\n_tax_; and if the amount of that tax be left to the will and pleasure of\r\nanother, it is an _arbitrary tax_.\r\n\r\nIf I understand it rightly, the tax proposed on the farming interest of\r\nthis kingdom is to be levied at what is called the discretion of\r\njustices of peace.\r\n\r\nThe questions arising on this scheme of arbitrary taxation are these:\r\nWhether it is better to leave all dealing, in which there is no force or\r\nfraud, collusion or combination, entirely to the persons mutually\r\nconcerned in the matter contracted for,--or to put the contract into the\r\nhands of those who can have none or a very remote interest in it, and\r\nlittle or no knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt might be imagined that there would be very little difficulty in\r\nsolving this question: for what man, of any degree of reflection, can\r\nthink that a want of interest in any subject, closely connected with a\r\nwant of skill in it, qualifies a person to intermeddle in any the least\r\naffair,--much less in affairs that vitally concern the agriculture of\r\nthe kingdom, the first of all its concerns, and the foundation of all\r\nits prosperity in every other matter by which that prosperity is\r\nproduced?\r\n\r\nThe vulgar error on this subject arises from a total confusion in the\r\nvery idea of things widely different in themselves,--those of\r\nconvention, and those of judicature. When a contract is making, it is a\r\nmatter of discretion and of interest between the parties. In that\r\nintercourse, and in what is to arise from it, the parties are the\r\nmasters. If they are not completely so, they are not free, and therefore\r\ntheir contracts are void.\r\n\r\nBut this freedom has no farther extent, when the contract is made: then\r\ntheir discretionary powers expire, and a new order of things takes its\r\norigin. Then, and not till then, and on a difference between the\r\nparties, the office of the judge commences. He cannot dictate the\r\ncontract. It is his business to see that it be _enforced_,--provided\r\nthat it is not contrary to preëxisting laws, or obtained by force or\r\nfraud. If he is in any way a maker or regulator of the contract, in so\r\nmuch he is disqualified from being a judge. But this sort of confused\r\ndistribution of administrative and judicial characters (of which we have\r\nalready as much as is sufficient, and a little more) is not the only\r\nperplexity of notions and passions which trouble us in the present hour.\r\n\r\nWhat is doing supposes, or pretends, that the farmer and the laborer\r\nhave opposite interests,--that the farmer oppresses the laborer,--and\r\nthat a gentleman, called a justice of peace, is the protector of the\r\nlatter, and a control and restraint on the former; and this is a point\r\nI wish to examine in a manner a good deal different from that in which\r\ngentlemen proceed, who confide more in their abilities than is fit, and\r\nsuppose them capable of more than any natural abilities, fed with no\r\nother than the provender furnished by their own private speculations,\r\ncan accomplish. Legislative acts attempting to regulate this part of\r\neconomy do, at least as much as any other, require the exactest detail\r\nof circumstances, guided by the surest general principles that are\r\nnecessary to direct experiment and inquiry, in order again from those\r\ndetails to elicit principles, firm and luminous general principles, to\r\ndirect a practical legislative proceeding.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, I deny that it is in this case, as in any other, of\r\nnecessary implication that contracting parties should originally have\r\nhad different interests. By accident it may be so, undoubtedly, at the\r\noutset: but then the contract is of the nature of a compromise; and\r\ncompromise is founded on circumstances that suppose it the interest of\r\nthe parties to be reconciled in some medium. The principle of compromise\r\nadopted, of consequence the interests cease to be different.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of the farmer and the laborer, their interests are\r\nalways the same, and it is absolutely impossible that their free\r\ncontracts can be onerous to either party. It is the interest of the\r\nfarmer that his work should be done with effect and celerity; and that\r\ncannot be, unless the laborer is well fed, and otherwise found with such\r\nnecessaries of animal life, according to its habitudes, as may keep the\r\nbody in full force, and the mind gay and cheerful. For of all the\r\ninstruments of his trade, the labor of man (what the ancient writers\r\nhave called the _instrumentum vocale_) is that on which he is most to\r\nrely for the repayment of his capital. The other two, the _semivocale_\r\nin the ancient classification, that is, the working stock of cattle, and\r\nthe _instrumentum mutum_, such as carts, ploughs, spades, and so forth,\r\nthough not all inconsiderable in themselves, are very much inferior in\r\nutility or in expense, and, without a given portion of the first, are\r\nnothing at all. For, in all things whatever, the mind is the most\r\nvaluable and the most important; and in this scale the whole of\r\nagriculture is in a natural and just order: the beast is as an informing\r\nprinciple to the plough and cart; the laborer is as reason to the beast;\r\nand the farmer is as a thinking and presiding principle to the laborer.\r\nAn attempt to break this chain of subordination in any part is equally\r\nabsurd; but the absurdity is the most mischievous, in practical\r\noperation, where it is the most easy,--that is, where it is the most\r\nsubject to an erroneous judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is plainly more the farmer's interest that his men should thrive than\r\nthat his horses should be well fed, sleek, plump, and fit for use, or\r\nthan that his wagon and ploughs should be strong, in good repair, and\r\nfit for service.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the farmer ceases to profit of the laborer, and\r\nthat his capital is not continually manured and fructified, it is\r\nimpossible that he should continue that abundant nutriment and clothing\r\nand lodging proper for the protection of the instruments he employs.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the first and fundamental interest of the laborer, that\r\nthe farmer should have a full incoming profit on the product of his\r\nlabor. The proposition is self-evident; and nothing but the malignity,\r\nperverseness, and ill-governed passions of mankind, and particularly the\r\nenvy they bear to each other's prosperity, could prevent their seeing\r\nand acknowledging it, with thankfulness to the benign and wise Disposer\r\nof all things, who obliges men, whether they will or not, in pursuing\r\ntheir own selfish interests, to connect the general good with their own\r\nindividual success.\r\n\r\nBut who are to judge what that profit and advantage ought to be?\r\nCertainly no authority on earth. It is a matter of convention, dictated\r\nby the reciprocal conveniences of the parties, and indeed by their\r\nreciprocal necessities.--But if the farmer is excessively\r\navaricious?--Why, so much the better: the more he desires to increase\r\nhis gains, the more interested is he in the good condition of those upon\r\nwhose labor his gains must principally depend.\r\n\r\nI shall be told by the zealots of the sect of regulation, that this may\r\nbe true, and may be safely committed to the convention of the farmer and\r\nthe laborer, when the latter is in the prime of his youth, and at the\r\ntime of his health and vigor, and in ordinary times of abundance. But in\r\ncalamitous seasons, under accidental illness, in declining life, and\r\nwith the pressure of a numerous offspring, the future nourishers of the\r\ncommunity, but the present drains and blood-suckers of those who produce\r\nthem, what is to be done? When a man cannot live and maintain his family\r\nby the natural hire of his labor, ought it not to be raised by\r\nauthority?\r\n\r\nOn this head I must be allowed to submit what my opinions have ever\r\nbeen, and somewhat at large.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, I premise that labor is, as I have already intimated, a\r\ncommodity, and, as such, an article of trade. If I am right in this\r\nnotion, then labor must be subject to all the laws and principles of\r\ntrade, and not to regulations foreign to them, and that may be totally\r\ninconsistent with those principles and those laws. When any commodity is\r\ncarried to market, it is not the necessity of the vendor, but the\r\nnecessity of the purchaser, that raises the price. The extreme want of\r\nthe seller has rather (by the nature of things with which we shall in\r\nvain contend) the direct contrary operation. If the goods at market are\r\nbeyond the demand, they fall in their value; if below it, they rise. The\r\nimpossibility of the subsistence of a man who carries his labor to a\r\nmarket is totally beside the question, in this way of viewing it. The\r\nonly question is, What is it worth to the buyer?\r\n\r\nBut if authority comes in and forces the buyer to a price, what is this\r\nin the case (say) of a farmer who buys the labor of ten or twelve\r\nlaboring men, and three or four handicrafts,--what is it but to make an\r\narbitrary division of his property among them?\r\n\r\nThe whole of his gains (I say it with the most certain conviction) never\r\ndo amount anything like in value to what he pays to his laborers and\r\nartificers; so that a very small advance upon what _one_ man pays to\r\n_many_ may absorb the whole of what he possesses, and amount to an\r\nactual partition of all his substance among them. A perfect equality\r\nwill, indeed, be produced,--that is to say, equal want, equal\r\nwretchedness, equal beggary, and, on the part of the partitioners, a\r\nwoful, helpless, and desperate disappointment. Such is the event of all\r\ncompulsory equalizations. They pull down what is above; they never raise\r\nwhat is below; and they depress high and low together beneath the level\r\nof what was originally the lowest.\r\n\r\nIf a commodity is raised by authority above what it will yield with a\r\nprofit to the buyer, that commodity will be the less dealt in. If a\r\nsecond blundering interposition be used to correct the blunder of the\r\nfirst and an attempt is made to force the purchase of the commodity, (of\r\nlabor, for instance,) the one of these two things must happen: either\r\nthat the forced buyer is ruined, or the price of the product of the\r\nlabor in that proportion is raised. Then the wheel turns round, and the\r\nevil complained of falls with aggravated weight on the complainant. The\r\nprice of corn, which is the result of the expense of all the operations\r\nof husbandry taken together, and for some time continued, will rise on\r\nthe laborer, considered as a consumer. The very best will be, that he\r\nremains where he was. But if the price of the corn should not compensate\r\nthe price of labor, what is far more to be feared, the most serious\r\nevil, the very destruction of agriculture itself, is to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nNothing is such an enemy to accuracy of judgment as a coarse\r\ndiscrimination, a want of such classification and distribution as the\r\nsubject admits of. Increase the rate of wages to the laborer, say the\r\nregulators,--as if labor was but one thing, and of one value. But this\r\nvery broad, generic term, _labor_, admits, at least, of two or three\r\nspecific descriptions: and these will suffice, at least, to let\r\ngentlemen discern a little the necessity of proceeding with caution in\r\ntheir coercive guidance of those whose existence depends upon the\r\nobservance of still nicer distinctions and subdivisions than commonly\r\nthey resort to in forming their judgments on this very enlarged part of\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe laborers in husbandry may be divided,--First, Into those who are\r\nable to perform the full work of a man,--that is, what can be done by a\r\nperson from twenty-one years of age to fifty. I know no husbandry work\r\n(mowing hardly excepted) that is not equally within the power of all\r\npersons within those ages, the more advanced fully compensating by knack\r\nand habit what they lose in activity. Unquestionably, there is a good\r\ndeal of difference between the value of one man's labor and that of\r\nanother, from strength, dexterity, and honest application. But I am\r\nquite sure, from my best observation, that any given five men will, in\r\ntheir total, afford a proportion of labor equal to any other five within\r\nthe periods of life I have stated: that is, that among such five men\r\nthere will be one possessing all the qualifications of a good workman,\r\none bad, and the other three middling, and approximating to the first\r\nand the last. So that, in so small a platoon as that of even five, you\r\nwill find the full complement of all that five men _can_ earn. Taking\r\nfive and five throughout the kingdom, they are equal: therefore an error\r\nwith regard to the equalization of their wages by those who employ five,\r\nas farmers do at the very least, cannot be considerable.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Those who are able to work, but not the complete task of a\r\nday-laborer. This class is infinitely diversified, but will aptly enough\r\nfall into principal divisions. _Men_, from the decline, which after\r\nfifty becomes every year more sensible, to the period of debility and\r\ndecrepitude, and the maladies that precede a final dissolution. _Women_,\r\nwhose employment on husbandry is but occasional, and who differ more in\r\neffective labor one from another than men do, on account of gestation,\r\nnursing, and domestic management, over and above the difference they\r\nhave in common with men in advancing, in stationary, and in declining\r\nlife. _Children_, who proceed on the reverse order, growing from less to\r\ngreater utility, but with a still greater disproportion of nutriment to\r\nlabor than is found in the second of those subdivisions: as is visible\r\nto those who will give themselves the trouble of examining into the\r\ninterior economy of a poor-house.\r\n\r\nThis inferior classification is introduced to show that laws prescribing\r\nor magistrates exercising a very stiff and often inapplicable rule, or a\r\nblind and rash discretion, never can provide the just proportions\r\nbetween earning and salary, on the one hand, and nutriment on the other:\r\nwhereas interest, habit, and the tacit convention that arise from a\r\nthousand nameless circumstances produce a _tact_ that regulates without\r\ndifficulty what laws and magistrates cannot regulate at all. The first\r\nclass of labor wants nothing to equalize it; it equalizes itself. The\r\nsecond and third are not capable of any equalization.\r\n\r\nBut what if the rate of hire to the laborer comes far short of his\r\nnecessary subsistence, and the calamity of the time is so great as to\r\nthreaten actual famine? Is the poor laborer to be abandoned to the\r\nflinty heart and griping hand of base self-interest, supported by the\r\nsword of law, especially when there is reason to suppose that the very\r\navarice of farmers themselves has concurred with the errors of\r\ngovernment to bring famine on the land?\r\n\r\nIn that case, my opinion is this: Whenever it happens that a man can\r\nclaim nothing according to the rules of commerce and the principles of\r\njustice, he passes out of that department, and comes within the\r\njurisdiction of mercy. In that province the magistrate has nothing at\r\nall to do; his interference is a violation of the property which it is\r\nhis office to protect. Without all doubt, charity to the poor is a\r\ndirect and obligatory duty upon all Christians, next in order after the\r\npayment of debts, full as strong, and by Nature made infinitely more\r\ndelightful to us Pufendorf, and other casuists, do not, I think,\r\ndenominate it quite properly, when they call it a duty of imperfect\r\nobligation. But the manner, mode, time, choice of objects, and\r\nproportion are left to private discretion; and perhaps for that very\r\nreason it is performed with the greater satisfaction, because the\r\ndischarge of it has more the appearance of freedom,--recommending us\r\nbesides very specially to the Divine favor, as the exercise of a virtue\r\nmost suitable to a being sensible of its own infirmity.\r\n\r\nThe cry of the people in cities and towns, though unfortunately (from a\r\nfear of their multitude and combination) the most regarded, ought, in\r\n_fact_, to be the _least_ attended to, upon this subject: for citizens\r\nare in a state of utter ignorance of the means by which they are to be\r\nfed, and they contribute little or nothing, except in an infinitely\r\ncircuitous manner, to their own maintenance. They are truly _fruges\r\nconsumere nati_. They are to be heard with great respect and attention\r\nupon matters within their province,--that is, on trades and\r\nmanufactures; but on anything that relates to agriculture they are to be\r\nlistened to with the same _reverence_ which we pay to the dogmas of\r\nother ignorant and presumptuous men.\r\n\r\nIf any one were to tell them that they were to give in an account of all\r\nthe stock in their shops,--that attempts would be made to limit their\r\nprofits, or raise the price of the laboring manufacturers upon them, or\r\nrecommend to government, out of a capital from the public revenues, to\r\nset up a shop of the same commodities, in order to rival them, and keep,\r\nthem to reasonable dealing,--they would very soon see the impudence,\r\ninjustice, and oppression of such a course. They would not be mistaken:\r\nbut they are of opinion that agriculture is to be subject to other laws,\r\nand to be governed by other principles.\r\n\r\nA greater and more ruinous mistake cannot be fallen into than that the\r\ntrades of agriculture and grazing can be conducted upon any other than\r\nthe common principles of commerce: namely, that the producer should be\r\npermitted, and even expected, to look to all possible profit which\r\nwithout fraud or violence he can make; to turn plenty or scarcity to the\r\nbest advantage he can; to keep back or to bring forward his commodities\r\nat his pleasure; to account to no one for his stock or for his gain. On\r\nany other terms he is the slave of the consumer: and that he should be\r\nso is of no benefit to the consumer. No slave was ever so beneficial to\r\nthe master as a freeman that deals with him on an equal footing by\r\nconvention, formed on the rules and principles of contending interests\r\nand compromised advantages. The consumer, if he were suffered, would in\r\nthe end always be the dupe of his own tyranny and injustice. The landed\r\ngentleman is never to forget that the farmer is his representative.\r\n\r\nIt is a perilous thing to try experiments on the farmer. The farmer's\r\ncapital (except in a few persons and in a very few places) is far more\r\nfeeble than commonly is imagined. The trade is a very poor trade; it is\r\nsubject to great risks and losses. The capital, such as it is, is turned\r\nbut once in the year; in some branches it requires three years before\r\nthe money is paid: I believe never less than three in the turnip and\r\ngrass-land course, which is the prevalent course on the more or less\r\nfertile sandy and gravelly loams,--and these compose the soil in the\r\nsouth and southeast of England, the best adapted, and perhaps the only\r\nones that are adapted, to the turnip husbandry.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare that the most prosperous farmer, counting the value of\r\nhis quick and dead stock, the interest of the money he turns, together\r\nwith his own wages as a bailiff or overseer, ever does make twelve or\r\nfifteen per centum by the year on his capital. I speak of the\r\nprosperous. In most of the parts of England which have fallen within my\r\nobservation I have rarely known a farmer, who to his own trade has not\r\nadded some other employment or traffic, that, after a course of the most\r\nunremitting parsimony and labor, (such for the greater part is theirs,)\r\nand persevering in his business for a long course of years, died worth\r\nmore than paid his debts, leaving his posterity to continue in nearly\r\nthe same equal conflict between industry and want, in which the last\r\npredecessor, and a long line of predecessors before him, lived and died.\r\n\r\nObserve that I speak of the generality of farmers, who have not more\r\nthan from one hundred and fifty to three or four hundred acres. There\r\nare few in this part of the country within the former or much beyond the\r\nlatter extent. Unquestionably in other places there are much larger.\r\nBut I am convinced, whatever part of England be the theatre of his\r\noperations, a farmer who cultivates twelve hundred acres, which I\r\nconsider as a large farm, though I know there are larger, cannot proceed\r\nwith any degree of safety and effect with a smaller capital than ten\r\nthousand pounds, and that he cannot, in the ordinary course of culture,\r\nmake more upon that great capital of ten thousand pounds than twelve\r\nhundred a year.\r\n\r\nAs to the weaker capitals, an easy judgment may be formed by what very\r\nsmall errors they may be farther attenuated, enervated, rendered\r\nunproductive, and perhaps totally destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis constant precariousness and ultimate moderate limits of a farmer's\r\nfortune, on the strongest capital, I press, not only on account of the\r\nhazardous speculations of the times, but because the excellent and most\r\nuseful works of my friend, Mr. Arthur Young, tend to propagate that\r\nerror (such I am very certain it is) of the largeness of a farmer's\r\nprofits. It is not that his account of the produce does often greatly\r\nexceed, but he by no means makes the proper allowance for accidents and\r\nlosses. I might enter into a convincing detail, if other more\r\ntroublesome and more necessary details were not before me.\r\n\r\nThis proposed discretionary tax on labor militates with the\r\nrecommendations of the Board of Agriculture: they recommend a general\r\nuse of the drill culture. I agree with the Board, that, where the soil\r\nis not excessively heavy, or incumbered with large loose stones, (which,\r\nhowever, is the case with much otherwise good land,) that course is the\r\nbest and most productive,--provided that the most accurate eye, the most\r\nvigilant superintendence, the most prompt activity, which has no such\r\nday as to-morrow in its calendar, the most steady foresight and\r\npredisposing order to have everybody and everything ready in its place,\r\nand prepared to take advantage of the fortunate, fugitive moment, in\r\nthis coquetting climate of ours,--provided, I say, all these combine to\r\nspeed the plough, I admit its superiority over the old and general\r\nmethods. But under procrastinating, improvident, ordinary husbandmen,\r\nwho may neglect or let slip the few opportunities of sweetening and\r\npurifying their ground with perpetually renovated toil and undissipated\r\nattention, nothing, when tried to any extent, can be worse or more\r\ndangerous: the farm may be ruined, instead of having the soil enriched\r\nand sweetened by it.\r\n\r\nBut the excellence of the method on a proper soil, and conducted by\r\nhusbandmen, of whom there are few, being readily granted, how, and on\r\nwhat conditions, is this culture obtained? Why, by a very great increase\r\nof labor: by an augmentation of the third part, at least, of the\r\nhand-labor, to say nothing of the horses and machinery employed in\r\nordinary tillage. Now every man must be sensible how little becoming the\r\ngravity of legislature it is to encourage a board which recommends to\r\nus, and upon very weighty reasons unquestionably, an enlargement of the\r\ncapital we employ in the operations of the hand, and then to pass an act\r\nwhich taxes that manual labor, already at a very high rate,--thus\r\ncompelling us to diminish the quantity of labor which in the vulgar\r\ncourse we actually employ.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the farmer is equally true of the middle-man,--whether\r\nthe middle-man acts as factor, jobber, salesman, or speculator, in the\r\nmarkets of grain. These traders are to be left to their free course;\r\nand the more they make, and the richer they are, and the more largely\r\nthey deal, the better both for the farmer and consumer, between whom\r\nthey form a natural and most useful link of connection,--though by the\r\nmachinations of the old evil counsellor, _Envy_, they are hated and\r\nmaligned by both parties.\r\n\r\nI hear that middle-men are accused of monopoly. Without question, the\r\nmonopoly of authority is, in every instance and in every degree, an\r\nevil; but the monopoly of capital is the contrary. It is a great\r\nbenefit, and a benefit particularly to the poor. A tradesman who has but\r\na hundred pound capital, which (say) he can turn but once a year, cannot\r\nlive upon a _profit_ of ten per cent, because he cannot live upon ten\r\npounds a year; but a man of ten thousand pounds capital can live and\r\nthrive upon five per cent profit in the year, because he has five\r\nhundred pounds a year. The same proportion holds in turning it twice or\r\nthrice. These principles are plain and simple; and it is not our\r\nignorance, so much as the levity, the envy, and the malignity of our\r\nnature, that hinders us from perceiving and yielding to them: but we are\r\nnot to suffer our vices to usurp the place of our judgment.\r\n\r\nThe balance between consumption and production makes price. The market\r\nsettles, and alone can settle, that price. Market is the meeting and\r\nconference of the _consumer_ and _producer_, when they mutually discover\r\neach other's wants. Nobody, I believe, has observed with any reflection\r\nwhat market is, without being astonished at the truth, the correctness,\r\nthe celerity, the general equity, with which the balance of wants is\r\nsettled. They who wish the destruction of that balance, and would fain\r\nby arbitrary regulation decree that defective production should not be\r\ncompensated by increased price, directly lay their _axe_ to the root of\r\nproduction itself. They may, even in one year of such false policy, do\r\nmischiefs incalculable; because the trade of a farmer is, as I have\r\nbefore explained, one of the most precarious in its advantages, the most\r\nliable to losses, and the least profitable of any that is carried on. It\r\nrequires ten times more of labor, of vigilance, of attention, of skill,\r\nand, let me add, of good fortune also, to carry on the business of a\r\nfarmer with success, than what belongs to any other trade.\r\n\r\nSeeing things in this light, I am far from presuming to censure the late\r\ncircular instruction of Council to lord-lieutenants, but I confess I do\r\nnot clearly discern its object. I am greatly afraid that the inquiry\r\nwill raise some alarm, as a measure leading to the French system of\r\nputting corn into requisition. For that was preceded by an inquisition\r\nsomewhat similar in its principle, though, according to their mode,\r\ntheir principles are full of that violence which _here_ is not much to\r\nbe feared. It goes on a principle directly opposite to mine: it presumes\r\nthat the market is no fair _test_ of plenty or scarcity. It raises a\r\nsuspicion, which may affect the tranquillity of the public mind, \"that\r\nthe farmer keeps back, and takes unfair advantages by delay\"; on the\r\npart of the dealer, it gives rise obviously to a thousand nefarious\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\nIn case the return should on the whole prove favorable, is it meant to\r\nground a measure for encouraging exportation and checking the import of\r\ncorn? If it is not, what end can it answer? And I believe it is not.\r\n\r\nThis opinion may be fortified by a report gone abroad, that intentions\r\nare entertained of erecting public granaries, and that this inquiry is\r\nto give government an advantage in its purchases.\r\n\r\nI hear that such a measure has been proposed, and is under deliberation:\r\nthat is, for government to set up a granary in every market-town, at the\r\nexpense of the state, in order to extinguish the dealer, and to subject\r\nthe farmer to the consumer, by securing corn to the latter at a certain\r\nand steady price.\r\n\r\nIf such a scheme is adopted, I should not like to answer for the safety\r\nof the granary, of the agents, or of the town itself in which the\r\ngranary was erected: the first storm of popular frenzy would fall upon\r\nthat granary.\r\n\r\nSo far in a political light.\r\n\r\nIn an economical light, I must observe that the construction of such\r\ngranaries throughout the kingdom would be at an expense beyond all\r\ncalculation. The keeping them up would be at a great charge. The\r\nmanagement and attendance would require an army of agents,\r\nstore-keepers, clerks, and servants. The capital to be employed in the\r\npurchase of grain would be enormous. The waste, decay, and corruption\r\nwould be a dreadful drawback on the whole dealing; and the\r\ndissatisfaction of the people, at having decayed, tainted, or corrupted\r\ncorn sold to them, as must be the case, would be serious.\r\n\r\nThis climate (whatever others may be) is not favorable to granaries,\r\nwhere wheat is to be kept for any time. The best, and indeed the only\r\ngood granary, is the rick-yard of the farmer, where the corn is\r\npreserved in its own straw, sweet, clean, wholesome, free from vermin\r\nand from insects, and comparatively at a trifle of expense. This, and\r\nthe barn, enjoying many of the same advantages, have been the sole\r\ngranaries of England from the foundation of its agriculture to this day.\r\nAll this is done at the expense of the undertaker, and at his sole risk.\r\nHe contributes to government, he receives nothing from it but\r\nprotection, and to this he has a _claim_.\r\n\r\nThe moment that government appears at market, all the principles of\r\nmarket will be subverted. I don't know whether the farmer will suffer by\r\nit, as long as there is a tolerable market of competition; but I am\r\nsure, that, in the first place, the trading government will speedily\r\nbecome a bankrupt, and the consumer in the end will suffer. If\r\ngovernment makes all its purchases at once, it will instantly raise the\r\nmarket upon itself. If it makes them by degrees, it must follow the\r\ncourse of the market. If it follows the course of the market, it will\r\nproduce no effect, and the consumer may as well buy as he wants;\r\ntherefore all the expense is incurred gratis.\r\n\r\nBut if the object of this scheme should be, what I suspect it is, to\r\ndestroy the dealer, commonly called the middle-man, and by incurring a\r\nvoluntary loss to carry the baker to deal with government, I am to tell\r\nthem that they must set up another trade, that of a miller or a\r\nmeal-man, attended with a new train of expenses and risks. If in both\r\nthese trades they should succeed, so as to exclude those who trade on\r\nnatural and private capitals, then they will have a monopoly in their\r\nhands, which, under the appearance of a monopoly of capital, will, in\r\nreality, be a monopoly of authority, and will ruin whatever it touches.\r\nThe agriculture of the kingdom cannot stand before it.\r\n\r\nA little place like Geneva, of not more than from twenty-five to thirty\r\nthousand inhabitants,--which has no territory, or next to none,--which\r\ndepends for its existence on the good-will of three neighboring powers,\r\nand is of course continually in the state of something like a _siege_,\r\nor in the speculation of it,--might find some resource in state\r\ngranaries, and some revenue from the monopoly of what was sold to the\r\nkeepers of public-houses. This is a policy for a state too small for\r\nagriculture. It is not (for instance) fit for so great a country as the\r\nPope possesses,--where, however, it is adopted and pursued in a greater\r\nextent, and with more strictness. Certain of the Pope's territories,\r\nfrom whence the city of Rome is supplied, being obliged to furnish Rome\r\nand the granaries of his Holiness with corn at a certain price, that\r\npart of the Papal territories is utterly ruined. That ruin may be traced\r\nwith certainty to this sole cause; and it appears indubitably by a\r\ncomparison of their state and condition with that of the other part of\r\nthe ecclesiastical dominions, not subjected to the same regulations,\r\nwhich are in circumstances highly flourishing.\r\n\r\nThe reformation of this evil system is in a manner impracticable. For,\r\nfirst, it does keep bread and all other provisions equally subject to\r\nthe chamber of supply, at a pretty reasonable and regular price, in the\r\ncity of Rome. This preserves quiet among the numerous poor, idle, and\r\nnaturally mutinous people of a very great capital. But the quiet of the\r\ntown is purchased by the ruin of the country and the ultimate\r\nwretchedness of both. The next cause which renders this evil incurable\r\nis the jobs which have grown out of it, and which, in spite of all\r\nprecautions, would grow out of such things even under governments far\r\nmore potent than the feeble authority of the Pope.\r\n\r\nThis example of Rome, which has been derived from the most ancient\r\ntimes, and the most flourishing period of the Roman Empire, (but not of\r\nthe Roman agriculture,) may serve as a great caution to all governments\r\nnot to attempt to feed the people out of the hands of the magistrates.\r\nIf once they are habituated to it, though but for one half-year, they\r\nwill never be satisfied to have it otherwise. And having looked to\r\ngovernment for bread, on the very first scarcity they will turn and bite\r\nthe hand that fed them. To avoid that _evil_, government will redouble\r\nthe causes of it; and then it will become inveterate and incurable.\r\n\r\nI beseech the government (which I take in the largest sense of the word,\r\ncomprehending the two Houses of Parliament) seriously to consider that\r\nyears of scarcity or plenty do not come alternately or at short\r\nintervals, but in pretty long cycles and irregularly, and consequently\r\nthat we cannot assure ourselves, if we take a wrong measure, from the\r\ntemporary necessities of one season, but that the next, and probably\r\nmore, will drive us to the continuance of it; so that, in my opinion,\r\nthere is no way of preventing this evil, which goes to the destruction\r\nof all our agriculture, and of that part of our internal commerce which\r\ntouches our agriculture the most nearly, as well as the safety and very\r\nbeing of government, but manfully to resist the very first idea,\r\nspeculative or practical, that it is within the competence of\r\ngovernment, taken as government, or even of the rich, as rich, to supply\r\nto the poor those necessaries which it has pleased the Divine\r\nProvidence for a while to withhold from them. We, the people, ought to\r\nbe made sensible that it is not in breaking the laws of commerce, which\r\nare the laws of Nature, and consequently the laws of God, that we are to\r\nplace our hope of softening the Divine displeasure to remove any\r\ncalamity under which we suffer or which hangs over us.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the principles of general policy.\r\n\r\nAs to the state of things which is urged as a reason to deviate from\r\nthem, these are the circumstances of the harvest of 1794 and 1795. With\r\nregard to the harvest of 1794, in relation to the noblest grain, wheat,\r\nit is allowed to have been somewhat short, but not excessively,--and in\r\nquality, for the seven-and-twenty years during which I have been a\r\nfarmer, I never remember wheat to have been so good. The world were,\r\nhowever, deceived in their speculations upon it,--the farmer as well as\r\nthe dealer. Accordingly the price fluctuated beyond anything I can\r\nremember: for at one time of the year I sold my wheat at 14_l._ a load,\r\n(I sold off all I had, as I thought this was a reasonable price,) when\r\nat the end of the season, if I had then had any to sell, I might have\r\ngot thirty guineas for the same sort of grain. I sold all that I had, as\r\nI said, at a comparatively low price, because I thought it a good price,\r\ncompared with what I thought the general produce of the harvest; but\r\nwhen I came to consider what my own _total_ was, I found that the\r\nquantity had not answered my expectation. It must be remembered that\r\nthis year of produce, (the year 1794,) short, but excellent, followed a\r\nyear which was not extraordinary in production, nor of a superior\r\nquality, and left but little in store. At first, this was not felt,\r\nbecause the harvest came in unusually early,--earlier than common by a\r\nfull month.\r\n\r\nThe winter, at the end of 1794 and beginning of 1795, was more than\r\nusually unfavorable both to corn and grass, owing to the sudden\r\nrelaxation of very rigorous frosts, followed by rains, which were again\r\nrapidly succeeded by frosts of still greater rigor than the first.\r\n\r\nMuch wheat was utterly destroyed. The clover-grass suffered in many\r\nplaces. What I never observed before, the rye-grass, or coarse bent,\r\nsuffered more than the clover. Even the meadow-grass in some places was\r\nkilled to the very roots. In the spring appearances were better than we\r\nexpected. All the early sown grain recovered itself, and came up with\r\ngreat vigor; but that which was late sown was feeble, and did not\r\npromise to resist any blights in the spring, which, however, with all\r\nits unpleasant vicissitudes, passed off very well; and nothing looked\r\nbetter than the wheat at the time of blooming;--but at that most\r\ncritical time of all, a cold, dry east wind, attended with very sharp\r\nfrosts, longer and stronger than I recollect at that time of year,\r\ndestroyed the flowers, and withered up, in an astonishing manner, the\r\nwhole side of the ear next to the wind. At that time I brought to town\r\nsome of the ears, for the purpose of showing to my friends the operation\r\nof those unnatural frosts, and according to their extent I predicted a\r\ngreat scarcity. But such is the pleasure of agreeable prospects, that my\r\nopinion was little regarded.\r\n\r\nOn threshing, I found things as I expected,--the ears not filled, some\r\nof the capsules quite empty, and several others containing only\r\nwithered, hungry grain, inferior to the appearance of rye. My best ears\r\nand grain were not fine; never had I grain of so low a quality: yet I\r\nsold one load for 21_l._ At the same time I bought my seed wheat (it was\r\nexcellent) at 23_l._ Since then the price has risen, and I have sold\r\nabout two load of the same sort at 23_l._ Such was the state of the\r\nmarket when I left home last Monday. Little remains in my barn. I hope\r\nsome in the rick may be better, since it was earlier sown, as well as I\r\ncan recollect. Some of my neighbors have better, some quite as bad, or\r\neven worse. I suspect it will be found, that, wherever the blighting\r\nwind and those frosts at blooming-time have prevailed, the produce of\r\nthe wheat crop will turn out very indifferent. Those parts which have\r\nescaped will, I can hardly doubt, have a reasonable produce.\r\n\r\nAs to the other grains, it is to be observed, as the wheat ripened very\r\nlate, (on account, I conceive, of the blights,) the barley got the start\r\nof it, and was ripe first. The crop was with me, and wherever my inquiry\r\ncould reach, excellent; in some places far superior to mine.\r\n\r\nThe clover, which came up with the barley, was the finest I remember to\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nThe turnips of this year are generally good.\r\n\r\nThe clover sown last year, where not totally destroyed, gave two good\r\ncrops, or one crop and a plentiful feed; and, bating the loss of the\r\nrye-grass, I do not remember a better produce.\r\n\r\nThe meadow-grass yielded but a middling crop, and neither of the sown or\r\nnatural grass was there in any farmer's possession any remainder from\r\nthe year worth taking into account. In most places there was none at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOats with me were not in a quantity more considerable than in commonly\r\ngood seasons; but I have never known them heavier than they were in\r\nother places. The oat was not only an heavy, but an uncommonly abundant\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nMy ground under pease did not exceed an acre or thereabouts, but the\r\ncrop was great indeed. I believe it is throughout the country exuberant.\r\nIt is, however, to be remarked, as generally of all the grains, so\r\nparticularly of the pease, that there was not the smallest quantity in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThe demand of the year must depend solely on its own produce; and the\r\nprice of the spring corn is not to be expected to fall very soon, or at\r\nany time very low.\r\n\r\nUxbridge is a great corn market. As I came through that town, I found\r\nthat at the last market-day barley was at forty shillings a quarter.\r\nOats there were literally none; and the inn-keeper was obliged to send\r\nfor them to London. I forgot to ask about pease. Potatoes were 5_s_. the\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\nIn the debate on this subject in the House, I am told that a leading\r\nmember of great ability, _little conversant in these matters_, observed,\r\nthat the general uniform dearness of butcher's meat, butter, and cheese\r\ncould not be owing to a defective produce of wheat; and on this ground\r\ninsinuated a suspicion of some unfair practice on the subject, that\r\ncalled for inquiry.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, the mere deficiency of wheat could not cause the\r\ndearness of the other articles, which extends not only to the provisions\r\nhe mentioned, but to every other without exception.\r\n\r\nThe cause is, indeed, so very plain and obvious that the wonder is the\r\nother way. When a properly directed inquiry is made, the gentlemen who\r\nare amazed at the price of these commodities will find, that, when hay\r\nis at six pound a load, as they must know it is, herbage, and for more\r\nthan one year, must be scanty; and they will conclude, that, if grass be\r\nscarce, beef, veal, mutton, butter, milk, and cheese _must_ be dear.\r\n\r\nBut to take up the matter somewhat more in detail.--If the wheat harvest\r\nin 1794, excellent in quality, was defective in quantity, the barley\r\nharvest was in quality ordinary enough, and in quantity deficient. This\r\nwas soon felt in the price of malt.\r\n\r\nAnother article of produce (beans) was not at all plentiful. The crop of\r\npease was wholly destroyed, so that several farmers pretty early gave up\r\nall hopes on that head, and cut the green haulm as fodder for the\r\ncattle, then perishing for want of food in that dry and burning summer.\r\nI myself came off better than most: I had about the fourth of a crop of\r\npease.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected, that, in a manner, all the bacon and pork\r\nconsumed in this country (the far largest consumption of meat out of\r\ntowns) is, when growing, fed on grass, and on whey or skimmed milk,--and\r\nwhen fatting, partly on the latter. This is the case in the dairy\r\ncountries, all of them great breeders and feeders of swine; but for the\r\nmuch greater part, and in all the corn countries, they are fattened on\r\nbeans, barley-meal, and pease. When the food of the animal is scarce,\r\nhis flesh must be dear. This, one would suppose, would require no great\r\npenetration to discover.\r\n\r\nThis failure of so very large a supply of flesh in one species naturally\r\nthrows the whole demand of the consumer on the diminished supply of all\r\nkinds of flesh, and, indeed, on all the matters of human sustenance.\r\nNor, in my opinion, are we to expect a greater cheapness in that article\r\nfor this year, even though corn should grow cheaper, as it is to be\r\nhoped it will. The store swine, from the failure of subsistence last\r\nyear, are now at an extravagant price. Pigs, at our fairs, have sold\r\nlately for fifty shillings, which two years ago would not have brought\r\nmore than twenty.\r\n\r\nAs to sheep, none, I thought, were strangers to the general failure of\r\nthe article of turnips last year: the early having been burned, as they\r\ncame up, by the great drought and heat; the late, and those of the early\r\nwhich had escaped, were destroyed by the chilling frosts of the winter\r\nand the wet and severe weather of the spring. In many places a full\r\nfourth of the sheep or the lambs were lost; what remained of the lambs\r\nwere poor and ill fed, the ewes having had no milk. The calves came\r\nlate, and they were generally an article the want of which was as much\r\nto be dreaded as any other. So that article of food, formerly so\r\nabundant in the early part of the summer, particularly in London, and\r\nwhich in a great part supplied the place of mutton for near two months,\r\ndid little less than totally fail.\r\n\r\nAll the productions of the earth link in with each other. All the\r\nsources of plenty, in all and every article, were dried or frozen up.\r\nThe scarcity was not, as gentlemen seem to suppose, in wheat only.\r\n\r\nAnother cause, and that not of inconsiderable operation, tended to\r\nproduce a scarcity in flesh provision. It is one that on many accounts\r\ncannot be too much regretted, and the rather, as it was the sole _cause_\r\nof a scarcity in that article which arose from the proceedings of men\r\nthemselves: I mean the stop put to the distillery.\r\n\r\nThe hogs (and that would be sufficient) which were fed with the waste\r\nwash of that produce did not demand the fourth part of the corn used by\r\nfarmers in fattening them. The spirit was nearly so much clear gain to\r\nthe nation. It is an odd way of making flesh cheap, to stop or check the\r\ndistillery.\r\n\r\nThe distillery in itself produces an immense article of trade almost all\r\nover the world,--to Africa, to North America, and to various parts of\r\nEurope. It is of great use, next to food itself, to our fisheries and to\r\nour whole navigation. A great part of the distillery was carried on by\r\ndamaged corn, unfit for bread, and by barley and malt of the lowest\r\nquality. These things could not be more unexceptionably employed. The\r\ndomestic consumption of spirits produced, without complaints, a very\r\ngreat revenue, applicable, if we pleased, in bounties, to the bringing\r\ncorn from other places, far beyond the value of that consumed in making\r\nit, or to the encouragement of its increased production at home.\r\n\r\nAs to what is said, in a physical and moral view, against the home\r\nconsumption of spirits, experience has long since taught me very little\r\nto respect the declamations on that subject. Whether the thunder of the\r\nlaws or the thunder of eloquence \"is hurled on _gin_\" always I am\r\nthunder-proof. The alembic, in my mind, has furnished to the world a far\r\ngreater benefit and blessing than if the _opus maximum_ had been really\r\nfound by chemistry, and, like Midas, we could turn everything into gold.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there may be a dangerous abuse in the excess of spirits; and\r\nat one time I am ready to believe the abuse was great. When spirits are\r\ncheap, the business of drunkenness is achieved with little time or\r\nlabor; but that evil I consider to be wholly done away. Observation for\r\nthe last forty years, and very particularly for the last thirty, has\r\nfurnished me with ten instances of drunkenness from other causes for one\r\nfrom this. Ardent spirit is a great medicine, often to remove\r\ndistempers, much more frequently to prevent them, or to chase them away\r\nin their beginnings. It is not nutritive in _any great_ degree. But if\r\nnot food, it greatly alleviates the want of it. It invigorates the\r\nstomach for the digestion of poor, meagre diet, not easily alliable to\r\nthe human constitution. Wine the poor cannot touch. Beer, as applied to\r\nmany occasions, (as among seamen and fishermen, for instance,) will by\r\nno means do the business. Let me add, what wits inspired with champagne\r\nand claret will turn into ridicule,--it is a medicine for the mind.\r\nUnder the pressure of the cares and sorrows of our mortal condition, men\r\nhave at all times and in all countries called in some physical aid to\r\ntheir moral consolations,--wine, beer, opium, brandy, or tobacco.\r\n\r\nI consider, therefore, the stopping of the distillery, economically,\r\nfinancially, commercially, medicinally, and in some degree morally too,\r\nas a measure rather well meant than well considered. It is too precious\r\na sacrifice to prejudice.\r\n\r\nGentlemen well know whether there be a scarcity of partridges, and\r\nwhether that be an effect of hoarding and combination. All the tame race\r\nof birds live and die as the wild do.\r\n\r\nAs to the lesser articles, they are like the greater. They have followed\r\nthe fortune of the season. Why are fowls dear? Was not this the farmer's\r\nor jobber's fault? I sold from my yard to a jobber six young and lean\r\nfowls for four-and-twenty shillings,--fowls for which two years ago the\r\nsame man would not have given a shilling apiece. He sold them afterwards\r\nat Uxbridge, and they were taken to London to receive the last hand.\r\n\r\nAs to the operation of the war in causing the scarcity of provisions, I\r\nunderstand that Mr. Pitt has given a particular answer to it; but I do\r\nnot think it worth powder and shot.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder the papers are so full of this sort of matter, but I am\r\na little surprised it should be mentioned in Parliament. Like all great\r\nstate questions, peace and war may be discussed, and different opinions\r\nfairly formed, on political grounds; but on a question of the present\r\nprice of provisions, when peace with the Regicides is always uppermost,\r\nI can only say that great is the love of it.\r\n\r\nAfter all, have we not reason to be thankful to the Giver of all Good?\r\nIn our history, and when \"the laborer of England is said to have been\r\nonce happy,\" we find constantly, after certain intervals, a period of\r\nreal famine, by which a melancholy havoc was made among the human race.\r\nThe price of provisions fluctuated dreadfully, demonstrating a\r\ndeficiency very different from the worst failures of the present moment.\r\nNever, since I have known England, have I known more than a comparative\r\nscarcity. The price of wheat, taking a number of years together, has had\r\nno very considerable fluctuation; nor has it risen exceedingly until\r\nwithin this twelvemonth. Even now, I do not know of one man, woman, or\r\nchild that has perished from famine: fewer, if any, I believe, than in\r\nyears of plenty, when such a thing may happen by accident. This is owing\r\nto a care and superintendence of the poor, far greater than any I\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this ought to bind us all, rich and poor together,\r\nagainst those wicked writers of the newspapers who would inflame the\r\npoor against their friends, guardians, patrons, and protectors. Not only\r\nvery few (I have observed that I know of none, though I live in a place\r\nas poor as most) have actually died of want, but we have seen no traces\r\nof those dreadful exterminating epidemics which, in consequence of\r\nscanty and unwholesome food, in former times not unfrequently wasted\r\nwhole nations. Let us be saved from too much wisdom of our own, and we\r\nshall do tolerably well.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the finest problems in legislation, and what has often\r\nengaged my thoughts whilst I followed that profession,--What the state\r\nought to take upon itself to direct by the public wisdom, and what it\r\nought to leave, with as little interference as possible, to individual\r\ndiscretion. Nothing, certainly, can be laid down on the subject that\r\nwill not admit of exceptions,--many permanent, some occasional. But the\r\nclearest line of distinction which I could draw, whilst I had my chalk\r\nto draw any line, was this: that the state ought to confine itself to\r\nwhat regards the state or the creatures of the state: namely, the\r\nexterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its\r\nmilitary force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their\r\nexistence to its fiat; in a word, to everything that is _truly and\r\nproperly_ public,--to the public peace, to the public safety, to the\r\npublic order, to the public prosperity. In its preventive police it\r\nought to be sparing of its efforts, and to employ means, rather few,\r\nunfrequent, and strong, than many, and frequent, and, of course, as\r\nthey multiply their puny politic race, and dwindle, small and feeble.\r\nStatesmen who know themselves will, with the dignity which belongs to\r\nwisdom, proceed only in this the superior orb and first mover of their\r\nduty, steadily, vigilantly, severely, courageously: whatever remains\r\nwill, in a manner, provide for itself. But as they descend from the\r\nstate to a province, from a province to a parish, and from a parish to a\r\nprivate house, they go on accelerated in their fall. They _cannot_ do\r\nthe lower duty; and in proportion as they try it, they will certainly\r\nfail in the higher. They ought to know the different departments of\r\nthings,--what belongs to laws, and what manners alone can regulate. To\r\nthese great politicians may give a leaning, but they cannot give a law.\r\n\r\nOur legislature has fallen into this fault, as well as other\r\ngovernments: all have fallen into it more or less. The once mighty state\r\nwhich was nearest to us locally, nearest to us in every way, and whose\r\nruins threaten to fall upon our heads, is a strong instance of this\r\nerror. I can never quote France without a foreboding sigh,--ΈΣΣΕΤΑΙ ΉΜΑΡ\r\nScipio said it to his recording Greek friend amidst the\r\nflames of the great rival of his country. That state has fallen by the\r\nhands of the parricides of their country, called the Revolutionists and\r\nConstitutionalists of France: a species of traitors, of whose fury and\r\natrocious wickedness nothing in the annals of the frenzy and depravation\r\nof mankind had before furnished an example, and of whom I can never\r\nthink or speak without a mixed sensation of disgust, of horror, and of\r\ndetestation, not easy to be expressed. These nefarious monsters\r\ndestroyed their country for what was good in it: for much good there was\r\nin the Constitution of that noble monarchy, which, in all kinds, formed\r\nand nourished great men, and great patterns of virtue to the world. But\r\nthough its enemies were not enemies to its faults, its faults furnished\r\nthem with means for its destruction. My dear departed friend, whose loss\r\nis even greater to the public than to me, had often remarked, that the\r\nleading vice of the French monarchy (which he had well studied) was in\r\ngood intention ill-directed, and a restless desire of governing too\r\nmuch. The hand of authority was seen in everything and in every place.\r\nAll, therefore, that happened amiss, in the course even of domestic\r\naffairs, was attributed to the government; and as it always happens in\r\nthis kind of officious universal interference, what began in odious\r\npower ended always, I may say without an exception, in contemptible\r\nimbecility. For this reason, as far as I can approve of any novelty, I\r\nthought well of the provincial administrations. Those, if the superior\r\npower had been severe and vigilant and vigorous, might have been of much\r\nuse politically in removing government from many invidious details. But\r\nas everything is good or bad as it is related or combined, government\r\nbeing relaxed above as it was relaxed below, and the brains of the\r\npeople growing more and more addle with every sort of visionary\r\nspeculation, the shiftings of the scene in the provincial theatres\r\nbecame only preparatives to a revolution in the kingdom, and the popular\r\nactings there only the rehearsals of the terrible drama of the Republic.\r\n\r\nTyranny and cruelty may make men justly wish the downfall of abused\r\npowers, but I believe that no government ever yet perished from any\r\nother direct cause than its own weakness. My opinion is against an\r\noverdoing of any sort of administration, and more especially against\r\nthis most momentous of all meddling on the part of authority,--the\r\nmeddling with the subsistence of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nLETTER TO A NOBLE LORD\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nTHE ATTACKS MADE UPON MR. BURKE AND HIS PENSION, IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS,\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nTHE DUKE OF BEDFORD AND THE EARL OF LAUDERDALE,\r\n\r\nEARLY IN THE PRESENT SESSION OF PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy lord,--I could hardly flatter myself with the hope that so very early\r\nin the season I should have to acknowledge obligations to the Duke of\r\nBedford and to the Earl of Lauderdale. These noble persons have lost no\r\ntime in conferring upon me that sort of honor which it is alone within\r\ntheir competence, and which it is certainly most congenial to their\r\nnature and their manners, to bestow.\r\n\r\nTo be ill spoken of, in whatever language they speak, by the zealots of\r\nthe new sect in philosophy and politics, of which these noble persons\r\nthink so charitably, and of which others think so justly, to me is no\r\nmatter of uneasiness or surprise. To have incurred the displeasure of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans or the Duke of Bedford, to fall under the censure of\r\nCitizen Brissot or of his friend the Earl of Lauderdale, I ought to\r\nconsider as proofs, not the least satisfactory, that I have produced\r\nsome part of the effect I proposed by my endeavors. I have labored hard\r\nto earn what the noble Lords are generous enough to pay. Personal\r\noffence I have given them none. The part they take against me is from\r\nzeal to the cause. It is well,--it is perfectly well. I have to do\r\nhomage to their justice. I have to thank the Bedfords and the\r\nLauderdales for having so faithfully and so fully acquitted towards me\r\nwhatever arrear of debt was left undischarged by the Priestleys and the\r\nPaines.\r\n\r\nSome, perhaps, may think them executors in their own wrong: I at least\r\nhave nothing to complain of. They have gone beyond the demands of\r\njustice. They have been (a little, perhaps, beyond their intention)\r\nfavorable to me. They have been the means of bringing out by their\r\ninvectives the handsome things which Lord Grenville has had the goodness\r\nand condescension to say in my behalf. Retired as I am from the world,\r\nand from all its affairs and all its pleasures, I confess it does kindle\r\nin my nearly extinguished feelings a very vivid satisfaction to be so\r\nattacked and so commended. It is soothing to my wounded mind to be\r\ncommended by an able, vigorous, and well-informed statesman, and at the\r\nvery moment when he stands forth, with a manliness and resolution worthy\r\nof himself and of his cause, for the preservation of the person and\r\ngovernment of our sovereign, and therein for the security of the laws,\r\nthe liberties, the morals, and the lives of his people. To be in any\r\nfair way connected with such things is indeed a distinction. No\r\nphilosophy can make me above it: no melancholy can depress me so low as\r\nto make me wholly insensible to such an honor.\r\n\r\nWhy will they not let me remain in obscurity and inaction? Are they\r\napprehensive, that, if an atom of me remains, the sect has something to\r\nfear? Must I be annihilated, lest, like old John Zisca's, my skin might\r\nbe made into a drum, to animate Europe to eternal battle against a\r\ntyranny that threatens to overwhelm all Europe and all the human race?\r\n\r\nMy Lord, it is a subject of awful meditation. Before this of France,\r\nthe annals of all time have not furnished an instance of a _complete_\r\nrevolution. That revolution seems to have extended even to the\r\nconstitution of the mind of man. It has this of wonderful in it, that it\r\nresembles what Lord Verulam says of the operations of Nature: It was\r\nperfect, not only in its elements and principles, but in all its members\r\nand its organs, from the very beginning. The moral scheme of France\r\nfurnishes the only pattern ever known which they who admire will\r\n_instantly_ resemble. It is, indeed, an inexhaustible repertory of one\r\nkind of examples. In my wretched condition, though hardly to be classed\r\nwith the living, I am not safe from them. They have tigers to fall upon\r\nanimated strength; they have hyenas to prey upon carcasses. The national\r\nmenagerie is collected by the first physiologists of the time; and it is\r\ndefective in no description of savage nature. They pursue even such as\r\nme into the obscurest retreats, and haul them before their revolutionary\r\ntribunals. Neither sex, nor age, nor the sanctuary of the tomb, is\r\nsacred to them. They have so determined a hatred to all privileged\r\norders, that they deny even to the departed the sad immunities of the\r\ngrave. They are not wholly without an object. Their turpitude purveys to\r\ntheir malice; and they unplumb the dead for bullets to assassinate the\r\nliving. If all revolutionists were not proof against all caution, I\r\nshould recommend it to their consideration, that no persons were ever\r\nknown in history, either sacred or profane, to vex the sepulchre, and by\r\ntheir sorceries to call up the prophetic dead, with any other event than\r\nthe prediction of their own disastrous fate.--\"Leave me, oh, leave me to\r\nrepose!\"\r\n\r\nIn one thing I can excuse the Duke of Bedford for his attack upon me and\r\nmy mortuary pension: He cannot readily comprehend the transaction he\r\ncondemns. What I have obtained was the fruit of no bargain, the\r\nproduction of no intrigue, the result of no compromise, the effect of no\r\nsolicitation. The first suggestion of it never came from me, mediately\r\nor immediately, to his Majesty or any of his ministers. It was long\r\nknown that the instant my engagements would permit it, and before the\r\nheaviest of all calamities had forever condemned me to obscurity and\r\nsorrow, I had resolved on a total retreat. I had executed that design. I\r\nwas entirely out of the way of serving or of hurting any statesman or\r\nany party, when the ministers so generously and so nobly carried into\r\neffect the spontaneous bounty of the crown. Both descriptions have acted\r\nas became them. When I could no longer serve them, the ministers have\r\nconsidered my situation. When I could no longer hurt them, the\r\nrevolutionists have trampled on my infirmity. My gratitude, I trust, is\r\nequal to the manner in which the benefit was conferred. It came to me,\r\nindeed, at a time of life, and in a state of mind and body, in which no\r\ncircumstance of fortune could afford me any real pleasure. But this was\r\nno fault in the royal donor, or in his ministers, who were pleased, in\r\nacknowledging the merits of an invalid servant of the public, to assuage\r\nthe sorrows of a desolate old man.\r\n\r\nIt would ill become me to boast of anything. It would as ill become me,\r\nthus called upon, to depreciate the value of a long life spent with\r\nunexampled toil in the service of my country. Since the total body of my\r\nservices, on account of the industry which was shown in them, and the\r\nfairness of my intentions, have obtained the acceptance of my sovereign,\r\nit would be absurd in me to range myself on the side of the Duke of\r\nBedford and the Corresponding Society, or, as far as in me lies, to\r\npermit a dispute on the rate at which the authority appointed by _our_\r\nConstitution to estimate such things has been pleased to set them.\r\n\r\nLoose libels ought to be passed by in silence and contempt. By me they\r\nhave been so always. I knew, that, as long as I remained in public, I\r\nshould live down the calumnies of malice and the judgments of ignorance.\r\nIf I happened to be now and then in the wrong, (as who is not?) like all\r\nother men, I must bear the consequence of my faults and my mistakes. The\r\nlibels of the present day are just of the same stuff as the libels of\r\nthe past. But they derive an importance from the rank of the persons\r\nthey come from, and the gravity of the place where they were uttered. In\r\nsome way or other I ought to take some notice of them. To assert myself\r\nthus traduced is not vanity or arrogance. It is a demand of justice; it\r\nis a demonstration of gratitude. If I am unworthy, the ministers are\r\nworse than prodigal. On that hypothesis, I perfectly agree with the Duke\r\nof Bedford.\r\n\r\nFor whatever I have been (I am now no more) I put myself on my country.\r\nI ought to be allowed a reasonable freedom, because I stand upon my\r\ndeliverance; and no culprit ought to plead in irons. Even in the utmost\r\nlatitude of defensive liberty, I wish to preserve all possible decorum.\r\nWhatever it may be in the eyes of these noble persons themselves, to me\r\ntheir situation calls for the most profound respect. If I should happen\r\nto trespass a little, which I trust I shall not, let it always be\r\nsupposed that a confusion of characters may produce mistakes,--that, in\r\nthe masquerades of the grand carnival of our age, whimsical adventures\r\nhappen, odd things are said and pass off. If I should fail a single\r\npoint in the high respect I owe to those illustrious persons, I cannot\r\nbe supposed to mean the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale of\r\nthe House of Peers, but the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale\r\nof Palace Yard,--the Dukes and Earls of Brentford. There they are on the\r\npavement; there they seem to come nearer to my humble level, and,\r\nvirtually at least, to have waived their high privilege.\r\n\r\nMaking this protestation, I refuse all revolutionary tribunals, where\r\nmen have been put to death for no other reason than that they had\r\nobtained favors from the crown. I claim, not the letter, but the spirit\r\nof the old English law,--that is, to be tried by my peers. I decline his\r\nGrace's jurisdiction as a judge. I challenge the Duke of Bedford as a\r\njuror to pass upon the value of my services. Whatever his natural parts\r\nmay be, I cannot recognize in his few and idle years the competence to\r\njudge of my long and laborious life. If I can help it, he shall not be\r\non the inquest of my _quantum meruit_. Poor rich man! he can hardly know\r\nanything of public industry in its exertions, or can estimate its\r\ncompensations when its work is done. I have no doubt of his Grace's\r\nreadiness in all the calculations of vulgar arithmetic; but I shrewdly\r\nsuspect that he is little studied in the theory of moral proportions,\r\nand has never learned the rule of three in the arithmetic of policy and\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nHis Grace thinks I have obtained too much. I answer, that my exertions,\r\nwhatever they have been, were such as no hopes of pecuniary reward could\r\npossibly excite; and no pecuniary compensation can possibly reward them.\r\nBetween money and such services, if done by abler men than I am, there\r\nis no common principle of comparison: they are quantities\r\nincommensurable. Money is made for the comfort and convenience of animal\r\nlife. It cannot be a reward for what mere animal life must, indeed,\r\nsustain, but never can inspire. With submission to his Grace, I have not\r\nhad more than sufficient. As to any noble use, I trust I know how to\r\nemploy as well as he a much greater fortune than he possesses. In a more\r\nconfined application, I certainly stand in need of every kind of relief\r\nand easement much more than he does. When I say I have not received more\r\nthan I deserve, is this the language I hold to Majesty? No! Far, very\r\nfar, from it! Before that presence I claim no merit at all. Everything\r\ntowards me is favor and bounty. One style to a gracious benefactor;\r\nanother to a proud and insulting foe.\r\n\r\nHis Grace is pleased to aggravate my guilt by charging my acceptance of\r\nhis Majesty's grant as a departure from my ideas and the spirit of my\r\nconduct with regard to economy. If it be, my ideas of economy wore false\r\nand ill-founded. But they are the Duke of Bedford's ideas of economy I\r\nhave contradicted, and not my own. If he means to allude to certain\r\nbills brought in by me on a message from the throne in 1782, I tell him\r\nthat there is nothing in my conduct that can contradict either the\r\nletter or the spirit of those acts. Does he mean the Pay-Office Act? I\r\ntake it for granted he does not. The act to which he alludes is, I\r\nsuppose, the Establishment Act. I greatly doubt whether his Grace has\r\never read the one or the other. The first of these systems cost me, with\r\nevery assistance which my then situation gave me, pains incredible. I\r\nfound an opinion common through all the offices, and general in the\r\npublic at large, that it would prove impossible to reform and methodize\r\nthe office of pay-master-general. I undertook it, however; and I\r\nsucceeded in my undertaking. Whether the military service, or whether\r\nthe general economy of our finances have profited by that act, I leave\r\nto those who are acquainted with the army and with the treasury to\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nAn opinion full as general prevailed also, at the same time, that\r\nnothing could be done for the regulation of the civil list\r\nestablishment. The very attempt to introduce method into it, and any\r\nlimitations to its services, was held absurd. I had not seen the man who\r\nso much as suggested one economical principle or an economical expedient\r\nupon that subject. Nothing but coarse amputation or coarser taxation\r\nwere then talked of, both of them without design, combination, or the\r\nleast shadow of principle. Blind and headlong zeal or factious fury were\r\nthe whole contribution brought by the most noisy, on that occasion,\r\ntowards the satisfaction of the public or the relief of the crown.\r\n\r\nLet me tell my youthful censor, that the necessities of that time\r\nrequired something very different from what others then suggested or\r\nwhat his Grace now conceives. Let me inform him, that it was one of the\r\nmost critical periods in our annals.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have supposed, that, if a certain comet, whose path\r\nintersected the ecliptic, had met the earth in some (I forgot what)\r\nsign, it would have whirled us along with it, in its eccentric course,\r\ninto God knows what regions of heat and cold. Had the portentous comet\r\nof the Rights of Man, (which \"from its horrid hair shakes pestilence and\r\nwar,\" and \"with fear of change perplexes monarchs,\") had that comet\r\ncrossed upon us in that internal state of England, nothing human could\r\nhave prevented our being irresistibly hurried out of the highway of\r\nheaven into all the vices, crimes, horrors, and miseries of the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nHappily, France was not then Jacobinized. Her hostility was at a good\r\ndistance. We had a limb cut off, but we preserved the body: we lost our\r\ncolonies, but we kept our Constitution. There was, indeed, much\r\nintestine heat; there was a dreadful fermentation. Wild and savage\r\ninsurrection quitted the woods, and prowled about our streets in the\r\nname of Reform. Such was the distemper of the public mind, that there\r\nwas no madman, in his maddest ideas and maddest projects, who might not\r\ncount upon numbers to support his principles and execute his designs.\r\n\r\nMany of the changes, by a great misnomer called Parliamentary Reforms,\r\nwent, not in the intention of all the professors and supporters of them,\r\nundoubtedly, but went in their certain, and, in my opinion, not very\r\nremote effect, home to the utter destruction of the Constitution of this\r\nkingdom. Had they taken place, not France, but England, would have had\r\nthe honor of leading up the death-dance of democratic revolution. Other\r\nprojects, exactly coincident in time with those, struck at the very\r\nexistence of the kingdom under any Constitution. There are who remember\r\nthe blind fury of some and the lamentable helplessness of others; here,\r\na torpid confusion, from a panic fear of the danger,--there, the same\r\ninaction, from a stupid insensibility to it; here, well-wishers to the\r\nmischief,--there, indifferent lookers-on. At the same time, a sort of\r\nNational Convention, dubious in its nature and perilous in its example,\r\nnosed Parliament in the very seat of its authority,--sat with a sort of\r\nsuperintendence over it,--and little less than dictated to it, not only\r\nlaws, but the very form and essence of legislature itself. In Ireland\r\nthings ran in a still more eccentric course. Government was unnerved,\r\nconfounded, and in a manner suspended. Its equipoise was totally gone. I\r\ndo not mean to speak disrespectfully of Lord North. He was a man of\r\nadmirable parts, of general knowledge, of a versatile understanding\r\nfitted for every sort of business, of infinite wit and pleasantry, of a\r\ndelightful temper, and with a mind most perfectly disinterested. But it\r\nwould be only to degrade myself by a weak adulation, and not to honor\r\nthe memory of a great man, to deny that he wanted something of the\r\nvigilance and spirit of command that the time required. Indeed, a\r\ndarkness next to the fog of this awful day lowered over the whole\r\nregion. For a little time the helm appeared abandoned.\r\n\r\n    Ipse diem noctemque negat discernere cœlo,\r\n    Nec meminisse viæ mediâ Palinurus in undâ.\r\n\r\nAt that time I was connected with men of high place in the community.\r\nThey loved liberty as much as the Duke of Bedford can do; and they\r\nunderstood it at least as well. Perhaps their politics, as usual, took a\r\ntincture from their character, and they cultivated what they loved. The\r\nliberty they pursued was a liberty inseparable from order, from virtue,\r\nfrom morals, and from religion,--and was neither hypocritically nor\r\nfanatically followed. They did not wish that liberty, in itself one of\r\nthe first of blessings, should in its perversion become the greatest\r\ncurse which could fall upon mankind. To preserve the Constitution\r\nentire, and practically equal to all the great ends of its formation,\r\nnot in one single part, but in all its parts, was to them the first\r\nobject. Popularity and power they regarded alike. These were with them\r\nonly different means of obtaining that object, and had no preference\r\nover each other in their minds, but as one or the other might afford a\r\nsurer or a less certain prospect of arriving at that end. It is some\r\nconsolation to me, in the cheerless gloom which darkens the evening of\r\nmy life, that with them I commenced my political career, and never for a\r\nmoment, in reality nor in appearance, for any length of time, was\r\nseparated from their good wishes and good opinion.\r\n\r\nBy what accident it matters not, nor upon what desert, but just then,\r\nand in the midst of that hunt of obloquy which ever has pursued me with\r\na full cry through life, I had obtained a very considerable degree of\r\npublic confidence. I know well enough how equivocal a test this kind of\r\npopular opinion forms of the merit that obtained it. I am no stranger to\r\nthe insecurity of its tenure. I do not boast of it. It is mentioned to\r\nshow, not how highly I prize the thing, but my right to value the use I\r\nmade of it. I endeavored to turn that short-lived advantage to myself\r\ninto a permanent benefit to my country. Far am I from detracting from\r\nthe merit of some gentlemen, out of office or in it, on that occasion.\r\nNo! It is not my way to refuse a full and heaped measure of justice to\r\nthe aids that I receive. I have through life been willing to give\r\neverything to others,--and to reserve nothing for myself, but the inward\r\nconscience that I had omitted no pains to discover, to animate, to\r\ndiscipline, to direct the abilities of the country for its service, and\r\nto place them in the best light to improve their age, or to adorn it.\r\nThis conscience I have. I have never suppressed any man, never checked\r\nhim for a moment in his course, by any jealousy, or by any policy. I was\r\nalways ready, to the height of my means, (and they wore always\r\ninfinitely below my desires,) to forward those abilities which\r\noverpowered my own. He is an ill-furnished undertaker who has no\r\nmachinery but his own hands to work with. Poor in my own faculties, I\r\never thought myself rich in theirs. In that period of difficulty and\r\ndanger, more especially, I consulted and sincerely coöperated with men\r\nof all parties who seemed disposed to the same ends, or to any main part\r\nof them. Nothing to prevent disorder was omitted: when it appeared,\r\nnothing to subdue it was left uncounselled nor unexecuted, as far as I\r\ncould prevail. At the time I speak of, and having a momentary lead, so\r\naided and so encouraged, and as a feeble instrument in a mighty hand--I\r\ndo not say I saved my country; I am sure I did my country important\r\nservice. There were few, indeed, that did not at that time acknowledge\r\nit,--and that time was thirteen years ago. It was but one voice, that no\r\nman in the kingdom better deserved an honorable provision should be made\r\nfor him. So much for my general conduct through the whole of the\r\nportentous crisis from 1780 to 1782, and the general sense then\r\nentertained of that conduct by my country. But my character as a\r\nreformer, in the particular instances which the Duke of Bedford refers\r\nto, is so connected in principle with my opinions on the hideous changes\r\nwhich have since barbarized France, and, spreading thence, threaten the\r\npolitical and moral order of the whole world, that it seems to demand\r\nsomething of a more detailed discussion.\r\n\r\nMy economical reforms were not, as his Grace may think, the suppression\r\nof a paltry pension or employment, more or less. Economy in my plans\r\nwas, as it ought to be, secondary, subordinate, instrumental. I acted on\r\nstate principles. I found a great distemper in the commonwealth, and\r\naccording to the nature of the evil and of the object I treated it. The\r\nmalady was deep; it was complicated, in the causes and in the symptoms.\r\nThroughout it was full of contra-indicants. On one hand, government,\r\ndaily growing more invidious from an apparent increase of the means of\r\nstrength, was every day growing more contemptible by real weakness. Nor\r\nwas this dissolution confined to government commonly so called. It\r\nextended to Parliament, which was losing not a little in its dignity and\r\nestimation by an opinion of its not acting on worthy motives. On the\r\nother hand, the desires of the people (partly natural and partly infused\r\ninto them by art) appeared in so wild and inconsiderate a manner with\r\nregard to the economical object, (for I set aside for a moment the\r\ndreadful tampering with the body of the Constitution itself,) that, if\r\ntheir petitions had literally been complied with, the state would have\r\nbeen convulsed, and a gate would have been opened through which all\r\nproperty might be sacked and ravaged. Nothing could have saved the\r\npublic from the mischiefs of the false reform but its absurdity, which\r\nwould soon have brought itself, and with it all real reform, into\r\ndiscredit. This would have left a rankling wound in the hearts of the\r\npeople, who would know they had failed in the accomplishment of their\r\nwishes, but who, like the rest of mankind in all ages, would impute the\r\nblame to anything rather than to their own proceedings. But there were\r\nthen persons in the world who nourished complaint, and would have been\r\nthoroughly disappointed, if the people were ever satisfied. I was not of\r\nthat humor. I wished that they _should_ be satisfied. It was my aim to\r\ngive to the people the substance of what I knew they desired, and what I\r\nthought was right, whether they desired it or not, before it had been\r\nmodified for them into senseless petitions. I knew that there is a\r\nmanifest, marked distinction, which ill men with ill designs, or weak\r\nmen incapable of any design, will constantly be confounding,--that is, a\r\nmarked distinction between change and reformation. The former alters the\r\nsubstance of the objects themselves, and gets rid of all their essential\r\ngood as well as of all the accidental evil annexed to them. Change is\r\nnovelty; and whether it is to operate any one of the effects of\r\nreformation at all, or whether it may not contradict the very principle\r\nupon which reformation is desired, cannot be certainly known beforehand.\r\nReform is not a change in the substance or in the primary modification\r\nof the object, but a direct application of a remedy to the grievance\r\ncomplained of. So far as that is removed, all is sure. It stops there;\r\nand if it fails, the substance which underwent the operation, at the\r\nvery worst, is but where it was.\r\n\r\nAll this, in effect, I think, but am not sure, I have said elsewhere. It\r\ncannot at this time be too often repeated, line upon line, precept upon\r\nprecept, until it comes into the currency of a proverb,--_To innovate is\r\nnot to reform_. The French revolutionists complained of everything; they\r\nrefused to reform anything; and they left nothing, no, nothing at all,\r\n_unchanged_. The consequences are _before_ us,--not in remote history,\r\nnot in future prognostication: they are about us; they are upon us. They\r\nshake the public security; they menace private enjoyment. They dwarf the\r\ngrowth of the young; they break the quiet of the old. If we travel, they\r\nstop our way. They infest us in town; they pursue us to the country. Our\r\nbusiness is interrupted, our repose is troubled, our pleasures are\r\nsaddened, our very studies are poisoned and perverted, and knowledge is\r\nrendered worse than ignorance, by the enormous evils of this dreadful\r\ninnovation. The Revolution harpies of France, sprung from Night and\r\nHell, or from that chaotic Anarchy which generates equivocally \"all\r\nmonstrous, all prodigious things,\" cuckoo-like, adulterously lay their\r\neggs, and brood over, and hatch them in the nest of every neighboring\r\nstate. These obscene harpies, who deck themselves in I know not what\r\ndivine attributes, but who in reality are foul and ravenous birds of\r\nprey, (both mothers and daughters,) flutter over our heads, and souse\r\ndown upon our tables, and leave nothing unrent, unrifled, unravaged, or\r\nunpolluted with the slime of their filthy offal.[15]\r\n\r\nIf his Grace can contemplate the result of this complete innovation, or,\r\nas some friends of his will call it, _reform_, in the whole body of its\r\nsolidity and compound mass, at which, as Hamlet says, the face of heaven\r\nglows with horror and indignation, and which, in truth, makes every\r\nreflecting mind and every feeling heart perfectly thought-sick, without\r\na thorough abhorrence of everything they say and everything they do, I\r\nam amazed at the morbid strength or the natural infirmity of his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, not my love, but my hatred to innovation, that produced my\r\nplan of reform. Without troubling myself with the exactness of the\r\nlogical diagram, I considered them as things substantially opposite. It\r\nwas to prevent that evil, that I proposed the measures which his Grace\r\nis pleased, and I am not sorry he is pleased, to recall to my\r\nrecollection. I had (what I hope that noble Duke will remember in all\r\nhis operations) a state to preserve, as well as a state to reform. I had\r\na people to gratify, but not to inflame or to mislead. I do not claim\r\nhalf the credit for what I did as for what I prevented from being done.\r\nIn that situation of the public mind, I did not undertake, as was then\r\nproposed, to new-model the House of Commons or the House of Lords, or\r\nto change the authority under which any officer of the crown acted, who\r\nwas suffered at all to exist. Crown, lords, commons, judicial system,\r\nsystem of administration, existed as they had existed before, and in the\r\nmode and manner in which they had always existed. My measures were, what\r\nI then truly stated them to the House to be, in their intent, healing\r\nand mediatorial. A complaint was made of too much influence in the House\r\nof Commons: I reduced it in both Houses; and I gave my reasons, article\r\nby article, for every reduction, and showed why I thought it safe for\r\nthe service of the state. I heaved the lead every inch of way I made. A\r\ndisposition to expense was complained of: to that I opposed, not mere\r\nretrenchment, but a system of economy, which would make a random\r\nexpense, without plan or foresight, in future, not easily practicable. I\r\nproceeded upon principles of research to put me in possession of my\r\nmatter, on principles of method to regulate it, and on principles in the\r\nhuman mind and in civil affairs to secure and perpetuate the operation.\r\nI conceived nothing arbitrarily, nor proposed anything to be done by the\r\nwill and pleasure of others or my own,--but by reason, and by reason\r\nonly. I have ever abhorred, since the first dawn of my understanding to\r\nthis its obscure twilight, all the operations of opinion, fancy,\r\ninclination, and will, in the affairs of government, where only a\r\nsovereign reason, paramount to all forms of legislation and\r\nadministration, should dictate. Government is made for the very purpose\r\nof opposing that reason to will and to caprice, in the reformers or in\r\nthe reformed, in the governors or in the governed, in kings, in senates,\r\nor in people.\r\n\r\nOn a careful review, therefore, and analysis of all the component parts\r\nof the civil list, and on weighing them against each other, in order to\r\nmake as much as possible all of them a subject of estimate, (the\r\nfoundation and corner-stone of all regular, provident economy,) it\r\nappeared to me evident that this was impracticable, whilst that part\r\ncalled the pension list was totally discretionary in its amount. For\r\nthis reason, and for this only, I proposed to reduce it, both in its\r\ngross quantity and in its larger individual proportions, to a certainty;\r\nlest, if it were left without a _general_ limit, it might eat up the\r\ncivil list service,--if suffered to be granted in portions too great for\r\nthe fund, it might defeat its own end, and, by unlimited allowances to\r\nsome, it might disable the crown in means of providing for others. The\r\npension list was to be kept as a sacred fund; but it could not be kept\r\nas a constant, open fund, sufficient for growing demands, if some\r\ndemands would wholly devour it. The tenor of the act will show that it\r\nregarded the civil list _only_, the reduction of which to some sort of\r\nestimate was my great object.\r\n\r\nNo other of the crown funds did I meddle with, because they had not the\r\nsame relations. This of the four and a half per cents does his Grace\r\nimagine had escaped me, or had escaped all the men of business who acted\r\nwith me in those regulations? I knew that such a fund existed, and that\r\npensions had been always granted on it, before his Grace was born. This\r\nfund was full in my eye. It was full in the eyes of those who worked\r\nwith me. It was left on principle. On principle I did what was then\r\ndone; and on principle what was left undone was omitted. I did not dare\r\nto rob the nation of all funds to reward merit. If I pressed this point\r\ntoo close, I acted contrary to the avowed principles on which I went.\r\nGentlemen are very fond of quoting me; but if any one thinks it worth\r\nhis while to know the rules that guided me in my plan of reform, he will\r\nread my printed speech on that subject, at least what is contained from\r\npage 230 to page 241 in the second volume of the collection[16] which a\r\nfriend has given himself the trouble to make of my publications. Be this\r\nas it may, these two bills (though achieved with the greatest labor, and\r\nmanagement of every sort, both within and without the House) were only a\r\npart, and but a small part, of a very large system, comprehending all\r\nthe objects I stated in opening my proposition, and, indeed, many more,\r\nwhich I just hinted at in my speech to the electors of Bristol, when I\r\nwas put out of that representation. All these, in some state or other of\r\nforwardness, I have long had by me.\r\n\r\nBut do I justify his Majesty's grace on these grounds? I think them the\r\nleast of my services. The time gave them an occasional value. What I\r\nhave done in the way of political economy was far from confined to this\r\nbody of measures. I did not come into Parliament to con my lesson. I had\r\nearned my pension before I set my foot in St. Stephen's Chapel. I was\r\nprepared and disciplined to this political warfare. The first session I\r\nsat in Parliament, I found it necessary to analyze the whole commercial,\r\nfinancial, constitutional, and foreign interests of Great Britain and\r\nits empire. A great deal was then done; and more, far more, would have\r\nbeen done, if more had been permitted by events. Then, in the vigor of\r\nmy manhood, my constitution sunk under my labor. Had I then died, (and\r\nI seemed to myself very near death,) I had then earned for those who\r\nbelonged to me more than the Duke of Bedford's ideas of service are of\r\npower to estimate. But, in truth, these services I am called to account\r\nfor are not those on which I value myself the most. If I were to call\r\nfor a reward, (which I have never done,) it should be for those in which\r\nfor fourteen years without intermission I showed the most industry and\r\nhad the least success: I mean in the affairs of India. They are those on\r\nwhich I value myself the most: most for the importance, most for the\r\nlabor, most for the judgment, most for constancy and perseverance in the\r\npursuit. Others may value them most for the _intention_. In that,\r\nsurely, they are not mistaken.\r\n\r\nDoes his Grace think that they who advised the crown to make my retreat\r\neasy considered me only as an economist? That, well understood, however,\r\nis a good deal. If I had not deemed it of some value, I should not have\r\nmade political economy an object of my humble studies from my very early\r\nyouth to near the end of my service in Parliament, even before (at least\r\nto any knowledge of mine) it had employed the thoughts of speculative\r\nmen in other parts of Europe. At that time it was still in its infancy\r\nin England, where, in the last century, it had its origin. Great and\r\nlearned men thought my studies were not wholly thrown away, and deigned\r\nto communicate with me now and then on some particulars of their\r\nimmortal works. Something of these studies may appear incidentally in\r\nsome of the earliest things I published. The House has been witness to\r\ntheir effect, and has profited of them, more or less, for above\r\neight-and-twenty years.\r\n\r\nTo their estimate I leave the matter. I was not, like his Grace of\r\nBedford, swaddled and rocked and dandled into a legislator: \"_Nitor in\r\nadversum_\" is the motto for a man like me. I possessed not one of the\r\nqualities nor cultivated one of the arts that recommend men to the favor\r\nand protection of the great. I was not made for a minion or a tool. As\r\nlittle did I follow the trade of winning the hearts by imposing on the\r\nunderstandings of the people. At every step of my progress in life, (for\r\nin every step was I traversed and opposed,) and at every turnpike I met,\r\nI was obliged to show my passport, and again and again to prove my sole\r\ntitle to the honor of being useful to my country, by a proof that I was\r\nnot wholly unacquainted with its laws and the whole system of its\r\ninterests both abroad and at home. Otherwise, no rank, no toleration\r\neven, for me. I had no arts but manly arts. On them I have stood, and,\r\nplease God, in spite of the Duke of Bedford and the Earl of Lauderdale,\r\nto the last gasp will I stand.\r\n\r\nHad his Grace condescended to inquire concerning the person whom he has\r\nnot thought it below him to reproach, he might have found, that, in the\r\nwhole course of my life, I have never, on any pretence of economy, or on\r\nany other pretence, so much as in a single instance, stood between any\r\nman and his reward of service or his encouragement in useful talent and\r\npursuit, from the highest of those services and pursuits to the lowest.\r\nOn the contrary, I have on an hundred occasions exerted myself with\r\nsingular zeal to forward every man's even tolerable pretensions. I have\r\nmore than once had good-natured reprehensions from my friends for\r\ncarrying the matter to something bordering on abuse. This line of\r\nconduct, whatever its merits might be, was partly owing to natural\r\ndisposition, but I think full as much to reason and principle. I looked\r\non the consideration of public service or public ornament to be real and\r\nvery justice; and I ever held a scanty and penurious justice to partake\r\nof the nature of a wrong. I held it to be, in its consequences, the\r\nworst economy in the world. In saving money I soon can count up all the\r\ngood I do; but when by a cold penury I blast the abilities of a nation,\r\nand stunt the growth of its active energies, the ill I may do is beyond\r\nall calculation. Whether it be too much or too little, whatever I have\r\ndone has been general and systematic. I have never entered into those\r\ntrifling vexations and oppressive details that have been falsely and\r\nmost ridiculously laid to my charge.\r\n\r\nDid I blame the pensions given to Mr. Barré and Mr. Dunning between the\r\nproposition and execution of my plan? No! surely, no! Those pensions\r\nwere within my principles. I assert it, those gentlemen deserved their\r\npensions, their titles,--all they had; and if more they had, I should\r\nhave been but pleased the more. They were men of talents; they were men\r\nof service. I put the profession of the law out of the question in one\r\nof them. It is a service that rewards itself. But their _public\r\nservice_, though from their abilities unquestionably of more value than\r\nmine, in its quantity and in its duration was not to be mentioned with\r\nit. But I never could drive a hard bargain in my life, concerning any\r\nmatter whatever; and least of all do I know how to haggle and huckster\r\nwith merit. Pension for myself I obtained none; nor did I solicit any.\r\nYet I was loaded with hatred for everything that was withheld, and with\r\nobloquy for everything that was given. I was thus left to support the\r\ngrants of a name ever dear to me and ever venerable to the world in\r\nfavor of those who were no friends of mine or of his, against the rude\r\nattacks of those who were at that time friends to the grantees and their\r\nown zealous partisans. I have never heard the Earl of Lauderdale\r\ncomplain of these pensions. He finds nothing wrong till he comes to me.\r\nThis is impartiality, in the true, modern, revolutionary style.\r\n\r\nWhatever I did at that time, so far as it regarded order and economy, is\r\nstable and eternal, as all principles must be. A particular order of\r\nthings may be altered: order itself cannot lose its value. As to other\r\nparticulars, they are variable by time and by circumstances. Laws of\r\nregulation are not fundamental laws. The public exigencies are the\r\nmasters of all such laws. They rule the laws, and are not to be ruled by\r\nthem. They who exercise the legislative power at the time must judge.\r\n\r\nIt may be new to his Grace, but I beg leave to tell him that mere\r\nparsimony is not economy. It is separable in theory from it; and in fact\r\nit may or it may not be a _part_ of economy, according to circumstances.\r\nExpense, and great expense, may be an essential part in true economy. If\r\nparsimony were to be considered as one of the kinds of that virtue,\r\nthere is, however, another and an higher economy. Economy is a\r\ndistributive virtue, and consists, not in saving, but in selection.\r\nParsimony requires no providence, no sagacity, no powers of combination,\r\nno comparison, no judgment. Mere instinct, and that not an instinct of\r\nthe noblest kind, may produce this false economy in perfection. The\r\nother economy has larger views. It demands a discriminating judgment,\r\nand a firm, sagacious mind. It shuts one door to impudent importunity,\r\nonly to open another, and a wider, to unpresuming merit. If none but\r\nmeritorious service or real talent were to be rewarded, this nation has\r\nnot wanted, and this nation will not want, the means of rewarding all\r\nthe service it ever will receive, and encouraging all the merit it ever\r\nwill produce. No state, since the foundation of society, has been\r\nimpoverished by that species of profusion. Had the economy of selection\r\nand proportion been at all times observed, we should not now have had an\r\novergrown Duke of Bedford, to oppress the industry of humble men, and to\r\nlimit, by the standard of his own conceptions, the justice, the bounty,\r\nor, if he pleases, the charity of the crown.\r\n\r\nHis Grace may think as meanly as he will of my deserts in the far\r\ngreater part of my conduct in life. It is free for him to do so. There\r\nwill always be some difference of opinion in the value of political\r\nservices. But there is one merit of mine which he, of all men living,\r\nought to be the last to call in question. I have supported with very\r\ngreat zeal, and I am told with some degree of success, those opinions,\r\nor, if his Grace likes another expression better, those old prejudices,\r\nwhich buoy up the ponderous mass of his nobility, wealth, and titles. I\r\nhave omitted no exertion to prevent him and them from sinking to that\r\nlevel to which the meretricious French faction his Grace at least\r\ncoquets with omit no exertion to reduce both. I have done all I could to\r\ndiscountenance their inquiries into the fortunes of those who hold large\r\nportions of wealth without any apparent merit of their own. I have\r\nstrained every nerve to keep the Duke of Bedford in that situation\r\nwhich alone makes him my superior. Your Lordship has been a witness of\r\nthe use he makes of that preëminence.\r\n\r\nBut be it that this is virtue; be it that there is virtue in this\r\nwell-selected rigor: yet all virtues are not equally becoming to all men\r\nand at all times. There are crimes, undoubtedly there are crimes, which\r\nin all seasons of our existence ought to put a generous antipathy in\r\naction,--crimes that provoke an indignant justice, and call forth a warm\r\nand animated pursuit. But all things that concern what I may call the\r\npreventive police of morality, all things merely rigid, harsh, and\r\ncensorial, the antiquated moralists at whose feet I was brought up would\r\nnot have thought these the fittest matter to form the favorite virtues\r\nof young men of rank. What might have been well enough, and have been\r\nreceived with a veneration mixed with awe and terror, from an old,\r\nsevere, crabbed Cato, would have wanted something of propriety in the\r\nyoung Scipios, the ornament of the Roman nobility, in the flower of\r\ntheir life. But the times, the morals, the masters, the scholars, have\r\nall undergone a thorough revolution. It is a vile, illiberal school,\r\nthis new French academy of the _sans-culottes_. There is nothing in it\r\nthat is fit for a gentleman to learn.\r\n\r\nWhatever its vogue may be, I still flatter myself that the parents of\r\nthe growing generation will be satisfied with what is to be taught to\r\ntheir children in Westminster, in Eton, or in Winchester; I still\r\nindulge the hope that no _grown_ gentleman or nobleman of our time will\r\nthink of finishing at Mr. Thelwall's lecture whatever may have been left\r\nincomplete at the old universities of his country. I would give to Lord\r\nGrenville and Mr. Pitt for a motto what was said of a Roman censor or\r\nprætor (or what was he?) who in virtue of a _Senatusconsultum_ shut up\r\ncertain academies,--\"_Cludere ludum impudentiæ jussit_.\" Every honest\r\nfather of a family in the kingdom will rejoice at the breaking-up for\r\nthe holidays, and will pray that there may be a very long vacation, in\r\nall such schools.\r\n\r\nThe awful state of the time, and not myself, or my own justification, is\r\nmy true object in what I now write, or in what I shall ever write or\r\nsay. It little signifies to the world what becomes of such things as me,\r\nor even as the Duke of Bedford. What I say about either of us is nothing\r\nmore than a vehicle, as you, my Lord, will easily perceive, to convey my\r\nsentiments on matters far more worthy of your attention. It is when I\r\nstick to my apparent first subject that I ought to apologize, not when I\r\ndepart from it. I therefore must beg your Lordship's pardon for again\r\nresuming it after this very short digression,--assuring you that I shall\r\nnever altogether lose sight of such matter as persons abler than I am\r\nmay turn to some profit.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford conceives that he is obliged to call the attention\r\nof the House of Peers to his Majesty's grant to me, which he considers\r\nas excessive and out of all bounds.\r\n\r\nI know not how it has happened, but it really seems, that, whilst his\r\nGrace was meditating his well-considered censure upon me, he fell into a\r\nsort of sleep. Homer nods, and the Duke of Bedford may dream; and as\r\ndreams (even his golden dreams) are apt to be ill-pieced and\r\nincongruously put together, his Grace preserved his idea of reproach to\r\n_me_, but took the subject-matter from the crown grants _to his own\r\nfamily_. This is \"the stuff of which his dreams are made.\" In that way\r\nof putting things together his Grace is perfectly in the right. The\r\ngrants to the House of Russell were so enormous as not only to outrage\r\neconomy, but even to stagger credibility. The Duke of Bedford is the\r\nleviathan among all the creatures of the crown. He tumbles about his\r\nunwieldy bulk, he plays and frolics in the ocean of the royal bounty.\r\nHuge as he is, and whilst \"he lies floating many a rood,\" he is still a\r\ncreature. His ribs, his fins, his whalebone, his blubber, the very\r\nspiracles through which he spouts a torrent of brine against his origin,\r\nand covers me all over with the spray, everything of him and about him\r\nis from the throne. Is it for _him_ to question the dispensation of the\r\nroyal favor?\r\n\r\nI really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public\r\nmerits of his Grace, by which he justifies the grants he holds, and\r\nthese services of mine, on the favorable construction of which I have\r\nobtained what his Grace so much disapproves. In private life I have not\r\nat all the honor of acquaintance with the noble Duke; but I ought to\r\npresume, and it costs me nothing to do so, that he abundantly deserves\r\nthe esteem and love of all who live with him. But as to public service,\r\nwhy, truly, it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself, in\r\nrank, in fortune, in splendid descent, in youth, strength, or figure,\r\nwith the Duke of Bedford, than to make a parallel between his services\r\nand my attempts to be useful to my country. It would not be gross\r\nadulation, but uncivil irony, to say that he has any public merit of his\r\nown to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed\r\npensions were obtained. My merits, whatever they are, are original and\r\npersonal: his are derivative. It is his ancestor, the original\r\npensioner, that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit which makes\r\nhis Grace so very delicate and exceptious about the merit of all other\r\ngrantees of the crown. Had he permitted me to remain in quiet, I should\r\nhave said, \"'Tis his estate: that's enough. It is his by law: what have\r\nI to do with it or its history?\" He would naturally have said, on his\r\nside, \"'Tis this man's fortune. He is as good now as my ancestor was two\r\nhundred and fifty years ago. I am a young man with very old pensions; he\r\nis an old man with very young pensions: that's all.\"\r\n\r\nWhy will his Grace, by attacking me, force me reluctantly to compare my\r\nlittle merit with that which obtained from the crown those prodigies of\r\nprofuse donation by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and\r\nlaborious individuals? I would willingly leave him to the Herald's\r\nCollege, which the philosophy of the _sans-culottes_ (prouder by far\r\nthan all the Garters, and Norroys, and Clarencieux, and Rouge-Dragons\r\nthat ever pranced in a procession of what his friends call aristocrats\r\nand despots) will abolish with contumely and scorn. These historians,\r\nrecorders, and blazoners of virtues and arms differ wholly from that\r\nother description of historians who never assign any act of politicians\r\nto a good motive. These gentle historians, on the contrary, dip their\r\npens in nothing but the milk of human kindness. They seek no further for\r\nmerit than the preamble of a patent or the inscription on a tomb. With\r\nthem every man created a peer is first an hero ready-made. They judge of\r\nevery man's capacity for office by the offices he has filled; and the\r\nmore offices, the more ability. Every general officer with them is a\r\nMarlborough, every statesman a Burleigh, every judge a Murray or a\r\nYorke. They who, alive, were laughed at or pitied by all their\r\nacquaintance make as good a figure as the best of them in the pages of\r\nGuillim, Edmondson, and Collins.\r\n\r\nTo these recorders, so full of good-nature to the great and prosperous,\r\nI would willingly leave the first Baron Russell and Earl of Bedford, and\r\nthe merits of his grants. But the aulnager, the weigher, the meter of\r\ngrants will not suffer us to acquiesce in the judgment of the prince\r\nreigning at the time when they were made. They are never good to those\r\nwho earn them. Well, then, since the new grantees have war made on them\r\nby the old, and that the word of the sovereign is not to be taken, let\r\nus turn our eyes to history, in which great men have always a pleasure\r\nin contemplating the heroic origin of their house.\r\n\r\nThe first peer of the name, the first purchaser of the grants, was a Mr.\r\nRussell, a person of an ancient gentleman's family, raised by being a\r\nminion of Henry the Eighth. As there generally is some resemblance of\r\ncharacter to create these relations, the favorite was in all likelihood\r\nmuch such another as his master. The first of those immoderate grants\r\nwas not taken from the ancient demesne of the crown, but from the recent\r\nconfiscation of the ancient nobility of the land. The lion, having\r\nsucked the blood of his prey, threw the offal carcass to the jackal in\r\nwaiting. Having tasted once the food of confiscation, the favorites\r\nbecame fierce and ravenous. This worthy favorite's first grant was from\r\nthe lay nobility. The second, infinitely improving on the enormity of\r\nthe first, was from the plunder of the Church. In truth, his Grace is\r\nsomewhat excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine, not only in its\r\nquantity, but in its kind, so different from his own.\r\n\r\nMine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign: his from Henry the\r\nEighth.\r\n\r\nMine had not its fund in the murder of any innocent person of\r\nillustrious rank,[17] or in the pillage of any body of unoffending men.\r\nHis grants were from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments\r\niniquitously legal, and from possessions voluntarily surrendered by the\r\nlawful proprietors with the gibbet at their door.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the grantee whom he derives from was that of being a prompt\r\nand greedy instrument of a _levelling_ tyrant, who oppressed all\r\ndescriptions of his people, but who fell with particular fury on\r\neverything that was _great and noble_. Mine has been in endeavoring to\r\nscreen every man, in every class, from oppression, and particularly in\r\ndefending the high and eminent, who, in the bad times of confiscating\r\nprinces, confiscating chief governors, or confiscating demagogues, are\r\nthe most exposed to jealousy, avarice, and envy.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the original grantee of his Grace's pensions was in giving\r\nhis hand to the work, and partaking the spoil, with a prince who\r\nplundered a part of the national Church of his time and country. Mine\r\nwas in defending the whole of the national Church of my own time and my\r\nown country, and the whole of the national Churches of all countries,\r\nfrom the principles and the examples which lead to ecclesiastical\r\npillage, thence to a contempt of _all_ prescriptive titles, thence to\r\nthe pillage of _all_ property, and thence to universal desolation.\r\n\r\nThe merit of the origin of his Grace's fortune was in being a favorite\r\nand chief adviser to a prince who left no liberty to their native\r\ncountry. My endeavor was to obtain liberty for the municipal country in\r\nwhich I was born, and for all descriptions and denominations in it. Mine\r\nwas to support with unrelaxing vigilance every right, every privilege,\r\nevery franchise, in this my adopted, my dearer, and more comprehensive\r\ncountry; and not only to preserve those rights in this chief seat of\r\nempire, but in every nation, in every land, in every climate, language,\r\nand religion, in the vast domain that still is under the protection, and\r\nthe larger that was once under the protection, of the British crown.\r\n\r\nHis founder's merits were, by arts in which he served his master and\r\nmade his fortune, to bring poverty, wretchedness, and depopulation on\r\nhis country. Mine were under a benevolent prince, in promoting the\r\ncommerce, manufactures, and agriculture of his kingdom,--in which his\r\nMajesty shows an eminent example, who even in his amusements is a\r\npatriot, and in hours of leisure an improver of his native soil.\r\n\r\nHis founder's merit was the merit of a gentleman raised by the arts of a\r\ncourt and the protection of a Wolsey to the eminence of a great and\r\npotent lord. His merit in that eminence was, by instigating a tyrant to\r\ninjustice, to provoke a people to rebellion. My merit was, to awaken the\r\nsober part of the country, that they might put themselves on their\r\nguard against any one potent lord, or any greater number of potent\r\nlords, or any combination of great leading men of any sort, if ever they\r\nshould attempt to proceed in the same courses, but in the reverse\r\norder,--that is, by instigating a corrupted populace to rebellion, and,\r\nthrough that rebellion, introducing a tyranny yet worse than the tyranny\r\nwhich his Grace's ancestor supported, and of which he profited in the\r\nmanner we behold in the despotism of Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\nThe political merit of the first pensioner of his Grace's house was that\r\nof being concerned as a counsellor of state in advising, and in his\r\nperson executing, the conditions of a dishonorable peace with\r\nFrance,--the surrendering the fortress of Boulogne, then our outguard on\r\nthe Continent. By that surrender, Calais, the key of France, and the\r\nbridle in the mouth of that power, was not many years afterwards finally\r\nlost. My merit has been in resisting the power and pride of France,\r\nunder any form of its rule; but in opposing it with the greatest zeal\r\nand earnestness, when that rule appeared in the worst form it could\r\nassume,--the worst, indeed, which the prime cause and principle of all\r\nevil could possibly give it. It was my endeavor by every means to excite\r\na spirit in the House, where I had the honor of a seat, for carrying on\r\nwith early vigor and decision the most clearly just and necessary war\r\nthat this or any nation ever carried on, in order to save my country\r\nfrom the iron yoke of its power, and from the more dreadful contagion of\r\nits principles,--to preserve, while they can be preserved, pure and\r\nuntainted, the ancient, inbred integrity, piety, good-nature, and\r\ngood-humor of the people of England, from the dreadful pestilence which,\r\nbeginning in France, threatens to lay waste the whole moral and in a\r\ngreat degree the whole physical world, having done both in the focus of\r\nits most intense malignity.\r\n\r\nThe labors of his Grace's founder merited the \"curses, not loud, but\r\ndeep,\" of the Commons of England, on whom _he_ and his master had\r\neffected a _complete Parliamentary Reform_, by making them, in their\r\nslavery and humiliation, the true and adequate representatives of a\r\ndebased, degraded, and undone people. My merits were in having had an\r\nactive, though not always an ostentatious share, in every one act,\r\nwithout exception, of undisputed constitutional utility in my time, and\r\nin having supported, on all occasions, the authority, the efficiency,\r\nand the privileges of the Commons of Great Britain. I ended my services\r\nby a recorded and fully reasoned assertion on their own journals of\r\ntheir constitutional rights, and a vindication of their constitutional\r\nconduct. I labored in all things to merit their inward approbation, and\r\n(along with the assistants of the largest, the greatest, and best of my\r\nendeavors) I received their free, unbiased, public, and solemn thanks.\r\n\r\nThus stands the account of the comparative merits of the crown grants\r\nwhich compose the Duke of Bedford's fortune as balanced against mine. In\r\nthe name of common sense, why should the Duke of Bedford think that none\r\nbut of the House of Russell are entitled to the favor of the crown? Why\r\nshould he imagine that no king of England has been capable of judging of\r\nmerit but King Henry the Eighth? Indeed, he will pardon me, he is a\r\nlittle mistaken: all virtue did not end in the first Earl of Bedford;\r\nall discernment did not lose its vision when his creator closed his\r\neyes. Let him remit his rigor on the disproportion between merit and\r\nreward in others, and they will make no inquiry into the origin of his\r\nfortune. They will regard with much more satisfaction, as he will\r\ncontemplate with infinitely more advantage, whatever in his pedigree has\r\nbeen dulcified by an exposure to the influence of heaven in a long flow\r\nof generations from the hard, acidulous, metallic tincture of the\r\nspring. It is little to be doubted that several of his forefathers in\r\nthat long series have degenerated into honor and virtue. Let the Duke of\r\nBedford (I am sure he will) reject with scorn and horror the counsels of\r\nthe lecturers, those wicked panders to avarice and ambition, who would\r\ntempt him, in the troubles of his country, to seek another enormous\r\nfortune from the forfeitures of another nobility and the plunder of\r\nanother Church. Let him (and I trust that yet he will) employ all the\r\nenergy of his youth and all the resources of his wealth to crush\r\nrebellious principles which have no foundation in morals, and rebellious\r\nmovements that have no provocation in tyranny.\r\n\r\nThen will be forgot the rebellions which, by a doubtful priority in\r\ncrime, his ancestor had provoked and extinguished. On such a conduct in\r\nthe noble Duke, many of his countrymen might, and with some excuse\r\nmight, give way to the enthusiasm of their gratitude, and, in the\r\ndashing style of some of the old declaimers, cry out, that, if the Fates\r\nhad found no other way in which they could give a[18] Duke of Bedford\r\nand his opulence as props to a tottering world, then the butchery of\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham might be tolerated; it might be regarded even\r\nwith complacency, whilst in the heir of confiscation they saw the\r\nsympathizing comforter of the martyrs who suffer under the cruel\r\nconfiscation of this day, whilst they beheld with admiration his zealous\r\nprotection of the virtuous and loyal nobility of France, and his manly\r\nsupport of his brethren, the yet standing nobility and gentry of his\r\nnative land. Then his Grace's merit would be pure and new and sharp, as\r\nfresh from the mint of honor. As he pleased, he might reflect honor on\r\nhis predecessors, or throw it forward on those who were to succeed him.\r\nHe might be the propagator of the stock of honor, or the root of it, as\r\nhe thought proper.\r\n\r\nHad it pleased God to continue to me the hopes of succession, I should\r\nhave been, according to my mediocrity and the mediocrity of the age I\r\nlive in, a sort of founder of a family: I should have left a son, who,\r\nin all the points in which personal merit can be viewed, in science, in\r\nerudition, in genius, in taste, in honor, in generosity, in humanity, in\r\nevery liberal sentiment and every liberal accomplishment, would not have\r\nshown himself inferior to the Duke of Bedford, or to any of those whom\r\nhe traces in his line. His Grace very soon would have wanted all\r\nplausibility in his attack upon that provision which belonged more to\r\nmine than to me. He would soon have supplied every deficiency, and\r\nsymmetrized every disproportion. It would not have been for that\r\nsuccessor to resort to any stagnant, wasting reservoir of merit in me,\r\nor in any ancestry. He had in himself a salient, living spring of\r\ngenerous and manly action. Every day he lived he would have repurchased\r\nthe bounty of the crown, and ten times more, if ten times more he had\r\nreceived. He was made a public creature, and had no enjoyment whatever\r\nbut in the performance of some duty. At this exigent moment the loss of\r\na finished man is not easily supplied.\r\n\r\nBut a Disposer whose power we are little able to resist, and whose\r\nwisdom it behoves us not at all to dispute, has ordained it in another\r\nmanner, and (whatever my querulous weakness might suggest) a far better.\r\nThe storm has gone over me; and I lie like one of those old oaks which\r\nthe late hurricane has scattered about me. I am stripped of all my\r\nhonors, I am torn up by the roots, and lie prostrate on the earth.\r\nThere, and prostrate there, I most unfeignedly recognize the Divine\r\njustice, and in some degree submit to it. But whilst I humble myself\r\nbefore God, I do not know that it is forbidden to repel the attacks of\r\nunjust and inconsiderate men. The patience of Job is proverbial. After\r\nsome of the convulsive struggles of our irritable nature, he submitted\r\nhimself, and repented in dust and ashes. But even so, I do not find him\r\nblamed for reprehending, and with a considerable degree of verbal\r\nasperity, those ill-natured neighbors of his who visited his dunghill to\r\nread moral, political, and economical lectures on his misery. I am\r\nalone. I have none to meet my enemies in the gate. Indeed, my Lord, I\r\ngreatly deceive myself, if in this hard season I would give a peck of\r\nrefuse wheat for all that is called fame and honor in the world. This is\r\nthe appetite but of a few. It is a luxury, it is a privilege, it is an\r\nindulgence for those who are at their ease. But we are all of us made to\r\nshun disgrace, as we are made to shrink from pain and poverty and\r\ndisease. It is an instinct; and under the direction of reason, instinct\r\nis always in the right. I live in an inverted order. They who ought to\r\nhave succeeded me are gone before me. They who should have been to me as\r\nposterity are in the place of ancestors. I owe to the dearest relation\r\n(which ever must subsist in memory) that act of piety which he would\r\nhave performed to me: I owe it to him to show that he was not descended,\r\nas the Duke of Bedford would have it, from an unworthy parent.\r\n\r\nThe crown has considered me after long service: the crown has paid the\r\nDuke of Bedford by advance. He has had a long credit for any service\r\nwhich he may perform hereafter. He is secure, and long may he be secure,\r\nin his advance, whether he performs any services or not. But let him\r\ntake care how he endangers the safety of that Constitution which secures\r\nhis own utility or his own insignificance, or how he discourages those\r\nwho take up even puny arms to defend an order of things which, like the\r\nsun of heaven, shines alike on the useful and the worthless. His grants\r\nare ingrafted on the public law of Europe, covered with the awful hoar\r\nof innumerable ages. They are guarded by the sacred rules of\r\nprescription, found in that full treasury of jurisprudence from which\r\nthe jejuneness and penury of our municipal law has by degrees been\r\nenriched and strengthened. This prescription I had my share (a very full\r\nshare) in bringing to its perfection.[19] The Duke of Bedford will stand\r\nas long as prescriptive law endures,--as long as the great, stable laws\r\nof property, common to us with all civilized nations, are kept in their\r\nintegrity, and without the smallest intermixture of the laws, maxims,\r\nprinciples, or precedents of the Grand Revolution. They are secure\r\nagainst all changes but one. The whole Revolutionary system, institutes,\r\ndigest, code, novels, text, gloss, comment, are not only not the same,\r\nbut they are the very reverse, and the reverse fundamentally, of all the\r\nlaws on which civil life has hitherto been upheld in all the governments\r\nof the world. The learned professors of the Rights of Man regard\r\nprescription not as a title to bar all claim set up against old\r\npossession, but they look on prescription as itself a bar against the\r\npossessor and proprietor. They hold an immemorial possession to be no\r\nmore than a long continued and therefore an aggravated injustice.\r\n\r\nSuch are _their_ ideas, such _their_ religion, and such _their_ law. But\r\nas to _our_ country and _our_ race, as long as the well-compacted\r\nstructure of our Church and State, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of\r\nthat ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress\r\nat once and a temple,[20] shall stand inviolate on the brow of the\r\nBritish Sion,--as long as the British monarchy, not more limited than\r\nfenced by the orders of the state, shall, like the proud Keep of\r\nWindsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double\r\nbelt of its kindred and coëval towers, as long as this awful structure\r\nshall oversee and guard the subjected land,--so long the mounds and\r\ndikes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all\r\nthe pickaxes of all the levellers of France. As long as our sovereign\r\nlord the king, and his faithful subjects, the lords and commons of this\r\nrealm,--the triple cord which no man can break,--the solemn, sworn,\r\nconstitutional frank-pledge of this nation,--the firm guaranties of\r\neach other's being and each other's rights,--the joint and several\r\nsecurities, each in its place and order, for every kind and every\r\nquality of property and of dignity,--as long as these ensure, so long\r\nthe Duke of Bedford is safe, and we are all safe together,--the high\r\nfrom the blights of envy and the spoliations of rapacity, the low from\r\nthe iron hand of oppression and the insolent spurn of contempt. Amen!\r\nand so be it! and so it will be,--\r\n\r\n    Dum domus Æneæ Capitolî immobile saxum\r\n    Accolet, imperiumque pater Romanus habebit.\r\n\r\nBut if the rude inroad of Gallic tumult, with its sophistical rights of\r\nman to falsify the account, and its sword as a make-weight to throw into\r\nthe scale, shall be introduced into our city by a misguided populace,\r\nset on by proud great men, themselves blinded and intoxicated by a\r\nfrantic ambition, we shall all of us perish and be overwhelmed in a\r\ncommon ruin. If a great storm blow on our coast, it will cast the whales\r\non the strand, as well as the periwinkles. His Grace will not survive\r\nthe poor grantee he despises,--no, not for a twelvemonth. If the great\r\nlook for safety in the services they render to this Gallic cause, it is\r\nto be foolish even above the weight of privilege allowed to wealth. If\r\nhis Grace be one of these whom they endeavor to proselytize, he ought to\r\nbe aware of the character of the sect whose doctrines he is invited to\r\nembrace. With them insurrection is the most sacred of revolutionary\r\nduties to the state. Ingratitude to benefactors is the first of\r\nrevolutionary virtues. Ingratitude is, indeed, their four cardinal\r\nvirtues compacted and amalgamated into one; and he will find it in\r\neverything that has happened since the commencement of the philosophic\r\nRevolution to this hour. If he pleads the merit of having performed the\r\nduty of insurrection against the order he lives in, (God forbid he ever\r\nshould!) the merit of others will be to perform the duty of insurrection\r\nagainst him. If he pleads (again God forbid he should, and I do not\r\nsuspect he will) his ingratitude to the crown for its creation of his\r\nfamily, others will plead their right and duty to pay him in kind. They\r\nwill laugh, indeed they will laugh, at his parchment and his wax. His\r\ndeeds will be drawn out with the rest of the lumber of his\r\nevidence-room, and burnt to the tune of _Ça, ira_ in the courts of\r\nBedford (then Equality) House.\r\n\r\nAm I to blame, if I attempt to pay his Grace's hostile reproaches to me\r\nwith a friendly admonition to himself? Can I be blamed for pointing out\r\nto him in what manner he is like to be affected, if the sect of the\r\ncannibal philosophers of France should proselytize any considerable part\r\nof this people, and, by their joint proselytizing arms, should conquer\r\nthat government to which his Grace does not seem to me to give all the\r\nsupport his own security demands? Surely it is proper that he, and that\r\nothers like him, should know the true genius of this sect,--what their\r\nopinions are,--what they have done, and to whom,--and what (if a\r\nprognostic is to be formed from the dispositions and actions of men) it\r\nis certain they will do hereafter. He ought to know that they have sworn\r\nassistance, the only engagement they ever will keep, to all in this\r\ncountry who bear a resemblance to themselves, and who think, as such,\r\nthat _the whole duty of man_ consists in destruction. They are a\r\nmisallied and disparaged branch of the House of Nimrod. They are the\r\nDuke of Bedford's natural hunters; and he is their natural game. Because\r\nhe is not very profoundly reflecting, he sleeps in profound security:\r\nthey, on the contrary, are always vigilant, active, enterprising, and,\r\nthough far removed from any knowledge which makes men estimable or\r\nuseful, in all the instruments and resources of evil their leaders are\r\nnot meanly instructed or insufficiently furnished. In the French\r\nRevolution everything is new, and, from want of preparation to meet so\r\nunlooked-for an evil, everything is dangerous. Never before this time\r\nwas a set of literary men converted into a gang of robbers and\r\nassassins; never before did a den of bravoes and banditti assume the\r\ngarb and tone of an academy of philosophers.\r\n\r\nLet me tell his Grace, that an union of such characters, monstrous as it\r\nseems, is not made for producing despicable enemies. But if they are\r\nformidable as foes, as friends they are dreadful indeed. The men of\r\nproperty in France, confiding in a force which seemed to be irresistible\r\nbecause it had never been tried, neglected to prepare for a conflict\r\nwith their enemies at their own weapons. They were found in such a\r\nsituation as the Mexicans were, when they were attacked by the dogs, the\r\ncavalry, the iron, and the gunpowder of an handful of bearded men, whom\r\nthey did not know to exist in Nature. This is a comparison that some, I\r\nthink, have made; and it is just. In France they had their enemies\r\nwithin their houses. They were even in the bosoms of many of them. But\r\nthey had not sagacity to discern their savage character. They seemed\r\ntame, and even caressing. They had nothing but _douce humanité_ in their\r\nmouth. They could not bear the punishment of the mildest laws on the\r\ngreatest criminals. The slightest severity of justice made their flesh\r\ncreep. The very idea that war existed in the world disturbed their\r\nrepose. Military glory was no more, with them, than a splendid infamy.\r\nHardly would they hear of self-defence, which they reduced within such\r\nbounds as to leave it no defence at all. All this while they meditated\r\nthe confiscations and massacres we have seen. Had any one told these\r\nunfortunate noblemen and gentlemen how and by whom the grand fabric of\r\nthe French monarchy under which they flourished would be subverted, they\r\nwould not have pitied him as a visionary, but would have turned from him\r\nas what they call a _mauvais plaisant_. Yet we have seen what has\r\nhappened. The persons who have suffered from the cannibal philosophy of\r\nFrance are so like the Duke of Bedford, that nothing but his Grace's\r\nprobably not speaking quite so good French could enable us to find out\r\nany difference. A great many of them had as pompous titles as he, and\r\nwere of full as illustrious a race; some few of them had fortunes as\r\nample; several of them, without meaning the least disparagement to the\r\nDuke of Bedford, were as wise, and as virtuous, and as valiant, and as\r\nwell educated, and as complete in all the lineaments of men of honor, as\r\nhe is; and to all this they had added the powerful outguard of a\r\nmilitary profession, which, in its nature, renders men somewhat more\r\ncautious than those who have nothing to attend to but the lazy enjoyment\r\nof undisturbed possessions. But security was their ruin. They are\r\ndashed to pieces in the storm, and our shores are covered with the\r\nwrecks. If they had been aware that such a thing might happen, such a\r\nthing never could have happened.\r\n\r\nI assure his Grace, that, if I state to him the designs of his enemies\r\nin a manner which may appear to him ludicrous and impossible, I tell him\r\nnothing that has not exactly happened, point by point, but twenty-four\r\nmiles from our own shore. I assure him that the Frenchified faction,\r\nmore encouraged than others are warned by what has happened in France,\r\nlook at him and his landed possessions as an object at once of curiosity\r\nand rapacity. He is made for them in every part of their double\r\ncharacter. As robbers, to them he is a noble booty; as speculatists, he\r\nis a glorious subject for their experimental philosophy. He affords\r\nmatter for an extensive analysis in all the branches of their science,\r\ngeometrical, physical, civil, and political. These philosophers are\r\nfanatics: independent of any interest, which, if it operated alone,\r\nwould make them much more tractable, they are carried with such an\r\nheadlong rage towards every desperate trial that they would sacrifice\r\nthe whole human race to the slightest of their experiments. I am better\r\nable to enter into the character of this description of men than the\r\nnoble Duke can be. I have lived long and variously in the world. Without\r\nany considerable pretensions to literature in myself, I have aspired to\r\nthe love of letters. I have lived for a great many years in habitudes\r\nwith those who professed them. I can form a tolerable estimate of what\r\nis likely to happen from a character chiefly dependent for fame and\r\nfortune on knowledge and talent, as well in its morbid and perverted\r\nstate as in that which is sound and natural. Naturally, men so formed\r\nand finished are the first gifts of Providence to the world. But when\r\nthey have once thrown off the fear of God, which was in all ages too\r\noften the case, and the fear of man, which is now the case, and when in\r\nthat state they come to understand one another, and to act in corps, a\r\nmore dreadful calamity cannot arise out of hell to scourge mankind.\r\nNothing can be conceived more hard than the heart of a thorough-bred\r\nmetaphysician. It comes nearer to the cold malignity of a wicked spirit\r\nthan to the frailty and passion of a man. It is like that of the\r\nPrinciple of Evil himself, incorporeal, pure, unmixed, dephlegmated,\r\ndefecated evil. It is no easy operation to eradicate humanity from the\r\nhuman breast. What Shakspeare calls the \"compunctious visitings of\r\nNature\" will sometimes knock at their hearts, and protest against their\r\nmurderous speculations. But they have a means of compounding with their\r\nnature. Their humanity is not dissolved; they only give it a long\r\nprorogation. They are ready to declare that they do not think two\r\nthousand years too long a period for the good that they pursue. It is\r\nremarkable that they never see any way to their projected good but by\r\nthe road of some evil. Their imagination is not fatigued with the\r\ncontemplation of human suffering through the wild waste of centuries\r\nadded to centuries of misery and desolation. Their humanity is at their\r\nhorizon,--and, like the horizon, it always flies before them. The\r\ngeometricians and the chemists bring, the one from the dry bones of\r\ntheir diagrams, and the other from the soot of their furnaces,\r\ndispositions that make them worse than indifferent about those feelings\r\nand habitudes which are the supports of the moral world. Ambition is\r\ncome upon them suddenly; they are intoxicated with it, and it has\r\nrendered them fearless of the danger which may from thence arise to\r\nothers or to themselves. These philosophers consider men in their\r\nexperiments no more than they do mice in an air-pump or in a recipient\r\nof mephitic gas. Whatever his Grace may think of himself, they look upon\r\nhim, and everything that belongs to him, with no more regard than they\r\ndo upon the whiskers of that little long-tailed animal that has been\r\nlong the game of the grave, demure, insidious, spring-nailed,\r\nvelvet-pawed, green-eyed philosophers, whether going upon two legs or\r\nupon four.\r\n\r\nHis Grace's landed possessions are irresistibly inviting to an agrarian\r\nexperiment. They are a downright insult upon the rights of man. They are\r\nmore extensive than the territory of many of the Grecian republics; and\r\nthey are without comparison more fertile than most of them. There are\r\nnow republics in Italy, in Germany, and in Switzerland, which do not\r\npossess anything like so fair and ample a domain. There is scope for\r\nseven philosophers to proceed in their analytical experiments upon\r\nHarrington's seven different forms of republics, in the acres of this\r\none Duke. Hitherto they have been wholly unproductive to\r\nspeculation,--fitted for nothing but to fatten bullocks, and to produce\r\ngrain for beer, still more to stupefy the dull English understanding.\r\nAbbé Sieyès has whole nests of pigeon-holes full of constitutions\r\nready-made, ticketed, sorted, and numbered, suited to every season and\r\nevery fancy: some with the top of the pattern at the bottom, and some\r\nwith the bottom at the top; some plain, some flowered; some\r\ndistinguished for their simplicity, others for their complexity; some of\r\nblood color, some of _boue de Paris_; some with directories, others\r\nwithout a direction; some with councils of elders and councils of\r\nyoungsters, some without any council at all; some where the electors\r\nchoose the representatives, others where the representatives choose the\r\nelectors; some in long coats, and some in short cloaks; some with\r\npantaloons, some without breeches; some with five-shilling\r\nqualifications, some totally unqualified. So that no\r\nconstitution-fancier may go unsuited from his shop, provided he loves a\r\npattern of pillage, oppression, arbitrary imprisonment, confiscation,\r\nexile, revolutionary judgment, and legalized premeditated murder, in any\r\nshapes into which they can be put. What a pity it is that the progress\r\nof experimental philosophy should be checked by his Grace's monopoly!\r\nSuch are their sentiments, I assure him; such is their language, when\r\nthey dare to speak; and such are their proceedings, when they have the\r\nmeans to act.\r\n\r\nTheir geographers and geometricians have been some time out of practice.\r\nIt is some time since they have divided their own country into squares.\r\nThat figure has lost the charms of its novelty. They want new lands for\r\nnew trials. It is not only the geometricians of the Republic that find\r\nhim a good subject: the chemists have bespoke him, after the\r\ngeometricians have done with him. As the first set have an eye on his\r\nGrace's lands, the chemists are not less taken with his buildings. They\r\nconsider mortar as a very anti-revolutionary invention, in its present\r\nstate, but, properly employed, an admirable material for overturning all\r\nestablishments. They have found that the gunpowder of _ruins_ is far\r\nthe fittest for making other _ruins_, and so _ad infinitum_. They have\r\ncalculated what quantity of matter convertible into nitre is to be found\r\nin Bedford House, in Woburn Abbey, and in what his Grace and his\r\ntrustees have still suffered to stand of that foolish royalist, Inigo\r\nJones, in Covent Garden. Churches, play-houses, coffeehouses, all alike,\r\nare destined to be mingled, and equalized, and blended into one common\r\nrubbish,--and, well sifted, and lixiviated, to crystallize into true,\r\ndemocratic, explosive, insurrectionary nitre. Their Academy _del\r\nCimento_, (_per antiphrasin_,) with Morveau and Hassenfratz at its head,\r\nhave computed that the brave _sans-culottes_ may make war on all the\r\naristocracy of Europe for a twelvemonth out of the rubbish of the Duke\r\nof Bedford's buildings.[21]\r\n\r\nWhile the Morveaux and Priestleys are proceeding with these experiments\r\nupon the Duke of Bedford's houses, the Sieyès, and the rest of the\r\nanalytical legislators and constitution-venders, are quite as busy in\r\ntheir trade of decomposing organization, in forming his Grace's vassals\r\ninto primary assemblies, national guards, first, second, and third\r\nrequisitioners, committees of research, conductors of the travelling\r\nguillotine, judges of revolutionary tribunals, legislative hangmen,\r\nsupervisors of domiciliary visitation, exactors of forced loans, and\r\nassessors of the maximum.\r\n\r\nThe din of all this smithery may some time or other possibly wake this\r\nnoble Duke, and push him to an endeavor to save some little matter from\r\ntheir experimental philosophy. If he pleads his grants from the crown,\r\nhe is ruined at the outset. If he pleads he has received them from the\r\npillage of superstitious corporations, this indeed will stagger them a\r\nlittle, because they are enemies to all corporations and to all\r\nreligion. However, they will soon recover themselves, and will tell his\r\nGrace, or his learned council, that all such property belongs to the\r\n_nation_,--and that it would be more wise for him, if he wishes to live\r\nthe natural term of a _citizen_, (that is, according to Condorcet's\r\ncalculation, six months on an average,) not to pass for an usurper upon\r\nthe national property. This is what the _serjeants_-at-law of the rights\r\nof man will say to the puny _apprentices_ of the common law of England.\r\n\r\nIs the genius of philosophy not yet known? You may as well think the\r\ngarden of the Tuileries was well protected with the cords of ribbon\r\ninsultingly stretched by the National Assembly to keep the sovereign\r\n_canaille_ from intruding on the retirement of the poor King of the\r\nFrench as that such flimsy cobwebs will stand between the savages of the\r\nRevolution and their natural prey. Deep philosophers are no triflers;\r\nbrave _sans-culottes_ are no formalists. They will no more regard a\r\nMarquis of Tavistock than an Abbot of Tavistock; the Lord of Woburn will\r\nnot be more respectable in their eyes than the Prior of Woburn; they\r\nwill make no difference between the superior of a Covent Garden of nuns\r\nand of a Covent Garden of another description. They will not care a rush\r\nwhether his coat is long or short,--whether the color be purple, or blue\r\nand buff. They will not trouble _their_ heads with what part of _his_\r\nhead his hair is out from; and they will look with equal respect on a\r\ntonsure and a crop. Their only question will be that of their Legendre,\r\nor some oilier of their legislative butchers: How he cuts up; how he\r\ntallows in the caul or on the kidneys.\r\n\r\nIs it not a singular phenomenon, that, whilst the _sans-culotte_\r\ncarcass-butchers and the philosophers of the shambles are pricking their\r\ndotted lines upon his hide, and, like the print of the poor ox that we\r\nsee in the shop-windows at Charing Cross, alive as he is, and thinking\r\nno harm in the world, he is divided into rumps, and sirloins, and\r\nbriskets, and into all sorts of pieces for roasting, boiling, and\r\nstewing, that, all the while they are measuring _him_, his Grace is\r\nmeasuring _me_,--is invidiously comparing the bounty of the crown with\r\nthe deserts of the defender of his order, and in the same moment fawning\r\non those who have the knife half out of the sheath? Poor innocent!\r\n\r\n    \"Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food,\r\n    And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood.\"\r\n\r\nNo man lives too long who lives to do with spirit and suffer with\r\nresignation what Providence pleases to command or inflict; but, indeed,\r\nthey are sharp incommodities which beset old age. It was but the other\r\nday, that, on putting in order some things which had been brought here,\r\non my taking leave of London forever, I looked over a number of fine\r\nportraits, most of them of persons now dead, but whose society, in my\r\nbetter days, made this a proud and happy place. Amongst those was the\r\npicture of Lord Keppel. It was painted by an artist worthy of the\r\nsubject, the excellent friend of that excellent man from their earliest\r\nyouth, and a common friend of us both, with whom we lived for many years\r\nwithout a moment of coldness, of peevishness, of jealousy, or of jar, to\r\nthe day of our final separation.\r\n\r\nI ever looked on Lord Keppel as one of the greatest and best men of his\r\nage, and I loved and cultivated him accordingly. He was much in my\r\nheart, and I believe I was in his to the very last beat. It was after\r\nhis trial at Portsmouth that he gave me this picture. With what zeal and\r\nanxious affection I attended him through that his agony of glory,--what\r\npart my son, in the early flush and enthusiasm of his virtue, and the\r\npious passion with which he attached himself to all my\r\nconnections,--with what prodigality we both squandered ourselves in\r\ncourting almost every sort of enmity for his sake, I believe he felt,\r\njust as I should have felt such friendship on such an occasion. I\r\npartook, indeed, of this honor with several of the first and best and\r\nablest in the kingdom, but I was behindhand with none of them; and I am\r\nsure, that, if, to the eternal disgrace of this nation, and to the total\r\nannihilation of every trace of honor and virtue in it, things had taken\r\na different turn from what they did. I should have attended him to the\r\nquarter-deck with no less good-will and more pride, though with far\r\nother feelings, than I partook of the general flow of national joy that\r\nattended the justice that was done to his virtue.\r\n\r\nPardon, my Lord, the feeble garrulity of age, which loves to diffuse\r\nitself in discourse of the departed great. At my years we live in\r\nretrospect alone; and, wholly unfitted for the society of vigorous life,\r\nwe enjoy, the best balm to all wounds, the consolation of friendship, in\r\nthose only whom we have lost forever. Feeling the loss of Lord Keppel at\r\nall times, at no time did I feel it so much as on the first day when I\r\nwas attacked in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nHad he lived, that reverend form would have risen in its place, and,\r\nwith a mild, parental reprehension to his nephew, the Duke of Bedford,\r\nhe would have told him that the favor of that gracious prince who had\r\nhonored his virtues with the government of the navy of Great Britain,\r\nand with a seat in the hereditary great council of his kingdom, was not\r\nundeservedly shown to the friend of the best portion of his life, and\r\nhis faithful companion and counsellor under his rudest trials. He would\r\nhave told him, that, to whomever else these reproaches might be\r\nbecoming, they were not decorous in his near kindred. He would have told\r\nhim, that, when men in that rank lose decorum, they lose everything.\r\n\r\nOn that day I had a loss in Lord Keppel. But the public loss of him in\r\nthis awful crisis!--I speak from much knowledge of the person: he never\r\nwould have listened to any compromise with the rabble rout of this\r\n_sans-culotterie_ of France. His goodness of heart, his reason, his\r\ntaste, his public duty, his principles, his prejudices, would have\r\nrepelled him forever from all connection with that horrid medley of\r\nmadness, vice, impiety, and crime.\r\n\r\nLord Keppel had two countries: one of descent, and one of birth. Their\r\ninterest and their glory are the same; and his mind was capacious of\r\nboth. His family was noble, and it was Dutch: that is, he was of the\r\noldest and purest nobility that Europe can boast, among a people\r\nrenowned above all others for love of their native land. Though it was\r\nnever shown in insult to any human being, Lord Keppel was something\r\nhigh. It was a wild stock of pride, on which the tenderest of all hearts\r\nhad grafted the milder virtues. He valued ancient nobility; and he was\r\nnot disinclined to augment it with new honors. He valued the old\r\nnobility and the new, not as an excuse for inglorious sloth, but as an\r\nincitement to virtuous activity. He considered it as a sort of cure for\r\nselfishness and a narrow mind,--conceiving that a man born in an\r\nelevated place in himself was nothing, but everything in what went\r\nbefore and what was to come after him. Without much speculation, but by\r\nthe sure instinct of ingenuous feelings, and by the dictates of plain,\r\nunsophisticated, natural understanding, he felt that no great\r\ncommonwealth could by any possibility long subsist without a body of\r\nsome kind or other of nobility decorated with honor and fortified by\r\nprivilege. This nobility forms the chain that connects the ages of a\r\nnation, which otherwise (with Mr. Paine) would soon be taught that no\r\none generation can bind another. He felt that no political fabric could\r\nbe well made, without some such order of things as might, through a\r\nseries of time, afford a rational hope of securing unity, coherence,\r\nconsistency, and stability to the state. He felt that nothing else can\r\nprotect it against the levity of courts and the greater levity of the\r\nmultitude; that to talk of hereditary monarchy, without anything else of\r\nhereditary reverence in the commonwealth, was a low-minded absurdity,\r\nfit only for those detestable \"fools aspiring to be knaves\" who began to\r\nforge in 1789 the false money of the French Constitution; that it is one\r\nfatal objection to all _new_ fancied and _new fabricated_ republics,\r\n(among a people who, once possessing such an advantage, have wickedly\r\nand insolently rejected it,) that the _prejudice_ of an old nobility is\r\na thing that _cannot_ be made. It may be improved, it may be corrected,\r\nit may be replenished; men may be taken from it or aggregated to it; but\r\n_the thing itself_ is matter of _inveterate_ opinion, and therefore\r\n_cannot_ be matter of mere positive institution. He felt that this\r\nnobility, in fact, does not exist in wrong of other orders of the state,\r\nbut by them, and for them.\r\n\r\nI knew the man I speak of: and if we can divine the future out of what\r\nwe collect from the past, no person living would look with more scorn\r\nand horror on the impious parricide committed on all their ancestry, and\r\non the desperate attainder passed on all their posterity, by the\r\nOrléans, and the Rochefoucaults, and the Fayettes, and the Vicomtes de\r\nNoailles, and the false Périgords, and the long _et cetera_ of the\r\nperfidious _sans-culottes_ of the court, who, like demoniacs possessed\r\nwith a spirit of fallen pride and inverted ambition, abdicated their\r\ndignities, disowned their families, betrayed the most sacred of all\r\ntrusts, and, by breaking to pieces a great link of society and all the\r\ncramps and holdings of the state, brought eternal confusion and\r\ndesolation on their country. For the fate of the miscreant parricides\r\nthemselves he would have had no pity. Compassion for the myriads of men,\r\nof whom the world was not worthy, who by their means have perished in\r\nprisons or on scaffolds, or are pining in beggary and exile, would leave\r\nno room in his, or in any well-formed mind, for any such sensation. We\r\nare not made at once to pity the oppressor and the oppressed.\r\n\r\nLooking to his Batavian descent, how could he bear to behold his\r\nkindred, the descendants of the brave nobility of Holland, whose blood,\r\nprodigally poured out, had, more than all the canals, meres, and\r\ninundations of their country, protected their independence, to behold\r\nthem bowed in the basest servitude to the basest and vilest of the human\r\nrace,--in servitude to those who in no respect were superior in dignity\r\nor could aspire to a better place than that of hangmen to the tyrants to\r\nwhose sceptred pride they had opposed an elevation of soul that\r\nsurmounted and overpowered the loftiness of Castile, the haughtiness of\r\nAustria, and the overbearing arrogance of France?\r\n\r\nCould he with patience bear that the children of that nobility who would\r\nhave deluged their country and given it to the sea rather than submit to\r\nLouis the Fourteenth, who was then in his meridian glory, when his arms\r\nwere conducted by the Turennes, by the Luxembourgs, by the Boufflers,\r\nwhen his councils were directed by the Colberts and the Louvois, when\r\nhis tribunals were filled by the Lamoignons and the D'Aguesseaus,--that\r\nthese should be given up to the cruel sport of the Pichegrus, the\r\nJourdans, the Santerres, under the Rolands, and Brissots, and Gorsas,\r\nand Robespierres, the Reubells, the Carnots, and Talliens, and Dantons,\r\nand the whole tribe of regicides, robbers, and revolutionary judges,\r\nthat from the rotten carcass of their own murdered country have poured\r\nout innumerable swarms of the lowest and at once the most destructive of\r\nthe classes of animated Nature, which like columns of locusts have laid\r\nwaste the fairest part of the world?\r\n\r\nWould Keppel have borne to see the ruin of the virtuous patricians, that\r\nhappy union of the noble and the burgher, who with signal prudence and\r\nintegrity had long governed the cities of the confederate republic, the\r\ncherishing fathers of their country, who, denying commerce to\r\nthemselves, made it flourish in a manner unexampled under their\r\nprotection? Could Keppel have borne that a vile faction should totally\r\ndestroy this harmonious construction, in favor of a robbing democracy\r\nfounded on the spurious rights of man?\r\n\r\nHe was no great clerk, but he was perfectly well versed in the interests\r\nof Europe, and he could not have heard with patience that the country of\r\nGrotius, the cradle of the law of nations, and one of the richest\r\nrepositories of all law, should be taught a new code by the ignorant\r\nflippancy of Thomas Paine, the presumptuous foppery of La Fayette, with\r\nhis stolen rights of man in his hand, the wild, profligate intrigue and\r\nturbulency of Marat, and the impious sophistry of Condorcet, in his\r\ninsolent addresses to the Batavian Republic.\r\n\r\nCould Keppel, who idolized the House of Nassau, who was himself given to\r\nEngland along with the blessings of the British and Dutch Revolutions,\r\nwith Revolutions of stability, with Revolutions which consolidated and\r\nmarried the liberties and the interests of the two nations\r\nforever,--could he see the fountain of British liberty itself in\r\nservitude to France? Could he see with patience a Prince of Orange\r\nexpelled, as a sort of diminutive despot, with every kind of contumely,\r\nfrom the country which that family of deliverers had so often rescued\r\nfrom slavery, and obliged to live in exile in another country, which\r\nowes its liberty to his house?\r\n\r\nWould Keppel have heard with patience that the conduct to be held on\r\nsuch occasions was to become short by the knees to the faction of the\r\nhomicides, to entreat them quietly to retire? or, if the fortune of war\r\nshould drive them from their first wicked and unprovoked invasion, that\r\nno security should be taken, no arrangement made, no barrier formed, no\r\nalliance entered into for the security of that which under a foreign\r\nname is the most precious part of England? What would he have said, if\r\nit was even proposed that the Austrian Netherlands (which ought to be a\r\nbarrier to Holland, and the tie of an alliance to protect her against\r\nany species of rule that might be erected or even be restored in France)\r\nshould be formed into a republic under her influence and dependent upon\r\nher power?\r\n\r\nBut above all, what would he have said, if he had heard it made a matter\r\nof accusation against me, by his nephew, the Duke of Bedford, that I was\r\nthe author of the war? Had I a mind to keep that high distinction to\r\nmyself, (as from pride I might, but from justice I dare not,) he would\r\nhave snatched his share of it from my hand, and held it with the grasp\r\nof a dying convulsion to his end.\r\n\r\nIt would be a most arrogant presumption in me to assume to myself the\r\nglory of what belongs to his Majesty, and to his ministers, and to his\r\nParliament, and to the far greater majority of his faithful people: but\r\nhad I stood alone to counsel, and that all were determined to be guided\r\nby my advice, and to follow it implicitly, then I should have been the\r\nsole author of a war. But it should have been a war on my ideas and my\r\nprinciples. However, let his Grace think as he may of my demerits with\r\nregard to the war with Regicide, he will find my guilt confined to that\r\nalone. He never shall, with the smallest color of reason, accuse me of\r\nbeing the author of a peace with Regicide.--But that is high matter, and\r\nought not to be mixed with anything of so little moment as what may\r\nbelong to me, or even to the Duke of Bedford.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, &c.\r\n\r\nEDMUND BURKE.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15]\r\n\r\n    Tristius haud illis monstrum, nec sævior ulla\r\n    Pestis et ira Deûm Stygiis sese extulit undis.\r\n    Virginei volucrum vultus, fœdissima ventris\r\n    Proluvies, uncæque manus, et pallida semper\r\n    Ora fame.\r\n\r\nHere the poet breaks the line, because he (and that _he_ is Virgil) had\r\nnot verse or language to describe that monster even as he had conceived\r\nher.

We could not easily account for some\r\nunpleasant appearances. They were represented to us as indicating the\r\nstate of the popular mind; and they were not at all what we should have\r\nexpected from our old ideas even of the faults and vices of the English\r\ncharacter. The disastrous events which have followed one upon another in\r\na long, unbroken, funereal train, moving in a procession that seemed to\r\nhave no end,--these were not the principal causes of our dejection. We\r\nfeared more from what threatened to fail within than what menaced to\r\noppress us from abroad. To a people who have once been proud and great,\r\nand great because they were proud, a change in the national spirit is\r\nthe most terrible of all revolutions.\r\n\r\nI shall not live to behold the unravelling of the intricate plot which\r\nsaddens and perplexes the awful drama of Providence now acting on the\r\nmoral theatre of the world. Whether for thought or for action, I am at\r\nthe end of my career. You are in the middle of yours. In what part of\r\nits orbit the nation with which we are carried along moves at this\r\ninstant it is not easy to conjecture. It may, perhaps, be far advanced\r\nin its aphelion,--but when to return?\r\n\r\nNot to lose ourselves in the infinite void of the conjectural world, our\r\nbusiness is with what is likely to be affected, for the better or the\r\nworse, by the wisdom or weakness of our plans. In all speculations upon\r\nmen and human affairs, it is of no small moment to distinguish things of\r\naccident from permanent causes, and from effects that cannot be altered.\r\nIt is not every irregularity in our movement that is a total deviation\r\nfrom our course. I am not quite of the mind of those speculators who\r\nseem assured that necessarily, and by the constitution of things, all\r\nstates have the same periods of infancy, manhood, and decrepitude that\r\nare found in the individuals who compose them. Parallels of this sort\r\nrather furnish similitudes to illustrate or to adorn than supply\r\nanalogies from whence to reason. The objects which are attempted to be\r\nforced into an analogy are not found in the same classes of existence.\r\nIndividuals are physical beings, subject to laws universal and\r\ninvariable. The immediate cause acting in these laws may be obscure: the\r\ngeneral results are subjects of certain calculation. But commonwealths\r\nare not physical, but moral essences. They are artificial combinations,\r\nand, in their proximate efficient cause, the arbitrary productions of\r\nthe human mind. We are not yet acquainted with the laws which\r\nnecessarily influence the stability of that kind of work made by that\r\nkind of agent. There is not in the physical order (with which they do\r\nnot appear to hold any assignable connection) a distinct cause by which\r\nany of those fabrics must necessarily grow, flourish, or decay; nor, in\r\nmy opinion, does the moral world produce anything more determinate on\r\nthat subject than what may serve as an amusement (liberal, indeed, and\r\ningenious, but still only an amusement) for speculative men. I doubt\r\nwhether the history of mankind is yet complete enough, if ever it can be\r\nso, to furnish grounds for a sure theory on the internal causes which\r\nnecessarily affect the fortune of a state. I am far from denying the\r\noperation of such causes: but they are infinitely uncertain, and much\r\nmore obscure, and much more difficult to trace, than the foreign causes\r\nthat tend to raise, to depress, and sometimes to overwhelm a community.\r\n\r\nIt is often impossible, in these political inquiries, to find any\r\nproportion between the apparent force of any moral causes we may assign\r\nand their known operation. We are therefore obliged to deliver up that\r\noperation to mere chance, or, more piously, (perhaps more rationally,)\r\nto the occasional interposition and irresistible hand of the Great\r\nDisposer. We have seen states of considerable duration, which for ages\r\nhave remained nearly as they have begun, and could hardly be said to ebb\r\nor flow. Some appear to have spent their vigor at their commencement.\r\nSome have blazed out in their glory a little before their extinction.\r\nThe meridian of some has been the most splendid. Others, and they the\r\ngreatest number, have fluctuated, and experienced at different periods\r\nof their existence a great variety of fortune. At the very moment when\r\nsome of them seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and\r\ndisaster, they have suddenly emerged. They have begun a new course and\r\nopened a new reckoning, and even in the depths of their calamity and on\r\nthe very ruins of their country have laid the foundations of a towering\r\nand durable greatness. All this has happened without any apparent\r\nprevious change in the general circumstances which had brought on their\r\ndistress. The death of a man at a critical juncture, his disgust, his\r\nretreat, his disgrace, have brought innumerable calamities on a whole\r\nnation. A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have\r\nchanged the face of fortune, and almost of Nature.\r\n\r\nSuch, and often influenced by such causes, has commonly been the fate of\r\nmonarchies of long duration. They have their ebbs and their flows. This\r\nhas been eminently the fate of the monarchy of France. There have been\r\ntimes in which no power has ever been brought so low. Few have ever\r\nflourished in greater glory. By turns elevated and depressed, that power\r\nhad been, on the whole, rather on the increase; and it continued not\r\nonly powerful, but formidable, to the hour of the total ruin of the\r\nmonarchy. This fall of the monarchy was far from being preceded by any\r\nexterior symptoms of decline. The interior were not visible to every\r\neye; and a thousand accidents might have prevented the operation of what\r\nthe most clear-sighted were not able to discern nor the most provident\r\nto divine. A very little time before its dreadful catastrophe, there was\r\na kind of exterior splendor in the situation of the crown, which usually\r\nadds to government strength and authority at home. The crown seemed then\r\nto have obtained some of the most splendid objects of state ambition.\r\nNone of the Continental powers of Europe were the enemies of France.\r\nThey were all either tacitly disposed to her or publicly connected with\r\nher; and in those who kept the most aloof there was little appearance of\r\njealousy,--of animosity there was no appearance at all. The British\r\nnation, her great preponderating rival, she had humbled, to all\r\nappearance she had weakened, certainly had endangered, by cutting off a\r\nvery large and by far the most growing part of her empire. In that its\r\nacme of human prosperity and greatness, in the high and palmy state of\r\nthe monarchy of France, it fell to the ground without a struggle. It\r\nfell without any of those vices in the monarch which have sometimes been\r\nthe causes of the fall of kingdoms, but which existed, without any\r\nvisible effect on the state, in the highest degree in many other\r\nprinces, and, far from destroying their power, had only left some slight\r\nstains on their character. The financial difficulties were only pretexts\r\nand instruments of those who accomplished the ruin of that monarchy;\r\nthey were not the causes of it.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the old government, deprived in a manner of all government,\r\nFrance, fallen as a monarchy, to common speculators might have appeared\r\nmore likely to be an object of pity or insult, according to the\r\ndisposition of the circumjacent powers, than to be the scourge and\r\nterror of them all: but out of the tomb of the murdered monarchy in\r\nFrance has arisen a vast, tremendous, unformed spectre, in a far more\r\nterrific guise than any which ever yet have overpowered the imagination\r\nand subdued the fortitude of man. Going straight forward to its end,\r\nunappalled by peril, unchecked by remorse, despising all common maxims\r\nand all common means, that hideous phantom overpowered those who could\r\nnot believe it was possible she could at all exist, except on the\r\nprinciples which habit rather than Nature had persuaded them were\r\nnecessary to their own particular welfare and to their own ordinary\r\nmodes of action. But the constitution of any political being, as well as\r\nthat of any physical being, ought to be known, before one can venture to\r\nsay what is fit for its conservation, or what is the proper means of its\r\npower. The poison of other states is the food of the new Republic. That\r\nbankruptcy, the very apprehension of which is one of the causes assigned\r\nfor the fall of the monarchy, was the capital on which she opened her\r\ntraffic with the world.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Regicide, with an annihilated revenue, with defaced\r\nmanufactures, with a ruined commerce, with an uncultivated and\r\nhalf-depopulated country, with a discontented, distressed, enslaved, and\r\nfamished people, passing, with a rapid, eccentric, incalculable course,\r\nfrom the wildest anarchy to the sternest despotism, has actually\r\nconquered the finest parts of Europe, has distressed, disunited,\r\nderanged, and broke to pieces all the rest, and so subdued the minds of\r\nthe rulers in every nation, that hardly any resource presents itself to\r\nthem, except that of entitling themselves to a contemptuous mercy by a\r\ndisplay of their imbecility and meanness. Even in their greatest\r\nmilitary efforts, and the greatest display of their fortitude, they seem\r\nnot to hope, they do not even appear to wish, the extinction of what\r\nsubsists to their certain ruin. Their ambition is only to be admitted to\r\na more favored class in the order of servitude under that domineering\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThis seems the temper of the day. At first the French force was too much\r\ndespised. Now it is too much dreaded. As inconsiderate courage has given\r\nway to irrational fear, so it may be hoped, that, through the medium of\r\ndeliberate, sober apprehension, we may arrive at steady fortitude. Who\r\nknows whether indignation may not succeed to terror, and the revival of\r\nhigh sentiment, spurning away the delusion of a safety purchased at the\r\nexpense of glory, may not yet drive us to that generous despair which\r\nhas often subdued distempers in the state for which no remedy could be\r\nfound in the wisest councils?\r\n\r\nOther great states having been without any regular, certain course of\r\nelevation or decline, we may hope that the British fortune may fluctuate\r\nalso; because the public mind, which greatly influences that fortune,\r\nmay have its changes. We are therefore never authorized to abandon our\r\ncountry to its fate, or to act or advise as if it had no resource. There\r\nis no reason to apprehend, because ordinary means threaten to fail, that\r\nno others can spring up. Whilst our heart is whole, it will find means,\r\nor make them. The heart of the citizen is a perennial spring of energy\r\nto the state. Because the pulse seems to intermit, we must not presume\r\nthat it will cease instantly to beat. The public must never be regarded\r\nas incurable. I remember, in the beginning of what has lately been\r\ncalled the Seven Years' War, that an eloquent writer and ingenious\r\nspeculator, Dr. Brown, upon some reverses which happened in the\r\nbeginning of that war, published an elaborate philosophical discourse to\r\nprove that the distinguishing features of the people of England had been\r\ntotally changed, and that a frivolous effeminacy was become the national\r\ncharacter. Nothing could be more popular than that work. It was thought\r\na great consolation to us, the light people of this country, (who were\r\nand are light, but who were not and are not effeminate,) that we had\r\nfound the causes of our misfortunes in our vices. Pythagoras could not\r\nbe more pleased with his leading discovery. But whilst, in that\r\nsplenetic mood, we amused ourselves in a sour, critical speculation, of\r\nwhich we were ourselves the objects, and in which every man lost his\r\nparticular sense of the public disgrace in the epidemic nature of the\r\ndistemper,--whilst, as in the Alps, goitre kept goitre in\r\ncountenance,--whilst we were thus abandoning ourselves to a direct\r\nconfession of our inferiority to France, and whilst many, very many,\r\nwere ready to act upon a sense of that inferiority,--a few months\r\neffected a total change in our variable minds. We emerged from the gulf\r\nof that speculative despondency, and wore buoyed up to the highest point\r\nof practical vigor. Never did the masculine spirit of England display\r\nitself with more energy, nor ever did its genius soar with a prouder\r\npreëminence over France, than at the time when frivolity and effeminacy\r\nhad been at least tacitly acknowledged as their national character by\r\nthe good people of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nFor one, (if they be properly treated,) I despair neither of the public\r\nfortune nor of the public mind. There is much to be done, undoubtedly,\r\nand much to be retrieved. We must walk in new ways, or we can never\r\nencounter our enemy in his devious march. We are not at an end of our\r\nstruggle, nor near it. Let us not deceive ourselves: we are at the\r\nbeginning of great troubles. I readily acknowledge that the state of\r\npublic affairs is infinitely more unpromising than at the period I have\r\njust now alluded to; and the position of all the powers of Europe, in\r\nrelation to us, and in relation to each other, is more intricate and\r\ncritical beyond all comparison. Difficult indeed is our situation. In\r\nall situations of difficulty, men will be influenced in the part they\r\ntake, not only by the reason of the case, but by the peculiar turn of\r\ntheir own character. The same ways to safety do not present themselves\r\nto all men, nor to the same men in different tempers. There is a\r\ncourageous wisdom: there is also a false, reptile prudence, the result,\r\nnot of caution, but of fear. Under misfortunes, it often happens that\r\nthe nerves of the understanding are so relaxed, the pressing peril of\r\nthe hour so completely confounds all the faculties, that no future\r\ndanger can be properly provided for, can be justly estimated, can be so\r\nmuch as fully seen. The eye of the mind is dazzled and vanquished. An\r\nabject distrust of ourselves, an extravagant admiration of the enemy,\r\npresent us with no hope but in a compromise with his pride by a\r\nsubmission to his will. This short plan of policy is the only counsel\r\nwhich will obtain a hearing. We plunge into a dark gulf with all the\r\nrash precipitation of fear. The nature of courage is, without a\r\nquestion, to be conversant with danger: but in the palpable night of\r\ntheir terrors, men under consternation suppose, not that it is the\r\ndanger which by a sure instinct calls out the courage to resist it, but\r\nthat it is the courage which produces the danger. They therefore seek\r\nfor a refuge from their fears in the fears themselves, and consider a\r\ntemporizing meanness as the only source of safety.\r\n\r\nThe rules and definitions of prudence can rarely be exact, never\r\nuniversal. I do not deny, that, in small, truckling states, a timely\r\ncompromise with power has often been the means, and the only means; of\r\ndrawling out their puny existence; but a great state is too much\r\nenvied, too much dreaded, to find safety in humiliation. To be secure,\r\nit must be respected. Power and eminence and consideration are things\r\nnot to be begged; they must be commanded: and they who supplicate for\r\nmercy from others can never hope for justice through themselves. What\r\njustice they are to obtain, as the alms of an enemy, depends upon his\r\ncharacter; and that they ought well to know before they implicitly\r\nconfide.\r\n\r\nMuch controversy there has been in Parliament, and not a little amongst\r\nus out of doors, about the instrumental means of this nation towards the\r\nmaintenance of her dignity and the assertion of her rights. On the most\r\nelaborate and correct detail of facts, the result seems to be, that at\r\nno time has the wealth and power of Great Britain been so considerable\r\nas it is at this very perilous moment. We have a, vast interest to\r\npreserve, and we possess great means of preserving it: but it is to be\r\nremembered that the artificer may be incumbered by his tools, and that\r\nresources may be among impediments. If wealth is the obedient and\r\nlaborious slave of virtue and of public honor, then wealth is in its\r\nplace and has its use; but if this order is changed, and honor is to be\r\nsacrificed to the conservation of riches, riches, which have neither\r\neyes nor hands, nor anything truly vital in them, cannot long survive\r\nthe being of their vivifying powers, their legitimate masters, and their\r\npotent protectors. If we command our wealth, we shall be rich and free:\r\nif our wealth commands us, we are poor indeed. We are bought by the\r\nenemy with the treasure from our own coffers. Too great a sense of the\r\nvalue of a subordinate interest may be the very source of its danger, as\r\nwell as the certain ruin of interests of a superior order. Often has a\r\nman lost his all because he would not submit to hazard all in defending\r\nit. A display of our wealth before robbers is not the way to restrain\r\ntheir boldness or to lessen their rapacity. This display is made, I\r\nknow, to persuade the people of England that thereby we shall awe the\r\nenemy and improve the terms of our capitulation: it is made, not that we\r\nshould fight with more animation, but that we should supplicate with\r\nbetter hopes. We are mistaken. We have an enemy to deal with who never\r\nregarded our contest as a measuring and weighing of purses. He is the\r\nGaul that puts his _sword_ into the scale. He is more tempted with our\r\nwealth as booty than terrified with it as power. But let us be rich or\r\npoor, let us be either in what proportion we may, Nature is false or\r\nthis is true, that, where the essential public force (of which money is\r\nbut a part) is in any degree upon a par in a conflict between nations,\r\nthat state which is resolved to hazard its existence rather than to\r\nabandon its objects must have an infinite advantage over that which is\r\nresolved to yield rather than to carry its resistance beyond a certain\r\npoint. Humanly speaking, that people which bounds its efforts only with\r\nits being must give the law to that nation which will not push its\r\nopposition beyond its convenience.\r\n\r\nIf we look to nothing but our domestic condition, the state of the\r\nnation is full even to plethora; but if we imagine that this country can\r\nlong maintain its blood and its food as disjoined from the community of\r\nmankind, such an opinion does not deserve refutation as absurd, but pity\r\nas insane.\r\n\r\nI do not know that such an improvident and stupid selfishness deserves\r\nthe discussion which perhaps I may bestow upon it hereafter. We cannot\r\narrange with our enemy, in the present conjuncture, without abandoning\r\nthe interest of mankind. If we look only to our own petty _peculium_ in\r\nthe war, we have had some advantages,--advantages ambiguous in their\r\nnature, and dearly bought. We have not in the slightest degree impaired\r\nthe strength of the common enemy in any one of those points in which his\r\nparticular force consists,--at the same time that new enemies to\r\nourselves, new allies to the Regicide Republic, have been made out of\r\nthe wrecks and fragments of the general confederacy. So far as to the\r\nselfish part. As composing a part of the community of Europe, and\r\ninterested in its fate, it is not easy to conceive a state of things\r\nmore doubtful and perplexing. When Louis the Fourteenth had made himself\r\nmaster of one of the largest and most important provinces of\r\nSpain,--when he had in a manner overrun Lombardy, and was thundering at\r\nthe gates of Turin,--when he had mastered almost all Germany on this\r\nside the Rhine,--when he was on the point of ruining the august fabric\r\nof the Empire,--when, with the Elector of Bavaria in his alliance,\r\nhardly anything interposed between him and Vienna,--when the Turk hung\r\nwith a mighty force over the Empire on the other side,--I do not know\r\nthat in the beginning of 1704 (that is, in the third year of the\r\nrenovated war with Louis the Fourteenth) the state of Europe was so\r\ntruly alarming. To England it certainly was not. Holland (and Holland is\r\na matter to England of value inestimable) was then powerful, was then\r\nindependent, and, though greatly endangered, was then full of energy and\r\nspirit. But the great resource of Europe was in England: not in a sort\r\nof England detached from the rest of the world, and amusing herself\r\nwith the puppet-show of a naval power, (it can be no better, whilst all\r\nthe sources of that power, and of every sort of power, are precarious,)\r\nbut in that sort of England who considered herself as embodied with\r\nEurope, but in that sort of England who, sympathetic with the adversity\r\nor the happiness of mankind, felt that nothing in human affairs was\r\nforeign to her. We may consider it as a sure axiom, that, as, on the one\r\nhand, no confederacy of the least effect or duration can exist against\r\nFrance, of which England is not only a part, but the head, so neither\r\ncan England pretend to cope with France but as connected with the body\r\nof Christendom.\r\n\r\nOur account of the war, _as a war of communion_, to the very point in\r\nwhich we began to throw out lures, oglings, and glances for peace, was a\r\nwar of disaster, and of little else. The independent advantages obtained\r\nby us at the beginning of the war, and which were made at the expense of\r\nthat common cause, if they deceive us about our largest and our surest\r\ninterest, are to be reckoned amongst our heaviest losses.\r\n\r\nThe Allies, and Great Britain amongst the rest, (and perhaps amongst the\r\nforemost,) have been miserably deluded by this great, fundamental error:\r\nthat it was in our power to make peace with this monster of a state,\r\nwhenever we chose to forget the crimes that made it great and the\r\ndesigns that made it formidable. People imagined that their ceasing to\r\nresist was the sure way to be secure. This \"pale cast of thought\"\r\nsicklied over all their enterprises, and turned all their politics awry.\r\nThey could not, or rather they would not, read, in the most unequivocal\r\ndeclarations of the enemy, and in his uniform conduct, that more safety\r\nwas to be found in the most arduous war than in the friendship of that\r\nkind of being. Its hostile amity can be obtained on no terms that do not\r\nimply an inability hereafter to resist its designs. This great, prolific\r\nerror (I mean that peace was always in our power) has been the cause\r\nthat rendered the Allies indifferent about the _direction_ of the war,\r\nand persuaded them that they might always risk a choice and even a\r\nchange in its objects. They seldom improved any advantage,--hoping that\r\nthe enemy, affected by it, would make a proffer of peace. Hence it was\r\nthat all their early victories have been followed almost immediately\r\nwith the usual effects of a defeat, whilst all the advantages obtained\r\nby the Regicides have been followed by the consequences that were\r\nnatural. The discomfitures which the Republic of Assassins has suffered\r\nhave uniformly called forth new exertions, which not only repaired old\r\nlosses, but prepared new conquests. The losses of the Allies, on the\r\ncontrary, (no provision having been made on the speculation of such an\r\nevent,) have been followed by desertion, by dismay, by disunion, by a\r\ndereliction of their policy, by a flight from their principles, by an\r\nadmiration of the enemy, by mutual accusations, by a distrust in every\r\nmember of the Alliance of its fellow, of its cause, its power, and its\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nGreat difficulties in consequence of our erroneous policy, as I have\r\nsaid, press upon every side of us. Far from desiring to conceal or even\r\nto palliate the evil in the representation, I wish to lay it down as my\r\nfoundation, that never greater existed. In a moment when sudden panic is\r\napprehended, it may be wise for a while to conceal some great public\r\ndisaster, or to reveal it by degrees, until the minds of the people have\r\ntime to be re-collected, that their understanding may have leisure to\r\nrally, and that more steady councils may prevent their doing something\r\ndesperate under the first impressions of rage or terror. But with regard\r\nto a _general_ state of things, growing out of events and causes already\r\nknown in the gross, there is no piety in the fraud that covers its true\r\nnature; because nothing but erroneous resolutions can be the result of\r\nfalse representations. Those measures, which in common distress might be\r\navailable, in greater are no better than playing with the evil. That the\r\neffort may bear a proportion to the exigence, it is fit it should be\r\nknown,--known in its quality, in its extent, and in all the\r\ncircumstances which attend it. Great reverses of fortune there have\r\nbeen, and great embarrassments in council: a principled regicide enemy\r\npossessed of the most important part of Europe, and struggling for the\r\nrest; within ourselves a total relaxation of all authority, whilst a cry\r\nis raised against it, as if it were the most ferocious of all despotism.\r\nA worse phenomenon: our government disowned by the most efficient member\r\nof its tribunals,--ill-supported by any of their constituent parts,--and\r\nthe highest tribunal of all (from causes not for our present purpose to\r\nexamine) deprived of all that dignity and all that efficiency which\r\nmight enforce, or regulate, or, if the case required it, might supply\r\nthe want of every other court. Public prosecutions are become little\r\nbetter than schools for treason,--of no use but to improve the dexterity\r\nof criminals in the mystery of evasion, or to show with what complete\r\nimpunity men may conspire against the commonwealth, with what safety\r\nassassins may attempt its awful head. Everything is secure, except what\r\nthe laws have made sacred; everything is tameness and languor that is\r\nnot fury and faction. Whilst the distempers of a relaxed fibre\r\nprognosticate and prepare all the morbid force of convulsion in the body\r\nof the state, the steadiness of the physician is overpowered by the very\r\naspect of the disease.[22] The doctor of the Constitution, pretending to\r\nunderrate what he is not able to contend with, shrinks from his own\r\noperation. He doubts and questions the salutary, but critical, terrors\r\nof the cautery and the knife. He takes a poor credit even from his\r\ndefeat, and covers impotence under the mask of lenity. He praises the\r\nmoderation of the laws, as in his hands he sees them baffled and\r\ndespised. Is all this because in our day the statutes of the kingdom are\r\nnot engrossed in as firm a character and imprinted in as black and\r\nlegible a type as ever? No! the law is a clear, but it is a dead letter.\r\nDead and putrid, it is insufficient to save the state, but potent to\r\ninfect and to kill. Living law, full of reason, and of equity and\r\njustice, (as it is, or it should not exist,) ought to be severe, and\r\nawful too,--or the words of menace, whether written on the parchment\r\nroll of England or cut into the brazen tablet of Borne, will excite\r\nnothing but contempt. How comes it that in all the state prosecutions of\r\nmagnitude, from the Revolution to within these two or three years, the\r\ncrown has scarcely ever retired disgraced and defeated from its courts?\r\nWhence this alarming change? By a connection easily felt, and not\r\nimpossible to be traced to its cause, all the parts of the state have\r\ntheir correspondence and consent. They who bow to the enemy abroad will\r\nnot be of power to subdue the conspirator at home. It is impossible not\r\nto observe, that, in proportion as we approximate to the poisonous jaws\r\nof anarchy, the fascination grows irresistible. In proportion as we are\r\nattracted towards the focus of illegality, irreligion, and desperate\r\nenterprise, all the venomous and blighting insects of the state are\r\nawakened into life. The promise of the year is blasted and shrivelled\r\nand burned up before them. Our most salutary and most beautiful\r\ninstitutions yield nothing but dust and smut; the harvest of our law is\r\nno more than stubble. It is in the nature of these eruptive diseases in\r\nthe state to sink in by fits and reappear. But the fuel of the malady\r\nremains, and in my opinion is not in the smallest degree mitigated in\r\nits malignity, though it waits the favorable moment of a freer\r\ncommunication with the source of regicide to exert and to increase its\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIs it that the people are changed, that the commonwealth cannot be\r\nprotected by its laws? I hardly think it. On the contrary, I conceive\r\nthat these things happen because men are not changed, but remain always\r\nwhat they always were; they remain what the bulk of us ever must be,\r\nwhen abandoned to our vulgar propensities, without guide, leader, or\r\ncontrol: that is, made to be full of a blind elevation in prosperity; to\r\ndespise untried dangers; to be overpowered with unexpected reverses; to\r\nfind no clew in a labyrinth of difficulties; to get out of a present\r\ninconvenience with any risk of future ruin; to follow and to bow to\r\nfortune; to admire successful, though wicked enterprise, and to imitate\r\nwhat we admire; to contemn the government which announces danger from\r\nsacrilege and regicide whilst they are only in their infancy and their\r\nstruggle, but which finds nothing that can alarm in their adult state,\r\nand in the power and triumph of those destructive principles. In a mass\r\nwe cannot be left to ourselves. We must have leaders. If none will\r\nundertake to lead us right, we shall find guides who will contrive to\r\nconduct us to shame and ruin.\r\n\r\nWe are in a war of a _peculiar_ nature. It is not with an ordinary\r\ncommunity, which is hostile or friendly as passion or as interest may\r\nveer about,--not with a state which makes war through wantonness, and\r\nabandons it through lassitude. We are at war with a system which by its\r\nessence is inimical to all other governments, and which makes peace or\r\nwar as peace and war may best contribute to their subversion. It is with\r\nan _armed doctrine_ that we are at war. It has, by its essence, a\r\nfaction of opinion and of interest and of enthusiasm in every country.\r\nTo us it is a Colossus which bestrides our Channel. It has one foot on a\r\nforeign shore, the other upon the British soil. Thus advantaged, if it\r\ncan at all exist, it must finally prevail. Nothing can so completely\r\nruin any of the old governments, ours in particular, as the\r\nacknowledgment, directly or by implication, of any kind of superiority\r\nin this new power. This acknowledgment we make, if, in a bad or doubtful\r\nsituation of our affairs, we solicit peace, or if we yield to the modes\r\nof new humiliation in which alone she is content to give us an hearing.\r\nBy that means the terms cannot be of our choosing,--no, not in any part.\r\n\r\nIt is laid in the unalterable constitution of things,--None can aspire\r\nto act greatly but those who are of force greatly to suffer. They who\r\nmake their arrangements in the first run of misadventure, and in a\r\ntemper of mind the common fruit of disappointment and dismay, put a seal\r\non their calamities. To their power they take a security against any\r\nfavors which they might hope from the usual inconstancy of fortune. I am\r\ntherefore, my dear friend, invariably of your opinion, (though full of\r\nrespect for those who think differently,) that neither the time chosen\r\nfor it, nor the manner of soliciting a negotiation, were properly\r\nconsidered,--even though I had allowed (I hardly shall allow) that with\r\nthe horde of Regicides we could by any selection of time or use of means\r\nobtain anything at all deserving the name of peace.\r\n\r\nIn one point we are lucky. The Regicide has received our advances with\r\nscorn. We have an enemy to whose virtues we can owe nothing, but on this\r\noccasion we are infinitely obliged to one of his vices. We owe more to\r\nhis insolence than to our own precaution. The haughtiness by which the\r\nproud repel us has this of good in it,--that, in making us keep our\r\ndistance, they must keep their distance too. In the present case, the\r\npride of the Regicide may be our safety. He has given time for our\r\nreason to operate, and for British dignity to recover from its surprise.\r\nFrom first to last he has rejected all our advances. Far as we have\r\ngone, he has still left a way open to our retreat.\r\n\r\nThere is always an augury to be taken of what a peace is likely to be\r\nfrom the preliminary steps that are made to bring it about. We may\r\ngather something from the time in which the first overtures are made,\r\nfrom the quarter whence they come, from the manner in which they are\r\nreceived. These discover the temper of the parties. If your enemy\r\noffers peace in the moment of success, it indicates that he is satisfied\r\nwith something. It shows that there are limits to his ambition or his\r\nresentment. If he offers nothing under misfortune, it is probable that\r\nit is more painful to him to abandon the prospect of advantage than to\r\nendure calamity. If he rejects solicitation, and will not give even a\r\nnod to the suppliants for peace, until a change in the fortune of the\r\nwar threatens him with ruin, then I think it evident that he wishes\r\nnothing more than to disarm his adversary to gain time. Afterwards a\r\nquestion arises, Which of the parties is likely to obtain the greater\r\nadvantages by continuing disarmed and by the use of time?\r\n\r\nWith these few plain indications in our minds, it will not be improper\r\nto reconsider the conduct of the enemy together with our own, from the\r\nday that a question of peace has been in agitation. In considering this\r\npart of the question, I do not proceed on my own hypothesis. I suppose,\r\nfor a moment, that this body of Regicide, calling itself a Republic, is\r\na politic person, with whom something deserving the name of peace may be\r\nmade. On that supposition, let us examine our own proceeding. Let us\r\ncompute the profit it has brought, and the advantage that it is likely\r\nto bring hereafter. A peace too eagerly sought is not always the sooner\r\nobtained. The discovery of vehement wishes generally frustrates their\r\nattainment, and your adversary has gained a great advantage over you\r\nwhen he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty. There is in reserve\r\nnot only something of dignity, but a great deal of prudence too. A sort\r\nof courage belongs to negotiation, as well as to operations of the\r\nfield. A negotiator must often seem willing to hazard the whole issue\r\nof his treaty, if he wishes to secure any one material point.\r\n\r\nThe Regicides were the first to declare war. We are the first to sue for\r\npeace. In proportion to the humility and perseverance we have shown in\r\nour addresses has been the obstinacy of their arrogance in rejecting our\r\nsuit. The patience of their pride seems to have been worn out with the\r\nimportunity of our courtship. Disgusted as they are with a conduct so\r\ndifferent from all the sentiments by which they are themselves filled,\r\nthey think to put an end to our vexatious solicitation by redoubling\r\ntheir insults.\r\n\r\nIt happens frequently that pride may reject a public advance, while\r\ninterest listens to a secret suggestion of advantage. The opportunity\r\nhas been afforded. At a very early period in the diplomacy of\r\nhumiliation, a gentleman was sent on an errand,[23] of which, from the\r\nmotive of it, whatever the event might be, we can never be ashamed.\r\nHumanity cannot be degraded by humiliation. It is its very character to\r\nsubmit to such things. There is a consanguinity between benevolence and\r\nhumility. They are virtues of the same stock. Dignity is of as good a\r\nrace; but it belongs to the family of fortitude. In the spirit of that\r\nbenevolence, we sent a gentleman to beseech the Directory of Regicide\r\nnot to be quite so prodigal as their republic had been of judicial\r\nmurder. We solicited them to spare the lives of some unhappy persons of\r\nthe first distinction, whose safety at other times could not have been\r\nan object of solicitation. They had quitted France on the faith of the\r\ndeclaration of the rights of citizens. They never had been in the\r\nservice of the Regicides, nor at their hands had received any stipend.\r\nThe very system and constitution of government that now prevails was\r\nsettled subsequent to their emigration. They were under the protection\r\nof Great Britain, and in his Majesty's pay and service. Not an hostile\r\ninvasion, but the disasters of the sea, had thrown them upon a shore\r\nmore barbarous and inhospitable than the inclement ocean under the most\r\npitiless of its storms. Here was an opportunity to express a feeling for\r\nthe miseries of war, and to open some sort of conversation, which,\r\n(after our public overtures had glutted their pride,) at a cautious and\r\njealous distance, might lead to something like an accommodation.--What\r\nwas the event? A strange, uncouth thing, a theatrical figure of the\r\nopera, his head shaded with three-colored plumes, his body fantastically\r\nhabited, strutted from the back scenes, and, after a short speech, in\r\nthe mock-heroic falsetto of stupid tragedy, delivered the gentleman who\r\ncame to make the representation into the custody of a guard, with\r\ndirections not to lose sight of him for a moment, and then ordered him\r\nto be sent from Paris in two hours.\r\n\r\nHere it is impossible that a sentiment of tenderness should not strike\r\nathwart the sternness of politics, and make us recall to painful memory\r\nthe difference between this insolent and bloody theatre and the\r\ntemperate, natural majesty of a civilized court, where the afflicted\r\nfamily of Asgill did not in vain solicit the mercy of the highest in\r\nrank and the most compassionate of the compassionate sex.\r\n\r\nIn this intercourse, at least, there was nothing to promise a great deal\r\nof success in our future advances. Whilst the fortune of the field was\r\nwholly with the Regicides, nothing was thought of but to follow where it\r\nled: and it led to everything. Not so much as a talk of treaty. Laws\r\nwere laid down with arrogance. The most moderate politician in their\r\nclan[24] was chosen as the organ, not so much for prescribing limits to\r\ntheir claims as to mark what for the present they are content to leave\r\nto others. They made, not laws, not conventions, not late possession,\r\nbut physical Nature and political convenience the sole foundation of\r\ntheir claims. The Rhine, the Mediterranean, and the ocean were the\r\nbounds which, for the time, they assigned to the Empire of Regicide.\r\nWhat was the Chamber of Union of Louis the Fourteenth, which astonished\r\nand provoked all Europe, compared to this declaration? In truth, with\r\nthese limits, and their principle, they would not have left even the\r\nshadow of liberty or safety to any nation. This plan of empire was not\r\ntaken up in the first intoxication of unexpected success. You must\r\nrecollect that it was projected, just as the report has stated it, from\r\nthe very first revolt of the faction against their monarchy; and it has\r\nbeen uniformly pursued, as a standing maxim of national policy, from\r\nthat time to this. It is generally in the season of prosperity that men\r\ndiscover their real temper, principles, and designs. But this principle,\r\nsuggested in their first struggles, fully avowed in their prosperity,\r\nhas, in the most adverse state of their affairs, been tenaciously\r\nadhered to. The report, combined with their conduct, forms an infallible\r\ncriterion of the views of this republic.\r\n\r\nIn their fortune there has been some fluctuation. We are to see how\r\ntheir minds have been affected with a change. Some impression it made on\r\nthem, undoubtedly. It produced some oblique notice of the submissions\r\nthat were made by suppliant nations. The utmost they did was to make\r\nsome of those cold, formal, general professions of a love of peace which\r\nno power has ever refused to make, because they mean little and cost\r\nnothing. The first paper I have seen (the publication at Hamburg) making\r\na show of that pacific disposition discovered a rooted animosity against\r\nthis nation, and an incurable rancor, even more than any one of their\r\nhostile acts. In this Hamburg declaration they choose to suppose that\r\nthe war, on the part of England, _is a war of government, begun and\r\ncarried on against the sense and interests of the people_,--thus sowing\r\nin their very overtures towards peace the seeds of tumult and sedition:\r\nfor they never have abandoned, and never will they abandon, in peace, in\r\nwar, in treaty, in any situation, or for one instant, their old, steady\r\nmaxim of separating the people from their government. Let me add, (and\r\nit is with unfeigned anxiety for the character and credit of ministers\r\nthat I do add,) if our government perseveres in its as uniform course of\r\nacting under instruments with such preambles, it pleads guilty to the\r\ncharges made by our enemies against it, both on its own part and on the\r\npart of Parliament itself. The enemy must succeed in his plan for\r\nloosening and disconnecting all the internal holdings of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough that the speech from the throne, in the opening of the\r\nsession in 1795, threw out oglings and glances of tenderness. Lest this\r\ncoquetting should seem too cold and ambiguous, without waiting for its\r\neffect, the violent passion for a relation to the Regicides produced a\r\ndirect message from the crown, and its consequences from the two Houses\r\nof Parliament. On the part of the Regicides these declarations could not\r\nbe entirely passed by without notice; but in that notice they discovered\r\nstill more clearly the bottom of their character. The offer made to them\r\nby the message to Parliament was hinted at in their answer,--but in an\r\nobscure and oblique manner, as before. They accompanied their notice of\r\nthe indications manifested on our side with every kind of insolent and\r\ntaunting reflection. The Regicide Directory, on the day which, in their\r\ngypsy jargon, they call the 5th of _Pluviose_, in return for our\r\nadvances, charge us with eluding our declarations under \"evasive\r\nformalities and frivolous pretexts.\" What these pretexts and evasions\r\nwere they do not say, and I have never heard. But they do not rest\r\nthere. They proceed to charge us, and, as it should seem, our allies in\r\nthe mass, with direct _perfidy_; they are so conciliatory in their\r\nlanguage as to hint that this perfidious character is not new in our\r\nproceedings. However, notwithstanding this our habitual perfidy, they\r\nwill offer peace \"on conditions _as_ moderate\"--as what? as reason and\r\nas equity require? No,--as moderate \"as are suitable to their _national\r\ndignity_.\" National dignity in all treaties I do admit is an important\r\nconsideration: they have given us an useful hint on that subject: but\r\ndignity hitherto has belonged to the mode of proceeding, not to the\r\nmatter of a treaty. Never before has it been mentioned as the standard\r\nfor rating the conditions of peace,--no, never by the most violent of\r\nconquerors. Indemnification is capable of some estimate; dignity has no\r\nstandard. It is impossible to guess what acquisitions pride and ambition\r\nmay think fit for their _dignity_. But lest any doubt should remain on\r\nwhat they think for their dignity, the Regicides in the next paragraph\r\ntell us \"that they will have no peace with their enemies, until they\r\nhave reduced them to a state which will put them under an\r\n_impossibility_ of pursuing their wretched projects,\"--that is, in plain\r\nFrench or English, until they have accomplished our utter and\r\nirretrievable ruin. This is their _pacific_ language. It flows from\r\ntheir unalterable principle, in whatever language they speak or whatever\r\nsteps they take, whether of real war or of pretended pacification. They\r\nhave never, to do them justice, been at much trouble in concealing their\r\nintentions. We were as obstinately resolved to think them not in\r\nearnest: but I confess, jests of this sort, whatever their urbanity may\r\nbe, are not much to my taste.\r\n\r\nTo this conciliatory and amicable public communication our sole answer,\r\nin effect, is this:--\"Citizen Regicides! whenever _you_ find yourselves\r\nin the humor, you may have a peace with _us_. That is a point you may\r\nalways command. We are constantly in attendance, and nothing you can do\r\nshall hinder us from the renewal of our supplications. You may turn us\r\nout at the door, but we will jump in at the window.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who do not love to contemplate the fall of human greatness, I\r\ndo not know a more mortifying spectacle than to see the assembled\r\nmajesty of the crowned heads of Europe waiting as patient suitors in the\r\nantechamber of Regicide. They wait, it seems, until the sanguinary\r\ntyrant Carnot shall have snorted away the fumes of the indigested blood\r\nof his sovereign. Then, when, sunk on the down of usurped pomp, he shall\r\nhave sufficiently indulged his meditations with what monarch he shall\r\nnext glut his ravening maw, he may condescend to signify that it is his\r\npleasure to be awake, and that he is at leisure to receive the proposals\r\nof his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may respite the\r\nexecution of the sentence he has passed upon them. At the opening of\r\nthose doors, what a sight it must be to behold the plenipotentiaries of\r\nroyal impotence, in the precedency which they will intrigue to obtain,\r\nand which will be granted to them according to the seniority of their\r\ndegradation, sneaking into the Regicide presence, and, with the relics\r\nof the smile which they had dressed up for the levee of their masters\r\nstill flickering on their curled lips, presenting the faded remains of\r\ntheir courtly graces, to meet the scornful, ferocious, sardonic grin of\r\na bloody ruffian, who, whilst he is receiving their homage, is measuring\r\nthem with his eye, and fitting to their size the slider of his\r\nguillotine! These ambassadors may easily return as good courtiers as\r\nthey went; but can they ever return from that degrading residence loyal\r\nand faithful subjects, or with any true affection to their master, or\r\ntrue attachment to the constitution, religion, or laws of their country?\r\nThere is great danger that they, who enter smiling into this Trophonian\r\ncave, will come out of it sad and serious conspirators, and such will\r\ncontinue as long as they live. They will become true conductors of\r\ncontagion to every country which has had the misfortune to send them to\r\nthe source of that electricity. At best, they will become totally\r\nindifferent to good and evil, to one institution or another. This\r\nspecies of indifference is but too generally distinguishable in those\r\nwho have been much employed in foreign courts, but in the present case\r\nthe evil must be aggravated without measure: for they go from their\r\ncountry, not with the pride of the old character, but in a state of the\r\nlowest degradation; and what must happen in their place of residence can\r\nhave no effect in raising them to the level of true dignity or of chaste\r\nself-estimation, either as men or as representatives of crowned heads.\r\n\r\nOur early proceeding, which has produced these returns of affront,\r\nappeared to me totally new, without being adapted to the new\r\ncircumstances of affairs. I have called to my mind the speeches and\r\nmessages in former times. I find nothing like these. You will look in\r\nthe journals to find whether my memory fails me. Before this time, never\r\nwas a ground of peace laid, (as it were, in a Parliamentary record,)\r\nuntil it had been as good as concluded. This was a wise homage paid to\r\nthe discretion of the crown. It was known how much a negotiation must\r\nsuffer by having anything in the train towards it prematurely disclosed.\r\nBut when those Parliamentary declarations were made, not so much as a\r\nstep had been taken towards a negotiation in any mode whatever. The\r\nmeasure was an unpleasant and unseasonable discovery.\r\n\r\nI conceive that another circumstance in that transaction has been as\r\nlittle authorized by any example, and that it is as little prudent in\r\nitself: I mean the formal recognition of the French Republic. Without\r\nentering, for the present, into a question on the good faith manifested\r\nin that measure, or on its general policy, I doubt, upon mere temporary\r\nconsiderations of prudence, whether it was perfectly advisable. It is\r\nnot within, the rules of dexterous conduct to make an acknowledgment of\r\na contested title in your enemy before you are morally certain that your\r\nrecognition will secure his friendship. Otherwise it is a measure worse\r\nthan thrown away. It adds infinitely to the strength, and consequently\r\nto the demands, of the adverse party. He has gained a fundamental point\r\nwithout an equivalent. It has happened as might have been foreseen. No\r\nnotice whatever was taken of this recognition. In fact, the Directory\r\nnever gave themselves any concern about it; and they received our\r\nacknowledgment with perfect scorn. With them it is not for the states of\r\nEurope to judge of their title: the very reverse. In their eye the title\r\nof every other power depends wholly on their pleasure.\r\n\r\nPreliminary declarations of this sort, thrown out at random, and sown,\r\nas it wore, broadcast, were never to be found in the mode of our\r\nproceeding with France and Spain, whilst the great monarchies of France\r\nand Spain existed. I do not say that a diplomatic measure ought to be,\r\nlike a parliamentary or a judicial proceeding, according to strict\r\nprecedent: I hope I am far from that pedantry. But this I know: that a\r\ngreat state ought to have some regard to its ancient maxims, especially\r\nwhere they indicate its dignity, where they concur with the rules of\r\nprudence, and, above all, where the circumstances of the time require\r\nthat a spirit of innovation should be resisted which leads to the\r\nhumiliation of sovereign powers. It would be ridiculous to assert that\r\nthose powers have suffered nothing in their estimation. I admit that\r\nthe greater interests of state will for a moment supersede all other\r\nconsiderations; but if there was a rule, that a sovereign never should\r\nlet down his dignity without a sure payment to his interest, the dignity\r\nof kings would be held high enough. At present, however, fashion governs\r\nin more serious things than furniture and dress. It looks as if\r\nsovereigns abroad were emulous in bidding against their estimation. It\r\nseems as if the preëminence of regicide was acknowledged,--and that\r\nkings tacitly ranked themselves below their sacrilegious murderers, as\r\nnatural magistrates and judges over them. It appears as if dignity were\r\nthe prerogative of crime, and a temporizing humiliation the proper part\r\nfor venerable authority. If the vilest of mankind are resolved to be the\r\nmost wicked, they lose all the baseness of their origin, and take their\r\nplace above kings. This example in foreign princes I trust will not\r\nspread. It is the concern of mankind, that the destruction of order\r\nshould not, be a claim to rank, that crimes should not be the only title\r\nto preëminence and honor.\r\n\r\nAt this second stage of humiliation, (I mean the insulting declaration\r\nin consequence of the message to both Houses of Parliament,) it might\r\nnot have been amiss to pause, and not to squander away the fund of our\r\nsubmissions, until we knew what final purposes of public interest they\r\nmight answer. The policy of subjecting ourselves to further insults is\r\nnot to me quite apparent. It was resolved, however, to hazard a third\r\ntrial. Citizen Barthélemy had been established, on the part of the new\r\nrepublic, at Basle,--where, with his proconsulate of Switzerland and the\r\nadjacent parts of Germany, he was appointed as a sort of factor to deal\r\nin the degradation of the crowned heads of Europe. At Basle it was\r\nthought proper, in order to keep others, I suppose, in countenance, that\r\nGreat Britain should appear at this market, and bid with the rest for\r\nthe mercy of the People-King.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of March, 1796, Mr. Wickham, in consequence of authority, was\r\ndesired to sound France on her disposition towards a general\r\npacification,--to know whether she would consent to send ministers to a\r\ncongress at such a place as might be hereafter agreed upon,--whether\r\nthere would be a disposition to communicate the general grounds of a\r\npacification, such as France (the diplomatic name of the Regicide power)\r\nwould be willing to propose, as a foundation for a negotiation for peace\r\nwith his Majesty _and his allies_, or to suggest any other way of\r\narriving at the same end of a general pacification: but he had no\r\nauthority to enter into any negotiation or discussion with Citizen\r\nBarthélemy upon these subjects.\r\n\r\nOn the part of Great Britain this measure was a voluntary act, wholly\r\nuncalled for on the part of Regicide. Suits of this sort are at least\r\nstrong indications of a desire for accommodation. Any other body of men\r\nbut the Directory would be somewhat soothed with such advances. They\r\ncould not, however, begin their answer, which was given without much\r\ndelay, and communicated on the 28th of the same month, without a\r\npreamble of insult and reproach. \"They doubt the sincerity of the\r\npacific intentions of this court.\" She did not begin, say they, yet to\r\n\"know her real interests.\" \"She did not seek peace _with good faith_.\"\r\nThis, or something to this effect, has been the constant preliminary\r\nobservation (now grown into a sort of office form) on all our overtures\r\nto this power: a perpetual charge on the British government of fraud,\r\nevasion, and habitual perfidy.\r\n\r\nIt might be asked, From whence did these opinions of our insincerity and\r\nill faith arise? It was because the British ministry (leaving to the\r\nDirectory, however, to propose a better mode) proposed a _congress_ for\r\nthe purpose of a general pacification, and this they said \"would render\r\nnegotiation endless.\" From hence they immediately inferred a fraudulent\r\nintention in the offer. Unquestionably their mode of giving the law\r\nwould bring matters to a more speedy conclusion. As to any other method\r\nmore agreeable to them than a congress, an alternative expressly\r\nproposed to them, they did not condescend to signify their pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis refusal of treating conjointly with the powers allied against this\r\nrepublic furnishes matter for a great deal of serious reflection. They\r\nhave hitherto constantly declined any other than a treaty with a single\r\npower. By thus dissociating every state from every other, like deer\r\nseparated from the herd, each power is treated with on the merit of his\r\nbeing a deserter from the common cause. In that light, the Regicide\r\npower, finding each of them insulated and unprotected, with great\r\nfacility gives the law to them all. By this system, for the present an\r\nincurable distrust is sown amongst confederates, and in future all\r\nalliance is rendered impracticable. It is thus they have treated with\r\nPrussia, with Spain, with Sardinia, with Bavaria, with the\r\nEcclesiastical State, with Saxony; and here we see them refuse to treat\r\nwith Great Britain in any other mode. They must be worse than blind who\r\ndo not see with what undeviating regularity of system, in this case and\r\nin all cases, they pursue their scheme for the utter destruction of\r\nevery independent power,--especially the smaller, who cannot find any\r\nrefuge whatever but in some common cause.\r\n\r\nRenewing their taunts and reflections, they tell Mr. Wickham, \"that\r\n_their_ policy has no guides but openness and good faith, and that their\r\nconduct shall be conformable to these principles.\" They say concerning\r\ntheir government, that, \"yielding to the ardent desire by which it is\r\nanimated to procure peace for the French Republic and for all nations,\r\nit will not _fear to declare itself openly_. Charged by the Constitution\r\nwith the execution of the _laws_, it cannot _make_ or _listen_ to any\r\nproposal that would be contrary to them. The constitutional act does not\r\npermit it to consent to any alienation of that which, according to the\r\nexisting laws, constitutes the territory of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the countries _occupied by the French armies, and which\r\nhave not been united to France_, they, as well as other interests,\r\npolitical and commercial, may become the subject of a negotiation, which\r\nwill present to the Directory the means of proving how much it desires\r\nto attain speedily to a happy pacification.\" That \"the Directory is\r\nready to receive, in this respect, any overtures that shall be just,\r\nreasonable, and compatible _with the dignity of the Republic_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the head of what is _not_ to be the subject of negotiation, the\r\nDirectory is clear and open. As to what may be a matter of treaty, all\r\nthis open dealing is gone. She retires into her shell. There she expects\r\novertures from _you_: and you are to guess what she shall judge just,\r\nreasonable, and, above all, _compatible with her dignity_.\r\n\r\nIn the records of pride there does not exist so insulting a declaration.\r\nIt is insolent in words, in manner; but in substance it is not only\r\ninsulting, but alarming. It is a specimen of what may be expected from\r\nthe masters we are preparing for our humbled country. Their openness and\r\ncandor consist in a direct avowal of their despotism and ambition. We\r\nknow that their declared resolution had been to surrender no object\r\nbelonging to France previous to the war. They had resolved that the\r\nRepublic was entire, and must remain so. As to what she has conquered\r\nfrom the Allies and united to the same indivisible body, it is of the\r\nsame nature. That is, the Allies are to give up whatever conquests they\r\nhave made or may make upon France; but all which she has violently\r\nravished from her neighbors, and thought fit to appropriate, are not to\r\nbecome so much as objects of negotiation.\r\n\r\nIn this unity and indivisibility of possession are sunk ten immense and\r\nwealthy provinces, full of strong, flourishing, and opulent cities, (the\r\nAustrian Netherlands,) the part of Europe the most necessary to preserve\r\nany communication between this kingdom and its natural allies, next to\r\nHolland the most interesting to this country, and without which Holland\r\nmust virtually belong to France. Savoy and Nice, the keys of Italy, and\r\nthe citadel in her hands to bridle Switzerland, are in that\r\nconsolidation. The important territory of Liege is torn out of the heart\r\nof the Empire. All these are integrant parts of the Republic, not to be\r\nsubject to any discussion, or to be purchased by any equivalent. Why?\r\nBecause there is a law which prevents it. What law? The law of nations?\r\nThe acknowledged public law of Europe? Treaties and conventions of\r\nparties? No,--not a pretence of the kind. It is a declaration not made\r\nin consequence of any prescription on her side,--not on any cession or\r\ndereliction, actual or tacit, of other powers. It is a declaration,\r\n_pendente lite_, in the middle of a war, one principal object of which\r\nwas originally the defence, and has since been the recovery, of these\r\nvery countries.\r\n\r\nThis strange law is not made for a trivial object, not for a single port\r\nor for a single fortress, but for a great kingdom,--for the religion,\r\nthe morals, the laws, the liberties, the lives and fortunes of millions\r\nof human creatures, who, without their consent or that of their lawful\r\ngovernment, are, by an arbitrary act of this regicide and homicide\r\ngovernment which they call a law, incorporated into their tyranny.\r\n\r\nIn other words, their will is the law, not only at home, but as to the\r\nconcerns of every nation. Who has made that law but the Regicide\r\nRepublic itself, whose laws, like those of the Medes and Persians, they\r\ncannot alter or abrogate, or even so much as take into consideration?\r\nWithout the least ceremony or compliment, they have sent out of the\r\nworld whole sets of laws and lawgivers. They have swept away the very\r\nconstitutions under which the legislatures acted and the laws were made.\r\nEven the fundamental sacred rights of man they have not scrupled to\r\nprofane. They have set this holy code at nought with ignominy and scorn.\r\nThus they treat all their domestic laws and constitutions, and even what\r\nthey had considered as a law of Nature. But whatever they have put their\r\nseal on, for the purposes of their ambition, and the ruin of their\r\nneighbors, this alone is invulnerable, impassible, immortal. Assuming to\r\nbe masters of everything human and divine, here, and here alone, it\r\nseems, they are limited, \"cooped and cabined in,\" and this omnipotent\r\nlegislature finds itself wholly without the power of exercising its\r\nfavorite attribute, the love of peace. In other words, they are powerful\r\nto usurp, impotent to restore; and equally by their power and their\r\nimpotence they aggrandize themselves, and weaken and impoverish you and\r\nall other nations.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more proper or more manly than the state publication,\r\ncalled a _Note_, on this proceeding, dated Downing Street, the 10th of\r\nApril, 1796. Only that it is better expressed, it perfectly agrees with\r\nthe opinion I have taken the liberty of submitting to your\r\nconsideration. I place it below at full length,[25] as my justification\r\nin thinking that this astonishing paper from the Directory is not only a\r\ndirect negative to all treaty, but is a rejection of every principle\r\nupon which treaties could be made. To admit it for a moment were to\r\nerect this power, usurped at home, into a legislature to govern mankind.\r\nIt is an authority that on a thousand occasions they have asserted in\r\nclaim, and, whenever they are able, exerted in practice. The\r\ndereliction, of this whole scheme of policy became, therefore, an\r\nindispensable previous condition to all renewal of treaty. The remark of\r\nthe British Cabinet on this arrogant and tyrannical claim is natural and\r\nunavoidable. Our ministry state, that, \"_while these dispositions shall\r\nbe persisted in, nothing is left for the king but to prosecute a war\r\nthat is just and necessary_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was of course that we should wait until the enemy showed some sort of\r\ndisposition on his part to fulfil this condition. It was hoped, indeed,\r\nthat our suppliant strains might be suffered to steal into the august\r\near in a more propitious season. That season, however, invoked by so\r\nmany vows, conjurations, and prayers, did not come. Every declaration of\r\nhostility renovated, and every act pursued with double animosity,--the\r\noverrunning of Lombardy,--the subjugation of Piedmont,--the possession\r\nof its impregnable fortresses,--the seizing on all the neutral states of\r\nItaly,--our expulsion from Leghorn,--instances forever renewed for our\r\nexpulsion from Genoa,--Spain rendered subject to them and hostile to\r\nus,--Portugal bent under the yoke,--half the Empire overrun and\r\nravaged,--were the only signs which this mild Republic thought proper to\r\nmanifest of her pacific sentiments. Every demonstration of an implacable\r\nrancor and an untamable pride were the only encouragements we received\r\nto the renewal of our supplications.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, they and we were fixed. Nothing was left to the British\r\nministry but \"to prosecute a war just and necessary,\"--a war equally\r\njust as at the time of our engaging in it,--a war become ten times more\r\nnecessary by everything which happened afterwards. This resolution was\r\nsoon, however, forgot. It felt the heat of the season and melted away.\r\nNew hopes were entertained from supplication. No expectations, indeed,\r\nwere then formed from renewing a direct application to the French\r\nRegicides through the agent-general for the humiliation of sovereigns.\r\nAt length a step was taken in degradation which even went lower than all\r\nthe rest. Deficient in merits of our own, a mediator was to be\r\nsought,--and we looked for that mediator at Berlin! The King of\r\nPrussia's merits in abandoning the general cause might have obtained for\r\nhim some sort of influence in favor of those whom he had deserted; but I\r\nhave never heard that his Prussian Majesty had lately discovered so\r\nmarked an affection for the Court of St. James's, or for the Court of\r\nVienna, as to excite much hope of his interposing a very powerful\r\nmediation to deliver them from the distresses into which he had brought\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf humiliation is the element in which we live, if it is become not only\r\nour occasional policy, but our habit, no great objection can be made to\r\nthe modes in which it may be diversified,--though I confess I cannot be\r\ncharmed with the idea of our exposing our lazar sores at the door of\r\nevery proud servitor of the French Republic, where the court dogs will\r\nnot deign to lick them. We had, if I am not mistaken, a minister at that\r\ncourt, who might try its temper, and recede and advance as he found\r\nbackwardness or encouragement. But to send a gentleman there on no other\r\nerrand than this, and with no assurance whatever that he should not\r\nfind, what he did find, a repulse, seems to me to go far beyond all the\r\ndemands of a humiliation merely politic. I hope it did not arise from a\r\npredilection for that mode of conduct.\r\n\r\nThe cup of bitterness was not, however, drained to the dregs. Basle and\r\nBerlin were not sufficient. After so many and so diversified repulses,\r\nwe were resolved to make another experiment, and to try another\r\nmediator. Among the unhappy gentlemen in whose persons royalty is\r\ninsulted and degraded at the seat of plebeian pride and upstart\r\ninsolence, there is a minister from Denmark at Paris. Without any\r\nprevious encouragement to that, any more than the other steps, we sent\r\nthrough, this turnpike to demand a passport for a person who on our part\r\nwas to solicit peace in the metropolis, at the footstool of Regicide\r\nitself. It was not to be expected that any one of those degraded beings\r\ncould have influence enough to settle any part of the terms in favor of\r\nthe candidates for further degradation; besides, such intervention would\r\nbe a direct breach in their system, which did not permit one sovereign\r\npower to utter a word in the concerns of his equal.--Another repulse. We\r\nwere desired to apply directly in our persons. We submitted, and made\r\nthe application.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that here, at length, we had touched the bottom of\r\nhumiliation; our lead was brought up covered with mud. But \"in the\r\nlowest deep, a lower deep\" was to open for us still more profound\r\nabysses of disgrace and shame. However, in we leaped. We came forward in\r\nour own name. The passport, such a passport and safe-conduct as would be\r\ngranted to thieves who might come in to betray their accomplices, and no\r\nbetter, was granted to British supplication. To leave no doubt of its\r\nspirit, as soon as the rumor of this act of condescension could get\r\nabroad, it was formally announced with an explanation from authority,\r\ncontaining an invective against the ministry of Great Britain, their\r\nhabitual frauds, their proverbial _Punic_ perfidy. No such state-paper,\r\nas a preliminary to a negotiation for peace, has ever yet appeared. Very\r\nfew declarations of war have ever shown so much and so unqualified\r\nanimosity. I place it below,[26] as a diplomatic curiosity, and in\r\norder to be the better understood in the few remarks I have to make upon\r\na peace which, indeed, defies all description. \"None but itself can be\r\nits parallel.\"\r\n\r\nI pass by all the insolence and contumely of the performance, as it\r\ncomes from them. The present question is not, how we are to be affected\r\nwith it in regard to our dignity. That is gone. I shall say no more\r\nabout it. Light lie the earth on the ashes of English pride! I shall\r\nonly observe upon it _politically_, and as furnishing a direction for\r\nour own conduct in this low business.\r\n\r\nThe very idea of a negotiation for peace, whatever the inward sentiments\r\nof the parties may be, implies some confidence in their faith, some\r\ndegree of belief in the professions which are made concerning it. A\r\ntemporary and occasional credit, at least, is granted. Otherwise men\r\nstumble on the very threshold. I therefore wish to ask what hope we can\r\nhave of their good faith, who, as the very basis of the negotiation,\r\nassume the ill faith and treachery of those they have to deal with? The\r\nterms, as against us, must be such as imply a full security against a\r\ntreacherous conduct,--that is, such terms as this Directory stated in\r\nits first declaration, to place us \"in an utter impossibility of\r\nexecuting our wretched projects.\" This is the omen, and the sole omen,\r\nunder which we have consented to open our treaty.\r\n\r\nThe second observation I have to make upon it (much connected,\r\nundoubtedly, with the first) is, that they have informed you of the\r\nresult they propose from the kind of peace they mean to grant you,\r\n--that is to say, the union they propose among nations with the view of\r\nrivalling our trade and destroying our naval power; and this they\r\nsuppose (and with good reason, too) must be the inevitable effect of\r\ntheir peace. It forms one of their principal grounds for suspecting our\r\nministers could not be in good earnest in their proposition. They make\r\nno scruple beforehand to tell you the whole of what they intend; and\r\nthis is what we call, in the modern style, the acceptance of a\r\nproposition for peace! In old language it would be called a most\r\nhaughty, offensive, and insolent rejection of all treaty.\r\n\r\nThirdly, they tell you what they conceive to be the perfidious policy\r\nwhich dictates your delusive offer: that is, the design of cheating not\r\nonly them, but the people of England, against whose interest and\r\ninclination this war is supposed to be carried on.\r\n\r\nIf we proceed in this business, under this preliminary declaration, it\r\nseems to me that we admit, (now for the third time,) by something a\r\ngreat deal stronger than words, the truth of the charges of every kind\r\nwhich they make upon the British ministry, and the grounds of those foul\r\nimputations. The language used by us, which in other circumstances would\r\nnot be exceptionable, in this case tends very strongly to confirm and\r\nrealize the suspicion of our enemy: I mean the declaration, that, if we\r\ndo not obtain such terms of peace as suits our opinion of what our\r\ninterests require, _then_, and in _that_ case, we shall continue the war\r\nwith vigor. This offer, so reasoned, plainly implies, that, without it,\r\nour leaders themselves entertain great doubts of the opinion and good\r\naffections of the British people; otherwise there does not appear any\r\ncause why we should proceed, under the scandalous construction of our\r\nenemy, upon the former offer made by Mr. Wickham, and on the new offer\r\nmade directly at Paris. It is not, therefore, from a sense of dignity,\r\nbut from the danger of radicating that false sentiment in the breasts of\r\nthe enemy, that I think, under the auspices of this declaration, we\r\ncannot, with the least hope of a good event, or, indeed, with any\r\nregard to the common safety, proceed in the train of this negotiation.\r\nI wish ministry would seriously consider the importance of their seeming\r\nto confirm the enemy in an opinion that his frequent use of appeals to\r\nthe people against their government has not been without its effect. If\r\nit puts an end to this war, it will render another impracticable.\r\n\r\nWhoever goes to the Directorial presence under this passport, with this\r\noffensive comment and foul explanation, goes, in the avowed sense of the\r\ncourt to which he is sent, as the instrument of a government dissociated\r\nfrom the interests and wishes of the nation, for the purpose of cheating\r\nboth the people of France and the people of England. He goes out the\r\ndeclared emissary of a faithless ministry. He has perfidy for his\r\ncredentials. He has national weakness for his full powers. I yet doubt\r\nwhether any one can be found to invest himself with that character. If\r\nthere should, it would be pleasant to read his instructions on the\r\nanswer which he is to give to the Directory, in case they should repeat\r\nto him the substance of the manifesto which he carries with him in his\r\nportfolio.\r\n\r\nSo much for the _first_ manifesto of the Regicide Court which went along\r\nwith the passport. Lest this declaration should seem the effect of\r\nhaste, or a mere sudden effusion of pride and insolence, on full\r\ndeliberation, about a week after comes out a second. This manifesto is\r\ndated the 5th of October, one day before the speech from the throne, on\r\nthe vigil of the festive day of cordial unanimity so happily celebrated\r\nby all parties in the British Parliament. In this piece the Regicides,\r\nour worthy friends, (I call them by advance and by courtesy what by law\r\nI shall be obliged to call them hereafter,) our worthy friends, I say,\r\nrenew and enforce the former declaration concerning our faith and\r\nsincerity, which they pinned to our passport. On three other points,\r\nwhich run through all their declarations, they are more explicit than\r\never.\r\n\r\nFirst, they more directly undertake to be the real representatives of\r\nthe people of this kingdom: and on a supposition, in which they agree\r\nwith our Parliamentary reformers, that the House of Commons is not that\r\nrepresentative, the function being vacant, they, as our true\r\nconstitutional organ, inform his Majesty and the world of the sense of\r\nthe nation. They tell us that \"the English people see with regret his\r\nMajesty's government squandering away the funds which had been granted\r\nto him.\" This astonishing assumption of the public voice of England is\r\nbut a slight foretaste of the usurpation which, on a peace, we may be\r\nassured they will make of all the powers in all the parts of our vassal\r\nConstitution. \"If they do these things in the green tree, what shall be\r\ndone in the dry?\"\r\n\r\nNext they tell us, as a condition to our treaty, that \"this government\r\nmust abjure the unjust hatred it bears to them, and at last open its\r\nears to the voice of humanity.\" Truly, this is, even from them, an\r\nextraordinary demand. Hitherto, it seems, we have put wax into our ears,\r\nto shut them up against the tender, soothing strains, in the\r\n_affettuoso_ of humanity, warbled from the throats of Reubell, Carnot,\r\nTallien, and the whole chorus of confiscators, domiciliary visitors,\r\ncommittee-men of research, jurors and presidents of revolutionary\r\ntribunals, regicides, assassins, massacrers, and Septembrisers. It is\r\nnot difficult to discern what sort of humanity our government is to\r\nlearn from these Siren singers. Our government also; I admit, with some\r\nreason, as a step towards the proposed fraternity, is required to abjure\r\nthe unjust hatred which it bears to this body of honor and virtue. I\r\nthank God I am neither a minister nor a leader of opposition. I protest\r\nI cannot do what they desire. I could not do it, if I were under the\r\nguillotine,--or, as they ingeniously and pleasantly express it, \"looking\r\nout of the little national window.\" Even at that opening I could receive\r\nnone of their light. I am fortified against all such affections by the\r\ndeclaration of the government, which I must yet consider as lawful, made\r\non the 29th of October, 1793,[27] and still ringing in my ears. This\r\nDeclaration was transmitted not only to all our commanders by sea and\r\nland, but to our ministers in every court of Europe. It is the most\r\neloquent and highly finished in the style, the most judicious in the\r\nchoice of topics, the most orderly in the arrangement, and the most rich\r\nin the coloring, without employing the smallest degree of exaggeration,\r\nof any state-paper that has ever yet appeared. An ancient writer\r\n(Plutarch, I think it is) quotes some verses on the eloquence of\r\nPericles, who is called \"the only orator that left stings in the minds\r\nof his hearers.\" Like his, the eloquence of the Declaration, not\r\ncontradicting, but enforcing, sentiments of the truest humanity, has\r\nleft stings that have penetrated more than skin-deep into my mind and\r\nnever can they be extracted by all the surgery of murder; never can the\r\nthrobbings they have created be assuaged by all the emollient cataplasms\r\nof robbery and confiscation. I _cannot_ love the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe third point, which they have more clearly expressed than ever, is of\r\nequal importance with the rest, and with them furnishes a complete view\r\nof the Regicide system. For they demand as a condition, without which\r\nour ambassador of obedience cannot be received with any hope of success,\r\nthat he shall be \"provided with full powers to negotiate a peace between\r\nthe French Republic and Great Britain, and to conclude it _definitively_\r\nbetween the TWO powers.\" With their spear they draw a circle about us.\r\nThey will hear nothing of a joint treaty. We must make a peace\r\nseparately from our allies. We must, as the very first and preliminary\r\nstep, be guilty of that perfidy towards our friends and associates with\r\nwhich they reproach us in our transactions with them, our enemies. We\r\nare called upon scandalously to betray the fundamental securities to\r\nourselves and to all nations. In my opinion, (it is perhaps but a poor\r\none,) if we are meanly bold enough to send an ambassador such as this\r\nofficial note of the enemy requires, we cannot even dispatch our\r\nemissary without danger of being charged with a breach of our alliance.\r\nGovernment now understands the full meaning of the passport.\r\n\r\nStrange revolutions have happened in the ways of thinking and in the\r\nfeelings of men; but it is a very extraordinary coalition of parties\r\nindeed, and a kind of unheard-of unanimity in public councils, which can\r\nimpose this new-discovered system of negotiation, as sound national\r\npolicy, on the understanding of a spectator of this wonderful scene, who\r\njudges on the principles of anything he ever before saw, read, or heard\r\nof, and, above all, on the understanding of a person who has in his eye\r\nthe transactions of the last seven years.\r\n\r\nI know it is supposed, that, if good terms of capitulation are not\r\ngranted, after we have thus so repeatedly hung out the white flag, the\r\nnational spirit will revive with tenfold ardor. This is an experiment\r\ncautiously to be made. _Reculer pour mieux sauter_, according to the\r\nFrench byword, cannot be trusted to as a general rule of conduct. To\r\ndiet a man into weakness and languor, afterwards to give him the greater\r\nstrength, has more of the empiric than the rational physician. It is\r\ntrue that some persons have been kicked into courage,--and this is no\r\nbad hint to give to those who are too forward and liberal in bestowing\r\ninsults and outrages on their passive companions; but such a course does\r\nnot at first view appear a well-chosen discipline to form men to a nice\r\nsense of honor or a quick resentment of injuries. A long habit of\r\nhumiliation does not seem a very good preparative to manly and vigorous\r\nsentiment. It may not leave, perhaps, enough of energy in the mind\r\nfairly to discern what are good terms or what are not. Men low and\r\ndispirited may regard those terms as not at all amiss which in another\r\nstate of mind they would think intolerable: if they grow peevish in this\r\nstate of mind, they may be roused, not against the enemy whom they have\r\nbeen taught to fear, but against the ministry,[28] who are more within\r\ntheir reach, and who have refused conditions that are not unreasonable,\r\nfrom power that they have been taught to consider as irresistible.\r\n\r\nIf all that for some months I have heard have the least foundation, (I\r\nhope it has not,) the ministers are, perhaps, not quite so much to be\r\nblamed as their condition is to be lamented. I have been given to\r\nunderstand that these proceedings are not in their origin properly\r\ntheirs. It is said that there is a secret in the House of Commons. It is\r\nsaid that ministers act, not according to the votes, but according to\r\nthe dispositions, of the majority. I hear that the minority has long\r\nsince spoken the general sense of the nation; and that to prevent those\r\nwho compose it from having the open and avowed lead in that House, or\r\nperhaps in both Houses, it was necessary to preoccupy their ground, and\r\nto take their propositions out of their mouths, even with the hazard of\r\nbeing afterwards reproached with a compliance which it was foreseen\r\nwould be fruitless.\r\n\r\nIf the general disposition of the people be, as I hear it is, for an\r\nimmediate peace with Regicide, without so much as considering our public\r\nand solemn engagements to the party in France whose cause we had\r\nespoused, or the engagements expressed in our general alliances, not\r\nonly without an inquiry into the terms, but with a certain knowledge\r\nthat none but the worst terms will be offered, it is all over with us.\r\nIt is strange, but it may be true, that, as the danger from Jacobinism\r\nis increased in my eyes and in yours, the fear of it is lessened in the\r\neyes of many people who formerly regarded it with horror. It seems, they\r\nact under the impression of terrors of another sort, which have\r\nfrightened them out of their first apprehensions. But let their fears,\r\nor their hopes, or their desires, be what they will, they should\r\nrecollect that they who would make peace without a previous knowledge of\r\nthe terms make a surrender. They are conquered. They do not treat; they\r\nreceive the law. Is this the disposition of the people of England? Then\r\nthe people of England are contented to seek in the kindness of a\r\nforeign, systematic enemy, combined with a dangerous faction at home, a\r\nsecurity which they cannot find in their own patriotism and their own\r\ncourage. They are willing to trust to the sympathy of regicides the\r\nguaranty of the British monarchy. They are content to rest their\r\nreligion on the piety of atheists by establishment. They are satisfied\r\nto seek in the clemency of practised murderers the security of their\r\nlives. They are pleased to confide their property to the safeguard of\r\nthose who are robbers by inclination, interest, habit, and system. If\r\nthis be our deliberate mind, truly we deserve to lose, what it is\r\nimpossible we should long retain, the name of a nation.\r\n\r\nIn matters of state, a constitutional competence to act is in many cases\r\nthe smallest part of the question. Without disputing (God forbid I\r\nshould dispute!) the sole competence of the king and the Parliament,\r\neach in its province, to decide on war and peace, I venture to say no\r\nwar _can_ be long carried on against the will of the people. This war,\r\nin particular, cannot be carried on, unless they are enthusiastically in\r\nfavor of it. Acquiescence will not do. There must be zeal. Universal\r\nzeal in such a cause, and at such a time as this is, cannot be looked\r\nfor; neither is it necessary. Zeal in the larger part carries the force\r\nof the whole. Without this, no government, certainly not our\r\ngovernment, is capable of a great war. None of the ancient, regular\r\ngovernments have wherewithal to fight abroad with a foreign foe, and at\r\nhome to overcome repining, reluctance, and chicane. It must be some\r\nportentous thing, like Regicide France, that can exhibit such a prodigy.\r\nYet even she, the mother of monsters, more prolific than the country of\r\nold called _ferax monstrorum_, shows symptoms of being almost effete\r\nalready; and she will be so, unless the fallow of a peace comes to\r\nrecruit her fertility. But whatever may be represented concerning the\r\nmeanness of the popular spirit, I, for one, do not think so desperately\r\nof the British nation. Our minds, as I said, are light, but they are not\r\ndepraved. We are dreadfully open to delusion and to dejection; but we\r\nare capable of being animated and undeceived.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be concealed: we are a divided people. But in divisions, where\r\na part is to be taken, we are to make a muster of our strength. I have\r\noften endeavored to compute and to class those who, in any political\r\nview, are to be called the people. Without doing something of this sort,\r\nwe must proceed absurdly. We should not be much wiser, if we pretended\r\nto very great accuracy in our estimate; but I think, in the calculation\r\nI have made, the error cannot be very material. In England and Scotland,\r\nI compute that those of adult age, not declining in life, of tolerable\r\nleisure for such discussions, and of some means of information, more or\r\nless, and who are above menial dependence, (or what virtually is such,)\r\nmay amount to about four hundred thousand. There is such a thing as a\r\nnatural representative of the people. This body is that representative;\r\nand on this body, more than on the legal constituent, the artificial\r\nrepresentative depends. This is the British public; and it is a public\r\nvery numerous. The rest, when feeble, are the objects of\r\nprotection,--when strong, the means of force. They who affect to\r\nconsider that part of us in any other light insult while they cajole us;\r\nthey do not want us for counsellors in deliberation, but to list us as\r\nsoldiers for battle.\r\n\r\nOf these four hundred thousand political citizens, I look upon one\r\nfifth, or about eighty thousand, to be pure Jacobins, utterly incapable\r\nof amendment, objects of eternal vigilance, and, when they break out, of\r\nlegal constraint. On these, no reason, no argument, no example, no\r\nvenerable authority, can have the slightest influence. They desire a\r\nchange; and they will have it, if they can. If they cannot have it by\r\nEnglish cabal, they will make no sort of scruple of having it by the\r\ncabal of France, into which already they are virtually incorporated. It\r\nis only their assured and confident expectation of the advantages of\r\nFrench fraternity, and the approaching blessings of Regicide\r\nintercourse, that skins over their mischievous dispositions with a\r\nmomentary quiet.\r\n\r\nThis minority is great and formidable. I do not know whether, if I aimed\r\nat the total overthrow of a kingdom, I should wish to be incumbered with\r\na larger body of partisans. They are more easily disciplined and\r\ndirected than if the number were greater. These, by their spirit of\r\nintrigue, and by their restless agitating activity, are of a force far\r\nsuperior to their numbers, and, if times grew the least critical, have\r\nthe means of debauching or intimidating many of those who are now sound,\r\nas well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more passive\r\npart of the nation. This minority is numerous enough to make a mighty\r\ncry for peace, or for war, or for any object they are led vehemently to\r\ndesire. By passing from place to place with a velocity incredible, and\r\ndiversifying their character and description, they are capable of\r\nmimicking the general voice. We must not always judge of the generality\r\nof the opinion by the noise of the acclamation.\r\n\r\nThe majority, the other four fifths, is perfectly sound, and of the best\r\npossible disposition to religion, to government, to the true and\r\nundivided interest of their country. Such men are naturally disposed to\r\npeace. They who are in possession of all they wish are languid and\r\nimprovident. With this fault, (and I admit its existence in all its\r\nextent,) they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin\r\nof everything for which peace is dear to them. However, the desire of\r\npeace is essentially the weak side of that kind of men. All men that are\r\nruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities. There they\r\nare unguarded. Above all, good men do not suspect that their destruction\r\nis attempted through their virtues. This their enemies are perfectly\r\naware of; and accordingly they, the most turbulent of mankind, who never\r\nmade a scruple to shake the tranquillity of their country to its centre,\r\nraise a continual cry for peace with France. \"Peace with Regicide, and\r\nwar with the rest of the world,\" is their motto. From the beginning, and\r\neven whilst the French gave the blows, and we hardly opposed the _vis\r\ninertiæ_ to their efforts, from that day to this hour, like importunate\r\nGuinea-fowls, crying one note day and night, they have called for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn this they are, as I confess in all things they are, perfectly\r\nconsistent. They who wish to unite themselves to your enemies naturally\r\ndesire that you should disarm yourself by a peace with these enemies.\r\nBut it passes my conception how they who wish well to their country on\r\nits ancient system of laws and manners come not to be doubly alarmed,\r\nwhen they find nothing but a clamor for peace in the mouths of the men\r\non earth the least disposed to it in their natural or in their habitual\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nI have a good opinion of the general abilities of the Jacobins: not that\r\nI suppose them better born than others; but strong passions awaken the\r\nfaculties; they suffer not a particle of the man to be lost. The spirit\r\nof enterprise gives to this description the full use of all their native\r\nenergies. If I have reason to conceive that my enemy, who, as such, must\r\nhave an interest in my destruction, is also a person of discernment and\r\nsagacity, then I must be quite sure, that, in a contest, the object he\r\nviolently pursues is the very thing by which my ruin is likely to be the\r\nmost perfectly accomplished. Why do the Jacobins cry for peace? Because\r\nthey know, that, this point gained, the rest will follow of course. On\r\nour part, why are all the rules of prudence, as sure as the laws of\r\nmaterial Nature, to be, at this time reversed? How comes it, that now,\r\nfor the first time, men think it right to be governed by the counsels of\r\ntheir enemies? Ought they not rather to tremble, when they are persuaded\r\nto travel on the same road and to tend to the same place of rest?\r\n\r\nThe minority I speak of is not susceptible of an impression from the\r\ntopics of argument to be used to the larger part of the community. I\r\ntherefore do not address to them any part of what I have to say. The\r\nmore forcibly I drive my arguments against their system, so as to make\r\nan impression where I wish to make it, the more strongly I rivet them in\r\ntheir sentiments. As for us, who compose the far larger, and what I call\r\nthe far better part of the people, let me say, that we have not been\r\nquite fairly dealt with, when called to this deliberation. The Jacobin\r\nminority have been abundantly supplied with stores and provisions of all\r\nkinds towards their warfare. No sort of argumentative materials, suited\r\nto their purposes, have been withheld. False they are, unsound,\r\nsophistical; but they are regular in their direction. They all bear one\r\nway, and they all go to the support of the substantial merits of their\r\ncause. The others have not had the question so much as fairly stated to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere has not been in this century any foreign peace or war, in its\r\norigin the fruit of popular desire, except the war that was made with\r\nSpain in 1739. Sir Robert Walpole was forced into the war by the people,\r\nwho were inflamed to this measure by the most leading politicians, by\r\nthe first orators, and the greatest poets of the time. For that war Pope\r\nsang his dying notes. For that war Johnson, in more energetic strains,\r\nemployed the voice of his early genius. For that war Glover\r\ndistinguished himself in the way in which his muse was the most natural\r\nand happy. The crowd readily followed the politicians in the cry for a\r\nwar which threatened little bloodshed, and which promised victories that\r\nwere attended with something more solid than glory. A war with Spain was\r\na war of plunder. In the present conflict with Regicide, Mr. Pitt has\r\nnot hitherto had, nor will perhaps for a few days have, many prizes to\r\nhold out in the lottery of war, to tempt the lower part of our\r\ncharacter. He can only maintain it by an appeal to the higher; and to\r\nthose in whom that higher part is the most predominant he must look the\r\nmost for his support. Whilst he holds out no inducements to the wise nor\r\nbribes to the avaricious, he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace\r\nten times more ruinous than the most disastrous war. The weaker he is in\r\nthe fund of motives which apply to our avarice, to our laziness, and to\r\nour lassitude, if he means to carry the war to any end at all, the\r\nstronger he ought to be in his addresses to our magnanimity and to our\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIn stating that Walpole was driven by a popular clamor into a measure\r\nnot to be justified, I do not mean wholly to excuse his conduct. My time\r\nof observation did not exactly coincide with that event, but I read much\r\nof the controversies then carried on. Several years after the contests\r\nof parties had ceased, the people were amused, and in a degree warmed\r\nwith them. The events of that era seemed then of magnitude, which the\r\nrevolutions of our time have reduced to parochial importance; and the\r\ndebates which then shook the nation now appear of no higher moment than\r\na discussion in a vestry. When I was very young, a general fashion told\r\nme I was to admire some of the writings against that minister; a little\r\nmore maturity taught me as much to despise them. I observed one fault in\r\nhis general proceeding. He never manfully put forward the entire\r\nstrength of his cause. He temporized, be managed, and, adopting very\r\nnearly the sentiments of his adversaries, he opposed their inferences.\r\nThis, for a political commander, is the choice of a weak post. His\r\nadversaries had the better of the argument as he handled it, not as the\r\nreason and justice of his cause enabled him to manage it. I say this,\r\nafter having seen, and with some care examined, the original documents\r\nconcerning certain important transactions of those times. They perfectly\r\nsatisfied me of the extreme injustice of that war, and of the falsehood\r\nof the colors which, to his own ruin, and guided by a mistaken policy,\r\nhe suffered to be daubed over that measure. Some years after, it was my\r\nfortune to converse with many of the principal actors against that\r\nminister, and with those who principally excited that clamor. None of\r\nthem, no, not one, did in the least defend the measure, or attempt to\r\njustify their conduct. They condemned it as freely as they would have\r\ndone in commenting upon any proceeding in history in which they were\r\ntotally unconcerned. Thus it will be. They who stir up the people to\r\nimproper desires, whether of peace or war, will be condemned by\r\nthemselves. They who weakly yield to them will be condemned by history.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the present ministry are as far from doing full justice\r\nto their cause in this war as Walpole was from doing justice to the\r\npeace which at that time he was willing to preserve. They throw the\r\nlight on one side only of their case; though it is impossible they\r\nshould not observe that the other side, which is kept in the shade, has\r\nits importance too. They must know that France is formidable, not only\r\nas she is France, but as she is Jacobin France. They knew from the\r\nbeginning that the Jacobin party was not confined to that country. They\r\nknew, they felt, the strong disposition of the same faction in both\r\ncountries to communicate and to coöperate. For some time past, these two\r\npoints have been kept, and even industriously kept, out of sight. France\r\nis considered as merely a foreign power, and the seditious English only\r\nas a domestic faction. The merits of the war with the former have been\r\nargued solely on political grounds. To prevent the mischievous doctrines\r\nof the latter from corrupting our minds, matter and argument have been\r\nsupplied abundantly, and even to surfeit, on the excellency of our own\r\ngovernment. But nothing has been done to make us feel in what manner the\r\nsafety of that government is connected with the principle and with the\r\nissue of this war. For anything which in the late discussion has\r\nappeared, the war is entirely collateral to the state of Jacobinism,--as\r\ntruly a foreign war to us and to all our home concerns as the war with\r\nSpain in 1739, about _Guardacostas_, the Madrid Convention, and the\r\nfable of Captain Jenkins's ears.\r\n\r\nWhenever the adverse party has raised a cry for peace with the Regicide,\r\nthe answer has been little more than this: \"That the administration\r\nwished for such a peace full as much as the opposition, but that the\r\ntime was not convenient for making it.\" Whatever else has been said was\r\nmuch in the same spirit. Reasons of this kind never touched the\r\nsubstantial merits of the war. They were in the nature of dilatory\r\npleas, exceptions of form, previous questions. Accordingly, all the\r\narguments against a compliance with what was represented as the popular\r\ndesire (urged on with all possible vehemence and earnestness by the\r\nJacobins) have appeared flat and languid, feeble and evasive. They\r\nappeared to aim only at gaining time. They never entered into the\r\npeculiar and distinctive character of the war. They spoke neither to the\r\nunderstanding nor to the heart. Cold as ice themselves, they never could\r\nkindle in our breasts a spark of that zeal which is necessary to a\r\nconflict with an adverse zeal; much less were they made to infuse into\r\nour minds that stubborn, persevering spirit which alone is capable of\r\nbearing up against those vicissitudes of fortune which will probably\r\noccur, and those burdens which must be inevitably borne, in a long war.\r\nI speak it emphatically, and with a desire that it should be marked,--in\r\na _long_ war; because, without such a war, no experience has yet told us\r\nthat a dangerous power has ever been reduced to measure or to reason. I\r\ndo not throw back my view to the Peloponnesian War of twenty-seven\r\nyears; nor to two of the Punic Wars, the first of twenty-four, the\r\nsecond of eighteen; nor to the more recent war concluded by the Treaty\r\nof Westphalia, which continued, I think, for thirty. I go to what is but\r\njust fallen behind living memory, and immediately touches our own\r\ncountry. Let the portion of our history from the year 1689 to 1713 be\r\nbrought before us. We shall find that in all that period of twenty-four\r\nyears there were hardly five that could be called a season of peace; and\r\nthe interval between the two wars was in reality nothing more than a\r\nvery active preparation for renovated hostility. During that period,\r\nevery one of the propositions of peace came from the enemy: the first,\r\nwhen they were accepted, at the Peace of Ryswick; the second, where they\r\nwere rejected, at the Congress at Gertruydenberg; the last, when the war\r\nended by the Treaty of Utrecht. Even then, a very great part of the\r\nnation, and that which contained by far the most intelligent statesmen,\r\nwas against the conclusion of the war. I do not enter into the merits of\r\nthat question as between the parties. I only state the existence of that\r\nopinion as a fact, from whence you may draw such an inference as you\r\nthink properly arises from it.\r\n\r\nIt is for us at present to recollect what we have been, and to consider\r\nwhat, if we please, we may be still. At the period of those wars our\r\nprincipal strength was found in the resolution of the people, and that\r\nin the resolution of a part only of the then whole, which bore no\r\nproportion to our existing magnitude. England and Scotland were not\r\nunited at the beginning of that mighty struggle. When, in the course of\r\nthe contest, they were conjoined, it was in a raw, an ill-cemented, an\r\nunproductive, union. For the whole duration of the war, and long after,\r\nthe names and other outward and visible signs of approximation rather\r\naugmented than diminished our insular feuds. They were rather the causes\r\nof new discontents and new troubles than promoters of cordiality and\r\naffection. The now single and potent Great Britain was then not only two\r\ncountries, but, from the party heats in both, and the divisions formed\r\nin each of them, each of the old kingdoms within itself, in effect, was\r\nmade up of two hostile nations. Ireland, now so large a source of the\r\ncommon opulence and power, and which, wisely managed, might be made much\r\nmore beneficial and much more effective, was then the heaviest of the\r\nburdens. An army, not much less than forty thousand men, was drawn from\r\nthe general effort, to keep that kingdom in a poor, unfruitful, and\r\nresourceless subjection.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of the empire. The state of our finances was worse,\r\nif possible. Every branch of the revenue became less productive after\r\nthe Revolution. Silver, not as now a sort of counter, but the body of\r\nthe current coin, was reduced so low as not to have above three parts in\r\nfour of the value in the shilling. In the greater part the value hardly\r\namounted to a fourth. It required a dead expense of three millions\r\nsterling to renew the coinage. Public credit, that great, but ambiguous\r\nprinciple, which has so often been predicted as the cause of our certain\r\nruin, but which for a century has been the constant companion, and often\r\nthe means, of our prosperity and greatness, had its origin, and was\r\ncradled, I may say, in bankruptcy and beggary. At this day we have seen\r\nparties contending to be admitted, at a moderate premium, to advance\r\neighteen millions to the exchequer. For infinitely smaller loans, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer of that day, Montagu, the father of public\r\ncredit, counter-securing the state by the appearance of the city with\r\nthe Lord Mayor of London at his side, was obliged, like a solicitor for\r\nan hospital, to go cap in hand from shop to shop, to borrow an hundred\r\npound, and even smaller sums. When made up in driblets as they could,\r\ntheir best securities were at an interest of twelve per cent. Even the\r\npaper of the Bank (now at par with cash, and generally preferred to it)\r\nwas often at a discount of twenty per cent. By this the state of the\r\nrest may be judged.\r\n\r\nAs to our commerce, the imports and exports of the nation, now\r\nsix-and-forty million, did not then amount to ten. The inland trade,\r\nwhich is commonly passed by in this sort of estimates, but which, in\r\npart growing out of the foreign, and connected with it, is more\r\nadvantageous and more substantially nutritive to the state, is not only\r\ngrown in a proportion of near five to one as the foreign, but has been\r\naugmented at least in a tenfold proportion. When I came to England, I\r\nremember but one river navigation, the rate of carriage on which was\r\nlimited by an act of Parliament. It was made in the reign of William the\r\nThird. I mean that of the Aire and Calder. The rate was settled at\r\nthirteen pence. So high a price demonstrated the feebleness of these\r\nbeginnings of our inland intercourse. In my time, one of the longest and\r\nsharpest contests I remember in your House, and which rather resembled a\r\nviolent contention amongst national parties than a local dispute, was,\r\nas well as I can recollect, to hold the price up to threepence. Even\r\nthis, which a very scanty justice to the proprietors required, was done\r\nwith infinite difficulty. As to private credit, there were not, as I\r\nbelieve, twelve bankers' shops at that time out of London. In this their\r\nnumber, when I first saw the country, I cannot be quite exact; but\r\ncertainly those machines of domestic credit were then very few. They are\r\nnow in almost every market-town: and this circumstance (whether the\r\nthing be carried to an excess or not) demonstrates the astonishing\r\nincrease of private confidence, of general circulation, and of internal\r\ncommerce,--an increase out of all proportion to the growth of the\r\nforeign trade. Our naval strength in the time of King William's war was\r\nnearly matched by that of France; and though conjoined with Holland,\r\nthen a maritime power hardly inferior to our own, even with that force\r\nwe were not always victorious. Though finally superior, the allied\r\nfleets experienced many unpleasant reverses on their own element. In two\r\nyears three thousand vessels were taken from the English trade. On the\r\nContinent we lost almost every battle we fought.\r\n\r\nIn 1697, (it is not quite an hundred years ago,) in that state of\r\nthings, amidst the general debasement of the coin, the fall of the\r\nordinary revenue, the failure of all the extraordinary supplies, the\r\nruin of commerce, and the almost total extinction of an infant credit,\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer himself, whom we have just seen begging\r\nfrom door to door, came forward to move a resolution full of vigor, in\r\nwhich, far from being discouraged by the generally adverse fortune and\r\nthe long continuance of the war, the Commons agreed to address the crown\r\nin the following manly, spirited, and truly animating style:--\r\n\r\n\"This is the EIGHTH year in which your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal\r\nsubjects, the Commons in Parliament assembled, have assisted your\r\nMajesty with large supplies for carrying on a just and necessary war, in\r\ndefence of our religion, preservation of our laws, and vindication of\r\nthe rights and liberties of the people of England.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards they proceed in this manner:--\r\n\r\n\"And to show to your Majesty and all Christendom that the Commons of\r\nEngland will not be _amused_ or diverted from their firm resolutions of\r\nobtaining by WAR a safe and honorable peace, we do, in the name of all\r\nthose we represent, renew our assurances to your Majesty that this House\r\nwill support your Majesty and your government against all your enemies,\r\nboth at home and abroad, and that they will effectually assist you in\r\nthe prosecution and carrying on the present war against France.\"\r\n\r\nThe amusement and diversion they speak of was the suggestion of a treaty\r\n_proposed by the enemy_, and announced from the throne. Thus the people\r\nof England felt in the _eighth_, not in the _fourth_ year of the war. No\r\nsighing or panting after negotiation; no motions from the opposition to\r\nforce the ministry into a peace; no messages from ministers to palsy and\r\ndeaden the resolution of Parliament or the spirit of the nation. They\r\ndid not so much as advise the king to listen to the propositions of the\r\nenemy, nor to seek for peace, but through the mediation of a vigorous\r\nwar. This address was moved in an hot, a divided, a factious, and, in a\r\ngreat part, disaffected House of Commons; and it was carried, _nemine\r\ncontradicente_.\r\n\r\nWhile that first war (which was ill smothered by the Treaty of Ryswick)\r\nslept in the thin ashes of a seeming peace, a new conflagration was in\r\nits immediate causes. A fresh and a far greater war was in preparation.\r\nA year had hardly elapsed, when arrangements were made for renewing the\r\ncontest with tenfold fury. The steps which were taken, at that time, to\r\ncompose, to reconcile, to unite, and to discipline all Europe against\r\nthe growth of France, certainly furnish to a statesman the finest and\r\nmost interesting part in the history of that great period. It formed the\r\nmasterpiece of King William's policy, dexterity, and perseverance. Full\r\nof the idea of preserving not only a local civil liberty united with\r\norder to our country, but to embody it in the political liberty, the\r\norder, and the independence of nations united under a natural head, the\r\nking called upon his Parliament to put itself into a posture \"_to\r\npreserve to England the weight and influence it at present had on the\r\ncouncils and affairs_ ABROAD. It will be requisite _Europe_ Should see\r\nyou will not be wanting to yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nBaffled as that monarch was, and almost heartbroken at the\r\ndisappointment he met with in the mode he first proposed for that great\r\nend, he held on his course. He was faithful to his object; and in\r\ncouncils, as in arms, over and over again repulsed, over and over again\r\nhe returned to the charge. All the mortifications he had suffered from\r\nthe last Parliament, and the greater he had to apprehend from that newly\r\nchosen, were not capable of relaxing the vigor of his mind. He was in\r\nHolland when he combined the vast plan of his foreign negotiations. When\r\nhe came to open his design to his ministers in England, even the sober\r\nfirmness of Somers, the undaunted resolution of Shrewsbury, and the\r\nadventurous spirit of Montagu and Orford were staggered. They were not\r\nyet mounted to the elevation of the king. The cabinet, then the regency,\r\nmet on the subject at Tunbridge Wells, the 28th of August, 1698; and\r\nthere, Lord Somers holding the pen, after expressing doubts on the state\r\nof the Continent, which they ultimately refer to the king, as best\r\ninformed, they give him a most discouraging portrait of the spirit of\r\nthis nation. \"So far as relates to England,\" say these ministers, \"it\r\nwould be want of duty not to give your Majesty this clear account: that\r\nthere is _a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally_, so\r\nas not at all to be disposed to _the thought of entering into a new\r\nwar_; and that they seem to be _tired out with taxes_ to a degree beyond\r\nwhat was discerned, till it appeared upon the occasion of _the late\r\nelections_. This is the truth of the fact, upon which your Majesty will\r\ndetermine what resolutions are proper to be taken.\"\r\n\r\nHis Majesty did determine,--and did take and pursue his resolution. In\r\nall the tottering imbecility of a new government, and with Parliament\r\ntotally unmanageable, he persevered. He persevered to expel the fears of\r\nhis people by his fortitude, to steady their fickleness by his\r\nconstancy, to expand their narrow prudence by his enlarged wisdom, to\r\nsink their factious temper in his public spirit. In spite of his people,\r\nhe resolved to make them great and glorious,--to make England, inclined\r\nto shrink into her narrow self, the arbitress of Europe, the tutelary\r\nangel of the human race. In spite of the ministers, who staggered under\r\nthe weight that his mind imposed upon theirs, unsupported as they felt\r\nthemselves by the popular spirit, he infused into them his own soul, he\r\nrenewed in them their ancient heart, he rallied them in the same cause.\r\n\r\nIt required some time to accomplish this work. The people were first\r\ngained, and, through them, their distracted representatives. Under the\r\ninfluence of King William, Holland had rejected the allurements of every\r\nseduction, and had resisted the terrors of every menace. With Hannibal\r\nat her gates, she had nobly and magnanimously refused all separate\r\ntreaty, or anything which might for a moment appear to divide her\r\naffection or her interest or even to distinguish her in identity from\r\nEngland. Having settled the great point of the consolidation (which he\r\nhoped would be eternal) of the countries made for a common interest and\r\ncommon sentiment, the king, in his message to both Houses, calls their\r\nattention to the affairs of the _States General_. The House of Lords\r\nwas perfectly sound, and entirely impressed with the wisdom and dignity\r\nof the king's proceedings. In answer to the message, which you will\r\nobserve was narrowed to a single point, (the danger of the States\r\nGeneral,) after the usual professions of zeal for his service, the Lords\r\nopened themselves at large. They go far beyond the demands of the\r\nmessage. They express themselves as follows.\r\n\r\n\"We take this occasion _further_ to assure your Majesty we are very\r\nsensible of _the great and imminent danger to which the States General\r\nare at present exposed; and we do perfectly agree with them in believing\r\nthat their safety and ours are so inseparably united that whatsoever is\r\nruin to the one must be fatal to the other_.\r\n\r\n\"And we humbly desire your Majesty will be pleased _not only_ to make\r\ngood all the articles of any _former_ treaty to the States General, but\r\nthat you will enter into a strict league offensive and defensive with\r\nthem _for our common preservation; and that you will invite into it all\r\nprinces and states who are concerned in the present visible danger\r\narising from the union of France and Spain_.\r\n\r\n\"And we further desire your Majesty, that you will be pleased to enter\r\ninto such alliances with the _Emperor_ as your Majesty shall think fit,\r\npursuant to the ends of the treaty of 1689: towards all which we assure\r\nyour Majesty of our hearty and sincere assistance; not doubting, but,\r\nwhenever your Majesty shall be obliged to engage for the defence of your\r\nallies, _and for securing the liberty and quiet of Europe_, Almighty God\r\nwill protect your sacred person in so righteous a cause, and that the\r\nunanimity, wealth, and courage of your subjects will carry your Majesty\r\nwith honor and success _through all the difficulties of a_ JUST WAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was more reserved. The late popular disposition was\r\nstill in a great degree prevalent in the representative, after it had\r\nbeen made to change in the constituent body. The principle of the Grand\r\nAlliance was not directly recognized in the resolution of the Commons,\r\nnor the war announced, though they were well aware the alliance was\r\nformed for the war. However, compelled by the returning sense of the\r\npeople, they went so far as to fix the three great immovable pillars of\r\nthe safety and greatness of England, as they were then, as they are now,\r\nand as they must ever be to the end of time. They asserted in general\r\nterms the necessity of supporting Holland, of keeping united with our\r\nallies, and maintaining the liberty of Europe; though they restricted\r\ntheir vote to the succors stipulated by actual treaty. But now they were\r\nfairly embarked, they were obliged to go with the course of the vessel;\r\nand the whole nation, split before into an hundred adverse factions,\r\nwith a king at its head evidently declining to his tomb, the whole\r\nnation, lords, commons, and people, proceeded as one body informed by\r\none soul. Under the British union, the union of Europe was consolidated;\r\nand it long held together with a degree of cohesion, firmness, and\r\nfidelity not known before or since in any political combination of that\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nJust as the last hand was given to this immense and complicated machine,\r\nthe master workman died. But the work was formed on true mechanical\r\nprinciples, and it was as truly wrought. It went by the impulse it had\r\nreceived from the first mover. The man was dead; but the Grand Alliance\r\nsurvived, in which King William lived and reigned. That heartless and\r\ndispirited people, whom Lord Somers had represented about two years\r\nbefore as dead in energy and operation, continued that war, to which it\r\nwas supposed they were unequal in mind and in means, for near thirteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFor what have I entered into all this detail? To what purpose have I\r\nrecalled your view to the end of the last century? It has been done to\r\nshow that the British nation was then a great people,--to point out how\r\nand by what means they came to be exalted above the vulgar level, and to\r\ntake that lead which they assumed among mankind. To qualify us for that\r\npreëminence, we had then an high mind and a constancy unconquerable; we\r\nwere then inspired with no flashy passions, but such as were durable as\r\nwell as warm, such as corresponded to the great interests we had at\r\nstake. This force of character was inspired, as all such spirit must\r\never be, from above. Government gave the impulse. As well may we fancy\r\nthat of itself the sea will swell, and that without winds the billows\r\nwill insult the adverse shore, as that the gross mass of the people will\r\nbe moved, and elevated, and continue by a steady and permanent direction\r\nto bear upon one point, without the influence of superior authority or\r\nsuperior mind.\r\n\r\nThis impulse ought, in my opinion, to have been given in this war; and\r\nit ought to have been continued to it at every instant. It is made, if\r\never war was made, to touch all the great springs of action in the human\r\nbreast. It ought not to have been a war of apology. The minister had, in\r\nthis conflict, wherewithal to glory in success, to be consoled in\r\nadversity, to hold high his principle in all fortunes. If it were not\r\ngiven him to support the falling edifice, he ought to bury himself under\r\nthe ruins of the civilized world. All the art of Greece and all the\r\npride and power of Eastern monarchs never heaped upon their ashes so\r\ngrand a monument.\r\n\r\nThere were days when his great mind was up to the crisis of the world he\r\nis called to act in.[29] His manly eloquence was equal to the elevated\r\nwisdom of such sentiments. But the little have triumphed over the great:\r\nan unnatural, (as it should seem,) not an unusual victory. I am sure you\r\ncannot forget with how much uneasiness we heard, in conversation, the\r\nlanguage of more than one gentleman at the opening of this\r\ncontest,--\"that he was willing to try the war for a year or two, and, if\r\nit did not succeed, then to vote for peace.\" As if war was a matter of\r\nexperiment! As if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic!\r\nAs if the dire goddess that presides over it, with her murderous spear\r\nin her hand and her Gorgon at her breast, was a coquette to be flirted\r\nwith! We ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity, that\r\nloves courage, but commands counsel. War never leaves where it found a\r\nnation. It is never to be entered into without a mature\r\ndeliberation,--not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing\r\nindecision, but a deliberation leading to a sure and fixed judgment.\r\nWhen so taken up, it is not to be abandoned without reason as valid, as\r\nfully and as extensively considered. Peace may be made as unadvisedly as\r\nwar. Nothing is so rash as fear; and the counsels of pusillanimity very\r\nrarely put off, whilst they are always sure to aggravate, the evils\r\nfrom which they would fly.\r\n\r\nIn that great war carried on against Louis the Fourteenth for near\r\neighteen years, government spared no pains to satisfy the nation, that,\r\nthough they were to be animated by a desire of glory, glory was not\r\ntheir ultimate object; but that everything dear to them, in religion, in\r\nlaw, in liberty, everything which as freemen, as Englishmen, and as\r\ncitizens of the great commonwealth of Christendom, they had at heart,\r\nwas then at stake. This was to know the true art of gaining the\r\naffections and confidence of an high-minded people; this was to\r\nunderstand human nature. A danger to avert a danger, a present\r\ninconvenience and suffering to prevent a foreseen future and a worse\r\ncalamity,--these are the motives that belong to an animal who in his\r\nconstitution is at once adventurous and provident, circumspect and\r\ndaring,--whom his Creator has made, as the poet says, \"of large\r\ndiscourse, looking before and after.\" But never can a vehement and\r\nsustained spirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of\r\ncalculation. It has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gusts\r\nof adversity. Even where men are willing, as sometimes they are, to\r\nbarter their blood for lucre, to hazard their safety for the\r\ngratification of their avarice, the passion which animates them to that\r\nsort of conflict, like all the shortsighted passions, must see its\r\nobjects distinct and near at hand. The passions of the lower order are\r\nhungry and impatient. Speculative plunder,--contingent spoil,--future,\r\nlong adjourned, uncertain booty,--pillage which must enrich a late\r\nposterity, and which possibly may not reach to posterity at all,--these,\r\nfor any length of time, will never support a mercenary war. The people\r\nare in the right. The calculation of profit in all such wars is false.\r\nOn balancing the account of such wars, ten thousand hogsheads of sugar\r\nare purchased at ten thousand times their price. The blood of man should\r\nnever be shed but to redeem the blood of man. It is well shed for our\r\nfamily, for our friends, for our God, for our country, for our kind. The\r\nrest is vanity; the rest is crime.\r\n\r\nIn the war of the Grand Alliance most of these considerations\r\nvoluntarily and naturally had their part. Some were pressed into the\r\nservice. The political interest easily went in the track of the natural\r\nsentiment. In the reverse course the carriage does not follow freely. I\r\nam sure the natural feeling, as I have just said, is a far more\r\npredominant ingredient in this war than in that of any other that ever\r\nwas waged by this kingdom.\r\n\r\nIf the war made to prevent the union of two crowns upon one head was a\r\njust war, this, which is made to prevent the tearing all crowns from all\r\nheads which ought to wear them, and with the crowns to smite off the\r\nsacred heads themselves, this is a just war.\r\n\r\nIf a war to prevent Louis the Fourteenth from imposing his religion was\r\njust, a war to prevent the murderers of Louis the Sixteenth from\r\nimposing their irreligion upon us is just: a war to prevent the\r\noperation of a system which makes life without dignity and death without\r\nhope is a just war.\r\n\r\nIf to preserve political independence and civil freedom to nations was a\r\njust ground of war, a war to preserve national independence, property,\r\nliberty, life, and honor from certain universal havoc is a war just\r\nnecessary, manly, pious; and we are bound to persevere in it by every\r\nprinciple, divine and human, as long as the system which menaces them\r\nall, and all equally, has an existence in the world.\r\n\r\nYou, who have looked at this matter with as fair and impartial an eye as\r\ncan be united with a feeling heart, you will not think it an hardy\r\nassertion, when I affirm that it were far better to be conquered by any\r\nother nation than to have this faction for a neighbor. Before I felt\r\nmyself authorized to say this, I considered the state of all the\r\ncountries in Europe for these last three hundred years, which have been\r\nobliged to submit to a foreign law. In most of those I found the\r\ncondition of the annexed countries even better, certainly not worse,\r\nthan the lot of those which were the patrimony of the conqueror. They\r\nwanted some blessings, but they were free from many very great evils.\r\nThey were rich and tranquil. Such was Artois, Flanders, Lorraine,\r\nAlsatia, under the old government of France. Such was Silesia under the\r\nKing of Prussia. They who are to live in the vicinity of this new fabric\r\nare to prepare to live in perpetual conspiracies and seditions, and to\r\nend at last in being conquered, if not to her dominion, to her\r\nresemblance. But when we talk of conquest by other nations, it is only\r\nto put a case. This is the only power in Europe by which it is\r\n_possible_ we should be conquered. To live under the continual dread of\r\nsuch immeasurable evils is itself a grievous calamity. To live without\r\nthe dread of them is to turn the danger into the disaster. The influence\r\nof such a France is equal to a war, its example more wasting than an\r\nhostile irruption. The hostility with any other power is separable and\r\naccidental: this power, by the very condition of its existence, by its\r\nvery essential constitution, is in a state of hostility with us, and\r\nwith all civilized people.[30]\r\n\r\nA government of the nature of that set up at our very door has never\r\nbeen hitherto seen or even imagined in Europe. What our relation to it\r\nwill be cannot be judged by other relations. It is a serious thing to\r\nhave a connection with a people who live only under positive, arbitrary,\r\nand changeable institutions,--and those not perfected nor supplied nor\r\nexplained by any common, acknowledged rule of moral science. I remember,\r\nthat, in one of my last conversations with the late Lord Camden, we were\r\nstruck much in the same manner with the abolition in France of the law\r\nas a science of methodized and artificial equity. France, since her\r\nRevolution, is under the sway of a sect whose leaders have deliberately,\r\nat one stroke, demolished the whole body of that jurisprudence which\r\nFrance had pretty nearly in common with other civilized countries. In\r\nthat jurisprudence were contained the elements and principles of the law\r\nof nations, the great ligament of mankind. With the law they have of\r\ncourse destroyed all seminaries in which jurisprudence was taught, as\r\nwell as all the corporations established for its conservation. I have\r\nnot heard of any country, whether in Europe or Asia, or even in Africa\r\non this side of Mount Atlas, which is wholly without some such colleges\r\nand such corporations, except France. No man, in a public or private\r\nconcern, can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be\r\ndirected: nor is there to be found a professor in any university, or a\r\npractitioner in any court, who will hazard an opinion of what is or is\r\nnot law in France, in any case whatever. They have not only annulled all\r\ntheir old treaties, but they have renounced the law of nations, from\r\nwhence treaties have their force. With a fixed design they have outlawed\r\nthemselves, and to their power outlawed all other nations.\r\n\r\nInstead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great\r\npolitic communion with the Christian world, they have constructed their\r\nrepublic on three bases, all fundamentally opposite to those on which\r\nthe communities of Europe are built. Its foundation is laid in Regicide,\r\nin Jacobinism, and in Atheism; and it has joined to those principles a\r\nbody of systematic manners which secures their operation.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked how I would be understood in the use of these terms,\r\nRegicide, Jacobinism, Atheism, and a system of correspondent manners,\r\nand their establishment, I will tell you.\r\n\r\nI call a commonwealth _Regicide_ which lays it down as a fixed law of\r\nNature and a fundamental right of man, that all government, not being a\r\ndemocracy, is an usurpation,[31]--that all kings, as such, are usurpers,\r\nand, for being kings, may and ought to be put to death, with their\r\nwives, families, and adherents. The commonwealth which acts uniformly\r\nupon those principles, and which, after abolishing every festival of\r\nreligion, chooses the most flagrant act of a murderous regicide treason\r\nfor a feast of eternal commemoration, and which forces all her people to\r\nobserve it,--this I call _Regicide by Establishment_.\r\n\r\nJacobinism is the revolt of the enterprising talents of a country\r\nagainst its property. When private men form themselves into associations\r\nfor the purpose of destroying the preëxisting laws and institutions of\r\ntheir country,--when they secure to themselves an army by dividing\r\namongst the people of no property the estates of the ancient and lawful\r\nproprietors,--when a state recognizes those acts,--when it does not make\r\nconfiscations for crimes, but makes crimes for confiscations,--when it\r\nhas its principal strength and all its resources in such a violation of\r\nproperty,--when it stands chiefly upon such a violation, massacring by\r\njudgments, or otherwise, those who make any struggle for their old legal\r\ngovernment, and their legal, hereditary, or acquired possessions,--I\r\ncall this _Jacobinism by Establishment_.\r\n\r\nI call it _Atheism by Establishment_, when any state, as such, shall not\r\nacknowledge the existence of God as a moral governor of the world,--when\r\nit shall offer to Him no religious or moral worship,--when it shall\r\nabolish the Christian religion by a regular decree,--when it shall\r\npersecute, with a cold, unrelenting, steady cruelty, by every mode of\r\nconfiscation, imprisonment, exile, and death, all its ministers,--when\r\nit shall generally shut up or pull down churches,--when the few\r\nbuildings which remain of this kind shall be opened only for the purpose\r\nof making a profane apotheosis of monsters whose vices and crimes have\r\nno parallel amongst men, and whom all other men consider as objects of\r\ngeneral detestation and the severest animadversion of law. When, in the\r\nplace of that religion of social benevolence and of individual\r\nself-denial, in mockery of all religion, they institute impious,\r\nblasphemous, indecent theatric rites, in honor of their vitiated,\r\nperverted reason, and erect altars to the personification of their own\r\ncorrupted and bloody republic,--when schools and seminaries are founded\r\nat public expense to poison mankind, from generation to generation, with\r\nthe horrible maxims of this impiety,--when, wearied out with incessant\r\nmartyrdom, and the cries of a people hungering and thirsting for\r\nreligion, they permit it only as a tolerated evil,--I call this _Atheism\r\nby Establishment_.\r\n\r\nWhen to these establishments of Regicide, of Jacobinism, and of Atheism,\r\nyou add the _correspondent system of manners_, no doubt can be left on\r\nthe mind of a thinking man concerning their determined hostility to the\r\nhuman race. Manners are of more importance than laws. Upon them, in a\r\ngreat measure, the laws depend. The law touches us but here and there,\r\nand now and then. Manners are what vex or soothe, corrupt or purify,\r\nexalt or debase, barbarize or refine us, by a constant, steady, uniform,\r\ninsensible operation, like that of the air we breathe in. They give\r\ntheir whole form and color to our lives. According to their quality,\r\nthey aid morals, they supply them, or they totally destroy them. Of this\r\nthe new French legislators were aware; therefore, with the same method,\r\nand under the same authority, they settled a system of manners, the most\r\nlicentious, prostitute, and abandoned that ever has been known, and at\r\nthe same time the most coarse, rude, savage, and ferocious. Nothing in\r\nthe Revolution, no, not to a phrase or a gesture, not to the fashion of\r\na hat or a shoe, was left to accident. All has been the result of\r\ndesign; all has been matter of institution. No mechanical means could be\r\ndevised in favor of this incredible system of wickedness and vice, that\r\nhas not been employed. The noblest passions, the love of glory, the love\r\nof country, have been debauched into means of its preservation and its\r\npropagation. All sorts of shows and exhibitions, calculated to inflame\r\nand vitiate the imagination and pervert the moral sense, have been\r\ncontrived. They have sometimes brought forth five or six hundred drunken\r\nwomen calling at the bar of the Assembly for the blood of their own\r\nchildren, as being Royalists or Constitutionalists. Sometimes they have\r\ngot a body of wretches, calling themselves fathers, to demand the murder\r\nof their sons, boasting that Rome had but one Brutus, but that they\r\ncould show five hundred. There were instances in which they inverted and\r\nretaliated the impiety, and produced sons who called for the execution\r\nof their parents. The foundation of their republic is laid in moral\r\nparadoxes. Their patriotism is always prodigy. All those instances to be\r\nfound in history, whether real or fabulous, of a doubtful public spirit,\r\nat which morality is perplexed, reason is staggered, and from which\r\naffrighted Nature recoils, are their chosen and almost sole examples for\r\nthe instruction of their youth.\r\n\r\nThe whole drift of their institution is contrary to that of the wise\r\nlegislators of all countries, who aimed at improving instincts into\r\nmorals, and at grafting the virtues on the stock of the natural\r\naffections. They, on the contrary, have omitted no pains to eradicate\r\nevery benevolent and noble propensity in the mind of men. In their\r\nculture it is a rule always to graft virtues on vices. They think\r\neverything unworthy of the name of public virtue, unless it indicates\r\nviolence on the private. All their new institutions (and with them\r\neverything is new) strike at the root of our social nature. Other\r\nlegislators, knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations, and\r\nconsequently the first element of all duties, have endeavored by every\r\nart to make it sacred. The Christian religion, by confining it to the\r\npairs, and by rendering that relation indissoluble, has by these two\r\nthings done more towards the peace, happiness, settlement, and\r\ncivilization of the world than by any other part in this whole scheme of\r\nDivine wisdom. The direct contrary course has been taken in the\r\nsynagogue of Antichrist,--I mean in that forge and manufactory of all\r\nevil, the sect which predominated in the Constituent Assembly of 1789.\r\nThose monsters employed the same or greater industry to desecrate and\r\ndegrade that state, which other legislators have used to render it holy\r\nand honorable. By a strange, uncalled-for declaration, they pronounced\r\nthat marriage was no better than a common civil contract. It was one of\r\ntheir ordinary tricks, to put their sentiments into the mouths of\r\ncertain personated characters, which they theatrically exhibited at the\r\nbar of what ought to be a serious assembly. One of these was brought out\r\nin the figure of a prostitute, whom they called by the affected name of\r\n\"a mother without being a wife.\" This creature they made to call for a\r\nrepeal of the incapacities which in civilized states are put upon\r\nbastards. The prostitutes of the Assembly gave to this their puppet the\r\nsanction of their greater impudence. In consequence of the principles\r\nlaid down, and the manners authorized, bastards were not long after put\r\non the footing of the issue of lawful unions. Proceeding in the spirit\r\nof the first authors of their Constitution, succeeding Assemblies went\r\nthe full length of the principle, and gave a license to divorce at the\r\nmere pleasure of either party, and at a month's notice. With them the\r\nmatrimonial connection is brought into so degraded a state of\r\nconcubinage, that I believe none of the wretches in London who keep\r\nwarehouses of infamy would give out one of their victims to private\r\ncustody on so short and insolent a tenure. There was, indeed, a kind of\r\nprofligate equity in giving to women the same licentious power. The\r\nreason they assigned was as infamous as the act: declaring that women\r\nhad been too long under the tyranny of parents and of husbands. It is\r\nnot necessary to observe upon the horrible consequences of taking one\r\nhalf of the species wholly out of the guardianship and protection of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe practice of divorce, though in some countries permitted, has been\r\ndiscouraged in all. In the East, polygamy and divorce are in discredit;\r\nand the manners correct the laws. In Rome, whilst Rome was in its\r\nintegrity, the few causes allowed for divorce amounted in effect to a\r\nprohibition. They were only three. The arbitrary was totally excluded;\r\nand accordingly some hundreds of years passed without a single example\r\nof that kind. When manners were corrupted, the laws were relaxed; as the\r\nlatter always follow the former, when they are not able to regulate them\r\nor to vanquish them. Of this circumstance the legislators of vice and\r\ncrime were pleased to take notice, as an inducement to adopt their\r\nregulation: holding out an hope that the permission would as rarely be\r\nmade use of. They knew the contrary to be true; and they had taken good\r\ncare that the laws should be well seconded by the manners. Their law of\r\ndivorce, like all their laws, had not for its object the relief of\r\ndomestic uneasiness, but the total corruption of all morals, the total\r\ndisconnection of social life.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of curiosity to observe the operation of this\r\nencouragement to disorder. I have before me the Paris paper\r\ncorrespondent to the usual register of births, marriages, and deaths.\r\nDivorce, happily, is no regular head of registry amongst civilized\r\nnations. With the Jacobins it is remarkable that divorce is not only a\r\nregular head, but it has the post of honor. It occupies the first place\r\nin the list. In the three first months of the year 1793 the number of\r\ndivorces in that city amounted to 562; the marriages were 1785: so that\r\nthe proportion of divorces to marriages was not much less than one to\r\nthree: a thing unexampled, I believe, among mankind. I caused an inquiry\r\nto be made at Doctors' Commons concerning the number of divorces, and\r\nfound that all the divorces (which, except by special act of Parliament,\r\nare separations, and not proper divorces) did not amount in all those\r\ncourts, and in an hundred years, to much more than one fifth of those\r\nthat passed in the single city of Paris in three months. I followed up\r\nthe inquiry relative to that city through several of the subsequent\r\nmonths, until I was tired, and found the proportions still the same.\r\nSince then I have heard that they have declared for a revisal of these\r\nlaws: but I know of nothing done. It appears as if the contract that\r\nrenovates the world was under no law at all. From this we may take our\r\nestimate of the havoc that has been made through all the relations of\r\nlife. With the Jacobins of France, vague intercourse is without\r\nreproach; marriage is reduced to the vilest concubinage; children are\r\nencouraged to cut the throats of their parents; mothers are taught that\r\ntenderness is no part of their character, and, to demonstrate their\r\nattachment to their party, that they ought to make no scruple to rake\r\nwith their bloody hands in the bowels of those who came from their own.\r\n\r\nTo all this let us join the practice of _cannibalism_, with which, in\r\nthe proper terms, and with the greatest truth, their several factions\r\naccuse each other. By cannibalism I mean their devouring, as a nutriment\r\nof their ferocity, some part of the bodies of those they have murdered,\r\ntheir drinking the blood of their victims, and forcing the victims\r\nthemselves to drink the blood of their kindred slaughtered before their\r\nfaces. By cannibalism I mean also to signify all their nameless,\r\nunmanly, and abominable insults on the bodies of those they slaughter.\r\n\r\nAs to those whom they suffer to die a natural death, they do not permit\r\nthem to enjoy the last consolations of mankind, or those rights of\r\nsepulture which indicate hope, and which mere Nature has taught to\r\nmankind, in all countries, to soothe the afflictions and to cover the\r\ninfirmity of mortal condition. They disgrace men in the entry into life,\r\nthey vitiate and enslave them through the whole course of it, and they\r\ndeprive them of all comfort at the conclusion of their dishonored and\r\ndepraved existence. Endeavoring to persuade the people that they are no\r\nbetter than beasts, the whole body of their institution tends to make\r\nthem beasts of prey, furious and savage. For this purpose the active\r\npart of them is disciplined into a ferocity which has no parallel. To\r\nthis ferocity there is joined not one of the rude, unfashioned virtues\r\nwhich accompany the vices, where the whole are left to grow up together\r\nin the rankness of uncultivated Nature. But nothing is left to Nature in\r\ntheir systems.\r\n\r\nThe same discipline which hardens their hearts relaxes their morals.\r\nWhilst courts of justice were thrust out by revolutionary tribunals, and\r\nsilent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion,\r\nthere were no fewer than nineteen or twenty theatres, great and small,\r\nmost of them kept open at the public expense, and all of them crowded\r\nevery night. Among the gaunt, haggard forms of famine and nakedness,\r\namidst the yells of murder, the tears of affliction, and the cries of\r\ndespair, the song, the dance, the mimic scene, the buffoon laughter,\r\nwent on as regularly as in the gay hour of festive peace. I have it from\r\ngood authority, that under the scaffold of judicial murder, and the\r\ngaping planks that poured down blood on the spectators, the space was\r\nhired out for a show of dancing dogs. I think, without concert, we have\r\nmade the very same remark, on reading some of their pieces, which, being\r\nwritten for other purposes, let us into a view of their social life. It\r\nstruck us that the habits of Paris had no resemblance to the finished\r\nvirtues, or to the polished vice, and elegant, though not blameless\r\nluxury, of the capital of a great empire. Their society was more like\r\nthat of a den of outlaws upon a doubtful frontier,--of a lewd tavern for\r\nthe revels and debauches of banditti, assassins, bravoes, smugglers,\r\nand their more desperate paramours, mixed with bombastic players, the\r\nrefuse and rejected offal of strolling theatres, puffing out ill-sorted\r\nverses about virtue, mixed with the licentious and blasphemous songs\r\nproper to the brutal and hardened course of life belonging to that sort\r\nof wretches. This system of manners in itself is at war with all orderly\r\nand moral society, and is in its neighborhood unsafe. If great bodies of\r\nthat kind were anywhere established in a bordering territory, we should\r\nhave a right to demand of their governments the suppression of such a\r\nnuisance. What are we to do, if the government and the whole community\r\nis of the same description? Yet that government has thought proper to\r\ninvite ours to lay by its unjust hatred, and to listen to the voice of\r\nhumanity as taught by their example.\r\n\r\nThe operation of dangerous and delusive first principles obliges us to\r\nhave recourse to the true ones. In the intercourse between nations, we\r\nare apt to rely too much on the instrumental part. We lay too much\r\nweight upon the formality of treaties and compacts. We do not act much\r\nmore wisely, when we trust to the interests of men as guaranties of\r\ntheir engagements. The interests frequently tear to pieces the\r\nengagements, and the passions trample upon both. Entirely to trust to\r\neither is to disregard our own safety, or not to know mankind. Men are\r\nnot tied to one another by papers and seals. They are led to associate\r\nby resemblances, by conformities, by sympathies. It is with nations as\r\nwith individuals. Nothing is so strong a tie of amity between nation and\r\nnation as correspondence in laws, customs, manners, and habits of life.\r\nThey have more than the force of treaties in themselves. They are\r\nobligations written in the heart. They approximate men to men without\r\ntheir knowledge, and sometimes against their intentions. The secret,\r\nunseen, but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourse holds them\r\ntogether, even when their perverse and litigious nature sets them to\r\nequivocate, scuffle, and fight about the terms of their written\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nAs to war, if it be the means of wrong and violence, it is the sole\r\nmeans of justice amongst nations. Nothing can banish it from the world.\r\nThey who say otherwise, intending to impose upon us, do not impose upon\r\nthemselves. But it is one of the greatest objects of human wisdom to\r\nmitigate those evils which we are unable to remove. The conformity and\r\nanalogy of which I speak, incapable, like everything else, of preserving\r\nperfect trust and tranquillity among men, has a strong tendency to\r\nfacilitate accommodation, and to produce a generous oblivion of the\r\nrancor of their quarrels. With this similitude, peace is more of peace,\r\nand war is less of war. I will go further. There have been periods of\r\ntime in which communities apparently in peace with each other have been\r\nmore perfectly separated than in later times many nations in Europe have\r\nbeen in the course of long and bloody wars. The cause must be sought in\r\nthe similitude throughout Europe of religion, laws, and manners. At\r\nbottom, these are all the same. The writers on public law have often\r\ncalled this _aggregate_ of nations a commonwealth. They had reason. It\r\nis virtually one great state, having the same basis of general law, with\r\nsome diversity of provincial customs and local establishments. The\r\nnations of Europe have had the very same Christian religion, agreeing in\r\nthe fundamental parts, varying a little in the ceremonies and in the\r\nsubordinate doctrines. The whole of the polity and economy of every\r\ncountry in Europe has been derived from the same sources. It was drawn\r\nfrom the old Germanic or Gothic Custumary,--from the feudal\r\ninstitutions, which must be considered as an emanation from that\r\nCustumary; and the whole has been improved and digested into system and\r\ndiscipline by the Roman law. From hence arose the several orders, with\r\nor without a monarch, (which are called States,) in every European\r\ncountry; the strong traces of which, where monarchy predominated, were\r\nnever wholly extinguished or merged in despotism. In the few places\r\nwhere monarchy was cast off, the spirit of European monarchy was still\r\nleft. Those countries still continued countries of States,--that is, of\r\nclasses, orders, and distinctions, such as had before subsisted, or\r\nnearly so. Indeed, the force and form of the institution called States\r\ncontinued in greater perfection in those republican communities than\r\nunder monarchies. From all those sources arose a system of manners and\r\nof education which was nearly similar in all this quarter of the\r\nglobe,--and which softened, blended, and harmonized the colors of the\r\nwhole. There was little difference in the form of the universities for\r\nthe education of their youth, whether with regard to faculties, to\r\nsciences, or to the more liberal and elegant kinds of erudition. From\r\nthis resemblance in the modes of intercourse, and in the whole form and\r\nfashion of life, no citizen of Europe could be altogether an exile in\r\nany part of it. There was nothing more than a pleasing variety to\r\nrecreate and instruct the mind, to enrich the imagination, and to\r\nmeliorate the heart. When a man travelled or resided, for health,\r\npleasure, business, or necessity, from his own country, he never felt\r\nhimself quite abroad.\r\n\r\nThe whole body of this new scheme of manners, in support of the new\r\nscheme of polities, I consider as a strong and decisive proof of\r\ndetermined ambition and systematic hostility. I defy the most refining\r\ningenuity to invent any other cause for the total departure of the\r\nJacobin Republic from every one of the ideas and usages, religious,\r\nlegal, moral, or social, of this civilized world, and for her tearing\r\nherself from its communion with such studied violence, but from a formed\r\nresolution of keeping no terms with that world. It has not been, as has\r\nbeen falsely and insidiously represented, that these miscreants had only\r\nbroke with their old government. They made a schism with the whole\r\nuniverse, and that schism extended to almost everything, great and\r\nsmall. For one, I wish, since it is gone thus far, that the breach had\r\nbeen so complete as to make all intercourse impracticable: but, partly\r\nby accident, partly by design, partly from the resistance of the matter,\r\nenough is left to preserve intercourse, whilst amity is destroyed or\r\ncorrupted in its principle.\r\n\r\nThis violent breach of the community of Europe we must conclude to have\r\nbeen made (even if they had not expressly declared it over and over\r\nagain) either to force mankind into an adoption of their system or to\r\nlive in perpetual enmity with a community the most potent we have ever\r\nknown. Can any person imagine, that, in offering to mankind this\r\ndesperate alternative, there is no indication of a hostile mind, because\r\nmen in possession of the ruling authority are supposed to have a right\r\nto act without coercion in their own territories? As to the right of\r\nmen to act anywhere according to their pleasure, without any moral tie,\r\nno such right exists. Men are never in a state of _total_ independence\r\nof each other. It is not the condition of our nature: nor is it\r\nconceivable how any man can pursue a considerable course of action\r\nwithout its having some effect upon others, or, of course, without\r\nproducing some degree of responsibility for his conduct. The\r\n_situations_ in which men relatively stand produce the rules and\r\nprinciples of that responsibility, and afford directions to prudence in\r\nexacting it.\r\n\r\nDistance of place does not extinguish the duties or the rights of men;\r\nbut it often renders their exercise impracticable. The same circumstance\r\nof distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any\r\ncommunity less pernicious. But there are situations where this\r\ndifficulty does not occur, and in which, therefore, those duties are\r\nobligatory and these rights are to be asserted. It has ever been the\r\nmethod of public jurists to draw a great part of the analogies on which\r\nthey form the law of nations from the principles of law which prevail in\r\ncivil community. Civil laws are not all of them merely positive. Those\r\nwhich are rather conclusions of legal reason than matters of statutable\r\nprovision belong to universal equity, and are universally applicable.\r\nAlmost the whole prætorian law is such. There is a _law of neighborhood_\r\nwhich does not leave a man perfect master on his own ground. When a\r\nneighbor sees a _new erection_, in the nature of a nuisance, set up at\r\nhis door, he has a right to represent it to the judge, who, on his part,\r\nhas a right to order the work to be stayed, or, if established, to be\r\nremoved. On this head the parent law is express and clear, and has made\r\nmany wise provisions, which, without destroying, regulate and restrain\r\nthe right of _ownership_ by the right of _vicinage_. No _innovation_ is\r\npermitted that may redound, even secondarily, to the prejudice of a\r\nneighbor. The whole doctrine of that important head of prætorian law,\r\n\"_De novi operis nunciatione_,\" is founded on the principle, that no\r\n_new_ use should be made of a man's private liberty of operating upon\r\nhis private property, from whence a detriment may be justly apprehended\r\nby his neighbor. This law of denunciation is prospective. It is to\r\nanticipate what is called _damnum infectum_ or _damnum nondum factum_,\r\nthat is, a damage justly apprehended, but not actually done. Even before\r\nit is clearly known whether the innovation be damageable or not, the\r\njudge is competent to issue a prohibition to innovate until the point\r\ncan be determined. This prompt interference is grounded on principles\r\nfavorable to both parties. It is preventive of mischief difficult to be\r\nrepaired, and of ill blood difficult to be softened. The rule of law,\r\ntherefore, which comes before the evil is amongst the very best parts of\r\nequity, and justifies the promptness of the remedy; because, as it is\r\nwell observed, \"_Res damni infecti celeritatem desiderat, et periculosa\r\nest dilatio_.\" This right of denunciation does not hold, when things\r\ncontinue, however inconveniently to the neighborhood, according to the\r\n_ancient_ mode. For there is a sort of presumption against novelty,\r\ndrawn out of a deep consideration of human nature and human affairs; and\r\nthe maxim of jurisprudence is well laid down, \"_Vetustas pro lege semper\r\nhabetur_.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the law of civil vicinity. Now where there is no constituted\r\njudge, as between independent states there is not, the vicinage itself\r\nis the natural judge. It is, preventively, the assertor of its own\r\nrights, or, remedially, their avenger. Neighbors are presumed to take\r\ncognizance of each other's acts. \"_Vicini vicinorum facta præsumuntur\r\nseire_.\" This principle, which, like the rest, is as true of nations as\r\nof individual men, has bestowed on the grand vicinage of Europe a duty\r\nto know and a right to prevent any capital innovation which may amount\r\nto the erection of a dangerous nuisance.[32] Of the importance of that\r\ninnovation, and the mischief of that nuisance, they are, to be sure,\r\nbound to judge not litigiously: but it is in their competence to judge.\r\nThey have uniformly acted on this right. What in civil society is a\r\nground of action in politic society is a ground of war. But the exercise\r\nof that competent jurisdiction is a matter of moral prudence. As suits\r\nin civil society, so war in the political, must ever be a matter of\r\ngreat deliberation. It is not this or that particular proceeding, picked\r\nout here and there, as a subject of quarrel, that will do. There must be\r\nan aggregate of mischief. There must be marks of deliberation; there\r\nmust be traces of design; there must be indications of malice; there\r\nmust be tokens of ambition. There must be force in the body where they\r\nexist; there must be energy in the mind. When all these circumstances\r\ncombine, or the important parts of them, the duty of the vicinity calls\r\nfor the exercise of its competence: and the rules of prudence do not\r\nrestrain, but demand it.\r\n\r\nIn describing the nuisance erected by so pestilential a manufactory, by\r\nthe construction of so infamous a brothel, by digging a night-cellar for\r\nsuch thieves, murderers, and house-breakers as never infested the world,\r\nI am so far from aggravating, that I have fallen infinitely short of the\r\nevil. No man who has attended to the particulars of what has been done\r\nin France, and combined them with the principles there asserted, can\r\npossibly doubt it. When I compare with this great cause of nations the\r\ntrifling points of honor, the still more contemptible points of\r\ninterest, the light ceremonies, the undefinable punctilios, the disputes\r\nabout precedency, the lowering or the hoisting of a sail, the dealing in\r\na hundred or two of wildcat-skins on the other side of the globe, which\r\nhave often kindled up the flames of war between nations, I stand\r\nastonished at those persons who do not feel a resentment, not more\r\nnatural than politic, at the atrocious insults that this monstrous\r\ncompound offers to the dignity of every nation, and who are not alarmed\r\nwith what it threatens to their safety.\r\n\r\nI have therefore been decidedly of opinion, with our declaration at\r\nWhitehall in the beginning of this war, that the vicinage of Europe had\r\nnot only a right, but an indispensable duty and an exigent interest, to\r\ndenunciate this new work, before it had produced the danger we have so\r\nsorely felt, and which we shall long feel. The example of what is done\r\nby France is too important not to have a vast and extensive influence;\r\nand that example, backed with its power, must bear with great force on\r\nthose who are near it, especially on those who shall recognize the\r\npretended republic on the principle upon which it now stands. It is not\r\nan old structure, which you have found as it is, and are not to dispute\r\nof the original end and design with which it had been so fashioned. It\r\nis a recent wrong, and can plead no prescription. It violates the rights\r\nupon which not only the community of France, but those on which all\r\ncommunities are founded. The principles on which they proceed are\r\n_general_ principles, and are as true in England as in any other\r\ncountry. They who (though with the purest intentions) recognize the\r\nauthority of these regicides and robbers upon principle justify their\r\nacts, and establish them as precedents. It is a question not between\r\nFrance and England; it is a question between property and force. The\r\nproperty claims; and its claim has been allowed. The property of the\r\nnation is the nation. They who massacre, plunder, and expel the body of\r\nthe proprietary are murderers and robbers. The state, in its essence,\r\nmust be moral and just: and it may be so, though a tyrant or usurper\r\nshould be accidentally at the head of it. This is a thing to be\r\nlamented: but this notwithstanding, the body of the commonwealth may\r\nremain in all its integrity and be perfectly sound in its composition.\r\nThe present case is different. It is not a revolution in government. It\r\nis not the victory of party over party. It is a destruction and\r\ndecomposition of the whole society; which never can be made of right by\r\nany faction, however powerful, nor without terrible consequences to all\r\nabout it, both in the act and in the example. This pretended republic is\r\nfounded in crimes, and exists by wrong and robbery; and wrong and\r\nrobbery, far from a title to anything, is war with mankind. To be at\r\npeace with robbery is to be an accomplice with it.\r\n\r\nMere locality does not constitute a body politic. Had Cade and his gang\r\ngot possession of London, they would not have been the lord mayor,\r\naldermen, and common council. The body politic of France existed in the\r\nmajesty of its throne, in the dignity of its nobility, in the honor of\r\nits gentry, in the sanctity of its clergy, in the reverence of its\r\nmagistracy, in the weight and consideration due to its landed property\r\nin the several bailliages, in the respect due to its movable substance\r\nrepresented by the corporations of the kingdom. All these particular\r\n_molecules_ united form the great mass of what is truly the body politic\r\nin all countries. They are so many deposits and receptacles of justice;\r\nbecause they can only exist by justice. Nation is a moral essence, not a\r\ngeographical arrangement, or a denomination of the nomenclator. France,\r\nthough out of her territorial possession, exists; because the sole\r\npossible claimant, I mean the proprietary, and the government to which\r\nthe proprietary adheres, exists and claims. God forbid, that if you were\r\nexpelled from your house by ruffians and assassins, that I should call\r\nthe material walls, doors, and windows of ---- the ancient and honorable\r\nfamily of ----! Am I to transfer to the intruders, who, not content to\r\nturn you out naked to the world, would rob you of your very name, all\r\nthe esteem and respect I owe to you? The Regicides in France are not\r\nFrance. France is out of her bounds, but the kingdom is the same.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate my opinions on this subject, let us suppose a case, which,\r\nafter what has happened, we cannot think absolutely impossible, though\r\nthe augury is to be abominated, and the event deprecated with our most\r\nardent prayers. Let us suppose, then, that our gracious sovereign was\r\nsacrilegiously murdered; his exemplary queen, at the head of the\r\nmatronage of this land, murdered in the same manner; that those\r\nprincesses whose beauty and modest elegance are the ornaments of the\r\ncountry, and who are the leaders and patterns of the ingenuous youth of\r\ntheir sex, were put to a cruel and ignominious death, with hundreds of\r\nothers, mothers and daughters, ladies of the first distinction; that the\r\nPrince of Wales and the Duke of York, princes the hope and pride of the\r\nnation, with all their brethren, were forced to fly from the knives of\r\nassassins; that the whole body of our excellent clergy were either\r\nmassacred or robbed of all and transported; the Christian religion, in\r\nall its denominations, forbidden and persecuted; the law totally,\r\nfundamentally, and in all its parts, destroyed; the judges put to death\r\nby revolutionary tribunals; the peers and commons robbed to the last\r\nacre of their estates, massacred, if they stayed, or obliged to seek\r\nlife in flight, in exile, and in beggary; that the whole landed property\r\nshould share the very same fate; that every military and naval officer\r\nof honor and rank, almost to a man, should be placed in the same\r\ndescription of confiscation and exile; that the principal merchants and\r\nbankers should be drawn out, as from an hen-coop, for slaughter; that\r\nthe citizens of our greatest and most flourishing cities, when the hand\r\nand the machinery of the hangman were not found sufficient, should have\r\nbeen collected in the public squares and massacred by thousands with\r\ncannon; if three hundred thousand others should have been doomed to a\r\nsituation worse than death in noisome and pestilential prisons. In such\r\na case, is it in the faction of robbers I am to look for my country?\r\nWould this be the England that you and I, and even strangers, admired,\r\nhonored, loved, and cherished? Would not the exiles of England alone be\r\nmy government and my fellow-citizens? Would not their places of refuge\r\nbe my temporary country? Would not all my duties and all my affections\r\nbe there, and there only? Should I consider myself as a traitor to my\r\ncountry, and deserving of death, if I knocked at the door and heart of\r\nevery potentate in Christendom to succor my friends, and to avenge them\r\non their enemies? Could I in any way show myself more a patriot? What\r\nshould I think of those potentates who insulted their suffering\r\nbrethren,--who treated them as vagrants, or at least as mendicants,--and\r\ncould find no allies, no friends, but in regicide murderers and robbers?\r\nWhat ought I to think and feel, if, being geographers instead of kings,\r\nthey recognized the desolated cities, the wasted fields, and the rivers\r\npolluted with blood, of this geometrical measurement, as the honorable\r\nmember of Europe called England? In that condition, what should we think\r\nof Sweden, Denmark, or Holland, or whatever power afforded us a churlish\r\nand treacherous hospitality, if they should invite us to join the\r\nstandard of our king, our laws, and our religion,--if they should give\r\nus a direct promise of protection,--if, after all this, taking advantage\r\nof our deplorable situation, which left us no choice, they were to treat\r\nus as the lowest and vilest of all mercenaries,--if they were to send us\r\nfar from the aid of our king and our suffering country, to squander us\r\naway in the most pestilential climates for a venal enlargement of their\r\nown territories, for the purpose of trucking them, when obtained, with\r\nthose very robbers and murderers they had called upon us to oppose with\r\nour blood? What would be our sentiments, if in that miserable service we\r\nwere not to be considered either as English, or as Swedes, Dutch, Danes,\r\nbut as outcasts of the human race? Whilst we were fighting those battles\r\nof their interest and as their soldiers, how should we feel, if we were\r\nto be excluded from all their cartels? How must we feel, if the pride\r\nand flower of the English nobility and gentry, who might escape the\r\npestilential clime and the devouring sword, should, if taken prisoners,\r\nbe delivered over as rebel subjects, to be condemned as rebels, as\r\ntraitors, as the vilest of all criminals, by tribunals formed of Maroon\r\nnegro slaves, covered over with the blood of their masters, who were\r\nmade free and organized into judges for their robberies and murders?\r\nWhat should we feel under this inhuman, insulting, and barbarous\r\nprotection of Muscovites, Swedes, or Hollanders? Should we not obtest\r\nHeaven, and whatever justice there is yet on earth? Oppression makes\r\nwise men mad; but the distemper is still the madness of the wise, which\r\nis better than the sobriety of fools. Their cry is the voice of sacred\r\nmisery, exalted, not into wild raving, but into the sanctified frenzy of\r\nprophecy and inspiration. In that bitterness of soul, in that\r\nindignation of suffering virtue, in that exaltation of despair, would\r\nnot persecuted English loyalty cry out with an awful warning voice, and\r\ndenounce the destruction that waits on monarchs who consider fidelity\r\nto them as the most degrading of all vices, who suffer it to be punished\r\nas the most abominable of all crimes, and who have no respect but for\r\nrebels, traitors, regicides, and furious negro slaves, whose crimes have\r\nbroke their chains? Would not this warm language of high indignation\r\nhave more of sound reason in it, more of real affection, more of true\r\nattachment, than all the lullabies of flatterers who would hush monarchs\r\nto sleep in the arms of death? Let them be well convinced, that, if ever\r\nthis example should prevail in its whole extent, it will have its full\r\noperation. Whilst kings stand firm on their base, though under that base\r\nthere is a sure-wrought mine, there will not be wanting to their levees\r\na single person of those who are attached to their fortune, and not to\r\ntheir persons or cause; but hereafter none will support a tottering\r\nthrone. Some will fly for fear of being crushed under the ruin; some\r\nwill join in making it. They will seek, in the destruction of royalty,\r\nfame and power and wealth and the homage of kings, with Reubell, with\r\nCarnot, with Révellière, and with the Merlins and the Talliens, rather\r\nthan suffer exile and beggary with the Condés, or the Broglies, the\r\nCastries, the D'Avarays, the Sérents, the Cazalès, and the long line of\r\nloyal, suffering, patriot nobility, or to be butchered with the oracles\r\nand the victims of the laws, the D'Ormessons, the D'Esprémesnils, and\r\nthe Malesherbes. This example we shall give, if, instead of adhering to\r\nour fellows in a cause which is an honor to us all, we abandon the\r\nlawful government and lawful corporate body of France, to hunt for a\r\nshameful and ruinous fraternity with this odious usurpation that\r\ndisgraces civilized society and the human race.\r\n\r\nAnd is, then, example nothing? It is everything. Example is the school\r\nof mankind, and they will learn at no other. This war is a war against\r\nthat example. It is not a war for Louis the Eighteenth, or even for the\r\nproperty, virtue, fidelity of France. It is a war for George the Third,\r\nfor Francis the Second, and for all the dignity, property, honor,\r\nvirtue, and religion of England, of Germany, and of all nations.\r\n\r\nI know that all I have said of the systematic unsociability of this\r\nnew-invented species of republic, and the impossibility of preserving\r\npeace, is answered by asserting that the scheme of manners, morals, and\r\neven of maxims and principles of state, is of no weight in a question of\r\npeace or war between communities. This doctrine is supported by example.\r\nThe case of Algiers is cited, with an hint, as if it were the stronger\r\ncase. I should take no notice of this sort of inducement, if I had found\r\nit only where first it was. I do not want respect for those from whom I\r\nfirst heard it; but, having no controversy at present with them, I only\r\nthink it not amiss to rest on it a little, as I find it adopted, with\r\nmuch more of the same kind, by several of those on whom such reasoning\r\nhad formerly made no apparent impression. If it had no force to prevent\r\nus from submitting to this necessary war, it furnishes no better ground\r\nfor our making an unnecessary and ruinous peace.\r\n\r\nThis analogical argument drawn from the case of Algiers would lead us a\r\ngood way. The fact is, we ourselves with a little cover, others more\r\ndirectly, pay a _tribute_ to the Republic of Algiers. Is it meant to\r\nreconcile us to the payment of a _tribute_ to the French Republic? That\r\nthis, with other things more ruinous, will be demanded, hereafter, I\r\nlittle doubt; but for the present this will not be avowed,--though our\r\nminds are to be gradually prepared for it. In truth, the arguments from\r\nthis case are worth little, even to those who approve the buying an\r\nAlgerine forbearance of piracy. There are many things which men do not\r\napprove, that they must do to avoid a greater evil. To argue from thence\r\nthat they are to act in the same manner in all cases is turning\r\nnecessity into a law. Upon what is matter of prudence, the argument\r\nconcludes the contrary way. Because we have done one humiliating act, we\r\nought with infinite caution to admit more acts of the same nature, lest\r\nhumiliation should become our habitual state. Matters of prudence are\r\nunder the dominion of circumstances, and not of logical analogies. It is\r\nabsurd to take it otherwise.\r\n\r\nI, for one, do more than doubt the policy of this kind of convention\r\nwith Algiers. On those who think as I do the argument _ad hominem_ can\r\nmake no sort of impression. I know something of the constitution and\r\ncomposition of this very extraordinary republic. It has a constitution,\r\nI admit, similar to the present tumultuous military tyranny of France,\r\nby which an handful of obscure ruffians domineer over a fertile country\r\nand a brave people. For the composition, too, I admit the Algerine\r\ncommunity resembles that of France,--being formed out of the very scum,\r\nscandal, disgrace, and pest of the Turkish Asia. The Grand Seignior, to\r\ndisburden the country, suffers the Dey to recruit in his dominions the\r\ncorps of janizaries, or asaphs, which form the Directory and Council of\r\nElders of the African Republic one and indivisible. But notwithstanding\r\nthis resemblance, which I allow, I never shall so far injure the\r\nJanizarian Republic of Algiers as to put it in comparison, for every\r\nsort of crime, turpitude, and oppression, with the Jacobin Republic of\r\nParis. There is no question with me to which of the two I should choose\r\nto be a neighbor or a subject. But. situated as I am, I am in no danger\r\nof becoming to Algiers either the one or the other. It is not so in my\r\nrelation to the atheistical fanatics of France. I _am_ their neighbor; I\r\n_may_ become their subject. Have the gentlemen who borrowed this happy\r\nparallel no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the\r\nvery same evil at an immense distance and when it is at your door? when\r\nits power is enormous, as when it is comparatively as feeble as its\r\ndistance is remote? when there is a barrier of language and usages,\r\nwhich prevents corruption through certain old correspondences and\r\nhabitudes, from the contagion of the horrible novelties that are\r\nintroduced into everything else? I can contemplate without dread a royal\r\nor a national tiger on the borders of Pegu. I can look at him with an\r\neasy curiosity, as prisoner within bars in the menagerie of the Tower.\r\nBut if, by _Habeas Corpus_, or otherwise, he was to come into the lobby\r\nof the House of Commons whilst your door was open, any of you would be\r\nmore stout than wise who would not gladly make your escape out of the\r\nback windows. I certainly should dread more from a wild-cat in my\r\nbedchamber than from all the lions that roar in the deserts behind\r\nAlgiers. But in this parallel it is the cat that is at a distance, and\r\nthe lions and tigers that are in our antechambers and our lobbies.\r\nAlgiers is not near; Algiers is not powerful; Algiers is not our\r\nneighbor; Algiers is not infectious. Algiers, whatever it may be, is an\r\nold creation; and we have good data to calculate all the mischief to be\r\napprehended from it. When I find Algiers transferred to Calais, I will\r\ntell you what I think of that point. In the mean time, the case quoted\r\nfrom the Algerine Reports will not apply as authority. We shall put it\r\nout of court; and so far as that goes, let the counsel for the Jacobin\r\npeace take nothing by their motion.\r\n\r\nWhen we voted, as you and I did, with many more whom you and I respect\r\nand love, to resist this enemy, we were providing for dangers that were\r\ndirect, home, pressing, and not remote, contingent, uncertain, and\r\nformed upon loose analogies. We judged of the danger with which we were\r\nmenaced by Jacobin France from the whole tenor of her conduct, not from\r\none or two doubtful or detached acts or expressions. I not only\r\nconcurred in the idea of combining with Europe in this war, but to the\r\nbest of my power even stimulated ministers to that conjunction of\r\ninterests and of efforts. I joined them with all my soul, on the\r\nprinciples contained in that manly and masterly state-paper which I have\r\ntwo or three times referred to,[33] and may still more frequently\r\nhereafter. The diplomatic collection never was more enriched than with\r\nthis piece. The historic facts justify every stroke of the master. \"Thus\r\npainters write their names at Co.\"\r\n\r\nVarious persons may concur in the same measure on various grounds. They\r\nmay be various, without being contrary to or exclusive of each other. I\r\nthought the insolent, unprovoked aggression of the Regicide upon our\r\nally of Holland a good ground of war. I think his manifest attempt to\r\noverturn the balance of Europe a good ground of war. As a good ground\r\nof war I consider his declaration of war on his Majesty and his kingdom.\r\nBut though I have taken all these to my aid, I consider them as nothing\r\nmore than as a sort of evidence to indicate the treasonable mind within.\r\nLong before their acts of aggression and their declaration of war, the\r\nfaction in France had assumed a form, had adopted a body of principles\r\nand maxims, and had regularly and systematically acted on them, by which\r\nshe virtually had put herself in a posture which was in itself a\r\ndeclaration of war against mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is said by the Directory, in their several manifestoes, that we of\r\nthe people are tumultuous for peace, and that ministers pretend\r\nnegotiation to amuse us. This they have learned from the language of\r\nmany amongst ourselves, whose conversations have been one main cause of\r\nwhatever extent the opinion for peace with Regicide may be. But I, who\r\nthink the ministers unfortunately to be but too serious in their\r\nproceedings, find myself obliged to say a little more on this subject of\r\nthe popular opinion.\r\n\r\nBefore our opinions are quoted against ourselves, it is proper, that,\r\nfrom our serious deliberation, they may be worth quoting. It is without\r\nreason we praise the wisdom of our Constitution in putting under the\r\ndiscretion of the crown the awful trust of war and peace, if the\r\nministers of the crown virtually return it again into our hands. The\r\ntrust was placed there as a sacred deposit, to secure us against popular\r\nrashness in plunging into wars, and against the effects of popular\r\ndismay, disgust, or lassitude, in getting out of them as imprudently as\r\nwe might first engage in them. To have no other measure in judging of\r\nthose great objects than our momentary opinions and desires is to throw\r\nus back upon that very democracy which, in this part, our Constitution\r\nwas formed to avoid.\r\n\r\nIt is no excuse at all for a minister who at our desire takes a measure\r\ncontrary to our safety, that it is our own act. He who does not stay the\r\nhand of suicide is guilty of murder. On our part, I say, that to be\r\ninstructed is not to be degraded or enslaved. Information is an\r\nadvantage to us; and we have a right to demand it. He that is bound to\r\nact in the dark cannot be said to act freely. When it appears evident to\r\nour governors that our desires and our interests are at variance, they\r\nought not to gratify the former at the expense of the latter. Statesmen\r\nare placed on an eminence, that they may have a larger horizon than we\r\ncan possibly command. They have a whole before them, which we can\r\ncontemplate only in the parts, and often without the necessary\r\nrelations. Ministers are not only our natural rulers, but our natural\r\nguides. Reason, clearly and manfully delivered, has in itself a mighty\r\nforce; but reason in the mouth of legal authority is, I may fairly say,\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nI admit that reason of state will not, in many circumstances, permit the\r\ndisclosure of the true ground of a public proceeding. In that case\r\nsilence is manly, and it is wise. It is fair to call for trust, when the\r\nprinciple of reason itself suspends its public use. I take the\r\ndistinction to be this: the ground of a particular measure making a part\r\nof a plan it is rarely proper to divulge; all the broader grounds of\r\npolicy, on which the general plan is to be adopted, ought as rarely to\r\nbe concealed. They who have not the whole cause before them, call them\r\npoliticians, call them people, call them what you will, are no judges.\r\nThe difficulties of the case, as well as its fair side, ought to be\r\npresented. This ought to be done; and it is all that can be done. When\r\nwe have our true situation distinctly presented to us, if then we\r\nresolve, with a blind and headlong violence, to resist the admonitions\r\nof our friends, and to cast ourselves into the hands of our potent and\r\nirreconcilable foes, then, and not till then, the ministers stand\r\nacquitted before God and man for whatever may come.\r\n\r\nLamenting, as I do, that the matter has not had so full and free a\r\ndiscussion as it requires, I mean to omit none of the points which seem\r\nto me necessary for consideration, previous to an arrangement which is\r\nforever to decide the form and the fate of Europe. In the course,\r\ntherefore, of what I shall have the honor to address to you, I propose\r\nthe following questions to your serious thoughts.--1. Whether the\r\npresent system, which stands for a government, in France, be such as in\r\npeace and war affects the neighboring states in a manner different from\r\nthe internal government that formerly prevailed in that country?--2.\r\nWhether that system, supposing its views hostile to other nations,\r\npossesses any means of being hurtful to them peculiar to itself?--3.\r\nWhether there has been lately such a change in France as to alter the\r\nnature of its system, or its effect upon other powers?--4. Whether any\r\npublic declarations or engagements exist, on the part of the allied\r\npowers, which stand in the way of a treaty of peace which supposes the\r\nright and confirms the power of the Regicide faction in France?--5. What\r\nthe state of the other powers of Europe will be with respect to each\r\nother and their colonies, on the conclusion of a Regicide peace?--6.\r\nWhether we are driven to the absolute necessity of making that kind of\r\npeace?\r\n\r\nThese heads of inquiry will enable us to make the application of the\r\nseveral matters of fact and topics of argument, that occur in this vast\r\ndiscussion, to certain fixed principles. I do not mean to confine myself\r\nto the order in which they stand. I shall discuss them in such a manner\r\nas shall appear to me the best adapted for showing their mutual bearings\r\nand relations. Here, then, I close the public matter of my letter; but\r\nbefore I have done, let me say one word in apology for myself.\r\n\r\nIn wishing this nominal peace not to be precipitated, I am sure no man\r\nliving is less disposed to blame the present ministry than I am. Some of\r\nmy oldest friends (and I wish I could say it of more of them) make a\r\npart in that ministry. There are some, indeed, \"whom my dim eyes in vain\r\nexplore.\" In my mind, a greater calamity could not have fallen on the\r\npublic than the exclusion of one of them. But I drive away that, with\r\nother melancholy thoughts. A great deal ought to be said upon that\r\nsubject, or nothing. As to the distinguished persons to whom my friends\r\nwho remain are joined, if benefits nobly and generously conferred ought\r\nto procure good wishes, they are entitled to my best vows; and they have\r\nthem all. They have administered to me the only consolation I am capable\r\nof receiving, which is, to know that no individual will suffer by my\r\nthirty years' service to the public. If things should give us the\r\ncomparative happiness of a struggle, I shall be found, I was going to\r\nsay fighting, (that would be foolish,) but dying, by the side of Mr.\r\nPitt. I must add, that, if anything defensive in our domestic system\r\ncan possibly save us from the disasters of a Regicide peace, he is the\r\nman to save us. If the finances in such a case can be repaired, he is\r\nthe man to repair them. If I should lament any of his acts, it is only\r\nwhen they appear to me to have no resemblance to acts of his. But let\r\nhim not have a confidence in himself which no human abilities can\r\nwarrant. His abilities are fully equal (and that is to say much for any\r\nman) to those which are opposed to him. But if we look to him as our\r\nsecurity against the consequences of a Regicide peace, let us be assured\r\nthat a Regicide peace and a constitutional ministry are terms that will\r\nnot agree. With a Regicide peace the king cannot long have a minister to\r\nserve him, nor the minister a king to serve. If the Great Disposer, in\r\nreward of the royal and the private virtues of our sovereign, should\r\ncall him from the calamitous spectacles which will attend a state of\r\namity with Regicide, his successor will surely see them, unless the same\r\nProvidence greatly anticipates the course of Nature. Thinking thus, (and\r\nnot, as I conceive, on light grounds,) I dare not flatter the reigning\r\nsovereign, nor any minister he has or can have, nor his successor\r\napparent, nor any of those who may be called to serve him, with what\r\nappears to me a false state of their situation. We cannot have them and\r\nthat peace together.\r\n\r\nI do not forget that there had been a considerable difference between\r\nseveral of our friends (with my insignificant self) and the great man at\r\nthe head of ministry, in an early stage of these discussions. But I am\r\nsure there was a period in which we agreed better in the danger of a\r\nJacobin existence in France. At one time he and all Europe seemed to\r\nfeel it. But why am not I converted with so many great powers and so\r\nmany great ministers? It is because I am old and slow. I am in this\r\nyear, 1796, only where all the powers of Europe were in 1793. I cannot\r\nmove with this precession of the equinoxes, which is preparing for us\r\nthe return of some very old, I am afraid no golden era, or the\r\ncommencement of some new era that must be denominated from some new\r\nmetal. In this crisis I must hold my tongue or I must speak with\r\nfreedom. Falsehood and delusion are allowed in no case whatever: but, as\r\nin the exercise of all the virtues, there is an economy of truth. It is\r\na sort of temperance, by which a man speaks truth with measure, that he\r\nmay speak it the longer. But as the same rules do not hold in all cases,\r\nwhat would be right for you, who may presume on a series of years before\r\nyou, would have no sense for me, who cannot, without absurdity,\r\ncalculate on six months of life. What I say I _must_ say at once.\r\nWhatever I write is in its nature testamentary. It may have the\r\nweakness, but it has the sincerity, of a dying declaration. For the few\r\ndays I have to linger here I am removed completely from the busy scene\r\nof the world; but I hold myself to be still responsible for everything\r\nthat I have done whilst I continued on the place of action. If the\r\nrawest tyro in politics has been influenced by the authority of my gray\r\nhairs, and led by anything in my speeches or my writings to enter into\r\nthis war, he has a right to call upon me to know why I have changed my\r\nopinions, or why, when those I voted with have adopted better notions, I\r\npersevere in exploded error.\r\n\r\nWhen I seem not to acquiesce in the acts of those I respect in every\r\ndegree short of superstition, I am obliged to give my reasons fully. I\r\ncannot set my authority against their authority. But to exert reason is\r\nnot to revolt against authority. Reason and authority do not move in the\r\nsame parallel. That reason is an _amicus curiæ_ who speaks _de plano_,\r\nnot _pro tribunali_. It is a friend who makes an useful suggestion to\r\nthe court, without questioning its jurisdiction. Whilst he acknowledges\r\nits competence, he promotes its efficiency. I shall pursue the plan I\r\nhave chalked out in my letters that follow this.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] \"Mussabat tacito medicina timore.\"\r\n\r\n[23] Mr. Bird, sent to state the real situation of the Duc de Choiseul.\r\n\r\n[24] Boissy d'Anglas.\r\n\r\n[25] \"This Court has seen, with regret, how far the tone and spirit of\r\nthat answer, the nature and extent of the demands which it contains, and\r\nthe manner of announcing them, are remote from any disposition for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"The inadmissible pretension is there avowed of appropriating to France\r\nall that the laws actually existing there may have comprised under the\r\ndenomination of French territory. To a demand such as this is added an\r\nexpress declaration that no proposal contrary to it will be made or even\r\nlistened to: and this, under the pretence of an internal regulation, the\r\nprovisions of which are wholly foreign to all other nations.\r\n\r\n\"While these dispositions shall be persisted in, nothing is left for the\r\nking but to prosecute a war equally just and necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever his enemies shall manifest more pacific sentiments, his\r\nMajesty will at all times be eager to concur in them, by lending\r\nhimself, in concert with his allies, to all such measures as shall be\r\nbest calculated to reëstablish general tranquillity on conditions just,\r\nhonorable, and permanent: either by the establishment of a congress,\r\nwhich has been so often and so happily the means of restoring peace to\r\nEurope; or by a preliminary discussion of the principles which may be\r\nproposed, on either side, as a foundation of a general pacification; or,\r\nlastly, by an impartial examination of any other way which may be\r\npointed out to him for arriving at the same salutary end.\r\n\r\n\"_Downing Street, April 10th_, 1796.\"\r\n\r\n[26] _Official Note, extracted from the Journal of the Defenders of the\r\nCountry_.\r\n\r\n \"EXECUTIVE DIRECTORY.\r\n\r\n \"Different journals have advanced that an English\r\n plenipotentiary had reached Paris, and had presented himself to\r\n the Executive Directory, but that, his propositions not having\r\n appeared satisfactory, he had received orders instantly to quit\r\n France.\r\n\r\n \"All these assertions are equally false.\r\n\r\n \"The notices given in the English papers of a minister having\r\n been sent to Paris, there to treat of peace, bring to\r\n recollection the overtures of Mr. Wickham to the ambassador of\r\n the Republic at Basle, and the rumors circulated relative to the\r\n mission of Mr. Hammond to the Court of Prussia. The\r\n _insignificance_, or rather the _subtle duplicity_, the PUNIC\r\n _style_ of Mr. Wickham's note, is not forgotten. According to\r\n the partisans of the English ministry, it was to Paris that Mr.\r\n Hammond was to come to speak for peace. When his destination\r\n became public, and it was known that he went to Prussia, the\r\n same writer repeated that it was to accelerate a peace, and not\r\n withstanding the object, now well known, of this negotiation was\r\n to engage Prussia to break her treaties with the Republic, and\r\n to return into the coalition. The Court of Berlin, faithful to\r\n its engagements, repulsed these _perfidious_ propositions. But\r\n in converting this intrigue into a mission for peace, the\r\n English ministry joined to the hope of giving a new enemy to\r\n France _that of justifying the continuance of the war in the\r\n eyes of the English nation, and of throwing all the odium of it\r\n on the French, government_. Such was also the aim of Mr.\r\n Wickham's note. _Such is still, that of the notices given at\r\n this time in the English papers_.\r\n\r\n This aim will appear evident, if we reflect how difficult it is\r\n that the ambitious government of England should sincerely wish\r\n for a, peace that would _snatch from it its maritime\r\n preponderancy, would reëstablish the freedom of the seas, would\r\n give a new impulse to the Spanish, Dutch, and French marines_,\r\n and would carry to the highest degree of prosperity the industry\r\n and commerce of those nations in, which it has always found\r\n _rivals_, and which it has considered as _enemies_ of its\r\n commerce, when they were tired of being its _dupes_.\r\n\r\n \"_But there will no longer be any credit given to the pacific\r\n intentions of the English ministry when it is known that its\r\n gold and its intrigues, its open practices and its insinuations,\r\n besiege more than ever the Cabinet of Vienna, and are one of the\r\n principal obstacles to the negotiation which, that Cabinet would\r\n of itself be induced to enter on for peace_.\r\n\r\n \"They will no longer _be credited_, finally, when the moment of\r\n the rumor of these overtures being circulated is considered.\r\n _The English nation supports impatiently the continuance of the\r\n war; a reply must be made to its complaints, its reproaches_:\r\n the Parliament is about to reopen, its sittings; the mouths of\r\n the orators who will declaim against the war must be shut, the\r\n demand of new taxes must be justified; and to obtain these\r\n results, it is necessary to be enabled to advance, that the\r\n French government refuses every reasonable proposition of\r\n peace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[27] \"In their place has succeeded a system destructive of all public\r\norder, maintained by proscriptions, exiles, and confiscations without\r\nnumber,--by arbitrary imprisonments,--by massacres which cannot be\r\nremembered without horror,--and at length by the execrable murder of a\r\njust and beneficent sovereign, and of the illustrious princess, who\r\nwith, an unshaken firmness has shared all the misfortunes of her royal\r\nconsort, his protracted sufferings, his cruel captivity, his ignominious\r\ndeath.\"--\"They [the Allies] have had to encounter acts of aggression\r\nwithout pretext, open violations of all treaties, unprovoked\r\ndeclarations of war,--in a word, whatever corruption, intrigue, or\r\nviolence could effect, for the purpose, so openly avowed, of subverting\r\nall the institutions of society, and of extending' over all the nations\r\nof Europe that confusion which has produced the misery of France. This\r\nstate of things cannot exist in France, without involving all the\r\nsurrounding powers in one common danger,--without giving them the right,\r\nwithout imposing it upon them as a duty, to stop the progress of an evil\r\nwhich exists only by the successive violation of all law and all\r\nproperty, and which attacks the Fundamental principles by which mankind\r\nis united in the bonds of civil society.\"--\"The king would propose none\r\nother than equitable and moderate conditions: not such as the expenses,\r\nthe risks, and the sacrifices of the war might justify, but such as his\r\nMajesty thinks himself under the indispensable necessity of requiring,\r\nwith a view to these considerations, and still more to that of his own\r\nsecurity and of the future tranquillity of Europe. His Majesty desires\r\nnothing more sincerely than thus to terminate a war which he in vain\r\nendeavored to avoid, and all the calamities of which, as now experienced\r\nby France, are to be attributed only to the ambition, the perfidy, and\r\nthe violence of those whose crimes have involved their own country in\r\nmisery and disgraced all civilized nations.\"--\"The king promises on his\r\npart the suspension of hostilities, friendship, and (as far as the\r\ncourse of events will allow, of which the will of man cannot dispose)\r\nsecurity and protection to all those who, by declaring for a monarchical\r\ngovernment, shall shake off the yoke of a sanguinary anarchy: of that\r\nanarchy which, has broken all the most sacred bonds of society,\r\ndissolved all the relations of civil life, violated every right,\r\nconfounded every duty; which uses the name of liberty to exercise the\r\nmost cruel tyranny, to annihilate all property, to seize on all\r\npossessions; which founds its power on the pretended consent of the\r\npeople, and itself carries fire and sword through extensive provinces\r\nfor having demanded their laws, their religion, and their _lawful\r\nsovereign_.\"\r\n\r\n Declaration sent by his Majesty's command to the commanders of\r\n his Majesty's fleets and armies employed against France and to\r\n his Majesty's ministers employed at foreign courts. _Whitehall,\r\n Oct_. 29, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[28] \"Ut lethargicus hic, cum fit pugil, et medicum urget.\"--HOB.\r\n\r\n[29] See the Declaration.\r\n\r\n[30] See Declaration, Whitehall, October 29, 1793.\r\n\r\n[31] Nothing could be more solemn than their promulgation of this\r\nprinciple, as a preamble to the destructive code of their famous\r\narticles for the decomposition of society, into whatever country they\r\nshould enter. \"La Convention Nationale, après avoir entendu le rapport\r\nde ses comités de finances, de la guerre, et diplomatiques réunis,\r\nfidèle au _principe de souveraineté de peuples, qui ne lui permet pas de\r\nreconnaître aucune institution qui y porte atteinte_\" &c., &c.--_Décree\r\nsur le Rapport de Cambon, Dec. 18, 1702_.

The system of peace must have a reference\r\nto the system of the war. On that ground, I must therefore again recall\r\nyour mind to our original opinions, which time and events have not\r\ntaught me to vary.\r\n\r\nMy ideas and my principles led me, in this contest, to encounter France,\r\nnot as a state, but as a faction. The vast territorial extent of that\r\ncountry, its immense population, its riches of production, its riches of\r\ncommerce and convention, the whole aggregate mass of what in ordinary\r\ncases constitutes the force of a state, to me were but objects of\r\nsecondary consideration. They might be balanced; and they have been\r\noften more than balanced. Great as these things are, they are not what\r\nmake the faction formidable. It is the faction that makes them truly\r\ndreadful. That faction is the evil spirit that possesses the body of\r\nFrance,--that informs it as a soul,--that stamps upon its ambition, and\r\nupon all its pursuits, a characteristic mark, which strongly\r\ndistinguishes them from the same general passions and the same general\r\nviews in other men and in other communities. It is that spirit which\r\ninspires into them a new, a pernicious, a desolating activity.\r\nConstituted as France was ten years ago, it was not in that France to\r\nshake, to shatter, and to overwhelm Europe in the manner that we behold.\r\nA sure destruction impends over those infatuated princes who, in the\r\nconflict with this new and unheard-of power, proceed as if they were\r\nengaged in a war that bore a resemblance to their former contests, or\r\nthat they can make peace in the spirit of their former arrangements of\r\npacification. Here the beaten path is the very reverse of the safe road.\r\n\r\nAs to me, I was always steadily of opinion that this disorder was not in\r\nits nature intermittent. I conceived that the contest, once begun, could\r\nnot be laid down again, to be resumed at our discretion, but that our\r\nfirst struggle with this evil would also be our last. I never thought we\r\ncould make peace with the system; because it was not for the sake of an\r\nobject we pursued in rivalry with each other, but with the system itself\r\nthat we were at war. As I understood the matter, we were at war, not\r\nwith its conduct, but with its existence,--convinced that its existence\r\nand its hostility were the same.\r\n\r\nThe faction is not local or territorial. It is a general evil. Where it\r\nleast appears in action, it is still full of life. In its sleep it\r\nrecruits its strength and prepares its exertion. Its spirit lies deep in\r\nthe corruptions of our common nature. The social order which restrains\r\nit feeds it. It exists in every country in Europe, and among all orders\r\nof men in every country, who look up to France as to a common head. The\r\ncentre is there. The circumference is the world of Europe, wherever the\r\nrace of Europe may be settled. Everywhere else the faction is militant;\r\nin France it is triumphant. In France is the bank of deposit and the\r\nbank of circulation of all the pernicious principles that are forming in\r\nevery state. It will be a folly scarcely deserving of pity, and too\r\nmischievous for contempt, to think of restraining it in any other\r\ncountry whilst it is predominant there. War, instead of being the cause\r\nof its force, has suspended its operation. It has given a reprieve, at\r\nleast, to the Christian world.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of a Jacobin war, in the beginning, was by most of the\r\nChristian powers felt, acknowledged, and even in the most precise manner\r\ndeclared. In the joint manifesto published by the Emperor and the King\r\nof Prussia, on the 4th of August, 1792, it is expressed in the clearest\r\nterms, and on principles which could not fail, if they had adhered to\r\nthem, of classing those monarchs with the first benefactors of mankind.\r\nThis manifesto was published, as they themselves express it, \"to lay\r\nopen to the present generation, as well as to posterity, their motives,\r\ntheir intentions, and the _disinterestedness_ of their personal views:\r\ntaking up arms for the purpose of preserving social and political order\r\namongst all civilized nations, and to secure to _each_ state its\r\nreligion, happiness, independence, territories, and real\r\nconstitution.\"--\"On this ground they hoped that all empires and all\r\nstates would be unanimous, and, becoming the firm guardians of the\r\nhappiness of mankind, that they could not fail to unite their efforts to\r\nrescue a numerous nation from its own fury, to preserve Europe from the\r\nreturn of barbarism, and the universe from the subversion and anarchy\r\nwith which it was threatened.\" The whole of that noble performance ought\r\nto be read at the first meeting of any congress which may assemble for\r\nthe purpose of pacification. In that piece \"these powers expressly\r\nrenounce all views of personal aggrandizement,\" and confine themselves\r\nto objects worthy of so generous, so heroic, and so perfectly wise and\r\npolitic an enterprise. It was to the principles of this confederation,\r\nand to no other, that we wished our sovereign and our country to accede,\r\nas a part of the commonwealth of Europe. To these principles, with some\r\ntrifling exceptions and limitations, they did fully accede.[34] And all\r\nour friends who took office acceded to the ministry, (whether wisely or\r\nnot,) as I always understood the matter, on the faith and on the\r\nprinciples of that declaration.\r\n\r\nAs long as these powers flattered themselves that the menace of force\r\nwould produce the effect of force, they acted on those declarations; but\r\nwhen their menaces failed of success, their efforts took a new\r\ndirection. It did not appear to them that virtue and heroism ought to be\r\npurchased by millions of rix-dollars. It is a dreadful truth, but it is\r\na truth that cannot be concealed: in ability, in dexterity, in the\r\ndistinctness of their views, the Jacobins are our superiors. They saw\r\nthe thing right from the very beginning. Whatever were the first motives\r\nto the war among politicians, they saw that in its spirit, and for its\r\nobjects, it was a _civil war_; and as such they pursued it. It is a war\r\nbetween the partisans of the ancient civil, moral, and political order\r\nof Europe against a sect of fanatical and ambitious atheists which means\r\nto change them all. It is not France extending a foreign empire over\r\nother nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning\r\nwith the conquest of France. The leaders of that sect secured _the\r\ncentre of Europe_; and that secured, they knew, that, whatever might be\r\nthe event of battles and sieges, their _cause_ was victorious. Whether\r\nits territory had a little more or a little less peeled from its\r\nsurface, or whether an island or two was detached from its commerce, to\r\nthem was of little moment. The conquest of France was a glorious\r\nacquisition. That once well laid as a basis of empire, opportunities\r\nnever could be wanting to regain or to replace what had been lost, and\r\ndreadfully to avenge themselves on the faction of their adversaries.\r\n\r\nThey saw it was _a civil war_. It was their business to persuade their\r\nadversaries that it ought to be a _foreign_ war. The Jacobins everywhere\r\nset up a cry against the new crusade; and they intrigued with effect in\r\nthe cabinet, in the field, and in every private society in Europe. Their\r\ntask was not difficult. The condition of princes, and sometimes of first\r\nministers too, is to be pitied. The creatures of the desk and the\r\ncreatures of favor had no relish for the principles of the manifestoes.\r\nThey promised no governments, no regiments, no revenues from whence\r\nemoluments might arise by perquisite or by grant. In truth, the tribe of\r\nvulgar politicians are the lowest of our species. There is no trade so\r\nvile and mechanical as government in their hands. Virtue is not their\r\nhabit. They are out of themselves in any course of conduct recommended\r\nonly by conscience and glory. A large, liberal, and prospective view of\r\nthe interests of states passes with them for romance, and the principles\r\nthat recommend it for the wanderings of a disordered imagination. The\r\ncalculators compute them out of their senses. The jesters and buffoons\r\nshame them out of everything grand and elevated. Littleness in object\r\nand in means to them appears soundness and sobriety. They think there is\r\nnothing worth pursuit, but that which they can handle, which they can\r\nmeasure with a two-foot rule, which they can tell upon ten fingers.\r\n\r\nWithout the principles of the Jacobins, perhaps without any principles\r\nat all, they played the game of that faction. There was a beaten road\r\nbefore them. The powers of Europe were armed; France had always appeared\r\ndangerous; the war was easily diverted from France as a faction to\r\nFrance as a state. The princes were easily taught to slide back into\r\ntheir old, habitual course of politics. They were easily led to consider\r\nthe flames that were consuming France, not as a warning to protect their\r\nown buildings, (which were without any party-wall, and linked by a\r\ncontignation into the edifice of France,) but as an happy occasion for\r\npillaging the goods, and for carrying off the materials of their\r\nneighbor's house. Their provident fears were changed into avaricious\r\nhopes. They carried on their new designs without seeming to abandon the\r\nprinciples of their old policy. They pretended to seek, or they\r\nflattered themselves that they sought, in the accession of new\r\nfortresses and new territories a _defensive_ security. But the security\r\nwanted was against a kind of power which was not so truly dangerous in\r\nits fortresses nor in its territories as in its spirit and its\r\nprinciples. They aimed, or pretended to aim, at _defending_ themselves\r\nagainst a danger from which there can be no security in any _defensive_\r\nplan. If armies and fortresses were a defence against Jacobinism, Louis\r\nthe Sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThis error obliged them, even in their offensive operations, to adopt a\r\nplan of war against the success of which there was something little\r\nshort of mathematical demonstration. They refused to take any step which\r\nmight strike at the heart of affairs. They seemed unwilling to wound the\r\nenemy in any vital part. They acted through the whole as if they really\r\nwished the conservation of the Jacobin power, as what might be more\r\nfavorable than the lawful government to the attainment of the petty\r\nobjects they looked for. They always kept on the circumference; and the\r\nwider and remoter the circle was, the more eagerly they chose it as\r\ntheir sphere of action in this centrifugal war. The plan they pursued in\r\nits nature demanded great length of time. In its execution, they who\r\nwent the nearest way to work were obliged to cover an incredible extent\r\nof country. It left to the enemy every means of destroying this extended\r\nline of weakness. Ill success in any part was sure to defeat the effect\r\nof the whole. This is true of Austria. It is still more true of England.\r\nOn this false plan, even good fortune, by further weakening the victor,\r\nput him but the further off from his object.\r\n\r\nAs long as there was any appearance of success, the spirit of\r\naggrandizement, and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy, seized\r\nupon all the coalesced powers. Some sought an accession of territory at\r\nthe expense of France, some at the expense of each other, some at the\r\nexpense of third parties; and when the vicissitude of disaster took its\r\nturn, they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThe greatest skill, conducting the greatest military apparatus, has\r\nbeen employed; but it has been worse than uselessly employed, through\r\nthe false policy of the war. The operations of the field suffered by the\r\nerrors of the cabinet. If the same spirit continues, when peace is made,\r\nthe peace will fix and perpetuate all the errors of the war; because it\r\nwill be made upon the same false principle. What has been lost in the\r\nfield, in the field may be regained. An arrangement of peace in its\r\nnature is a permanent settlement: it is the effect of counsel and\r\ndeliberation, and not of fortuitous events. If built upon a basis\r\nfundamentally erroneous, it can only be retrieved by some of those\r\nunforeseen dispensations which the all-wise, but mysterious, Governor of\r\nthe world sometimes interposes, to snatch nations from ruin. It would\r\nnot be pious error, but mad and impious presumption, for any one to\r\ntrust in an unknown order of dispensations, in defiance of the rules of\r\nprudence, which are formed upon the known march of the ordinary\r\nprovidence of God.\r\n\r\nIt was not of that sort of war that I was amongst the least\r\nconsiderable, but amongst the most zealous advisers; and it is not by\r\nthe sort of peace now talked of that I wish it concluded. It would\r\nanswer no great purpose to enter into the particular errors of the war.\r\nThe whole has been but one error. It was but nominally a war of\r\nalliance. As the combined powers pursued it, there was nothing to hold\r\nan alliance together. There could be no tie of _honor_ in a society for\r\npillage. There could be no tie of a common _interest_, where the object\r\ndid not offer such a division amongst the parties as could well give\r\nthem a warm concern in the gains of each other, or could, indeed, form\r\nsuch a body of equivalents as might make one of them willing to abandon\r\na separate object of his ambition for the gratification of any other\r\nmember of the alliance. The partition of Poland offered an object of\r\nspoil in which the parties _might_ agree. They were circumjacent, and\r\neach might take a portion convenient to his own territory. They might\r\ndispute about the value of their several shares, but the contiguity to\r\neach of the demandants always furnished the means of an adjustment.\r\nThough hereafter the world will have cause to rue this iniquitous\r\nmeasure, and they most who were most concerned in it, for the moment\r\nthere was wherewithal in the object to preserve peace amongst\r\nconfederates in wrong. But the spoil of France did not afford the same\r\nfacilities for accommodation. What might satisfy the House of Austria in\r\na Flemish frontier afforded no equivalent to tempt the cupidity of the\r\nKing of Prussia. What might be desired by Great Britain in the West\r\nIndies must be coldly and remotely, if at all, felt as an interest at\r\nVienna, and it would be felt as something worse than a negative interest\r\nat Madrid. Austria, long possessed with unwise and dangerous designs on\r\nItaly, could not be very much in earnest about the conservation of the\r\nold patrimony of the House of Savoy; and Sardinia, who owed to an\r\nItalian force all her means of shutting out France from Italy, of which\r\nshe has been supposed to hold the key, would not purchase the means of\r\nstrength upon one side by yielding it on the other: she would not\r\nreadily give the possession of Novara for the hope of Savoy. No\r\nContinental power was willing to lose any of its Continental objects for\r\nthe increase of the naval power of Great Britain; and Great Britain\r\nwould not give up any of the objects she sought for, as the means of an\r\nincrease to her naval power, to further their aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nThe moment this war came to be considered as a war merely of profit, the\r\nactual circumstances are such that it never could become really a war of\r\nalliance. Nor can the peace be a peace of alliance, until things are put\r\nupon their right bottom.\r\n\r\nI don't find it denied, that, when a treaty is entered into for peace, a\r\ndemand will be made on the Regicides to surrender a great part of their\r\nconquests on the Continent. 'Will they, in the present state of the war,\r\nmake that surrender without an equivalent? This Continental cession must\r\nof course be made in favor of that party in the alliance that has\r\nsuffered losses. That party has nothing to furnish towards an\r\nequivalent. What equivalent, for instance, has Holland to offer, who has\r\nlost her all? What equivalent can come from the Emperor, every part of\r\nwhose territories contiguous to France is already within the pale of the\r\nRegicide dominion? What equivalent has Sardinia to offer for Savoy, and\r\nfor Nice,--I may say, for her whole being? What has she taken from the\r\nfaction of France? She has lost very near her all, and she has gained\r\nnothing. What equivalent has Spain to give? Alas! she has already paid\r\nfor her own ransom the fund of equivalent,--and a dreadful equivalent it\r\nis, to England and to herself. But I put Spain out of the question: she\r\nis a province of the Jacobin empire, and she must make peace or war\r\naccording to the orders she receives from the Directory of Assassins. In\r\neffect and substance, her crown is a fief of Regicide.\r\n\r\nWhence, then, can the compensation be demanded? Undoubtedly from that\r\npower which alone has made some conquests. That power is England. Will\r\nthe Allies, then, give away their ancient patrimony, that England may\r\nkeep islands in the West Indies? They never can protract the war in good\r\nearnest for that object; nor can they act in concert with us, in our\r\nrefusal to grant anything towards their redemption. In that case we are\r\nthus situated: either we must give Europe, bound hand and foot, to\r\nFrance, or we must quit the West Indies without any one object, great or\r\nsmall, towards indemnity and security. I repeat it, without any\r\nadvantage whatever: because, supposing that our conquest could comprise\r\nall that France ever possessed in the tropical America, it never can\r\namount in any fair estimation to a fair equivalent for Holland, for the\r\nAustrian Netherlands, for the Lower Germany,--that is, for the whole\r\nancient kingdom or circle of Burgundy, now under the yoke of Regicide,\r\nto say nothing of almost all Italy, under the same barbarous domination.\r\nIf we treat in the present situation of things, we have nothing in our\r\nhands that can redeem Europe. Nor is the Emperor, as I have observed,\r\nmore rich in the fund of equivalents.\r\n\r\nIf we look to our stock in the Eastern world, our most valuable and\r\nsystematic acquisitions are made in that quarter. Is it from France they\r\nare made? France has but one or two contemptible factories, subsisting\r\nby the offal of the private fortunes of English individuals to support\r\nthem, in any part of India. I look on the taking of the Cape of Good\r\nHope as the securing of a post of great moment; it does honor to those\r\nwho planned and to those who executed that enterprise; but I speak of it\r\nalways as comparatively good,--as good as anything can be in a scheme\r\nof war that repels us from a centre, and employs all our forces where\r\nnothing can be finally decisive. But giving, as I freely give, every\r\npossible credit to these Eastern conquests, I ask one question:--On whom\r\nare they made? It is evident, that, if we can keep our Eastern\r\nconquests, we keep them not at the expense of France, but at the expense\r\nof Holland, our _ally_,--of Holland, the immediate cause of the war, the\r\nnation whom we had undertaken to protect, and not of the Republic which\r\nit was our business to destroy. If we return the African and the Asiatic\r\nconquests, we put them into the hands of a nominal state (to that\r\nHolland is reduced) unable to retain them, and which will virtually\r\nleave them under the direction of France. If we withhold them, Holland\r\ndeclines still more as a state. She loses so much carrying trade, and\r\nthat means of keeping up the small degree of naval power she holds: for\r\nwhich policy alone, and not for any commercial gain, she maintains the\r\nCape, or any settlement beyond it. In that case, resentment, faction,\r\nand even necessity, will throw her more and more into the power of the\r\nnew, mischievous Republic. But on the probable state of Holland I shall\r\nsay more, when in this correspondence I come to talk over with you the\r\nstate in which any sort of Jacobin peace will leave all Europe.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the East Indies.\r\n\r\nAs to the West Indies,--indeed, as to either, if we look for matter of\r\nexchange in order to ransom Europe,--it is easy to show that we have\r\ntaken a terribly roundabout road. I cannot conceive, even if, for the\r\nsake of holding conquests there, we should refuse to redeem Holland,\r\nand the Austrian Netherlands, and the hither Germany, that Spain, merely\r\nas she is Spain, (and forgetting that the Regicide ambassador governs at\r\nMadrid,) will see with perfect satisfaction Great Britain sole mistress\r\nof the isles. In truth, it appears to me, that, when we come to balance\r\nour account, we shall find in the proposed peace only the pure, simple,\r\nand unendowed charms of Jacobin amity. We shall have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that no blood or treasure has been spared by the Allies for\r\nsupport of the Regicide system. We shall reflect at leisure on one great\r\ntruth: that it was ten times more easy totally to destroy the system\r\nitself than, when established, it would be to reduce its power,--and\r\nthat this republic, most formidable abroad, was of all things the\r\nweakest at home; that her frontier was terrible, her interior feeble;\r\nthat it was matter of choice to attack her where she is invincible, and\r\nto spare her where she was ready to dissolve by her own internal\r\ndisorders. We shall reflect that our plan was good neither for offence\r\nnor defence.\r\n\r\nIt would not be at all difficult to prove that an army of an hundred\r\nthousand men, horse, foot, and artillery, might have been employed\r\nagainst the enemy, on the very soil which he has usurped, at a far less\r\nexpense than has been squandered away upon tropical adventures. In these\r\nadventures it was not an enemy we had to vanquish, but a cemetery to\r\nconquer. In carrying on the war in the West Indies, the hostile sword is\r\nmerciful, the country in which we engage is the dreadful enemy. There\r\nthe European conqueror finds a cruel defeat in the very fruits of his\r\nsuccess. Every advantage is but a new demand on England for recruits to\r\nthe West Indian grave. In a West India war, the Regicides have for their\r\ntroops a race of fierce barbarians, to whom the poisoned air, in which\r\nour youth inhale certain death, is salubrity and life. To them the\r\nclimate is the surest and most faithful of allies.\r\n\r\nHad we carried on the war on the side of France which looks towards the\r\nChannel or the Atlantic, we should have attacked our enemy on his weak\r\nand unarmed side. We should not have to reckon on the loss of a man who\r\ndid not fall in battle. We should have an ally in the heart of the\r\ncountry, who to our hundred thousand would at one time have added eighty\r\nthousand men at the least, and all animated by principle, by enthusiasm,\r\nand by vengeance: motives which secured them to the cause in a very\r\ndifferent manner from some of those allies whom we subsidized with\r\nmillions. This ally, (or rather, this principal in the war,) by the\r\nconfession of the Regicide himself, was more formidable to him than all\r\nhis other foes united. Warring there, we should have led our arms to the\r\ncapital of Wrong. Defeated, we could not fail (proper precautions taken)\r\nof a sure retreat. Stationary, and only supporting the royalists, an\r\nimpenetrable barrier, an impregnable rampart, would have been formed\r\nbetween the enemy and his naval power. We are probably the only nation\r\nwho have declined to act against an enemy when it might have been done\r\nin his own country, and who, having an armed, a powerful, and a long\r\nvictorious ally in that country, declined all effectual coöperation, and\r\nsuffered him to perish for want of support. On the plan of a war in\r\nFrance, every advantage that our allies might obtain would be doubled\r\nin its effect. Disasters on the one side might have a fair chance of\r\nbeing compensated by victories on the other. Had we brought the main of\r\nour force to bear upon that quarter, all the operations of the British\r\nand Imperial crowns would have been combined. The war would have had\r\nsystem, correspondence, and a certain direction. But as the war has been\r\npursued, the operations of the two crowns have not the smallest degree\r\nof mutual bearing or relation.\r\n\r\nHad acquisitions in the West Indies been our object, on success in\r\nFrance, everything reasonable in those remote parts might be demanded\r\nwith decorum and justice and a sure effect. Well might we call for a\r\nrecompense in America for those services to which Europe owed its\r\nsafety. Having abandoned this obvious policy connected with principle,\r\nwe have seen the Regicide power taking the reverse course, and making\r\nreal conquests in the West Indies, to which all our dear-bought\r\nadvantages (if we could hold them) are mean and contemptible. The\r\nnoblest island within the tropics, worth all that we possess put\r\ntogether, is by the vassal Spaniard delivered into her hands. The island\r\nof Hispaniola (of which we have but one poor corner, by a slippery hold)\r\nis perhaps equal to England in extent, and in fertility is far superior.\r\nThe part possessed by Spain of that great island, made for the seat and\r\ncentre of a tropical empire, was not improved, to be sure, as the French\r\ndivision had been, before it was systematically destroyed by the\r\nCannibal Republic; but it is not only the far larger, but the far more\r\nsalubrious and more fertile part.\r\n\r\nIt was delivered into the hands of the barbarians, without, as I can\r\nfind, any public reclamation on our part, not only in contravention to\r\none of the fundamental treaties that compose the public law of Europe,\r\nbut in defiance of the fundamental colonial policy of Spain herself.\r\nThis part of the Treaty of Utrecht was made for great general ends,\r\nunquestionably; but whilst it provided for those general ends, it was in\r\naffirmance of that particular policy. It was not to injure, but to save\r\nSpain, by making a settlement of her estate which prohibited her to\r\nalienate to France. It is her policy not to see the balance of West\r\nIndian power overturned by France or by Great Britain. Whilst the\r\nmonarchies subsisted, this unprincipled cession was what the influence\r\nof the elder branch of the House of Bourbon never dared to attempt on\r\nthe younger: but cannibal terror has been more powerful than family\r\ninfluence. The Bourbon monarchy of Spain, is united to the Republic of\r\nFrance by what may be truly called the ties of blood.\r\n\r\nBy this measure the balance of power in the West Indies is totally\r\ndestroyed. It has followed the balance of power in Europe. It is not\r\nalone what shall be left nominally to the Assassins that is theirs.\r\nTheirs is the whole empire of Spain in America. That stroke finishes\r\nall. I should be glad to see our suppliant negotiator in the act of\r\nputting his feather to the ear of the Directory, to make it unclench the\r\nfist, and, by his tickling, to charm that rich prize out of the iron\r\ngripe of robbery and ambition! It does not require much sagacity to\r\ndiscern that no power wholly baffled and defeated in Europe can flatter\r\nitself with conquests in the West Indies. In that state of things it can\r\nneither keep nor hold. No! It cannot even long make war, if the grand\r\nbank and deposit of its force is at all in the West Indies. But here a\r\nscene opens to my view too important to pass by, perhaps too critical to\r\ntouch. Is it possible that it should not present itself in all its\r\nrelations to a mind habituated to consider either war or peace on a\r\nlarge scale or as one whole?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, other ideas have prevailed. A remote, an expensive, a\r\nmurderous, and, in the end, an unproductive adventure, carried on upon\r\nideas of mercantile knight-errantry, without any of the generous\r\nwildness of Quixotism, is considered as sound, solid sense; and a war in\r\na wholesome climate, a war at our door, a war directly on the enemy, a\r\nwar in the heart of his country, a war in concert with an internal ally,\r\nand in combination with the external, is regarded as folly and romance.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, I hold it impossible that these considerations should\r\nhave escaped the statesmen on both sides of the water, and on both sides\r\nof the House of Commons. How a question of peace can be discussed\r\nwithout having them in view I cannot imagine. If you or others see a way\r\nout of these difficulties, I am happy. I see, indeed, a fund from whence\r\nequivalents will be proposed. I see it, but I cannot just now touch it.\r\nIt is a question of high moment. It opens another Iliad of woes to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nSuch is the time proposed for making _a common political peace_ to which\r\nno one circumstance is propitious. As to the grand principle of the\r\npeace, it is left, as if by common consent, wholly out of the question.\r\n\r\nViewing things in this light, I have frequently sunk into a degree of\r\ndespondency and dejection hardly to be described; yet out of the\r\nprofoundest depths of this despair, an impulse which I have in vain\r\nendeavored to resist has urged me to raise one feeble cry against this\r\nunfortunate coalition which is formed at home, in order to make a\r\ncoalition with France, subversive of the whole ancient order of the\r\nworld. No disaster of war, no calamity of season, could ever strike me\r\nwith half the horror which I felt from what is introduced to us by this\r\njunction of parties under the soothing name of peace. We are apt to\r\nspeak of a low and pusillanimous spirit as the ordinary cause by which\r\ndubious wars terminate in humiliating treaties. It is here the direct\r\ncontrary. I am perfectly astonished at the boldness of character, at the\r\nintrepidity of mind, the firmness of nerve, in those who are able with\r\ndeliberation to face the perils of Jacobin fraternity.\r\n\r\nThis fraternity is, indeed, so terrible in its nature, and in its\r\nmanifest consequences, that there is no way of quieting our\r\napprehensions about it, but by totally putting it out of sight, by\r\nsubstituting for it, through a sort of periphrasis, something of an\r\nambiguous quality, and describing such a connection under the terms of\r\n\"_the usual relations of peace and amity_.\" By this means the proposed\r\nfraternity is hustled in the crowd of those treaties which imply no\r\nchange in the public law of Europe, and which do not upon system affect\r\nthe interior condition of nations. It is confounded with those\r\nconventions in which matters of dispute among sovereign powers are\r\ncompromised by the taking off a duty more or less, by the surrender of a\r\nfrontier town or a disputed district on the one side or the other, by\r\npactions in which the pretensions of families are settled, (as by a\r\nconveyancer making family substitutions and successions,) without any\r\nalteration in the laws, manners, religion, privileges, and customs of\r\nthe cities or territories which are the subject of such arrangements.\r\n\r\nAll this body of old conventions, composing the vast and voluminous\r\ncollection called the _Corps Diplomatique_, forms the code or statute\r\nlaw, as the methodized reasonings of the great publicists and jurists\r\nform the digest and jurisprudence, of the Christian world. In these\r\ntreasures are to be found the _usual_ relations of peace and amity in\r\ncivilized Europe; and there the relations of ancient France were to be\r\nfound amongst the rest.\r\n\r\nThe present system in France is not the ancient France. It is not the\r\nancient France with ordinary ambition and ordinary means. It is not a\r\nnew power of an old kind. It is a new power of a new species. When such\r\na questionable shape is to be admitted for the first time into the\r\nbrotherhood of Christendom, it is not a mere matter of idle curiosity to\r\nconsider how far it is in its nature alliable with the rest, or whether\r\n\"the relations of peace and amity\" with this new state are likely to be\r\nof the same nature with the _usual_ relations of the states of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution in France had the relation of France to other nations as\r\none of its principal objects. The changes made by that Revolution were\r\nnot the better to accommodate her to the old and usual relations, but to\r\nproduce new ones. The Revolution was made, not to make France free, but\r\nto make her formidable,--not to make her a neighbor, but a\r\nmistress,--not to make her more observant of laws, but to put her in a\r\ncondition to impose them. To make France truly formidable, it was\r\nnecessary that France should be new-modelled. They who have not\r\nfollowed the train of the late proceedings have been led by deceitful\r\nrepresentations (which deceit made a part in the plan) to conceive that\r\nthis totally new model of a state, in which nothing escaped a change,\r\nwas made with a view to its internal relations only.\r\n\r\nIn the Revolution of France, two sorts of men were principally concerned\r\nin giving a character and determination to its pursuits: the\r\nphilosophers and the politicians. They took different ways, but they met\r\nin the same end.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers had one predominant object, which they pursued with a\r\nfanatical fury,--that is, the utter extirpation of religion. To that\r\nevery question of empire was subordinate. They had rather domineer in a\r\nparish of atheists than rule over a Christian world. Their temporal\r\nambition was wholly subservient to their proselytizing spirit, in which\r\nthey were not exceeded by Mahomet himself.\r\n\r\nThey who have made but superficial studies in the natural history of the\r\nhuman mind have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only\r\ncause of enthusiastic zeal and sectarian propagation. But there is no\r\ndoctrine whatever, on which men can warm, that is not capable of the\r\nvery same effect. The social nature of man impels him to propagate his\r\nprinciples, as much as physical impulses urge him to propagate his kind.\r\nThe passions give zeal and vehemence. The understanding bestows design\r\nand system. The whole man moves under the discipline of his opinions.\r\nReligion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm. When anything\r\nconcerning it becomes an object of much meditation, it cannot be\r\nindifferent to the mind. They who do not love religion hate it. The\r\nrebels to God perfectly abhor the Author of their being. They hate Him\r\n\"with all their heart, with all their mind, with all their soul, and\r\nwith all their strength.\" He never presents Himself to their thoughts,\r\nbut to menace and alarm them. They cannot strike the sun out of heaven,\r\nbut they are able to raise a smouldering smoke that obscures him from\r\ntheir own eyes. Not being able to revenge themselves on God, they have a\r\ndelight in vicariously defacing, degrading, torturing, and tearing in\r\npieces His image in man. Let no one judge of them by what he has\r\nconceived of them, when they were not incorporated, and had no lead.\r\nThey were then only passengers in a common vehicle. They were then\r\ncarried along with the general motion of religion in the community, and,\r\nwithout being aware of it, partook of its influence. In that situation,\r\nat worst, their nature was left free to counterwork their principles.\r\nThey despaired of giving any very general currency to their opinions:\r\nthey considered them as a reserved privilege for the chosen few. But\r\nwhen the possibility of dominion, lead, and propagation presented\r\nthemselves, and that the ambition which before had so often made them\r\nhypocrites might rather gain than lose by a daring avowal of their\r\nsentiments, then the nature of this infernal spirit, which has \"evil for\r\nits good,\" appeared in its full perfection. Nothing, indeed, but the\r\npossession of some power can with any certainty discover what at the\r\nbottom is the true character of any man. Without reading the speeches of\r\nVergniaud, Français of Nantes, Isnard, and some others of that sort, it\r\nwould not be easy to conceive the passion, rancor, and malice of their\r\ntongues and hearts. They worked themselves up to a perfect frenzy\r\nagainst religion and all its professors. They tore the reputation of the\r\nclergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives, before\r\nthey lacerated their bodies by their massacres. This fanatical atheism\r\nleft out, we omit the principal feature in the French Revolution, and a\r\nprincipal consideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a\r\npeace with it.\r\n\r\nThe other sort of men were the politicians. To them, who had little or\r\nnot at all reflected on the subject, religion was in itself no object of\r\nlove or hatred. They disbelieved it, and that was all. Neutral with\r\nregard to that object, they took the side which in the present state of\r\nthings might best answer their purposes. They soon found that they could\r\nnot do without the philosophers; and the philosophers soon made them\r\nsensible that the destruction of religion was to supply them with means\r\nof conquest, first at home, and then abroad. The philosophers were the\r\nactive internal agitators, and supplied the spirit and principles: the\r\nsecond gave the practical direction. Sometimes the one predominated in\r\nthe composition, sometimes the other. The only difference between them\r\nwas in the necessity of concealing the general design for a time, and in\r\ntheir dealing with foreign nations: the fanatics going straight forward\r\nand openly, the politicians by the surer mode of zigzag. In the course\r\nof events, this, among other causes, produced fierce and bloody\r\ncontentions between them; but at the bottom they thoroughly agreed in\r\nall the objects of ambition and irreligion, and substantially in all the\r\nmeans of promoting these ends.\r\n\r\nWithout question, to bring about the unexampled event of the French\r\nRevolution, the concurrence of a very great number of views and passions\r\nwas necessary. In that stupendous work, no one principle by which the\r\nhuman mind may have its faculties at once invigorated and depraved was\r\nleft unemployed; but I can speak it to a certainty, and support it by\r\nundoubted proofs, that the ruling principle of those who acted in the\r\nRevolution _as statesmen_, had the exterior aggrandizement of France as\r\ntheir ultimate end in the most minute part of the internal changes that\r\nwere made. We, who of late years have been drawn from an attention to\r\nforeign affairs by the importance of our domestic discussions, cannot\r\neasily form a conception of the general eagerness of the active and\r\nenergetic part of the French nation, itself the most active and\r\nenergetic of all nations, previous to its Revolution, upon that subject.\r\nI am convinced that the foreign speculators in France, under the old\r\ngovernment, were twenty to one of the same description then or now in\r\nEngland; and few of that description there were who did not emulously\r\nset forward the Revolution. The whole official system, particularly in\r\nthe diplomatic part, the regulars, the irregulars, down to the clerks in\r\noffice, (a corps without all comparison more numerous than the same\r\namongst us,) coöperated in it. All the intriguers in foreign politics,\r\nall the spies, all the intelligencers, actually or late in function, all\r\nthe candidates for that sort of employment, acted solely upon that\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nOn that system of aggrandizement there was but one mind: but two violent\r\nfactions arose about the means. The first wished France, diverted from\r\nthe politics of the Continent, to attend solely to her marine, to feed\r\nit by an increase of commerce, and thereby to overpower England on her\r\nown element. They contended, that, if England were disabled, the powers\r\non the Continent would fall into their proper subordination; that it was\r\nEngland which deranged the whole Continental system of Europe. The\r\nothers, who were by far the more numerous, though not the most outwardly\r\nprevalent at court, considered this plan for France as contrary to her\r\ngenius, her situation, and her natural means. They agreed as to the\r\nultimate object, the reduction of the British power, and, if possible,\r\nits naval power; but they considered an ascendancy on the Continent as a\r\nnecessary preliminary to that undertaking. They argued, that the\r\nproceedings of England herself had proved the soundness of this policy:\r\nthat her greatest and ablest statesmen had not considered the support of\r\na Continental balance against France as a deviation from the principle\r\nof her naval power, but as one of the most effectual modes of carrying\r\nit into effect; that such had been her policy ever since the Revolution,\r\nduring which period the naval strength of Great Britain had gone on\r\nincreasing in the direct ratio of her interference in the politics of\r\nthe Continent. With much stronger reason ought the politics of France to\r\ntake the same direction,--as well for pursuing objects which her\r\nsituation would dictate to her, though England had no existence, as for\r\ncounteracting the politics of that nation: to France Continental\r\npolitics are primary; they looked on them only of secondary\r\nconsideration to England, and, however necessary, but as means necessary\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nWhat is truly astonishing, the partisans of those two opposite systems\r\nwere at once prevalent, and at once employed, and in the very same\r\ntransactions, the one ostensibly, the other secretly, during the latter\r\npart of the reign of Louis the Fifteenth. Nor was there one court in\r\nwhich an ambassador resided on the part of the ministers, in which\r\nanother, as a spy on him, did not also reside on the part of the king:\r\nthey who pursued the scheme for keeping peace on the Continent, and\r\nparticularly with Austria, acting officially and publicly; the other\r\nfaction counteracting and opposing them. These private agents were\r\ncontinually going from their function to the Bastile, and from the\r\nBastile to employment and favor again. An inextricable cabal was formed,\r\nsome of persons of Rank, others of subordinates. But by this means the\r\ncorps of politicians was augmented in number, and the whole formed a\r\nbody of active, adventuring, ambitious, discontented people, despising\r\nthe regular ministry, despising the courts at which they were employed,\r\ndespising the court which employed them.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Louis the Sixteenth[35] was not the first cause of the\r\nevil by which he suffered. He came to it, as to a sort of inheritance,\r\nby the false politics of his immediate predecessor. This system of dark\r\nand perplexed intrigue had come to its perfection before he came to the\r\nthrone; and even then the Revolution strongly operated in all its\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nThere was no point on which the discontented diplomatic politicians so\r\nbitterly arraigned their cabinet as for the decay of French influence in\r\nall others. From quarrelling with the court, they began to complain of\r\nmonarchy itself, as a system of government too variable for any regular\r\nplan of national aggrandizement. They observed that in that sort of\r\nregimen too much depended on the personal character of the prince: that\r\nthe vicissitudes produced by the succession of princes of a different\r\ncharacter, and even the vicissitudes produced in the same man, by the\r\ndifferent views and inclinations belonging to youth, manhood, and age,\r\ndisturbed and distracted the policy of a country made by Nature for\r\nextensive empire, or, what was still more to their taste, for that sort\r\nof general overruling influence which prepared empire or supplied the\r\nplace of it. They had continually in their hands the observations of\r\nMachiavel on Livy. They had Montesquieu's _Grandeur et Décadence des\r\nRomains_ as a manual; and they compared, with mortification, the\r\nsystematic proceedings of a Roman Senate with the fluctuations of a\r\nmonarchy. They observed the very small additions of territory which all\r\nthe power of Prance, actuated by all the ambition of France, had\r\nacquired in two centuries. The Romans had frequently acquired more in a\r\nsingle year. They severely and in every part of it criticized the reign\r\nof Louis the Fourteenth, whose irregular and desultory ambition had\r\nmore provoked than endangered Europe. Indeed, they who will be at the\r\npains of seriously considering the history of that period will see that\r\nthose French politicians had some reason. They who will not take the\r\ntrouble of reviewing it through all its wars and all its negotiations\r\nwill consult the short, but judicious, criticism of the Marquis de\r\nMontalembert on that subject. It may be read separately from his\r\ningenious system of fortification and military defence, on the practical\r\nmerit of which I am unable to form a judgment.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic politicians of whom I speak, and who formed by far the\r\nmajority in that class, made disadvantageous comparisons even between\r\ntheir more legal and formalizing monarchy and the monarchies of other\r\nstates, as a system of power and influence. They observed that France\r\nnot only lost ground herself, but, through the languor and unsteadiness\r\nof her pursuits, and from her aiming through commerce at naval force\r\nwhich she never could attain without losing more on one side than she\r\ncould gain on the other, three great powers, each of them (as military\r\nstates) capable of balancing her, had grown up on the Continent. Russia\r\nand Prussia had been created almost within memory; and Austria, though\r\nnot a new power, and even curtailed in territory, was, by the very\r\ncollision in which she lost that territory, greatly improved in her\r\nmilitary discipline and force. During the reign of Maria Theresa, the\r\ninterior economy of the country was made more to correspond with the\r\nsupport of great armies than formerly it had been. As to Prussia, a\r\nmerely military power, they observed that one war had enriched her with\r\nas considerable a conquest as France had acquired in centuries. Russia\r\nhad broken the Turkish power, by which Austria might be, as formerly she\r\nhad been, balanced in favor of France. They felt it with pain, that the\r\ntwo Northern powers of Sweden and Denmark were in general under the sway\r\nof Russia,--or that, at best, France kept up a very doubtful conflict,\r\nwith many fluctuations of fortune, and at an enormous expense, in\r\nSweden. In Holland the French party seemed, if not extinguished, at\r\nleast utterly obscured, and kept under by a Stadtholder, leaning for\r\nsupport sometimes on Great Britain, sometimes on Prussia, sometimes on\r\nboth, never on France. Even the spreading of the Bourbon family had\r\nbecome merely a family accommodation, and had little effect oh the\r\nnational politics. This alliance, they said, extinguished Spain by\r\ndestroying all its energy, without adding anything to the real power of\r\nFrance in the accession of the forces of its great rival. In Italy the\r\nsame family accommodation, the same national insignificance, were\r\nequally visible. What cure for the radical weakness of the French\r\nmonarchy, to which all the means which wit could devise, or Nature and\r\nfortune could bestow, towards universal empire, was not of force to give\r\nlife or vigor or consistency, but in a republic? Out the word came: and\r\nit never went back.\r\n\r\nWhether they reasoned right or wrong, or that there was some mixture of\r\nright and wrong in their reasoning, I am sure that in this manner they\r\nfelt and reasoned. The different effects of a great military and\r\nambitious republic and of a monarchy of the same description were\r\nconstantly in their mouths. The principle was ready to operate, when\r\nopportunities should offer, which few of them, indeed, foresaw in the\r\nextent in which they were afterwards presented; but these opportunities,\r\nin some degree or other, they all ardently wished for.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Paris in 1773, the treaty of 1756 between Austria and\r\nFrance was deplored as a national, calamity; because it united France in\r\nfriendship with a power at whose expense alone they could hope any\r\nContinental aggrandizement. When the first partition of Poland was made,\r\nin which France had no share, and which had farther aggrandized every\r\none of the three powers of which they were most jealous, I found them in\r\na perfect frenzy of rage and indignation: not that they were hurt at the\r\nshocking and uncolored violence and injustice of that partition, but at\r\nthe debility, improvidence, and want of activity in their government, in\r\nnot preventing it as a means of aggrandizement to their rivals, or in\r\nnot contriving, by exchanges of some kind or other, to obtain their\r\nshare of advantage from that robbery.\r\n\r\nIn that or nearly in that state of things and of opinions came the\r\nAustrian match, which promised to draw the knot, as afterwards in effect\r\nit did, still more closely between the old rival houses. This added\r\nexceedingly to their hatred and contempt of their monarchy. It was for\r\nthis reason that the late glorious queen, who on all accounts was formed\r\nto produce general love and admiration, and whose life was as mild and\r\nbeneficent as her death was beyond example great and heroic, became so\r\nvery soon and so very much the object of an implacable rancor, never to\r\nbe extinguished but in her blood. When I wrote my letter in answer to M.\r\nde Menonville, in the beginning of January, 1791, I had good reason for\r\nthinking that this description of revolutionists did not so early nor so\r\nsteadily point their murderous designs at the martyr king as at the\r\nroyal heroine. It was accident, and the momentary depression of that\r\npart of the faction, that gave to the husband the happy priority in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nFrom this their restless desire of an overruling influence, they bent a\r\nvery great part of their designs and efforts to revive the old French\r\nparty, which was a democratic party, in Holland, and to make a\r\nrevolution there. They were happy at the troubles which the singular\r\nimprudence of Joseph the Second had stirred up in the Austrian\r\nNetherlands. They rejoiced, when they saw him irritate his subjects,\r\nprofess philosophy, send away the Dutch garrisons, and dismantle his\r\nfortifications. As to Holland, they never forgave either the king or the\r\nministry for suffering that object, which they justly looked on as\r\nprincipal in their design of reducing the power of England, to escape\r\nout of their hands. This was the true secret of the commercial treaty,\r\nmade, on their part, against all the old rules and principles of\r\ncommerce, with a view of diverting the English nation, by a pursuit of\r\nimmediate profit, from an attention to the progress of France in its\r\ndesigns upon that republic. The system of the economists, which led to\r\nthe general opening of commerce, facilitated that treaty, but did not\r\nproduce it. They were in despair, when they found, that, by the vigor of\r\nMr. Pitt, supported in this point by Mr. Fox and the opposition, the\r\nobject to which they had sacrificed their manufactures was lost to their\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nThis eager desire of raising France from the condition into which she\r\nhad fallen, as they conceived, from her monarchical imbecility, had been\r\nthe main spring of their precedent interference in that unhappy American\r\nquarrel, the bad effects of which to this nation have not as yet fully\r\ndisclosed themselves. These sentiments had been long lurking in their\r\nbreasts, though their views were only discovered now and then in heat\r\nand as by escapes, but on this occasion they exploded suddenly. They\r\nwere professed with ostentation, and propagated with zeal. These\r\nsentiments were not produced, as some think, by their American alliance.\r\nThe American alliance was produced by their republican principles and\r\nrepublican policy. This new relation undoubtedly did much. The\r\ndiscourses and cabals that it produced, the intercourse that it\r\nestablished, and, above all, the example, which made it seem practicable\r\nto establish a republic in a great extent of country, finished the work,\r\nand gave to that part of the revolutionary faction a degree of strength\r\nwhich required other energies than the late king possessed to resist or\r\neven to restrain. It spread everywhere; but it was nowhere more\r\nprevalent than in the heart of the court. The palace of Versailles, by\r\nits language, seemed a forum of democracy. To have pointed out to most\r\nof those politicians, from their dispositions and movements, what has\r\nsince happened, the fall of their own monarchy, of their own laws, of\r\ntheir own religion, would have been to furnish a motive the more for\r\npushing forward a system on which they considered all these things as\r\nincumbrances. Such in truth they were. And we have seen them succeed,\r\nnot only in the destruction of their monarchy, but in all the objects\r\nof ambition that they proposed from that destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen I contemplate the scheme on which France is formed, and when I\r\ncompare it with these systems with which it is and ever must be in\r\nconflict, those things which seem as defects in her polity are the very\r\nthings which make me tremble. The states of the Christian world have\r\ngrown up to their present magnitude in a great length of time and by a\r\ngreat variety of accidents. They have been improved to what we see them\r\nwith greater or less degrees of felicity and skill. Not one of them has\r\nbeen formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of design. As their\r\nconstitutions are not systematical, they have not been directed to any\r\n_peculiar_ end, eminently distinguished, and superseding every other.\r\nThe objects which they embrace are of the greatest possible variety, and\r\nhave become in a manner infinite. In all these old countries, the state\r\nhas been made to the people, and not the people conformed to the state.\r\nEvery state has pursued not only every sort of social advantage, but it\r\nhas cultivated the welfare of every individual. His wants, his wishes,\r\neven his tastes, have been consulted. This comprehensive scheme\r\nvirtually produced a degree of personal liberty in forms the most\r\nadverse to it. That liberty was found, under monarchies styled absolute,\r\nin a degree unknown to the ancient commonwealths. From hence the powers\r\nof all our modern states meet, in all their movements, with some\r\nobstruction. It is therefore no wonder, that when these states are to be\r\nconsidered as machines to operate for some one great end, that this\r\ndissipated and balanced force is not easily concentred, or made to bear\r\nwith the whole force of the nation upon one point.\r\n\r\nThe British state is, without question, that which pursues the greatest\r\nvariety of ends, and is the least disposed to sacrifice any one of them\r\nto another or to the whole. It aims at taking in the entire circle of\r\nhuman desires, and securing for them their fair enjoyment. Our\r\nlegislature has been ever closely connected, in its most efficient part,\r\nwith individual feeling and individual interest. Personal liberty, the\r\nmost lively of these feelings and the most important of these interests,\r\nwhich in other European countries has rather arisen from the system of\r\nmanners and the habitudes of life than from the laws of the state, (in\r\nwhich it flourished more from neglect than attention,) in England has\r\nbeen a direct object of government.\r\n\r\nOn this principle, England would be the weakest power in the whole\r\nsystem. Fortunately, however, the great riches of this kingdom, arising\r\nfrom a variety of causes, and the disposition of the people, which is as\r\ngreat to spend as to accumulate, has easily afforded a disposable\r\nsurplus that gives a mighty momentum to the state. This difficulty, with\r\nthese advantages to overcome it, has called forth the talents of the\r\nEnglish financiers, who, by the surplus of industry poured out by\r\nprodigality, have outdone everything which has been accomplished in\r\nother nations. The present minister has outdone his predecessors, and,\r\nas a minister of revenue, is far above my power of praise. But still\r\nthere are cases in which England feels more than several others (though\r\nthey all feel) the perplexity of an immense body of balanced advantages\r\nand of individual demands, and of some irregularity in the whole mass.\r\n\r\nFrance differs essentially from all those governments which are formed\r\nwithout system, which exist by habit, and which are confused with the\r\nmultitude and with the complexity of their pursuits. What now stands as\r\ngovernment in France is struck out at a heat. The design is wicked,\r\nimmoral, impious, oppressive: but it is spirited and daring; it is\r\nsystematic; it is simple in its principle; it has unity and consistency\r\nin perfection. In that country, entirely to cut off a branch of\r\ncommerce, to extinguish a manufacture, to destroy the circulation of\r\nmoney, to violate credit, to suspend the course of agriculture, even to\r\nburn a city or to lay waste a province of their own, does not cost them\r\na moment's anxiety. To them the will, the wish, the want, the liberty,\r\nthe toil, the blood of individuals, is as nothing. Individuality is left\r\nout of their scheme of government. The state is all in all. Everything\r\nis referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is\r\ntrusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its\r\nmaxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The state has dominion\r\nand conquest for its sole objects,--dominion over minds by proselytism,\r\nover bodies by arms.\r\n\r\nThus constituted, with an immense body of natural means, which are\r\nlessened in their amount only to be increased in their effect, France\r\nhas, since the accomplishment of the Revolution, a complete unity in its\r\ndirection. It has destroyed every resource of the state which depends\r\nupon opinion and the good-will of individuals. The riches of convention\r\ndisappear. The advantages of Nature in some measure remain; even these,\r\nI admit, are astonishingly lessened; the command over what remains is\r\ncomplete and absolute. We go about asking when assignats will expire,\r\nand we laugh at the last price of them. But what signifies the fate of\r\nthose tickets of despotism? The despotism will find despotic means of\r\nsupply. They have found the short cut to the productions of Nature,\r\nwhile others, in pursuit of them, are obliged to wind through the\r\nlabyrinth of a very intricate state of society. They seize upon the\r\nfruit of the labor; they seize upon the laborer himself. Were France but\r\nhalf of what it is in population, in compactness, in applicability of\r\nits force, situated as it is, and being what it is, it would be too\r\nstrong for most of the states of Europe, constituted as they are, and\r\nproceeding as they proceed. Would it be wise to estimate what the world\r\nof Europe, as well as the world of Asia, had to dread from Genghiz Khân,\r\nupon a contemplation of the resources of the cold and barren spot in the\r\nremotest Tartary from whence first issued that scourge of the human\r\nrace? Ought we to judge from the excise and stamp duties of the rocks,\r\nor from the paper circulation of the sands of Arabia, the power by which\r\nMahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful\r\nempires of the world, beat one of them totally to the ground, broke to\r\npieces the other, and, in not much longer space of time than I have\r\nlived, overturned governments, laws, manners, religion, and extended an\r\nempire from the Indus to the Pyrenees?\r\n\r\nMaterial resources never have supplied, nor ever can supply, the want of\r\nunity in design and constancy in pursuit. But unity in design and\r\nperseverance and boldness in pursuit have never wanted resources, and\r\nnever will. We have not considered as we ought the dreadful energy of a\r\nstate in which the property has nothing to do with the government\r\nReflect, my dear Sir, reflect again and again, on a government in which\r\nthe property is in complete subjection, and where nothing roles but the\r\nmind of desperate men. The condition of a commonwealth not governed by\r\nits property was a combination of things which the learned and ingenious\r\nspeculator, Harrington, who has tossed about society into all forms,\r\nnever could imagine to be possible. We have seen it; the world has felt\r\nit; and if the world will shut their eyes to this state of things, they\r\nwill feel it more. The rulers there have found their resources in\r\ncrimes. The discovery is dreadful, the mine exhaustless. They have\r\neverything to gain, and they have nothing to lose. They have a boundless\r\ninheritance in hope, and there is no medium for them betwixt the highest\r\nelevation and death with infamy. Never can they, who, from the miserable\r\nservitude of the desk, have been raised to empire, again submit to the\r\nbondage of a starving bureau, or the profit of copying music, or writing\r\n_plaidoyers_ by the sheet. It has made me often smile in bitterness,\r\nwhen I have heard talk of an indemnity to such men, provided they\r\nreturned to their allegiance.\r\n\r\nFrom all this what is my inference? It is, that this new system of\r\nrobbery in France cannot be rendered safe by any art; that it _must_ be\r\ndestroyed, or that it will destroy all Europe; that to destroy that\r\nenemy, by some means or other, the force opposed to it should be made to\r\nbear some analogy and resemblance to the force and spirit which that\r\nsystem exerts; that war ought to be made against it in its vulnerable\r\nparts. These are my inferences. In one word, with this republic nothing\r\nindependent can coexist. The errors of Louis the Sixteenth were more\r\npardonable to prudence than any of those of the same kind into which the\r\nallied courts may fall. They have the benefit of his dreadful example.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Louis the Sixteenth was a man of the best intentions that\r\nprobably ever reigned. He was by no means deficient in talents. He had a\r\nmost laudable desire to supply by general reading, and even by the\r\nacquisition of elemental knowledge, an education in all points\r\noriginally defective; but nobody told him (and it was no wonder he\r\nshould not himself divine it) that the world of which he read and the\r\nworld in which he lived were no longer the same. Desirous of doing\r\neverything for the best, fearful of cabal, distrusting his own judgment,\r\nhe sought his ministers of all kinds upon public testimony. But as\r\ncourts are the field for caballers, the public is the theatre for\r\nmountebanks and impostors. The cure for both those evils is in the\r\ndiscernment of the prince. But an accurate and penetrating discernment\r\nis what in a young prince could not be looked for.\r\n\r\nHis conduct in its principle was not unwise; but, like most other of his\r\nwell-meant designs, it failed in his hands. It failed partly from mere\r\nill fortune, to which speculators are rarely pleased to assign that very\r\nlarge share to which she is justly entitled in all human affairs. The\r\nfailure, perhaps, in part, was owing to his suffering his system to be\r\nvitiated and disturbed by those intrigues which it is, humanly speaking,\r\nimpossible wholly to prevent in courts, or indeed under any form of\r\ngovernment. However, with these aberrations, he gave himself over to a\r\nsuccession of the statesmen of public opinion. In other things he\r\nthought that he might be a king on the terms of his predecessors. He was\r\nconscious of the purity of his heart and the general good tendency of\r\nhis government. He flattered himself, as most men in his situation will,\r\nthat he might consult his ease without danger to his safety. It is not\r\nat all wonderful that both he and his ministers, giving way abundantly\r\nin other respects to innovation, should take up in policy with the\r\ntradition of their monarchy. Under his ancestors, the monarchy had\r\nsubsisted, and even been strengthened, by the generation or support of\r\nrepublics. First, the Swiss republics grew under the guardianship of the\r\nFrench monarchy. The Dutch republics were hatched and cherished under\r\nthe same incubation. Afterwards, a republican constitution was, under\r\nthe influence of France, established in the Empire, against the\r\npretensions of its chief. Even whilst the monarchy of France, by a\r\nseries of wars and negotiations, and lastly by the Treaties of\r\nWestphalia, had obtained the establishment of the Protestants in Germany\r\nas a law of the Empire, the same monarchy under Louis the Thirteenth had\r\nforce enough to destroy the republican system of the Protestants at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nLouis the Sixteenth was a diligent reader of history. But the very lamp\r\nof prudence blinded him. The guide of human life led him astray. A\r\nsilent revolution in the moral world preceded the political, and\r\nprepared it. It became of more importance than ever what examples were\r\ngiven, and what measures wore adopted. Their causes no longer lurked in\r\nthe recesses of cabinets or in the private conspiracies of the factious.\r\nThey were no longer to be controlled by the force and influence of the\r\ngrandees, who formerly had been able to stir up troubles by their\r\ndiscontents and to quiet them by their corruption. The chain of\r\nsubordination, even in cabal and sedition, was broken in its most\r\nimportant links. It was no longer the great and the populace. Other\r\ninterests were formed, other dependencies, other connections, other\r\ncommunications. The middle classes had swelled far beyond their former\r\nproportion. Like whatever is the most effectively rich and great in\r\nsociety, these classes became the seat of all the active politics, and\r\nthe preponderating weight to decide on them. There were all the energies\r\nby which fortune is acquired; there the consequence of their success.\r\nThere were all the talents which assert their pretensions, and are\r\nimpatient of the place which settled society prescribes to them. These\r\ndescriptions had got between the great and the populace; and the\r\ninfluence on the lower classes was with them. The spirit of ambition had\r\ntaken possession of this class as violently as ever it had done of any\r\nother. They felt the importance of this situation. The correspondence of\r\nthe moneyed and the mercantile world, the literary intercourse of\r\nacademies, but above all, the press, of which they had in a manner\r\nentire possession, made a kind of electric communication everywhere. The\r\npress, in reality, has made every government, in its spirit, almost\r\ndemocratic. Without the great, the first movements in this revolution\r\ncould not, perhaps, have been given. But the spirit of ambition, now for\r\nthe first time connected with the spirit of speculation, was not to be\r\nrestrained at will. There was no longer any means of arresting a\r\nprinciple in its course. When Louis the Sixteenth, under the influence\r\nof the enemies to monarchy, meant to found but one republic, he set up\r\ntwo; when he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbor, he lost\r\nthe whole of his own. Louis the Sixteenth could not with impunity\r\ncountenance a new republic. Yet between his throne and that dangerous\r\nlodgment for an enemy, which he had erected, he had the whole Atlantic\r\nfor a ditch. He had for an outwork the English nation itself, friendly\r\nto liberty, adverse to that mode of it. He was surrounded by a rampart\r\nof monarchies, most of them allied to him, and generally under his\r\ninfluence. Yet even thus secured, a republic erected under his auspices,\r\nand dependent on his power, became fatal to his throne. The very money\r\nwhich he had lent to support this republic, by a good faith which to him\r\noperated as perfidy, was punctually paid to his enemies, and became a\r\nresource in the hands of his assassins.\r\n\r\nWith this example before their eyes, do any ministers in England, do any\r\nministers in Austria, really flatter themselves that they can erect, not\r\non the remote shores of the Atlantic, but in their view, in their\r\nvicinity, in absolute contact with one of them, not a commercial, but a\r\nmartial republic,--a republic not of simple husbandmen or fishermen, but\r\nof intriguers, and of warriors,--a republic of a character the most\r\nrestless, the most enterprising, the most impious, the most fierce and\r\nbloody, the most hypocritical and perfidious, the most bold and daring,\r\nthat ever has been seen, or indeed that can be conceived to exist,\r\nwithout bringing on their own certain ruin?\r\n\r\nSuch is the republic to which we are going to give a place in civilized\r\nfellowship,--the republic which, with joint consent, we are going to\r\nestablish in the centre of Europe, in a post that overlooks and\r\ncommands every other state, and which eminently confronts and menaces\r\nthis kingdom.\r\n\r\nYou cannot fail to observe that I speak as if the allied powers were\r\nactually consenting, and not compelled by events, to the establishment\r\nof this faction in France. The words have not escaped me. You will\r\nhereafter naturally expect that I should make them good. But whether in\r\nadopting this measure we are madly active or weakly passive or\r\npusillanimously panic-struck, the effects will be the same. You may call\r\nthis faction, which has eradicated the monarchy, expelled the\r\nproprietary, persecuted religion, and trampled upon law,[36]--you may\r\ncall this Prance, if you please; but of the ancient France nothing\r\nremains but its central geography, its iron frontier, its spirit of\r\nambition, its audacity of enterprise, its perplexing intrigue. These,\r\nand these alone, remain: and they remain heightened in their principle\r\nand augmented in their means. All the former correctives, whether of\r\nvirtue or of weakness, which existed in the old monarchy, are gone. No\r\nsingle new corrective is to be found in the whole body of the new\r\ninstitutions. How should such a thing be found there, when everything\r\nhas been chosen with care and selection to forward all those ambitious\r\ndesigns and dispositions, not to control them? The whole is a body of\r\nways and means for the supply of dominion, without one heterogeneous\r\nparticle in it.\r\n\r\nHere I suffer you to breathe, and leave to your meditation what has\r\noccurred to me on the _genius and character_ of the French Revolution.\r\nFrom having this before us, we may be better able to determine on the\r\nfirst question I proposed,--that is, How far nations called foreign are\r\nlikely to be affected with the system established within that territory.\r\nI intended to proceed next on the question of her facilities, _from the\r\ninternal state of other nations, and particularly of this_, for\r\nobtaining her ends; but I ought to be aware that my notions are\r\ncontroverted. I mean, therefore, in my next letter, to take notice of\r\nwhat in that way has been recommended to me as the most deserving of\r\nnotice. In the examination of those pieces, I shall have occasion to\r\ndiscuss some others of the topics to which I have called your attention.\r\nYou know that the letters which I now send to the press, as well as a\r\npart of what is to follow, have been in their substance long since\r\nwritten. A circumstance which your partiality alone could make of\r\nimportance to you, but which to the public is of no importance at all,\r\nretarded their appearance. The late events which press upon us obliged\r\nme to make some additions, but no substantial change in the matter.\r\n\r\nThis discussion, my friend, will be long. But the matter is serious; and\r\nif ever the fate of the world could be truly said to depend on a\r\nparticular measure, it is upon this peace. For the present, farewell.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] See Declaration, Whitehall, Oct. 29, 1793.\r\n\r\n[35] It may be right to do justice to Louis the Sixteenth. He did what\r\nhe could to destroy the double diplomacy of France. He had all the\r\nsecret correspondence burnt, except one piece, which was called\r\n_Conjectures raisonnées sur la Situation actuelle de la France dans le\r\nSystème Politique de l'Europe_: a work executed by M. Favier, under the\r\ndirection of Count Broglie. A single copy of this was said to have been\r\nfound in the cabinet of Louis the Sixteenth. It was published with some\r\nsubsequent state-papers of Vergennes, Turgot, and others, as \"a new\r\nbenefit of the Revolution,\" and the advertisement to the publication\r\nends with the following words: \"_Il sera facile de se convaincre_, QU'Y\r\nCOMPRIS MÊME LA RÉVOLUTION, _en grande partie_, ON TROUVE DANS CES\r\n_MEMOIRES_ ET CES _CONJECTURES_ LE GERME DE TOUT CE QUI ARRIVE\r\nAUJOURD'HUI, _et qu'on ne peut, sans les avoir lus, être bien au fait\r\ndes intérêts, et même des vues actuelles des diverses puissances de\r\nl'Europe_.\" The book is entitled _Politique de tous les Cabinets de\r\nl'Europe pendant la Règnes de Louis XV. et de Louis XVI_. It is\r\naltogether very curious, and worth reading.\r\n\r\n[36] See our Declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nON THE RUPTURE OF THE NEGOTIATION; THE TERMS OF PEACE PROPOSED; AND THE\r\nRESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir,--I thank you for the bundle of state-papers which I received\r\nyesterday. I have travelled through the negotiation,--and a sad,\r\nfounderous road it is. There is a sort of standing jest against my\r\ncountrymen,--that one of them on his journey having found a piece of\r\npleasant road, he proposed to his companion to go over it again. This\r\nproposal, with regard to the worthy traveller's final destination, was\r\ncertainly a blunder. It was no blunder as to his immediate satisfaction;\r\nfor the way was pleasant. In the irksome journey of the Regicide\r\nnegotiations it is otherwise: our \"paths are not paths of pleasantness,\r\nnor our ways the ways to peace.\" All our mistakes, (if such they are,)\r\nlike those of our Hibernian traveller, are mistakes of repetition; and\r\nthey will be full as far from bringing us to our place of rest as his\r\nwell-considered project was from forwarding him to his inn. Yet I see we\r\npersevere. Fatigued with our former course, too listless to explore a\r\nnew one, kept in action by inertness, moving only because we have been\r\nin motion, with a sort of plodding perseverance we resolve to measure\r\nback again the very same joyless, hopeless, and inglorious track.\r\nBackward and forward,--oscillation, space,--the travels of a postilion,\r\nmiles enough to circle the globe in one short stage,--we have been, and\r\nwe are yet to be, jolted and rattled over the loose, misplaced stones\r\nand the treacherous hollows of this rough, ill-kept, broken-up,\r\ntreacherous French causeway!\r\n\r\nThe Declaration which brings up the rear of the papers laid before\r\nParliament contains a review and a reasoned summary of all our attempts\r\nand all our failures,--a concise, but correct narrative of the painful\r\nsteps taken to bring on the essay of a treaty at Paris,--a clear\r\nexposure of all the rebuffs we received in the progress of that\r\nexperiment,--an honest confession of our departure from all the rules\r\nand all the principles of political negotiation, and of common prudence\r\nin the conduct of it,--and to crown the whole, a fair account of the\r\natrocious manner in which the Regicide enemies had broken up what had\r\nbeen so inauspiciously begun and so feebly carried on, by finally, and\r\nwith all scorn, driving our suppliant ambassador out of the limits of\r\ntheir usurpation.\r\n\r\nEven after all that I have lately seen, I was a little surprised at this\r\nexposure. A minute display of hopes formed without foundation and of\r\nlabors pursued without fruit is a thing not very flattering to\r\nself-estimation. But truth has its rights, and it will assert them. The\r\nDeclaration, after doing all this with a mortifying candor, concludes\r\nthe whole recapitulation with an engagement still more extraordinary\r\nthan all the unusual matter it contains. It says that \"His Majesty, who\r\nhad entered into the negotiation with _good faith_, who had suffered\r\n_no_ impediment to prevent his prosecuting it with _earnestness and\r\nsincerity_, has now _only to lament_ its abrupt termination, and to\r\nrenew _in the face of all Europe the solemn declaration_, that, whenever\r\nhis enemies shall be _disposed_ to enter on the work of general\r\npacification in a spirit of conciliation and equity, nothing shall be\r\nwanting on his part to contribute to the accomplishment of that great\r\nobject.\"\r\n\r\nIf the disgusting detail of the accumulated insults we have received, in\r\nwhat we have very properly called our \"solicitation\" to a gang of felons\r\nand murderers, had been produced as a proof of the utter inefficacy of\r\nthat mode of proceeding with that description of persons, I should have\r\nnothing at all to object to it. It might furnish matter conclusive in\r\nargument and instructive in policy; but, with all due submission to high\r\nauthority, and with all decent deference to superior lights, it does not\r\nseem quite clear to a discernment no better than mine that the premises\r\nin that piece conduct irresistibly to the conclusion. A labored display\r\nof the ill consequences which have attended an uniform course of\r\nsubmission to every mode of contumelious insult, with which the\r\ndespotism of a proud, capricious, insulting, and implacable foe has\r\nchosen to buffet our patience, does not appear to my poor thoughts to be\r\nproperly brought forth as a preliminary to justify a resolution of\r\npersevering in the very same kind of conduct, towards the very same sort\r\nof person, and on the very same principles. We state our experience, and\r\nthen we come to the manly resolution of acting in contradiction to it.\r\nAll that has passed at Paris, to the moment of our being shamefully\r\nhissed off that stage, has been nothing but a more solemn representation\r\non the theatre of the nation of what had been before in rehearsal at\r\nBasle. As it is not only confessed by us, but made a matter of charge on\r\nthe enemy, that he had given us no encouragement to believe there was a\r\nchange in his disposition or in his policy at any time subsequent to the\r\nperiod of his rejecting our first overtures, there seems to have been no\r\nassignable motive for sending Lord Malmesbury to Paris, except to expose\r\nhis humbled country to the worst indignities, and the first of the kind,\r\nas the Declaration very truly observes, that have been known in the\r\nworld of negotiation.\r\n\r\nAn honest neighbor of mine is not altogether unhappy in the application\r\nof an old common story to a present occasion. It may be said of my\r\nfriend, what Horace says of a neighbor of his, \"_Garrit aniles ex re\r\nfabellas_.\" Conversing on this strange subject, he told me a current\r\nstory of a simple English country squire, who was persuaded by certain\r\n_dilettanti_ of his acquaintance to see the world, and to become knowing\r\nin men and manners. Among other celebrated places, it was recommended to\r\nhim to visit Constantinople. He took their advice. After various\r\nadventures, not to our purpose to dwell upon, he happily arrived at that\r\nfamous city. As soon as he had a little reposed himself from his\r\nfatigue, he took a walk into the streets; but he had not gone far,\r\nbefore \"a malignant and a turbaned Turk\" had his choler roused by the\r\ncareless and assured air with which this infidel strutted about in the\r\nmetropolis of true believers. In this temper he lost no time in doing to\r\nour traveller the honors of the place. The Turk crossed over the way,\r\nand with perfect good-will gave him two or three lusty kicks on the seat\r\nof honor. To resent or to return the compliment in Turkey was quite out\r\nof the question. Our traveller, since he could not otherwise acknowledge\r\nthis kind of favor, received it with the best grace in the world: he\r\nmade one of his most ceremonious bows, and begged the kicking Mussulman\r\n\"to accept his perfect assurances of high consideration.\" Our countryman\r\nwas too wise to imitate Othello in the use of the dagger. He thought it\r\nbetter, as better it was, to assuage his bruised dignity with half a\r\nyard square of balmy diplomatic diachylon. In the disasters of their\r\nfriends, people are seldom wanting in a laudable patience. When they\r\nare such as do not threaten to end fatally, they become even matter of\r\npleasantry. The English fellow-travellers of our sufferer, finding him a\r\nlittle out of spirits, entreated him not to take so slight a business so\r\nvery seriously. They told him it was the custom of the country; that\r\nevery country had its customs; that the Turkish manners were a little\r\nrough, but that in the main the Turks were a good-natured people; that\r\nwhat would have been a deadly affront anywhere else was only a little\r\nfreedom there: in short, they told him to think no more of the matter,\r\nand to try his fortune in another promenade. But the squire, though a\r\nlittle clownish, had some home-bred sense. \"What! have I come, at all\r\nthis expense and trouble, all the way to Constantinople only to be\r\nkicked? Without going beyond my own stable, my groom, for half a crown,\r\nwould have kicked me to my heart's content. I don't mean to stay in\r\nConstantinople eight-and-forty hours, nor ever to return to this rough,\r\ngood-natured people, that have their own customs.\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the squire was in the right. He was satisfied with his\r\nfirst ramble and his first injuries. But reason of state and common\r\nsense are two things. If it were not for this difference, it might not\r\nappear of absolute necessity, after having received a certain quantity\r\nof buffetings by advance, that we should send a peer of the realm to the\r\nscum of the earth to collect the debt to the last farthing, and to\r\nreceive, with infinite aggravation, the same scorns which had been paid\r\nto our supplication through a commoner: but it was proper, I suppose,\r\nthat the whole of our country, in all its orders, should have a share of\r\nthe indignity, and, as in reason, that the higher orders should touch\r\nthe larger proportion.\r\n\r\nThis business was not ended because our dignity was wounded, or because\r\nour patience was worn out with contumely and scorn. We had not disgorged\r\none particle of the nauseous doses with which we were so liberally\r\ncrammed by the mountebanks of Paris in order to drug and diet us into\r\nperfect tameness. No,--we waited till the morbid strength of our\r\n_boulimia_ for their physic had exhausted the well-stored dispensary of\r\ntheir empiricism. It is impossible to guess at the term to which our\r\nforbearance would have extended. The Regicides were more fatigued with\r\ngiving blows than the callous cheek of British diplomacy was hurt in\r\nreceiving them. They had no way left for getting rid of this mendicant\r\nperseverance, but by sending for the beadle, and forcibly driving our\r\nembassy \"of shreds and patches,\" with all its mumping cant, from the\r\ninhospitable door of Cannibal Castle,--\r\n\r\n    \"Where the gaunt mastiff, growling at the gate,\r\n    Affrights the beggar whom he longs to eat,\"\r\n\r\nI think we might have found, before the rude hand of insolent office was\r\non our shoulder, and the staff of usurped authority brandished over our\r\nheads, that contempt of the suppliant is not the best forwarder of a\r\nsuit,--that national disgrace is not the high-road to security, much\r\nless to power and greatness. Patience, indeed, strongly indicates the\r\nlore of peace; but mere love does not always lead to enjoyment. It is\r\nthe power of winning that palm which insures our wearing it. Virtues\r\nhave their place; and out of their place they hardly deserve the\r\nname,--they pass into the neighboring vice. The patience of fortitude\r\nand the endurance of pusillanimity are things very different, as in\r\ntheir principle, so in their effects.\r\n\r\nIn truth, this Declaration, containing a narrative of the first\r\ntransaction of the kind (and I hope it will be the last) in the\r\nintercourse of nations, as a composition, is ably drawn. It does credit\r\nto our official style. The report of the speech of the minister in a\r\ngreat assembly, which I have read, is a comment upon the Declaration.\r\nWithout inquiry how far that report is exact, (inferior I believe it may\r\nbe to what it would represent,) yet still it reads as a most eloquent\r\nand finished performance. Hardly one galling circumstance of the\r\nindignities offered by the Directory of Regicide to the supplications\r\nmade to that junto in his Majesty's name has been spared. Every one of\r\nthe aggravations attendant on these acts of outrage is, with wonderful\r\nperspicuity and order, brought forward in its place, and in the manner\r\nmost fitted to produce its effect. They are turned to every point of\r\nview in which they can be seen to the best advantage. All the parts are\r\nso arranged as to point out their relation, and to furnish a true idea\r\nof the spirit of the whole transaction.\r\n\r\nThis speech may stand for a model. Never, for the triumphal decoration\r\nof any theatre, not for the decoration of those of Athens and Rome, or\r\neven of this theatre of Paris, from the embroideries of Babylon or from\r\nthe loom of the Gobelins, has there been sent any historic tissue so\r\ntruly drawn, so closely and so finely wrought, or in which the forms are\r\nbrought out in the rich purple of such glowing and blushing colors. It\r\nputs me in mind of the piece of tapestry with which Virgil proposed to\r\nadorn the theatre he was to erect to Augustus upon the banks of the\r\nMincio, who now hides his head in his reeds, and leads his slow and\r\nmelancholy windings through banks wasted by the barbarians of Gaul. He\r\nsupposes that the artifice is such, that the figures of the conquered\r\nnations in his tapestry are made to play their part, and are confounded\r\nin the machine,--\r\n\r\n                                     utque\r\n    Purpurea intexti tollant aulæa Britanni;\r\n\r\nor, as Dryden translates it, somewhat paraphrastically, but not less in\r\nthe spirit of the prophet than of the poet,--\r\n\r\n    \"Where the proud theatres disclose the scene,\r\n    Which interwoven Britons seem to raise,\r\n    And show the triumph which their shame displays.\"\r\n\r\nIt is something wonderful, that the sagacity shown in the Declaration\r\nand the speech (and, so far as it goes, greater was never shown) should\r\nhave failed to discover to the writer and to the speaker the inseparable\r\nrelation between the parties to this transaction, and that nothing can\r\nbe said to display the imperious arrogance of a base enemy which does\r\nnot describe with equal force and equal truth the contemptible figure of\r\nan abject embassy to that imperious power.\r\n\r\nIt is no less striking, that the same obvious reflection should not\r\noccur to those gentlemen who conducted the opposition to government. But\r\ntheir thoughts were turned another way. They seem to have been so\r\nentirely occupied with the defence of the French Directory, so very\r\neager in finding recriminatory; precedents to justify every act of its\r\nintolerable insolence, so animated in their accusations of ministry for\r\nnot having at the very outset made concessions proportioned to the\r\ndignity of the great victorious power we had offended, that everything\r\nconcerning the sacrifice in this business of national honor, and of the\r\nmost fundamental principles in the policy of negotiation, seemed wholly\r\nto have escaped them. To this fatal hour, the contention in Parliament\r\nappeared in another form, and was animated by another spirit. For three\r\nhundred years and more, we have had wars with what stood as government\r\nin France. In all that period, the language of ministers, whether of\r\nboast or of apology, was, that they had left nothing undone for the\r\nassertion of the national honor,--the opposition, whether patriotically\r\nor factiously, contending that the ministers had been oblivious of the\r\nnational glory, and had made improper sacrifices of that public interest\r\nwhich they were bound not only to preserve, but by all fair methods to\r\naugment. This total change of tone on both sides of your House forms\r\nitself no inconsiderable revolution; and I am afraid it prognosticates\r\nothers of still greater importance. The ministers exhausted the stores\r\nof their eloquence in demonstrating that they had quitted the safe,\r\nbeaten highway of treaty between independent powers,--that, to pacify\r\nthe enemy, they had made every sacrifice of the national dignity,--and\r\nthat they had offered to immolate at the same shrine the most valuable\r\nof the national acquisitions. The opposition insisted that the victims\r\nwere not fat nor fair enough to be offered on the altars of blasphemed\r\nRegicide; and it was inferred from thence, that the sacrifical\r\nministers, (who were a sort of intruders in the worship of the new\r\ndivinity,) in their schismatical devotion, had discovered more of\r\nhypocrisy than zeal. They charged them with a concealed resolution to\r\npersevere in what these gentlemen have (in perfect consistency, indeed,\r\nwith themselves, but most irreconcilably with fact and reason) called an\r\nunjust and impolitic war.\r\n\r\nThat day was, I fear, the fatal term of _local_ patriotism. On that day,\r\nI fear, there was an end of that narrow scheme of relations called our\r\ncountry, with all its pride, its prejudices, and its partial affections.\r\nAll the little quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but\r\nnot an unfruitful field, are to be lost in the waste expanse, and\r\nboundless, barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no\r\nlonger an object of terror, the aggrandizement of a new power which\r\nteaches as a professor that philanthropy in the chair, whilst it\r\npropagates by arms and establishes by conquest the comprehensive system\r\nof universal fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great\r\nassembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any\r\napprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the\r\nclosest and most confidential connections with the metropolis of that\r\nfraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favorite\r\nsubject, the display of those horrors that must attend the existence of\r\na power with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of\r\nEurope. It is satisfied to find some loose, ambiguous expressions in\r\nits former declarations, which may set it free from its professions and\r\nengagements. It always speaks of peace with the Regicides as a great and\r\nan undoubted blessing, and such a blessing as, if obtained, promises, as\r\nmuch as any human disposition of things can promise, security and\r\npermanence. It holds out nothing at all definite towards this security.\r\nIt only seeks, by a restoration to some of their former owners of some\r\nfragments of the general wreck of Europe, to find a plausible plea for a\r\npresent retreat from an embarrassing position. As to the future, that\r\nparty is content to leave it covered in a night of the most palpable\r\nobscurity. It never once has entered into a particle of detail of what\r\nour own situation, or that of other powers, must be, under the blessings\r\nof the peace we seek. This defect, to my power, I mean to supply,--that,\r\nif any persons should still continue to think an attempt at foresight is\r\nany part of the duty of a statesman, I may contribute my trifle to the\r\nmaterials of his speculation.\r\n\r\nAs to the other party, the minority of to-day, possibly the majority of\r\nto-morrow, small in number, but full of talents and every species of\r\nenergy, which, upon the avowed ground of being more acceptable to\r\nFrance, is a candidate for the helm of this kingdom, it has never\r\nchanged from the beginning. It has preserved a perennial consistency.\r\nThis would be a never failing source of true glory, if springing from\r\njust and right; but it is truly dreadful, if it be an arm of Styx, which\r\nsprings out of the profoundest depths of a poisoned soil. The French\r\nmaxims were by these gentlemen at no time condemned. I speak of their\r\nlanguage in the most moderate terms. There are many who think that they\r\nhave gone much further,--that they have always magnified and extolled\r\nthe French maxims,--that; not in the least disgusted or discouraged by\r\nthe monstrous evils which have attended these maxims from the moment of\r\ntheir adoption both at home and abroad, they still continue to predict\r\nthat in due time they must produce the greatest good to the poor human\r\nrace. They obstinately persist in stating those evils as matter of\r\naccident, as things wholly collateral to the system.\r\n\r\nIt is observed, that this party has never spoken of an ally of Great\r\nBritain with the smallest degree of respect or regard: on the contrary,\r\nit has generally mentioned them under opprobrious appellations, and in\r\nsuch terms of contempt or execration as never had been heard\r\nbefore,--because no such would have formerly been permitted in our\r\npublic assemblies. The moment, however, that any of those allies quitted\r\nthis obnoxious connection, the party has instantly passed an act of\r\nindemnity and oblivion in their favor. After this, no sort of censure on\r\ntheir conduct, no imputation on their character. From that moment their\r\npardon was sealed in a reverential and mysterious silence. With the\r\ngentlemen of this minority, there is no ally, from one end of Europe to\r\nthe other, with whom we ought not to be ashamed to act. The whole\r\ncollege of the states of Europe is no better than a gang of tyrants.\r\nWith them all our connections were broken off at once. We ought to have\r\ncultivated France, and France alone, from the moment of her Revolution.\r\nOn that happy change, all our dread of that nation as a power was to\r\ncease. She became in an instant dear to our affections and one with our\r\ninterests. All other nations we ought to have commanded not to trouble\r\nher sacred throes, whilst in labor to bring into an happy birth her\r\nabundant litter of constitutions. We ought to have acted under her\r\nauspices, in extending her salutary influence upon every side. From that\r\nmoment England and France were become natural allies, and all the other\r\nstates natural enemies. The whole face of the world was changed. What\r\nwas it to us, if she acquired Holland and the Austrian Netherlands? By\r\nher conquests she only enlarged the sphere of her beneficence, she only\r\nextended the blessings of liberty to so many more foolishly reluctant\r\nnations. What was it to England, if, by adding these, among the richest\r\nand most peopled countries of the world, to her territories, she thereby\r\nleft no possible link of communication between us and any other power\r\nwith whom we could act against her? On this new system of optimism, it\r\nis so much the better: so much the further are we removed from the\r\ncontact with infectious despotism. No longer a thought of a barrier in\r\nthe Netherlands to Holland against France. All that is obsolete policy.\r\nIt is fit that France should have both Holland and the Austrian\r\nNetherlands too, as a barrier to her against the attacks of despotism.\r\nShe cannot multiply her securities too much; and as to our security, it\r\nis to be found in hers. Had we cherished her from the beginning, and\r\nfelt for her when attacked, she, poor, good soul, would never have\r\ninvaded any foreign nation, never murdered her sovereign and his family,\r\nnever proscribed, never exiled, never imprisoned, never been guilty of\r\nextra-judicial massacre or of legal murder. All would have been a golden\r\nage, full of peace, order, and liberty,--and philosophy, raying out from\r\nEurope, would have warmed and enlightened the universe; but, unluckily,\r\nirritable philosophy, the most irritable of all things, was pat into a\r\npassion, and provoked into ambition abroad and tyranny at home. They\r\nfind all this very natural and very justifiable. They choose to forget\r\nthat other nations, struggling for freedom, have been attacked by their\r\nneighbors, or that their neighbors have otherwise interfered in their\r\naffairs. Often have neighbors interfered in favor of princes against\r\ntheir rebellious subjects, and often in favor of subjects against their\r\nprince. Such cases fill half the pages of history; yet never were they\r\nused as an apology, much less as a justification, for atrocious cruelty\r\nin princes, or for general massacre and confiscation on the part of\r\nrevolted subjects,--never as a politic cause for suffering any such\r\npowers to aggrandize themselves without limit and without measure. A\r\nthousand times have we seen it asserted in public prints and pamphlets,\r\nthat, if the nobility and priesthood of France had stayed at home, their\r\nproperty never would have been confiscated. One would think that none of\r\nthe clergy had been robbed previous to their deportation, or that their\r\ndeportation had, on their part, been a voluntary act. One would think\r\nthat the nobility and gentry, and merchants and bankers, who stayed at\r\nhome, had enjoyed their property in security and repose. The assertors\r\nof these positions well know that the lot of thousands who remained at\r\nhome was far more terrible, that the most cruel imprisonment was only a\r\nharbinger of a cruel and ignominious death, and that in this mother\r\ncountry of freedom there were no less than _three hundred thousand_ at\r\none time in prison. I go no further. I instance only these\r\nrepresentations of the party, as staring indications of partiality to\r\nthat sect to whose dominion they would have left this country nothing to\r\noppose but her own naked force, and consequently subjected us, on every\r\nreverse of fortune, to the imminent danger of falling under those very\r\nevils, in that very system, which are attributed, not to its own nature,\r\nbut to the perverseness of others. There is nothing in the world so\r\ndifficult as to put men in a state of judicial neutrality. A leaning\r\nthere must ever be, and it is of the first importance to any nation to\r\nobserve to what side that leaning inclines,--whether to our own\r\ncommunity, or to one with which it is in a state of hostility.\r\n\r\nMen are rarely without some sympathy in the sufferings of others; but in\r\nthe immense and diversified mass of human misery, which may be pitied,\r\nbut cannot be relieved, in the gross, the mind must make a choice. Our\r\nsympathy is always more forcibly attracted towards the misfortunes of\r\ncertain persons, and in certain descriptions: and this sympathetic\r\nattraction discovers, beyond a possibility of mistake, our mental\r\naffinities and elective affections. It is a much surer proof than the\r\nstrongest declaration of a real connection and of an overruling bias in\r\nthe mind. I am told that the active sympathies of this party have been\r\nchiefly, if not wholly, attracted to the sufferings of the patriarchal\r\nrebels who were amongst the promulgators of the maxims of the French\r\nRevolution, and who have suffered from their apt and forward scholars\r\nsome part of the evils which they had themselves so liberally\r\ndistributed to all the other parts of the community. Some of these men,\r\nflying from the knives which they had sharpened against their country\r\nand its laws, rebelling against the very powers they had set over\r\nthemselves by their rebellion against their sovereign, given up by those\r\nvery armies to whose faithful attachment they trusted for their safety\r\nand support, after they had completely debauched all military fidelity\r\nin its source,--some of these men, I say, had fallen into the hands of\r\nthe head of that family the most illustrious person of which they had\r\nthree times cruelly imprisoned, and delivered in that state of captivity\r\nto those hands from which they were able to relieve neither her, nor\r\ntheir own nearest and most venerable kindred. One of these men,\r\nconnected with this country by no circumstance of birth,--not related to\r\nany distinguished families here,--recommended by no service,--endeared\r\nto this nation by no act or even expression of kindness,--comprehended\r\nin no league or common cause,--embraced by no laws of public\r\nhospitality,--this man was the only one to be found in Europe, in whose\r\nfavor the British nation, passing judgment without hearing on its almost\r\nonly ally, was to force (and that not by soothing interposition, but\r\nwith every reproach for inhumanity, cruelty, and breach of the laws of\r\nwar) from prison. We were to release him from that prison out of which,\r\nin abuse of the lenity of government amidst its rigor, and in violation\r\nof at least an understood parole, he had attempted an escape,--an escape\r\nexcusable, if you will, but naturally productive of strict and vigilant\r\nconfinement. The earnestness of gentlemen to free this person was the\r\nmore extraordinary because there was full as little in him to raise\r\nadmiration, from any eminent qualities he possessed, as there was to\r\nexcite an interest, from any that were amiable. A person not only of no\r\nreal civil or literary talents, but of no specious appearance of\r\neither,--and in his military profession not marked as a leader in any\r\none act of able or successful enterprise, unless his leading on (or his\r\nfollowing) the allied army of Amazonian and male cannibal Parisians to\r\nVersailles, on the famous 6th of October, 1789, is to make his glory.\r\nAny otter exploit of his, as a general, I never heard of. But the\r\ntriumph of general fraternity was but the more signalized by the total\r\nwant of particular claims in that case,--and by postponing all such\r\nclaims in a case where they really existed, where they stood embossed,\r\nand in a manner forced themselves on the view of common, shortsighted\r\nbenevolence. Whilst, for its improvement, the humanity of these\r\ngentlemen was thus on its travels, and had got as far off as Olmütz,\r\nthey never thought of a place and a person much nearer to them, or of\r\nmoving an instruction to Lord Malmesbury in favor of their own suffering\r\ncountryman, Sir Sydney Smith.\r\n\r\nThis officer, having attempted, with great gallantry, to cut out a\r\nvessel from one of the enemy's harbors, was taken after an obstinate\r\nresistance,--such as obtained him the marked respect of those who were\r\nwitnesses of his valor, and knew the circumstances in which it was\r\ndisplayed. Upon his arrival at Paris, he was instantly thrown into\r\nprison, where the nature of his situation will best be understood by\r\nknowing that amongst its _mitigations_ was the permission to walk\r\noccasionally in the court and to enjoy the privilege of shaving himself.\r\nOn the old system of feelings and principles, his sufferings might have\r\nbeen entitled to consideration, and, even in a comparison with those of\r\nCitizen La Fayette, to a priority in the order of compassion. If the\r\nministers had neglected to take any steps in his favor, a declaration of\r\nthe sense of the House of Commons would have stimulated them to their\r\nduty. If they had caused a representation to be made, such a proceeding\r\nwould have added force to it. If reprisal should be thought advisable,\r\nthe address of the House would have given an additional sanction to a\r\nmeasure which would have been, indeed, justifiable without any other\r\nsanction than its own reason. But no. Nothing at all like it. In fact,\r\nthe merit of Sir Sydney Smith, and his claim on British compassion, was\r\nof a kind altogether different from that which interested so deeply the\r\nauthors of the motion in favor of Citizen La Fayette. In my humble\r\nopinion, Captain Sir Sydney Smith has another sort of merit with the\r\nBritish nation, and something of a higher claim on British humanity,\r\nthan Citizen La Fayette. Faithful, zealous, and ardent in the service of\r\nhis king and country,--full of spirit,--full of resources,--going out of\r\nthe beaten road, but going right, because his uncommon enterprise was\r\nnot conducted by a vulgar judgment,--in his profession Sir Sydney Smith\r\nmight be considered as a distinguished person, if any person could well\r\nbe distinguished in a service in which scarce a commander can be named\r\nwithout putting you in mind of some action of intrepidity, skill, and\r\nvigilance that has given them a fair title to contend with any men and\r\nin any age. But I will say nothing farther of the merits of Sir Sydney\r\nSmith: the mortal animosity of the Regicide enemy supersedes all other\r\npanegyric. Their hatred is a judgment in his favor without appeal. At\r\npresent he is lodged in the tower of the Temple, the last prison of\r\nLouis the Sixteenth, and the last but one of Marie Antoinette of\r\nAustria,--the prison of Louis the Seventeenth,--the prison of Elizabeth\r\nof Bourbon. There he lies, unpitied by the grand philanthropy, to\r\nmeditate upon the fate of those who are faithful to their king and\r\ncountry. Whilst this prisoner, secluded from intercourse, was indulging\r\nin these cheering reflections, he might possibly have had the further\r\nconsolation of learning (by means of the insolent exultation of his\r\nguards) that there was an English ambassador at Paris; he might have had\r\nthe proud comfort of hearing that this ambassador had the honor of\r\npassing his mornings in respectful attendance at the office of a\r\nRegicide pettifogger, and that in the evening he relaxed in the\r\namusements of the opera, and in the spectacle of an audience totally\r\nnew,--an audience in which he had the pleasure of seeing about him not a\r\nsingle face that he could formerly have known in Paris, but, in the\r\nplace of that company, one indeed more than equal to it in display of\r\ngayety, splendor, and luxury,--a set of abandoned wretches, squandering\r\nin insolent riot the spoils of their bleeding country: a subject of\r\nprofound reflection both to the prisoner and to the ambassador.\r\n\r\nWhether all the matter upon which I have grounded my opinion of this\r\nlast party be fully authenticated or not must be left to those who have\r\nhad the opportunity of a nearer view of its conduct, and who have been\r\nmore attentive in their perusal of the writings which have appeared in\r\nits favor. But for my part, I have never heard the gross facts on which\r\nI ground my idea of their marked partiality to the reigning tyranny in\r\nFrance in any part denied. I am not surprised at all this. Opinions, as\r\nthey sometimes follow, so they frequently guide and direct the\r\naffections; and men may become more attached to the country of their\r\nprinciples than to the country of their birth. What I have stated here\r\nis only to mark the spirit which seems to me, though in somewhat\r\ndifferent ways, to actuate our great party-leaders, and to trace this\r\nfirst pattern of a negotiation to its true source.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present state of our public councils. Well might I be\r\nashamed of what seems to be a censure of two great factions, with the\r\ntwo most eloquent men which this country ever saw at the head of them,\r\nif I had found that either of them could support their conduct by any\r\nexample in the history of their country. I should very much prefer their\r\njudgment to my own, if I were not obliged, by an infinitely\r\noverbalancing weight of authority, to prefer the collected wisdom, of\r\nages to the abilities of any two men living.--I return to the\r\nDeclaration, with which the history of the abortion of a treaty with the\r\nRegicides is closed.\r\n\r\nAfter such an elaborate display had been made of the injustice and\r\ninsolence of an enemy who seems to have been irritated by every one of\r\nthe means which had been commonly used with effect to soothe the rage of\r\nintemperate power, the natural result would be, that the scabbard in\r\nwhich we in vain attempted to plunge our sword should have been thrown\r\naway with scorn. It would have been natural, that, rising in the fulness\r\nof their might, insulted majesty, despised dignity, violated justice,\r\nrejected supplication, patience goaded into fury, would have poured out\r\nall the length of the reins upon all the wrath which they had so long\r\nrestrained. It might have been expected, that, emulous of the glory of\r\nthe youthful hero[37] in alliance with him, touched by the example of\r\nwhat one man well formed and well placed may do in the most desperate\r\nstate of affairs, convinced there is a courage of the cabinet full as\r\npowerful and far less vulgar than that of the field, our minister would\r\nhave changed the whole line of that unprosperous prudence which hitherto\r\nhad produced all the effects of the blindest temerity. If he found his\r\nsituation full of danger, (and I do not deny that it is perilous in the\r\nextreme,) he must feel that it is also full of glory, and that he is\r\nplaced on a stage than which no muse of fire that had ascended the\r\nhighest heaven of invention could imagine anything more awful and\r\naugust. It was hoped that in this swelling scene in which he moved, with\r\nsome of the first potentates of Europe for his fellow-actors, and with\r\nso many of the rest for the anxious spectators of a part which, as he\r\nplays it, determines forever their destiny and his own, like Ulysses in\r\nthe unravelling point of the epic story, he would have thrown off his\r\npatience and his rags together, and, stripped of unworthy disguises, he\r\nwould have stood forth in the form and in the attitude of an hero. On\r\nthat day it was thought he would have assumed the port of Mars; that he\r\nwould bid to be brought forth from their hideous kennel (where his\r\nscrupulous tenderness had too long immured them) those impatient dogs of\r\nwar whose fierce regards affright even the minister of vengeance that\r\nfeeds them; that he would let them loose, in famine, fever, plagues,\r\nand death, upon a guilty race, to whose frame, and to all whose habit,\r\norder, peace, religion, and virtue are alien and abhorrent. It was\r\nexpected that he would at last have thought of active and effectual war;\r\nthat he would no longer amuse the British lion in the chase of mice and\r\nrats; that he would no longer employ the whole naval power of Great\r\nBritain, once the terror of the world, to prey upon the miserable\r\nremains of a peddling commerce, which the enemy did not regard, and from\r\nwhich none could profit. It was expected that he would have reasserted\r\nthe justice of his cause; that he would have reanimated whatever\r\nremained to him of his allies, and endeavored to recover those whom\r\ntheir fears had led astray; that he would have rekindled the martial\r\nardor of his citizens; that he would have held out to them the example\r\nof their ancestry, the assertor of Europe, and the scourge of French\r\nambition; that he would have reminded them of a posterity, which, if\r\nthis nefarious robbery, under the fraudulent name and false color of a\r\ngovernment, should in full power be seated in the heart of Europe, must\r\nforever be consigned to vice, impiety, barbarism, and the most\r\nignominious slavery of body and mind. In so holy a cause it was presumed\r\nthat he would (as in the beginning of the war he did) have opened all\r\nthe temples, and with prayer, with fasting, and with supplication,\r\n(better directed than to the grim Moloch of Regicide in France,) have\r\ncalled upon us to raise that united cry which has: so often stormed\r\nheaven, and with a pious violence forced down blessings upon a repentant\r\npeople. It was hoped, that, when he had invoked upon his endeavors the\r\nfavorable regard of the Protector of the human race, it would be seen\r\nthat his menaces to the enemy and his prayers to the Almighty were not\r\nfollowed, but accompanied, with correspondent action. It was hoped that\r\nhis shrilling trumpet should be heard, not to announce a show, but to\r\nsound a charge.\r\n\r\nSuch a conclusion to such a declaration and such a speech would have\r\nbeen a thing of course,--so much a thing of course, that I will be bold\r\nto say, if in any ancient history, the Roman for instance, (supposing\r\nthat in Rome the matter of such a detail could have been furnished,) a\r\nconsul had gone through such a long train of proceedings, and that there\r\nwas a chasm in the manuscripts by which we had lost the conclusion of\r\nthe speech and the subsequent part of the narrative, all critics would\r\nagree that a Freinshemius would have been thought to have managed the\r\nsupplementary business of a continuator most unskillfully, and to have\r\nsupplied the hiatus most improbably, if he had not filled up the gaping\r\nspace in a manner somewhat similar (though better executed) to what I\r\nhave imagined. But too often different is rational conjecture from\r\nmelancholy fact. This exordium, as contrary to all the rules of rhetoric\r\nas to those more essential rules of policy which our situation would\r\ndictate, is intended as a prelude to a deadening and disheartening\r\nproposition; as if all that a minister had to fear in a war of his own\r\nconducting was, that the people should pursue it with too ardent a zeal.\r\nSuch a tone as I guessed the minister would have taken, I am very sure,\r\nis the true, unsuborned, unsophisticated language of genuine, natural\r\nfeeling, under the smart of patience exhausted and abused. Such a\r\nconduct as the facts stated in the Declaration gave room to expect is\r\nthat which true wisdom would have dictated under the impression of those\r\ngenuine feelings. Never was there a jar or discord between genuine\r\nsentiment and sound policy. Never, no, never, did Nature say one thing\r\nand Wisdom say another. Nor are sentiments of elevation in themselves\r\nturgid and unnatural. Nature is never more truly herself than in her\r\ngrandest forms. The Apollo of Belvedere (if the universal robber has yet\r\nleft him at Belvedere) is as much in Nature as any figure from the\r\npencil of Rembrandt or any clown in the rustic revels of Téniers.\r\nIndeed, it is when a great nation is in great difficulties that minds\r\nmust exalt themselves to the occasion, or all is lost. Strong passion\r\nunder the direction of a feeble reason feeds a low fever, which serves\r\nonly to destroy the body that entertains it. But vehement passion does\r\nnot always indicate an infirm judgment. It often accompanies, and\r\nactuates, and is even auxiliary to a powerful understanding; and when\r\nthey both conspire and act harmoniously, their force is great to destroy\r\ndisorder within and to repel injury from abroad. If ever there was a\r\ntime that calls on us for no vulgar conception of things, and for\r\nexertions in no vulgar strain, it is the awful hour that Providence has\r\nnow appointed to this nation. Every little measure is a great error, and\r\nevery great error will bring on no small ruin. Nothing can be directed\r\nabove the mark that we must aim at: everything below it is absolutely\r\nthrown away.\r\n\r\nExcept with the addition of the unheard-of insult offered to our\r\nambassador by his rude expulsion, we are never to forget that the point\r\non which the negotiation with De la Croix broke off was exactly that\r\nwhich had stifled in its cradle the negotiation we had attempted with\r\nBarthélemy. Each of these transactions concluded with a manifesto upon\r\nour part; but the last of our manifestoes very materially differed from\r\nthe first. The first Declaration stated, that \"_nothing was left_ but to\r\nprosecute a war _equally just and necessary_.\" In the second the justice\r\nand necessity of the war is dropped: the sentence importing that nothing\r\nwas left but the prosecution of such a war disappears also. Instead of\r\nthis resolution to prosecute the war, we sink into a whining lamentation\r\non the abrupt termination of the treaty. We have nothing left but the\r\nlast resource of female weakness, of helpless infancy, of doting\r\ndecrepitude,--wailing and lamentation. We cannot even utter a sentiment\r\nof vigor;--\"his Majesty has only to lament.\" A poor possession, to be\r\nleft to a great monarch! Mark the effect produced on our councils by\r\ncontinued insolence and inveterate hostility. We grow more malleable\r\nunder their blows. In reverential silence we smother the cause and\r\norigin of the war. On that fundamental article of faith we leave every\r\none to abound in his own sense. In the minister's speech, glossing on\r\nthe Declaration, it is indeed mentioned, but very feebly. The lines are\r\nso faintly drawn as hardly to be traced. They only make a part of our\r\n_consolation_ in the circumstances which we so dolefully lament. We rest\r\nour merits on the humility, the earnestness of solicitation, and the\r\nperfect good faith of those submissions which have been used to persuade\r\nour Regicide enemies to grant us some sort of peace. Not a word is said\r\nwhich might not have been full as well said, and much better too, if the\r\nBritish nation had appeared in the simple character of a penitent\r\nconvinced of his errors and offences, and offering, by penances, by\r\npilgrimages, and by all the modes of expiation ever devised by anxious,\r\nrestless guilt, to make all the atonement in his miserable power.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration ends, as I have before quoted it, with a solemn\r\nvoluntary pledge, the most full and the most solemn that ever was given,\r\nof our resolution (if so it may be called) to enter again into the very\r\nsame course. It requires nothing more of the Regicides than to famish\r\nsome sort of excuse, some sort of colorable pretest, for our renewing\r\nthe supplications of innocence at the feet of guilt. It leaves the\r\nmoment of negotiation, a most important moment, to the choice of the\r\nenemy. He is to regulate it according to the convenience of his affairs.\r\nHe is to bring it forward at that time when it may best serve to\r\nestablish his authority at home and to extend his power abroad, A\r\ndangerous assurance for this nation to give, whether it is broken or\r\nwhether it is kept. As all treaty was broken off, and broken off in the\r\nmanner we have seen, the field of future conduct ought to be reserved\r\nfree and unincumbered to our future discretion. As to the sort of\r\ncondition prefixed to the pledge, namely, \"that the enemy should be\r\ndisposed to enter into the work of general pacification with the spirit\r\nof reconciliation and equity,\" this phraseology cannot possibly be\r\nconsidered otherwise than as so many words thrown in to fill the\r\nsentence and to round it to the ear. We prefixed the same plausible\r\nconditions to any renewal of the negotiation, in our manifesto on the\r\nrejection of our proposals at Basle. We did not consider those\r\nconditions as binding. We opened a much more serious negotiation\r\nwithout any sort of regard to them; and there is no new negotiation\r\nwhich we can possibly open upon fewer indications of conciliation and\r\nequity than were to be discovered when we entered into our last at\r\nParis. Any of the slightest pretences, any of the most loose, formal,\r\nequivocating expressions, would justify us, under the peroration of this\r\npiece, in again sending the last or some other Lord Malmesbury to Paris.\r\n\r\nI hope I misunderstand this pledge,--or that we shall show no more\r\nregard to it than we have done to all the faith that we have plighted to\r\nvigor and resolution in our former Declaration. If I am to understand\r\nthe conclusion of the Declaration to be what unfortunately it seems to\r\nme, we make an engagement with the enemy, without any correspondent\r\nengagement on his side. We seem to have cut ourselves off from any\r\nbenefit which an intermediate state of things might furnish to enable us\r\ntotally to overturn that power, so little connected with moderation and\r\njustice. By holding out no hope, either to the justly discontented in\r\nFrance, or to any foreign power, and leaving the recommencement of all\r\ntreaty to this identical junto of assassins, we do in effect assure and\r\nguaranty to them the full possession of the rich fruits of their\r\nconfiscations, of their murders of men, women, and children, and of all\r\nthe multiplied, endless, nameless iniquities by which they have obtained\r\ntheir power. We guaranty to them the possession of a country, such and\r\nso situated as France, round, entire, immensely perhaps augmented.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" some will say, \"in this case we have only submitted to the\r\nnature of things.\" The nature of things is, I admit, a sturdy\r\nadversary. This might be alleged as a plea for our attempt at a treaty.\r\nBut what plea of that kind can be alleged, after the treaty was dead and\r\ngone, in favor of this posthumous Declaration? No necessity has driven\r\nus to _that_ pledge. It is without a counterpart even in expectation.\r\nAnd what can be stated to obviate the evil which that solitary\r\nengagement must produce on the understandings or the fears of men? I\r\nask, what have the Regicides promised you in return, in case _you_\r\nshould show what _they_ would call dispositions to conciliation and\r\nequity, whilst you are giving that pledge from the throne, and engaging\r\nParliament to counter-secure it? It is an awful consideration. It was on\r\nthe very day of the date of this wonderful pledge,[38] in which we\r\nassumed the Directorial government as lawful, and in which we engaged\r\nourselves to treat with them whenever they pleased,--it was on that very\r\nday the Regicide fleet was weighing anchor from one of your harbors,\r\nwhere it had remained four days in perfect quiet. These harbors of the\r\nBritish dominions are the ports of France. They are of no use but to\r\nprotect an enemy from your best allies, the storms of heaven and his own\r\nrashness. Had the West of Ireland been an unportuous coast, the French\r\nnaval power would have been undone. The enemy uses the moment for\r\nhostility, without the least regard to your future dispositions of\r\nequity and conciliation. They go out of what were once your harbors, and\r\nthey return to them at their pleasure. Eleven days they had the full use\r\nof Bantry Bay, and at length their fleet returns from their harbor of\r\nBantry to their harbor of Brest. Whilst you are invoking the propitious\r\nspirit of Regicide equity and conciliation, they answer you with an\r\nattack. They turn out the pacific bearer of your \"how do you dos,\" Lord\r\nMalmesbury; and they return your visit, and their \"thanks for your\r\nobliging inquiries,\" by their old practised assassin, Hoche. They come\r\nto attack--what? A town, a fort, a naval station? They come to attack\r\nyour king, your Constitution, and the very being of that Parliament\r\nwhich was holding out to them these pledges, together with the\r\nentireness of the empire, the laws, liberties, and properties of all the\r\npeople. We know that they meditated the very same invasion, and for the\r\nvery same purposes, upon this kingdom, and, had the coast been as\r\nopportune, would have effected it.\r\n\r\nWhilst _you_ are in vain torturing your invention to assure them of\r\n_your_ sincerity and good faith, they have left no doubt concerning\r\n_their_ good faith and _their_ sincerity towards those to whom they have\r\nengaged their honor. To their power they have been true to the only\r\npledge they have ever yet given to you, or to any of yours: I mean the\r\nsolemn engagement which they entered into with the deputation of\r\ntraitors who appeared at their bar, from England and from Ireland, in\r\n1792. They have been true and faithful to the engagement which they had\r\nmade more largely,--that is, their engagement to give effectual aid to\r\ninsurrection and treason, wherever they might appear in the world. We\r\nhave seen the British Declaration. This is the counter Declaration of\r\nthe Directory. This is the reciprocal pledge which Regicide amity gives\r\nto the conciliatory pledges of kings. But, thank God, such pledges\r\ncannot exist single. They have no counterpart; and if they had, the\r\nenemy's conduct cancels such declarations,--and, I trust, along with\r\nthem, cancels everything of mischief and dishonor that they contain.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing in this business which appears to be wholly\r\nunaccountable, or accountable on a supposition I dare not entertain for\r\na moment. I cannot help asking, Why all this pains to clear the British\r\nnation of ambition, perfidy, and the insatiate thirst of war? At what\r\nperiod of time was it that our country has deserved that load of infamy\r\nof which nothing but preternatural humiliation in language and conduct\r\ncan serve to clear us? If we have deserved this kind of evil fame from\r\nanything we have done in a state of prosperity, I am sure that it is not\r\nan abject conduct in adversity that can clear our reputation. Well is it\r\nknown that ambition can creep as well as soar. The pride of no person in\r\na flourishing condition is more justly to be dreaded than that of him\r\nwho is mean and cringing under a doubtful and unprosperous fortune. But\r\nit seems it was thought necessary to give some out-of-the-way proofs of\r\nour sincerity, as well as of our freedom from ambition. Is, then, fraud\r\nand falsehood become the distinctive character of Englishmen? Whenever\r\nyour enemy chooses to accuse you of perfidy and ill faith, will you put\r\nit into his power to throw you into the purgatory of self-humiliation?\r\nIs his charge equal to the finding of the grand jury of Europe, and\r\nsufficient to put you upon your trial? But on that trial I will defend\r\nthe English ministry. I am sorry that on some points I have, on the\r\nprinciples I have always opposed, so good a defence to make. They were\r\nnot the first to begin the war. They did not excite the general\r\nconfederacy in Europe, which was so properly formed on the alarm given\r\nby the Jacobinism of France. They did not begin with an hostile\r\naggression on the Regicides, or any of their allies. These parricides of\r\ntheir own country, disciplining themselves for foreign by domestic\r\nviolence, were the first to attack a power that was our ally by nature,\r\nby habit, and by the sanction of multiplied treaties. Is it not true\r\nthat they were the first to declare war upon this kingdom? Is every word\r\nin the declaration from Downing Street concerning their conduct, and\r\nconcerning ours and that of our allies, so obviously false that it is\r\nnecessary to give some new-invented proofs of our good faith in order to\r\nexpunge the memory of all this perfidy?\r\n\r\nWe know that over-laboring a point of this kind has the direct contrary\r\neffect from what we wish. We know that there is a legal presumption\r\nagainst men, _quando se nimis purgitant_; and if a charge of ambition is\r\nnot refuted by an affected humility, certainly the character of fraud\r\nand perfidy is still less to be washed away by indications of meanness.\r\nFraud and prevarication are servile vices. They sometimes grow out of\r\nthe necessities, always out of the habits, of slavish and degenerate\r\nspirits; and on the theatre of the world, it is not by assuming the mask\r\nof a Davus or a Geta that an actor will obtain credit for manly\r\nsimplicity and a liberal openness of proceeding. It is an erect\r\ncountenance, it is a firm adherence to principle, it is a power of\r\nresisting false shame and frivolous fear, that assert our good faith and\r\nhonor, and assure to us the confidence of mankind. Therefore all these\r\nnegotiations, and all the declarations with which they were preceded and\r\nfollowed, can only serve to raise presumptions against that good faith\r\nand public integrity the fame of which to preserve inviolate is so much\r\nthe interest and duty of every nation.\r\n\r\nThe pledge is an engagement \"to all Europe.\" This is the more\r\nextraordinary, because it is a pledge which no power in Europe, whom I\r\nhave yet heard of, has thought proper to require at our hands. I am not\r\nin the secrets of office, and therefore I may be excused for proceeding\r\nupon probabilities and exterior indications. I have surveyed all Europe\r\nfrom the east to the west, from the north to the south, in search of\r\nthis call upon us to purge ourselves of \"subtle _duplicity_ and a\r\n_Punic_ style\" in our proceedings. I have not heard that his Excellency\r\nthe Ottoman ambassador has expressed his doubts of the British sincerity\r\nin our negotiation with the most unchristian republic lately set up at\r\nour door. What sympathy in that quarter may have introduced a\r\nremonstrance upon the want of faith in this nation I cannot positively\r\nsay. If it exists, it is in Turkish or Arabic, and possibly is not yet\r\ntranslated. But none of the nations which compose the old Christian\r\nworld have I yet heard as calling upon us for those judicial purgations\r\nand ordeals, by fire and water, which we have chosen to go through;--for\r\nthe other great proof, by battle, we seem to decline.\r\n\r\nFor whose use, entertainment, or instruction are all those overstrained\r\nand overlabored proceedings in council, in negotiation, and in speeches\r\nin Parliament intended? What royal cabinet is to be enriched with these\r\nhigh-finished pictures of the arrogance of the sworn enemies of kings\r\nand the meek patience of a British administration? In what heart is it\r\nintended to kindle pity towards our multiplied mortifications and\r\ndisgraces? At best it is superfluous. What nation is unacquainted with\r\nthe haughty disposition of the common enemy of all nations? It has been\r\nmore than seen, it has been felt,--not only by those who have been the\r\nvictims of their imperious rapacity, but, in a degree, by those very\r\npowers who have consented to establish this robbery, that they might be\r\nable to copy it, and with impunity to make new usurpations of their own.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia has hypothecated in trust to the Regicides his rich\r\nand fertile territories on the Rhine, as a pledge of his zeal and\r\naffection to the cause of liberty and equality. He has seen them robbed\r\nwith unbounded liberty and with the most levelling equality. The woods\r\nare wasted, the country is ravaged, property is confiscated, and the\r\npeople are put to bear a double yoke, in the exactions of a tyrannical\r\ngovernment and in the contributions of an hostile irruption. Is it to\r\nsatisfy the Court of Berlin that the Court of London is to give the same\r\nsort of pledge of its sincerity and good faith to the French Directory?\r\nIt is not that heart full of sensibility, it is not Lucchesini, the\r\nminister of his Prussian Majesty, the late ally of England, and the\r\npresent ally of its enemy, who has demanded this pledge of our\r\nsincerity, as the price of the renewal of the long lease of his sincere\r\nfriendship to this kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is not to our enemy, the now faithful ally of Regicide, late the\r\nfaithful ally of Great Britain, the Catholic king, that we address our\r\ndoleful lamentation: it is not to the _Prince of Peace_, whose\r\ndeclaration of war was one of the first auspicious omens of general\r\ntranquillity, which our dove-like ambassador, with the olive-branch in\r\nhis beak, was saluted with at his entrance into the ark of clean birds\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\nSurely it is not to the Tetrarch of Sardinia, now the faithful ally of a\r\npower who has seized upon all his fortresses and confiscated the oldest\r\ndominions of his house,--it is not to this once powerful, once\r\nrespected, and once cherished ally of Great Britain, that we mean to\r\nprove the sincerity of the peace which we offered to make at his\r\nexpense. Or is it to him we are to prove the arrogance of the power who,\r\nunder the name of friend, oppresses him, and the poor remains of his\r\nsubjects, with all the ferocity of the most cruel enemy?\r\n\r\nIt is not to Holland, under the name of an ally, laid under a permanent\r\nmilitary contribution, filled with their double garrison of barbarous\r\nJacobin troops and ten times more barbarous Jacobin clubs and\r\nassemblies, that we find ourselves obliged to give this pledge.\r\n\r\nIs it to Genoa that we make this kind promise,--a state which the\r\nRegicides were to defend in a favorable neutrality, but whose neutrality\r\nhas been, by the gentle influence of Jacobin authority, forced into the\r\ntrammels of an alliance,--whose alliance has been secured by the\r\nadmission of French garrisons,--and whose peace has been forever\r\nratified by a forced declaration of war against ourselves?\r\n\r\nIt is not the Grand Duke of Tuscany who claims this declaration,--not\r\nthe Grand Duke, who for his early sincerity, for his love of peace, and\r\nfor his entire confidence in the amity of the assassins of his house,\r\nhas been complimented in the British Parliament with the name of \"_the\r\nwisest sovereign in Europe_\": it is not this pacific Solomon, or his\r\nphilosophic, cudgelled ministry, cudgelled by English and by French,\r\nwhose wisdom and philosophy between them have placed Leghorn in the\r\nhands of the enemy of the Austrian family, and driven the only\r\nprofitable commerce of Tuscany from its only port: it is not this\r\nsovereign, a far more able statesman than any of the Medici in whose\r\nchair he sits, it is not the philosopher Carletti, more ably speculative\r\nthan Galileo, more profoundly politic than Machiavel, that call upon us\r\nso loudly to give the same happy proofs of the same good faith to the\r\nrepublic always the same, always one and indivisible.\r\n\r\nIt is not Venice, whose principal cities the enemy has appropriated to\r\nhimself, and scornfully desired the state to indemnify itself from the\r\nEmperor, that we wish to convince of the pride and the despotism of an\r\nenemy who loads us with his scoffs and buffets.\r\n\r\nIt is not for his Holiness we intend this consolatory declaration of our\r\nown weakness, and of the tyrannous temper of his grand enemy. That\r\nprince has known both the one and the other from the beginning. The\r\nartists of the French Revolution had given their very first essays and\r\nsketches of robbery and desolation against his territories, in a far\r\nmore cruel \"murdering piece\" than had over entered into the imagination\r\nof painter or poet. Without ceremony they tore from his cherishing arms\r\nthe possessions which he held for five hundred years, undisturbed by all\r\nthe ambition of all the ambitious monarchs who during that period have\r\nreigned in France. Is it to him, in whose wrong we have in our late\r\nnegotiation ceded his now unhappy countries near the Rhone, lately\r\namongst the most flourishing (perhaps the most flourishing for their\r\nextent) of all the countries upon earth, that we are to prove the\r\nsincerity of our resolution to make peace with the Republic of\r\nBarbarism? That venerable potentate and pontiff is sunk deep into the\r\nvale of years; he is half disarmed by his peaceful character; his\r\ndominions are more than half disarmed by a peace of two hundred years,\r\ndefended as they were, not by force, but by reverence: yet, in all these\r\nstraits, we see him display, amidst the recent ruins and the new\r\ndefacements of his plundered capital, along with the mild and decorated\r\npiety of the modern, all the spirit and magnanimity of ancient Rome.\r\nDoes he, who, though himself unable to defend them, nobly refused to\r\nreceive pecuniary compensations for the protection he owed to his people\r\nof Avignon, Carpentras, and the Venaissin,--does he want proofs of our\r\ngood disposition to deliver over that people, without any security for\r\nthem, or any compensation to their sovereign, to this cruel enemy? Does\r\nhe want to be satisfied of the sincerity of our humiliation to France,\r\nwho has seen his free, fertile, and happy city and state of Bologna, the\r\ncradle of regenerated law, the seat of sciences and of arts, so\r\nhideously metamorphosed, whilst he was crying to Great Britain for aid,\r\nand offering to purchase that aid at any price? Is it him, who sees that\r\nchosen spot of plenty and delight converted into a Jacobin ferocious\r\nrepublic, dependent on the homicides of France,--is it him, who, from\r\nthe miracles of his beneficent industry, has done a work which defied\r\nthe power of the Roman emperors, though with an enthralled world to\r\nlabor for them,--is it him, who has drained and cultivated the Pontine\r\nMarshes, that we are to satisfy of our cordial spirit of conciliation\r\nwith those who, in their equity, are restoring Holland again to the\r\nseas, whose maxims poison more than the exhalations of the most deadly\r\nfens, and who turn all the fertilities of Nature and of Art into an\r\nhowling desert? Is it to him that we are to demonstrate the good faith\r\nof our submissions to the Cannibal Republic,--to him, who is commanded\r\nto deliver up into their hands Ancona and Civita Vecchia, seats of\r\ncommerce raised by the wise and liberal labors and expenses of the\r\npresent and late pontiffs, ports not more belonging to the\r\nEcclesiastical State than to the commerce of Great Britain, thus\r\nwresting from his hands the power of the keys of the centre of Italy, as\r\nbefore they had taken possession of the keys of the northern part from\r\nthe hands of the unhappy King of Sardinia, the natural ally of England?\r\nIs it to him we are to prove our good faith in the peace which we are\r\nsoliciting to receive from the hands of his and our robbers, the enemies\r\nof all arts, all sciences, all civilization, and all commerce?\r\n\r\nIs it to the Cispadane or to the Transpadane republics, which have been\r\nforced to bow under the galling yoke of French liberty, that we address\r\nall these pledges of our sincerity and love of peace with their\r\nunnatural parents?\r\n\r\nAre we by this Declaration to satisfy the King of Naples, whom we have\r\nleft to struggle as he can, after our abdication of Corsica, and the\r\nflight of the whole naval force of England out of the whole circuit of\r\nthe Mediterranean, abandoning our allies, our commerce, and the honor of\r\na nation once the protectress of all other nations, because strengthened\r\nby the independence and enriched by the commerce of them all? By the\r\nexpress provisions of a recent treaty, we had engaged with the King of\r\nNaples to keep a naval force in the Mediterranean. But, good God! was a\r\ntreaty at all necessary for this? The uniform policy of this kingdom as\r\na state, and eminently so as a commercial state, has at all times led us\r\nto keep a powerful squadron and a commodious naval station in that\r\ncentral sea, which borders upon and which connects a far greater number\r\nand variety of states, European, Asiatic, and African, than any other.\r\nWithout such a naval force, France must become despotic mistress of that\r\nsea, and of all the countries whose shores it washes. Our commerce must\r\nbecome vassal to her and dependent on her will. Since we are come no\r\nlonger to trust to our force in arms, but to our dexterity in\r\nnegotiation, and begin to pay a desperate court to a proud and coy\r\nusurpation, and have finally sent an ambassador to the Bourbon Regicides\r\nat Paris, the King of Naples, who saw that no reliance was to be placed\r\non our engagements, or on any pledge of our adherence to our nearest and\r\ndearest interests, has been obliged to send his ambassador also to join\r\nthe rest of the squalid tribe of the representatives of degraded kings.\r\nThis monarch, surely, does not want any proof of the sincerity of our\r\namicable dispositions to that amicable republic, into whose arms he has\r\nbeen given by our desertion of him.\r\n\r\nTo look to the powers of the North.--It is not to the Danish ambassador,\r\ninsolently treated in his own character and in ours, that we are to give\r\nproofs of the Regicide arrogance, and of our disposition to submit to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Sweden I cannot say much. The French influence is\r\nstruggling with her independence; and they who consider the manner in\r\nwhich the ambassador of that power was treated not long since at Paris,\r\nand the manner in which the father of the present King of Sweden\r\n(himself the victim of regicide principles and passions) would have\r\nlooked on the present assassins of France, will not be very prompt to\r\nbelieve that the young King of Sweden has made this kind of requisition\r\nto the King of Great Britain, and has given this kind of auspice of his\r\nnew government.\r\n\r\nI speak last of the most important of all. It certainly was not the late\r\nEmpress of Russia at whose instance we have given this pledge. It is not\r\nthe new Emperor, the inheritor of so much glory, and placed in a\r\nsituation of so much delicacy and difficulty for the preservation of\r\nthat inheritance, who calls on England, the natural ally of his\r\ndominions, to deprive herself of her power of action, and to bind\r\nherself to France. France at no time, and in none of its fashions, least\r\nof all in its last, has been ever looked upon as the friend either of\r\nRussia or of Great Britain. Everything good, I trust, is to be expected\r\nfrom this prince,--whatever may be without authority given out of an\r\ninfluence over his mind possessed by that only potentate from whom he\r\nhas anything to apprehend or with whom he has much even to discuss.\r\n\r\nThis sovereign knows, I have no doubt, and feels, on what sort of bottom\r\nis to be laid the foundation of a Russian throne. He knows what a rock\r\nof native granite is to form the pedestal of his statue who is to\r\nemulate Peter the Great. His renown will be in continuing with ease and\r\nsafety what his predecessor was obliged to achieve through mighty\r\nstruggles. He is sensible that his business is not to innovate, out to\r\nsecure and to establish,--that reformations at this day are attempts at\r\nbest of ambiguous utility. He will revere his father with the piety of\r\na son, but in his government he will imitate the policy of his mother.\r\nHis father, with many excellent qualities, had a short reign,--because,\r\nbeing a native Russian, he was unfortunately advised to act in the\r\nspirit of a foreigner. His mother reigned over Russia three-and-thirty\r\nyears with the greatest glory,--because, with the disadvantage of being\r\na foreigner born, she made herself a Russian. A wise prince like the\r\npresent will improve his country; but it will be cautiously and\r\nprogressively, upon its own native groundwork of religion, manners,\r\nhabitudes, and alliances. If I prognosticate right, it is not the\r\nEmperor of Russia that ever will call for extravagant proofs of our\r\ndesire to reconcile ourselves to the irreconcilable enemy of all\r\nthrones.\r\n\r\nI do not know why I should not include America among the European\r\npowers,--because she is of European origin, and has not yet, like\r\nFrance, destroyed all traces of manners, laws, opinions, and usages\r\nwhich she drew from Europe. As long as that Europe shall have any\r\npossessions either in the southern or the northern parts of that\r\nAmerica, even separated as it is by the ocean, it must be considered as\r\na part of the European system. It is not America, menaced with internal\r\nruin from the attempts to plant Jacobinism instead of liberty in that\r\ncountry,--it is not America, whose independence is directly attacked by\r\nthe French, the enemies of the independence of all nations, that calls\r\nupon us to give security by disarming ourselves in a treacherous peace.\r\nBy such a peace, we shall deliver the Americans, their liberty, and\r\ntheir order, without resource, to the mercy of their imperious allies,\r\nwho will have peace or neutrality with no state which is not ready to\r\njoin her in war against England.\r\n\r\nHaving run round the whole circle of the European system, wherever it\r\nacts, I must affirm that all the foreign powers who are not leagued with\r\nFrance for the utter destruction of all balance through Europe and\r\nthroughout the world demand other assurances from this kingdom than are\r\ngiven in that Declaration. They require assurances, not of the sincerity\r\nof our good dispositions towards the usurpation in France, but of our\r\naffection towards the college of the ancient states of Europe, and\r\npledges of our constancy, our fidelity, and of our fortitude in\r\nresisting to the last the power that menaces them all. The apprehension\r\nfrom which they wish to be delivered cannot be from anything they dread\r\nin the ambition of England. Our power must be their strength. They hope\r\nmore from us than they fear. I am sure the only ground of their hope,\r\nand of our hope, is in the greatness of mind hitherto shown by the\r\npeople of this nation, and its adherence to the unalterable principles\r\nof its ancient policy, whatever government may finally prevail in\r\nFrance. I have entered into this detail of the wishes and expectations\r\nof the European powers, in order to point out more clearly not so much\r\nwhat their disposition as (a consideration of far greater importance)\r\nwhat their situation demands, according as that situation is related to\r\nthe Regicide Republic and to this kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen, if it is not to satisfy the foreign powers we make this assurance,\r\nto what power at home is it that we pay all this humiliating court? Not\r\nto the old Whigs or to the ancient Tories of this kingdom,--if any\r\nmemory of such ancient divisions still exists amongst us. To which of\r\nthe principles of these parties is this assurance agreeable? Is it to\r\nthe Whigs we are to recommend the aggrandizement of France, and the\r\nsubversion of the balance of power? Is it to the Tories we are to\r\nrecommend our eagerness to cement ourselves with the enemies of royalty\r\nand religion? But if these parties, which by their dissensions have so\r\noften distracted the kingdom, which by their union have once saved it,\r\nand which by their collision and mutual resistance have preserved the\r\nvariety of this Constitution in its unity, be (as I believe they are)\r\nnearly extinct by the growth of new ones, which have their roots in the\r\npresent circumstances of the times, I wish to know to which of these new\r\ndescriptions this Declaration is addressed. It can hardly be to those\r\npersons who, in the new distribution of parties, consider the\r\nconservation in England of the ancient order of things as necessary to\r\npreserve order everywhere else, and who regard the general conservation\r\nof order in other countries as reciprocally necessary to preserve the\r\nsame state of things in these islands. That party never can wish to see\r\nGreat Britain pledge herself to give the lead and the ground of\r\nadvantage and superiority to the France of to-day, in any treaty which\r\nis to settle Europe. I insist upon it, that, so far from expecting such\r\nan engagement, they are generally stupefied and confounded with it. That\r\nthe other party, which demands great changes here, and is so pleased to\r\nsee them everywhere else, which party I call Jacobin, that this faction\r\ndoes, from the bottom of its heart, approve the Declaration, and does\r\nerect its crest upon the engagement, there can be little doubt. To them\r\nit may be addressed with propriety, for it answers their purposes in\r\nevery point.\r\n\r\nThe party in opposition within the House of Lords and Commons it is\r\nirreverent, and half a breach of privilege, (far from my thoughts,) to\r\nconsider as Jacobin. This party has always denied the existence of such\r\na faction, and has treated the machinations of those whom you and I call\r\nJacobins as so many forgeries and fictions of the minister and his\r\nadherents, to find a pretext for destroying freedom and setting up an\r\narbitrary power in this kingdom. However, whether this minority has a\r\nleaning towards the French system or only a charitable toleration of\r\nthose who lean that way, it is certain that they have always attacked\r\nthe sincerity of the minister in the same modes, and on the very same\r\ngrounds, and nearly in the same terms, with the Directory. It must\r\ntherefore be at the tribunal of the minority (from the whole tenor of\r\nthe speech) that the minister appeared to consider himself obliged to\r\npurge himself of duplicity. It was at their bar that he held up his\r\nhand; it was on their _sellette_ that he seemed to answer\r\ninterrogatories; it was on their principles that he defended his whole\r\nconduct. They certainly take what the French call the _haut du pavé_.\r\nThey have loudly called for the negotiation. It was accorded to them.\r\nThey engaged their support of the war with vigor, in case peace was not\r\ngranted on honorable terms. Peace was not granted on any terms,\r\nhonorable or shameful. Whether these judges, few in number, but powerful\r\nin jurisdiction, are satisfied,--whether they to whom this new pledge is\r\nhypothecated have redeemed their own,--whether they have given one\r\nparticle more of their support to ministry, or even, favored them with\r\ntheir good opinion or their candid construction, I leave it to those who\r\nrecollect that memorable debate to determine.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that neither this Declaration, nor the negotiation which is\r\nits subject, could serve any one good purpose, foreign or domestic; it\r\ncould conduce to no end, either with regard to allies or neutrals. It\r\ntends neither to bring back the misled, nor to give courage to the\r\nfearful, nor to animate and confirm those who are hearty and zealous in\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nI hear it has been said (though I can scarcely believe it) by a\r\ndistinguished person, in an assembly where, if there be less of the\r\ntorrent and tempest of eloquence, more guarded expression is to be\r\nexpected, that, indeed, there was no just ground of hope in this\r\nbusiness from the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that this noble person, however conversant in negotiation,\r\nhaving been employed in no less than four embassies, and in two\r\nhemispheres, and in one of those negotiations having fully experienced\r\nwhat it was to proceed to treaty without previous encouragement, was not\r\nat all consulted in this experiment. For his Majesty's principal\r\nminister declared, on the very same day, in another House, \"his\r\nMajesty's deep and sincere regret at its unfortunate and abrupt\r\ntermination, so different from the wishes and _hopes_ that were\r\nentertained,\"--and in other parts of the speech speaks of this abrupt\r\ntermination as a great disappointment, and as a fall from sincere\r\nendeavors and sanguine expectation. Here are, indeed, sentiments\r\ndiametrically opposite, as to the hopes with which the negotiation was\r\ncommenced and carried on; and what is curious is, the grounds of the\r\nhopes on the one side and the despair on the other are exactly the same.\r\nThe logical conclusion from the common premises is, indeed, in favor of\r\nthe noble lord; for they are agreed that the enemy was far from giving\r\nthe least degree of countenance to any such hopes, and that they\r\nproceeded in spite of every discouragement which the enemy had thrown in\r\ntheir way. But there is another material point in which they do not seem\r\nto differ: that is to say, the result of the desperate experiment of the\r\nnoble lord, and of the promising attempt of the great minister, in\r\nsatisfying the people of England, and in causing discontent to the\r\npeople of France,--or, as the minister expresses it, \"in uniting England\r\nand in dividing France.\"\r\n\r\nFor my own part, though I perfectly agreed with the noble lord that the\r\nattempt was desperate, so desperate, indeed, as to deserve _his_ name of\r\nan experiment, yet no fair man can possibly doubt that the minister was\r\nperfectly sincere in his proceeding, and that, from his ardent wishes\r\nfor peace with the Regicides, he was led to conceive hopes which were\r\nfounded rather in his vehement desires than in any rational ground of\r\npolitical speculation. Convinced as I am of this, it had been better, in\r\nmy humble opinion, that persons of great name and authority had\r\nabstained from those topics which had been used to call the minister's\r\nsincerity into doubt, and had not adopted the sentiments of the\r\nDirectory upon the subject of all our negotiations: for the noble lord\r\nexpressly says that the experiment was made for the satisfaction of the\r\ncountry. The Directory says exactly the same thing. Upon granting, in\r\nconsequence of our supplications, the passport to Lord Malmesbury, in\r\norder to remove all sort of hope from its success, they charged all our\r\nprevious steps, even to that moment of submissive demand to be admitted\r\nto their presence, on duplicity and perfidy, and assumed that the object\r\nof all the steps we had taken was that \"of justifying the continuance of\r\nthe war in the eyes of the English nation, and of throwing all the odium\r\nof it upon the French.\" \"The English nation\" (said they) \"supports\r\nimpatiently the continuance of the war, and _a reply must be made to its\r\ncomplaints and its reproaches_; the Parliament is about to be opened,\r\n_and the mouths of the orators who will declaim against the war must be\r\nshut; the demands for new taxes must be justified; and to obtain these\r\nresults, it is necessary to be able to advance that the French\r\ngovernment refuses every reasonable proposition for peace_.\" I am sorry\r\nthat the language of the friends to ministry and the enemies to mankind\r\nshould be so much in unison.\r\n\r\nAs to the fact in which these parties are so well agreed, that the\r\nexperiment ought to have been made for the satisfaction of this country,\r\n(meaning the country of England,) it were well to be wished that persons\r\nof eminence would cease to make themselves representatives of the people\r\nof England, without a letter of attorney, or any other act of\r\nprocuration. In legal construction, the sense of the people of England\r\nis to be collected from the House of Commons; and though I do not deny\r\nthe possibility of an abuse of this trust as well as any other, yet I\r\nthink, without the most weighty reasons and in the most urgent\r\nexigencies, it is highly dangerous to suppose that the House speaks\r\nanything contrary to the sense of the people, or that the representative\r\nis silent, when the sense of the constituent, strongly, decidedly, and\r\nupon long deliberation, speaks audibly upon any topic of moment. If\r\nthere is a doubt whether the House of Commons represents perfectly the\r\nwhole commons of Great Britain, (I think there is none,) there can be no\r\nquestion but that the Lords and the Commons together represent the sense\r\nof the whole people to the crown and to the world. Thus it is, when we\r\nspeak legally and constitutionally. In a great measure it is equally\r\ntrue, when we speak prudentially. But I do not pretend to assert that\r\nthere are no other principles to guide discretion than those which are\r\nor can be fixed by some law or some constitution: yet before the legally\r\npresumed sense of the people should be superseded by a supposition of\r\none more real, (as in all cases where a legal presumption is to be\r\nascertained,) some strong proofs ought to exist of a contrary\r\ndisposition in the people at large, and some decisive indications of\r\ntheir desire upon this subject. There can be no question, that,\r\npreviously to a direct message from the crown, neither House of\r\nParliament did indicate anything like a wish for such advances as we\r\nhave made or such negotiations as we have carried on. The Parliament has\r\nassented to ministry; it is not ministry that has obeyed the impulse of\r\nParliament. The people at large have their organs through which they can\r\nspeak to Parliament and to the crown by a respectful petition, and\r\nthough not with absolute authority, yet with weight, they can instruct\r\ntheir representatives. The freeholders and other electors in this\r\nkingdom have another and a surer mode of expressing their sentiments\r\nconcerning the conduct which is held by members of Parliament. In the\r\nmiddle of these transactions this last opportunity has been held out to\r\nthem. In all these points of view I positively assert that the people\r\nhave nowhere and in no way expressed their wish of throwing themselves\r\nand their sovereign at the feet of a wicked and rancorous foe, to\r\nsupplicate mercy, which, from the nature of that foe, and from the\r\ncircumstances of affairs, we had no sort of ground to expect. It is\r\nundoubtedly the business of ministers very much to consult the\r\ninclinations of the people, but they ought to take great care that they\r\ndo not receive that inclination from the few persons who may happen to\r\napproach them. The petty interests of such gentlemen, their low\r\nconceptions of things, their fears arising from the danger to which the\r\nvery arduous and critical situation of public affairs may expose their\r\nplaces, their apprehensions from the hazards to which the discontents of\r\na few popular men at elections may expose their seats in\r\nParliament,--all these causes trouble and confuse the representations\r\nwhich they make to ministers of the real temper of the nation. If\r\nministers, instead of following the great indications of the\r\nConstitution, proceed on such reports, they will take the whispers of a\r\ncabal for the voice of the people, and the counsels of imprudent\r\ntimidity for the wisdom of a nation.\r\n\r\nI well remember, that, when the fortune of the war began (and it began\r\npretty early) to turn, as it is common and natural, we were dejected by\r\nthe losses that had been sustained, and with the doubtful issue of the\r\ncontests that were foreseen. But not a word was uttered that supposed\r\npeace upon any proper terms was in our power, or therefore that it\r\nshould be in our desire. As usual, with or without reason, we\r\ncriticized the conduct of the war, and compared our fortunes with our\r\nmeasures. The mass of the nation went no further. For I suppose that you\r\nalways understood me as speaking of that very preponderating part of the\r\nnation which had always been equally adverse to the French principles\r\nand to the general progress of their Revolution throughout\r\nEurope,--considering the final success of their arms and the triumph of\r\ntheir principles as one and the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe first means that were used, by any one professing our principles, to\r\nchange the minds of this party upon that subject, appeared in a small\r\npamphlet circulated with considerable industry. It was commonly given to\r\nthe noble person himself who has passed judgment upon all hopes from\r\nnegotiation, and justified our late abortive attempt only as an\r\nexperiment made to satisfy the country; and yet that pamphlet led the\r\nway in endeavoring to dissatisfy that very country with the continuance\r\nof the war, and to raise in the people the most sanguine expectations\r\nfrom some such course of negotiation as has been fatally pursued. This\r\nleads me to suppose (and I am glad to have reason for supposing) that\r\nthere was no foundation for attributing the performance in question to\r\nthat author; but without mentioning his name in the title-page, it\r\npassed for his, and does still pass uncontradicted. It was entitled,\r\n\"Some Remarks on the Apparent Circumstances of the War in the Fourth\r\nWeek of October, 1795.\"\r\n\r\nThis sanguine little king's-fisher, (not prescient of the storm, as by\r\nhis instinct he ought to be,) appearing at that uncertain season before\r\nthe rigs of old Michaelmas were yet well composed, and when the\r\ninclement storms of winter were approaching, began to flicker over the\r\nseas, and was busy in building its halcyon nest, as if the angry ocean\r\nhad been soothed by the genial breath of May. Very unfortunately, this\r\nauspice was instantly followed by a speech from the throne in the very\r\nspirit and principles of that pamphlet.\r\n\r\nI say nothing of the newspapers, which are undoubtedly in the interest,\r\nand which are supposed by some to be directly or indirectly under the\r\ninfluence of ministers, and which, with less authority than the pamphlet\r\nI speak of, had indeed for some time before held a similar language, in\r\ndirect contradiction to their more early tone: insomuch that I can speak\r\nit with a certain assurance, that very many, who wished to\r\nadministration as well as you and I do, thought, that, in giving their\r\nopinion in favor of this peace, they followed the opinion of\r\nministry;--they were conscious that they did not lead it. My inference,\r\ntherefore, is this: that the negotiation, whatever its merits may be, in\r\nthe general principle and policy of undertaking it, is, what every\r\npolitical measure in general ought to be, the sole work of\r\nadministration; and that, if it was an experiment to satisfy anybody, it\r\nwas to satisfy those whom the ministers were in the daily habit of\r\ncondemning, and by whom they were daily condemned,--I mean the _leaders_\r\nof the _opposition_ in _Parliament_. I am certain that the ministers\r\nwere then, and are now, invested with the fullest confidence of the\r\nmajor part of the nation, to pursue such measures of peace or war as the\r\nnature of things shall suggest as most adapted to the public safety. It\r\nis in this light, therefore, as a measure which ought to have been\r\navoided and ought not to be repeated, that I take the liberty of\r\ndiscussing the merits of this system of Regicide negotiations. It is not\r\na matter of light experiment, that leaves us where it found us. Peace or\r\nwar are the great hinges upon which the very being of nations turns.\r\nNegotiations are the means of making peace or preventing war, and are\r\ntherefore of more serious importance than almost any single event of war\r\ncan possibly be.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, I do not hesitate to affirm, that this country in\r\nparticular, and the public law in general, have suffered more by this\r\nnegotiation of experiment than by all the battles together that we have\r\nlost from the commencement of this century to this time, when it touches\r\nso nearly to its close. I therefore have the misfortune not to coincide\r\nin opinion with the great statesman who set on foot a negotiation, as he\r\nsaid, \"in spite of the constant opposition he had met with from Prance.\"\r\nHe admits, \"that the difficulty in this negotiation became most\r\nseriously increased, indeed, by the situation in which we were placed,\r\nand the manner in which alone the enemy would _admit_ of a negotiation.\"\r\nThis situation so described, and so truly described, rendered our\r\nsolicitation not only degrading, but from the very outset evidently\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nI find it asserted, and even a merit taken for it, \"that this country\r\nsurmounted every difficulty of form and etiquette which the enemy had\r\nthrown in our way.\" An odd way of surmounting a difficulty, by cowering\r\nunder it! I find it asserted that an heroic resolution had been taken,\r\nand avowed in Parliament, previous to this negotiation, \"that no\r\nconsideration of etiquette should stand in the way of it.\"\r\n\r\nEtiquette, if I understand rightly the term, which in any extent is of\r\nmodern usage, had its original application to those ceremonial and\r\nformal observances practised at courts, which had been established by\r\nlong usage, in order to preserve the sovereign power from the rude\r\nintrusion of licentious familiarity, as well as to preserve majesty\r\nitself from a disposition to consult its ease at the expense of its\r\ndignity. The term came afterwards to have a greater latitude, and to be\r\nemployed to signify certain formal methods used in the transactions\r\nbetween sovereign states.\r\n\r\nIn the more limited, as well as in the larger sense of the term, without\r\nknowing what the etiquette is, it is impossible to determine whether it\r\nis a vain and captious punctilio, or a form necessary to preserve\r\ndecorum in character and order in business. I readily admit that nothing\r\ntends to facilitate the issue of all public transactions more than a\r\nmutual disposition in the parties treating to waive all ceremony. But\r\nthe use of this temporary suspension of the recognized modes of respect\r\nconsists in its being mutual, and in the spirit of conciliation in which\r\nall ceremony is laid aside. On the contrary, when one of the parties to\r\na treaty intrenches himself up to the chin in these ceremonies, and will\r\nnot on his side abate a single punctilio, and that all the concessions\r\nare upon one side only, the party so conceding does by this act place\r\nhimself in a relation of inferiority, and thereby fundamentally subverts\r\nthat equality which is of the very essence of all treaty.\r\n\r\nAfter this formal act of degradation, it was but a matter of course that\r\ngross insult should be offered to our ambassador, and that he should\r\ntamely submit to it. He found himself provoked to complain of the\r\natrocious libels against his public character and his person which\r\nappeared in a paper under the avowed patronage of that government. The\r\nRegicide Directory, on this complaint, did not recognize the paper: and\r\nthat was all. They did not punish, they did not dismiss, they did not\r\neven reprimand the writer. As to our ambassador, this total want of\r\nreparation for the injury was passed by under the pretence of despising\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn this but too serious business, it is not possible here to avoid a\r\nsmile. Contempt is not a thing to be despised. It may be borne with a\r\ncalm and equal mind, but no man by lifting his head high can pretend\r\nthat he does not perceive the scorns that are poured down upon him from\r\nabove. All these sudden complaints of injury, and all these deliberate\r\nsubmissions to it, are the inevitable consequences of the situation in\r\nwhich we had placed ourselves: a situation wherein the insults were such\r\nas Nature would not enable us to bear, and circumstances would not\r\npermit us to resent.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, after this contempt of contempt upon the part\r\nof our ambassador, (who by the way represented his sovereign,) that a\r\nnew object was furnished for displaying sentiments of the same kind,\r\nthough the case was infinitely aggravated. Not the ambassador, but the\r\nking himself, was libelled and insulted,--libelled, not by a creature of\r\nthe Directory, but by the Directory itself. At least, so Lord Malmesbury\r\nunderstood it, and so he answered it in his note of the 12th November,\r\n1796, in which he says,--\"With regard to the _offensive and injurious_\r\ninsinuations which are contained in that paper, and which are only\r\ncalculated to throw new obstacles in the way of the accommodation which\r\nthe French government professes to desire, THE KING HAS DEEMED IT FAR\r\nBENEATH HIS DIGNITY to permit an answer to be made to them on his part,\r\nin any manner whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nI am of opinion, that, if his Majesty had kept aloof from that wash and\r\noffscouring of everything that is low and barbarous in the world, it\r\nmight be well thought unworthy of his dignity to take notice of such\r\nscurrilities: they must be considered as much the natural expression of\r\nthat kind of animal as it is the expression of the feelings of a dog to\r\nbark. But when the king had been advised to recognize not only the\r\nmonstrous composition as a sovereign power, but, in conduct, to admit\r\nsomething in it like a superiority,--when the bench of Regicide was made\r\nat least coordinate with his throne, and raised upon a platform full as\r\nelevated, this treatment could not be passed by under the appearance of\r\ndespising it. It would not, indeed, have been proper to keep up a war of\r\nthe same kind; but an immediate, manly, and decided resentment ought to\r\nhave been the consequence. We ought not to have waited for the\r\ndisgraceful dismissal of our ambassador. There are cases in which we may\r\npretend to sleep; but the wittol rule has some sense in it, _Non omnibus\r\ndormio_. We might, however, have seemed ignorant of the affront; but\r\nwhat was the fact? Did we dissemble or pass it by in silence? When\r\ndignity is talked of, a language which I did not expect to hear in such\r\na transaction, I must say, what all the world must feel, that it was not\r\nfor the king's dignity to notice this insult and not to resent it. This\r\nmode of proceeding is formed on new ideas of the correspondence between\r\nsovereign powers.\r\n\r\nThis was far from the only ill effect of the policy of degradation. The\r\nstate of inferiority in which we were placed, in this vain attempt at\r\ntreaty, drove us headlong from error into error, and led us to wander\r\nfar away, not only from all the paths which have been beaten in the old\r\ncourse of political communication between mankind, but out of the ways\r\neven of the most common prudence. Against all rules, after we had met\r\nnothing but rebuffs in return to all our proposals, we made _two\r\nconfidential communications_ to those in whom we had no confidence and\r\nwho reposed no confidence in us. What was worse, we were fully aware of\r\nthe madness of the step we were taking. Ambassadors are not sent to a\r\nhostile power, persevering in sentiments of hostility, to make candid,\r\nconfidential, and amicable communications. Hitherto the world has\r\nconsidered it as the duty of an ambassador in such a situation to be\r\ncautious, guarded, dexterous, and circumspect. It is true that mutual\r\nconfidence and common interest dispense with all rules, smooth the\r\nrugged way, remove every obstacle, and make all things plain and level.\r\nWhen, in the last century, Temple and De Witt negotiated the famous\r\nTriple Alliance, their candor, their freedom, and the most\r\n_confidential_ disclosures were the result of true policy. Accordingly,\r\nin spite of all the dilatory forms of the complex government of the\r\nUnited Provinces, the treaty was concluded in three days. It did not\r\ntake a much longer time to bring the same state (that of Holland)\r\nthrough a still more complicated transaction,--that of the _Grand\r\nAlliance_. But in the present case, this unparalleled candor, this\r\nunpardonable want of reserve, produced, what might have been expected\r\nfrom it, the most serious evils. It instructed the enemy in the whole\r\nplan of our demands and concessions. It made the most fatal discoveries.\r\n\r\nAnd first, it induced us to lay down the basis of a treaty which itself\r\nhad nothing to rest upon. It seems, we thought we had gained a great\r\npoint in getting this basis admitted,--that is, a basis of mutual\r\ncompensation and exchange of conquests. If a disposition to peace, and\r\nwith any reasonable assurance, had been previously indicated, such a\r\nplan of arrangement might with propriety and safety be proposed; because\r\nthese arrangements were not, in effect, to make the basis, but a part of\r\nthe superstructure, of the fabric of pacification. The order of things\r\nwould thus be reversed. The mutual disposition to peace would form the\r\nreasonable base, upon which the scheme of compensation upon one side or\r\nthe other might be constructed. This truly fundamental base being once\r\nlaid, all differences arising from the spirit of huckstering and barter\r\nmight be easily adjusted. If the restoration of peace, with a view to\r\nthe establishment of a fair balance of power in Europe, had been made\r\nthe real basis of the treaty, the reciprocal value of the compensations\r\ncould not be estimated according to their proportion to each other, but\r\naccording to their proportionate relation to that end: to that great end\r\nthe whole would be subservient. The effect of the treaty would be in a\r\nmanner secured before the detail of particulars was begun, and for a\r\nplain reason,--because the hostile spirit on both sides had been\r\nconjured down; but if, in the full fury and unappeased rancor of war, a\r\nlittle traffic is attempted, it is easy to divine what must be the\r\nconsequence to those who endeavor to open that kind of petty commerce.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what I have said, I go back no further than to the two\r\nlast Treaties of Paris, and to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which\r\npreceded the first of these two Treaties of Paris by about fourteen or\r\nfifteen years. I do not mean here to criticize any of them. My opinions\r\nupon some particulars of the Treaty of Paris in 1763 are published in a\r\npamphlet[39] which your recollection will readily bring into your view.\r\nI recur to them only to show that their basis had not been, and never\r\ncould have been, a mere dealing of truck and barter, but that the\r\nparties being willing, from common fatigue or common suffering, to put\r\nan end to a war the first object of which had either been obtained or\r\ndespaired of, the lesser objects were not thought worth the price of\r\nfurther contest. The parties understanding one another, so much was\r\ngiven away without considering from whose budget it came, not as the\r\nvalue of the objects, but as the value of peace to the parties might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nAt the last Treaty of Paris, the subjugation of America being despaired\r\nof on the part of Great Britain, and the independence of America being\r\nlooked upon as secure on the part of France, the main cause of the war\r\nwas removed; and then the conquests which France had made upon us (for\r\nwe had made none of importance upon her) were surrendered with\r\nsufficient facility. Peace was restored as peace. In America the parties\r\nstood as they were possessed. A limit was to be settled, but settled as\r\na limit to secure that peace, and not at all on a system of equivalents,\r\nfor which, as we then stood with the United States, there were little or\r\nno materials.\r\n\r\nAt the preceding Treaty of Paris, I mean that of 1763, there was\r\nnothing at all on which to fix a basis of compensation from reciprocal\r\ncession of conquests. They were all on one side. The question with us\r\nwas not what we were to receive, and on what consideration, but what we\r\nwere to keep for indemnity or to cede for peace. Accordingly, no place\r\nbeing left for barter, sacrifices were made on our side to peace; and we\r\nsurrendered to the French their most valuable possessions in the West\r\nIndies without any equivalent. The rest of Europe fell soon after into\r\nits ancient order; and the German war ended exactly where it had begun.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was built upon a similar basis. All the\r\nconquests in Europe had been made by France. She had subdued the\r\nAustrian Netherlands, and broken open the gates of Holland. We had taken\r\nnothing in the West Indies; and Cape Breton was a trifling business\r\nindeed. France gave up all for peace. The Allies had given up all that\r\nwas ceded at Utrecht. Louis the Fourteenth made all, or nearly all, the\r\ncessions at Ryswick, and at Nimeguen. In all those treaties, and in all\r\nthe preceding, as well as in the others which intervened, the question\r\nnever had been that of barter. The balance of power had been ever\r\nassumed as the known common law of Europe at all times and by all\r\npowers: the question had only been (as it must happen) on the more or\r\nless inclination of that balance.\r\n\r\nThis general balance was regarded in four principal points of view: the\r\nGREAT MIDDLE BALANCE, which comprehended Great Britain, France, and\r\nSpain; the BALANCE OF THE NORTH; the BALANCE, external and internal, of\r\nGERMANY; and the BALANCE OF ITALY. In all those systems of balance,\r\nEngland was the power to whose custody it was thought it might be most\r\nsafely committed.\r\n\r\nFrance, as she happened to stand, secured the balance or endangered it.\r\nWithout question, she had been long the security for the balance of\r\nGermany, and, under her auspices, the system, if not formed, had been at\r\nleast perfected. She was so in some measure with regard to Italy, more\r\nthan occasionally. She had a clear interest in the balance of the North,\r\nand had endeavored to preserve it. But when we began to treat with the\r\npresent France, or, more properly, to prostrate ourselves to her, and to\r\ntry if we should be admitted to ransom our allies, upon a system of\r\nmutual concession and compensation, we had not one of the usual\r\nfacilities. For, first, we had not the smallest indication of a desire\r\nfor peace on the part of the enemy, but rather the direct contrary. Men\r\ndo not make sacrifices to obtain what they do not desire: and as for the\r\nbalance of power, it was so far from being admitted by France, either on\r\nthe general system, or with regard to the particular systems that I have\r\nmentioned, that, in the whole body of their authorized or encouraged\r\nreports and discussions upon the theory of the diplomatic system, they\r\nconstantly rejected the very idea of the balance of power, and treated\r\nit as the true cause of all the wars and calamities that had afflicted\r\nEurope; and their practice was correspondent to the dogmatic positions\r\nthey had laid down. The Empire and the Papacy it was their great object\r\nto destroy; and this, now openly avowed and steadfastly acted upon,\r\nmight have been discerned with very little acuteness of sight, from the\r\nvery first dawnings of the Revolution, to be the main drift of their\r\npolicy: for they professed a resolution to destroy everything which can\r\nhold states together by the tie of opinion.\r\n\r\nExploding, therefore, all sorts of balances, they avow their design to\r\nerect themselves into a new description of empire, which is not grounded\r\non any balance, but forms a sort of impious hierarchy, of which France\r\nis to be the head and the guardian. The law of this their empire is\r\nanything rather than the public law of Europe, the ancient conventions\r\nof its several states, or the ancient opinions which assign to them\r\nsuperiority or preëminence of any sort, or any other kind of connection\r\nin virtue of ancient relations. They permit, and that is all, the\r\ntemporary existence of some of the old communities: but whilst they give\r\nto these tolerated states this temporary respite, in order to secure\r\nthem in a condition of real dependence on themselves, they invest them\r\non every side by a body of republics, formed on the model, and dependent\r\nostensibly, as well as substantially, on the will of the mother republic\r\nto which they owe their origin. These are to be so many garrisons to\r\ncheck and control the states which are to be permitted to remain on the\r\nold model until they are ripe for a change. It is in this manner that\r\nFrance, on her new system, means to form an universal empire, by\r\nproducing an universal revolution. By this means, forming a new code of\r\ncommunities according to what she calls the natural rights of man and of\r\nstates, she pretends to secure eternal peace to the world, guarantied by\r\nher generosity and justice, which are to grow with the extent of her\r\npower. To talk of the balance of power to the governors of such a\r\ncountry was a jargon which they could not understand even through an\r\ninterpreter. Before men can transact any affair, they must have a\r\ncommon language to speak, and some common, recognized principles on\r\nwhich they can argue; otherwise all is cross purpose and confusion. It\r\nwas, therefore, an essential preliminary to the whole proceeding, to fix\r\nwhether the balance of power, the liberties and laws of the Empire, and\r\nthe treaties of different belligerent powers in past times, when they\r\nput an end to hostilities, were to be considered as the basis of the\r\npresent negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the enemy's plan was known when Lord Malmesbury was sent\r\nwith his scrap of equivalents to Paris. Yet, in this unfortunate attempt\r\nat negotiation, instead of fixing these points, and assuming the balance\r\nof power and the peace of Europe as the basis to which all cessions on\r\nall sides were to be subservient, our solicitor for peace was directed\r\nto reverse that order. He was directed to make mutual concessions, on a\r\nmere comparison of their marketable value, the base of treaty. The\r\nbalance of power was to be thrown in as an inducement, and a sort of\r\nmake-weight to supply the manifest deficiency, which must stare him and\r\nthe world in the face, between those objects which he was to require the\r\nenemy to surrender and those which he had to offer as a fair equivalent.\r\n\r\nTo give any force to this inducement, and to make it answer even the\r\nsecondary purpose of equalizing equivalents having in themselves no\r\nnatural proportionate value, it supposed that the enemy, contrary to the\r\nmost notorious fact, did admit this balance of power to be of some\r\nvalue, great or small; whereas it is plain, that, in the enemy's\r\nestimate of things, the consideration of the balance of power, as we\r\nhave said before, was so far from going in diminution of the value of\r\nwhat the Directory was desired to surrender, or of giving an additional\r\nprice to our objects offered in exchange, that the hope of the utter\r\ndestruction of that balance became a new motive to the junto of\r\nRegicides for preserving, as a means for realizing that hope, what we\r\nwished them to abandon.\r\n\r\nThus stood the basis of the treaty, on laying the first stone of the\r\nfoundation. At the very best, upon our side, the question stood upon a\r\nmere naked bargain and sale. Unthinking people here triumphed, when they\r\nthought they had obtained it; whereas, when obtained as a basis of a\r\ntreaty, it was just the worst we could possibly have chosen. As to our\r\noffer to cede a most unprofitable, and, indeed, beggarly, chargeable\r\ncounting-house or two in the East Indies, we ought not to presume that\r\nthey would consider this as anything else than a mockery. As to anything\r\nof real value, we had nothing under heaven to offer, (for which we were\r\nnot ourselves in a very dubious struggle,) except the island of\r\nMartinico only. When this object was to be weighed against the\r\nDirectorial conquests, merely as an object of a value at market, the\r\nprinciple of barter became perfectly ridiculous: a single quarter in the\r\nsingle city of Amsterdam was worth ten Martinicos, and would have sold\r\nfor many more years' purchase in any market overt in Europe. How was\r\nthis gross and glaring defect in the objects of exchange to be supplied?\r\nIt was to be made up by argument. And what was that argument? The\r\nextreme utility of possessions in the West Indies to the augmentation of\r\nthe naval power of France. A very curious topic of argument to be\r\nproposed and insisted on by an ambassador of Great Britain! It is\r\ndirectly and plainly this:--\"Come, we know that of all things you wish a\r\nnaval power, and it is natural you should, who wish to destroy the very\r\nsources of the British greatness, to overpower our marine, to destroy\r\nour commerce, to eradicate our foreign influence, and to lay us open to\r\nan invasion, which at one stroke may complete our servitude and ruin and\r\nexpunge us from among the nations of the earth. Here I have it in my\r\nbudget, the infallible arcanum for that purpose. You are but novices in\r\nthe art of naval resources. Let you have the West Indies back, and your\r\nmaritime preponderance is secured, for which you would do well to be\r\nmoderate in your demands upon the Austrian Netherlands.\"\r\n\r\nUnder any circumstances, this is a most extraordinary topic of argument;\r\nbut it is rendered by much the more unaccountable, when we are told,\r\nthat, if the war has been diverted from the great object of establishing\r\nsociety and good order in Europe by destroying the usurpation in France,\r\nthis diversion was made to increase the naval resources and power of\r\nGreat Britain, and to lower, if not annihilate, those of the marine of\r\nFrance. I leave all this to the very serious reflection of every\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\nThis basis was no sooner admitted than the rejection of a treaty upon\r\nthat sole foundation was a thing of course. The enemy did not think it\r\nworthy of a discussion, as in truth it was not; and immediately, as\r\nusual, they began, in the most opprobrious and most insolent manner, to\r\nquestion our sincerity and good faith: whereas, in truth, there was no\r\none symptom wanting of openness and fair dealing. What could be more\r\nfair than to lay open to an enemy all that you wished to obtain, and the\r\nprice you meant to pay for it, and to desire him to imitate your\r\ningenuous proceeding, and in the same manner to open his honest heart to\r\nyou? Here was no want of fair dealing, but there was too evidently a\r\nfault of another kind: there was much weakness,--there was an eager and\r\nimpotent desire of associating with this unsocial power, and of\r\nattempting the connection by any means, however manifestly feeble and\r\nineffectual. The event was committed to chance,--that is, to such a\r\nmanifestation of the desire of France for peace as would induce the\r\nDirectory to forget the advantages they had in the system of barter.\r\nAccordingly, the general desire for such a peace was triumphantly\r\nreported from the moment that Lord Malmesbury had set his foot on shore\r\nat Calais.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Directory was compelled against its will to\r\naccept the basis of barter (as if that had tended to accelerate the work\r\nof pacification!) by the voice of all France. Had this been the case,\r\nthe Directors would have continued to listen to that voice to which it\r\nseems they were so obedient: they would have proceeded with the\r\nnegotiation upon that basis. But the fact is, that they instantly broke\r\nup the negotiation, as soon as they had obliged our ambassador to\r\nviolate all the principles of treaty, and weakly, rashly, and\r\nunguardedly to expose, without any counter proposition, the whole of our\r\nproject with regard to ourselves and our allies, and without holding out\r\nthe smallest hope that they would admit the smallest part of our\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nWhen they had thus drawn from us all that they could draw out, they\r\nexpelled Lord Malmesbury, and they appealed, for the propriety of their\r\nconduct, to that very France which we thought proper to suppose had\r\ndriven them to this fine concession: and I do not find that in either\r\ndivision of the family of thieves, the younger branch, or the elder, or\r\nin any other body whatsoever, there was any indignation excited, or any\r\ntumult raised, or anything like the virulence of opposition which was\r\nshown to the king's ministers here, on account of that transaction.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, it seems a hope is still entertained that the\r\nDirectory will have that tenderness for the carcass of their country, by\r\nwhose very distemper, and on whose festering wounds, like vermin, they\r\nare fed, that these pious patriots will of themselves come into a more\r\nmoderate and reasonable way of thinking and acting. In the name of\r\nwonder, what has inspired our ministry with this hope any more than with\r\ntheir former expectations?\r\n\r\nDo these hopes only arise from continual disappointment? Do they grow\r\nout of the usual grounds of despair? What is there to encourage them, in\r\nthe conduct or even in the declarations of the ruling powers in France,\r\nfrom the first formation of their mischievous republic to the hour in\r\nwhich I write? Is not the Directory composed of the same junto? Are they\r\nnot the identical men who, from the base and sordid vices which belonged\r\nto their original place and situation, aspired to the dignity of\r\ncrimes,--and from the dirtiest, lowest, most fraudulent, and most\r\nknavish of chicaners, ascended in the scale of robbery, sacrilege, and\r\nassassination in all its forms, till at last they had imbrued their\r\nimpious hands in the blood of their sovereign? Is it from these men that\r\nwe are to hope for this paternal tenderness to their country, and this\r\nsacred regard for the peace and happiness of all nations?\r\n\r\nBut it seems there is still another lurking hope, akin to that which\r\nduped us so egregiously before, when our delightful basis was accepted:\r\nwe still flatter ourselves that the public voice of France will compel\r\nthis Directory to more moderation. Whence does this hope arise? What\r\npublic voice is there in France? There are, indeed, some writers, who,\r\nsince this monster of a Directory has obtained a great, regular,\r\nmilitary force to guard them, are indulged in a sufficient liberty of\r\nwriting; and some of them write well, undoubtedly. But the world knows\r\nthat in France there is no public,--that the country is composed but of\r\ntwo descriptions, audacious tyrants and trembling slaves. The contests\r\nbetween the tyrants is the only vital principle that can be discerned in\r\nFrance. The only thing which there appears like spirit is amongst their\r\nlate associates, and fastest friends of the Directory,--the more furious\r\nand untamable part of the Jacobins. This discontented member of the\r\nfaction does almost balance the reigning divisions, and it threatens\r\nevery moment to predominate. For the present, however, the dread of\r\ntheir fury forms some sort of security to their fellows, who now\r\nexercise a more regular and therefore a somewhat less ferocious tyranny.\r\nMost of the slaves choose a quiet, however reluctant, submission to\r\nthose who are somewhat satiated with blood, and who, like wolves, are a\r\nlittle more tame from being a little less hungry, in preference to an\r\nirruption of the famished devourers who are prowling and howling about\r\nthe fold.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance assures some degree of permanence to the power of\r\nthose whom we know to be permanently our rancorous and implacable\r\nenemies. But to those very enemies who have sworn our destruction we\r\nhave ourselves given a further and far better security, by rendering the\r\ncause of the royalists desperate. Those brave and virtuous, but\r\nunfortunate adherents to the ancient Constitution of their country,\r\nafter the miserable slaughters which have been made in that body, after\r\nall their losses by emigration, are still numerous, but unable to exert\r\nthemselves against the force of the usurpation evidently countenanced\r\nand upheld by those very princes who had called them to arm for the\r\nsupport of the legal monarchy. Where, then, after chasing these fleeting\r\nhopes of ours from point to point of the political horizon, are they at\r\nlast really found? Not where, under Providence, the hopes of Englishmen\r\nused to be placed, in our own courage and in our own virtues, but in the\r\nmoderation and virtue of the most atrocious monsters that have ever\r\ndisgraced and plagued mankind.\r\n\r\nThe only excuse to be made for all our mendicant diplomacy is the same\r\nas in the case of all other mendicancy, namely, that it has been founded\r\non absolute necessity. This deserves consideration. Necessity, as it has\r\nno law, so it has no shame. But moral necessity is not like\r\nmetaphysical, or even physical. In that category it is a word of loose\r\nsignification, and conveys different ideas to different minds. To the\r\nlow-minded, the slightest necessity becomes an invincible necessity.\r\n\"The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way, and I shall be\r\ndevoured in the streets.\" But when the necessity pleaded is not in the\r\nnature of things, but in the vices of him who alleges it, the whining\r\ntones of commonplace beggarly rhetoric produce nothing but indignation:\r\nbecause they indicate a desire of keeping up a dishonorable existence,\r\nwithout utility to others, and without dignity to itself; because they\r\naim at obtaining the dues of labor without industry, and by frauds would\r\ndraw from the compassion of others what men ought to owe to their own\r\nspirit and their own exertions.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly satisfied, that, if we degrade ourselves, it is the\r\ndegradation which will subject us to the yoke of necessity, and not that\r\nit is necessity which has brought on our degradation. In this same\r\nchaos, where light and darkness are struggling together, the open\r\nsubscription of last year, with all its circumstances, must have given\r\nus no little glimmering of hope: not (as I have heard it was vainly\r\ndiscoursed) that the loan could prove a crutch to a lame negotiation\r\nabroad, and that the whiff and wind of it must at once have disposed the\r\nenemies of all tranquillity to a desire for peace. Judging on the face\r\nof facts, if on them it had any effect at all, it had the direct\r\ncontrary effect; for very soon after the loan became public at Paris,\r\nthe negotiation ended, and our ambassador was ignominiously expelled. My\r\nview of this was different: I liked the loan, not from the influence\r\nwhich it might have on the enemy, but on account of the temper which it\r\nindicated in our own people. This alone is a consideration of any\r\nimportance; because all calculation formed upon a supposed relation of\r\nthe habitudes of others to our own, under the present circumstances, is\r\nweak and fallacious. The adversary must be judged, not by what we are,\r\nor by what we wish him to be, but by what we must know he actually is:\r\nunless we choose to shut our eyes and our ears to the uniform tenor of\r\nall his discourses, and to his uniform course in all his actions. We may\r\nbe deluded; but we cannot pretend that we have been disappointed. The\r\nold rule of _Ne te quæsiveris extra_ is a precept as available in policy\r\nas it is in morals. Let us leave off speculating upon the disposition\r\nand the wants of the enemy. Let us descend into our own bosoms; let us\r\nask ourselves what are our duties, and what are our means of discharging\r\nthem. In what heart are you at home? How far may an English minister\r\nconfide in the affections, in the confidence, in the force of an English\r\npeople? What does he find us, when he puts us to the proof of what\r\nEnglish interest and English honor demand? It is as furnishing an answer\r\nto these questions that I consider the circumstances of the loan. The\r\neffect on the enemy is not in what he may speculate on our resources,\r\nbut in what he shall feel from our arms.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the loan have proved beyond a doubt three capital\r\npoints, which, if they are properly used, may be advantageous to the\r\nfuture liberty and happiness of mankind. In the first place, the loan\r\ndemonstrates, in regard to instrumental resources, the competency of\r\nthis kingdom to the assertion of the common cause, and to the\r\nmaintenance and superintendence of that which it is its duty and its\r\nglory to hold and to watch over,--the balance of power throughout the\r\nChristian world. Secondly, it brings to light what, under the most\r\ndiscouraging appearances, I always reckoned on: that, with its ancient\r\nphysical force, not only unimpaired, but augmented, its ancient spirit\r\nis still alive in the British nation. It proves that for their\r\napplication there is a spirit equal to the resources, for its energy\r\nabove them. It proves that there exists, though not always visible, a\r\nspirit which never fails to come forth, whenever it is ritually\r\ninvoked,--a spirit which will give no equivocal response, but such as\r\nwill hearten the timidity and fix the irresolution of hesitating\r\nprudence,--a spirit which will be ready to perform all the tasks that\r\nshall be imposed upon it by public honor. Thirdly, the loan displays an\r\nabundant confidence in his Majesty's government, as administered by his\r\npresent servants, in the prosecution of a war which the people consider,\r\nnot as a war made on the suggestion of ministers, and to answer the\r\npurposes of the ambition or pride of statesmen, but as a war of their\r\nown, and in defence of that very property which they expend for its\r\nsupport,--a war for that order of things from which everything valuable\r\nthat they possess is derived, and in which order alone it can possibly\r\nbe maintained.\r\n\r\nI hear, in derogation of the value of the fact from which I draw\r\ninferences so favorable to the spirit of the people and to its just\r\nexpectation from ministers, that the eighteen million loan is to be\r\nconsidered in no other light than as taking advantage of a very\r\nlucrative bargain held out to the subscribers. I do not in truth believe\r\nit. All the circumstances which attended the subscription strongly spoke\r\na different language. Be it, however, as these detractors say. This with\r\nme derogates little, or rather nothing at all, from the political value\r\nand importance of the fact. I should be very sorry, if the transaction\r\nwas not such a bargain; otherwise it would not have been a fair one. A\r\ncorrupt and improvident loan, like everything else corrupt or prodigal,\r\ncannot be too much condemned; but there is a short-sighted parsimony\r\nstill more fatal than an unforeseeing expense. The value of money must\r\nbe judged, like everything else, from its rate at market. To force that\r\nmarket, or any market, is of all things the most dangerous. For a small\r\ntemporary benefit, the spring of all public credit might be relaxed\r\nforever. The moneyed men have a right to look to advantage in the\r\ninvestment of their property. To advance their money, they risk it; and\r\nthe risk is to be included in the price. If they were to incur a loss,\r\nthat loss would amount to a tax on that peculiar species of property. In\r\neffect, it would be the most unjust and impolitic of all\r\nthings,--unequal taxation. It would throw upon one description of\r\npersons in the community that burden which ought by fair and equitable\r\ndistribution to rest upon the whole. None on account of their dignity\r\nshould be exempt; none (preserving due proportion) on account of the\r\nscantiness of their means. The moment a man is exempted from the\r\nmaintenance of the community, he is in a sort separated from it,--he\r\nloses the place of a citizen.\r\n\r\nSo it is in all _taxation_. But in a _bargain_, when terms of loss are\r\nlooked for by the borrower from the lender, compulsion, or what\r\nvirtually is compulsion, introduces itself into the place of treaty.\r\nWhen compulsion may be at all used by a state in borrowing the occasion\r\nmust determine. But the compulsion ought to be known, and well defined,\r\nand well distinguished; for otherwise treaty only weakens the energy of\r\ncompulsion, while compulsion destroys the freedom of a bargain. The\r\nadvantage of both is lost by the confusion of things in their nature\r\nutterly unsociable. It would be to introduce compulsion into that in\r\nwhich freedom and existence are the same: I mean credit. The moment that\r\nshame or fear or force are directly or indirectly applied to a loan,\r\ncredit perishes.\r\n\r\nThere must be some impulse, besides public spirit, to put private\r\ninterest into motion along with it. Moneyed men ought to be allowed to\r\nset a value on their money: if they did not, there could be no moneyed\r\nmen. This desire of accumulation is a principle without which the means\r\nof their service to the state could not exist. The love of lucre, though\r\nsometimes carried to a ridiculous, sometimes to a vicious excess, is the\r\ngrand cause of prosperity to all states. In this natural, this\r\nreasonable, this powerful, this prolific principle, it is for the\r\nsatirist to expose the ridiculous,--it is for the moralist to censure\r\nthe vicious,--it is for the sympathetic heart to reprobate the hard and\r\ncruel,--it is for the judge to animadvert on the fraud, the extortion,\r\nand the oppression; but it is for the statesman to employ it as he finds\r\nit, with all its concomitant excellencies, with all its imperfections on\r\nits head. It is his part, in this case, as it is in all other cases,\r\nwhere he is to make use of the general energies of Nature, to take them\r\nas he finds them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is a great mistake to imagine, as too commonly, almost\r\nindeed generally, it is imagined, that the public borrower and the\r\nprivate lender are two adverse parties, with different and contending\r\ninterests, and that what is given to the one is wholly taken from the\r\nother. Constituted as our system of finance and taxation is, the\r\ninterests of the contracting parties cannot well be separated, whatever\r\nthey may reciprocally intend. He who is the hard lender of to-day\r\nto-morrow is the generous contributor to his own payment. For example,\r\nthe last loan is raised on public taxes, which are designed to produce\r\nannually two millions sterling. At first view, this is an annuity of two\r\nmillions dead charge upon the public in favor of certain moneyed men;\r\nbut inspect the thing more nearly, follow the stream in its meanders,\r\nand you will find that there is a good deal of fallacy in this state of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nI take it, that whoever considers any man's expenditure of his income,\r\nold or new, (I speak of certain classes in life,) will find a full third\r\nof it to go in taxes, direct or indirect. If so, this new-created income\r\nof two millions will probably furnish 665,000_l._ (I avoid broken\r\nnumbers) towards the payment of its own interest, or to the sinking of\r\nits own capital. So it is with the whole of the public debt. Suppose it\r\nany given sum, it is a fallacious estimate of the affairs of a nation to\r\nconsider it as a mere burden. To a degree it is so without question, but\r\nnot wholly so, nor anything like it. If the income from the interest be\r\nspent, the above proportion returns again into the public stock;\r\ninsomuch that, taking the interest of the whole debt to be twelve\r\nmillion three hundred thousand pound, (it is something more,) not less\r\nthan a sum of four million one hundred thousand pound comes back again\r\nto the public through the channel of imposition. If the whole or any\r\npart of that income be saved, so much new capital is generated,--the\r\ninfallible operation of which is to lower the value of money, and\r\nconsequently to conduce towards the improvement of public credit.\r\n\r\nI take the expenditure of the _capitalist_, not the value of the\r\ncapital, as my standard; because it is the standard upon which, amongst\r\nus, property, as an object of taxation, is rated. In this country, land\r\nand offices only excepted, we raise no faculty tax. We preserve the\r\nfaculty from the expense. Our taxes, for the far greater portion, fly\r\nover the heads of the lowest classes. They escape too, who, with better\r\nability, voluntarily subject themselves to the harsh discipline of a\r\nrigid necessity. With us, labor and frugality, the parents of riches,\r\nare spared, and wisely too. The moment men cease to augment the common\r\nstock, the moment they no longer enrich it by their industry or their\r\nself-denial, their luxury and even their ease are obliged to pay\r\ncontribution to the public; not because they are vicious principles, but\r\nbecause they are unproductive. If, in fact, the interest paid by the\r\npublic had not thus revolved again into its own fund, if this secretion\r\nhad not again been absorbed into the mass of blood, it would have been\r\nimpossible for the nation to have existed to this time under such a\r\ndebt. But under the debt it does exist and flourish; and this\r\nflourishing state of existence in no small degree is owing to the\r\ncontribution from the debt to the payment. Whatever, therefore, is taken\r\nfrom that capital by too close a bargain is but a delusive advantage: it\r\nis so much lost to the public in another way. This matter cannot, on the\r\none side or the other, be metaphysically pursued to the extreme; but it\r\nis a consideration of which, in all discussions of this kind, we ought\r\nnever wholly to lose sight.\r\n\r\nIt is never, therefore, wise to quarrel with the interested views of\r\nmen, whilst they are combined with the public interest and promote it:\r\nit is our business to tie the knot, if possible, closer. Resources that\r\nare derived from extraordinary virtues, as such virtues are rare, so\r\nthey must be unproductive. It is a good thing for a moneyed man to\r\npledge his property on the welfare of his country: he shows that he\r\nplaces his treasure where his heart is; and revolving in this circle, we\r\nknow, that, \"wherever a man's treasure is, there his heart will be\r\nalso.\" For these reasons, and on these principles, I have been sorry to\r\nsee the attempts which have been made, with more good meaning than\r\nforesight and consideration, towards raising the annual interest of this\r\nloan by private contributions. Wherever a regular revenue is\r\nestablished, there voluntary contribution can answer no purpose but to\r\ndisorder and disturb it in its course. To recur to such aids is, for so\r\nmuch, to dissolve the community, and to return to a state of unconnected\r\nNature. And even if such a supply should be productive in a degree\r\ncommensurate to its object, it must also be productive of much vexation\r\nand much oppression. Either the citizens by the proposed duties pay\r\ntheir proportion according to some rate made by public authority, or\r\nthey do not. If the law be well made, and the contributions founded on\r\njust proportions, everything superadded by something that is not as\r\nregular as law, and as uniform in its operation, will become more or\r\nless out of proportion. If, on the contrary, the law be not made upon\r\nproper calculation, it is a disgrace to the public; wisdom, which fails\r\nin skill to assess the citizen in just measure and according to his\r\nmeans. But the hand of authority is not always the most heavy hand. It\r\nis obvious that men may be oppressed by many ways besides those which\r\ntake their course from the supreme power of the state. Suppose the\r\npayment to be wholly discretionary. Whatever has its origin in caprice\r\nis sure not to improve in its progress, nor to end in reason. It is\r\nimpossible for each private individual to have any measure conformable\r\nto the particular condition of each of his fellow-citizens, or to the\r\ngeneral exigencies of his country. 'Tis a random shot at best.\r\n\r\nWhen men proceed in this irregular mode, the first contributor is apt to\r\ngrow peevish with his neighbors. He is but too well disposed to measure\r\ntheir means by his own envy, and not by the real state of their\r\nfortunes, which he can rarely know, and which it may in them be an act\r\nof the grossest imprudence to reveal. Hence the odium and lassitude with\r\nwhich people will look upon a provision for the public which is bought\r\nby discord at the expense of social quiet. Hence the bitter\r\nheart-burnings, and the war of tongues, which is so often the prelude to\r\nother wars. Nor is it every contribution, called voluntary, which is\r\naccording to the free will of the giver. A false shame, or a false\r\nglory, against his feelings and his judgment, may tax an individual to\r\nthe detriment of his family and in wrong of his creditors. A pretence of\r\npublic spirit may disable him from the performance of his private\r\nduties; it may disable him even from paying the legitimate contributions\r\nwhich he is to furnish according to the prescript of law. But what is\r\nthe most dangerous of all is that malignant disposition to which this\r\nmode of contribution evidently tends, and which at length leaves the\r\ncomparatively indigent to judge of the wealth, and to prescribe to the\r\nopulent, or those whom they conceive to be such, the use they are to\r\nmake of their fortunes. From thence it is but one step to the\r\nsubversion of all property.\r\n\r\nFar, very far, am I from supposing that such things enter into the\r\npurposes of those excellent persons whose zeal has led them to this kind\r\nof measure; but the measure itself will lead them beyond their\r\nintention, and what is begun with the best designs bad men will\r\nperversely improve to the worst of their purposes. An ill-founded\r\nplausibility in great affairs is a real evil. In France we have seen the\r\nwickedest and most foolish of men, the constitution-mongers of 1789,\r\npursuing this very course, and ending in this very event. These\r\nprojectors of deception set on foot two modes of voluntary contribution\r\nto the state. The first they called patriotic gifts. These, for the\r\ngreater part, were not more ridiculous in the mode than contemptible in\r\nthe project. The other, which they called the patriotic contribution,\r\nwas expected to amount to a fourth of the fortunes of individuals, but\r\nat their own will and on their own estimate; but this contribution\r\nthreatening to fall infinitely short of their hopes, they soon made it\r\ncompulsory, both in the rate and in the levy, beginning in fraud, and\r\nending, as all the frauds of power end, in plain violence. All these\r\ndevices to produce an involuntary will were under the pretext of\r\nrelieving the more indigent classes; but the principle of voluntary\r\ncontribution, however delusive, being once established, these lower\r\nclasses first, and then all classes, were encouraged to throw off the\r\nregular, methodical payments to the state, as so many badges of slavery.\r\nThus all regular revenue failing, these impostors, raising the\r\nsuperstructure on the same cheats with which they had laid the\r\nfoundation of their greatness, and not content with a portion of the\r\npossessions of the rich, confiscated the whole, and, to prevent them\r\nfrom reclaiming their rights, murdered the proprietors. The whole of the\r\nprocess has passed before our eyes, and been conducted, indeed, with a\r\ngreater degree of rapidity than could be expected.\r\n\r\nMy opinion, then, is, that public contributions ought only to be raised\r\nby the public will. By the judicious form of our Constitution, the\r\npublic contribution is in its name and substance a grant. In its origin\r\nit is truly voluntary: not voluntary according to the irregular,\r\nunsteady, capricious will of individuals, but according to the will and\r\nwisdom of the whole popular mass, in the only way in which will and\r\nwisdom can go together. This voluntary grant obtaining in its progress\r\nthe force of a law, a general necessity, which takes away all merit, and\r\nconsequently all jealousy from individuals, compresses, equalizes, and\r\nsatisfies the whole, suffering no man to judge of his neighbor or to\r\narrogate anything to himself. If their will complies with their\r\nobligation, the great end is answered in the happiest mode; if the will\r\nresists the burden, every one loses a great part of his own will as a\r\ncommon lot. After all, perhaps, contributions raised by a charge on\r\nluxury, or that degree of convenience which approaches so near as to be\r\nconfounded with luxury, is the only mode of contribution which may be\r\nwith truth termed voluntary.\r\n\r\nI might rest here, and take the loan I speak of as leading to a solution\r\nof that question which I proposed in my first letter: \"Whether the\r\ninability of the country to prosecute the war did necessitate a\r\nsubmission to the indignities and the calamities of a peace with the\r\nRegicide power?\" But give me leave to pursue this point a little\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nI know that it has been a cry usual on this occasion, as it has been\r\nupon occasions where such a cry could have less apparent justification,\r\nthat great distress and misery have been the consequence of this war, by\r\nthe burdens brought and laid upon the people. But to know where the\r\nburden really lies, and where it presses, we must divide the people. As\r\nto the common people, their stock is in their persons and in their\r\nearnings. I deny that the stock of their persons is diminished in a\r\ngreater proportion than the common sources of populousness abundantly\r\nfill up: I mean constant employment; proportioned pay according to the\r\nproduce of the soil, and, where the soil fails, according to the\r\noperation of the general capital; plentiful nourishment to vigorous\r\nlabor; comfortable provision to decrepit age, to orphan infancy, and to\r\naccidental malady. I say nothing to the policy of the provision for the\r\npoor, in all the variety of faces under which it presents itself. This\r\nis the matter of another inquiry. I only just speak of it as of a fact,\r\ntaken with others, to support me in my denial that hitherto any one of\r\nthe ordinary sources of the increase of mankind is dried up by this war.\r\nI affirm, what I can well prove, that the waste has been less than the\r\nsupply. To say that in war no man must be killed is to say that there\r\nought to be no war. This they may say who wish to talk idly, and who\r\nwould display their humanity at the expense of their honesty or their\r\nunderstanding. If more lives are lost in this war than necessity\r\nrequires, they are lost by misconduct or mistake: but if the hostility\r\nbe just, the error is to be corrected, the war is not to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThat the stock of the common people, in numbers, is not lessened, any\r\nmore than the causes are impaired, is manifest, without being at the\r\npains of an actual numeration. An improved and improving agriculture,\r\nwhich implies a great augmentation of labor, has not yet found itself at\r\na stand, no, not for a single moment, for want of the necessary hands,\r\neither in the settled progress of husbandry or in the occasional\r\npressure of harvests. I have even reason to believe that there has been\r\na much smaller importation, or the demand of it, from a neighboring\r\nkingdom, than in former times, when agriculture was more limited in its\r\nextent and its means, and when the time was a season of profound peace.\r\nOn the contrary, the prolific fertility of country life has poured its\r\nsuperfluity of population into the canals, and into other public works,\r\nwhich of late years have been undertaken to so amazing an extent, and\r\nwhich have not only not been discontinued, but, beyond all expectation,\r\npushed on with redoubled vigor, in a war that calls for so many of our\r\nmen and so much of our riches. An increasing capital calls for labor,\r\nand an increasing population answers to the call. Our manufactures,\r\naugmented both for the supply of foreign and domestic consumption,\r\nreproducing, with the means of life, the multitudes which they use and\r\nwaste, (and which many of them devour much more surely and much more\r\nlargely than the war,) have always found the laborious hand ready for\r\nthe liberal pay. That the price of the soldier is highly raised is true.\r\nIn part this rise may be owing to some measures not so well considered\r\nin the beginning of this war; but the grand cause has been the\r\nreluctance of that class of people from whom the soldiery is taken to\r\nenter into a military life,--not that, but, once entered into, it has\r\nits conveniences, and even its pleasures. I have seldom known a soldier\r\nwho, at the intercession of his friends, and at their no small charge,\r\nhad been redeemed from that discipline, that in a short time was not\r\neager to return to it again. But the true reason is the abundant\r\noccupation and the augmented stipend found in towns and villages and\r\nfarms, which leaves a smaller number of persons to be disposed of. The\r\nprice of men for new and untried ways of life must bear a proportion to\r\nthe profits of that mode of existence from whence they are to be bought.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the stock of the common people, as it consists in their\r\npersons. As to the other part, which consists in their earnings, I have\r\nto say, that the rates of wages are very greatly augmented almost\r\nthrough the kingdom. In the parish where I live it has been raised from\r\nseven to nine shillings in the week, for the same laborer, performing\r\nthe same task, and no greater. Except something in the malt taxes and\r\nthe duties upon sugars, I do not know any one tax imposed for very many\r\nyears past which affects the laborer in any degree whatsoever; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the tax upon houses not having more than seven windows\r\n(that is, upon cottages) was repealed the very year before the\r\ncommencement of the present war. On the whole, I am satisfied that the\r\nhumblest class, and that class which touches the most nearly on the\r\nlowest, out of which it is continually emerging, and to which it is\r\ncontinually falling, receives far more from public impositions than it\r\npays. That class receives two million sterling annually from the\r\nclasses above it. It pays to no such amount towards any public\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nI hope it is not necessary for me to take notice of that language, so\r\nill suited to the persons to whom it has been attributed, and so\r\nunbecoming the place in which it is said to have been uttered,\r\nconcerning the present war as the cause of the high price of provisions\r\nduring the greater part of the year 1796. I presume it is only to be\r\nascribed to the intolerable license with which the newspapers break not\r\nonly the rules of decorum in real life, but even the dramatic decorum,\r\nwhen they personate great men, and, like bad poets, make the heroes of\r\nthe piece talk more like us Grub-Street scribblers than in a style\r\nconsonant to persons of gravity and importance in the state. It was easy\r\nto demonstrate the cause, and the sole cause, of that rise in the grand\r\narticle and first necessary of life. It would appear that it had no more\r\nconnection with the war than the moderate price to which all sorts of\r\ngrain were reduced, soon after the return of Lord Malmesbury, had with\r\nthe state of politics and the fate of his Lordship's treaty. I have\r\nquite as good reason (that is, no reason at all) to attribute this\r\nabundance to the longer continuance of the war as the gentlemen who\r\npersonate leading members of Parliament have had for giving the enhanced\r\nprice to that war, at a more early period of its duration. Oh, the folly\r\nof us poor creatures, who, in the midst of our distresses or our\r\nescapes, are ready to claw or caress one another, upon matters that so\r\nseldom depend on our wisdom or our weakness, on our good or evil conduct\r\ntowards each other!\r\n\r\nAn untimely shower or an unseasonable drought, a frost too long\r\ncontinued or too suddenly broken up with rain and tempest, the blight of\r\nthe spring or the smut of the harvest will do more to cause the distress\r\nof the belly than all the contrivances of all statesmen can do to\r\nrelieve it. Let government protect and encourage industry, secure\r\nproperty, repress violence, and discountenance fraud, it is all that\r\nthey have to do. In other respects, the less they meddle in these\r\naffairs, the better; the rest is in the hands of our Master and theirs.\r\nWe are in a constitution of things wherein \"_modo sol nimius, modo\r\ncorripit imber_.\"--But I will push this matter no further. As I have\r\nsaid a good deal upon it at various times during my public service, and\r\nhave lately written something on it, which may yet see the light, I\r\nshall content myself now with observing that the vigorous and laborious\r\nclass of life has lately got, from the _bon-ton_ of the humanity of this\r\nday, the name of the \"_laboring poor_.\" We have heard many plans for the\r\nrelief of the \"_laboring poor_.\" This puling jargon is not as innocent\r\nas it is foolish. In meddling with great affairs, weakness is never\r\ninnoxious. Hitherto the name of poor (in the sense in which it is used\r\nto excite compassion) has not been used for those who can, but for those\r\nwho cannot labor,--for the sick and infirm, for orphan infancy, for\r\nlanguishing and decrepit age; but when we affect to pity, as poor, those\r\nwho must labor or the world cannot exist, we are trifling with the\r\ncondition of mankind. It is the common doom of man, that he must eat his\r\nbread by the sweat of his brow,--that is, by the sweat of his body or\r\nthe sweat of his mind. If this toil was inflicted as a curse, it is, as\r\nmight be expected, from the curses of the Father of all blessings; it is\r\ntempered with many alleviations, many comforts. Every attempt to fly\r\nfrom it, and to refuse the very terms of our existence, becomes much\r\nmore truly a curse; and heavier pains and penalties fall upon those who\r\nwould elude the tasks which are put upon them by the great Master\r\nWorkman of the world, who, in His dealings with His creatures,\r\nsympathizes with their weakness, and, speaking of a creation wrought by\r\nmere will out of nothing, speaks of six days of _labor_ and one of\r\n_rest_. I do not call a healthy young man, cheerful in his mind and\r\nvigorous in his arms, I cannot call such a man _poor_; I cannot pity my\r\nkind as a kind, merely because they are men. This affected pity only\r\ntends to dissatisfy them with their condition, and to teach them to seek\r\nresources where no resources are to be found, in something else than\r\ntheir own industry and frugality and sobriety. Whatever may be the\r\nintention (which, because I do not know, I cannot dispute) of those who\r\nwould discontent mankind by this strange pity, they act towards us, in\r\nthe consequences, as if they were our worst enemies.\r\n\r\nIn turning our view from the lower to the higher classes, it will not be\r\nnecessary for me to show at any length that the stock of the latter, as\r\nit consists in their numbers, has not yet suffered any material\r\ndiminution. I have not seen or heard it asserted; I have no reason to\r\nbelieve it: there is no want of officers, that I have ever understood,\r\nfor the new ships which we commission, or the new regiments which we\r\nraise. In the nature of things, it is not with their persons that the\r\nhigher classes principally pay their contingent to the demands of war.\r\nThere is another, and not less important part, which rests with almost\r\nexclusive weight upon them. They furnish the means\r\n\r\n        \"how War may, best upheld,\r\n    Move by her two main nerves, iron and gold,\r\n    In all her equipage.\"\r\n\r\nNot that they are exempt from contributing also by their personal\r\nservice in the fleets and armies of their country. They do contribute,\r\nand in their full and fair proportion, according to the relative\r\nproportion of their numbers in the community. They contribute all the\r\nmind that actuates the whole machine. The fortitude required of them is\r\nvery different from the unthinking alacrity of the common soldier or\r\ncommon sailor in the face of danger and death: it is not a passion, it\r\nis not an impulse, it is not a sentiment; it is a cool, steady,\r\ndeliberate principle, always present, always equable,--having no\r\nconnection with anger,--tempering honor with prudence,--incited,\r\ninvigorated, and sustained by a generous love of fame,--informed,\r\nmoderated, and directed by an enlarged knowledge of its own great public\r\nends,--flowing in one blended stream from the opposite sources of the\r\nheart and the head,--carrying in itself its own commission, and proving\r\nits title to every other command by the first and most difficult\r\ncommand, that of the bosom in which it resides: it is a fortitude which\r\nunites with the courage of the field the more exalted and refined\r\ncourage of the council,--which knows as well to retreat as to\r\nadvance,--which can conquer as well by delay as by the rapidity of a\r\nmarch or the impetuosity of an attack,--which can be, with Fabius, the\r\nblack cloud that lowers on the tops of the mountains, or, with Scipio,\r\nthe thunderbolt of war,--which, undismayed by false shame, can patiently\r\nendure the severest trial that a gallant spirit can undergo, in the\r\ntaunts and provocations of the enemy, the suspicions, the cold respect,\r\nand \"mouth honor\" of those from whom it should meet a cheerful\r\nobedience,--which, undisturbed by false humanity, can calmly assume that\r\nmost awful moral responsibility of deciding when victory may be too\r\ndearly purchased by the loss of a single life, and when the safety and\r\nglory of their country may demand the certain sacrifice of thousands.\r\nDifferent stations of command may call for different modifications of\r\nthis fortitude, but the character ought to be the same in all. And\r\nnever, in the most \"palmy state\" of our martial renown, did it shine\r\nwith brighter lustre than in the present sanguinary and ferocious\r\nhostilities, wherever the British arms have been carried. But in this\r\nmost arduous and momentous conflict, which from its nature should have\r\nroused us to new and unexampled efforts, I know not how it has been that\r\nwe have never put forth half the strength which we have exerted in\r\nordinary wars. In the fatal battles which have drenched the Continent\r\nwith blood and shaken the system of Europe to pieces, we have never had\r\nany considerable army, of a magnitude to be compared to the least of\r\nthose by which in former times we so gloriously asserted our place as\r\nprotectors, not oppressors, at the head of the great commonwealth of\r\nEurope. We have never manfully met the danger in front; and when the\r\nenemy, resigning to us our natural dominion of the ocean, and abandoning\r\nthe defence of his distant possessions to the infernal energy of the\r\ndestroying principles which he had planted there for the subversion of\r\nthe neighboring colonies, drove forth, by one sweeping law of\r\nunprecedented despotism, his armed multitudes on every side, to\r\noverwhelm the countries and states which had for centuries stood the\r\nfirm barriers against the ambition of France, we drew back the arm of\r\nour military force, which had never been more than half raised to oppose\r\nhim. From that time we have been combating only with the other arm of\r\nour naval power,--the right arm of England, I admit,--but which struck\r\nalmost unresisted, with blows that could never reach the heart of the\r\nhostile mischief. From that time, without a single effort to regain\r\nthose outworks which ever till now we so strenuously maintained, as the\r\nstrong frontier of our own dignity and safety no less than the liberties\r\nof Europe,--with but one feeble attempt to succor those brave, faithful,\r\nand numerous allies, whom, for the first time since the days of our\r\nEdwards and Henrys, we now have in the bosom of France itself,--we have\r\nbeen intrenching and fortifying and garrisoning ourselves at home, we\r\nhave been redoubling security on security to protect ourselves from\r\ninvasion, which has now first become to us a serious object of alarm and\r\nterror. Alas! the few of us who have protracted life in any measure near\r\nto the extreme limits of our short period have been condemned to see\r\nstrange things,--new systems of policy, new principles, and not only new\r\nmen, but what might appear a new species of men. I believe that any\r\nperson who was of age to take a part in public affairs forty years ago\r\n(if the intermediate space of time were expunged from his memory) would\r\nhardly credit his senses, when he should hear from the highest authority\r\nthat an army of two hundred thousand men was kept up in this island, and\r\nthat in the neighboring island there were at least fourscore thousand\r\nmore. But when he had recovered from his surprise on being told of this\r\narmy, which has not its parallel, what must be his astonishment to be\r\ntold again that this mighty force was kept up for the mere purpose of an\r\ninert and passive defence, and that in its far greater part it was\r\ndisabled by its constitution and very essence from defending us against\r\nan enemy by any one preventive stroke or any one operation of active\r\nhostility? What must his reflections be, on learning further, that a\r\nfleet of five hundred men of war, the best appointed, and to the full as\r\nably commanded as this country ever had upon the sea, was for the\r\ngreater part employed in carrying on the same system of unenterprising\r\ndefence? What must be the sentiments and feelings of one who remembers\r\nthe former energy of England, when he is given to understand that these\r\ntwo islands, with their extensive and everywhere vulnerable coast,\r\nshould be considered as a garrisoned sea-town? What would such a man,\r\nwhat would any man think, if the garrison of so strange a fortress\r\nshould be such, and so feebly commanded, as never to make a sally,--and\r\nthat, contrary to all which has hitherto been seen in war, an infinitely\r\ninferior army, with the shattered relics of an almost annihilated navy,\r\nill-found and ill-manned, may with safety besiege this superior\r\ngarrison, and, without hazarding the life of a man, ruin the place,\r\nmerely by the menaces and false appearances of an attack? Indeed,\r\nindeed, my dear friend, I look upon this matter of our defensive system\r\nas much the most important of all considerations at this moment. It has\r\noppressed me with many anxious thoughts, which, more than any bodily\r\ndistemper, have sunk me to the condition in which you know that I am.\r\nShould it please Providence to restore to me even the late weak remains\r\nof my strength, I propose to make this matter the subject of a\r\nparticular discussion. I only mean here to argue, that the mode of\r\nconducting the war on our part, be it good or bad, has prevented even\r\nthe common havoc of war in our population, and especially among that\r\nclass whose duty and privilege of superiority it is to lead the way\r\namidst the perils and slaughter of the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe other causes which sometimes affect the numbers of the lower\r\nclasses, but which I have shown not to have existed to any such degree\r\nduring this war,--penury, cold, hunger, nakedness,--do not easily reach\r\nthe higher orders of society. I do not dread for them the slightest\r\ntaste of these calamities from the distress and pressure of the war.\r\nThey have much more to dread in that way from the confiscations, the\r\nrapines, the burnings, and the massacres that may follow in the train of\r\na peace which shall establish the devastating and depopulating\r\nprinciples and example of the French Regicides in security and triumph\r\nand dominion. In the ordinary course of human affairs, any check to\r\npopulation among men in ease and opulence is less to be apprehended from\r\nwhat they may suffer than from what they enjoy. Peace is more likely to\r\nbe injurious to them in that respect than war. The excesses of delicacy,\r\nrepose, and satiety are as unfavorable as the extremes of hardship,\r\ntoil, and want to the increase and multiplication of our kind. Indeed,\r\nthe abuse of the bounties of Nature, much more surely than any partial\r\nprivation of them, tends to intercept that precious boon of a second\r\nand dearer life in our progeny, which was bestowed in the first great\r\ncommand to man from the All-Gracious Giver of all,--whose name be\r\nblessed, whether He gives or takes away! His hand, in every page of His\r\nbook, has written the lesson of moderation. Our physical well-being, our\r\nmoral worth, our social happiness, our political tranquillity, all\r\ndepend on that control of all our appetites and passions which the\r\nancients designed by the cardinal virtue of _temperance_.\r\n\r\nThe only real question to our present purpose, with regard to the higher\r\nclasses, is, How stands the account of their stock, as it consists in\r\nwealth of every description? Have the burdens of the war compelled them\r\nto curtail any part of their former expenditure?--which, I have before\r\nobserved, affords the only standard of estimating property as an object\r\nof taxation. Do they enjoy all the same conveniences, the same comforts,\r\nthe same elegancies, the same luxuries, in the same or in as many\r\ndifferent modes as they did before the war?\r\n\r\nIn the last eleven years there have been no less than three solemn\r\ninquiries into the finances of the kingdom, by three different\r\ncommittees of your House. The first was in the year 1786. On that\r\noccasion, I remember, the report of the committee was examined, and\r\nsifted and bolted to the bran, by a gentleman whose keen and powerful\r\ntalents I have ever admired. He thought there was not sufficient\r\nevidence to warrant the pleasing representation which the committee had\r\nmade of our national prosperity. He did not believe that our public\r\nrevenue could continue to be so productive as they had assumed. He even\r\nwent the length of recording his own inferences of doubt in a set of\r\nresolutions which now stand upon your journals. And perhaps the\r\nretrospect on which the report proceeded did not go far enough back to\r\nallow any sure and satisfactory average for a ground of solid\r\ncalculation. But what was the event? When the next committee sat, in\r\n1791, they found, that, on an average of the last four years, their\r\npredecessors had fallen short, in their estimate of the permanent taxes,\r\nby more than three hundred and forty thousand pounds a year. Surely,\r\nthen, if I can show, that, in the produce of those same taxes, and more\r\nparticularly of such as affect articles of luxurious use and\r\nconsumption, the four years of the war have equalled those four years of\r\npeace, flourishing as they were beyond the most sanguine speculations, I\r\nmay expect to hear no more of the distress occasioned by the war.\r\n\r\nThe additional burdens which have been laid on some of those same\r\narticles might reasonably claim some allowance to be made. Every new\r\nadvance of the price to the consumer is a new incentive to him to\r\nretrench the quantity of his consumption; and if, upon the whole, he\r\npays the same, his property, computed by the standard of what he\r\nvoluntarily pays, must remain the same. But I am willing to forego that\r\nfair advantage in the inquiry. I am willing that the receipts of the\r\npermanent taxes which existed before January, 1793, should be compared\r\nduring the war, and during the period of peace which I have mentioned. I\r\nwill go further. Complete accounts of the year 1791 were separately laid\r\nbefore your House. I am ready to stand by a comparison of the produce of\r\nfour years up to the beginning of the year 1792 with that of the war. Of\r\nthe year immediately previous to hostilities I have not been able to\r\nobtain any perfect documents; but I have seen enough to satisfy me,\r\nthat, although a comparison including that year might be less favorable,\r\nyet it would not essentially injure my argument.\r\n\r\nYou will always bear in mind, my dear Sir, that I am not considering\r\nwhether, if the common enemy of the quiet of Europe had not forced us to\r\ntake up arms in our own defence, the spring-tide of our prosperity might\r\nnot have flowed higher than the mark at which it now stands. That\r\nconsideration is connected with the question of the justice and the\r\nnecessity of the war. It is a question which I have long since\r\ndiscussed. I am now endeavoring to ascertain whether there exists, in\r\nfact, any such necessity as we hear every day asserted, to furnish a\r\nmiserable pretext for counselling us to surrender at discretion our\r\nconquests, our honor, our dignity, our very independence, and, with it,\r\nall that is dear to man. It will be more than sufficient for that\r\npurpose, if I can make it appear that we have been stationary during the\r\nwar. What, then, will be said, if, in reality, it shall be proved that\r\nthere is every indication of increased and increasing wealth, not only\r\npoured into the grand reservoir of the national capital, but diffused\r\nthrough all the channels of all the higher classes, and giving life and\r\nactivity, as it passes, to the agriculture, the manufactures, the\r\ncommerce, and the navigation of the country?\r\n\r\nThe Finance Committee which has been appointed in this session has\r\nalready made two reports. Every conclusion that I had before drawn, as\r\nyou know, from my own observation, I have the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthere confirmed by that great public authority. Large as was the sum by\r\nwhich the committee of 1791 found the estimate of 1786 to have been\r\nexceeded in the actual produce of four years of peace, their own\r\nestimate has been exceeded during the war by a sum more than one third\r\nlarger. The same taxes have yielded more than half a million beyond\r\ntheir calculation. They yielded this, notwithstanding the stoppage of\r\nthe distilleries, against which, you may remember, I privately\r\nremonstrated. With an allowance for that defalcation, they have yielded\r\nsixty thousand pounds annually above the actual average of the preceding\r\nfour years of peace. I believe this to have been without parallel in all\r\nformer wars. If regard be had to the great and unavoidable burdens of\r\nthe present war, I am confident of the fact.\r\n\r\nBut let us descend to particulars. The taxes which go by the general\r\nname of Assessed Taxes comprehend the whole, or nearly the whole,\r\ndomestic establishment of the rich. They include some things which\r\nbelong to the middling, and even to all but the very lowest classes.\r\nThey now consist of the duties on houses and windows, on male servants,\r\nhorses, and carriages. They did also extend to cottages, to female\r\nservants, wagons, and carts used in husbandry, previous to the year\r\n1792,--when, with more enlightened policy, at the moment that the\r\npossibility of war could not be out of the contemplation of any\r\nstatesman, the wisdom of Parliament confined them to their present\r\nobjects. I shall give the gross assessment for five years, as I find it\r\nin the Appendix to the Second Report of your committee.\r\n\r\n1791 ending 5th April 1792  £1,706,334\r\n1792                  1793   1,585,991\r\n1793                  1794   1,597,623\r\n1794                  1795   1,608,196\r\n1795                  1796   1,625,874\r\n\r\nHere will be seen a gradual increase during the whole progress of the\r\nwar; and if I am correctly informed, the rise in the last year, after\r\nevery deduction that can be made, affords the most consoling and\r\nencouraging prospect. It is enormously out of all proportion.\r\n\r\nThere are some other taxes which seem to have a reference to the same\r\ngeneral head. The present minister many years ago subjected bricks and\r\ntiles to a duty under the excise. It is of little consequence to our\r\npresent consideration, whether these materials have been employed in\r\nbuilding more commodious, more elegant, and more magnificent\r\nhabitations, or in enlarging, decorating, and remodelling those which\r\nsufficed for our plainer ancestors. During the first two years of the\r\nwar, they paid so largely to the public revenue, that in 1794 a new duty\r\nwas laid upon them, which was equal to one half of the old, and which\r\nhas produced upwards of 165,000_l._ in the last three years. Yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the pressure of this additional weight,[40] there has\r\nbeen an actual augmentation in the consumption. The only two other\r\narticles which come under this description are the stamp-duty on gold\r\nand silver plate, and the customs on glass plates. This latter is now, I\r\nbelieve, the single instance of costly furniture to be found in the\r\ncatalogue of our imports. If it were wholly to vanish, I should not\r\nthink we were ruined. Both the duties have risen, during the war, very\r\nconsiderably in proportion to the total of their produce.\r\n\r\nWe have no tax among us on the most necessary articles of food. The\r\nreceipts of our Custom-House, under the head of Groceries, afford us,\r\nhowever, some means of calculating our luxuries of the table. The\r\narticles of tea, coffee, and cocoa-nuts I would propose to omit, and to\r\ntake them instead from the excise, as best showing what is consumed at\r\nhome. Upon this principle, adding them all together, (with the exception\r\nof sugar, for a reason which I shall afterwards mention,) I find that\r\nthey have produced, in one mode of comparison, upwards of 272,000_l._,\r\nand in the other mode upwards of 165,000_l._, more during the war than\r\nin peace.[41] An additional duty was also laid in 1795 on tea, another\r\non coffee, and a third on raisins,--an article, together with currants,\r\nof much more extensive use than would readily be imagined. The balance\r\nin favor of our argument would have been much enhanced, if our coffee\r\nand fruit ships from the Mediterranean had arrived, last year, at their\r\nusual season. They do not appear in these accounts. This was one\r\nconsequence arising (would to God that none more afflicting to Italy, to\r\nEurope, and the whole civilized world had arisen!) from our impolitic\r\nand precipitate desertion of that important maritime station. As to\r\nsugar,[42] I have excluded it from the groceries, because the account of\r\nthe customs is not a perfect criterion of the consumption, much having\r\nbeen reëxported to the North of Europe, which used to be supplied by\r\nFrance; and in the official papers which I have followed there are no\r\nmaterials to furnish grounds for computing this reëxportation. The\r\nincrease on the face of our entries is immense during the four years of\r\nwar,--little short of thirteen hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the duties on beer has been regularly progressive, or\r\nnearly so, to a very large amount.[43] It is a good deal above a\r\nmillion, and is more than equal to one eighth of the whole produce.\r\nUnder this general head some other liquors are included,--cider, perry,\r\nand mead, as well as vinegar and verjuice; but these are of very\r\ntrifling consideration. The excise duties on wine, having sunk a little\r\nduring the first two years of the war, were rapidly recovering their\r\nlevel again. In 1795 a heavy additional duty was imposed upon them, and\r\na second in the following year; yet, being compared with four years of\r\npeace to 1790, they actually exhibit a small gain to the revenue. And\r\nlow as the importation may seem in 1796, when contrasted with any year\r\nsince the French treaty in 1787, it is still more than 3000 tuns above\r\nthe average importation for three years previous to that period. I have\r\nadded sweets, from which our factitious wines are made; and I would have\r\nadded spirits, but that the total alteration of the duties in 1789, and\r\nthe recent interruption of our distilleries, rendered any comparison\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nThe ancient staple of our island, in which we are clothed, is very\r\nimperfectly to be traced on the books of the Custom-House: but I know\r\nthat our woollen manufactures flourish. I recollect to have seen that\r\nfact very fully established, last year, from the registers kept in the\r\nWest Riding of Yorkshire. This year, in the West of England, I received\r\na similar account, on the authority of a respectable clothier in that\r\nquarter, whose testimony can less be questioned, because, in his\r\npolitical opinions, he is adverse, as I understand, to the continuance\r\nof the war. The principal articles of female dress for some time past\r\nhave been muslins and calicoes.[44] These elegant fabrics of our own\r\nlooms in the East, which serve for the remittance of our own revenues,\r\nhave lately been imitated at home, with improving success, by the\r\ningenious and enterprising manufacturers of Manchester, Paisley, and\r\nGlasgow. At the same time the importation from Bengal has kept pace with\r\nthe extension of our own dexterity and industry; while the sale of our\r\nprinted goods,[45] of both kinds, has been with equal steadiness\r\nadvanced by the taste and execution of our designers and artists. Our\r\nwoollens and cottons, it is true, are not all for the home market. They\r\ndo not distinctly prove, what is my present point, our own wealth by our\r\nown expense. I admit it: we export them in great and growing quantities:\r\nand they who croak themselves hoarse about the decay of our trade may\r\nput as much of this account as they choose to the creditor side of money\r\nreceived from other countries in payment for British skill and labor.\r\nThey may settle the items to their own liking, where all goes to\r\ndemonstrate our riches. I shall be contented here with whatever they\r\nwill have the goodness to leave me, and pass to another entry, which is\r\nless ambiguous,--I mean that of silk.[46] The manufactory itself is a\r\nforced plant. We have been obliged to guard it from foreign competition\r\nby very strict prohibitory laws. What we import is the raw and prepared\r\nmaterial, which is worked up in various ways, and worn in various shapes\r\nby both sexes. After what we have just seen, you will probably be\r\nsurprised to learn that the quantity of silk imported during the war has\r\nbeen much greater than it was previously in peace; and yet we must all\r\nremember, to our mortification, that several of our silk ships fell a\r\nprey to Citizen Admiral Richery. You will hardly expect me to go through\r\nthe tape and thread, and all the other small wares of haberdashery and\r\nmillinery to be gleaned up among our imports. But I shall make one\r\nobservation, and with great satisfaction, respecting them. They\r\ngradually diminish, as our own manufactures of the same description\r\nspread into their places; while the account of ornamental articles which\r\nour country does not produce, and we cannot wish it to produce,\r\ncontinues, upon the whole, to rise, in spite of all the caprices of\r\nfancy and fashion. Of this kind are the different furs[47] used for\r\nmuffs, trimmings, and linings, which, as the chief of the kind, I shall\r\nparticularize. You will find them below.\r\n\r\nThe diversions of the higher classes form another and the only\r\nremaining head of inquiry into their expenses: I mean those diversions\r\nwhich distinguish the country and the town life,--which are visible and\r\ntangible to the statesman,--which have some public measure and standard.\r\nAnd here, when, I look to the report of your committee, I, for the first\r\ntime, perceive a failure. It is clearly so. Whichever way I reckon the\r\nfour years of peace, the old tax on the sports of the field has\r\ncertainly proved deficient since the war. The same money, however, or\r\nnearly the same, has been paid to government,--though the same number of\r\nindividuals have not contributed to the payment. An additional tax was\r\nlaid in 1791, and during the war has produced upwards of 61,000_l._,\r\nwhich is about 4000_l._ more than the decrease of the old tax, in one\r\nscheme of comparison, and about 4000_l._ less, in the other scheme. I\r\nmight remark, that the amount of the new tax, in the several years of\r\nthe war, by no means bears the proportion which it ought to the old.\r\nThere seems to be some great irregularity or other in the receipt. But I\r\ndo not think it worth while to examine into the argument. I am willing\r\nto suppose that many, who, in the idleness of peace, made war upon\r\npartridges, hares, and pheasants, may now carry more noble arms against\r\nthe enemies of their country. Our political adversaries may do what they\r\nplease with that concession. They are welcome to make the most of it. I\r\nam sure of a very handsome set-off in the other branch of expense,--the\r\namusements of a town life.\r\n\r\nThere is much gayety and dissipation and profusion which must escape and\r\ndisappoint all the arithmetic of political economy. But the theatres are\r\na prominent feature. They are established through every part of the\r\nkingdom, at a cost unknown till our days. There is hardly a provincial\r\ncapital which does not possess, or which does not aspire to possess, a\r\ntheatre-royal. Most of them engage for a short time, at a vast price,\r\nevery actor or actress of name in the metropolis: a distinction which in\r\nthe reign of my old friend Garrick was confined to very few. The\r\ndresses, the scenes, the decorations of every kind, I am told, are in a\r\nnew style of splendor and magnificence: whether to the advantage of our\r\ndramatic taste, upon the whole, I very much doubt. It is a show and a\r\nspectacle, not a play, that is exhibited. This is undoubtedly in the\r\ngenuine manner of the Augustan age, but in a manner which was censured\r\nby one of the best poets and critics of that or any age:--\r\n\r\n            Migravit ab aure voluptas\r\n    Omnis ad incertos oculos, et gaudia vana:\r\n    Quatuor aut plures aulæa premuntur in horas,\r\n    Dum fugiunt equitum turmæ, peditumque catervæ;--\r\n\r\nI must interrupt the passage, most fervently to deprecate and abominate\r\nthe sequel:--\r\n\r\n    Mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis.\r\n\r\nI hope that no French fraternization, which the relations of peace and\r\namity with systematized regicide would assuredly sooner or later draw\r\nafter them, even if it should overturn our happy Constitution itself,\r\ncould so change the hearts of Englishmen as to make them delight in\r\nrepresentations and processions which have no other merit than that of\r\ndegrading and insulting the name of royalty. But good taste, manners,\r\nmorals, religion, all fly, wherever the principles of Jacobinism enter;\r\nand we have no safety against them but in arms.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors, whether in this they follow or lead what is called the\r\ntown, to furnish out these gaudy and pompous entertainments, must\r\ncollect so much more from the public. It was but just before the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities, that they levied for themselves the very\r\ntax which, at the close of the American war, they represented to Lord\r\nNorth as certain ruin to their affairs to demand for the state. The\r\nexample has since been imitated by the managers of our Italian Opera.\r\nOnce during the war, if not twice, (I would not willingly misstate\r\nanything, but I am not very accurate on these subjects,) they have\r\nraised the price of their subscription. Yet I have never heard that any\r\nlasting dissatisfaction has been manifested, or that their houses have\r\nbeen unusually and constantly thin. On the contrary, all the three\r\ntheatres have been repeatedly altered, and refitted, and enlarged, to\r\nmake them capacious of the crowds that nightly flock to them; and one of\r\nthose huge and lofty piles, which lifts its broad shoulders in gigantic\r\npride, almost emulous of the temples of God, has been reared from the\r\nfoundation at a charge of more than fourscore thousand pounds, and yet\r\nremains a naked, rough, unsightly heap.\r\n\r\nI am afraid, my dear Sir, that I have tired you with these dull, though\r\nimportant details. But we are upon a subject which, like some of a\r\nhigher nature, refuses ornament, and is contented with conveying\r\ninstruction. I know, too, the obstinacy of unbelief in those perverted\r\nminds which have no delight but in contemplating the supposed distress\r\nand predicting the immediate ruin of their country. These birds of evil\r\npresage at all times have grated our ears with their melancholy song;\r\nand, by some strange fatality or other, it has generally happened that\r\nthey have poured forth their loudest and deepest lamentations at the\r\nperiods of our most abundant prosperity. Very early in my public life I\r\nhad occasion to make myself a little acquainted with their natural\r\nhistory. My first political tract in the collection which a friend has\r\nmade of my publications is an answer to a very gloomy picture of the\r\nstate of the nation, which was thought to have been drawn by a statesman\r\nof some eminence in his time. That was no more than the common spleen of\r\ndisappointed ambition: in the present day I fear that too many are\r\nactuated by a more malignant and dangerous spirit. They hope, by\r\ndepressing our minds with a despair of our means and resources, to drive\r\nus, trembling and unresisting, into the toils of our enemies, with whom,\r\nfrom the beginning of the Revolution in France, they have ever moved in\r\nstrict concert and coöperation. If, with the report of your Finance\r\nCommittee in their hands, they can still affect to despond, and can\r\nstill succeed, as they do, in spreading the contagion of their pretended\r\nfears among well-disposed, though weak men, there is no way of\r\ncounteracting them, but by fixing them down to particulars. Nor must we\r\nforget that they are unwearied agitators, bold assertors, dexterous\r\nsophisters. Proof must be accumulated upon proof, to silence them. With\r\nthis view, I shall now direct your attention to some other striking and\r\nunerring indications of our flourishing condition; and they will, in\r\ngeneral, be derived from other sources, but equally authentic: from\r\nother reports and proceedings of both Houses of Parliament, all which\r\nunite with wonderful force of consent in the same general result.\r\nHitherto we have seen the superfluity of our capital discovering itself\r\nonly in procuring superfluous accommodation and enjoyment, in our\r\nhouses, in our furniture, in our establishments, in our eating and\r\ndrinking, our clothing, and our public diversions: we shall now see it\r\nmore beneficially employed in improving our territory itself: we shall\r\nsee part of our present opulence, with provident care, put out to usury\r\nfor posterity.\r\n\r\nTo what ultimate extent it may be wise or practicable to push inclosures\r\nof common and waste lands may be a question of doubt, in some points of\r\nview: but no person thinks them already carried to excess; and the\r\nrelative magnitude of the sums laid out upon them gives us a standard of\r\nestimating the comparative situation of the landed interest. Your House,\r\nthis session, appointed a committee on waste lands, and they have made a\r\nreport by their chairman, an honorable baronet, for whom the minister\r\nthe other day (with very good intentions, I believe, but with little\r\nreal profit to the public) thought fit to erect a board of agriculture.\r\nThe account, as it stands there, appears sufficiently favorable. The\r\ngreatest number of inclosing bills passed in any one year of the last\r\npeace does not equal the smallest annual number in the war, and those of\r\nthe last year exceed by more than one half the highest year of peace.\r\nBut what was my surprise, on looking into the late report of the Secret\r\nCommittee of the Lords, to find a list of these bills during the war,\r\ndiffering in every year, and[48] larger on the whole by nearly one\r\nthird! I have checked this account by the statute-book, and find it to\r\nbe correct. What new brilliancy, then, does it throw over the prospect,\r\nbright as it was before! The number during the last four years has more\r\nthan doubled that of the four years immediately preceding; it has\r\nsurpassed the five years of peace, beyond which the Lords' committees\r\nhave not gone; it has even surpassed (I have verified the fact) the\r\nwhole ten years of peace. I cannot stop here. I cannot advance a single\r\nstep in this inquiry without being obliged to cast my eyes back to the\r\nperiod when I first knew the country. These bills, which had begun in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne, had passed every year in greater or less\r\nnumbers from the year 1723; yet in all that space of time they had not\r\nreached the amount of any two years during the present war; and though\r\nsoon after that time they rapidly increased, still at the accession of\r\nhis present Majesty they were far short of the number passed in the four\r\nyears of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn my first letter I mentioned the state of our inland navigation,\r\nneglected as it had been from the reign of King William to the time of\r\nmy observation. It was not till the present reign that the Duke of\r\nBridgewater's canal first excited a spirit of speculation and adventure\r\nin this way. This spirit showed itself, but necessarily made no great\r\nprogress, in the American war. When peace was restored, it began of\r\ncourse to work with more sensible effect; yet in ten years from that\r\nevent the bills passed on that subject were not so many as from the year\r\n1793 to the present session of Parliament. From what I can trace on the\r\nstatute-book, I am confident that all the capital expended in these\r\nprojects during the peace bore no degree of proportion (I doubt, on\r\nvery grave consideration, whether all that was ever so expended was\r\nequal) to the money which has been raised for the same purposes since\r\nthe war.[49] I know that in the last four years of peace, when they rose\r\nregularly and rapidly, the sums specified in the acts were not near one\r\nthird of the subsequent amount. In the last session of Parliament, the\r\nGrand Junction Company, as it is called, having sunk half a million, (of\r\nwhich I feel the good effects at my own door,) applied to your House for\r\npermission to subscribe half as much more among themselves. This Grand\r\nJunction is an inosculation of the Grand Trunk; and in the present\r\nsession, the latter company has obtained the authority of Parliament to\r\nfloat two hundred acres of land, for the purpose of forming a reservoir,\r\nthirty feet deep, two hundred yards wide at the head, and two miles in\r\nlength: a lake which may almost vie with that which once fed the now\r\nobliterated canal of Languedoc.\r\n\r\nThe present war is, above all others of which we have heard or read, a\r\nwar against landed property. That description of property is in its\r\nnature the firm base of every stable government,--and has been so\r\nconsidered by all the wisest writers of the old philosophy, from the\r\ntime of the Stagyrite, who observes that the agricultural class of all\r\nothers is the least inclined to sedition. We find it to have been so\r\nregarded in the practical politics of antiquity, where they are brought\r\nmore directly homo to our understandings and bosoms in the history of\r\nBorne, and above all, in the writings of Cicero. The country tribes were\r\nalways thought more respectable than those of the city. And if in our\r\nown history there is any one circumstance to which, under God, are to be\r\nattributed the steady resistance, the fortunate issue, and sober\r\nsettlement of all our struggles for liberty, it is, that, while the\r\nlanded interest, instead of forming a separate body, as in other\r\ncountries, has at all times been in close connection and union with the\r\nother great interests of the country, it has been spontaneously allowed\r\nto lead and direct and moderate all the rest. I cannot, therefore, but\r\nsee with singular gratification, that, during a war which has been\r\neminently made for the destruction of the lauded proprietors, as well as\r\nof priests and kings, as much has been done by public works for the\r\npermanent benefit of their stake in this country as in all the rest of\r\nthe current century, which now touches to its close. Perhaps after this\r\nit may not be necessary to refer to private observation; but I am\r\nsatisfied that in general the rents of lands have been considerably\r\nincreased: they are increased very considerably, indeed, if I may draw\r\nany conclusion from my own little property of that kind. I am not\r\nignorant, however, where our public burdens are most galling. But all of\r\nthis class will consider who they are that are principally menaced,--how\r\nlittle the men of their description in other countries, where this\r\nrevolutionary fury has but touched, have been found equal to their own\r\nprotection,--how tardy and unprovided and full of anguish is their\r\nflight, chained down as they are by every tie to the soil,--how\r\nhelpless they are, above all other men, in exile, in poverty, in need,\r\nin all the varieties of wretchedness; and then let them well weigh what\r\nare the burdens to which they ought not to submit for their own\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nMany of the authorities which I have already adduced, or to which I have\r\nreferred, may convey a competent notion of some of our principal\r\nmanufactures. Their general state will be clear from that of our\r\nexternal and internal commerce, through which they circulate, and of\r\nwhich they are at once the cause and effect. But the communication of\r\nthe several parts of the kingdom with each other and with foreign\r\ncountries has always been regarded as one of the most certain tests to\r\nevince the prosperous or adverse state of our trade in all its branches.\r\nRecourse has usually been had to the revenue of the Post-Office with\r\nthis view. I shall include the product of the tax which was laid in the\r\nlast war, and which will make the evidence more conclusive, if it shall\r\nafford the same inference: I allude to the Post-Horse duty, which shows\r\nthe personal intercourse within the kingdom, as the Post-Office shows\r\nthe intercourse by letters both within and without. The first of these\r\nstandards, then, exhibits an increase, according to my former schemes of\r\ncomparison, from an eleventh to a twentieth part of the whole duty.[50]\r\nThe Post-Office gives still less consolation to those who are miserable\r\nin proportion as the country feels no misery. From the commencement of\r\nthe war to the month of April, 1796, the gross produce had increased by\r\nnearly one sixth of the whole sum which the state now derives from that\r\nfund. I find that the year ending 5th of April, 1793, gave 627,592_l._,\r\nand the year ending at the same quarter in 1796, 750,637_l._, after a\r\nfair deduction having been made for the alteration (which, you know, on\r\ngrounds of policy I never approved) in your privilege of franking. I\r\nhave seen no formal document subsequent to that period, but I have been\r\ncredibly informed there is very good ground to believe that the revenue\r\nof the Post-Office[51] still continues to be regularly and largely upon\r\nthe rise.\r\n\r\nWhat is the true inference to be drawn from the annual number of\r\nbankruptcies has been the occasion of much dispute. On one side it has\r\nbeen confidently urged as a sure symptom of a decaying trade: on the\r\nother side it has been insisted that it is a circumstance attendant upon\r\na thriving trade; for that the greater is the whole quantity of trade,\r\nthe greater of course must be the positive number of failures, while the\r\naggregate success is still in the same proportion. In truth, the\r\nincrease of the number may arise from either of those causes. But all\r\nmust agree in one conclusion,--that, if the number diminishes, and at\r\nthe same time every other sort of evidence tends to show an augmentation\r\nof trade, there can be no better indication. We have already had very\r\nample means of gathering that the year 1796 was a very favorable year of\r\ntrade, and in that year the number of bankruptcies was at least one\r\nfifth below the usual average. I take this from the declaration of the\r\nLord Chancellor in the House of Lords.[52] He professed to speak from\r\nthe records of Chancery; and he added another very striking fact,--that\r\non the property actually paid into his court (a very small part, indeed,\r\nof the whole property of the kingdom) there had accrued in that year a\r\nnet surplus of eight hundred thousand pounds, which was so much new\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nBut the real situation of our trade, during the whole of this war,\r\ndeserves more minute investigation. I shall begin with that which,\r\nthough the least in consequence, makes perhaps the most impression on\r\nour senses, because it meets our eyes in our daily walks: I mean our\r\nretail trade. The exuberant display of wealth in our shops was the sight\r\nwhich most amazed a learned foreigner of distinction who lately resided\r\namong us: his expression, I remember, was, that \"_they seemed to be\r\nbursting with opulence into the streets_.\" The documents which throw\r\nlight on this subject are not many, but they all meet in the same point:\r\nall concur in exhibiting an increase. The most material are the general\r\nlicenses[53] which the law requires to be taken out by all dealers in\r\nexcisable commodities. These seem to be subject to considerable\r\nfluctuations. They have not been so low in any year of the war as in the\r\nyears 1788 and 1789, nor ever so high in peace as in the first year of\r\nthe war. I should next state the licenses to dealers in spirits and\r\nwine; but the change in them which took place in 1789 would give an\r\nunfair advantage to my argument. I shall therefore content myself with\r\nremarking, that from the date of that change the spirit licenses kept\r\nnearly the same level till the stoppage of the distilleries in 1795. If\r\nthey dropped a little, (and it was but little,) the wine licenses,\r\nduring the same time, more than countervailed that loss to the revenue;\r\nand it is remarkable with regard to the latter, that in the year 1796,\r\nwhich was the lowest in the excise duties on wine itself, as well as in\r\nthe quantity imported, more dealers in wine appear to have been licensed\r\nthan in any former year, excepting the first year of the war. This fact\r\nmay raise some doubt whether the consumption has been lessened so much\r\nas, I believe, is commonly imagined. The only other retail-traders whom\r\nI found so entered as to admit of being selected are tea-dealers and\r\nsellers of gold and silver plate, both of whom seem to have multiplied\r\nvery much in proportion to their aggregate number.[54] I have kept apart\r\none set of licensed sellers, because I am aware that our antagonists may\r\nbe inclined to triumph a little, when I name auctioneers and auctions.\r\nThey may be disposed to consider it as a sort of trade which thrives by\r\nthe distress of others. But if they will look at it a little more\r\nattentively, they will find their gloomy comfort vanish. The public\r\nincome from these licenses has risen with very great regularity through\r\na series of years which all must admit to have been years of prosperity.\r\nIt is remarkable, too, that in the year 1793, which was the great year\r\nof bankruptcies, these duties on auctioneers and auctions[55] fell below\r\nthe mark of 1791; and in 1796, which year had one fifth less than the\r\naccustomed average of bankruptcies, they mounted at once beyond all\r\nformer examples. In concluding this general head, will you permit me, my\r\ndear Sir, to bring to your notice an humble, but industrious and\r\nlaborious set of chapmen, against whom the vengeance of your House has\r\nsometimes been levelled, with what policy I need not stay to inquire, as\r\nthey have escaped without much injury? The hawkers and peddlers,[56] I\r\nam assured, are still doing well, though, from some new arrangements\r\nrespecting them made in 1789, it would be difficult to trace their\r\nproceedings in any satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nWhen such is the vigor of our traffic in its minutest ramifications, we\r\nmay be persuaded that the root and the trunk are sound. When we see the\r\nlife-blood of the state circulate so freely through the capillary\r\nvessels of the System, we scarcely need inquire if the heart performs\r\nits functions aright. But let us approach it; let us lay it bare, and\r\nwatch the systole and diastole, as it now receives and now pours forth\r\nthe vital stream through all the members. The port of London has always\r\nsupplied the main evidence of the state of our commerce. I know, that,\r\namidst all the difficulties and embarrassments of the year 1793, from\r\ncauses unconnected with and prior to the war, the tonnage of ships in\r\nthe Thames actually rose. But I shall not go through a detail of\r\nofficial papers on this point. There is evidence, which has appeared\r\nthis very session before your House, infinitely more forcible and\r\nimpressive to my apprehension than all the journals and ledgers of all\r\nthe Inspectors-General from the days of Davenant. It is such as cannot\r\ncarry with it any sort of fallacy. It comes, not from one set, but from\r\nmany opposite sets of witnesses, who all agree in nothing else:\r\nwitnesses of the gravest and most unexceptionable character, and who\r\nconfirm what they say, in the surest manner, by their conduct. Two\r\ndifferent bills have been brought in for improving the port of London. I\r\nhave it from very good intelligence, that, when the project was first\r\nsuggested from necessity, there were no less than eight different plans,\r\nsupported by eight different bodies of subscribers. The cost of the\r\nleast was estimated at two hundred thousand pounds, and of the most\r\nextensive at twelve hundred thousand. The two between which the contest\r\nnow lies substantially agree (as all the others must have done) in the\r\nmotives and reasons of the preamble; but I shall confine myself to that\r\nbill which is proposed on the part of the mayor, aldermen, and common\r\ncouncil, because I regard them as the best authority, and their language\r\nin itself is fuller and more precise. I certainly see them complain of\r\nthe \"great delays, accidents, damages, losses, and extraordinary\r\nexpenses, which are almost continually sustained, to the hindrance and\r\ndiscouragement of commerce, and the great injury of the public revenue.\"\r\nBut what are the causes to which they attribute their complaints? The\r\nfirst is, \"THAT, FROM THE VERY GREAT AND PROGRESSIVE INCREASE OF THE\r\nNUMBER AND SIZE OF SHIPS AND OTHER VESSELS TRADING TO THE PORT OF\r\nLONDON, the river Thames, in and near the said port, is in general so\r\nmuch crowded with shipping, lighters, and other craft, that the\r\nnavigation of a considerable part of the river is thereby rendered\r\ntedious and dangerous; and there is great want of room in the said port\r\nfor the safe and convenient mooring of vessels, and constant access to\r\nthem.\" The second is of the same nature. It is the want of regulations\r\nand arrangements, never before found necessary, for expedition and\r\nfacility. The third is of another kind, but to the same effect: That the\r\nlegal quays are too confined, and there is not sufficient accommodation\r\nfor the landing and shipping of cargoes. And the fourth and last is\r\nstill different: they describe the avenues to the legal quays (which,\r\nlittle more than a century since, the great fire of London opened and\r\ndilated beyond the measure of our then circumstances) to be now\r\n\"incommodious, and much too narrow for the great concourse of carts and\r\nother carriages usually passing and repassing therein.\" Thus our trade\r\nhas grown too big for the ancient limits of Art and Nature. Our streets,\r\nour lanes, our shores, the river itself, which has so long been our\r\npride, are impeded and obstructed and choked up by our riches. They are,\r\nlike our shops, \"bursting with opulence.\" To these misfortunes, to these\r\ndistresses and grievances alone, we are told, it is to be imputed that\r\nstill more of our capital has not been pushed into the channel of our\r\ncommerce, to roll back in its reflux still more abundant capital, and\r\nfructify the national treasury in its course. Indeed, my dear Sir, when\r\nI have before my eyes this consentient testimony of the corporation of\r\nthe city of London, the West India merchants, and all the other\r\nmerchants who promoted the other plans, struggling and contending which\r\nof them shall be permitted to lay out their money in consonance with\r\ntheir testimony, I cannot turn aside to examine what one or two violent\r\npetitions, tumultuously voted by real or pretended liverymen of London,\r\nmay have said of the utter destruction and annihilation of trade.\r\n\r\nThis opens a subject on which every true lover of his country, and, at\r\nthis crisis, every friend to the liberties of Europe, and of social\r\norder in every country, must dwell and expatiate with delight. I mean to\r\nwind up all my proofs of our astonishing and almost incredible\r\nprosperity with the valuable information given to the Secret Committee\r\nof the Lords by the Inspector-General. And here I am happy that I can\r\nadminister an antidote to all despondence from the same dispensary from\r\nwhich the first dose of poison was supposed to have come. The report of\r\nthat committee is generally believed to have derived much benefit from\r\nthe labors of the same noble lord who was said, as the author of the\r\npamphlet of 1795, to have led the way in teaching us to place all our\r\nhope on that very experiment which he afterwards declared in his place\r\nto have been from the beginning utterly without hope. We have now his\r\nauthority to say, that, as far as our resources were concerned, the\r\nexperiment was equally without necessity.\r\n\r\n\"It appears,\" as the committee has very justly and satisfactorily\r\nobserved, \"by the accounts of the value of the imports and exports for\r\nthe last twenty years, produced by Mr. Irving, Inspector-General of\r\nImports and Exports, that the demands for cash to be sent abroad\"\r\n(which, by the way, including the loan to the Emperor, was nearly one\r\nthird less sent to the Continent of Europe than in the Seven Years' War)\r\n... \"was greatly compensated by a very large balance of commerce in\r\nfavor of this kingdom,--greater than was ever known in any preceding\r\nperiod. The value of the exports of the last year amounted, according to\r\nthe valuation on which the accounts of the Inspector-General are\r\nfounded, to 30,424,184_l._, which is more than double what it was in any\r\nyear of the American war, and one third more than it was on an average\r\nduring the last peace, previous to the year 1792; and though the value\r\nof the imports to this country has during the same period greatly\r\nincreased, the excess of the value of the exports above that of the\r\nimports, which constitutes the balance of trade, has augmented even in a\r\ngreater proportion.\" These observations might perhaps be branched out\r\ninto other points of view, but I shall leave them to your own active and\r\ningenious mind. There is another and still more important light in\r\nwhich, the Inspector-General's information may be seen,--and that is, as\r\naffording a comparison of some circumstances in this war with the\r\ncommercial history of all our other wars in the present century.\r\n\r\nIn all former hostilities, our exports gradually declined in value, and\r\nthen (with one single exception) ascended again, till they reached and\r\npassed the level of the preceding peace. But this was a work of time,\r\nsometimes more, sometimes less slow. In Queen Anne's war, which began in\r\n1702, it was an interval of ten years before this was effected. Nine\r\nyears only were necessary, in the war of 1739, for the same operation.\r\nThe Seven Years' War saw the period much shortened: hostilities began in\r\n1755; and in 1758, the fourth year of the war, the exports mounted above\r\nthe peace-mark. There was, however, a distinguishing feature of that\r\nwar,--that our tonnage, to the very last moment, was in a state of great\r\ndepression, while our commerce was chiefly carried on by foreign\r\nvessels. The American war was darkened with singular and peculiar\r\nadversity. Our exports never came near to their peaceful elevation, and\r\nour tonnage continued, with very little fluctuation, to subside lower\r\nand lower.[57] On the other hand, the present war, with regard to our\r\ncommerce, has the white mark of as singular felicity. If, from internal\r\ncauses, as well as the consequence of hostilities, the tide ebbed in\r\n1793, it rushed back again with a bore in the following year, and from\r\nthat time has continued to swell and run every successive year higher\r\nand higher into all our ports. The value of our exports last year above\r\nthe year 1792 (the mere increase of our commerce during the war) is\r\nequal to the average value of all the exports during the wars of William\r\nand Anne.\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out, that our imports have not kept pace\r\nwith our exports: of course, on the face of the account, the balance of\r\ntrade, both positively and comparatively considered, must have been much\r\nmore than ever in our favor. In that early little tract of mine, to\r\nwhich I have already more than once referred, I made many observations\r\non the usual method of computing that balance, as well as the usual\r\nobjection to it, that the entries at the Custom-House were not always\r\ntrue. As you probably remember them, I shall not repeat them here. On\r\nthe one hand, I am not surprised that the same trite objection is\r\nperpetually renewed by the detractors of our national affluence; and on\r\nthe other hand, I am gratified in perceiving that the balance of trade\r\nseems to be now computed in a manner much clearer than it used to be\r\nfrom those errors which I formerly noticed. The Inspector-General\r\nappears to have made his estimate with every possible guard and caution.\r\nHis opinion is entitled to the greatest respect. It was in substance, (I\r\nshall again use the words of the Report, as much better than my own,)\r\n\"that the true balance of our trade amounted, on a medium of the four\r\nyears preceding January, 1796, to upwards of 6,500,00_l._ per annum,\r\nexclusive of the profits arising from our East and West India trade,\r\nwhich he estimates at upwards of 4,000,000_l._ per annum, exclusive of\r\nthe profits derived from our fisheries.\" So that, including the\r\nfisheries, and making a moderate allowance for the exceedings, which Mr.\r\nIrving himself supposes, beyond his calculation, without reckoning what\r\nthe public creditors themselves pay to themselves, and without taking\r\none shilling from the stock of the landed interest, our colonies, our\r\nOriental possessions, our skill and industry, our commerce and\r\nnavigation, at the commencement of this year, were pouring a new annual\r\ncapital into the kingdom, hardly half a million short of the whole\r\ninterest of that tremendous debt from which we are taught to shrink in\r\ndismay, as from an overwhelming and intolerable oppression.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the real state of this nation is such as I have described,\r\n(and I am only apprehensive that you may think I have taken too much\r\npains to exclude all doubt on this question,)--if no class is lessened\r\nin its numbers, or in its stock, or in its conveniences, or even its\r\nluxuries,--if they build as many habitations, and as elegant and as\r\ncommodious as ever, and furnish them with every chargeable decoration\r\nand every prodigality of ingenious invention that can be thought of by\r\nthose who even incumber their necessities with superfluous\r\naccommodation,--if they are as numerously attended,--if their equipages\r\nare as splendid,--if they regale at table with as much or more variety\r\nof plenty than ever,--if they are clad in as expensive and changeful a\r\ndiversity, according to their tastes and modes,--if they are not\r\ndeterred from the pleasures of the field by the charges which government\r\nhas wisely turned from the culture to the sports of the field,--if the\r\ntheatres are as rich and as well filled, and greater and at a higher\r\nprice than ever,--and (what is more important than all) if it is plain,\r\nfrom the treasures which are spread over the soil or confided to the\r\nwinds and the seas, that there are as many who are indulgent to their\r\npropensities of parsimony as others to their voluptuous desires, and\r\nthat the pecuniary capital grows instead of diminishing,--on what ground\r\nare we authorized to say that a nation gambolling in an ocean of\r\nsuperfluity is undone by want? With what face can we pretend that they\r\nwho have not denied any one gratification to any one appetite have a\r\nright to plead poverty in order to famish their virtues and to put their\r\nduties on short allowance? that they are to take the law from an\r\nimperious enemy, and can contribute no longer to the honor of their\r\nking, to the support of the independence of their country, to the\r\nsalvation of that Europe which, if it falls, must crush them with its\r\ngigantic ruins? How can they affect to sweat and stagger and groan under\r\ntheir burdens, to whom the mines of Newfoundland, richer than those of\r\nMexico and Peru, are now thrown in as a make-weight in the scale of\r\ntheir exorbitant opulence? What excuse can they have to faint, and\r\ncreep, and cringe, and prostrate themselves at the footstool of ambition\r\nand crime, who, during a short, though violent struggle, which they have\r\nnever supported with the energy of men, have amassed more to their\r\nannual accumulation than all the well-husbanded capital that enabled\r\ntheir ancestors, by long and doubtful and obstinate conflicts, to\r\ndefend and liberate and vindicate the civilized world? But I do not\r\naccuse the people of England. As to the great majority of the nation,\r\nthey have done whatever, in their several ranks and conditions and\r\ndescriptions, was required of them by their relative situations in\r\nsociety: and from those the great mass of mankind cannot depart, without\r\nthe subversion of all public order. They look up to that government\r\nwhich they obey that they may be protected. They ask to be led and\r\ndirected by those rulers whom Providence and the laws of their country\r\nhave set over them, and under their guidance to walk in the ways of\r\nsafety and honor. They have again delegated the greatest trust which\r\nthey have to bestow to those faithful representatives who made their\r\ntrue voice heard against the disturbers and destroyers of Europe. They\r\nsuffered, with unapproving acquiescence, solicitations, which they had\r\nin no shape desired, to an unjust and usurping power, whom they had\r\nnever provoked, and whose hostile menaces they did not dread. When the\r\nexigencies of the public service could only be met by their voluntary\r\nzeal, they started forth with an ardor which outstripped the wishes of\r\nthose who had injured them by doubting whether it might not be necessary\r\nto have recourse to compulsion. They have in all things reposed an\r\nenduring, but not an unreflecting confidence. That confidence demands a\r\nfull return, and fixes a responsibility on the ministers entire and\r\nundivided. The people stands acquitted, if the war is not carried on in\r\na manner suited to its objects. If the public honor is tarnished, if the\r\npublic safety suffers any detriment, the ministers, not the people, are\r\nto answer it, and they alone. Its armies, its navies, are given to them\r\nwithout stint or restriction. Its treasures are poured out at their\r\nfeet. Its constancy is ready to second all their efforts. They are not\r\nto fear a responsibility for acts of manly adventure. The responsibility\r\nwhich they are to dread is lest they should show themselves unequal to\r\nthe expectation of a brave people. The more doubtful may be the\r\nconstitutional and economical questions upon which they have received so\r\nmarked a support, the more loudly they are called upon to support this\r\ngreat war, for the success of which their country is willing to\r\nsupersede considerations of no slight importance. Where I speak of\r\nresponsibility, I do not mean to exclude that species of it which the\r\nlegal powers of the country have a right finally to exact from those who\r\nabuse a public trust: but high as this is, there is a responsibility\r\nwhich attaches on them from which the whole legitimate power of the\r\nkingdom cannot absolve them; there is a responsibility to conscience and\r\nto glory, a responsibility to the existing world, and to that posterity\r\nwhich men of their eminence cannot avoid for glory or for shame,--a\r\nresponsibility to a tribunal at which not only ministers, but kings and\r\nparliaments, but even nations themselves, must one day answer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] The Archduke Charles of Austria.\r\n\r\n[38] Dec 27, 1790.\r\n\r\n[39] Observations on a Late

The letter-book for that year is not to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       POST-OFFICE.\r\n                                       |       Number of Letters.\r\n            Gross Revenue              |--------------------------------\r\n                                £      |    Inwards.    |   Outwards.\r\nApril, 1790-1791             575,079   |    --------    |   ---------\r\n       1791-1792             585,432   |   6,391,149    |   5,081,344\r\n       1792-1793             627,592   |   6,584,867    |   5,041,137\r\n       1793-1794             691,268   |   7,094,777    |   6,537,234\r\n       1794-1795             705,319   |   7,071,029    |   7,473,626\r\n       1795-1796             750,637   |   7,641,077    |   8,597,167\r\n\r\nFrom the last-mentioned report it appears that the accounts have not\r\nbeen completely and authentically made up for the years ending 5th\r\nApril, 1796 and 1797; but on the Receiver-General's books there is an\r\nincrease of the latter year over the former, equal to something more\r\nthan 5 per cent.\r\n\r\n[52] In a debate, 30th December, 1796, on the return of Lord\r\nMalmesbury.--See Woodfall's Parliamentary Debates, Vol. XIII. p. 591.\r\n\r\n[53]\r\n\r\n               GENERAL LICENSES.\r\nYears of Peace.    £   | Years of War.     £\r\n1787            44,030 |  1793          45,568\r\n1788            40,882 |  1794          42,129\r\n1789            39,917 |  1795          43,350\r\n1790            41,970 |  1796          41,190\r\n               ------- |               -------     Increase to 1790\r\n              £166,799 |              £170,237         £3,438.\r\n                                                   Increase to 1791\r\n1791           £44,240 4 Years to 1791   £167,009      £3,228.\r\n\r\n\r\n[54]\r\n\r\n             DEALERS IN TEA.\r\nYears of Peace.  £     | Years of War.    £\r\n1787           10,934  | 1793         13,939\r\n1788           11,949  | 1794         14,315\r\n1789           12,501  | 1795         13,956\r\n1790           13,126  | 1796         14,830\r\n              -------  |             -------     Increase to 1790\r\n              £48,510  |             £57,040        £8,530.\r\n                                                 Increase to 1791\r\n1791        £13,921   4 Years to 1791  £51,497        £5,543.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SELLERS OF PLATE.\r\nYears of Peace.  £     | Years of War.   £\r\n1787            6,593  | 1793          8,178\r\n1788            7,953  | 1794          8,296\r\n1789            7,348  | 1795          8,128\r\n1790            7,988  | 1796          8,835\r\n              -------  |             -------     Increase to 1790\r\n              £29,832  |             £33,437        £3,555.\r\n                                                 Increase to 1791\r\n1791         £8,327 4 Years to 1791  £31,616      £1,821.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[55]\r\n\r\n             AUCTIONS AND AUCTIONEERS.\r\nYears of Peace.  £     | Years of War.  £\r\n1787           48,964  | 1793         70,004\r\n1788           53,993  | 1794         82,659\r\n1789           52,024  | 1795         86,890\r\n1790           53,156  | 1796        109,594\r\n              -------  |             -------     Increase to 1790\r\n             £208,137  |            £349,147        £141,010.\r\n                                                 Increase to 1791\r\n1791        £70,973 4 Years to 1791 £230,146        £119,001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[56] Since Mr. Burke's death a Fourth Report of the Committee of Finance\r\nhas made its appearance.
