Neil Kittrell left the office of the\r\n_Morning Telegraph_ in a daze. He was insensible of the raw February\r\nair, heedless of sloppy pavements; the gray day had suddenly turned\r\ngold. He could not realize it all at once; ten thousand a year--for him\r\nand Edith! His heart swelled with love of Edith; she had sacrificed so\r\nmuch to become the wife of a man who had tried to make an artist of\r\nhimself, and of whom fate, or economic determinism, or something, had\r\nmade a cartoonist. What a surprise for her! He must hurry home.\r\n\r\nIn this swelling of his heart he felt a love not only of Edith but of\r\nthe whole world. The people he met seemed dear to him; he felt friendly\r\nwith every one, and beamed on perfect strangers with broad, cheerful\r\nsmiles. He stopped to buy some flowers for Edith--daffodils, or\r\ntulips, which promised spring, and he took the daffodils, because the\r\ngirl said:\r\n\r\n“I think yellow is such a spirituelle color, don’t you?” and inclined\r\nher head in a most artistic manner.\r\n\r\nBut daffodils, after all, which would have been much the day before,\r\nseemed insufficient in the light of new prosperity, and Kittrell bought\r\na large azalea, beautiful in its graceful spread of pink blooms.\r\n\r\n“Where shall I send it?” asked the girl, whose cheeks were as pink as\r\nazaleas themselves.\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll call a cab and take it to her myself,” said Kittrell.\r\n\r\nAnd she sighed over the romance of this rich young gentleman and the\r\ngirl of the azalea, who, no doubt, was as beautiful as the young woman\r\nwho was playing _Lottie, the Poor Saleslady_ at the Lyceum that very\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nKittrell and the azalea bowled along Claybourne Avenue; he leaned back\r\non the cushions, and adopted the expression of ennui appropriate to\r\nthat thoroughfare. Would Edith now prefer Claybourne Avenue? With ten\r\nthousand a year they could, perhaps--and yet, at first it would be best\r\nnot to put on airs, but to go right on as they were, in the flat. Then\r\nthe thought came to him that now, as the cartoonist on the _Telegraph_,\r\nhis name would become as well known in Claybourne Avenue as it had been\r\nin the homes of the poor and humble during his years on the _Post_. And\r\nhis thoughts flew to those homes where tired men at evening looked for\r\nhis cartoons and children laughed at his funny pictures. It gave him a\r\npang; he had felt a subtle bond between himself and all those thousands\r\nwho read the _Post_. It was hard to leave them. The _Post_ might be\r\nyellow, but, as the girl had said, yellow was a spiritual color, and\r\nthe _Post_ brought something into their lives--lives that were scorned\r\nby the _Telegraph_ and by these people on the avenue. Could he make new\r\nfriends here, where the cartoons he drew and the _Post_ that printed\r\nthem had been contemned, if not despised? His mind flew back to the\r\ndingy office of the _Post_; to the boys there, the whole good-natured,\r\nhappy-go-lucky gang; and to Hardy--ah, Hardy!--who had been so good to\r\nhim, and given him his big chance, had taken such pains and interest,\r\nhelping him with ideas and suggestions, criticism and sympathy. To\r\ntell Hardy that he was going to leave him, here on the eve of the\r\ncampaign--and Clayton, the mayor, he would have to tell him, too--oh,\r\nthe devil! Why must he think of these things now?\r\n\r\nAfter all, when he had reached home, and had run up-stairs with the\r\nnews and the azalea, Edith did not seem delighted.\r\n\r\n“But, dearie, business is business,” he argued, “and we need the money!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know; doubtless you’re right. Only please don’t say ‘business\r\nis business;’ it isn’t like you, and--”\r\n\r\n“But think what it will mean--ten thousand a year!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Neil, I’ve lived on ten thousand a year before, and I never had\r\nhalf the fun that I had when we were getting along on twelve hundred.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but then we were always dreaming of the day when I’d make a lot;\r\nwe lived on that hope, didn’t we?”\r\n\r\nEdith laughed. “You used to say we lived on love.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not serious.” He turned to gaze moodily out of the window. And\r\nthen she left the azalea, and perched on the flat arm of his chair.\r\n\r\n“Dearest,” she said, “I am serious. I know all this means to you. We’re\r\nhuman, and we don’t like to ‘chip at crusts like Hindus,’ even for the\r\nsake of youth and art. I never had illusions about love in a cottage\r\nand all that. Only, dear, I have been happy, so very happy, with you,\r\nbecause--well, because I was living in an atmosphere of honest purpose,\r\nhonest ambition, and honest desire to do some good thing in the world.\r\nI had never known such an atmosphere before. At home, you know, father\r\nand Uncle James and the boys--well, it was all money, money, money with\r\nthem, and they couldn’t understand why I--”\r\n\r\n“Could marry a poor newspaper artist! That’s just the point.”\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to his lips.\r\n\r\n“Now, dear! If they couldn’t understand, so much the worse for them. If\r\nthey thought it meant sacrifice to me, they were mistaken. I have been\r\nhappy in this little flat; only--” she leaned back and inclined her\r\nhead with her eyes asquint--“only the paper in this room is atrocious;\r\nit’s a typical landlord’s selection--McGaw picked it out. You see what\r\nit means to be merely rich.”\r\n\r\nShe was so pretty thus that he kissed her, and then she went on:\r\n\r\n“And so, dear, if I didn’t seem to be as impressed and delighted as you\r\nhoped to find me, it is because I was thinking of Mr. Hardy and the\r\npoor, dear, common little _Post_, and then--of Mr. Clayton. Did you\r\nthink of him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to--to cartoon him?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so.”\r\n\r\nThe fact he had not allowed himself to face was close to both of them,\r\nand the subject was dropped until, just as he was going down-town--this\r\ntime to break the news to Hardy--he went into the room he sarcastically\r\nsaid he might begin to call his studio, now that he was getting ten\r\nthousand a year, to look for a sketch he had promised Nolan for the\r\nsporting page. And there on his drawing-board was an unfinished\r\ncartoon, a drawing of the strong face of John Clayton. He had begun it\r\na few days before to use on the occasion of Clayton’s renomination.\r\nIt had been a labor of love, and Kittrell suddenly realized how good\r\nit was. He had put into it all of his belief in Clayton, all of his\r\ndevotion to the cause for which Clayton toiled and sacrificed, and\r\nin the simple lines he experienced the artist’s ineffable felicity;\r\nhe had shown how good, how noble, how true a man Clayton was. All at\r\nonce he realized the sensation the cartoon would produce, how it would\r\ndelight and hearten Clayton’s followers, how it would please Hardy,\r\nand how it would touch Clayton. It would be a tribute to the man and\r\nthe friendship, but now a tribute broken, unfinished. Kittrell gazed a\r\nmoment longer, and in that moment Edith came.\r\n\r\n“The dear, beautiful soul!” she exclaimed softly. “Neil, it is\r\nwonderful. It is not a cartoon; it is a portrait. It shows what you\r\nmight do with a brush.”\r\n\r\nKittrell could not speak, and he turned the drawing-board to the wall.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Edith sat and thought--of Neil, of the new position,\r\nof Clayton. He had loved Neil, and been so proud of his work; he had\r\nshown a frank, naïve pleasure in the cartoons Neil had made of him.\r\nThat last time he was there, thought Edith, he had said that without\r\nNeil the “good old cause,” as he called it, using Whitman’s phrase,\r\ncould never have triumphed in that town. And now, would he come again?\r\nWould he ever stand in that room and, with his big, hearty laugh,\r\nclasp an arm around Neil’s shoulder, or speak of her in his good,\r\nfriendly way as “the little woman?” Would he come now, in the terrible\r\ndays of the approaching campaign, for rest and sympathy--come as he\r\nused to come in other campaigns, worn and weary from all the brutal\r\nopposition, the vilification and abuse and mud-slinging? She closed her\r\neyes. She could not think that far.\r\n\r\nKittrell found the task of telling Hardy just as difficult as he\r\nexpected it to be, but by some mercy it did not last long. Explanation\r\nhad not been necessary; he had only to make the first hesitating\r\napproaches, and Hardy understood. Hardy was, in a way, hurt; Kittrell\r\nsaw that, and rushed to his own defense:\r\n\r\n“I hate to go, old man. I don’t like it a little bit--but, you know,\r\nbusiness is business, and we need the money.”\r\n\r\nHe even tried to laugh as he advanced this last conclusive reason, and\r\nHardy, for all he showed in voice or phrase, may have agreed with him.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Kit,” he said. “I’m sorry; I wish we could pay you\r\nmore, but--well, good luck.”\r\n\r\nThat was all. Kittrell gathered up the few articles he had at the\r\noffice, gave Nolan his sketch, bade the boys good-by--bade them good-by\r\nas if he were going on a long journey, never to see them more--and then\r\nhe went.\r\n\r\nAfter he had made the break it did not seem so bad as he had\r\nanticipated. At first things went on smoothly enough. The campaign\r\nhad not opened, and he was free to exercise his talents outside the\r\npolitical field. He drew cartoons dealing with banal subjects, touching\r\nwith the gentle satire of his humorous pencil foibles which all the\r\nworld agreed about, and let vital questions alone. And he and Edith\r\nenjoyed themselves: indulged oftener in things they loved; went more\r\nfrequently to the theater; appeared at recitals; dined now and then\r\ndown-town. They began to realize certain luxuries they had not known\r\nfor a long time--some he himself had never known, some that Edith had\r\nnot known since she left her father’s home to become his bride. In\r\nmore subtle ways, too, Kittrell felt the change: there was a sense\r\nof larger leisure; the future beamed with a broader and brighter\r\nlight; he formed plans, among which the old dream of going ere long\r\nto Paris for serious study took its dignified place. And then there\r\nwas the sensation his change had created in the newspaper world; that\r\nthe cartoons signed “Kit,” which formerly appeared in the _Post_,\r\nshould now adorn the broad page of the _Telegraph_ was a thing to talk\r\nabout at the press club; the fact of his large salary got abroad in\r\nthat little world as well, and, after the way of that world, managed\r\nto exaggerate itself, as most facts did. He began to be sensible of\r\nattentions from men of prominence--small things, mere nods in the\r\nstreet, perhaps, or smiles in the theater foyer, but enough to show\r\nthat they recognized him. What those children of the people, those\r\nworking-men and women who used to be his unknown and admiring friends\r\nin the old days on the _Post_, thought of him--whether they missed him,\r\nwhether they deplored his change as an apostasy or applauded it as a\r\npromotion--he did not know. He did not like to think about it.\r\n\r\nBut March came, and the politicians began to bluster like the season.\r\nLate one afternoon he was on his way to the office with a cartoon, the\r\nfirst in which he had seriously to attack Clayton. Benson, the managing\r\neditor of the _Telegraph_, had conceived it, and Kittrell had worked\r\non it that day in sickness of heart. Every lying line of this new\r\npresentation of Clayton had cut him like some biting acid; but he had\r\nworked on, trying to reassure himself with the argument that he was a\r\nmere agent, devoid of personal responsibility. But it had been hard,\r\nand when Edith, after her custom, had asked to see it, he had said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, you don’t want to see it; it’s no good.”\r\n\r\n“Is it of--him?” she had asked.\r\n\r\nAnd when he nodded she had gone away without another word. Now, as he\r\nhurried through the crowded streets, he was conscious that it was no\r\ngood, indeed; and he was divided between the artist’s regret and the\r\nfriend’s joy in the fact. But it made him tremble. Was his hand to\r\nforget its cunning? And then, suddenly, he heard a familiar voice, and\r\nthere beside him, with his hand on his shoulder, stood the mayor.\r\n\r\n“Why, Neil, my boy, how are you?” he said, and he took Kittrell’s\r\nhand as warmly as ever. For a moment Kittrell was relieved, and then\r\nhis heart sank; for he had a quick realization that it was the coward\r\nwithin him that felt the relief, and the man the sickness. If Clayton\r\nhad reproached him, or cut him, it would have made it easier; but\r\nClayton did none of these things, and Kittrell was irresistibly drawn\r\nto the subject himself.\r\n\r\n“You heard of my--new job?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Clayton, “I heard.”\r\n\r\n“Well--” Kittrell began.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” Clayton said.\r\n\r\n“So was I,” Kittrell hastened to say. “But I felt it--well, a duty,\r\nsome way--to Edith. You know--we--need the money.” And he gave the\r\ncynical laugh that went with the argument.\r\n\r\n“What does _she_ think? Does she feel that way about it?”\r\n\r\nKittrell laughed, not cynically now, but uneasily and with\r\nembarrassment, for Clayton’s blue eyes were on him, those eyes that\r\ncould look into men and understand them so.\r\n\r\n“Of course you know,” Kittrell went on nervously, “there is nothing\r\npersonal in this. We newspaper fellows simply do what we are told;\r\nwe obey orders like soldiers, you know. With the policy of the\r\npaper we have nothing to do. Just like Dick Jennings, who was a\r\nred-hot free-trader and used to write free-trade editorials for the\r\n_Times_--he went over to the _Telegraph_, you remember, and writes all\r\nthose protection arguments.”\r\n\r\nThe mayor did not seem to be interested in Dick Jennings, or in the\r\nethics of his profession.\r\n\r\n“Of course, you know I’m for you, Mr. Clayton, just exactly as I’ve\r\nalways been. I’m going to vote for you.”\r\n\r\nThis did not seem to interest the mayor, either.\r\n\r\n“And, maybe, you know--I thought, perhaps,” he snatched at this bright\r\nnew idea that had come to him just in the nick of time, “that I might\r\nhelp you by my cartoons in the _Telegraph_; that is, I might keep them\r\nfrom being as bad as they might--”\r\n\r\n“But that wouldn’t be dealing fairly with your new employers, Neil,”\r\nthe mayor said.\r\n\r\nKittrell was making more and more a mess of this whole miserable\r\nbusiness, and he was basely glad when they reached the corner.\r\n\r\n“Well, good-by, my boy,” said the mayor, as they parted. “Remember me\r\nto the little woman.”\r\n\r\nKittrell watched him as he went on down the avenue, swinging along in\r\nhis free way, the broad felt hat he wore riding above all the other\r\nhats in the throng that filled the sidewalk; and Kittrell sighed in\r\ndeep depression.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned in his cartoon, Benson scanned it a moment, cocked his\r\nhead this side and that, puffed his brier pipe, and finally said:\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid this is hardly up to you. This figure of Clayton, here--it\r\nhasn’t got the stuff in it. You want to show him as he _is_. We want\r\nthe people to know what a four-flushing, hypocritical, demagogical\r\nblatherskite he is--with all his rot about the people and their damned\r\nrights!”\r\n\r\nBenson was all unconscious of the inconsistency of having concern for\r\na people he so despised, and Kittrell did not observe it, either. He\r\nwas on the point of defending Clayton, but he restrained himself and\r\nlistened to Benson’s suggestions. He remained at the office for two\r\nhours, trying to change the cartoon to Benson’s satisfaction, with a\r\ngrowing hatred of the work and a disgust with himself that now and\r\nthen almost drove him to mad destruction. He felt like splashing the\r\npiece with India ink, or ripping it with his knife. But he worked on,\r\nand submitted it again. He had failed, of course; failed to express in\r\nit that hatred of a class which Benson unconsciously disguised as a\r\nhatred of Clayton, a hatred which Kittrell could not express because he\r\ndid not feel it; and he failed because art deserts her devotees when\r\nthey are false to truth.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’ll have to do,” said Benson, as he looked it over; “but let’s\r\nhave a little more to the next one. Damn it! I wish I could draw. I’d\r\ncartoon the crook!”\r\n\r\nIn default of which ability, Benson set himself to write one of those\r\nsavage editorials in which he poured out on Clayton that venom of which\r\nhe seemed to have such an inexhaustible supply.\r\n\r\nBut on one point Benson was right: Kittrell was not up to himself. As\r\nthe campaign opened, as the city was swept with the excitement of it,\r\nwith meetings at noon-day and at night, office-seekers flying about\r\nin automobiles, walls covered with pictures of candidates, hand-bills\r\nscattered in the streets to swirl in the wild March winds, and men\r\nquarreling over whether Clayton or Ellsworth should be mayor, Kittrell\r\nhad to draw a political cartoon each day; and as he struggled with his\r\nwork, less and less the old joy came to cheer and spur him on. To read\r\nthe ridicule, the abuse, which the _Telegraph_ heaped on Clayton, the\r\ndistortion of facts concerning his candidature, the unfair reports\r\nof his meetings, sickened him, and more than all, he was filled with\r\ndisgust as he tried to match in caricature these libels of the man he\r\nso loved and honored. It was bad enough to have to flatter Clayton’s\r\nopponent, to picture him as a noble, disinterested character, ready to\r\nsacrifice himself for the public weal. Into his pictures of this man,\r\nattired in the long black coat of conventional respectability, with the\r\nsmug face of pharisaism, he could get nothing but cant and hypocrisy;\r\nbut in his caricatures of Clayton there was that which pained him\r\nworse--disloyalty, untruth, and now and then, to the discerning few\r\nwho knew the tragedy of Kittrell’s soul, there was pity. And thus his\r\nwork declined in value; lacking all sincerity, all faith in itself or\r\nits purpose, it became false, uncertain, full of jarring notes, and,\r\nin short, never once rang true. As for Edith, she never discussed his\r\nwork now; she spoke of the campaign little, and yet he knew she was\r\ndeeply concerned, and she grew hot with resentment at the methods of\r\nthe _Telegraph_. Her only consolation was derived from the Post, which,\r\nof course, supported Clayton; and the final drop of bitterness in\r\nKittrell’s cup came one evening when he realized that she was following\r\nwith sympathetic interest the cartoons in that paper.\r\n\r\nFor the _Post_ had a new cartoonist, Banks, a boy whom Hardy had\r\npicked up somewhere and was training to the work Kittrell had laid\r\ndown. To Kittrell there was a cruel fascination in the progress Banks\r\nwas making; he watched it with a critical, professional eye, at first\r\nwith amusement, then with surprise, and now at last, in the discovery\r\nof Edith’s interest, with a keen jealousy of which he was ashamed.\r\nThe boy was crude and untrained; his work was not to be compared with\r\nKittrell’s, master of line that he was, but Kittrell saw that it had\r\nthe thing his work now lacked, the vital, primal thing--sincerity,\r\nbelief, love. The spark was there, and Kittrell knew how Hardy would\r\nnurse that spark and fan it, and keep it alive and burning until\r\nit should eventually blaze up in a fine white flame. And Kittrell\r\nrealized, as the days went by, that Banks’ work was telling, and that\r\nhis own was failing. He had, from the first, missed the atmosphere of\r\nthe _Post_, missed the _camaraderie_ of the congenial spirits there,\r\nanimated by a common purpose, inspired and led by Hardy, whom they\r\nall loved--loved as he himself once loved him, loved as he loved him\r\nstill--and dare not look him in the face when they met!\r\n\r\nHe found the atmosphere of the _Telegraph_ alien and distasteful.\r\nThere all was different; the men had little joy in their work, little\r\ninterest in it, save perhaps the newspaper man’s inborn love of a good\r\nstory or a beat. They were all cynical, without loyalty or faith; they\r\nsecretly made fun of the _Telegraph_, of its editors and owners; they\r\nhad no belief in its cause; and its pretensions to respectability,\r\nits parade of virtue, excited only their derision. And slowly it\r\nbegan to dawn on Kittrell that the great moral law worked always and\r\neverywhere, even on newspapers, and that there was reflected inevitably\r\nand logically in the work of the men on that staff the hatred, the lack\r\nof principle, the bigotry and intolerance of its proprietors; and this\r\nsame lack of principle tainted and made meretricious his own work,\r\nand enervated the editorials so that the _Telegraph_, no matter how\r\ncarefully edited or how dignified in typographical appearance, was,\r\nnevertheless, without real influence in the community.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clayton was gaining ground. It was less than two weeks\r\nbefore election. The campaign waxed more and more bitter, and as the\r\nforces opposed to him foresaw defeat, they became ugly in spirit, and\r\ndesperate. The _Telegraph_ took on a tone more menacing and brutal,\r\nand Kittrell knew that the crisis had come. The might of the powers\r\nmassed against Clayton appalled Kittrell; they thundered at him through\r\nmany brazen mouths, but Clayton held on his high way unperturbed. He\r\nwas speaking by day and night to thousands. Such meetings he had never\r\nhad before. Kittrell had visions of him before those immense audiences\r\nin halls, in tents, in the raw open air of that rude March weather,\r\nmaking his appeals to the heart of the great mass. A fine, splendid,\r\nromantic figure he was, striking to the imagination, this champion of\r\nthe people’s cause, and Kittrell longed for the lost chance. Oh, for\r\none day on the _Post_ now!\r\n\r\nOne morning at breakfast, as Edith read the _Telegraph_, Kittrell saw\r\nthe tears well slowly in her brown eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “it is shameful!” She clenched her little fists. “Oh,\r\nif I were only a man I’d--” She could not in her impotent feminine rage\r\nsay what she would do; she could only grind her teeth. Kittrell bent\r\nhis head over his plate; his coffee choked him.\r\n\r\n“Dearest,” she said presently, in another tone, “tell me, how is he? Do\r\nyou--ever see him? Will he win?”\r\n\r\n“No, I never see him. But he’ll win; I wouldn’t worry.”\r\n\r\n“He used to come here,” she went on, “to rest a moment, to escape from\r\nall this hateful confusion and strife. He is killing himself! And\r\nthey aren’t worth it--those ignorant people--they aren’t worth such\r\nsacrifices.”\r\n\r\nHe got up from the table and turned away, and then, realizing quickly,\r\nshe flew to his side and put her arms about his neck and said:\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, dearest, I didn’t mean--only--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Edith,” he said, “this is killing me. I feel like a dog.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t dear; he is big enough, and good enough; he will understand.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; that only makes it harder, only makes it hurt the more.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, in the car, he heard no talk but of the election; and\r\ndown-town, in a cigar store where he stopped for cigarettes, he heard\r\nsome men talking mysteriously, in the hollow voice of rumor, of some\r\nsensation, some scandal. It alarmed him, and as he went into the office\r\nhe met Manning, the _Telegraph’s_ political man.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Manning,” Kittrell said, “how does it look?”\r\n\r\n“Damn bad for us.”\r\n\r\n“For us?”\r\n\r\n“Well, for our mob of burglars and second story workers here--the gang\r\nwe represent.” He took a cigarette from the box Kittrell was opening.\r\n\r\n“And will he win?”\r\n\r\n“Will he win?” said Manning, exhaling the words on the thin level\r\nstream of smoke that came from his lungs. “Will he win? In a walk, I\r\ntell you. He’s got ’em beat to a standstill right now. That’s the dope.”\r\n\r\n“But what about this story of--”\r\n\r\n“Aw, that’s all a pipe-dream of Burns’. I’m running it in the morning,\r\nbut it’s nothing; it’s a shine. They’re big fools to print it at all.\r\nBut it’s their last card; they’re desperate. They won’t stop at\r\nanything, or at any crime, except those requiring courage. Burns is in\r\nthere with Benson now; so is Salton, and old man Glenn, and the rest of\r\nthe bunco family. They’re framing it up. When I saw old Glenn go in,\r\nwith his white side whiskers, I knew the widow and the orphan were in\r\ndanger again, and that he was going bravely to the front for ’em. Say,\r\nthat young Banks is comin’, isn’t he? That’s a peach, that cartoon of\r\nhis to-night.”\r\n\r\nKittrell went on down the hall to the art-room to wait until Benson\r\nshould be free. But it was not long until he was sent for, and as\r\nhe entered the managing editor’s room he was instantly sensible of\r\nthe somber atmosphere of a grave and solemn council of war. Benson\r\nintroduced him to Glenn, the banker, to Salton, the party boss, and to\r\nBurns, the president of the street-car company; and as Kittrell sat\r\ndown he looked about him, and could scarcely repress a smile as he\r\nrecalled Manning’s estimate of Glenn. The old man sat there, as solemn\r\nand unctuous as ever he had in his pew at church. Benson, red of face,\r\nwas more plainly perturbed, but Salton was as reserved, as immobile,\r\nas inscrutable as ever, his narrow, pointed face, with its vulpine\r\nexpression, being perhaps paler than usual. Benson had on his desk\r\nbefore him the cartoon Kittrell had finished that day.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kittrell,” Benson began, “we’ve been talking over the political\r\nsituation, and I was showing these gentlemen this cartoon. It isn’t, I\r\nfear, in your best style; it lacks the force, the argument, we’d like\r\njust at this time. That isn’t the _Telegraph_ Clayton, Mr. Kittrell.”\r\nHe pointed with the amber stem of his pipe. “Not at all. Clayton is\r\na strong, smart, unscrupulous, dangerous man! We’ve reached a crisis\r\nin this campaign; if we can’t turn things in the next three days,\r\nwe’re lost, that’s all; we might as well face it. To-morrow we make an\r\nimportant revelation concerning the character of Clayton, and we want\r\nto follow it up the morning after by a cartoon that will be a stunner,\r\na clencher. We have discussed it here among ourselves, and this is our\r\nidea.”\r\n\r\nBenson drew a crude, bald outline, indicating the cartoon they wished\r\nKittrell to draw. The idea was so coarse, so brutal, so revolting,\r\nthat Kittrell stood aghast, and, as he stood, he was aware of Salton’s\r\nlittle eyes fixed on him. Benson waited; they all waited.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Benson, “what do you think of it?”\r\n\r\nKittrell paused an instant, and then said:\r\n\r\n“I won’t draw it; that’s what I think of it.”\r\n\r\nBenson flushed angrily and looked up at him.\r\n\r\n“We are paying you a very large salary, Mr. Kittrell, and your work, if\r\nyou will pardon me, has not been up to what we were led to expect.”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right, Mr. Benson, but I can’t draw that cartoon.”\r\n\r\n“Well, great God!” yelled Burns, “what have we got here--a gold brick?”\r\nHe rose with a vivid sneer on his red face, plunged his hands in\r\nhis pockets, and took two or three nervous strides across the room.\r\nKittrell looked at him, and slowly his eyes blazed out of a face that\r\nhad gone white on the instant.\r\n\r\n“What did you say, sir?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nBurns thrust his red face, with its prognathic jaw, menacingly toward\r\nKittrell.\r\n\r\n“I said that in you we’d got a gold brick.”\r\n\r\n“You?” said Kittrell. “What have you to do with it? I don’t work for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t? Well, I guess it’s us that puts up--”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” said Glenn, waving a white, pacificatory hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes, let me deal with this, if you please,” said Benson, looking hard\r\nat Burns. The street-car man sneered again, then, in ostentatious\r\ncontempt, looked out the window. And in the stillness Benson continued:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kittrell, think a minute. Is your decision final?”\r\n\r\n“It is final, Mr. Benson,” said Kittrell. “And as for you, Burns,” he\r\nglared angrily at the man, “I wouldn’t draw that cartoon for all the\r\ndirty money that all the bribing street-car companies in the world\r\ncould put into Mr. Glenn’s bank here. Good evening, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until he stood again in his own home that Kittrell felt\r\nthe physical effects which the spiritual squalor of such a scene was\r\ncertain to produce in a nature like his.\r\n\r\n“Neil! What is the matter?” Edith fluttered toward him in alarm.\r\n\r\nHe sank into a chair, and for a moment he looked as if he would faint,\r\nbut he looked wanly up at her and said:\r\n\r\n“Nothing; I’m all right; just a little weak. I’ve gone through a\r\nsickening, horrible scene--”\r\n\r\n“Dearest!”\r\n\r\n“And I’m off the _Telegraph_--and a man once more!”\r\n\r\nHe bent over, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and\r\nwhen Edith put her calm, caressing hand on his brow, she found that it\r\nwas moist from nervousness. Presently he was able to tell her the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n“It was, after all, Edith, a fitting conclusion to my experience on\r\nthe _Telegraph_. I suppose, though, that to people who are used to ten\r\nthousand a year such scenes are nothing at all.” She saw in this trace\r\nof his old humor that he was himself again, and she hugged his head to\r\nher bosom.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dearest,” she said, “I’m proud of you--and happy again.”\r\n\r\nThey were, indeed, both happy, happier than they had been in weeks.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after breakfast, she saw by his manner, by the\r\nhumorous, almost comical expression about his eyes, that he had an\r\nidea. In this mood of satisfaction--this mood that comes too seldom\r\nin the artist’s life--she knew it was wise to let him alone. And he\r\nlighted his pipe and went to work. She heard him now and then, singing\r\nor whistling or humming; she scented his pipe, then cigarettes; then,\r\nat last, after two hours, he called in a loud, triumphant tone:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Edith!”\r\n\r\nShe was at the door in an instant, and, waving his hand grandly at his\r\ndrawing-board, he turned to her with that expression which connotes\r\nthe greatest joy gods or mortals can know--the joy of beholding one’s\r\nown work and finding it good. He had, as she saw, returned to the\r\ncartoon of Clayton he had laid aside when the tempter came; and now it\r\nwas finished. Its simple lines revealed Clayton’s character, as the\r\nsufficient answer to all the charges the _Telegraph_ might make against\r\nhim. Edith leaned against the door and looked long and critically.\r\n\r\n“It was fine before,” she said presently; “it’s better now. Before it\r\nwas a portrait of the man; this shows his soul.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s how he looks to me,” said Neil, “after a month in which to\r\nappreciate him.”\r\n\r\n“But what,” she said, stooping and peering at the edge of the drawing,\r\nwhere, despite much knife-scraping, vague figures appeared, “what’s\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m ashamed to tell you,” he said. “I’ll have to paste over that\r\nbefore it’s electrotyped. You see, I had a notion of putting in the\r\ngang, and I drew four little figures--Benson, Burns, Salton and Glenn;\r\nthey were plotting--oh, it was foolish and unworthy. I decided I didn’t\r\nwant anything of hatred in it--just as he wouldn’t want anything of\r\nhatred in it; so I rubbed them out.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m glad. It is beautiful; it makes up for everything; it’s an\r\nappreciation--worthy of the man.”\r\n\r\nWhen Kittrell entered the office of the _Post_, the boys greeted\r\nhim with delight, and his presence made a sensation, for there had\r\nbeen rumors of the break which the absence of a “Kit” cartoon in the\r\n_Telegraph_ that morning had confirmed. But, if Hardy was surprised,\r\nhis surprise was swallowed up in his joy, and Kittrell was grateful to\r\nhim for the delicacy with which he touched the subject that consumed\r\nthe newspaper and political world with curiosity.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad, Kit,” was all that he said. “You know that.”\r\n\r\nThen he forgot everything in the cartoon, and he showed his instant\r\nrecognition of its significance by snatching out his watch, pushing\r\na button, and saying to Garland, who came to the door in his\r\nshirt-sleeves:\r\n\r\n“Tell Nic to hold the first edition for a five-column first-page\r\ncartoon. And send this up right away.”\r\n\r\nThey had a last look at it before it went, and after gazing a moment in\r\nsilence Hardy said:\r\n\r\n“It’s the greatest thing you ever did, Kit, and it comes at the\r\npsychological moment. It’ll elect him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, he was elected anyhow.”\r\n\r\nHardy shook his head, and in the movement Kittrell saw how the strain\r\nof the campaign had told on him. “No, he wasn’t; the way they’ve been\r\nhammering him is something fierce; and the _Telegraph_--well, your\r\ncartoons and all, you know.”\r\n\r\n“But my cartoons in the _Telegraph_ were rotten. Any work that is not\r\nsincere, not intellectually honest--”\r\n\r\nHardy interrupted him:\r\n\r\n“Yes; but, Kit, you’re so good that your rotten is better than ’most\r\nanybody’s best.” He smiled, and Kittrell blushed and looked away.\r\n\r\nHardy was right. The “Kit” cartoon, back in the _Post_, created its\r\nsensation, and after it appeared the political reporters said it had\r\nstarted a landslide to Clayton; that the betting was 4 to 1 and no\r\ntakers, and that it was all over but the shouting.\r\n\r\nThat night, as they were at dinner, the telephone rang, and in a minute\r\nNeil knew by Edith’s excited and delighted reiteration of “yes,” “yes,”\r\nwho had called up. And then he heard her say:\r\n\r\n“Indeed I will; I’ll come every night and sit in the front seat.”\r\n\r\nWhen Kittrell displaced Edith at the telephone, he heard the voice of\r\nJohn Clayton, lower in register and somewhat husky after four weeks’\r\nspeaking, but more musical than ever in Kittrell’s ears when it said:\r\n\r\n“I just told the little woman, Neil, that I didn’t know how to say it,\r\nso I wanted her to thank you for me. It was beautiful in you, and I\r\nwish I were worthy of it; it was simply your own good soul expressing\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was the last delight to Kittrell to hear that voice and to know\r\nthat all was well.\r\n\r\nBut one question remained unsettled. Kittrell had been on the\r\n_Telegraph_ a month, and his contract differed from that ordinarily\r\nmade by the members of a newspaper staff in that he was paid by the\r\nyear, though in monthly instalments. Kittrell knew that he had broken\r\nhis contract on grounds which the sordid law would not see or recognize\r\nand the average court think absurd, and that the _Telegraph_ might\r\nlegally refuse to pay him at all. He hoped the _Telegraph_ would do\r\nthis! But it did not; on the contrary, he received the next day a check\r\nfor his month’s work. He held it up for Edith’s inspection.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I’ll have to send it back,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think me quixotic?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we’re poor enough as it is--let’s have some luxuries; let’s be\r\nquixotic until after election, at least.”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said Neil; “just what I was thinking. I’m going to do a cartoon\r\nevery day for the _Post_ until election day, and I’m not going to take\r\na cent. I don’t want to crowd Banks out, you know, and I want to do my\r\npart for Clayton and the cause, and do it, just once, for the pure love\r\nof the thing.”\r\n\r\nThose last days of the campaign were, indeed, luxuries to Kittrell and\r\nto Edith, days of work and fun and excitement. All day Kittrell worked\r\non his cartoons, and in the evening they went to Clayton’s meetings.\r\nThe experience was a revelation to them both--the crowds, the waiting\r\nfor the singing of the automobile’s siren, the wild cheers that greeted\r\nClayton, and then his speech, his appeals to the best there was in\r\nmen. He had never made such speeches, and long afterward Edith could\r\nhear those cheers and see the faces of those working-men aglow with\r\nthe hope, the passion, the fervent religion of democracy. And those\r\ndays came to their glad climax that night when they met at the office\r\nof the _Post_ to receive the returns, in an atmosphere quivering with\r\nexcitement, with messenger boys and reporters coming and going, and\r\nin the street outside an immense crowd, swaying and rocking between\r\nthe walls on either side, with screams and shouts and mad huzzas, and\r\nthe wild blowing of horns--all the hideous, happy noise an American\r\nelection-night crowd can make.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening Clayton had made his way, somehow unnoticed,\r\nthrough the crowd, and entered the office. He was happy in the great\r\ntriumph he would not accept as personal, claiming it always for the\r\ncause; but as he dropped into the chair Hardy pushed toward him, they\r\nall saw how weary he was.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment the roar in the street below swelled to a mighty\r\ncrescendo, and Hardy cried:\r\n\r\n“Look!”\r\n\r\nThey ran to the window. The boys up-stairs who were manipulating the\r\nstereopticon, had thrown on the screen an enormous picture of Clayton,\r\nthe portrait Kittrell had drawn for his cartoon.\r\n\r\n“Will you say now there isn’t the personal note in it?” Edith asked.\r\n\r\nClayton glanced out the window, across the dark, surging street, at the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s not me they’re cheering for,” he said; “it’s for Kit, here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps some of it’s for him,” Edith admitted loyally.\r\n\r\nThey were silent, seized irresistibly by the emotion that mastered the\r\nmighty crowd in the dark streets below. Edith was strangely moved.\r\nPresently she could speak:\r\n\r\n“Is there anything sweeter in life than to know that you have done a\r\ngood thing--and done it well?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Clayton, “just one: to have a few friends who understand.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Edith. “It is so with art, and it must be so with\r\nlife; it makes an art of life.”\r\n\r\nIt was dark enough there by the window for her to slip her hand into\r\nthat of Neil, who had been musing silently on the crowd.\r\n\r\n“I can never say again,” she said softly, “that those people are not\r\nworth sacrifice. They are worth all; they are everything; they are\r\nthe hope of the world; and their longings and their needs, and the\r\npossibility of bringing them to pass, are all that give significance to\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what America is for,” said Clayton, “and it’s worth while to\r\nbe allowed to help even in a little way to make, as old Walt says, ‘a\r\nnation of friends, of equals.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAS-BEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Holman loitered along the pavement that June morning, glad once\r\nmore to be back in Springfield after so many years, he recalled with\r\na sigh another morning, far gone, when first he had come up to the\r\ncapital of his state. “A morning just like this,” he was thinking,\r\n“all green and sunny and hopeful and--pure. My God!” But he put aside\r\nregret; it was enough just then to be back after so many years of\r\nabsence--years of dingy poverty which had kept him down in stupid\r\nJasper, never once able to get back during the session, if only for a\r\nday to see the boys!--even as a man of fifty, with gray hair straggling\r\nbeneath his broad, slouch hat, with his long, dusty coat, and worn,\r\nold shoes, that fell softly on the hot sidewalk, far other than the\r\nyoung representative who had come up to the capital so long before. In\r\nCapitol Avenue he had the state house in full view, the gray, swelling\r\ndome still patiently brooding over the stupidities and trivialities\r\nwhich the bickering human beings, running about like insects below,\r\nwere proudly and solemnly achieving. The little flags were at their\r\nstaffs on either wing. Once, at the sight he might have hurried,\r\nknowing his presence to be required beneath that flag on the house\r\nwing. No need now to hasten any more; he was not needed there, nor\r\nanywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe sidewalk was filled with men striding like the statesmen they felt\r\nthemselves to be, and none among them now to remember him; but he\r\nwalked with them under the railroad’s ugly trestle, past the old white\r\nhouse on the little hill, still with its lightning-rod to keep alive\r\none of the best of Lincoln stories, and up the broad walk to the state\r\nhouse. Inside, the cool shades of the big pile were grateful as they\r\nused to be. Through the open doors of offices he could see clerks at\r\nwork, or at least at desks, somehow coming off victorious, it seemed,\r\nin their desperate business of holding on to their slippery, eel-like,\r\npolitical jobs; then the crowded elevator--and the inevitable old\r\nsoldier to operate it. All as it used to be; and he, like some risen\r\nghost long since laid in its political grave, stalking among earthly\r\npresences that had forgotten him.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeepers at the house regarded him with the official misanthropy\r\nand distrust, but Holman quelled their glance, pronounced the word\r\n“Ex-member,” and so passed in to the one barren prerogative left him\r\nout of the years of former power and prestige.\r\n\r\nThe house, on the order of senate bills on first reading, was\r\ninattentive; members lolled in their seats, read newspapers, talked,\r\ngossiped, wrote letters, now and then threw paper wads at one\r\nanother--incipiencies of that horseplay which would mark the session’s\r\nclose. The clerk mumbled the said senate bills on first reading, the\r\nspeaker turned in his chair to talk with some one on the divan behind\r\nhim, swinging about now and then to say, “First reading of the bill!”\r\nand to tap the sounding-board with his gavel. And, of them all, not one\r\nhe knew, not one to recognize him! But, yes, there was one, after all;\r\njust one. Down the center aisle, reclining in his chair nonchalantly,\r\nwas a young fellow, almost a boy to Holman’s disadvantage point of\r\nyears, whose head, turned at that instant, showed a profile which,\r\nwhen age and authority should visit it, would cause one to remark it;\r\na fair brow, strong nose and good-humored lips parting now in a smile\r\nat some remark a member across the aisle had made. As Holman looked at\r\nyoung McCray his mind went back to another morning in another June,\r\nwhen the air came in through the tall, open windows with the breath\r\nof young summer in Illinois, the very odor of the prairie flowers\r\nthemselves, the morning that Baldwin had come to him. And now McCray\r\nsat there, representing his old district, with all the opportunities,\r\ndreams, ambitions, illusions he himself had had--and lost.\r\n\r\nBut Holman was not much given to introspection--his eye was not long\r\nturned inward; and now, turned outward, it lighted on a white head far\r\ndown toward the front of the house.\r\n\r\n“Why, if there isn’t, after all, one o’ the old-timers! Say, young\r\nfellow,” he said, speaking to an assistant sergeant-at-arms who had\r\nbeen standing near and, unable to identify Holman as a representative\r\nof any railroad or other interest entitled to respect on that floor,\r\nhad been eying him with some suspicion. “Say,” said Holman, pointing\r\nwith a long forefinger, “ain’t that old Ike Bemis down there--Bemis, of\r\nTazewell? Yes? Well, now, just call a page boy, won’t you? And have him\r\ntell Bemis an old friend wants to see him.”\r\n\r\nBemis was, in his way, a phenomenon unparalleled in politics; he had\r\nbeen in the house before Holman and had held on, minority member\r\nfrom his district, the Republican and Democratic machines working\r\nharmoniously together, for a quarter of a century. And as he came up\r\nthe aisle in response to Holman’s message he seemed to Holman to have\r\nchanged little; only his hair from iron gray had grown white, and his\r\nface was not so clear or ruddy or healthy as he had known it. He was\r\ndressed as he used to be in the gray clothes that made him look so like\r\na prosperous farmer, and the hand he held out to Holman was, by some\r\nmystery, rough and horny, as if it had worked indeed.\r\n\r\n“Why, bless the Lord!” he cried, “if it ain’t Jim Holman!”\r\n\r\nHe shook Holman’s hand with genuine pleasure and, putting his arm\r\nacross Holman’s shoulders, led him away to a divan under the gallery.\r\n\r\nThey sat down there and for half an hour chatted and gossiped, recalled\r\nold friends and associates of legislatures that were gone, discussed\r\nthem, accounted for them, pursued their subsequent histories in\r\npolitics or out of politics, their triumphs, their failures and their\r\nfates--in short, they reconstructed their own little world and caught\r\nup with the times.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t what it used to be, Jim,” said Bemis with an old man’s\r\ndeploration of change. “You did right to get out of it. I don’t want\r\nany more of it. When this session closes I’m through; I won’t run\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nHolman was not greatly impressed; politicians, he knew, were always\r\nmaking their last campaign, as sailors were always making their last\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n“_Sine die_ adjournment next week, and then good-by to politics for\r\nme,” Bemis went on. “I’ll be glad to be shut of it all. Nothing in it,\r\nnothing in it.” He wagged his sage head sadly.\r\n\r\n“Anything--ah--doing this session?” asked Holman, glancing sidewise at\r\nhis old colleague.\r\n\r\n“No, nothing except this Chicago street-car bill. We passed it, you\r\nknow, and the governor vetoed it. The reformers raised an awful howl.\r\nComes up--let’s see--to-night, I reckon. Going to try to pass it over\r\nthe governor’s veto.”\r\n\r\n“Will they make it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t know. Looks dubious. The senate’s all right, of course;\r\nit’s all fixed there, but the house ain’t certain. A two-thirds vote’s\r\nhard to get these days. Baldwin’s been working day and night--but I\r\ndon’t know; you can’t tell yet.”\r\n\r\nThen the house broke into new confusion. Holman knew the signs well; a\r\nroll-call was on. Bemis pricked his ears and hurried back to his seat.\r\n\r\nHolman was glad just then to have him go, for almost at the mention\r\nof the name of Baldwin he had happened to glance toward the speaker’s\r\nchair; the speaker had risen, his gavel poised, and in that instant\r\nHolman saw the man on the speaker’s lounge, lolling back to await the\r\npassing of the interruption, and recognized Baldwin, George R. Baldwin,\r\ncarefully dressed as of old, suave, elegant, dignified, all unchanged\r\nsave that his hair had grown a bit more gray, though only, it seemed,\r\nto lend to his aspect new dignity, new authority, almost refinement.\r\nBaldwin, the same as ever! It had not changed him, evidently; he was\r\nstill correct, irreproachable, respected, received everywhere--while\r\nhe, Holman, had come to this. Sarah, back there at home, amid the\r\ndingy poverty and drudgery of her life; and Baldwin’s wife, doubtless,\r\nwelcome in all society and reigning there! Holman, sick of the scene,\r\ngot up, plunged his hands into his pockets and started out. Near the\r\ndoor he turned to have another glance. Baldwin had slid to the end of\r\nthe lounge and was talking to some young fellow--to McCray.\r\n\r\nHolman went to the cigar stand, lighted a cigar, sauntered out into the\r\nrotunda and leaned against the brass rail. He blew out streams of smoke\r\nand through squinting little eyes watched them float away; he smoked\r\nand squinted and thought, and what he saw was Baldwin, the lobbyist,\r\nand young McCray.\r\n\r\nTwo men passed on their way over to the senate chamber, and he heard\r\none of them pronounce his name.\r\n\r\n“----leaning on the rail there, smoking.\r\n\r\n“Oh--I forgot; his face was familiar, too. The old Has-been has come\r\nback for a day!”\r\n\r\nIt was Baldwin who spoke; his companion was young McCray.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! An old Has-been,” thought Holman. Baldwin said that, and\r\nMcCray! They said that even down in Jasper. But Baldwin, he was no\r\nHas-been; it had not affected him at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Holman entered the house that afternoon he was sensible\r\nof a change in the atmosphere. The new element was one he\r\nrecognized--skilled as of old in legislative aëroscepsy--one that\r\nstrangely excited him, both by what it recalled and by what it\r\nportended; there were tension, alertness, irritability and suspense,\r\nthe knowledge of an evil, sinister Presence, known, silent, unrevealed,\r\nbut apprehended--a Presence expected, even desired, yet dreaded; in\r\nshort, the psychic condition that exists in a legislative chamber when\r\nsomething is about to come off. Holman, standing well back by the\r\ncloak-room, examining the house with expert eye, knew that the thing\r\nwas imminent, though not immediate. There were certain signs wanting.\r\nThe speaker sat calm, but he was twirling his gavel nervously; the\r\nleaders were restless and furtive, but they had not as yet got every\r\nman in his seat. McCray, for instance, was absent.\r\n\r\nHolman sauntered carelessly around to the side on which Bemis sat,\r\ncaught the old man’s eye and beckoned.\r\n\r\n“I thought they’d get that bill up,” said Holman, “and I’d see a little\r\nfun; but there seems to be no chance of that. Reckon I’ll go.”\r\n\r\n“There’s been a hitch,” said Bemis in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“Has, heh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bemis; “the boys thought they had it fixed, but Wimbleton\r\nswitched; told O’Leary so at noon. Either the governor got around him\r\nor he got scared.”\r\n\r\n“Need only one vote?” surmised Holman. Then Bemis, as if a thought had\r\nstruck him, drew close and put his lips to Holman’s ear:\r\n\r\n“You know that young McCray from your district?”\r\n\r\n“Sure.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, Jim, if you could fix him--you might get in on this thing.\r\nHe won’t do business with any of us. I don’t know exactly, but I should\r\nthink there’d be for you and him at least--” He put his lips quite into\r\nHolman’s ear, and Holman bent lower; and Bemis whispered again. Holman\r\ndid not move a muscle. Bemis withdrew a little and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know McCray very well,” said Holman presently. “He’s a\r\nyoungster, and I’ve been out of politics a long time. But I might have\r\na little talk with him. I can’t promise, though--an old Has-been like\r\nme, you know.” He laughed a small bitter laugh.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you!” said Bemis striking him softly on the shoulder. “You a\r\nHas-been! Why, Jim, you’re the slickest man in southern Illinois--when\r\nyou want to be!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHolman found McCray in the Leland bar-room. The young man was plainly\r\nin some mental stress, his hair matted to his brow, his face moist with\r\nperspiration, and drawn, and in his eyes an utter weariness.\r\n\r\n“Just the man I was looking for,” said Holman. “I came to see you about\r\na little matter down in Jasper; some interests I represent--constits of\r\nyours--and I’ve got to hurry back. So, just give me a minute; I’ll not\r\nkeep you long.”\r\n\r\nMcCray looked at his watch. “I”--he hesitated--“I must get over to the\r\nhouse; I’m late, anyway. I was detained--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” said Holman, “but I’ve got to see you. It’s something\r\nyou’re interested in, anyway. If you’ll just walk along a little way\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\nOnce outside, Holman kept on out Sixth Street, and McCray, wondering\r\nsomewhat, did not demur.\r\n\r\n“McCray, you don’t know me well,” Holman began; “I’m an old-timer--a\r\nHas-been, as I overheard a man say this morning. You’re a young man;\r\nyou come from my district--or, perhaps, I’d better say I come from\r\nyours. I came here one session, just as you have done, from old Jasper,\r\nand I served, in all, four sessions. During that time I saw a lot of\r\nlife and of men; I learned a lot, too, and then I gave it up--and quit.\r\nThis morning I came back for a little holiday, and I strolled over to\r\nthe house to see how the old place looked once more, just as all the\r\nHas-beens do; they always manage to get back, some way or another,\r\nevery session; it’s a habit, a fever, a disease--get it once, a fellow\r\nnever gets over it. Well, this morning, as I stood there looking around\r\nI saw you; and that and one thing and another reminded me of something.\r\nI saw you sitting there--young, ambitious, bright, with the world\r\nbefore you,--and, well, my boy, I took a kind of liking for you all of\r\na sudden; but that’s neither here nor there. What I was reminded of,\r\ncuriously enough, was another young fellow I used to know years ago--a\r\nfellow that didn’t look so much like you, perhaps, and yet who was like\r\nyou in many ways.\r\n\r\n“It must have been, let’s see, back in the--well, no matter, I don’t\r\nexactly recall just now, and it isn’t material. But this young fellow\r\ncame up from down our way to take his seat for the first time in the\r\nlegislature. He was a young lawyer, smart, good-looking, a fellow every\r\none liked. He had the gift of the gab; he could make a rattling speech,\r\nwas strong on the stump and good before a jury. Everybody wanted to see\r\nhim succeed. He was ambitious--ambitious as Lincoln, ambitious as the\r\ndevil. His ambitions were not selfish--that is, not so damned selfish.\r\nHe was no reformer, nothing like that; but he really wanted to help his\r\npeople, wanted to do something to make life a little easier, a little\r\nbetter for the average fellow--like those he knew back home. He didn’t\r\nhave, perhaps, any very clear idea how he was going to do this, but he\r\nwanted to do it somehow, and, vaguely enough, I reckon, he felt that\r\nthe chance would turn up. Back home, too, there was a girl--you got a\r\ngirl, McCray?”\r\n\r\nThe young man, startled by the abrupt question, turned up to Holman,\r\nwho shambled along a head taller than he, a face that went red; a smile\r\ncame to it, then, suddenly, it went gray and he turned away.\r\n\r\n“Beg your pardon,” said Holman, “that’s none of my business, of course.\r\nBut this fellow of mine, he had a girl back there. I knew about it; we\r\nwere young members, first term, and he used to tell me things. And he\r\nwanted to marry this girl and make her happy. He thought, you see, that\r\nby being something, doing something in the world, he could do _that_.”\r\n\r\nThey were by this time far out Sixth Street, at the edge of town; a\r\nlittle farther on lay the open country. They came to a pasture with a\r\nbroken fence and a tree.\r\n\r\n“Let’s sit down here,” Holman said, “and rest, and I’ll get on with my\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\nThey sat side by side on the bank at the roots of the elm, and Holman,\r\nhaving finished his cigar and being a man who seemed to require tobacco\r\nin some form every moment of the day, drew out a long plug and a knife\r\nand cut a piece and put it comfortably into his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Chew?” he said, proffering tobacco and knife. McCray shook his head,\r\nbut lighted a cigarette. And the old and the new generation sat there\r\nside by side on the bank.\r\n\r\n“Interested?” asked Holman.\r\n\r\n“Yes; go on.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this young fellow I’m telling you of--the legislature was just a\r\nstepping-stone to him; that’s what he thought and that’s what everybody\r\nthought; beyond that were congress, governor, senator, everything. He\r\nwent right ahead, was popular and influential, got good committees,\r\nand when he got up to speak the house grew quiet--you’ve seen it that\r\nway yourself--and he worked and studied, and back home there was the\r\ngirl--and they wanted to get married. But he was poor--mighty poor.”\r\n\r\nHolman leaned over, stretched out his long, thin arm--McCray noted\r\nthe frayed cuffbands--and plucked a spear of young grass, pulled the\r\nthin, transparent, whitish-green blade out of its delicate sheath\r\nand, squinting his eyes, examined it minutely, as if it were the most\r\nengrossing object of study in the world.\r\n\r\n“A legislature, McCray,” he went on, “is the damnedest thing in the\r\nworld, the rottenest, most demoralizing, hell-fire sort of institution\r\nthere is. All politics is that way, no matter where you find it.\r\nSometimes I think you can’t get within forty rows o’ apple trees of it\r\nwithout being polluted. A man, to go to a legislature and stay there\r\nany time and come out whole and safe and sound, has to be made of pure\r\ngold. Now, this young friend of mine, he was, as I’ve said, all right\r\nat heart, and pretty strong, too, most ways; good family, good blood\r\nand all that; and back home there, in safe surroundings, he’d ’ave\r\ngot along all right till the end. But in the legislature a fellow’s\r\naway from home, away from all his customary moorings, and most of the\r\nmembers get it into their heads that at the capital all the rules are\r\nsuspended, and I reckon they are--that’s about what government, as we\r\nadminister it, amounts to.\r\n\r\n“No one from home ever shows up there. The only ones that come around\r\ncome to get something for themselves, and it’s always something they\r\nhave no right to and oughtn’t to have. They come with all kinds\r\nof plausible reasons and lies and temptations--damned sneaking,\r\nhypocritical, white-washed sepulchers! Eminent and respectable\r\ncitizens, best people and all that! And unless a fellow has his eyes\r\nwide open all the time, has his principles clear and fixed and knows\r\nenough to apply ’em every minute, knows what a bunco game it all is,\r\nand is of pure gold besides--as I said--why, he gets all tangled up\r\nand lost--yes, lost. It pretty much all comes from the cities. We poor\r\njays from the country districts don’t know anything about the cities;\r\nwe take what they tell us, or did in my time. We think if we just pass\r\na few laws to make our fellow-citizens in the cities good, regulate\r\ntheir beer for ’em and all that, that nothing else is required of us;\r\nso these fellows come down from the city and get us to do their dirty\r\nwork for them. In those days there was a fellow here, a lobbyist, a\r\ngood-looking man, about the size and favor of--well, Baldwin back\r\nthere--saw him talking to you this morning--same kind of a man exactly,\r\nsmooth, genial, polished, well-dressed, polite, good fellow, and all\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“Now, Baldwin--I mean the fellow--well, damn it!” Holman suddenly\r\nexploded in his exasperation, “it _was_ Baldwin! He had a bill he was\r\ntrying to pass, a crooked bill, of course, one of those bills like\r\nthis street-car bill I heard of to-day, to take something that by\r\nrights belonged to the people of the city, a street, or the ground\r\nunder a street, or the air over a street, or the room in the middle of\r\na street, and give it to half a dozen eminently respectable and pious\r\ncitizens to use for themselves and exploit and get rich on. Baldwin\r\nwas trying to pass that bill, and the session was nearly done, and he\r\nneeded just one vote. And he looked around and he settled on this young\r\nfriend of mine; he knew his hopes, his wants, his necessities--knew all\r\nabout him, for that’s Baldwin’s business and his way. I needn’t go into\r\nthe details; he worked with him a whole day and nearly a whole night;\r\nexplained that it was really a good thing for the city, that this young\r\nfellow’s constits were not interested in the city, anyway, didn’t know\r\nanything about it, nor care anything about it. ‘It can’t hurt you,’\r\nBaldwin would say. ‘Your people won’t know or care; of course, if\r\nit was something they were interested in it might be different’--and\r\nall that. And then, finally, ’way in the night, when the young fellow\r\nwas worn down in will, and tired and weak and dazed anyway, Baldwin\r\nbegan to count the money down on the table, among the stinking whisky\r\nglasses and cigar butts, thousand-dollar bills, green as that grass\r\nthere, one--two--three--like that.” McCray, with a kind of fascination,\r\nwatched Holman as with slow gesture of his long hands he turned over,\r\nas it were, and laid down one after another those thousand-dollar\r\nbills. “And the young man fell,” said Holman at last. And then he was\r\nsilent, his gaze fixed afar on some light across the fields.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Holman resumed, “Baldwin was right in one way, at any rate; the\r\npeople, the young fellow’s people down home, didn’t care. They never do\r\ncare; they don’t take the trouble. They never knew, anyway, and they\r\nelected him again and re-elected him. And he got married and things\r\nseemed to go along all right with him; you would have said he was to\r\nbe envied. But, while nothing seemed to change outside, something did\r\nchange inside the young man; and the worst of it was, it was a change\r\nthat he didn’t know or realize. It was like some disease, working away,\r\nworking away there inside of him, without any pain or any symptoms\r\neven; he had no idea of it. But there it was, working away, working\r\naway. He found, at first, that it was easy enough to get money, and\r\nhe got it and he spent it and it never did him any good, never a bit,\r\nneither him nor his family. Easy money, they call it; but there’s\r\nno such thing. All money, even easy money, is hard; you got to pay\r\nsomehow, you got to pay!\r\n\r\n“He changed by slow degrees; first he got careless and slovenly in his\r\nthoughts, and, after a while, didn’t think much anyway, and couldn’t;\r\nhe just talked and talked and talked and made loud speeches--became a\r\nwindbag, a blatherskite, a bore and a nuisance in the land, to himself\r\nand everybody. There’s a lot of them in this land; all they need to\r\nmake a speech is room enough to work their jaws in. His old wishes and\r\nlongings to be of some use in the world died out of him; he had no\r\naims, no mark to head for, no place to go. He became ineffectual; after\r\nwhile all there was to him was that one vote of his in the house, and\r\nby and by that wasn’t worth much; it kept declining in value, he got\r\ncheaper and cheaper, and finally--just naturally petered out.\r\n\r\n“Then, when he was slouchy in morals and mind and character, he got\r\nslouchy in person; his habits weren’t bad, perhaps; he was no drunkard\r\nor anything like that, but just--oh, sloppy, every way. And his wife,\r\nhis little wife--she was a fine, pretty girl, McCray, when he married\r\nher--she, of course, had to pay, too, along with him; he dragged her\r\ndown. She was patient and kind and always hopeful, but they were poor,\r\nand under the stress of their necessities he would get peevish and\r\ncross, and sometimes when, say, a Saturday night would come and there\r\nwasn’t anything in the house to eat--well, he’d look at the children\r\nand get mad--mad at himself, primarily, though he didn’t say so or\r\nadmit it even to himself--and he’d take it out in nasty, mean ways with\r\nher and the children. Finally, she gave up; she didn’t know why, she\r\nnever knew what had happened, or, if she did, she never even hinted\r\nit--and the whole family was just going down to hell and the devil.\r\nThere wasn’t any outward tragedy to make it striking or dramatic or\r\neven interesting.\r\n\r\n“And then, after everybody half knew or half guessed, and had ceased\r\nto respect him, he came back here to Springfield once, as we all do,\r\nand happened to see Baldwin, and found him the same, scarcely a day\r\nolder, though he himself was gray and withered. It hadn’t hurt Baldwin;\r\nhe was well-dressed, respectable, popular, received everywhere--clubs,\r\nsociety, church and all, just as the men were whose dirty money Baldwin\r\nhandled. And Baldwin’s wife, she wasn’t old and sad and hopeless; she\r\nwas going out in society, president of a big woman’s club, talked\r\nabout safe little reforms, charities and philanthropies. And Baldwin’s\r\ndaughters were over in Europe getting the last finish on their\r\neducation.”\r\n\r\nHolman had a feeling that McCray was no longer listening and, glancing\r\naside, saw that McCray’s face was buried in his hands. And with pity in\r\nhis long, gray face he looked at him a little while, then laid a hand\r\non McCray’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he said, “why I told you this story? You see, I didn’t\r\nwant to make you feel bad; I only wanted to show you. Because there’s a\r\nlot in you--a big, beautiful future.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t say that,” cried McCray. “All but that last--all but that\r\nlast.”\r\n\r\n“Why not that?”\r\n\r\n“Because it’s too late. Oh, Holman, it’s too late--too late! If it were\r\nonly yesterday! But now--it’s too late!”\r\n\r\nAnd McCray bent forward, bowed in pain, and wept.\r\n\r\nHolman waited until the boy’s grief subsided, and then, by degrees,\r\nhe got the story. To McCray it was an irreclaimable and tragic wreck\r\nof life. But to Holman, in the broader vision his own sins had made\r\npossible, and in some of his judgments of men, perhaps too broad--if,\r\nindeed, that may be--the case was not at all hopeless. He had not, it\r\nis true, been prepared for a revelation so complete and damaging, but\r\nit presented to him no irrevocable aspect. McCray, with the proclivity\r\nof youth to fixed and fated facts, saw the thing consummated and\r\ncomplete, the contract wholly executed; but Holman did not regard it\r\nas even executory, and he cited for McCray the old adage about the bad\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\n“We’ll just give the stuff back to Baldwin.”\r\n\r\n“Before?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Holman stoutly, “afterward. After the vote; we’ll have that\r\nsatisfaction. Keep him on the hooks.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said McCray. “But here, you take it. It--burns--” He gave to\r\nHolman a roll of bills, and sighed in relief. “You have saved me,” he\r\nsaid; “you have saved my soul.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, to hell with your soul!” Holman said, with more orthodoxy than he\r\nwas accustomed to evince. He was not sufficiently accustomed to the\r\nhighly moral to relish its too bald expression; perhaps his experience\r\nhad been of one other as yet unrecognized benefit--it had made him\r\nwholesomely afraid of cant, and whatever good his spiritual adventure\r\nof that day had done, or was to do him, he was in little danger of\r\nbecoming a Pharisee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreggerson, the clerk of the house, in shirt-sleeves, a handkerchief\r\nstuffed into his collar, had himself taken the reading-desk that night.\r\nAbove him the speaker, bent forward, watched the proceedings like some\r\nbird of prey, smiting his desk sharply with his gavel now and then, or\r\npointing it fiercely at some one. Above the speaker, in placid folds,\r\nwas the flag, and from their large canvases on either side of the\r\nhouse, Lincoln and Douglas surveyed the scene from the calm altitude of\r\ntheir secure place in American statesmanship.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill had come over from the senate half an hour before, the\r\ncrowd had rushed over with it, burst into the house and pushed down the\r\naisle, choking the passage. Holman saw several senators come over to\r\nsee the end; he saw the governor’s private secretary, and old Benson,\r\nthe governor’s political manager, and--Baldwin, suave and bland as\r\nusual, yet, as Holman could see on a second closer look, intensely\r\nanxious and concerned. He was paler than Holman had ever seen him.\r\nThe air of the chamber was hot and fetid; there was a low, ominous\r\ngrumbling. Dalby was on his feet on the Republican side, Quinn on the\r\nDemocratic--the program under Baldwin’s eye and the speaker’s would\r\nbe hurried through. In the curious way in which secrets cease to be\r\nsecrets and permeate the mind of the mass, it was generally known how\r\nevery man would vote, and it was understood that the climax, somehow,\r\nwould come with the calling of the name of McCray, of Jasper. The\r\nroll-call moved slowly on down the alphabet; Greggerson’s voice\r\nresounded; its boom could have been heard through open windows three\r\nblocks away:\r\n\r\n“Lyendorf!”\r\n\r\n“Aye.”\r\n\r\n“Lynn, of Sangamon!”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Lynn, of Vermilion!”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“McBroom!”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“McCoy!”\r\n\r\n“Aye.”\r\n\r\n“McCray!”\r\n\r\nHolman strained forward with the crowd. McCray hesitated, looked up,\r\nthen shouted:\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp volley of applause, a clapping of hands which had in\r\nit perhaps, a certain too self-righteous quality; and there were human\r\ngroans and hoots, and at his elbow Holman heard an oath and turned to\r\nface Baldwin. The face of the lobbyist was white with rage and moist\r\nwith fine globules of perspiration, and there were revealed to Holman\r\nin the brilliant, new illuminations of that moment certain lines that\r\nonce had not been there, lines not drawn by age, and Holman saw them\r\nwith a fierce, vindictive joy.\r\n\r\nBut McCray was coming, battling his way down the aisle, escaping the\r\ncongratulations, curses, praises, objurgations of the men who crowded\r\nabout him. He got away from them and came back, and, as he took\r\nHolman’s hand, his tired, drawn face was touched with a smile. Baldwin,\r\nthere beside them, saw it, stared at Holman incredulously and said:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ll be damned!”\r\n\r\nBut Holman had no attention for Baldwin then.\r\n\r\n“Let’s get out of this,” he said to McCray.\r\n\r\nAnd when, out of that weltering chaos, they found themselves in the\r\nrotunda, in the mysterious semi-gloom that filled its great, inverted\r\nbowl, the gloom which all the electric lights could not wholly\r\ndissipate, Holman quickly drew his hand from his pocket, pressed it\r\ninto McCray’s, and said:\r\n\r\n“Here, this belongs to--” Holman hesitated, as at a new point in ethics.\r\n\r\n“To Baldwin,” said McCray. “Yes,” he went on wearily, “I’ll give it\r\nback to him.”\r\n\r\n“To think of an old Has-been like me,” said Holman, “that hasn’t seen\r\nso much easy money in a coon’s age--and to go toting it around all day\r\nin his pocket! McCray, I’m afraid I’m getting too damned civic! I’ll be\r\na reformer next, and back in politics!” He laughed again. “We’ll wait\r\nhere a little. Baldwin’ll be along, and I’ll stay and see you safely\r\nthrough it.”\r\n\r\nBaldwin was coming even then, and in a moment espied them there by the\r\nrail. He had recovered himself; the mask of years could not be lowered\r\nlong; he came on leisurely, even pausing to light a cigarette. Holman\r\nhailed him:\r\n\r\n“Lost out, didn’t you, George?”\r\n\r\n“So it seems,” Baldwin replied. “When you do business on honor you must\r\nexpect to be betrayed once in a while. It’s all in the game. But where\r\ndo you come in, Jim--an old back number like you?”\r\n\r\n“Does seem funny, doesn’t it? An old Has-been like me! Well, I saw a\r\ngood thing coming off and I declared myself in. But McCray has a little\r\nbusiness with you, and when you’re through with him, maybe I can make\r\nit plain to you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have no further business with Mr. McCray. I’m quite through\r\nwith _him_.” And he turned his back deliberately on the young man.\r\n\r\nMcCray bit his lip, then remembered and became humble, and, putting\r\nforth his hand, said:\r\n\r\n“Here--here’s your--money.”\r\n\r\nBaldwin turned, took the money, thrust it carelessly into his pocket,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n“I can’t count it here, of course. I _presume_ it’s all there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Holman, “it’s all there. Such work is done on honor, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.” Baldwin delicately drew on his cigarette, blew the smoke\r\nupward. “But--that question, Jim, that one unanswered question. Where\r\ndo you come in? What is there in this for you?”\r\n\r\nHolman looked at him from top to toe with a long, cold, steady gaze.\r\n\r\n“Well, George,” he began slowly, “for me there’s nothing in it, in the\r\nway you think--in the only terms you can think in, I mean. There is,\r\nhowever, in another way, a lot in it; a lot I haven’t dreamed of for\r\nyears. All day, while arranging and planning this--the idea came to\r\nme suddenly this morning--I’ve been looking forward to this moment,\r\nthinking of what I’d say and what satisfaction I’d have in saying it.\r\nI thought that that satisfaction would pay me for all you’ve done--for\r\nall you’ve tried to do to this boy here--for all--no, damn it! not for\r\nall!--all hell and eternity couldn’t pay you for _all_ you’ve done--to\r\nother boys like him. But now, as I look at your face and study it, I\r\nsee that you just couldn’t understand, that’s all; you have lost the\r\nability to understand--and--well, George, that mere fact will pay you,\r\nso I won’t try to say it. I’ll say only good-by, and when you get\r\nhome to that wife and those daughters of yours--just remember that\r\nJim Holman asked you how you could look them in the eyes. Do that and\r\nmaybe--you’ll understand.”\r\n\r\nBaldwin stared at him; the mask shifted an instant, then, instantly\r\nrestored, he turned away.\r\n\r\n“He looks old, after all,” said Holman. “It has changed him, too....”\r\nHe drew out his watch. “I can catch that midnight train on the Alton.\r\nI’m going to get out of here now; I’m going home to old Jasper. There’s\r\na little woman there I want to see, a little woman and some children,\r\nand I’m going home--now, at last, to look them in the eyes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WILL BECOME OF ANNIE?\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring had come back to Leadam Street. The moist cobblestones had\r\nsteamed in the new sun all the afternoon; sparrows were sweeping up to\r\nthe eaves, trailing strings and long straws after them; from the back\r\nporches of the flats were loud, awaking, tinny sounds, breaking the\r\nlong silence. The clank of the cable-cars was borne over the roofs,\r\nclearly now in the damp, heavy atmosphere; from somewhere came the\r\njingle of a street piano. Floating down the mild afternoon, came the\r\ndeep, mellow note of some big propeller, loosing her winter moorings\r\nat last and rousing to greet the tug that would tow her out of the\r\nnarrow river. Kelley, the policeman, strolled along the sidewalk, with\r\nhis hands locked behind him, his nose in the air, sniffing eagerly and\r\npleasurably. He had left off his skirted overcoat, and changed his\r\nclumsy cap for his helmet.\r\n\r\nAnnie had sat at her window all the afternoon, but, as the spring day\r\nwore toward its close, she began to realize that only the melancholy,\r\nand none of the promise of this first spring day had touched her. She\r\nhad thrown open the window, to test the quality of the air. Now and\r\nthen a warm breath came wandering in off the prairies, though when it\r\nmet the cold, persistent wind from the lake, it hesitated, and timidly\r\nturned back. But Annie would not let herself doubt that the spring had\r\ncome. She knew that in time the prairie wind would woo its way until it\r\nwould be playing with the waves of the lake itself, the little waves\r\nthat danced all day, blue and white, in the sunshine. And then the\r\nsummer would come, and on Sunday afternoons Jimmy would take her out to\r\nLincoln Park, and they would have their supper at Fisher’s Garden.\r\n\r\nLeadam Street was dull enough on week days; on Sundays it was wholly\r\nmournful.\r\n\r\nOnce Annie saw a woman, with a shawl over her head and a tin bucket\r\nin her hand, go into Englehardt’s place, down the street. The woman\r\nwent in furtively, and brushed hastily through the “Family Entrance,”\r\nthough why could not be told. She went there nearly every hour of\r\nevery day. Then Annie was left alone. She did not turn inward to the\r\nflat; that was too still and lonesome, and it was growing dark now, as\r\nthe shadows gathered. She heard the strenuous gongs of the cable-cars\r\nover in State Street, and she could imagine the crowds, gay from their\r\nSunday holiday, that filled them, clinging even to the running-boards.\r\nShe might have gone out and been with them, as every one else in the\r\nstreet seemed to have done, but she would not for worlds have been away\r\nfrom home when Jimmy came. She heard the jingle of the street piano,\r\ntoo; she wished it would come down that way. She would gladly have\r\nemptied her purse for the Dago.\r\n\r\nIt was not unusual for Annie to be left alone, and she had grown used\r\nto it--almost; as used as a woman can--even the wife of a politician.\r\nJimmy had told her that she must not worry at any of his absences; an\r\nalderman could never tell what might detain him. She had but a vague\r\nnotion of the things that might detain an alderman, though she had no\r\ndoubt of their importance. At times she thought she felt an intimate\r\nlittle charm in the importance that thus reflected itself upon her,\r\nbut, nevertheless, her heart was never quite easy until she heard\r\nJimmy’s step on the stair and his key in the latch, and then--joy came\r\nto the little flat, and stayed there, trembling and fearful, until he\r\nwent away again. She had grown to be so dependent on Jimmy. Ever since\r\nshe had been graduated from the convent his great, strong personality\r\nhad stood between her and the world, so that, as her girlhood had\r\nmerged into womanhood, she had hardly recognized the change, and she\r\nremained a girl still, alone but for him; he was her whole life.\r\nShe had doubted his entrance into politics at first, just as she\r\nhad doubted his going into the saloon business, though she scarcely\r\nunderstood either in their various significances. Father Daugherty had\r\ntold her she was a fortunate girl to have Jimmy for a husband, and that\r\nhad been enough. Her only objection was that politics seemed to keep\r\nJimmy away from home oftener than the old work in the packing-house\r\nused to; she had trembled at it at times, and at times had grown a\r\nlittle frightened. His success in politics had pleased her, of course,\r\nand made her proud, but it could not have made her prouder of him than\r\nshe had been. He was all-sufficient for her; no change could make any\r\ndifference.... Without Jimmy, what could she have done? He had never\r\nbeen gone so long before; here it was Sunday evening; he had left at\r\neleven o’clock Saturday morning; there was to be an extra session of\r\nthe council Saturday night, an unusual thing, and she had not been\r\nsurprised when she awoke to find that it was Sunday morning--and that\r\nJimmy had not come.\r\n\r\nThe morning wore away, and she had made all the arrangements for\r\nthe dinner she would have awaiting him. She had gone about lightly,\r\nhappily, all the day, singing to herself, the gladness of the new\r\nspring in her. But, one by one, all the tasks she could think of were\r\nperformed, even to drawing the water for his bath and laying out his\r\nclean linen. And then, when there was nothing else to do but wait, and\r\nnothing with which to beguile her waiting, she had taken her post at\r\nthe window to watch for his cab.\r\n\r\nThe day waned, the Sunday drew wearily toward its close, as if it\r\nsighed for Monday, and the resumption of active life. The street\r\ngrew stiller and stiller. She heard the voice of a newsboy, far out\r\nof his usual haunts, crying an extra. She could not distinguish the\r\nwords in which he bawled his tidings, and she thought nothing of it.\r\nOne of Jimmy’s few rules was that she was not to read the papers. But,\r\nwhen the heavy voice was gone, she found that it had had a strange,\r\ndepressing effect upon her; she longed for Jimmy to come; the day had\r\ndragged itself by so slowly, and something of its somberness had stolen\r\ninto her soul. She sighed, and leaned her chin on her arm; her back was\r\ngrowing tired, and beginning to ache. Then suddenly she heard horses’\r\nhoofs, and the roll of a carriage in the street. She rose and leaned\r\nfar out of the window to welcome him. The cab drew up; it stopped;\r\nthe door opened. But the man who got out was not Jimmy. It was Father\r\nDaugherty. She knew him the instant she saw the fuzzy old high hat\r\nthrust out of the cab, and caught the greenish sheen of the shabby\r\ncassock that stood away from the fringe of white hair on his neck in\r\nsuch an ill-fitting, ill-becoming fashion. The old man did not look up,\r\nbut tottered across the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nAnnie gasped, and scarce could move. In a moment more she heard the old\r\nsteps on the stairs, the steps that for forty years had gone on so many\r\nerrands for others, kind and merciful errands all of them, though for\r\nthe most part sad. He was soon beside her, and she looked up into the\r\ngentle face that was so full of the woes of humanity. He had driven at\r\nonce from the hospital in the cab they had sent to fetch him. Jimmy’s\r\nlast words had been:\r\n\r\n“What will become of Annie?”\r\n\r\nThe death of Alderman Jimmy Tiernan at any time would have been a\r\nshock. When death came to him by a pistol-ball it created what the\r\nnewspapers, in the columns they were so glad to fill that Monday\r\nmorning, defined as a profound sensation. This sensation was most\r\nprofound in two circles in the city, outwardly unconnected, though\r\nbound by ties which it was the constant and earnest effort of both to\r\nkeep secret and unknown.\r\n\r\nThe city council had had a special session on Saturday night, and had\r\npassed the new gas franchise. Alderman Tiernan had had charge of the\r\nfight. Malachi Nolan was away, and Baldwin had picked out Tiernan as\r\nthe most trustworthy and able of those of the gang who were left\r\nbehind. Jimmy had felt the compliment, and gloried in it. It was the\r\nbiggest thing that had fallen to him in his political life, and he\r\nwas determined that he would make all there was to be made out of the\r\nopportunity. Not in any base or sordid sense--that is, not wholly so;\r\nthat would come, of course, but he felt beyond this a joy in his work;\r\nthe satisfaction of mere success would be his chief reward, the glory\r\nand the professional pride he would feel. He relished the fight against\r\nthe newspapers, against “public opinion,” whatever that was; against\r\nthe element that called itself the “better” element.\r\n\r\nHe was fully determined that no step should be misplaced; he counted\r\nhis men over and over again; he checked them off mentally, and it all\r\nturned out as he had said. Every one was present, every one voted, and\r\nvoted “right,” when the roll was called; the new gas franchise was\r\ngranted; Jimmy had delivered the goods.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that such a glorious victory should be celebrated,\r\nand the gang, when it assembled in Jimmy’s place, immediately after\r\nthe session was over, could not restrain its impatience. The boys\r\nlonged to have the fruits of the day’s work; with their wages they\r\ncould celebrate with glad, care-free hearts. But Jimmy was of a Gaelic\r\ncunning. He would not jeopardize the victory at that stage by any\r\nindiscretion. He saw at a glance the mood the gang was in. He smiled,\r\nas he always smiled--and any one, to see his smile, must have loved\r\nhim--but he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The drink’s in you, boys,” he said, “and you can’t trust your tongues.\r\nYou’ll have to wait. Monday night you’ll be over. Then we’ll talk\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\nSubconsciously, they still were sober; in a strange dual mentality\r\nthey saw the safety there was in his decision; and, in the paralysis\r\nof will his magnetism worked in them, they loved him the more for it.\r\nThey remembered that it was just what Malachi would have done. And\r\nso, noisy and excited as they were, they applauded his sagacity. Then\r\nthey gave themselves over unreservedly to their appetites. It was a\r\nfamous night in the annals of the gang. Jimmy himself joined in the\r\nrevelry. And in the calm, silent Sunday morning, with the new sunlight\r\nof spring glaring in his swollen, aching eyes, he found himself, with\r\na companion, in a Clark Street chop house. Just as they were going to\r\norder breakfast, a young man came in, with a black look in his eyes. No\r\none saw it then, though they all remembered it afterward. Jimmy greeted\r\nhim as gaily as he greeted everybody, but the young man did not warm to\r\nJimmy’s greeting. There were words, the quick rush of anger to Jimmy’s\r\nface, a blow, and the pistol shot. At first the newspapers were glad\r\nto trace some sinister connection between the franchise fight and the\r\ntragedy. Afterward, they said it was only some private grudge. No one\r\ndreamed that Jimmy Tiernan had an enemy on earth.\r\n\r\nAt the hospital, Jimmy opened his eyes, and on his face, grown very\r\nwhite, there was a smile again, the last of his winning smiles. His\r\nfriends were with him, and they wept, unashamed. Then he rolled his\r\nhead on his pillow, and spoke of Annie. The calm Sister of Charity\r\npressed her rosary into his hand, and stooped to listen. They had just\r\ntime to send for Father Daugherty.\r\n\r\nDown in the ward, the sadness that had come to Leadam Street spread\r\nblackly. Many a man, and many a woman, and many a child, cried. The\r\npoor had lost a friend, and they would not soon forget him. In the\r\nlong days of the distant winter they would think of him over and over.\r\nEvery one in that ward was poor, though the reformers, condescending\r\nthat way whenever Jimmy was up for reëlection, somehow never grasped\r\nthe real significance of the fact. And it was a somber Monday around\r\nthe city hall. Jimmy had been a man with a genius for friendship. The\r\ngang mourned him in a sadness that had added to it the remorse of a\r\nrecent sobriety, but their grief, genuine as it was, had in it an\r\nevil bitterness their hearts would not have owned. They were restive\r\nand troubled. Whenever they got together in little groups, they read\r\nconsternation in one another’s faces, and now and then they cursed\r\nthe caution they had extolled on Saturday night. Besides these varied\r\neffects, Jimmy’s death, while it could not create a crisis in the\r\nmarket, nevertheless gave rise to nervous feelings in certain segments\r\nof financial circles. It was inevitable that financial and political\r\ncircles should overlap and intersect each other in this matter, and\r\nthere were conferences which seemed to reflect a sense of personal\r\nresentment at Jimmy for having been murdered so inopportunely. In the\r\nend, the financiers were peremptory with Baldwin. He must fix the thing\r\nsome way. And he assured them that he would give the appointment of the\r\nadministrator his immediate attention. Already, he said, he had a man\r\nin view who would be reasonable and practical. There were suggestions\r\nof strong-handed methods, but that was never George R. Baldwin’s way.\r\nHe went out with his air of affability unimpaired. Meanwhile, political\r\nand financial circles could only wait and hope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe excitement of the first few days following the tragedy kept Annie’s\r\nmind occupied; but, when the funeral was over, and she returned to\r\nher little flat, when the neighborly women had at last gone back to\r\ntheir homes and their interrupted duties, and the world to its work,\r\nAnnie was left to face life alone. She could not adjust herself to\r\nthe change, and fear and despair added their blackness to her grief.\r\nFather Daugherty knew how great a blow Jimmy’s death would be to her,\r\nand, though he gave what comfort he could, he left her grief to time.\r\nHe did not belong to the preaching orders. But, as he pondered in his\r\nwise old head, he shrewdly guessed that the careless Jimmy would hardly\r\nhave made provision against anything so far from his thoughts as death,\r\nand he perceived that if Annie were to be protected from a future with\r\nwhich she, alone and unaided, would hardly have the capacity to deal,\r\nsome one must act.\r\n\r\nLong ago might Father Daugherty have celebrated his silver jubilee as\r\npastor of St. Patrick’s, but he was not the man for celebrations. The\r\nparish was one big family to him, and he knew the joys and sorrows, the\r\nlittle hopes and pathetic ambitions of every one in it. The sorrows of\r\nhis children he bore in his own heart; they had wrought their complex\r\nand tragic tale in his face. The joys he left them to taste alone; but\r\nhe found too much sorrow to have time for joy. During all those years,\r\nhe had given himself unsparingly; if it was all he had to give, it was\r\nthe most precious thing he could have given--a daily sacrifice that\r\nexhausted a temperament keenly sensitive and sympathetic. So he had\r\ngrown old and white before his time. Many a man had he kept straight\r\nwhen times were hard and the right to work denied him; many a widow\r\nhad he saved from the wiles of the claim-agent. The corporations and\r\nthe lawyers hated him.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on Monday morning, the clerks of the probate court had scarcely\r\nhad time to yawn reluctantly before beginning a new week’s work, when\r\nFather Daugherty appeared to file Annie’s waiver of her own right to be\r\nappointed administratrix of the estate of James Tiernan, deceased, with\r\nan application for the appointment, instead, of Francis Daugherty as\r\nadministrator.\r\n\r\n“He must keep a set of blanks,” whispered one clerk to another.\r\n\r\nAs Father Daugherty went about his inventory, he saw that the result\r\nwould be what he had expected. Jimmy had left no estate, no insurance,\r\nnothing but the saloon. And that, with Jimmy dead, was nothing, for its\r\nvalue lay all in Jimmy’s personality and the importance of his position\r\nin politics. The fixtures would hardly pay for the burying of him. When\r\nthe debts the law prefers had been paid, Annie would have scarce a\r\npenny. The world might preserve a respectful and sympathetic attitude\r\nduring the few exciting days when it was paying its last conventional\r\ntributes to the dead man, but it kept itemized accounts meanwhile, and\r\nit could not long pretend to have forgotten material things. It would\r\npresent its bills, and they must be paid. Annie would have hardly a\r\ncent to meet them with. And Father Daugherty knew, even if Annie did\r\nnot know, what the world would do then.\r\n\r\nYet he smiled, though he shook his head, as he thought of the\r\nfree-handed, indiscriminating generosity that had been akin to the\r\nimprovidence of Jimmy’s nature. And now he had but one more duty to\r\nperform; the safe in Jimmy’s saloon had not been opened. No one, not\r\neven the bartender, knew the combination, and Father Daugherty had a\r\nlocksmith to drill the lock. The gang had attended Jimmy’s funeral\r\nin black neckties, and had mourned him sincerely, but, now that he\r\nwas buried, their attitude became the common worldly attitude, with\r\nperhaps a little more than the usual aggressiveness in it. They were\r\nin a quandary as to the bundle in the new gas franchise, and many\r\nconferences with Baldwin had nerved them to desperate expedients. So\r\nit was on Baldwin’s advice that they determined to be represented at\r\nthe opening of the safe. Two of the number were detailed to this duty,\r\nMcQuirk of the Ninth, and Bretzenger of the Twenty-fourth. When they\r\nmade their demand on Father Daugherty, explaining that they came in\r\ntheir capacity as Jimmy’s nearest friends, he assented with a readiness\r\nthat relieved them both, and delighted Bretzenger, though McQuirk,\r\nwho knew Father Daugherty better than his colleague did, was fearful\r\nand suspicious. Father Daugherty said that he had thought of having\r\nwitnesses, and they would serve as well as any. It was very kind of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe priest and the two aldermen waited in the saloon for two hours\r\nwhile the locksmith drilled away silently. The street door was closed;\r\nthe crape still hung from the handle that had never gone unlatched so\r\nlong at a time before, the curtains were drawn, and outside the crowds\r\nfor ever shuffled by on the sidewalk, all oblivious to the little drama\r\nof hopes and fears that was unfolding its cross-purposes within. The\r\nsaloon was dark, and an electric bulb glowed to shed light for the\r\nlocksmith. The two aldermen puffed their cigars in silence, save for\r\nan occasional whisper, one with another. Father Daugherty’s gaunt\r\nform leaned against the dusty bar, strangely out of keeping with such\r\na scene, though the saloons in his parish knew him, especially on\r\nSaturday nights, when he conducted little raids of his own, and turned\r\nhis prisoners over to their wives. Now his weary visage was relaxed in\r\npatient waiting. At last the locksmith dropped his tools, and said:\r\n\r\n“There!”\r\n\r\nThe thick steel doors swung out on their noiseless hinges. The two\r\naldermen sprang to the side of the safe. The priest drew near slowly,\r\nbut his little eyes were turned on the aldermen, and they fell back a\r\npace. Then the priest’s long figure sank to a kneeling posture, and\r\nhe peered into the safe. There was nothing in view. It was strangely\r\nempty, for a safe of its monstrous size and mystery, and the tenacity\r\nof its combination. He thrust in his hand and fumbled through all its\r\nhollow interior, and then he drew forth--a soiled linen collar! It was\r\nludicrous, and for once he laughed, a little laugh. There was not a\r\nledger, not a book.\r\n\r\n“He kept no accounts, your riverence,” said McQuirk.\r\n\r\n“It was just like him,” said Father Daugherty. But he kept on with his\r\nsearch. And, when he opened the little drawer of maplewood, he found\r\na parcel, done snugly up in thick brown paper. He tore it open, and\r\nthere swelled into his sight packages of bank-notes almost bursting in\r\ntheir yellow paper straps. The bills were new, and as freshly green\r\nas the spring itself; more tempting thus, some way, to the reluctant\r\nconscience. The two aldermen bent over the black, stooping figure of\r\nthe priest, their eyes fixed on the money. There it was at last, the\r\nbundle itself, the price of, or a part of the price of the new gas\r\nfranchise. The priest straightened painfully, and got to his feet. He\r\nheld the bundle in his thin fingers, and glanced at his witnesses, with\r\na keen and curious eye. They met his gaze, expectant, eager, drawing\r\ndry, hot breaths. Involuntarily, they extended their hands. Father\r\nDaugherty looked at them, and a little twinkle of amusement showed in\r\nthe eyes that were wontedly so mild and sad.\r\n\r\n“Would you?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe two aldermen hastily raised their hands, and together, in strange\r\nunison, wiped their brows. The room had suddenly grown hot for them,\r\nand their brows were wet, though Father Daugherty was cool and\r\ncomposed, as he ever was. Yet they remembered; they could not so easily\r\ngive up; it was theirs by every right. They could have cursed Jimmy\r\njust then for his excessive caution. It was McQuirk’s quick mind that\r\nthought first.\r\n\r\n“Maybe there’s writing,” he said.\r\n\r\nFather Daugherty looked long and thoroughly, running his thin hand deep\r\ninto pigeon-holes and back into the partitions, until the sleeves of\r\nhis shabby coat were pushed far up his lean wrist.\r\n\r\n“Not a scrap,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Then, maybe--” But McQuirk drew Bretzenger away, and they went into\r\nthe darkness that lay thick as dust in the back of the long room.\r\nMeanwhile, Father Daugherty searched the safe through and through. He\r\nfound nothing more. The strong-box had had but one purpose, and it had\r\nserved it well. Then slowly, painfully, with the clumsy, unaccustomed\r\nfingers that had had small chance to count money, he turned the\r\npackages over, counting them carefully, wetting his trembling fingers\r\nnow and then. The man who had drilled the safe stood looking on, with\r\neyes that widened more and more.\r\n\r\n“How much is there, Father?” he said, at length. He extended a grimy\r\nforefinger hesitatingly, as if to touch the package the priest balanced\r\non his palm. But he did not touch it, any more than if it had been\r\nsomething sacred in that clean, sacerdotal hand.\r\n\r\n“Fifty thousand,” the priest answered. His voice was a trifle husky.\r\n\r\n“Fifty thousand!” the man exclaimed. And then he added, in awe:\r\n“Dollars! Doesn’t look like that much, does it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Father Daugherty answered. He had been a little surprised\r\nhimself. There was something disappointing in the size of the package.\r\nHe had never seen so much money before, and its tremendous power, its\r\ntremendous power for evil, as he suddenly thought, was concentrated in\r\na compass so small that the mind could but slowly wheel about to the\r\nnew conception. The locksmith spoke.\r\n\r\n“Might I--might I--hold it a second--in my own hand?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe priest gave the bundle into the hand hardened by so much honest\r\ntoil. The man held it, heaving it up and down incredulously, testing\r\nits weight. Then he gave it back.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” he said, and sighed.\r\n\r\nThe two aldermen had returned from their little conference.\r\n\r\n“Your riverence,” began McQuirk hesitatingly, “might we have a word\r\nwith you--in private?” He looked suspiciously at the workman. The\r\npriest went with them a little way apart.\r\n\r\n“We know about that,” McQuirk pointed to the bundle.\r\n\r\n“You do, do you?” said the priest sharply.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Father,” Bretzenger said. “It’s--it’s--well, it belongs to the\r\ncompany, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What company?”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know, the new ga--ah, that is, Mr. Baldwin, the lawyer. You\r\nknow him?”\r\n\r\n“George R.?” asked Father Daugherty.\r\n\r\n“Yes, your riverence,” said both men hopefully. “It should go back to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThe priest looked at them, and they caught again that amused expression\r\nin his face. It put them ill at ease, and it roused resentment in\r\nBretzenger, who felt that this calm priest could read him too well.\r\n\r\n“None of it belongs to you, then, I suppose?” observed Father\r\nDaugherty.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well--of course,” McQuirk urged, and his tone showed that he\r\nwas trying, in his crude way, to impress the priest with an honest\r\ndisinterestedness. “Of course, Jimmy was entitled to his piece.”\r\n\r\n“Sure!” Bretzenger said, swelling with the little virtue he had found\r\nto help him.\r\n\r\n“But you say it ought to go back to Baldwin, eh?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what we think, sir,” they chimed.\r\n\r\n“Well, he can come and identify it,” said Father Daugherty. He slowly\r\nwrapped the package up, and, unbuttoning his long, rusty coat a little\r\nway down from the throat, stuffed the money into an inner pocket. The\r\ndeed seemed to madden Bretzenger, and he moved a step forward. The two\r\nothers saw his motion. The priest did not move, but he turned a look on\r\nthem, and raised his hand, and McQuirk quailed, a superstitious fear\r\nin his eyes. He stiffened his arm before Bretzenger, and stayed him.\r\nAnd then the priest stepped quietly to the safe, and pushed its door to\r\nwith an arm that seemed too weak and frail to stir the heavy steel.\r\n\r\n“It looks to me, Michael,” he was saying gently, as if addressing\r\nMcQuirk alone, “like personal property, and, as I’m the administrator,\r\nI suppose I’ll have to take charge of it. If any beside our dead\r\nfriend own it, let them come forward and prove their claim, and\r\nidentify their property in open court.”\r\n\r\nFather Daugherty reported the whole affair to the probate court, and\r\nthe judge when the time for filing claims had elapsed, and he had\r\nwaited for the particular claim he knew would not be presented, ordered\r\na distribution of the property. Then Father Daugherty went to the flat\r\nto see Annie, bearing the bundle, the original bundle, the bundle that\r\nhad bought the new gas franchise. Something of the dramatic quality in\r\nthe situation had got into the old priest’s heart. He knew that Annie\r\nwould appreciate it all so much better if she could see the fortune,\r\nand feel it, and he would let her do so for an instant before he put\r\nit away in the safety deposit vaults to await opportunity for its\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nShe looked at it long and long, lying there in the lap of her black\r\ngown. She could not grasp the amount, though the old priest, leaning\r\nforward, with the enthusiasm of a boy shining once more, after so many\r\nyears, in his hollow eyes, said over and over:\r\n\r\n“Look at it, my child! Feel it! It’s fifty thousand dollars! And it’s\r\nall yours!”\r\n\r\nShe patted it, tenderly and affectionately, with a soft and reminiscent\r\ncaress, so that the priest knew that it was not for anything that\r\npackage of money might hold for her in a material way, then or\r\nafterward, but rather for what it gave back for a moment to her\r\ndesolated heart. And the priest was glad of that, and thereafter\r\nsilent. He had had doubts. He would feel better when the money had\r\npassed out of his hands, and he sometimes questioned whether it would\r\never do good in any one’s hands. But he had a sense of humor, too, a\r\ngrim sense in this instance, when he thought of certain political and\r\nfinancial circles, even if he did dust his thin hands carefully with\r\nhis spotless handkerchief when he laid the money down.\r\n\r\nAnnie’s eyes had filled with the ready tears that welled to their\r\nsweeping, black lashes, and trembled there as she raised her eyes to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Father,” she said, “he was so, _so_ good to me, always--and so\r\nkind! And see how thoughtful he was--to leave me all this! Oh, Jimmy,\r\nmy poor Jimmy!”\r\n\r\nAnd she rocked forward, like an old woman, and wept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VINDICATION OF HENDERSON OF GREENE\r\n\r\n\r\nBaldwin, the lobbyist, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees,\r\nand swaying with the train as it swung out on to the rocky ledge that\r\npaves the Valley of the Desplaines, contemplatively cut the end from a\r\nfresh cigar and said:\r\n\r\n“But I’m not so sure, after all. My experience with the Bailey bill\r\nshook my faith in that proposition.”\r\n\r\nThe two other men in the salon looked up with startled eyes.\r\n\r\nBaldwin had been driven over from his Michigan Avenue home and caught\r\nthe Alton Limited when it made the station stop at Twenty-third Street,\r\nwhere he boarded the last of its curtained Pullmans. This coach was\r\nthe political institution known to Illinois statesmanship as the\r\nSpringfield sleeper, and Baldwin and his two companions, Jennings,\r\nthe secretary of state, and Denny Healy, a canal commissioner, had\r\nthe capsulated coziness of its smoking compartment all to themselves.\r\nDown by Dwight they had fallen into a desultory discussion of the\r\nold question as to whether or not every man has his price. The\r\nquestion could hardly interest these men long, for, after many years’\r\nconstant contemplation, under the gray dome of the state house, of the\r\nweaknesses of men, they had come to an acceptance of the doctrine now\r\ngrown frank enough to have no lingering taint of cynicism. Jennings,\r\nindeed, had just dismissed the subject by declaring:\r\n\r\n“All men aire fer sale, an’ most of ’em damn cheap.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the subject might have lapsed had it not been for Baldwin’s\r\nheterodoxy. That George R. Baldwin of all men should doubt the first\r\nmaxim of their profession was beyond comprehension. Though he played\r\nhis part in life with a suite of law offices in a skyscraper as a\r\nbackground, his serious business was lobbying bills through the\r\nlegislature. His friends, who were many, boasted that he always stood\r\nby them, right or wrong. Which he did, indeed, and as they were\r\ngenerally wrong, the value of such friendship, or his opinions on\r\npractical politics, could hardly be overestimated. The day had been a\r\nhot one in Chicago, but now a cold draft of smoky air was sucking in\r\nthrough the narrow window-screen, on which the cinders hailed as the\r\nLimited plunged southward.\r\n\r\nSmoke and dirt had long since begrimed the dark and sweaty face of\r\nJennings, who, with waistcoat opened in the comfort dear to the\r\nEgyptian, was sprawling his shanks on the cushion opposite him, while\r\nHealy, doomed by corpulence to an attitude more erect, sitting with\r\nhis chubby knees far apart, as the fat will, his paunch resting on the\r\nedge of the seat he filled, now and then brushed a fat palm over his\r\nred scalp and sighed, as he puffed his domestic cigar. But Baldwin\r\nsat and smiled, showing his excellent teeth beneath his reddish\r\nmustache, and visibly expanded. They could hear, as an undertone to\r\ntheir talking, the dull roll of the Pullman’s paper wheels, and now\r\nand then they were interrupted by the whistle’s long and lonesome note\r\nat a country road-crossing. Out through the double windows, against\r\nwhich Healy sometimes pressed his forehead because the glass cooled\r\nit, the dark fields wheeled past in an endless belt of blackness, save\r\nwhere an occasional bunch of sparks from the engine burrowed under the\r\nright-of-way fence, and then, in the momentary glow of light, they\r\ncould catch sight of a tossing plume of corn, which told them they were\r\nout on the prairies of central Illinois.\r\n\r\nWhen the train paused for the Big Four crossing at Gardner, they heard\r\nin the sudden flood of silence the snoring of a sensible fare-paying\r\npassenger who had gone to bed. The strident noise of the crickets and\r\nthe frogs outside was noted only as an effect of the silence. The\r\nthree men had no thought of retiring until they reached Pontiac at two\r\no’clock, for the lives they led were such that they could not sleep\r\nuntil that hour, and then not very well.\r\n\r\nBaldwin had lighted his imported cigar, the superior aroma of which,\r\nperceptible even in an atmosphere choked with coal gases and the fumes\r\nof the domestic cigars Jennings and Healy were smoking, indicated\r\nfaintly the height of cultivation to which he had brought his\r\nappetites, when Jennings, flecking his ashes on the floor of the salon\r\njust as he would have done on his own parlor carpet, said:\r\n\r\n“Well, go on with the story.”\r\n\r\nBaldwin settled his chin over the blue cravat with the white polka dots\r\nthat was knotted over the immaculate collar--a collar, incredulous men\r\nfrom southern Illinois were sometimes told, that was actually made on\r\nthe shirt--drew his creased trousers a little farther above the tops of\r\nhis patent leather boots, and began:\r\n\r\n“One session there was an old man named Henderson in the house, who\r\nhad come up from Greene County; Henderson of Greene, everybody called\r\nhim, to distinguish him from Tom Henderson, of Effingham. He was a\r\nqueer figure, was Henderson of Greene, tall and gaunt, with a stoop\r\nin his shoulders. He always wore a hickory shirt, opened at a red and\r\nwrinkled throat, and his hair was just a stubble bleached by harvest\r\nsuns. The old man was a riddle to everybody in Springfield that winter.\r\nHe was always in his seat, even on Monday evenings, when no one else\r\nwas there. He voted always with his party, and he voted consistently as\r\nwell, like a good country member, against all the Chicago legislation.\r\nBut he was a silent man, who stood apart from his fellows, looking\r\nwith eyes that peered from under his shaggy, sunburned brows with\r\nan expression no one could fathom. He never made a speech, he\r\nnever introduced a bill, he never offered a resolution, he never\r\neven presented a petition, and when the speaker made his committee\r\nassignments, he placed the old man on the committees on History,\r\nGeology and Science, and on Civil Service Reform, and he did not even\r\nlook disappointed.”\r\n\r\nThe two politicians chuckled.\r\n\r\n“As for me,” continued Baldwin, “I never spoke to him, and never knew\r\nany one who did. The speaker himself only addressed him--and then as\r\nthe gentleman from Greene--when they were verifying roll-calls. No one\r\never knew where he boarded. The herd book gave him a paragraph, saying\r\nthat he had been born in Indiana along in ’37, and moved to this state\r\nsometime in the fifties. Left an orphan early, with no education, he\r\nhad been a day laborer all his life, working at anything he could get,\r\nmostly on farms. He never had held office before, and none knew how he\r\nbroke into the legislature--the tidal wave, I suppose. Every one knew\r\nhe never would come back again.\r\n\r\n“Well, we got down to the last night of the session. The hands of\r\nthe clock had been turned back in that vain old attempt to stay the\r\nremorseless hours, but its pale and impassive face was impotent as a\r\ngravestone to stay dissolution and oblivion. I know men who would have\r\nspent a fortune to give that legislature one day more of life, but it\r\nwas sweeping on to its midnight death. Somehow, whenever I think of\r\nthe legislature, I think of _that_ legislature, and whenever my mind\r\nconceives the state house it isn’t pictured to me as standing there on\r\nthe hill, stately in the sunshine, but as it appeared that night as I\r\nwalked over from the Leland, with the clouds flying low over its dome.\r\nThe lower floors were dark and still as sepulchres, and the messenger\r\nboys who came over from the Western Union, now and then, reminded me of\r\nghosts as they went by, their heels dragging on the marble floors of\r\nthe corridor. A light was burning in the governor’s office, though the\r\nold man himself, I knew, was over at the mansion, pacing the floor of\r\nthe library and cursing with classic curses. We were going to try that\r\nnight to pass the Bailey bill over his veto.\r\n\r\n“But the third floor blazed with electric lights, and the big dome\r\nwas full of noisy echoes. The senate kept its coat on--you know how\r\nthey mimic decorum over there--but the house was in its shirt-sleeves,\r\nhuddled like a pack of wolves around the speaker’s dais, with faces\r\nripe with whisky, shaking its fists under the umbrella of cigar smoke.\r\nEvery fellow was trying to get his bill passed in the last hour of the\r\nsession--you know what it is, Hank?”\r\n\r\n“Oah, yes,” replied Jennings, “but ’tain’t nothin’ to what ’t used to\r\nbe under the ol’ constitution. We’d stack a pile o’ them ’ere private\r\nacts up on the clerk’s desk, an’ pass ’em all t’ oncet ’ith a whoop.\r\nThem ’as the days--but that ’as ’fore your time.”\r\n\r\n“Those must have been good old days,” assented the lobbyist, “for the\r\ngang.”\r\n\r\n“I reckon! A feller could ’a’ done business in them days! Ol’ John M.’d\r\nbetter left the ol’ constitution alone--it ’as good enough. But there\r\n’as a passion fer change right after the war.”\r\n\r\nThe lobbyist politely nodded concurrence in this view and continued:\r\n\r\n“Some of the members clambered on to their desks, filling the air with\r\noaths, ink bottles, and hurtling books with rattling leaves. Sometimes\r\nan iron weight sheathed in paper whizzed by on a vindictive mission,\r\nand one man made an Egyptian nigger-killer with rubber bands. Some even\r\nhurled their copies of the revised statutes--it was the first use they\r\nhad ever found for them. Once in a while some one would toss a batch\r\nof printed bills to the ceiling, where they set the glass prisms of\r\nthe chandeliers jingling, and then fell like autumn leaves, a shower\r\nof dead pledges and withered hopes. And out of all the hubbub rose a\r\nsteady roar--”\r\n\r\n“Like at a lynchin’ bee,” assisted Jennings.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” assented Baldwin, who had never seen a lynching. “There were\r\ndrunken howls and vacuous laughs, and yet we could hear through it all\r\nthe hoarse voice of the clerk, his throat so heated that you could see\r\nthe vapor of his breath, as you can an orator’s, or a wood-chopper’s\r\nin winter, rapidly intoning senate bills on third reading. The pages\r\nwere growing heedless and impertinent. The newspaper correspondents,\r\ntheir despatches on the wires, puffed their cigarettes in professional\r\nunconcern, and awaited happenings worthy of late bulletins. The older\r\nmembers, who had been through the mill many times before, lounged low\r\nin their seats. One could see, above their desks, only their heads and\r\nheels. The speaker, old ’Zeke himself, was in the chair, suave as ever,\r\nbut growing caustic. He had splintered his sounding-board early in the\r\nevening, and had taken to tapping perfunctorily his walnut desk with\r\nhis little inadequate gavel. And yet he and the older members and the\r\nnewspaper men would cast occasionally an anxious glance at the clock,\r\nand an expectant one at the big doors.\r\n\r\n“As I sat there on the old, red lounge under the speaker’s flag-draped\r\ncanopy, I noticed Henderson of Greene, standing away back under the\r\ngalleries on the Democratic side, eying the proceedings with the same\r\nmysterious stare that had never left him since he had been sworn in.\r\nAs I have said, I had never spoken to the fellow, but I had always\r\nfelt a pity for him--he impressed me as a man who had been stunned by\r\nrepeated raps of bad luck. Along toward the end of the session he had\r\nbrought his wife up from Greene County to the capital. She had that\r\ntired look that country women have. Her face was seamed, her cheeks\r\nhollow; her back was bent in a bow, and she walked hurriedly, anxiously\r\nalong in her flapping skirts beside her tall and somber husband. She\r\nhad never been away from home before, and the boys had many a laugh\r\nover her wonder at the trolley-cars purring along under the maple\r\ntrees, and her fear of the elevators in the state house--though, for\r\nmy part, I could see nothing ludicrous in it all. She stayed three or\r\nfour days and they went everywhere, out to Oak Ridge to see Lincoln’s\r\ntomb, over to Eighth Street to visit his old homestead, up to the\r\nGeological Museum where the moth-eaten stuffed animals are, and out to\r\nCamp Lincoln. They took many trolley rides, and even climbed to the\r\ntop of the state house dome, whence, they say, you can see Rochester\r\nand the prairies for thirty miles around. He brought her over to the\r\nhouse one or two mornings, but not on to the floor as other members did\r\ntheir over-dressed wives; he sent her up to the gallery, where she sat\r\npeering down over the railing at the gang--and her husband, who took no\r\npart in all that was going on.\r\n\r\n“The old woman’s interest in all these new things that had come into\r\nher starved life, her ill-concealed pride in her husband’s membership\r\nin such a distinguished body of law-givers, were touching to me, and as\r\nI looked at him that last night of the session, and thought of her,\r\nthe wish to do something to lighten their lives came into my heart,\r\nbut just then, suddenly, old ’Zeke started from his chair, grasped his\r\ngavel firmly, and leaned expectantly over his desk. At the same instant\r\nthe older members dragged their feet down from their desks and sat bolt\r\nupright. The newspaper men flung away their cigarettes and adjusted\r\ntheir eye-glasses. The assistant clerk, who had been reading, looked\r\nup from the bill then under what I suppose they would have called\r\nconsideration, and hurriedly gave his place at the reading-desk to the\r\nclerk of the house. I knew what was coming. I knew that the Bailey bill\r\nwas on its way over from the senate. And I heard Bill Hill call:\r\n\r\n“‘Mistah Speakah.’\r\n\r\n“At the sound of that voice the uproar in the chamber ceased. It became\r\nso still that the silence tingled like a numbness through the body;\r\nstiller than it had been any time since nine o’clock that morning, when\r\nthey had paused for the chaplain to say his prayer. The gang turned\r\naround and stood motionless, panting, in its shirt-sleeves, as though a\r\nflashlight photograph were to be taken. Half-way down the aisle stood\r\nHill. You know how he would look at such a time, in his long black\r\ncoat, his wide white shirt bosom with the big diamond, his rolling\r\ncollar and black string tie, and his long black hair falling to his\r\nshoulders. You know how he would love such a moment--and it was his\r\nlast chance that session. He stood there quietly a whole minute, and\r\nthen putting a foot forward, said in his great bass voice:\r\n\r\n“‘Mistah Speakah.’\r\n\r\n“Old ’Zeke rose and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Mister Doorkeeper.’\r\n\r\n“‘A message from the senate, by its secretary.’\r\n\r\n“‘A message from the senate by its secretary,’ repeated ’Zeke, and then\r\nBill had to give way to Sam Pollard, who stepped forth and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Speaker, I am directed to inform the house that the senate\r\nhas passed senate bill No. 106’--I never shall forget the number\r\nof that bill, after all the sleepless nights it caused me, and the\r\nanxious mornings scanning the calendar to see if its black figures\r\nwere there--‘Senate bill No. 106. A bill for an act to amend an act\r\nentitled: An Act concerning the exercise of the right of eminent\r\ndomain, notwithstanding the objections of the governor’--you know the\r\nlingo.\r\n\r\n“Then, as the speaker said, ‘The clerk will read the message,’ Hen\r\nHarvey, who was clerk of the house, stretched his arm over the narrow\r\ndesk and took the file from the page. The old man was mad when he wrote\r\nthat veto message, and he gave both houses the devil. I never knew\r\nthe legislature to get such an unmerciful lamming in my life; it was\r\noutrageous, for it was a good bill, and--”\r\n\r\n“Ought ter pass,” interjected Jennings, repeating the trite phrase\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\n“But nobody heard it, for when Hen began to read, the gang took a deep\r\nbreath and began to howl. From both sides of the chamber broke forth\r\na clamor of ‘Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker,’ until in the din even these\r\nwords were lost, and there was just that long, heavy roar. The boys\r\ncame over from the senate, for they had done their duty and had done\r\nit nobly, in the face of a great storm of criticism, combined with\r\nthe abuse of the Chicago papers, and they wanted to help lift in the\r\nhouse. And with them came the crowd of reformers from the Municipal\r\nLeague, and stood about with George Herrick, the old man’s private\r\nsecretary. The reformers, as George pointed out members here and there,\r\nand whispered in their ears, supposed that they were doing great things\r\nin the fight against the bill, but that was only another time when they\r\ndeluded their precious selves. They did their reforming chiefly at\r\nbanquets, but George and the old man knew a thing or two about politics\r\nthemselves, and George, standing back by the Democratic cloak-room,\r\nsmoking his little cigarettes, was directing that fight with the party\r\nlash in his hand, and some of the best men on the floor of the house to\r\ndo his bidding. He was the only private secretary I ever knew who could\r\nset an army in the field.\r\n\r\n“But through it all old ’Zeke stood there, game as ever, with a hard,\r\ncold smile on his face, and you could hear the sharp, monotonous rap\r\nof his gavel, rap, rap, rap, neither fast nor slow. The tumult did not\r\ndie during the reading of that scathing message, and when Hen’s ruined\r\nvoice ceased, and he rolled the message up again and thrust it in his\r\ndesk, ’Zeke smashed his gavel down and I heard him say:\r\n\r\n“‘Will the house be in order?’\r\n\r\n“And it was in order, for ’Zeke knew how to compel order in that\r\nbear-pit when he wanted to, and he never raised his voice to do it\r\neither, only his eye, and the gavel. And so, when they were quiet, he\r\nsaid: ‘The question is: Shall the house concur with the senate in the\r\npassage of senate bill No. 106, notwithstanding the objections of the\r\ngovernor?’\r\n\r\n“The house tried to break away from him again, but he held it in his\r\ngavel fist, drawing the curb tight, and turned to recognize old Long\r\nJohn Riley, who was standing like a tall tree beside his desk, with his\r\nhand upraised.\r\n\r\n“‘The gentleman from Cook!’\r\n\r\n“‘Mr. Speaker,’ said Riley, ‘I move the previous question.’\r\n\r\n“There was another roar, but ’Zeke’s gavel fell, and his eyes blazed\r\nblack again, and he said:\r\n\r\n“‘The gentleman from Cook moves the previous question, and the question\r\nis: Shall the main question be now put? Those in favor of this question\r\nwill say aye’--there was a roar of ayes--‘and those opposed will say\r\nno.’ There was a heavier roar of noes, and then came the old cry: ‘Ayes\r\nand noes, ayes and noes, Mr. Speaker, ayes and noes, damn you, don’t\r\nyou dare to shut off debate!’ But ’Zeke only smiled and his gavel\r\ncracked--and they were still. Then in the stillness he said:\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen are as familiar with the rules as is the chair. They are\r\nwell aware that the chair is powerless to order a roll-call after a\r\n_viva voce_ vote, unless he is in doubt as to the result, the demand\r\nfor the yeas and nays not having been preferred before the question\r\nhad been put to the house. In this instance’--and the splendid old\r\nfellow swung his gavel to his ear, and the smile flickered out of\r\nhis face--‘in this instance the chair is not in doubt. The ayes seem\r\nto have it, the ayes have it, and the main question is ordered.’\r\nThe hammer fell like a bolt, and then calmly leaning on it, his eye\r\ntraveled around over the turbulent mob, until it lit on George Herrick\r\nand his little band of dazed reformers--and I knew he was thinking\r\nof the old man over in the mansion whom he hated with an Indian’s\r\nhate--and as he looked George in the eye, the cold smile came back, and\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“‘The question is: Shall the house concur with the senate in the\r\npassage of senate bill No. 106, notwithstanding the objections of the\r\ngovernor. Upon this question those in favor of the bill will vote aye,\r\nand those opposed will vote no, when their names are called, and the\r\nclerk will call the roll.’ The gavel fell, and the speaker, holding it\r\nwhere it had fallen, leaned half his length over his desk and motioned\r\nto Hen Harvey. Hen had taken off his coat and vest and collar--he would\r\ncall _that_ roll himself--and as he unbuttoned his cuffs, inclining his\r\nhead toward the speaker, ’Zeke yelled in his ear:\r\n\r\n“‘Now, Hen, damn it, call that roll to beat all hell.’\r\n\r\n“Then we knew that the Bailey bill fight was on to a finish. We had\r\nhad our first big battle with the reformers, and were down together\r\nin the last ditch. Whenever a bill with something in it is about to\r\npass the legislature, a strange quality steals into the atmosphere,\r\njust as there does in the council chamber in Chicago when anything\r\nis to be pulled off--don’t you know? There is a forebodement, an\r\napprehensiveness, that electrifies the nerves and oppresses the lungs.\r\nI felt it there that night. We had had a heavy fight to pass the bill\r\nin the first place, and now we had to override a veto! It’s hard\r\nenough to get the seventy-seven votes that constitute a majority, with\r\nthe people against you--men are such cowards--but when it comes to\r\nrounding up two-thirds--a hundred and two--it’s an entirely different\r\nproblem. We had been working quietly at the thing for days, for we knew\r\nthe veto was coming, and that the old man would wait until the last\r\nnight to send it in. We had a hundred and one tried and true men who\r\nwould stick to the end. The hundred and second was Jim Berry. We had\r\nhis promise, and believed he would stay in line--though he was afraid\r\nof his constits--for he was poor and in debt.\r\n\r\n“Judge Hardin came and sat beside me that we might check them off for\r\nourselves, and Hen began calling the roll:\r\n\r\n“‘Allen!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Ambaugh!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Anderson!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Bartly!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“The leaders, Jamison over on the Republican side, and Riley on\r\nthe Democratic, sat at their desks, with roll-calls, at which\r\nthey thoughtfully blew the smoke of their cigars as they checked\r\noff the progress of the vote. They appeared as unconcerned as the\r\ncorrespondents. I never can forget the drollery of the wink Jamison\r\ngave me as he voted no--it was necessary to have some one who had\r\nvoted with the majority to move a reconsideration of the vote in case\r\nanything happened. ’Zeke did not resume his seat during the roll-call,\r\nas the rules permitted him to do, but stood bending over his desk with\r\nan alert eye on the cadets. The vote up to this point was propitious,\r\nbut ’Zeke knew, and Jamison and Riley knew, and Judge Hardin and I\r\nknew, and we were not so sanguine as the correspondents, who had\r\nalready begun to toss sheets of copy to the frowsy telegraph boys,\r\nrunning to and fro between the press gallery and the Western Union.\r\nWe were chiefly interested just then whether Berry would vote right\r\nor not. I was keeping an eye on him and noticed that he was beginning\r\nto fidget in his seat, and chew his cigar, and tear paper into little\r\npieces. And the roll-call went on:\r\n\r\n“‘Beel!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Bell!’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’\r\n\r\n“Bell, of course, was on the other side, and was standing back with\r\nGeorge Herrick, keeping their fellows in line and cheering up the\r\nreformers from the Municipal League, but we knew his vote would have\r\nits effect on Berry, so I pulled the speaker’s coat-tail, and ’Zeke\r\nleaned over and whispered hoarsely to the clerk. Hen observed a\r\nlengthened pause and then began to call more slowly. Berry was the next\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“‘Berry!’ Hen drawled.\r\n\r\n“There was no reply.\r\n\r\n“‘Berry!’\r\n\r\n“There was no reply.\r\n\r\n“Hen looked long at Berry, and the poltroon sat there with his eyes\r\ncast down, rolling his cigar around and around in his mouth, tearing\r\nup his little flakes of paper, and swinging from side to side in his\r\nchair. Then Hen called the next name:\r\n\r\n“‘Briggs!’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’ he voted, and Berry looked up for the first time since the bill\r\nhad come over from the senate. ’Zeke rapped fiercely with his gavel,\r\nand Hen paused. Then ’Zeke said sharply:\r\n\r\n“‘The chair is compelled again to call the attention of gentlemen to\r\nrule three, which prohibits smoking in the hall of the house. The chair\r\ndislikes to be compelled to repeat this admonition so frequently, and\r\ntrusts that gentlemen will observe the injunction without additional\r\nsuggestion. The clerk will proceed with the calling of the roll.’ And\r\nhe smashed the broken sounding-board again with his gavel. We needed\r\ntime. Some of the members laughed, but that only gave ’Zeke a chance\r\nto gain more time by rapping for order. We feared the effect, however,\r\non discipline. Then he called Brisbane, one of our fellows, and he\r\ndidn’t vote. I grew uneasy, and Judge Hardin was squirming there beside\r\nme on the lounge. When I thought of Berry I grew mad, and wondered if\r\nwe could save the bill without him. At that instant my eye happened\r\nto light upon Henderson of Greene. He was standing under the gallery\r\njust as he had been standing all evening. He seemed not to have moved.\r\nHe had his hands clasped awkwardly behind him, and was chewing his\r\ntobacco contemplatively. And here was my chance! I thought of the\r\npathetic biography in the house directory. I thought of his wife as\r\nI had seen the poor old thing going around town with him the week\r\nbefore. I thought of the way he had worked and toiled for her and all\r\nthose children, and how little life held for him. If I could get him\r\nfor the bill in Berry’s place, the Chicago people, I knew, would be\r\nliberal with him, and he could go back home better off in a financial\r\nway than when he came. And so I motioned to Burke, and when he came up\r\nI told him to ask the gentleman from Greene to meet me at once in the\r\nspeaker’s room, and I retired to await him. Presently, in his clumsy\r\nway, he shuffled in. He came close up to me, and when I had given the\r\npoor devil a cigar he bent over to hear what I might have to say. I\r\nasked him how he was going to vote on the bill, and he said he thought\r\nhe would vote against it, inasmuch as the governor had said it was a\r\nbad piece of legislation. Well, there was no time to discuss that phase\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\n“‘Look here, comrade,’ I said, ‘this is a bill that concerns Chicago\r\nalone--it does not affect and can not affect you or your constituents\r\none way or the other, can it?’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ he said; ‘reckon not.’\r\n\r\n“‘They don’t even know down in Greene County that there is such a bill,\r\ndo they?’\r\n\r\n“‘Reckon not,’ he said, ‘leastways I hain’t heerd ary one say nothin’\r\n’bout it.’\r\n\r\n“‘Of course you haven’t,’ I said, ‘and what’s more, you never will.\r\nNow, see here,’ I said, ‘I’ll be quite frank with you, for I like\r\nyou’--he cast a strange, sidling glance at me, distrustful, like all\r\nfarmers--‘for I like you,’ I said, ‘and I want to do something for you.\r\nThe men who are promoting this legislation have exactly enough votes\r\nto pass it over the governor’s veto, and it’s going to pass. On this\r\nballot they will have just ninety-one votes--one of their men will\r\nvote against it to move a reconsideration if necessary, and about ten\r\nwill not vote. When the absentees are called, these ten will vote for\r\nthe bill, and on the verification, you’ll see others tumbling into the\r\nband-wagon. Now, your vote is not needed, as you see, and, cast for the\r\nbill or against it, can have no appreciable effect upon the result. The\r\nbill will pass without your vote, and you can not defeat it, for the\r\nhundred and two will stand firm in the end. One of them, however--it\r\nis Berry, I don’t mind telling you--is trying, at the last minute, to\r\nforce us into raising his price. You can take his place, you can have\r\nhis price of the easy money with his raise added, if you will go out\r\nthere and vote for the bill.’\r\n\r\n“He stood looking at the floor, ruminating.\r\n\r\n“‘I know, Henderson,’ I continued, ‘that you are a poor man, that you\r\nhave a large family, that you have to work hard for a living. You are\r\ngoing home to-morrow, maybe not to come back here any more, and you can\r\ngo if you wish, with three thousand dollars clean, cold cash in your\r\npocket. What do you say?’\r\n\r\n“The old man turned his face away and began to fumble with his horny\r\nfingers at his chin. His hand trembled as with a palsy. We could hear\r\nthe roll-call going on outside:\r\n\r\n“‘Donavin!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Donnelly!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Evans!’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’\r\n\r\n“‘Finerty!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Fitzmeyer!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Flanigan!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Hear them?’ I said. ‘It’s nearly up to you--what do you say?’\r\n\r\n“The old man’s lips quivered, and his calloused fingers grated in his\r\nbeard. He opened his lips to speak, but his jaw moved helplessly. And\r\nwe heard Hen’s voice back there in the house calling--calling so that\r\nyou could have heard him over in the Leland bar-room:\r\n\r\n“‘Geisbach!’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’\r\n\r\n“‘He is one of those who will change,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘Giger!’\r\n\r\n“There was no response. ‘He’ll be all right when they call the\r\nabsentees,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘Gordon!’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’\r\n\r\n“‘Griesheimer!’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“‘Hear them?’ I asked. The H’s came next, and the old man, still\r\nfumbling with his chin, and without turning his head began to talk:\r\n\r\n“‘Baldwin,’ he said, ‘you’re right. I am a poor man. I have a wife an’\r\neight children. To-morrow I’m goin’ back home, an’ o’ Monday I’m goin’\r\nto hunt a job--hunt a job in the harves’ field. I’ve worked hard all my\r\nlife. I ’spect to work hard all my life. I’ll keep on huntin’ jobs in\r\nthe harves’ fields. I’ll probably die in the poor-house. I’ll be buried\r\nin the potter’s field. God knows what’ll become of that woman and them\r\nchildren.’\r\n\r\n“He nodded his head as in assent to an indisputable proposition, and\r\nhis eyes widened as if in fright. They were looking down the barren\r\nyears before him, and I felt in that moment glad of my power to\r\nbrighten them.\r\n\r\n“‘Hallen!’ we heard Hen call.\r\n\r\n“‘No!’\r\n\r\n“‘Henderson of Effingham.’\r\n\r\n“‘Aye!’\r\n\r\n“The old man straightened out his long, lank figure, and then suddenly\r\nhe turned and looked me in the eyes.\r\n\r\n“‘But, Baldwin,’ he said, ‘I come here last January an honest man,\r\nand to-morrow I’m goin’ back, back to ol’ Greene, back to my people,\r\nback to that woman an’ them children, an’ Baldwin’--he gulped the\r\nword--‘Baldwin, I’m goin’ back an honest man.’\r\n\r\n“‘Henderson of Greene!’ Hen’s voice called, and the old man stalked\r\ninto the corridor and thundered ‘No!’ in a trumpet note.”\r\n\r\nThe lobbyist ceased. The train had stopped at Chenoa, and they could\r\nhear the breathing of the engine, breathing as a living thing when it\r\nrests. The noise ceased presently, and the silence of the wide country\r\nnight ensued. They heard only the notes that came from the throats of\r\nfrogs, and the stridulent drumming of the cicadæ. Baldwin looked at\r\nthe two politicians, expecting some comment. The oscitant Healy looked\r\nout of the window, into the vast darkness brooding over the prairie\r\ntown. Jennings sat meditatively pulling at his moist mustache, an\r\nexpression of perplexity in his countenance, the wrinkles of increasing\r\nconcentration of mind gathering in his brow. Presently, without a word,\r\nhe rose and left the compartment. When he returned he was treading in\r\nhis stockings, his coat and waistcoat and collar had been removed, his\r\nsuspenders were hanging at his hips. He was evidently preparing for his\r\nberth. Baldwin meanwhile had pressed a button, and sent Gentry, the\r\naged porter, now in white jacket, for his bag, and laid out on the seat\r\nbeside him his pajamas, and a traveler’s case filled with silver toilet\r\narticles. Jennings lifted his own big valise to his knees, and from\r\nits depths drew a bottle, wrapped heavily in a newspaper. He held one\r\nof the heavy little glasses under the faucet of the water-cooler, and\r\nallowed the water to trickle into it. Then, peeling back the paper from\r\nhis bottle, he took a long pull from its naked neck, and passed it to\r\nBaldwin. As he did so, his brows still knotted in perplexity, he asked:\r\n\r\n“What’d you say that feller’s name was?”\r\n\r\n“Henderson.”\r\n\r\n“Henderson of Greene, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nJennings threw back his head and tilted the water, deadly cold from the\r\nice and tasting of smoke, into his throat, and when he had rinsed his\r\nmouth, he said, with the happy expression of a man who has resolved a\r\ndoubt:\r\n\r\n“Oah, yes, John Henderson, of Greene. He lived out at Rabb’s Corners.\r\nYes, that’s him; the governor ’p’inted him public administrator of\r\nGreene County right after that session.”\r\n\r\nThe train lurched, and Jennings, bracing himself, wrapped up his bottle\r\nand stowed it carefully away in his valise. And swinging the valise in\r\none hand and with the other hitching up his trousers, now beginning to\r\ndrag at his heels, he stepped away in his stockinged feet to his berth.\r\n\r\nBaldwin began to wind his watch, and the Limited, with its three\r\nhundred tons, and its tossing heads full of the schemes of politics,\r\nwent careering away on its paper wheels toward the capital of Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATE BILL 578\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a page in the Illinois legislature--“House Page No. 7,” the\r\nbright metal badge on the lapel of his little coat said--and all day\r\nlong he heard nothing but “Here, boy!” from city members, or “Hey,\r\nbub!” from country members, or “Hi, there, kid!” from the other pages,\r\nor “Get a move on you, Seven!” as the chief page snapped his fingers\r\nat him in his lordly way. His real name was James, but he never heard\r\nthat, now that his father was dead. His mother called him Jamie.\r\n\r\nJamie was kept very busy and yet he enjoyed his legislative duties. He\r\nfelt that it was a big thing to help, even in his humble little way,\r\nto make laws for all the people in the state. It was pretty important,\r\nfor instance, to carry a paper from some member up to the clerk’s desk,\r\nfor after the clerk had read it, on three different days, and the house\r\nhad voted on it and passed it, and after it had been read on three\r\ndifferent days and passed by the senate, and after the governor had\r\nread it and thought over it as he walked back and forth between the\r\nexecutive mansion and the state house, and had written his name on it,\r\nit became a law, and everybody in the state had to obey it or go to\r\njail.\r\n\r\nThe people were called constituents, they seemed to be divided up among\r\nall the members of the legislature; everybody in the state house had\r\nhis constituents. Jamie felt that, as a legislator, he should have some\r\nconstituents, but he couldn’t decide who his constituents were, and he\r\ndidn’t like to ask anybody. But finally he thought of his mother, and\r\nwhen he told her that she was his constituent she took his little face\r\nbetween her two hands and kissed him and pressed her cheek to his. Her\r\ncheek was moist with tears.\r\n\r\nIf everybody in the state house had been as good to his constituents as\r\nJamie, Illinois would have been a very happy place in which to live.\r\nWhen his father died, Jamie’s mother had to take in sewing and to work\r\nhard to keep things going. She was sad much of the time, and always\r\nlooked tired, and this made Jamie sad. He longed to help her, but he\r\ndid not know what to do. Then a friend of theirs, Mr. Woodbridge, said\r\nhe could get Jamie a place in the house as a page boy--they always say\r\n“page boy” in the legislature--and one morning Jamie’s mother dressed\r\nhim in his Sunday suit and sent him up to the state house with Mr.\r\nWoodbridge.\r\n\r\nAnd so he became a page. He was paid a dollar and a half a day. Every\r\ntwenty days the payrolls were made out, and Jamie would go down to the\r\ntreasury, sign his name in a big, round hand, “James Horn,” and then\r\nproudly take home to his mother thirty dollars in fresh, crisp, green\r\nbills! His mother had wished him to stay in school, but, of course,\r\nbeing a page was better than going to school. There were no books to\r\nstudy, and then you got out so much earlier every day! And more than\r\nall, you couldn’t take home money from school!\r\n\r\nThe house met every morning at ten o’clock, and after the speaker had\r\ntaken his place under the canopy where the beautiful flag was draped,\r\nand had rapped for order, and the chaplain had prayed, the clerk would\r\ncall the roll for the introduction of bills. This was Jamie’s busiest\r\ntime. Everybody would have bills to introduce or petitions from his\r\nconstituents to present, and for an hour Jamie would be scampering up\r\nand down the aisles between the members’ desks and the clerk’s desk.\r\nBut after that he had a breathing spell, and could sit on the speaker’s\r\nsteps and whisper to the speaker’s page, or look about over the house\r\nand watch the members. There were grave members from the country\r\ndistricts with long whiskers and steel-bowed spectacles, there were\r\ncity members with fancy vests and diamonds, there were Irish members\r\nand German members, there was a Polish member named Kumaszynski, and\r\nthere was a negro member, who sat away back on the Republican side\r\nalmost under the galleries, and was very quiet, and wore black clothes\r\nand gold eye-glasses.\r\n\r\nBut there was one whom Jamie liked above all the others. He was tall,\r\nwith smiling blue eyes that saw everything, and though his black hair\r\nwas patched with gray at the temples, his face was that of a young\r\nman, clean-shaven and ruddy. He was a Chicago member and the most\r\nfashionably dressed man in the house--he wore a different suit of\r\nclothes every day. He was a lawyer and his name was Bronson Meredith.\r\nJamie loved him the first time he ever saw him, and whenever Mr.\r\nMeredith clapped his hands Jamie would spring to his side before any\r\nother page had started, and if by chance Mr. Meredith ever gave a\r\nresolution or a bill to any of the other boys Jamie felt a twinge of\r\njealousy at his heart.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would loiter an instant beside Mr. Meredith’s desk, and\r\na smile from him made Jamie happy all that day. Jamie longed to touch\r\nhim with his hand, but dared not. The only thing he could do was to\r\npat Mr. Meredith’s overcoat, with its soft, silken lining, as it hung\r\non its hook in the cloak-room. At night, lying in his bed, Jamie would\r\nclose his eyes and see Mr. Meredith standing beside his desk, his lips\r\nslightly parted in a smile, showing his white teeth and replying so\r\nsharply to members who interrupted him that they would shoot down into\r\ntheir seats with red faces and all the other members would laugh, while\r\nMr. Meredith, raising his hand, would go on with his speech, saying:\r\n\r\n“Now, Mr. Speaker, as I was about to remark when I yielded to the\r\nperplexing question of the distinguished gentleman from Pike--”\r\n\r\nMr. Meredith was not often on his feet, as they say in legislative\r\nbodies, but when he took part in a debate all the other members kept\r\nstill and listened with their hands behind their ears, which they\r\ndidn’t do when any one else spoke. Mr. Meredith was a leader--many\r\ncalled him a reformer. Jamie decided that when he grew up he would be a\r\nlawyer, a leader and a reformer.\r\n\r\nNow, when the session was about over there was a bill in the house\r\nwhich almost all the Chicago members hoped to see made into a law; but\r\nMr. Meredith was against it. The country members, too, for the most\r\npart, were against the bill, and Jamie noticed that when it first came\r\nover from the senate there was a stir in the house, and that every\r\ntime it came up, after that, all the members would rush in from the\r\ncloak-rooms, or the lobbies, or the supreme court library, or the\r\nrotunda of the state house, to speak about it and to vote on it.\r\n\r\nJamie did not understand the bill, or know what it was for; he only\r\nknew that it was something about a franchise in Chicago, and that every\r\nweek a party of rich-looking gentlemen would come down to Springfield\r\nand stand about in the house, or sit on the big red lounge behind the\r\nspeaker’s chair, and whisper and try to get men to vote for it.\r\n\r\nAnd Jamie knew, too, that it was called senate bill No. 578; he\r\nimpressed that number firmly on his mind and could never forget\r\nit. He soon observed that on any day when he saw S. B. 578 on the\r\ncalendar--which is a kind of program printed every morning to tell what\r\nbills are coming up--Mr. Meredith would be on his feet and make motions\r\nand speeches, and that the gentlemen on the speaker’s red lounge would\r\nscowl at him and the other city members try to answer him. And Jamie\r\nnoticed that Mr. Meredith always succeeded in having the bill referred\r\nback to some committee, or did something to keep it from becoming a law.\r\n\r\nJamie read the newspapers now and then. He always turned first to\r\nthe base-ball news--the season was just opening--and then to the\r\nlegislative news, although he never read that as carefully as he did\r\nthe base-ball news. Often he saw Mr. Meredith’s name in the types--the\r\npapers said he was making a gallant fight against the franchise grab.\r\nJamie hoped with all his soul that Mr. Meredith would win in that\r\nfight; not, of course, that he cared about the franchise grab--he had,\r\nlike many older persons, very hazy ideas about that--but he always\r\nwished to see Mr. Meredith win.\r\n\r\nThe spring had come, and as the legislature usually ends early in June,\r\nand the work was piling up, the house was meeting at nine o’clock in\r\nthe morning. The house adjourned every Friday at noon, in order that\r\nthe members might go home over Sunday, and it didn’t meet again until\r\nMonday afternoon at five o’clock, and then only for a few minutes. The\r\nmembers who had gone home did not get back until Tuesday morning, and\r\nthere were never many there Monday afternoon, not even a quorum, and it\r\nwas always understood that nothing was to be done at that session. The\r\nchaplain prayed, the journal of Friday’s session was read and approved,\r\nand the house adjourned until Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\nBut one Monday afternoon when Jamie reached the hall of the house\r\nhe was surprised to find a big body of members there--almost all\r\nthe Chicago members except Mr. Meredith. Those rich gentlemen were\r\nthere, too, sitting on the speaker’s red lounge. Jamie looked for\r\nMr. Meredith--he was not there. He thought instantly of senate bill\r\n578--something was up! They were going to try to pass senate bill\r\n578--that was why the gentlemen were there on the speaker’s red lounge;\r\nthat was why the Chicago members had come down to Springfield on the\r\nMonday afternoon train instead of waiting for the Monday night train.\r\nJamie was worried.\r\n\r\nIt was a balmy spring day with a sky blue and tender, and a soft wind\r\nthat wafted strange sweet country smells about, smells that filled\r\nJamie with dreamy longings and a kind of pleasant sadness. The speaker\r\ngently tapped with his gavel; the good old chaplain rose and spread out\r\nhis white hands.\r\n\r\n“O Lord,” he prayed, “we thank Thee that the winter is past, that the\r\nrain is over and gone, that the flowers appear upon the earth, that the\r\ntime of the singing of birds is come.”\r\n\r\nThe words stole sweetly in upon Jamie’s soul. He sat on the steps,\r\nlooking out of the open windows at the tender young leaves of the maple\r\ntrees--it was just the way he used to look out of the open windows in\r\nschool before vacation came, when he thought of the swimming-hole out\r\nat Sycamore and of going barefooted. It was all so calm and peaceful.\r\nBut with the chaplain’s “Amen!” the speaker’s gavel cracked and the\r\nbuzzing noise peculiar to the house began again. And Jamie awoke from\r\nhis reveries with a start. He had heavier things to think of now; he\r\nwas almost a man; he was in the legislature. Senate bill 578 was on its\r\nthird reading, the gang was present, and Mr. Meredith had not come.\r\nJamie was troubled, and sighed. He must attend to his duties--he must\r\ndo something.\r\n\r\nJamie looked over all the faces before him; nowhere could he find one\r\nman he could trust as a friend of Mr. Meredith.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the door with a lingering hope that Mr. Meredith would\r\nappear, but of course he did not come. Then Jamie slowly hitched down\r\nthe speaker’s stairs, a step at a time, and, reaching the floor,\r\nslipped over by the reporters’ boxes--empty that afternoon, for the\r\ncorrespondents, like the legislators, never returned until Tuesday\r\nmorning--and thence into the side aisle, under the gallery, and to the\r\ncloak-room. There he got his cap, looked longingly at Mr. Meredith’s\r\nhook, empty now, with no satin-lined overcoat for him to nestle\r\nlovingly against for a blissful second, and then he went out into the\r\nhall under the huge dome. No one, of course, observed a mere page\r\nboy, but Jamie felt, as he clicked his hurrying little heels across\r\nthe marble floors, that something was about to poke him in his cold,\r\nunprotected back--the fear of a rear attack that boyhood inherits from\r\nits far-distant savage ancestry. Jamie didn’t take the elevator, or the\r\ngrand staircase, but reached the main floor by leaping two steps at a\r\ntime down a narrow side stairway, unused and dark.\r\n\r\nThen he flew out of the east entrance, ran down the wide walk and on up\r\nCapitol Avenue for four long blocks--ran as fast as he could pump his\r\nlittle short legs to the hotel where he knew Mr. Meredith lived when\r\nhe was at the capital. But Jamie had no hope of finding him there that\r\nafternoon. He went to the hotel simply because he did not know where\r\nelse to go--that was all. Rushing into the hotel and up to the clerk’s\r\ndesk, he put his chin over its edge and, as the clerk leaned down with\r\nhis face almost in Jamie’s face, the boy panted:\r\n\r\n“Is--now--Honorable Bronson Meredith in?”\r\n\r\nThe clerk smiled and Jamie blushed, fearing the clerk was making fun of\r\nhim. And his heart sank--he might have known Mr. Meredith was not in.\r\n\r\n“Whom did you say?” asked the clerk.\r\n\r\n“Honorable Bronson Meredith--the gentleman from Cook--”\r\n\r\nThe clerk was knitting his brows, though the wrinkles about his lips\r\nwere twitching as if he found it hard to keep them from rippling out\r\ninto smiles. Jamie thought the clerk was wonderfully stupid not to know\r\nsuch a great man as Mr. Meredith, and he added, in order to jog the\r\nman’s memory a little:\r\n\r\n“You know--the reformer.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk straightened up, placed his hands on his hips, threw back his\r\nhead and laughed. Jamie stared at him with wide eyes--he saw nothing\r\nto laugh at, especially when senate bill 578 was coming up. Presently\r\nthe clerk took one of his hands from his side and dropped it on the big\r\nbell beside the register, and as it clanged out in the empty lobby, he\r\nshouted in his laughing voice:\r\n\r\n“Front!”\r\n\r\nA bell-boy in buttons slid to the desk just as a page boy does in the\r\nhouse when a member claps his hands. The bell-boy and Jamie looked each\r\nother all over from head to toe in the instant they stood there facing\r\neach other, and the clerk began:\r\n\r\n“Go see if Mr. Meredith--”\r\n\r\nAnd just then a tall form appeared around the corner of a wall, and\r\nJamie looked up.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Meredith himself, as smiling as the spring, with a bunch of\r\nviolets in the lapel of his new light coat. Jamie sprang at him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Meredith,” he exclaimed, raising his clasped hands almost\r\nappealingly, “come--quick! Come quick!”\r\n\r\n“Why, what’s the matter?” said Mr. Meredith, halting in surprise.\r\n\r\n“They’ve got senate bill 578 up!”\r\n\r\nMr. Meredith’s eyes opened; his face lost its mild expression.\r\n\r\n“What do you know about senate bill 578?”\r\n\r\nJamie took him by the coat--he dared at last to lay hands on his sacred\r\nperson--and tugged as he said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, honest--Mr. Meredith--honest--cross my heart they have--you’ll be\r\ntoo late!”\r\n\r\nMr. Meredith looked at the pleading lad closely, and then suddenly\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! You’re one of the page boys.” And then he ran as fast as he\r\ncould through the lobby, down the steps and across the sidewalk, Jamie\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” cried Mr. Meredith, as he stooped to plunge into a carriage\r\nat the curb, dragging Jamie in after him, and shouting to the driver:\r\n\r\n“The state house--fast as you can drive!”\r\n\r\nThe driver whirled his carriage about in Sixth Street, and as Mr.\r\nMeredith drew in his head and slammed the heavy door he shouted:\r\n\r\n“Faster there--I’ll double your fare!”\r\n\r\nThe carriage lurched around the corner, the lash of the driver’s whip\r\nwrithed in the air, and the horses went galloping with the rattling old\r\nhack down Capitol Avenue. And as the carriage pitched and rocked Jamie\r\nwas supremely happy--he had done what he could, and, better than all,\r\nhe was sitting beside Mr. Meredith and actually riding in the same hack\r\nwith him!\r\n\r\nMr. Meredith was silent until the carriage whirled into the state\r\nhouse grounds and the horses, breathing heavily, were plunging up the\r\ndriveway toward the north portico. Then he turned and said:\r\n\r\n“How’d they know I was in town?”\r\n\r\nJamie looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Who?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied Mr. Meredith, “whoever sent you.”\r\n\r\nJamie felt hurt.\r\n\r\n“But no one sent me, Mr. Meredith,” he said; “I just came.”\r\n\r\n“And how did you know I was here?”\r\n\r\n“I guessed.”\r\n\r\nMr. Meredith was thoughtful for an instant and then said:\r\n\r\n“But why did you come?”\r\n\r\nJamie blushed.\r\n\r\n“I--I--I--now--” he stammered. “I don’t like to tell.” And he hid his\r\nface against Mr. Meredith’s sleeve.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, the driver leaped from his box and flung open\r\nthe door. Mr. Meredith sprang out, leaped up the stone steps, ran down\r\nthe corridors, dashed into the elevator and was shot up to the third\r\nfloor. Jamie had been compelled to run faster than he ever did in his\r\nlife to keep up with him. He was nearly pinched by the iron door of the\r\nelevator as the man slid it shut.\r\n\r\nBut he was close at Mr. Meredith’s heels when he ran into the house.\r\nThe few senators, having just concluded a perfunctory Monday afternoon\r\nsession over in their more or less solemn chamber, were bustling into\r\nthe hall of the house, evidently expecting something of interest to\r\noccur. They pressed by the doorkeeper, and as they entered Jamie heard\r\nthe speaker cry:\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from Cook asks unanimous consent to have senate bill 578\r\ntaken up out of the regular order, read at large a third time, and put\r\nupon its passage. Are there any objections?”\r\n\r\nThe speaker raised his gavel, waited an instant, and said:\r\n\r\n“The chair hears--”\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a voice beside Jamie rang out like a bugle:\r\n\r\n“Object!”\r\n\r\nThe speaker looked up in amazement. The members of the gang turned\r\nabout in their seats with startled, guilty faces; the rich gentlemen on\r\nthe speaker’s red lounge leaned forward with pained expressions. Mr.\r\nMeredith was striding down the center aisle, his hat in his hand, his\r\nface red, his eyes on fire.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the aisle he halted, and once more shouted in that\r\nfearless note:\r\n\r\n“I object! A million people in Chicago to-night are waiting to hear\r\nfrom this house on this franchise bill--I dare you to take it up in\r\nthis star-chamber session!”\r\n\r\nMr. Meredith’s hand swept a wide arc that included the whole house as\r\nhe flung his defiance, and then he stood glaring at them all. The eyes\r\nthat met Mr. Meredith’s eyes quailed; the house was still. No one rose,\r\nno one replied to him.\r\n\r\nThen after a long minute of this painful silence the speaker, lowering\r\nhis head until Jamie could not see his face, said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n“Objections are heard.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the franchise grab bill was not taken up that day after all.\r\n\r\nThe session was very short after that, and when the house adjourned Mr.\r\nMeredith went down to the speaker’s dais. The speaker looked up as if\r\nhe thought Mr. Meredith was coming to speak to him, but Mr. Meredith\r\nstopped at the steps, and taking Jamie’s little hand he pressed it in\r\nhis own big palm and said:\r\n\r\n“Come with me.”\r\n\r\nIt was the proudest moment of Jamie’s life as he walked out of the\r\nnoisy chamber, through the crowd of angry, baffled members, past the\r\nstaring pages, by the wondering doorkeepers, and so on out into the\r\nrotunda. They walked down the great white staircase, and as they were\r\npassing around the polished brass railing of the balcony on the second\r\nfloor Mr. Meredith said, as if suddenly reminded of something:\r\n\r\n“Beg your pardon, but what’s your name?”\r\n\r\n“James Horn,” replied Jamie.\r\n\r\nThey kept on and Jamie wondered where they were going, until they\r\nturned into the governor’s offices. Jamie’s heart leaped suddenly.\r\nSurely this was a day of big surprises, thought he.\r\n\r\n“Is the governor in?” Mr. Meredith asked of the governor’s private\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n“Yes--just go right in, Mr. Meredith,” and in another instant Jamie\r\nwas standing beside Mr. Meredith in the presence of the governor.\r\n\r\nThe governor rose as they entered, and looked first at Mr. Meredith,\r\nthen lowered his kind blue eyes and fixed them on Jamie.\r\n\r\n“Governor,” said Mr. Meredith, “I wish to present my little friend,\r\nMaster James Horn.”\r\n\r\nThe governor bowed, took Jamie’s hand in his own and said in his soft\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“I’m very glad to meet you, Master Horn, I’m sure.”\r\n\r\nJamie felt himself tingle all through at the governor’s words.\r\n\r\n“Master Horn, Governor,” continued Mr. Meredith, “is a page boy in\r\nthe house, and to-day, when we were all caught napping, he saved the\r\nfranchise bill from becoming a law.”\r\n\r\nThe governor, looking a question at Mr. Meredith, said:\r\n\r\n“Ah?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mr. Meredith, and then, when the governor had motioned\r\nthem to take seats, and Jamie had worked and wiggled himself away back\r\ninto a deep leather chair, with his legs and feet sticking straight out\r\nin front of him, Mr. Meredith told the governor the whole story. When\r\nhe had done, the governor rose and went over to where Jamie sat in the\r\nbig chair, his arms stretched along the chair’s arms.\r\n\r\nJamie would have wriggled out of the chair, but he had not time to\r\ndo so. And then, as he looked up into the grave, kind face, His\r\nExcellency, speaking very seriously, said:\r\n\r\n“My boy, you have done the people of Chicago and the people of Illinois\r\na great service--a service you will understand some day--and now, on\r\ntheir behalf, I wish to thank you for it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACOCHEE’S FIRST CAMPAIGN FUND\r\n\r\n\r\nSquire Goddard had been renominated as mayor of Macochee for the fifth\r\ntime, and for three weeks had played his customary checker games\r\nwith the firemen in the town hall, serene in the conviction that he\r\ncould not fail of reëlection. Then suddenly he awakened to the fact\r\nthat he had been the victim of a gum-shoe campaign. Election was but\r\na week off, and something had to be done. So they raised a campaign\r\nfund. Now, Macochee, in that day, had never had a campaign fund. The\r\nstate committee never put any money into Gordon County, even in a\r\npresidential year. The Republicans didn’t have to, and the Democrats\r\nknew better. The local candidates, of course, had little expenses\r\nof their own--for cigars, for carriages when there were township\r\nmeetings out in the little red school-house, for printing the tickets\r\n(in the days before we had the Australian ballot), and for Ganson’s\r\nhack to use at the polls on election day, but they were stingy in\r\nthese things. Macochee and Gordon County always went right, anyhow.\r\nJoe Boyle, Captain Bishop, Major Turner, old Bill Williams and John\r\nErnest had been parceling the fat offices in the court-house among\r\nthemselves ever since the war, and all a county convention ever had to\r\ndo was to renominate the old ticket, and it went through in November\r\nwithout a scratch. Sometimes, because of curious constitutional\r\nprejudices against a county treasurer succeeding himself, they had to\r\nrun Captain Bishop for county clerk, and let old Bill Williams have\r\nthe treasury, but it only meant, after all, changing the combination\r\na little, and beyond the trouble of moving some favorite old desk\r\nchairs, which had molded themselves to rheumatic backs, from one side\r\nof the court-house to the other, the ring remained undisturbed in that\r\nancient, life-giving pile. Of course they had to find a new candidate\r\nfor prosecuting attorney every six years, but, fortunately, the crop of\r\nyoung lawyers is one that never fails, whatever party is in power down\r\nin Washington.\r\n\r\nAnd so, among a virgin electorate, the advent of a campaign fund was\r\nan impressive event. The people felt that they had entered upon a new\r\nera in their political life, just as they did when the council bought\r\nthe new fire apparatus and began to agitate the question of bonding\r\nthe town for water-works--a proposition, by the way, upon which the\r\nleading citizens sat down quickly enough, because it meant taxes--while\r\nthe line of loafers leaning against the court-house fence increased,\r\nwaiting for the distribution. They had vague notions about a campaign\r\nfund in Macochee. The amount was reputed to be five hundred dollars,\r\nand, technically, it was in the custody of the court-house ring, but\r\nas they had never had a campaign fund to disburse before, and could\r\nnot decide how to proceed, it was temporarily locked in the county\r\ntreasurer’s vault, where, not being interest on the public moneys,\r\nit was comparatively safe. Meanwhile they were sticking closer than\r\nbrothers. They would not allow one of their number out of their sight.\r\nThey went to their meals in relays, and held night sessions in the\r\ntreasury, losing sleep and rest, so that all their latent diseases,\r\nrheumatics, phthisis, lumbago, gravel, and so on, were aggravated. They\r\nbecame cross, jealous and suspicious, full of envy, debate, deceit,\r\nmalignity; whisperers, back-biters, despiteful, proud, boasters,\r\ninventors of evil things. They swore as they had not sworn since the\r\nbattle of Port Republic. They cursed each other, they cursed Horace\r\nGoddard, and when these subjects failed, they cursed young Halliday.\r\n\r\nYoung Halliday was at the bottom of all the deviltry in Macochee. He\r\nhad not been out of Harvard a month before all the good people in the\r\ntown were wagging their heads sadly and saying: “Tsck! Tsck! Tsck!” He\r\nparted his hair in the middle. He brought home a habit of dropping his\r\nr’s, and of pronouncing his a’s with a broad accent, as, for instance,\r\nwhen he said “rawther;” he smoked cigarettes, puffed a heavy brier\r\npipe, wore red neckties and knickerbockers, and he drank beer. And he\r\ndid something else, something that struck the moral fiber of the town\r\non the raw. He changed his politics and became a Democrat!\r\n\r\nBeing a Democrat in Macochee is like being a Republican in Alabama.\r\nThere are hardly enough Democrats in Macochee--outside of the fifth\r\nward, which is Irish--to hold primaries, and they always have mass\r\nconventions to hide their political nakedness. Hank Defrees, the\r\nonly Democratic lawyer in Macochee, insisted that conventions were\r\nnecessary in order to keep up the party organization. He liked to go\r\nover to Columbus every two years as delegate to the state convention.\r\nIt afforded him an outing and a chance at the whisky in the Neil\r\nHouse. Besides, it is something to go to the state convention with the\r\nsolid vote of any county, even Gordon, in your vest pocket. The local\r\nDemocrats humored Hank. He had been their only available timber for\r\nCommon Pleas judge and prosecuting attorney, and he had been sacrificed\r\non the altar of his party times enough, surely, to entitle him to\r\nwhatever there was in sight.\r\n\r\nBut George Halliday had been reared a Republican. His father had been\r\nan Abolitionist, the friend of Salmon P. Chase, and his home had been\r\nknown in its time as one of the stations of the underground railway. He\r\nhad voted for John C. Fremont, and he had voted a straight Republican\r\nticket ever since. George had responded to these home influences\r\nsympathetically, and had given early promise of that vital interest in\r\npolitics for which Ohio mothers ardently look in their sons. His first\r\nexperience in politics was in 1876, when he took an active part in the\r\nHayes-Tilden campaign, crying after the little Catholic boys from the\r\nparochial school, on his homeward way at evening:\r\n\r\n  “Fried rats and pickled cats,\r\n  Are good enough for Democrats.”\r\n\r\nAnd once he marched with a party of his playmates in a torchlight\r\nprocession, under a transparency which announced exultantly:\r\n\r\n  “Hurrah for Hayes! He’s the man!\r\n  If we can’t vote, our daddies can!”\r\n\r\nThat was a fine campaign, extending far beyond autumn, and during\r\nthe long winter evenings he had been allowed to sit up, sometimes\r\nuntil after nine o’clock, to hear his father read in the Cincinnati\r\n_Gazette_, of the bloody deeds of the Ku-Klux Klan. The strange,\r\ncabalistic words froze the very blood in his veins. At night he would\r\nhear the drumming of horses’ hoofs, and see white-sheeted forms\r\ngalloping by in the gloom. Sometimes they halted and looked at him\r\nthrough big black eyeholes.\r\n\r\nThese were the Ku-Klux, and he was afraid, until the evening his father\r\ncame home radiant, sat down to the supper table with a smile that gave\r\na fine cheer to the room and said:\r\n\r\n“Well, we got Hayes in.”\r\n\r\nLater, when he was in the high school, he became a member of the Blaine\r\nand Logan marching club, wore a red oilcloth cape and carried a torch.\r\nAs he trudged along Macochee’s streets, strangely unfamiliar in the\r\ndarkness, breathing the smoke of the flaring torches, intoxicated by\r\nthe tired throbbing of the bass drum, he would shout in unison with the\r\nhoarse voices of excited men:\r\n\r\n  “Blaine--Blaine,\r\n  James--G.--Blaine!”\r\n\r\nThen the procession, debouching into the Square, was swallowed up by\r\nthe crowd; nothing remained of it but extinguished reeking torches\r\nscattered here and there among the thousands of restless heads. George\r\nwriggled his way up to the festooned band stand, he saw the pale\r\nspeakers and the countless vice-presidents--his father was one of the\r\nvice-presidents--and he listened to the inspiring song of the Glee Club:\r\n\r\n  “Dinna ye hear the slogan,\r\n  Jimmy Blaine and Johnny Logan?\r\n  The plumed knight and warrior bold\r\n    Are bound to gain the day.\r\n  The golden gates are creaking\r\n  While the Yankee boys are speaking,\r\n  And the Johnnies are retreating,\r\n    For we’re bound to gain the day.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes had been blurred by the tears, his heart had ached with the\r\nsecret pain of patriotism. He had registered sweet vows; he never could\r\nforget--and yet, now, just as his education was complete and he was\r\nready to enter upon his career, just as the new sign of the new firm of\r\nHalliday and Halliday, attorneys-at-law, was swinging at the foot of\r\nthe stairs in the People’s National Bank block, he had turned Democrat.\r\nIt was a sore subject at home. He and his father no longer discussed\r\nthe tariff question. Mrs. Halliday said it made her nervous, as it\r\nmight anybody.\r\n\r\nThat winter Halliday did nothing more serious than to attend a\r\nCatholic fair in Father Hennessey’s church, and make a speech awarding\r\nthe prize some one had won in the raffle. But in the spring, Hank\r\nDefrees, loafing around among the boys, told them the thing to do was\r\nto nominate George for mayor on the Democratic ticket, and it was done.\r\nWhen old Horace Goddard heard of the nomination, he chuckled until\r\nhis great belly shook, and actually invited Captain Bishop and the\r\nrest of the boys, who had gathered at the post-office to wait for the\r\nseven o’clock mail, around to Cramer’s drug store to have a drink. The\r\ncronies all laughed as they drank--though they said, with soberness,\r\nthat they felt sorry for old Judge Halliday himself.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruel thing to do, and it was young Halliday’s idea alone. He\r\nwas a youth with aspirations, and he saw in the nomination something\r\nmore than the mere compliment Hank Defrees had intended. Therefore\r\nSquire Goddard’s checker game was interrupted by a black-coated\r\ndelegation of Protestant clergymen. It was a Monday morning, and they\r\nmust have come straight from preachers’ meeting with their impudent\r\nquestions. They wanted to know whether or not it was true that the\r\nliquor laws had not been enforced, and how he stood on the saloon\r\nquestion generally. The old squire puffed profusely and made promises.\r\nThe next day a committee of saloon-keepers was called. The old man blew\r\nout his varicose cheeks and sputtered:\r\n\r\n“I’ve ran for mayor o’ this ’ere town now goin’ on five times, and I’m\r\ndog _damned_ if I ever heerd such a lot o’ fool questions before!”\r\n\r\nThe next day it was rumored that Father Hennessey had told his\r\nparishioners that Squire Goddard could not be trusted. Then the storm\r\nbroke. The W. C. T. U. held a mass meeting and issued an appeal to\r\nsave the boys. That night husbands were put on the rack of domestic\r\ninquisition. They had it pointed out to them that there was a drunkard\r\nin every fifth family--statistics proved it--and parents didn’t want\r\ntheir boys exposed any longer to such temptations. No one knew where\r\nthe statistical lightning was going to strike.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you want to intrust the regulation of the rum power to the\r\nDemocrats, do you?” sneered the husbands, with ironical grunts, thereby\r\nmoving the previous question and closing the debate. Nevertheless,\r\nafter that the mayor was kept busy explaining, which is the direst\r\nnecessity that can befall a candidate. He encountered Halliday in the\r\nSquare one day, and blazed forth:\r\n\r\n“You’re gittin’ too smart ’round this town all to onct, young feller.\r\nYou know more’n your pap a’ready, an’ if he can’t l’arn ye no respec’\r\nfer yer elders, I will.” He shook a palsied fist at the youth, as he\r\nadded, in a tone almost pitiable: “An’ I’ll tell him jest what you\r\ndone, too.”\r\n\r\nDefeat might have killed the old man, and the campaign was beginning\r\nto tell on him. But when they raised the fund, it was as a hot and\r\nsweetened toddy to warm the cockles of his heart. While he had no\r\nadequate concept of it, and while the manner of its working was a\r\nmystery to him, he did not doubt its efficacy. He felt safe. Also, as\r\nthe subject of the only campaign fund Gordon County had ever known,\r\nhe felt a supreme importance, which swelled out his chest and filled\r\nhim with a ripe content. He even found himself taking the opposition\r\nwith some zest, now that it was certain to be non-effective. Three\r\ndays more, thought the squire, and it would be all over. He imagined\r\nsome sort of civic triumph for himself. He dreamed of a serenade\r\nby the Macochee Silver Cornet Band, in the evening, under the shade\r\nof the pine trees about his home. He dramatized himself as bowing\r\nand smiling on the front porch. He would go out just as he was, in\r\nhis shirt-sleeves and slippers, his silver-bowed spectacles on his\r\nnose, and the Cincinnati paper in his hand. It would be thus more\r\nspontaneous, more democratic. Mandy would stand behind him, holding\r\nthe lamp high. The front picket fence would be black with people. He\r\nwondered if there would be enough of the campaign fund left to provide\r\nthe cake she must offer the band boys, and whether a part of its office\r\nwas to meet such contingencies. So the old squire sat in his old chair,\r\nthe split bottom of which had been worn shiny years ago, and smoked his\r\nold pipe, with sharp, dry puffs of contentment.\r\n\r\nThe squire looked forward to disbursing the fund himself, but the\r\ncourt-house ring still clung to it in indecision. Friday morning,\r\nwhen they met, election was but three days off, and the ring agreed\r\nthat they must get down to business. Major Turner said, with profound\r\nwisdom, that money could be used to best advantage in the saloons.\r\nCharley Bassett--he was prosecuting attorney then--asked, with a\r\nlawyer’s passion for fine distinctions, in what sense the major\r\nemployed the word “used.” Before the major could reply--he had knit his\r\nbrows and was whittling a fresh chew from his plug, to irrigate his\r\nthought--old Bill Williams said:\r\n\r\n“No, that won’t do; we must use it to get out the vote.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bassett, who always annoyed the old fellows with his young\r\nhaggling, “how’ll you get out the vote?”\r\n\r\nThe auditor, with an effort at something definite, said:\r\n\r\n“Why, we must have organization--that’s what wins in elections\r\nthese days.” He shook his head, in a keen triumph, for the phrase\r\npleased him, as phrases do please politicians. He began to conceive\r\nhimself--gladly, as a great political leader, as an organizer of\r\nvictory. “Organization, that’s the word,” he persisted, and then,\r\ngrowing bolder, he brought his fist down on his fat knee, and plunged\r\non heedlessly into detail.\r\n\r\n“You just give me that fund,” he said, “and I’ll--I’ll show you,” he\r\nbrought up lamely.\r\n\r\n“Well, tell us how you’d spend it,” insisted Bassett. “What’d you buy\r\nfirst? Remember, election’s only next Tuesday.”\r\n\r\n“Why, why,” hesitated Williams, “I’d spend it gittin’ out the vote.\r\nI’d git kerriages, and have signs painted to hang on the horses,\r\nreadin’,” and he lined the imaginary letters on the rough palm of his\r\nleft hand with the gnarled forefinger of his right, “‘Republican City\r\nCommittee--Vote for Goddard.’”\r\n\r\nThe old squire, tickled with the sound of the last legend, broke in\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n“You’ve got the idee, Billy.”\r\n\r\n“Course,” said Williams, expanding more and more, “I seen ’em that\r\nway when I was in Columbus onct, on ’lection day. Get about five good\r\ntwo-horse kerriages--”\r\n\r\nBut the captious Bassett, remembering that old Bill’s son-in-law, Hi\r\nWellman, kept the livery stable, interrupted him by saying:\r\n\r\n“Oh, that wouldn’t cost more’n twenty dollars, and, anyway, we can use\r\nour own buggies, same as we’ve always done.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Bishop, who had been carefully combing his whiskers with his\r\nfingers, then advanced his scheme.\r\n\r\n“Seems to me,” he said, “that we’d ought to have a campaign committee,\r\nwith a treasur’ and a finance committee, and let the treasur’ pay out\r\nonly on warrants drawed by the finance committee--then there’d be no\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“No, there’d be no question,” said Bassett cynically, “there’d be no\r\nquestion. And the finance committee could draw warrants for their own\r\narrest, while they’re about it.”\r\n\r\nThe ring gasped, and though the captain tried to say something about\r\nbusiness methods, they were all silent for a long time, chewing their\r\ntobacco gravely and thoughtfully, until the squire nervously ventured\r\nto ask:\r\n\r\n“But what do you think we’d best spend it fer?”\r\n\r\n“Votes,” said Bassett laconically.\r\n\r\n“That’s surely what we want,” said Judge Ernest, speaking for the first\r\ntime. The old men in the circle wheeled toward the probate judge. They\r\nhad not been surprised at what Bassett said, for he never attended\r\nservice, and was reputed to be a free-thinker, but Judge Ernest was a\r\npillar in the church.\r\n\r\n“Why, John,” said Major Turner, “you don’t mean to say you’d buy votes?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t say I would, did I?” snapped the old man, wriggling uneasily in\r\nhis Delaware chair. “I meant that the money ought to be used so as to\r\nproduce votes.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” assented Bassett.\r\n\r\n“And if it don’t do that,” the judge went on, “why we’d ought to give\r\nit back to them as contributed.” The judge offered this solution with a\r\nnew hope dawning in his heart, for he had mourned over the ten dollars\r\nhe had invested in the fund. A murmur of approval ran around the ring,\r\nand the old squire, fearing the dissolution of the fund, was the only\r\none in the room whose face did not glow.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you, boys,” said Joe Bogle, “we might whack her up among the\r\ncrowd and everybody do the best they can with their share.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I call a grand su’gestion,” said Judge Ernest, shaking his\r\nhead approvingly.\r\n\r\nBut Bassett shook his head the other way. “No,” he said, “that won’t\r\ndo, we want some system in this thing. It ought to be changed into\r\ndollar bills and then given to the central committeemen to use in\r\ntheir wards election day. Of course we won’t need so much in the strong\r\nRepublican wards--we’ll put it out in Lighttown and down in Gooseville\r\namong the niggers, and some of it across the tracks among the boys in\r\nthe shops--that’s where it’ll tell.”\r\n\r\nBut the ring stubbornly opposed the idea of letting that pile of money\r\ngo out of its hands. They put only young men on the city committee, and\r\nthe honor and importance were enough for them. They would be wanting\r\noffice next.\r\n\r\nThe old squire voiced the protest.\r\n\r\n“’Pears to me,” he whined, “that as I’m runnin’, I’d ought to have a\r\nleetle of it fer my own expenses on ’lection day. I’ve been givin’ of\r\nmy services to the party now fer nigh on to twenty year, not countin’\r\nmy term in the army, and it’s expensive, ’specially with that young\r\nHalliday carryin’ on the way he is--”\r\n\r\n“No one never made up a fund for none of us, Hod Goddard,” chorused the\r\nold fellows.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and there’s others on the ticket besides you,” interrupted\r\nBassett. “Let each candidate spend his own money if he wants to. You\r\nhain’t paid your assessment yet, anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“But I’m the head o’ the ticket,” stammered the squire, his red face\r\ndeepening to purple.\r\n\r\nThe booming of the town clock in the court-house tower startled the\r\nring, and the county officials glanced at their big silver watches.\r\nThey were already half an hour late for their dinners.\r\n\r\n“And my wife told me to fetch home some meat,” said Bassett, forgetting\r\nall else as he seized his hat.\r\n\r\nAnd so the conference broke up. Saturday night came, they had no\r\nsolution, and, like those that do business in great waters, were at\r\ntheir wits’ end.\r\n\r\nSunday morning a report spread through the town that caused the ring\r\nto take heart of grace. It was a report of serious defections in\r\nHalliday’s ranks. Jerry Sullivan, Scotty Gordon, old man Garwood, Rice\r\nMurrell and even Hank Defrees had been going about town all Saturday\r\nafternoon and evening, and everywhere they went they told people it\r\nwas no use--Halliday couldn’t be elected. He might have been two\r\nweeks ago, if he had acted differently, but now--they shook their\r\nheads. They couldn’t stand for him any more--he needn’t look to them\r\nfor support--he hadn’t treated them right--they had been fools to\r\nexpect anything from such a dude. Five hundred dollars, they said,\r\njudiciously used, would settle his hash. They wished they had the\r\nmanagement of it, they would revenge themselves for his slights and\r\ninsults. And these were representative men, even if their portraits had\r\nnot been made in half-tone for the _History of Gordon County_.\r\n\r\nJerry Sullivan lived on the hill behind the priest’s house, and was\r\nthe “darlint” of all the old women in Lighttown. He was a lad of power\r\nin the Fifth Ward. Scotty Gordon lived across the tracks in the Second\r\nWard and worked in the shops. Old man Garwood lived just at the edge of\r\ntown, on the Blue Jacket road, in the Fourth Ward, and Rice Murrell,\r\nthe Reverend Rice Murrell, the pastor of the A. M. E. church--who had\r\nturned Democrat when they took the janitorship of the court-house away\r\nfrom him--could do more with the colored voters down in Gooseville than\r\nany man, save Judge Halliday, and he was out of politics. Hank Defrees,\r\nof course, who still shivered under the fringe of a ragged garment\r\nof respectability by clinging to a heavily mortgaged home far out on\r\nScioto Street, where the better element of the town began to thin out\r\ninto social mediocrity, stood for the aristocratic Third Ward, with its\r\nnormal Republican majority of two hundred and eleven. The Democrats had\r\nnever been able to make up a ward delegation in the Third, and Defrees\r\nfor years and years had sat in all city and county conventions very\r\nmuch at large.\r\n\r\nSuch a defection, on the eve of election, was serious, as every one\r\nrecognized. Just after dinner, on Sunday, Judge Halliday, who had\r\ndisclaimed all interest in the campaign, beckoned his son into the\r\nparlor, darkened for secrets, and said to him in a whisper that Mrs.\r\nHalliday plainly heard over the banister of the staircase in the hall:\r\n\r\n“Did you know that Hank Defrees and that Sullivan boy and Gordon and\r\nold man Garwood, and even Rice Murrell, are around working against you?”\r\n\r\nGeorge gasped with surprise.\r\n\r\n“And did you know,” the father whispered on, “that the Republicans have\r\nraised a corruption fund--five hundred dollars, I understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard that,” said George, “must be getting desperate, you\r\nfellows, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Now, my son,” said the judge, with brows lowered, “you know I would\r\nhave absolutely nothing to do with such a business as that. You know my\r\nopinions on such things too well.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course, father,” said the boy, “that’s all right. I know you\r\nwouldn’t countenance it--”\r\n\r\n“And I was just going to say,” the elder man continued, “that while I\r\ndo not agree with you, and while I would not vote for you--at least,\r\nI do not think I would--I was just going to say that if you need any\r\nmoney yourself, to meet any of the--ah--legitimate expenses of your\r\ncampaign, why, just call on me.”\r\n\r\nThe boy grasped his father’s hand, and when he could speak, he said:\r\n\r\n“Thank you, father, thank you, but not now--it isn’t worth it--but I’ll\r\nsee what’s the matter with these Indians, anyway.”\r\n\r\nGeorge went to his offices, over the People’s National Bank and\r\nwaited an hour in the rear room, a dark and dingy room, with the dust\r\nof a country law office deep on everything, and one ray of sunlight\r\nscrambling in through the heavy shutters from the alley. Then one after\r\nanother, up the worn and splintered stairs with tin signs of insurance\r\nagents and notaries public on every step, five men clambered. They\r\nwere grinning when they entered the room, grinning and standing about\r\nawkwardly, all save Hank Defrees, who was solemn and imponderable,\r\nchewing his tobacco as gravely as if he were making an appearance in\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said George, standing in the middle of the floor, “anything\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\nThe men all looked at one another, hesitating to speak, but finally\r\nScotty Gordon said:\r\n\r\n“Happened! Well, I guess yes.”\r\n\r\n“What?” queried George.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he began, “now I done it, and last night old Bill Williams\r\nhunted me up in Jake Fogarty’s saloon, and, well, he offered me fifty\r\ndollars to use if I wanted it.”\r\n\r\n“Say,” Jerry Sullivan broke in--“Captain Bishop offered me\r\nseventy-five.”\r\n\r\n“And didn’t you take it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no,” said Jerry.\r\n\r\n“What did you tell him?”\r\n\r\nThe lad’s eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n“I told him,” he answered slowly, “that it wouldn’t be a drop in the\r\nbucket.”\r\n\r\n“Good for you,” said George. “And now, Mr. Garwood?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the old man, “don’t know as I got much to say. Major\r\nTurner, though, ’as ’round to my house this morning, an’--Well, he\r\noffered me fifty dollars if I felt the way I had been reported, and\r\nthought I could use it.”\r\n\r\n“Judge,” said George, turning to Defrees, “it’s up to you.”\r\n\r\nThe old lawyer took his tobacco in his fist and chucked it away. “Joe\r\nBogle,” he said, “told me he knew where there’s a hundred for me if I\r\ncould do any good with it.”\r\n\r\n“And, doctor,” said Halliday, facing around to the Reverend Mr.\r\nMurrell, who stood solemn in his black garments and white tie, “what\r\nhappened to you?”\r\n\r\nThe old negro glanced all around him cautiously and even craned his\r\nneck to peer into the room beyond.\r\n\r\n“Well, suh,” he began, “Judge Ernest ’as out this mornin’ to hyah me\r\npreach, an’ aftah service was ovah, he drawed me to one side, and\r\n’gin to talk politics. He ast me how I felt towa’ds you all, Mistuh\r\nHalliday, an’--Ah didn’ like to say it--but you done tol’ me, ’membah.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said George, urging the parson out of his hesitation,\r\n“you made it strong, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“Wellum, Ah tol’ the judge that Ah wasn’ pow’ful strong on you any\r\nmoah, sense, Ah said, you all hadn’t felt ’sposed to help us ’ith the\r\nsubscription fo’ the new roof on ouah chu’ch.”\r\n\r\n“That was clever,” said George, “damned clever--I beg your pardon.”\r\nThe old negro’s eyes had widened till their whites showed, and he had\r\nraised his hands, holding up his yellow palms before George. “But go\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suh, the jedge ’as al’ays had an interest in ouah spiritual\r\nwelfare, an’ so he ’lowed we’d ought to be holpen out some.” The old\r\nman paused and swallowed ceremoniously. “An’ so, gen’lemen, he offered\r\nme a hundred an’ fifty dollahs.”\r\n\r\nThe dark eyes of the old man shone with a strange new luster.\r\n\r\n“What did you say?”\r\n\r\n“Well, suh,” the preacher hesitated, “Ah took it.”\r\n\r\nGeorge brought his hand down on the parson’s shoulder with a heavy\r\nslap and he laughed. “Good, Bishop, good.”\r\n\r\nThey counted the money out on the table--exactly four hundred and\r\nninety dollars, the first campaign fund Macochee had ever known. Then\r\nthey laughed and laughed and laughed.\r\n\r\nWhen Halliday had laid his plans for the morrow’s battle before his\r\ncompanions, he leaned back in his chair and said, turning to the\r\nReverend Rice Murrell:\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose, Bishop, that you approve of the use of money in\r\npolitics, do you?”\r\n\r\n“No, _suh_,” the old preacher replied, with a smart gravity, “an’\r\nsomepin’ done tol’ me, yist’day, when the jedge come to see me, that it\r\n’as jus’ providential that this much o’ that filthy lucah ’as removed\r\nfrom corruptin’ ouah ’lections by bein’ placed in mah han’s.” His\r\nrolling eyes bulged and he dribbled at the mouth as he fingered the\r\npile of bills.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said George, “don’t put too big a roof on the church, and\r\nremember--Gooseville’s going to vote to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nevah you feah ’bout Gooseville, mah brothah--she’ll be votin’\r\nearly an’ of’en to-morrah, an’ she’ll vote right.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Halliday was mayor of Macochee but one term. That is a trick\r\nthat has been played once in every town in this free republic--but it\r\ncan never be played twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SECRET OF STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nOver at the executive mansion, Governor Chatham and his private\r\nsecretary were at dinner when the telegram came. The governor took\r\nthe yellow envelope from the butler’s tray and tore it open. When he\r\nhad read the message he passed it over without a word to Gilman. The\r\nprivate secretary’s eyes widened as he read it, and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Jim Lockhart dead!”\r\n\r\nWilliam, the black butler, stirred uneasily. The governor bent forward,\r\nand lifted his coffee to his lips. Gilman laid the despatch beside\r\nhis plate, and, still looking at it, began to pinch the golden tip of\r\na cigarette. William slid noiselessly to his side with a match. When\r\nGilman had lighted his cigarette he said:\r\n\r\n“Poor Jim!”\r\n\r\nThe governor responded:\r\n\r\n“Yes, poor Jim.”\r\n\r\nA strange quality in the governor’s tone gave expression to something\r\nmore than sadness. His face was somber, immobile, inscrutable. He\r\ndropped his napkin, and, without lighting his cigar, though William\r\nstood by, shading the little flame of the ready match with his pale\r\npalm, he rose and went slowly into the library. About the walls were\r\nhis beloved books. On the broad, heavy table of Flemish oak a shaded\r\nlamp rose over the magazines, the pamphlets, the scattered books and\r\nthe Chicago newspapers, which reach Springfield at noon. In the wide\r\nchimney--over which is carved those words from the _Benedicte_, “Oh, ye\r\nFire and Heat, Bless ye the Lord”--a brazier of Sangamon County coal\r\nwas blazing. Outside a cold November rain was driving against the tall\r\nwindows of the mansion. The governor sank into a deep leather chair. He\r\nsupported his head in his hand and gazed into the fire.\r\n\r\nGilman followed, and seating himself, likewise fell into a melancholy\r\nreverie. The silence within, and the wind sweeping the rain back and\r\nforth like a broom without, oppressed him. He was a young man. Once or\r\ntwice he looked at the governor, and then the silence, the wind and the\r\nrain forced him to speak.\r\n\r\n“He seemed to be in perfect health when he went away Wednesday,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThe silence deepened. The wind threshed the trees and the rain drenched\r\nthe windows anew. Gilman spoke again. He said:\r\n\r\n“The party’s lost a good man.”\r\n\r\n“And I have lost another friend,” said the governor. He was growing old.\r\n\r\nWithout moving, still gazing deeply into the coals, after a little\r\nminute, he added:\r\n\r\n“He was the most generous man I ever knew.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and I believe, after all, when the time came, he would have been\r\nwith you for the renomination.” The governor stretched out his hand to\r\nstay Gilman’s speech.\r\n\r\n“I was not thinking of that, Leonard.”\r\n\r\nThe governor did this gently, as he did all things. Gilman’s face\r\nreddened--for the fire was growing hot--and silence fell again between\r\nthem. Gilman felt the silence. He flung his cigarette into the fire.\r\nThen he rose.\r\n\r\n“Guess I’ll go over to the Leland,” he said. “Some of the boys may have\r\nparticulars.”\r\n\r\nThe governor nodded acquiescence, but as Gilman reached the door that\r\nleads into the northwest drawing-room, he spoke:\r\n\r\n“Before you go hand me the statutes, if you please. I suppose I have\r\nsome duty to perform in an event like this.”\r\n\r\nGilman who longed only for action, bore with alacrity the three big\r\ncalf-skin volumes to the library table, and turned to the index.\r\n\r\n“I’ll find the section for you.” Gilman examined the second volume for\r\nan instant, and then said: “Here it is.”\r\n\r\n“Read it, please,” said the governor.\r\n\r\nAnd Gilman read: “‘Section sixteen. In case of the death of the\r\ntreasurer, it shall be the duty of the governor to take possession of\r\nthe office of such treasurer, and cause the vaults thereof to be closed\r\nand securely locked, and so remain until a successor is appointed and\r\nqualified; and at the time such successor takes possession of the\r\noffice, he, together with the auditor of public accounts and any of\r\nthe bondmen of the deceased treasurer who shall be present, shall\r\nproceed to take an account of all moneys, papers, books, records and\r\nother property coming into his possession; and the auditor shall take\r\nof such succeeding treasurer his receipt therefor and keep the same on\r\nfile in his office.’ There,” concluded Gilman, closing the book, and\r\nthen immediately reopening it, “that’s it--it’s chapter one hundred\r\nand thirty, section sixteen of the act of eighteen seventy-three, page\r\ntwenty-three twenty-seven.”\r\n\r\n“Now turn,” said the governor, “to the chapter on elections, chapter\r\nforty-six, I think it is, and see what it says about the appointment of\r\na successor.”\r\n\r\nGilman tilted up the first volume, and inspected the red and black\r\nlabels on its back; then he turned to chapter forty-six, and, running\r\nhis finger down the pages until he found the section, read hurriedly,\r\nmumbling his words until he came to the vital sentence:\r\n\r\n“‘When a vacancy shall occur in the office of secretary of state,\r\nauditor of public accounts,’ yes, here it is” (he accentuated the word)\r\n“‘_treasurer_, attorney-general, superintendent of public instruction’”\r\n(he was reading rapidly now and running words together) “‘or member\r\nof the state board of equalization, the governor’” (and now he raised\r\nhis voice and read more slowly and distinctly) “‘the governor shall\r\nfill the same by appointment, and the appointee shall hold his office\r\nduring the remainder of the term, and until his successor is elected\r\nand qualified.’ That’s section hundred and twenty-eight.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the governor, “I’ll name Hillman to fill the vacancy.”\r\nHillman was the treasurer-elect, chosen by the people in November\r\nto succeed Lockhart. He was not of the party, however, to which the\r\ngovernor belonged. In Illinois, it will be remembered, treasurers\r\nare elected not quadrennially, as are the other state officials,\r\nbut biennially, and a treasurer can not succeed himself. So that in\r\nthe middle of an administration there is always an off year, and a\r\nreaction, and as the papers say, a stinging rebuke at the polls.\r\n\r\n“M-m-yes,” said Gilman, “the boys won’t like it--but it’s only for a\r\ncouple of months.”\r\n\r\n“And as to sealing the treasury,” continued the governor, “I presume\r\nthat the morning will be time enough for that.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s a bad night outside, anyway,” responded Gilman. The\r\ngovernor was lost again in thought. Gilman went on and out.\r\n\r\nThe governor, alone in the library, continued to gaze into the fire.\r\nOnce he took from the table at his elbow a worn book, which he handled\r\ntenderly. He read in it for a while. It was _The Thoughts of Marcus\r\nAurelius_. But he did not read long. Presently he was sitting with the\r\nforefinger of one hand between the leaves of the book, which lay in\r\nhis lap, musing on the fire again. Outside the rain drenched the tall\r\nwindows of the mansion.\r\n\r\nThe clock in the hall tolled eleven. The governor rose, and went slowly\r\nup the staircase that winds gracefully from the great hall to the floor\r\nabove, and thence to his chamber and his bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a room on the parlor floor of the Leland, the windows of which\r\nlooked down on Sixth street, a short, fat man was pacing the floor.\r\nHis unbuttoned waistcoat showed a white shirt stretched over a large\r\npaunch. His hair was greased with perspiration, big drops of which\r\nstood out on his forehead, and slid down his pendulous, dewlapt cheeks.\r\nHe had a bristling mustache, at which he gnawed when he removed his\r\ncigar from his lips, and a short goatee at which he plucked incessantly\r\nwith his fingers. When his cigar was in his mouth, he rolled it about\r\nand ground it between his teeth. At times he spat pieces of the tobacco\r\nleaves fiercely into the grate. The cigar was burning unevenly, and\r\nfuming so that the little man winked his little eyes. On a table in\r\nthe room, littered with the inevitable Chicago papers, and strewn with\r\npoker chips, stood an empty whisky glass. The rumpled counterpane of\r\nthe bed showed that the little man had been tossing upon it. As he\r\npaced up and down he talked to himself, and at times swore.\r\n\r\n“Hell,” he would say, “why the devil doesn’t he come!”\r\n\r\nOccasionally he would draw out his watch, and scowl at its face. Then\r\nhe would look at the old-fashioned brass crank on the wall, beside\r\nthe door, which sometimes pulled a call-bell in the office below, and\r\nsometimes did not, but he did not ring it. He ran his fingers through\r\nhis tumbled hair, and paced up and down.\r\n\r\nThe little man was William Grigsby, and he was the attorney-general\r\nof the state of Illinois. He had come down from the Jo Daviess\r\nhills, to serve a term in the house, and been nominated for the\r\noffice he now held by the governor, John Chatham. John Chatham was\r\nhis political creator, and the two men had once been friends. The\r\nadministration had begun harmoniously enough, but before two of the\r\nfour years of its political life had expired there was a split, and\r\nfactions had formed. There had been a fierce fight for the control\r\nof the state central committee that year, and the struggle had been\r\ncarried into the state convention, which nominated a state treasurer,\r\na superintendent of public instruction, and trustees of the university\r\nof Illinois. In one faction were the governor, the auditor of public\r\naccounts, and, of course, his appointees, the adjutant-general, the\r\nrailroad and warehouse commissioners and the trustees of the state\r\ninstitutions. In the other were the attorney-general and the secretary\r\nof state, Jennings. Lockhart, the state treasurer, had been neutral.\r\nHe was everybody’s friend. The lieutenant-governor did not count. The\r\nsuperintendent of public instruction was not a politician, save in\r\nteachers’ institutes, where he was cheered and indorsed in classic\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nAnd now Grigsby was an avowed candidate for governor, in opposition\r\nto his old friend, John Chatham, the man who had made him. Two years\r\nbring about great changes in politics. Grigsby, in that time, had grown\r\ncorpulent, had hardened his liver and his heart, and was threatened\r\nwith Bright’s disease.\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general continued to smoke and pace the floor, and\r\nswear. After a while he consulted his watch again, and then gave the\r\nold-fashioned brass bell-pull a vigorous jerk. Presently a negro boy\r\ncame bearing a presumptive pitcher of water, the tinkling of the ice\r\nheralding his approach. The attorney-general would have welcomed iced\r\nwater in the morning, but now he seized it from the black boy’s hand,\r\nset it down with a splash on his wash-stand, and shouted:\r\n\r\n“Go and tell Jim to mix me a commodore.”\r\n\r\nJust as the boy reached the door, it opened, and a tall man entered.\r\nThe tall man seeing the boy, looked at Grigsby.\r\n\r\n“What’ll you have, Hank?” said the attorney-general.\r\n\r\n“A little whisky.”\r\n\r\n“Bring Mr. Jennings some whisky,” ordered the attorney-general.\r\n\r\n“Bourbon, boy,” added Mr. Jennings.\r\n\r\nThe boy withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general paused before the fire, and looked up into the\r\nface of the secretary of state.\r\n\r\n“Well, Hank,” he said, “I began to fear you hadn’t got my message.\r\nHeard the news?”\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state lazily pulled off his wet overcoat and flung\r\nit across the bed, and then, shaking the water from his broad-brimmed\r\nblack slouch hat in the careless way they have down in southern\r\nIllinois, he tossed it after the coat, on which it fell with a damp\r\nslap. He stood six feet in height, and would have been taller had he\r\nnot stooped. His face was long, his skin dingy and sallow, and his\r\nthin nose, beginning between deep-set eyes of steely blue, stretched\r\ndown the middle of his visage, and precipitated itself over the black\r\nmustache that drooped thin and moist about his mouth. His hair, glossy\r\nblack, though he was fifty, was flung straight across his brow and\r\nover his left ear, giving the effect of a mane. Behind, it greased the\r\ncollar of a long black frock coat that wrapped him lankly. A narrow\r\nblack tie hung unknotted at his throat. When he moved it was in that\r\nloose and lazy way that told, as his hat and his habit did, that he\r\ncame from the country south of the old O. and M., which divides Egypt\r\nfrom the corn lands of central Illinois. He drew a rocking-chair to the\r\ngrate, and stretching himself comfortably in it, with his feet upon\r\nthe ash-strewn fender, drew from his hip pocket a plug of tobacco and\r\ngnawed on it. Then he drawled, in a voice haunted by musical echoes of\r\nsouthern ancestry:\r\n\r\n“What news?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied the attorney-general, “haven’t you heard? Jim Lockhart’s\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n“The hell he is!” responded Jennings. “I hadn’t heerd ary word. When’d\r\nhe die?”\r\n\r\n“This afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“Sudden?”\r\n\r\n“Rather.”\r\n\r\n“What was ailin’ of him?”\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general smiled, a peculiar, mirthless smile.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state ceased to rock.\r\n\r\n“You don’t reckon now--”\r\n\r\n“That’s it exactly.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know it’d got that bad. What’d they give out fer the cause?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, heart failure, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Beats hell, don’t it?”\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state was silent. Presently he spoke again in an\r\nabstracted way:\r\n\r\n“Well, Jim ’as a devil of a good feller, as good as you’d meet up ’ith\r\nin a coon’s age. An’ I reckon when it come to a show-down, he ’as our\r\nfriend. If the boys ’p’ints an investigatin’ committee--Jim ’as al’ays\r\na leetle too free ’ith the stuff.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby said “Yes,” in a detached tone. Then there was silence for a\r\nspace. The bell-boy knocked, bore in his tray and departed. The men\r\nnodded over the edges of their little glasses each to the other, and\r\ndrank. Then Grigsby, wiping his lips, said:\r\n\r\n“Hank, I didn’t send for you to-night to hold memorial services over\r\nJim Lockhart. There’s something more important than that--there’s\r\nsomething damned important, and it concerns me.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, me. I’m in this thing just twenty thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“The hell you are!”\r\n\r\n“Just--twenty--thousand--dollars.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby sank into a chair.\r\n\r\n“Borrowed?” asked Jennings.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Public funds?”\r\n\r\n“Well--I don’t know. Course--”\r\n\r\n“Jim Lockhart didn’t have no private fortune--’ithout it ’as the\r\nint’rust.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose it was.”\r\n\r\n“An’thin’ to show fer it?”\r\n\r\n“I gave him three notes--one for ten, two for five thousand each.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’re a bigger damn fool than I gave you credit fer bein’.”\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general, clutching his fingers into his hair, rested\r\nhis elbows on his short knees, and bowed his head. “And with the\r\ngovernorship just in plain sight, too,” he groaned.\r\n\r\n“Well, it wasn’t so damn plain,” said Jennings.\r\n\r\nThen as his eye rested on the man bowed beside him, the sweat trickling\r\ndown his tallow face, something in the droop of the figure touched\r\na chord of pity in his heart, and the tall Egyptian laid a hand on\r\nGrigsby’s shoulder, saying in another tone:\r\n\r\n“Don’t take on that way. Let’s see what can be done.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let’s,” assented Grigsby.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian knitted the brows over his long, narrow nose.\r\n\r\n“Hev you got any money?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I!” exclaimed Grigsby, with a sardonic grunt.\r\n\r\n“Any property?”\r\n\r\n“Only my house up home.”\r\n\r\n“Hain’t you any friends up there, any bankers that’ll take care o’ this\r\nthing fer you?”\r\n\r\nGrigsby laughed ironically.\r\n\r\n“Cain’t you lay down on somebody fer it?”\r\n\r\nGrigsby shook his head.\r\n\r\n“How’s your quo ’arranto proceedin’s ’gainst the Chicago Consolidated?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t ripe yet,” said Grigsby, “and, anyhow, there isn’t time.\r\nDamn it, man,” he said, raising his voice, and striking his knee\r\nwith his fist, “it’s got to be done now, to-night, or I’m lost. The\r\ngovernor, under the law, must seal the treasury at once, and you know\r\njust how long John Chatham’ll wait. We’ve got to take care of this\r\nthing to-night, to-night, I tell you. That’s why I sent for you.” The\r\nattorney-general spoke angrily, and with a puffed face that flushed an\r\nunhealthy red, and then added, stretching forth his hand and laying it\r\non Jennings’ knee, “You’re my friend, ain’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” said the secretary of state carelessly, and then knitted his\r\nbrows again. After a few minutes he said:\r\n\r\n“Say, Bill, you and the governor used to be friends, and he hain’t a\r\nbad feller, no-way. He got you your nomination, you know--why don’t you\r\ngo to him--”\r\n\r\n“Go to the governor?” cried Grigsby; “and tell him--tell _him_!”\r\n\r\n“Bill,” said the secretary of state, “you don’t know the governor. He\r\nhain’t my kind, ner I his’n, but I’ll tell you one thing--he hain’t the\r\nman to take advantage of a feller. You’d be as safe in his hands as you\r\nwould in mine--safer, maybe,” Jennings concluded, with a good-humored\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\nGrigsby emphatically, doggedly, shook his head.\r\n\r\n“It never would do in this world,” he said, “never.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you could get him to hold off till you could take care of it. You\r\nand him used to be such friends--tell him you’ll lay down fer the sake\r\nof old times--that’s the thing--tell him an’thin’ to get him to hold\r\noff fer a few days. Then you’ll have time to turn ’round.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Jennings,” said Grigsby, straightening up and glaring at\r\nthe secretary of state, “Chatham’s got all you fellows hypnotized. You\r\nthink he’s a little tin god, that he’s incapable of doing a mean act,\r\nof throwing a friend down, or anything of that sort. I tell you I know\r\nhim better than all of you do. He and I used to be close, thicker’n--”\r\n\r\n“You wasn’t borrowin’ money out o’ the state treasury them days,\r\nthough, was you, Bill?” interrupted Jennings.\r\n\r\nGrigsby colored.\r\n\r\n“No, you was somethin’ of a reformer yourself.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby colored more deeply.\r\n\r\n“An’ as fer the throwin’ down--we know who done the heft o’ that.\r\nCourse I don’t care--it suits me--but give a houn’ his dues.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby’s color had changed by swift gradations of tone to splenetic\r\nblackness. He broke in upon Jennings’ indictment of him, and his\r\ndefense of the governor:\r\n\r\n“Oh, drop that--let’s talk business. I tell you I know Chatham, and I\r\nain’t goin’ to put myself in his hands.”\r\n\r\nHe drew out his watch and opened it.\r\n\r\n“It’s half-past eight now, and he doubtless knows Lockhart’s\r\ndead--probably he’s got the treasury sealed.”\r\n\r\nJennings’ brow was gathered once more in wrinkles that indicated\r\nthought. His face rapidly assumed an expression of determination.\r\nPresently he rose.\r\n\r\n“Bill,” he said, “I’m goin’ to do somethin’ fer you I wouldn’t do fer\r\nany other livin’ man.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby raised an appealing, yearning face.\r\n\r\n“Yest’day I deposited in Gregory’s bank over at Decatur twenty-four\r\nthousand dollars. It’s the fees received in my office durin’ the last\r\nquarter. It’s lucky fer you they was unusually large--”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Grigsby, and his expression, expectant and hopeful a moment\r\nbefore, clouded, “but it’s in Decatur, and we’re in Springfield and\r\nwe’ve got to have it now, to-night, if it’s goin’ to do us any good.\r\nWhat the devil did you want to deposit it in Gregory’s bank for?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” replied Jennings, “Gregory’s rich, and a contributor, an’ he\r\ncan deliver Macon County, and we’ll want Macon County’s ten votes, if I\r\nhain’t mistaken, one of these days. But never mind that now--it’s the\r\non’y thing we can do.”\r\n\r\nJennings looked at his watch. “It’s now twenty-five till nine. A train\r\ngoes out on the Wabash at nine-five. I’ll send Hennessey over on that\r\ntrain with a note to Gregory, an’ a check. He can get twenty thousand,\r\nan’ ketch a train back ’bout eleven-twenty, I think, anyway--that train\r\nthat gets here at twelve-forty. You can take the money, put it back in\r\nthe treasury, ’fore the governor seals ’er up, an’--”\r\n\r\nGrigsby sprang toward Jennings and seized his hand.\r\n\r\n“Hank, you’re the best friend I ever had,” he cried, and his eyes\r\nglistened.\r\n\r\n“Aw, don’t talk like that,” said Jennings awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“But can we trust Hennessey?” said Grigsby, the next instant, his eyes\r\ndilating, his hand suddenly dropping by his side.\r\n\r\n“Hell, we’ve got to,” said Jennings. Then he strode across the room\r\nand turned the old-fashioned brass bell-pull.\r\n\r\nWhen a black boy grinned in the doorway, Jennings sent for Hennessey,\r\nand soon, the old elevator having clambered to the parlor floor, there\r\nwas a knock. Jennings yelled “Come!” and in the doorway stood a young\r\nIrishman, red-cheeked and with closely-cropped, silver-sprinkled black\r\nhair. In the cities, the hair of the Irish-American--especially in\r\npolitics, and they are all in--turns gray early. Hennessey was strong\r\nin the Thirteenth Ward of Chicago, hence his job in the office of\r\nthe secretary of state. Jennings had been writing while awaiting the\r\nIrishman’s coming. Turning to him the secretary of state gave his\r\ninstructions, and he departed. As he closed the door Grigsby called:\r\n\r\n“I’ll make it all right with you, Mike.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby went to the window and pressed his face to one of the small\r\npanes, placing his hands as blinds beside his eyes as a little child\r\ndoes. The cold glass soothed his forehead deliciously. He saw Shorty,\r\nwho has driven “statesmen” on their mysterious nightly rounds for\r\ngenerations, mount the box of his old hack and pull his reluctant\r\nhorses into the street. Then he turned to confront the three hours’\r\nwait. He poked the smouldering fire of soft prairie coal, gave Jennings\r\na cigar, and was about to pull the old-fashioned brass bell crank that\r\nmore cheer might be added to the factitious comfort he sought to create\r\nin the room, when Jennings, meditatively scratching his head, said:\r\n\r\n“Bill, where’s them notes o’ yourn?”\r\n\r\n“Why, in the treasury, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you’ll have to get some one who can open the vaults fer you\r\nto-night.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby’s brow darkened, and the small cheerfulness that had begun to\r\nadumbrate itself in his face faded quite away.\r\n\r\n“That’s so--I hadn’t thought of that.”\r\n\r\nHe pondered heavily and then said, the old note of fear in his tone:\r\n\r\n“Has that vault a time lock?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon.”\r\n\r\nThey were silent.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Grigsby presently, breaking the silence, “I’ll have to\r\nget Mendenhall.” Mendenhall was the assistant state treasurer, and was\r\ncounted among the adherents of Grigsby.\r\n\r\n“Better let me go,” said Jennings, taking up his coat and hat.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone Grigsby again paced the floor. Now he would pause at\r\nthe window and look down into Sixth Street, where the rain, falling\r\nhopelessly and helplessly, was making pools in the depressions of the\r\ncedar block pavement that glinted in the white glare of the arc light\r\nspluttering before the hotel. Whenever the hoarse sounds of distant\r\nlocomotive whistles came to him out of the wet night, he jerked forth\r\nhis watch and sighed as he replaced it. Then he began to worry because\r\nJennings did not reappear. He wondered if Governor Chatham would\r\nventure out in such a night to seal the treasury. He cursed Chatham,\r\nwho had made him, and finally Jennings, who had saved him. Altogether,\r\nhe passed a very bad two hours. And then Jennings returned. As the tall\r\nEgyptian entered the room, Grigsby demanded:\r\n\r\n“Where you been?”\r\n\r\n“Over to the St. Nick--met up ’ith some o’ the boys, an’ set into a\r\nlittle game fer a while.”\r\n\r\n“See Mendenhall?”\r\n\r\n“Yep--he’ll be ’long. Gosh! it’s a regular Shawneetown flood outside!”\r\nAnd the man waved his big hat in a wide arc, the spray from it spitting\r\nangrily as it sprinkled the fire in the grate.\r\n\r\n“So it’s all right, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Ump huh.”\r\n\r\n“How about the time lock?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, George says they don’t never use that--haven’t sence the day the\r\nsenate ’p’inted that committee to count the money in the treasury.\r\n’Member? By gosh, didn’t pore ol’ Jim hustle to get a special train an’\r\nhaul that money down from Chicago, though?”\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state wagged his long head and chuckled.\r\n\r\n“That thing lost him e’enamost fifty thousan’ in int’rust, he tol’ me\r\nonct,” the secretary of state went on, “an’ he hain’t never been able\r\nsinct to make ary long loan.”\r\n\r\nAgain he laughed, and, the spirit of reminiscence being upon him, he\r\nwent on: “One time ’fore the war, the legislature ’p’inted a countin’\r\ncommittee, an’ ol’--oh, what’s ’is name?--you know--from Gallatin\r\nCounty--he ’as treasur’ then, an’ the’ wasn’ more’n about fifty\r\nthousan’ in the safe, but he ’as game, an’ when the committee ’peared\r\nnext mornin’, he says, ‘Cert’n’y, gentlemen,’ an’ handed ’em out about\r\nten thousan’ in them old green dollar bills, an’ says: ‘When yo’re done\r\ncountin’ o’ _them ’ere_, I’ll give you all some more.’ An’ in ’bout an\r\nhour they reckoned they’d take _his_ figur’s--they’d have to do.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby’s heart lightened, and he became almost gay, ordering much\r\ndrink. And for an hour the two men sat there, waiting and smoking, and\r\ndrinking whisky--Jennings bourbon and Grigsby rye--and were content.\r\nThough every time the yowl of a locomotive was borne to him on the\r\ncold, wet night, Grigsby jerked out his watch. And once he started at a\r\nshort knock on the door, but it was only Mendenhall.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight Grigsby’s anxiety deepened, and he ceased to pay\r\nattention to Jennings’ stories of politics down in “southern Eellinoy,”\r\nstories about Don Morrison and John A. Logan. At twelve-forty he rose\r\nand trod the floor, but Jennings’ long form was stretched out before\r\nthe fire, his whisky glass was at his elbow, and he said from time to\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n“Oh, fer God’s sake, Bill, set down--they’ll be ’long all right.”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that the Wabash?” said Grigsby, cocking his head at the night\r\ncry of a locomotive.\r\n\r\n“I don’ know,” said Jennings, who was growing mellow, “on’y whistles\r\nI could ever tell was them on the ol’ O. and M., ’ceptin’ o’ course,\r\nthe toot of the _Three States_, which is now at Cairo, ef she hain’t\r\nstuck on a mud bank over on the Mizzouri shore some’er’s ’round Bird’s\r\nLandin’.”\r\n\r\nGrigsby looked at his watch. It was ten minutes of one, and just as he\r\ndolefully announced the hour the door opened, and Hennessey entered,\r\ncarrying a leather traveling-bag. Grigsby leaped toward him, his\r\nitching fingers outstretched to seize the valise.\r\n\r\n“Is it all there?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Take me for a thief?” replied Hennessey, swinging the bag behind him.\r\n\r\nHennessey proffered the bag to his master, but Jennings said:\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute.” Then he ran his hand wrist-deep into his pocket and\r\ndrew out a paper, which he examined critically, squinting his eyes,\r\npartly to protect them from the smoke that curled up from a big\r\ndomestic cigar, partly--as it seemed, to assist in the concentration of\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Gineral,” he said--by some strange confusion of ideas, down in\r\nSpringfield they give the attorney-general a military title, which\r\ncustom that functionary fosters--“Gineral, will you give me your\r\nsignature to that, ’fore you start?”\r\n\r\nGrigsby glowered at Jennings, read the paper, said somewhat petulantly,\r\n“Oh, of course,” and hesitatingly signed it.\r\n\r\n“Now, Hennessey,” said Jennings, carefully placing the paper in a long\r\npocket-book he drew from the region of his left hip.\r\n\r\nHennessey held the bag out toward the secretary of state.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jennings, who was pouring himself a drink, “give it to the\r\ngineral.”\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general took the bag and opened it. Inside were four big\r\nbundles of bank bills. He lifted them out. Each bundle was composed of\r\nten smaller packages, held by rubber bands, and each package was bound\r\nwith a pink paper strap neatly pinned and marked “five hundred.” He\r\ncounted and replaced the packages in the bag. Then taking his coat and\r\nhat, he turned to Jennings and said:\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s be gone.”\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state rolled his head toward the attorney-general,\r\nwaved his long arm and flapped his hand fin-like at him, and said:\r\n\r\n“We’ll wait here, Mike and me. You won’t need us.”\r\n\r\nThe attorney-general scowled, and then went out, accompanied only by\r\nthe assistant state treasurer. Hurrying down Capitol Avenue, Grigsby\r\nshivered, glancing up dark alleys.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clock in the hall of the executive mansion had struck the half-hour\r\nafter midnight, and the governor was descending the stairs in a gray\r\nbath-robe and slippers. The old house was dark and still. Even the\r\nroom occupied by Gilman, who should, at that hour, have been reading\r\nthe magazines in bed, showed no light. The governor, softly treading,\r\nentered the library. The last embers of the fire were smouldering. The\r\ngovernor lighted the lamp, and in the circle of soft light it spread on\r\nthe library table, he bent over a book, his glasses on his nose, their\r\ncord hanging down into his lap. He turned the leaves of the book. It\r\nwas not _The Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius_. It was the second volume\r\nof _The Revised Statutes of Illinois_, a stupid work which many men\r\nconsult, laboriously, far into the night. He softly rustled over the\r\nleaves until he found chapter one hundred and thirty. He ran his finger\r\ndown the pages till it stopped at section sixteen. And then he read\r\nvery slowly: “In case of the death of the treasurer, it shall be the\r\nduty of the governor to take possession of the office of such treasurer\r\nand cause the vaults thereof to be closed and securely locked, and so\r\nremain until--” He read the words again, and again a third time, and\r\nyet again.\r\n\r\nHe closed the book, put out the lamp and slowly felt his way back up\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he descended again, and groping in the hall, drew a\r\ngreatcoat over his broad shoulders, covered his head with the slouch\r\nhat he wore when he went down into southern Illinois, and let himself\r\nout of the wide front door. The asphalt driveway that flings its long\r\ncurve through the grounds of the gubernatorial residence from Fifth\r\nStreet to Fourth, gleamed like the surface of a river at night. The\r\nrain no longer fell, but the trees dripped dismally. Across the low\r\nnight sky black clouds were flying. The governor walked down the\r\ndriveway to the big iron gates at Fourth Street, whose watered surface\r\nas far as he could see, wavered under the electric lights at the\r\ncrossings. The governor turned at Jackson Street and walked down the\r\nsleeping little avenue toward Second Street. Before a low brown house\r\ntrickling its eaves behind two sentinel cedars, he halted. He went up\r\nthe moist brick walk, and pulled the white bell-knob. The bell jangled\r\nharshly upon the sleeping stillness. The jangling trembled away. He\r\nrang again. There was a reluctant stir within and a voice, a scared\r\nwoman’s voice, said:\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“The governor,” he responded. “Is Mr. Mendenhall at home?”\r\n\r\nThe woman slid back bolts and opened the door circumspectly. She thrust\r\nout a towsled head and shoulders wrapped in a shawl. The governor heard\r\na baby’s cry. The woman’s teeth chattered with nervousness and the cold.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; he hasn’t got in yet.”\r\n\r\nThe governor thanked her and turned away. The woman opened the door\r\nwide and watched him as he retreated down the moist brick walk. At the\r\nstreet he paused. Then he turned on toward Second Street. The woman\r\nclosed the door, and her key grated in the lock.\r\n\r\nThe governor strode on into Second Street, past the residence of the\r\nBishop of Springfield, standing behind white pillars deep in its\r\nnaked grove, past St. Agatha’s Seminary sleeping in its gloom, until\r\nhe reached the state house. The brooding building loomed above him,\r\ndark and dour, heaving its great gray dome into the grim night. Huge\r\ngranite pillars lifted themselves above him, he was lost in the shades\r\nof the lofty portico. He unlocked and pushed open the heavy door. The\r\ngreat marble corridors were dark and echoed to the touch of his heel\r\nupon the stones. In the wide rotunda, under the enormous dome, thick\r\nwith billowing gloom, a janitor, the people’s solitary night watch,\r\nslept profoundly in his chair, his mouth open, his white beard upon his\r\nbreast. His gossips had departed. Their deserted chairs stood aimlessly\r\nabout. He had finished the nightly recital of the strenuous part he\r\nhad borne in the great rebellion, and he slumbered, his snores echoing\r\nin the monstrous inverted bowl above him. The governor ascended to\r\nthe floor above, and turned down the north corridor. A golden bar of\r\nlight was thrown across the marble floor. It streamed from the open\r\ndoor of the state treasury. The governor quickened his steps. He heard\r\nthe lunge of huge bolts as they were tumbled home. He heard the dull\r\nspin of a combination lock, and as he reached the treasury two men were\r\nemerging from the dark vaults.\r\n\r\n“Thank God, that’s--”\r\n\r\nThe sentence was lost in the mouth of the attorney-general of the state\r\nof Illinois, who stood with dropping jaw staring at the governor. The\r\nattorney-general stood motionless, and then plunged a hand with three\r\npieces of paper into an outer pocket of his overcoat. Mendenhall stood\r\nbehind him, a flame flashing over his face.\r\n\r\nThe governor was the first one to speak.\r\n\r\n“Good evening, gentlemen,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe two men did not reply, and the governor spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Under the law, gentlemen,” he said, “the duty devolves upon me of\r\nclosing and locking the treasury and temporarily assuming possession of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nStill the men did not reply. The tissues of Grigsby’s face had become\r\nflaccid, and a greenish shade had overspread them. His eyes had\r\ncontracted to sharp points under angry brows. The governor scrutinized\r\nthe two men closely, as he advanced, and said, speaking in a calm tone:\r\n\r\n“And so, if you gentlemen have concluded your business”--he paused--“I\r\nshall proceed to the execution of that duty.”\r\n\r\n“I am,” he added, a moment afterward, “perhaps fortunate in finding you\r\nhere, Mr. Mendenhall. You may be able to assist me.”\r\n\r\nHe drew toward them, and they stood aside. He entered the vaults where\r\na gas-jet glimmered, its light glinting on the nickel-plated knobs\r\nof the great steel doors. He tried the doors. They were locked. He\r\nremained an instant in thought, and then took from his pocket a stick\r\nof red sealing-wax. He hesitated another instant.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “the great seal could not be utilized.”\r\n\r\nThe great seal of state of the state of Illinois, though it has a\r\npolitical history, is, nevertheless, physically, but a huge overgrown\r\nseal such as notaries public use in their little businesses.\r\nAnd in Illinois the governor has no privy seal as he has in some\r\ncommonwealths. The governor warmed the sealing-wax in the gas-jet that\r\nblazed beside him in the vault. When it began to melt he dribbled and\r\ndaubed its softened substance, drop by drop, on the combination of the\r\nhuge safe, as a girl would seal a letter. When he had quite covered\r\nthe lock with the molten wax, he sealed it with the seal ring he wore\r\non his left hand, a ring which bore the coat-of-arms of a colonial\r\ngovernor. The midnight secret of those two men, whatever it might be,\r\nwas either safe with them or more safely still, sealed with other\r\nsecrets behind those massive doors. And then he turned the gas down\r\nuntil only a tiny star blinked in the vault, and came out, and swung\r\ntogether the big steel gates that clanked like prison bars, their locks\r\nsnapping automatically.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the outer door of the department and placed his hand\r\nupon the knob.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said ceremoniously, “I await your pleasure.”\r\n\r\nHe bent his gaze full upon William Grigsby, and that little man,\r\nthrowing back his head with something like defiance, strode on his\r\nshort legs out of the high-ceiled room, and Mendenhall followed him,\r\nbut meekly. As they filed past, Grigsby, with face upturned, a face\r\nthat now in anger had taken on the blue tinge of butchered beef, drew\r\nhis hands from his overcoat pocket and clasped them behind his back.\r\nThe governor bowed as the little man and Mendenhall swept out before\r\nhim. And then he drew the big walnut door to.\r\n\r\nStanding out in the corridor Grigsby waited, and as he stood and\r\nwaited, he fumbled in the outer pocket of his overcoat. Suddenly he\r\ndrew forth his hand. His face had turned white, the white of a fish’s\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nAs the governor drew the big walnut door to, and as it swung behind\r\nhim, it pushed before it, scraping with the peevish voice of a ratchet\r\nalong the matted floor, a piece of crumpled paper. Grigsby, who had\r\nturned toward Mendenhall with a look of death’s despair, saw it, and\r\nstarted, a faint ray of hope beaming in his eye. But the paper lay\r\nunder the governor’s feet.\r\n\r\nThe governor closed the doors.\r\n\r\n“You may lock them, Mr. Mendenhall,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe assistant state treasurer drew a jingling bunch of keys from\r\nhis pocket and locked the door. Grigsby’s eyes were fastened on the\r\npaper at the governor’s feet. His heart was swelling in his throat.\r\nHis fingers were twitching, and he was sweating like a stoker. At\r\nMendenhall’s approach the governor placed his foot upon the paper. When\r\nMendenhall had done, the governor picked it up. He smoothed it out in\r\nhis fingers, and slowly adjusted his glasses. By the dim light that\r\nalways burns at night just outside the door of the state treasury he\r\nread it. Then he placed it in the pocket of his overcoat. He kept his\r\nhand upon it. The blue of Grigsby’s face deepened.\r\n\r\nThe three men went down the stairs, the governor standing aside at\r\nthe top to let them precede him. They crossed the rotunda, past the\r\nslumbering janitor whose snores ascended and exploded in the rounded\r\nblackness of the hollow dome, down the east corridor and so out into\r\nthe darkness. They walked together down the wide stone walk, the stone\r\nwalk as wide as a street, that sweeps, with a strip of sward down its\r\nmiddle, across the state house lawns to Capitol Avenue. The governor\r\ndid not turn up Second Street by the way he had come. He kept on with\r\nhis two companions, and all three were silent. Not a word had any one\r\nof them spoken. They were drowned in thought. It matters not of what\r\nthe assistant state treasurer was thinking. He held only an appointive\r\noffice. He was a political villain, and had a collar on his neck. The\r\nattorney-general was thinking of days that were to come. The governor\r\nwas thinking of days that were gone. Silent, thoughtful, thus they kept\r\non up Capitol Avenue. When they approached the shades that gathered\r\nunder the ugly iron bridge which spans the ragged street that leads to\r\nthe capitol of Illinois, the Alton’s St. Louis Limited came plunging\r\nthrough the town, half an hour late. The three men halted. The great\r\nmysterious, vestibuled train, with its darkly curtained Pullmans, slid\r\nacross the bridge. As they stood waiting for it to pass that they might\r\ngo under, the governor withdrew his hand from his pocket, the paper\r\nstill folded in it. He held the paper out toward Grigsby.\r\n\r\n“William,” he said, “I think you dropped something.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL’S LAST CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nAll day long Colonel Talbott sat in his leather chair in the lobby of\r\nthe Grand, twiddling his cane, smoking his cigar, and talking politics.\r\nUnder the broad brim of his black slouch hat his hair fell in silver\r\nwisps almost to his shoulders, and the long mustache, drooping like a\r\nGeorgian’s at the corners of his mouth, was as white as his hair, save\r\nat the spot where his cigar had tinged it yellow.\r\n\r\nThere was not a politician of either party between Dunleith and Cairo\r\nwho was not proud to bend over the old fellow’s chair, take his thin\r\nhand and say: “Hello, Colonel, what’s new in politics?” The colonel had\r\none invariable reply: “I’m out of politics, and don’t know anything.\r\nWhat do you hear?” Sometimes, if the passing politician happened to be\r\nof the old day, the colonel would take him by the arm, and they would\r\nsaunter away to the bar. If the politician came from northern Illinois,\r\nthe colonel would take rye; if from southern Illinois the colonel would\r\ntake bourbon; such was his idea of etiquette. Though never would he\r\ntake a drink before breakfast, for a drink before breakfast, he told\r\nCarroll, was a back log in the fire that would burn the live-long day.\r\n\r\nCarroll was the staff of the colonel’s old age. The two would sit by\r\nthe hour, while the old man talked of the Nineteenth Illinois Cavalry,\r\nof Lincoln and Douglas, of David Davis and Elijah Haines, of state\r\nand national conventions, in the days when he had made and unmade\r\ncongressmen, governors and senators, ruling his party in the state,\r\nCarroll shrewdly thought, with a discipline as rigid as that with which\r\nhe had welded the Nineteenth Illinois into a fighting regiment.\r\n\r\nTo those who knew the veteran’s history, his love for the boy was\r\ntouching. The story is too long to tell now, but its essential motif\r\nmust always be the ingratitude of Si Warren. The colonel had picked\r\nWarren up in the old Fifteenth District, sent him to Congress, and\r\nfinally made a United States senator of him. Warren, developing\r\nquickly as a politician, had turned around, defeated the colonel for\r\nreëlection as chairman of the state executive committee, a position he\r\nhad held for sixteen years, had frozen him out of the Arizona deal, and\r\nsomehow caused the colonel’s only son to go wrong out there in Tucson.\r\nThe boy’s mother had died; of a broken heart, they said. Since then a\r\ndecade had passed, a decade which the colonel had spent in the grim\r\nlonesomeness of a crowded hotel. He never mentioned Warren’s name. If\r\nhe heard it, he clenched his bony fists so tightly that the knuckles\r\nshowed white. Once a year, perhaps, in the springtime, when the state\r\ncentral committee met, he got out his white waistcoat and was invited\r\nup to the ordinary to make a speech on the state of the party, and once\r\na year, in the summertime, he attended a reunion of his regiment, now\r\ndecimated to a squadron of tottering old men, whom the colonel called\r\n“boys.”\r\n\r\nSpring came, rolling up from the muddy Ohio, showering its apple\r\nblossoms in the orchards of Egypt, sprinkling with purple flowers the\r\nprairies of central Illinois, and finally flooding with tardy sunshine\r\nthe cold waters of Lake Michigan. It was the year the legislature\r\nthat chose Warren’s successor in the senate was to be elected, and\r\nwhen the senator came home from Washington he found his fences in sad\r\nrepair. The Silas Warren of the parlor suite in a Lake Front hotel\r\nwas not the Si Warren whom Colonel Talbott had rescued from the dusty\r\nlittle law office down in Shelbyville fifteen years before. The clothes\r\nof that time were faded by the sun in which he loafed all day on the\r\npost-office corner, whereas the clothes of this spring morning bespoke\r\na New York tailor and a valet.\r\n\r\nThe senator was not in a pleasant mood. There was opposition to\r\nhis reëlection, and while his machine ignored it, and while George\r\nR. Baldwin, the lawyer who watched the interests of certain big\r\ncorporations during the sessions of the legislature, said it was but\r\na sporadic demonstration of soreheads, back-numbers and labor skates,\r\nit was spreading, as the picturesque politicians from the corn lands\r\nof central Illinois would say, like a prairie fire. Jacksonville,\r\nwhere the standard of revolt had first been raised, was in Morgan,\r\nthe colonel’s home county, and so it came to pass that the defection\r\nwas laid to the machinations of the colonel himself. And yet, as the\r\npoliticians who were always dropping into Chicago to correct their\r\nreckonings, paused an instant by the leather chair, the old white head\r\nwould slowly wag from side to side, and the old man would say:\r\n\r\n“No, I’m out of politics.”\r\n\r\nIf Carroll had not conceived the idea of running for office, perhaps\r\nthe colonel would have remained out of politics, but the boy, after a\r\nweek of dreaming, dramatized himself as making a speech in the state\r\nsenate chamber at Springfield. The colonel, as a man’s duty is, advised\r\nhim to keep out of politics, and yet within an hour after Carroll shyly\r\nconfessed his ambition, the fever awoke in the old fellow’s bones, his\r\neyes flamed with the old fire, and he admitted that the experience\r\nmight help a boy who was struggling in a pitiless city for a law\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nWithin a week the colonel had introduced Carroll to Superintendent of\r\nStreet and Alley Cleaning Patrick F. Gibbons, who promised to be with\r\nhim, and had taken him to the city hall for an audience with the mayor.\r\nAfter that the newspapers said that John D. Carroll had been slated for\r\nthe senatorial nomination in the First District.\r\n\r\nWhen Warren learned of the colonel’s new interest in the campaign, he\r\ncunningly decided to utilize it by throwing his strength to Carroll\r\nin the First, provided the colonel would withdraw his opposition. He\r\nprided himself on being a man who harbored no resentments. So he sent\r\nDan Ford, his private secretary, to open negotiations for peace.\r\n\r\nThe colonel had recognized the coming of the heat by donning his suit\r\nof linen, with a red tie at his throat to give the touch of color\r\nhe always loved, and he had got out his broad-leaved Panama hat for\r\nits fifteenth season. Ford found him seated in the leather chair,\r\nswinging one thin leg over the other, his white hose wrinkling over\r\nhis low shoes, telling Carroll how Grant came to Springfield from\r\nGalena seeking a commission in the army. Ford diplomatically broached\r\nthe subject of a conference between the colonel and the senator.\r\nThe colonel heard him to the end, but said nothing. His mustache\r\nsimply lifted a little with the curl of his lip. Ford was evidently\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n“Have you any reply?” he asked, “or any message?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the colonel, and his gray eyes flashed under their shaggy\r\nbrows. “Present my compliments to Senator Warren, and tell him that if\r\nhe ever presumes to speak to me again in all his life, I’ll slap his\r\nface, and if he resents it, I’ll kill him.”\r\n\r\nFord tried to bow, and the colonel, turning to Carroll, said:\r\n\r\n“As I was saying, General Palmer happened to go into the\r\nadjutant-general’s office and saw Grant smoking a corn-cob pipe and\r\nworking away on muster rolls at a broken table propped up in one corner\r\nof the room. The old forage cap he had worn in the Mexican War was\r\nlying on the table. It was the only hat he had in those days.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning an interview with Warren appeared in all the papers.\r\n\r\n“I would prefer,” the senator was reported as saying, “to retire to\r\nprivate life and resume my interrupted law practice, if I were not\r\ncompelled to seek vindication by the bushwhacking of this doting old\r\ningrate, who, disappointed in his attempts to monopolize patronage that\r\nbelongs to patriotic party workers, now skulks behind the sympathy his\r\nyears and infirmities excite, to wage a guerrilla warfare.”\r\n\r\nThe colonel read the interview at breakfast. He sat at the table with\r\none paper propped up before him and four others beside his plate, his\r\neye-glasses on his nose, and ate his oatmeal and his beefsteak and his\r\nboiled eggs just as he did on every morning of the year. Then he drank\r\nthe half cup of coffee that he always reserved, with its cream slowly\r\ncoagulating at the surface, for the end of his meal, because it was\r\ncooler then, laid his napkin down and shuffled slowly out.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later a man stopped by his chair in the lobby and said\r\nsomething to the colonel that made him drop his paper, and look up over\r\nhis eye-glasses with a scowl. The man was known as Birdy Quinn, and he\r\nhad lost his job in the water office the week before, because Warren\r\nwished to make room for a fellow who could deliver more votes at the\r\ncoming primaries than Birdy could.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” the colonel asked.\r\n\r\n“Sure! Isn’t it all over the ward this morning?”\r\n\r\n“You’re sure that Pat Gibbons consented to run as Warren’s candidate\r\nfor state senator in the First District against Carroll--after\r\npromising me--_me_?” He bent his brows angrily and pointed with a long\r\nforefinger at his own breast.\r\n\r\n“Well, hell’s bells!” said Quinn. “Wasn’t Baldwin working with him half\r\nthe night?”\r\n\r\nThe colonel took his glasses from his nose and swinging them by their\r\nheavy cord, blinked with his old eyes at the square of sunlight blazing\r\nin the Clark Street entrance, across which, as on a vividly illuminated\r\nscreen, the crowds on the sidewalk flitted like trembling figures in\r\na kinetoscope. Presently he lifted himself heavily from his chair and\r\ngathered up his newspapers and his stick.\r\n\r\n“Well, Birdy,” he said wearily, “I guess I’ve got one more fight left\r\nin me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMost men thought it was Warren’s interview that caused the colonel to\r\nconsent at last to lead the opposition against him, though some said it\r\nwas but the fascination of politics, which is like the fascination of\r\nthe sea, so that a man who follows it once must follow it till he dies.\r\n\r\n“I never thought I’d live to see the day when I’d be glad to find the\r\nold man’s chair empty,” said Eph Harkness, of Macoupin, that afternoon.\r\nHe had come up from Carlinville in response to a telegram from the\r\ncolonel, and having registered, and given his bag and linen duster to\r\na bell-boy, was removing his big felt hat to mop his wet brow.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid he won’t be able to stand the strain of a campaign,” said\r\nCarroll.\r\n\r\n“Stand the strain! Him?” exclaimed Harkness. “Why, he’ll be alive and\r\ndrawing pay when they’re referring to Si Warren as ex-senator!”\r\n\r\n“I hate to have them say such mean things about him,” Carroll\r\npersisted, thinking of the interview.\r\n\r\n“If they think they kin say any meaner things ’bout him than he kin\r\n’bout them, jes’ let ’em lam in,” chuckled Mosely, of Alexander.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” mused Harkness, “it’ll be the greatest fight we’ve had in\r\nIllinois since Logan’s time. We’ve got a leader now.”\r\n\r\nThere was an echo of the old days in his voice, which, with its gentle\r\nhint of regret, was lost on Carroll, who had not known the colonel in\r\nthe old days.\r\n\r\nThey found the colonel in his room, sitting by an open window, his\r\nPanama hat on his head, his cigar in his teeth, and his walking-stick\r\ntwirling in his long fingers. The room did not present that orderly\r\nand cool appearance it had on the few occasions when Carroll had been\r\nin it before. The shades were high at the window, admitting flames of\r\nheat, wads of crumpled paper bestrewed the floor, a huge table had been\r\nbrought in and it was already littered with newspapers and telegraph\r\nblanks. The bureau had been moved, the tall white door it had hidden\r\nso long had been unlocked, and Carroll heard the incessant clicking\r\nof a typewriter in the adjoining room. Two or three men sat idly\r\nabout, gossiping, as men will, about political battles of the past.\r\nThere seemed to be none of the industry of politics apparent, though\r\npolitical headquarters seldom do display that, perhaps because a good\r\npart of the industry of politics consists in talking and smoking and\r\ndrinking, and partly, perhaps, because of the necessity of concealment\r\nthat always exists. These men were gathered to organize the defeat of a\r\ncrafty and unscrupulous man who had a national, state and city machine\r\nat his command, with money to heart’s desire, and yet they sat and\r\nsmoked, stirring only when a telegram came from down the state, or some\r\nlong-forgotten politician came in to offer himself as a recruit.\r\n\r\nFor a month the colonel did not go out of the hotel. He was up early\r\nand at work, his cigar in his mouth, dictating letters, sending\r\ntelegrams, receiving callers. When he slept, no one knew. He never had\r\nhis hat off. He ate his meals from a tray in his room, after the food\r\nhad grown cold. His headquarters recalled pathetically the old days\r\nwhen his power and supremacy were unquestioned. They were crowded day\r\nand night with the back-numbers and the soreheads Baldwin had talked\r\nabout, who came with their grievances, their impossible schemes, their\r\npaltry ambitions. Of such stuff the colonel had to make his machine,\r\nflattering, threatening, wheedling, soothing jealousies, reconciling\r\ndiscordant factions, healing old animosities, inflaming new hatreds,\r\nkeeping up spirit in faint hearts, leaving not a wire unpulled. He\r\nappointed a steering committee, on which were Mosely, of Alexander;\r\nGarwood, of Kankakee; Harkness, of Macoupin, and Malachi Nolan; he\r\nwrote personal letters to old friends in every school district in the\r\nstate, and thus, slowly, patiently, laboriously welded his organization\r\ntogether. What he most needed was funds, and a candidate to provide\r\nfunds; lacking them, he insisted that this was not a movement for\r\nthe profit of any one man, but for the good of the party alone, and\r\nso invested it with the enthusiasm of what passes for patriotism in a\r\nnation where party is set above country. He told the landlord of the\r\nGrand that he would be responsible for the rent of the two rooms he had\r\nengaged next his own. He already owed the landlord.\r\n\r\nThe night before the primaries a crowd, foul with the reek of tobacco,\r\nalcohol and perspiration, was shuffling about in the hall and anterooms\r\nof the colonel’s headquarters. The crowd was noisy, profane and\r\nconfident. But inside, the steering committee was assembled, and it was\r\nvery sober. Garwood, at the littered table, had been scratching his\r\nhead over political equations.\r\n\r\nConventions had been held in all the thirty-six outside districts, and\r\nsixty-nine candidates had been nominated, fifty-five representatives\r\nand fourteen senators. Of these they could depend upon twenty-nine.\r\nIt requires fifty-two to control a legislative caucus, when the party\r\nhas a bare majority on joint ballot, so they would have to nominate at\r\nleast twenty-three of their candidates in Cook County to get a caucus\r\nmajority, assuming the ultimate election of them all. Fifty-seven\r\ncandidates were to be selected in Cook County on the morrow. Of them,\r\nthey should name at least thirty-five to be entirely safe. In other\r\nwords, they must carry Cook County.\r\n\r\n“Is that countin’ hold-over senators?” asked Mosely, when Garwood was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, counting the hold-overs--Warren claims fourteen out of the\r\nseventeen.”\r\n\r\n“Josh Badger never’ll vote for him,” said Mosely.\r\n\r\n“He gives us Josh,” Garwood replied. “Bates and Halliday are uncertain.”\r\n\r\n“Not so damned uncertain,” said Mosely. “They’re only waitin’ to be\r\nseen.”\r\n\r\n“Warren’ll get them easy enough,” said Harkness.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they’re cheap,” Mosely assented, spitting across the room at an\r\niron cuspidor. “’Bout eight dollars apiece, I’d guess ’em off at,” he\r\nadded, with a poor man’s contempt for low prices.\r\n\r\n“Well, that only makes it worse,” replied Garwood. “But leave them out\r\nentirely. With sixty-two votes Warren can control the caucus--”\r\n\r\n“Providin’ al’ays, however,” suggested Mosely, in statutory language.\r\n\r\n“Oh, course,” assented Garwood, petulant from the heat and the\r\nsituation, “they won’t all be elected. That’s why he’ll work like hell\r\nto carry Cook. He lies when he says he doesn’t give a damn how she goes\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“He always does that,” said the colonel, from his bed.\r\n\r\nCarroll, to whom political calculations savored always of the mystery\r\nof higher mathematics, said:\r\n\r\n“Seems to me you could figure it better than that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you try it,” said Garwood, dropping his pencil and tilting back\r\nin his chair.\r\n\r\nThere was not much hope, and the soberness deepened. After a while\r\nthere was a knock on the door, and a shaven head was thrust in.\r\n\r\n“Them lit’ry guys is out here,” said the shaven head. “Any figur’s to\r\ngive out?”\r\n\r\n“Figur’s?” cried Mosely. “We’ve got th’ official vote!”\r\n\r\nAnd Garwood, taking his papers from the table, went out and said to the\r\nreporters:\r\n\r\n“Conventions have been held in all the senatorial districts down the\r\nstate, and sixty-nine candidates are already nominated. Of these\r\nsixty-nine, we have beyond any question”--he consulted his paper, as\r\nif to make sure of the number--“we have fifty-three, and that doesn’t\r\ninclude the nine hold-over senators who are with us. We can lose ten of\r\nthem at the polls and still have enough to control the caucus. In Cook\r\nCounty, to-morrow, we’ll carry the First, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth,\r\nEleventh, Seventeenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-third and the\r\ncountry towns--the Seventh--giving us thirty-five more candidates, or\r\nninety-seven in all. This is a conservative estimate, and gives the\r\ndoubtful districts to Warren. We can lose Cook to-morrow and still have\r\na fighting chance to win out. I regard the battle as ours. Senator\r\nWarren is defeated.”\r\n\r\n“Over at the Richelieu,” said Cowley, of the _News-Despatch_, “Baldwin\r\nclaims they have you whipped to a standstill.”\r\n\r\n“They’re welcome over there to any comfort they can get out of the\r\nsituation,” said Garwood in a superior way.\r\n\r\nIt rained on the day of the primaries. All morning politicians, big\r\nand little, stamped into Senator Warren’s hotel on Michigan Avenue, or\r\nstamped into the Grand, tracking with greasy mud the muslin that had\r\nbeen stretched over the carpet in Colonel Talbott’s headquarters. The\r\npolls were to open at one o’clock. The colonel had risen early, after\r\nthree hours’ sleep, and snatched his breakfast from a tray, talking\r\nto Carroll between bites. All morning he was buttonholed by men who\r\nscuffled for a word, complaining that Warren’s fellows would have money\r\nto burn, and he fought with them, bill by bill, for the few dollars he\r\nhad in his pocket. He was only liberal, to the extent that his slender\r\ncampaign funds permitted liberality, with those who were to work in\r\nCarroll’s district. As the day wore on and he received reports and\r\ndespatched orders, like a general fighting a battle, the colonel’s\r\nspirits rose, and the politicians, when he ordered them sharply about,\r\npaused at the door to look back at him, pleased by the thought that\r\nthis was the Colonel Talbott of the good old days.\r\n\r\nIt was a wicked battle they fought out at the polls that day. The\r\nWarren men had control of the party organization and named the judges\r\nand clerks. Inmates of lodging houses, and Lake Front hoboes, their\r\nrags steaming in the warm rain, were hauled from poll to poll in\r\nbig moving vans, and voted wherever Warren needed votes and as often\r\nas he pleased. The city hall took a hand and furnished policemen\r\nin larger numbers than the primary election law intended, so that\r\nwhenever an anti-Warren challenger challenged a vote he was hustled\r\nby officers, and if he resisted, bundled off to the Harrison Street\r\npolice station and locked up on a charge of disturbance. Late in the\r\nafternoon reports coming from Halsted Street that the Fifth Ward was\r\nin danger, the colonel escaped from his headquarters and went into the\r\ntrenches himself. Carroll never forgot the old man as he splashed from\r\npoll to poll that waning summer day, or stood in the drenching rain\r\nbefore a voting booth, waving back policemen, ordering men up to vote,\r\nthreatening judges and clerks. He had never heard the old man swear\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock the polls closed. Warren carried some of the\r\ndistricts, the opposition others. Both claimed the victory. It was left\r\nfor the convention to decide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe colonel, for some reason, preferred not to get up the next\r\nmorning, but opened his mail, read his papers, ate his breakfast, and\r\nfinally held his morning levee, the last of the campaign, in bed. The\r\npoliticians who had been waiting outside for an hour, grumbled at such\r\nindolence, and, when they were finally admitted to their leader’s\r\npresence, suspected him of imitating the undemocratic luxuriousness of\r\nSenator Warren, who received his callers in bed every morning. But by\r\nnine o’clock they had received their final instructions and scattered\r\nto the conventions, and when Mosely and Garwood sauntered in from the\r\nbreakfast-room, they found only a few stragglers, who lingered on in\r\nthe hope of beer money, at least, for their imaginary services on this\r\ndecisive day. Malachi Nolan, in black garments and white cravat, came\r\npresently, his big diamond flashing, his face shining and red from his\r\ndull razor, and then Carroll, at the sound of whose young step and\r\nfresh laugh the colonel succeeded in evoking a wan, tired smile.\r\n\r\n“Just lazy, that’s all,” he declared reassuringly, seeing Carroll halt\r\nin surprise. He reared himself on his elbow, and as he raised his head,\r\nits white hair all tangled, Carroll saw how haggard he was. He never\r\nhad seen him look so old, so white, so worn, before.\r\n\r\n“I was waiting for you,” said the colonel, indicating Nolan with a\r\nfinger that was like a claw. “I’ve fixed everything but the First\r\nDistrict.” He paused for breath. “The First Ward’s solid, isn’t it?\r\nWell, all right. But watch Donahue. I’m sorry we ever let him get\r\non the delegation. And then, let’s see”--he pressed his brow in a\r\ntroubled effort to steady his senses--“oh, yes. See McGlynn and have\r\nhim lay down on Hardy, and tell Reinhold that if he wants that job from\r\nthe South Park board he’d better get in line, and as to Wright--his\r\nbrother’s a conductor on the Cottage Grove line, and you can get at him\r\nthrough Harlow. Tell him I sent you. That’ll give you thirty-five votes\r\non the first ballot, and--”\r\n\r\nCarroll, who had turned to reply to some jest of Mosely’s, heard a\r\ngroan. Instantly he looked back at the colonel. The old politician,\r\nhis face livid, was struggling as if he wished to get out of bed. He\r\nwrithed a moment, then his head nodded, his chin dropped to his breast,\r\nand he collapsed in a heap, among the tumbled bedclothes. Carroll paled\r\nwith a sudden sickness.\r\n\r\n“He’s fainted,” said Garwood, fumbling at the throat of the colonel’s\r\nshirt. Malachi Nolan brought a cup of water, Mosely hunted impatiently\r\nfor a flask of whisky, and when they had straightened him out upon his\r\npillows, Carroll ran for the hotel physician. The colonel recovered\r\nconsciousness before the physician came and glanced around with an\r\nexpression of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n“Damn such a heart, anyway,” he said. Then young Doctor Lambert\r\ncame with his new stethoscope. When the doctor had finished his\r\nauscultation, the colonel said:\r\n\r\n“Malachi, vote your delegation solid every time--don’t give\r\ncomplimentary votes--it’s dangerous. And remember--I don’t care what\r\nhappens so long as Carroll’s nominated, trade anything, everything for\r\nthat, and send me word--”\r\n\r\nBut they hushed him.\r\n\r\nAt noon Doctor Foerder, the specialist, arrived.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Lambert,” he said, scowling about him as he put down his\r\ntremendous leather valise, big with the mysterious contrivances of\r\nmodern surgery, pulled off his gloves, and with his quick, professional\r\ntread, stepped to the bedside. He exposed the colonel’s big chest,\r\nand began a delicate percussion with his white fingers. When he had\r\ndone tapping, he laid his ear over the colonel’s heart, and listened\r\nsilently a long time to the cardiac murmurs, he rolled under his\r\nfingers the superficial vessels of the temples, the forearms, the\r\nwrists, the knees, he counted the pulse; and he looked long at the old\r\nman’s finger-nails. When he paused, the colonel said:\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nDoctor Foerder had retreated from the bedside and was writing his\r\ndirections precisely, logically, as an official draws up a report,\r\nbeginning each paragraph with a Roman numeral. He did not answer the\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\nFoerder briefly consulted with Lambert, that is, repeated the\r\ndirections he had already written out, and began to buckle his big\r\nvalise.\r\n\r\n“And as to a nurse?” asked Doctor Lambert.\r\n\r\n“I’ll send one of my own,” said Foerder, hastily lighting a Russian\r\ncigarette. He could not remain long in one place. He had patients to\r\nsee and a lecture to deliver over at Rush Medical College and his man\r\nwas waiting with his high-hooded phaeton down in Jackson Boulevard.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, diffusing a faint odor of antiseptics, came from Doctor\r\nFoerder’s private hospital, laid aside her bonnet and veil and pausing\r\nan instant to give a woman’s touch to her hair, quietly and deftly set\r\nthe room in order.\r\n\r\nAll that afternoon the colonel lay in his darkened bedroom, fighting\r\nthe battle of his life. He lay so still that the nurse almost fancied\r\nhim asleep, so regular was his breathing. Once he broke the silence by\r\nasking the time.\r\n\r\n“Twenty minutes after three,” the nurse responded, glancing at her\r\nlittle watch.\r\n\r\n“Some of the conventions, then,” the colonel said, “are over. I wonder\r\nwhy they don’t send me word.”\r\n\r\nThe nurse did not notice his speech, and he added:\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, you doubtless are not interested in politics.”\r\n\r\nThe talking brought on a spasm of dyspnœa, and the colonel struggled so\r\npainfully for his breath that the nurse had to prop him up with pillows\r\nin a sitting posture, as those who are afflicted with asthma pass their\r\nnights, finding it easier thus to breathe. The colonel begged the\r\nnurse’s pardon, as if he had committed some indelicacy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time news was brought from the Fifth District convention in\r\nArlington Hall and from the Sixth in Jung’s Hall, that the Warren men\r\nhad carried both districts. The colonel, hearing the hoarse whispering\r\nbetween the messengers and Mosely in the room outside, demanded\r\ninformation, and Doctor Lambert had to tell him. The colonel wished\r\nto see Mosely, he had some new plan for the West Side to offset their\r\nloss; and he saw Mosely and the plan was put in execution. Then the\r\ncolonel seemed once more to sleep. When he opened his eyes he asked if\r\nhe could not have a cigar--“seegar,” he pronounced it--assuring the\r\nnurse that he felt much better, but she said, as one might say to the\r\nwhim of a child to whom explanations are not vouchsafed:\r\n\r\n“Not just now.”\r\n\r\nAnd there was silence again, and the ticking of the nurse’s little\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\nBy four o’clock the colonel became restless once more, and asked if\r\nthere were any news. When the nurse said no, he insisted that there\r\nmust be some message, some letter, some telegram. He did not know that\r\nhis followers, vindicating all history, were now standing afar off. He\r\nworried and grew incoherent. He seemed to confuse Carroll with the boy\r\nwho was sleeping under the stars far away in Arizona.\r\n\r\nDoctor Foerder returned at four o’clock. He had not been expected\r\nbefore evening, but he was interested in the case. He had mentioned it\r\nin his lecture that day. He had commented on the wonderful display of\r\nvitality on the patient’s part, and spoken of the value in such cases\r\nof moral treatment, of encouraging words and a confident manner. He\r\nread the nurse’s chart, counted the colonel’s pulse for fifteen seconds\r\nand calculated the rate by multiplication, drew down the old man’s\r\neyelids, noting the senile arc that was whitening the periphery of the\r\ncornea, and he examined the finger-nails; then the percussion and the\r\nauscultation. When he raised his black head, the colonel said:\r\n\r\n“Any news?”\r\n\r\n“You’re doing well.”\r\n\r\n“Aw!” said the colonel impatiently, “I don’t mean that--any news from\r\nthe conventions?”\r\n\r\nFoerder hesitated, as if half reluctant to display interest in anything\r\nso human, but said:\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What?” said the colonel eagerly, his eyes brightening with a light\r\nthat alarmed the doctor.\r\n\r\n“They say you’ve carried some districts on the North Side.”\r\n\r\n“Which ones?” asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Don’t remember.”\r\n\r\n“Anything else?”\r\n\r\n“Well, they say Warner has carried some North Side districts, too--and\r\nsome West Side districts.”\r\n\r\n“Warner?”\r\n\r\n“Well, whatever his name is.”\r\n\r\nThen Foerder was silent, and the colonel lay a long time thinking.\r\n\r\n“Did you learn how it’s going in the Ninth, or the Second, or the\r\nSeventeenth?”\r\n\r\n“They say it’s about an even break everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“And how’s the First?” The colonel put this question in a whisper, as\r\nif he feared the answer. The doctor did not know. Then the silence\r\nagain, and the colonel’s labored breathing, and the ticking of the\r\nnurse’s little gold watch.\r\n\r\n“What district do you live in, Doctor?” the colonel asked later.\r\n\r\n“I?” replied the medical man in some surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I--why, I don’t know,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe colonel faintly smiled. “Where do you live, then?”\r\n\r\n“In Drexel Boulevard.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the Fifth,” the colonel said. “Warren carried that.”\r\n\r\n“Did he?” The doctor looked as if he were ashamed. “We mustn’t talk any\r\nmore just now.”\r\n\r\nFoerder remained until evening, pacing the anteroom, his hands behind\r\nhim, his lips twitching in his involuntary smile. Now and then he\r\ntook a turn in the long, dark, softly carpeted hall, to smoke a\r\ncigarette. At times some politician would come with a scared face and\r\ninquire about the colonel, and the doctor always demanded news of the\r\nbattle, before he answered the questions. The reports brought by the\r\npoliticians were not encouraging, and they hurried outside again. Their\r\nvisits, as the afternoon waned, became fewer. Even Mosely and Garwood\r\nhad been glad of the exciting excuse offered by the First District\r\nconvention in Italia Hall down Clark Street to escape from the shadowed\r\nheadquarters. At six o’clock no one had been there for an hour, save\r\nsome sympathetic bell-boys and porters from down-stairs, and Carroll,\r\nof course--he came every half-hour from the convention, disheveled,\r\nbathed in perspiration, his eyes burning with excitement and suspense.\r\nFoerder would not allow him to see the colonel, who lay behind the\r\nwhite door, his eyes half closed, too weak any longer to whisper.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock the reporters came, and Doctor Foerder, as they put\r\nit, issued a bulletin.\r\n\r\n“He’s alive,” the doctor said, “pulse 120 to 124, respiration 22 to 26,\r\ntemperature 98. His remarkable nerve alone sustains him. He’s making\r\nthe most magnificent fight I ever saw in all my life--have you heard\r\nanything from the convention?”\r\n\r\n“They’re all over but the one in the First District,” one of the\r\nreporters said, while they scribbled down the physician’s figures. “It\r\nall depends now upon what that does. It’s the worst fight ever known in\r\nChicago. They say Warren has spent twenty-five thousand to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Does it look as if he could be elected there--in the First, you know?”\r\n\r\nThe reporters smiled and winked one at another.\r\n\r\nThe colonel lay like one asleep, until far along in the evening. Once\r\nor twice he opened his eyes and looked an inquiry into the doctor’s\r\neyes, but Foerder could only shake his head. And once or twice he\r\nmuttered something about Baldwin, and was troubled that they could not\r\nunderstand. Then he sank into a state of coma, and the news for which\r\nall were waiting would not come.\r\n\r\nDoctor Foerder was for ever glancing at his watch and asking Lambert\r\nhow he thought the First District convention would turn out. Lambert\r\nhad no idea.\r\n\r\n“I hope we’ll win,” Foerder would say. Finally he sent Lambert down\r\nfor news. Lambert hurried back. They had taken forty-six ballots, he\r\nsaid, and the vote was tied. At ten o’clock Doctor Foerder examined\r\nthe colonel again, examined his eyes, his finger-nails, drummed on his\r\nchest, listened to his heart.\r\n\r\n“You’re magnificent!” he could not refrain from whispering, but his\r\npatient did not answer or look, or even smile this time. He was growing\r\nvery weak. His breathing was faint, he inhaled the air through livid\r\nlips. He did not arouse from his stupor.\r\n\r\nDoctor Foerder got very impatient. “We can’t wait much longer,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s all we can do, now,” said Lambert.\r\n\r\nFoerder went outside. The anteroom was deserted. The politicians came\r\nno more. He would sit down, then instantly get up, walk back and\r\nforth; his eyebrows knitting in his scowl, his lips twitching in that\r\nmirthless smile. And he smoked cigarette after cigarette. He did this\r\nfor an hour.\r\n\r\nAlong toward midnight he heard a step. Flying to the door, he saw\r\nCarroll, dragging down the hall with the step of defeat and exhaustion.\r\nThe boy’s hair was matted under his hat, his eyes were dull, sunken,\r\nblack as night.\r\n\r\n“Licked,” he said, waving his hands with a gesture of despair, as if\r\nthe world had come to an end. Foerder went inside, leaving Carroll to\r\nsink into the first chair. But a moment later the physician opened the\r\nwhite door, and beckoned with his head. The motion was conclusive,\r\nfinal. He held the door ajar, and Carroll entered. The useless drugs\r\nhad been pushed aside. The room was filled with the strange silence,\r\nthe odor of death. Lambert stood at the window, looking out into the\r\ndarkness. The nurse stood by the bed, waiting to perform her last\r\noffice for the dying man.\r\n\r\nCarroll timidly approached and looked down at the long form, scarcely\r\noutlined by the sheet, at the rigid head, at the great, waxen brow,\r\nat the little blue spheres formed by the closed eyelids, at the mouth\r\nslightly open beneath the white mustache with its tinge of yellow.\r\nDoctor Foerder was pressing his fingers to the colonel’s wrist. The\r\nbreathing had lost all human quality, it was but a series of automatic\r\ngasps, which, it seemed, would never end. Finally they grew shorter, at\r\nlast they ceased, there was one faint inspiration, and Doctor Foerder,\r\nlaying the thin old hand down upon the colonel’s breast, said:\r\n\r\n“It’s all over.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a whole minute. Then Doctor Lambert tossed up the\r\nwindow, and Carroll heard, in the street below, a crowd shuffling over\r\nthe sidewalk, a crowd coming, as he knew, from the convention in Italia\r\nHall. And suddenly from the crowd arose a raucous, drunken yell:\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Warren!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFORM IN THE FIRST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe senatorial convention in the First District was to convene at\r\nten o’clock, in a dingy little hall in lower Clark Street, lighted\r\nby windows so long unwashed that they looked like ground glass. From\r\nthe chandeliers, black and sticky with dead flies, shreds of tissue\r\npaper fluttered, relics of some boisterous fête an Italian society had\r\ngiven there long ago. The floor was damp in arabesque wrought by a\r\nsprinkling-can, for the janitor had sprayed water there to lay the dust\r\nhe was too indifferent to remove. Perhaps a hundred chairs were set in\r\namphitheatrical order, and before them stood a kitchen table, on which\r\nwas a white water pitcher, flanked by a glass, thickened by various\r\nsedimentary deposits within.\r\n\r\nIn the saloon below, at nine o’clock, scores of delegates were already\r\nshuffling in the sawdust that covered the floor, holding huge schooners\r\nof beer in their hairy fists, gorging grossly at the free lunch table,\r\nwith bologna, rank onions and rye bread. The foam of the beer clung to\r\ntheir mustaches, which, after each sip, they sucked between their lips.\r\nMost of them managed, at the same time they were eating and drinking,\r\nby a dexterous sleight-of-hand, to smoke cheap domestic cigars, and a\r\ncloud of white smoke rolled along the low ceiling. Each new arrival\r\nwas greeted with some obscene but endearing epithet, and the room rang\r\nwith laughter and profanity. A keg of beer had been provided by one\r\nof Conway’s managers, and the bartender, wiping his hands on a dirty\r\ntowel, was rid, so long as the keg lasted, of the responsibility of\r\nkeeping account of drinks, and of ringing up the change on the cash\r\nregister. At eleven o’clock the keg was empty, the free lunch table\r\nabandoned to the flies, and the delegates scuffled up the dingy stairs\r\nto the hall. Half an hour later the chairman of the senatorial district\r\ncommittee pounded the kitchen table with a leg of a broken chair, and\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n“The convention will be in order.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration made no impression upon the babel of voices, the\r\nlaughter, the profanity, the noise of shuffling feet and scraping\r\nchairs. The delegates were scrambling to their places, seating\r\nthemselves by wards. Reporters flung themselves into seats at a second\r\ntable and gazed about the room, noting who were there. The political\r\nmen of the morning papers did not trouble themselves to take seats.\r\nThey loafed among the politicians in a way superior to the reporters\r\nfor the afternoon papers, as if they were politicians themselves,\r\nmaking history instead of recording it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the noise did not abate, and the committeeman was growing red\r\nin the face. The morning was warm, and the room, already cloudy with\r\ntobacco smoke, was filling with a noisome human odor. The atmosphere\r\nwas feculent. Delegates removed their coats, hanging them over the\r\nbacks of their chairs. Finally the chairman of the committee, growing\r\nimpatient, split the table with his club and yelled:\r\n\r\n“Damn it all, boys, come to order!”\r\n\r\nAnd then, eager to resign such a difficult command, he hastened to\r\nannounce:\r\n\r\n“The committee has named Honorable John P. Muldoon to act as temp’ry\r\nchairman.”\r\n\r\nHe handed the chair leg to John P. Muldoon, who, stroking back his\r\ncurly hair from his brow, began to beat the table impartially.\r\n\r\nAll this while Underwood stood against the wall, looking on. The\r\nquestion that had been agitating him for weeks was about to be decided,\r\nbut now that the ordeal was actually upon him, the consciousness beat\r\nnumbly against his brain, so that the whole scene lacked reality,\r\nalmost interest. He was dazed. He was about to take his baptism of\r\npolitical fire, and he trembled like a white novitiate.\r\n\r\nUnderwood belonged to one of the oldest families of Chicago--the name\r\nhad been known there before the fire. His father, who had lately\r\ntaken him into his law firm, continued to cling in his conservatism\r\nto an old stone house in Michigan Avenue long after his neighbors had\r\nabandoned their mansions to uncertain boarders, and either retreated\r\nfarther south or advanced to the North Side. John Underwood had come\r\nout of Harvard with a young lawyer’s ambition in politics, an ambition\r\nthat had the United States senate merely as a beginning of its home\r\nstretch, and when the year rolled around in which state senators were\r\nto be elected in the odd numbered districts he decided that it was time\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers had scented the sensation that lurked in the candidature\r\nof a young man like Underwood in a district like the First, and because\r\nhe was rich, because he wore good clothes, because he went into what\r\nis called society, promptly dubbed him a reformer, and thus weighted\r\nhe had set out upon his race for the nomination. He liked to see his\r\nname in the newspapers, liked to think of himself as a reformer, though\r\nhe was embarrassed in this attitude by the fascinating figure of the\r\npolitical boss he had hoped to become--a well-dressed, gentlemanly\r\nboss, of course, who, while at home in those saloons where he permitted\r\nthe convivial familiarity of the boys, nevertheless took his luncheons\r\nat his club. He fell into a way of speaking of the First as “my\r\ndistrict,” spoke of it, in fact, as if he, instead of Malachi Nolan\r\nand “Cinch” Conway, owned it, and when certain ward politicians in the\r\nfirst days of the campaign called upon him, Underwood was pleased to\r\nlend them money, just as he was pleased to comply with the requests of\r\ncertain others who organized the John W. Underwood First Ward Campaign\r\nClub, and sent a committee to inform him that they were assembled in\r\nthe club rooms ready to transact business, and beer only four dollars a\r\nkeg. He winked confidentially at himself in the mirror that night as he\r\ngave a final touch to his white cravat and surveyed his fine young form\r\narrayed in evening clothes for the reform banquet at the Palmer House.\r\nHis speech was _The Tendencies of Modern Politics_. The newspapers said\r\nit was a very brilliant speech, breathing lofty political sentiments\r\nthat were bound to make John W. Underwood votes. Also, the Reform Club\r\nindorsed his candidature.\r\n\r\nAs Underwood leaned against the greasy wall of the little hall on lower\r\nClark Street this morning, the whole campaign flashed before him, just\r\nas the events of a lifetime are said in books to flash before the mind\r\nof a drowning man. He recalled every vivid detail of the call Baldwin\r\nhad made upon him, how he entered his private office without troubling\r\nthe pale, pimpled office boy to announce him, how he lifted from his\r\ncarefully parted hair his straw hat with its youthful band of blue,\r\nand laughed out, “John, my boy, how are you? Hot, isn’t it?” He could\r\nsee Baldwin as he sat in the solid oak chair that stood intimately\r\nbeside his roll-top desk, fanning his ruddy face with the hat, which\r\nhad impressed a broad red band on his forehead. Underwood had been glad\r\nenough to close _Cooley on Taxation_ and revolve his chair to face\r\nBaldwin, just as if he had been a client, for Baldwin was the most\r\nimportant politician who had ever called upon him professionally.\r\n\r\nUnderwood remembered clearly how Baldwin’s excellent teeth glistened\r\nwhen he smiled, how he lighted a Turkish cigarette and, tilting up his\r\nchin, blew a long, airy stream of blue smoke through the thick hairs of\r\nhis mustache. He could even remember how carefully Baldwin sheltered\r\nthe flame of the match for Underwood’s cigarette, in that curious\r\nspirit of economy men always practice with regard to matches, much as\r\nif there were only one match left in the whole world. And then he could\r\nrecall almost word for word their conversation. Baldwin had frankly\r\ntold him that Conway had him handicapped, because he had the city hall\r\nwith him and controlled the Fifth Ward. Simmons, Baldwin had said,\r\ndidn’t cut much ice; he had some labor leaders with him, and would get\r\na bunch of delegates from his own ward, but that was about all. In\r\nfact, said Baldwin, concluding his judicial summing up, Conway could\r\nwin out, hands down, if it were not for his recent quarrel with Malachi\r\nNolan. Underwood remembered that during all this frankness he had\r\nreflectively drawn rude little geometrical figures on an envelope and\r\nhad been somehow afraid to look up at Baldwin, for the noted lobbyist\r\nhad sat there transfixing him with an eye that could read the mind of a\r\nman when it was impinged on politics--that is, practical politics--as\r\neasily as it could a poker hand across a table stacked with blue chips.\r\n\r\nHe knew Baldwin had come with some practical proposition, and when\r\nthe lobbyist suggested that he was too respectable, and would run\r\nbetter in some residence district, that the boys looked upon him as\r\na reformer, and that the silk stockings were not practical enough to\r\nhelp him, Underwood had felt that at last it was coming. It was simple\r\nenough. Baldwin had been talking that very morning about Underwood’s\r\ncandidature to Mr. Weed of the Metropolitan Motor System, and to Mr.\r\nPeabody, president of the Gas Company, and they had been very much\r\ninterested. They had an anxiety to see good men nominated that year,\r\nfor they had large business interests that were more or less affected\r\nby legislation, and had feared they would have to settle on Conway.\r\nConway had experience in legislative matters, and had been friendly\r\nenough in the city council, yet they felt they could hardly trust\r\nhim--he was such a grafter, and in such things, Baldwin blandly assured\r\nUnderwood, they had to depend upon a man’s honor alone, and so they had\r\nsent Baldwin to suggest that Underwood meet them at luncheon, and talk\r\nmatters over. Baldwin, with his love of ease and luxury, had preferred\r\na dinner over at the Cardinal’s in the evening, but Mr. Peabody had\r\nsomething on hand with the trustees of his church and couldn’t meet\r\nthem then. Baldwin had taken out his watch at this point, with the air\r\nof a man who suddenly remembers some important engagement--the details\r\nall came back with a fidelity that was painful--and stood awaiting\r\nUnderwood’s reply, with the open watch ticking impatiently in his palm.\r\n\r\nOf course, Underwood had understood--and he wished ardently to be\r\nnominated and elected. He could see himself swinging idly in a big\r\nchair behind a walnut desk in the senate chamber, just as an actor sees\r\nhimself, with an artist’s ecstatic, half-frightened gasp, in some new\r\npart he is about to study. The position would give him much importance,\r\nhe would be riding back and forth between Chicago and Springfield on\r\na pass, it would be so pleasant to be addressed as senator, to be\r\nconsulted, to head delegations in state conventions and cast the solid\r\nvote for any one he pleased; besides, it would be a good training for\r\nWashington, he could practise in oratory and parliamentary law just\r\nas he practised on friendless paupers over in the criminal court when\r\nhis father influenced some judge to appoint him to defend an indigent\r\nprisoner. It meant only one little word, he could be wary of promises.\r\nHis heart had expanded, he had turned half around in his chair to face\r\nBaldwin, when suddenly the reformer within him rose to object, pointed\r\nto his ideals, rehearsed the speech on _The Tendencies of Modern\r\nPolitics_, recalled all the good words the independent papers had\r\nspoken of him, urged the beauty of great sacrifices for principle. At\r\nthe idea of self-sacrifice, Underwood had felt a melting self-pity, he\r\nadmired himself in this new rôle of a self-sacrificing reformer. And so\r\nhe flung the cigarette out of the window, watched it whirl down to the\r\nmelting tar of the roofs below and said firmly:\r\n\r\n“I have an engagement this morning, Mr. Baldwin. I’m sorry, but I guess\r\nI can’t come.”\r\n\r\nOnce more Underwood saw the pleasantness leave Baldwin’s face, saw him\r\nfleck a flake of ash from the white waistcoat he wore with his summer\r\nsuit of blue, and snapping the lid of his watch shut, he once more\r\nheard him say in a final and reproachful tone:\r\n\r\n“Well, all right; sorry, my boy.”\r\n\r\nUnderwood wondered that morning in the noisy convention hall, whether,\r\nif he had the decision to make over again, he would decline such\r\ninfluence. It had been the cause of much doubt and some regret at the\r\ntime. The boss within him had protested--surely it was a political\r\nmistake--and the boss was louder than the reformer, and more plausible.\r\nHe came forward with a brilliant scheme. He recalled Baldwin’s\r\nreference to the rivalry between Nolan and Conway. Underwood remembered\r\nthat when he suggested the possibility of Nolan’s running for the\r\nnomination himself, Baldwin had shaken his head--there wasn’t enough in\r\nit, he said. Nolan could do very much better in the council, where he\r\nwas. Besides, Mr. Weed and Mr. Peabody disliked him.\r\n\r\nUnderwood thought out his scheme that afternoon, while hunting in\r\nthe digest for cases in point to be cited in a case his father was\r\npreparing for the appellate court. The work of looking up cases in\r\npoint, while its results are impressive and seem to smell of the lamp,\r\nhad in reality grown quite automatic to Underwood, and as he loafed\r\nover digests and reports and jotted down his notes, he elaborated\r\nthe scheme, just what he would say and do, how he would appear, and\r\nso forth. And so, when he entered Malachi Nolan’s place in Dearborn\r\nStreet, early that evening, he was fully prepared. The details of this\r\nincident came back just as the details of Baldwin’s visit had done--the\r\nempty saloon, the alderman himself leaning over his bar, his white\r\napron rolled into a big girth about his middle, the cigar in the round\r\nhole at the corner of his mouth gone out, denoting that it was time for\r\nhim to go down the alley to Billy Boyle’s and get his porterhouse and\r\nbaked potato.\r\n\r\nUnderwood watched Malachi Nolan mix his Martini cocktail, splash it\r\npicturesquely into a sparkling glass and bejewel it with a Maraschino\r\ncherry, then gravely take a cigar for himself and stow it away in his\r\nample waistcoat. Then, as Nolan mopped the bar with professional sweep\r\nof his white-sleeved, muscular arm, Underwood unfolded his brilliant\r\nscheme, skirting carefully the acute suspicions of an old politician.\r\nBut Nolan mopped, blinking inscrutably, at last putting the damp cloth\r\naway in some mysterious place under the counter. The fat Maltese cat,\r\nwaiting until the moisture on the bar had evaporated, stretched herself\r\nagain beside the silver urn that held the crackers and the little cubes\r\nof cheese. Still Nolan blinked in silence, like a hostile jury with its\r\nmind made up, until at last, in desperation, Underwood blurted out his\r\nproposition. Nolan blinked some more, then, half opening his blue Irish\r\neyes, grunted:\r\n\r\n“Well, I like your gall.”\r\n\r\nUnderwood’s spirits fell, yet he was not disappointed. It was,\r\nafter all, just what he had expected. It served him right for his\r\npresumption, if nothing more--though the subdued reformer within had\r\nhinted at other reasons. He hung his head, twirling his empty glass\r\ndisconsolately. He did not see the light that twinkled in the blue\r\neyes, he had not then known how very ready Nolan was to form any\r\ncombination that would beat Conway and Baldwin, especially with a\r\nreformer like himself who had money to spend on his ambitions. He had\r\nnot discerned how badly the man whom the newspapers always cartooned\r\nwith the First Ward sticking out of his vest pocket, needed a reformer\r\nin his business, as the saying is. Hence his glad surprise when Nolan\r\nwiped his big hand on his apron like a washer-woman and held it out,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“But I’m wit’ ye.”\r\n\r\nThen the campaign, under Nolan’s management, in the most wonderful\r\nlegislative district--a cosmopolitan district, bristling with\r\nsociological problems, a district that has fewer homes and more\r\nsaloons, more commerce and more sloth, more millionaires and more\r\npaupers, and while it confines within its boundaries the skyscrapers,\r\nclubs, theaters and hundred churches of a metropolis, still boasts a\r\npolice station with more arrests on its blotter than any other in the\r\nworld. Night after night, with Nolan’s two candidates for the house,\r\nhe spent in saloons where a candidate must treat and distribute his\r\ncards that the boys may size him up; lodging houses and barrel houses\r\nin lower Clark Street, where sweating negroes and frowsy whites drank\r\nfive-cent whisky with him; blazing saloons along the levee, where\r\neven the poor, painted girls at the tables lifted their glasses when\r\nhe ordered the drinks for the house; crap games and policy shops in\r\nlower Clark Street, the Syrian, Arabic, Chinese and Italian quarters\r\ndown by the squalid Bad Lands, and at last a happier evening along the\r\nArchey Road. Underwood had three weeks of this, and as he stood in the\r\nconvention hall that morning, unwashed, unshaven, his linen soiled,\r\nhis shoes muddy, his own friends would not have known him, though he\r\ncared little enough for this now--they had all forgotten to go to the\r\nprimaries the day before, and those for whom he had sent carriages had\r\nbeen too busy, or too respectable, to respond. The taste of bad beer\r\nand the scorch of cheap cigars still smacked in his mouth--indeed, he\r\ndid not get them entirely out until he came back from Mt. Clemens two\r\nweeks after the nomination.\r\n\r\nBut they were balloting for permanent chairman now. It would be a test\r\nvote; it would disclose his own strength and the strength of Conway.\r\nHe looked over the red faces before him. He saw Conway himself moving\r\namong the delegates, snarling, cursing, quarreling with the friends\r\nof years; he saw Conway’s candidate for the house, McGlone, over in\r\nthe Second Ward delegation, his coat off, a handkerchief about his\r\nfat neck, a fuming cigar between his chubby fingers, turning on his\r\nheavy haunches to revile some man who was numbered with Nolan’s crowd;\r\nhe saw in the First Ward delegation, Malachi Nolan, clean-shaven, in\r\nblack coat and cravat, his iron gray hair cropped short, calm alone\r\nof all the others. He would have looked the priest more than the\r\nsaloon-keeper, had he smoked his cigar differently. Now and then he\r\nsolemnly raised his hand, with almost the benediction of a father, to\r\nstill the clamor of his delegation, which, with its twenty-one votes,\r\nwas safe at all events for Underwood.\r\n\r\nMuldoon was Conway’s man--they would try to make the temporary\r\norganization permanent. D’Ormand was Underwood’s candidate. And Muldoon\r\nwon. Underwood had lost the first round.\r\n\r\nThe candidates for senator were to be placed in nomination first.\r\nUnderwood stood in the crowded doorway and heard Conway’s name\r\npresented. Then, in the cheering, with his heart in his sanded throat,\r\nhe heard the chairman say:\r\n\r\n“Are there any other nominations?”\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary stillness, and then he heard a thick, strong\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman!”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from the First Ward.”\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman,” the thick, strong voice said, “I roise to place in\r\nnomynation the name of wan--”\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Malachi Nolan, and Underwood suddenly remembered\r\nthat Nolan was to place his name before the convention. He listened\r\nan instant, but could not endure it long. He could not endure that\r\nmen should see him in the hour when his name was being thus laid\r\nnaked to the world. Reporters were writing it down, perhaps the crowd\r\nwould laugh or whistle or hiss. Besides, candidates do not remain in\r\nthe convention hall; they await the committee of notification in\r\nsome near-by saloon. He squeezed through the mass of men who stood on\r\ntiptoes, stretching their necks to see and hear the old leader of the\r\nFirst Ward, and fled.\r\n\r\nThe first ballot was taken--Conway, 31; Underwood, 30; Simmons, the\r\ndark horse, 8; necessary to a choice, 35. The vote was unchanged for\r\ntwenty-six ballots, till the afternoon had worn away, and the trucks\r\nhad jolted off the cobblestones of Clark Street, till the lights were\r\nflaring and hot tamale men, gamblers, beggars, street walkers, all\r\nthe denizens of darkness were shifting along the sidewalks, till the\r\npolicemen had been changed on their beats, and Pinkerton night watchmen\r\nwere trying the doors of stores, till Chinamen shuffled forth, and\r\nJewesses and Italian women emerged for their evening breath of air,\r\nbringing swart and grimy children to play upon the heated flags. The\r\nhall was lighted, just as if some Italian festival were to be held\r\nthere. The reporters’ places at the table were taken by the men who\r\ndid politics for the morning papers, themselves reduced at last to\r\nthe necessity of taking notes. They brought reports of the results in\r\nother senatorial conventions held about town that day--it seemed to\r\nbe assured that John Skelley had carried the country towns, Lemont,\r\nRiverside, Evanston, and so on. In certain west side districts this\r\nman had won, in certain north side districts that man had been\r\nsuccessful. It looked as if the old gang was going to break back into\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\nAnd so the interest in this one remaining convention deepened, the\r\nstrain tightened, the crowd thickened. The delegates, tired and sullen,\r\nshed their waistcoats, tore off their moist and dirty collars and\r\nsettled down to an angry fight. The amphitheatrical arrangement of the\r\nchairs had long been broken. The ward delegations now formed circles\r\nabout their leaders. The damp arabesques wrought by the janitor’s\r\nsuperficial sprinkling-can had long since been superseded by arabesques\r\nof tobacco juice. The floor was littered with scraps of paper, the\r\nspent ballots with which the stubborn contest had been waged. The\r\nFirst Ward delegation was in a solid ring, and in the center of it sat\r\nMalachi Nolan, his elbows on his knees, tearing old ballots into tiny\r\nspecks of paper and strewing them on the floor, but keeping all the\r\nwhile a surveying eye on the Fifth Ward delegation, now divided into\r\ntwo groups, one of which surrounded Howe, the other huddling about\r\nGrogan, the lawyer, who, with disheveled hair, a handkerchief about\r\nhis neck, stood glaring angrily at Nolan, his eyes shadowed by heavy\r\ncircles telling of weariness and the strain.\r\n\r\nNow and then the leaders made desperate attempts to trade, harrying\r\nSimmons, offering him everything for his seven votes. Simmons himself,\r\nin his turn, tried to induce each faction to swing its strength to him.\r\n\r\nBut the situation remained unchanged.\r\n\r\nOnce Nolan sent for Underwood and whispered to him. He thought he\r\nknew one or two Conway men who could be got very cheaply, but the\r\nboy shook his head--the reformer within him demurred--and yet he\r\nsmiled sardonically at the reformer thinking of the primaries and the\r\nconvention itself.\r\n\r\nThen Malachi Nolan caught the chairman’s shifty eye and moved an\r\nadjournment until morning. But even as he spoke, Grogan scowled at\r\nMuldoon, shook his head at his followers, and the room rang with their\r\nhoarse shouts:\r\n\r\n“No! no! no!”\r\n\r\nHeartened by this confession of weakness on Nolan’s part, they kept on\r\nyelling lustily:\r\n\r\n“No! no! no!”\r\n\r\nThey even laughed, and Muldoon smote the table, to declare the motion\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nOn the forty-seventh ballot, one of the Simmons votes went over to\r\nConway, and there was a faint cheer. On the forty-eighth, one of the\r\nSimmons votes went to Underwood, and parity was restored. On the\r\nforty-ninth, Underwood gained another of Simmons’ votes--Nolan, it\r\nseemed, had promised to get him on the janitor’s pay-roll in the state\r\nhouse--and the vote was tied. This ballot stood:\r\n\r\n                First      Second      Fifth\r\n                Ward        Ward       Ward       Total\r\n\r\n  Conway         --         10          22           32\r\n  Underwood      21          4           7           32\r\n  Simmons        --          5          --            5\r\n\r\nThe Simmons men were holding out, waiting to throw their strength to\r\nthe winner. When the sixty-seventh ballot had been taken, Muldoon,\r\nsquinting in the miserable light, at the secretary’s figures, hit the\r\ntable with the chair leg and said:\r\n\r\n“On this ballot Conway receives 32, Underwood 32, Simmons 5. There\r\nbeing no choice, you will prepare your ballots for another vote.”\r\n\r\nJust then one of the Conway men from the Second Ward left his\r\nplace, and touched one of Nolan’s fellows in the First Ward\r\ndelegation--Donahue--on the shoulder. Donahue started. The man\r\nwhispered in his ear, and returned to his delegation, keeping his eye\r\non Donahue. Underwood looked on breathlessly. Nolan, revolving slowly,\r\nheld his hat for every vote--last of all for Donahue’s. The man dropped\r\nhis folded ballot into the hat and hung his head. Nolan calmly picked\r\nthe ballot out of the hat and gave it back to Donahue, who looked up in\r\naffected surprise.\r\n\r\n“What’s the trouble, Malachi?” he said as innocently as he could. He\r\nwas not much of an actor.\r\n\r\n“This won’t do,” Nolan said, giving the ballot back to the man.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right, Malachi, honest to God it is!” protested Donahue.\r\n\r\n“Thin I’ll just put this wan in for ye, heh?” said Nolan, drawing\r\nanother ballot from the pocket of his huge waistcoat and poising it\r\nabove the hat.\r\n\r\nThe crowd had pressed around the First Ward delegation. The convention\r\nhad risen to its feet, craning red necks, and out of the mass, Grogan\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n“Aw, here, Malachi Nolan, none o’ that now!”\r\n\r\nNolan turned his rugged face toward him and said simply:\r\n\r\n“Who’s runnin’ this dillygation, you or me?”\r\n\r\n“Well--none o’ your bulldozing--we won’t stand it!” replied Grogan\r\nangrily, his blue eyes blazing.\r\n\r\n“You get to hell out o’ this.” And so saying, Nolan dropped the ballot\r\ninto the hat and turned to face the chair.\r\n\r\n“Have you all voted?” inquired Muldoon.\r\n\r\n“First Ward!” the secretary called.\r\n\r\nNolan squared his shoulders, not having looked in his hat or counted\r\nthe ballots there, and said slowly and impressively:\r\n\r\n“On behalf av the solid dillygation av the First Ward, I cast\r\ntwinty-wan votes for John W. Underwood.”\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman! Misther Chairman!” cried Grogan, waving his hand in\r\nthe air, “I challenge that vote! I challenge that vote!”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman from the Fifth Ward challenges the vote--”\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman,” said Nolan, standing with one heavy foot on his\r\nchair and leveling a forefinger at Muldoon, “a point of order! The\r\ngintleman from the Fifth Ward has no right to challenge the vote av the\r\nFirst Ward--he’s not a mimber of the dillygation!”\r\n\r\n“Let the First Ward be polled,” calmly ruled Muldoon. Nolan took his\r\nfoot from his chair and stepped to Donahue’s side. Every man in the\r\nFirst Ward delegation, as his name was called from the credentials,\r\ncried “Underwood!” As the secretary neared the name of Donahue, Nolan\r\nlaid his hand heavily on the fellow’s shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Donahue!” called the secretary.\r\n\r\nThe fellow squirmed under Nolan’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Donahue!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t let him bluff you!” cried some one from the Fifth Ward.\r\n\r\n“Vote as you damn please, Jimmie!”\r\n\r\n“T’row the boots into ’im, Donnie!”\r\n\r\n“Soak him one!”\r\n\r\n“Take your hands off him, Bull Nolan!”\r\n\r\nSo they bawled and Donahue wriggled. But the hand of Nolan, like the\r\nhand of Douglas, was his own, and gripped fast. Grogan, his face red,\r\nhis eyes on fire, leaped from his place in his delegation, and started\r\nacross the chairs for Nolan. The big saloon-keeper gave him a look out\r\nof his little eye. His left shoulder dipped, his left fist tightened.\r\nGrogan halted.\r\n\r\n“Vote, Jimmie, me lad,” said Nolan, in a soft voice.\r\n\r\n“Underwood!” said Donahue, in a whisper. His weak, pinched, hungry\r\nface turned appealingly toward Grogan. His blear eyes were filmy with\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n“He votes for John W. Underwood, Misther Chairman,” said Nolan\r\ncomplacently. The vote was unchanged. The chairman ordered another\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nAnd then, all at once, as if a breath from a sanded desert had been\r\nblown into the room, Underwood was sensible of a change in the\r\natmosphere. The air was perhaps no hotter than it had been for hours\r\nat the close of that stifling day, no bluer with tobacco smoke, no\r\nheavier with the smell borne in from Clark Street on hot night winds\r\nthat had started cool and fresh from the lake four blocks away, a\r\nsmell compounded of many smells, the smell ascending from foul and dark\r\ncellars beneath the sidewalk, the smell of stale beer, the ammoniac\r\nsmell of filthy pavements, mingled with the feculence of unclean bodies\r\nthat had sweated for hours in the vitiated air of that low-ceilinged,\r\ncrowded room. It had a strange moral density that oppressed him, that\r\noppressed all, even the politicians, for they ceased from cursing and\r\nfrom speech, and now sat sullen, silent, suspiciously eying their\r\ncompanions. It was an atmosphere charged with some ominous foreboding,\r\nsome awful fear. Underwood had never felt that atmosphere before, yet,\r\nwith a gasp that came not as an effect of the heat, he recognized its\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nA hush fell. Muldoon, his black, curly locks shining with perspiration,\r\nwas leaning on his improvised gavel, his keen eye, the Irish eye that\r\nso readily seizes such situations, darting into every face before him.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly came that for which they were waiting. A man entered\r\nthe hall and strode straight across the floor into the Fifth Ward\r\ndelegation, into the group where the Underwood men were clustered\r\nabout their leader. He wore evening clothes, his black dinner-coat\r\nand white shirt bosom striking a vivid note in the scene. He walked\r\nbriskly, but his mind was so intent upon his pose that it was not\r\nuntil he had removed his cigarette from his lips and had observed\r\nUnderwood, that his white teeth showed beneath his reddish mustache in\r\nthe well-known smile of George R. Baldwin. He elbowed his way into the\r\nvery midst of the Underwood men from the Fifth Ward, and leading one of\r\nthem aside, talked with him an instant, and then returned him, as it\r\nwere, to his place in the delegation. Then he brought forth another,\r\nwhispered to him for an earnest moment, and sent him back, with a smile\r\nand a slap on the shoulder. The third delegate detained him longer,\r\nand once, as he argued with him, the slightest shade of displeasure\r\ncrossed Baldwin’s face, but in an instant the smile replaced it, and he\r\ntalked--convincingly, it seemed. Before Baldwin returned this man to\r\nhis delegation, he shook hands with him.\r\n\r\nThe secretary was calling the wards, and Nolan had announced the result\r\nin his delegation. The Fifth Ward was a long while in preparing its\r\nballots. There was trouble of some sort there, among the Underwood\r\nmen. Nolan was urging, expostulating, cursing, commanding. The air was\r\ntense. It seemed to Underwood that it must inevitably be shattered by\r\nsome moral cataclysm in the soul of man. Grogan’s brow was knit, as he\r\nwaited, hat in hand. The delegates voted. Feverishly, with trembling\r\nfingers, Grogan opened and counted the bits of paper. Then he sprang to\r\nhis feet, with a wild, glad light in his face.\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman!” he cried, “the Fifth Ward casts twenty-five votes\r\nfor Conway and four for Underwood!”\r\n\r\nThe three bolters in the Fifth Ward delegation sat with defiance\r\nin their faces, but they could not sustain the expression, even by\r\nhuddling close together. They broke for the door, wriggling their\r\nway through masses of men, who made their passage uncertain, almost\r\nperilous. A billow of applause broke from the Conway men, and submerged\r\nthe convention. Delegates all over the hall were on their feet,\r\nclamoring for recognition, but Malachi Nolan’s voice boomed heavily\r\nabove all other voices. His fist was in the air above all other fists.\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman!” he yelled, “I challenge that vote!”\r\n\r\n“Misther Chairman!” yelled Grogan, “a point of order! The gentleman\r\nisn’t a member of the Fifth Ward delegation and can not challenge its\r\nvote!”\r\n\r\n“The point of order is well taken,” promptly ruled the chair. “The\r\ngentleman from the First Ward is out of order--he will take his seat.”\r\n\r\nMen were screaming, brandishing fists, waving hats, coats, anything,\r\nscraping chairs, pounding the floor with them. There were heavy, brutal\r\noaths, and, here and there, the smack of a fist on a face. In the\r\ntumult, the five Simmons votes went to Conway. Muldoon was beating the\r\ntable with his club and crying:\r\n\r\n“Order! order! order!”\r\n\r\n“To hell with order!” bawled some one from the First Ward delegation.\r\n\r\n“On this ballot,” Muldoon was calling, “there were sixty-nine votes\r\ncast; necessary to a choice, thirty-five. James P. Conway has received\r\nforty votes; John W. Underwood, twenty-nine, and George W. Simmons”--he\r\npaused, as if to decipher the vote--“none. James P. Conway, having\r\nreceived the necessary number of votes, is therefore declared the\r\nnominee of this convention.”\r\n\r\nUnderwood was stunned. He staggered through the horrible uproar toward\r\nthe door. He longed for the air outside, even the heavy air of lower\r\nClark street, where the people surged along under the wild, dazzling\r\nlights, in two opposite, ever-passing processions. His head reeled.\r\nHe lost the sense of things, the voices about him seemed far away and\r\nvague, he felt himself detached, as it were, from all that had gone\r\nbefore. But as he pressed his way through the crowd that blocked the\r\nentrance, and plunged toward the stairs, he saw Baldwin, mopping the\r\nred band on his white brow. Baldwin recognized him, and said, with his\r\neverlasting smile:\r\n\r\n“Sorry, my boy--next time!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACHI NOLAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMalachi Nolan sat by the roll-top desk in the front window of his\r\nsaloon. The desk was unopened, for Malachi seldom had occasion to use\r\nit. The only letters he ever wrote were to whisky houses in Peoria or\r\nLouisville, and then the process was a painful one. His mighty haunches\r\ncompletely filled the chair, which, in turn, completely filled the\r\nspace railed off in front of the partition that screened the bar. The\r\nsaloon was in a basement in Dearborn Street, and, to get to it, you had\r\nto go down four stone steps, hollowed by countless feet in the long\r\nyears he had kept there. Outside, over the door, a long, black sign\r\nbore his simple device--M. Nolan.\r\n\r\nMalachi Nolan sat with his back to the window. His cropped gray hair\r\nshowed his red scalp, the hard red skin on his face was closely shaven\r\nand shone on the points of his heavy jaw. In the round hole at the\r\ncorner of his broad mouth was one of the long succession of cigars that\r\nhad worn away the hole, sending up its perpetual incense. He never\r\nremoved the cigar and seldom puffed it. It seemed to smoke of its own\r\nvolition, and lasted a long time. When it consumed itself, Malachi\r\nreplaced it with another. No one had ever seen him without a cigar in\r\nthat hole at the side of his mouth. When he moved his thin lips to\r\nspeak the cigar would stand out rigidly between his teeth. He spoke\r\nwith his teeth clenched. He was in his shirt-sleeves, and his shirt\r\nwas clean and fresh, for he changed his linen daily, just as he shaved\r\nhimself, relentlessly, every morning with a dull razor. On his glossy\r\nshirt front a great diamond, four carats in weight, sparkled leisurely\r\nas his enormous chest slowly rose and fell with his heavy breathing.\r\nThis diamond was the central jewel of his alderman’s gold star,\r\npresented by constituents years before. The setting was so contrived\r\nthat the stone could be unscrewed and made to serve as a stud. Malachi\r\nseldom wore the star, unless he went to a fire, or to a prize-fight\r\nacross the Indiana line, or to the Olympic Theater, or got drunk.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there in his warm saloon on this raw March morning, Malachi\r\nread his paper, read it carefully and slowly, first the front page,\r\ncolumn after column, then the second page, and so on, methodically,\r\nthrough all the pages, except the editorials, which he skipped. His\r\nlips moved slightly as he read, for he had to pronounce the words to\r\nhimself in order to get their full meaning. He read his paper thus\r\nevery morning of his life, and his paper was all he ever did read.\r\n\r\nMalachi sat this morning, as on every other morning of the year, heavy,\r\nimponderable and solemn. The hour was ten o’clock. It was too early for\r\nbusiness to begin in that saloon, so that the old bartender, who had\r\nbeen with Malachi for fifteen years, sat with his apron in his lap,\r\nagainst the whisky barrels that reached in rows from the slot machine\r\nback to the wooden stalls where many a campaign in the city council had\r\nbeen planned and its victory celebrated. The bartender was likewise\r\nreading a paper, the sporting news chiefly claiming his attention. By\r\nnoon, aldermen and city hall employees would begin to drop in, and the\r\nplace would liven up, but now the monotonous ticking of the Western\r\nUnion clock on the wall could be heard all over the long room, and the\r\nbig Maltese cat snoozed lazily at one end of the bar.\r\n\r\nMalachi was not feeling as well as usual this morning, though his\r\nexterior was as clean and calm as ever. A fever burned beneath his\r\ngreat waistcoat, and on coming down he had drunk a bottle of mineral\r\nwater. The truth is, that the night before, Malachi had so far departed\r\nfrom the habit of his methodical life as to drink much whisky, a\r\nthing he had not done for years, ever since the occasion, in fact,\r\nwhen celebrating a reëlection to the council, he had drunk so much\r\nthat he was constrained to enter a barber shop in State Street, and\r\nterrorize the barbers by sticking all the razors in the floor, like\r\na juggler he had seen playing with knives in a theater. The gang had\r\nbeen in the saloon until three o’clock that morning. They had just\r\npassed an ordinance granting a new franchise to the Metropolitan Motor\r\nCompany, and in one of the walnut stalls the bundle had been cut, as\r\nthe phrase is. The gang had grown so hilarious, as it always did on\r\nsuch occasions, that it had proposed a song by Malachi. Now, in his\r\nyounger days, Malachi had been a great lad for song, and many a shindig\r\nin Bridgeport had he gladdened with his voice, but in the latter years\r\nit was seldom that he could be induced to exercise it. He would always\r\nplead his age and his flesh, and such was the solemnity of manner\r\nthat had grown upon him with the years, that men in their sober hours\r\nnever had the temerity to suggest anything so unbecoming his dignity.\r\nBut on this night, heated by wine, and feeling, though they did not\r\nof course analyze the feeling, that so many improprieties had been\r\ncommitted that one more could not noticeably swell the score, they had\r\nbeen emboldened to demand a song. Malachi, standing by his own bar in\r\nhis long frock coat and square-crowned stiff hat, twiddling his whisky\r\nglass just as if he were a casual visitor there, had resolutely shaken\r\nhis head. But at two o’clock in the morning he had suddenly ordered the\r\ndrinks for the house, and then, when the gang had given over all hope\r\nof his singing, save, perhaps, one or two who, deeper in their cups\r\nthan the rest, had monotonously persisted in the invitation, he had\r\nspontaneously burst forth:\r\n\r\n  “Oh, Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that’s going round?\r\n  The shamrock is forbid by law to grow on Irish ground.\r\n  St. Patrick’s day no more we’ll keep, his colors can’t be seen,\r\n  For there’s a bloody law ag’in the wearin’ of the green.\r\n  I met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand,\r\n  And he said, ‘How’s poor old Ireland, and how does she stand?’”\r\n\r\nAnd then the gang, unable to hold its enthusiasm, bellowed in chorus\r\nwith the sadly cracked voice, which, nevertheless, retained the true\r\nold Irish lilt:\r\n\r\n  “She’s the most distressful country that ever yet was seen,\r\n  They are hangin’ men and women for the wearin’ of the green.”\r\n\r\nThey had sung it over and over, prolonging to a greater extent with\r\neach repetition the high note upon which in the song the word “men”\r\nfalls. Once in tune, it was not so difficult to get Malachi to sing\r\nother songs, and he gave them, with the genuine flavor of the old sod,\r\n_Garryowen_. The gang became uproarious when he reached the stanza:\r\n\r\n  “Johnny Connell’s tall and straight,\r\n  And in his limbs he is complate,\r\n  He’ll pitch a bar of any weight\r\n  From Garryowen to Thomond gate.”\r\n\r\nBut the climax was reached when Malachi was at last induced to sing\r\n_The Night Before Larry Was Stretched_. This had taken time and\r\ndiplomacy, for the more popular the song, the more difficult it was to\r\nprevail upon him to sing it, though at last he yielded, and the gang\r\nrestrained itself as he began:\r\n\r\n  “The night before Larry was stretched,\r\n    The boys they all paid him a visit,\r\n  A bit in their sacks too they fetched,\r\n    They sweated their duds till they riz it:\r\n  For Larry was always the lad,\r\n    When a friend was condemned to the squeezer,\r\n  But he’d fence all the togs that he had\r\n    Just to help the poor boy to a sneezer,\r\n    And moisten his gob ’fore he died.”\r\n\r\nThe lagging last line was too much, and in their mad delight they began\r\nto pound Malachi familiarly on the back. And then he froze stiffly,\r\ndrew himself up, ordered his cab and went home, and the song was never\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nBut now that morning had come and reason had returned with the light,\r\nhe felt a chagrin at having suffered such a lapse in his dignity, and\r\nsuch a break in the resolution of years, and so was more solemn than\r\never.\r\n\r\nWhen Malachi had read to the last line of the last column of the last\r\npage of his newspaper, he did not fold it and lay it aside as he did\r\nevery other morning of the year. He turned to the first page and\r\nstudied the picture there. It was the daily cartoon, and the central\r\nfigure was intended for Malachi himself. That there could be no\r\nquestion of identity, the prudent artist had labeled it “Bull Nolan.”\r\nThe figure was one that Malachi had seen in the newspapers in varying\r\nsituations for years, and the aldermanic paunch, with massive chain\r\nand charm, the bullet head, with its stubble of hair and bell-crowned\r\nhat, the checked and braided clothes, the broad-soled shoes and\r\ncheckered spats, the briskly radiating lines to symbolize his diamond,\r\nwere supposed to embody the popular conception of the alderman’s\r\npersonality. The inevitable cigar had fallen and lay fuming at his\r\nfeet, the eyes and mouth gaped in palpable fear, and with a fat hand\r\nflashing other diamonds, this counterfeit presentment of Malachi Nolan\r\nwas trying to protect the First Ward--peeping on a ballot from his\r\nwaistcoat pocket--from a gentleman with high hat, side whiskers, gloves\r\nand cane, who, labeled “Citizen,” obviously impersonated the better\r\nelement. The point of the cartoon was that the Municipal Reform League\r\nhad resolved that Malachi Nolan be retired from public life. The League\r\nhad had a banquet, and the speeches had breathed a zeal of reform such\r\nas only champagne and truffles can inspire. The resolutions rang like\r\na declaration of independence; if the reform candidate, a gentleman\r\nof prominent probity, were beaten in regular convention, they would\r\nnominate him by petition.\r\n\r\nMalachi studied the cartoon a long time, never changing expression,\r\nand when he finished, he folded the paper carefully and laid it on\r\nhis desk, bestowed his spectacles in his waistcoat pocket, and then,\r\nplacing a hand on each knee, sat and stared with widening eyes straight\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nIt was not a new experience to be thus caricatured. He had long\r\nsince acquired a politician’s stoicism and could affect a reassuring\r\nindifference to attacks of the press; indeed, if a newspaper happened\r\nto elude him and slip into Nora’s hands, he could even pretend to like\r\nit. But this cartoon roused the fighting Irish in him.\r\n\r\nMalachi had promised himself to retire from politics that spring,\r\nthough his wary habit had kept him from taking the public into\r\nhis confidence. He was rich, though not rich enough to give up\r\nsaloon-keeping and become a contractor or a broker, and he had lately\r\ngot the notion that he was growing old. But this successful politician,\r\nwho so long before had landed in New York a homesick emigrant, had\r\none great ambition unfulfilled. It was the common ambition of the\r\nexile--to see his home once more. When first elected to the council,\r\nafter toiling years to save enough for his first small saloon, he had\r\nfound, in the sentimental manner of his race, his chief joy in the\r\nfact that it was in the character of an ex-alderman he could go home\r\nto Ireland. Fate, of course, with her usual irony, had embittered his\r\njoy; Molly had died that very spring, she had not been spared even\r\nlong enough to see him take his seat in the council chamber behind the\r\none pathetic floral piece his constituents had placed upon his desk,\r\nbut had left him to sit beside the candles at her wake, with lonesome\r\nlittle Nora crying at his knee. He felt that he had earned a rest. He\r\nhad worked hard, mastered the intricate details of the water office and\r\nthe special assessment bureau; he had done his part in making a town of\r\nwooden sidewalks a city of steel and stone; he had never betrayed his\r\nparty or his friend. As for certain of his methods, well--if he thought\r\nof them at all--they were direct, and they won. So now that Nora was\r\ngrown and had finished her education at St. Aloysius, he had decided\r\nto retire and take her with him on the long-dreamed-of trip back to\r\nIreland--Ireland, where it was really spring that very morning.\r\n\r\nBut he wished to retire gracefully, to name his successor before he\r\nwent, and how could he do this with the reformers making the fight\r\nof their lives against him? It would take Malachi Nolan some time to\r\ndecide a question like that. He must think. Nora was young; after all,\r\nanother term would make little difference; if he concluded to give some\r\nmore lessons in practical politics to the reformers, she could take\r\nsome more lessons on the piano.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, like a wise statesman, Malachi Nolan set about his day’s\r\nwork. He had enough to keep him busy, so, drawing out his gold watch\r\nhe carefully compared it with the clock, grasped the hour, rose\r\ndeliberately, settled his ponderous body on his thick legs, and\r\nwithdrew behind the partition. When he emerged to view again he was\r\nwrapped in his frieze overcoat, with his square-crowned hat pulled down\r\nto his eyebrows, ready for his morning visit to the city hall.\r\n\r\nHis progress over the great building was constantly impeded by men who\r\nstepped out of the rushing throngs of lawyers and lawyers’ clerks, city\r\nemployees, court officials and politicians to shake hands with him, to\r\nwhisper to him. He halted each time in a way that did not impair his\r\nHibernian dignity, heard them with gravity, and walked on. He went to\r\nthe water office to see why young Hennessey had been laid off; to the\r\ncivil service commission to find out what opportunities the sixty-day\r\nlist afforded; to the commissioner of public works to have some\r\nlaborers put on the pay-roll; to the board of election commissioners to\r\ngive in a list of certain constituents he desired to have appointed as\r\nextra clerks during the spring rush of work. He dropped in on the chief\r\nof police to get Murphy on the force; he saw the city clerk about a\r\ngood fellow who had to be taken care of; he even followed the long hall\r\nto the court-house wing, where he whispered an instant to Judge Peters\r\nand had a friend excused from the jury.\r\n\r\nAnd then he called on the mayor. A lieutenant of police, in gold\r\nstripes and stars, the velvet cuffs of his blue coat scrupulously\r\nbrushed, was just going in. When the officer came out, the big\r\npoliceman standing guard at the door raised his hand in a semi-military\r\nsalute, and he kept a finger at his forehead until Malachi entered,\r\nthus declaring his abiding faith in the alderman’s political star, and\r\nhis concern for his own official one.\r\n\r\nThe mayor sat at his great, square desk, with that look of nervous\r\nweariness Chicago gives the faces of its successful men, though the\r\nmorning was young and the day’s strain scarce begun.\r\n\r\n“Well, Alderman,” he said with a sigh, “what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\n“Misther May’r,” said Nolan, “I come fer to ask a favor.”\r\n\r\nThe shade of weariness under the mayor’s eyes enveloped his brow,\r\nalthough he tried to wipe it out with his palm. Everybody came every\r\nday to ask favors.\r\n\r\n“Now, Alderman,” he said, turning away fretfully, “I know. Please don’t\r\nask me to interfere in your fight this spring. I’ll promise to keep\r\nhands off and leave you alone. Ain’t that enough?”\r\n\r\n“Who said annything about my fight?” said Malachi. “It’s time enough to\r\nsaay good marnin’ to th’ divil whin ye meet ’im, Jawn.”\r\n\r\nThe mayor looked a bit relieved, and turned toward Malachi with half a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, Alderman, I supposed, of course--But what can I do for\r\nyou?” He repeated his formula.\r\n\r\nMalachi seated himself, and dangling his hat between his knees, he said:\r\n\r\n“They’s a laad from my waard in the Bridewell, Jawn, an’ he’s a mother\r\nwho’s wallopin’ a wash-board be th’ daay an’ night fer to make a\r\nlivin’. His name’s James McGlone, an’ I’m afther a paardon fer ’im.”\r\n\r\nThe mayor scowled. “What’s he in for?”\r\n\r\n“Damned if I know,” said Malachi; “he’s all the time in wan shcrape or\r\nanither with some o’ thim bla’gyaards down there.”\r\n\r\nThe mayor was turning a long blue pencil over and over, end for end,\r\nbetween his white fingers, making a series of monotonous tappings on\r\nhis desk.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you wait till after election?” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“His time’ll be served out befoore that,” said Malachi, “an’ ph’at\r\ngood’ll a paardon do ’im thin?”\r\n\r\nThe mayor continued the thoughtful tapping with his long blue pencil.\r\n\r\n“Well, Alderman,” he said after a while, “I’d rather not issue any\r\npardons before election, if I can help it. These reformers are going to\r\nraise hell this spring, sticking their noses into everybody’s business,\r\nand--”\r\n\r\nMalachi’s little eyes contracted until their blue twinkle was almost\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\n“But, Jawn,” he said, “so much the more r’ason why ye’ll want the\r\nFirsht in th’ convintion.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said the mayor, “if it’s important--” And he pressed a\r\nbutton under his desk. Before his secretary appeared he added:\r\n\r\n“You say you don’t know what he’s in for?”\r\n\r\n“I dinnaw,” Malachi replied, “Mallett sint him up befoore I could git\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to watch those things more closely, Alderman,” chided the\r\nmayor peevishly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMalachi Nolan sat at twilight with a glass of hot toddy on the leaf\r\nof his desk, and he sipped it with heavy sighs, for he had taken cold\r\nout in the March weather, with pores opened by the relaxations of the\r\nnight before. Through his windows he could see the lights glimmering\r\nin the rain that had followed the moist snow of the early morning, and\r\nthousands of feet trudging by under rolled-up trousers or skirts held\r\nankle high. At intervals the feet would line up along the curb waiting\r\nfor North Side cable-cars, and seeing them paddle in the dirty slush,\r\nMalachi in the selfish spirit of contrast, more than ever coddled in\r\nthe warmth of the room, of the toddy over which he smacked his lips,\r\nand of the cigar he smoked so slowly and comfortably. As he sat and\r\nsmoked and sipped, he thought again of Limerick--the breath of spring\r\nblows the fragrance of the hawthorne, white upon the bough; he hears\r\nthe song of the mavis; he is walking homeward along the black path\r\nthrough the bog, and up the green boreen, and there before him is the\r\nlittle cottage, its thatch held down by sticks and stones, a long ash\r\npole propping up its crumbling gable; there is the mud shed with the\r\nthills of the old cart sticking out of it; the donkey is standing by,\r\nsad as ever; and up the muddy lane little Annie in her bare feet is\r\ndriving the cows to the byre; and then he sees his mother sitting in\r\nthe low doorway, all at once he catches his first whiff of the peat\r\nsmoke, and with the strange spell that odors work upon the memory, it\r\nmakes him a boy again; again he is sheltered on a rainy day in the mud\r\nshed, playing shoot-marbles with Andy Corrigan and Jerry O’Brien; again\r\nhe is in the little chapel with the leaky roof; he sees all the boys\r\nand girls--Mary Cassidy among them--standing on the bare clay floor; he\r\nbrings his bit of stone to kneel on during mass, he even runs out for a\r\npiece of slate to give to Mary, who lays it in the puddle at her feet\r\nand spreads her handkerchief over it before she kneels. And when the\r\nmass is over he will take little Nora--little Nora? He placed his hand\r\nto his forehead in confusion, and then in a gasp it all comes over\r\nhim--Mary is old, Andy and Jerry are old, little Annie is old and he is\r\nold--they are all gone away. He bowed his head.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Nora yearned to go. Should he turn the ward over to Brennan\r\nand take her this spring? He could run for the legislature when he\r\ncame back in the fall; a senator would be elected by the next general\r\nassembly, and the graft would be very good then. The compromise\r\nattracted Malachi, for at once it acquitted him of indecision, a\r\nquality of statesmanship he hated, and kept for him the life of power\r\nthat had become as the very breath of his nostrils. He would have been\r\nhappy but for this stuffy cold, and even as it was he smacked his lips\r\nand fetched a long sigh, as he put down the glass.\r\n\r\nAnd then the door opened, and a chill, wet wind blew in, causing him\r\nto start up out of his chair. He looked to see who it was that thus\r\nbroke upon his reveries--and it was a woman! Now, a woman had never\r\nbeen in Malachi Nolan’s place before. It was a thing he could never\r\ntolerate, if he could ever imagine it even, and he hastily glanced\r\naround to see how many men were at the bar, and who they were. His face\r\nshowed positive alarm. But the woman entered. She was accompanied by\r\na boy, who slouched in behind her, shutting the door at her solicitous\r\ncommand, and halted there, hanging his head. His eyes shifted\r\nsuspiciously under the hat brim that shadowed his sallow, prematurely\r\nwrinkled face; his lips curled in an evil sneer that seemed habitual.\r\n\r\nThe woman fluttered her shawl about her shoulders, clutched it to her\r\nthin breast with one hand, while the other she stretched forth with a\r\nblessing, as it were, for Malachi, and as she spoke, her seamed and\r\nscarred old Irish face, bleached in the steam of many wash-days and\r\nframed in withered black bonnet strings, glowed with the light of\r\nmother-love.\r\n\r\n“Praise be, Mal’chi Nol’n,” she began, in a high voice that immediately\r\nstifled the clinking of glasses and the laughter behind the partition.\r\n“May God bless ye--ye’re th’ foinest man in th’ whole town! To think\r\nof yer l’avin’ th’ laad out th’ way ye did--an’ so soon afther me\r\nhavin’ th’ impidence to ask ye, too--shure a mither’s blessin’ an’ th’\r\nblessin’ of th’ Vargin’ll be on ye fer gettin’ th’ paardon fer ’im.\r\nShtep up here, Jamesy, and t’ank Misther Nol’n yersilf--he’s th’ best\r\nman--”\r\n\r\n“Aw, tut, tut, tut, now, Misthress McGlone,” said Malachi, his face\r\nflaming with something more than the exertion of craning his neck to\r\npeer behind the partition, “tut, tut, now, don’t be goin’ on like that.”\r\n\r\nBut the woman, brave in the one subject upon which she could dispute\r\nthe alderman, persisted:\r\n\r\n“Shure, Mal’chi Nol’n, ye know it yersilf--shtep up here, Jamesy, an’\r\nmake yer t’anks to ’im. Th’ laad’s a bit bashful, ye must excuse ’im,\r\nsor, he’s th’ best b’y ever lived, though it’s mesilf says it p’hat\r\noughtn’t to.”\r\n\r\nThe boy still hung back, but the old woman hitching up the shawl that\r\nwas shamelessly revealing the moth-eaten waist she wore, plucked him\r\nby the sleeve, and dragged him to the rail that separated them from\r\nMalachi. The boy jerked away from his mother’s grasp, yet lifted his\r\nunsteady eyes for an instant to blurt out:\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m much obliged, see?”\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if ashamed of so much politeness, he hung his head and\r\nsqueezed the toe of his shoe between the spokes of the railing. The old\r\nwoman folded her arms in the shawl and gazed on him with a fond smile\r\nthat showed the few loose, yellow teeth that always wobbled in their\r\ngums when she spoke. Presently she turned to Malachi again:\r\n\r\n“Ye mustn’t think haard o’ him, Misther Nol’n, he’s a bit back’ard\r\nshp’akin’ to th’ loikes o’ ye, ye moind, but he’s a good b’y, an’\r\nhe’d never got into throuble if it hadn’t been for this bad comp’ny\r\nhe be’s dhragged into. Shure, he niver shtays out later’n tin o’clock\r\no’ noights widout tellin’ me p’here he’s been. This afthernoon Oi was\r\nshcrubbin’ awaay all alone, an’ who should come in all o’ a suddint but\r\nhim, bless th’ b’y, an’ saay, ‘Ma,’ he says, ‘Alderman Nol’n got me a\r\npaardon an’ Oi--’”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Misthress McGlone--”\r\n\r\n“An’ God’ll bless ye, sor,” the old woman broke in, unable to restrain\r\nthe flood of tears that filled her filmy eyes and zigzagged down her\r\ncheeks. She cried softly a moment, then suddenly looked up in a crafty,\r\ncunning way.\r\n\r\n“They’s wan thing, Misther Nol’n,” she said, “some wan was so good,”\r\nshe looked all about to make sure that none was within hearing, and\r\nlowered her voice to a rough whisper, “as to sind me a ton o’ coal in a\r\npushcaart th’ day. Oi wonder now who could that be?”\r\n\r\nThe alderman raised his heavy face with fine innocence.\r\n\r\n“Where did it come from?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Misther Degnan’s yaards,” the woman answered.\r\n\r\n“Thin I suppose’t was Degnan himsilf sint it.”\r\n\r\n“Aw, there now!” the old woman cried, with the triumph of a vindicated\r\nprophet. “Oi knowed ye’d saay that, Oi knowed ye’d saay that--but,\r\nshure Oi think’t was yersilf done it.”\r\n\r\n“L’ave off, l’ave off, now,” said Malachi almost roughly, “’tis no\r\nplace, do ye mind, fer a woman, an’ no place fer th’ laad.” He gave the\r\nboy a penetrating glance that made the shifting eyes fall suddenly.\r\n“An’ ’tis late--did ye come down on th’ caar?”\r\n\r\nThe old woman’s tears running down her cheeks had left stains in\r\nthe wrinkles, and she began plucking at something under her shawl.\r\nPresently she drew forth a handkerchief folded in a soft little white\r\nsquare, fresh and clean from the iron, and shaking it out she dabbed\r\nat her weak old eyes and wiped away the tear stains. Her voice was a\r\nwhisper again.\r\n\r\n“Aw, Misther Nol’n,” she began, “it’s been a haard winther on the poor,\r\nan’ Oi’ve had to save th’ pinnies, shure they’re scarce enough, an’\r\nth’ laad with no job an’ me a poor widow woman. God forgive me”--her\r\nvoice sank still lower, and into the whisper came a hard, rebellious\r\nnote--“but some noights Oi’ve gone without me supper--”\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t ye tell?” asked Malachi, looking up in concern.\r\n\r\n“Oi’d die first!” she whispered hoarsely, while her wet eyes blazed.\r\n“It’ll niver be said Oi’m a beggar, an’ Oi wouldn’t have tould anny wan\r\nbut you, sor”--she gave him a coaxing smile through her tears, and bent\r\nher head to one side in a way that seemed to recall her girlhood--“an’\r\nmaybe, sor, ye’d not saay annything ’bout it--there’s a good man, now.\r\nOi’ve kep’ up th’ insurance an’ there’ll be enough to give me a dacent\r\nbur’al whin Oi die. Ye’ll excuse me fer”--she stretched a hand from\r\nthe shawl and touched him on the shoulder--“fer runnin’ on loike this,\r\nbut Oi couldn’t shlape th’ noight till Oi’d come down to thank ye--God\r\nbless ye, sor, Oi’ll pray fer ye every noight. We’ll be goin’ now.” She\r\ntook a step toward the door, but turned back again, with that pleading\r\ninclination of the head, that smile, showing her long, wabbling teeth.\r\n\r\n“Ye must excuse me, sor,” she said, “fer throublin’ ye so, but ye’re a\r\nkoind, saft-hearted man--ye couldn’t git th’ laad a job now--shure Oi\r\nknow ye couldn’t--he’s an hones’ b’y an’ a willin’ worker, sor, whin he\r\ncan git annything to do--ye must excuse me, sor.”\r\n\r\nMalachi was deeply chagrined. He actually got up and peeped again\r\naround the corner of the partition, and then said hastily, so as to\r\nclose a painful and scandalous incident:\r\n\r\n“Let th’ b’y come down an’ see me in th’ marnin’, ma’am, an’ here’s a\r\nbit o’ caar fare fer ye. Do ye go now an’ take th’ caar home. ’Tis a\r\nlong waays fer ye to walk, ye niver ought a done it.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman objected at first, but finally consented to accept the\r\ncoin on the basis of a loan, and then, blessing him again and again,\r\ncourtesied herself in an old-fashioned, rheumatic way out of the door.\r\nAnd then Malachi tilted up his glass and drained the last drop. The\r\ntoddy had grown quite cold.\r\n\r\nThe law of moral reaction sent the gang home early that evening, and\r\nby ten o’clock it was plain that the day’s work was done. Malachi had\r\nthe bartender help him on with the frieze overcoat, and was adjusting\r\nhis hat to a skull that still was sore, when the door opened. Malachi\r\nturned with a scowl, when the draft struck him, and saw Sullivan, the\r\nward committeeman, and Brennan, Malachi’s political residuary legatee.\r\nBrennan’s eyes were sparkling merrily, his red face was round with\r\nlaughter, and he came in with a breeze like the March day.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Mal’chi,” he called, smiting the bar with the thick of his\r\nfist, “ain’t goin’ home, are you? It’s just the shank of the evening.\r\nWhat’ll you have?” Then, as one who likes to think he has special\r\nprivileges, he said to the bartender aside: “Give’s a nice little drink\r\nof whisky.”\r\n\r\nMalachi neither moved nor spoke. Brennan felt his coldness and flashed\r\nthe intelligence to Sullivan.\r\n\r\n“Just saw Jim Degnan,” he said, grasping the sweating whisky bottle.\r\n\r\n“You did, did you?” said Malachi, in a challenging tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Brennan, determined to be genial. “He tells me you’re\r\ngoin’ back to Ireland in the spring.”\r\n\r\n“He does, does he?” again challenged Nolan.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you tell ’im?”\r\n\r\n“If I did, did I tell ’im phat spring?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I s’posed as a matter of course he meant this spring.”\r\n\r\nBrennan bent over to measure his drink and to hide some confusion. “And\r\nI thought--you know what you said, Mal’chi--I was goin’ to have Mike\r\nhere call the convention and round up the nomination--”\r\n\r\n“Th’ hell you was! Th’--hell--you--was!” Malachi’s growing amazement\r\nlengthened the pauses between his words.\r\n\r\n“Why, didn’t you say you’d t’row the nomination to me when you quit?”\r\n\r\nBrennan’s color deepened to an angry red.\r\n\r\n“Did ye iver see such narve!” said Malachi, ignoring the question.\r\n“Mike’ll call th’ convintion fer soon enough, but whin I’m not a\r\ncandydate in me own waard, I’ll tell ye mesilf, Willum Brennan.”\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t get mad about it, Mal’chi,” said Brennan, who was getting\r\nmad himself. He shoved the bottle on to Sullivan, and blinked his\r\nsmall eyelids a moment. “Of course, Mal’chi, it’s just as you say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now, ye’re talkin’, Willum.” Malachi never could brook anything\r\nlike interference in his ruling of the First Ward. “Whin I’m done,\r\nye can have th’ nomination, same’s I told ye, but this spring I’m a\r\ncandydate mesilf, do ye mind that now?” He drew closer to the bar in\r\nhis softened humor, and now that the question at last had been decided,\r\nand in the only way it could have been decided, he suddenly became\r\nhimself again.\r\n\r\n“When do you want the convention called for, Mr. Nolan?” asked Sullivan.\r\n\r\n“Sathurday,” replied Malachi promptly.\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, same as usual--in the back ind of th’ plaace here.” Malachi jerked\r\nhis thick thumb toward the rear end of the saloon, where the gloom was\r\ndeep. “Prim’ries fer Friday.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Sullivan.\r\n\r\nThen no one spoke for a while. Finally, however, Brennan said, in a\r\nhesitating way:\r\n\r\n“If you’re goin’ back to the council, Mal’chi, what’s the matter with\r\nme takin’ the legislative nomination in the district?”\r\n\r\n“It’s time enough to saay good marnin’ to th’ divil whin ye meet ’im,\r\nWillum.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence again, until Brennan said:\r\n\r\n“Well, I can’t help thinkin’ it’s a fine trip to Ireland you’re losin’.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis so,” assented Malachi.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” sighed Brennan. And he saw his ambition pass from him. But\r\npresently he was saying in his old, cheery tone:\r\n\r\n“Ain’t you goin’ to take somethin’?”\r\n\r\nMalachi leaned his big body against his bar, and over his shoulder, out\r\nof the corner of his mouth, he said:\r\n\r\n“Seegaar.”\r\n\r\nThe bartender slid the box along the counter and rang up another ten\r\ncents on the cash register.\r\n\r\n“Well, here’s lookin’ at you,” said Brennan, raising the little tumbler.\r\n\r\n“Dhrink heaarty,” said Malachi Nolan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long day was done, and Malachi, in shirt-sleeves and stockinged\r\nfeet, sat in his big plush rocking-chair, his legs stretched out\r\nbefore him, taking his ease at his own hearth. When he had come home at\r\nmidnight, Nora, who always sat up for him, had insisted upon brewing\r\nhim a cup of tea, under the impression, common to a certain class\r\nof women, that it has great medicinal qualities. Malachi had sipped\r\nit obediently, though he had not cared for it after all the mineral\r\nwaters he had drunk that day, and had enjoyed far more than the tea the\r\nfreckled Irish face of his daughter, as he gravely goggled at her over\r\nthe rim of the saucer into which he had poured the beverage to cool\r\nit. They were in what Malachi called the parlor of their flat, though\r\nNora had lately taken to calling it the drawing-room. It was furnished\r\nmostly in pieces upholstered in plush. Over the mantelpiece hung a\r\nlarge crayon portrait of a woman whose face, despite the insipidity the\r\ncanvasing artist had given it, still showed the toil she had endured,\r\nif it told little of her strong character, while that disregard for\r\nexpense which was expressed in the gilt frame marked it as a memorial\r\nof the dead. It was, of course, the face of Malachi’s wife, and when\r\nNora, in her new culture, had hinted at hanging it in his bedroom, she\r\nhad, for the first time in her life, quailed before that stubborn\r\nspirit with which her father ruled the First Ward. The few books on\r\nthe center-table treated mostly of religious subjects, though there\r\nwere queer bound volumes of Irish poetry, and on the wall there were\r\none or two etchings in oaken frames. In a corner was a crucifix with a\r\ncandle before it. But the one object in the room that dominated all the\r\nrest with its aggressive worldliness, was an upright piano, and Nora\r\nnow sat swinging on the stool, her back to the instrument, her elbows\r\nbehind her on the keys. She had partly prepared for bed, for she wore a\r\nflannel wrapper and her brilliant black hair hung in a braid down her\r\nback. Celtic blue eyes lighted up her face, and now they smiled under\r\ntheir long, black lashes upon this big saloon-keeper whom half the city\r\nfeared, as if the simple sight of him were reward enough for her long\r\nhours of waiting.\r\n\r\nMalachi finished his cup of tea and hurriedly inserted a cigar in the\r\nhole at the corner of his mouth, and thus confirmed in comfort, he said:\r\n\r\n“Nora, child, do ye sing now--phat was that--it wint hummin’ t’rough me\r\nhead th’ daay. Well, well, well, let me see now--hum-m-m-m--it goes\r\nsomething like--”\r\n\r\nAnd he hummed a quavering old tune:\r\n\r\n  “‘I saw the Shannon’s purple flood\r\n    Flow by the Irish town.’”\r\n\r\nThen he stopped and shook his grizzled head. “Shure, now, I’m\r\nforgettin’ it intirely; ye know, though, somethin’ about:\r\n\r\n  “‘Whin down the glin rode Sarsfield’s min,\r\n    And they wore the jackets green.’\r\n\r\n“Sing it onct, fer th’ ould man.”\r\n\r\n“But, father,” the girl laughed, though she began screwing up the piano\r\nstool, “it’s too late, the neighbors will object.”\r\n\r\n“Niver mind th’ neighbors,” commanded the alderman in the tone he used\r\nat a primary, “sing it.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s forbidden in the lease after ten o’clock,” the girl\r\nprotested, leafing over her music. “What if the landlord--”\r\n\r\n“It’s time to say good marnin’ to th’ divil, Nora, whin ye meet ’im.”\r\n\r\nNora fixed herself on the stool, fingered the keys, finding a soft\r\nminor chord. The old man closed his eyes, slid farther down in his\r\nplush chair, and just as he was prepared to listen, she suddenly\r\nstopped in the provoking way amateur musicians cultivate, to say:\r\n\r\n“But, father, that’s such an old song, wouldn’t you rather I’d sing the\r\nIntermezzo from _Cavalerie_?”\r\n\r\nMalachi opened his eyes with a start and sat bolt upright.\r\n\r\n“Naw,” he said, “none o’ thim fur’n op’res--phat’s the use of yer goin’\r\nto th’ convint all those years?” But his voice quickly softened. “Do ye\r\ngo on now, Nora, darlin’, there’s a good gur-rl.”\r\n\r\nAnd so she sang, and the alderman sank in his chair, with his big arms\r\nin their shirt-sleeves thrown over his head, closed his eyes again,\r\nstretched out his stockinged feet. The smoke from his cigar ascended\r\nto the chandelier, and now and then when he remembered the words of a\r\nline, he hummed them behind closed lips, in unison with his daughter.\r\nWhen the song was done Nora whirled around, clasped her hands in a\r\nschool-girl’s ecstasy and said:\r\n\r\n“Oh, father, that song makes me homesick--homesick for a place I never\r\nsaw. You won’t run again, will you, father, will you? And we’ll go to\r\nIreland in the spring, won’t we? Tell me, in the spring?”\r\n\r\nA pain struck through Malachi Nolan’s heart, a pain that was made only\r\nmore poignant when, with her American fear of the sentimental, Nora\r\njoked:\r\n\r\n“I must see our ancestral cabin.”\r\n\r\nMalachi could not open his eyes. For once he was afraid. He did not\r\nmove for a long time. But at last he sighed and set his jaw, and said:\r\n\r\n“Well, Nora--if ye saay so--in the spring.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMalachi Nolan sat bolt upright in his seat in the Pullman. He was\r\nclothed in his decent black suit, and he wore his black cravat tucked\r\nstiffly under the collar that so tightly bound his thick, red neck. On\r\nhis glossy shirt front the great diamond, four carats in weight, rose\r\nand fell with his heavy breathing. At his feet was a new yellow valise;\r\nbeside him, wedging him tightly into his seat, was Nora’s luggage, her\r\nnew bag, the roll of steamer rugs, her little umbrella, her plaid cape,\r\nand all the things she had got at the suggestion of friends who were\r\ninterested in her journey across the sea to Ireland. Nora, in her new\r\ntraveling gown, was prettier than Malachi had ever seen her. She sat in\r\nthe front seat of the section, leaning against the double window, her\r\nelbow on its narrow sill, her chin meditatively in her palm. There had\r\nbeen some talk between them as the heavy train pulled out of the Van\r\nBuren Street station, and in the bustle of getting away, of arranging\r\nher bags and her bundles, and all that, Nora had beamed with pleasure,\r\nand a fine and happy excitement had sparkled through the long, black\r\nlashes of her blue Irish eyes. But as the train plunged recklessly\r\nout through the bewildering yards, she had noticed her father casting\r\nwistful glances at this or that familiar object sweeping so swiftly and\r\nirrevocably away. There was the Harrison Street police station which\r\nhe had visited on so many mornings to help some poor devil out of the\r\ntoils; the shops shutting down for the night, their workers trooping\r\nhomeward, dead tired after the long hours; the Twelfth Street viaduct,\r\nmarking the limits of his ward; the slips in the south branch of the\r\ndirty Chicago River, where big schooners still lay torpid at their\r\nwinter moorings, the crossings at Sixteenth Street, then the dear old\r\nArchey Road. A silence had fallen upon him that reacted upon her, and\r\nshe grew still, and rode on in the swaying train, gazing soberly out\r\nupon the ragged edges of that Chicago she was leaving behind for the\r\nfirst time in her life.\r\n\r\nThe black porter, in spotless white jacket, was going through the car\r\nwith his stool, pulling down the inverted globes of the lamps with his\r\nventilating stick and lighting the four little gas-jets; the travelers\r\nin the car were settling themselves accustomedly for the long ride to\r\nNew York, there was even a prospect of some cheer in the dinner which\r\nwas soon to be served in the dining-car, but the alderman seemed not to\r\nnotice any of these things.\r\n\r\nMalachi had never traveled much. His only trips had been those biennial\r\nones to Springfield, when he had headed the First Ward delegation to\r\nthe state conventions; sometimes he had gone down there while the\r\nlegislature was in session; and once he had journeyed to Washington\r\nwith the Marching Club to attend the inauguration ceremonies. But that\r\nwas all. On these trips he had gone with his own kind, and doubtless\r\nenjoyed them, but now, this evening, it was plain that he was not\r\ncomfortable. He could not smoke, for one thing, and the round hole in\r\nthe corner of his mouth looked forlorn in its present lack of a cigar.\r\nHe must have thought, once or twice, of escaping to the smoking-room,\r\nbut each time he had remembered Nora, and so had sat on, heavy,\r\nimponderable and solemn.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the porter got the little lights to burning, and they\r\nillumed, though inadequately, the long coach, its heavy trappings, its\r\nbell cord, the suspended hats and wraps swaying from side to side, as\r\nit creaked and groaned over so many switches and curves and crossings\r\nto get out of town. They rushed by mills, with furnaces blazing like\r\ninfernos in the gathering twilight, and black, stubby chimneys lighting\r\nthe dull sky with flames; at last they were in the outskirts where the\r\ncity helplessly degenerates into naked flat buildings, finally, into\r\nlow cottages scattered here and there in little broken rows, with high\r\nboard-walks in front of them.\r\n\r\nThen Malachi, stooping painfully, unbuckled his new valise and took\r\nfrom it a newspaper. Before he unfolded it, he drew out his spectacles\r\nand calmly adjusted them to his nose. Then opening the paper he began\r\nto read. He read carefully and slowly, first the front page, column\r\nafter column, then the second page, and so on, methodically, through\r\nall the pages. His lips moved slightly as he read, for he had to\r\npronounce the words to himself to get their full meaning. When Malachi\r\nhad read to the last line of the last column of the last page of his\r\nnewspaper, he did not fold and lay it aside. He turned back to the\r\nfirst page and studied the picture there. It was the daily cartoon, and\r\nthe central figure was intended for Malachi himself. That there could\r\nbe no question of identity, the prudent artist had labeled it “Bull\r\nNolan.” The figure was one that Malachi had seen in the papers, in\r\nvarying situations, for years, with the aldermanic paunch, the massive\r\nchain and charm, the bullet head, the stubble of hair, the bell-crowned\r\nhat, the braided plaid clothes, broad-soled shoes and checkered spats,\r\nthe briskly radiating lines to symbolize the diamond. But at last the\r\ninevitable cigar had gone out, the First Ward no longer peeped on a\r\nballot, secure and safe, from his waistcoat pocket. The gentleman with\r\nhigh hat, side whiskers, gloves and cane, who, labeled “Citizen,”\r\nimpersonated the better element, had it now, and while he was still\r\nself-contained, there was a look of almost holy triumph in his face.\r\n\r\nMalachi studied the cartoon a long time, never changing expression. But\r\neven when he finished he did not fold the paper carefully and put it\r\nback in his valise, nor bestow his spectacles in his waistcoat pocket.\r\nHe had suffered many lapses in his methodical habits of late, and they\r\nwere growing easy now. He turned to the editorial page, where a line in\r\nbig types, heading a leading editorial, had caught his little eye. It\r\nsaid: “The Passing of Malachi Nolan.” Malachi began to read, slowly and\r\ncarefully, pronouncing each word to himself:\r\n\r\n  “Citizens not only of the First Ward, but of the entire city, are to\r\n  be congratulated upon the signal victory the Municipal Reform League\r\n  has won in its campaign against Malachi Nolan. This man, who so long\r\n  has misrepresented the ward mentioned in the city council, has at\r\n  last been dislodged, and driven to the obscurity of private life,\r\n  where his pernicious and dangerous tendencies, if not altogether\r\n  abated, will at least be confined to a narrower sphere of activity.\r\n  In announcing his retirement from politics, he gives as a reason\r\n  his desire to pay a visit to his native land, but the public, while\r\n  speeding his departure, will readily penetrate the gauzy excuse\r\n  he advances for it. They know that he has been forced to fly from\r\n  a field rendered utterly untenable by the onslaughts of those\r\n  public-spirited gentlemen who at great personal sacrifice have so\r\n  freely contributed of their means, their energies and their time to\r\n  the work of the Municipal Reform League, and to them and the press\r\n  they will ascribe the credit and the praise. It would seem, however,\r\n  that the Honorable Bull Nolan has lost none of his presumption, for\r\n  he insolently declares that he leaves as his personal representative\r\n  and successor in the aldermanic chair one of his henchmen, William\r\n  Brennan. But the people will take care of Mr. Brennan at the proper\r\n  time. They will see to it that Nolan’s successor shall not be a man\r\n  whose political methods are such as will enable him to take vacation\r\n  trips in Europe, and with the abundant encouragement they have now\r\n  received, will continue to widen this breach already made in the\r\n  walls of corruption and dishonesty and carry on the splendid work for\r\n  good government and honest politics--”\r\n\r\nMalachi did not read any further. The lights in the car were poor,\r\nafter all, and then, his eyes were not so good as they used to be.\r\nHe folded the paper carefully, looked all about, then hid it at last\r\nbehind him. Then he bestowed his spectacles in his waistcoat pocket,\r\nand, like Nora, looked out of the window. They had gone through South\r\nChicago, they had passed One-hundredth Street. They looked out now\r\nupon the dull prairies that sprawled flat all about them, with no sign\r\nof spring as yet, but dead and desolate, broken only by a black and\r\nstunted tree here or there. At wide, wide intervals a lonely gas lamp\r\ntwinkled bravely in a legal way as if to preserve the prescription of\r\nwhat was only technically a street. The prairies stretched away until\r\nthey faded into the gray gloom of the March evening, and they had left\r\nChicago at last behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARDON OF THOMAS WHALEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe private secretary turned reluctantly from his open window beside\r\nwhich the trees bathed their young leaves in the sparkling sunshine of\r\nthe June morning to confront the throng that awaited audience with the\r\ngovernor. The throng was larger than usual, for the state convention\r\nwas to be held on the morrow. Every county in the state was represented\r\nin the crowd that trampled the red carpet, crushed the leather chairs\r\nand blew the smoke of campaign cigars into the solemn faces of former\r\ngovernors standing in their massive gilt frames with their hands\r\non ponderous law books. In one corner a woman huddled, pinching a\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes. Now and then she sobbed aloud. When Leonard\r\nGilman, the private secretary, saw her he knew it at once for a pardon\r\ncase, and paid no further attention to her. Big countrymen in Sunday\r\nclothes, who wore the red badges of delegates, slapped him on the back,\r\ncity ward-heelers of checkered lives and garments called him “Len.”\r\n\r\nThere was an odor of perspiration in the room, distinguishable even in\r\nthe heavy fumes of tobacco. The real leaders, of course, William Handy\r\nand the others, were over at the executive mansion, with the governor,\r\ncompleting the final arrangements for his renomination. The governor\r\nheld the convention in the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\nThe woman huddled in her corner until eleven o’clock, and then Gilman,\r\nhappening into her quarter of the room, asked her what she wanted,\r\nlistening with official respect for her reply. It was an old story to\r\nhim. When she told him he smiled a strange smile and turned away. At\r\nnoon the governor ran the gauntlet of the waiting crowd and gained\r\nthe sanctuary of his private office. Once there, breathing a sigh of\r\nrelief, he stood for a moment in one of the tall windows looking out\r\nupon the smooth lawns stretching lazily in the sun, and rolling away\r\nto the elms surrounding the state house. He was a tall man and strong.\r\nIf he had a physical fault, it was that he carried his head too low,\r\ndenoting him a thinker, but if his gaze was fixed upon the earth,\r\nhis thoughts were in the stars. Presently he shook his splendid head\r\nvigorously, wrapped his long coat determinedly about him, and settled\r\nhimself at his desk.\r\n\r\nGilman entered, bearing a pile of papers demanding the governor’s\r\npersonal attention, but the morning conference was very brief on this\r\nday. As Gilman turned to go, the governor said:\r\n\r\n“I desire to be alone to-day. I have that speech of acceptance to\r\nwrite. If Handy comes, send him in, but no one else.”\r\n\r\nGilman laid his hand upon the door-knob and the governor asked:\r\n\r\n“No one of importance out there, is there?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Gilman. “There’s a woman--what do you think she wants?”\r\n\r\n“A pardon, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but for whom? You’d never guess in a thousand years.” Gilman was\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“Then tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Tom Whalen!” Gilman laughed at the humor of it.\r\n\r\nThe governor’s features relaxed with a smile, but quickly his brow\r\ncontracted again, and he said:\r\n\r\n“Well--poor things--I pity them. I could wash my hands in women’s tears\r\nevery week.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Gilman, opening the door, “I told her she could see you.\r\nI’ll slide her out.”\r\n\r\nThe governor bent to his desk, but just as the door was closing he\r\ncalled:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Gilman!”\r\n\r\nGilman stopped.\r\n\r\n“Don’t do that--tell her I’ll see her after a while.”\r\n\r\nGilman, as he returned to his desk, smiled and shook his head at the\r\ngovernor’s weakness.\r\n\r\nThomas Whalen was a life convict in the penitentiary. The crime was\r\ncommitted on the night of the election at which John Chatham had\r\nbeen chosen chief executive of his state. Whalen was a boss in the\r\nnineteenth ward and a Chatham man. The campaign had developed such\r\nbitterness that Whalen found it necessary to name himself a judge of\r\nelection in the fourth precinct of his ward. Many times during the day\r\nblue patrol wagons had rolled into the precinct.\r\n\r\nThe polling place of the fourth precinct was a small barber shop\r\nin Fifteenth Street. During the evening, as the ballots were being\r\ncounted, it had become apparent that an altercation was in progress\r\nbehind the yellow blinds. It was abruptly terminated by a shot. The\r\nlights in the shop were extinguished at the same moment. A man burst\r\nfrom the door and fled. When the police arrived, they found a dead\r\nelection judge face downward on the table. His name had been Brokoski.\r\nThe bullet had passed entirely through his body, and reddened with\r\nhis blood the ballots that gushed from the overturned box. The window\r\nat his back had been completely shattered by the ball as it flew out\r\ninto the alley. This was a large bullet, a thirty-eight caliber. The\r\npolice found a revolver gleaming in the light of the dark lanterns\r\nthey flashed down the alley. It was a thirty-eight caliber with one\r\nempty chamber. It was evident that the murderer had discarded it in\r\nhis flight. A lieutenant of police at the Market Place police station\r\neasily identified the gun as one he had given to Whalen several weeks\r\npreviously. The judges and clerks had rushed after Whalen. The shock,\r\nthe sudden failure of light, the horror of the dead man in the dark had\r\njangled their nerves. They were too excited to give a clear account\r\nof the affair. They knew that Whalen and Brokoski, sitting on opposite\r\nsides of the table, had been quarreling. They had heard the shot, had\r\nbeen blinded by the flash, and had seen Whalen bolt. Brokoski had\r\nfallen heavily upon the table, and died with an oath upon his lips.\r\n\r\nGilman never forgot that wild night. He had spent it with the governor\r\nat the headquarters of the state central committee. In the dawn, when\r\nthe east was yellowing, and sparrows began to scuffle and splutter on\r\nthe eaves of the federal building looming dour just over the way, the\r\nnews of the murder and frauds had come to them. The governor’s face,\r\nwhite with excitement and fatigue, had suddenly darkened. Had it been\r\nthe shadow cast by the passing of a great ambition?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the close of the long day the woman, beckoned by Gilman into the\r\ngovernor’s presence, lingered on the threshold of the chamber. The room\r\nwas full of shadows. The figure of the governor, standing in the tall\r\nwindow, shut out the waning light, and was silhouetted, big and black,\r\nagainst the twilight sky. He did not hear the woman enter. She coughed\r\nto attract his attention. This did not arouse him from his reverie, and\r\nafter a moment’s timid hesitation, she said:\r\n\r\n“May I come in?”\r\n\r\nThe governor turned. “Be seated, madam,” he said. “I shall be quite\r\nfrank with you. I am acquainted with this case, and do not believe it\r\nto be one justifying executive clemency.”\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke her voice was tremulous.\r\n\r\n“Will you hear my story?”\r\n\r\n“You may proceed,” the governor replied. He had pushed the papers aside\r\nand was drumming lightly with his long, white fingers on his desk.\r\n\r\nThe woman nervously pleated her handkerchief, fearing to begin. “You\r\nmust excuse me,” she said presently, “I can not tell my story very\r\nwell. I do not come here for mercy or anything like that. It is only a\r\nmatter of justice.”\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the gloom, she might have seen a smile steal\r\nover the face of the dark figure at the desk. Once plunged into her\r\nnarrative, her words flowed rapidly, until--suddenly she ceased to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“That was five years ago,” she said, her voice dropping to a sadly\r\nreminiscent whisper. “We were to have been married that spring, but--I\r\nwould rather not tell the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe woman probably felt her cheeks flush with warmth.\r\n\r\nThe governor could hear her quick breathing. In a minute he said kindly:\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated an instant, and then fairly blurted out the rest\r\nof her tale. The governor, through the darkness, saw the woman lean,\r\npanting, toward him. Convulsively she pressed her hands to her face.\r\nShe collapsed in tears. When her sobs became more regular, though still\r\nlabored, the governor said:\r\n\r\n“And Whalen--he knew this?”\r\n\r\n“He must have known.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did he not tell?”\r\n\r\nThe woman hung her head and said, in a low voice:\r\n\r\n“I was mistaken, sir. The other woman lied.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I see.” The governor turned and looked out of the windows. The\r\nold-fashioned iron lamps on the broad steps that led up to the state\r\nhouse were blinking in the dark trees, and the arc light swinging\r\nin the street swayed the shadows of their foliage back and forth on\r\nthe white walks. A flash of heat lightning quivered over the purple\r\noutlines of the elms.\r\n\r\nThe governor sat for a long time in somber silence. The woman could\r\nhear the ticking of his watch. Presently he drew it from his pocket and\r\nstruck a match.\r\n\r\n“It is growing late,” he said. “The tale you tell is a very remarkable\r\ntale. My time is so fully occupied that it will be impossible for me to\r\ndevote any thought to it just now. If you will leave your address with\r\nmy secretary I shall communicate with you. Meanwhile--do not talk.”\r\n\r\nWhen the private secretary had conducted the woman from the room the\r\ngovernor went to his window. The voices of the June night floated up to\r\nhim, but he no longer heard their music. For the second time, at the\r\nname of Whalen, and even in the darkness, there swept over his face the\r\nshadow of the passing of a great ambition.\r\n\r\nThe convention met. The secretary never got down to _S_ in calling the\r\nroll of counties, and the governor was renominated by acclamation. But\r\nnever in all the exciting scenes of those two days, in the black moment\r\nof suspense before the roll-call began, in the white instant of agony\r\npending the poll of the Richland County delegation, in the golden hour\r\nof triumph, when he stood pale and bending before the mad applause\r\nrolling up to him in mighty billows, did he forget the name of Thomas\r\nWhalen, or did the face of that woman pass from him. They followed him\r\npersistently, they glimmered in his dreams. There was no escape from\r\ntheir pursuit.\r\n\r\nAfter a week in which he found no ease, with the determination\r\nthat characterized him when once aroused, he undertook a judicial\r\ninvestigation of the case. He obtained a transcript of record, and read\r\nit as carefully as if he had been retained in the case and sought error\r\nupon which to carry it to the supreme court. In the familiar work he\r\nfound for a time relief.\r\n\r\nGilman, meanwhile, had forgotten the incident of the woman’s visit.\r\nThe idea of pardoning Tom Whalen was too preposterous to merit\r\nserious consideration. But, when the governor told him to go to\r\nthe penitentiary and interview Whalen, and then to the city and the\r\nlocality of the crime for the purpose of learning all he could about\r\nBrokoski’s death, he damned himself for having mentioned the fact of\r\nthe woman’s presence on that crowded, tobacco-clogged, perspiring\r\nmorning. And as he left the capitol he resolved that his visit should\r\nbe astonishingly barren of results.\r\n\r\nInside the warden’s private office at the penitentiary he saw Whalen.\r\nThe man had found the convict’s friend, consumption, and Gilman hardly\r\nknew him. When the private secretary told him of the application for\r\nhis pardon, Whalen only smiled. Gilman found him strangely reticent,\r\nand after an effort to induce him to talk, said:\r\n\r\n“Whalen, really now, did you kill Brokoski?”\r\n\r\nThe striped convict picked at the cap he held in his lap. A bitter\r\nsmile wrinkled his pale, moist face.\r\n\r\n“Suspected again, eh?” he said, without looking up.\r\n\r\nFinally Whalen tired of the examination. He breathed with difficulty,\r\nbut that may have been due to his disease. At last he raised his shaven\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Gilman,” he said, “I see what you’re getting at. I have told you\r\nI did not commit the crime for which I am here. For that matter, any\r\nof the three thousand other prisoners within these walls and wearing\r\nthese clothes will tell you the same thing. I don’t know whether you\r\nbelieve me or not. It doesn’t make much difference. It doesn’t matter\r\nwhat becomes of me any more. I ain’t long for this world. So just let\r\nit drop--what’s the use of opening it up again?”\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t answered my question,” said Gilman, interested in\r\nspite of himself, for a great fear was growing up within him; “you have\r\nnot told me who did kill Brokoski.”\r\n\r\nThe convict lifted his eyelids slowly, and fastened his vision upon his\r\ninterlocutor. And then he said very deliberately and distinctly:\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Gilman, and I never will!”\r\n\r\nGilman left the penitentiary with more than its gloom upon him. He\r\ndeclined the warden’s effusive invitation to stay to dinner. He wanted\r\nto get away. He could not forget the shine in Whalen’s eyes. And the\r\nfear within possessed him.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the city, after dining at the chop house where his old\r\nfriends foregathered, he went out to Fifteenth Street. Costello had\r\nsold his barber shop, and the place had become a saloon. The saloon\r\nwas quiet that night. Gilman drank with the bartender, and, of course,\r\ntalked about the Brokoski killing. The bartender had made a study of\r\nthat case, and discussed it with the curled lip of the specialist.\r\n\r\n“They didn’t do a t’ing to Tom but t’row the hooks into ’im all right,\r\nall right. It was a case of him in the stripes from the start. Say,\r\nthem lawyer guys and fly-cops’d frost you.”\r\n\r\nThen carefully locating the actors in the tragedy, he reproduced it\r\nvividly before Gilman’s eyes. Brokoski had faced the wall where the\r\nhole was. Whalen’s back had been to it. Brokoski had sat with his back\r\nto the window. The barkeeper plunged his red hands into a drawer,\r\nrattled a corkscrew, a knife, a revolver and a jigger, and then drew\r\nout a small piece of lead. It was a thirty-eight caliber bullet.\r\n\r\n“That’s the boy that done Brokoski,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get it?” asked Gilman, with the mild awe a curio excites\r\nin men.\r\n\r\nThe bartender pointed to a ragged hole in the wainscoting.\r\n\r\n“Dug it out o’ there with the icepick. I’m a Sherlock, see? Sure,” he\r\nsneered, “it might ’a’ bounced off the Polock’s breast.”\r\n\r\nThe man wiped his towel over the bar in disgust.\r\n\r\nThen seriously:\r\n\r\n“On the dead, Mr. Gilman, if Tom had his rights, he’d be sent back to\r\nthe ward to die.”\r\n\r\nGilman was troubled. He returned in the morning and examined the\r\npremises carefully. At two-twenty that afternoon he was on the Limited,\r\nflying back to the capital.\r\n\r\nThat evening he was sitting with the governor in the library of the\r\nexecutive mansion. The windows were open and the odor of lilacs was\r\nborne in from the summer night. A negro who had served half a dozen\r\ngovernors, shuffled into the room, bearing a tray.\r\n\r\n“That’s excellent whisky,” observed the private secretary.\r\n\r\n“That was excellent whisky, Gilman,” said the governor, “before you\r\nwere born.”\r\n\r\nThe private secretary was rolling a cigarette. He rolled it with\r\nunusual deliberation, licking the rice paper many times before trusting\r\nhimself to paste it down.\r\n\r\nThe governor bit the end from a black cigar. A blazing match passed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThen Gilman told of his interview with Whalen. He did not display much\r\nspirit in the telling. When he had done, he flecked the ash from his\r\ncigarette in a thoughtful way. Resting his forearms on his knees, he\r\nregarded the floor between his feet.\r\n\r\n“Has it ever struck you as peculiar,” he said, “that the bullet was not\r\nintroduced in evidence?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the governor, “not very.”\r\n\r\nThe private secretary paused. When he had done he laughed. The governor\r\nwas seriously silent for many minutes, and then he said:\r\n\r\n“Leonard, I want you to tell me your theory of this whole business.”\r\n\r\nGilman sat up. “Well,” he said, “had it never occurred to you that it\r\nwould have been significant to determine where that bullet lodged as\r\nshowing its direction? It bored a hole clear through Brokoski, but at\r\nwhich end had it entered?”\r\n\r\n“I presume the medical testimony settled that,” replied the governor.\r\nHe seemed to find a species of relief in this thought.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Gilman said, “but the medical testimony was bad. It consisted\r\nof the conclusions of a young doctor who examined Brokoski’s body\r\nafter it had grown cold. He accepted Whalen’s guilt as an established\r\nfact. He assumed that the bullet entered at the breast. There was then\r\nnothing to do but to trace its course through the tissues of the body.\r\nIf his views were correct, the ball would have lodged somewhere behind\r\nBrokoski.”\r\n\r\n“But it flew out into the alley,” argued the governor, “and shattered\r\nthe window in doing so.”\r\n\r\n“True,” assented Gilman, “and yet you assume all the while that Whalen\r\nfired the shot. Of course the circumstances attending the tragedy, the\r\noccasion, the quarrel, Whalen’s flight, and the finding of his gun,\r\nlent strong color to that presumption.”\r\n\r\n“But the shattered window,” the governor interpolated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the shattered window. Now,” he continued, “a surgeon,\r\nexperienced in gunshot wounds, might have been able to distinguish\r\nin such a wound as Brokoski’s, the point of the missile’s entrance\r\nfrom the point of exit. Of course it is not certain. The youth the\r\npolice called did not think such an inquiry important, whereas it was\r\nvital. A pistol fired point-blank at a man would blacken his breast\r\nwith powder. The velocity of the ball, fired at such range might have\r\nbeen sufficient to knock the man over backward, instead of allowing\r\nhim to fall upon his face as he did. Then, there’s the window. It was\r\nshattered, the police said, by the ball. Even the glass in the upper\r\nsash was broken. The frame on the outside was blackened by powder, the\r\nstains even now being visible. Now, a bullet flying the distance it\r\nmust have traversed between Whalen’s hand and the window, would, in all\r\nprobability, simply have perforated the glass with a round, clean hole.\r\nBut the weapon having been fired in close proximity, the concussion\r\nshattered the whole window.”\r\n\r\nAfter a silence Gilman resumed:\r\n\r\n“Now then, assume that the bullet entered Brokoski’s back and emerged\r\nfrom his breast. The conclusion deduced from the circumstances I have\r\nsuggested, is impregnable when that bullet is located in a position in\r\nfront of Brokoski.”\r\n\r\nDuring the recital the governor lay in his deep chair, his arms across\r\nhis breast, his finger-tips together. He regarded Gilman through\r\nhalf-closed eyes. A thoughtful observer would have said that he had\r\nheard the essential elements of the tale before. When he spoke, after a\r\nsilence which had begun to annoy the private secretary, he said:\r\n\r\n“Well, your hypothesis is tenable. In fact, it is one of the prettiest\r\ncases I ever saw put together.”\r\n\r\nGilman stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n“But did you learn anything as to the identity of the person, who, if\r\nyour suppositions are correct, killed Brokoski?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the weak point,” Gilman promptly admitted. “A sufficient motive\r\nis utterly lacking, if we eliminate partisan hatred. It was shown that\r\nWhalen killed him in an impulse of passion, and that alone saved him\r\nfrom the death penalty. But I feel that my reasoning is valid. The\r\nconviction was strengthened by Whalen’s manner and expression the other\r\nday. He never killed Brokoski, I tell you.” Gilman smote his thigh for\r\nemphasis. “Why he chooses to die in prison a silent martyr I don’t\r\nknow--but the woman does.”\r\n\r\nThe governor assumed a sitting posture.\r\n\r\n“Damn it!” exclaimed Gilman, after a momentary silence, “if those\r\nstupid police had examined the mud in the alley beneath the window that\r\nnight, they would have found tracks that would have changed the course\r\nof this whole business.”\r\n\r\nThe governor bent farther forward, burying himself in an intense\r\nconcentration of mind. For a time interminable to Gilman, he sat thus.\r\nHis cigar went out. The ice in his glass melted, spun on the crystal\r\nbrim, and sank with a tiny splash and tinkle. The little pile of burned\r\ncigarettes, the black ends of consumed cigars, the mass of tobacco ash\r\ndeposited in a whisky glass, absorbed its tepid liquid, and stunk.\r\nThe room grew chill, and the mists of the fountain which played in\r\nmournful solitude beneath the rocking elms in the grounds, permeated\r\nthe atmosphere. The brooding night added her terrors and her cares.\r\n\r\nGilman took a sip of liquor, lighted a fresh cigarette, rose, and\r\nwalked up and down the room. He thought of the election, so near at\r\nhand. He looked at the governor bowed there before him. What was\r\nWhalen, or the woman, or anybody to him? Let the prisoner die! What\r\nwas he to the governor? John Chatham’s party needed him, his country\r\nneeded him, his time needed him, mankind and human progress needed\r\nhim. If he pardoned Whalen, what was to become of him? The conviction\r\nof Brokoski’s murderer alone could save him from such apparent\r\nstultification, here on the eve of an election at which, in the foolish\r\nphrase of modern politics, he sought vindication. Was this conviction\r\npossible? The bare thought halted Gilman beside the governor. He laid a\r\nhand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“These abstruse propositions wouldn’t stand before a jury in a criminal\r\ncourt,” he said. “Let Whalen stay.”\r\n\r\nThe governor lifted his head.\r\n\r\n“But you just now said that he was not Brokoski’s murderer.”\r\n\r\nGilman hesitated. When he spoke, he said:\r\n\r\n“A jury of twelve sworn men has said that he is.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days after the private secretary’s return, the newspapers were full\r\nof stories concerning his movements. Whalen’s picture was exploited,\r\ncorrespondents sought the governor for interviews, and the _Courier_\r\ncharged that, in his desperation, he intended to pardon Whalen, that\r\nhe might have, in his campaign, the assistance of that skilled and\r\nunscrupulous manipulator. The pack of country newspapers took up the\r\n_Courier’s_ cry. Whalen’s illness was either ignored, or referred to as\r\nfeigned, at the direction of prison authorities and the governor. And\r\nyet a certificate pigeonholed in Gilman’s desk, signed by the prison\r\nphysician, stated that Thomas Whalen had pulmonary tuberculosis and was\r\nin a moribund condition.\r\n\r\nIn his office in the city William Handy, the chairman of the state\r\ncentral committee, read these newspaper stories, and swore as he did\r\nso. That night the shrewdest and maddest politician in the state stole\r\nout of town. The next morning Gilman was surprised when the big man\r\nburst through the door marked “private,” brushed by him and entered,\r\nunannounced, the governor’s chambers. Before the stately door swung to\r\nbehind him, Gilman heard him demand:\r\n\r\n“What’s all this I hear about your pardoning Tom Whalen?”\r\n\r\nThe private secretary did not hear the governor’s reply, for with\r\ndeliberate step he had crossed the room and closed the door. He heard\r\nnothing clearly, for Handy’s voice came to him smothered, and the\r\ngovernor’s not at all. Once he thought he heard “mawkish sentiment,”\r\nand “the action of a political imbecile,” but what he mostly\r\ndistinguished was muffled profanity. The young man for the first time\r\nin his experience was delighted when his bell buzzed just then. When\r\nhe entered upon the scene, the governor, rocking complacently in his\r\nhigh-backed chair, was saying:\r\n\r\n“But what if it’s my duty?”\r\n\r\n“Duty be damned!” shouted Handy, rising to his feet, and smiting the\r\ndesk with a heavy fist he had had folded during the conversation. The\r\nwrath which the politician had kept bottled up overnight had burst out\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n“I am running this campaign,” he cried, “and as long as I do run it,\r\nI do not propose to tolerate such incredible folly as pardoning Tom\r\nWhalen.”\r\n\r\nGilman, wide-eyed, gazed in amaze at the two men. Handy stood glaring\r\nat the governor, his fist fastened where it had fallen. The governor’s\r\nlips were tightly compressed. A sheet of scarlet swept over his dark\r\nface. Both men were strong-willed. The tensity of such a moment\r\ncould not long endure. Its contagion spread to Gilman’s nerves. The\r\ngovernor’s splendid frame seemed to dilate, and Gilman suddenly became\r\nconscious that the admiration he had always given the man had never\r\nbefore measured up to the fullness of John Chatham’s deserts. It was\r\nwith relief that he saw the governor’s glance turn from Handy to bend\r\non him.\r\n\r\n“Gilman,” he said, “have a pardon made out for Thomas Whalen.”\r\n\r\nThis answer to Handy’s threats was punctuated by a flash from the\r\ngovernor’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“And Gilman--” the governor continued.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Wire that woman--what’s her name?”\r\n\r\n“Barry?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--Barry--wire her to come. I think I shall prefer to tell her\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nHandy dropped, heavy with exhaustion, into his chair. He tried to\r\nspeak, but had trouble with his articulation. When he mastered his\r\ntongue, he could only blurt:\r\n\r\n“Now you have done it, haven’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the governor in gentle assent, “I have done it.” The sigh\r\nthat ended this remark was one in which a heart-burdening care was\r\ndissipated. It was a sigh that resolved a vast difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman came the next morning, Gilman led her at once into the\r\ngovernor’s presence. Before him lay a large document, lettered in\r\npreposterous script, lined in red ink. The woman knew this imitation\r\nparchment to be the pardon of Thomas Whalen. The governor rose and\r\nstood until she had seated herself, and then said, drawing the pardon\r\non the desk to him, “I have decided to grant the application for\r\nWhalen’s pardon.”\r\n\r\nThe woman’s fingers clawed the carved arms of the chair. Gilman stared\r\nwith parted lips. The governor continued as he hastily scanned the\r\npardon:\r\n\r\n“I take this action because circumstances recently revealed lead me to\r\nbelieve that Whalen is innocent.”\r\n\r\nThe governor dipped his pen in the ink.\r\n\r\n“They form a very abstruse proposition,” he said, poising his pen\r\nnicely in his fingers, “and I am not sure that every one can grasp it.”\r\n\r\nThe governor spoke meditatively. The two persons in the room silently\r\nregarded him. Something in the man, in the moment, impelled awe. He set\r\nhis hand to the paper to write, but paused an instant longer. His eyes\r\nwandered from the document. As he raised them over her, the woman bowed\r\nher head. Out through the open window, out through the summer morning,\r\nover the wimpling foliage of the trees, far, far away they gazed. And\r\nthen he sighed, as a woman sighs, and turning, signed the pardon of\r\nThomas Whalen. A moment he sat still as an ancient statue, and then\r\ndropping the pen on the desk, he turned toward Gilman with a smile. The\r\naction relieved the young man from the spell which bound him.\r\n\r\n“Are you going before the people with that story I worked up?” he cried.\r\n\r\nFiercely, without awaiting a reply to a question already answered, he\r\nwheeled on the woman.\r\n\r\n“Do you see what he has done? He has given up all--he has killed\r\nhimself! He says Whalen is innocent--and doesn’t even know upon whom to\r\nfasten suspicion! Don’t you--my God, woman--can’t you see?”\r\n\r\nSlowly the situation was borne in upon her understanding. Her mouth\r\nopened with a gasp, her eyes widened.\r\n\r\n“Why!” she said, jerking her words from a choking throat. “He knows who\r\ndid it. I told him. It was--me.”\r\n\r\nThe door latch clicked behind her. She turned in the direction whence\r\ncame the sound, and repeated, as if the interrupter contradicted her:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did it. I killed Brokoski.”\r\n\r\nHer strength failed her. She sobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\n“Yes--I--did--it,” she repeated. “I--did--it.”\r\n\r\nGilman stared in wonder. Here, then, was the person who had stood\r\nin the alley beneath the window that night, whose footprints would\r\nhave led him to the solution of his mystery, to the end of his clever\r\nchain. The problem of her motive for slaying Brokoski alone remained.\r\nHe longed to ask her, but she had collapsed unconscious in her chair.\r\nTurning to the governor he implored light. A word informed him of the\r\naccidental killing of Brokoski by a jealous woman who was trying to\r\nshoot his vis-à-vis. Then he demanded in tones reproachful:\r\n\r\n“Why did you not tell me this?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” the man quietly responded, “I do not war on women.”\r\n\r\nThe door whose latch had clicked had opened wide, and William Handy\r\nentered, smiling.\r\n\r\nGovernor Chatham was assorting papers on his desk, as a man would whose\r\nroutine work had received a trifling interruption. Handy remained on\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n“John,” he said, “John, I take off my hat to you. I admire your nerve.\r\nI recognized it years ago, that day you presided over our convention\r\nin the old seventh district--remember?--the day you turned me down so\r\nhard. Remember?”\r\n\r\nThe governor smiled.\r\n\r\n“This ain’t flattery,” said Handy, seating himself in a leather chair.\r\n“You’re not only all I’ve said, you’re a devil of a good fellow to\r\nboot.”\r\n\r\nHandy spoke seldom. He never wrote letters, but sent word, according\r\nto an ancient maxim uttered by one of the political fathers. But when\r\nhe did speak, he spoke bluntly, in the same tone in which he would\r\nhave called a man a liar. The governor raised his hand to stay Handy’s\r\ncompliments.\r\n\r\n“Yes, John,” he persisted. “You’re a hell of a good fellow, but,” he\r\nadded, “you’re a damn poor politician.”\r\n\r\nThere was the faintest shadow of a smile on the governor’s face. Handy\r\nclosed his eyes until they were the merest slits. He puffed his cigar\r\nback to life.\r\n\r\nHis head was wrapped in scarfs of smoke.\r\n\r\n“When does the grand jury sit?” he inquired, after a time.\r\n\r\n“Not till the December term.”\r\n\r\n“We can have a special one impaneled. I’ll have Donnelly call it.”\r\n\r\nDonnelly was a judge of dignity and erudition, and Handy spoke of him\r\nas if he were his hired man, which he was.\r\n\r\n“The boys’ll be glad to get Tom back in the nineteenth. O’Rourke says--”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Handy,” said the governor, whirling about in his chair,\r\nand speaking as sharply as a precinct captain at a primary. “I want\r\nnone of Tom Whalen’s work in the nineteenth--not while I’m running for\r\ngovernor. But then,” he added gravely, “he’s only going back to the\r\nnineteenth to die.”\r\n\r\nHandy grunted. “Well, I’ll have Fitzgerald pinch the girl anyway, and\r\nkeep her in the Division Street station till after election.”\r\n\r\nThe governor looked at Handy. “William,” he said, “you might as well\r\nunderstand now, that that would be wholly useless. I am convinced\r\nof Whalen’s innocence absolutely, beyond all doubt, but it will be\r\nimpossible to get a jury to convict the one who did kill Brokoski on\r\nsuch evidence as convinced me.”\r\n\r\n“But she confesses,” urged Handy.\r\n\r\n“To whom?”\r\n\r\n“To you.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. But what if that confession be a privileged communication?”\r\n\r\nHandy looked up in amazement. “You don’t mean you wouldn’t testify?”\r\n\r\nThe governor’s countenance lost its legal expression, and became\r\nsuddenly human. If Handy had been a thinner man he would have jumped\r\nwhen the governor said:\r\n\r\n“Do you think I would send a woman to the penitentiary to elect myself\r\ngovernor?”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure confessions to a governor are privileges?” inquired\r\nHandy, who was adhering to practical things.\r\n\r\nThe governor’s face put on its legal mask again, and he replied:\r\n\r\n“Well, the question is unsettled--”\r\n\r\n“Who presides in the criminal court this winter?” inquired Handy,\r\n“any of our fellows?” Handy’s whole philosophy of life was pull. The\r\ngovernor resumed, without answering:\r\n\r\n“The question has never been decided. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, upon\r\nthe trial of Aaron Burr, ruled, if I remember, that a _subpœna duces\r\ntecum_ might be issued to the president for a letter addressed to him,\r\nleaving the question of the production of the letter--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, say, John,” broke in Handy, “Burr’s dead, isn’t he? And he wasn’t\r\na good fellow, anyway, or he’d never got in that far. Go on with your\r\nlegalities--I myself do not propose to go to jail for contempt for\r\nrefusing to testify.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, me.”\r\n\r\n“What have you to do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nothing much,” said Handy, “only I happened to be inside that\r\ndoor just now when she confessed--and there’s Gilman besides.” Handy,\r\nhis cigar tilted upward, smoked on voluminously and smiled through the\r\nsmoke with deep satisfaction. The governor averted his face. Lines of\r\ntrouble drew themselves across his brow. Presently he turned to the\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\n“Handy,” he said, “I may be reëlected and I may not--probably not.\r\nHowever that may be, I insist upon this: I want that woman, for the\r\npresent, let alone. I have faith in the people. I am willing to go\r\nto them on my record. They may or may not reëlect me. I shall not,\r\nat any rate, have my motives impugned. I only want, when the turmoil\r\nhas subsided, when the subject can be viewed with clear eyes and\r\ninvestigated by clear heads and clean hands, to see justice done.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Handy, “to hell with justice.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” asked the governor, “what do you say to a little mercy\r\nnow and then?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT BOY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must have been sometime in the winter or spring of 1891 that I first\r\nsaw him. I had just been elected to the legislature. It was the famous\r\nReform Session, you will remember, that proved to be of such benefit\r\nto stenographers and space writers. During the six months that general\r\nassembly lasted I lived at the St. James hotel. It is probable that I\r\nfirst saw the boy behind the counter of the cigar stand in the lobby of\r\nthe hotel. It is probable that I had seen and spoken to him many times\r\nbefore I gave him any especial notice. What first arrested my attention\r\nwas a law book. I had stopped at the cigar stand one evening after\r\ndinner to get some cigars, and as he rose to attend upon my wants, he\r\ntook the book from his lap and laid it down upon the counter. While\r\nhe was under the counter getting out a box of the brand I wished--for\r\nI never relish, somehow, cigars taken from a show case--I turned the\r\nbook over and idly looked at its title. I remember very well that it\r\nwas Reeves’ _History of the English Law_. It struck me as rather odd\r\nthat a boy behind a cigar stand should be reading such a book. It was\r\nnot a book that law students, in my state, at any rate, generally read.\r\nI know that I never read it (through) and probably never shall read it,\r\nalthough it is, of course, a wise and ancient book. I asked him why he\r\nread it.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he said, “I’m studying law!”\r\n\r\nAs I lighted a cigar, I looked at the boy. He was tall and overgrown,\r\nand thin with his overgrowth, with spare wrists that thrust themselves\r\nout of frayed cuffs. His face was sallow, and he was not good to\r\nlook upon. His clothes were worn bare to the threads. He had every\r\nappearance of being poor, almost hungry. I fancy I disliked him.\r\n\r\n“When do you expect to be admitted?” I asked casually.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he replied, blithely enough, “in two or three years. Then I go\r\ninto politics.”\r\n\r\nThis, I have said, was in 1891. If anything impressed me, it was the\r\nhopelessness of it all.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, early in the summer, I went down to the capital to argue a\r\ncase at the June term of the supreme court. In the evening, after\r\na hard day in court, I strolled out Lafayette Street to mollify my\r\nnerves. Toward the edge of the town I saw a thin youth walking with a\r\ngirl. The girl wore a white dress. The evening was balmy. The moon was\r\nshining. The lilacs were in bloom, and their odor was on the air. As we\r\npassed each other, the youth’s appearance struck me as familiar. At the\r\ntime I thought that he was the boy who used to tend the cigar stand in\r\nthe St. James, and read Reeves’ _History of the English Law_, whom I\r\nhad naturally forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1898--I remember the time, not, of course, because it\r\nhas anything to do with the boy but because we were then engaged in the\r\ntrack elevation cases--I went over to the Gregory Building one morning\r\nto see Judge Goodman, in order to get him to consent to the Updegraff\r\ncase going over the term. That was a case which involved the doctrine\r\nof merger, and I needed some additional time for preparation.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the offices of Goodman, Peck, Gilmore and Eckhart,\r\nI turned to the office boy, who was sitting near the door at the\r\nfutile little desk all office boys occupy, and on which they scribble\r\nmysterious things, to ask whether the judge was in. When I spoke to the\r\nboy he looked up and smiled and called me by name. He seemed to be, for\r\nsome reason, glad to see me, as if I had been some one from home. In\r\nfact, he said:\r\n\r\n“Have you been down lately?”\r\n\r\nI examined him quite attentively for an instant. He had half risen from\r\nhis chair, and stood, or hung, in an awkward attitude over his desk.\r\nPresently I recognized him as the boy who used to tend the cigar stand\r\nin the hotel at the state capital, and read Reeves’ _History of the\r\nEnglish Law_. I asked him what he was doing in the city.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he said, in apparent surprise at my question, “I’m practising\r\nlaw!”\r\n\r\nHis eyes, in his pale face, dilated with a childish pride, until they\r\nwere large and round and brilliant. He had drawn himself quite erect,\r\nand now he waved his hand toward the wall, and there I saw, in a new\r\noak frame, the old familiar law license the supreme court issues to\r\npoor devils with illusions. There it was, bearing the seal of the\r\ncourt and the signatures of the seven justices. I read the boy’s\r\nname, written on the imitation parchment. It was the first time I had\r\never known what he called himself. I was amused by his having had his\r\nlicense framed.\r\n\r\n“So you are in Judge Goodman’s office, are you?” I said, rather\r\nineptly, to be sure, but merely to have something to say.\r\n\r\nHe made the obvious reply, and spoke of Judge Goodman’s kindness to\r\nhim. I asked him how he was getting along.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he replied, “rather slowly, of course--just at first, you\r\nknow. But then I think if I can stick it out a while--say five or six\r\nyears--I’ll be all right.”\r\n\r\nI kept on looking at the old familiar law license, and thinking of my\r\nown. I have not seen it for years. I think my wife has it somewhere,\r\nin a tin tube with the diplomas and our marriage certificate and her\r\nfather’s discharge from the army and other family charters, if it is\r\nnot lost.\r\n\r\nThen--for I felt that I should say something--I asked him how everybody\r\nwas in the capital.\r\n\r\n“I don’t get down any more,” he said; “it costs, you know.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he was silent, and I did not care to look in his eyes. I\r\nnoticed that the black cravat he had on was very old, and worn through\r\nin places. Also that he was actually out at the elbows, as to the right\r\narm at least, for there, in the sleeve, was a ragged hole that showed\r\nthe soiled lining of his coat. Presently the boy said:\r\n\r\n“When you go down, tell them you saw me, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nOf course it was presumptuous in him, but I thought of those five or\r\nsix years. In that time he would learn--that and other things. Just\r\nthen Judge Goodman stuck his head out of his private room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI happened to go to the capital in May of that year. We were then at\r\nwar, you will remember. I told the man who kept the cigar stand in the\r\nlobby of the St. James that I had seen the boy in the city, that he was\r\npractising law there, and wished to be remembered to his friends. I\r\nthink I told him, also, that the boy was doing well, and already making\r\na favorable impression upon many of the older and more prominent\r\nmembers of the bar. But the man shook his head and responded:\r\n\r\n“Why, haven’t you heard? He’s gone to war--enlisted in the First\r\nInfantry!”\r\n\r\nI hid my surprise from the man, and told him I had heard that, of\r\ncourse, but that the bar regarded his absence as merely temporary.\r\n\r\nThat summer I got into the habit of scanning the lists of sick and\r\ndisabled soldiers who were at Chickamauga and the other fever camps, or\r\nin Cuba. I was especially likely to do this where the First Regiment\r\nwas concerned. It was a practice foolish in a way, because it took up\r\ntime in the morning, and was only a meaningless list of names, anyway.\r\nBut then, we were rather proud of the First in the city that summer,\r\nfor it was our crack regiment, you know, and my wife had one or two\r\nacquaintances among the young officers, who reflected a certain glory\r\nupon her, and gave a color to her conversation.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine at the capital, a lawyer, often sent me, two or three\r\ntimes a week, perhaps, copies of the local papers, and these frequently\r\npublished little bits of personal gossip about boys from that town\r\nwho had gone to “the front,” as they put it. The country papers gave\r\na more personal tone to their war articles than did the city papers.\r\nThese latter seemed to think that a war is got up especially for the\r\nofficers. Doubtless they were about right.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the First went to Cuba. The regiment got there too late\r\nfor active fighting in the operations about Santiago, but not too late\r\nfor duty in the trenches, with their freshly upturned earth, damp and\r\nsaturated with malaria. Nor did they get there too late for the fever.\r\nMany of them contracted it, and some died of it. I used to read the\r\nlists of the sick and dead, to see if the names of any of my wife’s\r\nacquaintances in the field, line or staff, were among them.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while I would observe that some young soldier had died of\r\nsomething or other and homesickness. One morning I happened upon a\r\nname that impressed me as being familiar. After studying it a while,\r\nI finally recognized it as the same name that had been upon the law\r\nlicense that was framed in oak and hanging above the desk of the office\r\nboy. There was printed after the name:\r\n\r\n“Pernicious malaria and nostalgia.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year (1899) the bodies of several\r\nhundred soldiers who had died in Cuba were brought home for final\r\ninterment. I happened to be in the capital again and heard that there\r\nwas to be a military funeral that afternoon. I had some curiosity to\r\nsee a military funeral, and so, having nothing else to do, went to the\r\nchurch where it was to be held. You can imagine my surprise when I was\r\ntold that it was the funeral of the boy who had once tended the cigar\r\nstand in the lobby of the St. James and read Reeves’ _History of the\r\nEnglish Law_, the boy who had afterward gone to the city to practise\r\nlaw, and, later, enlisted in the First Infantry to die in Cuba. There\r\nwere not many at the funeral, for, of course, he was only a private.\r\nThere was a woman there in black, probably his aunt, or mother, for she\r\nappeared to weep, and some girl. Out at the cemetery--Oak Wood, where\r\na general is buried--there were few persons besides the clergyman,\r\nand the woman and the girl. A local militia company had sent a firing\r\nsquad, and it fired the salute prescribed for a private over the grave,\r\nand a bugler stood at the head and blew taps, the soldier’s good night.\r\nHappening to have a rose or two with me, I threw them into the grave.\r\nThe coffin, of course, had a flag over it, but that was about all there\r\nwas of the military funeral--hardly enough, indeed, to reward one’s\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is all. The story hardly seems worth the telling,\r\nnow that it is written, but I fancied that I detected one or two\r\ncoincidences in my haphazard relations with the boy, like my reading of\r\nhis death in the paper, and my happening to be in the capital on the\r\nday of his funeral, and so I set them down.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that I happened to have his law license with me that\r\nday at the funeral. After he had enlisted in the First, perhaps I\r\nshould explain, I noticed it one day in the offices of Goodman, Peck,\r\nGilmore and Eckhart, where it was evidently in the way. So I let it\r\nhang in my office all that summer and all the next winter, but in the\r\nspring we needed the wall space for some new bookcases, and I took it\r\ndown. I think the girl who was at the funeral that day, whoever she is,\r\nhas it now.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or alternate spelling has been retained from the original.",
