Though in one part of the story he is thin and long\r\nnosed, as a result of trouble, generally he is suggested to us as \"ruddy\r\nand plump, with a pair of cheeks like a trumpeter,\" an honest tradesman,\r\nsimple and straightforward, easily cheated; but when he takes his\r\naffairs into his own hands, acting with good plain sense, knowing very\r\nwell what he wants done, and doing it.\r\n\r\nThe book was begun in the year 1712, and published in four successive\r\ngroups of chapters that dealt playfully, from the Tory point of view,\r\nwith public affairs leading up to the Peace of Utrecht. The Peace urged\r\nand made by the Tories was in these light papers recommended to the\r\npublic. The last touches in the parable refer to the beginning of the\r\nyear 1713, when the Duke of Ormond separated his troops from those of\r\nthe Allies and went to receive Dunkirk as the stipulated condition of\r\ncessation of arms. After the withdrawal of the British troops, Prince\r\nEugene was defeated by Marshal Villars at Denain, and other reverses\r\nfollowed. The Peace of Utrecht was signed on the 31st of March.\r\n\r\nSome chapters in this book deal in like manner, from the point of view\r\nof a good-natured Tory of Queen Anne's time, with the feuds of the\r\nday between Church and Dissent. Other chapters unite with this topic\r\na playful account of another chief political event of the time--the\r\nnegotiation leading to the Act of Union between England and Scotland,\r\nwhich received the Royal Assent on the 6th of March, 1707; John Bull\r\nthen consented to receive his \"Sister Peg\" into his house. The Church,\r\nof course, is John Bull's mother; his first wife is a Whig Parliament,\r\nhis second wife a Tory Parliament, which first met in November, 1710.\r\n\r\nThis \"History of John Bull\" began with the first of its four parts\r\nentitled \"Law is a Bottomless Pit, exemplified in the case of Lord\r\nStrutt, John Bull, Nicholas Frog, and Lewis Baboon, who spent all they\r\nhad in a Law-suit.\" For Law put War--the War of the Spanish Succession;\r\nfor lawyers, soldiers; for sessions, campaigns; for verdicts, battles\r\nwon; for Humphry Hocus the attorney, Marlborough the general; for law\r\nexpenses, war expenses; and for aim of the whole, to aid the Tory policy\r\nof peace with France. A second part followed, entitled \"John Bull in his\r\nSenses;\" the third part was called \"John Bull still in his Senses;\" and\r\nthe fourth part, \"Lewis Baboon turned Honest, and John Bull Politician.\"\r\nThe four parts were afterwards arranged into two, as they are here\r\nreprinted, and published together as \"The History of John Bull,\" with a\r\nfew notes by the author which sufficiently explain its drift.\r\n\r\nThe author was John Arbuthnot, a physician, familiar friend of Pope and\r\nSwift, whom Pope addressed as\r\n\r\n     \"Friend to my life, which did not you prolong,\r\n      The world had wanted many an idle song;\"\r\n\r\nand of whom Swift said, that \"he has more wit than we all have, and his\r\nhumanity is equal to his wit.\" \"If there were a dozen Arbuthnots in the\r\nworld,\" said Swift, \"I would burn 'Gulliver's Travels.'\"\r\n\r\nArbuthnot was of Swift's age, born in 1667, son of a Scotch Episcopal\r\nclergyman, who lost his living at the Revolution. His sons--all trained\r\nin High Church principles--left Scotland to seek their fortunes; John\r\ncame to London and taught mathematics. He took his degree of Doctor\r\nof Medicine at St. Andrews in 1696; found use for mathematics in his\r\nstudies of medicine; became a Fellow of the Royal Society; and being by\r\nchance at Epsom when Queen Anne's husband was taken ill, prescribed for\r\nhim so successfully that he was made in 1705 Physician Extraordinary,\r\nand upon the occurrence of a vacancy in 1709 Physician in Ordinary,\r\nto the Queen. Swift calls him her favourite physician. In 1710 he was\r\nadmitted Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. That was Arbuthnot's\r\nposition in 1712-13 when, at the age of forty-five, he wrote this\r\n\"History of John Bull.\" He was personal friend of the Ministers whose\r\npolicy he supported, and especially of Harley, Earl of Oxford, the Sir\r\nRoger of the History.\r\n\r\nAfter Queen Anne's death, and the coming of the Whigs to power,\r\nArbuthnot lost his office at Court. But he was the friend and physician\r\nof all the wits; himself without literary ambition, allowing friends\r\nto make what alterations they pleased in pieces that he wrote, or his\r\nchildren to make kites of them. A couple of years before his death\r\nhe suffered deeply from the loss of the elder of his two sons. He was\r\nhimself afflicted then with stone, and retired to Hampstead to die. \"A\r\nrecovery,\" he wrote to Swift, \"is in my case and in my age impossible;\r\nthe kindest wish of my friends is euthanasia.\" He died in 1735.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\nWhen I was first called to the office of historiographer to John Bull,\r\nhe expressed himself to this purpose:--\"Sir Humphrey Polesworth,* I know\r\nyou are a plain dealer; it is for that reason I have chosen you for this\r\nimportant trust; speak the truth and spare not.\" That I might fulfil\r\nthose his honourable intentions, I obtained leave to repair to, and\r\nattend him in his most secret retirements; and I put the journals of\r\nall transactions into a strong box, to be opened at a fitting occasion,\r\nafter the manner of the historiographers of some eastern monarchs: this\r\nI thought was the safest way; though I declare I was never afraid to be\r\nchopped** by my master for telling of truth. It is from those journals\r\nthat my memoirs are compiled: therefore let not posterity a thousand\r\nyears hence look for truth in the voluminous annals of pedants, who are\r\nentirely ignorant of the secret springs of great actions; if they do,\r\nlet me tell them they will be nebused.***\r\n\r\n     * A Member of Parliament, eminent for a certain cant in his\r\n     conversation, of which there is a good deal in this book.\r\n\r\n     ** A cant word of Sir Humphrey's.\r\n\r\n     *** Another cant word, signifying deceived.\r\n\r\nWith incredible pains have I endeavoured to copy the several beauties\r\nof the ancient and modern historians; the impartial temper of Herodotus,\r\nthe gravity, austerity, and strict morals of Thucydides, the extensive\r\nknowledge of Xenophon, the sublimity and grandeur of Titus Livius; and\r\nto avoid the careless style of Polybius, I have borrowed considerable\r\nornaments from Dionysius Halicarnasseus, and Diodorus Siculus. The\r\nspecious gilding of Tacitus I have endeavoured to shun. Mariana, Davila,\r\nand Fra. Paulo, are those amongst the moderns whom I thought most\r\nworthy of imitation; but I cannot be so disingenuous, as not to own the\r\ninfinite obligations I have to the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" of John Bunyan,\r\nand the \"Tenter Belly\" of the Reverend Joseph Hall.\r\n\r\nFrom such encouragement and helps, it is easy to guess to what a degree\r\nof perfection I might have brought this great work, had it not\r\nbeen nipped in the bud by some illiterate people in both Houses of\r\nParliament, who envying the great figure I was to make in future ages,\r\nunder pretence of raising money for the war,* have padlocked all\r\nthose very pens that were to celebrate the actions of their heroes, by\r\nsilencing at once the whole university of Grub Street. I am persuaded\r\nthat nothing but the prospect of an approaching peace could have\r\nencouraged them to make so bold a step. But suffer me, in the name of\r\nthe rest of the matriculates of that famous university, to ask them some\r\nplain questions: Do they think that peace will bring along with it\r\nthe golden age? Will there be never a dying speech of a traitor? Are\r\nCethegus and Catiline turned so tame, that there will be no opportunity\r\nto cry about the streets, \"A Dangerous Plot?\" Will peace bring such\r\nplenty that no gentleman will have occasion to go upon the highway, or\r\nbreak into a house? I am sorry that the world should be so much imposed\r\nupon by the dreams of a false prophet, as to imagine the Millennium is\r\nat hand. O Grub Street! thou fruitful nursery of towering geniuses! How\r\ndo I lament thy downfall? Thy ruin could never be meditated by any who\r\nmeant well to English liberty. No modern lyceum will ever equal thy\r\nglory: whether in soft pastorals thou didst sing the flames of pampered\r\napprentices and coy cook maids; or mournful ditties of departing\r\nlovers; or if to Maeonian strains thou raisedst thy voice, to record\r\nthe stratagems, the arduous exploits, and the nocturnal scalade of needy\r\nheroes, the terror of your peaceful citizens, describing the powerful\r\nBetty or the artful Picklock, or the secret caverns and grottoes of\r\nVulcan sweating at his forge, and stamping the queen's image on viler\r\nmetals which he retails for beef and pots of ale; or if thou wert\r\ncontent in simple narrative, to relate the cruel acts of implacable\r\nrevenge, or the complaint of ravished virgins blushing to tell their\r\nadventures before the listening crowd of city damsels, whilst in thy\r\nfaithful history thou intermingledst the gravest counsels and the purest\r\nmorals. Nor less acute and piercing wert thou in thy search and pompous\r\ndescriptions of the works of nature; whether in proper and emphatic\r\nterms thou didst paint the blazing comet's fiery tail, the stupendous\r\nforce of dreadful thunder and earthquakes, and the unrelenting\r\ninundations. Sometimes, with Machiavelian sagacity, thou unravelledst\r\nintrigues of state, and the traitorous conspiracies of rebels, giving\r\nwise counsel to monarchs. How didst thou move our terror and our pity\r\nwith thy passionate scenes between Jack Catch and the heroes of the Old\r\nBailey? How didst thou describe their intrepid march up Holborn Hill?\r\nNor didst thou shine less in thy theological capacity, when thou gavest\r\nghostly counsels to dying felons, and didst record the guilty pangs of\r\nSabbath breakers. How will the noble arts of John Overton's** painting\r\nand sculpture now languish? where rich invention, proper expression,\r\ncorrect design, divine attitudes, and artful contrast, heightened with\r\nthe beauties of Clar. Obscur., embellished thy celebrated pieces, to the\r\ndelight and astonishment of the judicious multitude! Adieu, persuasive\r\neloquence! the quaint metaphor, the poignant irony, the proper epithet,\r\nand the lively simile, are fled for ever! Instead of these, we shall\r\nhave, I know not what! The illiterate will tell the rest with pleasure.\r\n\r\n     * Act restraining the liberty of the press, etc.\r\n\r\n     ** The engraver of the cuts before the Grub Street papers.\r\n\r\nI hope the reader will excuse this digression, due by way of condolence\r\nto my worthy brethren of Grub Street, for the approaching barbarity\r\nthat is likely to overspread all its regions by this oppressive and\r\nexorbitant tax. It has been my good fortune to receive my education\r\nthere; and so long as I preserved some figure and rank amongst the\r\nlearned of that society, I scorned to take my degree either at Utrecht\r\nor Leyden, though I was offered it gratis by the professors in those\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nAnd now that posterity may not be ignorant in what age so excellent a\r\nhistory was written (which would otherwise, no doubt, be the subject of\r\nits inquiries), I think it proper to inform the learned of future times,\r\nthat it was compiled when Louis XIV. was King of France, and Philip his\r\ngrandson of Spain; when England and Holland, in conjunction with the\r\nEmperor and the Allies, entered into a war against these two princes,\r\nwhich lasted ten years, under the management of the Duke of Marlborough,\r\nand was put to a conclusion by the Treaty of Utrecht, under the ministry\r\nof the Earl of Oxford, in the year 1713.\r\n\r\nMany at that time did imagine the history of John Bull, and the\r\npersonages mentioned in it, to be allegorical, which the author would\r\nnever own. Notwithstanding, to indulge the reader's fancy and curiosity,\r\nI have printed at the bottom of the page the supposed allusions of the\r\nmost obscure parts of the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF JOHN BULL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. The Occasion of the Law Suit.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you of the great quarrels that have happened in our\r\nneighbourhood since the death of the late Lord Strutt;* how the parson**\r\nand a cunning attorney got him to settle his estate upon his cousin\r\nPhilip Baboon, to the great disappointment of his cousin Esquire South.\r\nSome stick not to say that the parson and the attorney forged a will;\r\nfor which they were well paid by the family of the Baboons. Let that\r\nbe as it will, it is matter of fact that the honour and estate have\r\ncontinued ever since in the person of Philip Baboon.\r\n\r\n     * Late King of Spain.\r\n\r\n     ** Cardinal Portocarero.\r\n\r\nYou know that the Lord Strutts have for many years been possessed of a\r\nvery great landed estate, well conditioned, wooded, watered, with coal,\r\nsalt, tin, copper, iron, etc., all within themselves; that it has been\r\nthe misfortune of that family to be the property of their stewards,\r\ntradesmen, and inferior servants, which has brought great incumbrances\r\nupon them; at the same time, their not abating of their expensive way\r\nof living has forced them to mortgage their best manors. It is credibly\r\nreported that the butcher's and baker's bill of a Lord Strutt that lived\r\ntwo hundred years ago are not yet paid.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip Baboon came first to the possession of the Lord Strutt's\r\nestate, his tradesmen,* as is usual upon such occasions, waited upon him\r\nto wish him joy and bespeak his custom. The two chief were John Bull,**\r\nthe clothier, and Nic. Frog,*** the linendraper. They told him that the\r\nBulls and Frogs had served the Lord Strutts with draperyware for many\r\nyears; that they were honest and fair dealers; that their bills had\r\nnever been questioned; that the Lord Strutts lived generously, and\r\nnever used to dirty their fingers with pen, ink, and counters; that\r\nhis lordship might depend upon their honesty that they would use him as\r\nkindly as they had done his predecessors. The young lord seemed to take\r\nall in good part, and dismissed them with a deal of seeming content,\r\nassuring them he did not intend to change any of the honourable maxims\r\nof his predecessors.\r\n\r\n     * The first letters of congratulation from King William and\r\n     the States of Holland upon King Philip's accession to the\r\n     crown of Spain.\r\n\r\n     ** The English.\r\n\r\n     *** The Dutch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. How Bull and Frog grew jealous that the Lord Strutt intended\r\nto give all his custom to his grandfather Lewis Baboon.\r\n\r\nIt happened unfortunately for the peace of our neighbourhood that this\r\nyoung lord had an old cunning rogue, or, as the Scots call it, a false\r\nloon of a grandfather, that one might justly call a Jack-of-all-Trades.*\r\nSometimes you would see him behind his counter selling broadcloth,\r\nsometimes measuring linen; next day he would be dealing in merceryware.\r\nHigh heads, ribbons, gloves, fans, and lace he understood to a nicety.\r\nCharles Mather could not bubble a young beau better with a toy; nay, he\r\nwould descend even to the selling of tape, garters, and shoe-buckles.\r\nWhen shop was shut up he would go about the neighbourhood and earn\r\nhalf-a-crown by teaching the young men and maids to dance. By these\r\nmethods he had acquired immense riches, which he used to squander* away\r\nat back-sword, quarter-staff, and cudgel-play, in which he took great\r\npleasure, and challenged all the country. You will say it is no\r\nwonder if Bull and Frog should be jealous of this fellow. \"It is not\r\nimpossible,\" says Frog to Bull, \"but this old rogue will take the\r\nmanagement of the young lord's business into his hands; besides, the\r\nrascal has good ware, and will serve him as cheap as anybody. In that\r\ncase, I leave you to judge what must become of us and our families;\r\nwe must starve, or turn journeyman to old Lewis Baboon. Therefore,\r\nneighbour, I hold it advisable that we write to young Lord Strutt to\r\nknow the bottom of this matter.\"\r\n\r\n     * The character and trade of the French nation.\r\n\r\n     ** The King's disposition to war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. A Copy of Bull and Frog's Letter to Lord Strutt.\r\n\r\nMy Lord,--I suppose your lordship knows that the Bulls and the Frogs\r\nhave served the Lord Strutts with all sorts of draperyware time out of\r\nmind. And whereas we are jealous, not without reason, that your lordship\r\nintends henceforth to buy of your grandsire old Lewis Baboon, this is\r\nto inform your lordship that this proceeding does not suit with the\r\ncircumstances of our families, who have lived and made a good figure in\r\nthe world by the generosity of the Lord Strutts. Therefore we think fit\r\nto acquaint your lordship that you must find sufficient security to us,\r\nour heirs, and assigns that you will not employ Lewis Baboon, or else\r\nwe will take our remedy at law, clap an action upon you of 20,000\r\npounds for old debts, seize and distrain your goods and chattels,\r\nwhich, considering your lordship's circumstances, will plunge you into\r\ndifficulties, from which it will not be easy to extricate yourself.\r\nTherefore we hope, when your lordship has better considered on it, you\r\nwill comply with the desire of\r\n\r\nYour loving friends,\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL,\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of Bull's friends advised him to take gentler methods with the\r\nyoung lord, but John naturally loved rough play. It is impossible to\r\nexpress the surprise of the Lord Strutt upon the receipt of this letter.\r\nHe was not flush in ready either to go to law or clear old debts,\r\nneither could he find good bail. He offered to bring matters to a\r\nfriendly accommodation, and promised, upon his word of honour, that he\r\nwould not change his drapers; but all to no purpose, for Bull and Frog\r\nsaw clearly that old Lewis would have the cheating of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How Bull and Frog went to law with Lord Strutt about the\r\npremises, and were joined by the rest of the tradesmen.\r\n\r\nAll endeavours of accommodation between Lord Strutt and his drapers\r\nproved vain. Jealousies increased, and, indeed, it was rumoured abroad\r\nthat Lord Strutt had bespoke his new liveries of old Lewis Baboon. This\r\ncoming to Mrs. Bull's ears, when John Bull came home, he found all\r\nhis family in an uproar. Mrs. Bull, you must know, was very apt to be\r\ncholeric. \"You sot,\" says she, \"you loiter about alehouses and taverns,\r\nspend your time at billiards, ninepins, or puppet-shows, or flaunt about\r\nthe streets in your new gilt chariot, never minding me nor your numerous\r\nfamily. Don't you hear how Lord Strutt has bespoke his liveries at\r\nLewis Baboon's shop? Don't you see how that old fox steals away your\r\ncustomers, and turns you out of your business every day, and you sit\r\nlike an idle drone, with your hands in your pockets? Fie upon it. Up\r\nman, rouse thyself; I'll sell to my shift before I'll be so used by that\r\nknave.\"* You must think Mrs. Bull had been pretty well tuned up by Frog,\r\nwho chimed in with her learned harangue. No further delay now, but to\r\ncounsel learned in the law they go, who unanimously assured them both of\r\njustice and infallible success of their lawsuit.\r\n\r\n     * The sentiments and addresses of the Parliament at that\r\n     time.\r\n\r\nI told you before that old Lewis Baboon was a sort of a\r\nJack-of-all-trades, which made the rest of the tradesmen jealous, as\r\nwell as Bull and Frog; they hearing of the quarrel, were glad of an\r\nopportunity of joining against old Lewis Baboon, provided that Bull\r\nand Frog would bear the charges of the suit. Even lying Ned, the\r\nchimney-sweeper of Savoy, and Tom, the Portugal dustman, put in their\r\nclaims, and the cause was put into the hands of Humphry Hocus, the\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nA declaration was drawn up to show \"That Bull and Frog had undoubted\r\nright by prescription to be drapers to the Lord Strutts; that there were\r\nseveral old contracts to that purpose; that Lewis Baboon had taken up\r\nthe trade of clothier and draper without serving his time or purchasing\r\nhis freedom; that he sold goods that were not marketable without the\r\nstamp; that he himself was more fit for a bully than a tradesman, and\r\nwent about through all the country fairs challenging people to fight\r\nprizes, wrestling and cudgel play, and abundance more to this purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. The true characters of John Bull, Nic. Frog, and Hocus.*\r\n\r\n     * Characters of the English and Dutch, and the General Duke\r\n     of Marlborough.\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding the following history the reader ought\r\nto know that Bull, in the main, was an honest, plain-dealing fellow,\r\ncholeric, bold, and of a very unconstant temper; he dreaded not old\r\nLewis either at back-sword, single falchion, or cudgel-play; but then\r\nhe was very apt to quarrel with his best friends, especially if they\r\npretended to govern him. If you flattered him you might lead him like a\r\nchild. John's temper depended very much upon the air; his spirits rose\r\nand fell with the weather-glass. John was quick and understood his\r\nbusiness very well, but no man alive was more careless in looking into\r\nhis accounts, or more cheated by partners, apprentices, and servants.\r\nThis was occasioned by his being a boon companion, loving his bottle and\r\nhis diversion; for, to say truth, no man kept a better house than John,\r\nnor spent his money more generously. By plain and fair dealing John had\r\nacquired some plums, and might have kept them, had it not been for his\r\nunhappy lawsuit.\r\n\r\nNic. Frog was a cunning, sly fellow, quite the reverse of John in many\r\nparticulars; covetous, frugal, minded domestic affairs, would pinch his\r\nbelly to save his pocket, never lost a farthing by careless servants\r\nor bad debtors. He did not care much for any sort of diversion, except\r\ntricks of high German artists and legerdemain. No man exceeded Nic. in\r\nthese; yet it must be owned that Nic. was a fair dealer, and in that way\r\nacquired immense riches.\r\n\r\nHocus was an old cunning attorney, and though this was the first\r\nconsiderable suit that ever he was engaged in he showed himself superior\r\nin address to most of his profession. He kept always good clerks, he\r\nloved money, was smooth-tongued, gave good words, and seldom lost his\r\ntemper. He was not worse than an infidel, for he provided plentifully\r\nfor his family, but he loved himself better than them all. The\r\nneighbours reported that he was henpecked, which was impossible, by such\r\na mild-spirited woman as his wife was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. Of the various success of the Lawsuit.*\r\n\r\n     * The success of the war.\r\n\r\nLaw is a bottomless pit; it is a cormorant, a harpy, that devours\r\neverything. John Bull was flattered by the lawyers that his suit would\r\nnot last above a year or two at most; that before that time he would be\r\nin quiet possession of his business; yet ten long years did Hocus steer\r\nhis cause through all the meanders of the law and all the courts. No\r\nskill, no address was wanting, and, to say truth, John did not starve\r\nthe cause; there wanted not yellowboys to fee counsel, hire witnesses,\r\nand bribe juries. Lord Strutt was generally cast, never had one verdict\r\nin his favour, and John was promised that the next, and the next, would\r\nbe the final determination; but, alas! that final determination and\r\nhappy conclusion was like an enchanted island; the nearer John came to\r\nit the further it went from him. New trials upon new points still arose,\r\nnew doubts, new matters to be cleared; in short, lawyers seldom part\r\nwith so good a cause till they have got the oyster and their clients the\r\nshell. John's ready money, book debts, bonds, mortgages, all went into\r\nthe lawyers' pockets. Then John began to borrow money upon Bank Stock\r\nand East India Bonds. Now and then a farm went to pot. At last it was\r\nthought a good expedient to set up Esquire South's title to prove the\r\nwill forged and dispossess Philip Lord Strutt at once. Here again was a\r\nnew field for the lawyers, and the cause grew more intricate than\r\never. John grew madder and madder; wherever he met any of Lord Strutt's\r\nservants he tore off their clothes. Now and then you would see them\r\ncome home naked, without shoes, stockings, and linen. As for old Lewis\r\nBaboon, he was reduced to his last shift, though he had as many as any\r\nother. His children were reduced from rich silks to doily stuffs, his\r\nservants in rags and barefooted; instead of good victuals they now lived\r\nupon neck beef and bullock's liver. In short, nobody got much by the\r\nmatter but the men of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. How John Bull was so mightily pleased with his success that\r\nhe was going to leave off his trade and turn Lawyer.\r\n\r\nIt is wisely observed by a great philosopher that habit is a second\r\nnature. This was verified in the case of John Bull, who, from an honest\r\nand plain tradesman, had got such a haunt about the Courts of Justice,\r\nand such a jargon of law words, that he concluded himself as able\r\na lawyer as any that pleaded at the bar or sat on the bench. He\r\nwas overheard one day talking to himself after this manner: \"How\r\ncapriciously does fate or chance dispose of mankind. How seldom is that\r\nbusiness allotted to a man for which he is fitted by Nature. It is plain\r\nI was intended for a man of law. How did my guardians mistake my genius\r\nin placing me, like a mean slave, behind a counter? Bless me! what\r\nimmense estates these fellows raise by the law. Besides, it is the\r\nprofession of a gentleman. What a pleasure it is to be victorious in\r\na cause: to swagger at the bar. What a fool am I to drudge any more in\r\nthis woollen trade. For a lawyer I was born, and a lawyer I will be; one\r\nis never too old to learn.\"* All this while John had conned over such a\r\ncatalogue of hard words as were enough to conjure up the devil; these\r\nhe used to babble indifferently in all companies, especially at coffee\r\nhouses, so that his neighbour tradesmen began to shun his company as a\r\nman that was cracked. Instead of the affairs of Blackwell Hall and price\r\nof broadcloth, wool, and baizes, he talks of nothing but actions upon\r\nthe case, returns, capias, alias capias, demurrers, venire facias,\r\nreplevins, supersedeases, certioraries, writs of error, actions of\r\ntrover and conversion, trespasses, precipes, and dedimus. This was\r\nmatter of jest to the learned in law; however Hocus and the rest of the\r\ntribe encouraged John in his fancy, assuring him that he had a great\r\ngenius for law; that they questioned not but in time he might raise\r\nmoney enough by it to reimburse him of all his charges; that if he\r\nstudied he would undoubtedly arrive to the dignity of a Lord Chief\r\nJustice. As for the advice of honest friends and neighbours John\r\ndespised it; he looked upon them as fellows of a low genius, poor\r\ngrovelling mechanics. John reckoned it more honour to have got one\r\nfavourable verdict than to have sold a bale of broadcloth. As for Nic.\r\nFrog, to say the truth, he was more prudent; for though he followed his\r\nlawsuit closely he neglected not his ordinary business, but was both in\r\ncourt and in his shop at the proper hours.\r\n\r\n     * The manners and sentiments of the nation at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. How John discovered that Hocus had an Intrigue with his\r\nWife;* and what followed thereupon.\r\n\r\nJohn had not run on a madding so long had it not been for an extravagant\r\nwife, whom Hocus perceiving John to be fond of, was resolved to win over\r\nto his side. It is a true saying, that the last man of the parish\r\nthat knows of his cuckoldom is himself. It was observed by all the\r\nneighbourhood that Hocus had dealings with John's wife that were not so\r\nmuch for his honour; but this was perceived by John a little too late:\r\nshe was a luxurious jade, loved splendid equipages, plays, treats and\r\nballs, differing very much from the sober manners of her ancestors, and\r\nby no means fit for a tradesman's wife. Hocus fed her extravagancy (what\r\nwas still more shameful) with John's own money. Everybody said that\r\nHocus had a month's mind to her; be that as it will, it is matter of\r\nfact, that upon all occasions she ran out extravagantly on the praise\r\nof Hocus. When John used to be finding fault with his bills, she used\r\nto reproach him as ungrateful to his greatest benefactor; one that had\r\ntaken so much pains in his lawsuit, and retrieved his family from the\r\noppression of old Lewis Baboon. A good swinging sum of John's readiest\r\ncash went towards building of Hocus's country house.** This affair\r\nbetween Hocus and Mrs. Bull was now so open, that all the world was\r\nscandalised at it; John was not so clod-pated, but at last he took the\r\nhint. The parson of the parish preaching one day with more zeal than\r\nsense against adultery, Mrs. Bull told her husband that he was a\r\nvery uncivil fellow to use such coarse language before people of\r\ncondition;*** that Hocus was of the same mind, and that they would join\r\nto have him turned out of his living for using personal reflections. How\r\ndo you mean, says John, by personal reflections? I hope in God, wife,\r\nhe did not reflect upon you? \"No, thank God, my reputation is too well\r\nestablished in the world to receive any hurt from such a foul-mouthed\r\nscoundrel as he; his doctrine tends only to make husbands tyrants, and\r\nwives slaves; must we be shut up, and husbands left to their liberty?\r\nVery pretty indeed! a wife must never go abroad with a Platonic to see\r\na play or a ball; she must never stir without her husband; nor walk in\r\nSpring Garden with a cousin. I do say, husband, and I will stand by it,\r\nthat without the innocent freedoms of life, matrimony would be a most\r\nintolerable state; and that a wife's virtue ought to be the result of\r\nher own reason, and not of her husband's government: for my part, I\r\nwould scorn a husband that would be jealous, if he saw a fellow with\r\nme.\" All this while John's blood boiled in his veins: he was now\r\nconfirmed in all his suspicions; the hardest names, were the best words\r\nthat John gave her. Things went from better to worse, till Mrs. Bull\r\naimed a knife at John, though John threw a bottle at her head very\r\nbrutally indeed: and after this there was nothing but confusion;\r\nbottles, glasses, spoons, plates, knives, forks, and dishes, flew about\r\nlike dust; the result of which was, that Mrs. Bull received a bruise\r\nin her right side of which she died half a year after. The bruise\r\nimposthumated, and afterwards turned to a stinking ulcer, which made\r\neverybody shy to come near her, yet she wanted not the help of many\r\nable physicians, who attended very diligently, and did what men of\r\nskill could do; but all to no purpose, for her condition was now quite\r\ndesperate, all regular physicians and her nearest relations having given\r\nher over.****\r\n\r\n     * The opinion at that time of the General's tampering with\r\n     the Parliament.\r\n\r\n     ** Blenheim Palace.\r\n\r\n     *** The story of Dr. Sacheverel, and the resentment of the\r\n     House of Commons.\r\n\r\n     **** The opinion of the Tories about that House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. How some Quacks undertook to cure Mrs. Bull of her ulcer.*\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so impossible in Nature but mountebanks will undertake;\r\nnothing so incredible but they will affirm: Mrs. Bull's condition was\r\nlooked upon as desperate by all the men of art; but there were those\r\nthat bragged they had an infallible ointment and plaister, which being\r\napplied to the sore, would cure it in a few days; at the same time they\r\nwould give her a pill that would purge off all her bad humours, sweeten\r\nher blood, and rectify her disturbed imagination. In spite of all\r\napplications the patient grew worse every day; she stunk so, nobody\r\ndurst come within a stone's throw of her, except those quacks who\r\nattended her close, and apprehended no danger. If one asked them how\r\nMrs. Bull did? Better and better, said they; the parts heal, and her\r\nconstitution mends: if she submits to our government she will be abroad\r\nin a little time. Nay, it is reported that they wrote to her friends\r\nin the country that she should dance a jig next October in Westminster\r\nHall, and that her illness had been chiefly owing to bad physicians. At\r\nlast, one of them was sent for in great haste, his patient grew worse\r\nand worse: when he came, he affirmed that it was a gross mistake, and\r\nthat she was never in a fairer way. Bring hither the salve, says he,\r\nand give her a plentiful draught of my cordial. As he was applying his\r\nointments, and administering the cordial, the patient gave up the ghost,\r\nto the great confusion of the quack, and the great joy of Bull and his\r\nfriends. The quack flung away out of the house in great disorder,\r\nand swore there was foul play, for he was sure his medicines were\r\ninfallible. Mrs. Bull having died without any signs of repentance or\r\ndevotion, the clergy would hardly allow her a Christian burial. The\r\nrelations had once resolved to sue John for the murder, but considering\r\nbetter of it, and that such a trial would rip up old sores, and discover\r\nthings not so much to the reputation of the deceased, they dropped their\r\ndesign. She left no will, only there was found in her strong box the\r\nfollowing words written on a scrip of paper--\"My curse on John Bull,\r\nand all my posterity, if ever they come to any composition with the Lord\r\nStrutt.\"\r\n\r\nShe left him three daughters, whose names were Polemia, Discordia, and\r\nUsuria.**\r\n\r\n     * Endeavours and hopes of some people to hinder the\r\n     dissolution of that Parliament.\r\n\r\n     ** War, faction, and usury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. Of John Bull's second Wife, and the good Advice that she gave\r\nhim.*\r\n\r\nJohn quickly got the better of his grief, and, seeing that neither his\r\nconstitution nor the affairs of his family, could permit him to live in\r\nan unmarried state, he resolved to get him another wife; a cousin of his\r\nlast wife's was proposed, but John would have no more of the breed. In\r\nshort, he wedded a sober country gentlewoman, of a good family and a\r\nplentiful fortune, the reverse of the other in her temper; not but that\r\nshe loved money, for she was saving, and applied her fortune to pay\r\nJohn's clamorous debts, that the unfrugal method of his last wife, and\r\nthis ruinous lawsuit, had brought him into. One day, as she had got\r\nher husband in a good humour, she talked to him after the following\r\nmanner:--\"My dear, since I have been your wife, I have observed great\r\nabuses and disorders in your family: your servants are mutinous and\r\nquarrelsome, and cheat you most abominably; your cookmaid is in a\r\ncombination with your butcher, poulterer, and fishmonger; your butler\r\npurloins your liquor, and the brewer sells you hogwash; your baker\r\ncheats both in weight and in tale; even your milkwoman and your\r\nnursery-maid have a fellow feeling; your tailor, instead of shreds,\r\ncabbages whole yards of cloth; besides, leaving such long scores, and\r\nnot going to market with ready money forces us to take bad ware of the\r\ntradesmen at their own price. You have not posted your books these ten\r\nyears. How is it possible for a man of business to keep his affairs even\r\nin the world at this rate? Pray God this Hocus be honest; would to God\r\nyou would look over his bills, and see how matters stand between Frog\r\nand you. Prodigious sums are spent in this lawsuit, and more must be\r\nborrowed of scriveners and usurers at heavy interest. Besides, my\r\ndear, let me beg of you to lay aside that wild project of leaving\r\nyour business to turn lawyer, for which, let me tell you, Nature never\r\ndesigned you. Believe me, these rogues do but flatter, that they may\r\npick your pocket; observe what a parcel of hungry ragged fellows live by\r\nyour cause; to be sure they will never make an end of it. I foresee this\r\nhaunt you have got about the courts will one day or another bring your\r\nfamily to beggary. Consider, my dear, how indecent it is to abandon\r\nyour shop and follow pettifoggers; the habit is so strong upon you, that\r\nthere is hardly a plea between two country esquires, about a barren acre\r\nupon a common, but you draw yourself in as bail, surety, or solicitor.\"\r\nJohn heard her all this while with patience, till she pricked his\r\nmaggot, and touched him in the tender point. Then he broke out into\r\na violent passion: \"What, I not fit for a lawyer? let me tell you, my\r\nclod-pated relations spoiled the greatest genius in the world when they\r\nbred me a mechanic. Lord Strutt, and his old rogue of a grandsire, have\r\nfound to their cost that I can manage a lawsuit as well as another.\" \"I\r\ndon't deny what you say,\" replied Mrs. Bull, \"nor do I call in question\r\nyour parts; but, I say, it does not suit with your circumstances;\r\nyou and your predecessors have lived in good reputation among your\r\nneighbours by this same clothing-trade, and it were madness to leave it\r\noff. Besides, there are few that know all the tricks and cheats of these\r\nlawyers. Does not your own experience teach you how they have drawn you\r\non from one term to another, and how you have danced the round of all\r\nthe courts, still flattering you with a final issue; and, for aught I\r\ncan see, your cause is not a bit clearer than it was seven years ago.\"\r\n\"I will be hanged,\" says John, \"if I accept of any composition from\r\nStrutt or his grandfather; I'll rather wheel about the streets an engine\r\nto grind knives and scissors. However, I'll take your advice, and look\r\nover my accounts.\"\r\n\r\n     * A new Parliament:  the aversion of a Tory House of Commons\r\n     to war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. How John looked over his Attorney's Bill.*\r\n\r\n     * Looking over the accounts.\r\n\r\nWhen John first brought out the bills, the surprise of all the family\r\nwas unexpressible at the prodigious dimensions of them; they would have\r\nmeasured with the best bale of cloth in John's shop. Fees to judges,\r\npuny judges, clerks, prothonotaries, philisers, chirographers,\r\nunder-clerks, proclamators, counsel, witnesses, jurymen, marshals,\r\ntipstaffs, criers, porters; for enrollings, exemplifications, bails,\r\nvouchers, returns, caveats, examinations, filings of words, entries,\r\ndeclarations, replications, recordats, nolle prosequies, certioraries,\r\nmittimuses, demurrers, special verdicts, informations, scire facias,\r\nsupersedeas, habeas corpus, coach-hire, treating of witnesses, etc.\r\n\"Verily,\" says John, \"there are a prodigious number of learned words in\r\nthis law; what a pretty science it is!\" \"Ay but, husband, you have\r\npaid for every syllable and letter of these fine words. Bless me, what\r\nimmense sums are at the bottom of the account!\" John spent several weeks\r\nin looking over his bills, and, by comparing and stating his accounts,\r\nhe discovered that, besides the extravagance of every article, he had\r\nbeen egregiously cheated; that he had paid for counsel that were never\r\nfee'd, for writs that were never drawn, for dinners that were never\r\ndressed, and journeys that were never made; in short, that the\r\ntradesmen, lawyers, and Frog had agreed to throw the burden of the\r\nlawsuit upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How John grew angry, and resolved to accept a Composition;\r\nand what Methods were practised by the Lawyers for keeping him from it.*\r\n\r\nWell might the learned Daniel Burgess say, \"That a lawsuit is a suit for\r\nlife. He that sows his grain upon marble will have many a hungry belly\r\nbefore harvest.\" This John felt by woeful experience. John's cause was a\r\ngood milch cow, and many a man subsisted his family out of it. However,\r\nJohn began to think it high time to look about him. He had a cousin in\r\nthe country, one Sir Roger Bold, whose predecessors had been bred up\r\nto the law, and knew as much of it as anybody; but having left off\r\nthe profession for some time, they took great pleasure in compounding\r\nlawsuits among their neighbours, for which they were the aversion of the\r\ngentlemen of the long robe, and at perpetual war with all the country\r\nattorneys. John put his cause in Sir Roger's hands, desiring him to make\r\nthe best of it. The news had no sooner reached the ears of the lawyers,\r\nbut they were all in an uproar. They brought all the rest of the\r\ntradesmen upon John.** Squire South swore he was betrayed, that he would\r\nstarve before he compounded; Frog said he was highly wronged; even\r\nlying Ned the chimney-sweeper and Tom the dustman complained that their\r\ninterest was sacrificed; the lawyers, solicitors, Hocus and his clerks,\r\nwere all up in arms at the news of the composition: they abused him and\r\nhis wife most shamefully. \"You silly, awkward, ill-bred country sow,\"\r\nquoth one, \"have you no more manners than to rail at Hocus that has\r\nsaved that clod-pated numskulled ninny-hammer of yours from ruin, and\r\nall his family? It is well known how he has rose early and sat up late\r\nto make him easy, when he was sotting at every alehouse in town. I\r\nknew his last wife: she was a woman of breeding, good humour, and\r\ncomplaisance--knew how to live in the world. As for you, you look like a\r\npuppet moved by clockwork; your clothes hang upon you as they were upon\r\ntenter-hooks; and you come into a room as you were going to steal away\r\na pint pot. Get you gone in the country, to look after your mother's\r\npoultry, to milk the cows, churn the butter, and dress up nosegays for a\r\nholiday, and not meddle with matters which you know no more of than\r\nthe sign-post before your door. It is well known that Hocus has an\r\nestablished reputation; he never swore an oath, nor told a lie, in all\r\nhis life; he is grateful to his benefactors, faithful to his friends,\r\nliberal to his dependents, and dutiful to his superiors; he values not\r\nyour money more than the dust under his feet, but he hates to be abused.\r\nOnce for all, Mrs. Minx, leave off talking of Hocus, or I will pull out\r\nthese saucer-eyes of yours, and make that redstreak country face look as\r\nraw as an ox-cheek upon a butcher's-stall; remember, I say, that there\r\nare pillories and ducking-stools.\"*** With this away they flung, leaving\r\nMrs. Bull no time to reply. No stone was left unturned to frighten John\r\nfrom his composition. Sometimes they spread reports at coffee-houses\r\nthat John and his wife were run mad; that they intended to give up\r\nhouse, and make over all their estate to Lewis Baboon; that John had\r\nbeen often heard talking to himself, and seen in the streets without\r\nshoes or stockings; that he did nothing from morning till night but beat\r\nhis servants, after having been the best master alive. As for his wife,\r\nshe was a mere natural. Sometimes John's house was beset with a whole\r\nregiment of attornies' clerks, bailiffs, and bailiffs' followers, and\r\nother small retainers of the law, who threw stones at his windows, and\r\ndirt at himself as he went along the street. When John complained of\r\nwant of ready-money to carry on his suit, they advised him to pawn his\r\nplate and jewels, and that Mrs. Bull should sell her linen and wearing\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n     * Talk of peace, and the struggle of the party against it.\r\n\r\n     ** The endeavours made use of to stop the Treaty of Peace.\r\n\r\n     *** Reflections upon the House of Commons as ignorant, who\r\n     know nothing of business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. Mrs. Bull's vindication of the indispensable duty\r\nincumbent upon Wives in case of the Tyranny, Infidelity, or\r\nInsufficiency of Husbands; being a full Answer to the Doctor's Sermon\r\nagainst Adultery.*\r\n\r\n     * The Tories' representation of the speeches at Sacheverel's\r\n     trial.\r\n\r\nJohn found daily fresh proofs of the infidelity and bad designs of his\r\ndeceased wife; amongst other things, one day looking over his cabinet,\r\nhe found the following paper:--\r\n\r\n\"It is evident that matrimony is founded upon an original contract,\r\nwhereby the wife makes over the right she has by the law of Nature in\r\nfavour of the husband, by which he acquires the property of all her\r\nposterity. But, then, the obligation is mutual; and where the contract\r\nis broken on one side it ceases to bind on the other. Where there is a\r\nright there must be a power to maintain it and to punish the offending\r\nparty. This power I affirm to be that original right, or rather that\r\nindispensable duty lodged in all wives in the cases above mentioned.\r\nNo wife is bound by any law to which herself has not consented. All\r\neconomical government is lodged originally in the husband and wife, the\r\nexecutive part being in the husband; both have their privileges secured\r\nto them by law and reason; but will any man infer from the husband being\r\ninvested with the executive power, that the wife is deprived of her\r\nshare, and that she has no remedy left but preces and lacrymae, or\r\nan appeal to a supreme court of judicature? No less frivolous are the\r\narrangements that are drawn from the general appellations and terms\r\nof husband and wife. A husband denotes several different sorts of\r\nmagistracy, according to the usages and customs of different climates\r\nand countries. In some eastern nations it signifies a tyrant, with the\r\nabsolute power of life and death. In Turkey it denotes an arbitrary\r\ngovernor, with power of perpetual imprisonment; in Italy it gives the\r\nhusband the power of poison and padlocks; in the countries of England,\r\nFrance, and Holland, it has a quite different meaning, implying a free\r\nand equal government, securing to the wife in certain cases the liberty\r\nof change, and the property of pin-money and separate maintenance.\r\nSo that the arguments drawn from the terms of husband and wife are\r\nfallacious, and by no means fit to support a tyrannical doctrine, as\r\nthat of absolute unlimited chastity and conjugal fidelity.\r\n\r\n\"The general exhortations to fidelity in wives are meant only for\r\nrules in ordinary cases, but they naturally suppose three conditions\r\nof ability, justice, and fidelity in the husband; such an unlimited,\r\nunconditioned fidelity in the wife could never be supposed by reasonable\r\nmen. It seems a reflection upon the Church to charge her with doctrines\r\nthat countenance oppression.\r\n\r\n\"This doctrine of the original right of change is congruous to the law\r\nof Nature, which is superior to all human laws, and for that I dare\r\nappeal to all wives: It is much to the honour of our English wives that\r\nthey have never given up that fundamental point, and that though in\r\nformer ages they were muffled up in darkness and superstition, yet that\r\nnotion seemed engraven on their minds, and the impression so strong that\r\nnothing could impair it.\r\n\r\n\"To assert the illegality of change, upon any pretence whatsoever, were\r\nto cast odious colours upon the married state, to blacken the necessary\r\nmeans of perpetuating families--such laws can never be supposed to have\r\nbeen designed to defeat the very end of matrimony. I call them necessary\r\nmeans, for in many cases what other means are left? Such a doctrine\r\nwounds the honour of families, unsettles the titles to kingdoms,\r\nhonours, and estates; for if the actions from which such settlements\r\nspring were illegal, all that is built upon them must be so too; but\r\nthe last is absurd, therefore the first must be so likewise. What is the\r\ncause that Europe groans at present under the heavy load of a cruel and\r\nexpensive war, but the tyrannical custom of a certain nation, and the\r\nscrupulous nicety of a silly queen in not exercising this indispensable\r\nduty, whereby the kingdom might have had an heir, and a controverted\r\nsuccession might have been avoided. These are the effects of the narrow\r\nmaxims of your clergy, 'That one must not do evil that good may come of\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"The assertors of this indefeasible right, and jus divinum of matrimony,\r\ndo all in their hearts favour the pretenders to married women; for\r\nif the true legal foundation of the married state be once sapped, and\r\ninstead thereof tyrannical maxims introduced, what must follow but\r\nelopements instead of secret and peaceable change?\r\n\r\n\"From all that has been said, one may clearly perceive the absurdity\r\nof the doctrine of this seditious, discontented, hot-headed, ungifted,\r\nunedifying preacher, asserting 'that the grand security of the\r\nmatrimonial state, and the pillar upon which it stands, is founded upon\r\nthe wife's belief of an absolute unconditional fidelity to the husband;'\r\nby which bold assertion he strikes at the root, digs the foundation, and\r\nremoves the basis upon which the happiness of a married state is built.\r\nAs for his personal reflections, I would gladly know who are those\r\n'wanton wives' he speaks of? who are those ladies of high stations\r\nthat he so boldly traduces in his sermon? It is pretty plain who these\r\naspersions are aimed at, for which he deserves the pillory, or something\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\"In confirmation of this doctrine of the indispensable duty of change,\r\nI could bring the example of the wisest wives in all ages, who by these\r\nmeans have preserved their husband's families from ruin and oblivion\r\nby want of posterity; but what has been said is a sufficient ground for\r\npunishing this pragmatical parson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. The two great Parties of Wives, the Devotos and the Hitts.*\r\n\r\n     *Those who were for and against the doctrine of\r\n     nonresistance.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of unlimited fidelity in wives was universally espoused by\r\nall husbands, who went about the country and made the wives sign papers\r\nsignifying their utter detestation and abhorrence of Mrs. Bull's wicked\r\ndoctrine of the indispensable duty of change. Some yielded, others\r\nrefused to part with their native liberty, which gave rise to two great\r\nparties amongst the wives, the Devotos and the Hitts. Though, it must be\r\nowned, the distinction was more nominal than real; for the Devotos would\r\nabuse freedoms sometimes, and those who were distinguished by the name\r\nof Hitts were often very honest. At the same time there was an ingenious\r\ntreatise came out with the title of \"Good Advice to Husbands,\" in which\r\nthey are counselled not to trust too much to their wives owning the\r\ndoctrine of unlimited conjugal fidelity, and so to neglect a due\r\nwatchfulness over the manners of their wives; that the greatest security\r\nto husbands was a good usage of their wives and keeping them from\r\ntemptation, many husbands having been sufferers by their trusting too\r\nmuch to general professions, as was exemplified in the case of a foolish\r\nand negligent husband, who, trusting to the efficacy of this principle,\r\nwas undone by his wife's elopement from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. An Account of the Conference between Mrs. Bull and Don\r\nDiego.*\r\n\r\n     * A Tory nobleman who, by his influence upon the House of\r\n     Commons, endeavoured to stop the Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers, as their last effort to put off the composition, sent Don\r\nDiego to John. Don Diego was a very worthy gentleman, a friend to John,\r\nhis mother, and present wife, and, therefore, supposed to have some\r\ninfluence over her. He had been ill used himself by John's lawyers, but\r\nbecause of some animosity to Sir Roger was against the composition. The\r\nconference between him and Mrs. Bull was word for word as follows:--\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO.--Is it possible, cousin Bull, that you can forget the\r\nhonourable maxims of the family you are come of, and break your word\r\nwith three of the honestest, best-meaning persons in the world--Esquires\r\nSouth, Frog, and Hocus--that have sacrificed their interests to yours?\r\nIt is base to take advantage of their simplicity and credulity, and\r\nleave them in the lurch at last.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL--I am sure they have left my family in a bad condition, we\r\nhave hardly money to go to market; and nobody will take our words for\r\nsixpence. A very fine spark this Esquire South! My husband took him in,\r\na dirty boy. It was the business of half the servants to attend him.*\r\nThe rogue did bawl and make such a noise: sometimes he fell in the\r\nfire and burnt his face, sometimes broke his shins clambering over the\r\nbenches, and always came in so dirty, as if he had been dragged through\r\nthe kennel at a boarding-school. He lost his money at chuck-farthing,\r\nshuffle-cap, and all-fours; sold his books, pawned his linen, which we\r\nwere always forced to redeem. Then the whole generation of him are so in\r\nlove with bagpipes and puppet-shows! I wish you knew what my husband has\r\npaid at the pastry-cook's and confectioner's for Naples biscuits, tarts,\r\ncustards, and sweetmeats. All this while my husband considered him as\r\na gentleman of a good family that had fallen into decay, gave him\r\ngood education, and has settled him in a good creditable way of\r\nliving--having procured him, by his interest, one of the best places of\r\nthe country. And what return, think you, does this fine gentleman\r\nmake us? he will hardly give me or my husband a good word, or a civil\r\nexpression. Instead of Sir and Madam (which, though I say it, is our\r\ndue), he calls us \"goody\" and \"gaffer\" such-a-one; says he did us a\r\ngreat deal of honour to board with us; huffs and dings at such a rate,\r\nbecause we will not spend the little we have left to get him the title\r\nand estate of Lord Strutt; and then forsooth, we shall have the honour\r\nto be his woollen-drapers.** Besides, Esquire South will be Esquire\r\nSouth still; fickle, proud, and ungrateful. If he behaves himself so\r\nwhen he depends on us for his daily bread, can any man say what he will\r\ndo when he is got above the world?\r\n\r\n     * Something relating to the manners of a great prince,\r\n     superstition, love of operas, shows, etc.\r\n\r\n     ** Something relating to forms and titles.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO.--And would you lose the honour of so noble and generous an\r\nundertaking? Would you rather accept this scandalous composition, and\r\ntrust that old rogue, Lewis Baboon?\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--Look you, Friend Diego, if we law it on till Lewis turns\r\nhonest, I am afraid our credit will run low at Blackwell Hall. I wish\r\nevery man had his own; but I still say, that Lord Strutt's money shines\r\nas bright and chinks as well as Esquire South's. I don't know any other\r\nhold that we tradesmen have of these great folks but their interest: buy\r\ndear and sell cheap, and I warrant ye you will keep your customer. The\r\nworst is, that Lord Strutt's servants have got such a haunt about that\r\nold rogue's shop, that it will cost us many a firkin of strong beer to\r\nbring them back again; and the longer they are in a bad road, the harder\r\nit will be to get them out of it.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO.--But poor Frog, what has he done! On my conscience, if there\r\nbe an honest, sincere man in the world, it is that Frog.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--I think I need not tell you how much Frog has been obliged\r\nto our family from his childhood; he carries his head high now, but\r\nhe had never been the man he is without our help.* Ever since the\r\ncommencement of this lawsuit, it has been the business of Hocus, in\r\nsharing out expenses, to plead for Frog. \"Poor Frog,\" says he, \"is in\r\nhard circumstances, he has a numerous family, and lives from hand to\r\nmouth; his children don't eat a bit of good victuals from one year's end\r\nto the other, but live upon salt herring, sour curd, and borecole. He\r\ndoes his utmost, poor fellow, to keep things even in the world, and has\r\nexerted himself beyond his ability in this lawsuit; but he really has\r\nnot wherewithal to go on. What signifies this hundred pounds? place it\r\nupon your side of the account; it is a great deal to poor Frog, and a\r\ntrifle to you.\" This has been Hocus's constant language, and I am sure\r\nhe has had obligations enough to us to have acted another part.\r\n\r\n     * Complaints of the House of Commons of the unequal burden\r\n     of the war.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO.--No doubt Hocus meant all this for the best, but he is a\r\ntender-hearted, charitable man; Frog is indeed in hard circumstances.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL--Hard circumstances! I swear this is provoking to the last\r\ndegree. All the time of the lawsuit, as fast as I have mortgaged, Frog\r\nhas purchased: from a plain tradesman, with a shop, warehouse, and a\r\ncountry hut with a dirty fish-pond at the end of it, he is now grown a\r\nvery rich country gentleman, with a noble landed estate, noble palaces,\r\nmanors, parks, gardens, and farms, finer than any we were ever master\r\nof.* Is it not strange, when my husband disbursed great sums every\r\nterm, Frog should be purchasing some new farm or manor? so that if this\r\nlawsuit lasts, he will be far the richest man in his country. What is\r\nworse than all this, he steals away my customers every day; twelve of\r\nthe richest and the best have left my shop by his persuasion, and whom,\r\nto my certain knowledge, he has under bonds never to return again: judge\r\nyou if this be neighbourly dealing.\r\n\r\n     * The Dutch acquisitions in Flanders.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO--Frog is indeed pretty close in his dealings, but very honest:\r\nyou are so touchy, and take things so hotly, I am sure there must be\r\nsome mistake in this.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL--A plaguy one indeed! You know, and have often told me of it,\r\nhow Hocus and those rogues kept my husband, John Bull, drunk for five\r\nyears together with punch and strong waters: I am sure he never went one\r\nnight sober to bed, till they got him to sign the strangest deed that\r\never you saw in your life. The methods they took to manage him I'll tell\r\nyou another time; at present I'll read only the writing.\r\n\r\nArticles of Agreement betwixt JOHN BULL, Clothier, and NICHOLAS FROG,\r\nLinen-draper.*\r\n\r\n     * The sentiments of the House of Commons, and their\r\n     representation of the Barrier Treaty.\r\n\r\nI. That for maintaining the ancient good correspondence and friendship\r\nbetween the said parties, I, Nicholas Frog, do solemnly engage and\r\npromise to keep peace in John Bull's family; that neither his\r\nwife, children, nor servants, give him any trouble, disturbance, or\r\nmolestation whatsoever, but to oblige them all to do their duty quietly\r\nin their respective stations. And whereas the said John Bull, from\r\nthe assured confidence that he has in my friendship, has appointed me\r\nexecutor of his last will and testament, and guardian to his children, I\r\ndo undertake for me, my heirs and assigns, to see the same duly executed\r\nand performed, and that it shall be unalterable in all its parts by John\r\nBull, or anybody else: for that purpose it shall be lawful and allowable\r\nfor me to enter his house at any hour of the day or night, to break open\r\nbars, bolts, and doors, chests of drawers, and strong boxes, in order\r\nto secure the peace of my friend John Bull's family, and to see his will\r\nduly executed.\r\n\r\nII. In consideration of which kind neighbourly office of Nicholas Frog,\r\nin that he has been pleased to accept of the aforesaid trust, I, John\r\nBull, having duly considered that my friend, Nicholas Frog, at this\r\ntime lives in a marshy soil and unwholesome air, infested with fogs and\r\ndamps, destructive of the health of himself, wife, and children, do bind\r\nand oblige me, my heirs and assigns, to purchase for the said Nicholas\r\nFrog, with the best and readiest of my cash, bonds, mortgages, goods and\r\nchattels, a landed estate, with parks, gardens, palaces, rivers, fields,\r\nand outlets, consisting of as large extent as the said Nicholas Frog\r\nshall think fit. And whereas the said Nicholas Frog is at present hemmed\r\nin too close by the grounds of Lewis Baboon, master of the science of\r\ndefence, I, the said John Bull, do oblige myself with the readiest of my\r\ncash, to purchase and enclose the said grounds, for as many fields and\r\nacres as the said Nicholas shall think fit; to the intent that the said\r\nNicholas may have free egress and regress, without let or molestation,\r\nsuitable to the demands of himself and family.\r\n\r\nIII. Furthermore, the said John Bull obliges himself to make the country\r\nneighbours of Nicholas Frog allot a certain part of yearly rents, to pay\r\nfor the repairs of the said landed estate, to the intent that his good\r\nfriend, Nicholas Frog, may be eased of all charges.\r\n\r\nIV. And whereas the said Nicholas Frog did contract with the deceased\r\nLord Strutt about certain liberties, privileges, and immunities,\r\nformerly in the possession of the said John Bull, I, the said John Bull,\r\ndo freely by these presents, renounce, quit, and make over to the said\r\nNicholas, the liberties, privileges, and immunities contracted for, in\r\nas full a manner, as if they never had belonged to me.\r\n\r\nV. The said John Bull obliges himself, his heirs and assigns, not\r\nto sell one rag of broad or coarse cloth to any gentleman within the\r\nneighbourhood of the said Nicholas, except in such quantities and such\r\nrates as the said Nicholas shall think fit.\r\n\r\nSigned and sealed,\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL,\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.\r\n\r\nThe reading of this paper put Mrs. Bull in such a passion that she fell\r\ndownright into a fit, and they were forced to give her a good quantity\r\nof the spirit of hartshorn before she recovered.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO--Why in such a passion, cousin? considering your circumstances\r\nat that time, I don't think this such an unreasonable contract. You see\r\nFrog, for all this, is religiously true to his bargain; he scorns to\r\nhearken to any composition without your privacy.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--You know the contrary.* Read that letter.\r\n\r\n[Reads the superscription.] For Lewis Baboon, Master of the Noble\r\nScience of Defence.\r\n\r\n\"SIR.--I understand that you are at this time treating with my friend\r\nJohn Bull, about restoring the Lord Strutt's custom, and besides\r\nallowing him certain privileges of parks and fish-ponds; I wonder how\r\nyou that are a man that knows the world, can talk with that simple\r\nfellow. He has been my bubble these twenty years, and to my certain\r\nknowledge, understands no more of his own affairs than a child in\r\nswaddling clothes. I know he has got a sort of a pragmatical silly jade\r\nof a wife, that pretends to take him out of my hands; but you and she\r\nboth will find yourselves mistaken; I'll find those that shall manage\r\nher; and for him, he dares as well be hanged as make one step in his\r\naffairs without my consent. If you will give me what you promised him, I\r\nwill make all things easy, and stop the deeds of ejectment against Lord\r\nStrutt: if you will not, take what follows. I shall have a good action\r\nagainst you, for pretending to rob me of my bubble. Take this warning\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n\"Your loving friend,\r\n\r\n\"NIC. FROG.\"\r\n\r\n     * Secret negotiations of the Dutch at that time.\r\n\r\nI am told, cousin Diego, you are one of those that have undertaken to\r\nmanage me, and that you have said you will carry a green bag yourself,\r\nrather than we shall make an end of our lawsuit: I'll teach them and you\r\ntoo to manage.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO.--For God's sake, madam, why so choleric? I say this letter is\r\nsome forgery; it never entered into the head of that honest man, Nic.\r\nFrog, to do any such thing.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--I can't abide you. You have been railing these twenty years\r\nat Squire South, Frog, and Hocus, calling them rogues and pickpockets,\r\nand now they are turned the honestest fellows in the world. What is the\r\nmeaning of all this?\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO.--Pray tell me how you came to employ this Sir Roger in your\r\naffairs, and not think of your old friend Diego?\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--So, so, there it pinches. To tell you truth, I have employed\r\nSir Roger in several weighty affairs, and have found him trusty and\r\nhonest, and the poor man always scorned to take a farthing of me. I have\r\nabundance that profess great zeal, but they are damnable greedy of the\r\npence. My husband and I are now in such circumstances, that we must be\r\nserved upon cheaper terms than we have been.\r\n\r\nD. DIEGO.--Well, cousin, I find I can do no good with you; I am sorry\r\nthat you will ruin yourself by trusting this Sir Roger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How the guardians of the deceased Mrs. Bull's three\r\ndaughters came to John, and what advice they gave him; wherein is\r\nbriefly treated the characters of the three daughters. Also John Bull's\r\nanswer to the three guardians.*\r\n\r\n     * Concerns of the party, and speeches for carrying on the\r\n     war, etc. Sentiments of the Tories and House of Commons\r\n     against continuing the war for setting King Charles upon the\r\n     throne of Spain.\r\n\r\nI told you in a former chapter that Mrs. Bull, before she departed this\r\nlife, had blessed John with three daughters. I need not here repeat\r\ntheir names, neither would I willingly use any scandalous reflections\r\nupon young ladies, whose reputations ought to be very tenderly handled;\r\nbut the characters of these were so well known in the neighbourhood,\r\nthat it is doing them no injury to make a short description of them.\r\n\r\nThe eldest* was a termagant, imperious, prodigal, lewd, profligate\r\nwench, as ever breathed; she used to rantipole about the house, pinch\r\nthe children, kick the servants, and torture the cats and the dogs; she\r\nwould rob her father's strong box, for money to give the young fellows\r\nthat she was fond of. She had a noble air, and something great in her\r\nmien, but such a noisome infectious breath, as threw all the servants\r\nthat dressed her into consumptions; if she smelt to the freshest\r\nnosegay, it would shrivel and wither as it had been blighted: she used\r\nto come home in her cups, and break the china, and the looking-glasses;\r\nand was of such an irregular temper, and so entirely given up to her\r\npassion, that you might argue as well with the North wind, as with her\r\nladyship: so expensive, that the income of three dukedoms was not enough\r\nto supply her extravagance. Hocus loved her best, believing her to be\r\nhis own, got upon the body of Mrs. Bull.\r\n\r\n     * Polemia.\r\n\r\nThe second daughter,* born a year after her sister, was a peevish,\r\nfroward, ill-conditioned creature as ever was, ugly as the devil, lean,\r\nhaggard, pale, with saucer eyes, a sharp nose, and hunched backed; but\r\nactive, sprightly, and diligent about her affairs. Her ill complexion\r\nwas occasioned by her bad diet, which was coffee** morning, noon, and\r\nnight. She never rested quietly a-bed, but used to disturb the whole\r\nfamily with shrieking out in her dreams, and plague them next day with\r\ninterpreting them, for she took them all for gospel; she would cry\r\nout \"Murder!\" and disturb the whole neighbourhood; and when John came\r\nrunning downstairs to inquire what the matter was, nothing forsooth,\r\nonly her maid had stuck a pin wrong in her gown; she turned away one\r\nservant for putting too much oil in her salad, and another for putting\r\ntoo little salt in her water-gruel; but such as by flattery had procured\r\nher esteem, she would indulge in the greatest crime. Her father had\r\ntwo coachmen; when one was in the coach-box, if the coach swung but\r\nthe least to one side, she used to shriek so loud, that all the street\r\nconcluded she was overturned; but though the other was eternally drunk,\r\nand had overturned the whole family, she was very angry with her father\r\nfor turning him away. Then she used to carry tales and stories from one\r\nto another, till she had set the whole neighbourhood together by the\r\nears; and this was the only diversion she took pleasure in. She never\r\nwent abroad, but she brought home such a bundle of monstrous lies, as\r\nwould have amazed any mortal, but such as know her: of a whale that had\r\nswallowed a fleet of ships; of the lions being let out of the Tower,\r\nto destroy the Protestant religion; of the Pope's being seen in a\r\nbrandy-shop at Wapping; and a prodigious strong man that was going to\r\nshove down the cupola of St. Paul's; of three millions of five pound\r\npieces that Squire South had found under an old wall; of blazing stars,\r\nflying dragons, and abundance of such stuff. All the servants in the\r\nfamily made high court to her, for she domineered there, and turned out\r\nand in whom she pleased; only there was an old grudge between her and\r\nSir Roger, whom she mortally hated and used to hire fellows to squirt\r\nkennel water upon him as he passed along the streets; so that he was\r\nforced constantly to wear a surtout of oiled cloth, by which means he\r\ncame home pretty clean, except where the surtout was a little scanty.\r\n\r\n     * Discordia.\r\n\r\n     ** Coffee-house tattle.\r\n\r\nAs for the third* she was a thief and a common mercenary. She had no\r\nrespect of persons: a prince or a porter was all one, according as they\r\npaid; yea, she would leave the finest gentleman in the world to go to an\r\nugly fellow for sixpence more. In the practice of her profession she\r\nhad amassed vast magazines of all sorts of things: she had above five\r\nhundred suits of fine clothes, and yet went abroad like a cinder wench.\r\nShe robbed and starved all the servants, so that nobody could live near\r\nher.\r\n\r\n     * Usuria.\r\n\r\nSo much for John's three daughters, which you will say were rarities\r\nto be fond of. Yet Nature will shew itself. Nobody could blame their\r\nrelations for taking care of them, and therefore it was that Hocus, with\r\ntwo other of the guardians, thought it their duty to take care of the\r\ninterest of the three girls and give John their best advice before he\r\ncompounded the lawsuit.\r\n\r\nHOCUS.--What makes you so shy of late, my good friend? There's nobody\r\nloves you better than I, nor has taken more pains in your affairs. As\r\nI hope to be saved I would do anything to serve you; I would crawl upon\r\nall fours to serve you; I have spent my health and paternal estate in\r\nyour service. I have, indeed, a small pittance left, with which I might\r\nretire, and with as good a conscience as any man; but the thoughts of\r\nthis disgraceful composition so touches me to the quick that I cannot\r\nsleep. After I had brought the cause to the last stroke, that one\r\nverdict more had quite ruined old Lewis and Lord Strutt, and put you in\r\nthe quiet possession of everything--then to compound! I cannot bear it.\r\nThis cause was my favourite; I had set my heart upon it; it is like an\r\nonly child; I cannot endure it should miscarry. For God's sake consider\r\nonly to what a dismal condition old Lewis is brought. He is at an end of\r\nall his cash; his attorneys have hardly one trick left; they are at an\r\nend of all their chicane; besides, he has both his law and his daily\r\nbread now upon trust. Hold out only one term longer, and I'll warrant\r\nyou before the next we shall have him in the Fleet. I'll bring him to\r\nthe pillory; his ears shall pay for his perjuries. For the love of God\r\ndon't compound. Let me be damned if you have a friend in the world that\r\nloves you better than I. There is nobody can say I am covetous or that I\r\nhave any interests to pursue but yours.\r\n\r\nSECOND GUARDIAN.--There is nothing so plain as that this Lewis has a\r\ndesign to ruin all his neighbouring tradesmen, and at this time he has\r\nsuch a prodigious income by his trade of all kinds, that, if there\r\nis not some stop put to his exorbitant riches, he will monopolise\r\neverything; nobody will be able to sell a yard of drapery or mercery\r\nware but himself. I then hold it advisable that you continue the lawsuit\r\nand burst him at once. My concern for the three poor motherless children\r\nobliges me to give you this advice; for their estates, poor girls,\r\ndepend upon the success of this cause.\r\n\r\nTHIRD GUARDIAN.--I own this Writ of Ejectment has cost dear, but then\r\nconsider it is a jewel well worth the purchasing at the price of all\r\nyou have. None but Mr. Bull's declared enemies can say he has any other\r\nsecurity for his clothing trade but the ejectment of Lord Strutt. The\r\nonly question, then, that remains to be decided is: who shall stand the\r\nexpenses of the suit? To which the answer is as plain: who but he that\r\nis to have the advantage of the sentence? When Esquire South has got\r\npossession of his title and honour is not John Bull to be his clothier?\r\nWho, then, but John ought to put in possession? Ask but any indifferent\r\ngentleman, Who ought to bear his charges at law? and he will readily\r\nanswer, His tradesmen. I do therefore affirm, and I will go to death\r\nwith it, that, being his clothier, you ought to put him in quiet\r\npossession of his estate, and with the same generous spirit you have\r\nbegun it complete the good work. If you persist in the bad measures you\r\nare now in, what must become of the three poor orphans! My heart bleeds\r\nfor the poor girls.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--You are all very eloquent persons, but give me leave to tell\r\nyou you express a great deal more concern for the three girls than for\r\nme. I think my interest ought to be considered in the first place. As\r\nfor you, Hocus, I can't but say you have managed my lawsuit with great\r\naddress and much to my honour, and, though I say it, you have been well\r\npaid for it. Why must the burden be taken off Frog's back and laid upon\r\nmy shoulders? He can drive about his own parks and fields in his gilt\r\nchariot, when I have been forced to mortgage my estate; his note will\r\ngo farther than my bond. Is it not matter of fact, that from the richest\r\ntradesman in all the country, I am reduced to beg and borrow from\r\nscriveners and usurers that suck the heart, blood, and guts out of me,\r\nand what is all this for! Did you like Frog's countenance better than\r\nmine? Was not I your old friend and relation? Have I not presented you\r\nnobly? Have I not clad your whole family? Have you not had a hundred\r\nyards at a time of the finest cloth in my shop? Why must the rest of the\r\ntradesmen be not only indemnified from charges, but forbid to go on\r\nwith their own business, and what is more their concern than mine? As to\r\nholding out this term I appeal to your own conscience, has not that been\r\nyour constant discourse these six years, \"One term more and old Lewis\r\ngoes to pot?\" If thou art so fond of my cause be generous for once, and\r\nlend me a brace of thousands. Ah, Hocus! Hocus! I know thee: not a sous\r\nto save me from jail, I trow. Look ye, gentlemen, I have lived with\r\ncredit in the world, and it grieves my heart never to stir out of my\r\ndoors but to be pulled by the sleeve by some rascally dun or other.\r\n\"Sir, remember my bill. There's a small concern of a thousand pounds; I\r\nhope you think on't, sir.\" And to have these usurers transact my debts\r\nat coffee-houses and ale-houses, as if I were going to break up shop.\r\nLord! that ever the rich, the generous John Bull, clothier, the envy\r\nof all his neighbours, should be brought to compound his debts for five\r\nshillings in the pound, and to have his name in an advertisement for\r\na statute of bankrupt. The thought of it makes me mad. I have read\r\nsomewhere in the Apocrypha, \"That one should not consult with a woman\r\ntouching her of whom she is jealous; nor with a merchant concerning\r\nexchange; nor with a buyer, of selling; nor with an unmerciful man, of\r\nkindness, etc.\" I could have added one thing more: nor with an attorney\r\nabout compounding a lawsuit. The ejectment of Lord Strutt will never do.\r\nThe evidence is crimp: the witnesses swear backwards and forwards, and\r\ncontradict themselves; and his tenants stick by him. One tells me that\r\nI must carry on my suit, because Lewis is poor; another, because he is\r\nstill too rich: whom shall I believe? I am sure of one thing, that a\r\npenny in the purse is the best friend John can have at last, and who can\r\nsay that this will be the last suit I shall be engaged in? Besides,\r\nif this ejectment were practicable is it reasonable that, when Esquire\r\nSouth is losing his money to sharpers and pickpockets, going about the\r\ncountry with fiddlers and buffoons, and squandering his income with\r\nhawks and dogs, I should lay out the fruits of my honest industry in a\r\nlawsuit for him, only upon the hopes of being his clothier? And when\r\nthe cause is over I shall not have the benefit of my project for want of\r\nmoney to go to market. Look ye, gentlemen, John Bull is but a plain man,\r\nbut John Bull knows when he is ill used. I know the infirmity of our\r\nfamily: we are apt to play the boon-companion and throw away our money\r\nin our cups. But it was an unfair thing in you, gentlemen, to take\r\nadvantage of my weakness, to keep a parcel of roaring bullies about me\r\nday and night, with huzzas and hunting horns, and ringing the changes on\r\nbutcher's cleavers; never let me cool, and make me set my hand to papers\r\nwhen I could hardly hold my pen. There will come a day of reckoning for\r\nall that proceeding. In the meantime, gentlemen, I beg you will let me\r\ninto my affairs a little, and that you would not grudge me the small\r\nremainder of a very great estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. Esquire South's Message and Letter to Mrs. Bull.*\r\n\r\n     * Complaints of the deficiencies of the House of Austria,\r\n     Prince Eugene's journey and message.\r\n\r\nThe arguments used by Hocus and the rest of the guardians had hitherto\r\nproved insufficient. John and his wife could not be persuaded to bear\r\nthe expense of Esquire South's lawsuit. They thought it reasonable\r\nthat, since he was to have the honour and advantage, he should bear the\r\ngreatest share of the charges, and retrench what he lost to sharpers and\r\nspent upon country dances and puppet plays to apply it to that use. This\r\nwas not very grateful to the esquire; therefore, as the last experiment,\r\nhe was resolved to send Signior Benenato, master of his foxhounds, to\r\nMrs. Bull to try what good he could do with her. This Signior Benenato\r\nhad all the qualities of a fine gentleman that were set to charm a\r\nlady's heart, and if any person in the world could have persuaded her\r\nit was he. But such was her unshaken fidelity to her husband, and the\r\nconstant purpose of her mind to pursue his interest, that the most\r\nrefined arts of gallantry that were practised could not seduce her\r\nheart. The necklaces, diamond crosses, and rich bracelets that were\r\noffered she rejected with the utmost scorn and disdain. The music and\r\nserenades that were given her sounded more ungratefully in her ears than\r\nthe noise of a screech owl. However, she received Esquire South's letter\r\nby the hands of Signior Benenato with that respect which became his\r\nquality. The copy of the letter is as follows, in which you will observe\r\nhe changes a little his usual style:--\r\n\r\nMADAM,--The Writ of Ejectment against Philip Baboon (pretended Lord\r\nStrutt) is just ready to pass. There want but a few necessary forms and\r\na verdict or two more to put me in the quiet possession of my honour and\r\nestate. I question not but that, according to your wonted generosity and\r\ngoodness, you will give it the finishing stroke: an honour that I would\r\ngrudge anybody but yourself. In order to ease you of some part of the\r\ncharges, I promise to furnish pen, ink, and paper, provided you pay\r\nfor the stamps. Besides, I have ordered my stewards to pay out of the\r\nreadiest and best of my rents five pounds ten shillings a year till\r\nmy suit is finished. I wish you health and happiness, being with due\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nMadam, your assured friend,\r\n\r\nSOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat answer Mrs. Bull returned to this letter you shall know in\r\nmy second part, only they were at a pretty good distance in their\r\nproposals; for as Esquire South only offered to be at the charges of\r\npen, ink, and paper, Mrs. Bull refused any more than to lend her barge*\r\nto carry his counsel to Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\n     * Sending the English Fleet to convoy the forces to\r\n     Barcelona.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe world is much indebted to the famous Sir Humphry Polesworth for his\r\ningenious and impartial account of John Bull's lawsuit. Yet there is\r\njust cause of complaint against him, in that he relates it only by\r\nparcels, and won't give us the whole work. This forces me, who am only\r\nthe publisher, to bespeak the assistance of his friends and acquaintance\r\nto engage him to lay aside that stingey humour and gratify the curiosity\r\nof the public at once. He pleads in excuse that they are only private\r\nmemoirs, wrote for his own use in a loose style to serve as a help to\r\nhis ordinary conversation. I represented to him the good reception the\r\nfirst part had met with; that, though calculated only for the meridian\r\nof Grub Street, it was yet taken notice of by the better sort; that the\r\nworld was now sufficiently acquainted with John Bull, and interested\r\nitself in his concerns. He answered with a smile, that he had, indeed,\r\nsome trifling things to impart that concerned John Bull's relations and\r\ndomestic affairs. If these would satisfy me he gave me free leave to\r\nmake use of them, because they would serve to make the history of the\r\nlawsuit more intelligible. When I had looked over the manuscript I found\r\nlikewise some further account of the composition, which, perhaps, may\r\nnot be unacceptable to such as have read the former part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. The Character of John Bull's Mother.*\r\n\r\n     * The Church of England.\r\n\r\nJohn had a mother whom he loved and honoured extremely, a discreet,\r\ngrave, sober, good-conditioned, cleanly old gentlewoman as ever lived.\r\nShe was none of your cross-grained, termagant, scolding jades that one\r\nhad as good be hanged as live in the house with, such as are always\r\ncensuring the conduct and telling scandalous stories of their\r\nneighbours, extolling their own good qualities and undervaluing those\r\nof others. On the contrary, she was of a meek spirit, and, as she was\r\nstrictly virtuous herself, so she always put the best construction\r\nupon the words and actions of her neighbours, except where they were\r\nirreconcileable to the rules of honesty and decency. She was neither\r\none of your precise prudes, nor one of your fantastical old belles that\r\ndress themselves like girls of fifteen; as she neither wore a ruff,\r\nforehead-cloth, nor high-crowned hat, so she had laid aside feathers,\r\nflowers, and crimpt ribbons in her head-dress, furbelow-scarfs, and\r\nhooped-petticoats. She scorned to patch and paint, yet she loved to\r\nkeep her hands and her face clean. Though she wore no flaunting laced\r\nruffles, she would not keep herself in a constant sweat with greasy\r\nflannel. Though her hair was not stuck with jewels, she was not ashamed\r\nof a diamond cross; she was not, like some ladies, hung about with toys\r\nand trinkets, tweezer-cases, pocket-glasses, and essence-bottles; she\r\nused only a gold watch and an almanack to mark the hours and the holy\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHer furniture was neat and genteel, well fancied with a bon gout. As she\r\naffected not the grandeur of a state with a canopy, she thought there\r\nwas no offence in an elbow-chair. She had laid aside your carving,\r\ngilding, and Japan work as being too apt to gather dirt. But she never\r\ncould be prevailed upon to part with plain wainscot and clean hangings.\r\nThere are some ladies that affect to smell a stink in everything; they\r\nare always highly perfumed, and continually burning frankincense in\r\ntheir rooms. She was above such affectation, yet she never would lay\r\naside the use of brooms and scrubbing-brushes, and scrupled not to lay\r\nher linen in fresh lavender.\r\n\r\nShe was no less genteel in her behaviour, well-bred, without\r\naffectation; in the due mean between one of your affected, curtseying\r\npieces of formality and your romps that have no regard to the common\r\nrules of civility. There are some ladies that affect a mighty regard for\r\ntheir relations. \"We must not eat to-day, for my uncle Tom, or my cousin\r\nBetty, died this time ten years. Let's have a ball to-night, it is my\r\nneighbour Such-a-one's birthday.\" She looked upon all this as grimace,\r\nyet she constantly observed her husband's birthday, her wedding-day, and\r\nsome few more.\r\n\r\nThough she was a truly good woman, and had a sincere motherly love for\r\nher son John, yet there wanted not those who endeavoured to create a\r\nmisunderstanding between them, and they had so far prevailed with him\r\nonce that he turned her out of doors, to his great sorrow, as he found\r\nafterwards, for his affairs went on at sixes and sevens.\r\n\r\nShe was no less judicious in the turn of her conversation and choice of\r\nher studies, in which she far exceeded all her sex. Your rakes that hate\r\nthe company of all sober, grave gentlewomen would bear hers, and she\r\nwould, by her handsome manner of proceeding, sooner reclaim than some\r\nthat were more sour and reserved. She was a zealous preacher up of\r\nconjugal fidelity in wives, and by no means a friend to the new-fangled\r\ndoctrine of the indispensable duty of change. Though she advanced her\r\nopinions with a becoming assurance, yet she never ushered them in as\r\nsome positive creatures will do, with dogmatical assertions. \"This is\r\ninfallible; I cannot be mistaken; none but a rogue can deny it.\" It has\r\nbeen observed that such people are oftener in the wrong than anybody.\r\n\r\nThough she had a thousand good qualities, she was not without her\r\nfaults, amongst which one might, perhaps, reckon too great lenity to\r\nher servants, to whom she always gave good counsel, but often too\r\ngentle correction. I thought I could not say less of John Bull's mother,\r\nbecause she bears a part in the following transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. The Character of John Bull's Sister Peg,* with the Quarrels\r\nthat happened between Master and Miss in their Childhood.\r\n\r\n     * The nation and Church of Scotland.\r\n\r\nJohn had a sister, a poor girl that had been starved at nurse. Anybody\r\nwould have guessed Miss to have been bred up under the influence of a\r\ncruel stepdame, and John to be the fondling of a tender mother. John\r\nlooked ruddy and plump, with a pair of cheeks like a trumpeter; Miss\r\nlooked pale and wan, as if she had the green sickness; and no wonder,\r\nfor John was the darling: he had all the good bits, was crammed with\r\ngood pullet, chicken, pig, goose, and capon; while Miss had only a\r\nlittle oatmeal and water, or a dry crust without butter. John had his\r\ngolden pippins, peaches, and nectarines; poor Miss, a crab-apple, sloe,\r\nor a blackberry. Master lay in the best apartment, with his bedchamber\r\ntowards the south sun. Miss lodged in a garret exposed to the north\r\nwind, which shrivelled her countenance. However, this usage, though it\r\nstunted the girl in her growth, gave her a hardy constitution; she had\r\nlife and spirit in abundance, and knew when she was ill-used. Now and\r\nthen she would seize upon John's commons, snatch a leg of a pullet, or\r\na bit of good beef, for which they were sure to go to fisticuffs. Master\r\nwas indeed too strong for her, but Miss would not yield in the least\r\npoint; but even when Master had got her down, she would scratch and bite\r\nlike a tiger; when he gave her a cuff on the ear, she would prick him\r\nwith her knitting-needle. John brought a great chain one day to tie her\r\nto the bedpost, for which affront Miss aimed a penknife at his heart. In\r\nshort, these quarrels grew up to rooted aversions; they gave one another\r\nnicknames, though the girl was a tight clever wench as any was, and\r\nthrough her pale looks you might discern spirit and vivacity, which made\r\nher not, indeed, a perfect beauty, but something that was agreeable. It\r\nwas barbarous in parents not to take notice of these early quarrels, and\r\nmake them live better together, such domestic feuds proving afterwards\r\nthe occasion of misfortunes to them both. Peg had, indeed, some odd\r\nhumours* and comical antipathy, for which John would jeer her. \"What\r\nthink you of my sister Peg,\" says he, \"that faints at the sound of an\r\norgan, and yet will dance and frisk at the noise of a bagpipe?\" \"What's\r\nthat to you?\" quoth Peg. \"Everybody's to choose their own music.\" Then\r\nPeg had taken a fancy not to say her Paternoster, which made people\r\nimagine strange things of her. Of the three brothers that have made such\r\na clutter in the world--Lord Peter, Martin, and Jack--Jack had of late\r\nbeen her inclinations. Lord Peter she detested, nor did Martin stand\r\nmuch better in her good graces; but Jack had found the way to her heart.\r\nI have often admired what charms she discovered in that awkward booby,\r\ntill I talked with a person that was acquainted with the intrigue, who\r\ngave me the following account of it.\r\n\r\n     * Love of Presbytery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. Jack's Charms,* or the Method by which he gained Peg's\r\nHeart.\r\n\r\n     * Character of the Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Jack was a very young fellow, by much the youngest\r\nof the three brothers, and people, indeed, wondered how such a young\r\nupstart jackanapes should grow so pert and saucy, and take so much upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJack bragged of greater abilities than other men. He was well gifted,\r\nas he pretended: I need not tell you what secret influence that has upon\r\nthe ladies.\r\n\r\nJack had a most scandalous tongue, and persuaded Peg that all mankind,\r\nbesides himself, were plagued by that scarlet-faced woman, Signiora\r\nBubonia.* \"As for his brother, Lord Peter, the tokens were evident on\r\nhim--blotches and scabs. His brother Martin, though he was not quite\r\nso bad, had some nocturnal pains, which his friends pretended were only\r\nscorbutical; but he was sure it proceeded from a worse cause.\" By such\r\nmalicious insinuations he had possessed the lady that he was the only\r\nman in the world of a sound, pure, and untainted constitution, though\r\nthere were some that stuck not to say that Signiora Bubonia and Jack\r\nrailed at one another only the better to hide an intrigue, and that Jack\r\nhad been found with Signiora under his cloak, carrying her home on a\r\ndark stormy night.\r\n\r\n     * The Woman of Babylon, or the Pope.\r\n\r\nJack was a prodigious ogler; he would ogle you the outside of his eye\r\ninward, and the white upward.\r\n\r\nJack gave himself out for a man of a great estate in the Fortunate\r\nIslands, of which the sole property was vested in his person. By this\r\ntrick he cheated abundance of poor people of small sums, pretending to\r\nmake over plantations in the said islands; but when the poor wretches\r\ncame there with Jack's grant, they were beat, mocked, and turned out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nI told you that Peg was whimsical, and loved anything that was\r\nparticular. In that way Jack was her man, for he neither thought, spoke,\r\ndressed, nor acted like other mortals. He was for your bold strokes. He\r\nrailed at fops, though he was himself the most affected in the world;\r\ninstead of the common fashion, he would visit his mistress in a\r\nmourning-cloak, band, short cuffs, and a peaked beard. He invented a way\r\nof coming into a room backwards, which he said showed more humility and\r\nless affectation. Where other people stood, he sat; where they sat, he\r\nstood; when he went to Court, he used to kick away the state, and sit\r\ndown by his prince cheek by jowl. \"Confound these states,\" says he,\r\n\"they are a modern invention.\" When he spoke to his prince, he always\r\nturned his back upon him. If he was advised to fast for his health, he\r\nwould eat roast beef; if he was allowed a more plentiful diet, then\r\nhe would be sure that day to live upon water-gruel; he would cry at a\r\nwedding, laugh and make jests at a funeral.\r\n\r\nHe was no less singular in his opinions. You would have burst your sides\r\nto hear him talk of politics. \"All government,\" says he, \"is founded\r\nupon the right distribution of punishments: decent executions keep\r\nthe world in awe; for that reason, the majority of mankind ought to be\r\nhanged every year. For example, I suppose the magistrate ought to pass\r\nan irreversible sentence upon all blue-eyed children from the cradle;\r\nbut that there may be some show of justice in this proceeding, these\r\nchildren ought to be trained up by masters, appointed for that purpose,\r\nto all sorts of villany, that they may deserve their fate, and the\r\nexecution of them may serve as an object of terror to the rest of\r\nmankind.\"* As to the giving of pardons, he had this singular method:**\r\nthat when these wretches had the rope about their necks, it should be\r\ninquired who believed they should be hanged, and who not? The first were\r\nto be pardoned, the last hanged outright. Such as were once pardoned\r\nwere never to be hanged afterwards for any crime whatsoever. He had such\r\nskill in physiognomy, that he would pronounce peremptorily upon a man's\r\nface. \"That fellow,\" says he, \"do what he will, can't avoid hanging;\r\nhe has a hanging look.\" By the same art he would prognosticate a\r\nprincipality to a scoundrel.\r\n\r\n     * Absolute predestination and reprobation.\r\n\r\n     ** Saving Faith:  a belief that one shall certainly be\r\n     saved.\r\n\r\nHe was no less particular in the choice of his studies; they were\r\ngenerally bent towards exploded chimeras*--the perpetuum mobile, the\r\ncircular shot, philosopher's stone, silent gunpowder, making chains\r\nfor fleas, nets for flies, and instruments to unravel cobwebs and split\r\nhairs.\r\n\r\n     * The learning of the Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nThus, I think, I have given a distinct account of the methods he\r\npractised upon Peg. Her brother would now and then ask her, \"What dost\r\nthou see in that pragmatical coxcomb to make thee so in love with him?\r\nHe is a fit match for a tailor's or a shoemaker's daughter, but not for\r\nyou that are a gentlewoman?\" \"Fancy is free,\" quoth Peg; \"I'll take my\r\nown way, do you take yours. I do not care for your flaunting beaus, that\r\ngang with their breasts open, and their sarks over their waistcoats,\r\nthat accost me with set speeches out of Sidney's 'Arcadia' or the\r\n'Academy of Compliments.' Jack is a sober, grave young man; though he\r\nhas none of your studied harangues, his meaning is sincere. He has a\r\ngreat regard to his father's will, and he that shows himself a good son\r\nwill make a good husband. Besides, I know he has the original deed of\r\nconveyance to the Fortunate Islands; the others are counterfeits.\" There\r\nis nothing so obstinate as a young lady in her amours; the more you\r\ncross her, the worse she is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. How the relations reconciled John and his sister Peg, and\r\nwhat return Peg made to John's message.*\r\n\r\n     * The Treaty of Union.  Reason of it:  the Succession not\r\n     being settled in Scotland.  Fears for the Presbyterian\r\n     Church Government, and of being burdened with the English\r\n     National Debts.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull, otherwise a good-natured man, was very hard-hearted to his\r\nsister Peg, chiefly from an aversion he had conceived in his infancy.\r\nWhile he flourished, kept a warm house, and drove a plentiful trade,\r\npoor Peg was forced to go hawking and peddling about the streets selling\r\nknives, scissors, and shoe-buckles; now and then carried a basket of\r\nfish to the market; sewed, spun, and knit for a livelihood, till her\r\nfingers' ends were sore; and when she could not get bread for her\r\nfamily, she was forced to hire them out at journey-work to her\r\nneighbours. Yet in these her poor circumstances she still preserved\r\nthe air and mien of a gentlewoman--a certain decent pride that extorted\r\nrespect from the haughtiest of her neighbours. When she came in to any\r\nfull assembly, she would not yield the pas to the best of them. If one\r\nasked her, \"Are not you related to John Bull?\" \"Yes,\" says she, \"he\r\nhas the honour to be my brother.\" So Peg's affairs went till all the\r\nrelations cried out shame upon John for his barbarous usage of his own\r\nflesh and blood; that it was an easy matter for him to put her in a\r\ncreditable way of living, not only without hurt, but with advantage to\r\nhimself, seeing she was an industrious person, and might be serviceable\r\nto him in his way of business. \"Hang her, jade,\" quoth John, \"I can't\r\nendure her as long as she keeps that rascal Jack's company.\" They told\r\nhim the way to reclaim her was to take her into his house; that by\r\nconversation the childish humours of their younger days might be worn\r\nout. These arguments were enforced by a certain incident. It happened\r\nthat John was at that time about making his will* and entailing his\r\nestate, the very same in which Nic. Frog is named executor. Now, his\r\nsister Peg's name being in the entail, he could not make a thorough\r\nsettlement without her consent. There was, indeed, a malicious story\r\nwent about as if John's last wife had fallen in love with Jack as he\r\nwas eating custard on horseback;** that she persuaded John to take his\r\nsister into the house the better to drive on the intrigue with Jack,\r\nconcluding he would follow his mistress Peg. All I can infer from this\r\nstory is that when one has got a bad character in the world people will\r\nreport and believe anything of them, true or false. But to return to\r\nmy story. When Peg received John's message she huffed and stormed:\r\n\"My brother John,\" quoth she, \"is grown wondrous kind-hearted all of\r\na sudden, but I meikle doubt whether it be not mair for their own\r\nconveniency than for my good; he draws up his writs and his deeds,\r\nforsooth, and I must set my hand to them, unsight, unseen. I like the\r\nyoung man he has settled upon well enough, but I think I ought to have\r\na valuable consideration for my consent. He wants my poor little farm\r\nbecause it makes a nook in his park-wall. Ye may e'en tell him he has\r\nmair than he makes good use of; he gangs up and down drinking, roaring,\r\nand quarrelling, through all the country markets, making foolish\r\nbargains in his cups, which he repents when he is sober; like a\r\nthriftless wretch, spending the goods and gear that his forefathers\r\nwon with the sweat of their brows: light come, light go, he cares not a\r\nfarthing. But why should I stand surety for his contracts? The little I\r\nhave is free, and I can call it my awn--hame's hame, let it be never so\r\nhamely. I ken him well enough, he could never abide me, and when he has\r\nhis ends he'll e'en use me as he did before. I'm sure I shall be treated\r\nlike a poor drudge--I shall be set to tend the bairns, darn the hose,\r\nand mend the linen. Then there's no living with that old carline his\r\nmother; she rails at Jack, and Jack's an honester man than any of her\r\nkin: I shall be plagued with her spells and her Paternosters, and silly\r\nold world ceremonies; I mun never pare my nails on a Friday, nor begin a\r\njourney on Childermas Day; and I mun stand beeking and binging as I\r\ngang out and into the hall. Tell him he may e'en gang his get; I'll have\r\nnothing to do with him; I'll stay like the poor country mouse, in my awn\r\nhabitation.\" So Peg talked; but for all that, by the interposition of\r\ngood friends, and by many a bonny thing that was sent, and many more\r\nthat were promised Peg, the matter was concluded, and Peg taken into the\r\nhouse upon certain articles:*** one of which was that she might have the\r\nfreedom of Jack's conversation, and might take him for better and for\r\nworse if she pleased: provided always he did not come into the house at\r\nunseasonable hours and disturb the rest of the old woman, John's mother.\r\n\r\n     * The Act of Succession.\r\n\r\n     ** A Presbyterian Lord Mayor.\r\n\r\n     *** The Act of Toleration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. Of some Quarrels that happened after Peg was taken into the\r\nFamily.*\r\n\r\n     *Quarrels about some of the Articles of Union, particularly\r\n     the peerage.\r\n\r\nIt is an old observation that the quarrels of relations are harder to\r\nreconcile than any other; injuries from friends fret and gall more,\r\nand the memory of them is not so easily obliterated. This is cunningly\r\nrepresented by one of your old sages called Aesop, in the story of the\r\nbird that was grieved extremely at being wounded with an arrow feathered\r\nwith his own wing; as also of the oak that let many a heavy groan when\r\nhe was cleft with a wedge of his own timber.\r\n\r\nThere was no man in the world less subject to rancour than John Bull,\r\nconsidering how often his good nature has been abused; yet I don't\r\nknow but he was too apt to hearken to tattling people that carry tales\r\nbetween him and his sister Peg, on purpose to sow jealousies and set\r\nthem together by the ears. They say that there were some hardships put\r\nupon Peg which had been better let alone; but it was the business\r\nof good people to restrain the injuries on one side and moderate the\r\nresentments on the other--a good friend acts both parts, the one without\r\nthe other will not do.\r\n\r\nThe purchase-money of Peg's farm was ill paid;* then Peg loved a little\r\ngood liquor, and the servants shut up the wine-cellar; but for that Peg\r\nfound a trick, for she made a false key.** Peg's servants complained\r\nthat they were debarred from all manner of business, and never suffered\r\nto touch the least thing within the house; if they offered to come into\r\nthe warehouse, then straight went the yard slap over their noddle; if\r\nthey ventured into the counting-room a fellow would throw an ink-bottle\r\nat their head; if they came into the best apartment to set anything\r\nthere in order, they were saluted with a broom; if they meddled with\r\nanything in the kitchen it was odds but the cook laid them over the pate\r\nwith a ladle; one that would have got into the stables was met by two\r\nrascals, who fell to work with him with a brush and a curry-comb; some\r\nclimbing up into the coachbox, were told that one of their companions\r\nhad been there before that could not drive, then slap went the long whip\r\nabout their ears.\r\n\r\n     * The equivalent not paid.\r\n\r\n     ** Run wine.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was complained that Peg's servants were always\r\nasking for drink-money; that they had more than their share of the\r\nChristmas-box.* To say the truth, Peg's lads bustled pretty hard for\r\nthat, for when they were endeavouring to lock it up they got in their\r\ngreat fists and pulled out handfuls of halfcrowns, shillings, and\r\nsixpences. Others in the scramble picked up guineas and broad-pieces.\r\nBut there happened a worse thing than all this: it was complained that\r\nPeg's servants had great stomachs, and brought so many of their friends\r\nand acquaintance to the table that John's family was like to be eaten\r\nout of house and home. Instead of regulating this matter as it ought to\r\nbe, Peg's young men were thrust away from the table; then there was the\r\ndevil and all to do--spoons, plates, and dishes flew about the room like\r\nmad, and Sir Roger, who was now Majordomo, had enough to do to quiet\r\nthem. Peg said this was contrary to agreement, whereby she was in all\r\nthings to be treated like a child of the family. Then she called upon\r\nthose that had made her such fair promises, and undertook for her\r\nbrother John's good behaviour; but, alas! to her cost she found that\r\nthey were the first and readiest to do her the injury. John at last\r\nagreed to this regulation: that Peg's footmen might sit with his\r\nbook-keeper, journeymen, and apprentices, and Peg's better sort of\r\nservants might sit with his footmen if they pleased.**\r\n\r\n     * Endeavoured to get their share of places.\r\n\r\n     ** Articles of Union, whereby they could make a Scot's\r\n     commoner, but not a lord a peer.\r\n\r\nThen they began to order plum-porridge and minced pies for Peg's dinner.\r\nPeg told them she had an aversion to that sort of food; that upon\r\nforcing down a mess of it some years ago it threw her into a fit till\r\nshe brought it up again. Some alleged it was nothing but humour, that\r\nthe same mess should be served up again for supper, and breakfast next\r\nmorning; others would have made use of a horn, but the wiser sort bid\r\nlet her alone, and she might take to it of her own accord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. The conversation between John Bull and his wife.*\r\n\r\n     * The history of the Partition Treaty; suspicions at that\r\n     time that the French King intended to take the whole, and\r\n     that he revealed the secret to the Court of Spain.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--Though our affairs, honey, are in a bad condition, I have\r\na better opinion of them since you seemed to be convinced of the ill\r\ncourse you have been in, and are resolved to submit to proper remedies.\r\nBut when I consider your immense debts, your foolish bargains, and the\r\ngeneral disorder of your business, I have a curiosity to know what fate\r\nor chance has brought you into this condition.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I wish you would talk of some other subject, the thoughts of\r\nit makes me mad; our family must have their run.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--But such a strange thing as this never happened to any of\r\nyour family before: they have had lawsuits, but, though they spent the\r\nincome, they never mortgaged the stock. Sure, you must have some of the\r\nNorman or the Norfolk blood in you. Prithee, give me some account of\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Who could help it? There lives not such a fellow by bread as\r\nthat old Lewis Baboon: he is the most cheating, contentious rogue upon\r\nthe face of the earth. You must know, one day, as Nic. Frog and I were\r\nover a bottle making up an old quarrel, the old fellow would needs have\r\nus drink a bottle of his champagne, and so one after another, till my\r\nfriend Nic. and I, not being used to such heady stuff, got very drunk.\r\nLewis all the while, either by the strength of his brain or flinching\r\nhis glass, kept himself sober as a judge. \"My worthy friends,\" quoth\r\nLewis, \"henceforth let us live neighbourly; I am as peaceable and quiet\r\nas a lamb of my own temper, but it has been my misfortune to live among\r\nquarrelsome neighbours. There is but one thing can make us fall out,\r\nand that is the inheritance of Lord Strutt's estate: I am content, for\r\npeace' sake, to waive my right, and submit to any expedient to prevent\r\na lawsuit; I think an equal division* will be the fairest way.\" \"Well\r\nmoved, Old Lewis,\" quoth Frog, \"and I hope my friend John here will\r\nnot be refractory.\" At the same time he clapped me on the back, and\r\nslabbered me all over from cheek to cheek with his great tongue. \"Do as\r\nyou please, gentlemen,\" quoth I, \"'tis all one to John Bull.\" We agreed\r\nto part that night, and next morning to meet at the corner of Lord\r\nStrutt's park wall, with our surveying instruments, which accordingly\r\nwe did. Old Lewis carried a chain and a semicircle; Nic., paper, rulers,\r\nand a lead pencil; and I followed at some distance with a long pole. We\r\nbegan first with surveying the meadow grounds, afterwards we measured\r\nthe cornfields, close by close; then we proceeded to the woodlands, the\r\ncopper and tin mines.** All this while Nic. laid down everything exactly\r\nupon paper, calculated the acres and roods to a great nicety. When\r\nwe had finished the land, we were going to break into the house\r\nand gardens, to take an inventory of his plate, pictures, and other\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n     * The Partition Treaty.\r\n\r\n     ** The West Indies.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--What said Lord Strutt to all this?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--As we had almost finished our concern, we were accosted by\r\nsome of Lord Strutt's servants. \"Heyday! what's here? what a devil's\r\nthe meaning of all these trangrams and gimcracks, gentlemen? What in the\r\nname of wonder, are you going about, jumping over my master's hedges,\r\nand running your lines cross his grounds? If you are at any field\r\npastime, you might have asked leave: my master is a civil well-bred\r\nperson as any is.\"\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--What could you answer to this?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Why, truly, my neighbour Frog and I were still hot-headed;\r\nwe told him his master was an old doting puppy, that minded nothing of\r\nhis own business; that we were surveying his estate, and settling it\r\nfor him, since he would not do it himself. Upon this there happened a\r\nquarrel, but we being stronger than they, sent them away with a flea in\r\ntheir ear. They went home and told their master. \"My lord,\" say they,\r\n\"there are three odd sort of fellows going about your grounds with the\r\nstrangest machines that ever we beheld in our life: I suppose they are\r\ngoing to rob your orchard, fell your trees, or drive away your cattle.\r\nThey told us strange things of settling your estate--one is a lusty\r\nold fellow in a black wig, with a black beard, without teeth; there's\r\nanother, thick squat fellow, in trunk hose; the third is a little,\r\nlong-nosed, thin man (I was then lean, being just come out of a fit\r\nof sickness)--I suppose it is fit to send after them, lest they carry\r\nsomething away?\"\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--I fancy this put the old fellow in a rare tweague.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Weak as he was, he called for his long Toledo, swore and\r\nbounced about the room: \"'Sdeath! what am I come to, to be affronted\r\nso by my tradesmen? I know the rascals: my barber, clothier, and\r\nlinen-draper dispose of my estate! Bring hither my blunderbuss; I'll\r\nwarrant ye you shall see daylight through them. Scoundrels! dogs! the\r\nscum of the earth! Frog, that was my father's kitchen-boy, he pretend to\r\nmeddle with my estate--with my will! Ah, poor Strutt! what are thou come\r\nto at last? Thou hast lived too long in the world, to see thy age and\r\ninfirmity so despised! How will the ghosts of my noble ancestors receive\r\nthese tidings?--they cannot, they must not sleep quietly in their\r\ngraves.\" In short, the old gentleman was carried off in a fainting fit,\r\nand after bleeding in both arms hardly recovered.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--Really this was a very extraordinary way of proceeding! I\r\nlong to hear the rest of it.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--After we had come back to the tavern, and taken t'other\r\nbottle of champagne, we quarrelled a little about the division of the\r\nestate. Lewis hauled and pulled the map on one side and Frog and I on\r\nt'other, till we had like to have tore the parchment to pieces. At last\r\nLewis pulled out a pair of great tailor's shears and clipt a corner for\r\nhimself, which he said was a manor that lay convenient for him, and left\r\nFrog and me the rest to dispose of as we pleased. We were overjoyed to\r\nthink Lewis was contented with so little, not smelling what was at the\r\nbottom of the plot. There happened, indeed, an incident that gave us\r\nsome disturbance. A cunning fellow, one of my servants, two days after,\r\npeeping through the keyhole, observed that old Lewis had stole away\r\nour part of the map, and saw him fiddling and turning the map from one\r\ncorner to the other, trying to join the two pieces together again. He\r\nwas muttering something to himself, which he did not well hear, only\r\nthese words, \"'Tis great pity! 'tis great pity!\" My servant added that\r\nhe believed this had some ill meaning. I told him he was a coxcomb,\r\nalways pretending to be wiser than his companions. Lewis and I are good\r\nfriends, he's an honest fellow, and I daresay will stand to his bargain.\r\nThe sequel of the story proved this fellow's suspicion to be too well\r\ngrounded; for Lewis revealed our whole secret to the deceased Lord\r\nStrutt, who in reward for his treachery, and revenge to Frog and\r\nme, settled his whole estate upon the present Philip Baboon. Then we\r\nunderstood what he meant by piecing the map together.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--And were you surprised at this? Had not Lord Strutt\r\nreason to be angry? Would you have been contented to have been so used\r\nyourself?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Why, truly, wife, it was not easily reconciled to the common\r\nmethods; but then it was the fashion to do such things. I have read of\r\nyour golden age, your silver age, etc.; one might justly call this\r\nthe age of the lawyers. There was hardly a man of substance in all the\r\ncountry but had a counterfeit that pretended to his estate.* As the\r\nphilosophers say that there is a duplicate of every terrestrial animal\r\nat sea, so it was in this age of the lawyers: there were at least two\r\nof everything; nay, o' my conscience, I think there were three Esquire\r\nHackums** at one time. In short, it was usual for a parcel of fellows\r\nto meet and dispose of the whole estates in the country. \"This lies\r\nconvenient for me, Tom. Thou wouldst do more good with that, Dick, than\r\nthe old fellow that has it.\" So to law they went with the true owners:\r\nthe lawyers got well by it; everybody else was undone. It was a common\r\nthing for an honest man when he came home at night to find another\r\nfellow domineering in his family, hectoring his servants, and calling\r\nfor supper. In every house you might observe two Sosias quarrelling who\r\nwas master. For my own part, I am still afraid of the same treatment:\r\nthat I should find somebody behind my counter selling my broad-cloth.\r\n\r\n     * Several Pretenders at that time.\r\n\r\n     ** Kings of England.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--There is a sort of fellows they call banterers and\r\nbamboozlers that play such tricks, but it seems these fellows were in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I begin to think that justice is a better rule than\r\nconveniency, for all some people make so slight on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. Of the hard shifts Mrs. Bull was put to preserve the Manor\r\nof Bullock's Hatch, with Sir Roger's method to keep off importunate\r\nduns.*\r\n\r\n     * Some attempts to destroy the public credit at that time.\r\n     Manners of the Earl of Oxford.\r\n\r\nAs John Bull and his wife were talking together they were surprised with\r\na sudden knocking at the door. \"Those wicked scriveners and lawyers, no\r\ndoubt,\" quoth John; and so it was, some asking for the money he owed,\r\nand others warning to prepare for the approaching term. \"What a cursed\r\nlife do I lead!\" quoth John; \"debt is like deadly sin. For God's sake,\r\nSir Roger, get me rid of the fellows.\" \"I'll warrant you,\" quoth Sir\r\nRoger; \"leave them to me.\" And, indeed, it was pleasant enough to\r\nobserve Sir Roger's method with these importunate duns. His sincere\r\nfriendship for John Bull made him submit to many things for his service\r\nwhich he would have scorned to have done for himself. Sometimes he would\r\nstand at the door with his long staff to keep off the duns, until\r\nJohn got out at the back door. When the lawyers and tradesmen brought\r\nextravagant bills Sir Roger used to bargain beforehand for leave to cut\r\noff a quarter of a yard in any part of the bill he pleased; he wore a\r\npair of scissors in his pocket for this purpose, and would snip it off\r\nso nicely as you cannot imagine. Like a true goldsmith he kept all your\r\nholidays; there was not one wanting in his calendar; when ready money\r\nwas scarce, he would set them a-telling a thousand pounds in sixpences,\r\ngroats, and threepenny-pieces. It would have done your heart good to\r\nhave seen him charge through an army of lawyers, attorneys, clerks, and\r\ntradesmen; sometimes with sword in hand, at other times nuzzling like\r\nan eel in the mud. When a fellow stuck like a bur, that there was no\r\nshaking him off, he used to be mighty inquisitive about the health of\r\nhis uncles and aunts in the country; he could call them all by their\r\nnames, for he knew everybody, and could talk to them in their own way.\r\nThe extremely impertinent he would send away to see some strange sight,\r\nas the Dragon of Hockley the Hole, or bid him call the 30th of next\r\nFebruary. Now and then you would see him in the kitchen, weighing the\r\nbeef and butter, paying ready money, that the maids might not run a tick\r\nat the market, and the butchers, by bribing of them, sell damaged and\r\nlight meat.* Another time he would slip into the cellar and gauge the\r\ncasks. In his leisure minutes he was posting his books and gathering in\r\nhis debts. Such frugal methods were necessary where money was so scarce\r\nand duns so numerous. All this while John kept his credit, could show\r\nhis head both at 'Change and Westminster Hall; no man protested his bill\r\nnor refused his bond; only the sharpers and the scriveners, the lawyers\r\nand other clerks pelted Sir Roger as he went along. The squirters were\r\nat it with their kennel water, for they were mad for the loss of\r\ntheir bubble, and that they could not get him to mortgage the manor\r\nof Bullock's Hatch. Sir Roger shook his ears and nuzzled along, well\r\nsatisfied within himself that he was doing a charitable work in rescuing\r\nan honest man from the claws of harpies and bloodsuckers. Mrs. Bull did\r\nall that an affectionate wife, and a good housewife, could do; yet the\r\nboundaries of virtues are indivisible lines. It is impossible to march\r\nup close to the frontiers of frugality without entering the territories\r\nof parsimony. Your good housewives are apt to look into the minutest\r\nthings; therefore some blamed Mrs. Bull for new heel-pieceing of her\r\nshoes, grudging a quarter of a pound of soap and sand to scour the\r\nrooms**; but, especially, that she would not allow her maids and\r\napprentices the benefit of \"John Bunyan,\" the \"London Apprentices,\" or\r\nthe \"Seven Champions,\" in the black letter.***\r\n\r\n     * Some regulations as to the purveyance in the Queen's\r\n     family.\r\n\r\n     ** Too great savings in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n     *** Restraining the liberty of the Press by Act of\r\n     Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. A continuation of the conversation betwixt John Bull and\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--It is a most sad life we lead, my dear, to be so teazed,\r\npaying interest for old debts, and still contracting new ones. However,\r\nI don't blame you for vindicating your honour and chastising old Lewis.\r\nTo curb the insolent, protect the oppressed, recover one's own, and\r\ndefend what one has, are good effects of the law. The only thing I want\r\nto know is how you came to make an end of your money before you finished\r\nyour suit.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I was told by the learned in the law that my suit stood upon\r\nthree firm pillars: more money for more law, more law for more\r\nmoney, and no composition. More money for more law was plain to a\r\ndemonstration, for who can go to law without money? and it was plain\r\nthat any man that has money may have law for it. The third was as\r\nevident as the other two; for what composition could be made with a\r\nrogue that never kept a word he said?\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--I think you are most likely to get out of this labyrinth\r\nby the second door, by want of ready money to purchase this precious\r\ncommodity. But you seem not only to have bought too much of it, but have\r\npaid too dear for what you bought, else how was it possible to run\r\nso much in debt when at this very time the yearly income of what is\r\nmortgaged to those usurers would discharge Hocus's bills, and give you\r\nyour bellyfull of law for all your life, without running one sixpence\r\nin debt? You have been bred up to business; I suppose you can cypher; I\r\nwonder you never used your pen and ink.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Now you urge me too far; prithee, dear wife, hold thy\r\ntongue. Suppose a young heir, heedless, raw, and inexperienced, full\r\nof spirit and vigour, with a favourite passion, in the hands of money\r\nscriveners. Such fellows are like your wire-drawing mills: if they get\r\nhold of a man's finger they will pull in his whole body at last, till\r\nthey squeeze the heart, blood, and guts out of him. When I wanted money,\r\nhalf a dozen of these fellows were always waiting in my ante-chamber\r\nwith their securities ready drawn.* I was tempted with the ready, some\r\nfarm or other went to pot. I received with one hand, and paid it away\r\nwith the other to lawyers that, like so many hell hounds, were ready to\r\ndevour me. Then the rogues would plead poverty and scarcity of money,\r\nwhich always ended in receiving ninety for the hundred. After they had\r\ngot possession of my best rents they were able to supply me with my own\r\nmoney. But, what was worse, when I looked into the securities there was\r\nno clause of redemption.\r\n\r\n     * Methods of preying upon the necessities of the Government.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--No clause of redemption, say you? That's hard.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--No great matter. For I cannot pay them. They had got a\r\nworse trick than that. The same man bought and sold to himself, paid the\r\nmoney, and gave the acquittance; the same man was butcher and grazier,\r\nbrewer and butler, cook and poulterer. There is something still worse\r\nthan all this. There came twenty bills upon me at once, which I had\r\ngiven money to discharge. I was like to be pulled to pieces by brewer,\r\nbutcher, and baker; even my herb-woman dunned me as I went along the\r\nstreets. Thanks to my friend Sir Roger, else I must have gone to jail.\r\nWhen I asked the meaning of this, I was told the money went to the\r\nlawyers. \"Counsel won't tick, sir.\" Hocus was urging; my book-keeper\r\nsat sotting all day, playing at Put and All-fours. In short, by griping\r\nusurers, devouring lawyers, and negligent servants I am brought to this\r\npass.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--This was hard usage. But methinks the least reflection might\r\nhave retrieved you.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--'Tis true; yet consider my circumstances--my honour was\r\nengaged, and I did not know how to get out. Besides, I was for five\r\nyears often drunk, always muddled; they carried me from tavern to\r\ntavern, to ale-houses and brandy-shops, and brought me acquainted with\r\nsuch strange dogs. \"There goes the prettiest fellow in the world,\" says\r\none, \"for managing a jury: make him yours. There's another can pick you\r\nup witnesses. Serjeant such-a-one has a silver tongue at the bar.\"* I\r\nbelieve, in time I should have retained every single person within the\r\nInns of Court. The night after a trial I treated the lawyers, their\r\nwives, and daughters, with fiddles, hautboys, drums, and trumpets. I was\r\nalways hot-headed. Then they placed me in the middle, the attorneys and\r\ntheir clerks dancing about me, whooping and holloing, \"Long live John\r\nBull, the glory and support of the law!\"\r\n\r\n     * Hiring still more troops.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--Really, husband, you went through a very notable course.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--One of the things that first alarmed me was that they showed\r\na spite against my poor old mother.* \"Lord,\" quoth I, \"what makes you\r\nso jealous of a poor, old, innocent gentlewoman, that minds only her\r\nprayers and her Practice of Piety? She never meddles in any of your\r\nconcerns.\" \"Fob,\" say they, \"to see a handsome, brisk, genteel young\r\nfellow so much governed by a doting old woman! Do you consider she keeps\r\nyou out of a good jointure? She has the best of your estate settled upon\r\nher for a rent-charge. Hang her, old thief! turn her out of doors,\r\nseize her lands, and let her go to law if she dares.\" \"Soft and fair,\r\ngentlemen,\" quoth I; \"my mother's my mother, our family are not of an\r\nunnatural temper. Though I don't take all her advice, I won't seize her\r\njointure; long may she enjoy it, good woman; I don't grudge it her. She\r\nallows me now and then a brace of hundreds for my lawsuit; that's pretty\r\nfair.\" About this time the old gentlewoman fell ill of an odd sort of a\r\ndistemper.**\r\n\r\n     * Railing against the Church.\r\n\r\n     ** Carelessness in forms and discipline.\r\n\r\nIt began with a coldness and numbness in her limbs, which by degrees\r\naffected the nerves (I think the physicians call them), seized the\r\nbrain, and at last ended in a lethargy. It betrayed itself at first in\r\na sort of indifference and carelessness in all her actions, coldness to\r\nher best friends, and an aversion to stir or go about the common offices\r\nof life. She, that was the cleanliest creature in the world, never\r\nshrank now if you set a close-stool under her nose. She that would\r\nsometimes rattle off her servants pretty sharply, now if she saw them\r\ndrink, or heard them talk profanely, never took any notice of it.\r\nInstead of her usual charities to deserving persons, she threw away her\r\nmoney upon roaring, swearing bullies and beggars, that went about the\r\nstreets.* \"What is the matter with the old gentlewoman?\" said everybody;\r\n\"she never used to do in this manner.\" At last the distemper grew more\r\nviolent, and threw her downright into raving fits, in which she shrieked\r\nout so loud that she disturbed the whole neighbourhood.** In her fits\r\nshe called upon one Sir William.*** \"Oh! Sir William, thou hast betrayed\r\nme, killed me, stabbed me! See, see! Clum with his bloody knife! Seize\r\nhim! seize him! stop him! Behold the fury with her hissing snakes!\r\nWhere's my son John? Is he well, is he well? Poor man! I pity him!\" And\r\nabundance more of such strange stuff, that nobody could make anything\r\nof.\r\n\r\n     * Disposing of some preferments to libertine and\r\n     unprincipled persons.\r\n\r\n     ** The too violent clamour about the danger of the Church.\r\n\r\n     *** Sir William, a cant name of Sir Humphry's for Lord\r\n     Treasurer Godolphin.\r\n\r\nI knew little of the matter; for when I inquired about her health, the\r\nanswer was that she was in a good moderate way. Physicians were sent for\r\nin haste. Sir Roger, with great difficulty, brought Ratcliff; Garth came\r\nupon the first message. There were several others called in, but, as\r\nusual upon such occasions, they differed strangely at the consultation.\r\nAt last they divided into two parties; one sided with Garth, the other\r\nwith Ratcliff.* Dr. Garth said, \"This case seems to me to be plainly\r\nhysterical; the old woman is whimsical; it is a common thing for your\r\nold women to be so; I'll pawn my life, blisters, with the steel diet,\r\nwill recover her.\" Others suggested strong purging and letting of blood,\r\nbecause she was plethoric. Some went so far as to say the old woman\r\nwas mad, and nothing would be better than a little corporal correction.\r\nRatcliff said, \"Gentlemen, you are mistaken in this case; it is plainly\r\nan acute distemper, and she cannot hold out three days unless she is\r\nsupported with strong cordials.\" I came into the room with a good deal\r\nof concern, and asked them what they thought of my mother? \"In no manner\r\nof danger, I vow to God,\" quoth Garth; \"the old woman is hysterical,\r\nfanciful, sir, I vow to God.\" \"I tell you, sir,\" says Ratcliff, \"she\r\ncannot live three days to an end, unless there is some very effectual\r\ncourse taken with her; she has a malignant fever.\" Then \"fool,\" \"puppy,\"\r\nand \"blockhead,\" were the best words they gave. I could hardly restrain\r\nthem from throwing the ink-bottles at one another's heads. I forgot to\r\ntell you that one party of the physicians desired I would take my sister\r\nPeg into the house to nurse her, but the old gentlewoman would not hear\r\nof that. At last one physician asked if the lady had ever been used to\r\ntake laudanum? Her maid answered, not that she knew; but, indeed, there\r\nwas a High German liveryman of hers, one Van Ptschirnsooker,** that gave\r\nher a sort of a quack powder. The physician desired to see it. \"Nay,\"\r\nsays he, \"there is opium in this, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n     * Garth, the Low Church party.  Ratcliff, High Church party.\r\n\r\n     ** Van Ptschirnsooker, a bishop at that time, a great dealer\r\n     in politics and physic.\r\n\r\nMRS. BULL.--I hope you examined a little into this matter?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I did, indeed, and discovered a great mystery of iniquity.\r\nThe witnesses made oath that they had heard some of the liverymen*\r\nfrequently railing at their mistress. They said she was a troublesome\r\nfiddle-faddle old woman, and so ceremonious that there was no bearing of\r\nher. They were so plagued with bowing and cringing as they went in and\r\nout of the room that their backs ached. She used to scold at one for his\r\ndirty shoes, at another for his greasy hair and not combing his head.\r\nThen she was so passionate and fiery in her temper that there was no\r\nliving with her. She wanted something to sweeten her blood. That they\r\nnever had a quiet night's rest for getting up in the morning to early\r\nSacraments. They wished they could find some way or another to keep the\r\nold woman quiet in her bed. Such discourses were often overheard among\r\nthe liverymen, while the said Van Ptschirnsooker had undertook\r\nthis matter. A maid made affidavit \"That she had seen the said Van\r\nPtschirnsooker, one of the liverymen, frequently making up of medicines\r\nand administering them to all the neighbours; that she saw him one\r\nmorning make up the powder which her mistress took; that she had the\r\ncuriosity to ask him whence he had the ingredients. 'They come,' says\r\nhe, 'from several parts of de world. Dis I have from Geneva, dat from\r\nRome, this white powder from Amsterdam, and the red from Edinburgh, but\r\nthe chief ingredient of all comes from Turkey.\" It was likewise proved\r\nthat the said Van Ptschirnsooker had been frequently seen at the \"Rose\"\r\nwith Jack, who was known to bear an inveterate spite to his mistress.\r\nThat he brought a certain powder to his mistress which the examinant\r\nbelieves to be the same, and spoke the following words:--\"Madam, here\r\nis grand secret van de world, my sweetening powder; it does temperate\r\nde humour, dispel the windt, and cure de vapour; it lulleth and quieteth\r\nthe animal spirits, procuring rest and pleasant dreams. It is de\r\ninfallible receipt for de scurvy, all heats in de bloodt, and breaking\r\nout upon de skin. It is de true bloodstancher, stopping all fluxes of de\r\nblood. If you do take dis, you will never ail anyding; it will cure\r\nyou of all diseases.\" And abundance more to this purpose, which the\r\nexaminant does not remember.\r\n\r\n     * The clergy.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull was interrupted in his story by a porter, that brought him a\r\nletter from Nicholas Frog, which is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA Copy* of Nic. Frog's Letter to John Bull.\r\n\r\n[John Bull reads.]\r\n\r\nFRIEND JOHN,--What schellum is it that makes thee jealous of thy old\r\nfriend Nicholas? Hast thou forgot how some years ago he took thee out\r\nof the sponging-house?** ['Tis true, my friend Nic. did so, and I thank\r\nhim; but he made me pay a swinging reckoning.] Thou beginnest now to\r\nrepent thy bargain that thou wast so fond of; and, if thou durst, would\r\nforswear thy own hand and seal. Thou sayest that thou hast purchased me\r\ntoo great an estate already, when, at the same time, thou knowest I have\r\nonly a mortgage. 'Tis true I have possession, and the tenants own me for\r\nmaster; but has not Esquire South the equity of redemption? [No doubt,\r\nand will redeem it very speedily; poor Nic. has only possession--eleven\r\npoints of the law.] As for the turnpikes*** I have set up, they are\r\nfor other people, not for my friend John. I have ordered my servant\r\nconstantly to attend, to let thy carriages through without paying\r\nanything; only I hope thou wilt not come too heavy laden to spoil my\r\nways. Certainly I have just cause of offence against thee, my friend,\r\nfor supposing it possible that thou and I should ever quarrel. What\r\nhoundsfoot is it that puts these whims in thy head? Ten thousand last of\r\ndevils haul me, if I don't love thee as I love my life. [No question, as\r\nthe Devil loves holy-water!] Does not thy own hand and seal oblige thee\r\nto purchase for me till I say it is enough? Are not these words plain?\r\nI say it is not enough. Dost thou think thy friend Nicholas Frog made a\r\nchild's bargain? Mark the words of thy contract, tota pecunia (with\r\nall thy money). [Very well! I have purchased with my own money, my\r\nchildren's and my grandchildren's money--is not that enough? Well, tota\r\npecunia let it be, for at present I have none at all; he would not have\r\nme purchase with other people's money, sure? Since tota pecunia is the\r\nbargain, I think it is plain--no more money, no more purchase.]\r\nAnd whatever the world may say, Nicholas Frog is but a poor man in\r\ncomparison of the rich, the opulent John Bull, great clothier of the\r\nworld. I have had many losses, six of my best sheep were drowned, and\r\nthe water has come into my cellar, and spoiled a pipe of my best brandy.\r\nIt would be a more friendly act in thee to carry a brief about the\r\ncountry to repair the losses of thy poor friend. Is it not evident to\r\nall the world that I am still hemmed in by Lewis Baboon? Is he not just\r\nupon my borders? [And so he will be if I purchase a thousand acres more,\r\nunless he gets somebody betwixt them.] I tell thee, friend John, thou\r\nhast flatterers that persuade thee that thou art a man of business; do\r\nnot believe them. If thou wouldst still leave thy affairs in my hands,\r\nthou shouldst see how handsomely I would deal by thee. That ever thou\r\nshouldst be dazzled with the enchanted islands and mountains of gold\r\nthat old Lewis promises thee! 'Dswounds! why dost thou not lay out thy\r\nmoney to purchase a place at court of honest Israel? I tell thee, thou\r\nmust not so much as think of a composition. [Not think of a composition;\r\nthat's hard indeed; I can't help thinking of it, if I would.] Thou\r\ncomplainest of want of money--let thy wife and daughters burn the gold\r\nlace of their petticoats; sell thy fat cattle; retrench but a sirloin\r\nof beef and a peck-loaf in a week from thy gormandising. [Retrench my\r\nbeef--a dog! Retrench my beef; then it is plain the rascal has an ill\r\ndesign upon me--he would starve me.] Mortgage thy manor of Bullock's\r\nHatch, or pawn thy crop for ten years. [A rogue! part with my\r\ncountry-seat, my patrimony, all that I have left in the world; I'll\r\nsee him hanged first.] Why hast thou changed thy attorney? Can any man\r\nmanage thy cause better for thee? [Very pleasant! because a man has a\r\ngood attorney, he must never make an end of his law-suit.] Ah, John!\r\nJohn! I wish thou knewest thine own mind. Thou art as fickle as the\r\nwind. I tell thee, thou hadst better let this composition alone, or\r\nleave it to thy\r\n\r\nLoving friend,\r\n\r\nNic. FROG.\r\n\r\n     * A letter from the States-General.\r\n\r\n     ** Alluding to the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n     *** The Dutch prohibition of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. Of some extraordinary Things* that passed at the \"Salutation\"\r\nTavern, in the Conference between Bull, Frog, Esquire South, and Lewis\r\nBaboon.\r\n\r\n     * The Treaty of Utrecht:  the difficulty to get them to\r\n     meet.  When met, the Dutch would not speak their sentiments,\r\n     nor the French deliver in their proposals.  The House of\r\n     Austria talked very high.\r\n\r\nFrog had given his word that he would meet the above-mentioned company\r\nat the \"Salutation,\" to talk of this agreement. Though he durst not\r\ndirectly break his appointment, he made many a shuffling excuse: one\r\ntime he pretended to be seized with the gout in his right knee; then he\r\ngot a great cold, that had struck him deaf of one ear; afterwards two\r\nof his coach-horses fell sick, and he durst not go by water, for fear\r\nof catching an ague. John would take no excuse, but hurried him away.\r\n\"Come, Nic.,\" says he, \"let's go and hear at least what this old fellow\r\nhas to propose; I hope there's no hurt in that.\" \"Be it so,\" quoth Nic.;\r\n\"but if I catch any harm, woe be to you; my wife and children will curse\r\nyou as long as they live.\" When they were come to the \"Salutation,\" John\r\nconcluded all was sure then, and that he should be troubled no more with\r\nlaw affairs. He thought everybody as plain and sincere as he was. \"Well,\r\nneighbours,\" quoth he, \"let's now make an end of all matters, and\r\nlive peaceably together for the time to come. If everybody is as well\r\ninclined as I, we shall quickly come to the upshot of our affair.\" And\r\nso, pointing to Frog to say something, to the great surprise of all the\r\ncompany, Frog was seized with a dead palsy in the tongue. John began\r\nto ask him some plain questions, and whooped and hallooed in his ear:\r\n\"Let's come to the point. Nic., who wouldst thou have to be Lord Strutt?\r\nWouldst thou have Philip Baboon?\" Nic. shook his head, and said nothing.\r\n\"Wilt thou, then, have Esquire South to be Lord Strutt?\" Nic. shook his\r\nhead a second time. \"Then who the devil wilt thou have? Say something\r\nor another.\" Nic. opened his mouth and pointed to his tongue, and cried,\r\n\"A, a, a, a!\" which was as much as to say he could not speak.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"Shall I serve Philip Baboon with broadcloth, and accept\r\nof the composition that he offers, with the liberty of his parks and\r\nfishponds?\" Then Nic. roared like a bull, \"O, o, o, o!\"\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"If thou wilt not let me have them, wilt thou take them\r\nthyself?\" Then Nic. grinned, cackled, and laughed, till he was like to\r\nkill himself, and seemed to be so pleased that he fell a frisking and\r\ndancing about the room.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"Shall I leave all this matter to thy management, Nic.,\r\nand go about my business?\" Then Nic. got up a glass and drank to John,\r\nshaking him by the hand till he had like to have shook his shoulder out\r\nof joint.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"I understand thee, Nic.; but I shall make thee speak before\r\nI go.\" Then Nic. put his finger in his cheek and made it cry \"buck!\"\r\nwhich was as much as to say, \"I care not a farthing for thee.\"\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"I have done, Nic.; if thou wilt not speak, I'll make my own\r\nterms with old Lewis here.\"\r\n\r\nJohn, perceiving that Frog would not speak, turns to old Lewis: \"Since\r\nwe cannot make this obstinate fellow speak, Lewis, pray condescend a\r\nlittle to his humour, and set down thy meaning upon paper, that he may\r\nanswer it in another scrap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am infinitely sorry,\" quoth Lewis, \"that it happens so unfortunately;\r\nfor, playing a little at cudgels t'other day, a fellow has given me such\r\na rap over the right arm that I am quite lame. I have lost the use of my\r\nforefinger and my thumb, so that I cannot hold my pen.\"\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"That's all one; let me write for you.\"\r\n\r\nLEWIS.--\"But I have a misfortune that I cannot read anybody's hand but\r\nmy own.\"\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--\"Try what you can do with your left hand.\"\r\n\r\nLEWIS.--\"That's impossible; it will make such a scrawl that it will not\r\nbe legible.\"\r\n\r\nAs they were talking of this matter, in came Esquire South, all dressed\r\nup in feathers and ribbons, stark staring mad, brandishing his sword, as\r\nif he would have cut off their heads, crying \"Room, room, boys, for the\r\ngrand esquire of the world! the flower of esquires! What! covered in my\r\npresence? I'll crush your souls, and crack you like lice!\" With that he\r\nhad like to have struck John Bull's hat into the fire; but John, who was\r\npretty strong-fisted, gave him such a squeeze as made his eyes water.\r\nHe went on still in his mad pranks: \"When I am lord of the universe, the\r\nsun shall prostrate and adore me! Thou, Frog, shalt be my bailiff; Lewis\r\nmy tailor; and thou, John Bull, shalt be my fool!\"\r\n\r\nAll this while Frog laughed in his sleeve, gave the esquire the other\r\nnoggan of brandy, and clapped him on the back, which made him ten times\r\nmadder.\r\n\r\nPoor John stood in amaze, talking thus to himself: \"Well, John, thou art\r\ngot into rare company! One has a dumb devil, the other a mad devil, and\r\nthe third a spirit of infirmity. An honest man has a fine time on it\r\namongst such rogues. What art thou asking of them after all? Some mighty\r\nboon one would think! only to sit quietly at thy own fireside. What have\r\nI to do with such fellows? John Bull, after all his losses and crosses,\r\ncan live better without them than they can without him. Would I lived a\r\nthousand leagues off them! but the devil's in it; John Bull is in, and\r\nJohn Bull must get out as well as he can.\"\r\n\r\nAs he was talking to himself, he observed Frog and old Lewis edging\r\ntowards one another to whisper,* so that John was forced to sit with his\r\narms akimbo, to keep them asunder.\r\n\r\n     * Some attempts of secret negotiation between the French and\r\n     the Dutch.\r\n\r\nSome people advised John to bleed Frog under the tongue, or take away\r\nhis bread-and-butter, which would certainly make him speak; to\r\ngive Esquire South hellebore; as for Lewis, some were for emollient\r\npoultices, others for opening his arm with an incision knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.* The apprehending, examination, and imprisonment of Jack for\r\nsuspicion of poisoning.\r\n\r\n     * The four following chapters contain the history of passing\r\n     the Bill against Occasional Conformity, and of the Whigs\r\n     agreeing to it.\r\n\r\nThe attentive reader cannot have forgot that the story of Van\r\nPtschirnsooker's powder was interrupted by a message from Frog. I have a\r\nnatural compassion for curiosity, being much troubled with the distemper\r\nmyself; therefore to gratify that uneasy itching sensation in my reader,\r\nI have procured the following account of that matter.\r\n\r\nVan Ptschirnsooker came off (as rogues usually do upon such occasions)\r\nby peaching his partner; and being extremely forward to bring him to\r\nthe gallows, Jack* was accused as the contriver of all the roguery. And,\r\nindeed, it happened unfortunately for the poor fellow, that he was\r\nknown to bear a most inveterate spite against the old gentlewoman; and,\r\nconsequently, that never any ill accident happened to her but he was\r\nsuspected to be at the bottom of it. If she pricked her finger, Jack, to\r\nbe sure, laid the pin in the way; if some noise in the street disturbed\r\nher rest, who could it be but Jack in some of his nocturnal rambles?\r\nIf a servant ran away, Jack had debauched him. Every idle tittle-tattle\r\nthat went about, Jack was always suspected for the author of it.\r\nHowever, all was nothing to this last affair of the temperating,\r\nmoderating powder.\r\n\r\n     * All the misfortunes of the Church charged upon the Puritan\r\n     party.\r\n\r\nThe hue and cry went after Jack to apprehend him dead or alive, wherever\r\nhe could be found. The constables looked out for him in all his usual\r\nhaunts; but to no purpose. Where d'ye think they found him at last? Even\r\nsmoking his pipe, very quietly, at his brother Martin's; from whence\r\nhe was carried with a vast mob at his heels, before the worshipful Mr.\r\nJustice Overdo. Several of his neighbours made oath,* that of late, the\r\nprisoner had been observed to lead a very dissolute life, renouncing\r\neven his usual hypocrisy and pretences to sobriety; that he frequented\r\ntaverns and eating-houses, and had been often guilty of drunkenness and\r\ngluttony at my Lord Mayor's table; that he had been seen in the company\r\nof lewd women; that he had transferred his usual care of the engrossed\r\ncopy of his father's will to bank bills, orders for tallies, and\r\ndebentures:** these he now affirmed, with more literal truth, to be\r\nmeat, drink, and cloth, the philosopher's stone, and the universal\r\nmedicine;*** that he was so far from showing his customary reverence\r\nto the will, that he kept company with those that called his father a\r\ncheating rogue, and his will a forgery; that he not only sat quietly and\r\nheard his father railed at, but often chimed in with the discourse, and\r\nhugged the authors as his bosom friends;**** that instead of asking for\r\nblows at the corners of the streets, he now bestowed them as plentifully\r\nas he begged them before.*** In short, that he was grown a mere rake;\r\nand had nothing left in him of old Jack except his spite to John Bull's\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n     * The manners of the Dissenters changed from their former\r\n     strictness.\r\n\r\n     ** Dealing much in stock-jobbing.\r\n\r\n     *** \"Tale of a Tub.\"\r\n\r\n     **** Herding with deists and atheists.\r\n\r\nAnother witness made oath, that Jack had been overheard bragging of a\r\ntrick* he had found out to manage the \"old formal jade,\" as he used to\r\ncall her. \"Hang this numb-skull of mine,\" quoth he, \"that I could not\r\nlight on it sooner. As long as I go in this ragged tattered coat, I am\r\nso well known, that I am hunted away from the old woman's door by every\r\nbarking cur about the house; they bid me defiance. There's no doing\r\nmischief as an open enemy; I must find some way or other of getting\r\nwithin doors, and then I shall have better opportunities of playing my\r\npranks, besides the benefit of good keeping.\"\r\n\r\n     * Getting into places and Church preferments by occasional\r\n     conformity.\r\n\r\nTwo witnesses swore* that several years ago, there came to their\r\nmistress's door a young fellow in a tattered coat, that went by the name\r\nof Timothy Trim, whom they did in their conscience believe to be the\r\nvery prisoner, resembling him in shape, stature, and the features of\r\nhis countenance. That the said Timothy Trim being taken into the family,\r\nclapped their mistress's livery over his own tattered coat; that the\r\nsaid Timothy was extremely officious about their mistress's person,\r\nendeavouring by flattery and tale-bearing to set her against the rest of\r\nthe servants: nobody was so ready to fetch anything that was wanted,\r\nto reach what was dropped. That he used to shove and elbow his\r\nfellow-servants to get near his mistress, especially when money was\r\na paying or receiving--then he was never out of the way; that he was\r\nextremely diligent about everybody's business but his own. That the said\r\nTimothy, while he was in the family, used to be playing roguish tricks;\r\nwhen his mistress's back was turned, he would loll out his tongue, make\r\nmouths, and laugh at her, walking behind her like Harlequin, ridiculing\r\nher motions and gestures; but if his mistress looked about, he put on a\r\ngrave, demure countenance, as if he had been in a fit of devotion; that\r\nhe used often to trip up-stairs so smoothly that you could not hear him\r\ntread, and put all things out of order; that he would pinch the children\r\nand servants, when he met them in the dark, so hard, that he left the\r\nprint of his forefingers and his thumb in black and blue, and then\r\nslink into a corner, as if nobody had done it. Out of the same malicious\r\ndesign he used to lay chairs and joint-stools in their way, that\r\nthey might break their noses by falling over them. The more young and\r\ninexperienced he used to teach to talk saucily, and call names. During\r\nhis stay in the family there was much plate missing; being caught with a\r\ncouple of silver spoons in his pocket, with their handles wrenched off,\r\nhe said he was only going to carry them to the goldsmiths to be mended:\r\nthat the said Timothy was hated by all the honest servants, for his\r\nill-conditioned, splenetic tricks, but especially for his slanderous\r\ntongue; traducing them to their mistress as drunkards and thieves: that\r\nthe said Timothy, by lying stories, used to set all the family\r\ntogether by the ears, taking delight to make them fight and quarrel;\r\n**particularly one day sitting at table, he spoke words to this effect:\r\n\"I am of opinion,\" quoth he, \"that little short fellows, such as we are,\r\nhave better hearts, and could beat the tall fellows; I wish it came to a\r\nfair trial; I believe these long fellows, as sightly as they are, should\r\nfind their jackets well thwacked.\"\r\n\r\n     * Betraying the interests of the Church when got into\r\n     preferments.\r\n\r\n     ** The original of the distinction in the names of Low\r\n     Churchmen and High Churchmen.\r\n\r\nA parcel of tall fellows, who thought themselves affronted by the\r\ndiscourse, took up the quarrel, and to it they went, the tall men and\r\nthe low men, which continues still a faction in the family, to the great\r\ndisorder of our mistress's affairs. The said Timothy carried this frolic\r\nso far, that he proposed to his mistress that she should entertain no\r\nservant that was above four feet seven inches high, and for that purpose\r\nhad prepared a gauge, by which they were to be measured. The good old\r\ngentlewoman was not so simple as to go into his projects--she began\r\nto smell a rat. \"This Trim,\" quoth she, \"is an odd sort of a fellow;\r\nmethinks he makes a strange figure with that ragged, tattered coat\r\nappearing under his livery; can't he go spruce and clean, like the rest\r\nof the servants? The fellow has a roguish leer with him which I don't\r\nlike by any means; besides, he has such a twang in his discourse, and\r\nan ungraceful way of speaking through the nose, that one can hardly\r\nunderstand him; I wish the fellow be not tainted with some bad disease.\"\r\nThe witnesses further made oath, that the said Timothy lay out a-nights,\r\nand went abroad often at unseasonable hours; and it was credibly\r\nreported he did business in another family: that he pretended to have\r\na squeamish stomach, and could not eat at table with the rest of the\r\nservants, though this was but a pretence to provide some nice bit\r\nfor himself; that he refused to dine upon salt fish, only to have an\r\nopportunity to eat a calf's head (his favourite dish) in private; that\r\nfor all his tender stomach, when he was got by himself, he could devour\r\ncapons, turkeys, and sirloins of beef, like a cormorant.\r\n\r\nTwo other witnesses gave the following evidence: That in his officious\r\nattendance upon his mistress, he had tried to slip a powder into her\r\ndrink, and that he was once caught endeavouring to stifle her with a\r\npillow as she was asleep; that he and Ptschirnsooker were often in close\r\nconference, and that they used to drink together at the \"Rose,\" where it\r\nseems he was well enough known by his true name of Jack.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner had little to say in his defence; he endeavoured to prove\r\nhimself alibi, so that the trial turned upon this single question,\r\nwhether the said Timothy Trim and Jack were the same person; which was\r\nproved by such plain tokens, and particularly by a mole under the\r\nleft pap, that there was no withstanding the evidence; therefore the\r\nworshipful Mr. Justice committed him, in order to his trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. How Jack's friends came to visit him in prison, and what\r\nadvice they gave him.\r\n\r\nJack hitherto had passed in the world for a poor, simple, well-meaning,\r\nhalf-witted, crack-brained fellow. People were strangely surprised to\r\nfind him in such a roguery--that he should disguise himself under a\r\nfalse name, hire himself out for a servant to an old gentlewoman, only\r\nfor an opportunity to poison her. They said that it was more generous to\r\nprofess open enmity than under a profound dissimulation to be guilty\r\nof such a scandalous breach of trust, and of the sacred rights of\r\nhospitality; in short, the action was universally condemned by his best\r\nfriends. They told him in plain terms that this was come as a judgment\r\nupon him for his loose life, his gluttony, drunkenness, and avarice;\r\nfor laying aside his father's will in an old mouldy trunk, and turning\r\nstock-jobber, newsmonger, and busybody, meddling with other people's\r\naffairs, shaking off his old serious friends, and keeping company with\r\nbuffoons and pickpockets, his father's sworn enemies; that he had\r\nbest throw himself upon the mercy of the court, repent, and change\r\nhis manners. To say truth, Jack heard these discourses with some\r\ncompunction; however, he resolved to try what his new acquaintance\r\nwould do for him. They sent Habakkuk Slyboots,* who delivered him\r\nthe following message, as the peremptory commands of his trusty\r\ncompanions:--\r\n\r\n     * Habakkuk Slyboots, a certain great man who persuaded the\r\n     Dissenters to consent to the Bill against Occasional\r\n     Conformity as being for their interest.\r\n\r\nHABAKKUK.--Dear Jack, I am sorry for thy misfortune: matters have not\r\nbeen carried on with due secrecy; however, we must make the best of\r\na bad bargain. Thou art in the utmost jeopardy, that's certain; hang,\r\ndraw, and quarter, are the gentlest things they talk of. However, thy\r\nfaithful friends, ever watchful for thy security, bid me tell thee that\r\nthey have one infallible expedient left to save thy life. Thou must know\r\nwe have got into some understanding with the enemy by the means of Don\r\nDiego;* he assures us there is no mercy for thee, and that there is only\r\none way left to escape. It is, indeed, somewhat out of the common road;\r\nhowever, be assured it is the result of most mature deliberation.\r\n\r\n     * A noble Tory lord.\r\n\r\nJACK.--Prithee tell me quickly, for my heart is sunk down in the very\r\nbottom of my belly.\r\n\r\nHAB.--It is the unanimous opinion of your friends that you make as if\r\nyou hanged yourself;* they will give it out that you are quite dead, and\r\nconvey your body out of prison in a bier; and John Bull, being busied\r\nwith his lawsuit, will not inquire further into the matter.\r\n\r\n     * Consent to the Bill against Occasional Conformity.\r\n\r\nJACK.--How d'ye mean, make as if I hanged myself?\r\n\r\nHAB.--Nay, you must really hang yourself up in a true genuine rope, that\r\nthere may appear no trick in it, and leave the rest to your friends.\r\n\r\nJACK.--Truly this is a matter of some concern, and my friends, I hope,\r\nwon't take it ill if I inquire a little into the means by which they\r\nintend to deliver me. A rope and a noose are no jesting matters!\r\n\r\nHAB.--Why so mistrustful? hast thou ever found us false to thee? I tell\r\nthee there is one ready to cut thee down.\r\n\r\nJACK.--May I presume to ask who it is that is entrusted with so\r\nimportant an office?\r\n\r\nHAB.--Is there no end of thy hows and thy whys? That's a secret.\r\n\r\nJACK.--A secret, perhaps, that I may be safely trusted with, for I am\r\nnot like to tell it again. I tell you plainly it is no strange thing for\r\na man before he hangs himself up to inquire who is to cut him down.\r\n\r\nHAB.--Thou suspicious creature! if thou must needs know it, I tell thee\r\nit is Sir Roger;* he has been in tears ever since thy misfortune. Don\r\nDiego and we have laid it so that he is to be in the next room, and\r\nbefore the rope is well about thy neck, rest satisfied he will break in\r\nand cut thee down. Fear not, old boy; we'll do it, I'll warrant thee.\r\n\r\n     * It was given out that the Earl of Oxford would oppose the\r\n     occasional Bill, and so lose his credit with the Tories; and\r\n     the Dissenters did believe he would not suffer it to pass.\r\n\r\nJACK.--So I must hang myself up upon hopes that Sir Roger will cut\r\nme down, and all this upon the credit of Don Diego. A fine stratagem,\r\nindeed, to save my life, that depends upon hanging, Don Diego, and Sir\r\nRoger!\r\n\r\nHAB.--I tell thee there is a mystery in all this, my friend, a piece\r\nof profound policy; if thou knew what good this will do to the common\r\ncause, thy heart would leap for joy. I am sure thou wouldst not delay\r\nthe experiment one moment.\r\n\r\nJACK.--This is to the tune of \"All for the better.\" What's your cause to\r\nme when I am hanged?\r\n\r\nHAB.--Refractory mortal! if thou wilt not trust thy friends, take what\r\nfollows. Know assuredly, before next full moon, that thou wilt be hung\r\nup in chains, or thy quarters perching upon the most conspicuous\r\nplaces of the kingdom. Nay, I don't believe they will be contented\r\nwith hanging; they talk of impaling, or breaking on the wheel, and thou\r\nchoosest that before a gentle suspending of thyself for one minute.\r\nHanging is not so painful a thing as thou imaginest. I have spoken\r\nwith several that have undergone it; they all agree it is no manner of\r\nuneasiness. Be sure thou take good notice of the symptoms; the relation\r\nwill be curious. It is but a kick or two with thy heels, and a wry mouth\r\nor so: Sir Roger will be with thee in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nJACK.--But what if Sir Roger should not come; will my friends be there\r\nto succour me?\r\n\r\nHAB.--Doubt it not; I will provide everything against to-morrow morning:\r\ndo thou keep thy own secret--say nothing. I tell thee it is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the common good that thou shouldst go through this\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. How Jack hanged himself up by the persuasion of his\r\nfriends, who broke their words, and left his neck in the noose.\r\n\r\nJack was a professed enemy to implicit faith, and yet I dare say it\r\nwas never more strongly exerted nor more basely abused than upon this\r\noccasion. He was now, with his old friends, in the state of a poor\r\ndisbanded officer after a peace, or rather a wounded soldier after a\r\nbattle; like an old favourite of a cunning Minister after the job is\r\nover, or a decayed beauty to a cloyed lover in quest of new game, or\r\nlike a hundred such things that one sees every day. There were new\r\nintrigues, new views, new projects, on foot. Jack's life was the\r\npurchase of Diego's friendship; much good may it do them. The interest\r\nof Hocus and Sir William Crawley which was now more at heart, made this\r\noperation upon poor Jack absolutely necessary. You may easily guess\r\nthat his rest that night was but small, and much disturbed; however,\r\nthe remaining part of his time he did not employ (as his custom was\r\nformerly) in prayer, meditation, or singing a double verse of a Psalm,\r\nbut amused himself with disposing of his bank stock. Many a doubt, many\r\na qualm, overspread his clouded imagination: \"Must I then,\" quoth he,\r\n\"hang up my own personal, natural, individual self with these two hands!\r\nDurus Sermo! What if I should be cut down, as my friends tell me? There\r\nis something infamous in the very attempt; the world will conclude I had\r\na guilty conscience. Is it possible that good man, Sir Roger, can have\r\nso much pity upon an unfortunate scoundrel that has persecuted him so\r\nmany years? No, it cannot be; I don't love favours that pass through Don\r\nDiego's hands. On the other side, my blood chills about my heart at\r\nthe thought of these rogues with their bloody hands pulling out my very\r\nentrails. Hang it, for once I'll trust my friends.\" So Jack resolved;\r\nbut he had done more wisely to have put himself upon the trial of his\r\ncountry, and made his defence in form; many things happen between the\r\ncup and the lip--witnesses might have been bribed, juries managed, or\r\nprosecution stopped. But so it was, Jack for this time had a sufficient\r\nstock of implicit faith, which led him to his ruin, as the sequel of the\r\nstory shows.\r\n\r\nAnd now the fatal day was come in which he was to try this hanging\r\nexperiment. His friends did not fail him at the appointed hour to see it\r\nput in practice. Habakkuk brought him a smooth, strong, tough rope,\r\nmade of many a ply of wholesome Scandinavian hemp, compactly twisted\r\ntogether, with a noose that slipped as glib as a birdcatcher's gin. Jack\r\nshrank and grew pale at first sight of it; he handled it, he measured\r\nit, stretched it, fixed it against the iron bar of the window to try its\r\nstrength, but no familiarity could reconcile him to it. He found fault\r\nwith the length, the thickness, and the twist; nay, the very colour\r\ndid not please him. \"Will nothing less than hanging serve?\" quoth Jack.\r\n\"Won't my enemies take bail for my good behaviour? Will they accept of\r\na fine, or be satisfied with the pillory and imprisonment, a good round\r\nwhipping, or burning in the cheek?\"\r\n\r\nHAB.--Nothing but your blood will appease their rage; make haste, else\r\nwe shall be discovered. There's nothing like surprising the rogues. How\r\nthey will be disappointed when they hear that thou hast prevented their\r\nrevenge and hanged thine own self.\r\n\r\nJACK.--That's true; but what if I should do it in effigies? Is there\r\nnever an old pope or pretender to hang up in my stead? We are not so\r\nunlike but it may pass.\r\n\r\nHAB.--That can never be put upon Sir Roger.\r\n\r\nJACK.--Are you sure he is in the next room? Have you provided a very\r\nsharp knife, in case of the worst?\r\n\r\nHAB.--Dost take me for a common liar? Be satisfied, no damage can happen\r\nto your person; your friends will take care of that.\r\n\r\nJACK.--Mayn't I quilt my rope? It galls my neck strangely: besides, I\r\ndon't like this running knot. It holds too tight; I may be stifled all\r\nof a sudden.\r\n\r\nHAB.--Thou hast so many ifs and ands! prithee despatch; it might have\r\nbeen over before this time.\r\n\r\nJACK.--But now I think on't, I would fain settle some affairs, for fear\r\nof the worst: have a little patience.\r\n\r\nHAB.--There's no having patience, thou art such a faintling, silly\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nJACK.--O thou most detestable, abominable Passive Obedience! did I ever\r\nimagine I should become thy votary, in so pregnant an instance? How will\r\nmy brother Martin laugh at this story, to see himself outdone in his own\r\ncalling! He has taken the doctrine, and left me the practice.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he uttered these words, but, like a man of true courage,\r\nhe tied the fatal cord to the beam, fitted the noose, and mounted upon\r\nthe bottom of a tub, the inside of which he had often graced in his\r\nprosperous days. This footstool Habakkuk kicked away, and left poor Jack\r\nswinging like the pendulum of Paul's clock. The fatal noose performed\r\nits office, and with most strict ligature squeezed the blood into his\r\nface till it assumed a purple dye. While the poor man heaved from\r\nthe very bottom of his belly for breath, Habakkuk walked with great\r\ndeliberation into both the upper and lower room, to acquaint his\r\nfriends, who received the news with great temper, and with jeers and\r\nscoffs instead of pity. \"Jack has hanged himself!\" quoth they; \"let us\r\ngo and see how the poor rogue swings.\" Then they called Sir Roger. \"Sir\r\nRoger,\" quoth Habakkuk, \"Jack has hanged himself; make haste and cut\r\nhim down.\" Sir Roger turned first one ear and then the other, not\r\nunderstanding what he said.\r\n\r\nHAB.--I tell you Jack has hanged himself up.\r\n\r\nSIR ROGER.--Who's hanged?\r\n\r\nHAB.--Jack.\r\n\r\nSIR ROGER.--I thought this had not been hanging day.\r\n\r\nHAB.--But the poor fellow has hanged himself.\r\n\r\nSIR ROGER.--Then let him hang. I don't wonder at it; the fellow has been\r\nmad these twenty years.\r\n\r\nWith this he slunk away.\r\n\r\nThen Jack's friends began to hunch and push one another: \"Why don't you\r\ngo and cut the poor fellow down?\" \"Why don't you?\" \"And why don't you?\"\r\n\"Not I,\" quoth one. \"Not I,\" quoth another. \"Not I,\" quoth a third;\r\n\"he may hang till doomsday before I relieve him!\" Nay, it is credibly\r\nreported that they were so far from succouring their poor friend in\r\nthis his dismal circumstance, that Ptschirnsooker and several of his\r\ncompanions went in and pulled him by the legs, and thumped him on the\r\nbreast. Then they began to rail at him for the very thing which they\r\nhad advised and justified before, viz., his getting into the old\r\ngentlewoman's family, and putting on her livery. The keeper who\r\nperformed the last office coming up, found Jack swinging, with no life\r\nin him. He took down the body gently and laid it on a bulk, and brought\r\nout the rope to the company. \"This, gentlemen, is the rope that hanged\r\nJack; what must be done with it?\" Upon which they ordered it to be laid\r\namong the curiosities of Gresham College; and it is called Jack's rope\r\nto this very day. However, Jack, after all, had some small tokens of\r\nlife in him, but lies, at this time, past hopes of a total recovery,\r\nwith his head hanging on one shoulder, without speech or motion. The\r\ncoroner's inquest, supposing him to be dead, brought him in non compos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. The Conference between Don Diego and John Bull.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the foregoing transactions, Don Diego was\r\nentertaining John Bull.\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO.--I hope, sir, this day's proceeding will convince you of the\r\nsincerity of your old friend Diego, and the treachery of Sir Roger.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--What's the matter now?\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO.--You have been endeavouring, for several years, to have\r\njustice done upon that rogue Jack, but, what through the remissness of\r\nconstables, justices, and packed juries, he has always found the means\r\nto escape.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--What then?\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO.--Consider, then, who is your best friend: he that would\r\nhave brought him to condign punishment, or he that has saved him? By my\r\npersuasion Jack had hanged himself, if Sir Roger had not cut him down.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Who told you that Sir Roger has done so?\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO.--You seem to receive me coldly: methinks my services deserve\r\na better return.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Since you value yourself upon hanging this poor scoundrel, I\r\ntell you, when I have any more hanging work, I'll send for thee: I have\r\nsome better employment for Sir Roger. In the meantime, I desire the poor\r\nfellow may be looked after. When he first came out of the north country\r\ninto my family, under the pretended name of Timothy Trim, the fellow\r\nseemed to mind his loom and his spinning-wheel, till somebody turned his\r\nhead; then he grew so pragmatical, that he took upon him the government\r\nof my whole family: I could never order anything, within or without\r\ndoors, but he must be always giving his counsel, forsooth: nevertheless,\r\ntell him I will forgive what is past; and if he would mind his business\r\nfor the future, and not meddle out of his own sphere, he will find that\r\nJohn Bull is not of a cruel disposition.\r\n\r\nDON DIEGO.--Yet all your skilful physicians say that nothing can recover\r\nyour mother but a piece of Jack's liver boiled in her soup.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Those are quacks. My mother abhors such cannibals' food. She\r\nis in perfect health at present. I would have given many a good pound\r\nto have had her so well some time ago.* There are indeed two or three\r\ntroublesome old nurses that, because they believe I am tender-hearted,\r\nwill never let me have a quiet night's rest with knocking me up: \"Oh,\r\nsir, your mother is taken extremely ill; she is fallen into a fainting\r\nfit; she has a great emptiness, wants sustenance.\" This is only to\r\nrecommend themselves for their great care. John Bull, as simple as he\r\nis, understands a little of a pulse.\r\n\r\n     * New clamours about the danger of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. The sequel of the meeting at the \"Salutation.\"*\r\n\r\n     * At the Congress of Utrecht.\r\n\r\nWhere I think I left John Bull, sitting between Nic. Frog and Lewis\r\nBaboon, with his arms akimbo, in great concern to keep Lewis and Nic.\r\nasunder. As watchful as he was, Nic. found the means now and then to\r\nsteal a whisper, and by a cleanly conveyance under the table to slip\r\na short note into Lewis's hand, which Lewis as slyly put into John's\r\npocket, with a pinch or a jog to warn him what he was about. John had\r\nthe curiosity to retire into a corner to peruse those billets doux* of\r\nNic.'s, wherein he found that Nic. had used great freedoms both with his\r\ninterest and reputation. One contained these words: \"Dear Lewis, thou\r\nseest clearly that this blockhead can never bring his matters to bear.\r\nLet thee and me talk to-night by ourselves at the 'Rose,' and I'll give\r\nthee satisfaction.\" Another was thus expressed: \"Friend Lewis, has thy\r\nsense quite forsaken thee to make Bull such offers? Hold fast, part with\r\nnothing, and I will give thee a better bargain, I'll warrant thee!\"\r\n\r\n     * Some offers of the Dutch at that time, in order to get the\r\n     negotiation into their hands.\r\n\r\nIn some of his billets he told Lewis \"That John Bull was under his\r\nguardianship; that the best part of his servants were at his command;\r\nthat he could have John gagged and bound whenever he pleased by the\r\npeople of his own family.\" In all these epistles, blockhead, dunce,\r\nass, coxcomb, were the best epithets he gave poor John. In others he\r\nthreatened,* \"That he, Esquire South, and the rest of the tradesmen,\r\nwould lay Lewis down upon his back and beat out his teeth if he did not\r\nretire immediately and break up the Meeting.\"\r\n\r\n     * Threatening that the allies would carry on the war without\r\n     the help of the English.\r\n\r\nI fancy I need not tell my reader that John often changed colour as he\r\nread, and that his fingers itched to give Nic. a good slap on the chops,\r\nbut he wisely moderated his choleric temper. *\"I saved this fellow,\"\r\nquoth he, \"from the gallows when he ran away from his last master,\r\nbecause I thought he was harshly treated; but the rogue was no sooner\r\nsafe under my protection than he began to lie, pilfer, and steal like\r\nthe devil. When I first set him up in a warm house he had hardly put up\r\nhis sign when he began to debauch my best customers from me. *Then it\r\nwas his constant practice to rob my fish-ponds, not only to feed his\r\nfamily, but to trade with the fishmongers. I connived at the fellow till\r\nhe began to tell me that they were his as much as mine. In my manor of\r\n*Eastcheap, because it lay at some distance from my constant inspection,\r\nhe broke down my fences, robbed my orchards, and beat my servants.\"\r\n\r\n     * Complaints against the Dutch for encroachment in trade,\r\n     fishery, East Indies, etc.  The war with the Dutch on these\r\n     accounts.\r\n\r\n\"When I used to reprimand him for his tricks he would talk saucily, lie,\r\nand brazen it out as if he had done nothing amiss. 'Will nothing cure\r\nthee of thy pranks, Nic.?' quoth I; 'I shall be forced some time or\r\nother to chastise thee.' The rogue got up his cane and threatened me,\r\nand was well thwacked for his pains. But I think his behaviour at this\r\ntime worst of all; after I have almost drowned myself to keep his head\r\nabove water, he would leave me sticking in the mud, trusting to\r\nhis goodness to help me out. After I have beggared myself with his\r\ntroublesome lawsuit, with a plague to him! he takes it in mighty dudgeon\r\nbecause I have brought him here to end matters amicably, and because I\r\nwon't let him make me over by deed and indenture as his lawful cully,\r\nwhich to my certain knowledge he has attempted several times. But, after\r\nall, canst thou gather grapes from thorns? Nic. does not pretend to be a\r\ngentleman; he is a tradesman, a self-seeking wretch. But how camest\r\nthou to hear all this, John? The reason is plain; thou conferrest the\r\nbenefits and he receives them; the first produces love, and the last\r\ningratitude. Ah Nic., Nic., thou art a damned dog, that's certain; thou\r\nknowest too well that I will take care of thee, else thou wouldst not\r\nuse me thus. I won't give thee up, it is true; but as true as it is,\r\nthou shalt not sell me, according to thy laudable custom.\" While\r\nJohn was deep in this soliloquy Nic. broke out into the following\r\nprotestation:--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,--I believe everybody here present will allow me to be a very\r\njust and disinterested person. My friend John Bull here is very angry\r\nwith me, forsooth, because I won't agree to his foolish bargains. Now I\r\ndeclare to all mankind I should be ready to sacrifice my own concerns\r\nto his quiet, but the care of his interest, and that of the honest\r\ntradesmen* that are embarked with us, keeps me from entering into this\r\ncomposition. What shall become of those poor creatures? The thoughts of\r\ntheir impending ruin disturb my night's rest; therefore I desire they\r\nmay speak for themselves. If they are willing to give up this affair, I\r\nsha'n't make two words of it.\"\r\n\r\n     * The Allies.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull begged him to lay aside that immoderate concern for him, and\r\nwithal put him in mind that the interest of those tradesmen had not sat\r\nquite so heavy upon him some years ago on a like occasion. Nic. answered\r\nlittle to that, but immediately pulled out a boatswain's whistle. Upon\r\nthe first whiff the tradesmen came jumping into the room, and began to\r\nsurround Lewis like so many yelping curs about a great boar; or, to use\r\na modester simile, like duns at a great lord's levee the morning he goes\r\ninto the country. One pulled him by his sleeve, another by the skirt, a\r\nthird hallooed in the ear. They began to ask him for all that had\r\nbeen taken from their forefathers by stealth, fraud, force, or lawful\r\npurchase. Some asked for manors, others for acres that lay convenient\r\nfor them; that he would pull down his fences, level his ditches. All\r\nagreed in one common demand that he should be purged, sweated,\r\nvomited, and starved, till he came to a sizeable bulk like that of his\r\nneighbours. One modestly asked him leave to call him brother. Nic. Frog\r\ndemanded two things--to be his porter and his fishmonger, to keep\r\nthe keys of his gates and furnish the kitchen. John's sister Peg only\r\ndesired that he would let his servants sing psalms a-Sundays. Some\r\ndescended even to the asking of old clothes, shoes and boots, broken\r\nbottles, tobacco-pipes, and ends of candles.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Bull,\" quoth Lewis, \"you seem to be a man of some breeding;\r\nfor God's sake use your interest with these Messieurs, that they would\r\nspeak but one at once; for if one had a hundred pair of hands, and as\r\nmany tongues, he cannot satisfy them all at this rate.\" John begged they\r\nmight proceed with some method; then they stopped all of a sudden and\r\nwould not say a word. \"If this be your play,\" quoth John, \"that we may\r\nnot be like a Quaker's dumb meeting, let us begin some diversion; what\r\nd'ye think of rouly-pouly or a country dance? What if we should have a\r\nmatch at football? I am sure we shall never end matters at this rate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. How John Bull and Nic. Frog settled their Accounts.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--During this general cessation of talk, what if you and I,\r\nNic., should inquire how money matters stand between us?\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--With all my heart; I love exact dealing. And let Hocus\r\naudit; he knows how the money was disbursed.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I am not much for that at present; we'll settle it between\r\nourselves. Fair and square, Nic., keeps friends together. There have\r\nbeen laid out in this lawsuit, at one time, 36,000 pounds and 40,000\r\ncrowns. In some cases I, in others you, bear the greatest proportion.\r\n\r\nNIC FROG.--Right; I pay three-fifths of the greatest number, and you pay\r\ntwo-thirds of the lesser number. I think this is fair and square, as you\r\ncall it.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Well, go on.\r\n\r\nNIC FROG.--Two-thirds of 36,000 pounds are 24,000 pounds for your share,\r\nand there remains 12,000 for mine. Again, of the 40,000 crowns I\r\npay 24,000, which is three-fifths, and you pay only 16,000, which is\r\ntwo-fifths; 24,000 crowns make 6,000 pounds, and 16,000 crowns make\r\n4,000 pounds; 12,000 and 16,000 make 18,000, 24,000 and 4,000 make\r\n28,000. So there are 18,000 pounds to my share of the expenses, and\r\n28,000 to yours.\r\n\r\nAfter Nic. had bamboozled John awhile about the 18,000 and the 28,000,\r\nJohn called for counters; but what with sleight of hand, and taking from\r\nhis own score and adding to John's, Nic. brought the balance always on\r\nhis own side.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Nay, good friend Nic., though I am not quite so nimble in\r\nthe fingers, I understand ciphering as well as you. I will produce you\r\nmy accounts one by one, fairly writ out of my own books; and here I\r\nbegin with the first. You must excuse me if I don't pronounce the law\r\nterms right.\r\n\r\n[John reads.]\r\n\r\nFor the expenses ordinary of the suits, fees to judges, puisne judges,\r\nlawyers innumerable of all sorts:--\r\n\r\n   Of extraordinaries, as follows per account..\r\n   To Esquire South's account for post terminums..\r\n   To ditto for non est factums..\r\n   To ditto for noli prosequis, discontinuance, and retraxit..\r\n   For writs of error..\r\n   Suits of conditions unperformed..\r\n   To Hocus for dedimus protestatem..\r\n   To ditto for a capias ad computandum..\r\n   To Frog's new tenants per account to Hocus, for audita querelas..\r\n   On the said account for writs of ejectment and distringas..\r\n   To Esquire South's quota for a return of a non est invent\r\n      and nulla habet bona..\r\n   To ---- for a pardon in forma pauperis..\r\n   To Jack for a melius inquirendum upon a felo-de-se..\r\n   To coach-hire..\r\n   For treats to juries and witnesses..\r\n\r\nJohn having read over his articles, with the respective sums, brought in\r\nFrog debtor to him upon the balance, 3,382 pounds 12 shillings.\r\n\r\nThen Nic. Frog pulled his bill out of his pocket, and began to read.\r\n\r\nNicholas Frog's Account.\r\n\r\nRemains to be deducted out of the former Account.\r\n\r\n   Paid by Nic. Frog for his share of the ordinary expenses of the suit\r\n  ..\r\n   To Hocus for entries of a rege inconsulto..\r\n   To John Bull's nephew for a venire facias, the money not yet all\r\n   laid out..\r\n   The coach-hire for my wife and family, and the carriage of my goods\r\n   during the\r\n      time of this lawsuit..\r\n   For the extraordinary expenses of feeding my family during this\r\n   lawsuit..\r\n   To Major Ab...\r\n   To Major Will...\r\n\r\nAnd summing all up, found due upon the balance by John Bull to Nic.\r\nFrog, 9 pounds 4 shillings and 6 pence.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--As for your venire facias, I have paid you for one already;\r\nin the other I believe you will be nonsuited. I'll take care of my\r\nnephew myself. Your coach-hire and family charges are most unreasonable\r\ndeductions; at that rate, I can bring in any man in the world my debtor.\r\nBut who the devil are those two majors that consume all my money? I find\r\nthey always run away with the balance in all accounts.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--Two very honest gentlemen, I assure you, that have done\r\nme some service. To tell you plainly, Major Ab. denotes thy greater\r\nability, and Major Will. thy greater willingness to carry on this\r\nlawsuit. It was but reasonable thou shouldst pay both for thy power and\r\nthy positiveness.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I believe I shall have those two honest majors' discount on\r\nmy side in a little time.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--Why all this higgling with thy friend about such a paltry\r\nsum? Does this become the generosity of the noble and rich John Bull? I\r\nwonder thou art not ashamed. Oh, Hocus! Hocus! where art thou? It used\r\nto go another-guess manner in thy time. When a poor man has almost\r\nundone himself for thy sake, thou art for fleecing him, and fleecing\r\nhim. Is that thy conscience, John?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Very pleasant, indeed! It is well known thou retainest thy\r\nlawyers by the year, so a fresh lawsuit adds but little to thy expenses;\r\nthey are thy customers;* I hardly ever sell them a farthing's-worth of\r\nanything. Nay, thou hast set up an eating-house, where the whole tribe\r\nof them spend all they can rap or run. If it were well reckoned, I\r\nbelieve thou gettest more of my money than thou spendest of thy own.\r\nHowever, if thou wilt needs plead poverty, own at least that thy\r\naccounts are false.\r\n\r\n     * The money spent in Holland and Flanders.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--No, marry won't I; I refer myself to these honest\r\ngentlemen--let them judge between us. Let Esquire South speak his mind,\r\nwhether my accounts are not right, and whether we ought not to go on\r\nwith our lawsuit.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Consult the butchers about keeping of Lent. Dost think that\r\nJohn Bull will be tried by piepowders? I tell you, once for all, John\r\nBull knows where his shoe pinches. None of your esquires shall give him\r\nthe law as long as he wears this trusty weapon by his side, or has an\r\ninch of broadcloth in his shop.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--Why, there it is: you will be both judge and party. I am\r\nsorry thou discoverest so much of thy headstrong humour before these\r\nstrange gentlemen; I have often told thee it would prove thy ruin\r\nsome time or other. Let it never be said that the famous John Bull has\r\ndeparted in despite of Court.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--And will it not reflect as much on thy character, Nic., to\r\nturn barretter in thy old days--a stirrer-up of quarrels amongst thy\r\nneighbours? I tell thee, Nic., some time or other thou wilt repent this.\r\n\r\nBut John saw clearly he should have nothing but wrangling, and that he\r\nshould have as little success in settling his accounts as ending the\r\ncomposition. \"Since they will needs overload my shoulders,\" quoth John,\r\n\"I shall throw down the burden with a squash amongst them, take it up\r\nwho dares. A man has a fine time of it amongst a combination of sharpers\r\nthat vouch for one another's honesty. John, look to thyself; old Lewis\r\nmakes reasonable offers. When thou hast spent the small pittance that\r\nis left, thou wilt make a glorious figure when thou art brought to live\r\nupon Nic. Frog and Esquire South's generosity and gratitude. If they use\r\nthee thus when they want thee, what will they do when thou wantest them?\r\nI say again, John, look to thyself.\"\r\n\r\nJohn wisely stifled his resentments, and told the company that in a\r\nlittle time he should give them law, or something better.\r\n\r\nALL.--*Law! law! sir, by all means. What is twenty-two poor years\r\ntowards the finishing a lawsuit? For the love of God, more law, sir!\r\n\r\n     * Clamours for continuing the war.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Prepare your demands how many years more of law you want,\r\nthat I may order my affairs accordingly. In the meanwhile, farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. How John Bull found all his Family in an Uproar at Home.*\r\n\r\nNic. Frog, who thought of nothing but carrying John to the market, and\r\nthere disposing of him as his own proper goods, was mad to find that\r\nJohn thought himself now of age to look after his own affairs. He\r\nresolved to traverse this new project, and to make him uneasy in his own\r\nfamily. He had corrupted or deluded most of his servants into the most\r\nextravagant conceits in the world: that their master was run mad, and\r\nwore a dagger in one pocket and poison in the other; that he had sold\r\nhis wife and children to Lewis, disinherited his heir, and was going\r\nto settle his estate upon a parish-boy; that if they did not look after\r\ntheir master, he would do some very mischievous thing. When John came\r\nhome, he found a more surprising scene than any he had yet met with, and\r\nthat you will say was somewhat extraordinary.\r\n\r\n     * Clamours about the danger of the succession.\r\n\r\nHe called his cook-maid Betty to bespeak his dinner. Betty told him\r\n\"That she begged his pardon, she could not dress dinner till she knew\r\nwhat he intended to do with his will.\" \"Why, Betty,\" quoth John, \"thou\r\nart not run mad, art thou? My will at present is to have dinner.\" \"That\r\nmay be,\" quoth Betty, \"but my conscience won't allow me to dress it till\r\nI know whether you intend to do righteous things by your heir.\" \"I am\r\nsorry for that, Betty,\" quoth John; \"I must find somebody else, then.\"\r\nThen he called John the barber. \"Before I begin,\" quoth John, \"I hope\r\nyour honour won't be offended if I ask you whether you intend to alter\r\nyour will? If you won't give me a positive answer your beard may grow\r\ndown to your middle for me.\" \"'Igad, so it shall,\" quoth Bull, \"for I\r\nwill never trust my throat in such a mad fellow's hands. Where's Dick\r\nthe butler?\" \"Look ye,\" quoth Dick, \"I am very willing to serve you in\r\nmy calling, d'you see, but there are strange reports, and plain-dealing\r\nis best, d'ye see. I must be satisfied if you intend to leave all to\r\nyour nephew and if Nic. Frog is still your executor, d'ye see. If you\r\nwill not satisfy me as to these points you may drink with the ducks.\"\r\n\"And so I will,\" quoth John, \"rather than keep a butler that loves my\r\nheir better than myself.\" Hob the shoemaker, and Pricket the tailor,\r\ntold him they would most willingly serve him in their several stations\r\nif he would promise them never to talk with Lewis Baboon, and let\r\nNicholas Frog, linen-draper, manage his concerns; that they\r\ncould neither make shoes nor clothes to any that were not in good\r\ncorrespondence with their worthy friend Nicholas.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Call Andrew, my journeyman. How goes affairs, Andrew? I hope\r\nthe devil has not taken possession of thy body too.\r\n\r\nANDREW.--No, sir; I only desire to know what you would do if you were\r\ndead?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Just as other dead folks do, Andrew. [Aside.] This is\r\namazing!\r\n\r\nANDREW.--I mean if your nephew shall inherit your estate.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--That depends upon himself. I shall do nothing to hinder him.\r\n\r\nANDREW.--But will you make it sure?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Thou meanest that I should put him in possession, for I can\r\nmake it no surer without that. He has all the law can give him.\r\n\r\nANDREW.--Indeed, possession, as you say, would make it much surer. They\r\nsay it is eleven points of the law.\r\n\r\nJohn began now to think that they were all enchanted. He inquired\r\nabout the age of the moon, if Nic. had not given them some intoxicating\r\npotion, or if old Mother Jenisa was still alive? \"No, o' my faith,\"\r\nquoth Harry, \"I believe there is no potion in the case but a little\r\naurum potabile. You will have more of this by-and-by.\" He had scarce\r\nspoken the word when another friend of John's accosted him after the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n\"Since those worthy persons, who are as much concerned for your safety\r\nas I am, have employed me as their orator, I desire to know whether you\r\nwill have it by way of syllogism, enthymem, dilemma, or sorites?\"\r\n\r\nJohn now began to be diverted with their extravagance.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Let's have a sorites by all means, though they are all new\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nFRIEND.--It is evident to all that are versed in history that there\r\nwere two sisters that played false two thousand years ago. Therefore it\r\nplainly follows that it is not lawful for John Bull to have any manner\r\nof intercourse with Lewis Baboon. If it is not lawful for John Bull to\r\nhave any manner of intercourse (correspondence, if you will, that is\r\nmuch the same thing) then, a fortiori, it is much more unlawful for the\r\nsaid John to make over his wife and children to the said Lewis. If his\r\nwife and children are not to be made over, he is not to wear a dagger\r\nand ratsbane in his pockets. If he wears a dagger and ratsbane, it\r\nmust be to do mischief to himself or somebody else. If he intends to do\r\nmischief, he ought to be under guardians, and there is none so fit as\r\nmyself and some other worthy persons who have a commission for that\r\npurpose from Nic. Frog, the executor of his will and testament.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--And this is your sorites, you say?\r\n\r\nWith that he snatched a good tough oaken cudgel, and began to brandish\r\nit. Then happy was the man that was first at the door. Crowding to get\r\nout, they tumbled down-stairs. And it is credibly reported some of\r\nthem dropped very valuable things in the hurry, which were picked up by\r\nothers of the family.\r\n\r\n\"That any of these rogues,\" quoth John, \"should imagine I am not as much\r\nconcerned as they about having my affairs in a settled condition, or\r\nthat I would wrong my heir for I know not what! Well, Nic., I really\r\ncannot but applaud thy diligence. I must own this is really a pretty\r\nsort of a trick, but it sha'n't do thy business, for all that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Lewis Baboon came to visit John Bull, and what passed\r\nbetween them. *\r\n\r\n     * Private negotiations about Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nI think it is but ingenuous to acquaint the reader that this chapter was\r\nnot wrote by Sir Humphrey himself, but by another very able pen of the\r\nuniversity of Grub Street.\r\n\r\nJohn had, by some good instructions given him by Sir Roger, got the\r\nbetter of his choleric temper, and wrought himself up to a great\r\nsteadiness of mind to pursue his own interest through all impediments\r\nthat were thrown in the way. He began to leave off some of his old\r\nacquaintance, his roaring and bullying about the streets. He put on\r\na serious air, knit his brows, and, for the time, had made a very\r\nconsiderable progress in politics, considering that he had been kept a\r\nstranger to his own affairs. However, he could not help discovering\r\nsome remains of his nature when he happened to meet with a football or a\r\nmatch at cricket, for which Sir Roger was sure to take him to task.\r\nJohn was walking about his room with folded arms and a most thoughtful\r\ncountenance. His servant brought him word that one Lewis Baboon below\r\nwanted to speak with him. John had got an impression that Lewis was so\r\ndeadly cunning a man that he was afraid to venture himself alone with\r\nhim. At last he took heart of grace. \"Let him come up,\" quoth he; \"it is\r\nbut sticking to my point, and he can never over-reach me.\"\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--Monsieur Bull, I will frankly acknowledge that my\r\nbehaviour to my neighbours has been somewhat uncivil, and I believe you\r\nwill readily grant me that I have met with usage accordingly. I was fond\r\nof back-sword and cudgel-play from my youth, and I now bear in my\r\nbody many a black and blue gash and scar, God knows. I had as good a\r\nwarehouse and as fair possessions as any of my neighbours, though I say\r\nit. But a contentious temper, flattering servants, and unfortunate stars\r\nhave brought me into circumstances that are not unknown to you. These\r\nmy misfortunes are heightened by domestic calamities. That I need not\r\nrelate. I am a poor old battered fellow, and I would willingly end my\r\ndays in peace. But, alas! I see but small hopes of that, for every new\r\ncircumstance affords an argument to my enemies to pursue their revenge.\r\nFormerly I was to be banged because I was too strong, and now because\r\nI am too weak to resist; I am to be brought down when too rich, and\r\noppressed when too poor. Nic. Frog has used me like a scoundrel. You are\r\na gentleman, and I freely put myself in your hands to dispose of me as\r\nyou think fit.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Look you, Master Baboon, as to your usage of your\r\nneighbours, you had best not dwell too much upon that chapter. Let it\r\nsuffice at present that you have been met with. You have been rolling a\r\ngreat stone up-hill all your life, and at last it has come tumbling down\r\ntill it is like to crush you to pieces. Plain-dealing is best. If you\r\nhave any particular mark, Mr. Baboon, whereby one may know when you fib\r\nand when you speak truth, you had best tell it me, that one may proceed\r\naccordingly. But since at present I know of none such, it is better that\r\nyou should trust me than that I should trust you.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--I know of no particular mark of veracity amongst us\r\ntradesmen but interest; and it is manifestly mine not to deceive you at\r\nthis time. You may safely trust me, I can assure you.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--The trust I give is, in short, this: I must have something\r\nin hand before I make the bargain, and the rest before it is concluded.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--To show you I deal fairly, name your something.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I need not tell thee, old boy; thou canst guess.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--Ecclesdown Castle,* I'll warrant you, because it has been\r\nformerly in your family. Say no more; you shall have it.\r\n\r\n     * Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I shall have it to my own self?\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--To thine own self.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Every wall, gate, room, and inch of Ecclesdown Castle, you\r\nsay?\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--Just so.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Every single stone of Ecclesdown Castle, to my own self,\r\nspeedily?\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--When you please; what needs more words?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--But tell me, old boy, hast thou laid aside all thy\r\nequivocals and mentals in this case?\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--There's nothing like matter of fact; seeing is believing.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Now thou talkest to the purpose; let us shake hands, old\r\nboy. Let me ask thee one question more; what hast thou to do to meddle\r\nwith the affairs of my family? to dispose of my estate, old boy?\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--Just as much as you have to do with the affairs of Lord\r\nStrutt.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Ay, but my trade, my very being was concerned in that.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--And my interest was concerned in the other. But let us\r\ndrop both our pretences; for I believe it is a moot point, whether I am\r\nmore likely to make a Master Bull, or you a Lord Strutt.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Agreed, old boy; but then I must have security that I shall\r\ncarry my broadcloth to market, old boy.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--That you shall: Ecclesdown Castle! Ecclesdown! Remember\r\nthat. Why wouldst thou not take it when it was offered thee some years\r\nago?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I would not take it, because they told me thou wouldst not\r\ngive it me.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--How could Monsieur Bull be so grossly abused by downright\r\nnonsense? they that advised you to refuse, must have believed I intended\r\nto give, else why would they not make the experiment? But I can tell you\r\nmore of that matter than perhaps you know at present.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--But what say'st thou as to the Esquire, Nic. Frog, and the\r\nrest of the tradesmen? I must take care of them.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--Thou hast but small obligations to Nic. to my certain\r\nknowledge: he has not used me like a gentleman.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Nic. indeed is not very nice in your punctilios of ceremony;\r\nhe is clownish, as a man may say: belching and calling of names have\r\nbeen allowed him time out of mind, by prescription: but, however, we are\r\nengaged in one common cause, and I must look after him.\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--All matters that relate to him, and the rest of the\r\nplaintiff's in this lawsuit, I will refer to your justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. Nic. Frog's letter to John Bull: wherein he endeavours to\r\nvindicate all his conduct, with relation to John Bull and the lawsuit.\r\n\r\nNic. perceived now that his Cully had eloped, that John intended\r\nhenceforth to deal without a broker; but he was resolved to leave no\r\nstone unturned to cover his bubble. Amongst other artifices he wrote a\r\nmost obliging letter, which he sent him printed in a fair character.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR FRIEND,--When I consider the late ill-usage I have met with from\r\nyou, I was reflecting what it was that could provoke you to it, but\r\nupon a narrow inspection into my conduct, I can find nothing to reproach\r\nmyself with but too partial a concern for your interest. You no sooner\r\nset this composition afoot but I was ready to comply, and prevented your\r\nvery wishes; and the affair might have been ended before now, had it\r\nnot been for the greater concerns of Esquire South and the other poor\r\ncreatures embarked in the same common cause, whose safety touches me to\r\nthe quick. You seemed a little jealous that I had dealt unfairly with\r\nyou in money-matters, till it appeared by your own accounts that there\r\nwas something due to me upon the balance. Having nothing to answer to so\r\nplain a demonstration, you began to complain as if I had been familiar\r\nwith your reputation; when it is well known not only I, but the meanest\r\nservants in my family, talk of you with the utmost respect. I have\r\nalways, as far as in me lies, exhorted your servants and tenants to be\r\ndutiful; not that I any way meddle in your domestic affairs, which were\r\nvery unbecoming for me to do. If some of your servants express their\r\ngreat concern for you in a manner that is not so very polite, you ought\r\nto impute it to their extraordinary zeal, which deserves a reward\r\nrather than a reproof. You cannot reproach me for want of success at\r\nthe 'Salutation,' since I am not master of the passions and interests of\r\nother folks. I have beggared myself with this lawsuit, undertaken merely\r\nin complaisance to you; and if you would have had but a little patience,\r\nI had still greater things in reserve, that I intended to have done for\r\nyou. I hope what I have said will prevail with you to lay aside your\r\nunreasonable jealousies, and that we may have no more meetings at the\r\n'Salutation,' spending our time and money to no purpose. My concern for\r\nyour welfare and prosperity almost makes me mad. You may be assured I\r\nwill continue to be\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate\r\n\r\n\"Friend and Servant,\r\n\r\n\"Nic. Frog.\"*\r\n\r\n     * Substance of the States letter.\r\n\r\nJohn received this with a good deal of sang-froid; \"Transeat,\" quoth\r\nJohn, \"cum caeteris erroribus.\" He was now at his ease; he saw he could\r\nnow make a very good bargain for himself, and a very safe one for other\r\nfolks. \"My shirt,\" quoth he, \"is near me, but my skin is nearer. Whilst\r\nI take care of the welfare of other folks, nobody can blame me to apply\r\na little balsam to my own sores. It's a pretty thing, after all, for a\r\nman to do his own business; a man has such a tender concern for himself,\r\nthere's nothing like it. This is somewhat better, I trow, than for John\r\nBull to be standing in the market, like a great dray-horse, with Frog's\r\npaws upon his head. What will you give me for this beast? Serviteur\r\nNic. Frog, though John Bull has not read your Aristotles, Platos, and\r\nMachiavels, he can see as far into a mill-stone as another.\" With that\r\nJohn began to chuckle and laugh till he was like to have burst his\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. The discourse that passed between Nic. Frog and Esquire\r\nSouth, which John Bull overheard.*\r\n\r\n     * Negotiations between the Emperor and the Dutch for\r\n     continuing the war, and getting the property of Flanders.\r\n\r\nJohn thought every minute a year till he got into Ecclesdown Castle; he\r\nrepairs to the \"Salutation\" with a design to break the matter gently to\r\nhis partners. Before he entered he overheard Nic. and the Esquire in a\r\nvery pleasant conference.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--Oh, the ingratitude and injustice of mankind! That John\r\nBull, whom I have honoured with my friendship and protection so long,\r\nshould flinch at last, and pretend that he can disburse no more money\r\nfor me! that the family of the Souths, by his sneaking temper, should be\r\nkept out of their own!\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--An't like your worship, I am in amaze at it; I think the\r\nrogue should be compelled to his duty.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--That he should prefer his scandalous pelf, the dust and\r\ndregs of the earth, to the prosperity and grandeur of my family!\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--Nay, he is mistaken there, too; for he would quickly lick\r\nhimself whole again by his vails. It's strange he should prefer Philip\r\nBaboon's custom to Esquire South's.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--As you say, that my clothier, that is to get so much by\r\nthe purchase, should refuse to put me in possession; did you ever know\r\nany man's tradesman serve him so before?\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--No, indeed, an't please your worship, it is a very unusual\r\nproceeding; and I would not have been guilty of it for the world. If\r\nyour honour had not a great stock of moderation and patience, you would\r\nnot bear it so well as you do.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--It is most intolerable, that's certain, Nic., and I will\r\nbe revenged.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--Methinks it is strange that Philip Baboon's tenants do not\r\nall take your honour's part, considering how good and gentle a master\r\nyou are.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--True, Nic., but few are sensible of merit in this world.\r\nIt is a great comfort to have so faithful a friend as thyself in so\r\ncritical a juncture.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--If all the world should forsake you, be assured Nic. Frog\r\nnever will; let us stick to our point, and we'll manage Bull, I'll\r\nwarrant ye.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--Let me kiss thee, dear Nic.; I have found one honest man\r\namong a thousand at last.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--If it were possible, your honour has it in your power to wed\r\nme still closer to your interest.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--Tell me quickly, dear Nic.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--You know I am your tenant; the difference between my lease\r\nand an inheritance is such a trifle as I am sure you will not grudge\r\nyour poor friend. That will be an encouragement to go on; besides, it\r\nwill make Bull as mad as the devil: you and I shall be able to manage\r\nhim then to some purpose.\r\n\r\nESQUIRE SOUTH.--Say no more; it shall be done, Nic., to thy heart's\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nJohn all this while was listening to this comical dialogue, and laughed\r\nheartily in his sleeve at the pride and simplicity of the Esquire, and\r\nthe sly roguery of his friend Nic. Then of a sudden bolting into the\r\nroom, he began to tell them that he believed he had brought Lewis to\r\nreasonable terms, if they would please to hear them.\r\n\r\nThen they all bawled out aloud, \"No composition: long live Esquire South\r\nand the Law!\" As John was going to proceed, some roared, some stamped\r\nwith their feet, others stopped their ears with their fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, gentlemen,\" quoth John, \"if you will but stop proceeding for\r\na while, you shall judge yourselves whether Lewis's proposals* are\r\nreasonable.\"\r\n\r\n     * Proposals for cessation of arms and delivery of Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nALL.--Very fine, indeed; stop proceeding, and so lose a term.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Not so neither; we have something by way of advance: he will\r\nput us in possession of his Manor and Castle of Ecclesdown.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--What dost talk of us? thou meanest thyself.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--When Frog took possession of anything, it was always said to\r\nbe for us, and why may not John Bull be us as well as Nic. Frog was us?\r\nI hope John Bull is no more confined to singularity than Nic. Frog; or,\r\ntake it so, the constant doctrine that thou hast preached up for many\r\nyears was that thou and I are one; and why must we be supposed two in\r\nthis case, that were always one before? It's impossible that thou and I\r\ncan fall out, Nic.; we must trust one another. I have trusted thee with\r\na great many things--prithee trust me with this one trifle.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--That principle is true in the main, but there is some\r\nspeciality in this case that makes it highly inconvenient for us both.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Those are your jealousies, that the common enemies sow\r\nbetween us: how often hast thou warned me of those rogues, Nic., that\r\nwould make us mistrustful of one another!\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--This Ecclesdown Castle is only a bone of contention.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--It depends upon you to make it so; for my part, I am as\r\npeaceable as a lamb.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--But do you consider the unwholesomeness of the air and soil,\r\nthe expenses of reparations and servants? I would scorn to accept of\r\nsuch a quagmire.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--You are a great man, Nic., but in my circumstances I must be\r\ne'en content to take it as it is.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--And you are really so silly as to believe the old cheating\r\nrogue will give it you?\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I believe nothing but matter of fact; I stand and fall by\r\nthat. I am resolved to put him to it.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--And so relinquish the hopefullest cause in the world: a\r\nclaim that will certainly in the end make thy fortune for ever.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Wilt thou purchase it, Nic.? thou shalt have a lumping\r\npennyworth; nay, rather than we should differ, I'll give thee something\r\nto take it off my hands.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--If thou wouldst but moderate that hasty, impatient temper\r\nof thine, thou shouldst quickly see a better thing than all that. What\r\nshouldst thou think to find old Lewis turned out of his paternal estates\r\nand mansion-house of Claypool?* Would not that do thy heart good, to see\r\nthy old friend, Nic. Frog, Lord of Claypool? Then thou and thy wife and\r\nchildren should walk in my gardens, buy toys, drink lemonade, and now\r\nand then we should have a country dance.\r\n\r\n     * Claypool, Paris--Lutetia.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I love to be plain: I'd as lief see myself in Ecclesdown\r\nCastle as thee in Claypool. I tell you again, Lewis gives this as a\r\npledge of his sincerity; if you won't stop proceeding to hear him, I\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. The rest of Nic.'s fetches to keep John out of Ecclesdown\r\nCastle.*\r\n\r\n     * Attempts to hinder the cessation, and taking possession of\r\n     Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nWhen Nic. could not dissuade John by argument, he tried to move his\r\npity; he pretended to be sick and like to die; that he should leave his\r\nwife and children in a starving condition, if John did abandon him; that\r\nhe was hardly able to crawl about the room, far less capable to look\r\nafter such a troublesome business as this lawsuit, and therefore begged\r\nthat his good friend would not leave him. When he saw that John was\r\nstill inexorable, he pulled out a case-knife, with which he used to\r\nsnicker-snee, and threatened to cut his own throat. Thrice he aimed\r\nthe knife to his windpipe with a most determined threatening air. \"What\r\nsignifies life,\" quoth he, \"in this languishing condition? It will be\r\nsome pleasure that my friends will revenge my death upon this barbarous\r\nman that has been the cause of it.\" All this while John looked sedate\r\nand calm, neither offering in the least to snatch the knife, nor stop\r\nhis blow, trusting to the tenderness Nic. had for his own person. When\r\nhe perceived that John was immovable in his purpose, he applied himself\r\nto Lewis.\r\n\r\n\"Art thou,\" quoth he, \"turned bubble in thy old age, from being a\r\nsharper in thy youth? What occasion hast thou to give up Ecclesdown\r\nCastle to John Bull? His friendship is not worth a rush. Give it me, and\r\nI'll make it worth thy while. If thou dislikest that proposition, keep\r\nit thyself; I'd rather thou shouldst have it than he. If thou hearkenest\r\nnot to my advice, take what follows; Esquire South and I will go on with\r\nour lawsuit in spite of John Bull's teeth.\"\r\n\r\nLEWIS BABOON.--Monsieur Bull has used me like a gentleman, and I am\r\nresolved to make good my promise, and trust him for the consequences.\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--Then I tell thee thou art an old doating fool.--With that\r\nNic. bounced up with a spring equal to that of one of your nimblest\r\ntumblers or rope-dancers, and fell foul upon John Bull, to snatch the\r\ncudgel* he had in his hand, that he might thwack Lewis with it: John\r\nheld it fast so that there was no wrenching it from him. At last Squire\r\nSouth buckled to, to assist his friend Nic.: John hauled on one side,\r\nand they two on the other. Sometimes they were like to pull John\r\nover, then it went all of a sudden again on John's side, so they went\r\nsee-sawing up and down, from one end of the room to the other. Down\r\ntumbled the tables, bottles, glasses, and tobacco-pipes; the wine and\r\nthe tobacco were all spilt about the room, and the little fellows were\r\nalmost trod under foot, till more of the tradesmen joining with Nic. and\r\nthe Squire, John was hardly able to pull against then all, yet would he\r\nnever quit hold of his trusty cudgel: which by the contrary force of two\r\nso great powers broke short in his hands.** Nic. seized the longer end,\r\nand with it began to bastinado old Lewis, who had slunk into a corner,\r\nwaiting the event of this squabble. Nic. came up to him with an insolent\r\nmenacing air, so that the old fellow was forced to scuttle out of the\r\nroom, and retire behind a dung-cart. He called to Nic., \"Thou insolent\r\njackanapes, time was when thou durst not have used me so; thou now\r\ntakest me unprovided; but, old and infirm as I am, I shall find a weapon\r\nby-and-by to chastise thy impudence.\"\r\n\r\n     * The army.\r\n\r\n     ** The separation of the army.\r\n\r\nWhen John Bull had recovered his breath, he began to parley with\r\nNic.: \"Friend Nic., I am glad to find thee so strong after thy great\r\ncomplaints; really thy motions, Nic., are pretty vigorous for a\r\nconsumptive man. As for thy worldly affairs, Nic., if it can do thee\r\nany service, I freely make over to thee this profitable lawsuit, and\r\nI desire all these gentlemen to bear witness to this my act and deed.\r\nYours be all the gain, as mine has been the charges. I have brought\r\nit to bear finely: however, all I have laid out upon it goes for\r\nnothing--thou shalt have it with all its appurtenances; I ask nothing\r\nbut leave to go home.\"\r\n\r\nNIC. FROG.--The counsel are fee'd, and all things prepared for a trial;\r\nthou shalt be forced to stand the issue; it shall be pleaded in thy\r\nname as well as mine. Go home if thou canst; the gates are shut, the\r\nturnpikes locked, and the roads barricaded.*\r\n\r\n     * Difficulty of the march of part of the army to Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Even these very ways, Nic., that thou toldest me were as\r\nopen to me as thyself, if I can't pass with my own equipage, what can I\r\nexpect for my goods and wagons? I am denied passage through those very\r\ngrounds that I have purchased with my own money. However, I am glad I\r\nhave made the experiment; it may serve me in some stead.\r\n\r\nJohn Bull was so overjoyed that he was going to take possession of\r\nEcclesdown, that nothing could vex him. \"Nic.,\" quoth he, \"I am just\r\na-going to leave thee; cast a kind look upon me at parting.\"\r\n\r\nNic. looked sour and glum, and would not open his mouth.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--I wish thee all the success that thy heart can desire, and\r\nthat these honest gentlemen of the long robe may have their belly full\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nNic. could stand it no longer, but flung out of the room with disdain,\r\nand beckoned the lawyers to follow him.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--B'ye, b'ye, Nic,; not one poor smile at parting? won't you\r\nshake your day-day, Nic? b'ye, Nic.--With that John marched out of the\r\ncommon road, across the country, to take possession of Ecclesdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. Of the great joy that John expressed when he got\r\npossession of Ecclesdown.*\r\n\r\n     * Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nWhen John had got into his castle he seemed like Ulysses upon his plank\r\nafter he had been well soused in salt water, who, as Homer says, was as\r\nglad as a judge going to sit down to dinner after hearing a long cause\r\nupon the bench. I daresay John Bull's joy was equal to that of either\r\nof the two; he skipped from room to room, ran up-stairs and down-stairs,\r\nfrom the kitchen to the garrets, and from the garrets to the kitchen;\r\nhe peeped into every cranny; sometimes he admired the beauty of the\r\narchitecture and the vast solidity of the mason's work; at other times\r\nhe commended the symmetry and proportion of the rooms. He walked about\r\nthe gardens; he bathed himself in the canal, swimming, diving, and\r\nbeating the liquid element like a milk-white swan. The hall resounded\r\nwith the sprightly violin and the martial hautbois. The family tripped\r\nit about, and capered like hailstones bounding from a marble floor.\r\nWine, ale, and October flew about as plentifully as kennel-water. Then\r\na frolic took John in the head to call up some of Nic. Frog's pensioners\r\nthat had been so mutinous in his family.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Are you glad to see your master in Ecclesdown Castle?\r\n\r\nALL.--Yes, indeed, sir.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Extremely glad?\r\n\r\nALL.--Extremely glad, sir.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Swear to me that you are so.\r\n\r\nThen they began to sink their souls to the lowest pit if any person in\r\nthe world rejoiced more than they did.\r\n\r\nJOHN BULL.--Now hang me if I don't believe you are a parcel of perjured\r\nrascals; however, take this bumper of October to your master's health.\r\n\r\nThen John got upon the battlements, and looking over he called to Nic.\r\nFrog.--\r\n\r\n\"How d'ye do, Nic.? D'ye see where I am, Nic.? I hope the cause goes\r\non swimmingly, Nic. When dost thou intend to go to Claypool, Nic.? Wilt\r\nthou buy there some high heads of the newest cut for my daughters? How\r\ncomest thou to go with thy arm tied up? Has old Lewis given thee a rap\r\nover thy fingers' ends? Thy weapon was a good one when I wielded it, but\r\nthe butt-end remains in my hands. I am so busy in packing up my goods\r\nthat I have no time to talk with thee any longer. It would do thy heart\r\ngood to see what wagon-loads I am preparing for market. If thou wantest\r\nany good office of mine, for all that has happened I will use thee well,\r\nNic. B'ye, Nic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nIt has been disputed amongst the literati of Grub Street whether Sir\r\nHumphry proceeded any farther into the history of John Bull.
