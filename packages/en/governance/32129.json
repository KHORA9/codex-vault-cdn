The emphasis is on objective\r\ndescription of the nation's present society and the kinds of possible or\r\nprobable changes that might be expected in the future. The handbook\r\nseeks to present as full and as balanced an integrated exposition as\r\nlimitations on space and research time permit. It was compiled from\r\ninformation available in openly published material. An extensive\r\nbibliography is provided to permit recourse to other published sources\r\nfor more detailed information. There has been no attempt to express any\r\nspecific point of view or to make policy recommendations. The contents\r\nof the handbook represent the work of the authors and FAS and do not\r\nrepresent the official view of the United States government.\r\n\r\nAn effort has been made to make the handbook as comprehensive as\r\npossible. It can be expected, however, that the material,\r\ninterpretations, and conclusions are subject to modification in the\r\nlight of new information and developments. Such corrections, additions,\r\nand suggestions for factual, interpretive, or other change as readers\r\nmay have will be welcomed for use in future revisions. Comments may be\r\naddressed to:\r\n\r\n The Director\r\n Foreign Area Studies\r\n The American University\r\n 5010 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W.\r\n Washington, D.C. 20016\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbania, or, as it proclaimed itself in 1946, the People's Republic of\r\nAlbania, emerged from World War II under the control of the local\r\nCommunist movement, which later adopted the name Albanian Workers'\r\nParty. The most remarkable feature of Albanian life during the 1960s was\r\nthe rigid alignment with Communist China in that country's ideological\r\nstruggle with the Soviet Union. In mid-1970 the country continued to be\r\nCommunist China's only European ally and its mouthpiece in the United\r\nNations. Propaganda broadcasts in several languages, extensive for such\r\na small, undeveloped country, continued to emanate from the capital city\r\nof Tirana, constantly reiterating the Chinese Communist line and making\r\nRadio Tirana sound like an extension of Radio Peking.\r\n\r\nAlbania's most notable tradition from ancient times has been one of\r\nforeign domination. Brief periods of independence have been overshadowed\r\nby long centuries of subjection to alien rule. Foreign rulers never\r\nseemed able or willing to subject the Albanian peasants to the complete\r\nauthority of a central government. Throughout their history Albanians,\r\nprotected by the remoteness of their mountain villages, often enjoyed a\r\nmeasure of autonomy even though they lacked national independence. The\r\nforeign domination plus the limited autonomy developed in the people a\r\nspirit of fierce independence and a suspicion of neighboring states that\r\nmight have designs on their territorial integrity.\r\n\r\nMilitarily undeveloped but unwilling to submit to partition by its\r\nneighbors, Albania has held on precariously to autonomy since World War\r\nII by becoming a client state--first to Yugoslavia, then to the Soviet\r\nUnion, and then to Communist China. In all three relationships Albania\r\nhas maintained its independence but it has not been able to establish\r\nitself as a viable economic entity.\r\n\r\nThe _Area Handbook for Albania_ seeks to present an overview of the\r\nvarious social, political, and economic aspects of the country as they\r\nappeared in 1970. The leaders of the Communist Party have gone to\r\nextremes to maintain an aura of secrecy about their nation and their\r\nefforts to govern it. Material on Albania is scanty and some that is\r\navailable is not reliable but, using their own judgments on sources, the\r\nauthors have striven for objectivity in this effort to depict Albanian\r\nsociety in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe spelling of place names conforms to the rulings of the United States\r\nBoard on Geographic Names, with the exception that no diacritical marks\r\nhave been used in this volume. The metric system has been used only for\r\ntonnages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n1. COUNTRY: People's Republic of Albania (Albania). Called Shqiperia by\r\nAlbanians. A national state since 1912. Under Communist control after\r\n1944.\r\n\r\n2. GOVERNMENT: Functions much like Party-state model of Soviet Union.\r\nConstitution designates People's Assembly as highest state organ; its\r\nPresidium conducts state affairs between Assembly sessions. People's\r\nCouncil highest organ at district and lower echelons. Communist Party\r\n(officially, the Albanian Workers' Party) organizations parallel\r\ngovernment organizations and control them from national to local levels.\r\nParty members hold all key positions in government.\r\n\r\n3. SIZE AND LOCATION: Area, 11,100 square miles; smallest of the\r\nEuropean Communist states. Extends 210 miles from southern to northern\r\nextremities; 90 miles on longest east-west axis. Bordered on north and\r\neast by Yugoslavia; on southeast and south by Greece; and on west by\r\nAdriatic and Ionian seas.\r\n\r\n4. TOPOGRAPHY: A narrow strip of lowland borders Adriatic Sea; remainder\r\nof country is mountainous and hilly, intersected by streams that flow in\r\nwesterly or northwesterly direction. Terrain is generally rugged.\r\n\r\n5. CLIMATE: Unusually varied. Coastal lowlands have Mediterranean-type\r\nclimate. Inland fluctuations common, but continental influences\r\npredominate. Annual precipitation is 40 to 100 inches according to area;\r\nhighly seasonal; summer droughts common. Temperatures vary widely\r\nbecause of differences in elevation and the changes in prevailing\r\nMediterranean and continental air currents.\r\n\r\n6. ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISIONS: Twenty-six districts. Economic and social\r\nfactors played important role in shaping delineations. Control and\r\ndirection is from Tirana.\r\n\r\n7. POPULATION: Estimated 2.1 million in January 1970. Growth unusually\r\nrapid; at 1970 rate, would double in twenty-six years. Two-thirds live\r\nin rural areas. Inhabitants are 97-percent ethnic Albanian. About 106\r\nmales per 100 females.\r\n\r\n8. LABOR: In 1967 the working-age population numbered about 932,000, of\r\nwhich approximately 745,000 were employed. About 66.7 percent were in\r\nagriculture; 14.1 percent in industry; 5.4 percent in construction; and\r\n13.8 percent in trade, education, health, and others.\r\n\r\n9. LANGUAGE: Albanian spoken by everyone. Some of the 3-percent minority\r\nuse tongue of country of family origin as a second language.\r\n\r\n10. EDUCATION: Nearly all persons under age forty are literate,\r\naccording to Albanian statistics. Communist ideas and principles\r\nemphasized with strict controls by centralized authority. Production of\r\ncapabilities and skills required for modernization and industrialization\r\nconsidered to be a major goal.\r\n\r\n11. RELIGION: Organized religion destroyed by government action in 1967.\r\nParty-directed antireligious campaign aims to eliminate religious\r\nthought and belief. Pre-World War II data indicated population to be\r\n70-percent Muslim, 20-percent Eastern Orthodox, and 10-percent Roman\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\n12. HEALTH: Many diseases, but reportedly greatly reduced or eliminated.\r\nHealth improved substantially after 1950, as reflected in Albanian\r\nreports. Malnutrition, poor sanitary-hygienic conditions, and lack of\r\ntrained personnel are continuing problems.\r\n\r\n13. JUSTICE: System of people's courts from national to village level;\r\npurportedly independent of administrative system but guided by Party\r\npolicy. Supreme Court elected by the People's Assembly. District judges\r\npopularly elected from among Party-approved candidates. Jury system not\r\nused. Persons are subject to military law and tried in military courts.\r\n\r\n14. ECONOMY: Government controlled. Follows planning model of Soviet\r\nUnion. Per capita gross national product lowest in Europe. Lack of\r\naccessible resources, arable land, and trained work force make for slow\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n15. INDUSTRY: Poorly developed despite heavy emphasis since 1950s, with\r\npriority to means of production. Extractive industries most productive.\r\nGrowth rates high in 1950s, slowed in 1960s.\r\n\r\n16. AGRICULTURE: Production low because of lack of arable land and\r\ninefficient methods. Cereal crops for domestic use and exportable items,\r\nsuch as tobacco, fruits, and vegetables, most important.\r\n\r\n17. IMPORTS: Largely items for industrial development and unfinished\r\nmaterials for processing. Some food, but quantity decreasing.\r\n\r\n18. EXPORTS: Mostly at the expense of domestic needs, except for some\r\nmetals and minerals. Low in proportion to imports, but increasing.\r\n\r\n19. FINANCE: Currency: The lek is standard unit; lacks solid backing.\r\nBanks are state owned and operated. National income consistently less\r\nthan expenditures, requiring supplement from foreign sources.\r\n\r\n20. COMMUNICATIONS: Government owned and controlled. Press and radio as\r\ninstruments to indoctrinate effectively reach the masses. Other media\r\npoorly developed.\r\n\r\n21. RAILROADS: Approximately 135 miles standard-gauge. None cross\r\ninternational borders.\r\n\r\n22. ROADS: Approximately 3,000 miles have improved surface. Rugged\r\nterrain makes travel difficult on others. None part of important\r\ninternational routes.\r\n\r\n23. PORTS: Durres, largest and most important, alone links with\r\nhinterland. Vlore only other major port.\r\n\r\n24. AIR TRANSPORTATION: Extremely limited within country and with\r\nforeign cities. Long-distance international flights require connections\r\nthrough intermediate points. Facilities for all but small aircraft\r\nlimited to Tirana area.\r\n\r\n25. INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES: Member, United Nations after\r\n1955. Member, Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and\r\nWarsaw Treaty Organization, 1955-68; participation all but ceased after\r\n1961 split with Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n26. AID PROGRAMS: United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency\r\n(UNRRA) 1945-46; Yugoslavia 1947-48, as an integrated economy; Soviet\r\nUnion 1948-61; and Communist China after 1961.\r\n\r\n27. SECURITY: Party-controlled agencies closely watch people's\r\nactivities and secure borders. Security forces total approximately\r\n12,500.\r\n\r\n28. ARMED FORCES: The People's Army, approximately 40,000, includes\r\narmy, navy, and air elements. Most conscripts serve two years. Cost,\r\nabout 10 percent of total budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                  Page\r\n\r\n FOREWORD                                                          iii\r\n\r\n PREFACE                                                             v\r\n\r\n COUNTRY SUMMARY                                                   vii\r\n\r\n Chapter 1.

Transportation Systems in Albania_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTER OF THE SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People's Republic of Albania was, in 1970, the smallest and\r\neconomically most backward of the European Communist nations, with an\r\narea of 11,100 square miles located between Yugoslavia and Greece along\r\nthe central west coast of the Balkan Peninsula. Its population of\r\napproximately 2.1 million was considered to be 97-percent ethnic\r\nAlbanian, with a smattering of Greeks, Vlachs, Bulgars, Serbs, and\r\nGypsies. Practically the entire population used Albanian as the\r\nprincipal language.\r\n\r\nThe country officially became a Communist \"people's republic\" in 1946\r\nafter one-party elections were held. Actually, the Communist-dominated\r\nNational Liberation Front had been the leading political power since\r\n1944, after successfully conducting civil war operations against\r\nnon-Communist forces while concurrently fighting against Italian and\r\nGerman armies of occupation. The Communist regime operated first under\r\nthe mask of the Democratic Front from 1944 to 1948 and, subsequently,\r\nthrough the Albanian Workers' Party; it asserted that it was a\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat--the workers and the peasants--and that\r\nit ruled according to the Leninist principle of democratic centralism.\r\nIn practice, a small, carefully selected Party group, which in 1970 was\r\nstill under the control of Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu, the partisan\r\nleaders of the World War II period, made all important policy and\r\noperational decisions (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political\r\nSystem).\r\n\r\nIn order to gain broad support for its programs the Party utilized mass\r\nsocial organizations. These included the Democratic Front, the successor\r\nin 1945 to the National Liberation Front; the Union of Albanian Working\r\nYouth; the United Trade Unions; and others. Direct election of\r\ngovernmental bodies, from the people's councils in villages to the\r\nPeople's Assembly at the national level, gave the appearance of\r\nrepresentative institutions. While seemingly democratic, these\r\nassemblies met infrequently and for short periods and had no real power.\r\n\r\nThe average citizen has never had any influence in national politics.\r\nDuring the 1920-39 period vested interests, mostly landowners and clan\r\nchiefs, were the predominant influence. A middle class was lacking, and\r\nthe great bulk of the population, the rural peasantry, was held in a\r\nstate of subservience by local leaders. Under Communist rule political\r\npower has been concentrated completely in the Party leadership (see ch.\r\n2, Historical Setting; ch. 6, Government Structure and Political\r\nSystem).\r\n\r\nThe system of controls circumscribed individual freedoms and reached\r\nnearly every facet of day-to-day life. The Communist regime, by its\r\ntotalitarian rule, extended and increased obedience to, and fear of,\r\ncentralized authority. A new ruling elite, that of the Party, was\r\nsubstituted for the _beys_ (see Glossary) and _pashas_ (see Glossary) of\r\npre-Communist times (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political\r\nSystem).\r\n\r\nThe goals of the Communist regime as revealed during the 1944-70 period\r\nwere to strengthen and perpetuate the Party's hold on the reins of\r\ngovernment, to maintain Albanian independence, and to modernize society\r\naccording to the Leninist-Stalinist model. By capitalizing on the\r\ndivisions among the Communist nations and by eliminating or rendering\r\nharmless internal opposition, the Party had a firm grip on the\r\ninstruments of control, and by 1961 independence was reasonably well\r\nsecured. Only modest progress had been made by 1970 toward\r\nmodernization. The lack of extensive natural resources and continued\r\nreliance on foreign aid caused much strain and required sacrifices by\r\nthe ordinary citizen (see ch. 2, Historical Setting; ch. 9, Internal and\r\nExternal Security).\r\n\r\nAlbania tended to be highly aggressive and partisan in the ideological\r\nstruggles between the Communist and Western democratic states and those\r\nbetween the Communist nations. The successive close relationships with\r\nYugoslavia (1944-48), the Soviet Union (1949-60), and China after 1961\r\nreflected the inherent insecurity of a weak state. Although these\r\ncoalitions frequently seemed to place Albania in a subservient role, the\r\nultimate goals of the Hoxha-Shehu regime were to develop political\r\nautonomy and economic self-sufficiency, thus reducing dependence on\r\nforeign aid to a point where Albania could be truly independent (see ch.\r\n6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nIn many respects Albania was a closed society. Government controls over\r\nall internal communications media ensured that only Party-approved\r\ninformation was disseminated; however, foreign transmissions were not\r\njammed, probably because funds were not available. The individual's\r\nactivities were closely watched by security police or other Party\r\nwatchdogs. Travel into and out of the country was restricted and closely\r\ncontrolled (see ch. 7, Communications and Cultural Development; ch. 9,\r\nInternal and External Security).\r\n\r\nPre-Communist Albania gained independence in 1912 after 4-½ centuries\r\nof rule by the Ottoman Turks. The movement toward nationhood during the\r\nlatter part of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth took\r\nadvantage of the disintegration of Turkish power and the rivalry between\r\nEuropean nations vying for control over the Balkans. The opportunity for\r\nindependence came when a group of Balkan nations attacked Turkey and\r\nproclaimed their intention of seizing the European part of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. A group of Albanian patriots, under the leadership of Ismail\r\nQemal bey Vlora, thwarted the desires of Albania's neighbors to\r\npartition the country by declaring independence on November 28, 1912.\r\nThe new nation sought and received backing from the great powers of\r\nEurope, thus forcing the weaker Balkan nations to give up their plans\r\nfor the annexation of Albanian territory.\r\n\r\nUnder the cruel, corrupt, and inefficient Ottoman rule, institutions and\r\ncapabilities for self-government were not allowed to develop, and the\r\ncountry was ill prepared for statehood when it arrived. Development had\r\nhardly begun when World War I brought chaos to the country as the\r\nopposing powers used it as a battleground. After the war, as Albania\r\nstruggled to assert itself as a national entity, the lack of natural\r\nresources and a poorly developed economy created a heavy requirement for\r\nforeign aid. Excessive reliance on Fascist Italy during the 1920s and\r\n1930s eventually led to annexation by that expansionist power.\r\n\r\nAfter regaining its independence during World War II, Albania again\r\ncompromised its sovereignty by excessive reliance on outside powers:\r\nfirst on Yugoslavia, which was heavily involved in the establishment of\r\nthe Communist Party in Albania, and then on the Soviet Union.\r\nCatastrophe was averted in each instance by a split between Communist\r\nnations. When Joseph Stalin expelled Yugoslavia from the Communist bloc\r\nof nations in 1948, Enver Hoxha switched his allegiance to the Soviet\r\nUnion and ended his country's economic reliance on Yugoslavia, which had\r\nall but incorporated Albania into its federation. For the next several\r\nyears Albania was a Soviet satellite but, as the rift between the Soviet\r\nUnion and Communist China widened, Hoxha continually sided with the\r\nChinese and, when the break came in 1961, Albania severed its Soviet\r\nties and became an ally of Communist China.\r\n\r\nThe lack of resources and an undeveloped economy, the same economic\r\nproblems that had plagued newly independent Albania in the 1920s,\r\ncontinued to be problems in 1970, and foreign aid was still a\r\nnecessity. Communist China provided an undetermined amount of assistance\r\nduring the 1960s and into 1970 but, from the Albanian point of view, the\r\ndanger of loss of sovereignty to distant China was much less than it had\r\nbeen during the periods when the country was a client state of nearby\r\nItaly, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe lack of easily defended national boundaries was an additional\r\nconcern in the maintenance of territorial integrity. Although the\r\nboundaries originally established in 1913 remained relatively unchanged\r\nand were not officially disputed in 1970, they were not considered\r\nsatisfactory in some sectors. About 1 million Albanians lived in\r\nadjacent areas of Yugoslavia, mostly in the Kosovo region, and Albania\r\nrevealed her dissatisfaction that they were not included within its\r\nterritory. Neither Albania nor Greece was content with the demarcation\r\nalong the two most southerly districts of Albania. The lack of sharply\r\ndefined terrain features in most places along the northern and eastern\r\nborders with Yugoslavia and the southeastern and southern delineation\r\nbetween Albania and Greece increased the potential for dispute (see ch.\r\n2, Historical Setting; ch. 3, Physical Environment).\r\n\r\nThe topography of the land is generally rugged, and access to inland\r\nareas is difficult. Except for the narrow strip of lowlands along the\r\nAdriatic coast, the country is made up of mountains and hills,\r\nintermittently intersected by streams that flow in a generally westerly\r\nor northwesterly direction. Valleys in the hinterland are narrow, and\r\nslopes of mountains and hills tend to be steep (see ch. 3, Physical\r\nEnvironment).\r\n\r\nConsidering Albania's small area, climatic conditions are quite varied.\r\nAlong the coastal lowlands Mediterranean-type weather prevails. In the\r\ninterior there are rapid fluctuations in many areas, but continental\r\ninfluences predominate. Despite annual precipitation ranging from 40 to\r\n100 inches, droughts are common because rainfall is unevenly distributed\r\n(see ch. 3, Physical Environment).\r\n\r\nFew places offer good conditions for large-scale settlement. Localities\r\nwith good soil and a dependable water supply are small and scattered.\r\nThe coastal lowlands, inundated or desert-like according to the season,\r\nare lightly populated. The region generally bounded by Durres, Tirana,\r\nElbasan, and Fier grew most rapidly and had the highest population\r\ndensity in the late 1960s. Inland, the mountain and upland basins offer\r\nthe best conditions for settlement (see ch. 3, Physical Environment; ch.\r\n4, The People).\r\n\r\nThe extensive networks of rivers are of little value for transportation\r\nbecause waterflow fluctuates, currents tend to be violent, and\r\nestuaries are heavily sedimented. Road and railroad construction is\r\ndifficult because of the uneven character of the terrain. Improved land\r\ntransportation routes are exceedingly limited. Mountain homesteads and\r\nvillages frequently have only a footpath to connect them with the\r\noutside world. The lack of communications routes results in isolation\r\nfor many areas and helps to place Albania on a byway of international\r\ntravel (see ch. 3, Physical Environment; ch. 4, The People).\r\n\r\nRemote and isolated areas had a significant influence in shaping\r\nAlbanian society. During the long period of Turkish rule they provided\r\nsanctuaries for the preservation of ethnic identity. After 1912 the\r\npeople in these areas were the primary residuary for antiquated customs\r\nand attitudes. Communist leaders made a major effort in the 1960s to\r\neliminate old customs and other vestiges of the past that detracted from\r\nthe collectivization and modernization of society. Comments of high\r\nofficials in early 1970 indicated that their efforts still had not been\r\nentirely successful (see ch. 2, Historical Setting; ch. 4, The People).\r\n\r\nThe Albanians are descendants of the Illyrians, an Indo-European people\r\nwho lived in the Balkans in antiquity. Their history before the eleventh\r\ncentury is linked with, and not easily separated from, that of the other\r\nIllyrian tribes. The written language did not develop until the\r\nfifteenth century, and then for more than four centuries under Turkish\r\nrule it was forbidden. Although Albanians distinguished themselves as\r\nsoldiers under Turkish suzerainty and some held high office in the\r\nOttoman ruling hierarchy, they were little known as a people before the\r\nnineteenth century. As members of clans or feudal estates they lived an\r\noutmoded life style and were relatively untouched by the forces of\r\nindustrialization and democratization that changed much of western and\r\nsouthern Europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see ch.\r\n2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nFor centuries after the death in 1468 of Skanderbeg, the Albanian\r\nnational hero and symbol of resistance to Turkish rule, many Albanian\r\nmountain communities lived unto themselves. Local control rested with\r\n_pashas_ and _beys_, and some became virtually independent of Turkish\r\nrule. About two-thirds of the people accepted, or were forcibly\r\nconverted to, the Muslim faith under the Turks. Since eligibility to\r\nparticipate in political life rested on religious affiliation, some\r\nAlbanians thus became a part of the ruling hierarchy of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, but the masses were indifferent politically. Activities or\r\nattitudes that would tend to strengthen nationalism were suppressed.\r\nWhen considered in its entirety the heritage from Ottoman rule\r\ncontributed almost nothing toward the development of capabilities\r\nrequired for a viable government and a modernized society (see ch. 2,\r\nHistorical Setting).\r\n\r\nKinship, customs, and attitudes related to family life, and strong\r\nattachments to community and language were strong influences in the\r\npreservation of ethnic identity through the many centuries of foreign\r\ndomination. The Albanians are divided into two major subgroups--the\r\nGegs, who occupy the area north of the Shkumbin River, and the Tosks,\r\nwho inhabit the territory to the south. Differences in physical\r\nappearance persist, but the breakup of clans and moves toward\r\ncollectivization of society after World War II diminished the most\r\ndistinguishing feature, their social system. Antiquated customs and\r\nblood feuds that were frequently initiated by offenses against women\r\nwere more prevalent among the Gegs than the Tosks before the Communist\r\ntakeover (see ch. 4, The People).\r\n\r\nThe family continued to be a strong social force in 1970. It was the\r\nprimary residuary of customs, practices, and attitudes that detracted\r\nfrom Communist programs to create a monolithic and modernized society.\r\nOlder persons, particularly males, who traditionally held positions of\r\nauthority in the family, were considered to be the strongest force\r\nagainst change. In their efforts to eliminate outmoded customs, Party\r\nand government leaders placed special emphasis on youth and women, the\r\nlatter having suffered much discrimination under the clan system. Large\r\nextended families, which sometimes numbered sixty or more persons and\r\nincluded several generations, were in most cases broken up under\r\nCommunist rule as a means to decrease family influence (see ch. 5,\r\nSocial System).\r\n\r\nParty leaders, realizing the importance of education in developing\r\nattitudes and loyalties favorable to communism and in training the work\r\nforce required for a modern industrial economy, placed heavy emphasis on\r\nschool programs. By 1970 the level of schooling completed by the people\r\nhad been significantly increased over the 1946 level, but the pool of\r\nscientific and skilled personnel fell far short of requirements (see ch.\r\n5, Social System).\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy improvement in the people's welfare, as reflected by\r\nAlbanian data, was in the area of health. The incidence of disease was\r\ngreatly reduced; the death rate decreased; and life expectancy increased\r\nby approximately 12.5 years between 1950 and 1966 (see ch. 4, The\r\nPeople).\r\n\r\nAlbanian art, literature, and music have gained little recognition among\r\nworld cultures. After 1944 the Communist regime instituted mass\r\nparticipation in education and social and cultural activities to instill\r\nideals of socialism and Communist morality and gain the capabilities\r\nrequired for modernization of the economy. Illiteracy, once prevalent\r\namong all age groups, was reportedly eliminated among persons under the\r\nage of forty and some, but not nearly all, of the skilled work force\r\nrequired has been produced. Despite these efforts Albania's cultural\r\nheritage was still meager in the late 1960s (see ch. 5, Social System;\r\nch. 7, Communications and Cultural Development).\r\n\r\nAlbanians as individuals tended to take religion lightly, and the\r\nMuslim, Eastern Orthodox, and Roman Catholic religions that had been\r\nbrought by conquerors did not play major roles in shaping national\r\ntraditions or in strengthening national unity. In 1967, after the\r\ngovernment's withdrawal of approval for religious bodies to function, an\r\naccelerated campaign was undertaken to eradicate religious thoughts and\r\nbeliefs. The fact that the campaign was continuing in early 1970\r\nindicated that it had not entirely succeeded (see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nThe major economic objective is to develop a modern economy with a\r\nstrong industrial base. Before World War II there was practically no\r\nindustry, and the system of agriculture was primitive and inefficient.\r\nSubstantial aid from the Soviet Union during the 1950s resulted in\r\nmodest growth of the economy, with rapid rates of industrial growth and\r\nimprovements in education and health. Chinese aid on a lesser scale and\r\nheavy sacrifices by the masses sustained the growth trend in industry\r\nduring the 1960s but at a slower pace.\r\n\r\nThe major source of national income changed from agriculture to industry\r\nduring the early 1960s, but the country was still by all appearances\r\npredominantly rural and agricultural. Two-thirds of the people lived in\r\nrural areas, and more than half were engaged in agriculture.\r\nSocialization of the economy, which began in 1944, was completed in the\r\nlate 1960s. The model of planning borrowed from the Soviet Union that\r\nwas adopted in the late 1940s continued in use with only slight\r\nmodifications. The trend was toward greater centralization and\r\ngovernmental control (see ch. 8, Economic System).\r\n\r\nThe provision of adequate and proper food, clothing, and housing was a\r\nconstant major problem. Little improvement was made in the standard of\r\nliving between 1950 and 1970, largely because of sustained rapid\r\npopulation growth and priority to the means of production sector of\r\nindustry in the allocation of resources (see ch. 4, The People; ch. 8,\r\nEconomic System).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL SETTING\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical works and official documents published in Tirana as late as\r\n1970 stressed two major themes: the importance of patriotism and\r\nnationalism and the achievements, real or fancied, of the Communist\r\nregime since it assumed control of the country in November 1944. The\r\nappeal to nationalism always strikes a responsive chord among the\r\nAlbanians not only because their history is replete with humiliations\r\nand injustices heaped upon them by long domination of foreign powers but\r\nalso, and especially, because of the territorial aspirations and claims\r\nof its neighbors--Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The political scene in\r\nAlbania since it formally won an independent existence from Turkey in\r\n1912 has indeed been dominated by attempts of one, or a combination, of\r\nits neighbors to dismember it.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of Albania in 1970 were essentially the same as those\r\ndelineated by representatives of the Great Powers after Albania had\r\ndeclared its independence. Ethnic problems raised by the drawing of the\r\nboundaries have never been solved to the satisfaction of the countries\r\ninvolved. The Albanians hold that in 1913 about 40 percent of their\r\nterritory, with a population at that time of about 600,000 ethnic\r\nAlbanians, was unjustly assigned to Serbia. The area has been a\r\ncontinuing source of friction between Albania and Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nA source of tension between Albania and Greece has been the status of\r\nAlbania's two southernmost districts. Known to the Greeks as Northern\r\nEpirus, this region was awarded to Albania by the boundary delineations\r\nof 1913, but the Greeks have never relinquished their claims to the\r\narea.\r\n\r\nItaly, located only about forty-five miles across the narrow Strait of\r\nOtranto, has attempted on several occasions to impose its hegemony over\r\nAlbania. The extreme influence exercised on Albanian affairs by Italy\r\nbetween 1925 and 1939 that culminated in a military invasion in April of\r\n1939 has been a source of great resentment by the Albanian people.\r\n\r\nThe Communist Party of Albania assumed control of the country in 1944.\r\nThe fact that the Communist regime installed itself in the capital city\r\nof Tirana on November 28, Albania's traditional Independence Day, was\r\nan indication that originally it did not intend to cut off all ties with\r\nthe past, although its declared intention was to create a new social\r\norder. A year later, however, on November 29, the regime proclaimed a\r\nnew national holiday, which it called Liberation Day. Until about 1960\r\nthe traditional Independence Day was mentioned only in passing, whereas\r\nLiberation Day was celebrated with considerable publicity.\r\n\r\nA basic change of attitude, however, occurred when the regime broke with\r\nthe Soviet Union in the 1960-61 period. The ruling elite, apparently\r\nfeeling insecure both for their personal safety and for the future of\r\nthe country, launched an intensive campaign to win popular support by\r\nappealing to the people's nationalist and patriotic sentiments. The\r\ncountry's major patriots who were responsible for the national awakening\r\nin the second half of the nineteenth and the early part of the twentieth\r\ncenturies had been forgotten after the Communist seizure of power. In\r\n1961 and 1962, however, books and pamphlets began to be published\r\npraising nearly all those, irrespective of their social backgrounds, who\r\nhad played a role in the national awakening and in the declaration of\r\nthe country's independence in 1912.\r\n\r\nIntensive preparations were made in 1962 to celebrate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the country's independence, and on November 28, 1962, all\r\nthe top leaders of the party and government went to Vlore, where\r\nindependence had been declared, to stage one of the biggest patriotic\r\ncelebrations in the country's modern history. Among the many books and\r\ndocuments published on this occasion to glorify the country's past was\r\none entitled _Rilindja Kombetare Shqipetare_ (Albanian National\r\nAwakening), which included photographs of most patriots who had taken\r\npart in winning the country's independence, even those of the landed\r\naristocracy (_beys_--see Glossary), whom the regime had previously\r\nbranded as the \"blood-suckers\" of the peasants.\r\n\r\nThis appeal to the past was also accentuated in 1968 in connection with\r\nthe 500th anniversary of the death of the country's national hero,\r\nSkanderbeg. The regime sent a number of scholars and historians to\r\nsearch for historical documents in Vienna and Rome in preparation for\r\nthe celebration.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these efforts to resurrect the past after a hiatus\r\nof fifteen years, the primary function of the country's historians, all\r\nunder the control of the Party, is to glorify the country's achievements\r\nin the period under communism. The Party is given credit for all that\r\nhas been done in the economic development of the country, in\r\nimprovements in the people's health, and in expansion of educational and\r\ncultural facilities, all of which have been considerable. In 1970 Enver\r\nHoxha, first secretary of the Party, like Stalin in his day and Mao\r\nTse-tung in 1970, was daily quoted and glorified.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY AND THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\nThe modern Albanians call their country Shqiperia and themselves\r\nShqipetare. In antiquity the Albanians were known as Illyrians, and in\r\nthe Middle Ages they came to be called Arbereshe or Arbeneshe, and their\r\ncountry Arberia or Arbenia. The present European forms, Albania and\r\nAlbanians, are derived from the names Arbanoi and Albanoi or Arbaniti,\r\nwhich appeared in the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nIn antiquity the Albanians formed part of the Thraco-Illyrian and Epirot\r\ntribes that inhabited the whole of the peninsula between the Danube\r\nRiver and the Aegean Sea. Until 168 B.C. the northern and central part\r\nof present-day Albania comprised parts of the Kingdom of Illyria, whose\r\ncapital was Shkoder. The Illyrian Kingdom was conquered by the Romans in\r\n168-167 B.C., and thereafter it was a Roman colony until A.D. 395, when\r\nthe Roman Empire was split into East and West, Albania becoming part of\r\nthe Byzantine Empire.\r\n\r\nUnder the Roman Empire, Albania served as a key recruiting area for the\r\nRoman legions and a main outlet to the East. The present port of Durres\r\n(the ancient Durrachium) became the western terminum of Via Egnatia, an\r\nactual extension of Via Appia, by which the Roman legions marched to the\r\nEast. It was during the Roman rule that Christianity was introduced into\r\nAlbania.\r\n\r\nFrom the fifth century to the advent of the Ottoman Turks in the Balkans\r\nin the fourteenth century, invasions from the north and east, especially\r\nby the Huns, the Bulgarians, and the Slavs, thinned the indigenous\r\nIllyrian population and drove it along the mountainous Adriatic coastal\r\nregions. During the crusades in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,\r\nAlbania became a thoroughfare for the crusading armies, which used the\r\nport of Durres as a bridgehead. By this time the Venetian Republic had\r\nobtained commercial privileges in Albanian towns and, after the Fourth\r\nCrusade (1204), it received nominal control over Albania and Epirus and\r\ntook actual possession of Durres and the surrounding areas. In the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century Albania fell under the domination of\r\nthe kings of Naples, and in 1272 armies of Charles I of Anjou crossed\r\nthe Adriatic and occupied Durres. Thereupon, Charles I issued a decree\r\ncalling himself Rex Albaniae and creating Regnum Albaniae (the Kingdom\r\nof Albania), which lasted for nearly a century.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTTOMAN TURK RULE\r\n\r\nIn the period after the defeat of the Serbs by the Ottoman Turks in 1389\r\nin the battle of Kosovo, most of Albania was divided into a number of\r\nprincipalities under the control of native tribal chieftains, most of\r\nwhom were subsequently forced into submission by the invading Turks.\r\nSome of these chieftains, however, were allowed their independence under\r\nTurkish suzerainty. One of the most noted of these was John Kastrioti of\r\nKruje, a region northeast of Tirana, whose four sons were taken hostage\r\nby the sultan to be trained in the Ottoman service. The youngest of\r\nthese, Gjergj, was destined to win fame throughout Europe and to be\r\nimmortalized as the national hero of his country. Gjergj (b. 1403) soon\r\nwon the sultan's favor, distinguished himself in the Turkish army,\r\nconverted to Islam, and was bestowed the title of Skander Bey (Lord\r\nAlexander), which, in Albanian, became Skanderbeg or Skenderbey.\r\n\r\nIn 1443 Hungarian King Hunyadi routed at Nish the sultan's armies, in\r\nwhich Skanderbeg held command; Skanderbeg fled to his native land and\r\nseized from the Turks his father's fortress at Kruje. His defection and\r\nreconversion to Christianity and the creation in 1444 of the League of\r\nAlbanian Princes, with himself as its head, enraged the Ottomans, who\r\nbegan a series of intense campaigns that lasted until Skanderbeg's\r\nnatural death in 1468. In his wars against the Turks, Skanderbeg was\r\naided by the kings of Naples and the popes, one of whom, Pope Nicholas\r\nV, named him Champion of Christendom.\r\n\r\nSkanderbeg's death did not end Albania's resistance to the Turks;\r\nhowever, they gradually extended their conquests in Albania and in time\r\ndefeated both the local chieftains and the Venetians, who controlled\r\nsome of the coastal towns. The Turkish occupation of the country\r\nresulted in a great exodus of Albanians to southern Italy and Sicily,\r\nwhere they preserved their language, customs, and Eastern Orthodox\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant consequences of Ottoman rule of Albania was\r\nthe conversion to Islam of over two-thirds of the population. As the\r\npolitical and economic basis of the Ottoman Empire was not nationality\r\nbut religion, this conversion created a new group of Muslim Albanian\r\nbureaucrats, who not only ruled Albanian provinces for the sultans but\r\nalso served in important posts as _pashas_ (governors) in many parts of\r\nthe empire. A number of them became _viziers_ (prime ministers), and\r\none, Mehmet Ali Pasha, at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nfounded an Egyptian dynasty that lasted until the 1950s.\r\n\r\nSome of the Albanian beys and pashas, especially in the lowlands, became\r\nalmost independent rulers of their principalities. One of these, Ali\r\nPasha Tepelena, known in history as the Lion of Yannina, whose\r\nprincipality at the beginning of the nineteenth century consisted of the\r\nwhole area from the Gulf of Arta to Montenegro. By 1803 he had assumed\r\nabsolute power and negotiated directly with Napoleon and the rulers of\r\nGreat Britain and Russia. The sultan, however, becoming alarmed at the\r\ndamage Ali Pasha was doing to the unity of the empire, sent his armies\r\nto surround him in Yannina, where he was captured and decapitated in\r\n1822.\r\n\r\nUnder the Turks, Albania remained in complete stagnation and, when the\r\nTurks were expelled from the Balkans in 1912, they left it in about the\r\nsame condition as they had found it. The Albanian highlanders,\r\nespecially in the north, were never fully subjected, and their tribal\r\norganizations were left intact. Turkish suzerainty affected them only to\r\nthe extent that it isolated them from the world. Thus, they preserved\r\ntheir medieval laws, traditions, and customs. As a result, Western\r\ncivilization and development did not begin to penetrate Albania in any\r\nmeaningful way until it became independent in 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL AWAKENING AND INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nThe Albanian national awakening made rapid strides after the Treaty of\r\nSan Stefano in 1877, imposed on Turkey by the Russians, gave the Balkan\r\nSlavic nations large parts of Albania. The Western powers, refusing to\r\naccept Russia's diktat on Turkey, met in Berlin the following year to\r\nconsider revision of the Treaty of San Stefano. Albanian leaders in the\r\nmeantime convened at Prizren and founded the League for the Defense of\r\nthe Rights of the Albanian Nation. Although the league was unable to\r\nbring sufficient pressure on the Congress of Berlin to save Albania from\r\nserious dismemberment, it set in motion a political movement that had\r\ntremendous influence on Albanian nationalist activity for decades to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nMost of the league leaders held high positions in, or were influential\r\nmembers of, the ruling Turkish elite and were fully aware of the shaky\r\nposition of the Ottoman Empire; they therefore demanded from the Turks\r\nadministrative and cultural autonomy for all Albanian lands united in a\r\nprincipality. The Turkish government refused and in 1881 forced the\r\ndissolution of the league. Meanwhile, Russia, Italy, and Austria-Hungary\r\nbegan to take an active interest in Albania. Russia aimed at blocking\r\nexpansion of Austrian influence in the Balkans and supported the\r\nterritorial demands of Serbia and Montenegro. Italy and\r\nAustria-Hungary, on the other hand, concerned over Russia's influence\r\nextending to the Adriatic, attempted to influence developments in\r\nAlbania.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Young Turks regime (1908), in whose establishment\r\nAlbanian officials in the service of the empire played a major role,\r\nencouraged the Albanians to found cultural and political clubs for the\r\npropagation of Albanian culture and the defense of Albanian rights. In\r\n1908 a congress of intellectuals from all parts of Albania and the\r\nAlbanian colonies abroad, especially the Italo-Albanian colonies in\r\nItaly, convened in Monastir (Bitolj) to decide on an Albanian alphabet;\r\nit adopted the Latin one as most suitable for the country. This decision\r\nmarked a great advance toward Albanian unification and eventual\r\nstatehood.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and fall of 1912, while Serbia, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and\r\nGreece, prodded by Russia, were waging war against Turkey, the Albanians\r\nstaged a series of revolts and began to agitate for the creation of an\r\nautonomous and neutral Albania. Accordingly, a group of Albanian\r\npatriots, led by Ismail Qemal bey Vlora, a member of the Turkish\r\nParliament, proclaimed Albania's independence at Vlore on November 28,\r\n1912, and organized an Albanian provisional government. Supported by\r\nAustria and Italy, Albania's independence was recognized on December 12,\r\n1912, by the London Conference of Ambassadors, but its boundaries were\r\nto be determined later. In March 1913 agreement was reached on the\r\nnorthern frontiers, assigning Shkoder to Albania but giving Kosovo and\r\nMetohija (Kosmet), inhabited then chiefly by Albanians, to Serbia. This\r\nfrontier demarcation was very similar to the frontiers between\r\nYugoslavia and Albania as they existed in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries in the south were more difficult to delineate because\r\nGreece laid claim to most of southern Albania, which the Greeks call\r\nNorthern Epirus. The Conference of Ambassadors appointed a special\r\ncommission to draw the demarcation line on ethnographic bases and in\r\nDecember 1913 drafted the Protocol of Florence, which assigned the\r\nregion to Albania. The 1913 boundaries in the south, like those in the\r\nnorth, were almost the same as those that existed between Greece and\r\nAlbania in 1970. The Albania that emerged from the Conference of\r\nAmbassadors was a truncated one; as many Albanians were left out of the\r\nnew state as were included in it.\r\n\r\nThe Conference of Ambassadors also drafted a constitution for the new\r\nstate, which was proclaimed as an autonomous principality, sovereign,\r\nand under the guarantees of the Great Powers; created an International\r\nControl Commission to control the country's administration and budget;\r\nand selected as ruler the German Prince Wilhelm zu Wied. Prince Wied\r\narrived in March 1914 but had to flee the country six months later\r\nbecause of the outbreak of World War I and the difficulties caused by\r\nthe unruly feudal beys. As a consequence, Albania's independence came to\r\nan end, and for the next four years the country served as a battleground\r\nfor the warring powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATION OF MODERN ALBANIA\r\n\r\nAt the end of World War I Albania was occupied by the Allied armies,\r\nmostly Italian and French. The Secret Treaty of London, concluded in\r\n1915 and published by the Russian Bolsheviks after the October 1917\r\nRevolution, provided for the partition of nearly all Albania among\r\nItaly, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. Another accord, known as the\r\nTittoni-Venizelos Agreement, concluded between Italy and Greece in 1919,\r\nalso called for the dismemberment of Albania. At the 1919-20 Paris Peace\r\nConference Greece laid claim to southern Albania; Serbia and Montenegro,\r\nto the northern part; and Italy, to the port of Vlore and surrounding\r\nareas. But President Woodrow Wilson's principle of self-determination\r\nand his personal insistence on the restoration of an independent Albania\r\nsaved the country from partition. In the summer of 1920 an Albanian\r\npartisan army drove the Italians from Vlore, and the Italian government\r\nrecognized Albania's independence.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in January 1920 a congress of representatives met in\r\nLushnje, in central Albania, and created a government and a Council of\r\nRegency composed of representatives of the four religious denominations\r\nprevailing in Albania: the two Muslim sects (Sunni and Bektashi), Roman\r\nCatholic, and Eastern Orthodox (see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nFrom 1920 to 1924 there was political freedom in the country along with\r\nextreme political strife. A group of statesmen and politicians, mostly\r\nfrom the old Turkish bureaucracy, attempted to lay the foundation of a\r\nmodern state, but there was a bitter struggle between the old\r\nconservative landlords and Western educated or inspired liberals. The\r\nlandowners, led by Ahmet Zogu, advocated the continuance of feudal\r\ntenure and opposed social and economic reforms, especially agrarian\r\nreforms. The liberals, led by Bishop Fan S. Noli, a Harvard University\r\ngraduate who had founded the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in\r\nBoston in 1908 and had returned to Albania in 1920, favored the\r\nestablishment of a Western-type democracy. The country was torn by\r\npolitical struggles and rapid changes of government revealed\r\nconsiderable political instability.\r\n\r\nIn June 1924 the liberals staged a successful coup against the\r\nconservative landlords, forcing their leader, Ahmet Zogu, to flee to\r\nYugoslavia, and formed a new government under Bishop Noli. But Noli was\r\ntoo radical to command the support of the disparate coalition that had\r\nousted Zogu. Internally he proposed radical agrarian reforms, the\r\npurging and reduction of the bureaucracy, and the establishment of a\r\ntruly democratic regime. In foreign affairs he extended recognition to\r\nthe Soviet Union, a move that alienated some of his supporters at home\r\nand alarmed some neighboring states. As a consequence, Zogu, having\r\nsecured foreign support, led an army from Yugoslavia and in December\r\n1924 entered the capital city of Tirana and became ruler of the country.\r\nBishop Noli and his closest supporters fled abroad; some eventually went\r\nto Moscow, and others fell under Communist influence in Western\r\ncapitals.\r\n\r\nZogu's rule in the 1925-39 period, first as President Zogu and after\r\nSeptember I, 1928, as Zog I, king of the Albanians, brought political\r\nstability and developed a national political consciousness that had been\r\nunprecedented in Albanian history. To secure his position both\r\ninternally and externally, he concluded in 1926 and 1927 bilateral\r\ntreaties with Italy, providing for mutual support in maintaining the\r\nterritorial status quo and establishing a defensive alliance between the\r\ntwo countries. These two treaties, however, assured Italian penetration\r\nof Albania, particularly in the military and economic spheres.\r\n\r\nKing Zog ruled as a moderate dictator, his monarchy being a combination\r\nof despotism and reform. He prohibited political parties but was lenient\r\nto his opponents unless they actually threatened to overthrow his rule,\r\nas happened in 1932, 1935, and 1937. But even during these open revolts,\r\nhe showed a good deal of leniency and executed only a few ringleaders.\r\nHe effected some substantial reforms both in the administration and in\r\nsociety, particularly outlawing the traditional vendetta and carrying of\r\narms, of which the Albanians were very fond. The most significant\r\ncontribution of Zog's fourteen-year rule, the longest since the time of\r\nSkanderbeg, was the development of a truly national consciousness and an\r\nidentity of the people with the state, although not necessarily with the\r\nmonarchy, and the gradual breakdown of the traditional tribal and clan\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nIn April 1938 Zog married Geraldine Apponyi, a Hungarian countess with\r\nan American mother. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano was the best\r\nman. On Ciano's return to Italy from the wedding, he proposed to his\r\nfather-in-law, Benito Mussolini, Fascist dictator of Italy, the\r\nannexation of Albania. The following year, on April 7, 1939, Ciano's\r\nsuggestion was consummated. Italian forces invaded Albania on that day,\r\nforcing Zog to flee the country, never to return. In the next few months\r\nrapid steps were taken to unite Albania with Italy under the crown of\r\nKing Victor Emanuel III and to impose a regime similar to that of\r\nFascist Italy. Albania as an independent state disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNIST SEIZURE AND CONSOLIDATION OF POWER\r\n\r\nResistance to the Italian invaders began soon after the invasion, but\r\nthe few insignificant Communist groups that existed at that time did not\r\njoin the fray until after Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, attacked the\r\nSoviet Union in June 1941. These Communist groups, acting generally\r\nindependently of each other, were composed chiefly of young\r\nintellectuals who had revolted against the country's medieval society.\r\nEducated mostly in the West, they felt that their country's economic\r\ndevelopment and their desire to use their Western education for their\r\nown and their country's advancement were frustrated by Zog's concept of\r\npersonal rule, by the hostility of traditional chieftains and _beys_,\r\nand by the lack of opportunities in the country's underdeveloped society\r\nand economy.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of these disparate groups convened clandestinely in Tirana\r\non November 8, 1941, and under the guidance of two emissaries from the\r\nYugoslav Communist Party, Dusan Mugosha and Miladin Popovic, founded the\r\nAlbanian Communist Party--known since 1948 as the Albanian Workers'\r\nParty. Enver Hoxha, a young schoolteacher who had studied in France and\r\nBelgium, was elected provisional and, subsequently, permanent secretary\r\ngeneral. In 1970 he still held the same position, under the title of\r\nfirst secretary. From the outset the strategy of the Party was to\r\nconceal its true Marxist program and orientation and to stress\r\nnationalism and patriotism. To this end, the front technique, through\r\nthe National Liberation Movement, was used.\r\n\r\nThe National Liberation Movement was created by the Conference of Peze\r\nthat was convened, also clandestinely, on September 16, 1942, for the\r\npurpose of creating a militant organization to coordinate and intensify\r\nthe activities of a number of guerrilla bands then active against the\r\nItalian occupiers. It was sponsored by the Party and attended by the\r\nParty leaders, who at that time paraded as patriots and vehemently\r\ndenied in public that they were Communists, and by a number of\r\nnationalist resistance chieftains. The National Liberation Movement was\r\ndominated from the beginning by the Communists, as were its military\r\nformations, known as partisans.\r\n\r\nThe movement was further strengthened in July 1943 at the Conference of\r\nLabinot, when the General Staff of the Army of National Liberation of\r\nAlbania was created, with Enver Hoxha as chief commissar. Thereafter,\r\nunder the guise of the National Liberation Movement, the Communist\r\nleaders devoted all their energies to obtaining complete control of the\r\npartisan formations and to preparing the ground for a seizure of power\r\nas soon as the Axis powers should be defeated. Their prime objectives in\r\nthe 1943-44 years were to immobilize the nationalist elements who were\r\nstill in the movement by surrounding them with loyal commissars and, at\r\nthe same time, to try to annihilate other nationalist groups that had\r\nrefused from the outset to collaborate with the movement. There was a\r\nfull-scale civil war in the country from September 1943 to November\r\n1944.\r\n\r\nThe civil war was fought between the partisan formations and the two\r\nprincipal anti-Communist organizations--Balli Kombetar (National Front)\r\nand the Legality Movement. The Balli Kombetar emerged as an organization\r\nsoon after the National Liberation Movement was founded; it was led by\r\nMidhat Frasheri, a veteran patriot who had formed a clandestine\r\nresistance movement during the early days of Italian occupation. The\r\nBalli Kombetar extolled the principles of freedom and social justice and\r\nchampioned the objective of an ethnic Albania; that is, the retention of\r\nthe Yugoslav provinces of Kosovo and Metohija, which the Italians had\r\nannexed to Albania in 1941. For some time it made efforts to collaborate\r\nwith the National Liberation Movement, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nIn July and August 1943 representatives of the two movements finally met\r\nat Mukaj, a village near Tirana, to try to work out an agreement of\r\ncollaboration against the Axis forces. The chief obstacle to an accord\r\nwas the disposition of Kosmet. The Balli Kombetar refused to consider\r\ncollaboration unless the movement joined in the demand that Kosmet\r\nremain a part of Albania after the war. Finally an agreement was reached\r\nfor collaboration, with the provision that the question of Kosmet be\r\nresolved after the war.\r\n\r\nThe emissaries of the Yugoslav Communist Party interpreted the agreement\r\nas a victory for the nationalists and demanded that the Albanian\r\nCommunist Party not only denounce the agreement but also launch a\r\nfull-scale attack on the Balli Kombetar. The Albanian Communists bowed\r\nto this demand and, in September 1943, launched the attack against Balli\r\nKombetar and subsequently against the Legality Movement. This movement\r\nwas founded in November 1943 by Abas Kupi, who until August 1943 had\r\nbeen a member of the Central Council of the National Liberation Movement\r\nbut broke away from it after the Mukaj agreement was denounced.\r\n\r\nIn May 1944 the National Liberation Front, as the movement was by then\r\ncalled, sponsored the Congress of Permet for the purpose of creating the\r\nnecessary machinery to seize power. The Congress appointed Hoxha\r\ncommander in chief of the Army of National Liberation and elected the\r\nAlbanian Anti-Fascist Liberation Council, which in turn created the\r\nAlbanian Anti-Fascist Committee, under the presidency of Hoxha, as the\r\nexecutive branch of the council. The Congress of Berat, convened by the\r\nfront in October of the same year, converted the committee into a\r\ncoalition provisional \"democratic\" government, which in the following\r\nmonth seized control of the whole country and on November 28, Albania's\r\ntraditional Independence Day, installed itself in Tirana.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the 1943-44 civil war in Albania followed a course\r\nsimilar to that which took place between the partisan forces (Communist)\r\nof Josip Broz (Tito) and General Mihailovich's Chetniks (loyalist) in\r\nYugoslavia. The Communist operations and final seizure of power in\r\nYugoslavia played a major role in the Communist takeover in Albania.\r\nAlbania was the only European Communist country that was freed from the\r\nAxis invaders without the actual presence of Soviet forces and without\r\ndirect military assistance from the Soviet Union. Political direction\r\nwas supplied by the emissaries of the Yugoslav Communist Party attached\r\npermanently to the Albanian Communist Party after its founding in 1941.\r\nThe Anglo-American command in Italy supplied most of the war material to\r\nthe Albanian partisan forces.\r\n\r\nAlbania's future was never specifically discussed by the Big\r\nThree--Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States--at either\r\nthe Teheran or the Yalta conferences. Nor did Albania figure in the\r\ndiscussions in Moscow in October 1944 between Churchill and Stalin, when\r\nthey informally agreed to divide Eastern Europe into spheres of\r\ninfluence, at least for the duration of the war. Accordingly, when the\r\nlast German troops were driven out of Albania, there was a kind of\r\npolitical vacuum that the Communists, with superior political\r\norganizations and substantial armed partisan groups, were able to fill.\r\n\r\nIn August 1945 the first congress of the National Liberation Front was\r\nheld, and the name of the organization was changed to the Democratic\r\nFront in an effort to make it more palatable to the public. Contending\r\nthat the Democratic Front represented the majority of the population\r\nbecause all political opinions and groups except Fascists were included\r\nin it, the Communist rulers allowed only Democratic Front Candidates for\r\nthe first postwar national elections held in December 1945.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly elected at this polling was originally\r\ncomposed of both party members and some nationalist elements. The latter\r\napparently continued to feel that cooperation with the Communists was\r\npossible but, within a year after the elections, they were summarily\r\npurged from the Assembly, and subsequently a number of them were tried\r\nand executed on charges of being \"enemies of the people.\" All national\r\nand local elections since 1945 have been held under the aegis of the\r\nDemocratic Front.\r\n\r\nEven after the \"liberation,\" the Party continued its conspiratorial\r\nnature and did not come into the open until the First Party Congress was\r\nheld in November 1948. Before that time all its meetings were held in\r\nclosest secrecy, and no statements, communiques, or resolutions were\r\npublished in its name. The Party thus continued to use the front\r\ntechnique effectively even after it became the undisputed ruler of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUNIST PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly, elected on December 2, 1945, proclaimed on\r\nJanuary 11, 1946, the People's Republic of Albania; and on March 14 it\r\napproved the first Albanian Constitution, based largely on the Yugoslav\r\nCommunist Constitution. In this first Constitution no mention of any\r\nkind was made of the role played by the Party or any other political\r\norganizations. The Constitution was, however, amended after the break\r\nwith Yugoslavia in 1948, and revisions of the Constitution published\r\nsince 1951 have cited in Article 12 the Albanian Workers' Party as the\r\n\"vanguard organization of the working class.\"\r\n\r\nThe Communist regime quickly consolidated its power through a ruthless\r\napplication of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The first measures\r\nwere both political and economic. In the political field a large number\r\nof nationalist leaders who had chosen to remain in the country when the\r\nCommunists seized power rather than flee to the West, as many of them\r\ndid, were arrested, tried as \"war criminals\" or \"enemies of the people,\"\r\nand were either executed or given long-term sentences at hard labor. All\r\nfamilies considered potentially dangerous to the new regime, especially\r\nfamilies of the landed aristocracy and the tribal chieftains, were\r\nherded into concentration or labor camps, in which most of them perished\r\nfrom exposure, malnutrition, and lack of health facilities. Some of\r\nthese camps were still in existence in 1970.\r\n\r\nIn the economic field a special war-profits tax was levied, which\r\namounted to a confiscation of the wealth and private property of the\r\nwell-to-do classes. A large number of those who could not pay the tax,\r\nbecause it was higher than their cash and property assets, were sent to\r\nlabor camps. All industrial plants and mines were nationalized without\r\ncompensation, and a radical agrarian reform law was passed providing for\r\nthe seizure of land belonging to the _beys_ and other large landowners\r\nand its distribution to the landless peasants.\r\n\r\nThe 1944-48 period was characterized by an increase of power and\r\ninfluence of the Yugoslavs over the Party and the government. This in\r\nturn engendered resentment even among some top Party Leaders, who were\r\nkept in check or purged by Koci Xoxe, minister of interior and head of\r\nthe secret police. Backed by the Yugoslavs, he had become the most\r\npowerful man in the Party and government but was tried in the spring of\r\n1949 as a Titoist and executed. By the beginning of 1948 preparations\r\nhad been completed to merge Albania with Yugoslavia, but the plan was\r\nnot consummated because of the Stalin-Tito conflict, which resulted in\r\nTito's expulsion from the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform--see\r\nGlossary) on June 28. 1948.\r\n\r\nThe Stalin-Tito rupture offered Enver Hoxha and his closest colleagues\r\nin the Albanian Party Political Bureau (Politburo) the opportunity to\r\nrid themselves of both their internal enemies, such as Koci Xoxe, and of\r\nYugoslav domination. A few days after the Cominform resolution against\r\nTito, the Albanian rulers expelled all Yugoslav experts and advisers and\r\ndenounced most of the political, military, and economic agreements.\r\nAlbania immediately established close relations with Moscow, although\r\nStalin never signed a mutual assistance pact with Tirana, as he had done\r\nwith all the other European Communist countries. The Party leadership\r\nwas now concentrated in the hands of Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu. Shehu\r\nhad been dismissed in January 1948 as Chief of Staff of the Albanian\r\nPeople's Army, because he had opposed the integration of the Yugoslav\r\nand Albanian armed forces and the stationing of two Yugoslav divisions\r\non Albanian soil. He was rehabilitated immediately after the break with\r\nYugoslavia.\r\n\r\nThe period of direct Soviet influence in Albania began in September\r\n1948, when the first joint economic agreement was signed. After the\r\nestablishment of the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA) in\r\nFebruary 1949, of which Albania became a member, the other Soviet bloc\r\ncountries began to extend economic aid. As a result, an intensified\r\nprogram of economic development began. From 1951 to 1955 industrial and\r\nagricultural production increased rapidly, and the basis was laid for\r\ntransforming Albania from a backward agricultural economy to a more\r\nbalanced agricultural-industrial one.\r\n\r\nThe de-Stalinization campaign in the Soviet Union had serious\r\nrepercussions in the internal situation in Albania. Although Hoxha\r\nvetoed any relaxation of police controls and stamped out any dissenting\r\nvoice within the Party after Stalin's death, by 1956 there was a\r\nsignificant minority in the Party elite that hoped to profit by\r\nde-Stalinization. The opposition reached its peak at a Party conference\r\nin Tirana in April 1956, held in the aftermath of the Soviet Twentieth\r\nParty Congress. Some of the delegates, including Central Committee\r\nmembers, criticized openly the conditions in the Party and requested\r\nthat the topics of discussion be concerned with such topics as the cult\r\nof personality, the rehabilitation of Koci Xoxe and other top Party\r\nleaders purged since 1948, Party democracy, and the people's standard of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nHoxha silenced the dissident elements, however, and had most of them\r\nexpelled from the Party or arrested. Some were subsequently executed.\r\nAmong those executed were Lira Gega, formerly a member of the Politburo,\r\nand her husband, Dalli Ndreu, a general in the Albanian People's Army.\r\nSoviet Premier Khrushchev charged at the Soviet Twenty-second Congress\r\nthat Gega was pregnant when she was executed.\r\n\r\nWorkers' riots in Poland and full-scale revolt in Hungary in late 1956,\r\nfollowed by general uneasiness throughout Communist East Europe, gave\r\nHoxha additional reasons to increase his control over the Party\r\napparatus and to sidestep all pressures from Khrushchev for\r\nreconciliation with Tito. Indeed, in an article published in the\r\nNovember 8, 1956, issue of the Soviet newspaper _Pravda_ (Truth), Hoxha\r\naccused Yugoslavia of being at the root of the Hungarian Revolution and\r\nimplied that the relaxation of internal tensions in some of the\r\nSoviet-bloc countries had endangered the existing regimes. In a speech\r\nto the Party's Central Committee in February 1957 he came openly to the\r\ndefense of Stalin and lashed out against \"those who attempt to discount\r\nthe entire positive revolutionary side of Stalin.\"\r\n\r\nHoxha did, however, pay lip service to the collective leadership\r\nprinciple enunciated in Moscow after Stalin's death. In July 1954 he\r\nrelinquished the premiership to Mehmet Shehu, keeping for himself the\r\nmore important post of first secretary of the Party. But aside from this\r\nhe made no changes in his Stalinist method of rule. He demonstrated this\r\nafter the Party conference in Tirana in April 1956, when he suppressed\r\nruthlessly all those demanding the elimination of personal rule.\r\n\r\nHoxha showed the same determination in the summer of 1961, when\r\nKhrushchev apparently enlisted a number of Albanian leaders, including\r\nTeme Sejko, a rear admiral and commander of the navy who had been\r\ntrained in the Soviet Union to overthrow the Hoxha-Shehu duumvirate and\r\nreplace it with a pro-Moscow group. Sejko and his colleagues were\r\narrested, and he and two others were later executed.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year Hoxha arrested a number of other top Party\r\nleaders who were suspected of pro-Moscow sympathies. Among these were\r\nLiri Belishova, a member of the Politburo, and Koco Tashko, head of the\r\nParty's Auditing Commission; these two were also cited by Khrushchev as\r\nexamples of the alleged reign of terror that prevailed in Albania.\r\n\r\nAfter the break with Moscow, Albania remained nominally a member of both\r\nthe CEMA and the Warsaw Pact. It did not, however, attend any meetings,\r\nand it withdrew officially from the Warsaw Pact after the Soviet\r\ninvasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.\r\n\r\nUnlike Albania's relations with the Communist world, which have been\r\nvaried and fluctuating, those with the Western countries have been, with\r\nminor exceptions, static and rigid, particularly toward the United\r\nStates. Only two major Western powers, France and Italy, initially\r\nrecognized the Communist regime and established diplomatic relations\r\nwith it. Proposals made in November 1945 by the American and British\r\ngovernments to normalize relations with the Tirana regime were never\r\nconsummated, chiefly because of the regime's consistent inimical\r\nattitude toward them.\r\n\r\nThere have been three distinct periods in the history of the country\r\nunder Communist rule. The first, from 1944 to 1948, was characterized by\r\nYugoslav domination. The country's rulers, however, had no difficulty\r\nextricating themselves from this domination once Stalin broke with Tito.\r\n\r\nIn the second period, 1948 to 1961, Soviet predominance was evident\r\neverywhere in the country. All the armed and security forces wore\r\nSoviet-type uniforms. The regime copied much of the Soviet governmental\r\nsystem. The same kind of bureaucracy and the same secret police,\r\nfunctioning with the same supervision as in the Stalinist era in the\r\nSoviet Union, prevailed. In major branches of the government, the\r\nmilitary, and the security forces, there were Soviet advisers and\r\nexperts. The economic and cultural fields were also patterned after\r\nthose of the Soviet Union. But despite this widespread penetration, the\r\nSoviets were in the last analysis unable to impose their will on the\r\nAlbanian rulers, and in 1961 they withdrew completely from that country.\r\n\r\nThe third period, begun in 1961, saw the penetration of Communist\r\nChinese influence in many aspects of political, military, and economic\r\nlife. Like the Yugoslavs and Soviets before them, the Chinese introduced\r\ntheir advisers and experts in various governmental organs and economic\r\nenterprises, and probably in the military and security forces as well,\r\nbut they were there at the invitation of the Albanian regime (see ch. 6,\r\nGovernment Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbania has land borders on the north and east with Yugoslavia and on\r\nthe south and southeast with Greece. Tirana, the capital, is less than\r\nan hour by aircraft from eight other European capitals and barely more\r\nthan two hours from the most distant of them. The coastline is adjacent\r\nto shipping lanes that have been important since early Greek and Roman\r\ntimes. Nevertheless, partly because of its rugged terrain and partly\r\nbecause of its political orientation, the country remains remote and\r\nisolated from its European neighbors (see ch. 6, Government Structure\r\nand Political System).\r\n\r\nThe large expanses of rugged and generally inaccessible terrain provided\r\nrefuge for the Albanian ethnic group and permitted its distinctive\r\nidentity to survive throughout the centuries. Although the country was\r\nalmost always under foreign domination, it was never extensively\r\ncolonized because of the lack of arable land, easily exploitable\r\nresources, and natural inland transportation routes. It has been, and\r\ncontinues to be, poorly developed. Agricultural and pastoral pursuits\r\nhave been the primary means of livelihood, and only after 1950 did\r\nindustry begin to be developed to any appreciable degree.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, the coastal lowlands supported few people and did not\r\nprovide easy access to the interior. The mountains that constitute 70\r\npercent of the country's area are difficult to traverse and generally\r\ninhospitable. Rivers are almost entirely unnavigable, and only in the\r\nsouth are there valleys wide enough to link the coast with the interior.\r\nBy 1970 no railway and only three good roads crossed the national\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nThe physical characteristics of the land have contributed to differing\r\nliving conditions and social relationships in the various sectors of the\r\ncountry. Before independence in 1912, the area of modern Albania had\r\nnever been politically integrated, nor had it ever been an economically\r\nviable unit. It owes its existence as a state to the ethnic factor, and\r\nsurvival of the ethnic group is attributable to the natural isolation of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe area is 11,100 square miles. The boundaries, established in\r\nprinciple in 1913 and demarcated in 1923, were essentially unchanged in\r\n1970, although Greece had not dropped its claim to a large part of\r\nsouthern Albania. The eastern boundary divides the Macedonian lake\r\ndistrict among three states--Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia--that have\r\nethnic populations in the area and follows high mountain ridges wherever\r\npossible to the north and south of the lakes. The northern and southern\r\nborders were drawn to achieve a separation between the Albanians and\r\nneighboring nationalities, although there is a large group of Albanians\r\nin the Kosovo area of Yugoslavia across the northeastern border, and\r\nGreeks and Albanians intermingle in the southeast (see fig. 1).\r\n\r\nResources are insufficient to make the country wealthy, and some that\r\nare available have not been thoroughly exploited. Interior regions have\r\nbeen inaccessible. Agricultural land has been inefficiently used for\r\ncenturies because people having large landholdings preferred to maintain\r\nmore profitable livestock herds rather than cultivate the earth for\r\nfoodstuff production. Malaria, until the 1930s, prevented development or\r\nreclamation of the coastal lowlands. Lacking the capital investment\r\nnecessary, extensive development projects had not been undertaken by\r\n1970.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands and the lower mountains of the south have a Mediterranean\r\nclimate; weather in the northern and eastern highlands is dominated by\r\nthe continental air masses that persist over central and Eastern Europe.\r\nOverall rainfall is plentiful throughout the country, but most areas\r\nreceive it seasonally.\r\n\r\nApart from the bare rock mountains and portions of the alluvial lowlands\r\nthat are alternately parched and inundated, most of the land encourages\r\na wide variety of wild vegetation. Areas suitable for cultivation,\r\nhowever, are small. There are good soils on about 5 percent of the land\r\nsurface, but land three or four times that percentage is considered\r\narable. Forests cover nearly one-half of the land. About one-fourth is\r\nsuitable for grazing animals.\r\n\r\nThe citizen relates closely to the land. Although he has been nationally\r\nindependent for only a few years in the twentieth century and very\r\nseldom earlier, his property has been so difficult to reach that\r\noccupying powers have often left him alone. The land has had beauty that\r\nhas fostered pride and loyalty, and a hardy breed has survived the\r\nconstant struggle to derive an existence from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL REGIONS\r\n\r\nThe 70 percent of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often\r\ninaccessible. The remaining alluvial plain receives its precipitation\r\nseasonally, is poorly drained, is alternately arid or flooded, and much\r\nof it is devoid of fertility. Far from offering a relief from the\r\ndifficult interior terrain, it is often as inhospitable to its\r\ninhabitants as are the mountains. Good soil and dependable precipitation\r\noccur, however, in river basins within the mountains, in the lake\r\ndistrict on the eastern border, and in a narrow band of slightly\r\nelevated land between the coastal plains and the higher interior\r\nmountains (see fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Albanian Alps\r\n\r\nThe mountains of the far north of Albania are an extension of the\r\nDinaric Alpine chain and, more specifically, the Montenegrin limestone\r\n(karst) plateau. They are, however, more folded and rugged than the more\r\ntypical portions of the plateau. The rivers have deep valleys with steep\r\nsides and do not furnish arable valley floors; most of the grazing and\r\nfarming are done on the flatter mountaintops. The rivers provide little\r\naccess into the area and are barriers to communication within it. Roads\r\nare few and poor. Lacking internal communications and external contacts,\r\na tribal society flourished within this Alpine region for centuries.\r\nOnly after World War II were serious efforts made to incorporate the\r\npeople of the region into the remainder of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthern Mountains\r\n\r\nThe extent of the region occupied by the southern mountains is not\r\nsettled to the satisfaction of all authorities. Some include all of the\r\narea in a large diamond shape roughly encompassing all the uplands of\r\nsouthern Albania beneath lines connecting Vlore, Elbasan, and Korce.\r\nAlthough this area has trend lines of the same type and orientation, it\r\nincludes mountains that are associated more closely with the systems in\r\nthe central part of the country. Other authorities confine the area to\r\nthe mountains that are east of Vlore and south of the Vijose River.\r\nThese have features generally common to southern Albania and the\r\nadjacent Greek Epirus. This demarcation is considered preferable because\r\nit more nearly defined a traditional area that tends to lose some of the\r\nmore purely national character of the lands north of it.\r\n\r\nThe southern ranges revert again to the northwest to southeast trend\r\nlines characteristic of the Dinaric Alps. They are, however, more gentle\r\nand accessible than the serpentine zone, the eastern highlands, or the\r\nNorth Albanian Alps. Transition to the lowlands is less abrupt, and\r\narable valley floors are wider. Limestone is predominant, contributing\r\nto the cliffs and clear water along the Albanian Riviera. An\r\nintermixture of softer rocks has eroded and become the basis for the\r\nsedimentation that has resulted in wider valleys between the ridges than\r\nare common in the remainder of the country. This terrain encouraged the\r\ndevelopment of larger landholdings, thus influencing the social\r\nstructure of the area (see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Source: Adapted from Norman J. G. Pounds, _Eastern\r\nEurope_, Chicago, 1969, p. 824.\r\n\r\n_Figure 2. Landform Regions in Albania_]\r\n\r\n\r\nLowlands\r\n\r\nA low coastal belt extends from the northern boundary southward to about\r\nVlore. It averages less than ten miles deep but widens to about thirty\r\nmiles in the Elbasan area. In its natural state it is characterized by\r\nlow scrub vegetation, varying from barren to dense. There are large\r\nareas of marshland and other areas of bare eroded badlands. Where\r\nelevations rise slightly and precipitation is regular--in the foothills\r\nof the central uplands, for example--the land is excellent. Marginal\r\nland is being reclaimed wherever irrigation is possible.\r\n\r\nThe land itself is of recent geological origin. It has been, and is\r\nbeing, created by sediments from the many torrents that erode the\r\ninterior mountains. New alluvial deposits tend to be gravelly, without\r\nhumus, and require many years before sufficient vegetation to make them\r\nfertile can be established. The sedimentation process, moreover, raises\r\nriver channels above the level of the nearby terrain. Channels change\r\nfrequently, devastating areas that have not been stabilized and creating\r\nmarshes in others by blocking off the drainage. Road builders are\r\nconfronted with difficult and constantly changing conditions.\r\n\r\nRainfall is heavy during the winter and is infrequent to nonexistent\r\nduring nearly half the year. Mosquitoes thrive in the hot, humid, and\r\nmarshy land. Only since about 1930 have there been effective measures to\r\ncontrol malaria. Before then no extensive working of areas near the\r\nmarshes could be seriously considered. For these reasons the coastal\r\nzone, in addition to supporting few people, has until relatively\r\nrecently acted as a barrier, hindering, rather than encouraging, contact\r\nwith the interior.\r\n\r\nCoastal hills descend abruptly to Ionian Sea beaches along the Albanian\r\nRiviera from Vlore Bay southward to about Sarande. The 500- and\r\n1,000-foot contour lines are within a mile or so of the water along\r\nnearly the entire distance. In the northern portion a 4,000-foot ridge\r\nis frequently only two to three miles inland. South of Sarande is\r\nanother small area of coastal lowlands fronting on the Ionian Sea and\r\nseparated from the Greek island of Corfu (Kerkira) by a mile-wide\r\nchannel. Climate and soil conditions permit the cultivation of citrus\r\nfruits in this southernmost area of Albania.\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Uplands\r\n\r\nThe central uplands region extends south from the Drin River valley,\r\nwhich marks the southern boundary of the North Albanian Alpine area, to\r\nthe southern mountains. It is an area of generally lower mountain\r\nterrain immediately east of the lowlands. In the north, from the Drin\r\nRiver to the vicinity of Elbasan, it constitutes an area about twenty\r\nmiles wide. It narrows to practically nothing in the vicinity of\r\nElbasan, then widens into a broader triangular shape with its base\r\nagainst the southern mountains. Earth shifting along the faultline that\r\nroughly defines the western edge of the central uplands causes frequent\r\nand occasionally severe earthquakes. Major damage occurred over wide\r\nareas in 1967 and 1969.\r\n\r\nSofter rocks predominate in the uplands. The most extensive are flysch,\r\na soft crumbly rock that is usually sandstone but frequently contains\r\nshales, sandy limestones, and marl. This type of formation erodes\r\nrapidly and is the basis of much of the poor alluvial lowland soil. The\r\nridges of the uplands are extensions of the Dalmatian coastal range that\r\nenters Albania from Yugoslavia. Elevations are generally moderate,\r\nbetween 1,000 and 3,000 feet with a few reaching above 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSerpentine Zone\r\n\r\nAlthough there are rugged terrain and high points in the central\r\nuplands, the first major mountain range inland from the Adriatic is an\r\narea of predominantly serpentine rock. The serpentine zone extends\r\nnearly the length of the country, from the North Albanian Alps to the\r\nGreek border south of Korce, an area 10 to 20 miles wide and over 125\r\nmiles in length lying generally between the central uplands and the\r\neastern highlands. At Elbasan, however, it makes nearly direct contact\r\nwith the coastal plain, and it reaches the eastern border for nearly 50\r\nmiles in, and north of, the lake region. Within its zone there are many\r\nareas in which sharp limestone and sandstone outcroppings predominate\r\nover the serpentine, although the ranges as a whole are characterized by\r\nrounded mountain features.\r\n\r\nThe serpentine rock derives its name from its dull green color and often\r\nmottled or spotted appearance. It can occur in several states. Iron,\r\nnickel, or other metals can substitute in its chemical formula for the\r\nmore prevalent magnesium and will cause color variations.\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Highlands\r\n\r\nThe mountains east of the serpentine zone are the highest in the country\r\nand are the basis for part of the eastern boundary. They occupy a narrow\r\nstrip south of Lakes Ohrid and Prespa, and a similar one, also running\r\nnorth and south, lies between the White Drin River and the Yugoslav city\r\nof Debar. A peak in the Korab range, on the border north of Debar,\r\nexceeds 9,000 feet. The ranges have north-south trend lines.\r\nGeologically young and composed largely of hard limestone rocks, the\r\neastern highlands, together with the North Albanian Alps and the\r\nserpentine zone, are the most rugged and inaccessible of any terrain on\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\nLake Region\r\n\r\nThe three lakes of easternmost Albania are part of the Macedonian lake\r\ndistrict. The Yugoslav border passes through Lake Ohrid; all but a small\r\ntip of Little Lake Prespa is in Greece; and the point at which the\r\nboundaries of all three states meet is in Lake Prespa. The two larger\r\nlakes have areas of about 100 square miles each, and Little Lake Prespa\r\nis about one-fifth as large. These are total surface areas, including\r\nthe portions on both sides of the national boundary lines. The surface\r\nelevation is about 2,285 feet for Lake Ohrid and about 2,800 feet for\r\nthe other two. The lakes are remote and picturesque. Lake Ohrid is fed\r\nprimarily from underground springs and is blue and very clear. At times\r\nits transparency can approach 70 feet. A good percentage of the terrain\r\nin the vicinity of the lakes is not overly steep, and it supports a\r\nlarger population than any other inland portion of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BOUNDARIES\r\n\r\nThe distinct ethnic character of the people and their isolation within a\r\nfairly restricted and definable area brought support for their demands\r\nfor independence in the early twentieth century. There were places where\r\ndifferent ethnic populations intermingled, and there were other\r\npressures that affected the definition of the borders. The Kosovo area\r\nacross the northeastern border is a part of modern Yugoslavia, but it\r\ncontains a substantial Albanian population. There are Greeks and\r\nAlbanians in the mountains on both sides of the southeastern boundary.\r\nAlbania is not content with the Kosovo situation, and neither Greece nor\r\nAlbania is satisfied with the division effected by their mutual border.\r\n\r\nThe country is the smallest in Eastern Europe and has a perimeter of\r\nonly 750 miles. The border shared with Yugoslavia runs northward from\r\nLake Prespa, around northern Albania, to the Adriatic Sea for a total of\r\njust under 300 miles. Forty miles of this border follows river courses,\r\nand an almost equal distance is within lakes. The Greek border from the\r\ncommon point in Lake Prespa southwest to the Ionian Sea is about 160\r\nmiles long. Twelve miles of this border are within lakes but, because it\r\ncrosses the trend lines of the southern mountain ranges, only four miles\r\nare along rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Adriatic and Ionian coastline is just under 300 miles long. The\r\nlowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea and the Strait of Otranto,\r\nwhich is a mere 47 miles from the heel of the Italian boot. The Albanian\r\nRiviera, the coastline that runs southeast from Vlore, is on the Ionian\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the coastline, all Albanian borders are\r\nartificial. They were established in principle at the 1913 Conference of\r\nAmbassadors in London. The country was occupied by the warring powers\r\nduring World War I, but the 1913 boundaries were reaffirmed at\r\nVersailles in 1921. Finally demarcated in 1923, they were confirmed by\r\nthe Paris Agreement of 1926 and were essentially unchanged in 1970. The\r\noriginal principle was to define the borders in accordance with the best\r\ninterests of the Albanian ethnic group and the nationalities in adjacent\r\nareas. The northern and eastern borders were intended, insofar as\r\npossible, to separate the Albanians from the Serbian and Montenegrin\r\npeoples; the southeast border was to separate Albanians and Greeks; and\r\nthe valuable western Macedonia lake district was to be divided among the\r\nstates whose populations shared the area.\r\n\r\nWhen there was no compromise involving other factors, borderlines were\r\nchosen to make the best possible separation of national groups,\r\nconnecting the best marked physical features available. Allowance was\r\nmade for local economic situations, to keep from separating a village\r\nfrom its animals' grazing areas or from the markets for its produce.\r\nPolitical pressures also were a factor in the negotiations, but the\r\nnegotiations were subject to approval by powers having relatively remote\r\ninterests, most of which involved the balance of power rather than\r\neconomic ambitions.\r\n\r\nDivision of the lake district among three states required that each of\r\nthem have a share of the lowlands in the vicinity. Such a distribution\r\nwas artificial but, once made, necessarily influenced the borderlines to\r\nthe north and south. The border that runs generally north from the\r\nlakes, although it follows the ridges of the eastern highlands, stays\r\nsome ten to twenty miles west of the watershed divide.\r\n\r\nProceeding counterclockwise around northern Albania, the watershed\r\ndivide was abandoned altogether along the northeast boundary. In the\r\nprocess a large Albanian population in Kosovo was incorporated into\r\nYugoslavia.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme north and the northeastern mountainous sections, the\r\nborder with Yugoslavia connects high points and follows mountain ridges\r\nthrough the North Albanian Alps where there is little movement of the\r\npeople. There is no natural topographic dividing line from the\r\nhighlands, through Lake Scutari, to the Adriatic, but the lake and a\r\nportion of the Buene River south of it were used. From the lake district\r\nsouth and southwest to the Ionian Sea, the boundary runs perpendicular\r\nto the terrain trend lines and crosses a number of ridges instead of\r\nfollowing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS\r\n\r\nThe twenty-six districts that are the primary administrative\r\nsubdivisions of the country have evolved from divisions that have\r\nexisted for many years or have developed over a period of time (see fig.\r\n3). In the northern third of the country, district lines were based on\r\nthe territory occupied by tribal groups. In the part of the country\r\nsouth from about Tirana, they were based on the large landholdings\r\ncontrolled by those who in earlier years had governed the areas for the\r\nOttomans.\r\n\r\nUpon independence most of the old local boundaries, long understood if\r\nnot always precisely defined, were retained, and the areas became\r\nprefectures. Before World War II there were ten prefectures, which in\r\nturn were divided into about forty subprefectures. The Communist regime\r\ndid not abandon the prefectures immediately but eventually replaced them\r\nwith districts that were, generally, based on the old subprefectures. In\r\na series of changes, the latest of which were made in December 1967, the\r\ndistricts were consolidated into the twenty-six that existed in 1970.\r\nThe districts are much the same size. Sixteen of them have areas ranging\r\nbetween 300 and 600 square miles. The largest, Shkoder, has about 980\r\nsquare miles; the smallest, Lezhe, has about 180.\r\n\r\nChanges in the areas and boundaries of the districts made during the\r\n1960s were based chiefly on economic considerations, although political\r\nand security considerations also played a part. A major factor has been\r\nthe collectivization of agriculture. In 1968 and 1969, for example, when\r\nthe government decided to enlarge the collective farms, district lines\r\nwere shifted in order to keep all of the land in a collective within the\r\nsame district (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Source: Adapted from _Vjetari Statistikor i R. P. Sh.,\r\n1967-1968_, Tirana, 1968, frontispiece.\r\n\r\n_Figure 3. Administrative Districts in Albania_]\r\n\r\nAlthough there are natural barriers to almost all movement in the\r\ncountry, there are few, if any, that contribute to the boundaries of the\r\ndistricts. Eight districts border on the seashore, but only three of\r\nthem have more lowland than mountainous terrain. The Shkoder District,\r\nfor example, has all of the lowlands in the vicinity of the city and\r\nalmost half of the most mountainous portion of the North Albanian Alps.\r\nIn a few instances the borders of interior districts follow the river\r\nvalleys, but it is more usual for them to contain segments of the rivers\r\nand, when this is the case, their boundary lines stay in the higher\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\nWith its coastline oriented westward onto the Adriatic and Ionian seas,\r\nits highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire\r\ncountry lying at a latitude that receives different patterns of weather\r\nsystems during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a number of\r\nclimatic regions highly unusual for so small an area. The coastal\r\nlowlands have typically Mediterranean weather; the highlands have a\r\nso-called Mediterranean continental climate. Both the lowland and\r\ninterior weather change markedly from north to south.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands have mild winters, averaging about 45°F. Summer\r\ntemperatures average 75°F., humidity is high, and the season tends to be\r\noppressively uncomfortable. The southern lowlands are warmer, averaging\r\nabout five degrees higher throughout the year. The difference is greater\r\nthan five degrees during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.\r\n\r\nInland temperatures vary more widely with differences in elevation than\r\nwith latitude or any other factor. Cold winter temperatures in the\r\nmountains result from the continental air masses that predominate over\r\nEastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow\r\nmuch of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the\r\ncoastal areas and much lower at high elevations, but daily fluctuations\r\nare greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and\r\nriver valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool (see\r\ntable 1).\r\n\r\nThe average precipitation over the country is high resulting from the\r\nconvergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean with the\r\ncontinental air mass. They usually meet at the point where the terrain\r\nrises. Arriving at that line, the Mediterranean air meets increasing\r\nground elevations that force it to rise and an air mass that tends to\r\nresist its further progress. This causes the heaviest rainfall in the\r\ncentral uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean\r\nair is uplifted also result in frequent thunderstorms. Many of them in\r\nthis area are violent and are accompanied by high local winds and\r\ntorrential downpours.\r\n\r\n_Table 1.

When there is a dominant continental air mass,\r\nit spills cold air onto the lowland areas. This occurs most frequently\r\nin the winter season. Since the season's lower temperatures damage olive\r\ntrees and citrus fruits, their groves and orchards are restricted to\r\nsheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas that\r\nhave seemingly high average winter temperatures.\r\n\r\nLowland rainfall averages from forty to nearly sixty inches annually,\r\nincreasing between those extremes from south to north. Nearly 95 percent\r\nof the rain falls during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nRainfall in the upland mountain ranges is higher. Adequate records are\r\nnot available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are\r\nprobably about 70 inches and are as high as 100 inches in some northern\r\nareas. The seasonal variation is not quite as great as in the coastal\r\narea, with the most nearly even distribution in the north, largely\r\nbecause of summer thunderstorms.\r\n\r\nThe higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the\r\nintermediate uplands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations,\r\nbut the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area. In the\r\nnorthern mountains, for example, the months that usually have the\r\nhighest averages are November and June.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE\r\n\r\nAll but a very small portion of the precipitation drains through the\r\nrivers to the coastline without leaving the country. With the exception\r\nof a few insignificant trickles, only one small stream in the northern\r\npart of the country escapes Albania. In the south an even smaller\r\nrivulet drains into Greece. As the divide is on the eastern side of the\r\nborders with Yugoslavia and Greece, however, a considerable amount of\r\nwater from those countries drains through Albania. A quite extensive\r\nportion of the White Drin River basin is in the Kosovo area across the\r\nnortheastern Yugoslav border. The three lakes shared with Yugoslavia and\r\nGreece, as well as all the streams that flow into them, drain into the\r\nDrin River. The watershed divide in the south also dips nearly forty\r\nmiles into Greece at one point. Several tributaries of the Vijose River\r\nrise in that area (see fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 4. Rivers and Lakes in Albania_]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Drin River, which flows northward and drains\r\nnearly the entire eastern border region before it turns westward to the\r\nsea, most of the rivers in the northern and central parts of the country\r\nflow much more directly westward to the sea. In the process they cut\r\nthrough the ridges rather than flowing around them. This apparent\r\nimpossibility came about because the highlands were originally lifted\r\nwithout much folding. The streams came into existence at that time and\r\nantedate the ridges because the compression and folding of the plateau\r\noccurred later. The folding process was rapid enough in many instances\r\nto block the rivers temporarily, forming lakes that existed until the\r\ndownstream channel was cut sufficiently to drain them. This sequence\r\ncreated the many interior basins that are typically a part of the\r\nlandforms. During the lifetimes of the temporary lakes enough sediment\r\nwas deposited in them to form the basis for fertile soils. Folding was\r\nonly infrequently rapid enough to force the streams to radically\r\ndifferent channels.\r\n\r\nThe precipitous fall from higher elevations and the highly irregular\r\nseasonal flow patterns that are characteristic of nearly all streams in\r\nthe country reduce the immediate value of the streams. They erode the\r\nmountains and deposit the sediment that created, and continues to add\r\nto, the lowlands, but the rivers flood during the seasons when there is\r\nlocal rainfall. When the lands are parched and need irrigation, the\r\nrivers are usually dry. Their violence makes them difficult to control,\r\nand they are unnavigable. The Buene is an exception. It is dredged\r\nbetween Shkoder and the Adriatic and is navigable for small ships. In\r\ncontrast to their histories of holding fast to their courses in the\r\nmountains, the rivers have constantly changed channels on the lower\r\nplains, making wastes of much of the land they have created.\r\n\r\nThe Drin River is the largest and most constant stream (see table 2).\r\nFed by melting snows from the northern and eastern mountains and by the\r\nmore evenly distributed seasonal precipitation of that area, its flow\r\ndoes not have the extreme variations characteristic of nearly all other\r\nrivers in the country. Its normal flow varies seasonally by only about\r\none-third. Along its length of about 175 miles it drains nearly 2,300\r\nsquare miles within Albania. As it also collects from the Adriatic\r\nportion of the Kosovo watershed and the three border lakes (Lake Prespa\r\ndrains to Lake Ohrid via an underground stream), its total basin is\r\naround 6,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe Seman and Vijose are the only other rivers that are more than 100\r\nmiles in length and have basins larger than 1,000 square miles. These\r\nrivers drain the southern regions and, reflecting the seasonal\r\ndistribution of rainfall, are torrents in winter and nearly dry in the\r\nsummer, in spite of their relatively long lengths. This is also the case\r\nwith the many shorter streams. In the summer most of them carry less\r\nthan a tenth of their winter averages, if they are not altogether dry.\r\n\r\n_Table 2.

Changing channels frustrate\r\ndevelopment in many areas. Old channels become barriers to proper\r\ndrainage and create swamps or marshlands. It has been difficult to build\r\nroads or railroads across the lowlands or to use the land.\r\n\r\nIrrigation has been accomplished ingeniously by Albanian peasants for\r\nmany years, to the degree that they and their expertise have been sought\r\nafter throughout Europe. Projects required to irrigate or to reclaim\r\nlarge areas of the lowlands, however, are on a scale that probably\r\ncannot be accomplished without financial assistance from outside the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAlthough water is available in quantities adequate for irrigation and it\r\nhas the amount of fall necessary for hydroelectric power production,\r\nterrain and seasonal factors are such that major capital investment\r\nwould be required for both irrigation and power projects. Snow\r\nstabilizes drainage of the higher northern and eastern mountains but,\r\nunfortunately, the only major snow accumulations are in the Drin basin,\r\ninfluencing only the one river system.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL RESOURCES\r\n\r\nSoils\r\n\r\nSoil resources are small. Arable land figures notwithstanding, good\r\nagricultural land amounts to only about 5 percent of the country's area.\r\nSoils over limestone are thin or altogether lacking. Serpentine rock\r\nerodes slowly and produces clays of little agricultural value. The\r\nsofter rocks of the intermediate mountains crumble easily into course\r\nand infertile sands and gravels that take many years to acquire humus.\r\nThe alluvial soil of the lowland plains, therefore, tends to be sterile\r\nin addition to receiving its precipitation seasonally and being poorly\r\ndrained. There is little land along the narrow valley floors. The best\r\nsoils, those within the inland basins, are excellent. The narrow margin\r\nof slightly elevated land between the coastal plains and the mountains\r\nalso provides excellent arable fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetation\r\n\r\nWestern sources have estimated that, in 1969, 11 percent of the land\r\narea was arable, of which nearly one-half was in use as vineyards and\r\nolive groves. Forests covered just over one-third of the land, and\r\npastures just under one-third. About 22 percent of the land was\r\nunproductive, but one-half of the unproductive areas had a potential for\r\ndevelopment. Albanian government pronouncements have stated that about\r\n20 percent of the land was arable in 1968 and that this figure would be\r\nincreased to 22 percent in 1970. The discrepancies in land use\r\nstatistics arise from varying interpretations as to the amount of\r\npastureland that is arable. Much that Albanian sources have claimed as\r\nnewly arable almost certainly is marginally so.\r\n\r\nDependence upon corn as the primary staple crop in much of the country\r\nand limited amounts of arable land tended, until about 1950, to prevent\r\nproper crop rotation. The government is attempting to introduce more\r\nscientific agricultural practices and has claimed improved crop yields.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of land that can be cultivated for the production of\r\nfoodstuffs is meager, the remoteness of the interior has allowed natural\r\nflora to exist over fairly extensive areas with little disturbance. A\r\nlarge variety of species flourishes, and an unusual number of them are\r\nfound in that vicinity only. Of some 2,300 seed-bearing plants, over 300\r\nappear in the Balkans alone, and more than 50 occur only in Albania.\r\n\r\nThe land considered forest includes areas that contain little more than\r\nscrub ground cover and others that have been ravaged by unsystematic\r\ncutting. More than half of the forests, however, contain mature trees\r\nand, owing largely to their inaccessibility, have escaped the reckless\r\nharvesting that destroyed many lower elevation forests during the first\r\nyears of the country's independence.\r\n\r\nMaquis, a Mediterranean scrub tree, grows to about fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet, can be extremely dense, and is the most frequent ground cover at\r\nlow elevations. It withstands dry weather and, although it is of little\r\nvalue as a tree and does not of itself build a rich soil, it stabilizes\r\nthe alluvial lowlands and provides cover for better humus-producing\r\nvegetation. Maquis can survive at slightly higher elevations in\r\nsheltered conditions, but it is usually found below 1,000 or 1,300 feet.\r\nMost maquis species are evergreen. Deciduous scrub, usually\r\nChrist's-thorn, or _shiblijak_, is also common in the lowlands, but it\r\noccurs much less frequently than maquis.\r\n\r\nThe oaks are the most important of trees. Oak forests have never\r\nreattained the majesty they had during the days of Venice's power when\r\nthey could be called upon to furnish 400 shiploads of straight oak stems\r\nfor Venetian fleets, but in 1970 they still constituted nearly half of\r\nall forests. The oaks are valuable not only for their economic worth as\r\nfuel and lumber but also because the leaves of deciduous varieties and\r\nthe undergrowth encouraged beneath them are excellent soil builders.\r\nOccurring at moderate elevations, however, they have been accessible and\r\noverexploited. Lowland oak forests contain poorer species that rarely\r\ngrow in excess of thirty feet tall, but the thick undergrowth they\r\nusually allow provides stability and improves the alluvial soil. The\r\nfiner and more valuable species occur at middle and higher elevations.\r\nOak forests predominate between 1,000- and 3,000-foot elevations but\r\noccur up to about 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nBeech trees appear at all elevations between 3,000 feet and the\r\ntimberline. They predominate in northern areas between about 3,500 and\r\n6,000 feet. In the south they flourish at the same elevations but are\r\nusually outnumbered by conifers. Beech is excellent hard wood, and its\r\nleaves are among the best of soil builders. The trees generate most of\r\nthe humus themselves, as their canopies interlace tightly in mature\r\nforests, permitting relatively little undergrowth to flourish on the\r\nforest floors beneath them. Mature forests have survived in many of the\r\nremote, inaccessible areas that beech species prefer. The most copious\r\nforests are in cloud forest regions where cloud cover is almost\r\nconstant, rainfall is frequent, and temperatures do not usually reach\r\nthe extreme highs.\r\n\r\nThe better conifers, usually including several pine species in the\r\nnorth and fir, with lesser numbers of pine and spruce, in the south,\r\ncoexist with beech but tolerate poorer soils and tend to predominate at\r\nthe highest elevations. Although they tend to have less continuous\r\ncanopies than beech forests, they do not encourage undergrowth. Their\r\nneedles, along with rapid decay of their softer dead wood, however, can\r\ncreate deep humus. The poorer quality lowland pines do well at\r\nelevations down to sea level and will tolerate certain conditions,\r\nalthough not overly poor drainage, in which the oak will not survive.\r\nIts woods usually have discontinuous canopies and allow dense maquis and\r\nother lower shrubs to flourish beneath them.\r\n\r\nTrue mixed woods, sometimes referred to as karst woods, occur at medium\r\nelevations. They are usually almost entirely deciduous but have wide\r\nvarieties of species. The larger trees include maple, ash, beech, and\r\noak, but these are vastly outnumbered. Intermediate varieties of\r\nhawthorne, dogwood, hazel, and cherry flourish among the larger trees,\r\nand hundreds of smaller plants, ranging from bushes, shrubs, and ferns\r\nto grasses and moss, provide ground cover. With a profusion of varieties\r\nin constant competition for available space and soil, those that do best\r\nin a particular soil mixture prosper in a given locality. Because the\r\nsoil in the uplands relates closely to the base rock and the mountains\r\nwere created by geologically recent folding that has exposed the edges\r\nof layered rock formations, there are abrupt changes in the basic\r\nsurface rock. This is reflected immediately in mixed woods by equally\r\nabrupt changes in the species that appear.\r\n\r\nOf the more abundant smaller flora families, the daisy, pea, grass,\r\npink, nettle, mustard, parsley, figwort, rose, buttercup, and lily\r\ngroups has more than fifty species that can be found within Albania.\r\nFlowering plants flourish especially well in limestone areas where there\r\nare masses of vividly colored wild flowers during the springtime. Must\r\nless brilliant colors appear on serpentine outcroppings and, as is the\r\ncase with the mixed woods, the difference is abrupt where limestone and\r\nserpentine are the surface rocks in closely adjacent areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWildlife\r\n\r\nSummer livestock grazing in the mountains and uncontrolled hunting\r\nreduced wildlife to insignificance. Some deer, wild boar, and wolves\r\nremain in the more remote forests. Chamois were plentiful in the area\r\nbut are now extremely rare. Wild fowl, however, are abundant in the\r\nlowland swamps and lower forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinerals\r\n\r\nExploitation of the country's minerals generates the largest share of\r\nthe gross industrial product and provides employment for the largest\r\nnumber of the industrial labor force. This does not indicate, however,\r\nthat the country is rich in mineral resources, but it serves to\r\nunderscore the still poorer state of its agricultural and industrial\r\nsectors and indicates that the country engages in relatively little\r\ninternational commerce.\r\n\r\nThere are considerable reserves in oil and natural gas. Oil can be\r\nextracted in quantity sufficient to meet domestic demands and to export.\r\nA pipeline from the oilfields at Stalin (formerly Kucove) transmits the\r\noil to the port of Vlore. The crude oil, however, has a high sulfur\r\ncontent and is expensive to refine.\r\n\r\nChrome is the most important export commodity. Albania is the largest\r\nchrome source in Eastern Europe, and its mines have at times supplied\r\nabout 2 percent of the world's total. Good-quality copper ore is also\r\navailable in export quantities.\r\n\r\nNo hard coal veins are known, but lignite is plentiful and its deposits\r\nare accessible. Asphalt (bitumen) occurs in a concentrated deposit in\r\none small area. This source has been actively worked for centuries. Some\r\nof it has been exported.\r\n\r\nIron, nickel, gold, and silver ores occur in less important deposits.\r\nIron is plentiful, but the ores are of low grade. The other deposits are\r\nminor. Bauxite appears in quantity deposits in several areas. Sufficient\r\nyear-round power sources, however, are not available to process it.\r\nMagnesite, arsenic, pyrites, and gypsum sources are worked. Clay and\r\nkaolin suitable for pottery are also extracted. Salt is abundant.\r\nLimestone is available throughout the country and quarried wherever it\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nEven when its territory sat astride a direct route between two points,\r\nAlbania was usually bypassed because there was nearly always a longer\r\nway around that was easier and safer. As a result, its transportation\r\nlinks with the rest of the world are very few. Its internal systems are\r\nalso inadequate for good communications within the country. All railways\r\nare short, internal routes, and the lines that were complete in 1970\r\nconnected only three of the major cities. Two primary roads, one of\r\nwhich was originally constructed by the Romans, cross into Greece, and a\r\nthird crosses into Yugoslavia. Only a dozen more roads, all of them\r\nsecondary, lead out of the country. There is little air traffic with the\r\noutside world; it usually involves connecting flights to major airlines\r\nin neighboring countries (see fig. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\nRoads\r\n\r\nUntil the twentieth century only two major roads crossed what is now\r\nAlbania. The Romans built the Via Egnatia, which makes an east-west\r\ntransit from Durres (known as Dyrrhachium in Roman times), via the\r\nShkumbin River valley, to the lake district. It continued eastward\r\nacross the Balkan Peninsula to Thessaloniki and Constantinople (now\r\nIstanbul), and the Romans used it to move forces overland to the eastern\r\nportions of their empire. A north-south route, the Via Zenta, was built\r\nby Ragusan merchants during the period when Ragusa (now Dubrovnik) was a\r\nBalkan mercantile power and needed access to the interior of the\r\npeninsula. The road followed the Drin River valley. Both the Via Egnatia\r\nand the Via Zenta fell into disuse during the centuries of Ottoman\r\ncontrol, but the basic course of the Roman road is followed by one of\r\nthe few major highways that has been constructed in the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIndependent Albania was slow to begin construction of roads that would\r\nbetter conform to the country's national requirements. During World War\r\nI Austrian forces built some 400 miles of strategic roads while they\r\noccupied the area. The Italians did the same during World War II. In\r\nboth cases the objective was to improve communications with external\r\npoints. There was no attempt to construct a network that would integrate\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe Hoxha regime has placed more emphasis on internal communications,\r\nand in 1969 it claimed that the principal road network had been expanded\r\nby three times over what it had been in 1938. Perhaps 3,000 miles could\r\nbe classed as improved roads. These are considered all-weather roads,\r\nalthough those in the mountains may be closed by snows. Most of the\r\nsurfaces are hardened with compacted stone or gravel, and a few have a\r\ntarry stabilizer. Better roads have asphalt surfaces. Road construction\r\nin almost all parts of the country is difficult, especially in bridge\r\nbuilding, and some roads are construction masterpieces. Once built,\r\nhowever, routine maintenance has ordinarily not been properly\r\naccomplished, and surfaces have deteriorated.\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways\r\n\r\nThe first standard-gauge railroad construction began in 1947. The\r\nItalians had started roadbeds during their World War II occupation but\r\nhad abandoned their projects in 1943. By 1970 there were only about 135\r\nmiles of completed lines. These included basic lines between Durres and\r\nTirana and between Durres and Elbasan. There is difficult terrain\r\nbetween Tirana and Elbasan and, although only about 20 miles apart, they\r\nare connected via Durres only.\r\n\r\nThe lines from Durres curve northward to Tirana and southward to\r\napproach Elbasan via the Shkumbin valley. A northern offshoot from the\r\nDurres-Tirana line is complete to Lac and will be extended to Shkoder. A\r\nsouthern offshoot from Rrogozhine on the Durres-Elbasan line is now in\r\nservice to Fier and will be extended to Vlore. The combination of these\r\ntwo routes will constitute a coastal line from Shkoder to Vlore.\r\n\r\nConstruction was in progress in 1970 on a line that will connect Elbasan\r\nwith Prrenjas, which is just over five miles from Lake Ohrid. This line\r\nfollows the route of the old Roman Via Egnatia, and in later programs it\r\nwill probably be extended to Lin, on the lake, and then southward to\r\nKorce. When these lines are completed, they and the road network will\r\nprovide vastly improved internal communications, but many small areas\r\nwithin the North Albanian Alps and the higher central and eastern\r\nmountains will remain difficult to reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nPipeline\r\n\r\nDuring the mid-1930s the Italian state-owned petroleum company\r\nconstructed a forty-four-mile, eight-inch pipeline to connect the\r\noilfields in the Stalin area with the port of Vlore. The line had a\r\ncapacity of about 5,000 barrels a day and carried crude for\r\ntransshipment to refineries in Italy. In the early 1950s the line was\r\nextended northward to the newly built refinery at Cerrik.\r\n\r\n\r\nAirlines\r\n\r\nIn the early post-World War II period when Albania was practically a\r\nvassal state of Yugoslavia, regular air traffic was established between\r\nBelgrade and Tirana. After the estrangement of Yugoslavia from the\r\nSoviet Union, when Albania became a satellite of the Soviet Union,\r\nregular traffic was set up between Tirana and Moscow and, to a lesser\r\ndegree, between Tirana and the capitals of the Eastern European\r\nCommunist countries other than Belgrade. When Albania became aligned\r\nwith Communist China, direct connections with almost all external points\r\nwere severed. Even Peking flights were routed via intermediate stops in\r\nItaly, usually Bari or Rome.\r\n\r\nBetween 1967 and 1970 connections between Albania and most of the\r\nEastern European countries, but not the Soviet Union, were gradually\r\nrestored. Service is scheduled but infrequent. Weekly flights are\r\ntypically connected through Belgrade. Traffic elsewhere is ordinarily\r\nrouted via Italy. Albanian officials depart and reenter the country via\r\nBari or Rome, connecting to Tirana on a scheduled Alitalia flight or by\r\nan Albanian flight. Internal air services are also limited. Those\r\navailable are centered on Tirana.\r\n\r\n\r\nMerchant Shipping\r\n\r\nBecause no railway leaves the country and border-crossing roads are\r\ninadequate, nearly all foreign trade is carried by sea. Durres and Vlore\r\nare the major ports. Durres has a first-class harbor, warehouses,\r\npetroleum storage tanks, a shipbuilding capability, and railway spurs to\r\nthe docks. Vlore is a better natural port and is the terminus of the oil\r\npipeline. It has fewer port facilities than Durres, however, and no rail\r\nconnections with the rest of the country. Sarande, Shengjin, and Porte\r\nPalermo are less important ports.\r\n\r\nOnly the Drin and Buene rivers might be considered navigable to any\r\ndegree and even then only for small ships and short distances. Lake\r\nScutari and the interior lakes are navigable but are of little\r\ncommercial use. Smaller oceangoing craft are used in a limited amount of\r\ncoastal trade.\r\n\r\nThe government is encouraging the creation of a national merchant fleet.\r\n_Lloyd's Register of Shipping_ for 1968 listed eleven Albanian vessels\r\ntotaling 36,550 gross tons. Albania and Communist China maintain a\r\njointly owned shipping line, and the number of ships with Albanian\r\nregistry is increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population increased by about 71 percent from 1950 to 1969 and in\r\n1970 was increasing at a rate that would double the number of\r\ninhabitants in approximately twenty-six years. The median age, about\r\nnineteen years, was increasing slowly. The abundance of rural population\r\nand the increasing tempo of industrial development provided potential\r\nfor rapid urban growth, but government controls and a scarcity of\r\nhousing tended to restrict population movements.\r\n\r\nPersons of Albanian ethnic origin constituted about 97 percent of the\r\n2.1 million population in early 1970. Of ancient Illyrian descent, they\r\nhave maintained their homogeneity despite many invasions and centuries\r\nof foreign occupation. The Communist regime, in its effort to develop\r\nsocial and cultural solidarity, attempted to reduce consciousness of the\r\ndifferences between the major subgroups, the Gegs in the north and the\r\nTosks in the south. Some progress has been made, but a continuing\r\nstruggle is being carried out against customs and beliefs that are\r\nconsidered remnants of the past and detract from the achievement of\r\nCommunist objectives (see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nThe Albanian language is a derivative of the tongues that were spoken by\r\nthe ancient Illyrians and Thracians. For many centuries its continuity\r\nwas maintained by only verbal means. A standardized alphabet was not\r\ndeveloped until the twentieth century. Since World War II considerable\r\nprogress has been made in making the Tosk dialect the standard written\r\nlanguage. In the late 1960s there were still some variations in\r\nspelling.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of settlement was predominantly one of widely dispersed\r\nvillages; approximately two-thirds of the people lived in communities\r\nwith less than 1,000 population. Only twelve cities had more than 10,000\r\npopulation in 1969. The quadrangular area formed by the cities of\r\nDurres, Tirana, Elbasan, and Fier, all of which are linked by rail and\r\nroads, was experiencing the most rapid growth in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nThere was a very slight improvement in living standards from 1950 to\r\n1970. Despite modest growth in the economy, the per capita gross\r\nnational product (GNP) in 1967 was the lowest in Europe, an estimated\r\nUnited States equivalent of $320. The average citizen's welfare in the\r\nallocation of resources for food, consumers' goods, and housing was\r\nsacrificed to the development of industry and the program to achieve\r\neventual self-sufficiency in agriculture. Reduction of disease and\r\nimproved health were the most important gains countrywide. Also, by 1970\r\nelectricity had been extended to over two-thirds of all villages.\r\nConsistently high levels of population growth placed severe strains on\r\navailable supplies of food, consumers' goods, housing, and services.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION\r\n\r\nThe total population in January 1970 was an increase of approximately\r\n500,000 over the 1960 official census total of 1,626,315. The\r\ndistribution by age groups in 1970 was: under fifteen years of age, 42\r\npercent; fifteen to thirty-nine years, 37 percent; forty to sixty-four\r\nyears, 16 percent; and sixty-five years and over, 5 percent. With almost\r\n60 percent of its inhabitants under forty years of age and a median age\r\nof approximately nineteen years, the population was extremely youthful,\r\nand indications were that it would remain so into the 1970s. The\r\nproportion of persons in the dependent age groups, under fifteen and\r\nover sixty-four years, to the working age group, fifteen to sixty-four\r\nyears, was 887 to 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe overall ratio of males to females, 106 to 100, was the highest among\r\nthe Communist countries of East Europe. The preponderance of men was\r\ngreatest at ages below forty; in the age group above sixty-four there\r\nwere only 77 men to 100 women. The higher ratio of men for the total\r\npopulation was attributed in part to the high infant mortality rate\r\namong female infants, caused by neglect and the deference accorded to\r\nmale progeny. Losses in World War II, an estimated 28,800 persons, or\r\n2.48 percent of the population, had little influence on the ratio of\r\nmales to females and the population structure.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the traditional pattern of a highly dispersed\r\npopulation, the country remains predominantly rural. About two-thirds\r\nlive in villages and in the countryside. Urban population increased from\r\nabout one-fifth to one-third of the total during the 1950-70 period and\r\nwould have increased to a greater extent had the government not taken\r\nmeasures, beginning in the mid-1960s, to build up agriculture and to\r\nrestrict city growth. During the drive to reduce the number of people\r\ninvolved in administration and to increase production forces in the\r\nmid-1960s, thousands of persons living in the city, including some from\r\nthe bureaucracy and the Party, were sent to the country.\r\n\r\nHousing in the cities was greatly overcrowded, and the allocation of new\r\ndwellings built by state funds and controlled by the government provided\r\nfurther restrictions on city growth. Indications were that the expansion\r\nof industry would continue to require urban growth but that the rate of\r\ngrowth would be controlled. The largest cities and their populations in\r\n1967 were: Tirana, 170,603; Durres, 80,066; Vlore, 57,745; Korce,\r\n53,563; and Shkoder, 49,095.\r\n\r\nThe birth rate declined only slightly from 1950 to 1970 and in 1968 was\r\n35.5 per 1,000 population (see table 3). Fertility continued at a high\r\nlevel, and there were no apparent influences that tended to reduce the\r\nprevailing rate of births. No information was published concerning the\r\neffects, if any, on the birth rate of women's employment outside the\r\nhome, abortions, contraceptives, or other restraints on population\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of medical services and improvement in the standard of\r\nhealth during the 1950s and 1960s resulted in a marked decline in the\r\nmortality rate, from 14 per 1,000 in 1950 to 8 per 1,000 in 1968. The\r\nage structure of the population, with a preponderance in the lower age\r\nbrackets, provided the potential for a continuing low mortality rate.\r\n\r\nA concomitant of the reduced death rate was an increase in life\r\nexpectancy. Data from domestic sources indicated that the average life\r\nexpectancy at birth increased from 53.5 years in 1950 to 66.1 years in\r\n1965.\r\n\r\nBecause of the highly restrictive policies of the Communist regime,\r\nmigration into and out of the country had a negligible influence on the\r\nsize and composition of the population. Internal migration was\r\ncontrolled by requiring approval for persons to move from one location\r\nto another. Specific data on the scale and character of population\r\nmovements were not available.\r\n\r\nThe pattern of sustained high birth rates and declining death rates\r\nresulted in high rates of natural increase. Total population increased\r\nby 71 percent from 1950 to 1969, whereas the average increase for all\r\nother East European Communist countries, excluding the Soviet Union, was\r\n18 percent. The growth rate for 1970 was estimated at 2.7 percent.\r\n\r\nGovernment and Party leaders, voicing the need for greater numbers of\r\npeople for the building of socialism, supported a continuing high level\r\nof population growth. They were undeterred, in the face of persistent\r\nshortages of food and the requirement for foreign assistance, in their\r\nencouragement of a sustained high birth rate and the payment of an\r\nallowance for each child.\r\n\r\n_Table 3.

Among\r\nthe Albanians, the natural dividing line between the Gegs and the Tosks\r\nis the Shkumbin River, but there is some spillover on both sides.\r\nNumerically, the Gegs predominate, making up slightly over one-half of\r\nthe Albanians within the country (see ch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nDespite successive foreign invasions and centuries of occupation, a\r\ndistinctive ethnic identity was preserved. Mountains and the lack of\r\ncommunication routes provided isolation and opportunity to evade\r\nintruders. Nevertheless, the imprints of foreign influences were\r\nconsiderable. Additions and modifications to the language were made from\r\nthe Latin, Greek, Slavic, and Turkish contacts. Lacking an organized\r\nreligion as part of their Illyrian heritage, Albanians embraced the\r\nMuslim, Orthodox, and Roman Catholic faiths brought to them by their\r\nconquerors (see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nIndividual Albanians distinguished themselves in the service of the\r\nRoman and Turkish empires and were noted for their ability as soldiers.\r\nIt was not until the nineteenth century when they began to seek\r\nautonomy that their history was recorded in writing. Kinship and tribal\r\naffiliations, a common spoken language, and folk customs served to\r\nprovide continuity and common identity through the many centuries of\r\nrelative obscurity.\r\n\r\nThere are marked differences in the physical appearance of the typical\r\nGeg and the typical Tosk, but until World War II the greatest contrast\r\nwas in their social systems. The Geg and Tosk dialects differ, and there\r\nare also variations within subgroups. Some progress was made under the\r\nZog regime in bringing the clans, whose authority prevailed particularly\r\nin the north, under government control and in eliminating blood feuds\r\n(see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nAfter the Communists emerged victorious they imposed controls, the\r\nobjective of which was to eliminate clan rule entirely; they waged a\r\ncontinuing struggle against customs and attitudes that, they believed,\r\ndetracted from the growth of socialism. Blood feuds were brought to an\r\nend. Party and government leaders, in their effort to develop national\r\nsocial and cultural solidarity in a Communist society, publicly tended\r\nto ignore ethnic differences.\r\n\r\nIn practice, Enver Hoxha, the Party leader, who came from the south and\r\nreceived the bulk of his support during World War II from that area,\r\nfrequently gave preference to persons and customs of Tosk origin. In the\r\nlate 1960s Party and government leaders continued to devote considerable\r\neffort to the suppression of customs and rituals that, they declared,\r\nwere vestiges of the patriarchal, bourgeois, and religious systems of\r\nthe past. On one occasion in 1968 the Party announced that because of\r\nits influence 450 infant betrothals were annulled and 1,000 girls\r\nrenounced ancient customs, including the taboo against females leaving\r\ntheir village (see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nThe Gegs, because of their greater isolation in the mountainous areas of\r\nthe north, held on to their tribal organization and customs more\r\ntenaciously than the Tosks. As late as the 1920s approximately 20\r\npercent of male deaths in some areas of northern Albania were attributed\r\nto blood feuds.\r\n\r\nUnder the unwritten tribal codes, which included the regulation of\r\nfeuds, any blow, as well as many offenses committed against women,\r\ncalled for blood. Permitting a girl who had been betrothed in infancy to\r\nmarry another, for example, could cause a blood feud. The _besa_ (pledge\r\nto keep one's word as a solemn obligation) was used under various\r\nconditions and included pledges to postpone quarrels. A person who\r\nkilled a fellow tribesman was commonly punished by his neighbors, who\r\ncustomarily burned his house and destroyed his property. As fugitives\r\nfrom their own communities, such persons were given assistance wherever\r\nthey applied.\r\n\r\nA man who failed to carry out prescribed vengeance against a member of\r\nanother tribe or that individual's relatives was subjected to\r\nintolerable ridicule. Insult was considered one of the highest forms of\r\ndishonor, and the upholding of one's honor was a first requirement for a\r\nGeg. On the other hand, if the individual carried out the required act\r\nof vengeance, he was in turn subject to extinction by the victim's\r\nrelatives. Women were excluded from the feud and, when escorted by a\r\nmale, he too was considered inviolable. In other respects, women's\r\nposition in society generally was one of deprivation and subjugation\r\n(see ch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nThe isolation from influences beyond his community and the constant\r\nstruggle with nature tended to make the Geg an ascetic. Traditionally,\r\nhis closest bonds were those of kinship, as a member of a clan.\r\nObstinate and proud, the Geg proved himself, under the leadership of his\r\ncompatriots, a ruthless and cruel fighter. Visitors from outside the\r\nclan were generally suspect, but every traveler was by custom accorded\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nLess isolated by rugged terrain and with greater, although limited,\r\ncontact with foreign cultures, the Tosk generally was more outspoken and\r\nimaginative than the Geg. Contacts with invaders and foreign occupiers\r\nhad influence and, before 1939, some Tosks had traveled to foreign\r\ncountries to earn sufficient funds to buy land or to obtain an\r\neducation. The clan or tribal system, which by the nineteenth century\r\nwas far less deeply rooted and extensive in the south than in the north,\r\nbegan to disappear after independence was achieved in 1912.\r\n\r\nOf the minority ethnic groups, persons of Greek descent are the most\r\nnumerous. Estimates based on World War II and earlier data indicate that\r\nthey compose approximately 2 percent of the population. They are most\r\nnumerous in the southwestern coastal area of Dhermi and Himare and the\r\nregion extending southward to the Greek border from Gjirokaster. They\r\nhave adopted Albanian folkways and dress. Although their first language\r\nis Greek, they speak Albanian as well.\r\n\r\nPersons of Vlach, Bulgar, Serb, and Gypsy origin make up about 1 percent\r\nof the population. The Vlachs in Albania have lost much of their\r\nhomogeneity and adopted the ways of their Tosk neighbors. The typical\r\nVlach is akin to the modern Romanian. Both are descendants of Romanized\r\nDacians or Thracians of the pre-Christian era.\r\n\r\nUnder Communist rule the Vlachs, mostly herdsmen, have been incorporated\r\ninto the collectivized economy. Previously, they grazed their flocks in\r\nthe mountains in the summer and then returned to the valleys in the\r\nwinter. They are most numerous in the Pindus Mountains and in the Fier,\r\nKorce, and Vlore areas. Persons of Bulgar origin live mostly in the\r\nborder area near Lake Prespa; a few persons of Serb derivation live in\r\nthe Shkoder area; and Gypsies are scattered in various places.\r\n\r\nThere are large numbers of persons of Albanian origin living outside the\r\ncountry. Estimates based on Yugoslav data indicated the total number in\r\nYugoslavia in 1970 was approximately 1 million, of which about 70\r\npercent were in Kosovo. Data is generally lacking on the exact number in\r\nother areas, and estimates vary widely. There may be as many as 250,000\r\nin Italy and Sicily, 350,000 in Greece, and 80,000 in the United States.\r\nThey are found also in Bulgaria, Egypt, Romania, and Turkey. The degree\r\nto which persons living outside the country have retained Albanian\r\ncustoms and language varies. Indications are that they have retained\r\ntheir clannishness to a considerable degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGES\r\n\r\nAlbanian, of Indo-European origin, is the only surviving language of the\r\nearly Thraco-Illyrian group and is spoken by all or nearly all\r\ninhabitants. Some of the minority ethnic groups also speak the tongue of\r\nthe country from which their families originated.\r\n\r\nModern Albanian is derived from the ancient Illyrian and Thracian, but\r\nmany outside influences are evident. Additions and modifications,\r\nbeginning in the pre-Christian era, were made as a result of foreign\r\ncontacts. Most important of these were the Latin and Italian influences\r\nduring the centuries of Roman domination and trade with the Venetian\r\nmerchants and, later, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\r\nContributions also were made by the Greeks, Turks, and Slavs. The first\r\nwritten documents in Albanian did not appear until the fifteenth\r\ncentury; therefore it is difficult to trace the development of the\r\nlanguage during the earlier period.\r\n\r\nThe repressive policies of the Ottoman rulers over a period of 450\r\nyears, beginning in the fifteenth century, further retarded language\r\ndevelopment. Written Albanian was forbidden, and only the Turkish or\r\nGreek languages could be used in schools. Emigré Albanians, particularly\r\nthose in Italy after 1848, helped keep the written language alive. Until\r\nthe nineteenth century continuity of the language in Turkish-dominated\r\nareas was provided largely by verbal communication, including ballads\r\nand folk tales (see ch. 7, Communications and Cultural Development).\r\n\r\nBy the early twentieth century more than a dozen different alphabets had\r\ndeveloped. Some were predominantly either Latin, Greek, or Turko-Arabic.\r\nMany were a mixture of several forms. It was not until 1908 that a\r\nstandardized orthography was adopted. The Latin-based alphabet of\r\nthirty-six letters, approved at that time by a linguistic congress at\r\nMonastir, was made official by a government directive in 1924 and\r\ncontinued in use in 1970.\r\n\r\nLetters are written as they are pronounced. There have been variations\r\nin the spelling of many words because of dialectical differences, and\r\nthey still persist despite the government's efforts to develop a uniform\r\nlanguage. A dictionary was published by the Institute of Sciences in\r\nTirana in 1954, and it indicated that the spelling of some words varied.\r\nDuring the 1960s the Linguistics and History Institute, which was part\r\nof the State University of Tirana, carried on studies relating to\r\nlanguage origins and morphology, but no lexicon was known to have\r\nappeared as of early 1970 to standardize spelling or supersede the 1954\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\nThe two principal Albanian dialects are Geg, spoken by about two-thirds\r\nof the people, including those in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia, and\r\nTosk, by the remaining third. There are subvarieties of both dialects.\r\nDespite the considerable variations that developed in the many isolated\r\ncommunities, Albanians are able to communicate easily with each other.\r\n\r\nEfforts were made by the government during the 1920s and 1930s to\r\nestablish the dialect of the Elbasan area, which was a mixture of Geg\r\nand Tosk, as the standard and official language; but the local dialects\r\npersisted, and writers and even officials continued to use the dialect\r\nof their association. After the Communists, most of whose leaders had\r\ncome from southern Albania, acceded to power, the Tosk dialect became\r\nthe official language of the country. In 1952 the Albanian Writers'\r\nUnion, a Party-controlled organization, took action to make Tosk the\r\nonly dialect to be used in publications.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT PATTERNS\r\n\r\nSome two-thirds of the people live in rural areas in a widely dispersed\r\npattern of small villages. The urban population, according to 1969 data,\r\nlived in forty cities with 1,000 to 10,000 inhabitants and twelve cities\r\nwith over 10,000 dwellers; of the latter group, six had 10,000 to 30,000\r\ninhabitants; two had 30,000 to 50,000; three had 50,000 to 100,000; and\r\none, Tirana, was approaching 200,000.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest concentrations of settlement in the late 1960s were in the\r\ndistricts of Tirana with a density of 528 persons per square mile,\r\nDurres with 469, Fier with 323, and Lushnje with 298. The area\r\nsurrounding Korce and the area immediately around, and to the south of,\r\nShkoder were among the most thickly settled even though the\r\nadministrative districts of Korce and Shkoder were not heavily populated\r\nwhen considered in their entirety (see ch. 3, Physical Environment).\r\n\r\nSeveral factors contributed to the pattern of settlement. Large expanses\r\nof mountains and generally rugged terrain made the building of land\r\ntransportation routes difficult. Poor soil and lack of water during part\r\nof the year did not provide support to large concentrations of people.\r\nMineral and other resources were generally not readily accessible or\r\nwere difficult to exploit (see ch. 3, Physical Environment).\r\n\r\nCoastal cities generally have a small hinterland, and their influence\r\ndoes not extend beyond their borders. The port of Durres, with road and\r\nrail links to Tirana, Elbasan, and Fier, is an exception. During the\r\n1960s the area generally bounded by these cities experienced the\r\ngreatest growth of industry and population of any region. Vlore, a port\r\nand naval center, increased almost fourfold between 1945 and 1967, but\r\nit lacks links with inland areas.\r\n\r\nTirana, the capital and largest city, increased from about 60,000\r\ninhabitants in 1945 to 170,000 in 1967, largely because of the expansion\r\nof industry and a growing bureaucracy. It is located on the inner margin\r\nof the coastal plain and is surrounded by an area of the better soils of\r\nAlbania. The streets in the central area of the city, where government\r\nbuildings are clustered, are wide and attractive; many parts of the city\r\nare much like the rural villages. Tirana has become the most\r\nindustrialized city and continues to be a collecting and distributing\r\npoint for agricultural products of the area.\r\n\r\nCenters for inland mountain valley or upland basin communities are\r\nBerat, Elbasan, and Korce. They, like most cities, have changed little\r\nin appearance and retain much of the flavor of nineteenth-century\r\nagricultural life.\r\n\r\nThe typical mountain village, of 70 to 100 homesteads, is located on an\r\nisolated slope among rocks and thin scrub-like vegetation. Only\r\nfootpaths link it by land with the outside world. During the summer\r\nthere is a drought period which requires that water use be limited to\r\ndrinking. Houses are clustered in the south, whereas in the northern\r\nmountains they tend to be dispersed. Fields and pastures are located\r\nsome distance from the village. Water must be carried from a common\r\nsource, usually a spring. Mountain villages frequently are located at\r\n1,300 to 1,600 feet above sea level. This is generally the line of\r\ncontact between the underlying impervious serpentine rock and layer of\r\nlimestone and the point where spring water comes to the surface.\r\n\r\nAt lower levels the villages are laid out around the collective or state\r\nfarms or enterprises, many of which were previously estates or\r\npatriarchal settlements. Here the houses are more substantial, and the\r\nfields or other place of work are near the village. Water is carried\r\nfrom a common source. Open sewers run down the streets of some villages,\r\nbut this condition is gradually changing. Electric power has been\r\nextended to about 70 percent of all villages, but other facilities and\r\namenities, except medical services, have been little improved since the\r\nend of World War II.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVING CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe standard of living in 1970 was very low, and life was difficult for\r\nthe masses despite very modest improvements in living conditions during\r\nthe 1950s and 1960s. The standard of living was the lowest in Europe and\r\nwas improving at a slow pace because priority was given to industry, to\r\nincreasing the means of production, and to developing eventual\r\nself-sufficiency in food production, especially of cereal foods. The\r\nmost widely felt improvements were in health services and in use of\r\nelectricity, which resulted from expanding the electrical network to\r\nmany villages.\r\n\r\nPlans for the late 1960s and 1970 called for 23 to 25 percent of the\r\nstate budget to be spent on social and cultural sectors. In 1967, when\r\ntotal planned budget spending was 3.6 billion leks (5 leks equal\r\nUS$1--see Glossary), the sum for social and cultural sectors was 837\r\nmillion leks, of which 189 million were for health, 167 million for\r\nsocial insurance, 143 million for assistance to mothers and children,\r\nand 338 million for education and culture.\r\n\r\nThe government maintained that it was improving living conditions by\r\nincreasing food supplies and commodities and by construction of public\r\nfacilities and structures. In February 1970 the chairman of the State\r\nPlanning Commission reported that 1,200 dining rooms, 1,140 bakeries,\r\n1,850 public baths and laundries, and 187 water mains had been built and\r\nthat electricity had been supplied to 1,096 additional villages in 1968\r\nand 1969, leaving only 663 without electricity. Although these additions\r\nadded to the amenities of life, the rapid growth of population caused\r\nheavy strain on the very limited total resources available.\r\n\r\nMedical authorities asserted that many diseases and afflictions that had\r\ntaken heavy tolls of life and tended to debilitate large segments of the\r\npopulation before 1950 had been greatly reduced or eliminated. These\r\nsuccesses were primarily attributable to large-scale inoculation\r\nprograms, elimination or reduction in the number of disease-spreading\r\npests, and expansion of health services. Malnutrition, unsatisfactory\r\nsanitary-hygienic conditions, and indifference to medical aid in some\r\nareas posed problems for further improvements.\r\n\r\nThe Communist regime, posing as the protector of the masses, credited\r\nitself with a revolutionary transformation in the health standards of\r\nthe country. Data on health and disease from other than Albanian sources\r\nwere not available. Statistics released by the Ministry of Health\r\nindicated substantial improvements during the 1960s. Responsibility for\r\nshortcomings and inadequacies relating to health care was attributed to\r\nbackwardness on the part of the people or to the lack of resources.\r\nFailures on the part of the Party or government were not mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere were widespread epidemics of measles in 1948 and 1949 and 1954 and\r\n1955, of Asiatic influenza in 1957, of typhoid in 1945 and 1950, and of\r\npoliomyelitis in 1953. Health officials stated that there were no\r\nepidemics during the 1960s.\r\n\r\nMalaria was one of the most prevalent diseases before 1950. Health\r\nauthorities, assisted by the Rockefeller Foundation beginning in the\r\n1920s, made considerable progress in eliminating mosquitoes and reducing\r\nthe incidence of malaria before World War II. The campaign was continued\r\nby the Italians during their occupation. The ravages of war greatly\r\nincreased the spread of malaria from 1945 to 1947; according to\r\nCommunist reports, 60 to 70 percent of the population were afflicted in\r\nthose years, in comparison with 16.5 percent in 1938.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration provided\r\nfood, medicine, and antimalarial assistance in 1945 and 1946, and the\r\nCommunist regime followed up with a concerted effort against the\r\ndisease, which reduced the percentage of persons afflicted to\r\napproximately 7 percent in the early 1950s. Health officials declared in\r\n1970 that malaria had been eradicated by 1967, and no cases had been\r\nrecorded after that date.\r\n\r\nHealth authorities reported that measles had been eliminated by 1970\r\nthrough a program of mass vaccinations. The last major epidemic, that\r\nof 1954-55, afflicted almost 14 percent of the population. The incidence\r\namong children under three years of age was 60 percent, and 1,712\r\nchildren under age fifteen died.\r\n\r\nA broad program against tuberculosis was begun in the 1960s that\r\nincluded general prophylactic measures and vaccine injections. Health\r\nofficials planned completion of vaccinations countrywide in 1970. It was\r\nestimated that almost 15 percent of the population had tuberculosis in\r\nthe mid-1950s. Officials reported that the incidence of this disease had\r\ndropped to less than 0.2 percent in 1968.\r\n\r\nThe Health Ministry reported progress in combating many other diseases.\r\nSyphilis, once prevalent, was eliminated. A broad program of serologic\r\nexaminations involving over 2.3 million persons between 1947 and 1968\r\nwas utilized to detect venereal disease and was instrumental in reducing\r\nthe rate of syphilis infection from 3.14 percent in 1949 to 0.02 percent\r\nin 1968. Incidence rates per 1,000 population of other illnesses\r\ndecreased from 1955 to 1968 as follows: abdominal typhoid, from 5.2 to\r\n2.4; dysentery, from 87.7 to 14.5; diphtheria, from 2.3 to 0.5;\r\npoliomyelitis, from 0.4 to 0.1; brucellosis, from 2.4 to 0.8; and\r\narthritis, from 2.2 to 0.8. Trachoma was eliminated, and no cases of\r\nrabies were reported in the 1967-69 period. Deaths per 100,000\r\npopulation from contagious diseases, including influenza, decreased from\r\n220 in 1950 to 43 in 1968. Data on the number of deaths from heart\r\nailments, cancer, and other causes were not published.\r\n\r\nAlthough progress was made in reducing mortality among children up to\r\none year of age--from 121.2 per 1,000 live births in 1950 to 75.2 in\r\n1968--the rate remained unusually high. Failure to obtain timely medical\r\nassistance was given as the primary cause of death by health\r\nauthorities. Malnutrition, shortages of professional medical personnel,\r\nand insufficient health facilities were also contributing factors. The\r\nrate for cities in 1968 was 65.4 as compared with 78.0 in rural areas.\r\nSome areas in the mountains of the north ran as high as 136.9 during the\r\n1963-67 period. About three-fourths of all infant deaths occurred during\r\nthe first six months after birth. In 1960 only 34 percent of infant\r\ndeaths were diagnosed; by 1967 the percentage had increased to 65.\r\nMedical aid by a physician or midwife was provided for about 99 percent\r\nof births in cities; in rural areas approximately 61 percent of births\r\nwere with medical assistance.\r\n\r\nThere were indications that some segments of the population, those in\r\nremote and most poverty-stricken areas, were in poor health. A 1968-69\r\nstudy of 1,580 children up to three years of age in thirteen northern\r\nlocalities, reported by the Ministry of Health, showed that 60 percent\r\nsuffered from neuromuscular disorders in various degrees and that 47\r\npercent suffered from rickets. The principal causes for these\r\nabnormalities, according to the official study, were malnutrition and\r\nunsatisfactory hygienic-sanitary conditions.\r\n\r\nHealth and medical organizations from national to local levels were\r\nunder the Ministry of Health. In the 1960s the departments of the\r\nministry were: epidemiology, pharmaceuticals, sanitary inspectorate,\r\nmedical prophylactic institutions, personnel, administration, finance,\r\nand planning. Data for 1968 reported by the minister of health listed\r\nfacilities countrywide as: 196 hospitals and other facilities with beds;\r\n11,922 beds for medical use; 1,108 first aid stations and polyclinics;\r\nand 36 dispensaries and tuberculosis centers. The average annual\r\nincrease in hospital beds from 1950 to 1968 was 323; in 1968 there was 1\r\nbed for every 169 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe total number of persons employed in health and medicine increased\r\nfrom 9,881 in 1960 to 14,370 in 1967. The numbers of professional and\r\nsemiskilled workers in 1969 were: physicians, 1,396; stomatologists\r\n(mouth specialists), 183; pharmacists, 262; medical aides, 725; dental\r\nassistants, 139; pharmacist assistants, 334; midwives, 1,091; nurses,\r\n4,100; and laboratory technicians, 737. Dentists were not listed as a\r\nseparate category. The average number of inhabitants per doctor in the\r\ndistricts was approximately 2,000; however, in two districts the average\r\nwas over 3,000, and in one, less than 1,000. All medical personnel were\r\nin government employ, and no private medical practice existed.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of medical services after World War II was made possible\r\nto a large extent by accelerated training programs. A school for\r\ntraining medical assistants was begun in 1948 and, starting in the early\r\n1950s, the Red Cross conducted courses for semiskilled medical workers.\r\nA medical college for training professional personnel was established in\r\n1952; in 1957 it became the Faculty of Medicine of the State University\r\nof Tirana, and the first doctors were graduated that year. During the\r\n1950s most physicians were trained in the Soviet Union. In the late\r\n1960s the number of persons undergoing training as midwives was\r\nincreased, and the goal was to have at least one midwife in every\r\nvillage by June 1971.\r\n\r\nThe use of mobile medical teams and equipment played a major role in\r\nexpanding and improving medical care in rural areas. Laboratory, X-ray,\r\nand other services once available only in the largest cities were\r\nestablished in the district and sometimes at lower levels. The regime,\r\nin its effort to build up agriculture in the mid-1960s, set as an\r\nobjective the improvement of living conditions in the countryside and\r\nthe elimination of the differential between city and country. Medical\r\nassistance to rural areas continued to increase in the late 1960s, but\r\nin late 1969 the minister of health stated that the differences between\r\nthe center and the districts and between the cities and the villages\r\nwere very pronounced. He directed that action be taken to lessen the gap\r\nbut added that differences would continue to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nNutrition\r\n\r\nFood supply--perennially a problem because of poor soil, primitive\r\nmethods of cultivation, and lack of readily accessible resources--did\r\nnot keep pace with population growth. For the late 1960s calorie intake\r\nper capita per day probably did not exceed 2,100 to 2,200, while the\r\nestimate for the mid-1950s was 2,200 to 2,300. The diet lacked protein\r\nand other protective elements. An estimated 80 percent or more of food\r\nintake was carbohydrates. Fruits and green vegetables were in short\r\nsupply, and meats were a real scarcity. Little progress had been made in\r\nincreasing livestock herds during the period of Communist rule, and\r\ncredits to procure adequate supplies of protective foods from sources\r\noutside the country were not available (see ch. 8, Economic System).\r\n\r\nThe diet generally depicted scarcity and, in the mountain and rural\r\nareas, was simple and routine. Dishes, high in starch content, made from\r\ncorn, wheat, rice, and potatoes were basic. Yogurt, cheese, and prepared\r\ndry beans were among the most commonly found other foods. Green\r\nvegetables and fruits appeared seasonally in limited quantities.\r\n\r\nWhile some progress has been made in improving sources of drinking\r\nwater, the vast majority of rural families, and some in the smaller\r\ncities, must rely on unprotected sources. Central sewage systems are\r\nfound in only the largest cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing\r\n\r\nLiving quarters became increasingly overcrowded as population expanded\r\nat consistently high rates. Party First Secretary Enver Hoxha stated in\r\nDecember 1967 that the entire country, especially urban areas, was\r\nexperiencing a housing crisis. Reports on housing construction indicated\r\nthat the situation further deteriorated in the late 1960s because of the\r\nnecessity to divert resources to even higher priorities, to the building\r\nof industry and procurement of food and clothing. War and natural\r\ncatastrophes added to the burden. In World War II some 35,000 dwellings\r\nwere destroyed. Earthquakes in November and December of 1967 demolished\r\n3,500 homes. In April 1969, when 6,500 buildings were damaged or\r\ndestroyed by earthquakes, additional thousands of homes had to be\r\nreplaced or repaired.\r\n\r\nHoxha stated in late 1969 that 185,000 flats and houses had been built\r\nsince World War II. The average annual rate of construction, as\r\nindicated by incomplete reports for the 1960s, was 6,000 private\r\ndwellings and 3,000 state-owned and cooperative apartment units. Total\r\nrequirements were not stated, but with annual population growth at\r\napproximately 40,000 to 50,000 persons, and considering reports relating\r\nto crowded conditions, the critical condition was unresolved. Hoxha\r\nstated in late 1967 that the housing situation had reached the point\r\nwhere in some instances five persons were living in one room.\r\n\r\nMost rural houses are of one or two rooms, with a hearth, and are of\r\nsimple construction. They are small and sparsely furnished. Many are\r\nmade of natural rock or stones. Urban houses and apartments are usually\r\nsmall and lack central heating. Kitchen and toilet facilities in\r\napartments must be shared by three or four families.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial Insurance\r\n\r\nThe social insurance program is administered by state organizations and\r\ncovers medical care, compensation for incapacities, old-age pensions,\r\nfamily allowances, and rest and recreation. Social insurance was\r\nintroduced in 1947. Several modifications were made later to the basic\r\nprogram. The law of 1953 provided a program closely resembling that of\r\nthe Soviet Union, and for a number of years, following the Soviet\r\nexample, trade unions administered a large number of social insurance\r\nactivities. In 1965 the state assumed the administration of all phases\r\nexcept those for rest and recreation facilities.\r\n\r\nThe social insurance program, as provided for in the Council of\r\nMinisters decision of September 13, 1966, and effective January 1, 1967,\r\nincluded benefits for workers, employees, and others. Peasants in the\r\ncollectives were not included in this law, but similar welfare benefits\r\nwere provided from funds established by their organizations. The 1966\r\nlaw continued the policy announced in 1964 that free medical care was\r\nprovided to everyone. Drugs, such as penicillin and antibiotics, and\r\nvitamins prescribed during outpatient treatment had to be paid for by\r\nthe user. Funds for social insurance payments came from the state\r\nbudget. Contributions were paid by state institutions and enterprises\r\nthat were in the role of employers.\r\n\r\nWorkers who became incapacitated and had over ten years of work credit\r\nreceived payments at the rate of 85 percent of the average wage for the\r\nlast month worked; persons with less than ten years' service received 70\r\npercent, except that temporary or seasonal workers were given less. When\r\ndisability resulted directly from work, pay was given at the rate of 95\r\npercent for most trades and 100 percent for persons working in mines.\r\nCompensation was less when incapacity resulted from an accident\r\nunrelated to work. Payments under these circumstances depended on age\r\nand years of work credit. Veterans who served in the Army of National\r\nLiberation before May 1944 and some of the Party elite were allowed an\r\nextra 10 percent when incapacitated (see ch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nPregnant women were given eighty-four days' leave under normal\r\ncircumstances and 95 percent of their monthly wage if they had worked\r\nover five years. They received 75 percent if they had worked less than\r\nfive years. Workers could remain at home for limited periods to care for\r\nthe sick and receive 60 percent of their pay. When children under seven\r\nyears of age were ill, the worker was permitted up to ten days' leave\r\nduring a three-month period. A subsidy, a one-time payment, of 280 leks\r\nwas provided for each child. Upon the death of a family head or his\r\nspouse, 300 leks were provided for funeral expenses.\r\n\r\nOld-age pensions were based on age and years of work. Payments were\r\ncomputed at the rate of 70 percent of the worker's average monthly wage.\r\nThe minimum pension was 350 leks, and the maximum was 900 leks per\r\nmonth; two exceptions were veterans of the Army of National Liberation\r\nwho served before May 1944 and Party leaders, who were awarded an\r\nadditional 10 percent. Women who reared six or more children to the age\r\nof eight were permitted to retire at age 50 when they completed fifteen\r\nyears of work, instead of the usual requirement of twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWages and Prices\r\n\r\nThe limited data available indicated that in early 1966 factory and\r\nmanual workers received 400 to 800 leks in wages per month. Skilled\r\nworkers were paid 400 to 1,500 leks, and senior officials received up to\r\n1,500 leks per month. After the reduction in the size of the bureaucracy\r\nwas announced in late 1966, the maximum for officials was reduced to\r\n1,200.\r\n\r\nPrices in leks per pound for foodstuffs in 1966 were approximately as\r\nfollows: bread, 1 to 2, depending on type; flour, 2 to 2.5; sugar, 4.5;\r\nbeans, 3 to 4.5; beef, 6.5; and lamb, 8.5. Prices for other\r\ncommodities, in leks, were as follows: a man's suit, 400 to 1,300; a\r\npair of men's shoes, 120 to 200; radio, 500 to 2,400; and a bicycle, 800\r\nto 1,300.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1960s the consumer continued to feel the squeeze of the\r\ndrive for greater economic self-sufficiency and the priority given to\r\nthe building of means of production. Despite announcements of greater\r\nbenefits to the worker, the average citizen in early 1970 continued to\r\npay approximately 90 percent of his income for food and shelter. Basic\r\ncommodities and foodstuffs were in short supply, and waiting in line at\r\ndistribution points was required to obtain the most commonly used items.\r\nManufactured items were generally of poor quality. Automobiles were\r\nowned by the government only, and bicycles, a status symbol, were\r\navailable to only a few.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nSOCIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Communist regime was still striving in 1970 to alter the traditional\r\ntribal and semifeudal social patterns of the country and to restructure\r\nthe whole system to fit Marxist-Leninist principles of a socialist\r\nsociety. Until after World War II the strongest loyalties of the people\r\nhad been toward family and larger kin groups, which have been the most\r\nimportant units in Albanian society. Kin groups had been held together\r\nby strong spirit and loyalties, as well as by economic factors. The head\r\nof the family, usually the eldest male member, historically exercised\r\npatriarchal authority, with general responsibility for the welfare and\r\nsafety of the members. In this patriarchal society, respect for parental\r\nauthority was dominant.\r\n\r\nLocal autonomy and suspicion of central authority had for centuries been\r\na way of life for Albanian society. This way of life persisted until the\r\ntwentieth century, despite the foreign cultural and political influences\r\nto which the society was subjected during the long domination by the\r\nOttoman Turks.\r\n\r\nOf particular social importance during this domination was the\r\nconversion of the majority of the people to the Islamic faith. Even\r\nbefore this conversion, however, the people had been segmented by the\r\nschism between the Roman and Eastern Orthodox churches. The people in\r\nthe north were usually Roman Catholic, and those in the south, Eastern\r\nOrthodox. Tolerance, however, has been a marked feature of the people\r\nand, accordingly, religious divisiveness has had no great effect on the\r\ntribal and semifeudal structure of the society. Indeed, the three\r\nreligious faiths in the country--Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Eastern\r\nOrthodox--have represented traditional loyalties rather than living\r\ncreeds for the Albanians.\r\n\r\nUntil the Communist takeover in 1944, there had been two broad social\r\nclasses in the country, an upper and a lower class. The upper class was\r\ncomposed of the landowning _beys_ (see Glossary); some _bajraktars_\r\n(relatively well-to-do tribal chieftains); and a smaller number of rich\r\nChristian farmers, merchants, small industrialists, some intellectuals,\r\nand the higher clergy. The lower class, amounting to about 90 percent of\r\nthe population, was composed of a small group of workers, the peasant\r\nmasses, livestock breeders, and the lower clergy.\r\n\r\nThe Communist regime's political, social, and economic measures aimed at\r\nredirecting the traditional social patterns have resulted in more social\r\ntransformations than at any time since the Turkish invasions in the\r\nfifteenth century. Collectivization of agriculture, industrialization\r\nand the consequent migration from rural to industrial areas, and a\r\nwidespread educational system have done much to transform the tribal\r\ncharacter of the society.\r\n\r\nAlthough in 1970 the patriarchal system was still a way of life in the\r\ncountryside, especially in the highlands, the authority of the master of\r\nthe house had been considerably reduced. Marriage customs in particular\r\nhad changed. As a result, the position of the close-knit family had been\r\naltered. Radical changes had occurred also in the life of women. Many of\r\nthem have had to work outside the home to compensate for the generally\r\nlow wages of their husbands. Day-care nurseries had been set up to make\r\nit easier for mothers to work and also to give the regime an early\r\nopportunity to indoctrinate the children.\r\n\r\nDespite such transformation, however, the family was still the most\r\nsignificant unit in the society. The allegiance given to the family,\r\ncoupled with the individualism characteristic of the people and the\r\ntraditions of political autonomy in local affairs, had made it difficult\r\nfor the regime to fully implement its policies for restructuring the\r\nsociety in general and the family in particular.\r\n\r\nReflecting the influence of the standard Marxist-Leninist dogma, the\r\nregime officially recognized only two classes--one composed of workers\r\nand considered the leading class and the other consisting of the working\r\npeasants, a third group usually being referred to as the people's\r\nintelligentsia. Actually, a distinct new upper class, constituting less\r\nthan 10 percent of the total population, emerged under Communist rule to\r\nreplace the upper ruling and middle classes that existed before the\r\nCommunist takeover. This new upper class was composed of the top ruling\r\nelite that controlled all facets of society and its supporting echelons,\r\nmade up of officials of the Party and state apparatus; mass\r\norganizations; and professional and technical people, such as doctors,\r\nlawyers, engineers, and managers of state enterprises.\r\n\r\nMembership in the Party or sympathy toward communism was the chain that\r\nlinked this upper class together. All its segments had benefited from\r\nthe Communist system, having enjoyed considerable advantages over the\r\nrest of the population; they formed practically the only social group\r\nwith a vested interest in the perpetuation of the system. The rest of\r\nthe population--peasants, workers, and remnants of the upper and middle\r\nclasses--were only cogs in the Communist apparatus, all used for the\r\npurpose of implementing the Party policies for the building of a\r\nCommunist society.\r\n\r\nUnder Communist rule the stabilization of the class differentiations had\r\nlessened social mobility both upward and downward. In 1970 it was\r\ndifficult to alter one's social status except through a long process of\r\ntraining and education. Educational opportunities, however, had been\r\ngreatly expanded, although they were still limited in the rural areas.\r\nThe best opportunities were offered to the children of the Party elite\r\nand Party faithful. But because of the great demand for qualified\r\npersonnel to manage the growing socialist sectors of the economy, some\r\nchildren of worker and peasant backgrounds had opportunities to continue\r\ntheir education to the highest levels and to fully develop their\r\nabilities and capacities. The whole educational system, however, was\r\ngeared to the demands of the Party, and its first objective was the\r\ninculcation of the youth with Communist ideology.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most radical change in the whole social system had been\r\neffected in the area of religion. By 1970 the country's three principal\r\nreligious faiths had been eliminated as organizational bodies. All\r\nchurches and mosques had been closed; the clergy was not permitted to\r\nfunction; and the country had been declared by the official media to be\r\nthe first atheist nation in the world. Top Party and government\r\nofficials admitted, however, that the closing of the houses of worship\r\nand the action against the clergy had not eliminated the religious\r\nfeelings and beliefs of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADITIONAL SOCIAL PATTERNS AND VALUES\r\n\r\nThe social structure of the country was until the 1930s basically tribal\r\nin the north and semifeudal in the central and southern regions. The\r\nhighlanders in the north retained intact their medieval tribal pattern\r\nof life until well into the twentieth century and were considered the\r\nlast peoples in Europe to preserve tribal autonomy. In the central and\r\nsouthern regions, however, increasing contact with the outside world and\r\ninvasions and occupations by foreign armies had reduced the tribes to\r\ntenure peasants.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, there have been two major groupings or sub-cultures in\r\nthe country: the Gegs in the north, probably numbering slightly over\r\nhalf the total population, and the Tosks in the south. Although the\r\nterms _Geg_ and _Tosk_ have disappeared from the vocabulary because they\r\nconnote division rather than Communist unity, Tirana officials and the\r\npress have often implied in recent years that the old differences and\r\ncontrasts between the two groups still existed. These differences were\r\nmarked not only in the physical appearance of the people and in dialect\r\nbut also in the way of life in general.\r\n\r\nThe Gegs, partly Roman Catholic but mostly Muslim, lived until after\r\nWorld War II in a mountain society characterized by blood feuds and\r\nfierce clan and tribal loyalties. The Tosks, on the other hand, were\r\nconsidered more civilized because of centuries of Greek and other\r\nforeign influences. Coming under the grip of the Muslim landed\r\naristocracy, the Tosks lost the spirit of individuality and independence\r\nenjoyed for centuries by the Gegs, especially in the highlands.\r\n\r\nUntil the end of World War II society in the north and, to a much lesser\r\nextent, in the south was organized in terms of kinship and descent. The\r\nbasic unit of society was the extended family, usually composed of a\r\ncouple, their married sons, the wives and children of married sons, and\r\nany unmarried daughters. The extended family formed a single residential\r\nand economic entity held together by common ownership of means of\r\nproduction and common interest in defense of the group. Such families\r\noften included scores of persons, and as late as 1944 some contained as\r\nmany as sixty to seventy persons living in a cluster of huts surrounding\r\nthe father's house.\r\n\r\nExtended families were grouped into clans, the chiefs of which\r\npreserved, until the end of World War II, patriarchal powers over the\r\nmembers of the entire group. The clan chief arranged marriages, assigned\r\ntasks, settled disputes, and decided what courses should be followed in\r\nsuch basic issues as blood feuds and politics. Descent was traced from a\r\ncommon ancestor through the male line, and brides were usually chosen\r\nfrom outside the clan. Clans in turn were grouped into tribes.\r\n\r\nIn the Tosk regions of the south the extended family was also the most\r\nimportant social unit, although patriarchal authority had been diluted\r\nby the feudal conditions imposed by the _beys_. The clan and tribal\r\nsystems had disappeared at a much earlier period in the south and were\r\nretained into the mid-twentieth century only among the northern\r\nhighlanders.\r\n\r\nLeadership of society in the lowlands was concentrated in the hands of\r\nsemifeudal tribal _beys_ and _pashas_ (see Glossary). The general Tirana\r\nregion, for example, was controlled by the Zogolli, Toptani, and Vrioni\r\nfamilies, all being Muslim _pashas_ or _beys_ and all owning extensive\r\nagricultural estates. Ahmet Zogu, subsequently King Zog I, was from the\r\nZogolli family. Originally the _pasha_ class ranked slightly higher than\r\nthat of the _bey_, but differences gradually diminished and all members\r\nwere called _beys_. In the northern highlands the _bajraktars_ were the\r\ncounterparts of the _beys_ and enjoyed similar hereditary rights to\r\ntitles and positions.\r\n\r\nThe Geg clans put great importance on marriage traditions. Marriage\r\ncustoms and prohibitions designed to perpetuate these traditions were\r\nstill practiced at the end of World War II. According to the custom a\r\nyoung man from a given clan always married a young woman from outside\r\nthe clan but from within the same tribe. In some tribes marriages\r\nbetween Christians and Muslims were tolerated even before the advent of\r\nthe Communist regime, but as a rule such marriages were frowned upon.\r\n\r\nA variety of offenses against women served as an igniting spark for\r\nblood feuds. Many girls were engaged to marry in their infancy by their\r\nparents. If later the girl did not wish to marry the man whom the\r\nparents had chosen for her and married another, in all likelihood a\r\nblood feud would ensue. Among the Tosks, religious beliefs and customs,\r\nrather than clan and tribal traditions, were more important in\r\nregulating marriages.\r\n\r\nThe family had for centuries presented the basic, most important unit in\r\nthe social structure of the country. One aspect of this was the deep\r\ndevotion of a person to his parents and family. This feeling took a\r\nstriking form because the family was a social unit occupying to a great\r\nextent the place of the state. Children were brought up to respect their\r\nelders and, above all, their father, whose word was law in the confines\r\nof his family.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the father the authority of the family devolved upon\r\nthe oldest male of the family. The females of the household, with the\r\nexception of the mother, occupied an inferior position. The unwritten\r\nlaw of family life was based on the assumption that a daughter was part\r\nof the family until she married. When the time came for sons to set up\r\ntheir own households, all parental property was equally divided among\r\nthem; the females did not share in this division.\r\n\r\nGeographical conditions affected Tosk social organization. The region's\r\naccessibility led to its coming much more firmly under Turkish rule.\r\nThis rule in turn resulted in the breakup of the large, independent\r\nfamily-type units and their replacement by large estates owned by\r\npowerful Muslim landowners, each with his own retinues, fortresses, and\r\nlarge numbers of tenant peasants to work the lands. Their allegiance to\r\nthe sultans in the period before 1912 was secured by the granting of\r\nadministrative positions either at home or elsewhere in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe large estates were usually confined to the plains, but the process\r\nof their consolidation was a continuing one. Landowning _beys_ would get\r\npeasants into their debt and thus establish themselves as semifeudal\r\npatrons of formerly independent villagers. In this way a large Muslim\r\naristocracy developed in the south, whose life style was in marked\r\ncontrast both to that of the chieftains of the highlands in the north\r\nand to that of the peasantry, the majority of whom assumed the\r\ncharacteristics of an oppressed social class. As late as the 1930s\r\ntwo-thirds of the rich land in central and southern parts of the country\r\nbelonged to the large landowners.\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp contrast between the tribal society of the Geg\r\nhighlanders and the passive, oppressed Tosk peasantry, living mostly on\r\nthe large estates of the _beys_ and often represented in the political\r\nfield by the _beys_ themselves. This semifeudal society in the south\r\nsurvived well into the twentieth century because of the lack of a strong\r\nmiddle class. After independence in 1912, however, a small Tosk middle\r\nclass began to develop, which in the 1920-24 period, having common\r\ninterests with the more enlightened _beys_, played a major role in\r\nattempts to create a modern society. But the advent of Zogu in 1925 as a\r\nstrong ruler put an end to Tosk influence and, from that time until the\r\nItalian invasion in 1939, Zog cemented his power in the tribal north by\r\ngoverning through a number of strong tribal and clan chiefs. To secure\r\nthe loyalty of these chiefs, he placed them on the government payroll\r\nand sent several of them back to their tribes with the military rank of\r\ncolonel.\r\n\r\nIn the 1939-44 period general anarchy prevailed throughout the country,\r\nand in the north the tribal chieftains assumed their old independent\r\npositions. The three major resistance movements that developed during\r\nWorld War II represented the principal social classes then in existence\r\nin the country. The Communist-dominated National Liberation Movement was\r\ncomposed chiefly of low-level Tosk intellectuals and bureaucrats, some\r\nlabor leaders, and a few chieftains from the Geg areas, such as Haxhi\r\nLeshi, who was head of state in 1970. The movement derived its main\r\nsupport from the small working class and the poor peasants.\r\n\r\nThe nationalist Balli Kombetar (National Front) was composed of\r\nnationalist _beys_ and Orthodox intellectuals and derived its support\r\nfrom well-to-do peasants, merchants, and businessmen. The Legality\r\nMovement, a pro-Zog organization, was headed by a chieftain from Mat,\r\nand its supporters were confined to that region. Farther north the\r\nresistance groups were led by the local chieftains, such as Muharem\r\nBajraktari and Gani bey Kryeziu. The collaborators with the Italian\r\nauthorities were composed of reactionary _beys_, Geg chieftains (both\r\nMuslim and Catholic), and a small group of intellectuals that had\r\nembraced the fascist ideology. This group had little or no popular\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL STRATIFICATION UNDER COMMUNIST RULE\r\n\r\nThe general class structure of the country at the advent of the\r\nCommunist regime in 1944 consisted of the peasants and workers making up\r\nthe lower class and a small upper class. The peasants represented over\r\n80 percent of the total population, most of whom lived at or below\r\nsubsistence level. Chiefly because of the old grievances against the\r\nlandowning _beys_ and the promises made by the National Liberation\r\nMovement (which presented itself as a purely patriotic, democratic\r\nmovement for agrarian reforms), a large number of peasants, especially\r\nthe tenant and landless ones, sided with the movement (see ch. 1,\r\nGeneral Character of the Society).\r\n\r\nNonagricultural workers numbered about 30,000 persons, most of whom\r\nworked in mines and in the small handicraft industries. The movement\r\nfound strong support from this group also. The upper class comprised\r\nprofessional people and intellectuals; medium and small merchants;\r\nmoneylenders; and well-to-do artisans, whose capital was invested mostly\r\nin trade, commerce, and the Italian industrial concessions. The\r\nindustrialists also belonged to this class; they owned very small\r\nindustries and workshops. Both the _beys_ and the tribal chiefs of the\r\nnorth had been somewhat reduced in importance politically and\r\neconomically during Zog's rule, but it was chiefly from these two groups\r\nthat Zog created the ruling elite that helped him to control the country\r\nuntil the Italian invasion in 1939.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the three religious denominations did not form a distinct\r\nsocial group. The higher clergy was intellectual and upper class in\r\nstructure; it supported the ruling elite but did not mix in politics\r\nafter Bishop Fan Noli, leader of a short-lived reformist government, was\r\ndriven out of the country in 1924. The income from the fairly extensive\r\nchurch estates and the state subsidies provided a good, but not\r\nluxurious, living for the higher clergy. The rank-and-file clergy,\r\nhowever, were derived from peasant origins, and most of their parishes\r\nwere as impoverished as the peasant households they served.\r\n\r\nThe events immediately preceding and following the Communist seizure of\r\npower forebode the doom not only of the _beys_ and tribal chiefs but\r\nalso of most of the upper class and intellectuals, who had refused to\r\ncollaborate with the National Liberation Movement. In the summer and\r\nfall of 1944, while civil war was raging between the Communist-controlled\r\npartisan formations and anti-Communist bands, nearly all the influential\r\n_beys_ and _bajraktars_ either fell in battle or fled the country; those\r\nwho remained were quickly rounded up by the Communist security forces\r\nand subsequently tried as \"enemies of the people\" (see ch. 2, Historical\r\nSetting).\r\n\r\nThe whole leadership of the two nationalist organizations, the Balli\r\nKombetar and the Legality Movement, fled to Italy. Influential patriots\r\nand intellectuals who had remained neutral during the so-called War of\r\nNational Liberation but who were considered potentially dangerous to the\r\nCommunist regime were apprehended and tried en masse in the spring of\r\n1945. Some were executed; others were sent to labor camps, where most of\r\nthem died from malnutrition and lack of medical care.\r\n\r\nA new Communist social order was legally instituted in the country with\r\nthe adoption of the first Communist Constitution in March 1946, which\r\ncreated a \"state of workers and laboring peasants.\" The various\r\nconstitutional articles dealing with the new social order abolished all\r\nranks and privileges that had derived from reasons of origin (such as\r\nthe tribal chiefs and the _beys_), position, wealth, or cultural\r\nstanding. All citizens were considered equal regardless of nationality,\r\nrace, or religion.\r\n\r\nMarriage and family were brought under the strict control of the state,\r\nwhich determined by law the conditions of marriage and the family.\r\nMarriages could be considered legal only when contracted before\r\ncompetent state organs, and only state courts had jurisdiction on all\r\nmatters connected with marriage. Included in the 1946 Constitution also\r\nwas the Marxist tenet \"from each according to his ability and to each\r\naccording to his work.\" Subsequent revisions to the Constitution gave\r\nlegal sanction to the existing situation that the Party and its members\r\nwere the leading, or vanguard, group in the country.\r\n\r\n_E Drejta Kushtetuese e Republikes Popullore te Shqiperise_ (The\r\nConstitutional Right in the People's Republic of Albania), published in\r\n1963 by the Faculty of Jurisprudence of the State University of Tirana,\r\nstated that the War of National Liberation was actually class warfare, a\r\ncivil war whose purpose was as much national as it was social\r\nliberation--that is, the establishment of the \"people's power\" and the\r\n\"dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\r\n\r\nCommunist spokesmen listed three principal classes prevailing in the\r\nearly years of the regime: the working class, the laboring peasants,\r\nand, in their terms, the exploiting class, that is, the landowners in\r\nthe agricultural economy and the bourgeoisie in trade. The exploiting\r\nclass was liquidated through a rapid revolutionary process in the early\r\nstages of the regime. The middle and high bourgeoisie was destroyed as a\r\nresult of the nationalization of industry, transport, mines, and banks\r\nand the establishment of a state monopoly on foreign commerce and state\r\ncontrol over internal trade. The feudal landlords disappeared with the\r\napplication of the agrarian reforms in the 1945-47 period. These steps\r\nwere followed by a program of rapid industrialization, with the\r\nconsequent creation of a strong working class, and the collectivization\r\nof agriculture, supposedly resulting in the formation of a homogeneous\r\npeasant class.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the old class structure, the Communist regime\r\nclaimed that only two classes existed in the country, the workers and\r\nthe working peasants. A somewhat different social composition of the\r\npopulation, however, has been given by the government's statistical\r\nyearbooks, based on the last official census, taken in 1960. Under the\r\ntitle \"Social Composition of the Population,\" for instance, the 1965\r\nstatistical yearbook listed, in order, the following groups; workers,\r\nemployees (civil servants), collective and private farmers (officially\r\ncalled villagers), collective and individual artisans, collective and\r\nprivate traders, free professions, clergymen, and unemployed and unknown\r\n(see table 4).\r\n\r\nIn the 1967-70 period several of these groups disappeared. The\r\nindividual farmers were all collectivized; the artisan collectives were\r\nconverted to state industrial enterprises; the private traders, except\r\nthe peasant open markets, were reduced to a minimum, and members of the\r\nclergy were sent to work either in industrial plants or agricultural\r\ncollectives.\r\n\r\nThe number of families almost doubled in the 1945-60 period. In the\r\ncities they grew from 48,800 to 95,500 and in the countryside, from\r\n148,000 to 184,305. The greatest rate of increase, almost 8 percent,\r\noccurred during the 1950-55 period in the urban sector; this was\r\nattributed primarily to the creation of an industrial base.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the existing cities, especially the capital city of\r\nTirana, caused by the establishment of a number of industrial projects,\r\ndrew people from the rural regions into the urban centers. This new\r\nmigration was reinforced by the relocation of entire families. In\r\naddition, new family units were formed by the younger migrants once they\r\nsettled in the newly developing industrial centers. During the decade\r\nof the 1950s the trend was toward larger families.\r\n\r\n _Table 4.

P. Sh._, Tirana, 1968,\r\n pp. 74-77; and _Ekonomia Popullore_, Tirana, November to December 1965.\r\n\r\nAside from the workers and peasants, the only group to which the Tirana\r\nauthorities have continued to give special attention has been the\r\nso-called intelligentsia. Usually termed a layer or stratum of the new\r\nsocial order, the intelligentsia was considered, in 1970 to be a special\r\nsocial group because of the country's needs for professional, technical,\r\nand cultural manpower. To justify this special attention, the\r\nideologists have often quoted Lenin to the effect that \"the\r\nintelligentsia will remain a special stratum until the Communist society\r\nreaches its highest development.\"\r\n\r\nIn the development of the social structure under the Communist regime,\r\nbasic transformations have occurred in the social composition of the\r\nintelligentsia. This transformation, during the 1944-48 period, involved\r\nnot only the purging of a number of Western-educated intellectuals whom\r\nthe regime considered potentially dangerous but also some top Communist\r\nintellectuals who were suspected of having anti-Yugoslav or pro-Western\r\nfeelings. The remaining old intellectuals were reeducated and reoriented\r\nand were utilized for the preparation of new personnel for the\r\nbureaucracy and industry. Finally, a new intelligentsia was created,\r\nthoroughly imbued with the Communist ideology and recruited generally\r\nfrom among the children of the Party leaders, workers, and peasants.\r\n\r\nThe Communist regime created another social group at the bottom rung of\r\nthe ladder. This group was composed largely of elements of the upper\r\nclasses in existence before 1944. The tribulations of this class had by\r\n1970 reduced it to a small minority, some members of which were still\r\ninterned in forced labor camps. It was actually a class of outcasts,\r\ndiscriminated against politically, socially, and economically.\r\n\r\nMost of the members of this group were used as so-called volunteer\r\nlaborers on construction projects and in other menial tasks, and their\r\nchildren did not enjoy the same rights to higher education and other\r\nopportunities open to the other classes. Discriminatory measures against\r\nthis class continued to be taken in the late 1960s; in 1968, for\r\ninstance, the government passed a law prohibiting them from receiving\r\nmoney remittances or food and clothing packages from their relatives and\r\nfriends abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Communist assertion of the existence of only two social classes did\r\nnot correspond to the real class structure that prevailed in the country\r\nin 1970. In fact, there existed different classes and gradations of rank\r\nand privilege, beginning with an upper class, composed of the Party\r\nelite, leaders of the state and mass organizations, and the leading\r\nmembers of the armed and security forces. The top Party elite itself was\r\ncomposed of two distinct social groupings, the higher group consisting\r\nof the Political Bureau (Politburo) of eleven regular and five candidate\r\nmembers and the chiefs of the Directorates of the Central Committee the\r\nlower group being made up of the rank-and-file members of the Central\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nFamily connections played a key role in the composition of the Politburo\r\nin 1970. The top three families were those of First Party Secretary\r\nEnver Hoxha and his wife Nexhmije, who headed the Directorate of\r\nEducation and Culture in the Central Committee; Prime Minister Mehmet\r\nShehu and his wife, Fiqrete, who headed the top Party school; and Party\r\nSecretary Hysni Kapo and his wife, Vito, who headed the politically and\r\nideologically important women's organization. General Kadri\r\nHasbiu--minister of interior, head of the security forces, and a\r\nPolitburo candidate member--was a brother-in-law of Mehmet Shehu.\r\nSimilar family relationships existed between the other Politburo\r\nmembers. About half of the sixty-one members of the Central Committee\r\nwere also related.\r\n\r\nJust below the Politburo and the Central Committee were the vast Party\r\nand government bureaucracy, professional people and intellectuals, and\r\nmanagers of state industrial and agricultural enterprises. There were\r\nsome basic social differences between the top Party elite and the lower\r\nParty functionaries and state officials in terms of privileges,\r\ninfluence, authority, and responsibility. This group of lower Party and\r\nstate officials was bound together by the economic privileges and\r\nprestige that went with their positions and membership in, or sympathy\r\nfor, the Party; they all benefited from the regime and enjoyed\r\neducational and economic advantages denied the rest of the population.\r\nBelow this group were the rank-and-file Party members, whose leadership\r\nrole was constitutionally guaranteed. Aside from the prestige enjoyed as\r\nParty members, however, their privileges and economic benefits did not\r\ndiffer much from the next class in Communist structure of Albanian\r\nsociety, namely the workers.\r\n\r\nConstituting about 15 percent of the total population, the working\r\nclass, styled by the regime as the leading class, was created mostly\r\nafter the Communist seizure of power and was composed almost wholly of\r\npeasant stock. This group, probably more so than the peasant masses, has\r\nbeen under constant pressure to work harder, to produce more, and to\r\nwork longer, often even after their normal schedules were completed.\r\nAlthough the regular work schedule was eight hours, workers were called\r\nupon to perform volunteer labor and to overfulfill norms. There was very\r\nlittle chance for rest and recreation.\r\n\r\nBefore 1967 the workers could take advantage of religious holidays,\r\nwhich provided some time for recreation, but since then all religious\r\nholidays have been banned. The only legal holidays were New Year's Day;\r\nRepublic Day, on January 11; May Day; Army Day, on July 10; and\r\nIndependence and Liberation Days, on November 28 and 29, respectively.\r\nThere were, however, a few local socialist holidays connected with the\r\nliberation of the areas by the partisan formations in 1944. The workers\r\nalso received two-week paid vacations annually.\r\n\r\nThe largest class, that of the peasants, represented about two-thirds of\r\nthe total population and, according to Communist dogma, was allied with\r\nthe working class and led by it. The regime's policy of complete\r\nagricultural collectivization has been distressing for the peasant\r\nclass. A lover of his land, irrespective of its size, and of his\r\nindependence, the peasant was deprived of his farmland, except for a\r\ntiny plot, and herded into a collective. His income in the collective\r\nwas only on the subsistence level. Collective peasants were called upon\r\nto perform 300 to 350 workdays a year.\r\n\r\nA constant complaint of the regime has been that the peasants have not\r\nbeen \"freed from the psychology of the small owner, the concept of\r\nprivate property.\" As of 1970 there were actually no social differences\r\nbetween the workers and peasants because nearly all the workers were of\r\npeasant stock and still had close ties with relatives in their native\r\nvillages, and indeed some workers continued to keep their families in\r\nthe villages.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adoption of the Constitution in 1946, a number of laws\r\nwere adopted regulating marriage and divorce. The law on marriage,\r\nadopted in 1948, provided that marriages had to be contracted before an\r\nofficial of the local People's Council, and strong penalties were\r\nprescribed for any clergyman performing a religious ceremony before a\r\ncivil ceremony had taken place. The legal age for contracting marriage\r\nwas set at eighteen for both sexes, but persons as young as sixteen\r\nyears of age could enter into marriage with the permission of the\r\npeople's court. In such cases the minors did not need parental consent,\r\nand the law considered them \"emancipated.\"\r\n\r\nMarriage was based on the full equality of rights of both spouses. Thus\r\nthe concept of the head of the family, recognized by pre-Communist civil\r\nlaw and so important for Albanian family life, was eliminated. Each of\r\nthe spouses, according to the 1948 law, had the right to choose his or\r\nher own occupation, profession, and residence. Marriage with foreigners\r\nwas prohibited unless entered into by permission of the government.\r\n\r\nThe laws on divorce were designed to facilitate and speed up divorce\r\nproceedings. The separation of spouses was made a ground for divorce\r\nunder the law, and in such cases a court could grant a divorce without\r\nconsidering related facts or the causes of the separation. The basic\r\ndivorce law, which was originally passed in 1948 and, after some\r\nmodifications, was still in effect in 1970, provided that each spouse\r\nmay ask for divorce on grounds on incompatibility of character,\r\ncontinued misunderstandings, irreconcilable hostility, or for any other\r\nreason that disrupted marital relations to the point where a common\r\nmarital life had become impossible. Certain crimes committed by the\r\nspouse, especially political crimes, the so-called crimes against the\r\nstate, and crimes involving moral turpitude, were also made causes for\r\ndivorce.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950-64 period the total number of marriages averaged about\r\n12,000 annually, except in 1961, when 18,725 marriages were registered;\r\nfor the whole fourteen-year period marriages averaged about 7.8 per\r\n1,000 population annually. During the same period there were about 1,000\r\ndivorces a year in the whole country; this represented about 0.2\r\npercent of the total married population.\r\n\r\nThe problems still facing the Communist regime in its efforts to change\r\nthe traditional character of society, especially in the countryside,\r\nwere highlighted in a strong editorial in the February 8, 1970, issue of\r\n_Zeri i Popullit_ (The Voice of the People), the Party's official daily.\r\nAccording to the article, the most dangerous antisocial phenomenon in\r\nthe social life of the country was patriarchalism. This phenomenon was\r\nparticularly strong in the mountainous north where it was firmly\r\nentrenched and involved people from rank-and-file villagers to Party\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe basic difficulty derived from the fact that the local Communist\r\nleaders entertained patriarchal notions about the Party; they considered\r\nthe Party organization as one in which they found a reincarnation of the\r\nclan. There was a tendency therefore for the Communists to admit to the\r\nParty organization people from their own _bajrak_, or clan, in order to\r\nhave a dominant position in, and exercise command over, such socialist\r\norganizations as agricultural collectives. In a Party organization the\r\nhead of one _bajrak_ was put in command so that he could rule over the\r\nother, just as if he were the head of the clan. As in the old clan\r\nsociety, quarrels often occurred in basic Party Organizations when one\r\n_bajraktar_ attempted to wrest control of the organization from another.\r\n\r\nEntrance into the Party was considered by the patriarchal-minded\r\nhighlanders as penetration into places where they could enjoy privileges\r\nand prestige. A similar situation prevailed in the agricultural\r\ncollectives, in which the presidents of the collectives, imbued with the\r\ntraditional idea of chieftainship, behaved toward the property of the\r\ncollectives as if it were their own. The problems of the collectives\r\nwere not submitted to either the basic Party organizations or to the\r\ngeneral assembly of the collective. According to official criticism,\r\neverything was settled in the \"clan style, in the spirit of family\r\ninterest, of the clan, of the entity, precisely because they formed a\r\nfamily within which defense and support of their interests, right or\r\nwrong, had become the rule.\"\r\n\r\nEnver Hoxha stated in a speech in 1968 that the position of the\r\nsecretary of the Party organization or of an agricultural collective was\r\nconsidered in many areas as inheritable, just as the chieftainship in\r\nthe tribal society has been inherited. The difficulties faced by the\r\nregime's attempts to eradicate the persistent patriarchal notions were\r\nsuccinctly phrased by Hoxha in his address to the Democratic Front\r\nCongress in September 1967. Declaring that the social problems in the\r\ncountry were complex in the towns and more so in the countryside, he\r\nlamented the fact that the rural areas:\r\n\r\n      have their own written and especially unwritten laws, which\r\n      are often expressed in various regressive and harmful\r\n      customs, in norms that are alien to our Communist morals.\r\n      These are very dangerous and obstinate; they insistently\r\n      resist the new and are liquidated with difficulty. These\r\n      customs and norms have their own economic, ideological,\r\n      religious, and ethical basis; they have their own class\r\n      roots from capitalism to feudalism, indeed from the _bajrak_\r\n      and the tribe.\r\n\r\nIn an obvious effort to root out some of the old prevailing customs and\r\ntraditions, the Party inaugurated in 1967 a movement aimed at\r\nrevolutionizing the family and, in Party jargon, liberating it from the\r\nremnants of bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology. The targets have\r\nbeen directed toward the youth, both boys and girls. In resolutions\r\nadopted by the Party's Central Committee it was charged that in some\r\nfamilies, because of the conservative and patriarchal mentality of the\r\nparents, the children were still not allowed to participate in parental\r\nconversations, especially the girls, on the pretext that they were too\r\nyoung and immature.\r\n\r\nDiscussions on morals, such as relations between boys and girls, love,\r\nand the creation of a socialist family, were particularly limited. It\r\nwas the parents' view that they should not discuss such things with\r\ntheir children since this would undermine the traditional respect and\r\nauthority of the parents. As stated in the January 30, 1970, issue of\r\n_Zeri i Popullit_, the need to strengthen the struggle against alien\r\nconcepts that still plagued families became clearer when one considered\r\nsome negative concepts that were evident in young people. Families of\r\nintellectuals were particularly singled out for criticism because,\r\naccording to the Party journal, they manifested liberal attitudes in\r\ntheir attempts to satisfy every petty bourgeois craving and desire of\r\ntheir children; they instilled in them their own intellectual tendencies\r\nand fed and dressed them beyond their means.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the Party's failure to detach the people completely from\r\ntheir traditional habits and customs was forcefully presented by the\r\nParty in a book published in 1968 under the title _Party Basic\r\nOrganizations for Further Revolutionizing the Life of the Country_. It\r\nwas freely admitted that much remained to be done in the struggle to\r\nemancipate the women and to draw boys and girls from the tutelage of\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\nWhen the wife of a Party member decided to join the Party, for example,\r\nher husband addressed a note to the secretary of the basic Party\r\norganization saying that should the secretary enroll his wife in the\r\nParty, he would be destroying a family because he could not possibly\r\nlive with his wife on an equal basis. Similarly, when a woman in a\r\nvillage was proposed as a member of the council of the agricultural\r\ncollective, her brother-in-law objected strenuously, saying that her\r\ncandidacy should be rejected since it was advanced without obtaining his\r\npermission as the head of the family and that in any case the \"men of\r\nthat family were not yet dead.\"\r\n\r\nIn a village in Kruje the first woman to become a Party candidate was\r\nasked to leave the Party because she did not belong to the same clan to\r\nwhich the Party secretary belonged. In another case, when a candidate\r\nwas proposed for Party membership, someone reportedly stated that \"we\r\nmust enlist one from our clan also\" in order to maintain the clan\r\nequilibrium in the Party.\r\n\r\nThe problem of social and family relations was still a major concern for\r\nthe regime at the end of 1969. For example, in a major speech on family\r\nand social relations in November 1969, Hysni Kapo, the third-ranking man\r\nin the Party hierarchy, blamed the class enemy for the slow progress the\r\nParty had registered in creating a new social structure. The class\r\nenemy, Kapo admitted, was found everywhere, in and outside the Party,\r\nand it was striving hard to obstruct the path of socializing the family\r\nand emancipating the women.\r\n\r\nKapo bemoaned the fact that the men of the socialist society had not\r\nshaken off the vestiges of the past and that there were yet a large\r\nnumber of people who, with their behavior and actions at work, in\r\nsociety, and at home, were in contradiction to the requirements of the\r\npersonality of the new man in the socialist society. Villages,\r\nagricultural collectives, artisan and trade cooperatives, and work\r\ncenters daily faced such social problems as betrothals and marriages\r\nthat did not follow guidelines set by the Party, conservative attitudes\r\ntoward women and youth, and widespread tendencies toward clannishness.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kapo, there were a large number of Communists who made\r\nlittle effort to implement the Party social line because the customs\r\ninherited from the old society still existed in the minds and hearts of\r\nthe people and because the Party had been unable to divest people of all\r\nthat was \"hostile and reactionary and clothe them with the Party\r\nideology.\" Kapo considered the most disturbing feature of this state of\r\naffairs to be the religious and patriarchal aspects that prevented the\r\nyouth from creating a new socialist society and that continued to exist\r\neven among Communist cadres.\r\n\r\nWestern correspondents reporting from Tirana, in commenting on Kapo's\r\nspeech, stated that what actually disturbed the Party most was the\r\npersistent opposition of the parents to new social standards set by the\r\nParty to regulate and control family life in general and the life of the\r\nyouth in particular. Standards for dating, mixed Muslim-Christian\r\nmarriages, engagement of boys and girls within socially accepted classes\r\n(the aim being to isolate the children of the former upper classes), and\r\nworking and living together in various so-called volunteer construction\r\nprojects were objectionable to parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nPre-Communist Era\r\n\r\nAs late as the 1940s over 80 percent of the people were illiterate. The\r\nprincipal reason for this was that schools in the native language were\r\npractically nonexistent in the country before it became an independent\r\nstate in 1912. Until about the middle of the nineteenth century the\r\nOttoman rulers prohibited the use of the Albanian language in schools.\r\nThe Turkish language was used in the few schools that existed, mainly in\r\ncities and large towns, for the Muslim population. The schools for\r\nOrthodox Christian children were under the supervision of the Istanbul\r\nEcumenical Patriarchate. The teachers for these schools were usually\r\nrecruited from the Orthodox clergy, and the language of instruction, as\r\nwell as that used in textbooks, was Greek. The first known school to use\r\nthe native tongue in modern history was in a Franciscan seminary that\r\nwas opened in 1861 in Shkoder, where the Jesuits in 1877 founded a\r\nseminary in which the native tongue also was used.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two decades of the nineteenth century and the first\r\ndecade of the twentieth, a number of patriots who were striving to\r\ncreate a national consciousness founded several elementary schools in a\r\nfew cities and towns, mostly in the south, but they were closed by the\r\nTurkish authorities. The advent of the Young Turks movement in 1908\r\nencouraged the Albanian patriots to intensify their national efforts,\r\nand in the same year a group of intellectuals met in Monastir (Bitolj),\r\nYugoslavia, to formulate an Albanian alphabet. Books written in Albanian\r\nbefore that date used a mixture of alphabets, consisting mostly of a\r\ncombination of Latin, Greek, and Turkish-Arabic letters.\r\n\r\nThe Monastir meeting developed a unified alphabet based on Latin\r\nletters. As a result, a number of textbooks were written in the new\r\nalphabet, and elementary schools were soon opened in various parts of\r\nthe country. In 1909, to meet the demands for teachers able to teach in\r\nthe native tongue, a normal school was inaugurated in Elbasan. But in\r\n1910 the Young Turks, fearing the emergence of Albanian nationalism,\r\nclosed all schools that used Albanian as the language of instruction.\r\n\r\nEven after the country became independent, schools were scarce. The\r\nunsettled political conditions caused by the Balkan wars and World War I\r\nhindered the development of a unified educational system. The foreign\r\noccupying powers, however, opened some schools in their respective areas\r\nof occupation, each using its own language. A few of these schools,\r\nespecially the Italian and French, continued after the end of World War\r\nI and played a significant role in introducing Western educational\r\nmethods and principles. Of particular importance was the French Lycée in\r\nKorce, founded by the French army in 1817.\r\n\r\nSoon after the establishment of a national government in 1920, which\r\nincluded a Ministry of Education, the foundations were laid for a\r\nnational educational system. Elementary schools were opened in the\r\ncities and some of the larger towns, and the Italian and French schools\r\nopened during the war were strengthened. In the meantime, two important\r\nAmerican schools were founded--the American Technical School in Tirana,\r\nestablished by the American Junior Red Cross in 1921, and the American\r\nAgricultural School in Kavaje, sponsored by the Near East Foundation. An\r\nimportant girls' school was also founded by Kristo Dako, an\r\nAlbanian-American, whose teaching language was English. The two top\r\nleaders of the Country in 1970, Party First Secretary Enver Hoxha and\r\nPrime Minister Mehmet Shehu, were educated in these foreign schools;\r\nHoxha graduated from the French Lycée in 1930, and Shehu from the\r\nAmerican Technical School in 1932.\r\n\r\nIn the 1920s, the period when the real foundations of the modern\r\nAlbanian state were laid, education made considerable progress. In 1933\r\nthe Albanian Royal Constitution was amended, making the teaching and\r\neducating of citizens an exclusive right of the state. Education was\r\nthus nationalized, and all foreign-language schools, except the American\r\nAgricultural School, were either closed or nationalized. The reason for\r\nthis move was to stop the rapid spread of schools sponsored directly by\r\nthe Italian government, especially among the Catholic element in the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe nationalization of schools was followed in 1934 by a far-reaching\r\nreorganization of the whole school system. The new system provided for\r\nobligatory elementary education from the ages of four to fourteen; the\r\nexpansion of secondary schools of various kinds; the establishment of\r\nnew technical, vocational, and commercial secondary schools; and the\r\nacceleration and expansion of teacher training. The obligatory\r\nprovisions of the 1934 reorganization law, however, were never enforced\r\nin the rural areas because of the economic conditions of the peasants\r\nwho needed their children to work in the fields and because of the lack\r\nof schoolhouses, teachers, and means of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe only minority schools operating in the country before World War II\r\nwere those for the Greek minority of about 35,000 living in the\r\nprefecture of Gjirokaster. These schools too were closed by the\r\nconstitutional amendment of 1933, but Greece referred the case to the\r\nInternational Permanent Court of Justice, which forced Albania to reopen\r\nthe schools.\r\n\r\nThere was no university-level education in prewar Albania. All advanced\r\nstudies were pursued abroad. Every year the state granted a number of\r\nscholarships to deserving high school graduates who were economically\r\nunable to continue their education. But the largest number of students\r\nwere from well-to-do families and thus privately financed. For instance,\r\nin the 1936/37 academic year, only 65 of the 428 students attending\r\nuniversities abroad had state scholarships. The great majority of the\r\nstudents attended Italian universities because of geographic proximity\r\nand because of the special relationship between the Rome and Tirana\r\ngovernments. The Italian government itself, following its policy of\r\npolitical, economic, military, and cultural penetration of the country,\r\ngranted a number of scholarships to Albanian students recommended by its\r\nlegation in Tirana.\r\n\r\nThere are no reliable prewar statistics on school population. The\r\n1967-68 Albanian official statistical yearbook placed the total 1938/39\r\nschool enrollment at 56,283. Other sources placed it at over 60,000.\r\nSoon after the Italian occupation in April 1939 the educational system\r\ncame under complete Italian control. The Italian language was made\r\ncompulsory in all secondary schools, and fascist ideology and\r\norientation were inserted into the school curricula. After 1941,\r\nhowever, when guerrilla bands began to operate against the Italian\r\nforces, the whole educational system was paralyzed. In fact, secondary\r\nschools became centers of resistance and of guerrilla recruitment, and\r\nmany teachers and students went to the mountains and became members or\r\nleaders of resistance bands. By September 1943, when Italy capitulated\r\nand German troops occupied the country, education came to a complete\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation Under Communist Rule\r\n\r\nImmediately upon seizure of power in November 1944, the Communist regime\r\ngave high priority to opening the schools and organizing the whole\r\neducational system along Communist lines. The Communist objectives for\r\nthe new school system were to liquidate illiteracy in the country as\r\nsoon as possible, to struggle against \"bourgeois survivals\" in the\r\ncountry's culture, to transmit to the youth the ideas and principles of\r\nthe Party, and to educate the children of all classes of society on the\r\nbasis of these principles. The first Communist Constitution (1946) made\r\nit clear that the intention of the regime was to bring all children\r\nunder the control of the state. The state, constitutionally, took\r\nspecial care for the education of youth, and all schools were placed\r\nunder state management.\r\n\r\nThe Educational Reform Law of 1946 provided specifically that\r\nMarxist-Leninist principles would permeate all school texts. This law\r\nalso made the struggle against illiteracy a principal goal of the new\r\nschool system. A further step in this direction was taken in September\r\n1949, when the government promulgated a law requiring all illiterates\r\nbetween ages twelve and forty to attend classes in reading and writing.\r\nCourses for illiterate peasants were established by the education\r\nsections of the people's councils. The political organs in the armed\r\nforces provided parallel courses for its illiterate military personnel.\r\n\r\nThe 1946 education law, in addition to providing for seven-year\r\nobligatory schooling and four-year secondary education, called for the\r\nestablishment of a wide network of vocational, trade, and pedagogical\r\nschools to prepare personnel, technicians, and skilled workers for the\r\nvarious social, cultural, and economic fields. Another education law\r\nadopted in 1948 provided for the further expansion of vocational and\r\nprofessional courses to train skilled and semiskilled workers and to\r\nincrease the theoretical and professional knowledge of the technicians.\r\n\r\nA further step was taken in 1950 to expand technical education.\r\nSecondary technical schools were established along Soviet lines by the\r\nvarious economic ministries. In 1951 three higher institutes of learning\r\nwere founded: the Higher Pedagogic Institute, the Higher Polytechnical\r\nInstitute, and the Higher Agricultural Institute, all patterned along\r\nSoviet models. The Council of Ministers said that their purpose in\r\nfounding these institutes was to create conditions for further\r\ndevelopment \"according to the example of science, culture, and technique\r\nof the Soviet Union.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 1949-54 period the school system was given a thorough Soviet\r\norientation both ideologically and structurally. Most textbooks,\r\nespecially those dealing with scientific and technical matters, were\r\nSoviet translations. Soviet educators were attached to the major\r\nbranches of the Ministry of Education. The Russian language was made\r\ncompulsory as of the seventh grade, and Soviet methodology was applied.\r\nLarge numbers of students and teachers were sent to Soviet pedagogical\r\nschools for study and training.\r\n\r\nCourses for teacher preparation were established in which the Russian\r\nlanguage, Soviet methods of pedagogy and psychology, and\r\nMarxist-Leninist dialectics were taught by Soviet instructors. A law\r\nadopted in 1954 reorganized the Ministry of Education, renamed it the\r\nMinistry of Education and Culture, and, among other things, provided for\r\nthe dissemination of Communist principles \"supported by the school\r\nexperience of the Soviet Union.\" In 1957, when the State University of\r\nTirana was opened, a team of Soviet educators laid its structural,\r\ncurricular, and ideological foundations.\r\n\r\nParallel with the Sovietization of the school system in the 1950s, the\r\ngovernment made a concerted effort to implement the idea that education\r\nmust be directly connected with daily living. A large number of\r\nwhite-collar and blue-collar workers were registered in evening and\r\ncorrespondence courses in the various trade and professional schools.\r\nAccording to government statistics, in the late 1950s one out of every\r\nfour workers was taking some kind of course. Importance was particularly\r\ngiven to improving polytechnical and related work experiences and to the\r\ndissemination of manual work in most of the schools. Attempts were made\r\nto build vocational workrooms in most elementary and secondary schools.\r\nEmphasis was placed on technical and agricultural subjects.\r\n\r\nBy 1960 the system of elementary and secondary education had evolved\r\ninto an eleven-year program made up of schools of general education and\r\nof vocational and professional schools. The schools of general education\r\nconsisted of primary grades one to four, intermediate grades five to\r\nseven, and secondary grades eight to eleven. In October 1960, however,\r\nas the Soviet-Albanian conflict was reaching the breaking point, the\r\nParty adopted a resolution calling for a reorganization of the whole\r\nschool system, the real aim being to purge the schools of Soviet\r\ninfluence and rewrite the textbooks. One more year was added to the\r\neleven-year general education schools, and the whole school program was\r\nintegrated more closely with productive work so as to prepare youths to\r\nwork in industry to replace some of the Soviet specialists should the\r\nlatter be withdrawn, as they actually were in January and April 1961.\r\n\r\nAnother far-reaching school reform became effective on January 1, 1970.\r\nTwo factors seemed to have accounted for the new reorganization: the\r\napparent lack of success in completely ridding the schools of so-called\r\nrevisionist Soviet influences and the decision, evidently related to the\r\nSoviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, to introduce military\r\ntraining in the whole school system. The reform was decreed by the\r\nParty's Central Committee in a special plenum held in June 1969. At the\r\nplenum the principal speakers were Party First Secretary Hoxha and Prime\r\nMinister Shehu, the latter in his capacity as chairman of a special\r\neducation commission attached to the Central Committee. Hoxha charged\r\nthat the old school system had left vestiges of the past in the\r\nconsciousness of many intellectuals, teachers, professors, and men of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hoxha the aim of the reform was to revolutionize the\r\nschools so that the new generation would be imbued with scientific and\r\ntheoretical concepts of Marxism-Leninism and to combine these concepts\r\nwith physical and military training. The new educational system was to\r\npersist in its struggle against old customs in society and in its\r\nefforts to inculcate youth with atheistic ideas. The new system, Hoxha\r\ndeclared, was intended in particular \"to safeguard our schools from the\r\nSoviet revisionist school,\" which in a \"demagogic way was degenerating\r\ninto a bourgeois school.\" Accordingly, the Soviet concept in pedagogy\r\nwas to be eradicated from the Albanian schools.\r\n\r\nAs reorganized on January 1, 1970, the system was divided into four\r\ngeneral categories: preschool, general eight-year, secondary, and higher\r\neducation (see fig. 5). On December 23, 1969, the government submitted\r\nto the People's Assembly a draft bill on educational reform, which was\r\napproved and became effective on January 1, 1970. The preamble to the\r\nlaw set the ideological tone of the new system. Its aim was to make \"a\r\ndecisive contribution to the training and education of the new man with\r\ncomprehensive Communist traits, loyal to the end to the Party's cause,\"\r\nclosely linking \"learning with productive work and with physical and\r\nmilitary education, giving absolute priority to Marxism-Leninism.\" In\r\npresenting the bill on the school reform to the People's Assembly,\r\nMinister of Education and Culture Thoma Deljana listed the three\r\ncomponents of the reorganized school system as academic education,\r\nproduction, and military education.\r\n\r\nThe educational system in 1969 was divided into two general parts: one\r\ndealt with full-time pupils and students from the kindergarten to the\r\nuniversity level, and the other with adult education for employed\r\npeople. The eight-year education was obligatory, beginning at age six\r\nand ending at age thirteen; secondary education began with grade nine,\r\nor age fourteen, and ended with grade twelve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 5. Educational System in Albania, 1969_]\r\n\r\nBefore a full-time student proceeds to higher education, he must pass a\r\nprobationary period of one year in production work. The eight-year\r\nsystem was described as the fundamental link of the entire educational\r\nsystem; it was intended to provide the pupils with the primary elements\r\nof ideological, political, moral, aesthetic, physical, and military\r\neducation. The new eight-year system differed from the old in that it\r\nlowered the entrance age from seven to six, and there were no longer\r\nseparate primary and intermediate schools; that is, there was a single\r\neight-year school, which was, however, completely separate from the\r\nsecondary school.\r\n\r\nThe secondary schools were of many kinds, consisting of four-year\r\ngeneral education courses and four-year vocational and professional\r\ncourses (industrial, agricultural, pedagogic, trade, arts, health, and\r\nothers). Some of these courses lasted only two years. In his report to\r\nthe Party's Central Committee in June 1969 on the reform of the school\r\nyear, Prime Minister Shehu said that the secondary schools were to have\r\na standard curriculum for the school year. Priority was to be given to\r\nacademic subjects, followed by production and by physical and military\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nShehu formulated the structure of the academic year in all secondary\r\nschools as follows: 6-½ months of academic study, 2-½ months of\r\nproductive work, 1 month of military training, and 2 months of vacation.\r\nThe curriculum of the secondary schools and, with slight differences, of\r\nthe higher schools was divided as follows: academic subjects, 55 to 56\r\npercent; production work, 26 to 27 percent; and physical and military\r\neducation, 17 to 19 percent. Shehu also said that terms borrowed from\r\nthe Soviet school system, would be dropped, and in the future secondary\r\nschools would be known by such names as general secondary school and\r\nindustrial, agricultural, construction, trade, art, and sanitation\r\nsecondary schools.\r\n\r\nThe terms of study in the higher institutes lasted from three to five\r\nyears. Provision was also made to expand higher education by increasing\r\nthe number of full-time students, setting up new branches in places\r\nwhere there were no higher institutes, and organizing specialization\r\ncourses for those who had completed higher education to train highly\r\nqualified technical and scientific cadres. All full-time graduate\r\nstudents had to serve a probationary period of nine months in production\r\nand three months in military training, in addition to the prescribed\r\nmilitary training received while in school.\r\n\r\nAdult education had the same structure as that for full-time students,\r\nwith two exceptions: first, the eight-year general education was not\r\ncompulsory and was contracted into a six-year program allowing for\r\ncompletion of the first four grades in two years; second, those who\r\nwanted to proceed to higher institutes after graduating from secondary\r\nschool had to devote one year to preparatory study instead of engaging\r\nin production work, as did full-time students.\r\n\r\nAccording to official statistics, in the late 1960s, the regime had made\r\nconsiderable strides, at least quantitatively, in education since it\r\ncame to power in 1944 (see table 5). From a total enrollment of less\r\nthan 60,000 students of all levels in the 1938/39 school year, according\r\nto the Tirana press, the number had reached over 570,000 in the 1969/70\r\nschool year, with a teaching staff of 22,000. The total enrollment\r\nincluded pupils in the compulsory eight-year schools and students,\r\nworkers, and collective farmers in the eight-year general education,\r\nsecondary, trade, and professional schools, the State University of\r\nTirana, and other higher institutes of learning.\r\n\r\nNearly half of the total enrollment represented adults attending evening\r\nand correspondence courses. An article in the April 5, 1970, issue of\r\n_Zeri i Popullit_ admitted that, of those originally enrolled in\r\nSeptember 1969 in evening elementary, secondary, higher education,\r\ntrade, and vocational courses, from 25 to 50 percent either dropped out\r\nor were often absent.\r\n\r\nAccording to available official statistics, nearly 500,000 people were\r\nenrolled in schools and courses in the 1967/68 academic year; this\r\nincluded all adults who registered for, but did not necessarily attend\r\nregularly, technical and vocational courses, evening classes, or\r\ncorrespondence courses. In the same academic year the State University\r\nof Tirana and five other higher institutes of learning had a total\r\nenrollment of 12,435 students, of whom nearly 8,000 attended the State\r\nUniversity of Tirana (see table 6). Of the total enrollment, over 4,000\r\nwere adults or part-time students.\r\n\r\nIn the 1945-56 period, that is, before the founding of the State\r\nUniversity of Tirana, the government sent a number of students to pursue\r\ntheir education in the Soviet-bloc countries, mostly the Soviet Union.\r\nWhen the break came with Moscow in 1961, all students were either\r\nexpelled or withdrawn from all these countries. According to documents\r\npublished by the Tirana government after the break, at the beginning of\r\nthe 1961/62 academic year there were 1,213 Albanian students already\r\nenrolled in Soviet institutions, and an additional 100 were to enroll\r\nduring that academic year. They were all expelled by the Soviets except\r\nfor a few who asked for and obtained political asylum. In 1970 an\r\nunknown number of students were attending schools in the People's\r\nRepublic of China (Communist China), and a few in Romania and Italy.\r\n\r\n _Table 5.

The Politburo set the general policy\r\nguidelines and directives. In 1968 the Politburo created a Central\r\nCommission on Education attached to the Central Committee and headed by\r\nPrime Minister Mehmet Shehu. The commission's function was to elaborate\r\nthe Politburo's directives on reforming the school system. When Mehmet\r\nShehu submitted the report on behalf of the commission to the plenum of\r\nthe Central Committee in June 1969 concerning the reorganization of the\r\nschool system, it was decided to continue the commission for an\r\nindefinite period.\r\n\r\nA more permanent body in the Party's Central Committee was the\r\nDirectorate of Education and Culture, headed by Nexhmije Hoxha, wife of\r\nParty First Secretary Enver Hoxha. This body, guided by the directives\r\nprescribed by the Politburo, supervised the Ministry of Education and\r\nCulture in implementing the Party's ideological and political\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n _Table 6.

It had\r\neducation sections in all the district people's councils, which\r\nadministered and, through their inspectors, controlled the teachers and\r\nthe teaching programs. Party control at all levels was exercised either\r\ndirectly by the Party's basic organizations, as was the case in the\r\nhigher institutes, or through the branches of the Union of Albanian\r\nWorking Youth, the Party's most powerful front organization. The\r\nmajority of the teachers in secondary schools and higher institutes\r\nwere Party members.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1970 the regime seemed to have scored substantial\r\nprogress in the field of education. Illiteracy had been reduced\r\nconsiderably, if not actually eliminated. Through an intensive program\r\nto train elementary and secondary school teachers, build schoolhouses,\r\nand make schooling obligatory up to the eighth grade, the government had\r\nenabled all the country's children to obtain some kind of rudimentary\r\neducation. It had also instituted a system of higher education and had\r\nfounded the first university in the history of the country and was thus\r\nno longer dependent on foreign universities to train people in the\r\nvarious professions. It had also instituted a widespread network of\r\nprofessional and vocational schools intended to train badly needed\r\ntechnicians and skilled workers.\r\n\r\nThe whole education network, however, was a one-track system geared to\r\nserve the ideological and political objectives of the Party. The Party,\r\nthrough the Central Commission on Education and the Directorate of\r\nEducation and Culture, both attached to the Party's Central Committee,\r\ncontrolled every facet of the school system: programs, curricula,\r\nadministration, teaching staffs, and funds. The schools, students,\r\nteachers, and professors were so organized as to form a monolithic\r\nestablishment centrally directed and completely immersed in\r\nMarxism-Leninism.\r\n\r\nThe entire system was dedicated to the education of the new man with\r\nCommunist traits and morality. As defined by the Party leaders and Party\r\ntheoreticians, these traits and morality meant the development of a\r\n\"revolutionary spirit and responsibility for one's tasks for society and\r\nthe cause of socialism, the defense of the basic principles of the Party\r\nand the implementation of its correct policy.\" The whole school system,\r\nas developed in the past twenty-five years, therefore, was for the\r\nbuilding of communism as defined and interpreted by the Albanian\r\nCommunists. All other ideologies, beliefs, cultures, and thoughts were\r\nbanned from the country's schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\nSituation Before the Communist Takeover\r\n\r\nOne of the major legacies of nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule was\r\nthe conversion of over 70 percent of the population to Islam. When\r\nindependence came, therefore, the country emerged as a predominantly\r\nMuslim nation, the only Islamic state in Europe. No censuses taken by\r\nthe Communist regime since it assumed power in 1944 have shown the\r\nreligious affiliations of the people. It has been estimated that of a\r\ntotal population of 1,180,500, at the end of World War II, about 826,000\r\nwere Muslims, 212,500 Eastern Orthodox, and 142,000 Roman Catholics. The\r\nMuslims were divided between adherents of the Sunni branch and over\r\n200,000 followers of a dervish order known as Bektashi, an offshoot of\r\nthe Shia branch.\r\n\r\nChristianity was introduced early in Albania, having been brought in\r\nduring the period of Roman rule. After the division of the Roman Empire\r\ninto East and West in 395, Albania became politically a part of the\r\nEastern, or Byzantine, Empire but remained ecclesiastically dependent on\r\nRome. When, however, the final schism occurred in 1054 between the Roman\r\nand Eastern churches, the Christians in the southern part of the country\r\ncame under the jurisdiction of the Constantinople Ecumenical\r\nPatriarchate. This situation prevailed until the Turkish invasions of\r\nthe fourteenth century, when the Islamic faith was introduced. The\r\napostasy of the people took many decades.\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous north the propagation of Islam met strong resistance\r\nfrom the Catholics. Gradually, however, backwardness, illiteracy, the\r\nabsence of an educated clergy, and material inducements weakened\r\nresistance. Coerced conversions occurred, especially when Catholic\r\npowers, such as the Venetian Republic and Austria, were at war with the\r\nOttoman Empire. By the close of the seventeenth century the Catholics in\r\nthe north were outnumbered by the Muslims.\r\n\r\nLarge-scale forced conversions among the Orthodox in the south did not\r\noccur until the Russo-Turkish wars of the eighteenth century. Islamic\r\npressure was put on the Orthodox Christians because the Turks considered\r\nthem sympathetic to Orthodox Russia. The situation of the Orthodox\r\nimproved temporarily after a Russo-Turkish treaty of 1774 in which\r\nRussia was recognized as the protector of the Orthodox Christians in the\r\nOttoman Empire. The most effective method employed by the Turks in their\r\nmissionary efforts, especially in the central and southern parts of the\r\ncountry, was the creation of a titled noble Muslim class of _pashas_,\r\n_beys_, and _agas_ (Albanian tribal chiefs in Turkish service), who were\r\nendowed with both large estates and extensive political and governing\r\npowers. Through their political and economic influences these nobles\r\ncontrolled the peasants, large numbers of whom were converted to Islam\r\neither through coercion or through promise of economic benefits.\r\n\r\nIn the period from independence to the Communist seizure of power, the\r\nMuslim noble class composed the country's ruling elite, but this elite\r\nnever interfered with religious freedom, which was sanctioned by the\r\nvarious pre-World War II constitutions. The church and state were\r\nseparate. These constitutions had declared that the country had no\r\nofficial religion, that all religions and faiths were respected, and\r\nthat their freedom of exercise was assured. These provisions had\r\nexpressed the true feelings of the people who, whether Muslim, Eastern\r\nOrthodox, or Roman Catholic, were tolerant on religious matters.\r\n\r\nTolerance has been a marked characteristic of all Albanians, as\r\nindicated in part by the fact that even after accepting Islam, many\r\npeople privately remained practicing Christians, or so-called\r\ncrypto-Christians. As late as 1912 in a large number of villages in the\r\nElbasan area, most men had two names, a Muslim one for public use and a\r\nChristian one for private use. A characteristic remark on the religious\r\ntolerance of the Albanians was made by Lord Byron, who observed in one\r\nof his diaries that elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire a man would declare\r\nhimself to be either a Muslim or a Christian when asked what he was, but\r\nthe Albanian would reply that he was an Albanian.\r\n\r\n\r\nSituation Under Communist Rule\r\n\r\nThe Communist regime has exhibited in its attitude toward religion a\r\nwide gap between precept and practice. The Communist Constitution,\r\nadopted in March 1946 and as subsequently amended, contains liberal\r\nprovisions with regard to religion. Freedom of conscience and religion\r\nis guaranteed to all citizens; the church is separate from the state;\r\nreligious communities are free to exercise and practice their creeds; it\r\nis forbidden to use the church and religion for political purposes, and\r\npolitical organizations based on religion are outlawed; and the state\r\nmay give material assistance to religious organizations.\r\n\r\nEven before the adoption of the Constitution, however, legislative\r\nmeasures had already been taken to curb the freedom and power of all\r\nreligious bodies. For example, the agrarian reform law of August 1945\r\nmade special provision for the confiscation of all their wealth,\r\nespecially the estates of monasteries, orders, and dioceses, and the\r\nseizure of their libraries and printing presses. But the first major law\r\naimed specifically at the control and regulation of all religious bodies\r\nand at the elimination of all distinguished clergymen was enacted two\r\nyears after the promulgation of the Constitution. This law is known as\r\nDecree No. 743 On Religious Communities, approved by the Council of\r\nMinisters on November 26, 1949, converted into Law No. 773 on January\r\n16, 1950, and amended by Decree No. 3660 of April 10, 1963.\r\n\r\nThe law provided that religious communities through their activities had\r\nto develop in their followers a sentiment of loyalty toward the People's\r\nRepublic of Albania. In order to organize and function, religious\r\ncommunities had to be recognized by the state, such recognition taking\r\nplace as a result of the approval of their statutes by the Council of\r\nMinisters. All regulations and bylaws issued on the basis of such\r\nstatutes had also to be approved by the Council of Ministers, and the\r\nheads of religious communities and sects had to be approved by the\r\nCouncil of Ministers after being elected or appointed by the proper\r\nreligious organs. Religious communities or branches, such as the Jesuit\r\nand Franciscan orders, that had their headquarters outside the country\r\nwere henceforth prohibited and ordered to terminate their activities\r\nwithin a month of the enactment of the decree.\r\n\r\nAll religious communities were obliged to send at once to the Council of\r\nMinisters all pastoral letters, messages, speeches, and other\r\ninstructions of a general character that were to be made public in any\r\nform. Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with\r\nthe education of the young since this was the exclusive right of the\r\nstate, and all religious communities were prohibited from operating\r\nphilanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals or from owning real\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of Decree No. 743 the Council of Ministers on May 4, 1950,\r\nissued Decrees Nos. 1064, 1065, and 1066, approving respectively the\r\nstatutes of the Sunni, Orthodox, and Bektashi religious communities. A\r\ncommon provision of all three decrees was that each religious community\r\nhad to develop the \"sentiment of loyalty in their followers toward the\r\npeople's power and the People's Republic of Albania, as well as their\r\npatriotic feelings.\" The Statute of the Independent Catholic Church of\r\nAlbania was approved by Decree No. 1322 of July 30, 1951.\r\n\r\nThe regime's policy toward each of the three religious denominations,\r\nalthough differing somewhat in tactics, aimed from the outset at the\r\neventual destruction of all organized religion. The regime achieved\r\ncontrol over the Muslim faith by dealing with each sect separately. The\r\nfirst measure aimed at dividing the Sunni and Bektashi, which was\r\neffected, officially, in May 1945, when the two were declared completely\r\nindependent of each other.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the Sunni clergy, the government arrested and executed\r\nas \"enemies of the people\" those members of the top hierarchy who were\r\nreluctant to toe the Communist line, while others were imprisoned or\r\nsent to concentration camps. It named as head of the Sunni community\r\nHafez Musa Haxhi Ali, who in 1950 led a delegation of the Sunni clergy\r\nto the Soviet Union, visiting Uzbekistan and the Muslim religious\r\nshrines of Samarkand and Tashkent and meeting with many Soviet Muslim\r\nleaders. He was also used in appeals for world peace and other slogans\r\ndirected at the Muslim countries in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nThe policy followed toward each group differed somewhat. The Bektashi\r\ngroup had always been much more liberal and forward looking than the\r\nSunni. During the war a few leading Bektashi clergymen had joined the\r\nNational Liberation Movement, and three of them--Baba Mustafa Faja\r\nMartaneshi, Baba Fejzo, and Sheh Karbunaro--played major roles in\r\nbringing about close collaboration between the Bektashi order and the\r\nregime. In March 1947, however, Baba Faja and Baba Fejzo were\r\nassassinated at the group's headquarters in Tirana, where they had gone\r\nto meet with the World Bektashi Primate Dede Abazi (the Bektashi had\r\nmoved their world headquarters in the 1920s from Ankara to Tirana). As\r\nthe Tirana press reported the event: \"The leaders of the Bektashi, Baba\r\nFaja and Baba Fejzo, cooperating with the people's government, visited\r\nDede Abazi to discuss the democratization of the religious organization.\r\nDede Abazi answered with bullets, killing them both. Later he shot\r\nhimself.\" Taking advantage of this incident, the regime eliminated those\r\nleaders of the Bektashi clergy it considered disloyal.\r\n\r\nBecause of the traditionally nationalistic character of the Albanian\r\nOrthodox Church, the regime has attempted from the outset to use it as\r\nan instrument for mobilizing the Orthodox population behind its\r\npolicies. Using the church for its own ends, the regime took steps to\r\npurge all those elements within it that were considered unreliable.\r\nClergymen who did not yield to the demands of the regime were purged.\r\n\r\nAmong the purged Orthodox leaders was the primate of the church,\r\nArchbishop Kristofor Kisi, who was deposed in the late 1940s and\r\nsubsequently died in jail. The regime replaced Kisi with Pashko Vodica,\r\na renegade priest who had joined the ranks of the partisan formations.\r\nOn assuming the office of primate, under the name of Archbishop Paisi,\r\nhe stated that it was the church's duty to be faithful to the People's\r\nRepublic of Albania and to the people's power and added: \"Our Church\r\nmust be faithful to the camp of Peace, to the great anti-imperialist and\r\ndemocratic camp, to the unique camp of socialism led brilliantly by the\r\nglorious Soviet Union and the Great Stalin....\"\r\n\r\nArchbishop Paisi brought about close ties between the Albanian Orthodox\r\nChurch and the Moscow Patriarchate. These ties were further strengthened\r\nafter a delegation of Soviet religious leaders, headed by Bishop Nikon\r\nof Odessa, visited Tirana in the spring of 1951. After the 1960-61\r\nMoscow-Tirana break, however, these ties lapsed.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church, chiefly because it maintained close relations\r\nwith the Vatican and was more organized than were the Muslim and Eastern\r\nOrthodox faiths, became a principal target of persecution as soon as the\r\nCommunists assumed power. In May 1945 Monsignor Nigris, the apostolic\r\nnuncio in Albania, was arrested on charges of fomenting anti-Communist\r\nfeelings and deported to Italy. In 1946 a number of Catholic clergymen\r\nwere arrested and tried on charges of distributing leaflets against the\r\nregime; some were executed, others given long prison terms at hard\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nAccording to Vatican sources, from 1945 to 1953 the number of Catholic\r\nchurches and chapels in Albania was reduced from 253 to 100. Both\r\nseminaries in the country were closed, and the number of monasteries\r\ndropped from ten to two. All twenty convents were closed, as were\r\nfifteen orphanages, sixteen church schools, and ten charitable\r\ninstitutions. Both Catholic printing presses were confiscated, and the\r\npublication of seven religious periodicals ceased.\r\n\r\nThe ranks of Catholic priests were thinned from ninety-three in 1945 to\r\nten in 1953, twenty-four having been executed, thirty-five imprisoned,\r\nten either missing or dead, eleven drafted into the army, and three\r\nhaving escaped from the country. Secular officials and laymen active in\r\nchurch affairs also suffered execution, imprisonment, and harassment.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic school system was completely eliminated. This included five\r\nsecondary schools with a total enrollment of 570 and ten elementary and\r\nvocational schools with 2,750 pupils. All Catholic associations were\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nA severe blow against the Catholic church was struck in 1951, when the\r\nregime mustered a small group of clergymen to hold a national Catholic\r\nassembly to draw the statute for the church. As approved by the Council\r\nof Ministers on July 30 of that year, the statute provided that the\r\n\"Catholic Church of Albania has a national character ... [and that] it\r\nshall no longer have any organizational, political, or economic\r\nrelations with the Pope.\" The statute provided further that the church\r\nwas to be directed both in religious and administrative matters by a new\r\nCatholic Episcopate, that relations concerning religious questions\r\ncould be established only through governmental channels, and that the\r\nchurch would submit to the canon law of the world Catholic church only\r\nif the provisions of this law did not contradict the laws of the\r\nPeople's Republic of Albania.\r\n\r\nEnver Hoxha himself spearheaded the campaign against the Catholic\r\nchurch. In 1952, for example, he purged Tuk Jakova, the only Catholic\r\nmember of the Politburo and previously one of Hoxha's closest\r\ncollaborators, because he had allegedly befriended the Catholic clergy.\r\nIn his speech to the Second Party Congress in 1952, in an attempt to\r\njustify Jakova's purge, Hoxha said: \"Comrade Tuk Jakova, in\r\ncontradiction to the political line of the Party and of the state\r\nconcerning religion generally and the Catholic clergy in particular, has\r\nnot properly understood and has not properly acted against the Catholic\r\nclergy. Without seeing the great danger of the reactionary clergy,\r\nComrade Tuk Jakova has not hated them in sufficient measure....\"\r\n\r\nA new policy aimed at the complete destruction of organized religion was\r\nenunciated by Hoxha in a speech to the Party's Central Committee on\r\nFebruary 6, 1967. Calling for an intensified cultural-education struggle\r\nagainst religious beliefs and declaring that the only religion for an\r\nAlbanian should be Albanianism, he assigned the antireligious mission to\r\nthe youth movement. By May of the same year religious institutions were\r\nforced to relinquish 2,169 churches, mosques, cloisters, and shrines,\r\nmost of which were converted into cultural centers for young people. As\r\nthe literary monthly _Nendori_ (November) in its September 1967 issue\r\nreported the event, the youth had thus \"created the first atheist nation\r\nin the world.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Western correspondents in Tirana, the procedure employed in\r\nseizing the places of worship was to assemble the villagers or\r\nparishioners in order to discuss Hoxha's speech and to take measures to\r\neliminate what the regime referred to as harmful survivals of religious\r\ncustoms. A decision was then taken to ask the government for permission\r\nto close a church, mosque, or monastery. A few days later the\r\ngovernment, stating that it was following the will of the people, would\r\nissue orders to close the house of worship.\r\n\r\nDrastic measures were reportedly taken in cases where the clergy opposed\r\nthe government order. The strongest resistance came from the Catholic\r\nclergy, resulting in the detention of some twenty priests. The cloister\r\nof the Franciscan order in Shkoder was set afire in the spring of 1967,\r\nresulting in the death of four monks. The Catholic cathedral in Tirana\r\nhad its facade removed, and on June 4, 1967, it was taken over by the\r\ngovernment and converted into a museum. A similar fate befell the\r\nCatholic cathedrals in Shkoder and Durres.\r\n\r\nAfter the seizure of the houses of worship, the younger clergymen were\r\nforced to seek work either in industry or agricultural collectives. The\r\nelder clergy were ordered to return to their birthplaces, which they\r\ncould not leave without permission from the authorities. Monsignor\r\nErnest Coba, bishop of Shkoder and acknowledged head of the Catholic\r\nchurch in Albania, was evicted from the cathedral in April 1967 and was\r\nforced to seek work as a gardener on a collective farm. He was still\r\nalive but ailing at the end of 1969.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1970 the provision of the Constitution concerning\r\nfreedom of religion was ostensibly in effect, but government decrees had\r\nmade such a provision a dead issue. On November 22, 1967, a significant\r\nmeasure was taken that apparently aimed at delivering the coup de grace\r\nto formal religious institutions. On that day _Gazeta Zyrtare_, the\r\ngovernment's official gazette, published Decree No. 4337 of the\r\nPresidium of the People's Assembly entitled, \"On the Abrogation of\r\nCertain Decrees.\" Specifically, the new decree annulled all previous\r\ndecrees dealing with organized religion, thus removing official sanction\r\nfrom religious bodies and, in effect, placing them outside the law.\r\n\r\nThe 1949 decree on religion had provided for subsidies from the state to\r\nthe three religious denominations. These subsidies had become\r\nindispensable for their survival because their property and all other\r\nmaterial means of subsistence had been confiscated and nationalized in\r\n1945, and without state help the churches could not function. Concurrent\r\nwith the official moves against religions, a number of antireligious\r\nbrochures and pamphlets were prepared and distributed by the Democratic\r\nFront in an effort to prepare the people for the attacks on their\r\nreligious institutions.\r\n\r\nEven though organized religion had been destroyed by the end of 1967,\r\nthe regime was still struggling as of early 1970 to eradicate religious\r\nthought and beliefs. The _Nendori_ article that proclaimed the creation\r\nof the first atheist state in the world admitted that \"despite the hard\r\nblows religion had suffered through the destruction of its material\r\ninstitutions, religious ideology is still alive.\"\r\n\r\nHoxha himself has often admitted that antireligious measures and the\r\nclosing of places of worship have not sufficed to eradicate religious\r\nbeliefs. Thus, addressing the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front in\r\nSeptember 1967, he declared that it was misleading to hold that religion\r\nconsisted of church, mosque, priests, icons, and the like, and that if\r\nall of these disappeared, then automatically religion and its influence\r\non the people would vanish. The struggle against religious beliefs, he\r\nadded, had not ended because for centuries they had been deeply rooted\r\nin the conscience of the people.\r\n\r\nHoxha reverted to the subject again in his speech to the Party's Central\r\nCommittee plenum in June 1969, devoted to reforming the school system,\r\nin which he said that one of the aims of the reorganized schools would\r\nbe to bring up the new generation imbued with scientific and theoretical\r\nknowledge; for, according to Hoxha, religious beliefs could be\r\neradicated only through the elimination of old concepts still prevalent\r\nin the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1970 Party leaders in their speeches and in the\r\npress were continuing to call for an intensification of the struggle\r\nagainst religious ideology and especially for the eradication of every\r\nreligious influence or belief among students, who were still under the\r\ninfluence of parents. The older generation, according to the leadership,\r\ncontinued to entertain the religious beliefs that everything in nature\r\nhas been created with a predetermined purpose by God. The press has also\r\nreported on several occasions that there was strong resistance to the\r\nclosing of places of worship and that the clergy resorted to all kinds\r\nof subterfuge to continue their religious activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT STRUCTURE AND POLITICAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical power in 1970 was solely in the hands of the ruling elite,\r\nthat is, the leadership of the Communist Party (officially the Albanian\r\nWorkers' Party). No political, economic, or social activity occurred\r\nwithout the sanction of the Party. Although the facade of a people's\r\nrepublic under constitutional rule was established in 1946, the reality\r\nof a rigid police state was clearly evident from the beginning, and no\r\ntrue democratic processes had been allowed to develop. The greatly\r\nheralded People's Assembly, people's councils, and people's courts were\r\nelected from a list of Party candidates; only one candidate was\r\npresented for each office, and there was no popular selection or popular\r\nchoice. In effect, the Party was the government and directed all aspects\r\nof the lives of the people--from the cradle to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe governmental structure and political system of the Albanian People's\r\nRepublic have their roots in the National Liberation Movement, which\r\ncame into existence during the Italian and German occupations of World\r\nWar II. Communist Party members dominated the leadership and, while\r\ncombating Italian and German occupiers, fought against other national\r\nresistance groups for postwar control of the country. Enver Hoxha, first\r\nsecretary of the Albanian Workers' Party in 1970, and Mehmet Shehu,\r\npremier and second ranking Party member, were wartime leaders of the\r\nCommunist resistance forces. Superior organization and the establishment\r\nof crude governing bodies called national liberation councils\r\nfacilitated the Communist takeover of the country after the cessation of\r\nhostilities. These councils later became the basis of the postwar\r\ngovernmental structure.\r\n\r\nThe Communists moved rapidly after the end of the war to prevent the\r\nreestablishment of the monarchy and to secure their own position of\r\npower. Operating under the banner of a mass organization known as the\r\nDemocratic Front, the Communist Party strengthened its hold on the\r\ncountry and in early 1946 promulgated a Constitution based on Yugoslav\r\nand Soviet models. This Constitution provided for a unicameral\r\nlegislature, a collective executive branch, and an independent\r\njudiciary. Actually, the Albanian Workers' Party, formerly the Communist\r\nParty, which is mentioned in the Constitution as \"the vanguard\r\norganization of the working class,\" uses the formal governmental\r\nstructure as the instrument for governing the nation and for\r\nimplementing its own policies.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian People's Republic in its twenty-five years as a Communist\r\nnation has remained as rigidly authoritarian and Stalinist in its\r\napproach to government as it was at the end of World War II. The Party\r\nis all pervasive, the leadership is glorified to an extreme degree, and\r\nParty pronouncements are treated as infallible doctrine. The average\r\ncitizen casts his ballot in periodic elections for local and national\r\noffices, but two conditions invariably exist: a candidate for office is\r\na member of the Party, and only one name is listed for any particular\r\noffice. It has become standard practice for well over 99 percent of the\r\nelectorate to vote and for over 99 percent of those voting to approve\r\nthe single candidate. Absolute control of the government, the economy,\r\nand the cultural life of the country is assured by a system that places\r\nthe leading officers of the Party in the top positions of government.\r\n\r\nAlbanian history as a Communist state can be divided into three distinct\r\nphases based on outside influence: the Yugoslav period, the Soviet\r\nperiod, and the Chinese period. Yugoslav influence began with the\r\nfounding in 1941 of the Albanian Communist Party, in which some Yugoslav\r\nnationals played leading roles, and lasted until Yugoslavia's expulsion\r\nfrom the Cominform in 1948. From 1948 until 1961 the Albanians looked to\r\nthe Soviet Union for assistance and advice, and after 1961 Communist\r\nChina became the foreign power wielding greatest influence in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn 1970 Albania continued as the only European ally of Communist China.\r\nHoxha and Shehu continued the harsh polemics with the Soviet Union; made\r\ntentative gestures of friendship toward Yugoslavia; continued their\r\ntirades against Western imperialism; and, in general, tried to present\r\nthemselves to the world as the embodiment of true Marxism-Leninism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAL STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe People's Assembly\r\n\r\nThe Constitution established the People's Assembly as the legislative\r\nbranch of the government and refers to it as \"the highest organ of state\r\npower.\" Representatives to the Assembly are elected from a single list\r\nof Party-selected candidates for a term of four years in a ratio of 1\r\nrepresentative for every 8,000 inhabitants. The Assembly meets in two\r\nregularly scheduled sessions annually, and there is constitutional\r\nprovision for the convening of extraordinary sessions.\r\n\r\nAll legislative power is vested in the People's Assembly, although\r\nproposals for legislation and for constitutional amendments can be made\r\nby the Presidium of the People's Assembly or the Council of Ministers,\r\nas well as by members of the Assembly itself. Bills become laws after an\r\naffirmative vote by a simple majority of the Assembly, but an amendment\r\nto the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote. In practice, the\r\nAssembly listens to the reading of bills drawn up by its Presidium and\r\nthen votes unanimous approval.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly elects officers to preside over its meetings and direct its\r\naffairs. Usually a chairman, two vice chairmen, and a secretary are\r\nelected for the four-year term of the Assembly. The chairman of the\r\nPeople's Assembly in 1970 was Abdyl Kellezi, who was concurrently a\r\ncandidate member of the Party, Political Bureau (Politburo). One of the\r\ntwo vice chairmen and the secretary were also members of the Party\r\nCentral Committee. The Assembly has the power to appoint commissions, to\r\ncarry out specific functions, or to conduct investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Presidium\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that the People's Assembly elect its\r\nPresidium, which is made up of a president, two vice presidents, a\r\nsecretary, and ten members. The president of the Presidium becomes the\r\ntitular chief of state and, in 1970, this office was held by Haxhi\r\nLeshi, a member of the Party Central Committee. Enver Hoxha was one of\r\nthe ten members of the Presidium, and a majority of the other Presidium\r\nmembers concurrently held high Party positions. Because of the\r\ninfrequent and short meetings of the Assembly and because the real\r\npower, that is Party power, is held by the Presidium, it has become the\r\nactual legislative branch of government.\r\n\r\nThe Presidium performs several functions besides that of conducting the\r\naffairs of the Assembly between sessions. It calls for the elections of\r\nrepresentatives to the Assembly and convenes its sessions. It has the\r\npower to issue decrees and to ratify international treaties. The\r\nPresidium also appoints or recalls diplomats, receives credentials and\r\nletters of recall of foreign diplomats, and appoints and recalls the\r\nsupreme commander of the armed forces. Between sessions of the Assembly,\r\nthe Presidium is empowered to decree general mobilization and a state of\r\nwar and to appoint and relieve ministers as proposed by the premier. The\r\nPresidium also designates ministry jurisdiction over various\r\nenterprises according to the recommendations of the premier.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers, referred to as the government in the\r\nConstitution, is the highest executive organ and constitutionally is\r\nappointed by, and responsible to, the People's Assembly or its\r\nPresidium. The chairman of the Council of Ministers, by virtue of his\r\nposition, is also the premier or prime minister. Mehmet Shehu, who\r\nassumed this position in 1954, still held it in 1970. Shehu was also a\r\nmember of the Politburo of the Party Central Committee. The Council of\r\nMinisters is composed of the chairman, three deputy chairmen, thirteen\r\nministers, and the chairman of the State Planning Commission, who has\r\nministerial rank. The Constitution provides for the establishment of new\r\nministries and the abolishment or combining of old ones.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers, as a unit, is constitutionally responsible for\r\npreparing the overall economic plan and the budget, which must then be\r\napproved by the People's Assembly. After approval, which is pro forma\r\nand usually granted without discussion or debate, the council is\r\nresponsible for implementation. The council also directs the monetary\r\nsystem; assures protection of citizens rights and the maintenance of\r\npublic order; directs the organization of the army; oversees foreign\r\nrelations; and, in effect, administers the entire economic and cultural\r\nlife of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe interlocking of the Party with the Council of Ministers has been\r\nstandard practice since its inception. In 1970 eight of the seventeen\r\nprincipal officers of the council were members or candidate members of\r\nthe Politburo, six were Central Committee members, and the remaining\r\nthree were regular members of the Party. With every key position\r\noccupied by a Politburo member, the Party elite maintained direct\r\ncontrol over the entire governmental structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Government\r\n\r\nPeople's councils are the constitutional agencies on the local level.\r\nElected for three-year terms to administer districts, cities, and\r\nvillages, they are responsible to their constituencies as well as to the\r\nhigher organs of state power. According to the Constitution, the\r\ncouncils are charged with economic and cultural matters and direct the\r\naffairs of the administrative organs within their jurisdictions.\r\nCouncils are responsible for maintaining public order, for implementing\r\nlaws, and for drawing up local budgets. The Constitution also requires\r\nthat the councils call periodic meetings of their constituents to keep\r\nthe people informed on council activities.\r\n\r\nEach council chooses an executive committee from among its membership,\r\nand it is through this committee that the actual work of local\r\ngovernment is accomplished. Other committees or departments may be\r\nestablished at the discretion of the executive committee for the\r\nperformance of specific tasks or for the supervision of a particular\r\nenterprise. In performing such functions, the special committees and\r\ndepartments are constitutionally responsible to the people's councils\r\nand to corresponding sections at higher levels of the bureaucracy. The\r\npeople's councils are elected from lists of the local organizations of\r\nthe Albanian Workers' Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe people's court system consists of the Supreme Court and courts at\r\neach of the territorial subdivisions. Other types of courts may be\r\ncreated by law. The Constitution provides that the people's courts are\r\nindependent of the administration. A law on the organization of the\r\ncourts passed in 1968, however, specified that the \"people's courts will\r\nbe guided in their activities by the policy of the Party. In carrying\r\nout their responsibilities, they must strongly rely on the working\r\nmasses and submit to their criticism and control.\"\r\n\r\nDecisions are made collegially. In cases where the Supreme Court and\r\ndistrict courts have original jurisdiction--that is, when a case is to\r\nbe first heard by them--assistant judges participate in the ruling,\r\nunless the case is such that the law specifically states otherwise.\r\nPeople's courts at the village and city levels decide cases with the\r\nparticipation of an assistant judge from the district court and two\r\nso-called social activists, who are actually local Party members. If a\r\ncase is before the Supreme Court by appeal, three judges make the\r\nverdict; when a case is before a district court by appeal, assistant\r\njudges participate.\r\n\r\nTrials are generally open to the public. In order to facilitate the\r\npolitical and social education of the population, courts are held in\r\nplaces of employment, villages, and any other place that makes them more\r\naccessible to the people.\r\n\r\nAssistant judges from the district courts and several social activists\r\nmake up the village and city courts. The social activists are elected\r\nfor one-year terms by a people's meeting. This level of the court system\r\nhas jurisdiction over minor social crimes and simple civil cases.\r\n\r\nThe district courts are composed of a chairman, judges, and assistant\r\njudges. The judges are elected for three-year terms by the general\r\npopulation, and the People's Council appoints the chairman from among\r\nthe elected judges. The district courts have original jurisdiction in\r\nall penal and civil cases unless otherwise specified by law. They also\r\nhear appeals from lower court decisions.\r\n\r\nMilitary courts, called military collegiums, are appointed by the\r\nPresidium of the People's Assembly to operate at the district level.\r\nThey are composed of a military judge and several military assistant\r\njudges. These courts have original jurisdiction over crimes committed by\r\nmilitary personnel.\r\n\r\nThe highest court is the Supreme Court. It has original jurisdiction in\r\nimportant cases that the chairman of the Supreme court takes over from\r\nthe district courts. It also hears appeals from the rulings of all lower\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nSupreme Court judges are elected for four-year terms by the People's\r\nAssembly. The court consists of a chairman, deputy chairmen, and\r\nassistant judges, the exact number being determined by the Presidium of\r\nthe People's Assembly. The Supreme Court is broken down into collegiums\r\nto handle different types of cases, such as penal, civil, and military.\r\nIt also sits in a plenum in order to issue directives concerning legal\r\npractices, to hear appeals from decisions made by its collegium, and to\r\nstudy the operation of the court system in its entirety.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL DYNAMICS\r\n\r\nThe Dictatorship of the Proletariat\r\n\r\nAs officially defined by the Constitution, the state is a form of\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat. The power of the state constitutionally\r\nbelongs to the workers and peasants, represented locally by the people's\r\ncouncils, which supposedly make up the political base of the state. In\r\nlegislation and in official documents dealing with elections, it has\r\nbeen stated that the people not only enjoy freedom of choice concerning\r\ncandidates but also have the right to supervise the work of their\r\nelected representatives and the right of recall if they are\r\ndissatisfied. In practice, such people's democracy does not exist, and\r\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat--that is, the rule of the people\r\nover themselves--is a facade behind which the real dictatorship of the\r\nParty elite operates.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides for direct, secret vote to elect\r\nrepresentatives to all governmental bodies, from the people's councils\r\nin villages to the highest organ of the state, the People's Assembly.\r\nThe voters themselves do nothing on their part to be registered in the\r\nelectoral lists. These lists are drawn up for every type of election by\r\nthe people's councils and are supposed to include all citizens who reach\r\nage eighteen on or before the day of the elections.\r\n\r\nThe democratic character of these elections is allegedly guaranteed by\r\nthe procedure or right for nominating candidates. This right legally\r\nbelongs to the Party, the Democratic Front, trade unions, and social\r\norganizations and is exercised by the central organs of these\r\norganizations and their organs in the districts. Nominations, with Party\r\napproval, also are made at the general meetings of workers and employees\r\nin the enterprises and state farms, of soldiers in their detachments,\r\nand of peasants in their agricultural collectives or villages.\r\n\r\nAll meetings for the selection of candidates are held under the auspices\r\nof the Democratic Front, in whose name all the candidates are presented\r\nfor election. The only legal requirement of a candidate is that he enjoy\r\nthe right to election, that the organization which proposes him confirm\r\nits intention in writing, and that he accept his candidacy for that of\r\nthe Assembly was a \"vivid expression of the socialist democ-him. In\r\npractice, all candidates are preselected, and the meetings simply\r\nconfirm the Party choice.\r\n\r\nPolitical power, according to official documents, is thus vested in the\r\nbroad masses who, through various organizations to which they belong,\r\nchoose the candidates to be elected to all state organs, including the\r\npeople's courts. The candidate who receives one more vote than half the\r\nnumber of voters registered in the electoral zone is proclaimed the\r\nwinner and becomes, in theory, the agent representing the sovereignty of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe highest organ of state power, according to official dogma, is the\r\nPeople's Assembly, composed of representatives elected by direct vote\r\nwho exercise the sovereignty and will of the people. The aim of the\r\nPeople's Assembly, this dogma alleges, is to carry out the main\r\nfunctions of directing and supervising the people's democratic state.\r\nThe Assembly's sphere of action includes practically all the political,\r\neconomic, social, and cultural fields through the passage of laws.\r\n\"These laws,\" according to an official document published in 1964, \"on\r\ntheir part determine the juridical form of the line pursued by the\r\nAlbanian Workers' Party in building socialism in Albania.\" The same\r\ndocument that stated that the laws passed by the Assembly were but the\r\njuridical form of Party policies declared that the concentration of all\r\nstate power in the hands of the Assembly was a \"vivid expression of the\r\nsocialist democracy of the state system of the People's Republic of\r\nAlbania.\"\r\n\r\nAnother document, published in 1963, asserted that economic power and\r\npolitical power were indivisible and that a combination of the two\r\nformed the state power. The representative nature of the socialist\r\nstate, the document declared, was rooted in the socialist economic basis\r\nof the country, derived from the state ownership of the means of\r\nproduction and from the property of the cooperative and collective\r\norganizations, principally the agricultural collectives. All mines and\r\nsubsoil resources, waters, forests and pastures, industrial enterprises,\r\nthe means of air, rail, and sea communications, post, telegraph,\r\ntelephones, radio broadcasting stations, and banks had become the\r\nproperty of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is thus the contention of the regime that the creation of the\r\nsocialist sector of the economy not only placed all economic levers in\r\nthe hands of the people but also altered old relations in production,\r\nresulting in a planned organization of the economy. Economic planning,\r\nit is argued, makes possible the elimination of exploitation of man by\r\nman. Also, through the planned organization of the economy the people\r\nare guaranteed the right to work.\r\n\r\nWith a view to regulating relations in work, the regime passed a series\r\nof legislative acts that were subsequently embodied in the Labor Code.\r\nAs a result of this legislation, it was asserted, conflicts between a\r\nworker and an enterprise were no longer possible, for the enterprise was\r\nthe property of the state and the state was of and for the worker.\r\nAccordingly, both the worker and the enterprise strove to achieve the\r\nsame results, namely, to increase production and improve the material\r\nand cultural conditions of all the workers. To assure their own welfare,\r\nthe workers in turn had to assume certain obligations; they were duty\r\nbound to guard socialist property, which was the \"sacred and inviolate\r\nbasis of the people's democracy, the source of power of the homeland and\r\nof the welfare and culture of the workers.\"\r\n\r\nThe theoretical mechanism evolved for the exercise of power through\r\nfreely elected representatives had no resemblance to the actual locus of\r\npower and the state institutions created to wield this power. The source\r\nof political and economic power was neither the workers and peasants nor\r\nthe organs presumably elected by them. A perfect example was the actual\r\npower and influence of the People's Assembly, to which official\r\ndocuments attributed the power to appoint all the higher state organs\r\nand on which all state organs were dependent. In actual practice, the\r\nPeople's Assembly held only two sessions a year, each lasting about two\r\ndays; the delegates heard reports made by Party and government\r\nofficials, approved without debate all bills and appointments presented\r\nto them, and then adjourned. The Presidium of the People's Assembly was\r\nalso given wide constitutional powers in the fields of legislation and\r\ncontrol of the state apparatus, but in reality its main function was to\r\npromulgate draft laws submitted to it by the Council of Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Albanian Workers' Party\r\n\r\nNational Organization\r\n\r\nThe real source of all power was the Party, whose all-powerful Politburo\r\nwas the country's top policymaking body. But even this body, composed of\r\neleven regular and five candidate members, was under the firm control of\r\nParty First Secretary Enver Hoxha, who has headed the Party since it was\r\nfounded on November 8, 1941, and Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu, who\r\nemerged as the military strategist in the Communist-dominated Army of\r\nNational Liberation during World War II.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hoxha, as first secretary and as the only surviving member of\r\nthe small group of Communists who founded the Party, was considered the\r\nleader and the foremost Albanian Marxist-Leninist, he and Shehu have\r\nshared almost equal power since 1949 (see ch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\nThe real base of their power has rested in the security and armed\r\nforces, and Hoxha and Shehu have divided this power. As minister of\r\ndefense until 1953, Hoxha personally controlled the armed forces, and\r\nsince then he has controlled them through Beqir Balluku, his lieutenant\r\n(see ch. 9, Internal and External Security).\r\n\r\nShehu, as minister of the interior from 1948 to 1954, personally\r\ncontrolled the security forces, composed of the Directorate of State\r\nSecurity (Drejtorija e Sigurimit te Shtetit, commonly known as the\r\nSigurimi), the People's Police, and the Frontier Guards. Since then he\r\nhas controlled them through his brother-in-law Major General Kadri\r\nHasbiu, who succeeded Shehu as minister of the interior in 1954 and who\r\nstill held that position in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe top executive branches of the Politburo were the four-man\r\nSecretariat and the various directorates of the Central Committee. In\r\n1970 the Secretariat was composed of Hoxha as first secretary and Ramiz\r\nAlia, Hysni Kapo, and Xhafer Spahiu as secretaries. Hoxha supervised the\r\nwhole work of the Secretariat; the other three secretaries were\r\nresponsible for general areas of operation. Alia was responsible for\r\nideological affairs, Kapo for organizational matters, and Spahiu for the\r\nstate administration.\r\n\r\nPolicy guidelines adopted by the Politburo were passed by the\r\nSecretariat to the appropriate directorate, which elaborated and\r\ndrafted them in final form for implementation by the respective Party\r\nand state organs. The directorates had direct connections with all\r\nimplementing bodies. For instance, the Directorate of Agitation and\r\nPropaganda, known as Agitprop, issued directives not only to the\r\nAgitprop sections of the District Party Committees but also to all\r\npropaganda outlets in the government, mass organizations, and the armed\r\nand security forces.\r\n\r\nThe most important directorates were the: Directorate of Cadres and\r\nOrganizations, headed by Hysni Kapo, the third ranking man in the Party\r\nhierarchy; Directorate of Agitation and Propaganda, headed by Ramiz\r\nAlia; Directorate of Education and Culture, headed by Nexhmije Hoxha,\r\nwife of the first secretary; Directorate of State Administrative Organs,\r\nheaded by Llazi Stratoberdha; and Directorate of Mass Organizations,\r\nheaded by Politburo member Adil Carcani.\r\n\r\nWhen important policy issues were decided by the Politburo, special\r\ncommissions were created in the Central Committee to draft implementing\r\nguidance for a specific decision. Thus, for instance, in the spring of\r\n1968 the Politburo decided on a complete reorganization and\r\nreorientation of the country's educational system. A Central Commission\r\non Education was immediately created in the Party Central Committee; the\r\ncommission was headed by Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu and included some\r\nfifty experts in the ideological, academic, and military aspects of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nAfter a year's work the commission completed its report and, in June\r\n1969, submitted it to the Central Committee, which gave its formal stamp\r\nof approval. In December of the same year the government submitted a\r\nbill to the People's Assembly for the reorganization of the educational\r\nsystem; in its preamble the bill said that it was based on the report of\r\nthe previous June as approved by the Party Central Committee (see ch. 5,\r\nSocial System).\r\n\r\nThe Central Committee was the next highest echelon in importance in the\r\nParty organization. In 1970 it was composed of sixty-one regular and\r\nthirty-six candidate members. It was to the Central Committee that the\r\nPolitburo submitted its policy decisions for formal approval. As a rule,\r\nin recent years the Central Committee has approved Politburo reports and\r\ndecisions with little, if any, debate. But there have been occasions\r\nwhen the Central Committee has been called upon to decide on issues of\r\nthe utmost importance for the country. For example, in February 1948 the\r\nCentral Committee was convened to discuss and decide the issue of a\r\npossible merger of Albania with Yugoslavia. Although the forces favoring\r\nsuch a merger were in the majority, the dissenting voices were\r\nsufficient to block the proposed merger. Another Central Committee\r\nmeeting, held in September of the same year, purged the top Party group\r\nthat had advocated the merger with Yugoslavia. A similar crucial issue\r\narose in the fall of 1961 on the question of relations with the Soviet\r\nUnion. The Central Committee approved the Politburo decision to break\r\nwith Moscow and issued a declaration to that effect.\r\n\r\nThe Party's ideological principles, tasks, and organizational structure\r\nwere delineated in the Party's statute, originally adopted by the First\r\nParty Congress in 1948 and amended several times since then. In it,\r\ncontrol by the Party was detailed specifically, and the statute rather\r\nthan the Constitution was the fundamental law of the land. According to\r\nthe statute, the highest leading organ of each organization was: the\r\ngeneral meeting for the basic Party organizations; the conference for\r\nthe Party organizations of districts and cities; and the congress for\r\nthe entire Party.\r\n\r\nThe guiding principle of the ideological and organizational structure of\r\nthe Party was the Leninist dictum known as democratic centralism. As\r\ndescribed in the statute, this principle provided in theory that the\r\nleading organs of the Party were elected from bottom to top at general\r\nmeetings, conferences, and congresses; these organs were obliged from\r\ntime to time to give account of their activities before their Party\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nStrict Party discipline was to be maintained under any circumstances,\r\nthe minority being subject to the majority; decisions were to be reached\r\non the basis of so-called free discussions but, from the moment a\r\ndecision was reached, unanimously or by a majority of votes, all Party\r\nmembers were obliged to execute it without question; and the decisions\r\nof the higher Party organs were binding on the lower organs. The statute\r\nalso provided that collective leadership was the highest principle of\r\nthe leadership of the Party and that the elected organs as well as the\r\nbasic Party organizations examined and solved collectively all Party\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nThe Party statute considered the Party Congress as the highest Party\r\norgan. The congress, usually called every four years, heard, examined,\r\nand approved the reports of the Central Committee and of other central\r\nParty organs; reviewed and made changes in the Party program and\r\nstatute; determined the Party's tactical line on major policy problems;\r\nand elected the Central Committee and the Central Control and Auditing\r\nCommission and fixed the number of members of these two bodies. In\r\nactual practice, however, the Party Congress merely heard and approved\r\nreports submitted by the Politburo.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statute, the Central Committee, which should meet in\r\nplenum at least once every four months, performed such formal functions\r\nas electing both the Politburo for guiding the affairs of the Central\r\nCommittee between sessions and the Secretariat for \"guiding the\r\nday-to-day affairs of the Party, especially for organizing the control\r\nof the execution of decisions and for the selection of cadres.\" During\r\nthe period between two congresses the Central Committee guided the\r\nactivities of the Party; represented the Party in its relationships with\r\nother parties, organizations, and institutions; organized and guided\r\ndifferent Party institutions; named the editors of the Party's central\r\npress organs and granted permission for publication of the local Party\r\npress; distributed the cadres and the means of the Party and\r\nadministered the central treasury; and guided and controlled the\r\nactivities of the central organs of the people's democratic authority\r\nand social organizations by means of Party groups in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegional Organization\r\n\r\nRegionally, the highest Party organ is the Party Conference at district\r\nand city levels, which is supposed to meet once a year and is comparable\r\nto the Party Congress at the national level. In practice, the periodic\r\nParty Conference becomes a pro forma meeting held for the purpose of\r\ndisplaying unanimity of opinion. Between conferences, operations are\r\nconducted by Party committees, and real power is exercised by a bureau\r\nof each committee that usually consists of about eleven members, who\r\nmust first be approved by the Party Central Committee in Tirana. Bureau\r\nmembership includes two secretaries who are the leading Communist\r\nofficials in the city or district and, by virtue of their positions, the\r\nmost powerful individuals.\r\n\r\nThe principal functions of the district or city committees are to guide\r\nthe activities of all Party organizations in the district or town so as\r\nto assure the precise application of the Party line; approve the\r\nestablishment of basic Party organizations; maintain records on members\r\nand look after their ideological and political education; distribute\r\nwithin the district or city the Party cadres; and administer the Party\r\nfinances. More importantly, the district or city committee guides and\r\nregulates the activities and work of the local governmental bodies and\r\nsocial organizations by means of Party groups within them.\r\n\r\nThe statute describes the basic Party organizations as the foundations\r\nof the Party because they serve to link the working masses of the town\r\nand village with the Party. The basic Party organizations are\r\nestablished in factories and plants, agricultural enterprises, machine\r\ntractor stations, villages, units of the armed and security forces,\r\nstate administration, schools, and other work centers where there were\r\nno less than three Party members. When deemed necessary and where there\r\nare less than three Party members, there can be created joint groups of\r\nthe Party and of the Union of Albanian Working Youth. These groups are\r\ndirected by a Party member chosen by the district or city committee.\r\n\r\nThe basic Party organizations are assigned a multitude of duties and\r\nresponsibilities. They must ensure that Party orders are fully\r\nimplemented, the masses are politically oriented, the Communists obtain\r\nthe required ideological and political education, new members are\r\naccepted into the Party, the masses are mobilized in production work,\r\nthe activities of the mass organizations are checked and guided, and\r\ncontrol is exercised over all economic sectors and over all local\r\ngovernmental bodies.\r\n\r\nThe statute provides that in the armed forces Party affairs are to be\r\ndirected by the Political Directorate of the Ministry of People's\r\nDefense and in the Ministry of the Interior they are to be directed by\r\nappropriate political organs. Party organizations in the armed forces\r\noperate on the basis of special instructions issued by the Party's\r\nCentral Committee. All chiefs of political branches in military units\r\nand installations must be Party members with no less than five years of\r\nmembership. The political organs in the military units are required to\r\nmaintain close contact with the local Party committees (see ch. 9,\r\nInternal and External Security).\r\n\r\nThe latest official figures for Party membership were given by Party\r\nFirst Secretary Hoxha in his report to the Fifth Party Congress in 1966.\r\nHe placed the total membership at 66,327, of which 3,314 were candidate\r\nmembers. Since the Fourth Party Congress in 1961 the membership had\r\ngrown by 12,688. According to Hoxha, the social composition of the Party\r\nmembership was as follows: workers, 32.9 percent; collective farmers,\r\n25.8 percent; private farmers, 3.2 percent; state, Party, and mass\r\norganization officials and armed forces personnel, 37.2 percent; and\r\nstudents and housewives, 0.9 percent. Of the total Party membership,\r\nwomen comprised 12.5 percent. Hoxha also said that nearly 68 percent of\r\nall Communists lived in cities and only 32 percent in villages, despite\r\nthe fact, he commented, that the rural population was three times as\r\nlarge as that of the cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nParty Operations\r\n\r\nA fundamental factor in the Party's exercise of political power and\r\ncontrol is the selection of candidates for all elected positions.\r\nAlthough the candidates for such elective organs as the People's\r\nAssembly, the people's courts, and the people's councils at all levels\r\nare formally nominated by the meetings of mass organizations or of\r\nworkers and peasants, they have been, in fact, handpicked by the local\r\nParty organizations and approved by the Party Central Committee.\r\n\r\nThe procedure at all nominating meetings is standard and simple: a list\r\nof candidates, previously prepared by the Party district or city\r\ncommittee, is read; the qualifications of each candidate are described;\r\nand the list is unanimously approved. Since the first national and local\r\nelections held in 1945 in which the list of candidates included\r\nnon-Party people, lists have been restricted to Party members only.\r\nVeterans of Hoxha's partisan forces of the so-called War of National\r\nLiberation still predominate among candidates for office.\r\n\r\nA similar situation prevails with regard to the appointment of\r\ngovernment officials. After each national election, the People's\r\nAssembly has appointed a new government. The procedure for this\r\nappointment has never varied: at the first meeting of the new People's\r\nAssembly the Party First Secretary has submitted for approval the list\r\nof the new ministers, which invariably has received unanimous approval.\r\nBecause of purges in the top echelons of the Party, especially in the\r\nlate 1940s and early 1950s, the government list has undergone several\r\nchanges. Since the elimination of the pro-Yugoslav faction in 1948,\r\nhowever, these changes have affected mostly the technical and economic\r\nministries. The three key posts in the government, however--namely,\r\nthose of prime minister, minister of the interior, and minister of\r\ndefense--have been consistently held by Enver Hoxha and Mehmet Shehu or\r\ntheir trusted lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of all government officials as well as the managers of\r\nthe state economic enterprises rested formally with the agencies\r\ninvolved, but no official has been appointed without the prior approval\r\nof the appropriate Party organization. In reality, all key positions are\r\nheld by Party cadres who have been selected and appointed by the Party\r\ndistrict or city committees. The Party statute empowers the basic Party\r\norganizations in all governmental organs and economic enterprises to\r\ncheck and guide the activities of all officials and to see that they are\r\nproperly oriented in the political and ideological fields. The prime\r\nrequisite in filling these positions is Party loyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\nParty Schools\r\n\r\nIn 1970 the Party operated a number of schools and courses for its\r\ncadres as well as three research and study institutes, attached to the\r\nCentral Committee. The highest school was the V.I. Lenin Institute,\r\nheaded by Fiqrete Shehu, wife of the prime minister. It was attended by\r\nthe higher and more promising Party members.\r\n\r\nThe three Party institutes were the Institute of Marxist-Leninist\r\nStudies, headed by Nexhmije Hoxha, wife of Enver Hoxha; the Institute of\r\nParty History, headed by Ndreci Plasari, who was also editor in chief of\r\nthe Party's theoretical monthly, _Rruga e Partise_ (Party Path); and the\r\nInstitute for Economic Studies, under the direction of Myqerem Fuga. In\r\naddition, there were a number of secondary Party schools for training\r\nlow-level Party functionaries and one-year schools for refresher\r\nideological courses, attended both by Party officials and leaders of\r\nmass organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Party also operated intermittently, as the need arose, political\r\ncourses and study groups for its activists and propagandists. In 1969,\r\nfor example, more than 20,000 study centers were organized throughout\r\nthe country for the study of the official, newly published _History of\r\nthe Workers' Party of Albania_. The teaching program of all the Party\r\nschools and study centers included such topics as the importance of\r\nCommunist education; the origins and development of Communist morality;\r\nsocialist attitudes toward work and property; the importance of\r\npatriotic education; the history, theories, and tactics of the\r\ninternational Communist movement; and the history and statutes of the\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n\r\nMass Organizations\r\n\r\nIn its exercise of power and control over every phase of the people's\r\nlives, the Party also utilizes several mass, or social, organizations,\r\nthe most important of which are the Democratic Front, the Union of\r\nAlbanian Working Youth, the Union of Albanian Women, and the United\r\nTrade Unions of Albania. In a speech at the Fourth Congress of the\r\nDemocratic Front held in September 1967, Enver Hoxha said that the mass\r\norganizations, as components of the system of the dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat were \"levers of the Party for its ties with the masses\" and\r\nthat they carried out their political, executive, and organizational\r\nwork in such a way as to enable the Party directives to be correctly\r\nunderstood and implemented by all segments of the population.\r\n\r\nParty Secretary Hysni Kapo, in a speech delivered at a Party seminar in\r\nJanuary 1970, declared that the Party carried out its mission through\r\nits own organizations and through the activities of its \"levers, the\r\nmass organizations, such as the trade unions, youth, Democratic Front,\r\nwomen's, and the people's councils,\" thus revealing that even the\r\npeople's councils were mere Party levers. By relying on these powerful\r\nlevers, Kapo added, the Party guaranteed its links with the masses and\r\nobtained their support for its policies. He remarked further that,\r\nalthough there were not Communists in every family in the country,\r\neveryone in the family belonged to some kind of organization.\r\n\r\nThe Party has set the implementation of its line as a general primary\r\ngoal for all mass organizations. Considered as powerful Party levers,\r\nthey are required to convey the Party line to the people and to bring to\r\nthe Party the people's attitudes and grievances. As Party instruments\r\nthey must mobilize, organize, and orient the people during the process\r\nof the building of socialism. The mass organizations also assist the\r\nParty in its control over the administration and management of state\r\nenterprises and initiate new actions and new movements in all work\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nThe Party places particular importance on the Union of Albanian Working\r\nYouth, described officially in such terms as the \"greatest revolutionary\r\nforce of inexhaustible strength,\" a \"strong fighting reserve of the\r\nParty,\" and a \"vital force of our revolution.\" According to the Party\r\nstatute, the union operates directly under the guidance of the Party,\r\nand the union's local organizations are guided and checked by the\r\nappropriate district or city Party committees. Organized in the same way\r\nas the Party, the union has parallel basic organizations, district and\r\ncity committees, a Central Committee, a Politburo, and a Central Control\r\nand Auditing Commission. In 1967 official reports credited the youth\r\norganization with 210,000 members, ranging in age from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-five and, in a few cases, even older.\r\n\r\nThe main function of the union is to select and prepare future Party\r\nmembers. It is also required by the Party to control all Pioneer\r\norganizations, which embrace all children from seven to fourteen years\r\nof age; to see to it that all Party directives and policies are\r\nimplemented by the country's youth, especially in schools and in\r\nmilitary units; and to mobilize the youth into so-called voluntary labor\r\nbrigades to work on production projects. The Party often gives the union\r\nspecial storm trooper or Red Guard types of missions to perform. For\r\nexample, in February 1967 Enver Hoxha assigned to the organization the\r\nmission of shutting down all places of worship in the country; within a\r\nperiod of a few months, the union had accomplished its mission.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Front, successor to the National Liberation Front, was\r\ndefined by Enver Hoxha, who has headed it since 1945 and was still its\r\npresident in 1970, as the greatest political revolutionary organization\r\nof the Albanian people and as a powerful weapon of the Party for the\r\npolitical union of the people. In 1970 the Democratic Front continued to\r\nbe a key element in the Party's control mechanism. Considered officially\r\nas the broadest mass organization, it was supposed to give expression to\r\nthe political views of the entire population and to serve as a school\r\nfor mass political education.\r\n\r\nThe tasks and objectives of the Democratic Front, as set forth in its\r\nstatute and as constantly reiterated by Party leaders, include the\r\nstrengthening of political unity among the people and the mobilizing of\r\nthe people for the implementation of Party policies. The spreading of\r\nthe Marxist-Leninist ideology is also a task of the front, as is the\r\npurging of any attitudes that are considered backward and reactionary.\r\nIn essence, the front is an instrument of the Party, expressly designed\r\nfor the political control of the entire population. Enver Hoxha declared\r\nin a speech to the Fourth Congress of the Democratic Front in 1967 that\r\nall citizens over age eighteen were members of the front, including\r\nParty members and members of all other mass organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Union of Albanian Women is also referred to as a powerful weapon of\r\nthe Party. The union, headed in 1970 by Vito Kapo, wife of Secretary of\r\nthe Party Central Committee Hysni Kapo, controls and supervises the\r\npolitical and social activities of the country's women, handles their\r\nideological training, and spearheads the Party's campaign for the\r\nemancipation of women. The campaign was launched by Hoxha in June 1967\r\nand renewed in October 1969 in a Hoxha speech to the Party Central\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe Union of Albanian Women, according to reports by visitors has a good\r\nrecord of assistance to the Party in making legal, economic, and social\r\nequality for women a reality. By 1970 women shared responsibility in the\r\ngovernment at all levels, had entered all the professions, and worked\r\nside by side with men for equal pay in most occupations.\r\n\r\nBy 1967 the union was able to boast that more than 284,000 women took\r\npart in production in some way, mostly in industrial plants and\r\nagricultural collectives. In the same year there were about 40 women,\r\nout of a total of 240 deputies, in the People's Assembly; 1,878 women in\r\nthe people's councils; and 1,170 in the people's courts.\r\n\r\nSince 1967 task forces of women from the cities have been dispatched to\r\ntour backward regions, particularly the highlands, explaining the\r\nParty's line on the emancipation of Albanian women. Reforms such as\r\ngiving women equal rights to inherit property, an equal voice in the\r\npeople's councils, and equal political rights, however, have created\r\nconsiderable hostility in a country where man has traditionally been the\r\nmaster of the family.\r\n\r\nThe tasks of the United Trade Unions are similar to those of the\r\nDemocratic Front, albeit on a more limited scale. During ceremonies in\r\nFebruary 1970 marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of\r\nthe trade unions, it was stated that they were created by the Party,\r\nthat they had since struggled to implement the Party line, and that they\r\nrecognized the Party leadership as the \"decisive factor of their force\r\nand vitality.\" It was stated further that they were created jointly with\r\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat for its consolidation and defense\r\nand as an important component part of this dictatorship.\r\n\r\nIn a conference in Tirana on February 10, 1970, Gogo Nushi, then\r\npresident of the trade unions, boasted that they had become powerful\r\nlevers of the Party in implementing the Party line among all the\r\ncountry's workers, who had grown from some 30,000 in February 1945 to\r\nabout 400,000 in February 1970. At the same conference Politburo member\r\nAdil Carcani, in a speech dealing with the functions of the trade\r\nunions, attributed to them the task of exercising control over all\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nOther duties and responsibilities of the trade unions in 1970, according\r\nto Tonin Jakova, General Secretary of the General Council of the United\r\nTrade Unions of Albania, were to carry out the political and ideological\r\neducation of the workers; to influence all the other strata of the\r\npopulation so that the class ideology should gradually become the sole\r\nideology of the society; to broaden their control and sphere of action\r\nin all fields of life--political, ideological, cultural, artistic,\r\nsocial, economic, and educational; to increase labor productivity by\r\nincreasing work norms; and to struggle against old traditions and\r\nbackward customs, with emphasis on religious beliefs. In listing the\r\nduties and responsibilities of the trade unions not a word was said\r\nabout their safeguarding the interests of the workers, such as improving\r\ntheir living and bargaining with the management.\r\n\r\nOrganizationally, the United Trade Unions of Albania was composed in\r\n1970 of three general unions--the Trade Union of Workers of Industry and\r\nConstruction, consisting of workers in industry, mines, construction,\r\nand transportation; the Trade Union of Workers of Education and Trade,\r\nmade up of the workers in the state administration, trade, health,\r\neducation, and culture; and the Trade Union of Workers of Agriculture\r\nand Procurements, composed of workers in agriculture, forestry, and\r\nprocurements. Over 2,000 individual trade union organizations existed in\r\nenterprises, factories, plants, offices, schools, and other work\r\ncenters and cultural and social institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of political power through the Party, the mass\r\norganizations, the state organs, and the security and armed forces, the\r\nTirana rulers have consistently followed Stalinist methods of rule. In\r\nmajor policy speeches these rulers have in recent years often praised\r\nStalin's political system and have consistently attempted to emulate it\r\nin Albania. As _Zeri i Popullit_ (Voice of the People) phrased it on\r\nApril 13, 1963, \"without reinstating Stalin and his work, [throughout\r\nthe Communist world] our revolutionary movement and the cause of\r\nMarxism-Leninism can make no headway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\nAfter centuries of foreign domination, Albania in 1912 was ill prepared\r\nfor independence, and the chaos brought by the Balkan wars and by World\r\nWar I allowed little opportunity for the development of statehood. One\r\nof its first moves in foreign relations was to secure support for its\r\nindependence from some of the great powers of Europe. In the years\r\nbetween World War I and World War II, Albanian foreign policy was\r\ndominated by the Italians.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately after World War II, Albania was a satellite of\r\nYugoslavia, which in turn was a satellite of the Soviet Union. This\r\nsituation deprived Albania of any initiative in foreign affairs, and it\r\nremained out of the mainstream of Eastern European affairs until 1948,\r\nwhen ties with Yugoslavia were broken and Albania became a full-fledged\r\nsatellite of the Soviet Union. Albania's position vis-à-vis the other\r\nsatellite countries was improved when it came under the direct tutelage\r\nof the Soviet Union; it then became the recipient of economic aid,\r\nmilitary assistance, and military and economic advisers, not only from\r\nits powerful sponsor but also from the other Communist nations. In time\r\nit also became a member of the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Economic\r\nMutual Assistance.\r\n\r\nSoviet influence in Albanian affairs was pervasive from 1948 to 1960\r\nbut, from a material point of view, Albania benefited from the\r\nrelationship. The Soviets canceled a large debt and sent aid and\r\nadvisers to help develop the backward Albania economy. Internally, the\r\nruling elite, headed by Enver Hoxha, maintained a rigid regime of the\r\nStalinist type. In foreign affairs the country became a cold war\r\nparticipant completely accepting directions from Moscow.\r\n\r\nIts thirteen years as a Soviet satellite were years of turmoil for\r\nAlbania, particularly after the death of Joseph Stalin and the rise of\r\nNikita Khrushchev to the Soviet leadership. Khrushchev's policy of\r\nseeking a rapprochement with Yugoslavia worried both Hoxha, the Party\r\nleader, and Shehu, the premier, because of the difficulties they had\r\nencountered in purging their Party of a strong pro-Yugoslav faction\r\nwhile in the process of securing their own positions of power. In the\r\nAlbanian view Stalin had been a great hero, and Tito of Yugoslavia, a\r\ngreat villain. Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin and wooing of Tito\r\nbrought consternation to Tirana, but reliance on Soviet aid apparently\r\ntempered Albanian reactions.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1950s the Albanian leadership, coaxed by Moscow, made some\r\nattempts at restoring normal relations with Yugoslavia. After the riots\r\nin Poland and the revolt in Hungary in 1956, however, the Albanians\r\nraised strident voices against Yugoslavia's so-called revisionism--that\r\nis the alleged perversion of Marxism-Leninism--which they asserted was\r\nthe basis for the troubles afflicting Eastern Europe. According to\r\nofficial Albanian dogma the two greatest evils in the world were\r\nrevisionism and imperialism, personified, respectively, by Yugoslavia\r\nand the United States. Toward the end of the 1950s it became apparent to\r\nHoxha and Shehu that they were closer ideologically to Peking than to\r\nMoscow, and only the latter's economic aid prevented an open break.\r\n\r\nIn 1960, as Khrushchev sought to line up Communist parties for a\r\ncondemnation of Communist China, Albania refused to participate and, by\r\nthe end of the year, the Soviet-Albanian dispute was made known openly.\r\nBy the end of 1961 diplomatic relations between the two countries were\r\nsevered, Soviet aid ceased, and Soviet advisers and technicians left\r\nAlbania, to be replaced by those of Communist China. Although not\r\nformally breaking off diplomatic relations, the other Eastern European\r\nCommunist countries also halted aid programs and withdrew advisers.\r\nKhrushchev then became the object of violent attacks in the Albanian\r\npress, being castigated as more of a revisionist than Tito. Khrushchev\r\ncounterattacked to defend himself but, in addition, used Albania as a\r\nproxy for violent propaganda blasts that were obviously directed against\r\nthe Chinese Communists.\r\n\r\nAfter the final break with the Soviet Union, Albania entered the third\r\nstage of its Communist existence--the alliance with Communist China.\r\nStages one and two had been as a satellite, first of Yugoslavia and then\r\nof the Soviet Union. In stage three, if not a satellite, it was a client\r\nof a powerful sponsor. Albania, throughout the 1960s and into 1970,\r\ncontinued to require the economic support of an outside power. Communist\r\nChina has provided that support, though apparently on a much reduced\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nIn return for Chinese support the Albanians accept the Chinese view of\r\nworld affairs and speak for their sponsor in Eastern Europe and in the\r\nUnited Nations. Albania successfully defied Moscow, but its internal and\r\ninternational positions remained weak. In 1968 Hoxha withdrew his\r\ncountry from the Warsaw Pact in protest against the invasion of\r\nCzechoslovakia, but this was primarily a symbolic move because Albania\r\nhad not participated in Warsaw Pact affairs since 1961.\r\n\r\nBy 1970 Albania was attempting to normalize relations with its Balkan\r\nneighbors, but its main propaganda thrusts continued to be against\r\nrevisionism and imperialism. Overtures toward both Greece and Yugoslavia\r\nwere made in 1970, which may indicate that the Hoxha regime recognized\r\nthe futility and danger of an isolationist policy. Official attitudes\r\ntoward the Soviet Union remained as they had been for ten\r\nyears--strident and abusive--but better relations were being sought\r\namong Eastern European nations as well as with some non-Communist\r\nstates. Seemingly the regime recognized that Communist China was a\r\ndistant ally, that the Chinese could not support the Albanian economy,\r\nand that, if Albania was to remain a viable national entity, it would\r\nhave to relate to its European neighbors and, in effect, become a part\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation channels in 1970 were relatively well developed compared\r\nwith those of the pre-World War II period. The press was the most\r\nadvanced, although by 1970 a substantial radio network existed.\r\nThroughout the 1960s there was only a single experimental television\r\ntransmitter, at the end of 1969, however, the government reportedly\r\nrequested the French to install a television system.\r\n\r\nThe press and radio were indispensable instruments in the efforts of the\r\nAlbanian Workers' Party (Communist Party) to revolutionize all aspects\r\nof life. To supplement the formal channels, there were several thousand\r\nParty activists who orally transmitted the Party line to the people on a\r\nmore personal and informal level.\r\n\r\nThe various aspects of culture, such as literature, art, music, and\r\ndrama, were also structured to promote the goals of the Party. They have\r\nbeen used extensively to promote support among the masses for the Party\r\nand its principles, to combat religion, and generally to increase the\r\npolitical and social consciousness of the people.\r\n\r\nThe guidelines set forth by the Party for all writers and artists to\r\nfollow in their creative endeavors are the principles of socialist\r\nrealism. The general definition of this approach to art and literature\r\nis that the form of creative works must be national, but their content\r\nmust be socialist. The principle of art for art's sake has been rejected\r\nby the Communist leaders. All cultural developments must reflect the\r\nefforts to create a socialist society.\r\n\r\nThe information media are controlled by the Party directly or indirectly\r\nthrough the government and such organizations as labor unions, youth\r\ngroups, and cultural societies. Private ownership of such media has been\r\nprohibited since the Communist regime came to power.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE INFORMATION MEDIA\r\n\r\nThe media are invaluable instruments for the achievement of the goals of\r\nthe Communist leaders. When the Communist regime came to power in\r\nNovember 1944, it seized control of all such media, although they were\r\nnot formally nationalized until 1946. From the outset, the press and\r\nradio were used to justify and extend Communist rule. In general, the\r\nfunction of the media has been to propagate Marxist-Leninist ideology,\r\nas modified to relate to the specific conditions in Albania, and to\r\nliquidate the traditional religious, social, and economic beliefs of the\r\npeople (see ch. 4, The People; ch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nThe functions of the media have remained essentially unchanged\r\nthroughout the twenty-six years of rule by the Albanian Workers' Party.\r\nThe leaders have used the media extensively in their efforts to\r\nrevolutionize all aspects of the national life. In this connection,\r\nthere are many specific functions performed by the press and radio that\r\ngenerally fall into the categories of education, organization, and\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe first functional category has two aspects: the press and radio are\r\ninstruments of political and social indoctrination, and they help to\r\nraise the educational and cultural levels of the masses. In practice,\r\nhowever, these two aspects are often combined--that is, in the process\r\nof education, Marxist-Leninist ideology is usually interjected. In\r\ngeneral, the educational function has been performed by conducting\r\ncampaigns against illiteracy and ignorance, encouraging maximum\r\nutilization of the educational and cultural facilities set up throughout\r\nthe country, and making literary works accessible to the population (see\r\nch. 5, Social System).\r\n\r\nThe media, in the final analysis, are used to saturate the population\r\nwith Marxist-Leninist ideology. The content of the media--whether it is\r\nnews, music, or literature--is structured to promote the goals of the\r\nParty and designed to further the building of a Communist society. In\r\norder to facilitate ideological indoctrination, content is devised to\r\nappeal to sentiments of Albanian nationalism. The development of\r\ncommunism, for example, is related to the theme of developing the nation\r\nand preserving its independence; and Enver Hoxha, the Party leader, is\r\nquoted as frequently as are Marx and Lenin.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important uses of the press and radio, which falls into\r\nthe category of organization, has been to mobilize the people actively\r\nto support, and participate in, the implementation of specific policies,\r\nsuch as the fulfillment of economic plans or antireligious campaigns.\r\nOften, in conjunction with mobilization campaigns, the media are used to\r\ntransmit specific information that is necessary for the implementation\r\nof various aspects of the policies. In the economic sphere, for example,\r\ndiscussions of industrial processes or agriculture often appear in the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nThe media are also means of Party control over officials at all levels\r\nof the government and the Party hierarchies, as well as over the\r\npopulation in general. This function is performed primarily through\r\nexposure of corruption, negligence, and inefficiency on the part of\r\nvarious officials or workers or by issuing warnings against such crimes\r\nand behavior. In addition, the press and radio are channels through\r\nwhich the top leaders issue directives or communicate changes in the\r\nParty line to the lower level administrators and activists throughout\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the pervasive role of the press was stressed in the\r\nfollowing statement by Enver Hoxha that was quoted in the December 1965\r\nissue of _Rruga e Partise_ (Party Path): \"Without the press there can be\r\nno education of the masses; without the press there can be no\r\nconscientious mobilization of them, organization, nor solution to the\r\nproblems of the economic and cultural construction in the new socialist\r\nsociety.\" Although the article dealt specifically with the press, it can\r\nbe assumed that the role assigned to it also pertains to the other media\r\nof communication.\r\n\r\nThe functions assigned to the media necessitate strict control over\r\ntheir operation and content by the Party. Although there appears to be\r\nno formal institution for censorship, an elaborate system was created\r\nwhereby the Party leaders could maintain the necessary control either\r\ndirectly or indirectly through the government and mass organizations.\r\n\r\nFragmentary information suggests that the Party leaders have several\r\nmechanisms for the maintenance of control over the dissemination of\r\ninformation. Within the Party there is a hierarchical organization that\r\nimplements decisions made by the Party leaders concerning public\r\ninformation and propaganda activities. It is headed by the Directorate\r\nof Agitation and Propaganda, which is directly under the Central\r\nCommittee of the Party. The directorate is divided into various\r\nfunctional sectors, for example, one dealing with the press. Throughout\r\nthe Party and government hierarchies, as well as in the mass\r\norganizations, there are sections for agitation and propaganda that are\r\ndirected by the central directorate.\r\n\r\nThe Political Bureau (Politburo), the highest decision-making body of\r\nthe Albanian Workers' Party, formulates policy concerning ideological\r\nindoctrination and the use of the media of mass communication. The\r\nDirectorate of Agitation and Propaganda coordinates the implementation\r\nof such policy (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most effective control mechanism is that which is built into\r\nthe Party structure and in the Party's relationship to the government\r\nand to society in general. The media are formally owned and operated by\r\nthe government with the exception of the Party press and publications of\r\nthe mass organizations. Since all government officials are members of\r\nthe Party or its front organization, the Democratic Front, and since the\r\nmass organizations are dominated by Party members, Party supervision of\r\nall publications is assured. Radio broadcasters, film directors and\r\neditors, administrators and editors of the publishing houses,\r\njournalists, and newspaper editors are also Party members.\r\n\r\nThus all individuals who work with the mass media, either directly or\r\nindirectly, are subject to Party discipline. Failure to adhere to\r\ndirectives from the Politburo is a crime against the Party, and\r\npunishment for such crimes can be severe (see ch. 6, Government\r\nStructure and Political System).\r\n\r\nTo supplement the formal media of communication, there are about 25,000\r\nParty agitators who propagandize among the masses. These agitators work\r\nin factories, villages, neighborhoods, and on farms with the objective\r\nof bringing the Party line to every individual. Besides explaining the\r\ncontent of the press and radio to the people, the agitators conduct\r\ncourses, present lectures, and guide discussions on Party history, the\r\noppressiveness of religion, friendship with Communist China, Soviet\r\nrevisionism, and other such topics. For example, in the weekly meetings\r\nheld for women, emphasis is placed upon how religion causes\r\ndiscrimination against them.\r\n\r\nIn the factories the agitators explain the Party line to their coworkers\r\nand rally them to compete to outproduce each other, a practice called\r\nsocialist competition. Agitators in rural areas are usually of peasant\r\norigin and consequently are better able to gain the trust of the\r\npeasantry. They explain the Party line to them in a manner that is\r\nrelevant to local conditions and mobilize them to produce their quotas.\r\n\r\nThe agitators also sponsor cultural and sports activities, such as\r\norganizing trips to museums and arranging for athletic events. When new\r\nlaws are passed, the agitators explain them to the masses in terms that\r\nthey will understand. Before elections the agitators mobilize the people\r\nto go out and vote, even though there is only one candidate on the\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nTo aid the agitators in their work, the _Agitators' Notebook_ is\r\npublished monthly listing the various points of the Party line which do\r\nchange from time to time. The agitators also have books, pamphlets,\r\npictures, and films to facilitate the indoctrination of the masses. In\r\naddition to the activities of the agitators, the Statutes of the\r\nAlbanian Workers' Party require that all Party members work to educate\r\nthe masses in Marxist-Leninist ideology. The same requirement is made\r\nof the members of the Union of Albanian Working Youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS\r\n\r\nThe press is the most developed of the information media. According to\r\nofficial statistics, in 1967 there were nineteen newspapers and\r\nthirty-four periodicals as compared with six and fifteen, respectively,\r\nin 1938. Circulation figures per issue for all newspapers and\r\nperiodicals are not available, but the government statistics indicate\r\nthat total circulation for newspapers increased by about sixteen times\r\nbetween 1938 and 1967, and the figures for periodicals indicate a\r\nsixfold increase for the same period.\r\n\r\nMost publications originate in Tirana, although during the 1960s the\r\nregime began to establish local newspapers. Information on the press is\r\nsparse, and it is difficult to ascertain how many publications were in\r\ncirculation in 1970; there are indications that new publications were\r\nadded, while others were consolidated after 1967.\r\n\r\nThere are three daily newspapers, all of which are published in Tirana\r\n(see table 7). _Zeri i Popullit_ (The Voice of the People) is published\r\nby the Central Committee of the Albanian Workers' Party, and in 1967 it\r\nhad a daily circulation of 86,000. _Bashkimi_ (Union) is published by\r\nthe Democratic Front and is the mouthpiece of the government. It had a\r\ndaily circulation of 20,000 in 1967. _Puna_ (Work) is the daily\r\nnewspaper of the Central Council of the United Trade Unions of Albania.\r\nIn 1967 it reportedly had a circulation of 18,000. _Zeri i Rinise_ (The\r\nVoice of Youth), a twice weekly newspaper of the Central Committee of\r\nthe Union of Albanian Working Youth, had a circulation of 36,000 in\r\n1967.\r\n\r\nCirculation figures do not necessarily give an accurate picture,\r\nhowever, because many of the subscriptions are held by institutions,\r\nlibraries, and cultural houses rather than by individuals. Factories,\r\nfarms, schools, and other institutions have reading rooms with\r\nsubscriptions to newspapers and magazines. In addition, the Party\r\nagitators frequently read articles aloud to groups. Thus there is\r\ngreater exposure to the press than the circulation figures indicate.\r\n\r\nLocal newspapers are all published by the local Party committees.\r\nExamples of such newspapers are: _Jeta e Re_ (New Life), published in\r\nShkoder; _Perpara_ (Forward), published in Korce; _Pararoja_ (Vanguard),\r\npublished in Gjirokaster; and _Adriatic_, which is published in Durres.\r\nThese newspapers have been assigned the function of explaining Party\r\npolicies in relation to the specific conditions found in the various\r\nlocalities. They also propagandize against religion and such so-called\r\ncrimes as laziness and indifference. Local newspapers give a great deal\r\nof attention to the economic, social, cultural, and political problems\r\nthat are specific to their districts.\r\n\r\n_Table 7.

These wall newspapers\r\nare usually single sheets that are posted on bulletin boards in\r\nfactories, farms, schools, offices, cultural houses, and other such\r\nplaces. They are usually written by either the Party agitators or\r\nmembers of the youth organization, and they serve the same purposes as\r\nthe formal press--that is, agitation for increased productivity by\r\nworkers and peasants, antireligious campaigns, and so on (see ch. 6,\r\nGovernment Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nThe periodical press is as important as the newspaper press and is\r\nslightly more diversified. The number of periodicals published grew from\r\nfifteen in 1938 to thirty-four in 1967. In 1967 there were almost twice\r\nas many periodicals published as newspapers. Thus it is possible to\r\ndesign many of the periodicals for consumption by specific audiences.\r\n\r\nThe Party, many government ministries, and each of the various mass\r\norganizations publish periodicals (see table 8). _Rruga e Partise_\r\n(Party Path) is the theoretical journal of the Party and is published by\r\nits Central Committee. _Ylli_ (Star) is the monthly illustrated review\r\nthat supplements _Zeri i Popullit_. It was first published in 1960.\r\n\r\n_Table 8.

It supplies all national and local newspapers with news items,\r\nas well as radio stations and the single television station. The agency\r\nhas agreements with foreign news agencies for the exchange of news\r\nitems.\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIO AND TELEVISION\r\n\r\nThe radio is another important instrument of political and social\r\nindoctrination. It was barely in existence when the Communist regime\r\ncame to power. In 1945 there were only two radio transmitters in the\r\nentire country. Since that time the radio system has been developing\r\nrapidly, although it still lags behind the press. In 1969 there were\r\nfifty-two radio transmitters, and in 1968 there were 150,000 receivers.\r\n\r\nThe radio system is under the jurisdiction of the Directorate of\r\nRadiobroadcasting, which is under the Council of Ministers. In\r\nactuality, however, the Party is in control because the members of the\r\ndirectorate, as well as all personnel involved in radio broadcasting,\r\nare Party members.\r\n\r\nAll but eight of the transmitters are shortwave, which is indicative of\r\nthe emphasis placed upon transmitting propaganda abroad. Broadcasts from\r\nmediumwave transmitters, however, are directed to the countries of\r\nEastern Europe, parts of the Soviet Union, Italy, and some Arab\r\ncountries. Shortwave is used for domestic programs in cases where the\r\nmountainous topography creates an obstacle to the mediumwaves.\r\n\r\nThere are only six radio stations in Albania (see table 9). Radio Tirana\r\nis the largest, with four mediumwave transmitters and forty-one\r\nshortwave transmitters. Radio Gjirokaster and Radio Korce each have only\r\none mediumwave transmitter. Radio Kukes and Radio Shkoder each have one\r\nmediumwave and one shortwave transmitter. Radio Stalin has only one\r\nshortwave transmitter. Radio Tirana broadcasts all of the programs\r\ndirected abroad and has the most powerful transmitter (50,000 watts) for\r\ndomestic programs, whereas local transmitters usually have only 200-watt\r\npower. Quite possibly the local stations simply relay programs from\r\nRadio Tirana.\r\n\r\nThe domestic service is on the air 13-½ hours daily and 17 hours on\r\nSundays. In 1969 domestic programs were scheduled between 4:30 and 7:00\r\nA.M. and 11:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. daily. The Sunday schedule was from\r\n5:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. Included in the domestic programs were twelve\r\ndaily newscasts, children's programs, theatrical presentations,\r\noperettas, and other types of cultural programs.\r\n\r\nForeign broadcasting is done in seventeen different languages and on\r\nfive beams directed to Latin America, North America, Africa, Asia, and\r\nAustralia. Besides Albanian, the foreign broadcasts are made in Arabic,\r\nBulgarian, Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian,\r\nItalian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, and\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\n_Table 9.

This probably was not because of a\r\nrelaxed attitude on the part of the ruling elite; rather, it was more\r\nlikely because of the lack of technology necessary for jamming\r\noperations and the expense involved.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 the Albanian government published statistics on the distribution\r\nof radio receivers by social composition. The categories of \"workers,\"\r\n\"employees,\" and \"peasants\" were not explicated; however, it can be\r\nassumed that workers refer to blue-collar workers or manual laborers and\r\nthat employees refer to white-collar workers or office, administrative,\r\nand professional personnel. In 1963, out of a total of 70,913 radio\r\nreceivers, 28,672 were owned by workers, 30,391 were owned by employees,\r\nand 6,303 were owned by peasants. Clubs and institutional enterprises\r\nheld 1,236 receivers, and 4,311 were listed under the heading \"other.\"\r\n\r\nThe Albanians opened their first television station for experimentation\r\nin May 1960. At the end of 1969 they were still experimenting,\r\ntransmitting programs three times a week. The government had reportedly\r\nasked the French to install a television network at the end of 1969. At\r\nthat time there were about 2,100 television receivers in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK PUBLISHING AND LIBRARIES\r\n\r\nThere were three book-publishing enterprises in 1970, all of which were\r\nlocated in Tirana. Ndermarja e botimeve ushtarake (Enterprise for\r\nMilitary Publications) was operated by the Ministry of National Defense.\r\nN.I.S.H. Shtypshkronjave \"Mihal Duri\" (State Printer \"Mihal Duri\") was\r\noperated by the Party, and Shtepia Botonjese \"Naim Frasheri\" (State\r\nPublishing House \"Naim Frasheri\") was directed by the Ministry of\r\nEducation and Culture. Ndermaja Shteterore Tregetimit te Librit (The\r\nBook Selling State Enterprise), located in Tirana, had a monopoly over\r\nthe distribution of books under the direction of the Ministry of\r\nEducation and Culture.\r\n\r\nAccording to official Albanian statistics, there were 628 books\r\npublished in 1967, with a total of 5,605,000 copies printed. This is a\r\ngreat increase over the number published in 1938: 61 books with a total\r\nof 183,000 copies printed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest statistics available, a total of 502 books were\r\npublished in 1965, of which 110 were literary works. Another 197 dealt\r\nwith the social sciences; 42, with philology; 61, with pure science; 47,\r\nwith the applied sciences; and 24, with geography and history. It was\r\nnot indicated how many of these titles were first editions or how many\r\nwere translations. In 1966, 140 translations from abroad were published,\r\nof which 72 dealt with the social sciences, 57 were literary works, 10\r\nwere pure science books, and 1 dealt with applied science.\r\n\r\nBecause books are an additional channel for propaganda, foreign works to\r\nbe translated into Albanian are carefully scrutinized. Literary works\r\nmust be of the sort that portray the ills and conflicts within\r\ncapitalist societies. Often, although a literary work might be generally\r\nideologically acceptable, parts of it are unacceptable. In such cases,\r\nthe book is carefully edited and abridged before publication in the\r\nAlbanian language is permitted.\r\n\r\nScientific and technical literature from abroad, on the other hand, is\r\nactively sought for translation. On December 21, 1967, the Council of\r\nMinisters issued a decision \"On the Assurance, Publication,\r\nOrganization, and Massive Utilization of Technical-Scientific\r\nLiterature\" from abroad. In this decision, the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs was called upon to devise new ways for obtaining such literature\r\nthrough its embassies and through international organizations. Once the\r\nforeign works are obtained, the decision stresses that their\r\ntranslations must be of the best quality. Such translations are done\r\nunder the direction of the Ministry of Education and Culture.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous libraries of varying sizes throughout the country.\r\nOfficial sources report that in 1967 there were twenty-nine people's\r\nlibraries with a total of 1,367,000 volumes, compared with only five\r\nsuch libraries in 1938 with a total of 12,000 volumes. The largest of\r\nthese libraries is the National Library in Tirana, which in the late\r\n1960s had 450,000 volumes. The second largest library is the University\r\nLibrary, also in Tirana, which in the late 1960s had 321,680 volumes and\r\n19,640 periodicals.\r\n\r\nEach district has at least one library. The local libraries are on a\r\nmuch smaller scale than those in Tirana in terms of their total number\r\nof volumes. In addition to the district libraries, there are several\r\nhundred houses of culture, cultural circles, and clubs that subscribe to\r\nthe libraries in order to make books more accessible to the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIntellectual and Artistic Expression\r\n\r\nIn 1944, when the Communist regime came to power, there was little or no\r\nheritage in the various areas of cultural activity--literature, music,\r\ndrama, or painting and sculpture--upon which the Communist leaders could\r\nbuild. Since the end of World War II, however, a consistent effort has\r\nbeen made to foster the growth of an Albanian cultural tradition and to\r\ngenerally raise the cultural level of the people. Writers and artists\r\nare supported by the state, and cultural institutions have been\r\nestablished throughout the country to ensure maximum cultural exposure\r\nof the masses. In 1967 there were 35 houses of culture in cities, 395 in\r\nvillages, and 1,266 cultural circles throughout the country. In\r\naddition, there were 24 national museums and 25 local museums.\r\n\r\nThe various cultural institutions sponsor plays, concerts, and literary\r\nreadings; subscribe to libraries; arrange trips to museums; and direct\r\nother such activities. Often courses in the arts, such as music lessons,\r\nare conducted. The activities of the houses of culture and the cultural\r\ncircles are not restricted to cultural recreation, however. They also\r\nhave been assigned the general task of educating the masses.\r\n\r\nSpecial cadres of culture are trained to direct the cultural\r\ninstitutions. Their preparation extends beyond the realm of culture to\r\nMarxism-Leninism, however, and they are generally trained to enable them\r\nto become involved in all aspects of the life of the community. The\r\nvarious cultural institutions, while genuinely serving to expose the\r\nmasses to culture, are also important instruments of political and\r\nsocial indoctrination.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the principles of socialist realism require that literary\r\nand artistic works actively promote the goals of the Party and reflect\r\nCommunist ideology. Besides generally being \"a weapon for the education\r\nof the new man with the ideals of socialism and the principles of\r\nCommunist morality,\" literature, drama, music, and art must inspire\r\nnationalism and allegiance to the Party and stimulate the people to work\r\ntoward fulfillment of Party plans, whether they are in the economic or\r\nthe social spheres. The criterion used to evaluate cultural works is the\r\ndegree to which they further the goals of the Party and socialist\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the initiation of the Cultural Revolution, Enver\r\nHoxha expounded upon the vital role of the various aspects of culture in\r\na speech to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Workers' Party in\r\nNovember 1966. The task set by the Party is that \"literature and art\r\nshould become a powerful weapon in the hands of the Party for the\r\neducation of the working people in the spirit of socialism and\r\ncommunism; that literature and art should stand at the vanguard of the\r\nstruggle for the education of a new generation ideologically and morally\r\npure; that all artistic creation should be of a high ideological level\r\nand be permeated by both the Party's militant revolutionary spirit and a\r\nhealthy national spirit.\"\r\n\r\nSuch demands have been made of authors, artists, and musicians since the\r\ninception of the Albanian People's Republic. Since 1966, however, when\r\nthe Cultural Revolution was initiated, the importance of culture has\r\nreceived greater emphasis and the demands for ideological purity of all\r\ncreative works have increased. The Cultural Revolution was still in\r\nmotion as of the early months of 1970.\r\n\r\nThe dominant themes of Albanian culture under communism have concerned\r\nthe history of Albania, the struggle of the Communist-led partisans\r\nduring the War of National Liberation, and the transformation of the\r\nbackward, superstitious society into one that is modern and governed by\r\nprogressive, socialist principles. In the mid-1960s, however, the Party\r\ncalled upon writers and artists to go beyond these themes and to portray\r\nthe contemporary struggles for the creation of socialism. Party guidance\r\nstipulates that it is not enough to describe the past struggles and\r\nachievements. The ongoing hardships faced by the peasants and workers\r\nmust be reflected in artistic works. The heroes are to be workers,\r\npeasants, and engineers, as well as the partisans.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of the Cultural Revolution, artists and writers\r\nhave been going to the mountain villages, industrial centers, and\r\nagricultural cooperatives to live for varying lengths of time. Living\r\nand working with the people provides the writers and artists with\r\ninsights into the life and problems that the various types of people\r\nmust face. These experiences are designed to help them create themes\r\nthat reflect the contemporary developments more accurately and to make\r\ncultural works more relevant to the masses.\r\n\r\nGiven the influential role of culture in society, it was imperative that\r\nthe Party establish strict control over all creative activities.\r\nAuthors, dramatists, musicians, and artists must belong to the Union of\r\nArtists and Writers. This organization is nominally independent of the\r\nParty, but in reality it is firmly under Party control. Another source\r\nof control is the Ministry of Education and Culture, which has close\r\nties with the Directorate of Education and Culture under the Politburo\r\nof the Party. Furthermore, all individuals involved in cultural pursuits\r\nare dependent upon the state for their income as well as for the\r\nfinancing of their various projects.\r\n\r\nThe twofold task of the Party leaders in the cultural field--that of\r\nfostering cultural development while maintaining control over the\r\ncontent of the cultural works--was difficult in many respects and easy\r\nin others. The lack of a firmly established tradition in many cultural\r\nfields, as well as the lack of a substantial cultural community,\r\nfacilitated the establishment of Party control. Writers and artists who\r\nreceived their training under the Party's tutelage know only the\r\nsocialist realist approach. On the other hand, the lack of experience\r\nand personnel in many fields, such as drama, meant that the developments\r\nin these areas would be slow. Furthermore, the leaders were dependent\r\nfirst upon the Yugoslavs and, after 1948, on the Soviets to train people\r\nin the areas that were totally lacking in Albania's cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of artistic and intellectual achievements, compared with\r\nthose of other nations throughout the world, was basically the result of\r\nAlbania's long history of foreign domination and of the rugged\r\ntopography of the country, which facilitated the isolation of many\r\ncommunities for centuries. During the several centuries of Turkish rule,\r\nthe Albanians were forbidden to develop a written language. Furthermore,\r\nthere were no schools that conducted classes in the Albanian language;\r\nthere were only Turkish schools for the Muslim population and Greek\r\nschools for the Orthodox population. To compound these difficulties,\r\nthere are two major dialects of Albanian--Geg, spoken in the north, and\r\nTosk, in the south. Albania did not have a uniform alphabet until\r\nNovember 1908, when a congress of intellectuals agreed upon the use of\r\nthe Latin alphabet. It was not until the Communist regime came to power\r\nthat it was decided that Tosk would be the official literary dialect\r\n(see ch. 2, Historical Setting; ch. 3, Physical Environment; ch. 4, The\r\nPeople).\r\n\r\nAn additional obstacle to the development of a substantial intellectual\r\nand artistic community and tradition was the fact that until 1957 there\r\nwere no universities in the country. The State University of Tirana,\r\nAlbania's only university, was not established until that year. Before\r\nWorld War II Albanian students went abroad, primarily to Western Europe,\r\nin the pursuit of higher education. After World War II students were\r\nusually sent to the Soviet Union or other Eastern European countries to\r\nattend universities and other institutions of higher learning (see ch.\r\n5, Social System).\r\n\r\nIn 1970 there was still evidence that the Communist leaders were not\r\nentirely satisfied with the cultural works produced in the past\r\ntwenty-six years. There were also indications that many creative works\r\nwere not ideologically pure. Few cultural works produced during the\r\nCommunist period are known in the West owing to Albania's virtual\r\nisolation. Evaluation of literature, drama, music, and art can only be\r\nmade on the basis of criticism and praise of such works that appear in\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature\r\n\r\nAlbania has a strong tradition of folklore, which had been transmitted\r\norally for several centuries. At the end of the nineteenth century and\r\nin the early twentieth century, much of this lore was written down in\r\nanthologies and collections. The folklore consists of heroic songs,\r\nlyrics, tales, and proverbs. The predominant themes are the heroic feats\r\nof the mountain tribes in the north against the Slavs across the border,\r\nthe important role of the Albanians in the Ottoman Empire, and the\r\nglorious resistance led by the country's national hero, Gjergi\r\nSkanderbeg, against the Turks in the fifteenth century. There are also a\r\nlarge number of love songs and wedding songs found in the folk\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nAn oral tradition was also developed by the Albanians who had left their\r\nhomeland in the second half of the fifteenth century, during and\r\nimmediately after the wars against the Turks led by Skanderbeg. The\r\nsongs and poetry of the Italo-Albanians reflect fifteenth-century\r\nAlbanian society. The most important theme is the heroic resistance\r\nagainst the Turks. There are also lyric songs that portray love for\r\none's mother and wife. Lyric songs were also developed in the Albanian\r\nsettlements in Greece, although less is known about them. There were no\r\nheroic songs from this area until the nineteenth century when the\r\nAlbanian communities fought to preserve their independence and Orthodox\r\nChristianity against Muslim incursions.\r\n\r\nThe first written literature found in Albania dates back to the\r\nfifteenth century. Until the nineteenth century such literature was of a\r\nreligious nature. Nationalist literature was not developed until the\r\nnineteenth century and, because of the restrictions imposed by the\r\nTurks, such literature first appeared in the Albanian settlements\r\nabroad. The most outstanding writer of the nineteenth century was Naim\r\nFrasheri, who played an important role in the awakening of Albanian\r\nnationalism.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the early twentieth century also was produced outside\r\nAlbania. The writers were instrumental in the development of the\r\nmovement for Albanian independence, and their works were increasingly\r\nnationalistic. After independence was achieved in 1912, Albanian writers\r\nwere able to return to their country to work. Several volumes of lyric\r\npoetry were produced by such people as P. Vincenc Prennushi, Dom Ndre\r\nMjeda, and Asdreni. Bishop Fan S. Noli lived in the United States most\r\nof his life but made important contributions to Albanian literature. In\r\n1907 he published a three-act play entitled _Israelites and\r\nPhilistines_, and he later translated several world renowned literary\r\nworks into Albanian, including Shakespeare's _Macbeth_, _Hamlet_, and\r\n_Othello_; Ibsen's _Inger of Ostrat_; and Cervantes' _Don Quixote_.\r\n\r\nIn the 1920s and 1930s Albanian literary and philosophic periodicals\r\nappeared both at home and abroad. The journal _Djaleria_ (Youth) was\r\npublished in Vienna by Albanian students. It was in this journal that\r\nthe poetry of Lasgush Poradeci first appeared, and his works made a\r\ntremendous impact on Albanian youth. Two periodicals appeared in the\r\n1930s, _Illyria_ and _Perpjekia Shqiptare_ (The Albanian Effort), which\r\nreflected the intellectual fervor of the decade. New ideas were spread\r\nthroughout the country by students who returned from universities in\r\nItaly, France, and Austria. The depression and Italian penetration of\r\nAlbania also incited intellectual ferment.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II the Balli Kombetar (National Front), a democratic\r\nresistance movement, was founded by Midhat Frasheri, a prominent\r\nnationalist writer. The first resistance literature to be openly\r\npublished, however, was found in the periodical _Hylli i Drites_ (The\r\nStar of Light), published by the Franciscan Brothers in Shkoder. The\r\nFascist occupation forced the publication of this review to cease in\r\n1941. Beginning in 1942, clandestine resistance literature began to\r\nincrease in volume. It was published by the Balli Kombetar and by the\r\nNational Liberation Movement (Communist front organization).\r\n\r\nAfter World War II literature came under the control of the Communist\r\nregime and, consequently, all literary works were made to conform to the\r\nprinciples of socialist realism. The predominant theme of literary works\r\nin the early postwar period was the War of National Liberation. A few\r\nworks also dealt with the reconstruction after the years of ravaging\r\nwar. Among the writers of the early Communist period were the poets\r\nMark Ndoja, Llazar Siliqi, Gjergi Kominino, Ziza Cikuli, and Vehbi\r\nSkenderi. Zihni Sako, Fatmir Gjata, and Jakov Xoxe wrote short stories.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1944-48 period translations of Serbo-Croatian works were\r\npublished, and several books were translated from Russian. At the end of\r\n1949 the Soviet Union and Stalin, in particular, became additional\r\nthemes for Albanian literature; after 1960 the Chinese were substituted\r\nfor Soviet heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheater and Cinema\r\n\r\nThere were no professional theaters before 1945. Sokrat Mijo, an\r\nAlbanian who had studied drama in Paris, tried to set up a professional\r\ntheater in the 1930s but was unable to generate interest in the project.\r\nOccasionally, amateur groups performed plays, but that was the extent of\r\ntheatrical experience before the Communist era. The people objected to\r\nthe presence of women on the stage, and in most amateur performances men\r\nplayed the feminine parts. The plays performed by the amateur groups\r\nwere primarily of a romantically patriotic nature.\r\n\r\nThe absence of repertory theaters did not inhibit the emergence of\r\nAlbanian playwrights and, although their works were rarely performed,\r\nthey did have readers. The first playwright to appear on Albanian\r\nterritory was Pasko Vasa Pasha, who wrote _The Jew's Son_. Pasha was\r\nable to write in his native land because he lived in the city of\r\nShkoder, which was the only area to enjoy some immunity from the rigid\r\nrestrictions imposed by the Turks against cultural activity in Albania.\r\nHis play was produced in 1879 by an amateur group at Xaverian College.\r\n\r\nSeveral playwrights emerged in the Albanian settlements abroad, and a\r\nfew within Albania, but their works had to be published abroad before\r\n1912. Two of the most prominent of these writers were Sami Frasheri, who\r\nwrote _Besa_ (The Pledge), and Kristo Floqi, who wrote _Religion and\r\nNationality_. Ernest Koliqi made significant contributions to Albanian\r\ndramatic literature after independence was won.\r\n\r\nThe potential of the theater as an instrument of political and social\r\nindoctrination was recognized by the Communist leaders, and in 1945 they\r\ninvited the president of the Society of Yugoslav Actors to come to\r\nAlbania to establish a professional theatrical group. With the aid of\r\nSokrat Mijo, who had become the director of the school of drama in\r\nTirana, such a group was formed. Their first performance, in September\r\n1945, was a presentation of _The Lover_, which was adapted from a play\r\nwritten by Yugoslav playwrights.\r\n\r\nIn 1949 a professional theater was created in Shkoder, and in 1950\r\nanother theater was founded in Korce. Since then numerous professional\r\nand amateur groups have sprung up throughout the country. They perform\r\nserious drama, comedies, variety shows, and puppet shows, the themes of\r\nwhich must conform to the principles of socialist realism. In 1964 it\r\nwas reported that there were twenty-two professional drama and variety\r\ntheaters.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the lack of experience in the theatrical field\r\ncreated problems for the political leaders' efforts to foster its\r\ndevelopment. Periodically, articles appear in the press that criticize\r\nvarious shortcomings in the production of drama and variety shows. The\r\ntargets of criticism range from content to the skills of the performers\r\nto the management of the stage and theater.\r\n\r\nCinematography is another field that was not developed until after World\r\nWar II. There had been a joint Italian-Albanian company established in\r\nTirana during the Italian occupation that produced mostly documentary\r\nfilms, but the film industry did not actually begin to develop until\r\n1949 and 1950. The Soviet Union was instrumental in the foundation of\r\nthis industry, and it initially provided the Albanians with the\r\nnecessary equipment. Since that time great efforts have been made to\r\nincrease the number of films produced and to expand facilities for\r\nshowing them to the public.\r\n\r\nA few full-length, artistic films are produced each year, and a greater\r\nnumber of short films and documentaries are completed annually. Often\r\nliterary works are made into art films. Figures are not available as to\r\nthe exact number of each type of film produced. Films are also imported,\r\nunder the direction of the Ministry of Education and Culture, mostly\r\nfrom Communist countries, although a few Western films are shown after\r\ncareful editing. The foreign films are usually dubbed into Albanian.\r\nFew, if any, Albanian productions have been seen in the West.\r\n\r\nThe film industry has been nationalized since its inception. The\r\nMinistry of Education and Culture controls the exhibition and\r\ndistribution of motion pictures. In 1967 there were 50,000 performances,\r\nwhich were attended by about 8.25 million people.\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic\r\n\r\nAlbania has a rich tradition in folk music. Heroic and lyric songs,\r\nusually accompanied by folk instruments, were passed down from\r\ngeneration to generation over the centuries. In the mountains of the\r\nnorth the _lahute_ (lute), which is a stringed instrument, is popular.\r\nOther Albanian folk instruments are the _roja_, which is a bagpipe, and\r\nthe _tupan_, which is similar to a tambourine. Orchestras, called\r\n_saze_, are found in many towns in the southern part of Albania. These\r\nare usually composed of about five instruments and often provide music\r\nfor folk dances at weddings and on other special occasions.\r\n\r\nWestern music was first spread throughout the country in the 1920s by an\r\nAlbanian brass band that had received training in the United States.\r\nAfter touring the larger towns, it established itself in Korce, giving\r\nregular popular and classical concerts. The Royal Band was later\r\nestablished in Tirana, whose repertoire consisted of Western music but,\r\ngenerally, indigenous music predominated and Western music made little\r\nimpact.\r\n\r\nWestern-trained Albanian singers appeared in the mid-1930s. Tefta\r\nTashko, Gjorgjija Filce, and Maria Paluca were well-known sopranos who\r\nsang both operatic music and folk tunes. Kristaq Antoniu began his\r\ncareer as a tenor before World War II and continued it under the\r\nCommunist regime. Filce and Paluca also remained musical stars after\r\nWorld War II.\r\n\r\nKristro Kono was the only composer of significance in pre-World War II\r\nAlbania. He remains a highly rated composer under the Communist regime.\r\nIn the 1950s he wrote several songs, some of which were dedicated to\r\nEnver Hoxha and Stalin. Some of his orchestral pieces are \"Fantazi\r\nShqiptare\" (Albanian Fantasies) and \"Agimi\" (The Dawn). Konstantine\r\nTrako is another popular composer of the Communist period.\r\n\r\nThe predominant musical creations are songs with lyrics because they are\r\neffective means of inspiring patriotism and pro-Communist sentiments.\r\nAll activity in the musical field is controlled and supported by the\r\nParty, primarily through the Union of Artists and Writers and the\r\nMinistry of Education and Culture. There are state-supported music\r\nacademies and institutions for training in this field. Besides the many\r\nlocal musical groups, there are the state-supported Opera and Ballet\r\nTheater of Tirana and the Song and Dance Ensemble of Tirana (see ch. 5,\r\nSocial System).\r\n\r\n\r\nFine Arts\r\n\r\nThe first art school was established in Tirana in the 1930s. The\r\ncurriculum of this school did not go beyond the fundamentals of art and,\r\nconsequently, talented students had to go abroad. Vangjush Mijo and\r\nAndroniqi Zengo were the first to introduce modern art to Albania in the\r\nform of impressionism. Mijo had studied in Italy and Zengo in Greece.\r\nOdhise Paskal was the only notable sculptor of prewar Albania. He had\r\nreceived his training in Florence. His creations include the Skanderbeg\r\nmonument in Tirana and the National Warrior monument in Korce. Paskal\r\nand Zengo continued to work under the Communist regime.\r\n\r\nCourses in the fine arts have increased since the end of World War II.\r\nArtists and sculptors are supported by the state, and the main themes of\r\ntheir creations are workers, peasants, partisan heroes, youth working on\r\nagricultural and industrial projects, soldiers, and liberated women in\r\ntheir various activities. Examples of artistic creations praised in the\r\nAlbanian press are: \"High Revolutionary Spirit\" by M. Dhrami, \"The Adult\r\nof the Republic\" by K. Rama, and \"The Partisans of the Revenge\r\nBattalion\" by S. Shijaku. Besides Paskal, J. Paco and A. Mana have been\r\ncited as distinguished sculptors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nECONOMIC SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn mid-1970 the economy, which is wholly controlled by the Albanian\r\nWorkers' Party, approached the conclusion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan,\r\nduring which it made a further advance along the road of industrialization,\r\nin line with the totalitarian leadership's goal of transforming the\r\neconomy from the stage referred to as agricultural-industrial to a more\r\nadvanced industrial-agricultural level. The Fourth Five-Year Plan\r\n(1966-70) actually called for a more rapid growth of agriculture than\r\nthat of industry and for an increase in the share of agriculture in the\r\nnational product by 1970. This departure from proclaimed policy was\r\ndictated by the failure of agriculture to meet the goals of the Third\r\nFive-Year Plan (1961-65) and by an overriding need to increase farm\r\nproduction in order to reduce to the maximum extent possible the\r\nperennial food deficit.\r\n\r\nDespite government efforts, the five-year plan goals for agriculture are\r\nnot being achieved, even though substantial advances in production have\r\nbeen made. The agricultural output target set by the annual plan for\r\n1970 is significantly below the five-year plan figure for that year. By\r\ncontrast, the five-year plan goal for industrial output was reported to\r\nhave been surpassed in 1969 and to have been raised in the annual plan\r\nfor 1970 substantially above the original level.\r\n\r\nThe basic reasons for the failure to attain the planned farm output\r\ntargets, apart from their magnitude, lie in the difficulty of inducing\r\npeasants to relinquish age-old traditions in favor of modern scientific\r\nfarming methods and of motivating them to work industriously in a\r\ncollective farm system that they strongly reject. Although problems of\r\nadaptation and motivation are also present in industry, the much smaller\r\nsize of the industrial labor force and the presence of foreign\r\ntechnicians in key areas mitigate the difficulties and make possible a\r\nsomewhat more rapid rate of growth.\r\n\r\nReliable information on Albania is scarce. Few foreigners capable of\r\nobserving and evaluating conditions objectively have been able to visit\r\nthe country in the past twenty-five years. Articles from official\r\njournals or newspapers available in English translation, which\r\nconstitute the major source of data, provide only a partial coverage and\r\nmust be used with caution because of a lack of means for verification.\r\nPublished statistics, available in detail to 1964 and nonexistent after\r\n1967, leave many important gaps. Because of apparent shortcomings in the\r\nunderlying statistical methods, only data in physical terms can be\r\naccepted with some degree of assurance as to their accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe economy is administered through a small number of specialized\r\nministries, and most information about it comes from Communist sources.\r\nControl over labor is maintained through trade unions, which constitute\r\na political arm of the Party (see ch. 6, Government Structure and\r\nPolitical System). Economic activity is governed by a series of\r\nfive-year and annual plans prepared by the State Planning Commission in\r\naccordance with Party directives.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is organized into state and collective farms, which are\r\ndependent upon machine-tractor stations for the performance of\r\nmechanized farm operations. Industry is poorly balanced with regard to\r\nthe country's domestic needs and is heavily oriented toward exports.\r\nForeign trade primarily serves the purpose of obtaining needed resources\r\nfor the development of production. Limited domestic resources are only\r\npartially developed, and the economy depends heavily on foreign economic\r\nand technical assistance. The country's political orientation has\r\nrestricted the sources of such aid to other Communist states, and its\r\nalignment with Communist China in the Sino-Soviet dispute brought about\r\nthe loss of Soviet support with severe repercussions to the economy.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-five years of forced draft economic development, the\r\ncountry in 1967 was described by a correspondent of a European journal\r\nas a mixture of the fourteenth and twentieth centuries, where oxen and\r\nbuffaloes were to be seen side by side with modern foreign-made\r\ntractors, and where a policeman directed traffic in the main square of\r\nthe capital city like a conductor waving his baton at a nonexistent\r\norchestra.\r\n\r\nAfter a visit in the fall of 1969, a specialist on Balkan affairs\r\nreported that austerity and regimentation were still the rule despite a\r\nsubstantial measure of economic progress achieved during the period of\r\nindependence. He also expressed the view that Albania undoubtedly\r\nremained the poorest country in Europe but that the economic and social\r\nadvances attained could be envied by the countries of the Near East.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR\r\n\r\nAlthough economic development is still in its infancy, growing concern\r\nhas been officially expressed about the adequacy of the labor force to\r\nmeet the needs of industrialization and of expanding social services\r\nwithout adversely affecting agricultural production. The main cause of\r\nthe incipient labor shortage is low productivity owing to a lack of\r\nindustrial experience, a low level of mechanization, and the survival of\r\nbackward traditional methods in agriculture. Officially, low\r\nproductivity has been ascribed to poor labor discipline and inefficient\r\nmanagement arising from an inadequately developed sense of political and\r\nsocial responsibility. It has also been blamed on a failure of manpower\r\nplanning and on the relaxation of central controls over enterprise\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1969 the Central Committee of the Party adopted a decision\r\non means for correcting this situation. An important element of the\r\nprogram is the education and political indoctrination of the workers.\r\nThis task is a major function of the trade unions, which are primarily a\r\npolitical arm of the Party for the control of labor, without any\r\nsignificant responsibilities in the field of labor relations (see ch. 6,\r\nGovernment Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nIn 1967, the last year for which official employment data are available,\r\nthe working-age population comprised 932,000 persons, 739,200 of whom\r\nwere actually employed. The number of employed did not include roughly\r\n6,000 peasants working on the private holdings still remaining in that\r\nyear. Including these peasants, the participation rate in the labor\r\nforce was 80 percent.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the labor force was employed in agriculture, the remainder\r\nin a variety of nonagricultural pursuits, chief among which were\r\nindustry, construction, trade, and education. Apart from the peasants\r\nworking their own land, farm labor included about 427,000 persons on\r\ncollective farms and 64,000 on state farms. The industrial labor force\r\nof 105,300 accounted for 14.1 percent of total employment, and 40,000\r\nconstruction workers, for 5.4 percent. The nearly 32,000 workers in\r\ntrade and 25,000 workers in education constituted, respectively, 4.2 and\r\n3.4 percent of the employed manpower.\r\n\r\nThe officially reported labor force, which comprises nonagricultural\r\nlabor and state farm workers only, increased by 53 percent between 1960\r\nand 1967, from 203,800 to 312,400 persons. The increase represents an\r\nannual growth rate of 6.3 percent. At this rate, the labor force in 1970\r\nwould be about 375,000 persons. It has been informally reported as\r\n400,000. Collective farm employment rose, in round numbers, from 282,000\r\nin 1960 to 336,000 in 1966 and to 427,000 in 1967. The unusually large\r\nincrease in 1967 resulted from an intensive drive to collectivize the\r\nremaining privately owned farms and also from a government policy of\r\nreversing the population flow from the farms to the cities. With the\r\nmajor reservoir of individual farms exhausted, the number of collective\r\nfarm workers could increase up to 1970 by roughly 45,000 to 50,000\r\nthrough natural population growth. Absence of data on rural-urban\r\npopulation shifts precludes any firm estimate of the size of the\r\ncollective farm labor force in 1970.\r\n\r\nAccording to preliminary estimates by the planning authorities, an\r\nincrease of between 120,000 and 130,000 workers outside the collective\r\nfarm sector would be needed to implement the industrial and social\r\nprograms of the five-year plan for the 1971-75 period if productivity\r\nremained at the level of the 1965-69 period. The natural growth of the\r\nable-bodied urban population during this period was estimated not to\r\nexceed 29,000 persons. An outflow of up to 100,000 persons from the\r\nrural areas would therefore be necessary to meet the estimated manpower\r\nneeds. Such a contingency could not be countenanced because of the\r\nsevere damage it would inflict on the rural economy. Attainment of a\r\nhigher rate of participation in the labor force and of a substantial\r\nincrease in labor productivity has therefore been considered by the\r\nParty leadership of utmost urgency to ensure sustained economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe latest evidence of the leadership's profound concern about these\r\nbasic labor problems was provided by the Party's Central Committee\r\nplenum held at the end of December 1969, devoted to a discussion of\r\nmeans for raising productivity and tightening labor discipline. In its\r\nreport delivered to the plenum, the Political Bureau (Politburo) of the\r\nCentral Committee expressed strong dissatisfaction with what it\r\nconsidered an unsatisfactory rate of participation in employment by the\r\ncollective farm population. It placed the blame for this situation on\r\nlocal government organs, which had become reconciled to the backward\r\ntraditional concepts that keep homemakers and some young girls in the\r\nhome and that require a member of the family to look after the family's\r\nprivately owned livestock and thus be unable to seek outside work.\r\n\r\nThe Party's report also called attention to the prevalence of a petty\r\nbourgeois attitude among many families of workers, employees, and\r\nservicemen that keeps their members from accepting employment. To\r\nfacilitate the employment of women, the Party urged more widespread\r\nprovision of amenities, such as nurseries and dining halls, that would\r\nfree them from household duties.\r\n\r\nMeaningful information on labor productivity is not available because\r\nstatistics on this subject have not been published and because essential\r\ndetails of the methods used in calculating the percentage rates of\r\nincrease in productivity that appear from time to time in official\r\npublic statements are not sufficiently known. Based on physical output\r\nand labor data, Western observers believe that the published data\r\noverstate the actual advance achieved.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Politburo report, productivity in industry rose 2.2\r\ntimes between 1950 and 1968, and this growth accounted for 60 percent of\r\nthe increase in industrial production during that period. In agriculture\r\n67 percent of the increase in output during those years was attributed\r\nto the growth of productivity. These figures indicate a slightly faster\r\nadvance in agricultural productivity, but in absolute terms productivity\r\nin agriculture has been very much lower than in industry.\r\n\r\nDuring the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-65) labor productivity reportedly\r\nrose by an annual average of 2.1 percent in industry, 4.6 percent in\r\nconstruction, and 2.7 percent in automotive transport. Data for the\r\nyears after 1965 had not been published by mid-1970 except for official\r\nstatements that the planned levels had not been reached.\r\n\r\nThe lag of productivity has been attributed by the Central Committee to\r\na pronounced shortage of skilled manpower and to various manifestations\r\nof poor labor discipline and faulty management. Chief among the cited\r\nshortcomings in the field of labor are excessive absenteeism, resulting\r\nin part from inadequate medical and public dining facilities; loafing on\r\nthe job; and a generally negligent attitude toward work that entails a\r\nloss of time and a low quality of the product. On the management side,\r\nthe main shortcomings include poor organization of production,\r\nacceptance of unjustifiably low work output norms, and labor hoarding.\r\n\r\nBoth workers and managers have been accused of a reluctance to adopt\r\nprogressive production techniques and of frequently putting their own\r\npersonal interest or that of their enterprise ahead of the public good.\r\nA disorganization of the material supply arising from frequent\r\nnoncompletion of production assignments and poor coordination among\r\nplants and industry branches has also been cited as an important factor\r\nresponsible for substantial losses of worktime and, consequently, of\r\nreduced productivity.\r\n\r\nEnterprise managers have been repeatedly accused of irresponsibility in\r\nthe use of resources, which has entailed a wasteful use of machinery and\r\nlabor. Inadequate planning of production schedules and poor maintenance\r\nare said to cause an inordinate loss of machine time. Managers have also\r\nbeen charged with abusing the legal provision that allows them to employ\r\nup to 2 percent more workers (presumably to meet emergencies or to\r\nincrease output) than are called for by the enterprise plan. Such abuse\r\nhas been facilitated by the elimination sometime in the middle or late\r\n1960s of the control by banks over enterprise funds allotted for the\r\npayment of wages.\r\n\r\nA change in the method of productivity planning, which involved a\r\nredefinition of productivity as a calculated index, is reported to have\r\nbeen widely misinterpreted as downgrading the importance of\r\nproductivity. This misconception has been reinforced by the circumstance\r\nthat productivity levels are planned for only about 70 percent of the\r\nnonagricultural workers.\r\n\r\nIn many enterprises labor norms--that is, the minimum amount of work a\r\nworker in any given job is required to perform per unit of time--are\r\nofficially said to be inordinately low. There are reported to be many\r\nenterprises in which the established norms are substantially\r\noverfulfilled despite the fact that the effective workday does not\r\nexceed 6 to 7 hours. These norms, it is said, require only about 5-½\r\nto 6 hours of work per day and are thus responsible for a 25- to\r\n35-percent loss of output or, conversely, of labor wastage. Yet, despite\r\nthe low norms, about 14 percent of the workers fail to complete their\r\nassigned tasks. Although a Politburo decision in April 1967 called the\r\nattention of Party, government, and economic organs to the importance of\r\ncorrect labor norms, this matter has been generally neglected and little\r\nhas been accomplished. Many of the existing norms have become obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe Politburo's program that was adopted toward the end of 1969 for\r\nraising productivity is based essentially on an appeal to the social\r\nconsciousness of all participants in the economic process and calls for\r\nimproved performance in all aspects and at all levels of production\r\nthrough greater self-discipline and more stringent controls. A practical\r\ndifficulty faced by the leadership in the execution of its program is\r\nthe lack of a precise concept of productivity and of an effective\r\nmethodology for establishing sound productivity targets or for measuring\r\nactual performance. The problem is particularly pronounced in\r\nagriculture. Experimentation with new concepts and methods has been\r\nunderway for some time under the joint guidance of the State Planning\r\nCommission, the Ministry of Industry and Mining, and the Ministry of\r\nConstruction. Results of the experimentation are to serve as a basis for\r\nfurther decisions by the Council of Ministers in 1970.\r\n\r\nA distinctive feature of the country's labor scene is the practice of\r\nmobilizing large numbers of the population for so-called voluntary work\r\non various types of construction and agricultural projects, including\r\nthe building of railroads, housing, and irrigation canals; land\r\nimprovement; harvesting; and the planting of trees. Thousands and, at\r\ntimes, tens of thousands of individuals from all walks of life,\r\nincluding members of the armed forces, are assembled by the government\r\nto carry out specific jobs with simple tools or with their bare hands.\r\n\r\nParty dogma holds that these projects, which use vast numbers of people,\r\nreflect the Party's strength, the might of the masses, and the great\r\nreserves to be found in their midst. The projects are considered to be\r\nnot only of great economic and social importance but also of great\r\nideological, political, and educational significance because, among\r\nother things, they reflect the determination and readiness of the broad\r\nworking masses to implement the Party's line. Official complaints about\r\nflagging enthusiasm for housing construction in 1968 suggest a less\r\nfavorable public acceptance of this practice than that proclaimed by the\r\nParty dogma.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nAgriculture is organized on the Stalinist Soviet model: all activity is\r\ncentrally planned, and farm operations are carried out by state and\r\ncollective farms. Government policy has accorded a high priority to the\r\nexpansion and modernization of agricultural production as a means of\r\nattaining self-sufficiency in foods. In an effort to obviate the\r\nhistorical dependence on grain imports, the government has placed\r\nspecial emphasis on increasing the output of bread grains, which furnish\r\nthe bulk of the people's diet, and on a rapid rise in the production of\r\npotatoes as a substitute for bread.\r\n\r\nGreat importance is attached to the expansion of industrial crops, such\r\nas cotton, tobacco, sugar beets, and sunflowers, in order to provide raw\r\nmaterials for the growing domestic industries, in addition to\r\nmaintaining traditional exports. Expansion of grape vineyards, olive\r\ngroves, and other fruit and vegetable growing has also been promoted to\r\ndevelop larger exportable surpluses. According to official data, farm\r\noutput increased half again as fast as the population between 1950 and\r\n1967, but it is still inadequate to supply the country's minimum needs\r\nfor bread and livestock products.\r\n\r\nThe government's ambitious farm modernization program has been imposed\r\non tradition-bound peasants averse to rapid change. A large part of the\r\nland improvement and irrigation work has been accomplished through mass\r\nmobilization of peasants and of the urban population for so-called\r\nvoluntary work on the model of the Chinese coolie system. Socialization\r\nof the land has had a deleterious effect on work incentives, with a\r\nconsequent lag in the planned growth of agricultural production.\r\nMeasures adopted by the government to ensure better work performance on\r\nthe collective farms did not prove sufficiently effective, and a\r\nscaling down of the five-year plan target for agricultural production\r\ncould therefore not be avoided.\r\n\r\nTo provide the additional acreage needed for crop expansion, large-scale\r\nprograms of land reclamation and melioration have been executed. At the\r\nsame time, heavy stress has been laid on the improvement of farm\r\ntechniques and on mechanization as means for increasing yields and\r\nproduction. A planned expansion of livestock herds and of the output of\r\nlivestock products has been hampered by inadequate incentives for\r\npeasants and by a shortage of fodder. The agricultural potential is\r\nlimited by the predominance of rugged mountain terrain and by frequent\r\nspring droughts that cause extensive damage to crops. To minimize the\r\nadverse effects of the droughts, an extensive irrigation system is being\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nIn 1967 the area of land in agricultural use, excluding forests, roads,\r\nand homesites, amounted to about 3.0 million acres, or 43 percent of the\r\ncountry's total area. More than half of the agricultural land was in\r\nunimproved natural pastures, with an additional small acreage in natural\r\nmeadows. Cultivated land bearing field and tree crops totaled about 1.4\r\nmillion acres, of which about 1.1 million acres were arable land,\r\nequivalent to about two-thirds of an acre per capita. Almost half of the\r\ncultivated land was located in hilly and mountainous zones, which are\r\nless productive than the coastal plains. The agricultural acreage was\r\nexpanded by 3 percent between 1950 and 1967, but a significant further\r\nexpansion is precluded by the country's rugged terrain.\r\n\r\nA high priority has been placed by the leadership on expanding the\r\ncultivated area and raising its productivity through land reclamation,\r\nsoil improvement, and irrigation. Most of this work has been\r\naccomplished manually, through mobilization of large numbers of people\r\nfor massive projects and with the participation by members of the armed\r\nforces. Between 1950 and 1969 the area of cultivated land rose by almost\r\none-half to a total of more than 1.4 million acres, at least 185,000\r\nacres of which have been reclaimed since 1965. The bulk of the increase\r\nin cultivated land was achieved at the expense of natural pastures and\r\nmeadows, the area of which has declined by about 265,000 and 50,000\r\nacres, respectively, since 1950. About 70 percent of the increase in\r\ncultivated land was added to arable acreage.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1969, however, the reclamation work had fallen behind the\r\nfive-year plan schedule. In early 1970 the government therefore took\r\nspecial measures to ensure that the entire 285,000-acre reclamation\r\nprogram would be completed as planned, bringing the total cultivated\r\nacreage to about 1.5 million acres. Very substantial progress in this\r\nendeavor was reported to have been achieved by the end of March, largely\r\nthrough the mobilization for this task of about 200,000 persons from\r\nurban and rural areas.\r\n\r\nExpansion of the irrigation network has proceeded somewhat more slowly\r\nthan planned, with the use of the same mass construction methods. As\r\nreported by the State Planning Commission to the People's Assembly in\r\nmid-February of 1970, about 140,000 acres had been brought under\r\nirrigation during the 1966-69 period, and approximately 55,000 more\r\nacres were to be added in 1970. These figures imply a total irrigated\r\narea of about 645,000 acres in 1969 and about 700,000 acres planned for\r\n1970--an increase of 2,470 acres over the original five-year plan\r\ntarget. Attainment of this goal would require a construction volume in\r\n1970 equal to the total achieved during the first two years of the\r\nfive-year period and almost half again as large as the volume in 1968.\r\nAbout half the arable acreage was irrigable in 1969.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural organization consists of two types of farms: state\r\nfarms, operated under the direction of either the central or the local\r\ngovernment, and collective farms. State farms, modeled after the\r\n_sovkhozes_ of the Soviet Union, were established beginning in 1945 on\r\nlands confiscated from large landowners and foreign concessionaires and\r\ncontain some of the most productive land in the country. Managers and\r\nworkers of state farms are salaried government employees, who may\r\nreceive special bonuses for superior production achievements.\r\n\r\nCollective farms were organized through the forcible consolidation of\r\nprivate holdings. Begun in 1946 against strong peasant resistance,\r\ncollectivization did not assume major proportions until 1955 and was\r\nvirtually completed only in 1968 with the consolidation of remote\r\nmountain villages. The basic features of the collective farm are:\r\ncomplete government control; collective use of the land and other\r\nprincipal means of production; obligatory common work by the members,\r\nbased on established minimum work norms and enforced through economic\r\nand other sanctions; and distribution of the net income to members on\r\nthe basis of the quantity and quality of work performed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to income distribution, collective farm members are residual\r\nclaimants entitled to share whatever remains after completion of\r\ncompulsory deliveries to the state; provision of prescribed investment\r\nand operating funds for the farm; payment for irrigation water,\r\nmachine-tractor station services, and other outstanding obligations; and\r\nsetting aside 2 percent of the income for social assistance to members.\r\nInformation on farm income levels is not available. Nominally, the\r\nGeneral Assembly of all the members is the highest ruling organ of the\r\ncollective farm, but actual control rests with the farm's basic Party\r\norganization (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the state and collective farms is the small\r\nprivate plot allotted to a member family for its own personal use. Since\r\n1967, when these allotments were reduced in size, the maximum legal size\r\nof the private plots, including the land under all farm buildings other\r\nthan the family dwelling, has ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 square meters\r\n(about 10,750 to 16,150 square feet, or one-quarter to three-eighths of\r\nan acre), depending upon the location and availability of irrigation.\r\nThe collective farm statute also entitles each family to maintain a few\r\ndomestic animals privately. Only one cow or one pig is authorized, but\r\nup to ten or twenty sheep and goats may be allowed. In typical cases a\r\nfamily may have a cow or pig and a few sheep or goats. More liberal\r\nallowances for poor mountain farms may include both a cow and pig as\r\nwell as the maximum number of sheep and goats.\r\n\r\nIn 1964 there were thirty-eight large, centrally controlled state farms\r\nwith an average of about 7,700 acres of farmland, including about 4,800\r\nacres of cultivated land. In 1968 the average size of the state farms,\r\nthe number of which had remained stable, was reported to be about 7,350\r\nacres, a reduction of almost 600 acres since 1964. This decline in\r\nacreage was brought about by a transfer of some state farmlands to small\r\ncollective farms as a means of increasing their viability. In 1964, 250\r\nlocally administered state farms were reported to average about 380\r\nacres and have probably continued unchanged. In 1970 state farms\r\ncultivated 20 percent of the total acreage under cultivation, and\r\ncollective farms worked 80 percent.\r\n\r\nThe number and average size of collective farms have varied widely as a\r\nresult of the continuing creation of new farms and the consolidation of\r\nexisting units. In the fall of 1969 there were 805 collective farms,\r\ncompared with 1,208 in 1967. The consolidated farms included 568 units\r\nconsisting of two to three villages each, eighty farms of six to ten\r\nvillages, and another five farms of eleven villages each. Eighty-seven\r\npercent of all collective farms had less than 2,470 acres of cultivated\r\nland each, and only nine percent had more than about 6,200 acres.\r\n\r\nHighland farms were among the smallest, many being smaller than 750\r\nacres. In 1968 the average size of all collective farms was reported to\r\nbe about 1,400 acres of cultivated land. In 1967, before\r\ncollectivization was completed, the population on collective farms\r\nconsisted of 184,400 families--an average of about 150 families per\r\nfarm--which provided about 427,000 farmworkers. As a result of further\r\nconsolidation, the number of families per farm increased significantly.\r\n\r\nAlthough available statistics are inadequate for a comprehensive review\r\nof the crop and livestock situation, five-year plan data and fragmentary\r\ninformation contained in annual official reports on economic plan\r\nfulfillment provide a reasonable approximation of the production volume\r\nof major crops but only a rough approximation of the size of the\r\nlivestock herds (see tables 10 and 11).\r\n\r\nPublished data on total agricultural production claim a virtual doubling\r\nof output between 1960 and 1969. During this period the share of field\r\ncrops in total output is reported to have increased at the expense of\r\nlivestock production--a direct result of the government's emphasis on\r\nbread grains. The share of field crops is reported to have risen from 44\r\npercent in 1960 to 59 percent in 1967, whereas the share of livestock\r\noutput declined from 43 to 29.5 percent. Fruit production contributed\r\nabout 10 percent of total output during the period, and collection of\r\nwild medicinal plants, another 1 to 4 percent.\r\n\r\nBread-grain production, including wheat, rye, and corn, increased by 80\r\npercent in the 1966-69 period, but attainment of the five-year plan\r\ntarget requires a reversal of the downward trend in annual output\r\nincreases since 1966 and a tonnage increase in 1970 from 20 to 38\r\npercent greater than those obtained in the 1967-69 period. The output of\r\npotatoes in 1969 was eleven times larger than production in 1965 yet was\r\nonly half the volume planned for 1970. The required doubling of the\r\noutput to meet the five-year plan target is roughly equivalent to the\r\nincrease in production achieved during the preceding three-year period.\r\nNevertheless, the substantial rise in the output of bread grains and\r\npotatoes achieved during the first four years of the five-year plan\r\nsignificantly, although not entirely, reduced the need for grain\r\nimports, which amounted to about 110,000 tons of wheat and 20,000 tons\r\nof corn in 1963 and 1964.\r\n\r\nProduction of rice, cotton, and tobacco was reported to have lagged\r\nthrough 1969, and the output of cotton actually declined in 1967 and\r\n1968. This and other reported information about these crops indicate\r\nthat the possibility of attaining the 1970 target is precluded for rice\r\nand is questionable for cotton. In the case of tobacco, however,\r\nreported production in 1969 was already about 1,000 tons above the\r\nfive-year plan goal, in spite of the reported lag. As early as 1967 the\r\noutput of sugar beets approached the volume planned for 1970, but\r\nsubsequent developments regarding this crop have been cloaked in\r\nofficial silence. According to officially reported data, the production\r\nof vegetables in 1969 surpassed the 1970 target by some 60,000 tons, or\r\nnearly 27 percent, yet no mention of this fact was contained in the\r\nreport on plan fulfillment for that year.\r\n\r\n_Table 10.

The dearth of\r\npublished data and repeated official pronouncements indicate\r\nunsatisfactory progress in this farm sector, particularly with regard to\r\nthe high-priority target for cattle raising. An important cause of this\r\nlag has been an acknowledged shortage of fodder. Another major reason\r\nhas been an officially induced transfer of livestock from individual\r\npeasant ownership to the collective and state farms, where it is subject\r\nto the much-criticized negligent attitude of the peasants toward state\r\nand communal property. About 60 percent of the cattle and sheep and 85\r\npercent of the hogs were kept on state and collective farms in 1969, as\r\nagainst only about 36 and 64 percent, respectively, in 1964.\r\n\r\nCollective farm managers and local government officials have blamed the\r\nfodder shortage on the diversion of pastures and meadows to the\r\nproduction of bread grains. Statistical evidence indicates that the\r\noutput of feed grains declined by about 40 percent from the mid-1950s to\r\nthe mid-1960s but that the loss of fodder from grazing lands and meadows\r\nwas compensated fourfold through increased production of forage crops.\r\nThe validity of the explanation offered by the farm and village\r\nofficials was vigorously denied in the theoretical monthly journal of\r\nthe Party's Central Committee, which attributed the fodder shortage to a\r\nfailure by collective farmers to adopt improved methods of crop\r\nproduction and to exploit all available fodder resources. In January\r\n1970 all basic Party organizations in farming areas were urged to\r\neliminate distrust and every conservative idea and harmful tendency that\r\nstood in the way of the rapid development of cattle raising and to see\r\nto it that the existing gap between the collective farms and private\r\nplots was gradually eliminated.\r\n\r\nGovernment efforts to improve livestock breeds and yields through\r\nselective breeding, artificial insemination, and better management\r\npractices have also been impeded by peasant apathy. Although yields of\r\nup to 5,500 pounds of milk per cow were obtained on some state farms in\r\n1966 and yields of about 3,300 pounds to 3,950 pounds on the more\r\nefficient lowland collective farms, the average yield of milk per cow\r\non all lowland collective farms in that year was only about 1,750 to\r\n2,200 pounds, and a large number of upland farms obtained even less.\r\n\r\nThe latest available official Albanian livestock statistics are for the\r\nyear 1964. Data for 1965 and 1966 have been published by the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The Fourth\r\nFive-Year Plan indicates the numbers planned for some of the livestock\r\ncategories in 1970 through percentage increases expected to be attained\r\nover the numbers in 1965. In the case of cattle, the largest increase by\r\nfar has been planned for draft oxen--60 percent as against only 12\r\npercent for all cattle--in an effort to reduce a draft power shortage.\r\nThis increase would inevitably be at the expense of the growth in the\r\nnumbers of cows and young stock.\r\n\r\nThe growth of productive livestock herds, excluding draft animals,\r\nlagged very substantially in relation to the increase in population, at\r\nleast through 1966. This has entailed a significant worsening of the\r\ninitially very meager supply of livestock products. According to\r\nestimates published by the FAO, total annual meat production, including\r\nall types of meat in terms of carcass weight but excluding edible\r\noffals, increased from an average of 40,000 tons in the 1952-56 period\r\nto 50,000 tons in 1967. The output in 1967 implies a per capita daily\r\nmeat availability of only about 2.5 ounces, including bones. A similar\r\nsituation prevailed with regard to dairy and poultry products because\r\nthere were only about 75 low-production cows per 1,000 population and\r\none head of inferior poultry per capita.\r\n\r\nTotal agricultural production, which was planned to increase at an\r\naverage annual rate of 11.5 percent or from 71 to 76 percent for the\r\nfive-year plan period as a whole, consistently fell short of the targets\r\nin the 1966-69 period and was not likely to attain the 17-percent\r\nincrease planned for 1970. Thus, for instance, the actual output\r\nincrease achieved in 1969 was only about 10 percent as against a planned\r\nrise of 22.1 percent and in 1968, similarly, about 1.6 as against 12\r\npercent.\r\n\r\nThis persistent lag in farm output has been extensively and publicly\r\ndiscussed by the leadership, which is intent on raising the general\r\nlevel of performance in agriculture and ensuring an adequate domestic\r\nsupply of food products. Although some blame has been attached to\r\nunfavorable weather conditions, the lag has been ascribed primarily to\r\nthe reluctance of peasants to adopt modern production techniques, poor\r\nfarm management, insufficient effort to use available resources to best\r\nadvantage, widespread indifference and negligence, and an excessive\r\npreoccupation with personal interests leading to an irresponsible\r\nattitude toward work in the collective sector. These shortcomings were\r\nsaid to exist not only among the peasantry at large but also among\r\nCommunists, who should be serving as models of responsible behavior. The\r\nbasic reason that clearly emerges from public discussion is a widespread\r\nopposition of peasants to the collectivization of farms and an\r\nassociated tendency to devote their best efforts to the cultivation of\r\ntheir own private plots.\r\n\r\nImpressive evidence on this point is provided by official production\r\nstatistics for 1964, the latest available on this subject. These data\r\nshow that output per acre on the small private plots of collective\r\nfarmers and state farm workers was four times larger than output on\r\nstate farms and six times larger than that on collective farms.\r\nConstituting only 6 percent of the cultivated land, the private plots\r\nproduced 23 percent of the total farm output. Nevertheless, the\r\nleadership has publicly credited the advance in agricultural production\r\nto the collectivization of farms.\r\n\r\nIn 1967 the government proceeded to reduce the size of the private\r\nplots, with a view to their eventual elimination, both for ideological\r\nreasons and as a means of forcing peasants to devote greater efforts to\r\nwork on collectivized land. Subsequent steps were taken to transfer to\r\ncollective ownership some of the livestock allotted to the farm families\r\nby the collective farm statute.\r\n\r\nThis action did not measurably improve agricultural performance.\r\nShortfalls in the production of several important crops, including\r\ncotton, tobacco, and rice, were admitted to have occurred both in 1968\r\nand 1969, and the situation in the livestock sector continued to be\r\nunsatisfactory. A scaling down of the original production goal for 1970\r\ncould therefore not be avoided. The farm output target set by the annual\r\nplan for 1970 was 12.5 percent below the minimum and 15 percent below\r\nthe maximum five-year plan figures for the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY\r\n\r\nA few primitive plants producing consumer goods had been built before\r\nWorld War II, but industrial development began only in 1949, when\r\nconstruction was undertaken of a 50,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power\r\nstation, a textile mill capable of producing 22 million yards of cloth\r\nper year, and a sugar mill with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons of\r\nsugar. Industrial construction continued under the first and second\r\nfive-year plans (1951-55 and 1956-60, respectively) during the 1950s,\r\nwith substantial financial and technical assistance from the Soviet\r\nUnion. This development was temporarily interrupted in the wake of the\r\npolitical break with the Soviet Union in 1961 but was soon resumed with\r\naid from Communist China (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political\r\nSystem). The interruption was said by the Albanian leadership to have\r\nretarded industrial growth by three years. Disinterested foreign\r\nobservers, however, reported that the equipment acquired with the aid of\r\nCommunist China was better suited to the needs of the country and of\r\nbetter quality than that supplied by the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nAmong the major industrial projects completed or under construction in\r\n1970 with the assistance of Communist Chinese technicians were: copper,\r\nchromium, and iron-nickel mines; an oil refinery at Fier with an annual\r\ncapacity of 500,000 tons of crude oil, a 225,000-kilowatt hydroelectric\r\npower station at Vau i Dejes on the Drin River; a 100,000-kilowatt\r\ncapacity of 500,000 tons of crude oil; a 225,000-kilowatt/thermal\r\npower-plant at Fier; a copper-ore dressing installation and a\r\ncopper-wire drawing mill; a steel-rolling mill at Elbasan; cement mills\r\nat Elbasan and Kruje; large textile combines at Tirana and Berat; and a\r\nknit goods factory at Korce.\r\n\r\nOf special benefit to agriculture was the construction of a nitrate\r\nfertilizer plant at Fier, a superphosphate plant at Lac, and a plant for\r\nthe manufacture of tractor spare parts at Tirana. A variety of smaller\r\nplants were also built for the production of such items as caustic soda,\r\nsulfuric acid, rubber products, electrical equipment and light bulbs,\r\nfootwear, and vegetable oils.\r\n\r\nAlong with the construction of technologically up-to-date plants, others\r\nwere built with outdated technology through the lack of construction\r\nexperience or knowledge of more advanced methods. At the same time,\r\nobsolete plants and workshops remained in use. In 1969 these\r\ntechnologically backward plants produced less than half the total output\r\nbut employed more than half the industrial labor force.\r\n\r\nAvailable information on the structure of industry is ambiguous because\r\nof uncertainties regarding the pricing methods underlying the relevant\r\ndata. According to the official figures for 1967 based on 1966 prices,\r\nthe food industry accounted for nearly one-third and light industry for\r\nalmost one-fourth of the total industrial output. The balance of 44\r\npercent was produced by some fourteen or more industry branches, the\r\nrelative shares of which ranged from 8.0 percent for metalworking and\r\nfor timber and wood processing to 0.3 percent for the bitumen industry.\r\nAs a group, six industry branches engaged in oil production and mining\r\ncontributed about 15 percent of the output. The building materials\r\nindustry accounted for 5 percent and electric power production, for not\r\nquite 4 percent.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the output of capital goods and that of\r\nconsumer goods is equally ambiguous. The share of capital goods in the\r\noutput of 1968 was officially reported as 55.5 percent, as against 44.5\r\npercent for consumer goods. The apparent discrepancy between the\r\nreported shares in total output of consumer goods as compared with the\r\nproduction of the light and food industries may be explained, in part,\r\nby the fact that a portion of these industries' output is usually\r\nincluded among capital goods as, for instance, textiles used by the\r\nclothing industry and leather used by the shoe industry.\r\n\r\nForeign observers have reported the country's industry to be poorly\r\nbalanced not only in a technical sense but also in terms of essential\r\ndomestic needs and the availability of foreign outlets for its products.\r\nThe metalworking industry, for example, which is limited to the\r\nproduction of automotive and industrial spare parts, apart from a few\r\ntypes of simple agricultural equipment and household utensils, cannot\r\neven ensure the maintenance of the existing machinery inventory because\r\nit is able to supply only about 60 to 70 percent of the country's needs.\r\nIndustrial production is substantially oriented toward capital goods and\r\nexports, whereas the manufacture of products for domestic consumption\r\ncontinues to be severely restricted.\r\n\r\nThe leadership is aware of industry's structural shortcomings and is\r\nintent on overcoming them through a program involving the reconstruction\r\nand modernization of old plants and the concentration of small shops\r\ninto larger, more efficient specialized units. Progress in this\r\ndirection, however, has been hampered by inadequate investment resources\r\nand by a reluctance of managers and workers to cooperate with this\r\nprogram. It has also been handicapped by a lack of effective planning\r\nand by an inability to organize comprehensive studies that would provide\r\na basis for both overall and detailed plans.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a few plants for the manufacture of machine spare parts\r\nand of simple equipment were formed through the concentration of milling\r\nmachines previously installed in maintenance shops of various\r\nenterprises, and a step toward the consolidation of small artisan shops\r\nwas taken in May 1969 by transforming artisans' cooperatives into state\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nOwing to the lack of prior industrial experience by both managers and\r\nlabor, industry also suffers from poor organization of production and of\r\nthe material supply, low labor productivity, and generally inferior\r\nquality of product. Extensive discussion of these problems in the\r\nofficial press indicates that government efforts toward reducing the\r\nmagnitude of these problems are slow in bearing fruit, despite programs\r\nfor vocational training and intensive campaigns of political\r\nindoctrination aimed at generating productive enthusiasm and innovative\r\ninitiative among workers and managers. A major campaign is being waged\r\nto eradicate artisan traditions and to replace them with industrial\r\nproduction line methods. The basic difficulty in achieving greater\r\nefficiency lies in the continuing severe shortage of skilled manpower\r\nand of personnel with adequate training in the economics and mechanics\r\nof industrial production.\r\n\r\nBecause of the underlying pricing methods, officially reported data on\r\ntotal industrial production in value terms overstate the actual rate of\r\ngrowth attained. Substantial industrial progress is, nevertheless,\r\nindicated by physical production data for a number of commodities (see\r\ntable 12). Since production had started from nothing or from very low\r\nlevels in the early post-World War II years, the rates of growth in\r\noutput were substantially higher during the 1950s than in the following\r\ndecade.\r\n\r\nThe highest rates of increase during the 1960s, ranging from five to\r\nthree times the initial volume, were achieved in the production of\r\ncopper, electric power, and cement. Increases of from 69 to 80 percent\r\nwere attained for coal, oil, and iron-nickel ore. Production of textiles\r\nand footwear grew by more than half, and that of knitwear more than\r\ndoubled. A substantial advance was also made by the food-processing\r\nindustry. Least progress was made in the production of cigarettes and\r\nbricks--only about 6 to 7 percent--and the output of timber actually\r\ndeclined from 6 million to 5 million cubic feet. Most of the mining\r\noutput and a substantial share of the food industry production are\r\nexported.\r\n\r\nRapid electrification of the country has been a major goal of the\r\nleadership. Electrification is intended to meet the needs of industrial\r\ndevelopment and help attain a higher standard of living in rural areas.\r\nA crash program has been underway to bring electric power to every\r\nvillage, even in the remotest areas. This project was originally\r\nscheduled to be completed in 1985, but the date has been advanced to\r\nNovember 8, 1971, the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the\r\nruling Albanian Workers' Party. The program is being carried out by the\r\nprevailing method of mass mobilization for voluntary work.\r\n\r\nInstalled capacity in 1969 was reported to be 210,000 kilowatts, of\r\nwhich 128,000 kilowatts were in thermal powerplants and 82,000 kilowatts\r\nin hydroelectric power stations. This capacity reflected a fourfold\r\nincrease since 1960, a large part of which was accounted for by a single\r\nthermal plant of 100,000-kilowatt capacity put into operation in late\r\n1969. The country's hydroelectric power potential has been estimated by\r\nAlbanian technicians as roughly 3 billion kilowatt-hours per year, half\r\nof which is represented by the Drin River. Development of this\r\npotential has barely begun. The first major plant on the Drin with a\r\ncapacity of 225,000 kilowatts is scheduled for completion at Vau i Dejes\r\nin 1971, and a second station on that river with a capacity of 400,000\r\nkilowatts is to be built at Fierze during the Fifth Five-Year Plan\r\n(1971-75).\r\n\r\n_Table 12.

Output of power rose from 194 million kilowatt-hours\r\nin 1960 to 324 million kilowatt-hours in 1965 and almost 800,000 million\r\nkilowatt-hours in 1969. The distribution system has also been rapidly\r\nextended and in 1969 included about 800 miles of high-tension\r\ntransmission lines of 35 and 110 kilovolts. Distribution and use of\r\nelectric power were reported to be very wasteful, with losses as high as\r\n115 million kilowatt-hours in 1969--almost 15 percent of total output.\r\nInformation on the pattern of electric power consumption has not been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCE\r\n\r\nFinancial operations have been shrouded in secrecy, and little\r\ninformation can be gleaned from the limited published data. These data,\r\nnevertheless, reflect some of the leadership's basic economic policies,\r\nsuch as its emphasis on rapidly increasing production while restraining\r\na rise in consumption, its preference for industrial development as\r\nagainst agricultural growth, and its drive to mobilize domestic\r\nresources for economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Budget\r\n\r\nInformation on budgetary practices is not available, and statistics\r\nrelating to the budget are incomplete. The relation between three\r\ndifferent budgets approved annually by the People's Assembly on\r\nrecommendation of the Council of Ministers is therefore unclear. There\r\nis a state and a national budget and a budget for local government. The\r\nbudget for local government has been growing slowly in relation to the\r\nstate-budget--from 16 percent in 1955 to 17 percent in 1960 and 20\r\npercent in 1969 and 1970.\r\n\r\nOnly about one-fourth of local budgetary revenue is derived from local\r\ntaxation, which implies a substantial subsidy from the central\r\ngovernment budget. The amount of this subsidy is roughly double the\r\nusual 7- to 8-percent difference between the state and the smaller\r\nnational budget. A surmise that the state budget represents an overall\r\nbudget and that the national budget serves to finance central government\r\nactivities only is therefore not warranted.\r\n\r\nExcept for a slight decline in revenues in 1961 and 1963, coincident\r\nwith the country's political and economic break with the Soviet Union,\r\nthe annual state budget has been rising steadily to a level of 5.21\r\nbillion leks (5 leks equal US$1--see Glossary) in revenues and 5.11\r\nbillion leks in expenditures for 1970. By comparison with the budget for\r\n1960, revenues increased by 85 percent and expenditures by 102 percent,\r\nwith a corresponding decline of 65 percent in the budgetary surplus. On\r\na five-year basis, comparing the Fourth Five-Year Plan with the Third\r\nFive-Year Plan, both revenues and expenditures rose by about 40 percent,\r\nwith a slightly higher increase in revenues.\r\n\r\nA relatively greater stringency of funds for budgetary purposes after\r\nthe break with the Soviet Union is reflected in the planned annual\r\nbudgetary surplus, a permanent feature since 1946 and a matter of great\r\npride for the leadership. From a level of almost 24 percent in 1950, 15\r\npercent in 1955, and 10 percent in 1960, the surplus dropped to 1.1\r\npercent in 1962 and 1.5 percent in 1963. Despite a slight recovery in\r\nsubsequent years, except for 1968 when it declined to only 1 percent of\r\nrevenues, the planned surplus did not again approach its earlier size.\r\n\r\nPartial information on sources of revenue is available to 1967.\r\nPublished statistics listed a turnover tax on all goods produced,\r\ndeductions from enterprise profits, direct taxes on the population\r\n(primarily income taxes), and social insurance premiums. These sources\r\nyielded, on an average, 60 percent of the total revenue in the 1960-65\r\nperiod, and their share rose steeply to 74 percent in 1967. The balance\r\nof the revenue, omitted from official statistics, consisted primarily of\r\nincome from agriculture in the form of compulsory deliveries, proceeds\r\nfrom state farm operations, payments to machine-tractor stations, and\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThe most important among the listed revenue sources were the turnover\r\ntax and deductions from profits. Together their yields ranged from 50\r\npercent of total revenue in 1960 to almost 69 percent in 1967, but their\r\nrelative weights changed markedly during this period. In 1960 the\r\nturnover tax yielded 40 percent and profit deductions 10 percent of\r\nrevenue; by 1967 their respective shares were 43 and 26 percent. Social\r\ninsurance premiums contributed between 3.2 and 4.5 percent, while the\r\nyield from direct taxes on the population declined from 2.7 percent in\r\n1960 to less than 1 percent in 1967. In 1969 income taxation was\r\nabolished for individuals and for some poor collective farms in hilly\r\nand mountainous areas.\r\n\r\nThe leadership has claimed that the abolition of direct taxes on the\r\npopulation with the concomitant improvement in public welfare was made\r\npossible by the country's economic advance based on the Party's correct\r\nrevolutionary policy, and it contrasted the progressive nature of this\r\nmeasure with an alleged intensification of exploitation and misery of\r\nworkers in what are officially called imperialist and modern-revisionist\r\ncountries. This comparison ignores the existence of the turnover tax,\r\nwhich is particularly heavy on consumer goods, and of the enterprise\r\nprofits deduction, both of which are reflected in the sales price of\r\ncommodities and, consequently, represent a hidden form of sales taxes.\r\nThis method of taxation is known to be regressive, in that it takes no\r\naccount of differences in income and places the heaviest burden on those\r\nleast able to pay.\r\n\r\nThe published budget laws usually specify the amount of revenue to be\r\nderived from the socialized economy, including collective farms and\r\ncooperative enterprises. The proportion of this revenue was reported to\r\nhave been 85.5 percent in 1960 and from 88 to 89 percent in the 1968-70\r\nperiod. This information cannot be reconciled with the published revenue\r\nstatistics, particularly with the data concerning the taxation of\r\nnoncollectivized farm enterprises, the proceeds from which were reported\r\nto be less than 0.5 percent in 1964. The revenue from the nonsocialized\r\nsector consists mostly of taxes imposed on the output from personal farm\r\nplots of collective and state farm workers and, to a lesser extent, of\r\ntaxes on some private artisan and other activities still tolerated by\r\nthe government within narrowly prescribed limits.\r\n\r\nInformation on budgetary expenditures is also incomplete. Published\r\nstatistics failed to specify the use of 17.5 percent of the total\r\noutlays in the 1960-65 period, and no explanation is readily at hand for\r\nthe decline of the unallocated residue from that level to between 3 and\r\n4 percent in 1968-70. The published data included outlays for the\r\nnational economy, social and cultural needs, defense, and\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of total expenditures devoted to social and cultural\r\nneeds and to defense remained remarkably stable between 1960 and 1970.\r\nAnnual outlays for these two categories fluctuated, respectively, only\r\nfrom 22.6 to 25.1 percent and from 7.6 to 9.9 percent of total\r\nexpenditures. The share of administrative expenditures declined steadily\r\nduring this period from 2.7 to 1.7 percent. Outlays for the national\r\neconomy were also shown by the published statistics to have been quite\r\nstable in the 1960-65 period, with an annual variation of only 2.6\r\npercent. Coincident with the decline and virtual disappearance of the\r\nunreported expenditure residue after 1965, however, the share of\r\nindustry rose sharply from 46 percent in 1965 to more than 64 percent in\r\n1968 and remained above 61 percent through 1970. The reasons for, and\r\nthe implications of, this change in reporting practice are not known.\r\n\r\nAn average of 47 percent of the budgetary expenditures in the 1960-67\r\nperiod was devoted to investment, with annual fluctuations of this\r\ncategory between 39 and 55 percent. The lowest rates of investment\r\noccurred in 1962 and 1963 as an aftermath of the abrupt cessation of\r\nSoviet aid deliveries. In absolute terms the volume of investment\r\nincreased from 1.1 billion leks in 1960 to 1.8 billion leks in 1967.\r\nTotal investment for the years 1966-70 was planned at 6.5 billion leks,\r\nan increase of 34 percent over investments in the preceding five-year\r\nperiod. Actual investment in the years 1966-69 was reported to have\r\nexceeded the plan for those years by 12 percent. In line with the\r\nParty's policy of promoting a rapid growth of the country's productive\r\ncapacity, from 80 to 82 percent of the investment has been devoted to\r\nthe construction of facilities for material production.\r\n\r\nIndustry has received the largest share of investment--48 percent in the\r\n1961-65 period and 50 percent under the plan for 1966-70. On an annual\r\nbasis, industry's share ranged from a low of 36 percent in 1962 to a\r\nhigh of 61 percent in 1965. The proportion of agricultural investment\r\nwas much lower--only 15 percent of the total in 1961-65 and less than 19\r\npercent of the total planned for 1966-70. During the first two years of\r\nthe 1966-70 period, actual investment in agriculture lagged\r\nsubstantially and amounted to only 11.7 and 16.2 percent, respectively.\r\nThe lack of adequate investments has been a contributing cause of poor\r\nagricultural performance. There has been no consistency in the pattern\r\nof industrial and agricultural investment. The respective shares of\r\nthese two sectors in total investment fluctuated widely from year to\r\nyear in the 1960-67 period. An adequate explanation of the reasons for\r\nthis fluctuation has not been found.\r\n\r\nInvestment in housing and for social and cultural purposes has been\r\nminimal--8.1 and 3.7 percent, respectively, in the 1961-65 period and\r\n6.1 and 8.1 percent, respectively, under the plan for 1966-70. As in the\r\ncase of agriculture, actual investment in 1966-67 was substantially\r\nbelow the planned levels and amounted to less than 5 percent for housing\r\nand 2 percent for social and cultural needs. This capital starvation has\r\nbeen largely responsible for the dismal housing situation and for the\r\ninadequacy of other essential amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney and Banking\r\n\r\nThe lek, divided into 100 quintars, is a nonconvertible paper currency\r\nwith multiple official exchange rates. The basic official rate since\r\nAugust 10, 1965, has been 5 leks for 1 United States dollar, a rate that\r\nhas no applicability in practice. Up to 1965 the exchange value had been\r\n50 leks per US$1. The change in par value had no economic significance\r\nbecause prices, wages, and all other monetary values were reduced by the\r\nsame ratio.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of so-called tourist or support leks. A rate of\r\n12.50 leks per US$1 applies to the official exchange of Western\r\ncurrencies by nonresidents and to support payments received by residents\r\nfrom Western sources. A rate of 7.55 leks per US$1 applies to the\r\nexchange by Communist country residents of their national currencies and\r\nto support and other noncommercial payments transferred by them from\r\nAlbania to Communist states. A third variety of official exchange rates\r\nconsists of the rates used to balance clearing accounts under special\r\ntrade and payments agreements with Communist countries. An illegal black\r\nmarket rate of about 60 leks per US$1 from early 1968 through early 1969\r\nwas reported by reliable sources.\r\n\r\nAll currency matters are administered by the National Bank jointly with\r\nthe ministries of finance and trade. Albania is not a member of the\r\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development or of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund.\r\n\r\nAdequate information is not available on the nature of the relationship\r\nbetween the State Bank and the Ministry of Finance or on the bank's\r\nfinancial operations beyond some outdated statistics on credits and\r\nsavings deposits. As the principal financial institution, the State Bank\r\ncarries out the financial policies of the Party and government. It\r\nissues currency, provides credit to all economic sectors, accepts\r\nsavings deposits, and serves as the country's treasury. In addition to\r\nthese functions, the State Bank helps prepare the financial plans for\r\nthe economy, is called upon to assist enterprises in completing their\r\nplanned assignments, and is responsible for controlling all economic\r\nactivities through the use of its financial levers.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1969 the State Bank was severely criticized for poor performance,\r\nparticularly its failure to exercise adequate control over unauthorized\r\nuse of funds and waste of materials by the enterprises it helped to\r\nfinance. The bank's failure was largely precipitated by uncertainties\r\ncreated through a decentralization of economic authority, decreed by the\r\nParty, and a dilution of the bank's control function.\r\n\r\nA specialized system of state savings and securities banks was\r\nestablished within the Ministry of Finance in November 1968, for the\r\npurpose of mobilizing the population's savings for investment through\r\nloans to the state and the sale of its securities. The text of the law\r\nthat created this institution contained no provision concerning the\r\nrelation of these new savings and securities banks to the State Bank.\r\nFurther information on the new banks was not available in mid-1970.\r\n\r\nThe only available information on the State Bank's financial operations\r\nconsists of partial data on loans to agriculture and for housing and on\r\nthe number and amount of savings deposits. The total volume of farm\r\ncredits, exclusive of credits to state farms for which statistics have\r\nnot been published, increased from 95 million leks in 1960 to 252\r\nmillion leks in 1964, including long-term loans of 38 million and 44\r\nmillion leks, respectively. By 1967 long-term loans had increased to 56\r\nmillion leks. The statistics do not indicate whether the published data\r\nrefer to the annual volume of loans granted or to the total amount of\r\noutstanding loans. A small fraction of the loans after 1960 was granted\r\nto individual peasants for the purchase of livestock.\r\n\r\nLoans for housing construction and repair declined drastically from 17\r\nmillion leks in 1960 to only 7 million leks in 1964. The distribution of\r\nthe loans between urban and rural areas fluctuated widely, but urban\r\nloans predominated by a large margin and constituted from 69 to 93\r\npercent of the total. The number of savings accounts increased from\r\n235,400 in 1960 to 445,000 in 1968, and the volume of deposits rose from\r\n119 million to 247 million leks. Interest paid on these amounts totaled\r\n3.6 million and 4.8 million leks in the respective years, which implies\r\na reduction of the interest rate from about 3.0 to 2.5 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS\r\n\r\nForeign Aid\r\n\r\nThe country's foreign economic relations have been conditioned by its\r\nleadership's economic goals and political persuasion. As a poor,\r\nundeveloped country intent on modernizing and expanding its economy at a\r\nrapid pace, Albania has had to rely heavily on foreign economic and\r\ntechnical assistance during the post-World War II period. The\r\nleadership's extreme Marxist orientation and hostility toward the\r\nWestern nations have precluded a recourse to non-Communist sources of\r\naid and have made the country entirely dependent upon contributions by\r\nother Communist states. But even within the Communist sphere political\r\ndisagreements have had a disruptive effect on aid arrangements (see ch.\r\n6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nFrom 1945 to 1948 economic and technical assistance was received from\r\nYugoslavia. After the political break between that country and Albania,\r\nthe Soviet Union assumed the role of major aid donor, and smaller\r\ncontributions were made by some of the East European Communist states.\r\nSince 1961, when the substantial support of the Soviet Union was lost in\r\nthe wake of the political schism within the Communist world engendered\r\nby the Sino-Soviet dispute, Albania has been able to obtain assistance\r\nonly from the People's Republic of China (Communist China). The\r\nreadjustment necessitated by the abrupt withdrawal of all Soviet aid and\r\ntechnical advisers was said by Albanian leaders to have retarded\r\neconomic development by three years.\r\n\r\nThe extent of aid received in the form of long-term loans, some of which\r\nbecame grants through debt cancellations, is only partially known. The\r\namount of total loan commitments by the Soviet Union in United States\r\ndollar equivalents for the period of 1945 through 1961 was estimated by\r\none Western source at US$246 million. Another Western source reported\r\nthe amount of loans promised by the Soviet Union and the East European\r\nCommunist states for the 1961-65 period to have been in excess of\r\nUS$132.5 million. These loans were cancelled in their entirety in the\r\nspring of 1961. A partial list of Soviet loan commitments, compiled by a\r\nWestern student from Soviet economic literature, totaled US$172 million\r\nfor 1957-61. The actual amount disbursed, however, was much smaller.\r\n\r\nAid deliveries, as reflected in official Soviet statistics, totaled only\r\nUS$39.4 million for the years 1955-61. Similar information on aid\r\ndeliveries from 1949 to 1954 was not readily available. Western\r\nobservers believe that the economic crisis created by the Soviet\r\nwithdrawal of aid forced Albania to default on the outstanding loans.\r\n\r\nLoans granted by East European Communist states and outstanding in 1965\r\n(in terms of United States dollar equivalents) were given by a Soviet\r\nsource as follows: Bulgaria, US$11 million; Czechoslovakia, US$25\r\nmillion; East Germany, US$15 million; and Romania, US$7.5 million.\r\nInformation about repayments of these loans was not available. Only a\r\nfraction of the outstanding amounts could have been liquidated through\r\nAlbania's trade surplus with these countries. Some Western estimates\r\nplaced the debt to the Soviet Union and East European Communist states\r\nat the end of 1968 at a minimum of the equivalent of US$500 to US$600\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nEconomic aid by Communist China dates back at least to late 1954. Stated\r\nin United States dollar equivalents, Albania received in that year a\r\ngrant-in-aid of US$2.5 million and a loan of US$12.5 million. An\r\nadditional credit of US$13.75 million was made available in early 1959,\r\nand a loan of US$123 million for the purchase of industrial equipment\r\nduring the Third Five-Year Plan (1960-65) was extended in early 1961,\r\nafter Albania's break with the Soviet Union. Two more loans, for\r\nundisclosed amounts, were negotiated in June 1965 and November 1968 to\r\nfinance the fourth and fifth five-year plans, respectively. In public\r\nreferences to the 1968 loan, Party and government officials gave the\r\nimpression that it was substantially higher than the loan of\r\nUS$123-million obtained in 1961. Aid has been provided by Communist\r\nChina free of interest.\r\n\r\nA Western scholar reported unidentified sources to have suggested that\r\nthe 1965 loan amounted to about US$214 million, a sum substantially in\r\nexcess of the credits granted up to that time. Another Western source\r\nestimated total direct credits for the 1960-68 period to have been more\r\nthan US$450 million, exclusive of substantial grants. Yet, other Western\r\nsources thought at the time, and also in 1970, they had discerned\r\nevidence of disappointment on the part of the leadership with the extent\r\nof the financial assistance, delays in the supply of machinery, and an\r\nunwillingness or inability to supply much-needed consumer goods. The\r\nleadership's awareness of the inadequacy of foreign aid in relation to\r\nthe planned development program has been evidenced, in its appeals for\r\ngreater productivity, by the high frequency of references to the Party's\r\nprinciple of reliance on the country's own efforts and in its continuing\r\ncampaign for the utmost economy of resources.\r\n\r\nThe country's cumulative clearing debt to Communist China on the\r\ncommodity trading account at the end of 1968 was estimated at roughly\r\nUS$300 million. This amount did not include the substantial additional\r\ncosts of assistance in the form of technical advisers who have guided\r\nthe construction and operation of major industrial projects. Estimates\r\nof these costs or of the number of aid technicians in the country were\r\nnot available.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign Trade\r\n\r\nBecause of the dearth of domestic resources in relation to the needs for\r\neconomic development and consumption, foreign trade has consistently\r\nshown a negative balance. A marked improvement in this respect has taken\r\nplace since 1955, even though the absolute deficit has been growing with\r\nthe rising trade volume. In the 1960s exports covered 60 percent or more\r\nof imports, compared with 47 percent in the 1956-60 period and 31\r\npercent in the preceding eleven post-World War II years. This\r\nimprovement in the trade balance has been achieved through a consistent\r\npolicy of diversifying domestic production with a view to import\r\nsubstitution, developing all possible resources for the production of\r\nexportable goods, improving product quality, and severely restricting\r\ndomestic consumption. The annual trade deficit in 1967 and 1968 was\r\nabout 200 million leks.\r\n\r\nThe volume of trade has been rising quite steadily from 140 million leks\r\nin 1950 to 950 million leks in 1968. During this period imports\r\nincreased from 110 million to 580 million leks, and exports rose from 30\r\nmillion to 370 million leks. The Fourth Five-Year Plan calls for an\r\nincrease of 31 percent in total trade over the volume of the preceding\r\nfive years, including an increase of 36 percent in exports and 28\r\npercent in imports. These figures imply a planned average annual trade\r\nvolume in the 1966-70 period of 885 million leks, of which 355 million\r\nleks were exports and 530 million leks imports. Although the rate of\r\ntrade expansion during 1966-68 exceeded the target, the export-import\r\nratio was not as favorable as that called for by the plan.\r\n\r\nThe directional pattern of the country's foreign trade has conformed to\r\nthe general observation that trade follows aid. The assumption by\r\nCommunist China in 1961 of the major aid donor position previously held\r\nby the Soviet Union had an immediate and pronounced impact on the\r\ndirection of trade. In 1960 Communist China accounted for only 7 percent\r\nof the total trade volume, as against 54 percent for the Soviet Union.\r\nBy 1962 trade with Communist China had grown to 51 percent of a somewhat\r\nsmaller total volume, whereas trade with the Soviets had ceased\r\naltogether by 1963. In 1964 Communist China's share of the trade was\r\nequal to that of the Soviet Union in 1960, and the actual volume\r\nrepresented by that share was 23 percent larger. During the 1962-68\r\nperiod trade with Communist China amounted to about half the total trade\r\nvolume, but the share of Communist China declined below that level\r\ntoward the end of this period. This decline was the result of a\r\nsuccessful effort by the leadership to expand the country's trade with\r\nboth Communist Eastern Europe and the non-Communist West.\r\n\r\nTrade with the Communist countries of Eastern Europe, other than\r\nYugoslavia, continued after the break with the Soviet Union and\r\nincreased by 66 percent from 226 million leks in 1960 to about 375\r\nmillion leks in 1968. The share of this group in total trade rose during\r\nthis period from 35 to 40 percent, almost entirely after 1964. Albania's\r\nmost important trade partner in this group has been Czechoslovakia,\r\nsecond only to Communist China with a volume of 118 million leks in\r\n1968, equivalent to about 12 percent of Albania's total trade volume in\r\nthat year. Following Czechoslovakia in order of importance were Poland,\r\nEast Germany, and Bulgaria, with trade volumes ranging from 69 million\r\nto 53 million leks. Trade with Hungary and Romania amounted to about 40\r\nmillion leks and 32 million leks, respectively. With the exception of\r\nPoland and Romania, Albania's trade balance with the countries of\r\nEastern Europe was positive between 1960 and 1968. The excess of\r\nexports over imports during this period totaled about 65 million leks.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the country's dependence upon Soviet aid,\r\ntrade with non-Communist countries and with Yugoslavia had been\r\ndiscontinued, but it was resumed on a very small scale by 1955. In 1964\r\nthis trade amounted to only 65 million leks (equivalent to US$13 million\r\nat the official rate of exchange), or 8 percent of the total trade\r\nturnover. Fully two-thirds of this trade was accounted for by Italy and\r\nFrance. During the following four years trade with the West and\r\nYugoslavia increased 2-½ times to 160 million leks in 1968, and the\r\nshare of this trade in the total turnover doubled.\r\n\r\nItaly continued to be the major Western trade partner, with a turnover\r\nof 66 million leks in 1968, but the largest advance was made in the\r\ntrade with Yugoslavia. The total trade turnover with that country rose\r\nfiftyfold in one year, from 400,000 leks in 1965 to more than 20 million\r\nleks in 1966. Under the 1970 trade agreement the trade volume is\r\nscheduled to reach 50 million leks. In 1968 Italy and Yugoslavia\r\ntogether absorbed four-fifths of the combined exports to the West and\r\nYugoslavia and supplied more than half the imports from that area.\r\n\r\nAnother striking example of the country's trade expansion effort is the\r\nagreement with Greece, a country with which Albania has had no political\r\nor economic relations for thirty years. Signed by the chambers of\r\ncommerce of both countries in January 1970 and effective for one year,\r\nthis agreement provided for an initial turnover of 7.5 million leks, of\r\nwhich 4 million leks were in imports and 3.5 million leks in exports.\r\nCommercial orders worth about 1.5 million leks on both sides were\r\nreported to have been placed by mid-1970.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 trade relations were officially reported to have been maintained\r\nwith forty different countries. Relations with thirteen of these\r\ncountries, both Communist and non-Communist, were formalized by trade\r\nagreements.\r\n\r\nImports have overwhelmingly served the needs of production and\r\nindustrial expansion. Almost 50 percent of the imports in 1964 consisted\r\nof machinery, equipment, and spare parts. More than 23 percent was\r\naccounted for by minerals and metals, chemical and rubber products, and\r\nconstruction materials. Another 16 percent was made up of agricultural\r\nraw materials, about two-thirds of which was destined for the\r\nfood-processing industry. Only 11 percent of the imports consisted of\r\nfinished consumer goods and ready-to-eat foods. Continuing Party and\r\ngovernment emphasis on increasing production and the improved domestic\r\noutput of foods suggests that the production-oriented nature of imports\r\ndid not change significantly by 1970.\r\n\r\nExports have consisted predominantly of minerals and mineral products\r\nbut have also included significant amounts of agricultural products and\r\nmanufactured consumer goods. In 1969 petroleum and natural bitumen,\r\nchromium and ferronickel ores, and copper (including copper wire),\r\nconstituted 55 percent of exports. Another 25 percent comprised\r\nprocessed foods, such as canned fish and vegetables and preserved\r\nfruits; light industry products, including cotton and linen textiles and\r\nsome readymade clothes; and a few chemicals. The balance of 20 percent\r\nwas represented by fresh fruits and vegetables and by agricultural raw\r\nmaterials, such as hides and skins, tannins, and medicinal plants.\r\nExports of fruits and vegetables to central and northern Europe have\r\nbeen growing rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe share of manufactured and semiprocessed products in exports was also\r\nofficially reported to be increasing and to have constituted 51 percent\r\nof the export volume in 1968. Students of Albanian affairs have reported\r\nthat some of the country's exports are not competitive in world markets\r\nand that Communist China has been willing to absorb them at a good price\r\nonly for political reasons, as did the Soviet Union before 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nINTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SECURITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe armed forces in 1970 were under the Ministry of People's Defense,\r\nand all elements were included within the People's Army. Total personnel\r\nstrength was about 40,000. Most troops were acquired by conscription,\r\nand about one-half of the eligible young men were drafted, usually at\r\nage nineteen. All of the tanks, aircraft, and vehicles used by the armed\r\nforces were of Soviet design, but since 1961 all external assistance has\r\nbeen provided by the Communist Chinese. Military ranks were abolished in\r\n1966, but the force organization at lower levels in all service\r\ncomponents was conventional.\r\n\r\nThe modern armed forces grew out of the partisan units of World War II,\r\nduring which they fought against the Italians, the Germans, and each\r\nother. By the time of the German evacuation of Albania in November 1944,\r\nthe Communist-led National Liberation Front held the dominant position\r\namong the partisans and was able to assume control of the country\r\nwithout fighting any major battles.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian Workers' Party (Communist Party) had an active organization\r\nwithin the services. All or nearly all officers in the regular services\r\nwere Party members in 1970. All cadets over eighteen years of age in the\r\nofficer candidate military schools were also Party members. Younger\r\ncadets were members of the Union of Albanian Working Youth. Probably\r\nonly a very few of the conscripts were Party members, but nearly all\r\nwere members of the youth organization. In addition to the influence\r\nexerted by Party cells, political commissars throughout the armed forces\r\nstructure enforced ideological conformity.\r\n\r\nThe Albanian fighting man has had an excellent reputation for 2,000\r\nyears but, with the exception of Skanderbeg, the fifteenth-century\r\nnational hero--he was born Gjergi Kastrioti and renamed Skanderbeg after\r\nAlexander the Great--the military forces of the country have disclaimed\r\nany heritage antedating the partisan activities of World War II.\r\nSkanderbeg gained brief independence for the country during his\r\nopposition to the Turkish invaders, but his exploits in support of\r\nnationalism stood almost alone over the entire period between Roman\r\ntimes and the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nMoreover, national independence in 1912 did not result from a major\r\nmilitary victory. National feelings, aroused late in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, became more intense during the early 1900s but, although there\r\nwere clashes between fairly sizable armed groups of Turks and Albanians,\r\nfreedom was not attained from armed struggle involving organized\r\nmilitary forces. Rather, in the interests of the balance of power the\r\ngreater European powers recognized the declared independence of Albania\r\n(see ch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nPolice and security forces were under the control of the Ministry of the\r\nInterior. They were organized into three directorates: the Directorate\r\nof State Security, Frontier Guards, and the People's Police. Except for\r\nthe fact that they were subject to the same system of military justice,\r\nthey were entirely separate from the armed forces of the Ministry of\r\nPeople's Defense. The Albanian security police in 1970 were believed to\r\nexert more rigid controls over the population than was exercised by\r\nsimilar forces in any other East European Communist country or in the\r\nSoviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe Directorate of State Security contained the internal security\r\npolice. Organized to protect the Party and governmental system, they\r\nwere responsible for suppressing resistance to, and deviation from,\r\nParty ideology, and for combating crimes that had a national character.\r\nFrontier Guards, as their name implies, accomplished border security.\r\nThe People's Police were the local or municipal police, with the typical\r\nroutines and local interests of such forces.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain the overall effectiveness of the various\r\npolice and security forces in the maintenance of public order because no\r\nofficial crime statistics are published. Official statements in the\r\npress provide little or no information on the extent of crime other than\r\nthe inordinate coverage of those crimes that are political in nature and\r\nconsidered threatening to the Party or the state. Statements by the rare\r\nWestern visitors to the country concerning the police state atmosphere\r\nhave led to the assumption that public order is rigidly maintained.\r\n\r\nAlthough military and security forces were small in proportion to the\r\nsize of the military age male population, they were nearly double the\r\nper capita average maintained by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) or by Warsaw Pact nations. Whether or not the people recognized\r\nthe armed forces as a burden, the country has never had the industrial\r\nor economic base to maintain them. Since World War II it has relied, in\r\nturn, on Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and Communist China for aid.\r\nChinese assistance since 1961 has been sufficient to maintain equipment\r\npreviously furnished by the Soviet Union and to replace some of the\r\nolder weapons as they became obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe free-spirited and hardy Albanian mountaineers have had excellent\r\nreputations as individual fighters. The Romans recruited some of their\r\nbest soldiers from the regions that later became Albania. In succeeding\r\nperiods many Albanians became famous in the military service of the\r\nOttomans.\r\n\r\nNationalism was rarely necessary to motivate these men. Before 1912 the\r\ncountry had independence for only one brief period. It was gained then\r\nby the national hero, Skanderbeg, and freedom evaporated almost\r\nimmediately upon his death in 1468. The history and legends attached to\r\nhim make up a large part of the national military tradition. Other than\r\nin his day, freedom was rarely fought for except in the context of\r\ndefense of tribal areas against the incursions of marauding neighbors.\r\nThere were few occasions when Albanians rose up against occupying\r\nforeign powers. Conquerors generally left the people alone in their\r\nisolated mountain homelands and, as a feudal tribal society persisted,\r\nthere was little if any feeling of national unity in the country (see\r\nch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nOrganized military action also played an almost negligible part in\r\nattaining independence. Some revolutionary activity occurred during the\r\nrise of national feeling in the late nineteenth and early twentieth\r\ncenturies. There were clashes between insurgents and Turkish forces as\r\nearly as 1884 but, at the same time that the Albanians were resisting\r\nTurkish practices they considered oppressive against themselves, they\r\nwere defending the Turks in their hostilities with the Greeks or the\r\nSlavs. They continued to be recruited into, and to serve in, the Turkish\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nBy 1900 about 8,000 armed Albanians were assembled in Shkoder, but they\r\nwere unopposed, and a situation resembling anarchy more than revolution\r\nprevailed in the country during the early 1900s. There were arrests,\r\nincidents of banditry and pillage, and many futile Turkish efforts to\r\nrestore order. Guerrilla activity increased after about 1906, and\r\nseveral incidents occurred, which produced martyrs but which were not\r\nmarked by great numbers of casualties. Nevertheless, although it was\r\nunorganized and never assumed the proportions of a serious struggle, the\r\nresistance was instrumental in maintaining the pressure that attracted\r\ninternational attention and led the great powers, when they intervened\r\nafter the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913, to recognize the independent\r\nstate of Albania.\r\n\r\nWorld War I began before the country could establish a viable\r\ngovernmental body--much less form, train, and equip a military\r\nestablishment. During the war years it was occupied by the warring\r\nparties, and the last of them remained into 1920.\r\n\r\nAhmet Zogu--as minister of the interior and minister of war until 1922\r\nand prime minister from 1922, except for a brief exile in 1924, until he\r\nbecame King Zog in 1928--created the first national forces of any\r\nconsequence. Before 1925, so that he would have some assurance of their\r\nloyalty, these consisted of about 5,000 men from his home tribal\r\ndistrict. Starting in about 1925 with Italian assistance and a\r\nconsiderable degree of Italian control over the forces, men were drawn\r\nthrough universal conscription. The first drafts called about 5,000 to\r\n6,000 annually from the approximately 10,000 young men who became\r\neligible for the draft each year. Italian aid equipped the forces, and\r\nItalian officers provided most of the training and tactical guidance, to\r\nthe point that they had effective control over their employment.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time the Gendarmerie was formed with British\r\nassistance. It had an Albanian director, a British general who served as\r\nits inspector general, and a staff of British inspectors. The\r\nGendarmerie became an effective internal security and police\r\norganization. It had a commandant in each of the ten prefectures, a\r\nheadquarters in each of the subprefectures (up to eight per prefecture),\r\nand a post in each of the nearly 150 local communities. Its\r\ncommunications network was for many years the most complete telephone\r\nsystem in the country.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Italians objected strenuously, King Zog used the\r\nGendarmerie as a safeguard against the possible consequences of Italian\r\ndomination of his regular armed forces. He kept the force under his\r\ndirect control and retained its British advisers until 1938. Zog also\r\nretained a sizable armed group from his old tribal region.\r\n\r\nKing Zog's efforts to reduce Italian control over his forces were\r\ninsufficient to save them from quick humiliation before World War II.\r\nThe Italians attacked on April 7, 1939, and, although annual\r\nconscription had created a trained reserve of at least 50,000 men, it\r\nwas never called. Resistance was overcome in about a week. Later in 1939\r\nthe Italians incorporated Albanian units into their forces. Little\r\nbenefit was derived from the Albanians, who could see little point in\r\nfighting for the Italians, even against their traditional enemies, the\r\nGreeks. They deserted in large numbers (see ch. 2, Historical Setting).\r\n\r\nResistance to the occupation grew rapidly as signs of Italian weakness\r\nbecame apparent. At the end of 1942 guerrilla forces had numbered no\r\nmore than perhaps 8,000 to 10,000. By the summer of 1943, when the\r\nItalian effort collapsed, almost all of the mountainous interior was\r\ncontrolled by various resistance groups.\r\n\r\nThe Germans took over the occupation from the Italians and inflicted\r\nnear-decisive defeat upon the guerrillas in January 1944. Resistance\r\ngrew again, however, as final defeat for the Axis powers appeared\r\ncertain, and by the end of 1944 guerrilla forces probably totaled about\r\n70,000 men. In addition, by their count, they had suffered about 28,000\r\ncasualties. The Communist-controlled National Liberation Movement had\r\nthen solidified its hold over the guerrilla groups and was able to take\r\nover the country after the war. Enver Hoxha had been the chief political\r\ncommissar of the General Staff that was created in July 1943. From that\r\npost he rose rapidly to leadership of the group and through it became\r\nthe head of the Communist government that took over at the end of World\r\nWar II.\r\n\r\nAlbania's first Communist military forces were equipped, trained, and\r\nmodeled after Yugoslavia's. When Yugoslavia embarked on its separate\r\nroad to socialism in 1948 and was expelled from the Communist\r\nInformation Bureau (Cominform--see Glossary), Albania aligned directly\r\nwith the Soviet Union. This did not involve an immediate change in\r\nmateriel, organization, or training because the Soviet Union and\r\nYugoslavia had had much the same relationship before their break.\r\n\r\nSoviet aid included advisory personnel, a considerable amount of modern\r\nconventional armament, a few small World War II naval vessels, and a\r\nnumber of aircraft. This aid was halted entirely in 1961. The Soviet\r\nsubmarine flotilla that had been based on Sazan Island, off Vlore,\r\npassed Gibraltar in June 1961 on its way back to northern Soviet ports.\r\n\r\nCommunist China succeeded the Soviet Union as Albania's ally. Albania\r\ncan provide China with little of tactical importance, but its value as\r\nan ally from a political standpoint has been sufficient to warrant\r\ncontinuation of aid in quantities sufficient to maintain the armed\r\nforces at about the same levels of personnel strength and equipment that\r\nthey had achieved when they were supported by the Soviet Union, although\r\ninterruptions in training are believed to have caused a deterioration in\r\ntechnical skills and know-how.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT\r\n\r\nPosition in the Government\r\n\r\nThe People's Army, which encompasses the ground, naval, and air arms of\r\nthe regular armed forces, is under the Ministry of People's Defense,\r\nwhich, in turn, is within the Council of Ministers. The ministers are\r\nselected from the People's Assembly which, with its Presidium, is at\r\nthe top of the governmental structure (see ch. 6, Government Structure\r\nand Political System).\r\n\r\nIn mid-1970 the minister of defense, Beqir Balluku, was also a deputy\r\nprime minister and a member of the Political Bureau (Politburo) of the\r\nAlbanian Workers' Party. Balluku had a military career background and\r\nheld the rank of colonel general in the army before its ranks were\r\nabolished in 1966. As defense minister he exercised direct operational\r\nand administrative control over all elements of the military\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe People's Army\r\n\r\nThe army claims no antecedents in the forces of the pre-Communist\r\nregimes and dates itself from July 10, 1943, when a General Staff was\r\nformed within the guerrilla forces resisting the Italian occupation.\r\nPetrit Dume, its chief of staff in 1970, had commanded the People's Army\r\nfor about twenty years. He was second only to Balluku in the defense\r\nhierarchy and was also a candidate member of the Politburo of the Party\r\norganization. Enver Hoxha, first secretary of the Albanian Workers'\r\nParty, held the rank of general of the army until rank designations were\r\nabolished but, although he could exercise personal direction of the\r\narmed forces as their commander in chief, he was not considered a member\r\nof the defense establishment.\r\n\r\nAll of the regular military forces are within the People's Army. The air\r\nand naval arms are usually treated separately because of their\r\ndistinctive functions and equipment, but their men are sometimes\r\nreferred to as naval and air soldiers. Major subcommands, such as the\r\narmy's directorates of Political Affairs and Rear Services (Logistics),\r\nserve all service components. The same is the case with such\r\norganizations as the medical service that have functions applicable to\r\nall of the armed forces.\r\n\r\nAt lower levels, where the functions of the forces are specialized in\r\nrelation to their weapons, organizational patterns appear to be similar\r\nto those in most of the other armed forces throughout the Communist\r\nworld. During the post-World War II formative years, force structures\r\nwere adapted from those of the Soviet Union. Realignments after 1961 to\r\ncooperate with the Communist Chinese are not believed to have affected\r\nthem to any appreciable degree. Some unit designations, such as army\r\ndivision, are not used in the peacetime organization and, in other\r\nsituations, the sizes of units may be scaled down somewhat from normal\r\ninternational practice.\r\n\r\nRank designations were abolished in 1966. Since then, according to the\r\ngovernmental decree that effected the change, position in the military\r\nhierarchy is based on the responsibilities stipulated in the relevant\r\ntables of organization of the armed forces. Most of the personnel who\r\nwould have fallen into the lower rank categories are acquired by\r\nconscription. Men without highly skilled specialties are retained for\r\ntwo years; noncommissioned officers and others who receive special\r\ntraining are required to serve for longer periods.\r\n\r\nThe stated mission of the armed forces in general and the ground forces\r\nin particular is to defend the country and to secure its governing\r\nsystem. The stated mission notwithstanding, support of the system is\r\nprimarily the responsibility of the security police forces and, against\r\nan external opponent, the armed forces are believed to have only a\r\ndefensive capability. Unless Albanian forces engaged an enemy that was\r\nalso committed against a third party in a more general conflict, they\r\nwould, of necessity, revert to guerrilla fighting. Most of the training\r\nand much of the propaganda directed at the local population indicate\r\nthat the leadership anticipates the possibility of guerrilla warfare.\r\n\r\nThe Party slogan, \"the pick in one hand and the rifle in the other,\"\r\nalso illustrates the dual use of service personnel in peacetime. They\r\nassist in the construction of industrial enterprises and hydroelectric\r\nplants and in land reclamation projects, crop harvests, and the like.\r\nThey were used during the early 1960s, for example, in the construction\r\nof the oil refinery at Cerrik; in building a sugar factory, a lumber\r\ncombine, and a textile factory; and in the draining of Lake Maliq to\r\nacquire additional agricultural land in a marshy lake district area\r\nnorth of Korce (see ch. 8, Economic System).\r\n\r\n\r\nGround Forces\r\n\r\nThe ground forces contain about three-quarters of the regular personnel\r\nand are the backbone of the armed forces. Consequently, many of the\r\nPeople's Army functions that apply to all of the service components are\r\nadministered within the ground force organization.\r\n\r\nBecause the active personnel strength of the ground forces is around\r\n30,000--sufficient to man only about two divisions--the brigade has been\r\nchosen as the basic tactical unit. The brigades are manned with\r\napproximately 3,000 men each, and there are probably one tank and five\r\ninfantry brigades. The infantry brigades are believed to contain three\r\ninfantry battalions and a lightly equipped artillery regiment. The tank\r\nbrigade has Soviet-built weapons. Most of them are World War II T-34\r\nmedium tanks, but there are a few of the later model T-54s.\r\n\r\nAlmost all artillery is light and small caliber, since movement of\r\nheavy equipment is nearly impossible over much of the terrain. In\r\naddition, heavy weapons, their transport, or even their ammunition could\r\nnot be produced locally, and little resupply from external sources could\r\nbe expected in any lengthy conflict. In so small an area the rapid\r\nmovement of forces would serve little purpose. The minimal amount of\r\ntransport equipment available includes small numbers of Soviet-designed\r\narmored personnel carriers, command cars, and a few types of trucks.\r\n\r\nBefore 1961 training was based on Soviet methods, and specialized\r\nschools were scaled-down copies of those in the Soviet army. Training\r\nmanuals were translated from the Russian. Although external support of\r\nthe forces has been transferred from the Soviet Union to Communist\r\nChina, the Chinese have apparently not required basic changes in the\r\ntraining programs. Most conscripts have been exposed to a considerable\r\namount of drill and elementary basic training in school and in Communist\r\nyouth organizations, permitting the forces to concentrate on tactical\r\nexercises. These consist mostly of small unit activities and involve\r\nfighting techniques appropriate to the defense of the mountainous\r\ninterior. Physical conditioning, tactics involving light weapons, and\r\noperations using a minimum of materiel support are emphasized on a\r\ncontinuing basis. Political indoctrination, conducted or supervised by\r\nthe political commissars, is heavily administered in all training\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval Forces\r\n\r\nNaval units are subordinate to the Coastal Defense Command which,\r\nalthough a part of the People's Army, is operationally responsible\r\ndirectly to the Ministry of People's Defense. None of the pre-World War\r\nII navy survived the occupation and, as with the other branches of the\r\nservice, the navy forgets any earlier ancestry and celebrates August 15,\r\n1945, as its founding date. The senior naval officer is commander of\r\nnaval forces, a deputy commander of coastal defense, and deputy minister\r\nof defense for naval affairs. In late 1969 Ymer Zeqir held these\r\npositions. As deputy commander of coastal defense he coordinated naval\r\noperations with those of the air defense and ground forces that would\r\nparticipate in defense of the coastal area. As deputy minister of\r\ndefense he represented the naval forces in national defense planning and\r\ncoordinated personnel, logistic support, and matters that are common to\r\nother branches of the armed forces.\r\n\r\nNaval forces are divided into three commands: the Submarine Brigade, the\r\nVlore Sea Defense Brigade, and the Durres Sea Defense Brigade. All\r\ncombat ships are assigned to one of the three. The Submarine Brigade is\r\nbased at the Pasha Liman anchorages south of the city of Vlore, at the\r\nextreme southwestern point in the bay. Main facilities of the Vlore Sea\r\nDefense Brigade are located on the island of Sazan, in the mouth of the\r\nbay about ten miles west of Vlore. This was the site of the Soviet\r\nsubmarine base before 1961. The Durres Sea Defense Brigade controls the\r\nunits stationed at Durres and those that are locked within Lake Scutari.\r\nThe Buene River is navigable between Lake Scutari and the Adriatic, but\r\nonly the smallest of the ships in the lake can pass beneath the Shkoder\r\ncity bridges.\r\n\r\nThe officially stated mission of the naval forces is to provide for the\r\nmilitary security of coastal waters; to prevent smuggling; to prevent\r\nsubmarines from approaching the coast or harbors; to lay and sweep\r\nmines; to intercept enemy forces; to escort convoys along the coastline;\r\nand, together with police patrol boats, to control entries to, or exits\r\nfrom, the country. Original Soviet support for the navy was provided in\r\norder to secure a submarine and minelaying base with access to the\r\nMediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nForces available are considerably weaker than those of any one of the\r\npotential enemies and, with the exception of Vlore, Albanian harbors\r\nprovide little natural protection. It is therefore probable that the\r\nleadership thinks in terms of peacetime shore patrols and would hope, in\r\nwartime, to use what units they were able to preserve to prevent totally\r\nuninhibited use of the seas adjacent to the country.\r\n\r\nIn mid-1970 naval ships included three or four submarines, eight\r\nminesweepers, twelve motor torpedo boats, one or two oilers, and perhaps\r\ntwenty-five or thirty more ships, about one-half of which were classed\r\nas coastal patrol and one-half as auxiliary types. The submarines are\r\nobsolescent medium-range boats. Two of the minesweepers are oceangoing\r\nvessels; the other six can sweep harbors or inshore seas only. Most of\r\nthe miscellaneous vessels were formerly Italian, of World War II and\r\nearlier vintages. Albanian sources claim that a dozen newer torpedo\r\nboats have been supplied by the Chinese, six of them hydrofoil types.\r\n\r\nNaval personnel number approximately 3,000. Since many of the ships put\r\nto sea infrequently, many of the navy men do part-time fishing or\r\nagricultural work. Familiarity with ships helps a new conscript get a\r\nnaval assignment, and many of those drafted are from the vicinities of\r\nVlore or Durres and may serve their three years being only rarely out of\r\nsight of home. Their morale is only fair.\r\n\r\nOfficers are required to have a general education that includes at\r\nleast some university credits. They receive specialized courses before\r\ngoing to sea. Before 1961 most officers and some of the higher\r\nnoncommissioned officer ratings received some training in the Soviet\r\nUnion. Without this training or a Chinese substitute for it, there has\r\nprobably been some degradation in the technical capabilities of the\r\nofficer and noncommissioned officer personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nAir Force\r\n\r\nThe Albanian Air Force is the youngest of the service branches, founded\r\non April 23, 1951. As is the case with the navy, the air force is also a\r\npart of the People's Army, having organizational and logistic\r\nindividuality only insofar as its equipment is different and requires\r\ndifferent techniques and skills in its use. Arif Hasko, chief of the air\r\nforce in mid-1970, was also a deputy minister of defense and, as was the\r\ncase with his naval counterpart, advised on problems peculiar to his\r\nforce and coordinated on matters of general interest to all branches of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nAir defense artillery and missile units are usually included with the\r\nair force and account for about two-thirds of its 5,000 to 7,000\r\npersonnel. Air defense units received Soviet equipment between 1948 and\r\n1961, including that required at a few surface-to-air missile sites.\r\nTheir Guideline missiles were paraded in Tirana on Army Day of 1964 and\r\nhave been shown on occasion since. The original missiles supplied by the\r\nSoviets would have outlived their storage lifetimes by 1970. If a\r\nsurface-to-air missile capability did exist at that time, the Chinese\r\nwould have supplied the necessary replacements.\r\n\r\nAircraft in 1970 included sixty to seventy fighters and fighter-bombers\r\nand about the same number of transports, trainers, and miscellaneous\r\nnoncombat types. All were of Soviet design. Fighter-bombers or ground\r\nattack aircraft were the jet MiG-15s and MiG-17s provided by the Soviet\r\nUnion before 1961. Spare parts necessary to keep them operating since\r\nthen have been supplied by Communist China. MiG-19s for the air defense\r\ninterceptor role have also been furnished by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the 1970 force included four ground support\r\nsquadrons and probably two interceptor squadrons, with about ten or\r\ntwelve aircraft per squadron. Air-to-air missiles are an integral part\r\nof the MiG-19 armament and are presumably being furnished in small\r\nquantities by the Chinese. Transport squadrons contain a few\r\nSoviet-built piston-engined Il-14s and AN-2s, some Soviet-built\r\nhelicopters, and possibly a few helicopters built by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe five principal airbases are located near Tirana, Shijak (about\r\ntwenty miles west of Tirana), Vlore, Sazan Island (at the mouth of Vlore\r\nBay), and at Stalin (about forty miles south of Tirana). The base on\r\nSazan Island that was built and used by the Russians has been used\r\nintermittently, if at all, since the Russians evacuated it in 1961.\r\nHelicopter bases have been, or are being, constructed at several inland\r\ncities as well as at Tirana, Shkoder, and as a part of the major base at\r\nVlore. The forces had no surface-to-surface missile capability in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe missions assigned to the combat elements of the air force are to\r\nrepel an enemy at the borders and to prevent the violation of Albanian\r\nairspace. Because the force is small, could not easily be resupplied,\r\nhas exposed bases, and possesses no appreciable area to retreat into,\r\nhowever, it could not be expected to contribute significantly to any\r\nsustained combat effort. It serves mainly to provide the regime with\r\nostensive evidence of its power and technological progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nMobilization Potential\r\n\r\nIn the event of total mobilization there are just under 500,000 males\r\nbetween the ages of fifteen and fifty. Of the total group approximately\r\n75 percent, or nearly 375,000, are physically fit. More than half of\r\nthese have had some military service, and a sizable group participates\r\nin military reserve activities (see ch. 4, The People).\r\n\r\nInformation as to how the existing establishment would be expanded is\r\nnot available. Units active in 1970 could be enlarged to about double\r\ntheir peacetime strengths because all units are usually maintained at\r\nconsiderably below combat readiness strengths. New units would probably\r\nbe created in infantry or guerrilla forces. Additional tank, air, and\r\nnaval units would require more of their special equipment before they\r\ncould become operational. Some women probably would be mobilized. The\r\nnational economy, however, could not provide logistic support for the\r\nnumber of male personnel available, and external support would be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical Indoctrination\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Communist takeover in 1944 and in the years\r\nimmediately thereafter, political commissars were an integral part of\r\nthe military organization. They were considered essential in order to\r\nassure that ideological beliefs were constant and were adhered to\r\nwithout deviation. As the years passed they lost their early importance\r\nand were eventually done away with, but they were reinstated in 1966\r\nwhen alignment with Communist China brought renewed revolutionary\r\nfervor.\r\n\r\nHow much their organization and operations in 1970 differed from what\r\nthey were in 1944 is not clearly understood, but the fact that they were\r\nstill called political commissars was a strong indication that they\r\nperformed basically the same functions. There is no question but that\r\nthe justification for their existence was the same--that is, to ensure\r\nthat the ideological and political orientation of the troops and of\r\ntheir leaders did not deviate from the Party line. The decree that\r\nreinstated the commissars stated that they would be assigned in all\r\nunits, subunits, and military establishments. This presumably means that\r\nthere are commissars in all base organizations and in tactical units\r\ndown at least to the company level.\r\n\r\nIt is also known that Political Directorates in both the Ministry of\r\nPeople's Defense and the Ministry of the Interior control the commissars\r\nin the armed forces and the security forces, respectively. Political\r\ncommissars are carefully selected from the standpoint of ideological\r\nreliability. Those appointed since 1966 must have had five years of\r\nunblemished Party membership. Those in the armed forces who are attached\r\nto the lower levels of the organizational structure are responsible to\r\nthe Political Directorate and the Party organization rather than to\r\nsuperior officers within the military command channels. Hito Cako was\r\nchief of the People's Army Political Directorate in 1970.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the military court system, discipline is enforced as part\r\nof the educational and ideological training program by the political\r\nworkers who act in conjunction with the Party organizations in service\r\nunits. They are invited to take measures necessary against individuals\r\nwhose attitude or conduct is considered harmful to the effectiveness of,\r\nor discipline within, the army.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary Schools\r\n\r\nOther than those that are set up for specialized training, there are\r\nthree military schools providing curricula aimed at producing officer\r\npersonnel or offering advanced military theory. The Skanderbeg military\r\nschool is a secondary or preparatory school. It is attended by children\r\nof top Party, government, and military leaders and prepares them for\r\nentrance into the Enver Hoxha United Army Officers School. The Hoxha\r\nschool is the oldest military educational institution in the country. It\r\nstarted a formal curriculum in 1945 but, according to Party claims, was\r\nin operation before the World War II occupation forces left the country\r\nin 1944. It is the military academy that provides a university level\r\ncurriculum and whose students become commissioned officers upon\r\ngraduation.\r\n\r\nThe Mehmet Shehu Military Academy is named for the man who in 1970 was\r\npremier (chairman of the Council of Ministers) and also a member of the\r\nParty Politburo. Shehu was a lieutenant general before 1966 and was\r\nconsidered one of the country's most capable military leaders. The\r\nacademy is the advanced military institution that offers career training\r\nequivalent to that of command and staff or war college institutions in\r\nWestern military establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary Medicine\r\n\r\nThe medical services were organized during the 1950s along the lines of\r\nthose in the Soviet and East European Communist forces in order to\r\nfacilitate cooperation among them. Although there has been no such\r\ncooperation since 1961, the basic organization was unchanged in 1963 and\r\nprobably remained basically the same in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe head of the medical establishment has the title of chief, Albanian\r\nArmed Forces Medical Service. He is responsible to the chief of the Rear\r\nServices, which is one of the unified directorates directly beneath the\r\nMinistry of People's Defense. Naval, air force, and ground force staffs\r\nare responsible to him, but the naval and air force groups appear to\r\nhave a largely advisory capacity, except as they work to secure the\r\nservices required by their branches of the service. The hospital,\r\npharmaceutical, and personnel sections, however, are operated by the\r\ndeputy chief of medical services, who is also head of the ground forces'\r\nmedical department.\r\n\r\nAlbanian sources state that there is close cooperation between the\r\nmilitary medical service and the Ministry of Health. The forces' medical\r\npersonnel, facilities, equipment, and medicines have been used to\r\nimprove sanitary and medical conditions in less developed areas and to\r\nprovide assistance in flood, earthquake, and other emergency situations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecorations\r\n\r\nRecognition for high standards of conduct, exceptional effort, or\r\nnoteworthy accomplishment is bestowed lavishly. Highly prized\r\ndecorations include the Partisan Star, Order of the Albanian Flag, Order\r\nof the National Hero, and Order of Skanderbeg. Other decorations that\r\nare worn by a few of the highest military and Party officials include\r\nthe Memorial Medal, the Order of Liberty (or Order of Freedom), the\r\nLiberation Medal, Order of the People's Hero (or Hero of the People),\r\nand Order of Valor. Some of the decorations, including the Partisan Star\r\nand Order of Skanderbeg, are awarded in three classes. This group of\r\ndecorations is usually awarded individually, but on rare occasions some\r\ncan be presented to a group.\r\n\r\nThe Order of Labor (or Hero of Socialist Labor) and the Red Flag Order\r\n(or Red Banner) may be presented to individuals, usually civilians, but\r\nare most frequently reported when awarded to a group or an enterprise.\r\nTypical recipients would be a factory for overfulfilling its quotas, a\r\nship after completing an unusual voyage, or a military unit that had\r\nperformed well in some civic project or in an emergency relief\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\nParamilitary Training\r\n\r\nIn November 1944, when partisan resistance forces were at their peak\r\nstrength of about 70,000, about 6,000 of them were women and 1,000 were\r\nboys under fifteen years of age. Formal paramilitary training was\r\nundertaken in 1945, shortly after the Hoxha regime gained control, and\r\nwas made obligatory for all young people in 1953. Training has been\r\ndeveloped to the point that fifteen- to nineteen-year-old youths can be\r\norganized into their own auxiliary units in emergencies.\r\n\r\nMajor revisions to the secondary school and university military training\r\nprograms were announced in 1969 in preparation for implementation during\r\nthe ensuing school year. The extent of training, what it would include,\r\nand aims of the new program were given wide publicity throughout 1969 in\r\norder to ease the transition. The purpose of the programs is to provide\r\nthe armed forces with conscripts who are in good physical condition and\r\nwho have sufficient basic military training to permit them to step\r\ndirectly into a military unit and perform usefully with a minimum of\r\nadjustment and little additional training.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1970 the secondary school year was to consist of 6-½\r\nmonths of academic work, 2-½ months of physical work in agriculture or\r\nindustry, 1 month of military training, and 2 months of relaxation.\r\nAccording to official guidance, however, the youths are encouraged to\r\nuse their relaxation period for \"ideological and physical steeling.\" The\r\nuniversity year would consist of 7 months of academic work, 2 months of\r\nmilitary training, 1 month of physical work, and 2 months of ideological\r\nand physical steeling.\r\n\r\nPhysical training of the type that contributes most to future military\r\nservice is encouraged. Specific goals to be derived from it are basic\r\nphysical improvement in speed, agility, strength, and resistance and the\r\nmoral attributes of bravery, strong will, and personal discipline. Light\r\nsports, such as volleyball, are discouraged. Track, wrestling, and body\r\ncontact sports are advised. Swimming and skiing are also considered to\r\nhave military applications. It is recommended that calisthenics and\r\nphysical culture activities be carried on in large groups.\r\n\r\nMilitary instruction includes close order drill, crawling and obstacle\r\npenetration, storming techniques, and hand-to-hand combat. Academic\r\ncourses in the military area train in the care and use of various types\r\nof weapons, the theories of military art, and the techniques of\r\nconventional and guerrilla warfare. Schools organize marches and\r\nexcursions that are combined with tactical military exercises to give\r\nthem a wholly military character. Most of these are designed to teach\r\nguerrilla warfare tactics. Overnight stalking exercises feature searches\r\nfor intruder groups, a simulated target demolition, or some such\r\nobjective. Girls as well as boys are required to participate. Tirana\r\npress photographs have shown some groups of girls engaged in mortar\r\ntraining, others in target shooting. In the 1969 Tirana May Day parade\r\ngirls, in ranks of fifteen abreast, carried submachineguns.\r\n\r\nWhen the programs have been completely implemented, students in the\r\nfirst and second years of secondary schooling will receive all of their\r\nphysical and military training at their schools. It will be supervised\r\nby teachers and military officers assigned to the schools. Third- and\r\nfourth-year students will have part of the training at their schools,\r\nbut with entire day or week periods devoted to the program. They will\r\nalso spend a part of the allocated month in military units to which the\r\nschool is attached for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFacilities are not adequate in many schools, and in many areas military\r\nunits are not immediately available to assist in training. It will be\r\nseveral years before the complete revised programs can be implemented.\r\nThe first year's effort, however, involves about 10,000 university\r\nstudents and about 170,000 other people. The latter figure includes\r\nschoolteachers, military personnel who cooperate in the training, and\r\nothers who provide miscellaneous voluntary or part-time assistance, in\r\naddition to those who receive the training. Students in the program have\r\nbeen compared with those in the Communist Chinese Red Guard, but the\r\norganization of the Albanian program is designed to keep it closely\r\naligned with the school curriculum and with active military units to\r\nprevent large-scale independent action by youth groups.\r\n\r\nParamilitary programs of Party-sponsored youth organizations are similar\r\nin many ways to those in the school system. Pioneers take children, both\r\nboys and girls, between the ages of seven and fourteen. A group of these\r\nyoung Pioneers carried rifles and submachineguns in the 1968 Tirana May\r\nDay parade. From ages fifteen to twenty-five they may belong to the\r\nUnion of Albanian Working Youth, frequently called the Communist Youth\r\nMovement. The Union of Albanian Working Youth had 210,000 members in\r\n1967. Nearly all personnel drafted into the armed forces fall within the\r\nyouth movement's age brackets, and its units within the services are\r\nactive. Political and ideological indoctrination is intensive in these\r\norganizations and prepares the youth for possible membership in the\r\nParty in later years (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political\r\nSystem).\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary Justice\r\n\r\nThere is no distinction between the civil judicial order in general and\r\nthe military order in particular, but military crimes are treated in a\r\nseparate chapter of the penal code. That chapter treats those acts,\r\ncommitted by persons under the jurisdiction of military courts, that are\r\ndirected against military discipline, military orders, and the like.\r\nThey include a broad variety of violations against persons, property, or\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nA military crime, in the Albanian system, has two characteristics\r\ndistinguishing it from nonmilitary crimes. The crime is committed\r\nagainst regulations established for the performance of military service,\r\nand the defendant is a member of the armed forces. For criminal justice\r\nthe security forces under the Ministry of the Interior and all local\r\npolice are considered armed forces and are subject to military law and\r\nto trial in military courts, as are reservists or persons called to\r\nmilitary or police duty for short periods. Also, military violations are\r\nbelieved to include a variety of crimes against the state that might not\r\nbe classed as military in Western countries, including some in the\r\nso-called socially dangerous category. As is the case in the Soviet\r\nUnion, persons who fail to report on others committing crimes are\r\nthemselves liable.\r\n\r\nMilitary courts are selected by the People's Assembly or by its\r\nPresidium when it is not in session. Members are military personnel and\r\nordinarily serve on a court for three years. Each court has a chairman,\r\nvice chairman, and a number of members called assistant judges. The\r\nchairman and at least one of the assistant judges must be military\r\nsuperiors of the defendant.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional circumstances the People's Assembly may appoint a special\r\ncourt for a particular case or a group of cases. A special court may be\r\nall or only partially military. Such a court was appointed, for example,\r\nwhen Vice Admiral Teme Seyko, commander of the naval forces, was accused\r\nin 1961 of \"having been in league with the imperialist Americans, Greek\r\nmonarcho-fascists and Yugoslav revisionists.\" The admiral was executed.\r\n\r\nWhen crimes are committed during military operations, sentences are\r\nheavier than when the same offenses are committed under conditions where\r\nduress is not a factor. During combat or wartime circumstances,\r\nlegislative acts call for the most severe penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY\r\n\r\nAccording to official government pronouncements relating to the state\r\nbudget, 471 million leks (5 leks equal US$1) were appropriated for\r\ndefense expenditures in 1970. That amount is 9.2 percent of the total\r\nplanned expenditures of 5,110 million leks, or about 225 leks per\r\ninhabitant during the year. Whether or not all expenses that would fall\r\nwithin the defense category in Western countries are included in these\r\nfigures is not known. It is the practice in some Communist governments\r\nto distribute peripheral defense costs among other agency appropriations\r\n(see ch. 8, Economic System).\r\n\r\nThe defense budget was increased drastically in 1969 and 1970 over the\r\nlevels of earlier years, apparently in reaction to the Soviet invasion\r\nof Czechoslovakia. The midyear calculated expenditures for 1969\r\nrepresented an increase of about 38 percent over those of 1968, and 1970\r\nprojections showed another 12.2 percent anticipated increase over 1969.\r\n\r\nThe burden represented by 225 leks per person can be illustrated by\r\nrelating it to income and costs of living. In 1967, for example, a\r\ntypical head of family worker earned about 7,200 leks per year. The\r\naverage family group consisted of between five and six persons, and\r\nabout 90 percent of its earnings was required for food and housing. In\r\nthe preponderant majority of situations where there was only one wage\r\nearner per family, therefore, per capita defense costs exceeded\r\neverything that the family had available for all uses except food and\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nThe 50,000 men in the regular and security forces represent about 2.4\r\npercent of the population, but each annual draft takes a number that is\r\nequal to roughly one-half of the young men that become nineteen years\r\nold during the year. There is no reliable information as to how\r\nwillingly the average citizen performs his military service or whether\r\nor not his contribution is appreciated by the remainder of the people.\r\nThe controlled-communications media do everything possible to promote\r\ngood morale among those in the service and to show that the public\r\nsupports them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN MILITARY RELATIONS\r\n\r\nSmall, underdeveloped, and suffering continually from an unfavorable\r\nbalance of trade, Albania has always needed assistance to maintain even\r\na small military force. Accepting aid from Italy before World War II\r\nresulted in a severe curtailment of national initiative in the\r\nemployment of the forces and probably contributed to their immobility at\r\nthe time of the Italian invasion in 1939.\r\n\r\nBetween 1945 and 1948 Yugoslavia's control over Albania's forces was\r\ntighter than Italy's had been. In addition to technical advisers and\r\ninstructors in regular service units, the Communist Party organization\r\nprovided an effective vehicle for controlling the reliability of\r\npersonnel, particularly the military leadership.\r\n\r\nBecause the Soviet Union, like Italy, was physically separated from the\r\ncountry it was a more desirable ally than neighboring Yugoslavia had\r\nbeen. It was nonetheless able to maintain tighter controls over Albanian\r\nforces than either Yugoslavia or Italy had achieved. General Petrit\r\nDume, who was commander of the People's Army during its dependence on\r\nthe Soviet Union and still was in 1970, had said in November of 1952\r\nthat his force was an integral part of the Soviet Army.\r\n\r\nAlbania became one of the original Warsaw Treaty Organization members in\r\n1955. Separated from the other signatories, its forces were unable to\r\nparticipate in the pact's field exercises and after 1961, because of its\r\nrift with the Soviet Union, was not invited to attend the organization's\r\nmeetings. In 1968, protesting the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia,\r\nAlbania formally withdrew from the pact.\r\n\r\nCommunist China was Albania's only military ally in 1970. In 1970 the\r\nChinese were believed to be enabling Albania to maintain its forces at\r\napproximately the same levels that had been reached by 1960 with Soviet\r\nassistance (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURITY FORCES\r\n\r\nAlbanian sources publish little concerning the security police except\r\nfor some articles expressing gratitude for their services and a\r\nsmattering of information relative to their responsibilities. Few of the\r\nobservers who have visited the country since 1945 have been in positions\r\nto see, or have been qualified to judge, their actual performance. It is\r\nundoubtedly true that the Albanian leadership emulated many of Joseph\r\nStalin's techniques for controlling the population, that it modified its\r\nattitudes and practices less than did the other East European Communist\r\ncountries after Stalin's death, and that it has maintained a high degree\r\nof Stalinism since its break with the Soviet Union and alignment with\r\nCommunist China (see ch. 6, Government Structure and Political System).\r\n\r\nThere is probably credibility in reports stating that no other Communist\r\ncountry has as extensive a police and security organization relative to\r\nits size as that which operates in Albania. Hoxha has regarded the\r\nsecurity police as an elite group, and they have been the mainstay of\r\nhis power. By 1961, although arrests had tapered off from earlier\r\nlevels, fourteen concentration or labor camps were still in use. Foreign\r\nvisitors in Tirana have reported that it is impossible to move around\r\nthe city without escorts and that conversations with ordinary citizens\r\nare discouraged. Local police, servicemen, and security police are in\r\nevidence everywhere.\r\n\r\nAll security and police forces were responsible in the governmental\r\nstructure to the Ministry of the Interior. The minister in 1970 was\r\nKadri Hasbiu. Each organization--the Directorate of State Security, the\r\nPeople's Police, and the Frontier Guards--constituted a separate\r\ndirectorate of the ministry. The total regular uniformed security\r\npersonnel numbered approximately 12,500. This figure did not include the\r\nplainclothes security police, informers, or the citizens who were\r\nperforming their two months of mandatory auxiliary duty attached to\r\nlocal police units.\r\n\r\nA larger proportion of personnel in the security forces are Party\r\nmembers than is the case in the regular military forces. In the state\r\nsecurity organization, nearly all of those who serve in important\r\npositions are believed to be Party members. In the Frontier Guards the\r\nofficers and many of the men are Party members.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Directorate of State Security\r\n\r\nThe Directorate of State Security (Drejtorija e Sigurimit te\r\nShtetit--commonly abbreviated to Sigurimi) is organized into four\r\nbattalions and has more plainclothes personnel than uniformed. It\r\ncelebrates March 20, 1943, as its founding day and is credited by Hoxha\r\nand others of the Party leadership as having been instrumental in the\r\nvictory of his faction of the partisan effort. Actually the People's\r\nDefense Division, from which the Sigurimi evolved, was formed in 1945.\r\nComposed at that time of some 5,000 of the most reliable of the\r\nresistance fighters, it was headed initially by Koci Xoxe, who was\r\nexecuted as a Titoist four years later. Mihalaq Zicishti was its chief\r\nin 1970.\r\n\r\nThe stated missions of the security police are to prevent\r\ncounterrevolution and to eliminate opposition to the Party and\r\ngovernment. Its interests are directed toward political and ideological\r\nopposition rather than crimes against persons or property unless such\r\ncrimes appear to have national implications.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1950s the Sigurimi had seven sections: political,\r\ncensorship, public records, prison camp, two sections for\r\ncounterespionage, and a foreign service. The political section's primary\r\nfunction was the penetration of opposition political factions. One of\r\nthe counterespionage sections was specialized and had only a\r\nresponsibility for eliminating underground organizations. The censorship\r\nsection operated not only with the press, radio, publications, and other\r\ncommunications media but with cultural societies, schools, and\r\nschoolteachers. The public records section was also charged with\r\nideological supervision of economic agencies.\r\n\r\nSigurimi personnel at labor camps attended to the political reeducation\r\nof the inmates and evaluated the degree to which they remained socially\r\ndangerous; camp guards were local police. The foreign service section\r\nplaced its personnel as widely as possible in order to maintain contact\r\nwith aliens or foreigners in the country and in diplomatic and visiting\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nSigurimi personnel may be conscripts called during the annual draft or\r\nmay be career volunteers. Personnel are screened, and the conditions of\r\nservice are made sufficiently attractive to secure as reliable and\r\ndedicated men as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrontier Guards\r\n\r\nThe Frontier Guards are organized into five battalions. Individual units\r\nare manned with fewer personnel than Sigurimi battalions, however, and\r\nthe total strength of the force is lower. Although the force is\r\norganized strictly along military lines, it is under the Ministry of the\r\nInterior and is more closely associated with the security police than\r\nwith the regular armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe stated mission of the Frontier Guards is to protect the State's\r\nborders and to take action against spies, criminals, smugglers, and\r\ninfiltrators along the boundaries. In the process they also prevent\r\nAlbanians from leaving the country.\r\n\r\nFrontier Guards personnel, like those of the Sigurimi, may be acquired\r\nduring the annual conscription. Career personnel are often those who\r\nhave served tours in the regular services. A guards' school was\r\nestablished in 1953 in Tirana. Its students, as well as others allowed\r\nin the force, are carefully screened for political reliability.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople's Police\r\n\r\nThe People's Police has five branches--the Police for Economic\r\nObjectives, Communications Police, Fire Police, Detention Police, and\r\nGeneral Police. The Police for Economic Objectives serve as guards for\r\nstate buildings, factories, construction projects, and similar\r\nenterprises. Communications Police guard bridges, railways, and wire\r\nlines. Firefighting is a police function, accomplished by the Fire\r\nPolice. Detention Police are prison and camp guards. The fifth branch,\r\nthe General Police, attend to traffic regulation, local crime, and other\r\nduties usually performed by local or municipal police.\r\n\r\nGeneral Police functions overlap those of the security police to some\r\nextent, but the force operates in the local, as opposed to the national,\r\nenvironment. Headquarters in the larger towns have security sections\r\nthat maintain records on suspected anti-Communists, an alien section\r\nthat maintains contact with Albanians outside their own districts as\r\nwell as aliens, and a political commissar who is so placed as to assure\r\nthe proper political orientation of all other personnel.\r\n\r\nCitizens are required to carry identification cards. These contain\r\nfamily and employment data and, as they are needed even for intervillage\r\ntravel, constitute an effective control over movement of the population.\r\n\r\nMinimum service on the police force is for three years. Individuals with\r\nearlier service in the armed forces, security police, or Frontier Guards\r\nare preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuxiliary Police\r\n\r\nA 1948 law requires that all able-bodied men serve two months assisting\r\nthe local police. They perform with the regular People's Police of their\r\nlocalities, wear the police uniform made distinguishable only by a red\r\narmband, and serve without pay. The auxiliary police program serves a\r\ndual purpose. It provides additional help for the police forces. Of more\r\noverall value, it gives a sizable portion of the population some\r\nfamiliarity with, and presumably a more sympathetic understanding of,\r\npolice activities and problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED SOURCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Albania: First Atheist State in the World,\" _Radio Free Europe Research\r\nDepartments: Communist Area_, October 1967, 1-3.\r\n\r\n_Albania: Geographical, Historical and Economic Data._ Tirana: Naim\r\nFrasheri State Publishing House, 1964.\r\n\r\nAlbanian Historical Society of Massachusetts. _The Albanian Struggle in\r\nthe Old World and New._ (Works Progress Administration Series.)
