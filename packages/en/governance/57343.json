In earlier days the colonization of the Negro, as in\r\nLiberia, was put forward as a solution. That idea was abandoned long ago.\r\nIt is now recognized generally that the two races are here in America\r\nto stay.\r\n\r\nIt is also certain that the problem will not be solved by methods of\r\nviolence. Every race riot, every instance in which men of either race\r\ndefy legal authority and take the law into their own hands, but postpones\r\nthe day when the two races shall live together amicably. The law must\r\nbe maintained and enforced vigorously and completely before any real\r\nprogress can be made towards better race relations.\r\n\r\nMeans must be found, therefore, whereby the two races can live together on\r\nterms of amity. This will be possible only if the two races are brought\r\nto understand each other better. It is believed that such understanding\r\nwill result in each having a higher degree of respect for the other,\r\nand that such respect will form the basis for greatly improved relations\r\nbetween the races.\r\n\r\nThe Commission on Race Relations, composed of distinguished\r\nrepresentatives of both races, has made the most thorough and complete\r\nsurvey of the race situation that I have seen anywhere. While its field\r\nof study was necessarily limited to Chicago, the conditions there may\r\nbe regarded as fairly typical of conditions in other large cities where\r\nthere is a large colored population.\r\n\r\nThe report does not pretend to have discovered any new formula by which\r\nall race trouble will disappear. The subject is too complex for any such\r\nsimple solution. It finds certain facts, however, the mere recognition\r\nof which will go a long way towards allaying race feeling. It finds that\r\nin that portion of Chicago in which colored persons have lived longest\r\nand in the largest numbers relatively there has been the minimum of\r\nfriction. This is a fact of the first importance. For it tends to show\r\nthat the presence of Negroes in large numbers in our great cities is\r\nnot a menace in itself.\r\n\r\nThere is one recommendation (No. 31) to which I desire to call special\r\nattention: that a permanent local commission on race relations be created.\r\nWhen as Governor of Illinois I withdrew troops from Chicago after the\r\nriots, I was not at all persuaded that all danger of their recurrence\r\nwas past. I kept observers from the Adjutant General's office on the\r\nground to watch for any signs of fresh trouble. The Commission on Race\r\nRelations was appointed, and conditions at once began to improve. The\r\nactivities of this Commission, composed of the best representatives of\r\nboth races, were, as I believe, the principal cause for this improved\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nCauses of friction, insignificant in themselves, but capable of leading to\r\nserious results, were discovered by the Commission and by its suggestion\r\nwere removed in time to avoid grave consequences. Gross exaggerations\r\nof some fancied grievance by either the one race or the other were\r\nexamined into and were found to rest upon nothing else than idle rumor\r\nor prejudice. In the light of truth which the Commission was able to\r\nthrow upon the subject, these grievances disappeared. In other words,\r\nmisunderstanding, which had been so prolific a source of trouble between\r\nthe races, was greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe report contains recommendations, which, if acted upon, will make\r\nimpossible, in my opinion, a repetition of the appalling tragedy which\r\nbrought disgrace to Chicago in July of 1919.\r\n\r\nMen may differ as to some of the conclusions reached, but all fair-minded\r\nmen must admit, I think, that the report of the Commission on Race\r\nRelations is a most important contribution to this important subject.\r\n\r\n     FRANK O. LOWDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, July 27, 1919, there was a clash of white people and Negroes\r\nat a bathing-beach in Chicago, which resulted in the drowning of a\r\nNegro boy. This led to a race riot in which thirty-eight lives were\r\nlost--twenty-three Negroes and fifteen whites--and 537 persons were\r\ninjured. After three days of mob violence, affecting several sections\r\nof the city, the state militia was called out to assist the police in\r\nrestoring order. It was not until August 6 that danger of further clashes\r\nwas regarded as past.\r\n\r\nTo discuss this serious situation and means of preventing its recurrence,\r\na group of eighty-one citizens, representing forty-eight social, civic,\r\ncommercial, and professional organizations of Chicago, met on August 1,\r\n1919, at the Union League Club. Mr. Charles W. Folds, president of the\r\nClub, presided. Brief addresses were made by Mr. H. H. Merrick, president\r\nof the Chicago Association of Commerce, Dr. Graham Taylor, Miss Harriet\r\nVittum, Major John S. Bonner, Mr. Charles J. Boyd, and Rev. William C.\r\nCovert.\r\n\r\nResolutions were passed and given to the press, and the following letter\r\nto the Governor of Illinois was authorized:\r\n\r\n     _To His Excellency, Frank O. Lowden_\r\n     _Governor of Illinois_\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR: A meeting was held today at the Union League Club\r\n     to take up the matter of the present race riots.\r\n\r\n     This meeting was attended by 81 representatives of 48 prominent\r\n     civic, professional and commercial organizations, such as\r\n     Chicago Medical Association, Chicago Bar Association, Federation\r\n     of Churches, Association of Commerce, Packing House Industries,\r\n     Urban League, Woman's City Club, Chicago Woman's Club, Foreign\r\n     Language Division, representing foreign-born population, etc.\r\n\r\n     A resolution was adopted unanimously, appointing the undersigned\r\n     as a committee to wait upon you and ask that you appoint at\r\n     your earliest convenience an emergency state committee to study\r\n     the psychological, social and economic causes underlying the\r\n     conditions resulting in the present race riot and to make such\r\n     recommendations as will tend to prevent a recurrence of such\r\n     conditions in the future.\r\n\r\n     The committee would welcome an opportunity to meet you at any\r\n     time convenient to yourself and to talk over with you details\r\n     and give you such information as has been gathered through\r\n     these various organizations.\r\n\r\n         Respectfully,\r\n\r\n             CHARLES W. FOLDS\r\n             GRAHAM TAYLOR\r\n             WILLIAM C. GRAVES\r\n             HARRIET E. VITTUM\r\n             T. ARNOLD HILL\r\n             FELIX J. STREYCKMANS\r\n\r\nIn response to this and other urgent requests by various citizens and\r\norganizations, and pursuant to his personal knowledge of the situation\r\nderived from investigations made by him in Chicago during the period of\r\nthe riot, Governor Lowden announced on August 20, 1919, the appointment\r\nof a Commission on Race Relations, consisting of twelve members, six from\r\neach race, as follows--Mr. Bancroft being designated by him as chairman:\r\n\r\nRepresenting the white people: Edgar A. Bancroft, William Scott Bond,\r\nEdward Osgood Brown, Harry Eugene Kelly, Victor F. Lawson, Julius\r\nRosenwald.\r\n\r\nRepresenting the Negro people: Robert S. Abbott, George Cleveland Hall,\r\nGeorge H. Jackson, Edward H. Morris, Adelbert H. Roberts, Lacey Kirk\r\nWilliams.[1]\r\n\r\nIn announcing the appointment of this Commission, Governor Lowden made\r\npublic the following statement:\r\n\r\n     I have been requested by many citizens and by many civic\r\n     organizations in Chicago to appoint a Commission to study\r\n     and report upon the broad question of the relations between\r\n     the two races. These riots were the work of the worst element\r\n     of both races. They did not represent the great overwhelming\r\n     majority of either race. The two are here and will remain here.\r\n     The great majority of each realizes the necessity of their\r\n     living upon terms of cordial good will and respect, each for\r\n     the other. That condition must be brought about.\r\n\r\n     To say that we cannot solve this problem is to confess the\r\n     failure of self-government. I offer no solution of the problem.\r\n     I do know, however, that the question cannot be answered by\r\n     mob violence. I do know that every time men, white or colored,\r\n     take the law into their own hands, instead of helping they\r\n     only postpone the settlement of the question. When we admit\r\n     the existence of a problem and courageously face it, we have\r\n     gone half-way toward its solution.\r\n\r\n     I have with the utmost care, in response to the requests above\r\n     set forth, appointed a Commission to undertake this great\r\n     work. I have sought only the most representative men of the\r\n     two races. I have not even asked them whether they had views\r\n     as to how the question could be met. I have asked them only\r\n     to approach the difficult subject with an open mind, and in\r\n     a spirit of fairness and justice to all. This is a tribunal\r\n     that has been constituted to get the facts and interpret them\r\n     and to find a way out. I believe that great good can come out\r\n     of the work of this Commission.\r\n\r\n     I ask that our people, white and colored, give their fullest\r\n     co-operation to the Commission. I ask, too, as I have a right to\r\n     ask, that both races exercise that patience and self-restraint\r\n     which are indispensable to self-government while we are working\r\n     out this problem.\r\n\r\nDuring an absence of the chairman, due to ill health, Governor Lowden\r\nrequested Dr. Francis W. Shepardson, director of the State Department\r\nof Registration and Education, to serve as acting chairman. On Mr.\r\nBancroft's return and at the Commission's request, the Governor appointed\r\nDr. Shepardson a member and vice-chairman of the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Commission's first meeting was held on October 9, 1919. Nine other\r\nmeetings were held during the remainder of that year to canvass the\r\npossible fields of inquiry, and to provide for the organization of\r\nstudies and investigations.\r\n\r\nThe Commission was seriously handicapped at the outset by a complete\r\nlack of funds. The legislative session of 1919 had ended before the riot,\r\nand the next regular session was not to convene until January, 1921. The\r\nCommission felt that it could not with propriety seek to raise funds on\r\nits own appeal. To meet this situation a group of citizens offered to\r\nserve as a co-operating committee to finance the Commission's inquiry and\r\nthe preparation and publication of its report. This Committee, consisting\r\nof Messrs. James B. Forgan, chairman, Abel Davis, treasurer, Arthur\r\nMeeker, John J. Mitchell, and John G. Shedd, gave effective aid, being\r\nmost actively assisted by Messrs. R. B. Beach and John F. Bowman, of the\r\nstaff of the Chicago Association of Commerce. Without the co-operation of\r\nthese gentlemen and the resulting financial assistance of many generous\r\ncontributors the Commission could not have carried on its work. It here\r\nexpresses its most grateful appreciation.\r\n\r\nThe Commission organized its staff, inviting Mr. Graham Romeyn Taylor, as\r\nexecutive secretary, and Mr. Charles S. Johnson, as associate executive\r\nsecretary, to assume charge of the inquiries and investigations under\r\nits direction. They began their work on December 7, 1919.\r\n\r\nWhile the Commission recognized the importance of studying the facts of\r\nthe riot, it felt that even greater emphasis should be placed on the\r\nstudy and interpretation of the conditions of Negro life in Chicago\r\nand of the relations between the two races. Therefore, after a brief\r\nsurvey of the data already collected and of the broad field for its\r\ninquiries, it organized into six committees, as follows: Committee on\r\nRacial Clashes, Committee on Housing, Committee on Industry, Committee\r\non Crime, Committee on Racial Contacts, Committee on Public Opinion.\r\n\r\nAlong all these lines of inquiry information was sought in two general\r\nways: through a series of conferences or informal hearings, and through\r\nresearch and field work carried on by a staff of trained investigators,\r\nwhite and Negro. Thus both races were represented in the membership of\r\nthe Commission, in its executive secretaries, and in the field and office\r\nstaff organized by the executive secretaries.\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance that in securing office quarters the\r\nCommission found several agents of buildings who declined to make a\r\nlease when they learned that Negroes as well as whites were among the\r\nprospective tenants. They stated their objections as based, not upon\r\ntheir own prejudices, but upon the fear that other tenants would resent\r\nthe presence of Negroes. Office space at 118 North La Salle Street was\r\nleased to the Commission by the L. J. McCormick estate, beginning February\r\n1, 1920. When these offices were vacated, May 1, 1921, the agents of\r\nthe estate informed the Commission that no tenant of the building had\r\ncomplained of the presence of Negroes.\r\n\r\nBy March 1, 1920, the staff of investigators had been organized and\r\nwas at work. The personnel was recruited as far as possible from social\r\nworkers of both races whose training and experience had fitted them for\r\nintelligent and sympathetic handling of research and field work along\r\nthe lines mapped out by the Commission.[2]\r\n\r\nThe period of investigations and conferences or informal hearings lasted\r\nuntil November, 1920. The work of compiling material and writing the\r\nvarious sections of the report had begun in October, 1920. Including its\r\nbusiness meetings and thirty conferences the Commission held more than\r\nseventy-five meetings; forty of these were devoted to the consideration\r\nof the text of the report.\r\n\r\nThe executive secretaries with their staff collected the materials\r\nduring 1920, and soon after presented the first draft of a report. This\r\nwas considered and discussed by the Commission in numerous sessions,\r\nand the general outlines of the report were decided upon. Then a second\r\ndraft, in accordance with its directions, was prepared by subjects, and\r\na copy was submitted to each member of the Commission for suggestions\r\nand criticisms. Afterward the Commission met and discussed the questions\r\nraised by the different members, and determined upon the changes to\r\nbe made in substance and form. After the entire report had been thus\r\nrevised, the Commission in many conferences decided what recommendations\r\nto make. These recommendations, with a summary of the report, were then\r\nprepared, and were reviewed by the Commission after they had been sent\r\nto each member. After full consideration they were further revised and\r\nthen adopted by the Commission. In all these conferences upon the report,\r\nall of the Commissioners, with one exception, conferred frequently and\r\nagreed unanimously. Mr. Morris, on account of his duties as a member of\r\nthe Constitutional Convention, did not attend any of these conferences\r\nupon the report, summary, or recommendations, and does not concur in them.\r\n\r\nThe Commission received the cordial assistance of many agencies,\r\norganizations, and individuals. The Chicago Urban League placed at its\r\ndisposal a large amount of material from its files. It also gave a leave\r\nof absence to the head of its Department of Research and Investigation,\r\nMr. Charles S. Johnson, the Commission's associate executive secretary.\r\nMany citizens, representing widely divergent lines of interest, who\r\nwere invited to attend conferences held by the Commission, gave most\r\ngenerously of their time and knowledge. The L. J. McCormick estate\r\ndonated three months' office rent. Messrs. George C. Nimmons & Company,\r\narchitects, contributed valuable services, including study and supervision\r\nby Frederick Jehnck of their office, in preparing maps and charts\r\ndesigned to present most effectively data collected by the Commission.\r\nThe Federal Bureau of the Census made available advanced data from the\r\n1920-21 censuses. Superintendent Peter A. Mortensen and many principals\r\nand teachers in the Chicago public schools co-operated in the extensive\r\nstudies of race relations in the schools; and the Committee of Fifteen\r\nprovided a report showing important facts in the study of environment\r\nand crime. The various park boards, many municipal, county, and state\r\nofficials, superintendents and others connected with industrial plants,\r\ntrades-union officers, and leaders in many civic and social agencies\r\ngreatly facilitated investigations in their respective fields. To all\r\nthese the Commission returns sincere thanks. But, perhaps, the greatest\r\ndebt of gratitude is due Mr. Ernest S. Simpson, who generously and\r\ndevotedly gave his spare time for many months to the editing of this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe Commission's letter to Governor Lowden summarizing its work, and\r\nhis answer follow:\r\n\r\n     January 1, 1921\r\n\r\n     _Honorable Frank O. Lowden_\r\n     _Governor of Illinois_\r\n\r\n     SIR: Following the race riot in Chicago in July and August,\r\n     1919, in which fifteen white people and twenty-three Negroes\r\n     were killed and very many of both races were injured, you\r\n     appointed us as a Commission on Race Relations \"to study and\r\n     report upon the broad question of the relations between the\r\n     two races.\" We have completed the investigations planned as\r\n     a basis for this study, and are now preparing a final report\r\n     of our findings, conclusions and recommendations. This report\r\n     will soon be ready.\r\n\r\n     The Commission began its work in October, 1919, and for eleven\r\n     months has had a staff of investigators assisting it in its\r\n     activities. While devoting much effort to the study of the\r\n     Chicago riot as presenting many phases of the race problem,\r\n     the Commission has placed greater emphasis upon the study of\r\n     the conditions of life of the Negro group in this community,\r\n     and of the broad questions of race relations. It therefore\r\n     organized itself into six committees on the following subjects:\r\n     Racial Clashes, Housing, Industry, Crime, Racial Contacts,\r\n     and Public Opinion.\r\n\r\n     In these fields the Commission's work has been done along two\r\n     main lines:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) a series of conferences, at which persons believed to\r\n     have special information and experience relating to these\r\n     subjects have been invited to give the Commission the benefit\r\n     of their knowledge and opinions;\r\n\r\n     (_b_) research and field work by a trained staff of\r\n     investigators, both white and Negro, to determine as accurately\r\n     as possible, from first-hand evidence, the actual conditions\r\n     in the above fields.\r\n\r\n     The series of conferences, numbering thirty, covered a wide\r\n     range of topics, such as: the race riot of 1919 as viewed by\r\n     the police, the militia, the grand jury, and state's attorney;\r\n     race friction and its remedies; contacts of whites and Negroes\r\n     in public schools and recreation places; special educational\r\n     problems of Negro children; Negro housing, its needs, type, and\r\n     financing, and its difficulties in mixed areas; Negro labor\r\n     in relation to employers, fellow-workers, and trade unions;\r\n     Negro women in industry; the Negro and social agencies; Negro\r\n     health; Negroes and whites in the courts and in correctional\r\n     institutions; and the Negro and white press in relation to\r\n     public opinion on race relations.\r\n\r\n     Of two hundred and sixty-three persons invited, one hundred\r\n     and seventy-five attended these conferences and presented\r\n     their information and views. They represented both races and\r\n     various groups and viewpoints; they included educators and\r\n     teachers, real estate men, bankers, managers of industrial\r\n     plants, housing experts, trades-union leaders, social workers,\r\n     physicians, park and playground directors, judges, clergymen,\r\n     superintendents of correctional and other institutions, police,\r\n     militia, and other public officials, and newspaper editors.\r\n\r\n     The research and field work done by the staff of investigators\r\n     covered in general the same broad range. The character is\r\n     indicated by a bare outline of the work in the six main fields:\r\n\r\n     Racial Clashes: 1919 Chicago riot, seventeen antecedent\r\n     clashes; three minor clashes in 1920; brief comparative study\r\n     of Springfield riot in 1908 and East St. Louis riot in 1917.\r\n\r\n     Racial Contacts: In schools, transportation lines, parks,\r\n     and other recreation places; contacts in mixed neighborhoods;\r\n     adjustment of southern Negro families coming to Chicago; survey\r\n     of Negro agencies and institutions.\r\n\r\n     Housing: Negro areas in Chicago and their expansion 1910-1920;\r\n     274 family histories showing housing experience, home life,\r\n     and social back-ground, including families from the South; 159\r\n     blocks covered in neighborhood survey; financing Negro housing;\r\n     depreciation in and near Negro areas; 52 house bombings,\r\n     1917-1920.\r\n\r\n     Industry: Data covering 22,448 Negroes in 192 plants; 101 plants\r\n     visited; quality of Negro labor; the widening opportunities and\r\n     chance for promotion studied; special study of trades unions\r\n     and the Negro worker.\r\n\r\n     Crime: Police statistics of arrests and convictions of Negroes\r\n     and selected nationalities compared and analyzed for six\r\n     years[3]; also juvenile court cases; 698 cases (one month) in\r\n     three police courts studied, including detailed social data on\r\n     Negro cases; also 249 sex cases (two years) in criminal court;\r\n     record of eleven penal institutions; environmental survey of\r\n     Negro areas.\r\n\r\n     Public Opinion: Files of white and Negro newspapers studied\r\n     to analyze handling of matters relating to race relations;\r\n     study of rumor and its effects, and of racial propaganda of\r\n     white and Negro organizations.\r\n\r\n     We believe that the large volume of information collected\r\n     will prove, when properly set forth, of great value not only\r\n     in Chicago but in other communities where public-spirited\r\n     citizens are endeavoring to establish right relations between\r\n     the two races. This end can be attained only through a more\r\n     intelligent appreciation by both races of the gravity of the\r\n     problem, and by their earnest efforts toward a better mutual\r\n     understanding and a more sympathetic co-operation.\r\n\r\n     Hoping that our appreciation of the trust you have reposed in\r\n     us may appear in some measure in the aid our report may give\r\n     toward working out better race relations, we are,\r\n\r\n         Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n             (Signed by members of the Commission and its Executive\r\n               Secretaries)\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     STATE OF ILLINOIS\r\n     OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\r\n     SPRINGFIELD\r\n\r\n     January 3, 1921\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MR. BANCROFT:\r\n\r\n     I have received and read with great interest your letter of\r\n     January 1st transmitting to me a detailed statement of the\r\n     work of the Chicago Commission on Race Relations appointed by\r\n     me after the race riot in Chicago in 1919, which is signed by\r\n     yourself as chairman and by the other members of the Commission.\r\n\r\n     I am greatly pleased to know that the Commission has been\r\n     able to accomplish so much through its investigations and\r\n     that there has been such hearty co-operation on the part of\r\n     many citizens to make the inquiry in this important field as\r\n     valuable as possible.\r\n\r\n     I shall look forward with more than ordinary interest to the\r\n     appearance of the completed report in printed form. I suggest\r\n     that the Commission arrange for its publication as soon as\r\n     possible in order that your findings and recommendations may\r\n     be made available to all students of race relations in our\r\n     country.\r\n\r\n     I desire to express to you and through you to the members\r\n     of the Commission my great appreciation of the service which\r\n     you have rendered to the people of Chicago and of Illinois in\r\n     connection with the Commission. I have been advised from time to\r\n     time of your continuing interest, your fidelity in attendance\r\n     upon the meetings of the Commission, and your earnest desire\r\n     to render as accurate a judgment as possible.\r\n\r\n         Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n             (Signed) FRANK O. LOWDEN\r\n\r\n     HON. EDGAR A. BANCROFT\r\n     _Chairman, Chicago Commission on Race Relations_\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Governor Lowden's suggestion the Commission herewith\r\npresents its report, with findings and recommendations, hoping that\r\nit may prove of service in the efforts to bring about better relations\r\nbetween the white and Negro races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of whites and Negroes in the United States is our most grave\r\nand perplexing domestic problem. It involves not only a difference of\r\nrace--which as to many immigrant races has been happily overcome--but\r\nwider and more manifest differences in color and physical features.\r\nThese make an easy and natural basis for distinctions, discriminations,\r\nand antipathies arising from the instinct of each race to preserve its\r\ntype. Many white Americans, while technically recognizing Negroes as\r\ncitizens, cannot bring themselves to feel that they should participate\r\nin government as freely as other citizens.\r\n\r\nCountless schemes have been proposed for solving or dismissing this\r\nproblem, most of them impracticable or impossible. Of this class are such\r\nproposals as: (1) the deportation of 12,000,000 Negroes to Africa; (2)\r\nthe establishment of a separate Negro state in the United States; (3)\r\ncomplete separation and segregation from the whites and the establishment\r\nof a caste system or peasant class; and (4) hope for a solution through\r\nthe dying out of the Negro race. The only effect of such proposals is to\r\nconfuse thinking on the vital issues involved and to foster impatience\r\nand intolerance.\r\n\r\nOur race problem must be solved in harmony with the fundamental law of\r\nthe nation and with its free institutions. These prevent any deportation\r\nof the Negro, as well as any restriction of his freedom of movement\r\nwithin the United States. The problem must not be regarded as sectional\r\nor political, and it should be studied and discussed seriously, frankly,\r\nand with an open mind.\r\n\r\nIt is important for our white citizens always to remember that the Negroes\r\nalone of all our immigrants came to America against their will by the\r\nspecial compelling invitation of the whites; that the institution of\r\nslavery was introduced, expanded, and maintained in the United States\r\nby the white people and for their own benefit; and that they likewise\r\ncreated the conditions that followed emancipation.\r\n\r\nOur Negro problem, therefore, is not of the Negro's making. No group in\r\nour population is less responsible for its existence. But every group is\r\nresponsible for its continuance; and every citizen, regardless of color\r\nor racial origin, is in honor and conscience bound to seek and forward\r\nits solution.\r\n\r\nCenturies of the Negro slave trade and of slavery as an institution\r\nhave created, and are often deemed to justify, the deep-seated prejudice\r\nagainst Negroes. They placed a stamp upon the relations of the two races\r\nwhich it will require many years to erase. The memory of these relations\r\nhas profoundly affected and still affects the industrial, commercial,\r\nand social life of the southern states.\r\n\r\nThe great body of anti-Negro public opinion, preserved in the literature\r\nand traditions of the white race during the long, unhappy progress of\r\nthe Negro from savagery through slavery to citizenship, has exercised\r\na persistent and powerful effect, both conscious and unconscious, upon\r\nthe thinking and the behavior of the white group generally. Racial\r\nmisunderstanding has been fostered by the ignorance and indifference of\r\nmany white citizens concerning the marvelous industry and courage shown\r\nby the Negroes and the success they have achieved in their fifty-nine\r\nyears of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Negro race must develop, as all races have developed, from lower\r\nto higher planes of living; and must base its progress upon industry,\r\nefficiency, and moral character. Training along these lines and general\r\nopportunities for education are the fundamental needs. As the problem\r\nis national in its scope and gravity, the solution must be national.\r\nAnd the nation must make sure that the Negro is educated for citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt is of the first importance that old prejudices against the Negroes,\r\nbased upon their misfortunes and not on their faults, be supplanted with\r\nrespect, encouragement, and co-operation, and with a recognition of their\r\nheroic struggles for self-improvement and of their worthy achievements\r\nas loyal American citizens.\r\n\r\nBoth races need to understand that their rights and duties are mutual\r\nand equal, and that their interests in the common good are identical;\r\nthat relations of amity are the only protection against race clashes;\r\nthat these relations cannot be forced, but will come naturally as the\r\nleaders of each race develop within their own ranks a realization of\r\nthe gravity of this problem and a vital interest in its solution, and\r\nan attitude of confidence, respect, and friendliness toward the people\r\nof the other race.\r\n\r\nAll our citizens, regardless of color or racial origin, need to be taught\r\nby their leaders that there is a common standard of superiority for them\r\nall in self-respect, honesty, industry, fairness, forbearance, and above\r\nall, in generous helpfulness. There is no help or healing in appraising\r\npast responsibilities, or in present apportioning of praise or blame.\r\nThe past is of value only as it aids in understanding the present; and\r\nan understanding of the facts of the problem--a magnanimous understanding\r\nby both races--is the first step toward its solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CHICAGO RIOT\r\n\r\nJULY 27-AUGUST 2, 1919\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-eight persons killed, 537 injured, and about 1,000 rendered\r\nhomeless and destitute was the casualty list of the race riot which broke\r\nout in Chicago on July 27, 1919, and swept uncontrolled through parts\r\nof the city for four days. By August 2 it had yielded to the forces of\r\nlaw and order, and on August 8 the state militia withdrew.\r\n\r\nA clash between whites and Negroes on the shore of Lake Michigan at\r\nTwenty-ninth Street, which involved much stone-throwing and resulted in\r\nthe drowning of a Negro boy, was the beginning of the riot. A policeman's\r\nrefusal to arrest a white man accused by Negroes of stoning the Negro\r\nboy was an important factor in starting mob action. Within two hours the\r\nriot was in full sway, had scored its second fatality, and was spreading\r\nthroughout the south and southwest parts of the city. Before the end came\r\nit reached out to a section of the West Side and even invaded the \"Loop,\"\r\nthe heart of Chicago's downtown business district. Of the thirty-eight\r\nkilled, fifteen were whites and twenty-three Negroes; of 537 injured,\r\n178 were whites, 342 were Negroes, and the race of seventeen was not\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with many other outbreaks of violence over racial friction the\r\nChicago riot was not preceded by excitement over reports of attacks on\r\nwomen or of any other crimes alleged to have been committed by Negroes.\r\nIt is interesting to note that not one of the thirty-eight deaths was of\r\na woman or girl, and that only ten of the 537 persons injured were women\r\nor girls. In further contrast with other outbreaks of racial violence,\r\nthe Chicago riot was marked by no hangings or burnings.\r\n\r\nThe rioting was characterized by much activity on the part of gangs of\r\nhoodlums, and the clashes developed from sudden and spontaneous assaults\r\ninto organized raids against life and property.\r\n\r\nIn handling the emergency and restoring order, the police were effectively\r\nreinforced by the state militia. Help was also rendered by deputy\r\nsheriffs, and by ex-soldiers who volunteered.\r\n\r\nIn nine of the thirty-eight cases of death, indictments for murder\r\nwere voted by the grand jury, and in the ensuing trials there were four\r\nconvictions. In fifteen other cases the coroner's jury recommended that\r\nunknown members of mobs be apprehended, but none of these was ever found.\r\n\r\nThe conditions underlying the Chicago riot are discussed in detail\r\nin other sections of this report, especially in those which deal\r\nwith housing, industry, and racial contacts. The Commission's inquiry\r\nconcerning the facts of the riot included a critical analysis of the\r\n5,584 pages of the testimony taken by the coroner's jury; a study of the\r\nrecords of the office of the state's attorney; studies of the records of\r\nthe Police Department, hospitals, and other institutions with reference\r\nto injuries, and of the records of the Fire Department with reference to\r\nincendiary fires; and interviews with many public officials and citizens\r\nhaving special knowledge of various phases of the riot. Much information\r\nwas also gained by the Commission in a series of four conferences to\r\nwhich it invited the foreman of the riot grand jury, the chief and other\r\ncommanding officers of the Police Department, the state's attorney and\r\nsome of his assistants, and officers in command of the state militia\r\nduring the riot.\r\n\r\n_Background of the riot._--The Chicago riot was not the only serious\r\noutbreak of interracial violence in the year following the war. The same\r\nsummer witnessed the riot in Washington, about a week earlier; the riot\r\nin Omaha, about a month later; and then the week of armed conflict in a\r\nrural district of Arkansas due to exploitation of Negro cotton producers.\r\n\r\nNor was the Chicago riot the first violent manifestation of race\r\nantagonism in Illinois. In 1908 Springfield had been the scene of an\r\noutbreak that brought shame to the community which boasted of having\r\nbeen Lincoln's home. In 1917 East St. Louis was torn by a bitter and\r\ndestructive riot which raged for nearly a week, and was the subject\r\nof a Congressional investigation that disclosed appalling underlying\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThis Commission, while making a thorough study of the Chicago riot, has\r\nreviewed briefly, for comparative purposes, the essential facts of the\r\nSpringfield and East St. Louis riots, and of minor clashes in Chicago\r\noccurring both before and after the riot of 1919.\r\n\r\nChicago was one of the northern cities most largely affected by the\r\nmigration of Negroes from the South during the war. The Negro population\r\nincreased from 44,103 in 1910 to 109,594 in 1920, an increase of 148 per\r\ncent. Most of this increase came in the years 1916-19. It was principally\r\ncaused by the widening of industrial opportunities due to the entrance\r\nof northern workers into the army and to the demand for war workers\r\nat much higher wages than Negroes had been able to earn in the South.\r\nAn added factor was the feeling, which spread like a contagion through\r\nthe South, that the great opportunity had come to escape from what they\r\nfelt to be a land of discrimination and subserviency to places where\r\nthey could expect fair treatment and equal rights. Chicago became to\r\nthe southern Negro the \"top of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this influx of Negroes into Chicago industries is reviewed\r\nin another section of this report.[4] It is necessary to point out here\r\nonly that friction in industry was less than might have been expected.\r\nThere had been a few strikes which had given the Negro the name of \"strike\r\nbreaker.\" But the demand for labor was such that there were plenty of\r\njobs to absorb all the white and Negro workers available. This condition\r\ncontinued even after the end of the war and demobilization.\r\n\r\nIn housing, however, there was a different story. Practically no new\r\nbuilding had been done in the city during the war, and it was a physical\r\nimpossibility for a doubled Negro population to live in the space\r\noccupied in 1915. Negroes spread out of what had been known as the \"Black\r\nBelt\" into neighborhoods near-by which had been exclusively white. This\r\nmovement, as described in another section of this report, developed\r\nfriction, so much so that in the \"invaded\" neighborhoods bombs were thrown\r\nat the houses of Negroes who had moved in, and of real estate men, white\r\nand Negro, who sold or rented property to the newcomers. From July 1,\r\n1917, to July 27, 1919, the day the riot began, twenty-four such bombs\r\nhad been thrown. The police had been entirely unsuccessful in finding\r\nthose guilty, and were accused of making little effort to do so.\r\n\r\nA third phase of the situation was the increased political strength gained\r\nby Mayor Thompson's faction in the Republican party. Negro politicians\r\naffiliated with this faction had been able to sway to its support a large\r\nproportion of the voters in the ward most largely inhabited by Negroes.\r\nNegro aldermen elected from this ward were prominent in the activities\r\nof this faction. The part played by the Negro vote in the hard-fought\r\npartisan struggle is indicated by the fact that in the Republican primary\r\nelection on February 25, 1919, Mayor Thompson received in this ward\r\n12,143 votes, while his two opponents, Olson and Merriam, received only\r\n1,492 and 319 respectively. Mayor Thompson was re-elected on April 1,\r\n1919, by a plurality of 21,622 in a total vote in the city of 698,920;\r\nhis vote in this ward was 15,569, to his nearest opponent's 3,323, and\r\nwas therefore large enough to control the election. The bitterness of\r\nthis factional struggle aroused resentment against the race that had so\r\nconspicuously allied itself with the Thompson side.\r\n\r\nAs part of the background of the Chicago riot, the activities of gangs of\r\nhoodlums should be cited. There had been friction for years, especially\r\nalong the western boundary of the area in which the Negroes mainly live,\r\nand attacks upon Negroes by gangs of young toughs had been particularly\r\nfrequent in the spring just preceding the riot. They reached a climax\r\non the night of June 21, 1919, five weeks before the riot, when two\r\nNegroes were murdered. Each was alone at the time and was the victim\r\nof unprovoked and particularly brutal attack. Molestation of Negroes\r\nby hoodlums had been prevalent in the vicinity of parks and playgrounds\r\nand at bathing-beaches.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions shortly before the riot the forewarnings of serious\r\nracial trouble had been so pronounced that the chief of police sent\r\nseveral hundred extra policemen into the territory where trouble seemed\r\nimminent. But serious violence did not break out until Sunday afternoon,\r\nJuly 27, when the clash on the lake shore at Twenty-ninth Street resulted\r\nin the drowning of a Negro boy.\r\n\r\n_The beginning of the riot._--Events followed so fast in the train of\r\nthe drowning that this tragedy may be considered as marking the beginning\r\nof the riot.\r\n\r\nIt was four o'clock Sunday afternoon, July 27, when Eugene Williams,\r\nseventeen-year-old Negro boy, was swimming offshore at the foot of\r\nTwenty-ninth Street. This beach was not one of those publicly maintained\r\nand supervised for bathing, but it was much used. Although it flanks\r\nan area thickly inhabited by Negroes, it was used by both races, access\r\nbeing had by crossing the railway tracks which skirt the lake shore. The\r\npart near Twenty-seventh Street had by tacit understanding come to be\r\nconsidered as reserved for Negroes, while the whites used the part near\r\nTwenty-ninth Street. Walking is not easy along the shore, and each race\r\nhad kept pretty much to its own part, observing, moreover, an imaginary\r\nboundary extending into the water.\r\n\r\nWilliams, who had entered the water at the part used by Negroes, swam\r\nand drifted south into the part used by the whites. Immediately before\r\nhis appearance there, white men, women, and children had been bathing in\r\nthe vicinity and were on the beach in considerable numbers. Four Negroes\r\nwalked through the group and into the water. White men summarily ordered\r\nthem off. The Negroes left, and the white people resumed their sport.\r\nBut it was not long before the Negroes were back, coming from the north\r\nwith others of their race. Then began a series of attacks and retreats,\r\ncounter-attacks, and stone-throwing. Women and children who could not\r\nescape hid behind débris and rocks. The stone-throwing continued, first\r\none side gaining the advantage, then the other.\r\n\r\nWilliams, who had remained in the water during the fracas, found a\r\nrailroad tie and clung to it, stones meanwhile frequently striking the\r\nwater near him. A white boy of about the same age swam toward him. As\r\nthe white boy neared, Williams let go of the tie, took a few strokes,\r\nand went down. The coroner's jury rendered a verdict that he had drowned\r\nbecause fear of stone-throwing kept him from shore. His body showed no\r\nstone bruises, but rumor had it that he had actually been hit by one of\r\nthe stones and drowned as a result.\r\n\r\nOn shore guilt was immediately placed upon a certain white man by several\r\nNegro witnesses who demanded that he be arrested by a white policeman\r\nwho was on the spot. No arrest was made.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy was sensed by the battling crowd and, awed by it, they\r\ngathered on the beach. For an hour both whites and Negroes dived for\r\nthe boy without results. Awe gave way to excited whispers. \"They\" said\r\nhe was stoned to death. The report circulated through the crowd that\r\nthe police officer had refused to arrest the murderer. The Negroes in\r\nthe crowd began to mass dangerously. At this crucial point the accused\r\npoliceman arrested a Negro on a white man's complaint. Negroes mobbed\r\nthe white officer, and the riot was under way.\r\n\r\nOne version of the quarrel which resulted in the drowning of Williams\r\nwas given by the state's attorney, who declared that it arose among\r\nwhite and Negro gamblers over a craps game on the shore, \"virtually\r\nunder the protection of the police officer on the beat.\" Eyewitnesses\r\nto the stone-throwing clash appearing before the coroner's jury saw\r\nno gambling, but said it might have been going on, but if so, was not\r\nvisible from the water's edge. The crowd undoubtedly included, as the\r\ngrand jury declared, \"hoodlums, gamblers, and thugs,\" but it also included\r\nlaw-abiding citizens, white and Negro.\r\n\r\nThis charge, that the first riot clash started among gamblers who were\r\nunder the protection of the police officer, and also the charge that the\r\npoliceman refused to arrest the stone-thrower were vigorously denied by\r\nthe police. The policeman's star was taken from him, but after a hearing\r\nbefore the Civil Service Commission it was returned, thus officially\r\nvindicating him.\r\n\r\nThe two facts, the drowning and the refusal to arrest, or widely\r\ncirculated reports of such refusal, must be considered together as\r\nmarking the inception of the riot. Testimony of a captain of police\r\nshows that first reports from the lake after the drowning indicated that\r\nthe situation was calming down. White men had shown a not altogether\r\nhostile feeling for the Negroes by assisting in diving for the body of\r\nthe boy. Furthermore a clash started on this isolated spot could not\r\nbe augmented by outsiders rushing in. There was every possibility that\r\nthe clash, without the further stimulus of reports of the policeman's\r\nconduct, would have quieted down.\r\n\r\n_Chronological story of the riot._--After the drowning of Williams, it\r\nwas two hours before any further fatalities occurred. Reports of the\r\ndrowning and of the alleged conduct of the policeman spread out into\r\nthe neighborhood. The Negro crowd from the beach gathered at the foot\r\nof Twenty-ninth Street. As it became more and more excited, a group of\r\nofficers was called by the policeman who had been at the beach. James\r\nCrawford, a Negro, fired into the group of officers and was himself shot\r\nand killed by a Negro policeman who had been sent to help restore order.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the afternoon of July 27, many distorted rumors\r\ncirculated swiftly throughout the South Side. The Negro crowd from\r\nTwenty-ninth Street got into action, and white men who came in contact\r\nwith it were beaten. In all, four white men were beaten, five were\r\nstabbed, and one was shot. As the rumors spread, new crowds gathered,\r\nmobs sprang into activity spontaneously, and gangs began to take part\r\nin the lawlessness.\r\n\r\nFarther to the west, as darkness came on, white gangsters became active.\r\nNegroes in white districts suffered severely at their hands. From 9:00\r\nP.M. until 3:00 A.M. twenty-seven Negroes were beaten, seven were stabbed,\r\nand four were shot.\r\n\r\nFew clashes occurred on Monday morning. People of both races went to\r\nwork as usual and even continued to work side by side, as customary,\r\nwithout signs of violence. But as the afternoon wore on, white men and\r\nboys living between the Stock Yards and the \"Black Belt\" sought malicious\r\namusement in directing mob violence against Negro workers returning home.\r\n\r\nStreet-car routes, especially transfer points, were thronged with white\r\npeople of all ages. Trolleys were pulled from wires and the cars brought\r\nunder the control of mob leaders. Negro passengers were dragged to the\r\nstreet, beaten, and kicked. The police were apparently powerless to cope\r\nwith these numerous assaults. Four Negro men and one white assailant\r\nwere killed, and thirty Negro men were severely beaten in the street-car\r\nclashes.\r\n\r\nThe \"Black Belt\" contributed its share of violence to the record of\r\nMonday afternoon and night. Rumors of white depredations and killings\r\nwere current among the Negroes and led to acts of retaliation. An aged\r\nItalian peddler, one Lazzeroni, was set upon by young Negro boys and\r\nstabbed to death. Eugene Temple, white laundryman, was stabbed to death\r\nand robbed by three Negroes.\r\n\r\nA Negro mob made a demonstration outside Provident Hospital, an\r\ninstitution conducted by Negroes, because two injured whites who had\r\nbeen shooting right and left from a hurrying automobile on State Street\r\nwere taken there. Other mobs stabbed six white men, shot five others,\r\nseverely beat nine more, and killed two in addition to those named above.\r\n\r\nRumor had it that a white occupant of the Angelus apartment house had shot\r\na Negro boy from a fourth-story window. Negroes besieged the building.\r\nThe white tenants sought police protection, and about 100 policemen,\r\nincluding some mounted men, responded. The mob of about 1,500 Negroes\r\ndemanded the \"culprit,\" but the police failed to find him after a search\r\nof the building. A flying brick hit a policeman. There was a quick massing\r\nof the police, and a volley was fired into the Negro mob. Four Negroes\r\nwere killed and many were injured. It is believed that had the Negroes\r\nnot lost faith in the white police force it is hardly likely that the\r\nAngelus riot would have occurred.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Monday night, both whites and Negroes showed signs of\r\npanic. Each race grouped by itself. Small mobs began systematically in\r\nvarious neighborhoods to terrorize and kill. Gangs in the white districts\r\ngrew bolder, finally taking the offensive in raids through territory\r\n\"invaded\" by Negro home seekers. Boys between sixteen and twenty-two\r\nbanded together to enjoy the excitement of the chase.\r\n\r\nAutomobile raids were added to the rioting Monday night. Cars from which\r\nrifle and revolver shots were fired were driven at great speed through\r\nsections inhabited by Negroes. Negroes defended themselves by \"sniping\"\r\nand volley-firing from ambush and barricade. So great was the fear of\r\nthese raiding parties that the Negroes distrusted all motor vehicles\r\nand frequently opened fire on them without waiting to learn the intent\r\nof the occupants. This type of warfare was kept up spasmodically all\r\nTuesday and was resumed with vigor Tuesday night.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, Monday, street-car clashes ended by reason of a general\r\nstrike on the surface and elevated lines. The street-railway tie-up\r\nwas complete for the remainder of the week. But on Tuesday morning\r\nthis was a new source of terror for those who tried to walk to their\r\nplaces of employment. Men were killed en route to their work through\r\nhostile territory. Idle men congregated on the streets, and gang-rioting\r\nincreased. A white gang of soldiers and sailors in uniform, augmented\r\nby civilians, raided the \"Loop,\" or downtown section of Chicago, early\r\nTuesday, killing two Negroes and beating and robbing several others.\r\nIn the course of these activities they wantonly destroyed property of\r\nwhite business men.\r\n\r\nGangs sprang up as far south as Sixty-third Street in Englewood and in the\r\nsection west of Wentworth Avenue near Forty-seventh Street. Premeditated\r\ndepredations were the order of the night. Many Negro homes in mixed\r\ndistricts were attacked, and several of them were burned. Furniture\r\nwas stolen or destroyed. When raiders were driven off they would return\r\nagain and again until their designs were accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe contagion of the race war broke over the boundaries of the South\r\nSide and spread to the Italians on the West Side. This community became\r\nexcited over a rumor, and an Italian crowd killed a Negro, Joseph Lovings.\r\n\r\nWednesday saw a material lessening of crime and violence. The \"Black\r\nBelt\" and the district immediately west of it were still storm centers.\r\nBut the peak of the rioting had apparently passed, although the danger\r\nof fresh outbreaks of magnitude was still imminent. Although companies\r\nof the militia had been mobilized in nearby armories as early as Monday\r\nnight, July 28, it was not until Wednesday evening at 10:30 that the\r\nmayor yielded to pressure and asked for their help.\r\n\r\nRain on Wednesday night and Thursday drove idle people of both races\r\ninto their homes. The temperature fell, and with it the white heat of\r\nthe riot. From this time on the violence was sporadic, scattered, and\r\nmeager. The riot seemed well under control, if not actually ended.\r\n\r\nFriday witnessed only a single reported injury. At 3:35 A.M. Saturday\r\nincendiary fires burned forty-nine houses in the immigrant neighborhood\r\nwest of the Stock Yards. Nine hundred and forty-eight people, mostly\r\nLithuanians, were made homeless, and the property loss was about $250,000.\r\nResponsibility for these fires was never fixed. The riot virtually ceased\r\non Saturday. For the next few days injured were reported occasionally,\r\nand by August 8 the riot zone had settled down to normal and the militia\r\nwas withdrawn.\r\n\r\n_Growth of the riot._--The riot period was thirteen days in length, from\r\nSunday, July 27, through Thursday, August 8, the day on which the troops\r\nwere withdrawn. Of this time, only the first seven days witnessed active\r\nrioting. The remaining days marked the return toward normal. In the\r\nseven active days, rioting was not continuous but intermittent, being\r\nfurious for hours, then fairly quiescent for hours. The first three\r\ndays saw the most acute disturbance, and in this span there were three\r\nmain periods: 4:00 P.M. Sunday till 3:00 A.M. Monday; 9:00 A.M. Monday\r\ntill 9:00 A.M. Tuesday; noon Tuesday till midnight. This left two long\r\nintervals of comparative quiet, six hours on Monday and three hours on\r\nTuesday. On the fourth day, Wednesday, there were scattered periods of\r\nrioting, each of a few hours' duration. Thus Monday afternoon to Tuesday\r\nmorning was the longest stretch of active rioting in the first four days.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the riot was confined to the South Side of the city.\r\nThere were two notable exceptions, the district north and west of the\r\nsouth branch of the Chicago River and the \"Loop\" or downtown business\r\ndistrict. A few isolated clashes occurred on the North Side and on the\r\nextreme West Side, but aside from these the area covered was that shown\r\non the accompanying outline map.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of discussion it is convenient to divide the riot area\r\ninto seven districts. The boundaries in some instances are due to the\r\ndesignation of Wentworth Avenue by the police as a boundary west of\r\nwhich no Negroes should be allowed, and east of which no whites should\r\nbe allowed.\r\n\r\n     I. \"Black Belt.\" From Twenty-second to Thirty-ninth, inclusive;\r\n     Wentworth Avenue to the lake, exclusive of Wentworth;\r\n     Thirty-ninth to Fifty-fifth, inclusive; Clark to Michigan,\r\n     exclusive of Michigan.\r\n\r\n     II. Area contested by both Negroes and whites. Thirty-ninth\r\n     to Fifty-fifth, inclusive; Michigan to the lake.\r\n\r\n     III. Southwest Side, including the Stock Yards district;\r\n     south of the Chicago River to Fifty-fifth; west of Wentworth,\r\n     including Wentworth.\r\n\r\n     IV. Area south of Fifty-fifth and east of Wentworth.\r\n\r\n     V. Area south of Fifty-fifth and west of Wentworth.\r\n\r\n     VI. Area north and west of the Chicago River.\r\n\r\n     VII. \"Loop\" or business district and vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn the district designated as the \"Black Belt\" about 90 per cent of\r\nthe Negroes live. District II, the \"contested area,\" is that in which\r\nmost of the bombings have occurred. Negroes are said to be \"invading\"\r\nthis district. Extension here instead of into District III, toward the\r\nStock Yards neighborhood, may be explained partly by the hostility which\r\nthe Irish and Polish groups to the west had often shown to Negroes.\r\nThe white hoodlum element of the Stock Yards district, designated as\r\nIII, was characterized by the state's attorney of Cook County, when he\r\nremarked that more bank robbers, pay-roll bandits, automobile bandits,\r\nhighwaymen, and strong-arm crooks come from this particular district\r\nthan from any other that has come to his notice during seven years of\r\nservice as chief prosecuting official.[5]\r\n\r\nIn District IV and V, south of Fifty-fifth Street, Negroes live in small\r\ncommunities surrounded by white people or are scattered through white\r\nneighborhoods. District VI has a large Italian population. District VII\r\nis Chicago's wholesale and retail center.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CHICAGO RIOT\r\n   JULY, 27 TO AUGUST, 8, 1919]\r\n\r\nOn only one day of the riot were all these districts involved in the race\r\nwarfare. This was Tuesday. On Sunday Districts I, III, and IV suffered\r\nclashes; on Monday all but District VI were involved; on Tuesday the\r\nentire area was affected; on Wednesday District VII was not included,\r\nand District VI witnessed only one clash; on Thursday District IV was\r\nagain normal, and Districts II, V, and VII were comparatively quiet;\r\nduring the remainder of the week only the first three districts named\r\nwere active.\r\n\r\nThe worst clashes were in Districts I and III, and of those reported\r\ninjured, 34 per cent received their wounds in the \"Black Belt,\" District\r\nI, and 41 per cent on the Southwest Side, in the district including the\r\nStock Yards, District III.\r\n\r\nFactors contributing to the subsidence of the riot were the natural\r\nreaction from the tension, efforts of police and citizens to curb the\r\nrioters, the entrance of the militia on Wednesday, and last, but perhaps\r\nnot least, a heavy rain.\r\n\r\nThe longest period of violence without noticeable lull was 9:00 A.M.\r\nMonday to 9:00 A.M. Tuesday. On Tuesday the feeling was most intense, as\r\nshown by the nature of the clashes. Arson was prevalent on Tuesday for\r\nthe first time, and the property loss was considerable. But judging by\r\nthe only definite index, the number of dead and injured, Monday exceeded\r\nTuesday in violence, showing 229 injured and eighteen dead as against\r\n139 injured and eleven dead on the latter day. While it is apparent\r\nthat no single hour or even day can be called the peak of the riot, the\r\nheight of violence clearly falls within the two-day period Monday, July\r\n28, and Tuesday, July 29.\r\n\r\nThe change in the nature of the clashes day by day showed an increase in\r\nintensity of feeling and greater boldness in action. This development\r\nreached its peak on Tuesday. Later came a decline, sporadic outbursts\r\nsucceeding sustained activity.\r\n\r\n_Factors influencing growth of the riot._--After the attacks had stopped,\r\nabout 3:00 A.M. Monday, they did not again assume serious proportions\r\nuntil Monday afternoon, when workers began to return to their homes, and\r\nidle men gathered in the streets in greater numbers than during working\r\nhours. The Stock Yards laborers are dismissed for the day in shifts.\r\nNegroes coming from the Yards at the 3:00 P.M., 4:00 P.M., and later\r\nshifts were met by white gangs armed with bats and clubs. On Tuesday\r\nmorning men going to work, both Negro and white, were attacked.\r\n\r\nThe main areas of violence were thoroughfares and natural highways between\r\nthe job and the home. On the South Side 76 per cent of all the injuries\r\noccurred on such streets. The most turbulent corners were those on State\r\nStreet between Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth, on Cottage Grove Avenue at\r\nSixty-third Street, on Halsted Street at Thirty-fifth and Forty-seventh\r\nstreets and on Archer Avenue at Thirty-fifth Street. Injuries at these\r\nspots were distributed as follows:[6]\r\n\r\n                                                  Injuries  Deaths\r\n\r\n     State Street--\r\n       at Thirty-first                                7\r\n       between Thirty-first and Thirty-fifth          2\r\n       at Thirty-fifth                                9       1\r\n       between Thirty-fifth and Thirty-ninth         19       2\r\n       at Thirty-ninth                                3\r\n     Cottage Grove Avenue--\r\n       at Sixty-third Street                          8\r\n     Halsted Street--\r\n       at Thirty-fifth                                8\r\n       at Forty-seventh                               5\r\n     Archer Avenue--\r\n       at Thirty-fifth Street                         7\r\n     Streets which suffered most from rioting were--\r\n       State                                         61       6\r\n       Thirty-fifth                                  50       5\r\n       Forty-seventh                                 32       2\r\n       Halsted                                       32\r\n       Thirty-first                                  29       1\r\n\r\nThe street-car situation had an effect upon the riot both before the\r\nstrike and after it. Because of a shortage of labor at the time, the\r\nsurface-street-car company had put on a number of inexperienced men.\r\nThis may account for the inefficiency of some crews in handling attacked\r\ncars.\r\n\r\nAn example is the case of Henry Goodman who was killed in an attack on a\r\nThirty-ninth Street car. The car was stopped at Union Avenue by a truck\r\nsuspiciously stalled across the tracks. White men boarded the car and\r\nbeat and chased six or eight Negro passengers. When asked under oath\r\nto whom the truck directly in front of him belonged and what color it\r\nwas, the motorman replied, \"I couldn't say.\" When asked what time his\r\ncar left the end of the line and whether or not he had seen any Negroes\r\nhit on the car, he answered, \"I didn't pay any attention.\" The motorman\r\nsaid he made a report of the case, but it could not be found by anyone\r\nin the street-car company's office. The conductor of this car had been\r\ngiven orders to warn Negroes that there was rioting in the district\r\nthrough which the car ran. He did not do this. He ignored the truck. No\r\nnames of witnesses were secured. The motorman was an extra man and had\r\nrun on that route only during the day of the attack.\r\n\r\nIn the case of John Mills, a Negro who was killed as he fled from a\r\nForty-seventh Street car, the motorman left the car while Negroes were\r\nbeing beaten inside it. Neither motorman nor conductor took names of\r\nwitnesses or attempted to fix a description of the assailants in mind.\r\n\r\nWhen B. F. Hardy, a Negro, was killed on a street car at Forty-sixth\r\nStreet and Cottage Grove Avenue, the motorman and conductor offered no\r\nresistance and did not get names or descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the conductor and motorman on a car attacked at\r\nThirty-eighth Street and Ashland Avenue was clear and showed an attempt\r\nto get all information possible. They secured names of witnesses. One\r\nmember of the crew had been in the service of the Chicago Surface Lines\r\nfor ten years, and the other for twelve years.\r\n\r\nThe tie-up of the street railways affected the riot situation by forcing\r\nlaborers to walk, making them more liable to assault in the hostile\r\ndistricts, by keeping many workers from jobs, turning out on the streets\r\nhundreds of idle men, and by increasing the use of automobiles.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning two white men were killed while walking to work through\r\nthe Negro area, and two Negroes were killed while going through the\r\nwhite area.\r\n\r\nCuriosity led the idle to the riot zone. One such was asked on the witness\r\nstand why he went. \"What was I there for? Because I walked there--my\r\nown bad luck. I was curious to see how they did it, that is all.\"\r\n\r\nUnder cover of legitimate use gangs used motor vehicles for raiding.\r\nWitnesses of rioting near Ogden Park said trucks unloaded passengers on\r\nRacine Avenue, facilitating the formation of a mob. On Halsted Street\r\ncrowds of young men rode in trucks shouting they were out to \"get the\r\nniggers.\" An automobile load of young men headed off Heywood Thomas,\r\nNegro, and shot him, at Taylor and Halsted streets, as he was walking\r\nhome from work.\r\n\r\nBeside daily routine and the street-car situation, the weather undoubtedly\r\nhad an influence in the progress of the riot. July 27 was hot, 96 degrees,\r\nor fourteen points above normal. It was the culmination of a series of\r\ndays with high temperatures around 95 degrees, which meant that nerves\r\nwere strained. The warm weather of Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday also\r\nkept crowds on the streets and sitting on doorsteps until late at night.\r\nInnocent people trying to keep cool were injured when automobiles raced\r\nthrough the streets, the occupants firing to right and left. Wednesday\r\nnight and Thursday it rained. Cool weather followed for the rest of the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n_Gangs and \"athletic clubs.\"_--Gangs and their activities were an\r\nimportant factor throughout the riot. But for them it is doubtful if the\r\nriot would have gone beyond the first clash. Both organized gangs and\r\nthose which sprang into existence because of the opportunity afforded\r\nseized upon the excuse of the first conflict to engage in lawless acts.\r\n\r\nIt was no new thing for youthful white and Negro groups to come to\r\nviolence. For years, as the sections of this report dealing with\r\nantecedent clashes and with recreation show, there had been clashes\r\nover baseball grounds, swimming-pools in the parks, the right to walk\r\non certain streets, etc.\r\n\r\nGangs whose activities figured so prominently in the riot were all white\r\ngangs, or \"athletic clubs.\" Negro hoodlums do not appear to form organized\r\ngangs so readily. Judges of the municipal court said that there are no\r\ngang organizations among Negroes to compare with those found among young\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nThe Stock Yards district, just west of the main Negro area, is the home\r\nof many of these white gangs and clubs; it is designated as District III\r\nin the discussion of the riot growth. The state's attorney, as already\r\nindicated (see p. 8), referred to the many young offenders who come from\r\nthis particular district. A police detective sergeant who investigated\r\nthe riot cases in this district said of this section, \"It is a pretty\r\ntough neighborhood to try to get any information out there; you can't\r\ndo it.\" A policeman on the beat in the district said, \"There is the\r\nCanaryville bunch in there and the Hamburg bunch. It is a pretty tough\r\nhole in there.\"\r\n\r\nThere was much evidence and talk of the political \"pull\" and even\r\nleadership of these gangs with reference to their activities in the\r\nriot. A member of \"Ragen's Colts\" just after the riot passed the word\r\nthat the \"coppers\" from downtown were looking for club members, but that\r\n\"there need be no fear of the coppers from the station at the Yards for\r\nthey were all fixed and told to lay off on club members.\" During the\r\nriot he claimed they were well protected by always having a \"cop\" ride\r\nin one of the automobiles so everything would be \"O.K.\" in case members\r\nof the gang were picked up. Another member of the club said he had been\r\n\"tipped off by the police at the Yards to clean out and keep away from\r\nthe usual hangouts because investigators were working out of Hoyne's\r\nand out of Brundage's offices, and were checking up on the activities\r\nof the 'Ragen's' during the riot.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreman of the August grand jury which investigated the riot cases\r\nsaid in testifying before the Commission:\r\n\r\n     The lead we got to investigate the Forty-seventh Street\r\n     district was from an anonymous letter stating that Ragen had\r\n     such influence in the Forty-seventh Street police station that\r\n     these individuals were allowed to go without due process of law.\r\n\r\n     I didn't believe that was a fact in this particular instance.\r\n     We did learn that Ragen was a great power in that district and\r\n     at the time of our investigation we learned that some of the\r\n     \"Ragen's Colts\" had broken into the police station and pried\r\n     open a door of a closet where they had a good deal of evidence\r\n     in the nature of weapons of prisoners concealed, and they got\r\n     all of this evidence out of there without the police knowing\r\n     anything about it.\r\n\r\nThe station referred to is at Forty-seventh and Halsted streets. Gangs\r\noperated for hours up and down Forty-seventh Street, Wells, Princeton,\r\nShields, and Wentworth avenues and Federal Street without hindrance from\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CROWDS ARMED WITH BRICKS SEARCHING FOR A NEGRO]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WHITES STONING NEGRO TO DEATH\r\n   Actual photograph of the killing of a Negro by the mob shown above\r\n   after chasing him into his home.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE\r\n   He was knocked from the stairway by a brick. Two men are here shown\r\n   hurling bricks at the dying Negro.]\r\n\r\nA judge of the municipal court said in testimony before the Commission:\r\n\"They seemed to think they had a sort of protection which entitled them\r\nto go out and assault anybody. When the race riots occurred it gave them\r\nsomething to satiate the desire to inflict their evil propensities on\r\nothers.\"\r\n\r\nBesides shouting as they rode down the streets in trucks that they\r\nwere out to \"get the niggers,\" they defied the law in other ways. When\r\nthe militia men came on the scene on the fourth day of the riot, they\r\ntestified to trouble with these gangsters. One of the colonels testified\r\nbefore the Commission: \"They didn't like to be controlled. They would\r\nload up heavy trucks with rowdies and try to force through the lines.\r\nThey'd come tooting their horns and having back pressure explosions like\r\ngatling guns.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the \"athletic club\" gangsters had criminal records. L---- W----\r\nwas accused of being one of the leaders of the gang around Forty-seventh\r\nand Wells streets. He himself said boastfully, \"I have been arrested\r\nabout fifteen times for 'disorderly' and never was arrested with a knife\r\nor a gun.\" Several witnesses said they had seen him during the riot\r\none night leading the mob and brandishing a razor and the next night\r\nwaving a gun. He was not arrested. D---- H----, seventeen years old,\r\nwas identified as being active in the rioting near Forty-seventh Street\r\nand Forrestville Avenue. His defense was that he was not closer to the\r\nNegro assaulted than across the street, but because he was arrested the\r\nyear before for a \"stick-up\" people looked \"funny\" at him when anything\r\nhappened. R---- C---- was accused of having been implicated in the arson\r\ncases on Shields Avenue. When his mother was interviewed, she said she\r\nknew nothing of the rioting, but said her son was at the time in the\r\ncounty jail, \"but not for that.\" W---- G---- was identified many times\r\nas having taken part in the arson on Wentworth Avenue. He was indicted\r\nfor both arson and conspiracy to riot. Two years before the riot he had\r\nbeen arrested for larceny.\r\n\r\nAll who discussed gangs before the Commission said that most of the\r\nmembers were boys of seventeen to twenty-two years of age. Witnesses\r\nbefore the coroner's juries testified to the youth of the participants\r\nin mobs. Many of the active assailants of street cars were boys. In the\r\ncase of the Negro Hardy who was killed on a street car, it was said that\r\nthe murderers were not over twenty years, and many were nearer sixteen.\r\nIn the raids in the Ogden Park district the participants were between\r\nthe ages of fifteen and twenty. The raid just west of Wentworth Avenue,\r\nwhere a number of houses were much damaged, was perpetrated by boys of\r\nthese ages. The attacking mob on Forty-third Street near Forrestville\r\nAvenue, was led by boys of eighteen to twenty-one. The only two hoodlums\r\ncaught participating in the outrages in the \"Loop,\" the downtown business\r\ndistrict, were seventeen and about twenty-one. Most of those arrested on\r\nsuspicion in the arson cases were taken before the boys' court. Negroes\r\ninvolved in many cases as assailants were also youthful. The young Negro\r\nboys who killed Lazzeroni were fourteen to eighteen; those who killed\r\nPareko and Perel were about sixteen.\r\n\r\nA member of \"Ragen's Colts\" is said to have boasted that their territory\r\nextended from Cottage Grove Avenue to Ashland Avenue and from Forty-third\r\nStreet to Sixty-third Street. At Sixty-third Street and Cottage Grove\r\nAvenue they were said to have attacked a colored man in a restaurant and\r\nthrown him out of the window. It was reported that trucks of a downtown\r\nstore, each carrying about thirty men, yelling that they were \"Ragen's\r\nColts\" and that \"Ragen's bunch\" were going to clean out the community,\r\ncame to Sixtieth Street and Racine Avenue. Some of the boys who took part\r\nin the assault upon Negroes at Sixtieth and Ada streets were reputed to\r\nbe members of \"Ragen's Colts.\" The club, according to some of its own\r\nmembers, operated with automobiles from which they managed to \"bump off\r\na number of Niggers.\" A truck driver said he had driven some \"Ragen's\r\nColts\" to Forty-seventh and Halsted streets, where they \"dropped\" four\r\nor five people, then he drove them back to the \"Ragen's Colts\" clubhouse\r\nat Fifty-second and Halsted streets. \"And,\" he says, \"they had plenty\r\nof guns and ammunition.\" State's Attorney Hoyne, however, said that no\r\nevidence could be found that \"Ragen's Colts\" had a store of arms. Members\r\nof the Illinois Reserve Militia reported that they had been threatened\r\nby \"Ragen's Colts\" that they would be picked off one by one when they\r\ngot off duty.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious cases of rioting in which members of \"Ragen's\r\nColts\" were reported to be implicated was the raid upon Shields Avenue,\r\nwhere there were nine houses occupied by Negroes. At 8:30 Tuesday evening\r\n200 or 300 gangsters started at one corner and worked through the block,\r\nthrowing furniture out of windows and setting fires. A white man who\r\nowned a house on this street which he rented to Negroes says that after\r\nthe raid several young men warned him, \"If you open your mouth against\r\n'Ragen's' we will not only burn your house down but we will 'do' you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lorraine Club, according to five witnesses, was also implicated in\r\narson and raids upon homes of Negroes. Their operations, according to\r\nreports, were on Forty-seventh Street and on Wells Street and Wentworth\r\nAvenue between Forty-seventh and Forty-eighth streets. Negroes were\r\nchased, guns were fired, windows broken, front doors smashed in, furniture\r\ndestroyed, and finally homes were burned. All Negro families were driven\r\nout. The attack was planned, and news of its imminence spread abroad in\r\nthe morning. Rioting started in the afternoon of July 29, and culminated\r\nlate that night. There was no interference from the police at any time.\r\nIt was said that one of the leaders of the gang who had an express and\r\ncoal yard carried away furniture in his wagon. Another was recognized\r\nas a youth who had shot a Negro woman during the afternoon. They are\r\nreported to have attacked an undertaker and friends who came to remove\r\nthe body of a dead Negro. Three of the rioters were arrested upon the\r\nidentification of several people, but two were released in the municipal\r\ncourt, and the third had a \"no bill\" returned before the grand jury.\r\nOne was released because no witnesses were present to prosecute him.\r\nThe witnesses said they were not notified.\r\n\r\nA member of the Lorraine Club denied that his club had anything to do\r\nwith this riot, but said it was Our Flag Club that did the \"dirty work.\"\r\nOur Flag Club is located farther east on Forty-seventh Street near Union\r\nAvenue. When John Mills was dragged from a street car at this point and\r\nkilled, a policeman recognized several of the club's members in the crowd,\r\nbut vouchsafed the opinion that they were not part of the aggressive\r\nmob, \"for they did not run as did the others when the patrol came down\r\nthe street.\" Another policeman said he had never had any trouble with\r\nthe club.\r\n\r\nEight members of the Sparklers' Club were seen at the fire at 5919\r\nWentworth Avenue, a building in which two Negro families lived. The\r\narson is reported to have been planned in a neighboring cigar store.\r\nOne of the boys put waste soaked in gasoline under the porch and ran.\r\nTwo of them threw oil in the building and two others lit it. It took\r\nthree attempts to make a fire at this place. Each time it was started\r\nthe Fire Department put it out. Two of the boys are declared to have\r\nstolen phonograph records and silverware from the house. A lad not a\r\nmember of the club was with them at the fire. Afterward one of the boys\r\nwarned him, \"Watch your dice and be careful or you won't see your home\r\nany more.\" Six boys were held for arson, in connection with this affair;\r\none was discharged in the boys' court, and the cases of two others were\r\nnolle prossed. In connection with their arrest the _Chicago Tribune_ of\r\nAugust 15, 1919, said:\r\n\r\n     Evidence that organized bands of white youths have been making a\r\n     business of burning Negro dwellings was said to have been handed\r\n     to Attorney General Brundage and Assistant State's Attorney\r\n     Irwin Walker.... Chief of Police Garrity, also informed of the\r\n     Fire Marshal's charges, declared several so-called athletic\r\n     clubs in the Stock Yards district may lose their charters as\r\n     a result.\r\n\r\nA report about the Aylward Club was to the effect that as the Negroes\r\ncame from the Stock Yards on Monday, a gang of its members armed with\r\nclubs was waiting for them and that each singled out a Negro and beat\r\nhim, the police looking on.\r\n\r\nThe names of a number of gang ringleaders were reported by investigators.\r\nFor illustration, L. Dennis, a Negro of 6059 Throop Street, was attacked\r\non the night of Monday, July 28, by a mob led by three roughs whose\r\nnames were learned and whose loafing place was at Sixty-third Street and\r\nRacine Avenue. A mob of thirty white men who shot Francis Green, Negro,\r\neighteen years old, at Garfield Boulevard and State Street had a club\r\nheadquarters in the vicinity of Fifty-fourth Street and their \"hangout\"\r\nwas at the corner of Garfield Boulevard and State Street.\r\n\r\nOther clubs mentioned in riot testimony before the coroner's jury, but\r\nnot in connection with riot clashes, are the Pine Club, the Hamburgers,\r\nthe Emeralds, the White Club, Favis Grey's, and the Mayflower. The\r\npolice closed the clubs for a period of several months after the riot.\r\nThere were then in existence a number of Negro gambling clubs, and the\r\nstate's attorney declared that it was the colored gamblers who \"started\r\nthis shooting and tearing around town,\" and that \"as soon as they heard\r\nthe news that the boy Williams was drowned, they filled three or four\r\nmachines and started out to shoot.\"\r\n\r\nA saloon-keeper near Wabash Avenue and Fifty-fifth Street, one of the\r\nleaders of these colored gamblers, was identified by a white woman as\r\nbeing in an automobile with five other Negroes exhorting colored men to\r\nriot after the drowning of Williams. The next day he was arrested in an\r\nautomobile with other colored men who were said to be shooting into the\r\nhomes of white people. They were arrested but were discharged by Judge\r\nBarasa at the Stock Yards court.\r\n\r\nPolice raids were made on some of the \"Black Belt\" clubs on August 23.\r\nAt the Ranier Club, 3010 South State Street, two revolvers, one razor,\r\none \"black-jack,\" seven cartridges, one cattle knife, and one ordinary\r\nknife were found. At the Pioneer Club, 3512 South State Street, eight\r\nguns, four packages of cartridges and twenty-four knives were taken.\r\nA raid at 2700 South State Street netted four guns, one hunting-knife,\r\nand fifty-eight cartridges and bullets.\r\n\r\nThe foreman of the grand jury which investigated the riots discussing\r\nthe \"athletic\" and \"social\" clubs before the Commission, said:\r\n\r\n     Most of them were closed immediately after the riots. There\r\n     were \"Ragen's Colts,\" as they were known, concerning whom\r\n     the grand jury were particularly anxious to get something\r\n     concrete, although no evidence was presented that convicted\r\n     any of the members of that club. There were the Hamburgers,\r\n     another athletic club, the Lotus Club, the Mayflower, and\r\n     various clubs. These were white clubs.\r\n\r\nAsked if they really were athletic clubs, he replied:\r\n\r\n     I think they are athletic only with their fists and brass\r\n     knuckles and guns. We had Mr. Ragen before the grand jury,\r\n     and he told us of the noble work that they were doing in the\r\n     district, that Father Brian, who had charge of these boys,\r\n     taught them to box and how to build themselves up physically,\r\n     and they were doing a most noble work, and you would think\r\n     that Ragen was a public benefactor. During the deliberations of\r\n     this grand jury a number of anonymous letters were written with\r\n     reference to \"Ragen's Colts,\" and most of the explanations of\r\n     the fact that they failed to put their names on these letters\r\n     were that they were afraid they would lose their lives.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury included in its report this reference to the gang and\r\nclub phase of the riot:\r\n\r\n     The authorities employed to enforce the law should thoroughly\r\n     investigate clubs and other organizations posing as athletic\r\n     and social clubs which really are organizations of hoodlums and\r\n     criminals formed for the purpose of furthering the interest\r\n     of local politics. In the opinion of this jury many of the\r\n     crimes committed in the \"Black Belt\" by whites and the fires\r\n     that were started back of the Yards, which, however, were\r\n     credited to the Negroes, were more than likely the work of the\r\n     gangs operating on the Southwest Side under the guise of these\r\n     clubs, and the jury believes that these fires were started\r\n     for the purpose of inciting race feeling by blaming same on\r\n     the blacks. These gangs have apparently taken an active part\r\n     in the race riots, and no arrests of their members have been\r\n     made as far as this jury is aware.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SCENES FROM FIRE IN IMMIGRANT NEIGHBORHOOD \"BACK OF THE\r\n   YARDS\"]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGROES UNDER PROTECTION OF POLICE LEAVING WRECKED HOUSE\r\n   IN RIOT ZONE]\r\n\r\nThe coroner's jury which conducted inquests into the thirty-eight riot\r\ndeaths said:\r\n\r\n     The suggestion has also been made that race hatred and tendency\r\n     to race rioting had its birth and was fostered in the numerous\r\n     social and athletic clubs made up of young men and scattered\r\n     throughout the city. We doubt this, but if in part true, it\r\n     calls for the inspection and control of such clubs. These\r\n     clubs are here, they are popular, they take the place of\r\n     the disappearing saloon and poolroom. Properly governed and\r\n     controlled, they should be encouraged and fostered and, when\r\n     necessary, disciplined.\r\n\r\n     Hoodlums are the nucleus of a mob--the young, idle, vicious,\r\n     and in many instances degenerate and criminal, impatient\r\n     of restraint of law, gather together, and when fortified\r\n     by sufficient numbers, start out on a mission of disorder,\r\n     law-breaking, destruction, and murder. Mobs, white or colored,\r\n     grow about a nucleus of this character.\r\n\r\n_Types of clashes._--Racial outbreaks are often characterized by hangings,\r\nburnings, and mutilations, and frequently the cause given for them\r\nis a reported Negro attack upon a white woman. None of these features\r\nappeared in the Chicago riot. An attempted hanging was reported by a\r\nwhite detective but was unsubstantiated. A report that Joseph Lovings,\r\none of the Negroes killed in the riot, was burned, was heralded abroad\r\nand even carried to the United States Senate, but it was false. The\r\ncoroner's physicians found no burns on his body.\r\n\r\nReports of assaults upon women were at no time mentioned or even hinted\r\nat as a cause of the Chicago riot, but after the disorder started reports\r\nof such crimes were published in the white and Negro press, but they\r\nhad no foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nOf the ten women wounded in the Chicago riot, seven were white, two\r\nwere Negroes, and the race of one is unknown. All but one of these ten\r\ninjuries appears to have been accidental. The exception was the case of\r\nRoxy Pratt, a Negro woman who, with her brother, was chased down Wells\r\nStreet from Forty-seventh by gangsters and was seriously wounded by a\r\nbullet. No cases of direct attacks upon white women by Negro men were\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nThe Commission has the record of numerous instances, principally during\r\nthe first twenty-four hours, where individuals of opposing races met,\r\nknives or guns were drawn, and injury was inflicted without the element\r\nof mob stimulus.\r\n\r\nOn Monday mobs operated in sudden, excited assaults, and attacks on\r\nstreet cars provided outstanding cases, five persons being killed and many\r\ninjured. Nicholas Kleinmark, a white assailant, was stabbed to death by\r\na Negro named Scott, acting in self-defense. Negroes killed were Henry\r\nGoodman at Thirtieth and Union streets; John Mills, on Forty-seventh\r\nStreet near Union; Louis Taylor at Root Street and Wentworth Avenue;\r\nand B. F. Hardy at Forty-sixth Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. All died\r\nfrom beatings.\r\n\r\nCrowds armed themselves with stones, bricks, and baseball bats and scanned\r\npassing street cars for Negroes. Finding them, trolleys were pulled off\r\nwires and entrance to the cars forced. Negroes were dragged from under\r\ncar seats and beaten. Once off the car the chase began. If possible,\r\nthe vanguard of the mob caught the fleeing Negroes and beat them with\r\nclubs. If the Negro outran the pursuers, stones and bricks brought him\r\ndown. Sometimes the chase led through back yards and over fences, but\r\nit was always short.\r\n\r\nAnother type of race warfare was the automobile raids carried on by young\r\nmen crowded in cars, speeding across the dead line at Wentworth Avenue\r\nand the \"Black Belt,\" and firing at random. Crowded colored districts,\r\nwith people sitting on front steps and in open windows, were subjected\r\nto this menace. Strangely enough, only one person was killed in these\r\nraids, Henry Baker, Negro.\r\n\r\nAutomobile raids were reported wherever colored people had established\r\nthemselves, in the \"Black Belt,\" both on the main business streets and\r\nin the residence sections, and in the small community near Ada and Loomis\r\nstreets in the vicinity of Ogden Park.\r\n\r\nThese raids began Monday night, continued spasmodically all day Tuesday,\r\nand were again prevalent that night. In spite of the long period, reports\r\nof motorcycle policemen show no white raiders arrested. One suspected\r\nraiding automobile was caught on State Street Tuesday night, after\r\ncollision with a patrol wagon. One of the occupants, a white man, had\r\non his person the badge and identification card of a policeman assigned\r\nto the Twenty-fourth Precinct. No case was worked up against him, and\r\nthe other men in the machine were not heard of again in connection with\r\nthe raid.\r\n\r\nMost of the police motorcycle squad was assigned to the Stanton Avenue\r\nstation, which was used as police headquarters in the \"Black Belt.\"\r\nSeveral automobile loads of Negroes were arrested, and firearms were\r\nfound either upon their persons or in the automobile.\r\n\r\nIn only two cases were Negroes aggressively rioting found outside of\r\nthe \"Black Belt.\" One of these was the case of the saloon-keeper already\r\nmentioned, and the other was that of a deputy sheriff, who, with a party\r\nof other men, said they were on the way to the Stock Yards to rescue\r\nsome beleaguered members of their race. It is reported that they wounded\r\nfive white people en route. Sheriff Peters said he understood that the\r\ndeputy sheriff was attacked by white mobs and fired to clear the crowd.\r\nHe was not convicted.\r\n\r\n\"Sniping\" was a form of retaliation by Negroes which grew out of the\r\nautomobile raids. These raiding automobiles were fired upon from yards,\r\nporches, and windows throughout the \"Black Belt.\" One of the most serious\r\ncases reported was at Thirty-first and State streets, where Negroes\r\nbarricaded the streets with rubbish boxes. Motorcycle Policeman Cheney\r\nrammed through and was hit by a bullet. His companion officer following\r\nwas knocked from his machine and the machine punctured with bullets.\r\n\r\nAfter the wounding of Policeman Cheney and Sergeant Murray, of the Sixth\r\nPrecinct, policemen made a thorough search of all Negro homes near the\r\nscene of the \"sniping.\" Thirty-four Negroes were arrested. Of these,\r\nten were discharged, ten were found not guilty, one was given one day in\r\njail, one was given five days in jail, one was fined and put on probation,\r\ntwo were fined $10 and costs, one was fined $25; six were given thirty\r\ndays each in the House of Correction, and one, who admitted firing twice\r\nbut said he was firing at one of the automobiles, was sentenced to six\r\nmonths in the House of Correction. His case was taken to the appellate\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nConcerted retaliatory race action showed itself in the Italian district\r\naround Taylor and Loomis streets when rumor said that a little Italian\r\ngirl had been killed or wounded by a shot fired by a Negro. Joseph\r\nLovings, an innocent Negro, came upon the excited crowd of Italians. There\r\nwas a short chase through back yards. Finally Lovings was dragged from\r\nhis hiding-place in a basement and brutally murdered by the crowd. The\r\ncoroner reported fourteen bullet wounds on his body, eight still having\r\nbullets in them; also various stab wounds, contusions of the head, and\r\nfractures of the skull. Rumor made the tale more hideous, saying that\r\nLovings was burned after gasoline had been poured over the dead body.\r\nThis was not true.\r\n\r\nThis same massing of race against race was shown in a similar clash\r\nbetween Italians and Negroes on the North Side. The results here, however,\r\nwere not serious. It was reported in this last case that immediately after\r\nthe fracas the Negroes and Italians were again on good terms. This was\r\nnot true in the neighborhood of the Lovings outrage. Miss Jane Addams, of\r\nHull-House, which is near the scene of Lovings' death, testified before\r\nthe Commission that before the riot the Italians held no particular\r\nanimosity toward Negroes, for those in the neighborhood were mostly from\r\nSouth Italy and accustomed to the dark-skinned races, but that they were\r\ndeveloping antipathy. In the September following the riot, she said the\r\nneighborhood was still full of wild stories so stereotyped in character\r\nthat they appeared to indicate propaganda spread for a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe gang which operated in the \"Loop\" was composed partly of soldiers and\r\nsailors in uniform; they were boys of from seventeen to twenty-two, out\r\nfor a \"rough\" time and using race prejudice as a shield for robbery. At\r\ntimes this crowd numbered 100. Its depredations began shortly after 2:00\r\nA.M. Tuesday. The La Salle Street railroad station was entered twice,\r\nand Negro men were beaten and robbed. About 3:00 A.M. activities were\r\ntransferred to Wabash Avenue. In the hunt for Negroes one restaurant was\r\nwrecked and the vandalism was continued in another restaurant where two\r\nNegroes were found. One was severely injured and the other was shot down.\r\nThe gangsters rolled the body into the gutter and turned the pockets\r\ninside out; they stood on the corner of Wabash Avenue and Adams Street\r\nand divided the spoils, openly boasting later of having secured $52, a\r\ndiamond ring, a watch, and a brooch.\r\n\r\nAttacks in the \"Loop\" continued as late as ten o'clock Tuesday morning,\r\nNegroes being chased through the streets and beaten. Warned by the\r\nPinkerton Detective Agency, business men with stores on Wabash Avenue\r\ncame to protect their property. The rioting was reported to the police\r\nby the restaurant men. Policemen rescued two Negroes that morning, but\r\nso many policemen had been concentrated in and near the \"Black Belt\"\r\nthat there were only a few patrolmen in the whole \"Loop\" district, and\r\nthese did not actively endeavor to cope with the mob. In the meantime\r\ntwo Negroes were killed and others injured, while property was seriously\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\nTuesday's raids marked the peak of daring during the riot, and their\r\nsubsidence was as gradual as their rise. For the next two days the\r\ngangs roamed the streets, intermittently attacking Negro homes. After\r\nTuesday midnight their operations were not so open or so concerted. The\r\nriot gradually decreased in feeling and scope till the last event of a\r\nserious nature occurred, the incendiary fires back of the Stock Yards.\r\n\r\nWhile there is general agreement that these fires were incendiary, no\r\nclue could be found to the perpetrators. Negroes were suspected, as all\r\nthe houses burned belonged to whites. In spite of this fact, and the\r\ntestimony of thirteen people who said they saw Negroes in the vicinity\r\nbefore or during the fires, a rumor persisted that the fires were set by\r\nwhite people with blackened faces. One of the men living in the burned\r\ndistrict who testified to seeing a motor truck filled with Negroes said,\r\nwhen asked about the color of the men, \"Sure, I know they were colored.\r\nOf course I don't know whether they were painted.\" An early milk-wagon\r\ndriver said that he saw Negroes come out of a barn on Forty-third Street\r\nand Hermitage Avenue. Immediately afterward the barn burst into flames.\r\nHe ran to a policeman and reported it. The policeman said he was \"too\r\nbusy\" and \"it is all right anyway.\" One of the colonels commanding a\r\nregiment of militia said he thought white people with blackened faces had\r\nset fire to the houses; he got this opinion from talking to the police\r\nin charge of that district.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary McDowell, of the University of Chicago Settlement, which is\r\nlocated back of the Yards, said in testimony before the Commission:\r\n\r\n     I don't think the Negroes did burn the houses. I think the\r\n     white hoodlums burned them. The Negroes weren't back there,\r\n     they stayed at home after that Monday. When we got hold of\r\n     the firemen confidentially, they said no Negroes set fire to\r\n     them at all, but the newspapers said so and the people were\r\n     full of fear. All kinds of mythical stories were afloat for\r\n     some time.\r\n\r\nThe general superintendent of Armour & Company was asked, when testifying\r\nbefore the Commission, if he knew of any substantial reason why Negroes\r\nwere accused of setting fires back of the Yards. He answered:\r\n\r\n     That statement was originated in the minds of a few individuals,\r\n     radicals. It does not exist in the minds of the conservative\r\n     and thinking people of the community, even those living in\r\n     back of the Yards. They know better. I believe it goes without\r\n     saying that there isn't a colored man, regardless of how\r\n     little brains he'd have, who would attempt to go over into the\r\n     Polish district and set fire to anybody's house over there.\r\n     He wouldn't get that far.\r\n\r\nThe controlling superintendent of Swift & Company said he could not\r\nsay it from his own experience, but he understood there was as much\r\nfriction between the Poles and Lithuanians who worked together in the\r\nYards as between the Negroes and the whites. The homes burned belonged\r\nto Lithuanians. The grand jury stated in its report: \"The jury believes\r\nthat these fires were started for the purpose of inciting race feeling\r\nby blaming same on the blacks.\"\r\n\r\nThe methods of attack used by Negroes and whites during the riot differed;\r\nthe Negroes usually clung to individual attack and the whites to mob\r\naction. Negroes used chiefly firearms and knives, and the whites used\r\ntheir fists, bricks, stones, baseball bats, pieces of iron, hammers.\r\nAmong the white men, 69 per cent were shot or stabbed and 31 per cent\r\nwere beaten; among the Negroes almost the reverse was true, 35 per cent\r\nbeing shot and stabbed and 65 per cent beaten. A colonel in charge of\r\na regiment of militia on riot duty says they found few whites but many\r\nNegroes armed.\r\n\r\n_Arms and ammunition._--The foregoing figures and statements gave some\r\ncolor to the belief persistent during and after the riot that Negroes\r\nhad stores of arms and ammunition. A lieutenant of police testified\r\nbefore the coroner's jury that he had known in advance that the riot was\r\ncoming because \"there were guns in every house out there; I knew they\r\nwere there for a purpose.\" He said he had heard that Negroes had been\r\nadvised to arm themselves and defend their homes, that the Constitution\r\nof the United States provided for that. The state's attorney said before\r\nthe Commission that prior to the riot he had received reports from\r\ndetectives of private agencies stating the same thing. He was informed\r\nthat Negroes readily got firearms from Gary, Indiana, and that porters\r\non the Pullman trains brought them in from outside places. He further\r\nstated: \"I am very definitely assured of the fact that they were arming\r\nand that there were more arms and weapons grouped in that general district\r\nloosely termed the 'Black Belt' than any place else, and my information\r\nis that conditions are that way now.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the riot there were frequent rumors that Negroes had broken into\r\nthe Eighth Regiment Armory for guns and ammunition, but all these rumors\r\nwere proved false.\r\n\r\nSince the riot many tales have been told of stores of arms brought in by\r\nPullman porters and by white prostitutes. Mexicans were reported to be\r\nassisting Negroes in the manufacture of bombs and hand grenades. Lists\r\nof addresses where ammunition was being stored have been gathered by\r\ndetectives, but not verified.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of rumors are found circulating among the Negroes in regard\r\nto the arming of whites. It is said that such and such white men have\r\ngreat boxes of guns and ammunition in the cellars of their homes, and\r\nthat white men are forming shooting clubs for the purpose of attacking\r\nNegroes in the event of another riot. There are also widely believed\r\nstories that a department store sold guns to white people before the\r\nriot but refused to sell to Negroes. It was said that pawn shops sold\r\nto white people without permits from the police.\r\n\r\n_Crowds and mobs._--It may be observed that a crowd is merely a gathering\r\nof people while a mob is a crowd with its attention so strongly fixed\r\nupon some lawless purpose that other purposes are inhibited and it\r\nacts along the line of the one purpose. During the riot many crowds of\r\ncuriosity seekers were transformed into vicious mobs when exciting rumors\r\ncirculated and the suggestion of vengeance was made by leaders. Such\r\nsuggestion was frequently accompanied by some daring act, stimulated by\r\nthe excitement.\r\n\r\nThe mob in its entirety usually did not participate actively. It was\r\none in spirit, but divided in performance into a small active nucleus\r\nand a large proportion of spectators. The nucleus was composed of young\r\nmen from sixteen to twenty-one or twenty-two years of age. Sometimes\r\nonly four would be active while fifty or 150 looked on, but at times\r\nthe proportion would be as great as twenty-five in 200 or fifty in 300.\r\nFifty is the largest number reported for a mob nucleus. This was in the\r\ncase of John Mills and five other Negroes who were beaten, dragged off\r\na Forty-seventh Street car and chased, Mills being killed. Here there\r\nwere three degrees of crowd formation. First came the nucleus of fifty\r\nactive men who did the beating, chasing, and killing. Closely aiding\r\nand abetting them were 300 or 400 others. After the Negroes had been\r\nforced off the car and were being hunted through the neighborhood a\r\ncrowd of about 2,000 gathered and followed the vanguard of attackers and\r\nspectators. These were present out of morbid curiosity, but sufficiently\r\nimbued with the spirit of the mob not to interfere with the outrages.\r\n\r\nThe fact that children were frequently a part of mobs is one of the\r\nthought-provoking facts of the Chicago riot. Psychologists say that\r\nimpressions made upon the child mind are forces which mold adult character\r\nto a great extent. A number of children, some not more than four or\r\nfive years old, swarmed in front of the Forty-seventh Street car in the\r\nJohn Mills case and effectively blocked it while men climbed aboard and\r\nsought out the Negroes. Children, often witnesses of mob brutality, ran\r\nto where Negro victims had fallen and pointed them out to the policemen\r\nwho came up after the mobs had dispersed.\r\n\r\nThere were others, still children in mind, Negro boys of fifteen, accused\r\nof murders. The enormity of their acts faded in the joy of describing\r\ntheir weapons. \"Fat had a club; it looked like a police club,\" said one,\r\n\"it had leather on it.\" \"And the gun had a little picture of an owl on\r\nthe side of it,\" said another describing a patched-up weapon that brought\r\ndown a white laboring-man who left a widow and eight children.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SCENES FROM FIRE IN IMMIGRANT NEIGHBORHOOD \"BACK OF THE\r\n   YARDS\"]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SCENE FROM FIRE IN IMMIGRANT NEIGHBORHOOD \"BACK OF THE\r\n   YARDS\"]\r\n\r\nAmong the spectators of mob violence were men, women, and children of\r\nall ages; they included tradesmen, craftsmen, salesmen, laborers. Though\r\nthe spectators did not commit the crimes, they must share the moral\r\nresponsibility. Without the spectators mob violence would probably have\r\nstopped short of murder in many cases. An example of the behavior of\r\nthe active nucleus when out of sight of the spectators bears this out.\r\nGeorge Carr, Negro, was chased from a street car. He outstripped all but\r\nthe vanguard of the mob by climbing fences and hiding in a back yard.\r\nThis concealed him from the rest of the crowd, who by that time were\r\nchasing other Negroes. The young men who followed Carr left him without\r\nstriking a blow, upon his mere request for clemency. In regard to the\r\nlarge non-active elements in the crowds, the coroner said during the\r\ninquest, \"It is just the swelling of crowds of that kind that urges them\r\non, because they naturally feel that they are backed up by the balance\r\nof the crowd, which may not be true, but they feel that way.\" Juror\r\nWare said, \"If sightseers were lending their aid and assistance--\" Juror\r\nDillon interrupted and finished, \"they ought to be punished.\"\r\n\r\nOften the \"sightseers\" and even those included in the nucleus did not\r\nknow why they had taken part in crimes the viciousness of which was not\r\napparent to them until afterward. A mere attempt to cover up participation\r\nwould have called forth excuses in testimony, but their answers show\r\nirritation at the questioning, an inability to appreciate the situation,\r\nor complete bewilderment. These excerpts from the testimony before the\r\ncoroner's jury are examples:\r\n\r\nHenry Woodman, in the mob at Sixtieth and Ada streets: \"I don't know.\r\nI didn't have any grudge against them [the Negroes]. But they [the mob]\r\nseemed to have it in for the colored people. That is all.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Klose, in the mob in front of 1021 South State Street: \"I followed\r\nthe crowd, and I was in there because I was in there; they all bunched\r\naround and what could I do?\"\r\n\r\nOne of the boys in the mob at Forty-third Street and Forrestville Avenue:\r\n\"I just wanted to see how things were getting along. We wanted to see\r\nwhat the riot looked like.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of this same crowd: \"I was following the rest. I wanted to see\r\nwhat they were going to do.\"\r\n\r\nAnother from the same mob: \"When they started to grab them [the Negroes]\r\nin the lot, I rushed over directly to the conflict, by the colored men,\r\nthinking I would see more on that side.\"\r\n\r\nMobs got under way for the commission of atrocities by having the direct\r\nsuggestion put to them by one of the leaders. With minds already prepared\r\nby rumors circulating wherever crowds gathered, it was easy to arouse\r\naction. A street car approaching and the cry, \"Get the niggers!\" was\r\nenough. Prompt action clinched the idea, and the emotion of the attack\r\nnarrowed the field of consciousness. War cries aided in keeping emotion\r\nat fever heat. \"Get the nigger!\" \"Kill the black ---- of a ----!\" \"Kill\r\nhim!\" These were always an incident of mob action.\r\n\r\nCounter-suggestion was not tolerated when the mob was rampant. A\r\nsuggestion of clemency was shouted down with the derisive epithet,\r\n\"Nigger lover!\" Silenced objectors made no further effort to thwart mob\r\naction. There are no records of such persons notifying the police or\r\npersisting in their remonstrances. Those whose objections took the form\r\nof action against the mob met with violence. A white man, an instructor\r\nin music at the University of Chicago, saw several white men attack a\r\nNegro who was waiting for a street car at Sixty-third Street and Cottage\r\nGrove Avenue. Without trying verbal remonstrance he struck out at them.\r\nHis glasses were knocked off, and he was thrown into the middle of the\r\nstreet and left unconscious.\r\n\r\nNot only did action once under way make interference hazardous, but\r\nit brought into the mob circle a greater number of participants and\r\nincreased its energy. Five men jerked a trolley from the wires; ten men\r\nboarded the car; twenty-five men chased and beat the routed Negroes. The\r\nmob action grew faster than the increase in numbers. Ideas suggested by\r\nindividual members were quickly carried out in the action of all. The\r\nmob as a whole and the individuals in it increased in fury, and a normal\r\nstreet crowd was often turned from peaceful assemblage to brutal murder.\r\n\r\nA sharp diversion of attention sometimes caused the dispersal of mobs. An\r\nunexpected revolver shot was the most effective means of such diversion.\r\nHere are some instances:\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Joshua, a Negro boy, was shot by Police Lieutenant Day,\r\na throng of Negroes came on the run from State Street. The officers,\r\nterrified, escaped in a taxi, leaving their own automobile behind. The\r\nmob attempted to make this car suffer vicariously for the escaped police\r\nofficers. Other policemen on the scene had difficulty in holding them\r\nback. Two shots were heard on Federal Street. Immediately the crowd ceased\r\nits clamoring, left the automobile, and apparently lost all thought of\r\nLieutenant Day and ran to Federal Street.\r\n\r\nIn the first mob of the riot, that at Twenty-ninth Street and Cottage\r\nGrove Avenue, Negroes and policemen were struggling in a mass in the\r\nmiddle of the street. A shot was fired by James Crawford, and the mob\r\ndispersed from that corner.\r\n\r\nA mob chased a Negro off a street car on Thirty-ninth Street near Wallace.\r\nA policeman with presence of mind followed the group into the alley,\r\nfired a few shots in the air, and the crowd ran.\r\n\r\nIn no case where an unexpected shot was fired did it fail to scatter the\r\nmob, but shooting which was part of the mob's own action did not seem\r\nto have the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe course of one riotous mob can be traced in the activities of a certain\r\ngroup of five white boys who linked up with the riot excitement. They\r\nmet at the corner of Sixty-third Street and Ingleside Avenue at 8:30\r\nMonday evening. While they were trying to decide which movie to attend,\r\na taxi driver informed them of a riot at Forty-seventh Street. They took\r\nthe \"L\" to Forty-seventh Street and joined the mob. From then until 2:00\r\nA.M. they were active in mobs which assaulted Negroes at several points.\r\nTwo were beaten at Forty-seventh Street and the elevated railway. The\r\nmob then proceeded to Fifty-first Street, but the police drove it back\r\nand it moved on to Indiana Avenue and Forty-third Street, where a deputy\r\nsheriff held it off. Returning here later it attacked a street car, beat\r\na Negro, and then moved south on Indiana Avenue, jerking trolleys from\r\nwires and assaulting passengers. At Forty-fifth Street a shot fired by\r\na police sergeant scattered it toward Forty-third Street.\r\n\r\nThere the mob met Lieutenant Washington, a Negro ex-soldier, who, with\r\nfive Negro companions, was obliged to walk across town because car service\r\nhad been discontinued on account of the rioting. Lieutenant Washington,\r\ntestifying before the coroner's jury, gave this account of the affair:\r\n\r\n     After we crossed Grand Boulevard I heard a yell, \"One, two,\r\n     three, four, five, six,\" and then they gave a loud cheer and\r\n     said, \"Everybody, let's get the niggers! Let's get the niggers,\"\r\n     and we noticed some of them crossed the street and walked on\r\n     up even with us. The rest of them were about ten or fifteen\r\n     feet north ... there were about between four and six men ...\r\n     crossed the street and got in front of us ... just before we\r\n     got to Forrestville Avenue, about twenty yards, they swarmed\r\n     in on us.\r\n\r\nAfter this attack, in which Lieutenant Browning was shot, and Clarence\r\nMetz, a white boy, was killed by a stab wound inflicted by Lieutenant\r\nWashington in self-defense, the mob moved on to Grand Boulevard, preceded\r\nby the rumor that it intended to attack the homes of Negroes. A shot from\r\na house grazed a white lad, and the crowd went on, leaving the police\r\nto come and arrest the Negroes who had fired.\r\n\r\nMob action in planned attacks was more daring, but not more dangerous.\r\nRobbery was occasionally an accompaniment of spontaneous attack, but arson\r\nnever. Whether or not some of the organized raids could readily have\r\nbeen stopped by the police, and the mobs dispersed, remains unproved.\r\nNo attempt was made either in the \"Loop\" district, in the Forty-seventh\r\nand Wells streets districts or in the Sixty-ninth and Elizabeth streets\r\ndistrict to check the depredations.\r\n\r\n_Rumor._--Rumor was often the first step in crowd formation and often\r\nopened the way for the sharp transformation of a crowd into a mob. The\r\ncirculation of rumors was partly due to natural repetition, often with\r\nincreasing embellishment, by one person to another of what he had heard\r\nor read. The desire to tell a \"big story\" and create a sensation was no\r\ndoubt an important factor. With so much bitter feeling there was also\r\nconsiderable conscious effort to provoke vengeful animosity by telling\r\nthe worst that the teller had heard or could imagine about the doings\r\nof the opposite race. The latter type of rumor circulation especially\r\nfed the riot from the beginning to the final clash. It continues to be\r\na constant menace to the friendly relations of the races.\r\n\r\nNewspapers were often supplied a source of rumor material through mistake\r\nin fundamental facts, due either to misinformation or exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIn considering the newspaper handling of riot news, it should be borne in\r\nmind that the task was most difficult during a period of such excitement\r\nand such crowding of events. Further it must be considered that white\r\nreporters might very justifiably avoid the risk of seeking news where\r\ncrowds of Negroes had been roused to a high pitch of resentment against\r\nwhites. There were doubtless instances in which news was secured from\r\nsources ordinarily trustworthy, but inaccurate during the riot. On the\r\nother hand, it must be recognized that in a time of such excitement the\r\neffect of sensational news on the popular mind is generally accentuated,\r\nand the responsibility for careful handling of news is correspondingly\r\ngreater. Where bias is as pronounced as in a race riot it is of the\r\nutmost importance that essential facts be stated correctly.\r\n\r\n                                  TABLE I\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n                        | NUMBER OF INJURED  |FACTS AS LATER OBTAINED FROM\r\n                        | AS REPORTED BY THE | POLICE, STATE'S ATTORNEY,\r\n                        |   \"TRIBUNE\" AND    |HOSPITAL REPORTS, AND OLIVET\r\n           DATE         | \"HERALD-EXAMINER\"  |  BAPTIST CHURCH, COVERING\r\n                        |  DURING THE FIRST  |          EACH DAY\r\n                        | FOUR DAYS OF RIOT  |\r\n                        +------+------+------+------+------+-------+------\r\n                        | White| Negro| Total| White| Negro|Unknown| Total\r\n  ----------------------+-------------------------------------------------\r\n  July 27               |   29 |   19 |   48 |   10 |   31 |    5  |   46\r\n  July 28               |   64 |   60 |  124 |   71 |  152 |    6  |  229\r\n  July 29               |   62 |   72 |  134 |   55 |   80 |    4  |  139\r\n  July 30               |   40 |   21 |   61 |   20 |   20 |    2  |   42\r\n                        +------+------+------+------+------+-------+------\r\n    Total               |  195 |  172 |  367 |  156 |  283 |   17  |  456\r\n                        +------+------+------+------+------+-------+------\r\n    Percentage of total |   53 |   47 |  100 |   34 |   62 |    4  |  100\r\n  ----------------------+------+------+------+------+------+-------+------\r\n\r\nReports of numbers of dead and injured tended to produce a feeling that\r\nthe score must be evened up on the basis of \"an eye for an eye,\" a Negro\r\nfor a white, or vice versa. A most unfortunate impression may be made\r\nupon an excited public, Negro and white, by such erroneous reporting\r\nas the following, in which newspapers, although they understated rather\r\nthan exaggerated the number of injuries, reported that 6 per cent more\r\nwhites were injured than Negroes, when the fact was that 28 per cent\r\nmore Negroes were injured than whites.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ of July 29 in a news item said that before 3:00 A.M.,\r\nJuly 29, twenty persons had been killed, of whom thirteen were white\r\nand seven colored. The truth was that of twenty killed, seven were white\r\nand thirteen colored.[7]\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ of July 29 gave the starting-point of the riot as the\r\nAngelus clash, referring to it as \"the center of the trouble.\" The same\r\nitem mentioned the spread to the Stock Yards district. The fact was\r\nthat the assault upon street cars in the Stock Yards district Monday\r\nafternoon and rumors of further brutalities there helped to start the\r\nAngelus riot Monday evening.[8]\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ of July 30 stated that \"the Black Belt continues to be\r\nthe center of conflict.\" Up to July 30 the \"Black Belt\" had witnessed\r\n120 injuries, while the district west of Wentworth Avenue had had 139.\r\nFor the entire riot period the \"Black Belt\" furnished 34 per cent of the\r\ntotal number of injuries, and the district west of Wentworth Avenue 41\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nExaggeration in news reports, when popular excitement is at a high pitch,\r\nis peculiarly dangerous. For the very reason that the essential fact\r\nseems authenticated by the simultaneous appearance of the gist of the\r\nreport in several papers, the individual reader is the more inclined to\r\nbelieve such exaggerations as may appear in his favorite journal.\r\n\r\nCases of exaggeration could be adduced from every Chicago newspaper,\r\nbut a typical one is the report in the _Chicago Daily News_ of July 29\r\nconcerning the killing of Harold Brignadello, white. This item said:\r\n\r\n     Four women and nine men are held at the South Clark Street\r\n     Station after their arrest at 1021 South State Street, where\r\n     they had a formidable arsenal.\r\n\r\n     Harry Signadell [_sic_], 35, white, died on the way to St.\r\n     Luke's Hospital shortly before noon after his bullet-riddled\r\n     body had been picked up by the police in front of 1021 South\r\n     State Street, where a colored woman and 20 other Negroes had\r\n     barricaded themselves and were shooting at all whites who\r\n     passed the place.\r\n\r\n     Other persons arrested included Kate Elder, 26 years old, who\r\n     gave her home as the State Street address. In all, four women\r\n     and nine men were made prisoners at the raid on the place\r\n     which was found to be an arsenal for the Negro rioters. Two\r\n     revolvers, two rifles, an axe, several knives, and several\r\n     hundred rounds of ammunition, including 38 and 48 [_sic_]\r\n     calibre cartridges, were discovered piled up near the window\r\n     from which the Negroes had been shooting.\r\n\r\n     Patrolman John Hayes, of the South Clark Street Station, heard\r\n     the shots fired by the Negroes who were firing from the house\r\n     and saw the spurts of fire from their rifles and revolvers\r\n     whenever whites ventured to pass the place. An unknown white\r\n     man, a victim of the Negroes' bullets, was found lying on the\r\n     sidewalk. He was rushed to St. Luke's Hospital where he died.\r\n\r\nThe facts of this case, as reported by the coroner's jury are as follows:\r\n\r\n     ... Harold Brignadello ... came to his death on the 29th day\r\n     of July, A.D. 1919, at St. Luke's Hospital from shock and\r\n     hemorrhage due to a bullet wound in the chest cavity.\r\n\r\n     [NOTE.--\"a bullet wound,\" not \"bullet-riddled.\"]\r\n\r\n     We find the deceased while standing at the southwest corner\r\n     of State and Taylor ... was shot and wounded by a bullet fired\r\n     from the revolver held in the hand of one Emma Jackson who was\r\n     standing at an open window on the second floor of the premises\r\n     at 1021 South State Street.\r\n\r\n     Testimony shows that just prior to the shooting, said premises\r\n     had been stoned by a mob of white men.\r\n\r\n     We, the jury, recommend that the said Emma Jackson, said Kate\r\n     Elder, said John Webb, said Ed. Robinson, and said Clarence\r\n     Jones be held to the grand jury upon a charge of murder until\r\n     discharged by due process of law.\r\n\r\n     [NOTE.--Two women and three men, not \"four women and nine\r\n     men,\" nor yet \"a colored woman and 20 other Negroes.\" They\r\n     were indicted by the grand jury but found not guilty.]\r\n\r\n     We believe from the evidence that the police have sufficient\r\n     information as to the identity of some of said white men to\r\n     warrant arrest, and we recommend such action be taken.\r\n\r\n     [NOTE.--No arrests of men in the white mob were made.]\r\n\r\nThe testimony further showed that there were 150 white men in the mob\r\ngrouped in front of 1021, and four of the men were stoning the house at\r\nthe time Emma Jackson fired into their midst.\r\n\r\nOnly one gun was found and no stores of ammunition, instead of \"a\r\nformidable arsenal,\" or a \"barricade\" or \"an arsenal for Negro rioters,\"\r\nor \"two revolvers, two rifles, an axe, several knives, and several hundred\r\nrounds of ammunition, including 38 and 48 [_sic_] calibre cartridges ...\r\npiled up near the window from which the Negroes had been shooting.\" The\r\none gun was hidden in a niche in the skylight.\r\n\r\nFollowing are examples of rumors current during the riot and disseminated\r\nby the press and by word of mouth, grouped on the basis of the emotions\r\nwhich they aroused--vengeful animosity, fear, anger, and horror:\r\n\r\n_Daily News_, July 30. Subheadline: \"Alderman Jos. McDonough Tells How\r\nHe Was Shot at on South Side Visit. Says Enough Ammunition in Section\r\nto Last for Years of Guerrilla Warfare\":\r\n\r\n[NOTE.--The reference in the headline to the large amount of ammunition\r\nis repeated in the text, but not elaborated or explained.]\r\n\r\n     An alderman in an account of his adventures says the Mayor\r\n     contemplates opening up 35th and 47th streets in order that\r\n     colored people might get to their work. He thinks this would\r\n     be most unwise for, he states, \"They are armed and the white\r\n     people are not. We must defend ourselves if the city authorities\r\n     won't protect us.\" Continuing his story, he describes bombs\r\n     going off, \"I saw white men and women running through the\r\n     streets dragging children by the hands and carrying babies in\r\n     their arms. Frightened white men told me the police captains\r\n     had just rushed through the district crying, 'For God's sake,\r\n     arm. They are coming, we cannot hold them.'\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WRECKED HOUSE OF A NEGRO FAMILY IN RIOT ZONE]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGROES AND WHITES LEAVING THE STOCK YARDS]\r\n\r\nThe point here is not whether the alderman was correctly quoted, but the\r\neffect on the public of such statements attributed to him. There is no\r\nrecord in any of the riot testimony in the coroner's office or in the\r\nstate's attorney's office of any bombs exploded during the riot, nor\r\nof police captains warning white people to arm, nor of any fear on the\r\npart of whites of a Negro invasion. In the Berger Odman case before the\r\ncoroner's jury there is a statement that a police sergeant warned the\r\nNegroes of Ogden Park to arm and to shoot at the feet of rioters if they\r\nattempted to invade the few blocks marked off for Negroes by the police.\r\n\r\n_Herald-Examiner_, July 28. Subheadline: \"Negroes Have Arms\":\r\n\r\n     A man whose name is withheld reported to the _Herald-Examiner_\r\n     that Negroes had more than 2,000 Springfield rifles and an\r\n     adequate supply of soft-nosed bullets. R. R. Jackson, alderman\r\n     from the second ward, brands the story as untrue.\r\n\r\nThis statement is not substantiated.\r\n\r\n_Herald-Examiner_, July 29:\r\n\r\n     Several thousand men stoned the old Eighth Regiment Armory in\r\n     the heart of the riot zone, doors were burst in, and hundreds\r\n     of guns with ammunition taken by the mob. Police rushed to\r\n     the scene firing into the mob and finally drove it from the\r\n     armory. According to reports more than 50 persons were shot\r\n     or otherwise injured.\r\n\r\nRefutation of this statement is found in the testimony of Police Captain\r\nMullen before the coroner's jury in the Eugene Williams case:\r\n\r\n     I received a rumor that the soldiers [referring to Negro\r\n     soldiers of the Eighth Regiment] had gone over to the armory\r\n     for the sole purpose of breaking in and getting rifles. I\r\n     dispatched two patrol wagons full of men; after arriving there,\r\n     we found out they had been there and broke some windows, but\r\n     they found out there were no weapons in there.\r\n\r\nAnother type of fear-provoking rumor current in street crowds reported\r\nthe force and the aggressive plans of the opposing race. Some of these\r\nrumors, current among Negro crowds, were to the effect that a white mob\r\nwas gathering on Wentworth Avenue ready to break into the \"Black Belt\";\r\nthat a white mob was waiting to break through at Sixtieth and Ada streets;\r\nthat a white mob was ready to advance upon Twenty-seventh and Dearborn\r\nstreets. The first of these rumors had its effect upon the inception of\r\nthe Angelus riot, and the second so aroused the fears of Negroes that\r\nwhen a white mob led by young white boys did step over the \"dead-line\"\r\nboundaries established by the police, guns were immediately turned upon\r\nthem, and one of the invaders was killed. Of the third rumor, Police\r\nLieutenant Burns said:\r\n\r\n     ... an old colored man came to me ... and said that the colored\r\n     people on Dearborn Street in the 2800 block were moving out in\r\n     fear of a white mob coming from across the tracks from across\r\n     Wentworth Avenue.... On the southwest corner of Twenty-eighth\r\n     and Dearborn I found a number of colored men standing in\r\n     front of a building there. They had pieces of brick and stone\r\n     in their pockets and were peering around the corner west on\r\n     Twenty-eighth Street apparently in great fear.\r\n\r\nAmong the whites fear was not so prevalent. A fear-producing rumor was\r\nrevealed, however, in the examination of two deputy sheriffs who fired\r\non a Negro. The deputies had heard that Negroes were going to burn up\r\nor blow up factories in the district which they were patrolling. When\r\na dark form was seen in an alley, panic seized both deputies, and they\r\nemptied their revolvers at an innocent Negro who lived in the adjoining\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nChief among the anger-provoking rumors were tales of injury done to\r\nwomen of the race circulating the rumor. The similarity of the stories\r\nand their persistence shows extraordinary credulity on the part of the\r\npublic. For the most horrible of these rumors, telling of the brutal\r\nkilling of a woman and baby (sometimes the story is told of a Negro\r\nwoman, sometimes of a white) there was no foundation in fact. The story\r\nwas circulated not only by the newspapers of both races, but was current\r\nalways in the crowds on the streets. Here is the story as told in the\r\nwhite press:\r\n\r\n_Chicago Tribune_, July 29:\r\n\r\n     There is an account of \"two desperate revolver battles fought\r\n     by the police with colored men alleged to have killed two\r\n     white women and a white child.\"\r\n\r\n     It is reported that policemen saw two Negroes knock down a\r\n     woman and child and kick them. The Negroes ran before the\r\n     police could reach them.\r\n\r\n_Herald-Examiner_, July 29:\r\n\r\n     Two white women, one of them with a baby in her arms, were\r\n     attacked and wounded by Negro mobs firing on street cars....\r\n\r\n     A colored woman with a baby in her arms was reported at the\r\n     Deering Police Station, according to this item, to have been\r\n     attacked by a mob of more than 100 white men. When the mob\r\n     finally fled before the approach of a squad of police both the\r\n     woman and child were lying in the street beaten to death, \"it\r\n     is said.\"\r\n\r\n_Daily News_, July 29:\r\n\r\n     Another man is held at the Stock Yards station charged with the\r\n     murder of a white woman in West 47th Street and Wentworth....\r\n\r\n     The Negroes, four in number, were arrested at East 39th and\r\n     Cottage Grove Avenue, this afternoon by the detective. They are\r\n     believed to be the ones who seriously wounded Mrs. Margaret\r\n     Kelley, white woman, at W. 47th and Wentworth. She was shot\r\n     in the back and may die. The names of those under arrest were\r\n     not given out.\r\n\r\n     [NOTE.--\"Murder\" changed to \"seriously injured\" in the main\r\n     story. Mrs. Mary Kelly was shot in the arm according to the\r\n     police report and not in the back.]\r\n\r\nThe men arrested for the shooting were Henry Harris and Scott Brown,\r\ndeputy sheriffs, and four others according to the records of the state's\r\nattorney. Sheriff Peters says of the case, that Harris was charged with\r\nshooting someone, but when the case came up the charge was dropped.\r\nSheriff Peters was convinced that Harris was innocent.\r\n\r\n_Daily News_, July 29. Headline, given place of first importance in the\r\npink section: \"Women Shot as Riots Grow.\" Columns 7 and 8 of first-page\r\nwhite section are headed, \"Attack White Women as Race Riots Grow. Death\r\nRoster Is 30.\"\r\n\r\nThe item reads: \"Race rioters began to attack white women this afternoon\r\naccording to report received at the Detective Bureau and the Stock\r\nYards Police Station.\" The article continues, that Swift & Company had\r\nnot received any such reports of attacks on their women employees. But\r\nfarther on the item gives an account of a Swift & Company truck filled\r\nwith girl employees fired upon by Negroes at Forty-seventh Street and\r\nthe Panhandle railroad. The driver was reported killed and several of\r\nthe girls injured.\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of \"Death roster is 30\" and \"Attack white women\"\r\ngives a wrong impression. The \"several girls injured\" at Forty-seventh\r\nStreet evidently refers to the case of Mrs. Mary Kelly. The records of\r\nthe state's attorney's office also show that Josephine Mansfield was\r\nsupposed to have been wounded by Harris, _et al._, but the charge was\r\ndropped. She was wounded in the shoulder, according to the police report.\r\n\r\n_Daily News_, July 30:\r\n\r\n     Alderman McDonough described a raid into the white district the\r\n     night before by a carload of colored men who passed Thirty-fifth\r\n     Street and Wallace \"shouting and shooting.\" The gunmen shot\r\n     down a woman and a little boy who stood close by.\r\n\r\n     [NOTE.--No record of such a case.]\r\n\r\nHere is the \"injury done to women\" story as it appeared in the Negro press:\r\n\r\n_Chicago Defender_, August 2:\r\n\r\n     An unidentified young woman and three-months-old baby were\r\n     found dead on the street at the intersection of Forty-seventh\r\n     and Wentworth. She had attempted to board a car there when\r\n     the mob seized her, beat her, slashed her body to ribbons,\r\n     and beat the baby's brains out against a telegraph pole. Not\r\n     satisfied with this one rioter severed her breasts and a white\r\n     youngster bore it aloft on a pole triumphantly while the crowd\r\n     hooted gleefully. The whole time this was happening several\r\n     policemen were in the crowd but did not make any attempt to\r\n     make a rescue until too late.\r\n\r\nConcerning all of these stories it may be stated that the coroner had\r\nno cases of deaths of women and children brought before him. There was\r\nnothing in the police reports or the files of the state's attorney or\r\nhospital reports or the reports of Olivet Baptist Church, which would\r\ngive any foundation for reports of the killing of a woman and child,\r\nwhite or Negro.\r\n\r\nThere were other rumors which had the same anger-producing effect as\r\nreports of attacks on women. A notable case of this kind was the fatal\r\nclash at the Angelus, an apartment house for white people at Thirty-fifth\r\nStreet and Wabash Avenue, on Monday, July 28 (see p. 6). The trouble\r\nhere grew from four o'clock in the afternoon until it culminated in\r\nthe shooting at 8:00 P.M. The excitement was stimulated by the rapid\r\nspread of various rumors. It was said that a white mob was gathering\r\nat Thirty-fifth Street and Wentworth Avenue, only a few blocks from the\r\ncolored mob which was massed on Thirty-fifth Street from State Street to\r\nWabash Avenue. The rumor was that the white men are armed and prepared\r\nto \"clean up the 'Black Belt.'\" Another rumor had it that a Negro's\r\nsister had been killed while coming home from the Stock Yards where she\r\nworked. Finally came the rumor that a white person had fired a shot\r\nfrom the Angelus building, wounding a colored boy. The rumor quickly\r\nwent through the crowd swarming around the building, but no one heard\r\nor saw the shooting. A search of the building disclosed no firearms.\r\nPolice Sergeant Middleton, Negro, described the situation as \"everybody\r\ntrying to tell you something and you couldn't get anything.\" Another\r\nNegro policeman said it was \"just a rumor that went around through the\r\ncrowd and everybody was saying, 'He shot from that window'; I would go\r\nto that window and the crowd would say, 'That is the window over there.'\"\r\n\r\nThe anger-provoking power of rumor was seen in the ensuing clash. About\r\n1,500 Negroes massed on one corner of Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash\r\nAvenue, and about 100 policemen grouped themselves at the intersection\r\nof the two streets. At the sight of a brick flying from the Negro mob the\r\npolice fired a volley into the midst of the mob. More shots came quickly\r\nfrom both sides. Four Negroes were killed, and many were injured, among\r\nboth the Negroes and the police.\r\n\r\nThe Angelus rumor appeared as follows in a Negro newspaper, the _Chicago\r\nDefender_, August 2: \"White occupants of the Angelus apartments began\r\nfiring shots and throwing missiles from their windows. One man was shot\r\nthrough the head but before his name could be secured he was spirited\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of Joseph Lovings, a Negro killed by an Italian mob, press\r\nreports that were entirely false tended strongly to provoke the anger\r\nof Negro mobs. For example:\r\n\r\n_Herald-Examiner_, July 30: \"He had been shot, stabbed and gasoline had\r\nbeen thrown on his body which had been set afire. The police extinguished\r\nthe fire and took the body to the County Morgue.\"\r\n\r\n_Tribune_, July 30: \"This report says that he was stabbed and shot\r\nsixteen times, then his body saturated with gasoline and set afire.\"\r\n\r\nThe coroner's jury in commenting on this rumor said: \"It gives us\r\nsatisfaction to say that this rumor, from our investigation, is false\r\nand unsubstantiated.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the horror rumors one finds such examples as the story of the white\r\nman who stood at the entrance to Exchange Avenue and knocked down half a\r\ndozen Negroes as they came by. This was current in the Stock Yards and\r\nwas told by one of the workers at the inquest on the body of William\r\nDozier, Negro, killed in the Yards. Another rumor had it that a Negro\r\nwoman nicknamed \"Heavy\" had partly slashed off the head of a white man.\r\nThis was picked up by a detective circulating among white people living\r\nin the \"Black Belt.\"\r\n\r\nBut chief among horror rumors was the Bubbly Creek rumor, which took\r\nthis form in the press:\r\n\r\n_Daily News_, July 29. Subheadline: \"Four Bodies in Bubbly Creek.\" The\r\narticle does not give details but says, \"Bodies of four colored men\r\nwere taken today from Bubbly Creek in the Stock Yards district, it is\r\nreported.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most persistent rumors of the riot, and intelligent\r\nmen were found repeating it in half-credulous tones. A meat curer,\r\ntalking in the superintendent's office of Swift & Company, said: \"Well,\r\nI hear they did drag two or three out of Bubbly Creek.... Dead bodies,\r\nthat is the report that came to the Yards, but personally I never got\r\nany positive evidence that there was any people who was found there.\"\r\n\r\nA juror on the coroner's panel said: \"A man told a friend of mine--I\r\ncan furnish the name of that man--a man told him that he saw fifty-six\r\nbodies taken out of Bubbly Creek. They made a statement they used a net\r\nand seine to drag them out.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Williams, Negro attorney, said he was told that the bodies of 100\r\nNegroes had been found in Bubbly Creek.\r\n\r\nIn its final report, the coroner's jury made this conclusive statement\r\nregarding the Bubbly Creek rumor:\r\n\r\n     Bubbly Creek has been the favorite cemetery for the undiscovered\r\n     dead, and our inquiry has been partly directed to that\r\n     stream. In our inquiry we have been assisted by the Stock\r\n     Yards officials and workers, by adjacent property owners and\r\n     residents, by private detective bureaus, the Police Department,\r\n     Department of Health, State's Attorney's office, by observing\r\n     and intelligent colored citizens, and by other agencies, and\r\n     we are firmly of the opinion that these reports, so widely\r\n     circulated, are erroneous, misleading, and without foundation\r\n     in fact, the race riot victims numbering thirty-eight, and\r\n     no more, nor are there any colored citizens reported to us as\r\n     missing.\r\n\r\nRumor, fermenting in mobs, prepares the mob mind for the direct suggestion\r\nimpelling otherwise law-abiding citizens to atrocities. Another more\r\ninsidious and potentially more dangerous result is the slow accumulation\r\nof feeling which builds between the white and Negro the strongest barrier\r\nof race prejudice.\r\n\r\n_Police._--There has been much criticism of the manner in which the\r\nriot was handled by the authorities, but it may be pointed out that the\r\nriot was not quelled until at least four groups of peace guardians had\r\ntaken part in handling it. The two most important groups were the police\r\nand the militia; the others were composed of deputy sheriffs and Negro\r\nex-soldiers.\r\n\r\nTestimony before the coroner's jury and in hearings before this Commission\r\nthrows considerable light on the actions of the Police Department as\r\na whole during the riot, its methods in meeting the unusual situation,\r\nand on the conduct of individual policemen. First-hand information and\r\nopinion was obtained from Chief of Police Garrity and State's Attorney\r\nHoyne.\r\n\r\nThe police had two severe handicaps at the outset of the rioting. The\r\nfirst, as declared by Chief Garrity, was lack of sufficient numbers\r\nadequately to cope with the situation. The coroner's jury found that \"the\r\npolice force should be enlarged. It is too small to cope with the needs\r\nof Chicago.\" The grand jury added: \"The police force is also inadequate\r\nin numbers, and at least one thousand (1,000) officers should be added\r\nto the existing force.\" This number approximates the need urged by Chief\r\nGarrity, who, when asked before the Commission as to the sufficiency of\r\nhis force, answered: \"No. I haven't sufficient force. I haven't got a\r\nsufficient force now to properly police the city of Chicago by one-third.\"\r\nMilitia officers and other police officials held the same general opinion.\r\n\r\nThe second handicap, distrust of white policemen by all Negroes, while\r\nimplied and not admitted by Chief Garrity, was frankly explained by\r\nState's Attorney Hoyne. He said before the Commission: \"There is no\r\ndoubt that a great many police officers were grossly unfair in making\r\narrests. They shut their eyes to offenses committed by white men while\r\nthey were very vigorous in getting all the colored men they could get.\"\r\n\r\nLeaders among the Negroes clearly indicate that discrimination in arrest\r\nwas a principal cause of widespread and long-standing distrust. Whether\r\njustified or not, this feeling was actual and bitter. This distrust\r\nhad grown seriously during the six months preceding the riot because no\r\narrests were made in bombing cases. State's Attorney Hoyne said before\r\nthe commission: \"I don't know of a single case where the police have\r\napprehended any man who has blown up a house.\"\r\n\r\nCharles S. Duke, a well-educated and fair-minded Negro, gave his reaction\r\nto the bombings when he said that he did not \"believe a Negro would have\r\nbeen allowed to go unpunished five minutes.\" Mrs. Clarke, Negro, said\r\nher house was bombed three times, once while a plain-clothes policeman\r\nwas inside waiting for bombers, but no arrests were made. One suspect\r\nwas put under surveillance but was not held.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the three Negro policemen before the Merit Committee\r\nof the Police Department because they refused to use the \"Jim Crow\"\r\nsleeping-quarters in a police station doubtless added to race feeling,\r\nparticularly in view of the publicity it received in the \"Black Belt.\"\r\n\r\nNegro distrust of the police increased among the Negroes during the\r\nperiod of the riot. With each clash a new cause for suspicion seemed to\r\nspring up. The most striking instance occurred on the first afternoon\r\nwhen Policeman Callahan refused to arrest the white man whom the Negro\r\ncrowd accused of causing the drowning of Williams, the Negro boy. This\r\nrefusal has been called the beginning of the riot because it led to mob\r\nviolence of grave consequences. However that may have been, the fact\r\nremains that this refusal was heralded broadcast by the Negroes as the\r\nkind of action they might expect from the police.\r\n\r\nTypical of the minor tales which laid the foundation for the Negroes'\r\nbitterness toward this white policeman are the following:\r\n\r\n1. Kin Lumpkin, Negro, was beaten by a mob on the \"L\" platform at\r\nForty-seventh Street, as he was going home from work. The policeman\r\narrested Lumpkin and had him booked for rioting. No other arrests were\r\nmade. Lumpkin was held from July 28 to August 1.\r\n\r\n2. Two policemen, one of them Officer McCarty of the Twenty-sixth\r\nPrecinct, witnessed the beating of Wellington Dunmore, Negro, of 4120\r\nSouth Campbell Avenue, but, according to the victim, refused to assist\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3. John Slovall and brother, Negroes, were beaten and robbed by whites\r\nin sight of a white policeman. No arrests were made. The officer did\r\nnot even call for aid.\r\n\r\n4. While looking for his mother at Thirty-first and State streets\r\non Tuesday, July 29, Wm. F. Thornton, Negro, 3207 South Park Avenue,\r\nasked a policeman to take him home. The officer took him to the police\r\nstation and locked him up. Another Negro applied for protection, but the\r\npolice searched him, clubbed him, and when he ran, the sergeant told\r\nanother policeman to shoot him. The policeman obeyed and the man fell\r\nunder the \"L\" station. He was picked up by the same patrol wagon that\r\ntook Thornton to the Cottage Grove Police Station. The officer, Bundy,\r\narrested Thornton.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGROES BEING ESCORTED BY POLICE TO SAFETY ZONE FROM THE\r\n   NEIGHBORHOOD OF FORTY-EIGHTH STREET AND WENTWORTH AVENUE]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SEARCHING NEGROES FOR ARMS IN POLICE STATION]\r\n\r\nA report on 229 Negroes and whites accused of various criminal activities\r\ndisclosed the fact that 154 were Negroes and seventy-five were whites.\r\nThe state's attorney reported eighty-one indictments against Negroes and\r\nforty-seven against whites after all riot cases were cleared up. These\r\nfigures show that twice as many Negroes appeared as defendants and twice\r\nas many were indicted as whites.\r\n\r\nAt first glance these figures indicate greater riot activity on the\r\npart of Negroes, and therefore one would expect to find twice as many\r\nwhites injured as Negroes. But out of a total of 520 injured persons\r\nwhose race was definitely reported, 342 were Negroes and 178 whites.\r\nThe fact that twice as many Negroes appeared as defendants and twice\r\nas many were injured as whites suggests the conclusion that whites were\r\nnot apprehended as readily as Negroes.\r\n\r\nHerman M. Adler, state criminologist of Illinois, testifying before\r\nthe Commission, expressed the belief that the police showed much more\r\nreadiness to arrest Negroes than whites because the officers thought\r\nthey were \"taking fewer chances if they 'soaked' a colored man.\"\r\n\r\nNegro distrust of police and courts seems to have been confirmed by the\r\naction of the state's attorney's office in bringing only Negro riot cases\r\nbefore the grand jury. This body, however, took a stand for fair play\r\nand justice for both sides, and though its action may have been novel,\r\nit was effective. In its final report, the grand jury said:\r\n\r\n     This jury has no apology to offer for its attitude with\r\n     reference to requesting the state's attorney to supply it with\r\n     information of crimes perpetrated by whites against blacks\r\n     before considering further evidence against blacks. This\r\n     attitude gave rise to the reports in the press that this grand\r\n     jury \"had gone on a strike.\" As a matter of fact, its position\r\n     was merely a suspension of hearing further cases of crimes\r\n     committed by blacks against whites until the state's attorney\r\n     submitted evidence concerning the various crimes committed by\r\n     whites against blacks. The reason for this attitude arose from\r\n     a sense of justice on the part of this jury. It is the opinion\r\n     of this jury that the colored people suffered more at the hands\r\n     of the white hoodlums than the white people suffered at the\r\n     hands of the black hoodlums. Notwithstanding this fact, the\r\n     cases presented to this jury against the blacks far outnumber\r\n     those against the whites.\r\n\r\nState's Attorney Hoyne justified this action by saying that the Police\r\nDepartment brought in Negroes only, and until they arrested whites, he\r\nwas limited to proceedings against Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe coroner's jury on November 3, 1919, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     Our attention was called strikingly to the fact that at the time\r\n     of race rioting, the arrests made for rioting by the police\r\n     of colored rioters were far in excess of the arrests made of\r\n     white rioters. The failure of the police to arrest impartially,\r\n     at the time of rioting, whether from insufficient effort or\r\n     otherwise, was a mistake and had a tendency to further incite\r\n     and aggravate the colored population.\r\n\r\nThis seeming discrimination in arrests naturally deepened Negro distrust\r\nand lack of confidence in the police. Testimony was taken by the\r\nCommission on the plans and action of the Police Department during the\r\nriot period, since the Commission felt that the distribution of forces\r\nand the methods used by the department to meet such an emergency were\r\nmatters of first importance.\r\n\r\nChief of Police Garrity testified that there were 3,500 policemen in the\r\ndepartment at the time of the riot, and that he had \"practically every\r\npoliceman in the city of Chicago down there,\" indicating Thirty-fifth\r\nStreet and Rhodes Avenue as \"practically in the heart of the district\r\nwhere the most trouble was.\" The widest distribution from that center,\r\nhe said, was over an area bounded by Lake Michigan, Ashland Avenue, Van\r\nBuren Street, and Sixty-ninth Street.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest concentration of police, however, was in the \"Black Belt.\"\r\nThe Stanton Avenue Police Station at Thirty-fifth Street and Rhodes\r\nAvenue is at about the center of the most congested Negro residential\r\narea. Asked how many policemen were assigned to that vicinity (the area\r\nfrom Twenty-second to Thirty-ninth streets), Chief Garrity said, \"We had\r\nin the neighborhood of 2,800 men in that territory.\" Later the chief\r\nsaid only \"the necessary sergeants and one or two men at each station\r\nwere held back for emergency calls\" in all other parts of the city. This\r\nmeans that four-fifths of the total police force was concentrated there.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no direct testimony as to the existence of flying\r\nsquadrons of police, yet such bodies appear to have been operating.\r\nProbably the most important of these was the patrol under Police Captain\r\nMullen, who said that his territory extended from Twenty-second to\r\nThirty-ninth streets and from the lake to the Rock Island tracks, or\r\nroughly the \"Black Belt.\" Chief Deputy Alcock[9] sent eighty-eight\r\npolicemen into this district on Sunday afternoon, twenty-five more at\r\nmidnight, and fifty more on Monday morning.\r\n\r\nIn describing the disposition of police details, Chief Garrity said:\r\n\"They were routed by him [Alcock] according to conditions existing in\r\ndifferent districts. Some districts might have a hundred men in the\r\nblock and in the next block there might be only ten, according to what\r\nconditions were.\" Forces were moved from one point of disturbance to\r\nanother by means of patrol wagons on request of local commanders.\r\n\r\nThe 2,800 policemen in the \"Black Belt\" were under the command of Chief\r\nDeputy Alcock with headquarters in the Stanton Avenue Station. He \"used\r\nhis discretion in the number of men assigned to the different points\r\nand the handling of them in the different territories.\"\r\n\r\nRiot orders were given by Chief Garrity as follows: \"Wherever possible\r\nsuppress the riot and restore peace\"; \"the second day I ordered a\r\ndead line on Wentworth Avenue and Twenty-second Street to, I think,\r\nSixty-third Street\"; \"instructions were that 'you will allow no colored\r\npeople to go across to the west and no white people to go across to the\r\neast.'\" Cabarets, saloons, and public places were ordered closed, and\r\nall large gatherings of either whites or Negroes were prohibited from\r\nVan Buren to Sixty-ninth streets and from Ashland Avenue to the lake.\r\nThe chief added, \"Closing clubrooms and everything in the district west\r\nof Wentworth Avenue as well as east of it.\" A general policy was adopted\r\nof search and seizure of persons suspected of carrying weapons on the\r\nstreet, and of houses from which firing came. Captain Mullen testified\r\nbefore the coroner's jury at the Eugene Williams inquest that on July\r\n29 Chief Deputy Alcock lined up the policemen in front of the Stanton\r\nAvenue Station and gave them their orders. They were told to \"preserve\r\nthe peace; that was all.\"\r\n\r\nPolice records of clashes were incomplete and often inaccurate. This\r\nwas in part due, and naturally so, to the stress of the moment. In many\r\ncases the station lists of injured were far from complete and in few\r\ninstances were the names of witnesses given. Even the dates and hours\r\nof clashes were loosely recorded. Persons arrested were frequently\r\nnot booked at all, while on the other hand it was not uncommon to find\r\ninnocent persons charged with serious offenses. Henry Scholz, policeman\r\nof the Twenty-sixth Precinct, threw much light on police records while\r\nbeing examined in connection with certain automobile arrests:\r\n\r\n     They were all discharged, booked for \"disorderly,\" because\r\n     we couldn't find the guns in the mix-up. It was the first or\r\n     second day down there and they were bringing them in right\r\n     and left, and I suppose in the mix-up they mislaid the guns,\r\n     or put them away somewhere, or booked them to someone else.\r\n     We held them about a week trying to find the guns and trying\r\n     to find the officers that got the guns.\r\n\r\nIt is important to know how the distribution and routing of police\r\naffected the general riot situation. As already shown four-fifths of the\r\npolice forces were concentrated in the \"Black Belt.\" This undoubtedly\r\nboth weakened police forces elsewhere and also prevented or delayed\r\nreinforcements in outside districts. Only 34 per cent of the total number\r\nof reported injuries occurred in the area of concentration. Negro hatred\r\nof the police is worth mentioning again here, especially since many of\r\nthe deaths and injuries occurred during clashes between white policemen\r\nand Negro mobs.\r\n\r\nThat other districts where danger existed were poorly protected is shown\r\nby the fact that fatal clashes occurred there without interruption by the\r\npolice. The most conspicuous case is noted in the \"Loop\" atrocities on\r\nJuly 29, where two Negroes, Hardwick and Williams, were killed, several\r\nwere injured and robbed, and business property of whites was damaged. A\r\npolice sergeant said that only three officers and one sergeant were in\r\nthe district on the night of July 28-29. In the Stock Yards district,\r\nwhere 41 per cent of the injuries and several deaths occurred, there\r\nis no record of an attempt by the police to increase the riot forces.\r\nIn this district gang raids by whites were practically beyond control.\r\nOn July 28 B. F. Hardy, a Negro, was killed at Forty-sixth Street and\r\nCottage Grove Avenue. Sergeant Clancy later testified that there were\r\nno policemen in this district until after the trouble. The foreman of\r\nthe grand jury investigated the activities of the Deering Street Station\r\nunder Police Captain Gallery. He says: \"They didn't have a sufficient\r\nnumber of policemen to handle the situation. If I remember correctly,\r\nhe had eight patrolmen covering a district of any number of square miles.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the concentration of police in the \"Black Belt\" some parts\r\nof that area seem at times not to have been properly guarded. Several\r\nserious clashes occurred there after the police arrived in force. Theodore\r\nCopling, Negro, was shot to death at Thirtieth and State streets in the\r\nheart of the \"Black Belt\" on July 30. This had been a riotous corner for\r\nthree days, yet no policemen were at hand. The nearest was a detective\r\nsergeant on Twenty-ninth Street between Federal and State streets. Samuel\r\nBanks, Negro, was shot and killed near the corner of Twenty-seventh\r\nand Dearborn streets on July 30 at 11:00 P.M., yet Lieutenant Burns, in\r\ncharge of this district, testified at the inquest that twelve to fourteen\r\nofficers were at Twenty-seventh and Dearborn streets immediately before\r\nthe shooting.\r\n\r\nIt was undoubtedly the relatively large number of clashes which the\r\npolice were unable to prevent that led the coroner's jury to recommend\r\nthat \"(6) there should be organization of the force for riot work for\r\nthe purpose of controlling rioting in its incipient stages.\"\r\n\r\nThe conduct of individual policemen received much adverse criticism\r\nfrom the Negroes. This was to be expected in the circumstances, but\r\ndisregarding the general prejudice of which white officers were accused,\r\ncertain cases of discrimination, abuse, brutality, indifference, and\r\nneglect on the part of individuals are deserving of examination.\r\n\r\nAbusive and brutal treatment was complained of by Horace Jennings, 3422\r\nSouth Aberdeen Street. He reported to the state's attorney's office\r\nthat Policeman G----, of the Grand Crossing Station, approached him,\r\nas he lay wounded by a mob attack, with the words, \"Where's your gun,\r\nyou black ---- of a ----? You damn niggers are raising hell\"; that the\r\nofficer hit him on the head, and he did not regain consciousness until\r\nsome time later in the Burnside Hospital; and he further charged that\r\nGallagher took a purse containing $13 when he searched him.\r\n\r\nThree Negroes were rescued by the police from a white mob of twenty-five\r\nor thirty men. Scott, one of the Negroes, was taken from the street car\r\non which all three were riding, by the command of a policeman to \"come\r\nout of there, you big rusty brute, you. I ought to shoot you,\" and was\r\ngiven a blow on the head. According to a witness he was again struck by\r\nthe policeman as he was pushed into the patrol wagon. He was subjected\r\nto rough treatment at the jail and was kept incommunicado from July 28\r\nto August 4, not being permitted to notify his wife or an attorney. None\r\nof the twenty-five or thirty white rioters was arrested. There was some\r\nevidence of fear on the part of the police to arrest rioting whites.\r\n\r\nFear by policemen of Negroes is also disclosed. George Crumm, white, 124\r\nEast Forty-sixth Street, informed the state's attorney's office that he\r\nwas beaten by a Negro mob, got police assistance, and pointed out the\r\nrioters, but the police \"didn't seem to want to interfere any.\"\r\n\r\nOn several occasions policemen left the scene of riots on questionable\r\nexcuses while the rioting was in progress. Of the three mounted policemen\r\nat Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue who rushed to the spot where a\r\nmob was attacking Otterson, two accompanied the automobile of Otterson\r\nto the hospital. The mob was not quelled or dispersed. When the house\r\nof William O'Deneal, Negro, 4742 Wells Street, was attacked, the police\r\ntook O'Deneal to the station and left the mob to sack and burn his house.\r\nAt the killing of William Dozier, Negro, all three police officers who\r\nresponded to notice of an attack by a white mob of 300 or more, left\r\nin the same patrol wagon. The names of witnesses were not taken. It was\r\nthe custom for all to accompany the wagon, according to Officer McDonough.\r\n\r\nPolitical \"pull\" exercised with the police on behalf of rioters has been\r\nindicated. It was noted that one of \"Ragen's Colts\" said an officer of\r\nthe Stock Yards Station \"tipped them off\" to stay away from their club\r\nbecause Attorney General Brundage's office was out investigating them.\r\n\r\nIndifference both to extreme lawlessness during the riot and to the\r\nprocedure of the inquest marked the examination of Captain of Police\r\nMullen before the coroner's jury. He was in command of twelve mounted men\r\nand between sixty-three and 100 men on foot at Thirty-fifth Street and\r\nWabash Avenue when a clash between the police and a Negro mob occurred.\r\nWhile it appears to be the fact that he left just before the heavy firing\r\nto telephone from a saloon one block away, yet the building he was in\r\nwas struck by bullets. The following excerpt from the inquest speaks\r\nfor itself:\r\n\r\n     _Q._: What time did the shooting take place at the building\r\n     known as the Angelus Building? What time did that occur? Was\r\n     there any shooting at that building?\r\n\r\n     _Mullen_: Not that I heard.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: Had there been any shooting done there that evening\r\n     around ... before you left?\r\n\r\n     _Mullen_: Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: When was the shooting done, and where were you?\r\n\r\n     _Mullen_: What do you mean shooting?\r\n\r\nThree men were killed and many injured at Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash\r\nAvenue at this time. Firing broke out near-by almost immediately.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: There were some shots fired at Thirty-fifth and State,\r\n     Captain, at eight that night, right after the volley was fired,\r\n     we have absolute evidence.\r\n\r\n     _Mullen_: Well, you may have, but I have not.\r\n\r\nYet Captain Mullen was in command of the police who killed two more men\r\nand inflicted other wounds when the Negroes ran before the police advance.\r\n\r\n_Militia._--The rapid growth of the riot both in violence and\r\nterritorially created such alarm among the authorities and the public\r\nthat the question of its control became a matter of paramount concern\r\nto the community. Before twenty-four hours had elapsed requests were\r\nmade to the local authorities for the militia. The representations were\r\nbased on insufficiency of police forces and were strongly urged before\r\nthe chief of police.\r\n\r\nChief Garrity steadily refused to ask for troops, in spite of his\r\nrepeated statement that the police force was insufficient. He gave as\r\nhis reason the belief that inexperienced militiamen would add to the\r\ndeaths and disorders. Mayor Thompson supported the chief's refusal until\r\noutside pressure compelled him to ask the governor for aid. On the other\r\nhand the chief deputy of police was quoted by State's Attorney Hoyne\r\nas having said at the outbreak of the riot that the police would not\r\nbe able to handle the situation, and that troops were needed. In this\r\nhe was supported by Mr. Hoyne. From observation of conditions on the\r\nfirst three days of the riot, the chief of staff of the troops, Colonel\r\nRonayne, concluded that the police were insufficient in numbers, that no\r\nimprovement was apparent in the general situation, and that therefore\r\nthe troops were necessary. He saw no reason, however, for putting the\r\ncity under martial law. Other military men were of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nDuring all of this time Governor Lowden kept in close touch with the\r\nsituation from his quarters at the Blackstone Hotel. When the riot\r\nappeared to be subsiding he started to keep an appointment out of town\r\nbut, on hearing that there was a renewal of violence, returned to the city\r\non a special train. When the request was made for the active co-operation\r\nof the troops he acted with promptness.\r\n\r\nThe troops themselves were clearly of high caliber. For the most part\r\nthey were in home service during the war and were older men than are\r\nordinarily found in militia organizations. They \"usually came from\r\nthe higher type of business men, men of affairs, men that knew how to\r\nthink,\" as one of their commanding officers described them. They were\r\nall American-born.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGROES UNDER PROTECTION OF POLICE AND MILITIA BUYING\r\n   PROVISIONS BROUGHT INTO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD IN WAGONS]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE MILITIA AND NEGROES ON FRIENDLY TERMS]\r\n\r\nThe militia discipline was of the best. Not a single case of breach of\r\ndiscipline was reported to the regimental commanders. No guardhouse was\r\nnecessary during the riot, a remarkable commentary on troop conduct.\r\n\r\nThe militia had been given special drills in the suppression of riots\r\nand insurrections for a year and a half previous to this occasion, and\r\nwere, in the estimation of their commanding officer, \"probably better\r\nprepared for riot drill than any troops ever put on duty in the state.\"\r\n\r\nThe activities of the militia did not begin as early as many citizens\r\nwished. Though troops began to mobilize in the armories on Monday night,\r\nJuly 28, they were not called to actual duty on the streets until\r\n10:30 P.M., Wednesday, July 30. When called to active duty they were\r\ndistributed in the areas of conflict. Between 5,000 and 6,000 troops\r\nwere called out. This number was made up entirely of white troops from\r\nthe Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Infantry, Illinois National Guard, and\r\nfrom the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Reserve Militia regiments of\r\nthe militia. Colored troops who had composed the Eighth Regiment were\r\nnot reorganized at that time, and therefore none participated.\r\n\r\nDistribution of troops was determined not by the militia command but\r\nby the police, because the city was not under martial law, the civil\r\nauthority being merely insufficient, not broken. The Third Infantry\r\ncovered the territory from Thirty-first to Thirty-eighth streets and\r\nfrom State to Halsted streets; Eleventh Infantry from Thirty-ninth to\r\nForty-seventh streets, and from State to Halsted streets; Tenth Infantry\r\nfrom Forty-eighth to Fifty-fifth streets (later extended to Sixty-third\r\nStreet by details from the First Infantry), and from Cottage Grove to\r\nStewart avenues. The First, Fourth, and Ninth Infantry were held in\r\nreserve. Detachments responded to calls from the chief of police in\r\ndistricts outside these areas. Headquarters for the commanding general\r\nand his chief of staff were in the Congress Hotel at the northern boundary\r\nof the riot zone.\r\n\r\nThe orders under which the militia operated did not have the authority\r\nof martial law. The purpose of the orders was to effect a thorough\r\nco-operation with the police only, and not to take over any duties\r\nother than the preservation of law and order. Except in this respect,\r\ncivilian routine remained undisturbed. The method of co-operation\r\nput the commanding officer of a regiment in absolute control, within\r\nthe limits above described, in his district. The police reduced their\r\nnumber to normal requirements by removing their reserves as soon as the\r\nmilitia moved in. The patrolmen then went about on ordinary duties in\r\nthe districts. Persons arrested by the militia were turned over to the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nResponsibility for the preservation of law and order rested on the\r\nregimental commanders. Careful instructions were given troops for\r\npreventing violence: they were to act as soldiers in a gentlemanly\r\nmanner; they were furnished with arms to enable them to perform their\r\nduties; they were to use the arms only when necessary; they were to use\r\nbayonet and butt in preference to firing, but if the situation demanded\r\nshooting, they were not to hesitate to deliver an effective fire. Above\r\nall, the formation of mobs was to be prevented.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the militia was received by various elements in the\r\ncommunities where stationed is illuminating. Police officers were glad\r\nthat the troops came to relieve them. Two policemen on duty with a patrol\r\nexclaimed, when they heard the militia had come in force, \"Thank God!\r\nWe can't stand up under this much longer!\" The police at Cottage Grove\r\nAvenue said, \"We are tickled to death to see you fellows come in; you\r\nhave never looked so good to us before!\" A regimental commander said his\r\norganization was \"welcomed into the zone, of course, by everybody, and\r\nI'd say especially by the colored people.\" A similar report came from\r\nanother regimental commander.\r\n\r\nBut there was some show of hostility to the troops. Hoodlums fired on\r\nsome detachments when they first came in, and Colonel Bolte reported a\r\nhatred for the troops by \"the Hamburg Athletic Club, the Ragen's, and\r\nthe Emeralds, and a whole bunch of them over there who didn't like to\r\nbe controlled!\" Volunteer ex-service men with no legal status, but who\r\naided the police at the time, and deputy sheriffs with overseas training\r\nridiculed the militia with such taunts as, \"Tin soldiers!\" The effect of\r\nthis attitude on the populace necessitated the arrest of some disturbers\r\nand the removal of unauthorized persons from the streets.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that militia activities were principally against\r\ngangs of hoodlums, and the majority of these gangs were composed of\r\nwhite youths. Said one commander, \"Rowdies of the white population tried\r\nto get through the lines and had to be arrested.\" \"At one time a heavy\r\ntruck or two loaded with white gangsters attempted to break through the\r\nmilitia but was checked.\" Plenty of trouble \"with the Ragen's and other\r\nsimilar organizations\" was reported by yet another commander.\r\n\r\nThe militia unquestionably prevented mob formations, raids, and \"sniping.\"\r\nThey checked marauders still in search of prey. In many cases they\r\nprevented the initial moves of lawlessness by taking stations at critical\r\npoints long before raiders arrived.\r\n\r\nThere was a marked contrast between the militia and the police. The\r\ntroops were under definite orders; commanders had absolute control of\r\ntheir forces and knew at all times where and how many effectives were\r\navailable. Precision and promptness of movement was the rule. Reserves\r\nwere always at hand. Discipline was always good. Only one person, a\r\nwhite man, was killed by the troops. Whatever other restraining causes\r\ncontributed, it is certain that the riot was not revived after the troops\r\nwere posted.\r\n\r\nMost of the troops were withdrawn on August 8.\r\n\r\n_Volunteers._--Many Negro ex-service men, formerly members of the old\r\nEighth Regiment (Negro) of the Illinois National Guard, donned their\r\nuniforms, armed, and offered their services to the police and militia.\r\nThe militia on duty found that these Negro volunteers had no authority\r\nor military status and consequently ordered them to disband, which they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBefore the troops were called out, however, a determined effort was\r\nmade by one Britton, white police reserve, to organize ex-soldiers for\r\nvolunteer service. He said as many as thirty-five joined him. They were\r\ndenied permits to carry weapons but are reported to have done so. It\r\nwas these men who used an automobile, driven with the mufflers open, to\r\nclear the streets.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the use of liquor was noticed among these men during their\r\nactive period. Some were involved in the killing of Samuel Banks, Negro;\r\nsome in the robbery of a restaurant and in misdeeds of a minor character.\r\nFollowing the implication of individuals among them in these crimes,\r\nnumbers of the ex-soldiers were arrested by the police, but were released\r\nby order of Chief Garrity on account of the assistance many of them had\r\nrendered the department and because of representations of business men\r\nwho felt that the arrests were unjust.\r\n\r\n_Deputy sheriffs._--In addition to police, militiamen, and volunteers,\r\nanother group composed of specially recruited deputy sheriffs, appeared\r\nin the riot zone as preservers of the peace. They were sworn in by\r\nSheriff Peters, of Cook County, after citizens had appealed to him, he\r\nsaid, to quell the riot. In regard to their formation, numbers, orders,\r\nand duties, the sheriff had this to say:\r\n\r\n     I advertised for ex-service men to serve as deputy sheriffs. A\r\n     thousand or more applied. They were all men who had returned\r\n     from the war and were out of work. I hired 500 of them, kept\r\n     them in the army uniforms, and instructed them to shoot to\r\n     kill any disturbers or rioters. The presence of these men and\r\n     the show of authority thereby made was effective, and the riot\r\n     was quelled.\r\n\r\nFifteen thousand dollars was spent on this force.\r\n\r\nIt appears that these deputies came on the scene toward the end of the\r\nriot week and at once fell into disfavor with the militia, whom they\r\nridiculed as \"tin soldiers\" in much the same manner as did the volunteers.\r\nTwo regimental commanders of militia said the special deputies \"did\r\nnot behave in a very pleasant manner\" and \"in the majority of instances\r\nwere no good.\" The sheriff was notified to call them in and they soon\r\ndisappeared. There is no record of organized methods of procedure or of\r\ntheir activities.\r\n\r\n_Restoration of order._--Long before actual hostilities ceased, and even\r\nbefore the arrival of the militia, various agencies, in addition to the\r\npolice, were at work trying to hold lawlessness in check and restore\r\norder. Efforts of citizens of both races helped greatly in bringing\r\nabout peace. As long as the rioting was in progress thousands of Negroes\r\nwere cut off from their employment. The Stock Yards workers especially\r\nwere affected, since Negroes living east of Wentworth Avenue would have\r\nbeen forced to go to work on foot through the district in which the\r\nworst rioting occurred. The hostilities also cut off the food supply\r\nin the main riot areas. The dealers in the \"Black Belt,\" principally\r\nJewish merchants, became alarmed lest temporary lack of funds due to the\r\nseparation from work and wages should lead Negroes to loot their stores.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, the various packing companies made the unpaid wages of\r\nNegro employees available for them by establishing pay stations at the\r\nChicago Urban League at 3032 Wabash Avenue, the Wabash Avenue Young Men's\r\nChristian Association at 3763 Wabash Avenue, the South Side Community\r\nService House at 3201 South Wabash Avenue, and the Binga State Bank,\r\nThirty-eighth and State streets. Approximately 6,000 employees were paid\r\nin this way. Banks within the district made small temporary loans to\r\nstranded persons, sometimes without security. The cashier of the Franklin\r\nState Bank at Thirty-fifth Street and Michigan Avenue said that he had\r\nmade loans of more than $200 to Negroes in sums of $2 and $3 on their\r\nsimple promise to pay, and that every dollar had been repaid.\r\n\r\nAll the local newspapers in their editorial columns took a vigorous\r\nstand against disorder, urged the people to be calm and avoid crowds,\r\nand were insistent that those responsible for rioting should be brought\r\nto justice. The _Tribune_, for example, published editorials under the\r\nfollowing captions: \"Regain Order and Keep It,\" \"Sane Men and Rioters,\"\r\n\"This Is No Holiday,\" \"The Facts of the Riot,\" and \"Penalties for\r\nRioters.\" All of these articles were calm appeals for tolerance, sanity,\r\nand dispassionate inquiry for the facts. The _Evening American_, in an\r\neditorial entitled \"This Is Chicago's Crisis; Keep a Cool Head,\" said:\r\n\r\n     Chicago is facing its crisis today.\r\n\r\n     In one great section of the city law and order for the time\r\n     being seem to have been flung to the four winds. White men and\r\n     colored men are shooting one another down in the streets for\r\n     no earthly cause except that the color of their faces differs.\r\n\r\n     These mobs are not representative of whites or blacks. They\r\n     are the hoodlums of both races. But the law abiding whites\r\n     and blacks are innocent victims.\r\n\r\n     Hotheads and smoking gun barrels have almost wrested the rule\r\n     from the keepers of the peace.\r\n\r\n     It is worse than a calamity, this race rioting. It is a deadly,\r\n     ghastly scourge, a dire contagion that is sweeping through a\r\n     community for no reason except that mob violence is contagious.\r\n\r\n     It is up to the cool-headed men of Chicago to settle the great\r\n     difficulty. It is up to the serious-minded business men of the\r\n     city to get together and find a solution to a problem which\r\n     has become so serious.\r\n\r\n     To meet violence with violence is but making matters worse.\r\n     Gun toting at a time like this only adds fuel to the fire\r\n     already raging.\r\n\r\n     Reason is the solution. It is mightier than the six-gun. How it\r\n     is to be exerted is for the level-headed citizenry to decide,\r\n     and decide at once.\r\n\r\n     Hardly an hour passes that more names are not added to the\r\n     already long list of slain in the South Side rioting.\r\n\r\n     There is no time to be lost. Other matters must be put aside\r\n     for the moment and a solution reached for Chicago's greatest\r\n     problem.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO STOCK YARDS WORKERS CUT OFF FROM WORK RECEIVING\r\n   WAGES\r\n   Photograph taken at temporary pay station established at the Y.M.C.A.\r\n   by packing companies.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BUYING ICE FROM FREIGHT CAR SWITCHED INTO NEGRO RESIDENCE\r\n   AREA]\r\n\r\nLabor unions also took a hand in the efforts toward peace. Unionists\r\nof both races were exhorted to co-operate in bringing about harmonious\r\nrelations, and meetings for this purpose were planned by trade-union\r\nleaders, as described in the section of this report dealing with the\r\nNegro in industry. Probably the most effective effort of union labor was\r\nthe following article in the _New Majority_, the organ of the Chicago\r\nFederation of Labor, prominently displayed:\r\n\r\n     FOR WHITE UNION MEN TO READ\r\n\r\n     Let any white union worker who has ever been on strike where\r\n     gunmen or machine gun have been brought in and turned on him\r\n     and his fellows search his memory and recall how he felt. In\r\n     this critical moment let every union man remember the tactics\r\n     of the boss in a strike when he tries by shooting to terrorize\r\n     striking workers into violence to protect themselves.\r\n\r\n     Well, that is how the Negroes feel. They are panic-stricken\r\n     over the prospect of being killed.\r\n\r\n     A heavy responsibility rests on the white portion of the\r\n     community to stop assault on Negroes by white men. Violence\r\n     against them is not the way to solve the vexed race problem.\r\n\r\n     This responsibility rests particularly heavy upon the white\r\n     men and women of organized labor, not because they had anything\r\n     to do with starting the present trouble, but because of their\r\n     advantageous position to help end it. Right now it is going\r\n     to be decided whether the colored workers are to continue to\r\n     come into the labor movement or whether they are going to feel\r\n     that they have been abandoned by it and lose confidence in it.\r\n\r\n     It is a critical time for Chicago.\r\n\r\n     It is a critical time for organized labor.\r\n\r\n     All the influence of the unions should be exerted on the\r\n     community to protect colored fellow-workers from the unreasoning\r\n     frenzy of race prejudice. Indications of the past have been\r\n     that organized labor has gone further in eliminating race\r\n     hatred than any other class. It is up against the acid test\r\n     now to show whether this is so.\r\n\r\nVarious social agencies took steps to help in the emergency and restore\r\norder. The American Red Cross has a branch at Thirty-fifth Street and\r\nMichigan Avenue. As soon as the rioting became serious a special relief\r\nheadquarters was established here, and food was distributed to needy\r\nfamilies cut off from work. The Urban League was used as a headquarters\r\nfor the distribution of food.\r\n\r\nThe Urban League had for several years, through its employment bureau,\r\nhandled a large proportion of the city's Negro labor supply and was\r\nconversant with difficulties likely to result from the rioting. It made\r\nfood surveys of the entire Negro area, printed and distributed thousands\r\nof circulars and dodgers urging Negroes to stay off the streets, refrain\r\nfrom dangerous discussions of the riot, and co-operate with the police in\r\nevery way to maintain order. The League sent telegrams to the governor\r\nand mayor suggesting plans for curbing disorder, organized committees\r\nof citizens to aid the authorities in restoring order, and served as a\r\nbureau of information and medium of communication between the white and\r\nNegro groups during the worst hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe Young Men's Christian Association was similarly active within the\r\narea of its efforts. Religious bodies, ministers' associations, and\r\nindividual ministers exerted their influence over their respective\r\ngroups by advising the citizens to \"keep cool,\" \"hold their heads,\" and\r\ngenerally to let the authorities settle the riot. Negro business men and\r\none Negro alderman sent wagons through the streets bearing large signs\r\nwhich advised Negroes not to congregate on streets, engage in arguments,\r\nor participate in any way in the disorders. The signs further stated\r\nthat people would be advised when it would be safe to return to work.\r\nOther persons went about speaking on street corners urging co-operation\r\nwith the police and militia. Appeals by officials and leading citizens\r\nwere published in the white and Negro papers, carrying similar advice.\r\nDuring the riot a committee of citizens representing forty-eight social,\r\ncivic, commercial, and professional organizations met at the Union League\r\nClub and petitioned the governor to take steps to quiet the existing\r\ndisorder and appoint a commission to study the situation with a view to\r\npreventing a repetition of it. As a result of this appeal followed by\r\nsimilar urgings by many committees, the present Chicago Commission on\r\nRace Relations was appointed and began its work.\r\n\r\n_Aftermath of the riot._--After the restoration of order community\r\nactivities were superficially the same as before the riot, but under\r\nthe surface there remained a deepened bitterness of race feeling which\r\nspread far beyond the time and territorial limits of the riot itself.\r\n\r\nAll the deep-seated causes of friction which had developed so largely\r\nfrom the failure to work out an adjustment of the increased Negro\r\npopulation due to the migration were and are still present, undiminished\r\nin influence. Consciousness of racial difference and more or less\r\nunconscious fear and distrust were increased and spread by the riot.\r\nAmong the whites this was evidenced by the general belief that Negroes\r\nwere gathering stores of arms and ammunition. Among the Negroes a growing\r\nrace solidarity has been marked. There is a greater lack of confidence\r\nin the white man's law and machinery of protection. Continued bombings\r\nof Negro houses in mixed areas and failure to apprehend the culprits no\r\ndoubt strengthen this attitude.\r\n\r\nReports of various Negro gatherings held soon after the riot show this\r\nto be the case. Many Negroes frankly urged their brothers that they must\r\narm themselves and fight if attacked. At one meeting a Negro is reported\r\nto have said:\r\n\r\n     The recent race riots have done at least one thing for the\r\n     colored race. In the past we Negroes have failed to appreciate\r\n     what solidarity means. We have, on the contrary, been much\r\n     divided. Since the riot we are getting together and devising\r\n     ways and means of protecting our interests. The recent race\r\n     riots have convinced us that we must take steps to protect\r\n     ourselves. Never again will we be found unprepared. It is\r\n     the duty of every man here to provide himself with guns and\r\n     ammunition. I, myself, have at least one gun and at least\r\n     enough ammunition to make it useful.\r\n\r\nThe riot furnished the gang and hoodlum element a chance to indulge\r\nin lawlessness. Fear of death and injury may help to hold that element\r\nin check. But it cannot be argued that fear of punishment is much of a\r\nfactor, for very few convictions of rioters were secured.\r\n\r\nQuick justice would have been a salutary means of curbing tendencies\r\nto riot, according to both the coroner's jury and the grand jury. The\r\ncoroner's jury said: \"One remedy for race rioting is a speedy conviction\r\nand punishment of those guilty, regardless of race or color, giving\r\nall concerned a fair and impartial hearing.\" Its eighth recommendation\r\nreads: \"Above all, a strict enforcement of the law by public officials,\r\nfair and impartial, will do more than any other agency in restoring\r\nthe good name of Chicago, and prevent rioting from any cause from again\r\ndisturbing the peace of our city.\"\r\n\r\nThe August, 1919, grand jury said: \"This jury feels that in order to\r\nallay further race prejudice and to prevent the re-enactment of shameful\r\ncrimes committed during the recent riots, efficient, prompt, and fearless\r\njustice on the part of the judiciary be meted out to the guilty ones,\r\nwhether they be white or black.\"\r\n\r\nIn a fair consideration of whether swift and impartial justice was meted\r\nout, it must be noted that it was extremely hard to secure evidence\r\nsufficient for successful prosecution. Police attention upon arriving\r\nat the scene of a clash was directed more to removing the injured than\r\napprehending the guilty. Where attempts were made to search out the\r\noffenders, it was next to impossible to get results on account of the\r\nkeen race consciousness which made Negroes disclaim knowledge of Negro\r\nculprits and white people deny seeing specific white men act aggressively.\r\nMany of the crowds were neighborhood gatherings and leaders were often\r\nthe sons of neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn most of the riot cases brought before the state's attorney's office\r\nthe same difficulty was experienced. Whole blocks of residents were\r\nsubpoenaed and accurately described the assaults, but failed entirely to\r\nrecognize any of the assailants. The grand jury found the same obstacle.\r\nThe foreman, referring to the kind of testimony brought before that body\r\nby Negroes on complaints against whites, said: \"... they [the grand\r\njury] usually found it to be hearsay testimony. Some other individual\r\ntold them about So-and-So. That a crime had been committed there was no\r\nquestion, but to get at the root of it was absolutely impossible.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of these difficulties, those familiar with the riot situation\r\nbelieve that more arrests of active rioters might have been made\r\nand more convictions obtained. A study of the riot deaths shows that\r\njustice failed to be as swift and sure as the coroner's and grand juries\r\nrecommended. The blame for this failure is variously placed on the police,\r\nstate's attorney, judge, or jury, according to the prejudice of the one\r\nattempting to fix blame, or his connection with any of these agencies.\r\nThe fact remains that the punitive results of the legal processes were\r\ntoo negligible to furnish a proper deterrent to future rioters.\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-eight persons whose death constituted the riot's principal\r\ntoll--\r\n\r\nFifteen met death at the hands of mobs. The coroners' jury recommended\r\nthat the members of the unknown mobs be apprehended. None were ever found.\r\n\r\nSix were killed under circumstances establishing no criminal\r\nresponsibility: three white men were killed by Negroes in self-defense,\r\nand three Negroes were shot by policemen in the discharge of their duty.\r\n\r\nFour Negroes lost their lives in the Angelus riot. The coroner made no\r\nrecommendations, and the cases were not carried farther.\r\n\r\nFour cases--two Negro and two white--led to recommendations from\r\nthe coroner's jury for further investigation of certain persons, but\r\nsufficient evidence was lacking for indictments.\r\n\r\nNine cases resulted in indictments, four of which led to convictions.\r\n\r\nThus in only four cases was criminal responsibility for death fixed and\r\npunishment meted out to the guilty.\r\n\r\nIndictments and convictions are divided according to the race of the\r\npersons criminally involved as follows:\r\n\r\n     ====================================================\r\n                     |     Negro       |     White\r\n     ----------------+-------+---------+-------+---------\r\n                     | Cases | Persons | Cases | Persons\r\n                     +-------+---------+-------+---------\r\n     Indictments[10] |   6   |    17   |   3   |    4\r\n     Convictions     |   2   |     3   |   2   |    2\r\n     ----------------+-------+---------+-------+---------\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the riot of 1919 aroused many citizens of both\r\nraces to a quickened sense of the suffering and disgrace which had come\r\nand might come again to the community, and developed a determination to\r\nprevent a recurrence of so disastrous an outbreak of race hatred. This\r\nwas manifest, as another section of this report shows, in the courage and\r\ncontrol which people of both races displayed on at least two occasions\r\nin 1920 when confronted suddenly with events out of which serious riots\r\nmight easily have grown.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MILK WAS DISTRIBUTED FOR THE BABIES]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PROVISIONS WERE SUPPLIED BY THE RED CROSS TO HUNDREDS OF\r\n   NEGRO FAMILIES]\r\n\r\nThis examination of the facts of the riot reveals certain outstanding\r\nfeatures, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The riot violence was not continuous, hour by hour, but was\r\nintermittent.\r\n\r\n2. The greatest number of injuries occurred in the district west of\r\nWentworth Avenue, inclusive of Wentworth, and south of the Chicago\r\nRiver to Fifty-fifth Street, or, broadly speaking, in the Stock Yards\r\ndistrict. The next greatest number occurred in the so-called \"Black\r\nBelt,\" Twenty-second to Thirty-ninth streets, inclusive, Wentworth to\r\nthe lake, exclusive of Wentworth; Thirty-ninth to Fifty-fifth streets,\r\ninclusive, Clark Street to Michigan Avenue, exclusive of Michigan.\r\n\r\n3. Organized raids occurred only after a period of sporadic clashes and\r\nspontaneous mob outbreaks.\r\n\r\n4. Main thoroughfares witnessed 76 per cent of the injuries on the South\r\nSide. The streets which suffered most severely were State, Halsted,\r\nThirty-first, Thirty-fifth, and Forty-seventh. Transfer corners were\r\nalways centers of trouble.\r\n\r\n5. Most of the rioting occurred after working hours. This was particularly\r\ntrue after the street-car strike started.\r\n\r\n6. Gangs, particularly among the young whites, formed definite nuclei\r\nfor crowd and mob leadership. \"Athletic clubs\" supplied the leaders of\r\nmany gangs.\r\n\r\n7. Whites usually employed fists and clubs in their attacks upon Negroes;\r\nNegroes used firearms and knives in their attacks.\r\n\r\n8. Crowds and mobs engaged in rioting were usually composed of a small\r\nnucleus of leaders and an acquiescing mass of spectators. The leaders\r\nwere young men, usually between sixteen and twenty-one. Dispersal was\r\nmost effectively accomplished by sudden, unexpected gun fire.\r\n\r\n9. Rumor kept the crowds in an excited, potential mob state. The press\r\nwas responsible for wide dissemination of much of the inflammatory matter\r\nin spoken rumors, though editorials calculated to allay race hatred and\r\nhelp the forces of order were factors in the restoration of peace.\r\n\r\n10. The police lacked sufficient forces for handling the riot; they were\r\nhampered by the Negroes' distrust of them; routing orders and records\r\nwere not handled with proper care; certain officers were undoubtedly\r\nunsuited to police or riot duty.\r\n\r\n11. The personnel of the militia employed in this riot was of an unusually\r\nhigh type. This unquestionably accounts for the confidence placed in\r\nthem by both races. Riot training, definite orders, and good staff work\r\ncontributed to their efficiency.\r\n\r\n12. The machinery of justice was affected by prejudices and political\r\nrivalries.\r\n\r\nFrom their reviews of the evidence brought before them, the coroner's\r\njury and the grand jury presented analyses of the riot, and each made\r\nrecommendations of a remedial sort. These recommendations follow:\r\n\r\n\r\nCORONER'S JURY RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n     1. We believe that a representative committee of white and\r\n     colored people, working together, could suggest and bring\r\n     about the necessary and advisable changes.\r\n\r\n     2. In specifically attacking the housing situation: The\r\n     correction of the evil by enlarging the living quarters and\r\n     placing them in a better sanitary state would in part solve\r\n     the difficulty. We believe voluntary segregation would follow\r\n     and to a considerable extent remove one cause of unrest.\r\n\r\n     This is a matter that might well be considered by the Real\r\n     Estate Board and by improvement clubs and organizations of\r\n     property owners in the South Division, and by the Health\r\n     Department.\r\n\r\n     3. In regard to the \"athletic clubs\": Properly governed and\r\n     controlled they should be encouraged and fostered and, when\r\n     necessary, disciplined.\r\n\r\n     4. Hoodlumism evokes this comment: Citizens of Chicago, make\r\n     your hoodlum element amenable to law, break up and destroy\r\n     hoodlumism as you would a pestilence. It is our belief that\r\n     this element can be brought under control of the law, and it\r\n     must be done if we are to remove the danger of rioting from any\r\n     cause. Vicious hoodlumism, entirely aside from race hatred,\r\n     was present in practically all of the thirty-eight killings,\r\n     known as race riots.\r\n\r\n     5. We earnestly urge that fathers and mothers teach their\r\n     children the lesson of remaining at home when rioting occurs,\r\n     and furthermore, they should be kept occupied, as idleness\r\n     and bad association often cause young people to become bad\r\n     men and women.\r\n\r\n     6. One remedy for race rioting is a speedy conviction and\r\n     punishment of those guilty, regardless of race or color, giving\r\n     all concerned a fair and impartial hearing.\r\n\r\n     7. Tolerance must be practiced between both white and colored in\r\n     the discussion of the race problem, practiced in our everyday\r\n     intercourse, in public conveyances, and in meetings of all\r\n     kinds.\r\n\r\n     8. Our attention was called strikingly to the fact that at the\r\n     time of race rioting the arrests made for rioting by the police\r\n     of colored rioters were far in excess of the arrests made of\r\n     white rioters. The failure of the police to arrest impartially\r\n     at the time of rioting, whether from insufficient effort or\r\n     otherwise, was a mistake and had a tendency to further incite\r\n     and aggravate the colored population.\r\n\r\n     9. In cases of murder it is of the utmost importance that\r\n     expert criminologists should arrive on the scene at the\r\n     earliest possible moment, and that a complete examination may\r\n     be made of the scene of the murder before the body is removed\r\n     or handled, and while the necessary evidence for conviction\r\n     may be obtained, which otherwise may be lost or destroyed. We\r\n     have found in the riot cases many instances where the removal\r\n     of bodies by inexperienced men, in some cases police officers,\r\n     destroyed valuable evidence.\r\n\r\n     We heartily concur with Coroner Hoffman as to the fact that\r\n     Chicago badly needs a permanent murder-investigation squad,\r\n     which the coroner planned and has so persistently advocated\r\n     in the past. We believe that this squad should be equipped\r\n     with motor vehicles and subject to call at any hour of the\r\n     day or night. This squad should consist of six or more trained\r\n     policemen, working in relays of eight hours, a photographer,\r\n     a finger-print expert, a coroner's physician and chemist, the\r\n     coroner or deputy coroner, and a state's attorney. In addition\r\n     thereto, two trained policemen from the police department\r\n     precinct wherein the murder occurred, and a representative\r\n     of the City News Bureau. This squad should be available for\r\n     immediate service, and it should be the duty of the police at\r\n     the scene of the murder to allow no one to handle the body or\r\n     enter premises where murder occurred until the arrival of the\r\n     squad.\r\n\r\n     10. The police force should be enlarged. It is too small to\r\n     cope with the needs of Chicago, and under the present living\r\n     conditions the policeman's pay is entirely inadequate and\r\n     should be substantially increased.\r\n\r\n     Superannuated and incapacitated members of the police force\r\n     should be retired under a proper and satisfactory pension\r\n     system.\r\n\r\n     There should be organization of the force for riot work, for\r\n     the purpose of controlling rioting in its incipient stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND JURY RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n     1. It is reasonable to believe that the colored people, if\r\n     provided with proper housing facilities and an area sufficient\r\n     in extent, would voluntarily segregate themselves. The present\r\n     neighborhood known as the \"Black Belt\" could, by reasonable\r\n     public improvement, assisted by our leading public citizens,\r\n     be made a decent place to live in for a much larger population\r\n     than it now accommodates.... This movement should enlist the\r\n     financial and moral support of the industries employing large\r\n     numbers of the black race.\r\n\r\n     2. Facilities for bathing, playgrounds, police protection,\r\n     better housing and neighborhood conditions, are matters\r\n     deserving the earnest attention of the proper authorities.\r\n\r\n     3. The employment of the colored people is imperative to the\r\n     welfare of this community. Discriminating against the Negro,\r\n     or, in other words, failure to give him an opportunity to make\r\n     an honest livelihood after having induced him to migrate to\r\n     this section of the country, simply adds to the already far\r\n     too great number of hoodlums that infest our city.\r\n\r\n     4. This jury feels that in order to allay further race prejudice\r\n     and to prevent the re-enactment of shameful crimes committed\r\n     during the recent riots, efficient, prompt, and fearless\r\n     justice on the part of the law-enforcing officers, as well\r\n     as on the part of the judiciary, be meted out to the guilty\r\n     ones, whether they be white or black.\r\n\r\n     5. ... There is a lack of co-operation and harmony among the\r\n     agencies of law enforcement, which impairs their efficiency,\r\n     leads to miscarriages of justice, and wastes the public funds.\r\n\r\n     6. The parole law should be amended so that a criminal once\r\n     paroled and subsequently arrested may not a second time be\r\n     paroled.\r\n\r\n     7. The efficiency of the police force would be further greatly\r\n     increased by the co-operation of the judiciary in refusing to\r\n     grant wholesale continuances without carefully scrutinizing the\r\n     results thereof when members of the police force are required\r\n     to act as witnesses.\r\n\r\n     8. The police department is in need of a thorough\r\n     house-cleaning. Every officer, no matter what his position\r\n     is, who fails in his full duty should be dismissed. Grafters\r\n     and those who allow themselves to be dominated by political\r\n     influences, who are paid to protect the lives and property of\r\n     our citizens, should be dismissed and punished to the fullest\r\n     extent of the law.\r\n\r\n     9. It is the opinion of this jury that the police force is\r\n     also inadequate in numbers, and at least one thousand (1,000)\r\n     officers should be added to the existing force.\r\n\r\n     10. Policemen who have arrived at the age where their usefulness\r\n     is a matter of the past should be pensioned, notwithstanding\r\n     their present number, and notwithstanding the fact that the\r\n     pension fund is already taxed to its utmost. The needed funds\r\n     for this purpose should be provided.\r\n\r\n     11. ... payment of salaries to public officers commensurate\r\n     with the increased cost of living.\r\n\r\n     12. The authorities employed to enforce the law should\r\n     thoroughly investigate clubs and other organizations posing\r\n     as athletic and social clubs which really are organizations\r\n     of hoodlums and criminals formed for the purpose of furthering\r\n     the interest of local politics.\r\n\r\n     13. The jury also finds that vice of all kinds is rampant in\r\n     the \"Black Belt,\" and a thorough cleaning up of that district is\r\n     absolutely essential to the peace and welfare of the community.\r\n\r\n     14. Political influence to a large extent is responsible for\r\n     the brazenness with which the Chicago bum, pickpocket, and gun\r\n     and hold-up man operates. It is also the opinion of the jury\r\n     that the indeterminate-sentence law frequently operates in a\r\n     miscarriage of justice, and it is our opinion that the court\r\n     should fix the sentence of offenders at the time of their\r\n     conviction.\r\n\r\n     15. Because of the large number of young boys involved in the\r\n     rioting, the jury recommends the resumption of the activities\r\n     of the Y.M.C.A., the Knights of Columbus, and Salvation Army,\r\n     as well as other similar organizations....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOTHER OUTBREAKS IN ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MINOR CLASHES IN AND NEAR CHICAGO\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CLASHES IN CHICAGO PRECEDING THE RIOT OF 1919\r\n\r\nThe race riot of 1919 in Chicago was preceded by a long series of\r\nmore or less serious clashes between whites and Negroes. Some of these\r\nare discussed in the section of this report dealing with contacts in\r\nrecreation. Others are here described to show the development of friction\r\nand conflict leading up to the 1919 riot. Two brutal and unprovoked\r\nmurders of Negroes by gangs of white hoodlums preceded the riot by only\r\na few weeks.\r\n\r\nIn many of the antecedent clashes a conspicuous part was played by gangs\r\nor clubs of white boys and young men. These operations frequently showed\r\norganization, and the gangsters were often armed with brass knuckles,\r\nclubs, and revolvers.\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier clashes, however, did not have their origin in gang\r\nactivities. For instance, it may be that the resentment by whites of\r\nthe coming of Negroes into their neighborhood inspired the crowd of boys\r\nbetween twelve and sixteen years of age who, in February, 1917, stoned\r\na four-flat building at 456 West Forty-sixth Street. Two Negro families\r\nmoved into the two second-floor flats of this building. The next afternoon\r\nabout 100 boys from nearby schools stoned the building. The two Negroes\r\nattempted to remonstrate but were driven back. One of them reached the\r\noffice of the agent of the building, who notified the police. A patrol\r\nwagon responded, but the boys had disappeared. After it had gone the\r\nboys reappeared and renewed the stoning. Every window in the upper part\r\nof the building was broken. On a second riot call Captain Caughlin and\r\nLieutenant James McGann and a squad of police rescued the Negroes, who\r\nshortly afterward sought other quarters.\r\n\r\nDetectives learned the identity of thirty of the boys, some of whom\r\nconfessed. With their parents they were compelled to appear at the Stock\r\nYards police station and pay for the damage inflicted.\r\n\r\nThe death of a white man, wrongly thought to have been murdered by\r\nNegroes, led to rioting on the night of July 3, 1917, in which a party of\r\nwhite men in an automobile fired upon a group of Negroes at Fifty-third\r\nand Federal streets. Apparently no one was hit. Earlier in the evening\r\nCharles A. Maronde, a saloon-keeper at 5161 South State Street, had been\r\nfound dead following an altercation with Negroes whose passage through\r\nhis premises had irritated him. Two shots were fired, but it was not\r\nproved whether by Maronde or by the Negroes. A coroner's jury found that\r\nhe had died of heart disease.\r\n\r\nIn July and August, 1917, there were minor outbreaks of trouble between\r\nNegroes and naval recruits from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station.\r\nIn some instances recruits and in others Negroes were reported to be\r\nthe aggressors.\r\n\r\nWhen organized gangs took part in clashes the results were more serious.\r\nA typical case started in the Kohler saloon at South State and Fifty-first\r\nstreets on May 27, 1919, two months before the riot.\r\n\r\nA group of about ten white men entered the saloon together. When a Negro\r\ncame in and called for a drink, one of the whites knocked him down and\r\nkicked him out of the front door. Arming himself with brickbats, the\r\nNegro called on the whites to come out. The gang crossed to another\r\nsaloon on the opposite corner, and when they left it shortly afterward,\r\nthey carried revolvers. They then beat the Negro, cutting his head. Dr.\r\nHomer Cooper, whose office is above the Kohler saloon, and one of his\r\npatients, Michael Pantaliono, witnessed the affray.\r\n\r\nRoscoe C. Johnston, a Negro plain-clothes man who had been on the police\r\nforce only four days, was told of the trouble by a citizen and found\r\nthe gang in the second saloon. As he approached, Mart. Flannigan drew\r\na revolver. Johnston called two plain-clothes men, who chanced to be\r\noutside, to summon a patrol wagon, then followed the gang back to the\r\nKohler saloon and disarmed and arrested Flannigan. Johnston found three\r\nautomatic revolvers behind the bar in the saloon and arrested three more\r\nof the men for carrying concealed weapons. Later six more of the men\r\nwere taken when the patrol wagon returned to Kohler's, including Patten,\r\nthe bartender.\r\n\r\nThe cases of these ten men were dismissed when they came to trial a\r\nweek later before Judge Grant; lack of evidence was the reason given.\r\nFlannigan explained that he carried the gun to protect himself while\r\ntaking money to the bank. These young men were said by onlookers to be\r\nmembers of \"Ragen's Colts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ragen's Colts\" were frequently identified with lawlessness and specific\r\nclashes before and during the riot. They are typical of the gangs and\r\n\"athletic clubs\" which were responsible for much disorder, including\r\nattacks upon Negroes. This organization was sponsored by Frank Ragen,\r\na politician whose record and methods have long offended the decent\r\ncitizenship of Chicago. As a member of the Board of Cook County\r\nCommissioners, he allied himself with a spoils-seeking majority against\r\nwhich two or three public-spirited members waged a courageous struggle.\r\nHis participation in the Board's deliberations was marked by such conduct\r\nas the hurling of a large record book and inkwells at members who opposed\r\nthe \"ring.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of his political following he gathered about him the young\r\nhoodlums who make up an important element of the club on which he bestowed\r\nhis name. Ragen's influence has often been able to protect the \"Colts\"\r\nfrom punishment for criminal acts, including the persecution of Negroes.\r\n\r\nOther \"athletic\" and \"social\" clubs, though not so notorious, have been\r\nof a like nature. Miss Mary McDowell, head resident of the University\r\nof Chicago Social Settlement, told the Commission that she knew of five\r\nsuch clubs composed of young men between seventeen and twenty-two:\r\n\r\n     Especially before the war they were always under obligation\r\n     to some politician for renting a store and paying the initial\r\n     expenses of their clubs. That's what started them, and it has\r\n     come to be quite the fashion to get an empty store with big\r\n     panes of glass on which they like to put their names. I am\r\n     speaking now of \"back of the Yards\" conditions.\r\n\r\n     The Ragen Club is mostly Irish-American. The others are from\r\n     the second generation of many nationalities. I don't think\r\n     they have deliberate criminal desires. I think they get into\r\n     these ways, and then they are used and exploited often by\r\n     politicians.... It is about the most dangerous thing that\r\n     we have in the city. Whether the police could not stop them\r\n     at the time of the riot on the Monday when they went down\r\n     Forty-seventh Street with firearms showing in their hands in\r\n     autos (a young man living with us can give you his affidavit\r\n     on it) and shouting as they went, \"We'll get those niggers!\" I\r\n     don't suppose anybody would want to say, but the fact remains\r\n     that nobody did stop them. They went across Halsted Street\r\n     towards State Street. Four policemen were there and they never\r\n     stopped them at all.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Addams, of Hull-House, also described to the Commission the\r\nway in which the ward politicians are responsible for these clubs. She\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The politicians have had a new trick the last few years all\r\n     over the city. They pay rent, as Miss McDowell said, for clubs\r\n     of boys below the voting age. The politician used to take\r\n     care of the young voter and the boy nearly a voter, but now\r\n     he comes down to boys of thirteen and fourteen and fifteen and\r\n     begins to pay their rent and give them special privileges and\r\n     keeps the police off when they are gambling. The whole boy\r\n     problem is very much more mixed up with these--I won't call\r\n     them gangs, but they are clubs with more or less political\r\n     affiliations. They are not always loyal to their political\r\n     boss, but he expects them to be and they are, more or less.\r\n\r\nThe gangs and \"athletic clubs\" became more boldly active in the spring\r\nof 1919. On the night of June 21, five weeks before the riot, there\r\nwere two wanton murders of Negroes by gangs of white hoodlums. One of\r\nthe Negroes was Sanford Harris, the other Joseph Robinson. There is\r\nno evidence that either had been offensive in any way, yet they were\r\ndeliberately killed by gangs. There is evidence that the gangs in the\r\nneighborhoods of these crimes had spread such fear among Negro residents\r\nthat murders of this kind were not unexpected.\r\n\r\nHarris lived on Dearborn Street between Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh\r\nstreets. About 11:30 P.M. on June 21 he escorted from his home to a\r\nstreet car at State and Fifty-seventh streets a woman friend who had\r\nbeen calling on his wife. A Negro man, woman, and child alighted from\r\nthis car, and Harris walked behind them west on Fifty-seventh Street on\r\nhis way home. A number of white youths approached the man, woman, and\r\nchild, one of the gang saying, \"Let's get that nigger,\" referring to the\r\nman. Because of the child's presence they were allowed to pass unmolested.\r\n\r\nThen the gang caught sight of Harris, who started to run across a vacant\r\nlot toward his home. A shot was fired and Harris fell after going a short\r\ndistance. He died at the Cook County Hospital from peritonitis due to\r\nthe bullet wound.\r\n\r\nA woman living near Fifty-seventh and Dearborn streets caught hold of\r\none of the gang who had a pistol in his hand. A plain-clothes policeman\r\nappeared, and she called upon him to arrest the gangster who, she said,\r\nhad shot Harris. The detective merely asked how she was able to pick out\r\nthe man who had fired the shot. Apparently he ignored the fact that the\r\nman held a revolver in his hand, nor does it appear that he even looked\r\nto see whether it had been recently discharged.\r\n\r\nA Mrs. T----, who lived above the saloon at the northwest corner of State\r\nand Fifty-seventh streets, had witnessed the assault on Harris from her\r\nback porch. When other plain-clothes men came upon the scene, she told\r\nthem that the gang had hidden under the viaduct on Fifty-seventh Street\r\nwest of Dearborn, but there were no arrests and apparently no attempts\r\nto make any.\r\n\r\nEarlier the same evening, an altercation had taken place between a number\r\nof white boys from sixteen to twenty years of age and Thomas Johnson,\r\na Negro who, with a Mrs. Moss, conducted a store next to a saloon at\r\nState and Fifty-seventh streets. The boys had been loafing outside the\r\ndoor and using foul language. Johnson remonstrated with them and finally\r\ngot a stick and started after them. A number of other Negroes aided in\r\ndriving off the boys, who, as they left, threatened to \"get a gang and\r\ncome back and get you.\" It is thought that this was the gang that killed\r\nHarris.\r\n\r\nJoseph Robinson, the other Negro killed that same night, had lived at\r\n514 West Fifty-fourth Place. He was forty-seven years of age, a laborer\r\nfor the Union Coal Company, and had a wife and six children, the oldest\r\nseventeen years of age. He was attacked by a gang at Fifty-fifth Street\r\nand Princeton Avenue, apparently without provocation, and received knife\r\nwounds in the back and left leg. He died from shock and hemorrhages on\r\nJune 23.\r\n\r\nA man named Morden, who lived at 5713 Drexel Avenue, testified at the\r\nRobinson inquest that he had met a gang of from fifteen to thirty men\r\nat Fifty-fifth Street and Shields Avenue about a block from Princeton\r\nAvenue. He said the gang was walking rapidly east and divided to pass\r\nhim. He was not far away when Robinson was attacked. The Negro had\r\nevidently been coming in the opposite direction, west on Fifty-fifth\r\nStreet (Garfield Boulevard) and the assault began the instant he met\r\nthe gang. Morden heard a shot fired and saw Robinson stagger across\r\nthe street to a candy store. He saw several men rush forward and help\r\nRobinson in the door as the gang scattered. Morden declared that several\r\nof the gang carried clubs, and that he saw several of these during the\r\nassault.\r\n\r\nNicholas Gianakas, who conducted the candy store at 5458 Princeton\r\nAvenue, into which the wounded man had run, testified that he heard the\r\nshot and saw people outside running in all directions. He saw Robinson\r\ncoming in the door with blood running off him. Presently Robinson got\r\nup and went outside to sit on the curb. Gianakas called up the police\r\nstation for an ambulance. He saw no weapons in the hands of any of the\r\ncrowd outside and recognized none of them. He heard people saying that\r\na mob had come from \"the Yards.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Paul Byrne, a patrolman, testified that he had been called from\r\nhis beat at Fifty-fifth and State streets by a man in an automobile, who\r\ndrove him to the candy store. There he also telephoned for an ambulance,\r\nthen went out and rounded up \"some kids\" on suspicion. There was a big\r\ncrowd around, he said, men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nOne man testified at the inquest that an acquaintance spoke of having\r\nseen a Greek run out of the candy store and hit Robinson on the head\r\nwith a hammer or hatchet. But this acquaintance, when called to testify,\r\ndenied the story.\r\n\r\nCaptain Caughlin, in charge of the police of that precinct, testified\r\nthat a number of men had been arrested on suspicion, but all of them\r\nhad been discharged because none of them knew anything about the matter.\r\nPeople had been running in every direction, he said, there had been a good\r\ndeal of commotion, and he seemed to think it would have been virtually\r\nimpossible for the police to find any of the guilty persons.\r\n\r\nC. L. McCutcheon, a Negro railway postal clerk, living at 517 West\r\nFifty-fourth Place, testified at the inquest that he had been threatened\r\nby mobs, that a gang over on the boulevard had so terrorized the fifteen\r\nor twenty \"colored boys\" in the neighborhood for a long time that none\r\nof them dared to go about alone; that he himself had two boys who would\r\nnot go on Halsted Street for $10 a trip.\r\n\r\nFollowing the killing of Harris and Robinson notices were posted along\r\nGarfield Boulevard and some neighboring streets saying that the authors\r\nof the notices would \"get\" all the \"niggers\" on July 4, 1919. These\r\nnotices also called for help from sympathizers. They predicted that\r\nthere would be a street-car strike on the appointed day, and that then\r\nthey expected to run all Negroes out of the district. Some witnesses\r\nat the inquest stated that the Negroes of the district, who up to that\r\ntime had done nothing to protect themselves, were advised by friendly\r\nwhites to \"prepare for the worst,\" as trouble could scarcely be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. RACIAL OUTBREAK IN WAUKEGAN\r\n\r\nMay 31 and June 2, 1920\r\n\r\nWaukegan, Illinois, thirty-six miles north of Chicago and near the Great\r\nLakes Naval Training Station of the United States Navy, was the scene\r\nof two riotous attacks during the nights of May 31 and June 2, 1920,\r\non a lodging-house for Negroes, by bands of recruits on leave from the\r\nNaval Training Station. No lives were lost, and only two persons were\r\nhurt, neither of them seriously.\r\n\r\nThese outbursts scarcely classify as race riots. The chief motive seems\r\nto have been a desire for excitement on the part of young and active\r\nnaval recruits.\r\n\r\nThe Sherman House was a dilapidated place on Genesee Street, the main\r\nstreet of the town. It had been abandoned by whites and was run as a\r\nlodging-house for thirty or thirty-five unmarried Negroes, chiefly factory\r\nworkers. On the first floor was a poolroom and soft-drink \"parlor,\"\r\nwhich some of the naval recruits had patronized.\r\n\r\nA mischievous Negro boy of ten years, George Taylor, was primarily\r\nresponsible for the outbreaks. On the afternoon of May 31 he and his\r\nlittle sister had been throwing stones at passing automobiles in Sheridan\r\nRoad. One of these missiles broke the wind shield of an automobile driven\r\nby Lieutenant A. F. Blazier, an officer at the Great Lakes Station,\r\nwho allowed this fact to become known to some of the recruits at the\r\nstation. Late that evening an unorganized mob of recruits assembled at\r\nthe Sherman House and threw stones, breaking nearly all the windows.\r\nThe mob was rushed by all the available police in Waukegan, who took\r\nsix prisoners. One reported incident was the chasing of a Negro by half\r\na dozen bluejackets and marines and his rescue by the police.\r\n\r\nProvost guards from the Naval Station rounded up the rioters and took\r\nthem back to Great Lakes, thus ending the outbreak.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later, or June 2, 150 boys on leave from the Naval Training\r\nStation renewed the attack. They gathered in a ravine near the hotel and\r\nat ten o'clock they poured forth, led by a sailor carrying an American\r\nflag. The police had been warned and were ready with reinforcements.\r\n\r\nAbout seventy-five feet from the lodging-house the police ordered the\r\nattackers to halt; no attention was paid to the command, and they fired\r\ntheir riot guns in the air, wounding two marines who were some distance\r\naway. Hand-to-hand fighting ensued, during which the police seized the\r\nflag and arrested two marines. The Great Lakes boys gathered about the\r\npolice station and demanded their comrades.\r\n\r\nCommander M. M. Frucht, executive officer of the Naval Station, who\r\nhad already been sent to Waukegan by Commandant Bassett, appeared at\r\nthe door and quieted the crowd with a promise that all concerned would\r\nhave a square deal. He also advised them to return at once to the Naval\r\nStation.\r\n\r\nThe police released the two prisoners and gave back the flag. Two hundred\r\nprovost guards from the Naval Station arrived in motor trucks while the\r\ncrowd was at the police station.\r\n\r\nWaukegan youths, evidently banded together for the purpose, searched the\r\nhouse of Edward Dorsey, Negro, at 905 Market Street, on the night of\r\nJune 5. Ten of them, ranging from seventeen to twenty-two years, were\r\narrested. They said they had heard that five white persons were held\r\nprisoners in Dorsey's home and that it was their intention to effect a\r\nrescue. It was asserted that a number of provost guards accompanied the\r\ncrowd to the Dorsey house.\r\n\r\nThe general spirit of the people of Waukegan regarding Negroes may be\r\njudged from a proclamation by Mayor J. F. Bidinger, in which he disclaimed\r\nfor the people of the city any intention to harass the Negro. Referring\r\nto reports that some of the white people of the town had participated\r\nin the disturbances, the mayor said: \"In the first they did not, and\r\nin the second in no great numbers. Hoodlums generally run true to form\r\nand seldom overlook ready-made opportunity to manifest their peculiar\r\ntaste in deviltry. Hence the mixing of a few of them into these fracases\r\nsignifies nothing in so far as our general public is concerned.\"\r\n\r\nObservers agreed with the mayor that the disturbances were not race\r\nriots. In this connection his proclamation said:\r\n\r\n     Now it is a definitely ascertained fact that no adult Negro was\r\n     even remotely connected with the first stone-throwing; that\r\n     the colored people did not then retaliate and have not since\r\n     sought to retaliate in even the smallest measure; and that all\r\n     the episodes have consisted simply of an attack upon people\r\n     who have been as inoffensive throughout the entire affair as\r\n     they could well be. All of which I submit stamps this affair\r\n     as an example of disorderly conduct indeed, but not as a race\r\n     riot.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE \"ABYSSINIAN\" AFFAIR\r\n\r\nSunday afternoon, June 20, 1920, a small group of Negroes styling\r\nthemselves \"Abyssinians\" ended a parade of their \"order\" in front of\r\na café at 209 East Thirty-fifth Street frequented by both whites and\r\nNegroes. After a brief ceremony one of the leaders produced an American\r\nflag and deliberately burned it. He then began to destroy a second flag\r\nin the same manner. Two white policemen remonstrated with the men but\r\nwere intimidated by threats and a brandishing of revolvers. They left\r\nimmediately to notify police headquarters. Patrolman Owens, Negro,\r\narrived as a second flag was lighted. Rushing up to the leader who held\r\nthe burning flag in his hands and remonstrating with the group for their\r\ndisloyalty, he was immediately shot and wounded. Robert Lawson Rose, a\r\nsailor on leave from the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, protested\r\nagainst the destruction of the flag and he too was shot; he staggered\r\ninto the doorway of a cigar store at 207 East Thirty-fifth Street. Some\r\nof the parade leaders got rifles from a closed automobile which had\r\nfollowed the parade and was standing near by, and fired into the cigar\r\nstore. One of these bullets killed Joseph Hoyt, a clerk in the store.\r\nThe sailor, Rose, also died from his wound. In all about twenty-five\r\nshots were fired during the fracas, and several persons were injured.\r\n\r\nThe men who did the shooting escaped but were arrested later. Crowds\r\nattracted by the demonstration quickly dispersed when the shooting began,\r\nand from then on there was virtually no disorder except for attacks at a\r\nrailroad station on three Negro ministers who were returning to the city\r\nand knew nothing of the shooting. Nine Negroes were arrested and held to\r\nthe grand jury. One of them was Grover Cleveland Redding, thirty-seven\r\nor thirty-eight years of age, who was the \"prophet\" of the \"Abyssinian\"\r\norder in Chicago. Redding, who had admitted the shooting of Rose, was\r\nheld with Oscar McGavick for murder, and the others as accessories after\r\nthe fact.[11]\r\n\r\nThe exact reason for this flag-burning has not been disclosed, although\r\nit was apparently intended to symbolize the feeling of the \"Abyssinian\"\r\nfollowers that it was time to forswear allegiance to the American\r\ngovernment and consider themselves under allegiance to the Abyssinian\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe guns used in the shooting were found by the police in a garage,\r\ntogether with the regalia of the \"Abyssinians,\" and much of their printed\r\nmatter and other effects.[12]\r\n\r\nThe \"Abyssinian\" affair might easily have been turned into another great\r\noutbreak such as that of July, 1919. But the police, profiting by their\r\nexperience of the previous year, were vigilant. They had organized an\r\nemergency force which was quickly mobilized and put in service in the\r\ndistrict. Moreover, there was evident such a feeling of restraint on\r\nthe part of both whites and Negroes that they combined to hunt down the\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\nIndicative of this spirit of co-operation to prevent racial conflict,\r\nand helpful to it, was the careful handling of the matter by the press.\r\nPractically every newspaper gave prominence to the way in which the two\r\nraces worked together to this end, and all dwelt on the courageous action\r\nof the Negro policeman. A picture printed in the _Herald-Examiner_ the\r\nfollowing morning showed people of the two races fraternizing after the\r\nshooting. The _Daily News_ in reporting the affray said that only the\r\nco-operation of the white and Negro merchants of the district stopped the\r\ndisturbance; that rowdies in the neighborhood were ready for a fight,\r\nbut that \"the better class of whites and Negroes worked directly with\r\nthe police to stop any such trouble as a recurrence of the rioting last\r\nsummer, which occurred in the same neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nTo understand the \"Abyssinian\" affair an acquaintance with other\r\ncharacters, certain group propaganda and movements, is necessary. The\r\n\"Back to Africa\" movement, which lent fervor and enthusiasm to the\r\ndevelopment of lawlessness and wanton killing by this group of unlettered\r\nNegroes, has been in progress for more than two years. The Black Star\r\nSteamship Line and the Universal Improvement Association, headed by a\r\nNegro, Marcus Garvey, a British subject, were organized to establish\r\ncommercial relations with Africa. To arouse interest and secure funds\r\nfor the enterprise, sentiment has been created among Negroes for the\r\ndeveloping of sections of Africa where they may govern themselves and\r\nbuild up their own institutions and commerce. The movement has gained\r\nthousands of adherents; although the language of its appeals has\r\nfrequently been extreme, it has engaged in no dangerous or unpatriotic\r\nactivities. Its connection with the tragic incident lies in the\r\nimplication that \"Back to Africa\" means away from the land of unfair\r\ntreatment, and thus suggests contempt for the United States.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PROPAGANDA LITERATURE USED BY \"ABYSSINIANS\" IN\r\n   RECRUITING FOLLOWERS]\r\n\r\nThe \"Star Order of Ethiopia and Ethiopian Missionaries to Abyssinia\"\r\nappears to be an illegitimate offspring of the Universal Improvement\r\nAssociation and the Black Star Steamship Line. The visit of the Abyssinian\r\nMission to this country a year ago to renew a treaty between their country\r\nand the United States probably served as an added suggestion. The leaders\r\nof the movement were Redding, secretary of the order; Joseph Fernon,\r\ncalled the \"Great Abyssinian,\" and his son, \"The Prince.\" Together with\r\na \"Dr.\" R. D. Jonas, a white man who for several years has engaged in\r\nsundry activities among Negroes, they organized this movement among a\r\nclass of Negroes too ignorant to exercise restraint over their racial\r\nresentments.\r\n\r\nEmotionalism was aroused and a semi-religious twist was given through\r\ntheir appeals, which played more or less injudiciously on the desire of\r\nNegroes to improve their economic status and to escape from what some\r\nof them regard as oppression, either in this or in other countries. One\r\nor two other similar organizations are making such an appeal, not only\r\nto Negroes in this country, but to other dark-skinned races throughout\r\nthe world. It is sought to weld them all together into a great nation.\r\nGlittering promises are set before the illiterate element of the Negro\r\nrace, which has responded sufficiently to fatten the purses of some, at\r\nleast, of the \"prophets.\"\r\n\r\nRedding was one of these \"prophets.\" He was influenced by the white man,\r\n\"Dr.\" R. D. Jonas, and had purchased from him the robe or toga which he\r\nwore during the parade of June 20. According to those who knew both men,\r\nhe had first \"stolen Jonas' thunder\" and the following out of which the\r\n\"Star Order of Ethiopia\" had been manufactured. Having lost this, Jonas\r\nwas willing to sell the regalia.\r\n\r\nJonas, it appears, had been promoting one movement after another among\r\nilliterate Negroes for six or seven years. At one time he conducted a\r\nco-operative store on State Street, in which he sold shares. He was often\r\nan orator at street gatherings and had been arrested a number of times.\r\nWhen Alexander Dowie of Zion City died, Jonas is said to have attempted\r\nto put himself into the vacant position. After the East St. Louis riots\r\nhe appeared in Chicago in an express wagon with signs indicating that\r\nhe was collecting funds for the Negroes of East St. Louis.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of the shooting, Jonas had been the principal speaker\r\nat a small, orderly meeting of Negroes in Johnson's Hall, 3516 South\r\nState Street, at which he had launched a campaign for Mayor Thompson as\r\na third-party candidate for president of the United States. The Mayor,\r\nhe said, was the only man who could be trusted \"to carry out Roosevelt's\r\nwork\" and put through the treaty with Abyssinia which expired in 1917.\r\nHe also referred to the efforts of the Jews to return to Palestine and\r\nof the Irish to free themselves from British domination, and suggested\r\nthe desirability of a coalition of the Negro, Jewish, and Irish races.\r\nRedding's hold on many of the Negroes was partly due to the fact that\r\nhe is a Negro and claims to be a native of Abyssinia, whereas Jonas is\r\na white man.\r\n\r\nQuite evidently the \"Back to Abyssinia\" movement was used as a means\r\nfor exploiting credulous Negroes. For one dollar they could purchase\r\nan Abyssinian flag, a small pamphlet containing a prophecy relating to\r\nthe return of the black-skinned people to Africa, a copy of a so-called\r\ntreaty between the United States and Abyssinia, and a picture of the\r\n\"Prince of the Abyssinians.\" Likewise when the propaganda had begun\r\nto take root, one might sign a blank form which would commit him to\r\nreturn to \"my motherland of Ethiopia\" in order that he might fill any\r\none of forty-four positions, such as electrical engineer, mechanical\r\ndraftsman, civil engineer, architect, chemist, sign-painter, cartoonist,\r\nillustrator, traffic manager, teacher, auto-repairing, agriculture, and\r\npoultry-raising. The blank itself was headed:\r\n\r\n                          STAR ORDER OF ETHIOPIA\r\n                                    AND\r\n                   THE ETHIOPIAN MISSIONARY TO ABYSSINIA\r\n\r\n      \"A Prince shall come out of Egypt.

He shall deliver Thee from under\r\nthe heels of Thy Oppressors. He remembers when Asia condemned Him, and\r\nEurope put Him to death, and it was Africa who haven him until King\r\nHerod was dead. It was Africa's son who helped Bare his Cross up to\r\nCalvary. There was Africa's son the Apostle Phillip met, and he carried\r\nthe Gospel to Thy land. It was Thee whose Queen came to King Solomon to\r\nprove him with hard questions. Ethiopia, Thou was first on Earth; Thou\r\nshall be last, for Jehova has spoken it. (See Scrip: Zeph. 3:8, 9, 10;\r\nIsa. 18 Chap.; Ps. 68:30, 31.)\r\n\r\n                          STAR ORDER OF ETHIOPIA\r\n                                    AND\r\n                     ETHIOPIAN MISSIONARY TO ABYSSINIA\r\n\r\n     This is to certify that I have signed my name as an Ethiopian in\r\n     America in sympathy with our motherland Ethiopia. I henceforth\r\n     denounce the name of Negro which was given me by another race.\r\n\r\nAt this point the applicant declares himself ready at any time needed\r\nto fill any of the positions in a list below, which he has checked\r\nand which he is qualified to fill. Blank space appears then for name,\r\naddress, present occupation, city, state, and county. At the bottom\r\nappears the name of George Gabriel, described as \"Abyssinian\" linguist and\r\nnative of Abyssinia, together with that of Grover C. Redding, secretary\r\nand missionary. The applicant is requested to mail the blank to 1812\r\nThirteenth Street, Washington, D.C., in care of Mrs. Dabney, or 115 W.\r\n138th Street, New York City, care of Charles Manson, or Joseph Goldberg,\r\nJaffa, Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe immediate inspiration of the Abyssinians, as previously suggested,\r\nwas a visit to this country, more than a year before, of a delegation\r\nfrom Abyssinia, which had concerned itself with a renewal of the old\r\ntreaty. It is pointed out that the chief reason why Negroes should be\r\ninterested in this treaty is that they might use it to overthrow \"Jim\r\nCrow\" laws in certain states. Under this treaty Abyssinians had been\r\nguaranteed the right to travel at will in the United States under the\r\nprotection of the federal government. Men like Redding had evidently\r\ninterpreted this to mean that under such a treaty the United States\r\nwould be bound to interfere in behalf of Abyssinians, if they should be\r\ndiscriminated against under a \"Jim Crow\" law.\r\n\r\nRedding, however, had some sort of biblical interpretation for his\r\nmovement. He maintained that his mission was indicated in the Bible. He\r\nquoted from the Scriptures these words: \"So shall the King of Assyria\r\nlead away the Egyptian prisoners, the Ethiopian captives, young and old,\r\nto the shame of Egypt.\" Asserting that the Ethiopians do not belong here,\r\nand that they should be taken back to their own country, he construed a\r\nbiblical passage as meaning that the time of their bondage in a foreign\r\ncountry should be the expiration of a 300-year period. This period,\r\nhe said, began in 1619, when Negroes were first taken for purposes of\r\nslavery from Africa to America. He said that the burning of the flag\r\nwas the symbol indicated to him through these biblical passages, and\r\nthe sign that Abyssinians should no longer stay in this country.\r\n\r\nAs to the flag of Abyssinia, he had interpreted it thus: \"The red means\r\nthe blood of Christ; the green, the grass on which he knelt for you\r\nand me; the yellow for the clay. The Ethiopian flag is better known as\r\n'Calvary's flag.'\"\r\n\r\nJonas, from whom Redding had obtained these ideas of a Negro Utopia in\r\nAfrica, claimed that he had introduced to President Wilson the Abyssinian\r\ndelegation which had come to this country. He claimed the credit for\r\nhaving taken Redding into his home and cared for him several years ago\r\nat the behest of Mrs. Jonas, who had told him that he was a \"smart young\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies and manifestations of the \"Abyssinians\" were marked by\r\nsuch fanaticism that responsible Negroes repudiated them and condemned\r\nthe leaders along with other criminals and exploiters of the ignorant\r\nNegroes. The _Negro World_, organ of the Universal Improvement Association\r\nand Black Star Line, carried the following article.\r\n\r\n     Appalled by the violence aroused on Sunday night, when an\r\n     American flag was burned and two men were killed by the\r\n     Abyssinian zealots, colored leaders of the Middle West have\r\n     begun a systematic campaign to eliminate white exploitation\r\n     among the Negroes and to bring about better racial co-operation.\r\n\r\n     The Chicago police announced today that all the men wanted in\r\n     the case, except two, are under arrest. They also promised that\r\n     the career of Grover Cleveland Redding, self-styled \"Prince of\r\n     Abyssinia,\" and identified as a ringleader in the affair, will\r\n     enter a new phase tomorrow when the frock-coated suspect is\r\n     formally charged with murder, accessory to murder and rioting.\r\n\r\n     Oscar McGavick, one of the men sought, was arrested in\r\n     Pittsburgh today. \"Bill\" Briggs and Frank Heans were taken\r\n     into custody here. This leaves the police list with only two\r\n     names, the Fernons, father and son. \"Dr.\" R. D. Jonas, known\r\n     on the South Side as a professional agitator, was released\r\n     today, no evidence having been found of his direct connection\r\n     with the shooting. Federal officials are investigating him.\r\n\r\n     According to the opinions of some of the leaders among\r\n     Chicago Negroes the \"Abyssinian movement,\" from which Sunday\r\n     night's trouble indirectly resulted, is a legitimate and\r\n     valid enterprise. It is but one of the manifestations of that\r\n     bubbling activity which today characterizes the colored people\r\n     of America in their struggle for race progression.\r\n\r\n     The trouble lies, they claim, in a group of exploiters and\r\n     mountebanks, who, unauthorized by real leaders in the movement,\r\n     have seized upon it as a medium for personal gain. In Chicago\r\n     two of these were Jonas and Redding, it is claimed.\r\n\r\nPertinent on this point also is the stand taken by the _Chicago Defender_,\r\namong the most influential of the Negro publications, concerning the\r\nAbyssinians, which said editorially:\r\n\r\n     We warn all agitators, whether they be white or black, that\r\n     this paper, standing as it does for law and order, for justice\r\n     to all men, for that brotherhood without which no country\r\n     can long prosper, and for the better element of our twelve\r\n     millions, that we condemn their disloyalty and will do all in\r\n     our power to aid the constituted authorities in crushing them.\r\n\r\n     The burning of the American flag by a group of self-styled\r\n     Abyssinians at 35th St. and Indiana Avenue last Sunday evening,\r\n     as a means of showing their contempt for the United States,\r\n     and the resultant murders that followed in the wake of this\r\n     demonstration, instead of accomplishing the end desired by these\r\n     malcontents, acted as a boomerang. Every black face portrayed\r\n     indignation. Every black arm was lifted to strike a blow at\r\n     these law-breakers. This is our home, our country, our flag,\r\n     for whose honor and protection we will give our last drop of\r\n     blood. With all our shortcomings it can never truthfully be\r\n     said that we are disloyal or unpatriotic.\r\n\r\nThe real problem indicated by the \"Abyssinian\" affair is how to prevent\r\nself-seekers from playing upon the superstitions and emotions of ignorant\r\nNegroes, to the harm of others and the disturbance of the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE BARRETT MURDER\r\n\r\nThe murder of a white man, Thomas J. Barrett, by a Negro on September\r\n20, 1920, is not particularly significant in itself. But it was committed\r\nin the heart of the district where some of the worst rioting took place\r\nin 1919, it created a situation which might easily have developed into\r\nanother serious riot, and it affords an example of prompt and effective\r\npolice handling.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AFTER THE \"ABYSSINIAN MURDERS\"\r\n   Photograph taken at Thirty-fifth Street and Indiana Avenue, where both\r\n   races co-operated to maintain order.]\r\n\r\nForty-seventh and Halsted streets is the intersection of two main\r\nthoroughfares used by Negroes returning home from work in the Stock\r\nYards. The neighborhood is one where gangs of hoodlums have attacked\r\nNegroes, and is thickly settled with people who have shown considerable\r\nantagonism toward Negroes.\r\n\r\nBarrett, who was a motorman on the Chicago surface lines, was killed\r\nshortly after seven o'clock in the evening. He had had his shoes shined\r\nat the stand of William Sianis, 4720 South Halsted Street, and had\r\npurchased a newspaper at Halsted and Forty-seventh streets at about 7:00\r\nP.M. About the same time three Negroes came out of the yards of Ready &\r\nCallaghan on Halsted Street between Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh, and\r\none of these Negroes went to the news stand seeking a newspaper in which\r\nto roll up his overalls. In an encounter with these Negroes, Barrett\r\nwas fatally stabbed, dying before he reached a hospital. His head was\r\nnearly severed from his body.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes, pursued by a rapidly increasing crowd of whites, ran north\r\nnearly a block on Halsted Street. They turned into a vacant lot and went\r\nthrough alleys until they emerged on Forty-fifth Street near Emerald\r\nAvenue, evidently trying to work their way east to the main Negro\r\nneighborhood. The crowd, however, had thickened so rapidly that they\r\ntook refuge in St. Gabriel's Catholic Church, just east of Lowe Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe mob was checked by the appearance and quieting remarks of Father\r\nThomas M. Burke, pastor of the church. He told them that the Negroes\r\nhad sought sanctuary, that there were laws to punish them, and that it\r\nwas not the province of a mob to wreak summary vengeance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the police were already arriving. A patrol wagon had left\r\nthe Stock Yards station about seven o'clock, and followed the pursuing\r\ncrowd. Acting Lieutenant Bullard telephoned at once to Chief Garrity,\r\nand extra police were quickly thrown into the neighborhood to control\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nSamuel C. Rank, lieutenant of police at the Thirteenth Precinct station,\r\nForty-seventh Place and Halsted Street, had received the alarm about\r\nseven o'clock. He sent five detectives and followed shortly after to\r\nthe scene of the disturbance. He went into the church with Sergeant\r\nBrown and three detectives. Lieutenant Rank forced a number of the mob\r\nto leave the church and locked the doors. Captain Hogan, of the Tenth\r\nPolice Precinct, and Chief Garrity arrived about this time. The three\r\nNegroes were taken through a rear entrance to a patrol wagon in the alley\r\nand removed to the Hyde Park police station, a considerable distance away.\r\n\r\nThe crowd in front of the church had grown by this time to 3,000 or 4,000.\r\nIn order to quiet them they were again addressed by Father Burke, who\r\ntold them the Negroes had been removed from the church. They dispersed\r\nabout 10:30 P.M.\r\n\r\nProfiting by the experience of 1919 Chief Garrity made prompt use of\r\nprearranged plans to check all such disorders in their incipiency. He\r\nimmediately closed saloons and \"clubs\" in which young hoodlums were\r\naccustomed to gather. He had the police patrol the streets by twos. He\r\ndrew a \"dead line\" to prevent Negroes from entering the district. With\r\nhis forces well organized and distributed, he set up headquarters at\r\nthe Stock Yards Precinct station and spent the night there, with Captain\r\nWestbrook, commander of the second battalion of police, Captain Hogan,\r\nand Lieutenant Ira McDonnell, of the Desplaines Street station. Street\r\ncars and automobiles approaching the police \"dead line\" were stopped\r\nand all Negro passengers warned off. Street gatherings were broken up\r\nand people were searched for weapons. People were also kept moving in\r\nthe streets. This display of force undoubtedly had its quieting effect.\r\nNevertheless, a stray Negro was here and there attacked despite the\r\nvigilance of the police.\r\n\r\nDuring the five or six hours following the murder, racial street fights\r\noccurred at Forty-fifth Street and Wabash Avenue. A mob stormed a house\r\nat 229 East Forty-fifth Street, attempted to burn it and did considerable\r\ndamage. Frank Gavin, a white man, 1509 Marquette Road, was shot in the\r\nback during the mobbing of a Negro at Fifty-third Street and Racine\r\nAvenue. Hoodlums pulled Negroes from street cars and beat them. A Negro\r\nwho had been dragged from a car at Thirty-ninth and Emerald Avenue, was\r\nrescued by several white women after he had been severely beaten with\r\nclubs. A man and a small boy, Negroes, were attacked by a gang at Fuller\r\nPark, Forty-fifth Street and Shields Avenue. At Forty-seventh and Halsted\r\nstreets three Negroes were taken from a car and slugged, and two others\r\nhad a similar experience at Forty-seventh Street and Union Avenue. Frank\r\nStevens, a white man, 3738 Langley Avenue, was badly injured by a crowd\r\nof Negroes at Thirty-ninth Street and Normal Avenue.\r\n\r\nPrecautions were continued next day for the protection of Negroes working\r\nin the Stock Yards, and frequenting the district where the disorders had\r\noccurred. This district ran as far west as Racine Avenue and as far east\r\nas Prairie; as far north as Thirty-second Street and as far south as\r\nFifty-third Street. Negroes working at the Stock Yards had police escorts\r\nto and from their work, and the car lines on Halsted and Forty-seventh\r\nand Thirty-fifth streets, and on Racine Avenue, which are much used by\r\nthe Negroes, were especially guarded. Only one clash was recorded the\r\nfollowing day. By six o'clock Wednesday morning, thirty-seven hours\r\nafter the murder, the special police concentration was discontinued.\r\n\r\nNine persons in all were reported injured during this disturbance.\r\nNine men were arrested, including the three Negroes whom Barrett had\r\nencountered. These three were: Samuel Hayes, forty years old, 519\r\nEast Thirty-fifth Street; Henry Snow, thirty-two years old, 517 East\r\nThirty-fifth Street; and Frank Gatewood, forty-three years old, 3446\r\nPrairie Avenue.\r\n\r\nWitnesses at the inquest differed as to whether there was any provocation\r\nfor the stabbing of Barrett. Only one of them testified that he heard\r\nany of the four persons say anything. This was Carl Duwell, a printer,\r\n466 West Twenty-fourth Place, who had just alighted from a Halsted Street\r\ncar. He said that Barrett was following the three colored men and seemed\r\nto be threatening them, saying \"You want to fight?\" One of the Negroes\r\nsuddenly turned and struck at Barrett, slashing his throat. The Negroes\r\nhad been walking fast, with Barrett following a few feet behind them.\r\nAfter he was struck, Barrett staggered a few feet to the curb and fell.\r\n\r\nBarrett's widow said he was not in the habit of carrying weapons, but\r\nit was current talk that he had been arrested a number of times for\r\nstreet fights with Negroes. He had been a policeman in the service of\r\nthe South Park Commission, and was an ex-soldier. William Sianis, at\r\nwhose stand Barrett had his shoes shined just before the murder, said\r\nthat Barrett was apparently sober. Neighborhood gossip was to the effect\r\nthat Barrett had been drinking at McNally's saloon at Forty-seventh and\r\nHalsted streets. Also Duwell's testimony indicated that Barrett had been\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nAccording to Police Captain Hogan, when the Negroes were arrested in the\r\nchurch, knives were found on the persons of two of them. One of these,\r\nSam Hayes, admitted to the police at that time that he had stabbed a\r\nwhite man at Forty-seventh and Halsted streets. His story was that when\r\nhe asked the newsboy at the corner for a newspaper in which to wrap his\r\noveralls, Barrett threatened him and then struck him, and the stabbing\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nDuring the night following the murder, Chief of Police Garrity issued a\r\nstatement which was published conspicuously in the morning newspapers, and\r\nwas most effectively worded to prevent misunderstanding of the incident\r\nand avert use of it to inflame racial hostility. The statement began:\r\n\r\n     There has been no race riot. The killing at Forty-seventh and\r\n     Halsted streets was merely a street-corner fight. There was\r\n     grave danger that it would be followed by serious trouble.\r\n     Precautionary measures were taken at once to forestall the\r\n     recurrence of the riots, with the destruction of life and\r\n     property, of last summer.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a detailed account of the special measures and\r\ndistribution of police to handle the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SPRINGFIELD RIOT\r\n\r\nAugust 14-15, 1908\r\n\r\nThe race riot at Springfield, Illinois, in August, 1908, which cost the\r\nlives of two Negroes and four white men, is an outstanding example of the\r\nracial bitterness and brutality that can be provoked by unsubstantiated\r\nrumor or, as in this case, by deliberate falsehood. The two Negro victims\r\nwere innocent and unoffending. They were lynched under the shadow of\r\nthe capitol of Lincoln's state, within half a mile of the only home he\r\never owned, and two miles from the monument which marks the grave of\r\nthe great emancipator.\r\n\r\nA second fundamental factor in the Springfield riot situation was the\r\nfertile field prepared by admittedly lax law enforcement and by tolerance\r\nin the community of vicious conditions, the worst of which were permitted\r\nto surround the Negro areas.\r\n\r\nThe spark which touched off the explosion was the old story of the\r\nviolation of a white woman by a Negro, and not until the damage had been\r\ndone was its falsity confessed by the woman who had told it.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Friday, August 14, 1908, according to her story, Mrs.\r\nH----, wife of a street-railway conductor, was asleep in her room. She\r\nwas alone in the house. She declared that a Negro entered, dragged her\r\nfrom her bed to the back yard, and there committed the crime. She said\r\nshe had attempted to scream but was choked by her assailant, who left\r\nher lying unconscious in the garden.\r\n\r\nA Negro, George Richardson, who had been at work on a neighboring lawn\r\nthe day before the attack, was accused by Mrs. H---- and was arrested\r\nwhen he returned to work the next morning. He was placed in the county\r\njail and on August 19 he was indicted.\r\n\r\nDuring inquiry by a special grand jury certain facts were disclosed\r\nconcerning Mrs. H--'s character, and she admitted that, though she had\r\nbeen brutally beaten by a white man on the night indicated, Richardson\r\nwas not present and had no connection with the affair. She admitted that\r\nshe had not been raped. For reasons known only to herself, she wished\r\nto keep the name of the real assailant a secret, and therefore she had\r\naccused Richardson. She signed an affidavit exonerating him. Richardson\r\nhad no criminal record. He and two of his family were property owners\r\nin Springfield.\r\n\r\nWhile Richardson was in custody and before he was exonerated, feeling\r\nagainst him was intensified because of the murder, three or four weeks\r\nbefore, of Clergy A. Ballard, a white man, by Joe James, a Negro tramp,\r\nwho was a drug and whiskey addict. James had been taken from a freight\r\ntrain and placed in jail for thirty days and had been released on the\r\nnight of the crime. He was charged with entering the room of Ballard's\r\ndaughter, Blanche, at night. Ballard grappled with him, but James broke\r\naway and ran. In the struggle Ballard was mortally injured. James was\r\nfound asleep in a park near the Ballard home about noon the next day,\r\nunder the influence of a drug. He was tried and hanged, and his body\r\nwas taken back to Mississippi by his mother for interment. Rev. Mr.\r\nDawson, spiritual adviser of James, stated that James declared he had\r\nno knowledge of the crime.\r\n\r\nSpringfield was, therefore, in a receptive mood when, on the morning\r\nof Friday, August 15, it got the first rumors concerning the attack\r\non Mrs. H----. Richardson had been taken before her and partially\r\nidentified. In the afternoon, when it became known that he had been\r\narrested, crowds gathered about the jail. They seemed good-natured\r\nrather than blood-thirsty. It was also known that James, accused of the\r\nBallard murder, occupied a cell in the jail. The sheriff preserved order\r\nthrough the afternoon, no effort being made to disperse the crowd of\r\n300 or 400 persons. About five o'clock Richardson and James were taken\r\nin an automobile to Sherman, north of Springfield, and there they were\r\ntransferred by train to Bloomington.\r\n\r\nAbout 7:00 P.M. leadership began to develop in the mob about the jail.\r\nThe leaders demanded the two Negroes, but were finally convinced by the\r\nsheriff that they were not in the jail. Then the story spread that Harry\r\nLoper, a restaurant keeper, had provided the automobile in which the men\r\nhad been removed. The crowd rushed to the restaurant five blocks away.\r\nIn response to the mob's hootings Loper appeared in the doorway with\r\na firearm in his hand. About 8:30 P.M. someone threw a brick through a\r\nplate-glass window and in a few minutes the front of the restaurant had\r\nbeen smashed out. Then followed the complete wrecking of the restaurant,\r\nas well as the owner's automobile, which had been standing in front.\r\n\r\nWhen the mob began to surge through the town the Fire Department was\r\ncalled to disperse it, but the mob cut the hose. Control having been\r\nlost by the sheriff and police, Governor Deneen called out the militia.\r\nThe mob, by this time very much excited, started for the Negro district\r\nthrough Washington Street, along which a large number of Negroes lived\r\non upper floors. Raiding second-hand stores which belonged to white men,\r\nthe mob secured guns, axes, and other weapons with which it destroyed\r\nplaces of business operated by Negroes and drove out all of the Negro\r\nresidents from Washington Street. Then it turned north into Ninth Street.\r\n\r\nAt the northeast corner of Ninth and Jefferson streets was the frame\r\nbarber shop of Scott Burton, a Negro. The mob set fire to this building.\r\nFrom that point it went a block farther north to Madison Street and then\r\nturned east and began firing all the shacks in which Negroes and whites\r\nlived in that street.\r\n\r\nBurton, the first victim of the mob's violence, was lynched in the yard\r\nback of his shop. The mob tied a rope around his neck and dragged him\r\nthrough the streets. An effort was then made to burn the body, which\r\nhad been hung to a tree. This was at two o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a company of militia arrived from Decatur, Illinois, and\r\nproceeded through Madison Street to Twelfth Street, where the mob was\r\nengaged in mutilating Burton's body, riddling it with bullets. The mob\r\nwas twice ordered to disperse, and the militia fired in the air twice.\r\nThe third time the troops fired into the ankles and legs of the mob. At\r\nleast two of the men in the mob were wounded and the mob quickly gave way.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Negroes were badly frightened and began leaving town.\r\nMeanwhile, Governor Deneen had sent for more troops, including two\r\nregiments from Chicago. Before the rioting ended 5,000 militiamen were\r\npatrolling the streets of Springfield. On Saturday morning the militia\r\nbegan to arrive in force, including detachments from Chicago. This was a\r\ncomparatively quiet day, but that night another Negro was lynched within\r\na block of the State House. The mob gathered on the Court House Square\r\nand marched south on Fifth Street to Monroe, west on Monroe to Spring,\r\nand south on Spring to Edwards. At the southeast corner of Spring and\r\nEdwards streets a Negro named Donegan and his family had lived for many\r\nyears. Donegan was eighty-four years old and owned the half-block of\r\nground where he lived. He was found sleeping in his own yard and was\r\nquickly strung up to a tree across the street. Then his throat was cut\r\nand his body mutilated. The troops interfered at this point and cut down\r\nthe man, taking him in an ambulance to the hospital, where he died the\r\nfollowing morning. Donegan's only offense seems to have been that he had\r\nhad a white wife for more than thirty years. He bore a good reputation,\r\nand the mob had found no reason for lynching him.\r\n\r\nAbe Raymer, who was supposed to have been the leader of the mob, was\r\ncharged with the murder of Donegan, but was released.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the disorder which occurred Friday evening, it is\r\nnarrated that Eugene W. Chafin, Prohibition candidate for the presidency,\r\nwas delivering an address on the east side of the public square. A\r\nNegro pursued by the mob ran toward the speaker's stand from Fifth and\r\nWashington streets, where he had been pulled from a street car. Two\r\nmen helped him to the speaker's stand, while Chafin at the front of the\r\nplatform threatened to shoot into the crowd. Although he had no revolver\r\nhe made a motion toward his hip pocket. During the mêlée before gaining\r\nthe platform the Negro drew a knife from his pocket and slashed several\r\nwhite men. When he had escaped from the rear of the platform, missiles\r\nflew in the direction of Mr. Chafin, one of them hitting him on the head.\r\n\r\nFour men were rounded up who had been blacked up to resemble Negroes and\r\nhad been firing on soldiers during the night in an effort to substantiate\r\nthe assertion that the Negroes did not welcome the soldiers.\r\n\r\nSunday was quiet. No effort was made to reorganize the mob. The whole\r\ncity was as if under martial law. The saloons were shut and every place\r\nof business was closed at 9:00 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe people who took part in the mob violence had no grievances against\r\nthe Negroes. They were hoodlums and underworld folk. Many of the hoodlums,\r\naccording to one observer, were less than twenty years old.\r\n\r\nDuring the rioting four white men were killed. They were: Louis Johnson,\r\nof 1208 East Reynolds Street, whose body was found at the foot of the\r\nstairs leading to the barroom in Loper's restaurant. He was shot through\r\nthe abdomen; John Colwell, of 1517 Matheny Street, who died at St. John's\r\nHospital; J. W. Scott, of 125 East Adams Street, who was shot in the\r\nlungs; Frank Delmore, who was killed by a stray bullet.\r\n\r\nSeventy-nine persons were injured. The property destroyed included Loper's\r\nrestaurant and automobile, Scott Burton's barber shop, the Delmonico\r\nsaloon, and one block of houses between Tenth and Eleventh streets,\r\nwhich were burned, with all their contents. Scores of families were\r\nleft destitute. Many Negroes were severely beaten before they were able\r\nto escape from the district. Numbers of these homeless colored people\r\nswarmed to neighboring towns and to Chicago. Three thousand of them were\r\nconcentrated at Camp Lincoln, the National Guard camp grounds. Some of\r\nthe refugees were cared for at the arsenal.\r\n\r\nCurrent comment concerning the riots suggested political corruption and\r\nlaxity of law enforcement as important underlying causes of the riots. An\r\nassistant state's attorney in Springfield charged that saloons had long\r\nbeen violating the law, and that the law was not generally enforced as\r\nit ought to be. He cited these conditions as responsible in large measure\r\nfor the rioting and murders. Pastors in their sermons on the riot focused\r\nattention on the way in which vicious elements were permitted to flout\r\nthe law with impunity. This comment came so generally and insistently\r\nfrom those conversant with the situation that the _Chicago Daily News_\r\nwas led to remark editorially upon the responsibility of the public\r\nauthorities of Springfield. It said:\r\n\r\n     Vice and other forms of law breaking have been given wide\r\n     latitude here. The notoriety of Springfield's evil resorts\r\n     has been widespread.\r\n\r\n     A mob which murders, burns and loots, is a highly undesirable\r\n     substitute even for a complacent city administration. It is\r\n     a logical result, however, of long temporizing with vice and\r\n     harboring of the vicious. When a mob begins to shoot and hang,\r\n     to destroy and pillage, there is instant recognition on the\r\n     part of responsible persons of the beauty of law enforcement\r\n     and of general orderliness.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the riots some Springfield saloon-keepers took\r\nadvantage of the fact that large crowds of sight-seers had come to\r\ntown to open their places, in violation of the order by Mayor Reece to\r\nremain closed. Some of them were arrested for defiance of the mayor's\r\nproclamation to remain closed until order had been restored.\r\n\r\nBy Monday or Tuesday order was pretty well restored in Springfield. Some\r\nof the National Guard troops were kept on duty for several days. Almost\r\n100 arrests were made, and a special grand jury returned more than fifty\r\nindictments.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EAST ST. LOUIS RIOTS\r\n\r\nMay 28 and July 2, 1917\r\n\r\nFollowing a period of bitter racial feeling, frequently marked by open\r\nfriction, a clash between whites and Negroes in East St. Louis, Illinois,\r\noccurred on May 28, 1917, in which, following rumors that a white man\r\nhad been killed by Negroes, a number of Negroes were beaten by a mob\r\nof white men. This outbreak was the forerunner of a much more serious\r\nriot on July 2, in which at least thirty-nine Negroes and eight white\r\npeople were killed, much property was destroyed by fire, and the local\r\nauthorities proved so ineffective and demoralized that the state militia\r\nwas required to restore order. A Congressional Committee investigated\r\nthe facts of the riot and the underlying conditions, which included\r\nindustrial disturbances and shameful corruption in local government.[13]\r\n\r\nThe coroner of St. Clair County in which East St. Louis is situated, held\r\nthirty-eight inquests, as a result of which it was found that twenty-six\r\nof these deaths had been due to gun-shot wounds, four to drowning, four\r\nto burns, two to fractured skulls, one to hemorrhage of the brain, and\r\none to pneumonia after a fracture of the thyroid cartilage. Hundreds\r\nof persons were estimated to have been more or less seriously injured,\r\nseventy having been treated in St. Mary's Hospital. It has been impossible\r\nto get an accurate accounting of the deaths and injuries. One man who\r\nhad taken a deep interest in the situation estimated that from 200 to\r\n300 Negroes were killed.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 people were arrested. Some of these were released, some were\r\ncharged with rioting and conspiracy, and others with arson. Two white\r\nwomen were tried for conspiracy and rioting, and fined $50.00. Ten Negroes\r\nwere convicted of rioting and murder. Indictments of 104 white persons\r\ngrew out of the immediate activities of the rioters. Three policemen\r\nwere among those indicted for murder in connection with firing upon\r\nNegro bystanders. In this same group of assailants were seven soldiers\r\nwho were court-martialed. No finding in their cases has been announced.\r\nThree white men were indicted for murder in connection with a raid upon\r\na street-car load of Negro passengers in which a father and son were\r\nkilled, a mother was wounded severely, and a little daughter escaped.\r\nTwenty-six men, two of them Negroes, were indicted for arson.\r\n\r\nThe effort to bring the guilty to justice was commented upon and\r\nsummarized by this Congressional Committee as follows:\r\n\r\n     Assistant Attorney General Middlekauf had active charge of the\r\n     prosecutions growing out of the riot, and he showed neither\r\n     fear nor favor. Capable, determined, and courageous, he allowed\r\n     neither political influence nor personal appeals to swerve\r\n     him from the strict line of duty.\r\n\r\n     As a result of these prosecutions by the attorney general's\r\n     office 11 Negroes and 8 white men are in the State penitentiary,\r\n     2 additional white men have been sentenced to prison terms,\r\n     14 white men have been given jail sentences, 27 white men,\r\n     including the former night chief of police and three policemen,\r\n     have pleaded guilty to rioting and have been punished.\r\n\r\n     These convictions were obtained in the face of organized,\r\n     determined effort, backed with abundant funds, to head off the\r\n     prosecutions and convictions. In the case of Mayor Mollman\r\n     there seems to have been an open, paid advertising campaign\r\n     to slander and intimidate the attorney general.\r\n\r\nThe burned area of the city was on Fifth Street, Broadway, Walnut\r\nStreet, Eighth Street, Eleventh Street and Bond Avenue, as well as \"the\r\nFlats\" on Seventh Street, between Division and Missouri avenues. This\r\nlatter area was that occupied by Negroes. There were 312 buildings and\r\nforty-four railroad cars totally or partially destroyed, with a total\r\nloss of $393,600.\r\n\r\nThe riots in East St. Louis may be traced, more or less directly, to a\r\nnumber of causes, the influence of each being apparent.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt conditions resulting from the migration of a large number\r\nof Negroes from the South, a movement which was more or less general at\r\nthat time, account in large measure for the riots, but also involved in\r\nit all are the facts that there had been industrial friction, and that\r\nthe city was flagrantly misgoverned.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee observed an effort to shift the blame from one\r\nelement to another. The labor interests sought to place responsibility for\r\nthe riots upon the employers, who, they said, had brought great numbers of\r\nNegroes to East St. Louis in order that they might more readily dominate\r\nthe employment situation. The employers, on the other hand, thought the\r\nblame rested upon the city and county administration because of laxity\r\nin law enforcement, exploitation of Negroes for political purposes, and\r\nall sorts of political corruption, including the \"protection\" of vice and\r\ncrime. The political ring sought to dodge responsibility by emphasizing\r\neconomic and industrial causes of the outbreak.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the conditions resulting from the influx of\r\nNegroes, they were undoubtedly actuated by a desire to improve their\r\ncondition. Some 10,000 or 12,000 Negroes had come to St. Clair County\r\nfrom the South during the winter of 1916-17. During the year and a\r\nhalf preceding the riot, the number of such migrants was estimated at\r\n18,000, although it was reported that many had returned during the winter\r\nof 1916-17, because of the unaccustomed cold climate. It is certain\r\nthat this influx severely taxed the housing accommodations of East St.\r\nLouis, which were of the insanitary and inadequate nature that so often\r\ncharacterizes urban districts in which the Negroes find that they must\r\nlive. The report of the Congressional Committee on this point says:\r\n\r\n     It is a lamentable fact that the employers of labor paid too\r\n     little heed to the comfort or welfare of their men. They saw\r\n     them crowded into wretched cabins without water or any of the\r\n     conveniences of life, their wives and children condemned to\r\n     live in the disreputable quarters of the town, and made no\r\n     effort to lift them out of the mire. The Negroes gravitated\r\n     to the insanitary sections, existed in the squalor of filthy\r\n     cabins and made no complaint, but the white workmen had a\r\n     higher outlook, and failure to provide them with better homes\r\n     added to their bitter dissatisfaction with the burdens placed\r\n     upon them by having to compete with black labor.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise in evidence that special inducements were offered to the\r\nsouthern Negroes to come to East St. Louis, as well as to other industrial\r\ncenters in the North. Advertisements were placed in southern newspapers,\r\noffering employment at wages far in excess of those paid in the South. Low\r\nrailroad rates were offered, and in some instances during this general\r\nmigration the railroads are said to have transported Negroes free in\r\norder that they might be employed by the railroads. Failures of crops\r\nin the South, floods and ill treatment of Negroes there, coupled with\r\nthe hope that they would find fairer treatment in the North, as well as\r\nbetter wages and living conditions, were the direct causes of migration.\r\nAfter this had become fairly general it was further stimulated by Negroes\r\nwho had come North, and who wrote home painting northern conditions in\r\nglowing colors.\r\n\r\nFrom the industrial point of view it should be noted that in the summer\r\nof 1916 there had been a strike of 4,000 white men in the packing-plants\r\nof East St. Louis. It was asserted that Negroes were used in these plants\r\nas strike breakers. A report on the Negro migration by the United States\r\nDepartment of Labor states that when the strike was ended Negroes were\r\nstill employed, and some of the white men lost their positions. It says\r\nfurther: \"The white leaders undoubtedly realized that the effectiveness\r\nof striking was materially lessened by this importation of black workers.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is stated in the report of the Congressional Committee\r\nthat the Aluminum Ore Company, during a strike, brought hundreds of\r\nNegroes to the city as strike breakers in order to defeat organized\r\nlabor, \"a precedent which aroused intense hatred and antagonism, and\r\ncaused countless tragedies as its aftermath. The feeling of resentment\r\ngrew with each succeeding day. White men walked the streets in idleness\r\nand their families suffered for food and warmth and clothes, while their\r\nplaces as laborers were taken by strange Negroes who were compelled to\r\nlive in hovels and who were used to keep down wages.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1917, a strike followed demands which had been made upon\r\nthe Aluminum Ore Company by the \"Aluminum Ore Employees' Protective\r\nAssociation.\" These related to alleged injustices and discriminations\r\nsaid to have been practiced against the employees. The company failed\r\nto comply with these demands, and a thousand white workers struck.\r\n\r\nClosely related to this situation was a notice sent to the delegates of\r\nthe Central Trades Labor Union by the secretary of the Union, dated May\r\n23, which declared that the immigration of the southern Negro had reached\r\na point where \"drastic action must be taken if we intend to work and to\r\nlive peaceably in this community.\" This notice declared that these men\r\nwere being used \"to the detriment of our white citizens by some of the\r\ncapitalists and a few real estate owners.\" It called a meeting to present\r\nto the mayor and city council a demand for action to \"retard this growing\r\nmenace, and also devise a way to get rid of a certain portion of those\r\nwho are already here.\" The notice read further: \"This is not a protest\r\nagainst the Negro who has long been a resident of East St. Louis, and\r\nis a law abiding citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThis meeting was held on May 28 in the auditorium of the city hall and\r\nwas attended not only by the labor men but also by a large number of\r\nother persons. The Congressional Committee refers to one of the speakers\r\nat this meeting as \"an attorney of some ability and no character.\" The\r\nreport of the Committee says that he virtually advised the killing of\r\nNegroes and burning of their homes. The report says further:\r\n\r\n     He was not authorized to speak for those who went there to\r\n     protest against the lawlessness which disgraced the city and\r\n     the presence of thousands of Negroes who it is claimed were\r\n     taking the places of the white workmen, but his inflammatory\r\n     speech caused many of his hearers to rush into the street and\r\n     to resort to acts of violence.... He was in full sympathy with\r\n     the action of the mob. They followed his advice and the scenes\r\n     of murder and arson that ensued were the logical result of\r\n     his utterances.\r\n\r\nThat night, May 28, following the meeting, a crowd of white people\r\nassembled in front of the police station and clamored for Negro prisoners.\r\nA rumor circulated through the crowd that a white man had just been killed\r\nby Negroes, and parts of the crowd left, forming a mob which severely beat\r\na number of Negroes whom it met. The situation was so serious that the\r\nmayor called for troops. The trouble subsided, however. It is important\r\nto note that from this time until the riot of July 1-2, no effort was\r\nmade to strengthen the police force nor were any other steps taken to\r\ncontrol the situation.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the industrial phase of the situation, it should be\r\nremembered that the war had cut off the normal supply of foreign labor,\r\nand that not a few white workers had left East St. Louis for other\r\nindustrial centers. Most of the Negro migrants were unskilled workers,\r\nand their competition was, therefore, with the unskilled white workers.\r\nOne witness before the Congressional Committee expressed the view that\r\nthe labor shortage in East St. Louis prior to the riot certainly did\r\nnot justify the great influx of Negroes, but it is of record that most\r\nof the newcomers got profitable employment in unskilled occupations.\r\n\r\nThe employers were fighting unions of any sort, whether of whites or\r\nNegroes. Unions were seeking membership of Negroes as well as whites in\r\nthe hope that the use of Negroes as strike breakers might be prevented.\r\nWhether union men or not, the white workers resented the influx of\r\nNegro workers who might take their jobs. The inevitable consequence was\r\nfriction between whites and Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee laid great stress upon corrupt politics\r\nas the leading cause of the riots of July 2. It disclosed an almost\r\nunbelievable combination of shameless corruption, tolerance of vice and\r\ncrime, maladministration, and debauchery of the courts. The report says\r\nthat East St. Louis for many years was a plague spot, harboring within\r\nits borders \"every offense in the calendar of crime\" and committing\r\nopenly \"every lapse in morals and public decency.\" Politicians looted its\r\ntreasury, gave away valuable franchises, and elected plunderers to high\r\noffice. Graft, collusion with crime and vice, and desecration of office\r\nwere openly and deliberately practiced. Criminals were attracted and\r\nwelcomed, and the good people of the community were powerless. Owners of\r\nlarge corporations and manufacturers pitted white against black labor,\r\ngiving no thought to their thousands of workmen living in hovels, the\r\nvictims of \"poverty and disease, of long hours and incessant labor.\"\r\n\r\nThe mayor, continues the report, was a tool of dishonest politicians,\r\nthe electorate was \"debauched,\" the police were a conscienceless bunch\r\nof grafters, and the revenue of the city was largely derived from saloons\r\nand dens of vice.\r\n\r\nSeveral officials and politicians of high standing were singled out by\r\nthe Committee for especial condemnation as the \"brains of the city's\r\ncorruption.\"\r\n\r\nA great deal of the city's crime and vice was concentrated in what is\r\nknown as \"Black Valley.\" This was the section in which the Negroes\r\nlived, but much of the vice and crime was promoted and practiced by\r\nvicious whites. There was much mixing of whites and Negroes in the vilest\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions existed in the town of Brooklyn near by, with about\r\n3,000 people, of whom only about fifty were white. Its dens of iniquity\r\nwere notorious and were the resort of many white people. So openly\r\noperated were these resorts that the Congressional Committee reported\r\nthat in the Brooklyn high school \"24 out of 25 girls who were in the\r\ngraduating class went to the bad in the saloons and dance halls and\r\nfailed to receive their diplomas.\"\r\n\r\nNot only were conditions of this sort demoralizing and degrading for\r\nthe decent Negroes, but the sanitary conditions were likewise extremely\r\nbad. Some of the houses in the Negro districts had not been painted\r\nfor fifteen years and were in a state of great disrepair. Their setting\r\nconsisted largely of pools of stagnant water and beds of weeds. At one\r\nperiod during the migration Negroes were coming in so fast that even\r\nthese miserable housing conditions were inadequate, and some of them\r\nwere forced to live in sheds. In one instance sixty-nine newcomers were\r\nfound living in one small house. Whenever houses were vacated by white\r\npeople and rented to Negroes, the rental price was largely increased,\r\nsometimes doubled.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the corruption in East St. Louis, the report of the\r\nCongressional Committee discussed the riot. It described the condition of\r\naffairs on the night of July 1, 1917, when the second and most serious\r\noutbreak occurred. An automobile (some witnesses said two) went through\r\nthe Negro section of the city, its occupants firing promiscuously into\r\nhomes. This aroused fierce resentment among the Negroes, who organized\r\nfor defense and armed themselves with guns. The ringing of the church\r\nbell, a prearranged signal for assembling, drew a crowd of them, and\r\nthey marched through the streets ready to avenge the attack. A second\r\nautomobile filled with white men crossed their path. The Negroes cursed\r\nthem, commanded them to drive on, and fired a volley into the machine.\r\nThe occupants, however, were not the rioters but policemen and reporters.\r\nOne policeman was killed and another was so seriously wounded that he\r\ndied later.\r\n\r\nThousands viewed the riddled car standing before police headquarters. The\r\nearly editions of the newspapers gave full accounts of the tragedy, and\r\non July 2 the rioting began. Negro mobs shot white men, and white men\r\nand boys, girls and women, began to attack every Negro in sight. News\r\nspread rapidly and, as excitement increased, unimaginable depredations\r\nand horrible tortures were committed and viewed with \"placid unconcern\"\r\nby hundreds. Negro men were stabbed, clubbed, and hanged from telephone\r\npoles. Their homes were burned. Women and children were not spared.\r\nAn instance is given of a Negro child two years old which was shot and\r\nthrown into a doorway of a burning building.\r\n\r\nOn the night of July 1, Mayor Mollman telephoned to the Adjutant General\r\nof Illinois saying that the police were no longer able to handle the\r\nsituation and requesting that the militia be sent. Both the police and\r\nthe militia are severely censured by the Congressional report for gross\r\nfailure to do their duty. The police, says the report, could have quelled\r\nthe riot instantly, but instead they either \"fled into the safety of\r\ncowardly seclusion or listlessly watched the depredations of the mob,\r\npassively and in many instances actively sharing in the work.\"\r\n\r\nIn all, five companies of the Illinois National Guard were sent to East\r\nSt. Louis. Some of them arrived on the morning of July 2, the first at\r\n8:40 A.M. These forces were in command of Colonel S. O. Tripp. Concerning\r\nthe conduct of the militia, the Congressional Committee reported in\r\nstrong terms, singling out Colonel Tripp for especial condemnation. It\r\nsaid that he was a hindrance instead of a help to the troops; that \"he\r\nwas ignorant of his duties, blind to his responsibilities and deaf to\r\nevery intelligent appeal that was made to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe troops, in the estimation of the Committee, were poorly officered and\r\nin only a few cases did their duty. The report states that \"they seemed\r\nmoved by the same spirit of indifference or cowardice that marked the\r\nconduct of the police force. As a rule they fraternized with the mob,\r\njoked with them and made no serious effort to restrain them.\"\r\n\r\nMany instances are given of active participation and encouragement of\r\nthe mob in its murders, arson, and general destruction.\r\n\r\nThe only redeeming feature of the activities of the militia, according\r\nto the Congressional Committee, was \"the conduct, bravery, and skill\r\nof the officer second in command, whose promptness and determination\r\nprevented the mob from committing many more atrocities.\"\r\n\r\nBy eight o'clock of the evening of July 2 there were seventeen officers\r\nand 270 men on duty, and by July 4 the force had increased to thirty-seven\r\nofficers and 1,411 men. On the evening of July 2 the fury of the mob\r\nhad spent itself, and the riot subsided.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the troops was condemned not only by the Congressional\r\nCommittee but by citizens generally, and a special inquiry was made\r\ninto their conduct by the Military and Naval Department of the State of\r\nIllinois. Witnesses to dereliction on duty on the part of the soldiers\r\nwere examined and commanding officers of troops were asked to testify and\r\nexplain specific acts of violence and neglect of duty. In all seventy-nine\r\npersons were examined. Although the charges against the soldiers in\r\na large number of cases were serious and sufficient to warrant the\r\ncriticism which they received, identification of individuals guilty of\r\nthese acts was difficult. This probably accounts for the fact that only\r\nseven court-martials resulted from the inquiry. The commanding officer,\r\nthough severely censured by the Congressional Committee, was exonerated\r\nby this inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MIGRATION OF NEGROES FROM THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nDuring the period 1916-18 approximately a half-million Negroes suddenly\r\nmoved from southern to northern states. This movement, however, was not\r\nwithout a precedent. A similar migration occurred in 1879, when Negroes\r\nmoved from Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee, and North\r\nCarolina to Kansas. The origin of this earlier movement, its causes, and\r\nmanner resemble in many respects the one which has so recently attracted\r\npublic attention.\r\n\r\nThe migration of 1916-18 cannot be separated completely from the steady,\r\nthough inconspicuous, exodus from southern to northern states that has\r\nbeen in progress since 1860, or, in fact, since the operation of the\r\n\"underground railway.\" In 1900 there were 911,025 Negroes living in\r\nthe North, 10.3 per cent of the total Negro population, which was then\r\n8,883,994. Census figures for the period 1900-1910 show a net loss for\r\nsouthern states east of the Mississippi of 595,703 Negroes. Of this number\r\n366,880 are found in northern states. Reliable estimates for the last\r\ndecade place the increase of northern Negro population around 500,000.\r\n\r\nThe 1910-20 increase of the Negro population of Chicago was from 44,103\r\nto 109,594, or 148.5 per cent, with a corresponding increase in the white\r\npopulation of 21 per cent, including foreign immigration. According to\r\nthe Census Bureau method of estimating natural increase of population,\r\nthe Negro population of Chicago unaffected by the migration would be\r\n58,056 in 1920, and the increase by migration alone would be 51,538.\r\n\r\nThe relative 1910-20 increases in white and Negro population in typical\r\nindustrial cities of the Middle West, given in Table II, illustrate the\r\neffect of the migration of southern Negroes.\r\n\r\n_The migration to Chicago._--Within a period of eighteen months in 1917-18\r\nmore than 50,000 Negroes came to Chicago according to an estimate based\r\non averages taken from actual count of daily arrivals. All of those\r\nwho came, however, did not stay. Chicago was a re-routing point, and\r\nmany immigrants went on to nearby cities and towns. During the heaviest\r\nperiod, for example, a Detroit social agency reported that hundreds of\r\nNegroes applying there for work stated that they were from Chicago. The\r\ntendency appears to have been to reach those fields offering the highest\r\npresent wages and permanent prospects.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE II\r\n\r\n     ===============================================================\r\n                       |     Negroes      | Percentage | Percentage\r\n                       |                  |  of Negro  |  of White\r\n                       +--------+---------+  Increase, |  Increase,\r\n                       |  1910  |   1920  |   1910-20  |   1910-20\r\n     ------------------+--------+---------+------------+------------\r\n     Cincinnati, Ohio  | 19,639 |  29,636 |      50.9  |      8.0\r\n     Dayton, Ohio      |  4,842 |   9,029 |      86.5  |     28.0\r\n     Toledo, Ohio      |  1,877 |   5,690 |     203.1  |     42.5\r\n     Fort Wayne, Ind.  |    572 |   1,476 |     158.0  |     34.3\r\n     Canton, Ohio      |    291 |   1,349 |     363.6  |     71.7\r\n     Gary, Ind.        |    383 |   5,299 |   1,283.6  |    205.1\r\n     Detroit, Mich.    |  5,741 |  41,532 |     623.4  |    106.9\r\n     Chicago, Ill.     | 44,103 | 109,594 |     148.5  |     21.0\r\n     ------------------+--------+---------+------------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CAUSES OF THE MIGRATION\r\n\r\nA series of circumstances acting together in an unusual combination both\r\nprovoked and made possible the migration of Negroes from the South on\r\na large scale. The causes of the movement fall into definite divisions,\r\neven as stated by the migrants themselves. For example, one of the most\r\nfrequent causes mentioned by southern Negroes for their change of home\r\nis the treatment accorded them in the South. Yet this treatment of\r\nwhich they complain has been practiced since their emancipation, and\r\nfifty years afterward more than nine-tenths of the Negro population\r\nof the United States still remained in the South. \"Higher wages\" was\r\nalso commonly stated as a cause of the movement, yet thousands came\r\nto the North and to Chicago who in the South had been earning more in\r\ntheir professions and even in skilled occupations than they expected to\r\nreceive in the North. These causes then divide into two main classes:\r\n(1) economic causes, (2) sentimental causes. Each has a bearing on both\r\nNorth and South. The following statements are based on reports prepared\r\nby trustworthy agencies during the migration, on letters and statements\r\nfrom migrants, Negroes and whites living in the South and the North,\r\nand on family history obtained by the Commission's investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ECONOMIC CAUSES OF THE MIGRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n_Low wages._--Wages of Negroes in the South varied from 75 cents a day\r\non the farms to $1.75 a day in certain city jobs, in the period just\r\npreceding 1914. The rise in living costs which followed the outbreak of\r\nthe war outstripped the rise in wages. In Alabama the price paid for day\r\nlabor in the twenty-one \"black belt\" counties averaged 50 and 60 cents\r\na day. It ranged from 40 cents, as a minimum, to 75 cents, and, in a\r\nfew instances, $1.00 was a maximum for able-bodied male farm hands.[14]\r\n\r\nA Negro minister, writing in the _Montgomery_ (Alabama) _Advertiser_, said:\r\n\r\n     The Negro farm hand gets for his compensation hardly more than\r\n     the mule he plows; that is, his board and shelter. Some mules\r\n     fare better than Negroes. This, too, in spite of the fact that\r\n     the money received for farm products has advanced more than\r\n     100 per cent. The laborer has not shared correspondingly in\r\n     this advance.\r\n\r\n     High rents and low wages have driven the Negro off the farms.\r\n     They have no encouragement to work. Only here and there you\r\n     will find a tenant who is getting a square deal and the proper\r\n     encouragement.\r\n\r\nA white man, writing in the same paper, said:\r\n\r\n     There is an article in today's _Advertiser_ headed \"Exodus\r\n     of the Negroes to Be Probed.\" Why hunt for a cause when it's\r\n     plain as the noonday sun the Negro is leaving this country for\r\n     higher wages? He doesn't want to leave here but he knows if\r\n     he stays here he will starve. They have made no crops, they\r\n     have nothing to eat, no clothes, no shoes, and they can't\r\n     get any work to do, and they are leaving just as fast as they\r\n     can get away.... If the Negro race could get work at 50 cents\r\n     per day he would stay here. He don't want to go. He is easily\r\n     satisfied and will live on half rations and will never complain.\r\n\r\nThe _Atlanta Independent_, white, said:\r\n\r\n     If our white neighbors will treat the Negro kindly, recognizing\r\n     his rights as a man, advance his wages in proportion as the cost\r\n     of living advances, he will need no ordinance nor legislation\r\n     to keep the Negro here. The South is his natural home. He\r\n     prefers to be here, he loves its traditions, its ideals and\r\n     its people. But he cannot stay here and starve....\r\n\r\n     When meat was 15 cents a pound and flour $8 a barrel, the Negro\r\n     received from $4 to $8 a week. Now meat is 30 cents a pound\r\n     and flour $16 a barrel, and the Negro is receiving the same\r\n     wages. He cannot live on this and the white man cannot expect\r\n     him to live in the South and live on the starvation wages he\r\n     is paying him, when the fields and the factories in the North\r\n     are offering him living wages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TYPICAL PLANTATION HOMES IN THE SOUTH OF MIGRANTS TO\r\n   CHICAGO]\r\n\r\n_The boll weevil._--In 1915 and 1916 the boll weevil cotton pest so\r\nravaged sections of the South that thousands of farmers were almost\r\nruined. Cotton crops were lost, and the farmers were forced to change\r\nfrom cotton to food products. The growing of cotton requires about\r\nthirty times as many \"hands\" as food products. As a result many Negroes\r\nwere thrown out of employment. The damage wrought by the boll weevil\r\nwas augmented by destructive storms and floods, which not only affected\r\ncrops but made the living conditions of Negroes more miserable.\r\n\r\n_Lack of capital._--The \"credit system\" is a very convenient and common\r\npractice in many parts of the South. Money is borrowed for upkeep until\r\nthe selling season, when it is repaid in one lump sum. The succession\r\nof short crops and the destruction due to the boll weevil and storms\r\noccasioned heavy demands for capital to carry labor through the fall and\r\nearly winter until a new crop could be started. There was a shortage of\r\ncapital, and as a result there was little opportunity for work. During\r\nthis period many white persons migrated from sections of the South most\r\nseriously affected.\r\n\r\n_\"Unsatisfactory\" living conditions._--The plantation cabins and\r\nsegregated sections in cities where municipal laxity made home\r\nsurroundings undesirable have been stated as another contributing cause\r\nof the movement.\r\n\r\n_Lack of school facilities._--The desire to place their children in good\r\nschools was a reason often given by migrants with families for leaving\r\nthe South. School facilities are described as lamentably poor even by\r\nsouthern whites. Perhaps the most thorough statement of these conditions\r\nis given in a _Study of Negro Education_ by Thomas Jesse Jones, made\r\nunder the direction of the federal Bureau of Education, and comparing\r\nprovisions for white and Negro children in fifteen southern states and\r\nthe District of Columbia. He states:\r\n\r\n     In the South they [Negroes] form 29.8 per cent of the total\r\n     population, the proportion in Mississippi and South Carolina\r\n     being over 55 per cent and ranging in the \"black belt\" counties\r\n     from 50 to 90 per cent of the total population. Almost 3,000,000\r\n     are engaged in agricultural pursuits. They form 40.4 per cent\r\n     of all persons engaged in these pursuits in the Southern States.\r\n\r\n     Though the United States census shows a decrease in illiteracy,\r\n     there are still about 2,225,000 Negroes illiterate in the\r\n     South, or over 33 per cent of the Negro population ten years\r\n     of age and over.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE III\r\n\r\n     ======================================================================\r\n                                                  |    White   |  Colored\r\n     ---------------------------------------------+------------+-----------\r\n     Total population                             | 23,682,352 | 8,906,879\r\n     Population six to fourteen years of age      |  4,889,762 | 2,023,108\r\n     Population six to fourteen[15]               |  3,552,431 | 1,852,181\r\n     Teachers' salaries in public schools         |$36,649,827 |$5,860,876\r\n     Teachers' salaries per child six to fourteen |   $10.32   |  $2.89\r\n     Per cent of illiteracy                       |     7.7    |  33.3\r\n     Per cent rural                               |    76.9    |  78.8\r\n     ---------------------------------------------+------------+-----------\r\n\r\nIn the fifteen states and the District of Columbia for which salaries by\r\nrace could be obtained, the public school teachers received $42,510,431\r\nin salaries.

The Negro schoolhouses are miserable beyond\r\n     all description. They are usually without comfort, equipment,\r\n     proper lighting, or sanitation. Nearly all of the Negroes of\r\n     school age in the district are crowded into these miserable\r\n     structures during the short term which the school runs. Most\r\n     of the teachers are absolutely untrained and have been given\r\n     certificates by the county board, not because they have passed\r\n     the examination, but because it is necessary to have some kind\r\n     of a Negro teacher. Among the Negro rural schools which I have\r\n     visited, I have found only one in which the highest class knew\r\n     the multiplication table.\"\r\n\r\nA state superintendent writes:\r\n\r\n     \"There has never been any serious attempt in this state to\r\n     offer adequate educational facilities for the colored race. The\r\n     average length of the term for the state is only four months;\r\n     practically all of the schools are taught in dilapidated\r\n     churches, which, of course, are not equipped with suitable\r\n     desks, blackboards, and the other essentials of a school;\r\n     practically all of the teachers are incompetent, possessing\r\n     little or no education and having had no professional training\r\n     whatever, except a few weeks obtained in the summer schools;\r\n     the schools are generally overcrowded, some of them having as\r\n     many as 100 students to the teacher; no attempt is made to do\r\n     more than teach the children to read, write, and figure, and\r\n     these subjects are learned very imperfectly. There are six or\r\n     eight industrial supervisors financed in whole or in part by\r\n     the Jeanes Fund; most of these teachers are stimulating the\r\n     Negro schools to do very good work upon the practical things\r\n     of life. A few wide-awake Negro teachers not connected with\r\n     the Jeanes Fund are doing the same thing. It can probably be\r\n     truthfully said that the Negro schools are gradually improving,\r\n     but they are still just about as poor and inadequate as they\r\n     can be.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on the cause of the migration, the _Atlanta Constitution_,\r\na prominent southern white paper, says:\r\n\r\n     While mob violence and the falsehood which has been built\r\n     upon that foundation constitutes, perhaps, a strong factor\r\n     in the migration of the Negroes, there is scarcely a doubt\r\n     that the educational feature enters into it. Negroes induced\r\n     to go to the North undoubtedly believe they can secure better\r\n     educational facilities there for their children, whether they\r\n     really succeed in getting them or not.\r\n\r\n     Georgia, as well as other southern states, is undoubtedly\r\n     behind in the matter of Negro education, unfair in the matter\r\n     of facilities, in the quality of teachers and instructors, and\r\n     in the pay of those expected to impart proper instruction to\r\n     Negro children.\r\n\r\n     We have proceeded upon the theory that education would, in his\r\n     own mind, at least, carry the Negro beyond his sphere; that\r\n     it would give him higher ideas of himself and make of him a\r\n     poorer and less satisfactory workman. That is nonsense....\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE NORTH\r\n\r\n_The cessation of immigration._--Prior to the war the yearly immigration\r\nto the United States equaled approximately the total Negro population of\r\nthe North. Foreign labor filled the unskilled labor field, and Negroes\r\nwere held closely in domestic and personal-service work. The cessation of\r\nimmigration and the return of thousands of aliens to their mother-country,\r\ntogether with the opening of new industries and the extension of old\r\nones, created a much greater demand for American labor. Employers looked\r\nto the South for Negroes and advertised for them.\r\n\r\n_High wages._--Wages for unskilled work in the North in 1916 and 1917\r\nranged from $3.00 to $8.00 a day. There were shorter hours of work and\r\nopportunity for overtime and bonuses.\r\n\r\n_Living conditions._--Houses available for Negroes in the North, though\r\nby northern standards classed as unsanitary and unfit for habitation,\r\nafforded greater comforts than the rude cabins of the plantation. For\r\nthose who had owned homes in the South there was the opportunity of\r\nselling them and applying the money to payment for a good home in the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n_Identical school privileges._--Co-education of whites and Negroes in\r\nnorthern schools made possible a higher grade of instruction for the\r\nchildren of migrants.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SENTIMENTAL CAUSES OF THE MIGRATION\r\n\r\nThe causes classed as sentimental include those which have reference to\r\nthe feelings of Negroes concerning their surroundings in the South and\r\ntheir reactions to the social systems and practices of certain sections\r\nof the South. Frequently these causes were given as the source of an\r\nold discontent among Negroes concerning the South. Frequently they took\r\nprominence over economic causes, and they were held for the most part\r\nby a fairly high class of Negroes. These causes are in part as follows:\r\n\r\n_Lack of protection from mob violence._--Between 1885 and 1918, 2,881\r\nNegroes were lynched in the United States, more than 85 per cent of these\r\nlynchings occurring in the South. In 1917, 2,500 Negroes were driven by\r\nforce out of Dawson and Forsythe counties, Georgia.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Urban League reported that numbers of migrants from towns\r\nwhere lynchings had occurred registered for jobs in Chicago very shortly\r\nafter lynchings. Concerning mob violence and general insecurity both\r\nwhites and Negroes living in the South have had much to say. Their\r\nstatements at the time of the migration are here quoted.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Atlanta Constitution_ (white), November 24, 1916:\r\n\r\n     Current dispatches from Albany, Georgia, in the center of the\r\n     section apparently most affected, and where efforts are being\r\n     made to stop the exodus by spreading correct information among\r\n     the Negroes, say:\r\n\r\n     The heaviest migration of Negroes has been from those counties\r\n     in which there have been the worst outbreaks against Negroes.\r\n     It is developed by investigation that where there have been\r\n     lynchings, the Negroes have been most eager to believe what\r\n     the emigration agents have told them of plots for the removal\r\n     or extermination of the race. Comparatively few Negroes have\r\n     left Dougherty County, which is considered significant in\r\n     view of the fact that this is one of the counties in southwest\r\n     Georgia in which a lynching has never occurred.\r\n\r\n     These statements are most significant. Mob law as we have\r\n     known in Georgia has furnished emigration agents with all the\r\n     leverage they want; it is a foundation upon which it is easy\r\n     to build with a well concocted lie or two, and they have not\r\n     been slow to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\n     This loss of her best labor is another penalty Georgia is\r\n     paying for her indifference and inactivity in suppressing mob\r\n     law.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Southwestern Christian Advocate_ (Negro), April 26, 1917:\r\n\r\n     But why do they [the Negroes] go? We give a concrete answer:\r\n     some months ago Anthony Crawford, a highly respectable, honest\r\n     and industrious Negro, with a good farm and holdings estimated\r\n     to be worth $300,000, was lynched in Abbeville, South Carolina.\r\n     He was guilty of no crime. He would not be cheated out of his\r\n     cotton. That was insolence. He must be taught a lesson. When\r\n     the mob went for him he defended himself. They overpowered him\r\n     and brutally lynched him. This murder was without excuse and\r\n     was condemned in no uncertain words by the Governor, other\r\n     high officials and the press in general of South Carolina.\r\n     Officials pledged that the lynchers would be punished. The\r\n     case went to the grand jury. Mr. Crawford was lynched in the\r\n     daytime and dragged through the streets by unmasked men. The\r\n     names of the leaders were supposed to have been known, and\r\n     yet the grand jury, under oath, says that it could not find\r\n     sufficient evidence to warrant an indictment....\r\n\r\n     Is any one surprised that Negroes are leaving South Carolina\r\n     by the thousands? The wonder is that any of them remain.\r\n     They will suffer in the North. Some of them will die. But\r\n     Anthony Crawford did not get a chance to die in Abbeville,\r\n     South Carolina. He was shamefully murdered. Any place would\r\n     be paradise compared with some sections of the South where\r\n     the Negroes receive such maltreatment.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Savannah_ (Georgia) _Morning News_ (white), January 3, 1917:\r\n\r\n     Another cause is the feeling of insecurity. The lack of legal\r\n     protection in the country is a constant nightmare to the colored\r\n     people who are trying to accumulate a comfortable little home\r\n     and farm. There is scarcely a Negro mother in the country who\r\n     does not live in dread and fear that her husband or son may\r\n     come in unfriendly contact with some white person as to bring\r\n     the lynchers or the arresting officers to her door which may\r\n     result in the wiping out of her entire family. It must be\r\n     acknowledged that this is a sad condition....\r\n\r\n     The Southern white man ought to be willing to give the Negro\r\n     a man's chance without regard to his race or color, give him\r\n     at least the same protection of law given to anyone else. If\r\n     he will not do this, the Negro must seek those North or West,\r\n     who will give him better wages and better treatment. I hope,\r\n     however, that this will not be necessary.\r\n\r\n_Injustice in the courts._--An excerpt from one of the newspapers of\r\nthat period illustrates the basis of this cause:\r\n\r\n     While our very solvency is being sucked out from underneath\r\n     we go out about affairs as usual--our police officers raid\r\n     poolrooms for \"loafing Negroes,\" bring in twelve, keep them\r\n     in the barracks all night, and next morning find that many\r\n     of them have steady, regular jobs, valuable assets to their\r\n     white employers, suddenly left and gone to Cleveland, \"where\r\n     they don't arrest fifty niggers for what three of 'em done\"\r\n     [_Montgomery_ (Alabama) _Advertiser_ (white), September 21,\r\n     1916].\r\n\r\n_Inferior transportation facilities._--This refers to \"Jim Crow cars,\"\r\na partitioned section of one railway car, usually the baggage car, and\r\npartitioned sections of railway waiting-rooms, poorly kept, bearing\r\nsigns, \"For colored only.\" This dissatisfaction is expressed in part in\r\nthe following comment of a Negro presiding elder, writing in the _Macon_\r\n(Georgia) _Ledger_, a white paper:\r\n\r\n     The petty offenses, which you mention, are far more numerous\r\n     than you are aware of, besides other unjust treatments enacted\r\n     daily on the streets, street cars and trains. Our women are\r\n     inhumanly treated by some conductors, both on the street\r\n     cars and trains. White men are often found in compartments\r\n     for Negroes smoking, and if anything is said against it they\r\n     who speak are insulted, or the car is purposely filled with\r\n     big puffs of smoke and the conductor's reply is, \"He'll quit\r\n     to-rectly.\" Recently a white man entered a trailer for Negroes\r\n     with two little dogs. One of the dogs went between the seats\r\n     and crouched by a woman; she pushed him from her and the\r\n     white man took both dogs and set them aside her and she was\r\n     forced to ride with them. This is one of the many, many acts\r\n     of injustice which often result in a row for which the Negro\r\n     has to pay the penalty. These things are driving the Negro\r\n     from the South.\r\n\r\nOther causes stated are (_a_) the deprivation of the right to vote,\r\n(_b_) the \"rough-handed\" and unfair competition of \"poor whites,\" (_c_)\r\npersecution by petty officers of the law, and (_d_) the \"persecution of\r\nthe Press.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BEGINNING AND SPREAD OF MIGRATION\r\n\r\nThe enormous proportions to which the exodus grew obscure its beginning.\r\nSeveral experiments had been tried with southern labor in the Northeast,\r\nparticularly in the Connecticut tobacco fields and in Pennsylvania.\r\nIn Connecticut, Negro students from the southern schools had been\r\nemployed during summers with great success. Early in 1916, industries in\r\nPennsylvania imported many Negroes from Georgia and Florida. During July\r\none railroad company stated that it had brought to Pennsylvania more than\r\n13,000 Negroes. They wrote back for their friends and families, and from\r\nthe points to which they had been brought they spread out into new and\r\n\"labor slack\" territories. Once begun, this means of recruiting labor\r\nwas used by hard-pressed industries in other sections of the North. The\r\nreports of high wages, of the unexpected welcome of the North, and of\r\nunusually good treatment accorded Negroes spread throughout the South\r\nfrom Georgia and Florida to Texas.\r\n\r\nThe stimuli of suggestion and hysteria gave the migration an almost\r\nreligious significance, and it became a mass movement. Letters, rumors,\r\nNegro newspapers, gossip, and other forms of social control operated to\r\nadd volume and enthusiasm to the exodus. Songs and poems of the period\r\ncharacterized the migration as the \"Flight Out of Egypt,\" \"Bound for\r\nthe Promised Land,\" \"Going into Canaan,\" \"The Escape from Slavery,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe first movement was from Southeast to Northeast, following main lines\r\nof transportation. Soon, however, it became known that the Middle West\r\nwas similarly in need of men. Many industries advertised for southern\r\nNegroes in Negro papers. The federal Department of Labor for a period\r\nwas instrumental in transporting Negroes from the South to relieve the\r\nlabor shortage in other sections of the country, but discontinued such\r\nefforts when southern congressmen pointed out that the South's labor\r\nsupply was being depleted. It was brought out in the East St. Louis riot\r\ninquiry that plants there had advertised in Texas newspapers for Negro\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\nChicago was the logical destination of Negroes from Mississippi, Arkansas,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, and Texas, because of the more direct railway lines,\r\nthe way in which the city had become known in these sections through its\r\ntwo great mail-order houses, the Stock Yards, and the packing-plants with\r\ntheir numerous storage houses scattered in various towns and cities of\r\nthe South. It was rumored in these sections that the Stock Yards needed\r\n50,000 men; it was said that temporary housing was being provided by\r\nthese hard-pressed industries. Many Negroes came to the city on free\r\ntransportation, but by far the greater numbers paid their own fare.\r\nClub rates offered by the railroads brought the fare within reach of\r\nmany who ordinarily could not have brought their families or even come\r\nthemselves. The organization into clubs composed of from ten to fifty\r\npersons from the same community had the effect, on the one hand, of\r\nadding the stimulus of intimate persuasion to the movement, and, on the\r\nother hand, of concentrating solid groups in congested spots in Chicago.\r\n\r\nA study of certain Negro periodicals shows a powerful influence on\r\nsouthern Negroes already in a state of unsettlement over news of the\r\n\"opening up of the North.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Defender_ became a \"herald of glad tidings\" to southern\r\nNegroes. Several cities attempted to prevent its circulation among their\r\nNegro population and confiscated the street- and store-sales supplies as\r\nfast as they came. Negroes then relied upon subscription copies delivered\r\nthrough the mails. There are reports of the clandestine circulation\r\nof copies of the paper in bundles of merchandise. A correspondent of\r\nthe _Defender_ wrote: \"White people are paying more attention to the\r\nrace in order to keep them in the South, but the _Chicago Defender_ has\r\nemblazoned upon their minds 'Bound for the Promised Land.'\"\r\n\r\nIn Gulfport, Mississippi, it was stated, a man was regarded \"intelligent\"\r\nif he read the _Defender_, and in Laurel, Mississippi, it was said that\r\nold men who had never known how to read, bought the paper simply because\r\nit was regarded as precious.[18]\r\n\r\nArticles and headlines carrying this special appeal which appeared in\r\nthe _Defender_ are quoted:\r\n\r\n                  WHY SHOULD THE NEGRO STAY IN THE SOUTH?\r\n\r\n                          WEST INDIANS LIVE NORTH\r\n\r\n     It is true the South is nice and warm, and may I add, so is\r\n     China, and we find Chinamen living in the North, East, and\r\n     West. So is Japan, but the Japanese are living everywhere.\r\n\r\n                             SCHOOL BOARDS BAD\r\n\r\n     While in Arkansas a member of the school board in one of the\r\n     cities of that state (and it is said it is the rule throughout\r\n     the South that a Race woman teacher to hold her school must be\r\n     on friendly terms with some one of them) lived openly with a\r\n     Race woman, and the entire Race, men and women, were afraid to\r\n     protest or stop their children from going to school, because\r\n     this school board member would get up a mob and run them out\r\n     of the state. They must stomach this treatment.\r\n\r\n                            FROZEN DEATH BETTER\r\n\r\n     To die from the bite of frost is far more glorious than that\r\n     of the mob. I beg of you, my brothers, to leave that benighted\r\n     land. You are free men. Show the world that you will not let\r\n     false leaders lead you. Your neck has been in the yoke. Will\r\n     you continue to keep it there because some \"white folks Nigger\"\r\n     wants you to? Leave to all quarters of the globe. Get out of\r\n     the South. Your being there in the numbers you are gives the\r\n     southern politician too strong a hold on your progress.\r\n\r\n                               TURN DEAF EAR\r\n     Turn a deaf ear to everybody. You see they are not lifting\r\n     their laws to help you, are they? Have they stopped their Jim\r\n     Crow cars? Can you buy a Pullman sleeper where you wish? Will\r\n     they give you a square deal in court yet? When a girl is sent\r\n     to prison, she becomes the mistress of the guards and others\r\n     in authority, and women prisoners are put on the streets to\r\n     work, something they don't do to a white woman. And your leaders\r\n     will tell you the South is the best place for you. Turn a deaf\r\n     ear to the scoundrel, and let him stay. Above all, see to it\r\n     that that jumping-jack preacher is left at the South, for he\r\n     means you no good here at the North.\r\n\r\n                           GOOD-BYE, DIXIE LAND\r\n\r\n     _One of our dear southern friends_ informs an anxious public\r\n     that \"the Negroes of the North seem to fit very well into their\r\n     occupations and locations, but the southern Negro will never\r\n     make a success in the North. He doesn't understand the methods\r\n     there, the people and the work are wholly unsuited to him.\r\n     Give him a home in the South where climatic conditions blend\r\n     into his peculiar physical makeup, where he is understood and\r\n     can understand, and let him have a master and you have given\r\n     him the ideal home.\" There is the solution of the problem in\r\n     a nutshell. This dear friend thinks that under a master back\r\n     of the sugar cane and cotton fields, we might really be worth\r\n     something to the world. How thoughtful to point out the way\r\n     for our stumbling feet.\r\n\r\n     Those who live in the North presumably always lived there, and,\r\n     like Topsy, they \"just growed\" in that section, so naturally\r\n     fit well into their occupations. There is such a difference\r\n     between the white man and the black man of the South; the\r\n     former can travel to the North Pole if he chooses without\r\n     being affected, the latter, \"they say\" will die of a million\r\n     dread diseases if he dares to leave Dixie land, and yet the\r\n     thousands who have migrated North in the past year look as\r\n     well and hearty as they ever did. Something is wrong in our\r\n     friend's calculations.\r\n\r\n     We hear again and again of our \"peculiar physical makeup.\" Is\r\n     there something radically different about us that is not found\r\n     in other people? Why the constant fear of Negro supremacy if\r\n     the white brain is more active and intelligent than the brain\r\n     found in the colored man? A good lawyer never fears a poor one\r\n     in a court battle--he knows that he has him bested from the\r\n     start. The fact that we have made good wherever and whenever\r\n     given an opportunity, we admit, is a little disquieting, but\r\n     it is a way we have, and is hard to get out of. Once upon a\r\n     time we permitted other people to think for us--today we are\r\n     thinking and acting for ourselves, with the result that our\r\n     \"friends\" are getting alarmed at our progress. We'd like to\r\n     oblige these unselfish (?) souls and remain slaves in the\r\n     South, but to other sections of the country we have said, as\r\n     the song goes: \"I hear you calling me,\" and boarded the train\r\n     singing, \"Good-by to Dixie-Land.\"\r\n\r\nNews articles in the _Defender_ kept alive the enthusiasm and fervor of\r\nthe exodus:\r\n\r\n                           LEAVING FOR THE NORTH\r\n\r\n     Tampa, Fla., Jan. 19.--J. T. King, supposed to be a race leader,\r\n     is using his wits to get on the good side of the white people\r\n     by calling a meeting to urge our people not to migrate North.\r\n     King has been termed a \"good nigger\" by his pernicious activity\r\n     on the emigration question. Reports have been received here\r\n     that all who have gone North are at work and pleased with the\r\n     splendid conditions in the North. It is known here that in the\r\n     North there is a scarcity of labor, mills and factories are\r\n     open to them. People are not paying any attention to King and\r\n     are packing and ready to travel North to the \"promised land.\"\r\n\r\n                          DETERMINED TO GO NORTH\r\n\r\n     Jackson, Miss., March 23.--Although the white police and sheriff\r\n     and others are using every effort to intimidate the citizens\r\n     from going North, even Dr. Redmond's speech was circulated\r\n     around, this has not deterred our people from leaving. Many\r\n     have walked miles to take the train for the North. There is\r\n     a determination to leave and there is no hand save death to\r\n     keep them from it.\r\n\r\n                          THOMAS LIKES THE NORTH\r\n\r\n     J. H. Thomas, Birmingham, Ala., Brownsville Colony, has been\r\n     here several weeks and is very much pleased with the North.\r\n     He is working at the Pullman shops, making twice as much as\r\n     he did at home. Mr. Thomas says the \"exodus\" will be greater\r\n     later on in the year, that he did not find four feet of snow\r\n     or would freeze to death. He lives at 346 East Thirty-fifth St.\r\n\r\n                           LEAVING FOR THE EAST\r\n\r\n     Huntsville, Ala., Jan. 19.--Fifteen families, all members\r\n     of the Race, left here today for Pittsburgh, Pa., where they\r\n     will take positions as butlers, and maids, getting sixty to\r\n     seventy-five dollars per month, against fifteen and twenty\r\n     paid here. Most of them claim that they have letters from\r\n     their friends who went early and made good, saying that there\r\n     was plenty of work, and this field of labor is short, owing to\r\n     the vast amount of men having gone to Europe and not returned.\r\n\r\n                     THEY'RE LEAVING MEMPHIS IN DROVES\r\n\r\n               Some are coming on the passenger,\r\n               Some are coming on the freight,\r\n               Others will be found walking,\r\n               For none have time to wait.\r\n\r\nOther headlines read: \"Thousands Leave Memphis\"; \"Still Planning to Come\r\nNorth\"; \"Northbound Their Cry.\" These articles are especially interesting\r\nfor the impelling power of the suggestion of a great mass movement.\r\n\r\n_Denunciation of the South._--The idea that the South is a bad place,\r\nunfit for the habitation of Negroes, was \"played up\" and emphasized by\r\nthe _Defender_. Conditions most distasteful to Negroes were given first\r\nprominence. In this it had a clear field, for the local southern Negro\r\npapers dared not make such unrestrained utterances. Articles of this\r\ntype appeared:\r\n\r\n                              EXODUS TO START\r\n\r\n     Forest City, Ark., Feb. 16.--David B. Smith (white) is on\r\n     trial for life for the brutal murder of a member of the Race,\r\n     W. H. Winford, who refused to be whipped like others. This\r\n     white man had the habit of making his \"slave\" submit to this\r\n     sort of punishment and when Winford refused to stand for it,\r\n     he was whipped to death with a \"black snake\" whip. The trial\r\n     of Smith is attracting very little attention. As a matter of\r\n     fact, the white people here think nothing of it as the dead\r\n     man is a \"nigger.\"\r\n\r\n     This very act, coupled with other recent outrages that have\r\n     been heaped upon our people, are causing thousands to leave,\r\n     not waiting for the great spring movement in May.\r\n\r\nThe _Defender_ had a favorite columnist, W. Allison Sweeney. His specialty\r\nwas \"breaking southerners and 'white folks' niggers on the wheel.\" One\r\nof his articles in the issue of June 23, 1917, was captioned: \"A Chicago\r\n'Nigger' Preacher, a 'Feeder,' of The 'Little Hells,' Springs up to\r\nHinder Our Brethren Coming North.\"\r\n\r\nA passage from this article will illustrate the temper of his writings.\r\nAroused by what he calls a \"white folks nigger,\" he remarks:\r\n\r\n     Such a creature has recently been called to my attention, and\r\n     for the same reason that an unchecked rat has been known to\r\n     jeopardize the life of a great ship, a mouse's nibble of a\r\n     match to set a mansion aflame, I've concluded to carve a\r\n\r\n               \"Slice of liver or two\"\r\n\r\n     from that bellowing ass, who, at this very moment no doubt,\r\n     somewhere in the South, is going up and down the land, telling\r\n     the natives _why_ they should be content, as the _Tribune_,\r\n     puts it, to become \"Russianized,\" to remain in that land--to\r\n     them--of _blight_; of _murdered_ kin, _deflowered_ womanhood,\r\n     _wrecked_ homes, _strangled_ ambitions, _make-believe_ schools,\r\n     _roving_ \"gun parties,\" _midnight arrests_, _rifled_ virginity,\r\n     _trumped up_ charges, _lonely_ graves, where owls hoot, and\r\n     where friends dare not go! Do you wonder at the thousands\r\n     leaving the land where every foot of ground marks a tragedy,\r\n     leaving the grave of their fathers and all that is dear, to\r\n     seek their fortunes in the North? And you who say that their\r\n     going is to seek better wages are insulting truth, dethroning\r\n     reason, and consoling yourself with a groundless allegation.\r\n\r\n_Retaliation._--In answer to the warnings of the South against the rigors\r\nof the northern winters, articles of this nature appeared:\r\n\r\n                      FREEZING TO DEATH IN THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n     So much has been said through the white papers in the South\r\n     about the members of the race freezing to death in the North.\r\n     They freeze to death down South when they don't take care of\r\n     themselves. There is no reason for any human staying in the\r\n     Southland on this bugaboo handed out by the white press, when\r\n     the following clippings are taken from the same journals:\r\n\r\n                        AGED NEGRO FROZEN TO DEATH\r\n\r\n     Albany, Ga., Feb. 8.--Yesterday the dead body of Peter Crowder,\r\n     an old Negro, was found in an out-of-the-way spot where he\r\n     had been frozen to death during the recent cold snap [from\r\n     the _Macon_ (Georgia) _Telegraph_].\r\n\r\n                            DIES FROM EXPOSURE\r\n\r\n     Spartanburg, Feb. 6.--Marshall Jackson, a Negro man, who lived\r\n     on the farm of J. T. Harris near Campobello Sunday night froze\r\n     to death [from the _South Carolina State_].\r\n\r\n               NEGRO FROZEN TO DEATH IN FIRELESS GRETNA HUT\r\n\r\n     Coldest weather of the last four years claimed a victim Friday\r\n     night, when Archie Williams, a Negro, was frozen to death in\r\n     his bed in a little hut in the outskirts of Gretna [from the\r\n     _New Orleans Item_, dated Feb. 4th].\r\n\r\n                    NEGRO WOMAN FROZEN TO DEATH MONDAY\r\n\r\n     Harriet Tolbert, an aged Negro woman, was frozen to death in\r\n     her home at 18 Garibaldi Street early Monday morning during\r\n     the severe cold [Atlanta (Ga.) _Constitution_, dated Feb. 6].\r\n\r\n     If you can freeze to death in the North and be free, why\r\n     freeze to death in the South and be a slave, where your mother,\r\n     sister, and daughter are raped and burned at stake, where your\r\n     father, brother and son are treated with contempt and hung\r\n     to a pole, riddled with bullets at the least mention that he\r\n     does not like the way he has been treated?\r\n\r\n     Come North then, all of you folks, both good and bad. If you\r\n     don't behave yourself up here, the jails will certainly make\r\n     you wish you had. For the hard working man there is plenty of\r\n     work--if you really want it. The _Defender_ says come.\r\n\r\nStill in another mood:\r\n\r\n                        DIED, BUT TOOK ONE WITH HIM\r\n\r\n     Alexandria, La., Sept. 29.--Joe Pace (white) a southern workman,\r\n     who had a way of bulldozing members of the Race employed by\r\n     the Elizabeth Lumber Company, met his match here last Saturday\r\n     night.\r\n\r\n     Pace got into one of his moods and kicked a fellow named\r\n     Israel. Israel determined to get justice some way and knowing\r\n     that the courts were only for white men in this part of the\r\n     country, he took a shot at Pace and his aim was good.\r\n\r\nAnother type of article appeared. In keeping with the concept of the\r\nSouth as a bad place for Negroes, their escape from it under exceptional\r\ncircumstances was given unique attention. Thus, there were reported the\r\nfollowing kind of cases.\r\n\r\n                           SAVED FROM THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n                Lawyers Save Another from Being Taken South\r\n\r\n                           SAVED FROM THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n     Charged with Murder, but His Release Is Secured by Habeas Corpus\r\n\r\n                 NEW SCHEME TO KEEP RACE MEN IN DIXIE LAND\r\n\r\nA piece of poetry which received widespread popularity appeared in the\r\n_Defender_ under the title \"Bound for the Promise Land.\" Other published\r\npoems expressing the same sentiment were: \"Farewell, We're Good and\r\nGone\"; \"Northward Bound\"; \"The Land of Hope.\"\r\n\r\n     Five young men were arraigned before Judge E. Schwartz for\r\n     reading poetry. The police claim they were inciting riot in\r\n     the city and over Georgia. Two of the men were sent to Brown\r\n     farm for thirty days, a place not fit for human beings. Tom\r\n     Amaca was arrested for having \"Bound for the Promise Land,\"\r\n     a poem published in the _Defender_ several months ago. J. N.\r\n     Chislom and A. A. Walker were arrested because they were said\r\n     to be the instigators of the movement of the race to the North,\r\n     where work is plentiful and better treatment is given.\r\n\r\n_The \"Great Northern Drive.\"_--The setting of definite dates was another\r\nstimulus. The \"Great Northern Drive\" was scheduled to begin May 15,\r\n1917. This date, or the week following, corresponds with the date of\r\nthe heaviest arrivals in the North, the period of greatest temporary\r\ncongestion and awakening of the North to the presence of the new arrivals.\r\nLetters to the _Chicago Defender_ and to social agencies in the North\r\ninformed them of many Negroes who were preparing to come in the \"Great\r\nDrive.\" The following letter tells its own story:\r\n\r\n                                                 April 24th, 1917\r\n     _Mr. R. S. Abbot_\r\n\r\n     SIR: I have been reading the _Defender_ for one year or more\r\n     and last February I read about the Great Northern Drive to\r\n     take place May 15th on Thursday and now I can hear so many\r\n     people speaking of an excursion to the North on the 15th of\r\n     May for $3.00. My husband is in the North already working,\r\n     and he wants us to come up in May, so I want to know if it is\r\n     true about the excursion. I am getting ready and oh so many\r\n     others also, and we want to know is that true so we can be in\r\n     the Drive. So please answer at once. We are getting ready.\r\n\r\n                                                 Yours,\r\n                                                 ----\r\n\r\nUsually the dates set were for Wednesday and Saturday nights, following\r\npay days.\r\n\r\nIt is probably no exaggeration to say that the _Defender's_ policy\r\nprompted thousands of restless Negroes to venture North, where they were\r\nassured of its protection and championship of their cause. Many migrants\r\nin Chicago attribute their presence in the North to the _Defender's_\r\nencouraging pictures of relief from conditions at home with which they\r\nbecame increasingly dissatisfied as they read.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A NEGRO FAMILY JUST ARRIVED IN CHICAGO FROM THE RURAL\r\n   SOUTH]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO CHURCH IN THE SOUTH]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE ARRIVAL IN CHICAGO\r\n\r\nAt the time of the migration the great majority of Negroes in Chicago\r\nlived in a limited area on the South Side, principally between\r\nTwenty-second and Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth Avenue and State\r\nStreet, and in scattered groups to Cottage Grove Avenue on the east.\r\nState Street was the main thoroughfare. Prior to the influx of southern\r\nNegroes, many houses stood vacant in the section west of State Street,\r\nfrom which Negroes had moved when better houses became available east\r\nof State Street. Into these old and frequently almost uninhabitable\r\nhouses the first newcomers moved. Because of its proximity to the old\r\nvice area this district had an added undesirability for old Chicagoans.\r\nThe newcomers, however, were unacquainted with its reputation and had no\r\nhesitancy about moving in until better homes could be secured. As the\r\nnumber of arrivals increased, a scarcity of houses followed, creating\r\na problem of acute congestion.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1917 the Chicago Urban League made a canvass of\r\nreal estate dealers supplying houses for Negroes, and found that in a\r\nsingle day there were 664 Negro applicants for houses, and only fifty\r\nhouses available. In some instances as many as ten persons were listed\r\nfor a single house. This condition did not continue long. There were\r\ncounted thirty-six new neighborhoods, formerly white, opening up to\r\nNegroes within three months.\r\n\r\nAt the same time rents increased from 5 to 30 and sometimes as much\r\nas 50 per cent. A more detailed study of living conditions among the\r\nearly migrants in Chicago was made by the Chicago School of Civics\r\nand Philanthropy. The inquiry included seventy-five families of less\r\nthan a year's residence. In the group were sixty married couples, 128\r\nchildren, eight women, nine married men with families in the South. Of\r\nthese migrants forty-five families came from rural and thirty-two from\r\nurban localities. The greatest number, twenty-nine, came from Alabama;\r\ntwenty-five were from Mississippi, eleven from Louisiana, five from\r\nGeorgia, four from Arkansas, two from Tennessee, and one from Florida.\r\nForty-one of these seventy-five families were each living in one room.\r\nThese rooms were rented by the week, thus making possible an easy change\r\nof home at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that the greatest excitement over the \"incoming\r\nhordes of Negroes\" prevailed.\r\n\r\nA significant feature was the large number of young children found.\r\nThe age distribution of 128 children in these seventy-five families\r\nwas forty-seven under seven years, forty-one between seven and fourteen\r\nyears, and forty over fourteen years.\r\n\r\nMost of these children were of school age and had come from districts\r\nin the South which provided few school facilities. The parents were\r\nunaccustomed to the requirements of northern schools in matters of\r\ndiscipline, attendance, and scholarship. Considerable difficulty was\r\nexperienced by teachers, parents, and children in these first stages of\r\nadjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ADJUSTMENTS TO CHICAGO LIFE\r\n\r\nMeeting actual conditions of life in Chicago brought its exaltations and\r\ndisillusionments to the migrants. These were reflected in the schools,\r\npublic amusement places, industry, and the street cars. The Chicago\r\nUrban League, Negro churches, and Negro newspapers assumed the task of\r\nmaking the migrants into \"city folk.\" The increase in church membership\r\nindicates prompt efforts to re-engage in community life and establish\r\nagreeable and helpful associations. It also reflects the persistence of\r\nreligious life among the migrants. This increase is shown in Table V.\r\n\r\n                        TABLE V\r\n\r\n     =========================================\r\n                    |  INCREASE IN MEMBERSHIP\r\n                    | DURING MIGRATION PERIOD\r\n     NAME OF CHURCH |------------+------------\r\n                    |   Number   | Percentage\r\n     ---------------+------------+------------\r\n     Salem          |      700   |       51\r\n     Olivet         |    5,543   |       80\r\n     South Park     |    2,425   |    1,872\r\n     St. Mark's     |    1,800   |      100\r\n     Hyde Park      |       95   |      131\r\n     Bethel         |      650   |      800\r\n     Walters        |      351   |      338\r\n     ---------------+------------+------------\r\n\r\nAdjustment to new conditions was taken up by the Urban League as its\r\nprincipal work. Co-operating with the Travelers Aid Society, United\r\nCharities, and other agencies of the city, it met the migrants at stations\r\nand, as far as its facilities permitted, secured living quarters and\r\njobs for them. The churches took them into membership and attempted to\r\nmake them feel at home. Negro newspapers published instructions on dress\r\nand conduct and had great influence in smoothing down improprieties of\r\nmanner which were likely to provoke criticism and intolerance in the city.\r\n\r\nIndividual experiences of the migrants in this period of adjustment\r\nwere often interesting. The Commission made a special effort to note\r\nthese experiences for the light they throw upon the general process.\r\nMuch of the adjustment was a double process, including the adjustment\r\nof rural southern Negroes to northern urban conditions. It is to be\r\nremembered that over 70 per cent of the Negro population of the South\r\nis rural. This means familiarity with rural methods, simple machinery,\r\nand plain habits of living. Farmers and plantation workers coming to\r\nChicago had to learn new tasks. Skilled craftsmen had to relearn their\r\ntrades when they were thrown amid the highly specialized processes of\r\nnorthern industries. Domestic servants went into industry. Professional\r\nmen who followed their clientèle had to re-establish themselves in a\r\nnew community. The small business men could not compete with the Jewish\r\nmerchants, who practically monopolized the trade of Negroes near their\r\nresidential areas, or with the \"Loop\" stores.\r\n\r\nMany Negroes sold their homes and brought their furniture with them.\r\nReinvesting in property frequently meant a loss; the furniture brought\r\nwas often found to be unsuited to the tiny apartments or large, abandoned\r\ndwelling-houses they were able to rent or buy.\r\n\r\nThe change of home carried with it in many cases a change of status.\r\nThe leader in a small southern community, when he came to Chicago, was\r\nimmediately absorbed into the struggling mass of unnoticed workers.\r\nSchool teachers, male and female, whose positions in the South carried\r\nconsiderable prestige, had to go to work in factories and plants because\r\nthe disparity in educational standards would not permit continuance of\r\ntheir profession in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations in Table VI, taken from family histories, show how\r\nadjustment led to inferior occupation.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE VI\r\n\r\n     ======================================================================\r\n       Occupation in South  |  Occupation on First  |  Occupation One or\r\n                            |   Arrival in Chicago  |   More Years Later\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Display man on         |Laborer                |Laborer in factory\r\n     furniture              |                       |\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Stone mason            |Laborer in coal yard   |Laborer in Stock Yards\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Proprietor of café     |Laborer                |Elevator man\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Farmer                 |Laborer in Stock Yards |Laborer in Stock Yards\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Coal miner             |Porter in tailoring    |Janitor\r\n                            |shop                   |\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Proprietor of          |Laborer                |Laborer in Stock Yards\r\n     boarding-house         |                       |\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Farmer                 |Factory worker         |Factory worker\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Barber                 |Painter                |Janitor\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Hotel waiter           |Waiter                 |Porter in factory\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Plasterer              |Laborer in Stock Yards |Laborer in steel mill\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Farmer                 |Hostler                |Laborer in livery\r\n                            |                       |stable\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Clergyman              |Stationary fireman     |Laborer in Stock Yards\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Tinsmith               |Waiter                 |Laborer\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Farmer                 |Laborer in cement      |Laborer in Stock Yards\r\n                            |factory                |\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Blacksmith             |Barber                 |Janitor\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n     Office boy             |Porter                 |Laborer in Stock Yards\r\n     -----------------------+-----------------------+----------------------\r\n\r\nThe following experiences of one or two families from the many histories\r\ngathered, while not entirely typical of all the migrants, contain features\r\ncommon to all:\r\n\r\n     _The Thomas family._--Mr. Thomas, his wife and two children,\r\n     a girl nineteen and a boy seventeen, came to Chicago from\r\n     Seals, Alabama, in the spring of 1917. After a futile search,\r\n     the family rented rooms for the first week. This was expensive\r\n     and inconvenient, and between working hours all sought a house\r\n     into which they could take their furniture. They finally found\r\n     a five-room flat on Federal Street. The building had been\r\n     considered uninhabitable and dangerous. Three of the five\r\n     rooms were almost totally dark. The plumbing was out of order.\r\n     There was no bath, and the toilet was outside of the house.\r\n     There was neither electricity nor gas, and the family used\r\n     oil lamps. The rent was $15 per month. Although the combined\r\n     income of the family could easily have made possible a better\r\n     house, they could find none.\r\n\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. Thomas were farmers in the South. On the farm\r\n     Mrs. Thomas did the work of a man along with her husband. Both\r\n     are illiterate. The daughter had reached the fourth grade and\r\n     the boy the fifth grade in school. At home they belonged to\r\n     a church and various fraternal orders and took part in rural\r\n     community life.\r\n\r\n     On their arrival in Chicago they were short of funds. Father\r\n     and son went to work at the Stock Yards. Although they had\r\n     good jobs they found their income insufficient; the girl went\r\n     to work in a laundry, and the mother worked as a laundress\r\n     through the first winter for $1 a day. She later discovered\r\n     that she was working for half the regular rate for laundry\r\n     work. Soon she went back to housekeeping to reduce the food\r\n     bill.\r\n\r\n     All the family were timid and self-conscious and for a long\r\n     time avoided contacts, thus depriving themselves of helpful\r\n     suggestions. The children became ashamed of the manners of\r\n     their parents and worked diligently to correct their manner\r\n     of speech. The children attended Wendell Phillips night school\r\n     in the hope of improving their community status.\r\n\r\n     The freedom and independence of Negroes in the North have\r\n     been a constant novelty to them and many times they have been\r\n     surprised that they were \"not noticed enough to be mistreated.\"\r\n     They have tried out various amusement places, parks, ice-cream\r\n     parlors, and theaters near their home on the South Side and\r\n     have enjoyed them because they were denied these opportunities\r\n     in their former home.\r\n\r\n     The combined income of this family is $65 a week, and their\r\n     rent is now low. Many of their old habits have been preserved\r\n     because of the isolation in which they have lived and because\r\n     they have not been able to move into better housing.\r\n\r\n     _The Jones family._--Mr. Jones, his wife, a six-year-old son,\r\n     and a nephew aged twenty-one, came from Texas early in 1919.\r\n     Although they arrived after the heaviest migration, they\r\n     experienced the same difficulties as earlier comers.\r\n\r\n     They searched for weeks for a suitable house. At first they\r\n     secured one room on the South Side in a rooming-house, where\r\n     they were obliged to provide gas, coal, linen, bedding, and\r\n     part of the furniture. After a few weeks they got two rooms\r\n     for light housekeeping, for $10 a month. The associations as\r\n     well as the physical condition of the house were intolerable.\r\n     They then rented a flat on Carroll Avenue in another section.\r\n     The building was old and run down. The agent for the property,\r\n     to induce tenants to occupy it, had promised to clean and\r\n     decorate it, but failed to keep his word. When the Jones family\r\n     asked the owner to make repairs, he refused flatly and was\r\n     exceedingly abusive.\r\n\r\n     Finally Jones located a house on the West Side that was much\r\n     too large for his family, and the rent too high. They were\r\n     forced to take lodgers to aid in paying the rent. This was\r\n     against the desire of Mrs. Jones, who did not like to have\r\n     strangers in her house. The house has six rooms and bath and\r\n     is in a state of dilapidation. Mr. Jones has been forced to\r\n     cover the holes in the floor with tin to keep out the rats. The\r\n     plumbing is bad. During the winter there is no running water,\r\n     and the agent for the building refuses to clean more than three\r\n     rooms or to furnish screens or storm doors or to pay for any\r\n     plumbing. In the back yard under the house is an accumulation\r\n     of ashes, tin cans, and garbage left by a long series of\r\n     previous tenants. There is no alley back of the house, and all\r\n     of the garbage from the back yard must be carried out through\r\n     the front. Jones made a complaint about insanitary conditions\r\n     to the Health Department, and the house was inspected, but\r\n     so far nothing has been done. It was difficult to induce the\r\n     agent to supply garbage cans.\r\n\r\n     Jones had reached the eighth grade, and Mrs. Jones had\r\n     completed the first year of high school. The nephew had finished\r\n     public-school grades provided in his home town and had been\r\n     taught the boiler trade. He is now pursuing this trade in hope\r\n     of securing sufficient funds to complete his course in Conroe\r\n     College, where he has already finished the first year. The boy\r\n     of six was placed in a West Side school. He was removed from\r\n     this school, however, and sent back south to live with Mrs.\r\n     Jones's mother and attend school there. Mrs. Jones thought that\r\n     the influence of the school children of Chicago was not good\r\n     for him. He had been almost blinded by a blow from a baseball\r\n     bat in the hands of one of several older boys who continually\r\n     annoyed him. The child had also learned vulgar language from\r\n     his school associates.\r\n\r\n     The Jones family were leading citizens in their southern\r\n     home. They were members of a Baptist church, local clubs, and\r\n     a missionary society, while Jones was a member and officer\r\n     in the Knights of Tabor, Masons, and Odd Fellows. They owned\r\n     their home and two other pieces of property in the same town,\r\n     one of which brought in $20 a month. As a boiler-maker, he\r\n     earned about $50 a week, which is about the same as his present\r\n     income. Their motive in coming to Chicago was to escape from\r\n     the undesirable practices and customs of the South.\r\n\r\n     They had been told that no discrimination was practiced against\r\n     Negroes in Chicago; that they could go where they pleased\r\n     without the embarrassment or hindrance because of their color.\r\n     Accordingly, when they first came to Chicago, they went into\r\n     drug-stores and restaurants. They were refused service in\r\n     numbers of restaurants and at the refreshment counters in\r\n     some drug-stores. The family has begun the re-establishment\r\n     of its community life, having joined a West Side Baptist\r\n     church and taking an active interest in local organizations,\r\n     particularly the Wendell Phillips Social Settlement. The\r\n     greatest satisfaction of the Joneses comes from the \"escape\r\n     from Jim Crow conditions and segregation\" and the securing of\r\n     improved conditions of work, although there is no difference\r\n     in the wages.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MIGRANTS IN CHICAGO\r\n\r\nMigrants have been visited in their homes, and met in industry, in the\r\nschools, and in contacts on street cars and in parks. Efforts have been\r\nmade to learn why they came to Chicago and with what success they were\r\nadjusting themselves to their new surroundings.\r\n\r\n     Some of the replies to questions asked are given:\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Why did you come to Chicago?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Looking for better wages.\r\n\r\n     2. So I could support my family.\r\n\r\n     3. Tired of being a flunky.\r\n\r\n     4. I just happened to drift here.\r\n\r\n     5. Some of my people were here.\r\n\r\n     6. Persuaded by friends.\r\n\r\n     7. Wanted to make more money so I could go into business;\r\n     couldn't do it in the South.\r\n\r\n     8. To earn more money.\r\n\r\n     9. For better wages.\r\n\r\n     10. Wanted to change and come to the North.\r\n\r\n     11. Came to get more money for work.\r\n\r\n     12. To better my conditions.\r\n\r\n     13. Better conditions.\r\n\r\n     14. Better conditions.\r\n\r\n     15. Better living.\r\n\r\n     16. More work; came on visit and stayed.\r\n\r\n     17.

Working conditions and the places of amusement.\r\n\r\n     2. Yes. The chance to make a living; conditions on the street\r\n     cars and in movies.\r\n\r\n     3. Going into places of amusement and living in good\r\n     neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n     4. Yes. Educationally, and in the home conditions.\r\n\r\n     5. Yes. Go anywhere you want to go; voting; don't have to look\r\n     up to the white man, get off the street for him, and go to\r\n     the buzzard roost at shows.\r\n\r\n     6. Yes. Just seem to feel a general feeling of good-fellowship.\r\n\r\n     7. On the street cars and the way you are treated where you\r\n     work.\r\n\r\n     8. Yes. Can go any place I like here. At home I was segregated\r\n     and not treated like I had any rights.\r\n\r\n     9. Yes. Privilege to mingle with people; can go to the parks\r\n     and places of amusement, not being segregated.\r\n\r\n     10. Yes. Feel free to do anything I please. Not dictated to\r\n     by white people.\r\n\r\n     11. Yes. Had to take any treatment white people offered me\r\n     there, compelled to say \"yes ma'am\" or \"yes sir\" to white\r\n     people, whether you desired to or not. If you went to an ice\r\n     cream parlor for anything you came outside to eat it. Got off\r\n     sidewalk for white people.\r\n\r\n     12. Yes. Can vote; feel free; haven't any fear; make more money.\r\n\r\n     13. Yes. Voting; better opportunity for work; more respect\r\n     from white people.\r\n\r\n     14. Yes. Can vote; no lynching; no fear of mobs; can express\r\n     my opinion and defend myself.\r\n\r\n     15. Yes. Voting, more privileges; white people treat me better,\r\n     not as much prejudice.\r\n\r\n     16. Yes. Feel more like a man. Same as slavery, in a way,\r\n     at home. I don't have to give up the sidewalk here for white\r\n     people as in my former home.\r\n\r\n     17. Yes. No restrictions as to shows, schools, etc. More\r\n     protection of law.\r\n\r\n     18. Yes. Have more privileges and more money.\r\n\r\n     19. Yes. More able to express views on all questions. No\r\n     segregation or discrimination.\r\n\r\n     20. Sure. Feel more freedom. Was not counted in the South;\r\n     colored people allowed no freedom at all in the South.\r\n\r\n     21. Find things quite different to what they are at home.\r\n     Haven't become accustomed to the place yet.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: What were your first impressions of Chicago?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. I liked the air of doing things here.\r\n\r\n     2. A place of real opportunity if you would work.\r\n\r\n     3. Place just full of life. Went to see the sights every night\r\n     for a month.\r\n\r\n     4. I thought it was some great place but found out it wasn't.\r\n     Uncle told me he was living on Portland Avenue, that it was\r\n     some great avenue; found nothing but a mud hole. I sure wished\r\n     I was back home.\r\n\r\n     5. When I got here and got on the street cars and saw colored\r\n     people sitting by white people all over the car I just held my\r\n     breath, for I thought any minute they would start something,\r\n     then I saw nobody noticed it, and I just thought this was a\r\n     real place for colored people. No, indeed, I'll never work in\r\n     anybody's kitchen but my own, any more, that's the one thing\r\n     that makes me stick to this job.\r\n\r\n     6. Was completely lost, friend was to meet me but didn't and I\r\n     was afraid to ask anyone where to go; finally my friend came;\r\n     was afraid to sleep first night--so much noise; thought the\r\n     cars would finally stop running so I could rest.\r\n\r\n     7. Liked the place.\r\n\r\n     8. Always liked Chicago, even the name before I came.\r\n\r\n     9. Liked it fine.\r\n\r\n     10. Good city for colored people.\r\n\r\n     11. Fine city.\r\n\r\n     12. Thought it the best place for colored people.\r\n\r\n     13. Thought it a good place for colored people to live in.\r\n\r\n     14. Very favorable, thought it the place to be for myself and\r\n     family.\r\n\r\n     15. Didn't like it; lonesome, until I went out. Then liked\r\n     the places of amusement which have no restrictions.\r\n\r\n     16. Liked it fine, like it even better now.\r\n\r\n     17. Liked Chicago from the first visit made two years ago;\r\n     was not satisfied until I was able to get back.\r\n\r\n     18. Think I will like it later on.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: In what respects is life harder or easier here\r\n     than in the South?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Easier. I don't have to work so hard and get more money.\r\n\r\n     2. Easier in that here my wife doesn't have to work. I just\r\n     couldn't make it by myself in the South.\r\n\r\n     3. Living is much easier; chance to learn a trade. I make and\r\n     save more money.\r\n\r\n     4. Easier, you can make more money and it means more to you.\r\n\r\n     5. Easier to make a living here.\r\n\r\n     6. Easier, I get more money for my work and have some spare\r\n     time.\r\n\r\n     7. Have better home, but have to work harder. I make more\r\n     money, but spend it all to live.\r\n\r\n     8. Have more time to rest here and don't work as hard.\r\n\r\n     9. Find it easier to live because I have more to live on.\r\n\r\n     10. Earn more money; the strain is not so great wondering from\r\n     day to day how to make a little money do.\r\n\r\n     11. Work harder here than at home.\r\n\r\n     12. Easier. Work is hard, but hours are short. I make more\r\n     money and can live better.\r\n\r\n     13. More money for work, though work is harder. Better able\r\n     to buy the necessities of life.\r\n\r\n     14. Easier; more work and more money and shorter hours.\r\n\r\n     15. Living higher, but would rather be here than in South. I\r\n     have shorter hours here.\r\n\r\n     16. Don't have to work as hard here as at home. Have more time\r\n     for rest and to spend with family.\r\n\r\n     17. Easier to live in St. Louis. More work here and better\r\n     wages. Living higher here. Saved more there.\r\n\r\n     18. Must work very hard here, much harder than at home.\r\n\r\n     19.

Freedom in voting and conditions of colored people here.\r\n     I mean you can live in good houses; men here get a chance to\r\n     go with the best-looking girls in the race; some may do it in\r\n     Memphis, but it ain't always safe.\r\n\r\n     2. Freedom and chance to make a living; privileges.\r\n\r\n     3. Freedom and opportunity to acquire something.\r\n\r\n     4. Freedom allowed in every way.\r\n\r\n     5.

Privileges, freedom, industrial and educational facilities.\r\n\r\n     20. The people, the freedom and liberty colored people enjoy\r\n     here that they never before experienced.

Haven't found anything yet to like, except wife thinks\r\n     she will like the opportunity of earning more money than ever\r\n     before.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: What difficulties do you think a person from the\r\n     South meets in coming to Chicago?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Getting used to climate and houses.\r\n\r\n     2. Getting accustomed to cold weather and flats.\r\n\r\n     3.

Change in climate, crowded housing conditions.\r\n\r\n     16. Coming without knowing where they are going to stop usually\r\n     causes some difficulty. Get in with wrong people who seek to\r\n     take advantage of the ignorance of newcomers.\r\n\r\n     17. Becoming adjusted to climate.\r\n\r\n     18. If they know where they are going, when they come here.\r\n     The danger lies in getting among the wrong class of people.\r\n\r\n     19. Adjustment to city customs, etc.\r\n\r\n     20. If persons know where they are going and what they are\r\n     going to do, will not have any trouble. Must come with the\r\n     intention of working or else expect many difficulties.\r\n\r\n     21. Know of no difficulties.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you get more comforts and pleasures from your\r\n     higher wages?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Yes. Better homes, places of amusement, and the buying of\r\n     your clothes here. You can try on things; you can do that in\r\n     some stores in Memphis, but not in all.\r\n\r\n     2. Yes. Living in better houses, can go into almost any place\r\n     if you have the money, and then the schools are so much better\r\n     here.\r\n\r\n     3. Yes. I live better, save more, and feel more like a man.\r\n\r\n     4. Yes. I can buy more, my wife can have her clothes fitted\r\n     here, she can try on a hat, and if she doesn't want it she\r\n     doesn't have to keep it; go anywhere I please on the cars after\r\n     I pay my fare; I can do any sort of work I know how to do.\r\n\r\n     5. Yes. Go anywhere I please, buy what I please; ain't afraid\r\n     to get on cars and sit where I please.\r\n\r\n     6. Well, I make more money. I can't save anything from it.\r\n     There are so many places to go here, but down South you work,\r\n     work, work, and you have to save, for you haven't any place\r\n     to spend it.\r\n\r\n     7. Yes. Better homes. Spend money anywhere you want to, go\r\n     anywhere you have money enough to go; don't go out very much\r\n     but like to know I can where and when I want to.\r\n\r\n     8. Have chance to make more money, but it is all spent to keep\r\n     family up.\r\n\r\n     9. At home did not earn much money and did not have any left\r\n     to go what few places colored people were allowed to go. Here,\r\n     Negroes can have whatever they want.\r\n\r\n     10. Don't have to worry about how you are going to live. More\r\n     money earned affords anything wanted.\r\n\r\n     11. Have more comforts in the home that could not have at home;\r\n     more conveniences here. Wages sons earn make it possible to\r\n     have all that is wanted.\r\n\r\n     12. Yes. Better houses and more enjoyment.\r\n\r\n     13. Yes. I live in larger house and have more conveniences.\r\n     Can take more pleasure; have more leisure time.\r\n\r\n     14. Yes. Better houses and more amusement. More time of my\r\n     own, better furniture and food.\r\n\r\n     15. Yes. Better houses and furniture. More pleasures because\r\n     of shorter hours of work, giving me more time.\r\n\r\n     16. What little was earned at home was used for food and\r\n     clothing. Here, earn more, have more to spend; now and then\r\n     put some in the bank, and can spend some for pleasure without\r\n     strain or inconvenience.\r\n\r\n     17. Yes. More places to go, parks and playgrounds for children,\r\n     and no difference made between white and colored. Houses more\r\n     convenient here.\r\n\r\n     18. Have more money to spend but when you have to live in houses\r\n     where landlord won't fix up you can't have much comfort. Go\r\n     no place for pleasure, but enjoy the chance of earning more\r\n     money.\r\n\r\n     19. No comment.\r\n\r\n     20. Have money to get whatever is desired. Live in a better\r\n     house and can go places denied at home. All the family are\r\n     perfectly satisfied and are happier than they have ever been.\r\n\r\n     21. Live in better house than ever lived in. Never had the\r\n     comforts furnished here. Some houses there had no water closets;\r\n     only had cistern and wells out in the yard.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Are you advising friends to come to Chicago?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Yes. People down there don't really believe the things we\r\n     write back, I didn't believe myself until I got here.\r\n\r\n     2. No. I am not going to encourage them to come, for they\r\n     might not make it, then I would be blamed.\r\n\r\n     3. Yes. If I think they will work.\r\n\r\n     4. Some of them, those who I think would appreciate the\r\n     advantages here.\r\n\r\n     5. No. Not right now, come here and get to work, strikes come\r\n     along, they're out of work. Come if they want to, though.\r\n\r\n     6. Yes. I have two sisters still in Lexington. I am trying\r\n     to get them to come up here. They can't understand why I stay\r\n     here, but they'll see if they come.\r\n\r\n     7. Yes. People here don't realize how some parts of the South\r\n     treat colored folks; poor white trash were awful mean where\r\n     we came from; wish all the colored folks would come up here\r\n     where you ain't afraid to breathe.\r\n\r\n     8. Yes. Want friend and husband to come; also sister and family\r\n     who want her to come back that they may see how she looks\r\n     before they break up and come. Youngest son begs mother never\r\n     to think of going back South. Oldest son not so well satisfied\r\n     when first came, but since he is working, likes it a little\r\n     better.\r\n\r\nOnly a few migrants were found who came on free transportation, and many\r\nof these had friends in Chicago before they came. Few expressed a desire\r\nto return.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. EFFORTS TO CHECK MIGRATION\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of great numbers of Negroes, both because of the migration\r\nand because of military service, left large gaps in the industries of the\r\nSouth dependent upon Negro labor. Thousands of acres of rice and sugar\r\ncane went to waste. The turpentine industry of the Carolinas and the\r\nmilling interests of Tennessee were hard pressed for labor. Cotton-growing\r\nwas much affected, especially in the delta region of Mississippi. The\r\nsituation became critical, presenting a real economic problem. Organized\r\nefforts were made, and at times extreme measures were taken, to start a\r\nreturn movement. A report was circulated that on one day in the winter\r\nof 1919 in Chicago, 17,000 Negroes were counted in a bread line. The\r\n\"horrors of northern winters\" were played up as they had been during\r\nthe migration.\r\n\r\nThe press throughout the country was used to spread broadcast the South's\r\nneeds, its kind treatment of Negroes, its opportunities, and its growing\r\nchange of heart on the question of race relations. Newspaper articles\r\nfrom sections of the North and South carried about the same story.\r\nThe _Chicago Tribune_ said in a conspicuous headline: \"Louisiana Wants\r\nNegroes to Return.\" Other such headlines were: _Washington Post_--\"South\r\nNeeds Negroes. Try to Get Labor for Their Cotton Fields. Tell of Kind\r\nTreatment\"; _New York Evening Sun_--\"To Aid Negro Return\"; _Philadelphia\r\nPress_--\"South Is Urging Negroes to Return. Many Districts Willing to\r\nPay Fare of Those Who Come Back\"; _Memphis Commercial Appeal_--\"South\r\nIs Best for Negro, Say Mississippians. Colored People Found Prosperous\r\nand Happy.\"\r\n\r\nThough such reports were widely circulated throughout the North, the\r\nactual efforts of agencies from the South seeking the return of Negro\r\nlabor centered around Chicago. This was due largely to the fact that\r\nfrom the southern states most acutely in need the drift during the\r\nmigration had been to Chicago, and because the increase of Chicago's\r\nNegro population had been so great.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the riots in Chicago and Washington, rumors gained\r\nwide currency that hundreds of migrants were leaving for sections of\r\nthe South. So strong was the belief in the truth of this report that a\r\nChicago newspaper telegraphed the governors of southern states inquiring\r\nthe number of Negroes they needed. Agents of the South, including\r\nrepresentatives of the Tennessee Association of Commerce, the Department\r\nof Immigration of Louisiana, the Mississippi Welfare League, and the\r\nSouthern Alluvial Land Association, visited northern cities with a view to\r\nproviding means for the return of Negroes. Although free transportation\r\nwas offered, together with promises of increased wages and better living\r\nconditions, the various commissions were disappointed.\r\n\r\nTheir interviews with Negroes living in Chicago revealed a determination\r\nnot to return to conditions they had left two years before. To offset\r\nthis objection, two Chicago Negroes and one white man were taken to\r\nMississippi by a representative of the Mississippi Welfare League to\r\nmake an investigation. They visited several delta towns, traveling for\r\nthe most part in automobiles and interviewing farmers and laborers. They\r\nreported in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n     Railroad accommodations for Negroes were adequate and uniform,\r\n     irrespective of locality; treatment accorded Negro passengers\r\n     by railroad officials was courteous throughout. Public-school\r\n     terms were nine months in the city and eight months in the\r\n     country for white and colored alike, and the strongest possible\r\n     human ties between planter and worker exist.... In no instance\r\n     were Negroes not given the freest use of sidewalks, streets,\r\n     and thoroughfares and we were unable to find any trace of\r\n     friction of any kind between the races.\r\n\r\nAn effort was then made by the Chicago Urban League to ascertain the\r\nprecise state of affairs. Its southern representative questioned hundreds\r\nof Negroes living in the South, regarding improved relationships. Answers\r\nto this query were all about the same. Some of them are quoted:\r\n\r\n     There has been no change. Lincoln League organized in this\r\n     city has been denounced by the white newspapers as a movement\r\n     that will cause trouble, and the National Association for\r\n     the Advancement of Colored People, and the Urban Leagues of\r\n     various cities have been called \"strife breeders and meddlers\r\n     in southern affairs\"; Jim Crow accommodations are just the\r\n     same as ever. If there is any change for the better, I can't\r\n     see it.\r\n\r\n     It is ridiculous for any Negro to say he finds conditions\r\n     better here. Don't you remember that Negroes answering an\r\n     invitation to meet the Welfare Committee of white men not long\r\n     ago were told as soon as they got into the meeting place that\r\n     the Committee was ready to hear what Negroes wanted, but that\r\n     the question of the Negro's right to exercise the right of\r\n     voting would not be allowed to be discussed at all, and that\r\n     that must be agreed to before any discussion whatever would\r\n     be entertained, and that the Negroes left the meeting place\r\n     without a chance to demand the one thing they wished to enjoy?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Some deceitful, lying Negro may say that times are better, but\r\n     he would, at the same time, know that he was not telling the\r\n     truth. Haven't you been hearing more reports of lynching of\r\n     Negroes than you ever did in your life, since the war? Where,\r\n     then, is there any improvement? Ain't all the judges, all the\r\n     police and constables, all the juries as white man as ever?\r\n     Does the word of a Negro count for more now than it did before\r\n     the war? Don't white men insult our wives and daughters and\r\n     sisters and get off at it, unless we take the law into our\r\n     own hand and punish them for it ourselves, and get lynched\r\n     for protecting our own, just as often as ever? How much more\r\n     schooling from public funds do our children get now than they\r\n     got before the war? How much more do we have to say now than\r\n     we had to say before the war about the way the taxes we pay\r\n     shall be spent for schools, or for salaries, or for anything\r\n     connected with administration and government? Why, even the\r\n     colored man in Caddo parish who subscribed for $100,000 in\r\n     Liberty bonds and bought lots of War Savings stamps, and others\r\n     who bought less, but in the hundreds, and thousands of the\r\n     bonds and War Saving stamps, have no more to say about affairs\r\n     now than they ever had. Where is the improvement?\r\n\r\nThe Urban League also made an inquiry into the numbers of Negroes leaving\r\nand arriving in the week following the riot, and when the strongest\r\nefforts were being made to induce a return of migrants. During this\r\nperiod 261 Negroes came to Chicago and 219 left the city. Of the 219\r\nleaving, eighty-three gave some southern state as their destination.\r\nFor the most part, they were persons returning from vacations in the\r\nNorth, and Chicago Negroes going South to visit or on business. Some\r\nwere rejoining their families. Fourteen were leaving because of the\r\nriot. None, however, indicated any intention of going South to work.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that migrant Negroes are not returning South. On the contrary,\r\nthere is a small but continuous stream of migration to the industrial\r\ncenters of the North. No great number of Negroes returned to the South\r\neven during the trying unemployment period in the early part of 1921.\r\nCensus figures for Chicago for 1920 show a number much smaller than the\r\nusual estimates of the size of the Negro population during the period\r\nof the heaviest migration. This may be accounted for by the fact that\r\nChicago has been used as a re-routing point to other northern cities. The\r\ndecrease from 1918 undoubtedly means that some returned to the South, but\r\nit is apparent that the great majority of the migrants remain, despite\r\nthe hardships attending shortage of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO POPULATION OF CHICAGO\r\n\r\n\r\nA. DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY\r\n\r\nThe Negro population of Chicago, as reported by the Federal Bureau of\r\nthe Census, was 44,103 in 1910 and 109,594 in 1920. The increase during\r\nthe decade was therefore 65,491, or 148.5 per cent. Negroes constituted 2\r\nper cent of the city's total population in 1910 and 4.1 per cent in 1920.\r\nThe increase in the white population during the decade was 450,047, or\r\n21 per cent, bringing the white population up to 2,589,104 in 1920. The\r\nremainder of the population consisted of 3,007 Chinese, Japanese, and\r\nIndians, of whom there were 2,123 in 1910. Chicago's total population\r\nin 1920 was 2,701,705.\r\n\r\nIn order to indicate where the Negro population of the city lived in 1910\r\nand in 1920, the Commission sought the co-operation of the Census Bureau.\r\nOn the basis of a rough preliminary survey, certain areas in which it\r\nwas evident that the main groups of Negroes lived were delimited, and\r\nliberal margins allowed to include scattered residents living near the\r\nmain areas. For these areas the Census Bureau supplied figures showing\r\nthe total and Negro population by census-enumeration districts. Since\r\neach enumeration district embraced from one or two to six city blocks\r\nin the more crowded portions of the city, the data thus made available\r\nenabled the Commission to prepare maps showing with a fair degree of\r\naccuracy where Negroes in Chicago lived in 1910 and in 1920, and also\r\ntheir proportion to the total population in these units of area.\r\n\r\nThe 510 enumeration districts covered for 1910 included 40,739, or\r\n92.3 per cent of the 44,103 Negroes reported by the Census Bureau for\r\nthat year; and the 730 enumeration districts covered for 1920 included\r\n106,089, or 96.8 per cent of the 109,594 Negroes reported for that year.\r\nThe small remaining number of Negroes scattered throughout the parts\r\nof the city not embraced in these areas in 1910 and 1920 included many\r\njanitors living in the buildings where they worked, and others employed\r\nin private homes and living on the premises, thus making their presence\r\ninconspicuous among white residents. The areas in which 40,739 Negroes\r\nwere living in 1910 contained a total population of 657,044, the Negroes\r\nthus constituting 6.2 per cent of the total. The areas in which 106,089\r\nNegroes lived in 1920 contained a total population of 779,279, the\r\nNegroes thus constituting about 13 per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding fact concerning these data for 1910 and 1920 is that\r\nthe large increase in Negro population did not bring into existence any\r\nnew large colonies but resulted in the expansion and increased density\r\nof areas in which groups of Negroes already lived in 1910.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF NEGRO POPULATION 1910\r\n   DATA OBTAINED FROM FEDERAL CENSUS]\r\n\r\nBy far the largest number of Negroes in 1910 and 1920 lived in what\r\nmay be termed the old \"South Side,\" which includes the original \"Black\r\nBelt\" embracing the area from Twelfth to Thirty-first streets and from\r\nWentworth to Wabash avenues. This and other areas of Negro residence in\r\nvarious parts of the city, with their approximate boundaries in 1910\r\nand 1920 and their Negro population for both years, are listed here\r\nunder designations which are arbitrarily given for convenient reference;\r\nthey do not embrace the whole of each area commonly included under such\r\ndesignations.\r\n\r\n                                SOUTH SIDE\r\n\r\n     1910 boundaries: On the north, Twelfth Street; on the west,\r\n     Wentworth Avenue; on the south, Fifty-fifth Street; and on\r\n     the east, Indiana Avenue.

NEIGHBORHOODS OF NEGRO RESIDENCE\r\n\r\nWhile the principal colony of Chicago's Negro population is situated in a\r\ncentral part of the South Side, Negroes are to be found in several other\r\nparts of the city in proportions to total population ranging from less\r\nthan 1 per cent to more than 95 per cent. In some of these neighborhoods\r\nwhites and Negroes have become adjusted to one another; in others\r\nthey have not. There are numerous degrees of variation between the two\r\nextremes. In this study the term \"adjusted neighborhood\" indicates one\r\nin which whites and Negroes have become accommodated to each other, and\r\nfriction is either non-existent or negligible; \"non-adjusted neighborhood\"\r\nis one where misunderstandings, dislikes, and antagonisms resulting from\r\ncontacts of any degree between whites and Negroes express themselves in\r\nracial hostility, sometimes involving open clashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ADJUSTED NEIGHBORHOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE SOUTH SIDE\r\n\r\nThe most striking example of \"adjusted neighborhoods\" is the district\r\nknown as the \"Black Belt.\" Because 90 per cent of the Negroes of Chicago\r\nlive within this area, it is usually assumed that the district is 90\r\nper cent Negro. This, however, is not the case. The area between Twelfth\r\nand Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth Avenue and Lake Michigan, includes\r\nthe oldest and densest Negro population of any section of its size in\r\nChicago. However, the actual numbers of whites and Negroes living there\r\nare 42,797 and 54,906 respectively. In this area the Negro population has\r\nincreased gradually and without disturbance for many years. Although for\r\na long period Negroes were confined to the area bounded by State Street,\r\nWentworth Avenue, Twelfth, and Thirty-ninth streets, their movement\r\ninto the neighborhood east of State Street was ultimately looked upon\r\nas a natural and expected expansion. Within the whole of this territory\r\na relationship exists, which, although perhaps not uniformly friendly,\r\nyet is without friction or disorder. During the riot few white persons\r\nliving or engaged in business there were attacked by Negroes, who were\r\nin the majority in many parts of the area. Many whites remaining in the\r\narea, which was formerly all white, are small property owners who for\r\nsentimental reasons prefer to live there. Numbers of family hotels and\r\nlarge apartment houses there continue to be occupied by whites, who are\r\napparently little affected by the presence of 10 per cent more Negroes\r\nthan whites around them. Michigan Avenue and Grand Boulevard are the\r\nstreets into which Negroes have moved most recently. The only recorded\r\nbombing within this area occurred on Grand Boulevard. The Grand Boulevard\r\ndistrict is affiliated with the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'\r\nAssociation. Although the bombing was an expression of resentment against\r\nNegroes because they moved into this block, there are circumstances\r\nwhich indicate that the resentment did not come from the neighbors. For\r\nexample, the wife of a Negro physician owning and living in a house in\r\nthe same block was asked by her white neighbors to serve as chairman of\r\na committee to keep up the property in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RACIAL CONTACTS AMONG CHILDREN IN AN ADJUSTED\r\n   NEIGHBORHOOD]\r\n\r\nThe first Negro family to move into the Vernon Avenue block immediately\r\nsouth of Thirty-first Street bought its residence in 1911. It was five\r\nyears before another Negro family came. White neighbors, who were and are\r\nvery friendly, said this family's good care of its lawn was an example\r\nfor the whole block.\r\n\r\nWhen an apartment house in which a Negro family lived on South Park\r\nAvenue near Thirty-first Street was burned, white neighbors took them\r\ninto their home and kept them until another house was secured. At a\r\nmeeting of the City Club of Chicago a white man who had lived in this\r\narea for forty years thus characterized the relations between whites\r\nand Negroes living there:\r\n\r\n     Having lived on the South Side in what is now known as the\r\n     \"Black Belt\" for forty years, I can testify that I have never\r\n     had more honest, quiet, and law-abiding neighbors than those\r\n     who are of the African race, either full or mixed blood. In\r\n     the precinct where I live we have several families blessed\r\n     with many orderly and well-behaved children, of Caucasian and\r\n     African blood. They seem to get along nicely, and why should\r\n     they not?... There is no race question, it is a question of\r\n     intelligence and morality, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nOccasional minor misunderstandings have resulted from contacts in this\r\narea, but they have not been conspicuously marked by racial bitterness.\r\nObjections, sometimes expressed when the tradition of an \"all white\"\r\nneighborhood was first broken, disappeared as the neighbors came to know\r\neach other. Long residence is apparently one condition of the adjustment\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n_Expansion and adjustment._--The first noticeable expansion of the\r\nNegro population following the migration in 1917 and 1918 was in the\r\narea extending south from Thirty-ninth Street to Forty-seventh Street\r\non Langley, St. Lawrence, and Evans avenues. Negroes began moving into\r\nthis area early in 1917, first a few and finally in large numbers. There\r\nis yet no compact group, for these Negro families, while numerous, are\r\nwell distributed. The experiences of some of the first families there\r\nare interesting.\r\n\r\nA Negro woman bought a piece of property on Langley Avenue, near\r\nForty-third Street, when every other family in the block was white.\r\nThe courtesy shown her by them was all that could be desired, she\r\ndeclares. There are still six or eight white families in the block,\r\nand they continue on the most friendly terms with her. A Negro woman\r\nin another block has white neighbors all around her, but there has\r\nbeen no racial objection or friction. Another, who owns her property\r\non Evans Avenue, has had no trouble with white families that remain in\r\nthe block. So with a Negro who rents from the Negro owner of a flat on\r\nEast Thirty-sixth Street. A Negro who has bought a home on St. Lawrence\r\nAvenue near Forty-seventh Street declares that the white families living\r\nthereabouts \"treat my family right.\" In one block on St. Lawrence Avenue\r\na Negro family is surrounded by white neighbors, but no trouble has been\r\nexperienced. In a block on Langley Avenue another family of Negroes\r\nhas had no clashes with the white neighbors who compose most of the\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nA woman who built her home in the 4800 block on Champlain Avenue, when\r\nhers was the only Negro family there and has lived there ever since,\r\nhad no trouble with neighbors until other Negroes moved in. Then a white\r\nwoman circulated a petition for the purpose of compelling the Negroes to\r\nmove out. This effort failed. In another block on East Forty-sixth Street\r\na Negro family lives in a neighborhood which has a majority of whites,\r\nbut the relations have been amicable. An apartment house on Champlain\r\nAvenue near Forty-sixth Street is occupied entirely by Negroes, though\r\nthere are white families all through the neighborhood. One Negro who\r\nhas lived there for three years says they have never been molested. A\r\npioneer Negro family in a white block on Vernon Avenue near Thirty-ninth\r\nStreet reports no trouble with the white neighbors.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF NEGRO POPULATION 1920\r\n   DATA OBTAINED FROM FEDERAL CENSUS]\r\n\r\nTwo women who were among the last of the whites to leave the Langley\r\nAvenue vicinity say they always found the Negroes to be kindly neighbors.\r\nA Negro family on Forty-first Street has been there a year without\r\nfriction with white neighbors. In another block on East Forty-second\r\nStreet a Negro woman reported that, though there are white people all\r\nthrough the neighborhood, the two races get along peaceably. In the 400\r\nblock of East Forty-sixth Street a similar report is given. In still\r\nanother block on Champlain Avenue lives a woman who has been in the midst\r\nof white families for a number of years without experiencing animosity.\r\nOn East Forty-second Street a Negro family has lived for three years in\r\nsimilar freedom from racial friction.\r\n\r\nIn another instance a pioneer Negro family in a block otherwise wholly\r\nwhite was well regarded by all except one of the neighbors. This white man\r\nwho voiced loudly his objections to the \"invasion\" was one who, because\r\nof his drunken habits and troublesome nature, had long been considered\r\nan undesirable neighbor by other whites in the block.\r\n\r\n_Woodlawn._--Relations in Woodlawn, where the Negro population increase\r\nhas been relatively large, are for the most part friendly. There is\r\nan association of Negro property owners interested in keeping up the\r\nphysical appearance of their homes in the neighborhood. No clashes have\r\nbeen reported except one instance of a group of white boys from another\r\nneighborhood throwing stones at a building where they saw Negroes.\r\nFollowing the stirring up and organization of anti-Negro sentiment in\r\nHyde Park, an attempt was made to organize white Woodlawn property owners\r\nagainst the invasion of the district by Negroes. This organization was\r\nnot a great success. There have been no bombings in this district, and\r\nno concerted opposition to the presence of Negroes as neighbors. Long\r\nresidence together and the good character and conduct of both Negroes\r\nand whites are probably important reasons for lack of friction.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE WEST SIDE\r\n\r\nA situation like that in the adjusted neighborhoods of the South Side\r\nexists in the district bounded by Washington and Kinzie, Ashland and\r\nCalifornia avenues, where there has been a settlement of Negroes for\r\nmany years. Houses are cheaper than on the South Side, and although the\r\ngeneral standard of workingmen's homes compares favorably with that on\r\nthe South Side, few of the abandoned good residences formerly occupied\r\nby wealthy persons are available for Negroes. The densest and oldest\r\nsettlement of Negroes is within the boundaries named, although the Negro\r\nresidence area actually extends many blocks beyond them on all sides.\r\nThere has been little friction, though the area has 9,221 whites and\r\n6,520 Negroes. South of Washington Boulevard occasional difficulties\r\nhave been met by the incoming Negro population, similar to those found\r\nin areas where the most congested Negro population on the South Side is\r\nspreading. On the West Side no bombings have occurred, although there\r\nhave been frequent protests against the expansion. Some streets have\r\ncome to be recognized as Negro streets.\r\n\r\nIn recent years many Negroes have bought homes on the West Side when\r\nthey could not easily find living quarters in or near the older Negro\r\nresidence areas on the South Side. Almost uniformly they keep their\r\nhomes in good condition, which cannot be said of all the Negroes who\r\nsettled early in this district. West Side Negroes, laborers for the most\r\npart, are generally home-loving, hard-working, and desirous of improving\r\nconditions for their children. Older settlers among them have been able\r\nto make their adjustments without great difficulty and with no marked\r\nantagonism from white neighbors.\r\n\r\nThough occasionally trivial conflicts arise between Negro and white\r\nneighbors, the attitude of whites in nearby areas is customarily friendly\r\nif not cordial. For example, a Negro doctor has a considerable practice\r\namong nearby Italians in the vicinity of the Chicago Commons Social\r\nSettlement. At Chicago Commons itself no distinction is made with respect\r\nto the few Negro families which at times make use of the facilities.\r\nChildren of these families have entered classes and clubs, and one of\r\nthem became a leader of a group.\r\n\r\nThe Poles who mainly occupy the neighborhood around the Northwestern\r\nUniversity Social Settlement are entirely friendly to Negroes. Three\r\nyears ago an educated Negro was at the head of the boys' department of\r\nthe settlement, and, with one exception, no one in that position has\r\nmade more friends among the boys and their families.\r\n\r\nOn the West Side, as on the South and North sides, Negroes have\r\nestablished their own restaurants and barber shops and some groceries\r\nand delicatessen stores. There are several theaters whose patronage is\r\nlargely Negro.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE NORTH SIDE\r\n\r\nOn the North Side, Negroes live among foreign whites and near a residence\r\narea of wealthy Chicagoans. Their first appearance occasioned little\r\nnotice or objection, since they were generally house servants living\r\nnear their work. The largest numbers are to be found between Chicago\r\nAvenue and Division Street on North Wells, Franklin, and cross streets\r\nconnecting them.\r\n\r\nThis neighborhood has experienced several complete changes in population.\r\nIt was first occupied by Irish, then by Swedes, then by Italians. The\r\npresent neighbors of Negroes are Italians. As indicated by the population\r\nchanges, the neighborhood is old and run down, and the reasons given by\r\nNegroes for living there are low rents and proximity to the manufacturing\r\nplants where they work.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes there are renters, because the property, although undesirable\r\nfor residence purposes, is valuable for business and too expensive for\r\nthem to buy. The families are chiefly respectable, hard-working people.\r\nThey have their own barber and tailor shops and similar business places.\r\nIn social affairs they confine themselves largely to meetings, dances,\r\nand similar gatherings held exclusively for their own race. Formerly\r\nthe second floor of a building on Division Street was frequently rented\r\nby the Negroes for church and other meetings, and dances. Recently they\r\nhave found other meeting places, particularly for religious devotions.\r\nSome of their social gatherings and meetings take place at Seward Park.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A SAVINGS BANK IN THE NEGRO RESIDENCE AREA ON SATURDAY\r\n   EVENING]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHILDREN AT WORK IN A COMMUNITY GARDEN]\r\n\r\nThey are welcomed not only in Seward Park, one of the city's recreation\r\ncenters, but in the settlements. At Eli Bates House, 621 West Elm Street,\r\nfor example, there has been a club of Negro young men, and applications\r\nhave been received for admission of Negro children to some classes.\r\nThe head resident of the settlement reports, however, that it has not\r\nhad much contact with the Negro group. A few Negro children come to the\r\nkindergarten; a group of Negro boys makes use of the gymnasium, and some\r\nneighboring Negro families have asked settlement residents for advice.\r\n\r\nIn this neighborhood friendly relations exist between the Sicilians, who\r\npredominate, and their Negro neighbors. Some Negroes live harmoniously\r\nin the same tenements with the Sicilians. Their children play together,\r\nand some Negro children have learned Sicilian phrases, so that they are\r\nable to deal with the Sicilian shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nElsewhere on the North Side the feeling between Italians and Negroes is\r\nnot so cordial. During the riot of 1919, serious trouble was averted\r\non the North Side through prompt and effective efforts by the police\r\nand members of the community. It was reported throughout the district\r\nthat automobiles loaded with armed Negroes were on their way from the\r\nSouth Side to \"shoot up the North Side.\" The Italians immediately armed\r\nthemselves and began to shoot recklessly. They were eventually quieted\r\nby the police and others, and there was no retaliation of the Negroes.\r\n\r\nMany Negroes who have purchased homes and lived on the North Side for\r\nyears report little opposition. One family on North Wells Street has lived\r\nthere since 1888 and now owns several valuable pieces of property. The\r\nman had no trouble in buying property, and the whites have always been\r\nfriendly to them and to all Negroes in that section. Another Negro family\r\non North Wells Street, where Negroes first lived, had no difficulty in\r\ngetting their flat sixteen years ago. This block is occupied by whites\r\nand Negroes without friction.\r\n\r\nMinor expressions of antagonism attended the moving in of some Negro\r\nfamilies, but after several months the white neighbors accepted them\r\nand now are on good terms with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NON-ADJUSTED NEIGHBORHOODS\r\n\r\nFailure of adjustment between whites and Negroes has greatly accentuated\r\nthe difficulties of the housing problem for Negroes. When a general\r\nshortage of housing is relieved there may still be a serious shortage for\r\nNegroes because of the hostility of white neighborhoods. The sentiment\r\nfor \"all-white\" neighborhoods has grown with the increase in Negro\r\npopulation and the threatened occupancy in small or large degree by\r\nNegroes. These non-adjusted neighborhoods fall into distinct classes:\r\n\r\n1. Neighborhoods of unorganized opposition. These are neighborhoods\r\nwhere few Negroes live. Though contiguous they are sharply separated\r\nfrom areas of Negro residence and are definitely hostile to Negroes,\r\neven those passing through the neighborhood going to and from work, but\r\nthe hostility in them is unorganized.\r\n\r\n2. Neighborhoods of organized opposition. (_a_) Neighborhoods in which no\r\nNegroes live but which are in the line of Negro expansion. Opposition to\r\nthreatened invasion has been strong. As yet they are exclusively white,\r\nand every effort is being made to keep them so. They are illustratively\r\ntreated here as \"exclusive neighborhoods.\" (_b_) Neighborhoods in which\r\nthe presence of Negro residents is hotly contested, by organized and\r\nunorganized efforts to oust them. These for convenience are termed\r\n\"contested neighborhoods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NEIGHBORHOODS OF UNORGANIZED OPPOSITION\r\n\r\nIn Certain West Side neighborhoods white property owners objected to\r\nthe expansion of the principal Negro residence area of that section.\r\n\r\nThe pastor of the Negro Presbyterian Church on Washington Boulevard, who\r\ncame to Chicago in 1919, bought the houses at 2006 and 2008 Washington\r\nBoulevard, in which white people had formerly lived. He moved into one\r\nof them in May, 1919, and both he and his tenants in the other house\r\nreceived warning letters advising them to move or take the consequences.\r\nThe last of these was received during the riot in July, 1919. No attention\r\nwas paid to them.\r\n\r\nDuring the riots little trouble was experienced by the Negroes in the\r\nWest Side district, who generally remained in their own houses and\r\nneighborhoods. Some became involved in clashes on their way to or from\r\nwork, but there was no serious clash.\r\n\r\nThe district west of Cottage Grove Avenue and south to Sixty-third Street\r\nin Woodlawn is rather sparsely built up, most of the buildings being\r\none- and two-family houses. Numbers of white people in the neighborhood\r\nbelieve that the district has been blighted because of the occasional\r\npresence of Negroes.\r\n\r\nOn the North Side some hostility to Negroes was shown during the 1919\r\nriot. One Negro, who had lived on North Franklin Street for five years\r\nand in Chicago for thirty years, told of having been spit at by rowdy\r\nItalians, and on another occasion threatened with shooting by young\r\nroughs in a passing automobile. White neighbors, however, intervened.\r\nUnder pressure of the riot excitement, some Italian children pushed\r\nthrough windows and doors pictures of skulls and coffins inked in red.\r\nAt the time of the riot Eli Bates House issued a circular deploring race\r\nhatred and appealing for order and fairness.\r\n\r\nAlthough the few Negroes living in the Lake Park Avenue area[19] have\r\nexperienced little opposition in their present homes, there has been no\r\nNegro expansion there. The colony, has in fact, dwindled in size since\r\n1910. It is made up largely of Negroes who were house servants for white\r\nfamilies near-by or worked in the hotels of the district.\r\n\r\nNegroes of this colony are barred from all white restaurants in\r\nthe district except one place conducted by a Greek. In three of the\r\nmotion-picture houses they are not allowed to sit in the best seats. In\r\none of these theaters a sign reads, \"We reserve the right to seat our\r\npatrons to suit ourselves.\" Negroes are permitted in the balcony or in\r\nthe rear seats of the main floor.\r\n\r\nOn Langley, St. Lawrence, and adjoining streets south of Fifty-fifth\r\nStreet there is considerable friction resulting from the presence of\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nThere are residence districts of Chicago adjacent to those occupied\r\nby Negroes in which hostility to Negroes is so marked that the latter\r\nnot only find it impossible to live there, but expose themselves to\r\ndanger even by passing through. There are no hostile organizations in\r\nthese neighborhoods, and active antagonism is usually confined to gang\r\nlawlessness. Such a neighborhood is that west of Wentworth Avenue,\r\nextending roughly from Twenty-second to Sixty-third streets. The number\r\nof Negroes living there is small, and most of them live on Ada, Aberdeen,\r\nand Loomis streets, south of Fifty-seventh Street. In the section\r\nimmediately west of Wentworth Avenue and thus adjoining the densest Negro\r\nresidence area in the city, practically no Negroes live. In addition to\r\nintense hostility, there is a lack of desirable houses. Wentworth Avenue\r\nhas long been regarded as a strict boundary line separating white and\r\nNegro residence areas. The district has many \"athletic clubs.\"[20] The\r\ncontact of Negroes and whites comes when Negroes must pass to and from\r\ntheir work at the Stock Yards and at other industries located in the\r\ndistrict. It was in this district that the largest number of riot clashes\r\noccurred.[21] Several Negroes have been murdered here, and numbers have\r\nbeen beaten by gangs of young men and boys. A white man was killed by one\r\nof two Negroes returning from work in that district, who declared that\r\nthey had been intimidated by the slain man. Speaking of this district,\r\nthe principal of the Raymond School, a branch of which is located west\r\nof Wentworth Avenue, said that antagonism of the district against Negroes\r\nappeared to have been handed down through tradition. He said:\r\n\r\n     We get a good deal of the gang spirit in the new school on the\r\n     other side of Wentworth Avenue. There seems to be an inherited\r\n     antagonism. Wentworth Avenue is the gang line. They seem to\r\n     feel that to trespass on either side of that line is ground\r\n     for trouble. While colored pupils who come to the school for\r\n     manual training are not troubled in the school, they have to\r\n     be escorted over the line, not because of trouble from members\r\n     of the school, but groups of boys outside the school. To give\r\n     another illustration, we took a little kindergarten group over\r\n     to the park. One little six-year-old girl was struck in the\r\n     face by a man. A policeman chased but failed to catch him.\r\n     The condition is a tradition. It is handed down.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. NEIGHBORHOODS OF ORGANIZED OPPOSITION\r\n\r\n\"_Exclusive neighborhoods._\"--In neighborhoods which are exclusive on\r\nthe basis of social class, whose restrictions apply to Negroes and the\r\nmajority of whites alike, the high price of property is a sufficient\r\nbarrier against Negroes; it is in the neighborhoods where property values\r\nare within the means of Negroes that fears of invasion are entertained.\r\nIn many new real estate subdivisions houses are sold on easy payments.\r\nAlmost without exception these sections are exclusively for whites,\r\nand usually it is so stated in the prospectus. Other sections longer\r\nestablished come to notice when some incident provokes the expression\r\nof opposition already organized and awaiting it.\r\n\r\nSuch a section is the neighborhood known as Park Manor and Wakeford.\r\nThis neighborhood lies between Sixty-ninth and Seventy-ninth streets,\r\nand Cottage Grove and Indiana avenues. It is newly built, chiefly with\r\nsmall dwellings, most of them not more than five years old. Many of the\r\nresidents had lived in a neighborhood to the north, nearer Woodlawn,\r\nwhose growth of Negro population had caused some of them to move. Park\r\nManor and Wakeford were startled by the following advertisement in the\r\n_Chicago Daily News_ in July, 1920:\r\n\r\n     For sale--Colored Attention: homes on Vernon, South Park\r\n     and Indiana Aves. Sold on easy terms; come out and look this\r\n     locality over; Protestant neighborhood, Park Manor and Wakeford;\r\n     good transportation. Blair, 7455 Cottage Grove Avenue.\r\n\r\nBlair, a real estate agent, denied all knowledge of the advertisement\r\nand attributed it either to an enemy or to a practical joker. He sent\r\nnotices to be read the following day in the nine churches of the district,\r\nso stating, deploring the occurrence and pledging himself to aid the\r\nother residents in excluding Negroes and in hunting down the author of\r\nthe advertisement.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the entire district had been aroused, and a meeting called for\r\nthe evening of July 12, in front of a church at Seventy-sixth Street and\r\nSt. Lawrence Avenue. About 1,000 people gathered for this meeting, which\r\nwas conducted by the presidents of the South Park Manor and Wakeford\r\nImprovement Associations. The former announced that he had visited the\r\n_Daily News_ and learned that the advertisement had been handed to a\r\nclerk in typewritten form and with a typewritten signature, and paid for\r\nin advance, whereas Blair's regular advertising was done on a charge\r\naccount. This and other information tended to show that the agent was\r\nnot responsible for the advertisement. In its issue of Monday, July 12,\r\nthe _Daily News_ printed an explanatory statement.\r\n\r\nOther speakers at the meeting were a real estate dealer and an alderman.\r\nConsiderable indignation was expressed over the false light in which the\r\ncommunity had been placed. Even the suggestion that Negroes might by\r\nchance become a part of this community seemed to be abhorrent. As far\r\nas Negroes were concerned there was no excitement, but they resented\r\nbeing used to frighten white residents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PROPORTION OF NEGROES TO TOTAL POPULATION 1910\r\n   DATA OBTAINED FROM FEDERAL CENSUS]\r\n\r\n\"_Contested neighborhoods._\"--The contested neighborhoods are by far\r\nthe most important among the types of non-adjusted neighborhoods, both\r\nbecause of the actual presence in them of varying numbers of Negroes\r\nand their bearing on the future relations of the races. The efforts in\r\nsuch neighborhoods to keep out Negroes involve stimulation of anti-Negro\r\nsentiment and organization of property owners, and the campaign against\r\nthe presence of Negroes as neighbors develops into a campaign against\r\nNegroes. Negroes in turn resent both the propaganda statements and the\r\norganized efforts. A continuous struggle, marked by bombings, foreclosures\r\nof mortgages, and court disputes, is the result.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous type of a \"contested neighborhood\" is that known as\r\nKenwood and Hyde Park. In this general neighborhood, from Thirty-ninth\r\nto Fifty-ninth streets and from State Street to Lake Michigan, hostility\r\ntoward Negroes has been plainly and even forcibly expressed through\r\norganized efforts to oust them and prevent their further encroachment.\r\nThe situation is peculiar. This is the part of the old South Side in\r\nwhich most of the Negro population of Chicago has settled. The so-called\r\n\"Black Belt\" has been overcrowded for years. Old and deteriorated housing\r\nand its insufficiency have been steadily driving Negroes out of it in\r\nsearch of other homes.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the great influx of migrants should overflow\r\ninto surrounding territory. Many migrants brought funds, having sold out\r\ntheir homes and other possessions. Negroes who had lived for some time\r\nin the \"Black Belt\" were eager to escape from it, and here was their\r\nopportunity. They did not wish to go too far from their churches and\r\nother established institutions, and Hyde Park was immediately adjoining.\r\n\r\nConditions in Hyde Park during 1916 and 1917 favored the overflow.\r\nNumbers of new, and in some instances high-grade, apartment houses had\r\nbeen built during the previous ten or fifteen years. Many whites were\r\nleaving their individual houses to live in these apartments or to move to\r\nthe North and South Shore regions. The houses had become less desirable,\r\nand many of them were vacant. The district, except for certain definite\r\nneighborhoods, had lost much of its former aristocratic air, with the\r\ncoming of rooming-and boarding-houses. During 1914, 1915, and 1916 many\r\nhouses and apartments in Hyde Park were vacant or were rented at low\r\nprices. Inducements were offered to prospective tenants in the form of\r\nextensive decorations and repairs, or some rental allowance.\r\n\r\nNegroes bought houses and apartment buildings and rented anything\r\nrentable. This expansion of the Negro boundaries was promoted by both\r\nwhite and Negro real estate agents and property owners with little\r\nopposition. These men soon learned that Negroes, with their increased\r\nwages due to war conditions, were able to make first payments, at least,\r\non houses and to rent better houses or flats than they had previously\r\nbeen obliged to occupy.\r\n\r\nThen the entrance of the United States into the war in 1917 and the\r\nsuspension of building operations occasioned a house shortage which\r\nbecame acute in 1918. The white demand for dwellings began to exceed\r\nthe supply. Real estate men of the neighborhood began to discuss plans\r\nfor re-establishing it as an exclusively white neighborhood. A survey\r\nby the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association showed that\r\nof the 3,300 property owners in the district, about 1,000 were Negroes.\r\nNeighbors had objected little, the entrance of the Negroes having been\r\nso gradual that it was almost unnoticeable.\r\n\r\nBoth Kenwood and Hyde Park, using these terms in the more restricted sense\r\nof the original residential localities that bore the names, had enjoyed\r\nthe activities of local improvement organizations whose function it was\r\nto keep the streets sprinkled and clean, to procure better lighting, and\r\notherwise improve civic conditions. The Kenwood and Hyde Park Property\r\nOwners' Association became prominent in 1918 on account of its agitation\r\nto \"make Hyde Park white.\" In October, 1918, a form letter was sent out\r\ncalling a meeting of the Grand Boulevard district of this Association\r\nfor October 20. The letter said in part: \"We are a red blood organization\r\nwho say openly, we won't be driven out. We make no secret of our methods,\r\nthey are effective and legal.\" A dodger announcing the same meeting read:\r\n\r\n     Every white person Property Owner in Hyde Park come to this\r\n     meeting. Protect your Property.\r\n\r\n     Shall we sacrifice our property for a third of its value and\r\n     run like rats from a burning ship, or shall we put up a united\r\n     front and keep Hyde Park desirable for ourselves? It's not\r\n     too late.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Boulevard district, described as extending from Thirty-ninth\r\nto Sixty-third streets, and from Michigan to Cottage Grove avenues was\r\nincluded in the consolidated organization of the Hyde Park and Kenwood\r\ndistricts. This Association, as was asserted by its president, also\r\nhad the co-operation of three other similar organizations, one in the\r\nWashington Park district, the Lake Front Community Property Owners'\r\nAssociation, operating in the district north of Thirty-ninth Street and\r\nsouth of Thirty-third Street, east of Cottage Grove Avenue; and one in\r\nthe Englewood district, which is southwest of Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nOrganization of sentiment: It does not appear that the residents\r\nof this neighborhood rose spontaneously to oppose the coming in of\r\nNegroes. If this had been the case, the first Negroes moving into the\r\ndistrict in 1917 would have felt the opposition. The sudden interest in\r\nrace occupancy was based upon the alleged depreciation of property by\r\nNegroes. With this emphasized, it was not difficult to rally opposition\r\nto Negroes as a definite menace. The real estate men gave the alarm,\r\nalleging a shrinkage in property values. The effort through the Hyde\r\nPark and Kenwood Association was intended to stop the influx and thereby\r\nthe depreciation. Meetings were held, a newspaper was published, and\r\nliterature was distributed. Racial antagonism was strong in the speeches\r\nat these meetings and in the newspapers. The meeting which probably\r\nmarked the first focusing of attention on the Kenwood and Hyde Park\r\ndistricts was held May 5, 1919, when the sentiment was expressed that\r\nNegro invasion of the district was the worst calamity that had struck\r\nthe city since the Great Fire. A prominent white real estate man said:\r\n\"Property owners should be notified to stand together block by block\r\nand prevent such invasion.\"\r\n\r\nDistinctly hostile sentiments were expressed before audiences that came\r\nexpecting to hear how their property might be saved from \"almost certain\r\ndestruction.\" A speaker at one of the meetings said in part:\r\n\r\n     We are taught that the principle of virtue and right shall be\r\n     the rule of our conduct in all of our transactions with our\r\n     fellow-men, and therefore it is our duty to help the Negro, to\r\n     uplift him in his environment, mark you, not ours. But it is\r\n     not our duty, now mark this, it is not our duty as I see it,\r\n     nor is it according to the laws of nature for us to live with\r\n     him as neighbors or on a social basis. There is an immutable,\r\n     unchanging law that governs the distribution, association and\r\n     conduct of all living creatures. Man is no exception to the\r\n     universal rule. In every land and clime man obeys the second\r\n     law of his nature and seeks his own kind, avoiding every\r\n     other, and ever, ever is he warring with his unlike neighbor,\r\n     families, classes, societies, tribes, and nations.\r\n\r\n     There are men who proclaim to the world and ourselves that the\r\n     destiny of the black man and the white man is one. I do not\r\n     believe it; I cannot believe it. Now, listen! As far back as\r\n     September 18, 1858, in his famous joint debate with Stephen\r\n     A. Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, that wonderful, Godlike man, the\r\n     liberator of the slaves, said this (Now listen, 1858, over\r\n     sixty years ago): \"I am not nor ever have been in favor of\r\n     bringing about in any way the social and political equality\r\n     of the white and the black race. I am not nor ever have been\r\n     in favor of qualifying them to intermarry with white people,\r\n     and I will say in addition to this, that there is a physical\r\n     difference between the white and black races living together\r\n     on terms of social and political equality.\"\r\n\r\nOther remarks of speakers at these meetings were:\r\n\r\n     The depreciation of our property in this district has been two\r\n     hundred and fifty millions since the invasion. If someone told\r\n     you that there was to be an invasion that would injure your\r\n     homes to that extent, wouldn't you rise up as one man and one\r\n     woman, and say as General Foch said: \"They shall not pass\"?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     There isn't an insurance company in America that will turn\r\n     around and try to buck our organization when we as one man\r\n     give them to understand that it is dangerous to insure some\r\n     people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Why I remember fifteen or twenty years ago that the district\r\n     down here at Wabash Avenue and Calumet was one of the most\r\n     beautiful and highest-class neighborhoods of this great city.\r\n     Go down there today and see the ramshackle broken-down and\r\n     tumble-down district. That is the result of the new menace\r\n     that is threatening this great Hyde Park district. And then\r\n     tell me whether there are or not enough red-blooded, patriotic,\r\n     loyal, courageous citizens of Hyde Park to save this glorious\r\n     district from the menace which has brought so much pain and\r\n     so much disaster to the district to the south of us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     You cannot mix oil and water. You cannot assimilate races of\r\n     a different color as neighbors along social lines. Remember\r\n     this: That order is heaven's first law.\r\n\r\nThroughout the meetings, profession was made of friendliness toward\r\nthe Negroes, together with a desire to serve their needs and accord\r\nthem fair treatment. The _Property Owners' Journal_, published by the\r\nAssociation, was less guarded. While some of its columns made similar\r\nprofessions, its remarks in other columns were characterized by extreme\r\nracial bitterness and antagonism.\r\n\r\nAn apparently conciliatory attitude was also taken by speakers at meetings\r\nof the Hyde Park Association and its Grand Boulevard branch. In a meeting\r\nof the latter on January 19, 1920, the chairman declared that he wished\r\nto say for publication: \"We have no quarrel with the colored people.\r\nWe have no desire to intimidate them by violence.\" The mission of the\r\norganization, he said, was peaceable, and it was the purpose to proceed\r\naccording to law and order. The Association, he averred, had been charged\r\n\"by the colored press\" with being parties to bombing outrages. He wanted\r\nit known that \"we have denounced officially the action of anyone or any\r\nset of people who would indulge in a practice of that character.\" The\r\nstory of the bombing campaign is given in another section of this report.\r\n\r\nAt another meeting it was asserted that the Kenwood and Hyde Park\r\nAssociation had a membership of 1,000 persons, and it was estimated that\r\nin the district to which it applied the investment in real estate was\r\n$1,000,000,000. The purpose of the organization was declared to be \"to\r\nguard that $1,000,000,000 against depreciation from anything.\" One speaker\r\nsaid he did not believe there was a piece of property west of Cottage\r\nGrove Avenue in Hyde Park that was worth 33 cents on the dollar \"as it\r\nstands now with this invasion.\" He said his home cost about $25,000,\r\nbut he felt safe in saying that he could not then get $8,000 for it. A\r\ncity alderman was one of the speakers at this meeting.\r\n\r\nMost of the real estate dealers in the area were claimed as members of the\r\nKenwood and Hyde Park Association or its Grand Boulevard branch. Special\r\nreference was made at various times and in scathing terms to dealers who\r\ndeclined to affiliate. At the meeting of the Grand Boulevard district\r\non January 19, 1920, it was reported that the Executive Committee of\r\nthe parent association had succeeded during the previous two or three\r\nmonths in educating real estate men. \"The colored man,\" a speaker said,\r\n\"would have never been in this district had not our real estate men in\r\ntheir ambition to acquire wealth and commissions, which is perfectly\r\nlegitimate, put them here, although this action on their part has been\r\nvery shortsighted, as some of them now admit.\" This speaker said also\r\nthat the Association's \"greatest successes\" had been in getting all but\r\nfive or six of the real estate men to sign a pledge not to show or rent\r\nor sell any property \"within our locality that we claim jurisdiction of\r\nin the future to colored people.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PROPORTION OF NEGROES TO TOTAL POPULATION 1920\r\n   DATA OBTAINED FROM FEDERAL CENSUS]\r\n\r\nThe _Property Owners' Journal_ exerted no little influence in the creation\r\nof this sentiment. Claiming a wide circulation, its utterances were so\r\nextreme in bitterness against Negroes that many of the residents of the\r\ndistrict, although opposed to the coming in of Negroes, held aloof from\r\nthe organization because they could not indorse appeals to race hatred\r\nand advocacy of measures which they felt were illegal and dangerously\r\nnear to violence. These extracts are from its issue of December 13, 1919:\r\n\r\n     To damage a man's property and destroy its value is to rob him.\r\n     The person who commits that act is a robber. Every owner has\r\n     the right to defend his property to the utmost of his ability\r\n     with every means at his disposal.\r\n\r\n     Any property owner who sells property anywhere in our district\r\n     to undesirables is an enemy to the white owner and should be\r\n     discovered and punished.\r\n\r\n     Protect your property!\r\n\r\n     Property conservatively valued at $50,000,000 owned by some\r\n     10,000 individuals is menaced by a possible Negro invasion of\r\n     Hyde Park. The thing is simply impossible and must not occur.\r\n\r\nThese are from its issue of January 1, 1920:\r\n\r\n     As stated before, every colored man who moves into Hyde Park\r\n     knows that he is damaging his white neighbors' property.\r\n     Therefore, he is making war on the white man. Consequently, he\r\n     is not entitled to any consideration and forfeits his right\r\n     to be employed by the white man. If employers should adopt a\r\n     rule of refusing to employ Negroes who persist in residing in\r\n     Hyde Park to the damage of the white man's property, it would\r\n     soon show good results.\r\n\r\n     The Negro is using the Constitution and its legal rights to\r\n     abuse the moral rights of the white.\r\n\r\nThis is from its issue of February 15, 1920:\r\n\r\n     There is nothing in the make-up of a Negro, physically or\r\n     mentally, which should induce anyone to welcome him as a\r\n     neighbor. The best of them are insanitary, insurance companies\r\n     class them as poor risks, ruin alone follows in their path. They\r\n     are as proud as peacocks, but have nothing of the peacock's\r\n     beauty. Certain classes of the Negroes, such as the Pullman\r\n     porters, political heelers and hairdressers are clamoring\r\n     for equality. They are not content with remaining with the\r\n     creditable members of their race, they seem to want to mingle\r\n     with the whites. Their inordinate vanity, their desire to\r\n     shine as social lights caused them to stray out of their paths\r\n     and lose themselves. We who would direct them back where\r\n     they belong, towards their people, are censured and called\r\n     \"unjust.\" Far more unjust are their actions to the members\r\n     of their race who have no desire to interfere with the homes\r\n     of the white citizens of this district. The great majority of\r\n     the Negroes are not stirred by any false ambition that results\r\n     only in discord. Wherever friction arises between the races,\r\n     the suffering is usually endured by the innocent. If these\r\n     misleaders are sincere in their protestations of injustice,\r\n     if they are not hypocritical in their pretence of solving the\r\n     race question, let them move. Their actions savour of spite\r\n     against the whites, whose good will can never be attained by\r\n     such tactics. The place for a Negro aristocrat is in a Negro\r\n     neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn the same issue, under the heading _Caveat Vendor_ (Let the Seller\r\nBeware) appeared the following:\r\n\r\n     People who sell their property to Negroes and take first and\r\n     second mortgages and promises to pay monthly sums do not know\r\n     what risks they are taking in trying to collect the money. Mrs.\r\n     Nora Foster of 4207 Prairie sold her house to some niggers and\r\n     when she went to collect she was assaulted and thrown down a\r\n     flight of stairs. This is not a case of saying it served her\r\n     right because more than seven of her neighbors sold before\r\n     Mrs. Foster did, but it does serve as a splendid example of\r\n     the fact that niggers are undesirable neighbors and entirely\r\n     irresponsible and vicious.\r\n\r\n     The Negroes' innate desire to \"flash,\" to live in the present,\r\n     not reckoning the future, their inordinate love for display\r\n     has resulted in their being misled by the example of such\r\n     individuals as Jesse Binga and Oscar De Priest. In their loud\r\n     mouthing about equality with the whites they have wormed their\r\n     course into white neighborhoods, where they are not wanted\r\n     and where they have not the means to support property.\r\n\r\n     Keep the Negro in his place, amongst his people and he is\r\n     healthy and loyal. Remove him, or allow his newly discovered\r\n     importance to remove him from his proper environment and the\r\n     Negro becomes a nuisance. He develops into an overbearing,\r\n     inflated, irascible individual, overburdening his brain to such\r\n     an extent about social equality, that he becomes dangerous to\r\n     all with whom he comes in contact, he constitutes a nuisance,\r\n     of which the neighborhood is anxious to rid itself.\r\n\r\n     Another building which has been polluted by Negro tenancy is\r\n     to be renovated on May 1st.... Either the Negro must vanish\r\n     or decay sets in. Who is next?\r\n\r\n     Misleaders of the Negro, those flamboyant, noisy, witless\r\n     individuals, who, by power of superior gall and gumption, have\r\n     blustered their way into positions of prominence amongst their\r\n     people, wonder why this district resents their intrusion. To\r\n     allow themselves an opportunity to parade their dusky persons\r\n     before an audience of their followers, these misleaders held\r\n     a meeting of the Protective Circle (composed, no doubt, of\r\n     Negro roundheads), at which a varied assortment of Negro\r\n     preachers, politicians and other what nots exposed our methods\r\n     and organization work. With much comical oratory, they dangled\r\n     our association before the spellbound eyes of their sable\r\n     dupes and after extreme fuming and sweating appointed about\r\n     fifteen committees to annihilate all Hyde Parkers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BOMBINGS\r\n\r\nA form of organized resistance to the coming of Negroes into new\r\nneighborhoods was the bombings of their homes and the homes of real\r\nestate men, white and Negro, who were known or supposed to have sold,\r\nleased, or rented local property to them.\r\n\r\nFrom July 1, 1917, to March 1, 1921, the Negro housing problem was marked\r\nby fifty-eight bomb explosions. Two persons, both Negroes, were killed,\r\na number of white and colored persons were injured, and the damage to\r\nproperty amounted to more than $100,000. Of these fifty-eight bombs,\r\nthirty-two were exploded within the square bounded by Forty-first and\r\nSixtieth streets, Cottage Grove Avenue and State Street. With an average\r\nof one race bombing every twenty days for three years and eight months,\r\nthe police and the state's attorney's office succeeded in apprehending but\r\ntwo persons suspected of participation in these acts of lawlessness. One\r\nof these, James Macheval, arrested on the complaint of C. S. Absteson,\r\na janitor, was released on a $500 bond. At the writing of this report,\r\none year after the arrest, there has been no trial. Another man was\r\napprehended, questioned, held under surveillance for two days by the\r\npolice, and finally released.\r\n\r\nNews of threatened bombings in many cases was circulated well in advance\r\nof the actual occurrence. Negroes were warned of the exact date on which\r\nexplosions would occur. They asked for police protection, and, in some\r\ninstances where police were sent beforehand, their homes were bombed,\r\nand no arrests were made.\r\n\r\nThe persons directing these bombings did not limit their intimidations to\r\nNegro residents in white neighborhoods; residences of Negroes and white\r\nreal estate men were bombed because they had sold or rented property in\r\nthese exclusive areas to Negroes, and Negro bankers' houses were bombed\r\nbecause they made loans on Negro property and supported their mortgages.\r\n\r\nThese bombings increased rapidly in frequency and damaging effect. The\r\nsix months' period ended October 1, 1920, witnessed as many bombings\r\nas the entire thirty-five months preceding. Prior to 1919 there were\r\ntwelve bombings. Four of these were directed at properties merely held\r\nby Negro real estate men as agents, two of them in Berkeley Avenue just\r\nnorth of Forty-third Street, and near the lake. Five were in the 4500\r\nblock on Vincennes Avenue, two at 4200 Wabash Avenue, and one at 4732\r\nIndiana Avenue.\r\n\r\nBombing of real estate men's properties appears to have been part of a\r\ngeneral scheme to close the channels through which the invasion proceeded\r\nrather than a protest of neighbors. The four explosions in the 4500\r\nblock on Vincennes Avenue appear to have been deliberately aimed at the\r\ntenants. This block is at the center of the neighborhood most actively\r\nopposed to the coming in of Negroes. In January, 1919, a white and a\r\nNegro real estate agent were bombed; in March, Jesse Binga's real estate\r\noffice at 4724 State Street and an apartment at 4041 Calumet Avenue were\r\nbombed. In April there were two more bombings, one of a realty office.\r\nFollowing a public meeting on May 5 to arouse white property owners of\r\nthe Hyde Park district against Negro invasion, there were four bombings.\r\nBetween January 1, 1920, and March 1, 1920, there were eight bombings\r\nin eight weeks. Responsibility for the creation of the sentiment thus\r\nexpressed was in some instances assumed by organizations. For example\r\nthe _Property Owners' Journal_, in its issue for February 1, 1920, said:\r\n\r\n     Our neighborhood must continue white. This sentiment is the\r\n     outgrowth of the mass meeting of property owners and residents\r\n     which was held Monday, January 19. Mr. George J. Williams\r\n     furnished the climax of the meeting when he informed the\r\n     audience in terse, pithy language that \"Hyde Park enjoys a\r\n     reputation too splendid as a neighborhood of white culture to\r\n     allow Negroes to use it as their door mat.\"\r\n\r\nIn the issue of December 13, 1919, white and Negro real estate men and\r\nowners selling property to Negroes in the district were \"branded as\r\nunclean outcasts of society to be boycotted and ostracized in every\r\npossible manner,\" and W. B. Austin, white, was accused of violating a\r\ngentleman's obligation to his community in selling a home to a Negro.\r\nIt was asserted falsely that the house which he had sold had been used\r\nduring the race riots as a \"rendezvous for Negroes who fired volleys of\r\nrevolver shots from doors and windows at white boys in the street who,\r\naccording to the testimony of neighbors, had not attacked the premises.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 26 the home of J. H. Coleman, a white real estate man who\r\nhad sold a house to a Negro, was bombed. The transaction was not public,\r\nand occupancy was not to take place for five months. On December 27\r\nthe home of Jesse Binga, a Negro real estate man, was bombed. One week\r\nlater, on January 6, came the bombing of W. B. Austin, on the North Side.\r\n\r\nDuring 1919 and 1920 committees and delegations of whites and Negroes\r\nappealed to the chief of police, the mayor, State's Attorney Hoyne, and\r\nthe press, but nothing was done. The mayor referred these matters to his\r\nchief of police. The police were unable to discover the bombers or anyone\r\ndirecting them. The state's attorney, in response to appeals, emphatically\r\ndefined his duty as a prosecuting rather than an apprehending agent. All\r\nthe while, however, the bombings continued steadily; no arrests except\r\nthe two mentioned were made; and the Negro population grew to trust less\r\nand less in the interest of the community and the public agencies of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. TYPICAL BOMBINGS\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the bombings were investigated by the Commission,\r\nand details of what happened in several typical cases are here presented.\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of the Motley home._--In 1913 S. P. Motley, Negro,\r\n     and his wife purchased a building at 5230 Maryland Avenue\r\n     through a white agent, and on March 15, 1913, the family moved\r\n     in. For four years they lived there without molestation save\r\n     the silent resentment of neighbors and open objection to the\r\n     presence of Negro children in the streets. On July 1, 1917,\r\n     without warning or threat, a bomb was exploded in the vestibule\r\n     of the house, and the front of the building was blown away.\r\n     The damage amounted to $1,000. Police arrived from the station\r\n     at Fifty-second Street and Lake Park Avenue ten minutes after\r\n     the explosion. No clews were found and no arrests were made.\r\n     The original owner of the building was bitterly opposed to\r\n     Negroes and was a member of an organization which was seeking\r\n     to keep Negroes out of the district.\r\n\r\n     Some time after this incident it was rumored that Motley was\r\n     planning to purchase the building adjacent. At 4:00 A.M. June\r\n     4, 1919, a dynamite bomb was exploded under the front of the\r\n     house adjacent and tore up its stone front. The neighbors\r\n     were in the street immediately after the explosion. No clews\r\n     were found and no arrests were made. The Motley family on\r\n     this occasion was accused of inviting another Negro family\r\n     into the block. The new family in question negotiated for its\r\n     own property, and before an actual settlement had been made,\r\n     received numerous telephone messages and threats. It moved\r\n     in, but was not bombed.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: HOMES BOMBED IN RACE CONFLICTS OVER HOUSING\r\n        JULY 1, 1917-MARCH 1, 1921]\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of Moses Fox's home._--Moses Fox, white, connected\r\n     with a \"Loop\" real estate firm, lived at 442 East Forty-fifth\r\n     Street. The house was too large, and he decided to move to\r\n     smaller quarters. The building was sold through a real estate\r\n     firm to persons whom he did not know. On March 10, 1920, a few\r\n     days after the sale, he received a telephone call informing\r\n     him that he must suffer the consequences of selling his home to\r\n     Negroes. At 7:30 that evening an automobile was seen to drive\r\n     slowly past his home three times, stopping each time just east\r\n     of the building. On the last trip a man alighted, and deposited\r\n     a long-fuse bomb in the vestibule. The fuse smoked for four\r\n     minutes. Attracted by the smoke, Fox ran toward the front of\r\n     the house. The bomb exploded before he reached the door. It was\r\n     loaded with dynamite and contained slugs which penetrated the\r\n     windows of buildings across the street. The evening selected\r\n     for the bombing was the one on which Patrolman Edward Owens,\r\n     Negro, was off duty and a white policeman was patrolling his\r\n     beat. The bombing was witnessed by Dan Jones, a Negro janitor,\r\n     and Mrs. Florence De Lavalade, a Negro tenant. The front of\r\n     the building was wrecked and all the windows shattered. Damage\r\n     amounting to $1,000 was done. No arrests were made.\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of Jesse Binga's properties._--Jesse Binga is a Negro\r\n     banker and real estate man. His bank is at 3633 State Street,\r\n     his real estate office at 4724 State Street, and his home at\r\n     5922 South Park Avenue. He controls more than $500,000 worth of\r\n     property and through his bank has made loans on Negro property\r\n     and taken over the mortgages of Negroes refused by other banks\r\n     and loan agencies.\r\n\r\n     On November 12, 1919, an automobile rolled by his realty office\r\n     and a bomb was tossed from it. It left the office in ruins.\r\n     The police were soon on the scene, but the car was well beyond\r\n     reach by the time of their arrival. No clews to the bombers\r\n     were found, and no arrests were made. It was the opinion of\r\n     the police that white residents of the Hyde Park district\r\n     resented Binga's handling of Negro property in that district.\r\n\r\n     Twenty-one days later an automobile drew up in front of Binga's\r\n     home at 5922 South Park Avenue, and its occupants put a bomb\r\n     under the front steps. It failed to explode. When the firemen\r\n     arrived they found it sizzling in the slush beneath the porch.\r\n     The police declared that this was an expression of racial\r\n     feeling.\r\n\r\n     Twenty-five days later the bombers reappeared and left a third\r\n     bomb. It tore up the porch of Binga's home. Again the police\r\n     found that the explosion had been caused by \"racial feeling,\"\r\n     white men having said that \"Binga rented too many flats to\r\n     Negroes in high-class residence districts.\" The house was\r\n     repaired and police provided to guard the house. At twelve\r\n     o'clock each night the guard changed watch. On the night of\r\n     February 28 the policeman on duty until twelve o'clock left\r\n     a few minutes early, and the policeman relieving him was just\r\n     a few minutes late. In this unguarded interval an automobile\r\n     swung around the corner, and as it passed the Binga home a man\r\n     leaned out and tossed a bomb into the yard. The bomb lit in a\r\n     puddle of water and the fuse went out. It was found that the\r\n     bomb had been made of black powder, manila paper, and cotton.\r\n     The explanation of the attempt was that \"his $30,000 home is\r\n     in a white neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n     A police guard was still watching the house on the night of\r\n     June 18, 1920 when the bombing car appeared again. On this\r\n     occasion neither policeman was in sight when the car drew up.\r\n     A man alighted this time and carefully placed the bomb. The\r\n     explosion that followed almost demolished the front of the house\r\n     and smashed windows throughout the block. This last explosion\r\n     damaged the home to the extent of $4,000. Binga offered a\r\n     reward of $1,000 for the apprehension of those guilty of these\r\n     repeated acts of lawlessness.\r\n\r\n     On November 23 Binga was bombed again. This time the bomb\r\n     damaged his neighbors more seriously than it did Binga's\r\n     property. No clews were found and no one was arrested.\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of R. W. Woodfolk's home._--R. W. Woodfolk, Negro\r\n     banker and real estate dealer, purchased a flat at 4722 Calumet\r\n     Avenue. It was an investment of the Merchants and Peoples'\r\n     Bank, 3201 South State Street, which he controlled. The\r\n     building was occupied by one white and four Negro families.\r\n     On the evening of February 1, 1920, a person with keys to the\r\n     building locked the tenants in their apartments, sprung the\r\n     locks of the doors leading to the street, and planted a bomb\r\n     in the hallway. The explosion ripped up the hall and stairway,\r\n     tore away the brick work around the entrance, and shattered\r\n     the windows of adjacent buildings. The damage was estimated\r\n     at $1,000. No arrests were made.\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of the Clarke home._--Mrs. Mary Byron Clarke, Negro,\r\n     purchased through W. B. Austin, a white banker and real estate\r\n     man, properties at 4404 and 4406 Grand Boulevard, vacant\r\n     for a year at the time of purchase, and previously used by\r\n     prostitutes. A real estate dealer herself, she had frequently\r\n     been assisted by Austin in financing her transactions, one\r\n     of which was the sale to Negroes of Isaiah Temple, a Jewish\r\n     synagogue at Forty-fifth Street and Vincennes Avenue.\r\n\r\n     The dwellings were renovated and she moved into one of them;\r\n     the other she rented. During the riot of July, 1919, her home\r\n     was attacked by a mob. When the police arrived in response to a\r\n     call by the Clarkes, they battered in the doors at the demand of\r\n     the mob and arrested Mr. and Mrs. Clarke. They were acquitted.\r\n     On January 5, 1920, the house was bombed. The explosion caused\r\n     $3,360 worth of damage. The building was again bombed February\r\n     12, 1920, this time with a dynamite bomb thrown through the\r\n     plate-glass door in the hallway from a passing automobile. The\r\n     stairway was knocked down and large holes blown in the wall.\r\n     The police came, found no clews, and made no arrests. At the\r\n     request of Mrs. Clarke a special policeman was detailed to\r\n     guard the property.\r\n\r\n     Numerous threatening letters and telephone calls followed,\r\n     all of which were reported to the police. There were threats\r\n     of another bombing if she did not sell, and there were visits\r\n     from representatives of real estate interests in Hyde Park\r\n     making offers.\r\n\r\n     Tuesday evening, April 13, 1920, a third bomb was exploded\r\n     in spite of the presence of the two special policemen. The\r\n     bomb was thrown from the premises of Frederick R. Barnheisel,\r\n     an immediate neighbor, a telephone wire deflected it, and it\r\n     landed near the Clarke garage.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Clarke made a statement concerning this bombing before\r\n     the Commission in which she said:\r\n\r\n     \"Wednesday [the day following the third bombing] we got a\r\n     letter saying 'move out or sell, there is nothing else for\r\n     you to do. We missed you last night but we will get you the\r\n     next time. We are determined.' A letter prior to that stated\r\n     if we did not get out they would 'get our hides.'\r\n\r\n     \"There has been some sinister influence brought to bear on the\r\n     insurance company since the riot and since the first bombing.\r\n     We have had our house insured against bombing since the first\r\n     bombing. The first damage of about $500 they paid and canceled\r\n     the insurance on 4404 Grand Boulevard. The second bomb did\r\n     damage to the extent of $3,360. They wrote saying they would\r\n     cancel it, subject however to pending loss. There was a clause\r\n     calling for settlement within sixty days. After sixty days\r\n     we would have to enter suit to get it. The sixty days have\r\n     passed, and there has been no attempt to settle. Some of the\r\n     glass has been replaced. They have accepted it, and there has\r\n     been no disposition on their part to settle.\r\n\r\n     \"Berry, Johnston, & Peters, the men with whom we have had the\r\n     most business dealings, have insisted that we sell the place.\r\n     Mr. Peters said last week he could get a buyer from the Hyde\r\n     Park-Kenwood Association people, also said if any indebtedness\r\n     remained on the contract or deeds, that the money must first\r\n     be paid to them, then to us. We have been careful not to let\r\n     any indebtedness, even for ten days, come against 4406.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of Crede Hubbard's home._--Following is part of\r\n     Hubbard's statement to the police immediately after the bombing\r\n     of his home at 4331 Vincennes Avenue on the night of April\r\n     25, 1920:\r\n\r\n     \"The day on which I had planned to move, a man who said he was\r\n     Mr. Day, of the Hyde Park and Kenwood Association, telephoned\r\n     me. He said: 'I hear you have acquired property and you are\r\n     dissatisfied with it; we can take it off your hands--relieve\r\n     you of it.' I replied that I didn't think I needed any help. He\r\n     asked, 'What do you expect to do?' I said, 'I expect to move\r\n     into it or sell it if I can get my price.' I moved on Tuesday\r\n     and Wednesday he called in person. He said, 'I called to find\r\n     out if you want us to sell or handle your property for you.'\r\n     I told him I thought I could handle it, and that I was not\r\n     anxious to sell but would consider selling if I could get an\r\n     offer of say $11,000. He replied that his buyers were not able\r\n     to go that far. He continued, 'The point is, I represent the\r\n     Hyde Park-Kenwood Association. We have spent a lot of money\r\n     and we want to keep this district white.' I asked him why they\r\n     had not thought of buying the property before and told him\r\n     that the house had been for sale for eight months. He replied\r\n     that it was a lamentable fact that they had overlooked it. I\r\n     told him that I heard the Hyde Park Association had a $100,000\r\n     slush fund out of which $100 was paid for each bombing. He\r\n     said he would have some of his buyers come in and look over the\r\n     property. Shortly afterward, Mr. Stephen D. Seman and another\r\n     man came and represented themselves as buyers. They looked\r\n     over the inside of the house. I only carried them through the\r\n     halls. Mr. Seman said, 'You only paid $8,500 for this property.'\r\n     I told him that he had been misinformed, I had paid $9,000.\r\n     He said, 'I will give you $9,500 for it.' I refused. As they\r\n     were leaving he added, 'You had better consider our offer.'\r\n     Soon after that a man named Casson, real estate man, called.\r\n     I would not let him in. When he asked me my price I told him\r\n     $11,500.\r\n\r\n     \"A week later a delegation from the Hyde Park Association\r\n     called. The spokesman began: 'I am Mr. Austin. You understand\r\n     the nature of our business with you, I suppose.' ... I told\r\n     the chief clerk of the office of the Northwestern Railroad to\r\n     inform you that we were coming to see you. We are the Hyde\r\n     Park-Kenwood Association and you will understand that you\r\n     are not welcome in this district. We want to know what can be\r\n     done.' I replied that I didn't know what could be done unless\r\n     they wanted to buy; otherwise I expected to live there, and my\r\n     price was $11,500. They continued, 'Do you suppose if I moved\r\n     into a black district where I wasn't wanted, that I would want\r\n     to live there?' I said, 'If you had bought property there and\r\n     liked the property, I don't see why you should move.' They\r\n     said, 'Why do you persist in wanting to live here when you\r\n     know you are not wanted?' I said, 'I have bought property here\r\n     and I am expecting to live here.' Then they filed out of the\r\n     door, and one of the members stated, 'You had better consider\r\n     this proposition.'\r\n\r\n     \"In the office of the Northwestern Railroad, Mr. Shirley called\r\n     me in and read a letter to me which he had received from Mr.\r\n     Austin. 'Murphy, his name is,' he said, 'I know him fairly\r\n     well, and I simply want to make an answer to the letter. Don't\r\n     think I am trying to influence you one way or the other. This\r\n     is the letter: it goes about like this: \"Crede Hubbard has\r\n     purchased a three-flat building at 4332 Vincennes Avenue.\r\n     Property values are always shot to hell when Negroes move in.\r\n     Use whatever influence you have to induce him to sell and find\r\n     out for us his lowest figures.\"' He added, 'Don't think I am\r\n     trying to brow-beat you into selling this property.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"On the following Sunday night on my way back to Milwaukee, I\r\n     read in the paper that my house had been bombed. My family was\r\n     at home, my two boys sleeping about ten feet from the place\r\n     that was most seriously damaged. The bomb was placed inside\r\n     the vestibule. The girl there heard a taxicab drive up about\r\n     twenty-five minutes to twelve and stop for a few minutes and\r\n     start off again. About six minutes after the taxicab stopped,\r\n     the explosion came, and in about five minutes there were\r\n     not less than 300 people on the street in front of the place\r\n     asking questions. There were a number of plain-clothes men\r\n     in the crowd. I told my story to the chief of police and to a\r\n     sergeant of the police and they said it was evidence enough to\r\n     warrant the arrest of the officials of the Association named,\r\n     but they also thought that it would do no good.... 'The thing\r\n     we will have to do is to catch somebody in the act, sweat him\r\n     and make him tell who his backers are.'\r\n\r\n     \"The police believe that the actual bombing is being done by\r\n     a gang of young rough-necks who will stop at nothing, and they\r\n     expect a pretty serious encounter if they are interfered with.\r\n     A big automobile is being shadowed now by the police. It is\r\n     used by this bunch of young fellows under suspicion, and it is\r\n     thought that they keep the car well loaded with ammunition,\r\n     and whoever attacks them must expect trouble. There are four\r\n     plain-clothes men on guard in this district now. The police\r\n     told me to get anything I want from a Mauser to a machine\r\n     gun and sit back in the dark, and when anybody comes up to my\r\n     hallway acting suspiciously to crack down on him and ask him\r\n     what he was there for afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bombing of the Harrison home._--Mrs. Gertrude Harrison, Negro,\r\n     living alone with her children, contracted to buy a house\r\n     at 4708 Grand Boulevard. In March, 1919, she moved in. She\r\n     immediately received word that she had committed a grave error.\r\n     She and her children were constantly subjected to the insulting\r\n     remarks both of her immediate neighbors and passers-by.\r\n\r\n     On May 16, 1919, a Negro janitor informed her that neighbors\r\n     were planning to bomb her house. She called up the Forty-eighth\r\n     Street police station and told of the threatened danger. The\r\n     officer answering the telephone characterized her report as\r\n     \"idle talk\" and promised to send a man to investigate. The\r\n     regular patrolman came in and promised to \"keep an eye on the\r\n     property,\" but there were ten blocks in his beat. A special\r\n     guard was secured and paid by Mrs. Harrison when it was learned\r\n     that one would not be furnished by the police.\r\n\r\n     The following night, May 17, her house was bombed while the\r\n     patrolman was \"punching his box\" two blocks away and the special\r\n     watchman was at the rear. A detail of police was then provided\r\n     both at the front and rear. The following night a bomb was\r\n     thrown on the roof of the house from the window of a vacant\r\n     flat in the adjoining apartment house. The flat from which\r\n     the bomb was thrown had been unlocked to admit the bombers and\r\n     locked again. The police failed to question either the persons\r\n     living in the apartment or those leaving it immediately after\r\n     the explosion.\r\n\r\n     The first explosion blew out the front door and shattered\r\n     the glass in the front of the house. The bomb was filled with\r\n     gravel and bits of lead. The second was of similar character,\r\n     but did not do as much damage. No arrests were made.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DAMAGE DONE BY A BOMB\r\n   This bomb was thrown into a building at 3365 Indiana Avenue, occupied\r\n   by Negroes. A six-year-old Negro child was killed.]\r\n\r\nIn all these fifty-eight bombings the police have been able to accomplish\r\nnothing definite. Practically every incident involved an automobile,\r\ndescriptions of which were furnished by witnesses. The precautions taken\r\nto prevent bombings, even if they were well planned and systematically\r\ncarried out, failed lamentably.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. REACTION OF WHITES IN HYDE PARK\r\n\r\nIncreasing frequency of bombings, failure of the police to make arrests,\r\nand the apparent association of these acts of open violence with the\r\nwhite residents of Hyde Park drew out explanations.\r\n\r\nPastors of churches in the district who, it had been charged, helped\r\nto give circulation to printed sentiments of the organized opposition\r\nto the \"invasion\" were strong in their repudiation. The menace to law\r\nand order was definitely recognized and the public given to understand\r\nthat neither the pastor nor his congregation had encouraged acts of\r\nlawlessness in any manner. In a statement to a Commission investigator,\r\none of these pastors said, \"I am not in sympathy with the methods and\r\nam very doubtful about the aims of the Property Owners' Association and\r\nhave, therefore, been unable to join them or indorse their efforts.\"\r\n\r\nA local paper, the _Real Estate News_, published a long article in\r\nFebruary, 1920, on \"Solving Chicago's Race Problem.\" It was directed at\r\nSouth Side property owners and carried a stern warning \"against perils of\r\nboycott and terrorism being promoted by local protective associations.\"\r\nReferring to the bombing outrages, this paper, under the heading \"Danger\r\nin Boycotts and Bombs,\" said:\r\n\r\n     In Kenwood and Hyde Park, particularly, a number of \"protective\r\n     associations\" have been formed. Property owners have been urged\r\n     to join these bodies, which, without attempt at concealment,\r\n     advocate a boycott against all persons of a certain race.\r\n     At meetings of these groups there has been open advocacy of\r\n     violence. There has been incendiary talk. Bombs and bullets\r\n     have been discussed, and speakers talking thus have been\r\n     applauded. There have been repeated acts of violence. Night\r\n     bombing of Negro homes and apartments has taken place. Bombing\r\n     and shooting is increasing in frequency.\r\n\r\n     The time has come, we believe, for a word of solemn warning\r\n     to all South Side property owners. It is: Keep out of those\r\n     associations. If you are now in, get out! For you are in great\r\n     danger of the penitentiary! You are in grave peril of losing\r\n     your property by damage suits!\r\n\r\nAnother excerpt, under the heading \"Perils of 'Protective' Organizations,\"\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     No one can justly criticize men for forming organizations\r\n     to protect or advance their own interests lawfully. Property\r\n     owners ought to unite wherever practicable for proper and lawful\r\n     purposes beneficial to themselves. For such unions operate to\r\n     the welfare of all.\r\n\r\n     Recently, however, a number of men have joined in forming and\r\n     promoting organizations on the South Side which are perilous to\r\n     themselves and to every property owner who joins them. Owners\r\n     of real estate should be the last men in the world to get mixed\r\n     up in movements involving violence, threats, intimidations,\r\n     or boycotts. Because they are responsible. Their wealth cannot\r\n     be concealed. Judgments against them are collectible.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading \"Drastic Laws Forbid Conspiracies\":\r\n\r\n     The law of conspiracy is drastic. Conspiracy is an association\r\n     together of persons for the purpose of doing an unlawful thing\r\n     in an unlawful way, or a lawful thing in an unlawful way, or\r\n     an unlawful thing in a lawful way. Under the law, all persons\r\n     in a conspiracy are equally guilty. One need not throw a bomb,\r\n     or even know of the intent of throwing a bomb, to be found\r\n     guilty. The act of one, no matter how irresponsible, is the\r\n     act of all.\r\n\r\n     Any association formed in Chicago for the purpose of, or having\r\n     among its aims, refusal to sell, lease or rent property to any\r\n     citizen of a certain race, is an unlawful association. Every\r\n     act of such an association for advancement of such an aim is\r\n     an act of conspiracy, punishable criminally and civilly in\r\n     the District Court of the United States. And every member of\r\n     such an association is equally guilty with every other member.\r\n     If one member hires a bomber, or a thug who commits murder in\r\n     pursuance of the aims of the association, all the organization\r\n     may be found guilty of conspiracy to destroy property or to\r\n     commit murder, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThis entire article was widely circulated in the disturbed neighborhoods\r\nby the Protective Circle, an organization of Negroes, 25,000 copies\r\nbeing mailed to residents of Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nResidents of the district, stirred by the succession of bombings, began\r\nto protest. The paper of the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'\r\nAssociation reflected this feeling in a statement declaring that the\r\nAssociation had no connection with the bombings, and that its president\r\nwas considering the advisability of assisting the authorities in\r\napprehending these lawless individuals. On another occasion, this paper\r\ntook pains to explain that the bombing of George A. Hyers' property\r\non March 5 was an outgrowth of labor troubles and not of a property\r\nowners' organization recently formed in this community. At a meeting of\r\nthe General Committee of the Property Owners' Association the following\r\nresolution was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Our attention has been called to various explosions\r\n     of bombs in our neighborhood at the houses of colored people\r\n     living in this vicinity, and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, While we are anxious to persuade these people to\r\n     move from this locality, we are opposed to violence of every\r\n     description, therefore, be it\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we condemn the action of anyone resorting\r\n     to throwing of bombs or other methods not in accordance with\r\n     reason, law or justice.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the city was directed to these unlawful happenings and\r\nprotests from both white and Negro individuals made themselves heard. The\r\nbombings, however, did not abate in frequency. Neither were the police\r\nany more successful in locating their sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. REACTION OF NEGROES\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Negroes were outspoken in their indignation over\r\nthe bombings, but their protests had no apparent effect in checking the\r\noutrages.\r\n\r\nThe attacks, however, have made the Negroes firm in their stand. Mrs.\r\nClarke was bombed four times; she still lives in the property and declares\r\nthat she will not be driven out. Jesse Binga has been bombed six times\r\nbut states he will not move. Only two of the forty Negro families bombed\r\nhave moved; the others have made repairs, secured private watchmen or\r\nthemselves kept vigil for night bombers, and still occupy the properties.\r\n\r\nFollowing the bombing of Jesse Binga on June 18, 1920, the _Chicago\r\nDaily News_ quoted him as saying to a policeman, \"This is the limit;\r\nI'm going.\" When his attention was called to the statement he promptly\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n     Statements relative to my moving are all false. My idea of\r\n     this bombing of my house is that it is an effort to retard the\r\n     Binga State Bank which will take over the mortgages of colored\r\n     people now buying property against which effort is being made\r\n     to foreclose. I will not run. The race is at stake and not\r\n     myself. If they can make me move they will have accomplished\r\n     much of their aim because they can say, \"We made Jesse Binga\r\n     move; certainly you'll have to move,\" to all of the rest. If\r\n     they can make the leaders move, what show will the smaller\r\n     buyers have? Such headlines are efforts to intimidate Negroes\r\n     not to purchase property and to scare some of them back South.\r\n\r\nIn February a group of Negroes formed themselves into a body known as\r\nthe Protective Circle of Chicago, the purpose of which, as stated in its\r\nconstitution, was \"to combat, through legal means, the lawlessness of\r\nthe Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association and by organized\r\neffort to bring pressure to bear on city authorities to force them to\r\napprehend those persons who have bombed the homes of twenty-one Negroes.\"\r\n\r\nA mass meeting was held February 29, 1920, with 3,000 Negroes present.\r\nA popular appeal for funds for the purposes of this organization raised\r\n$1,000. Attacks were directed against the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property\r\nOwners' Association. A representative of the Protective Circle said in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     The Hyde Park Property Owners' Association is not a new thing.\r\n     It is more than eighteen years old. Eighteen years ago they\r\n     proposed fourteen points as a platform for their Association.\r\n     The thirteenth point was that they would keep out undesirables.\r\n     All Negroes were classed as undesirables. Ten years ago Dr.\r\n     Jenifer, a Negro minister, appeared before the Association\r\n     and severely criticized the organization for its un-American\r\n     policies. It is just recently that this organization has shown\r\n     its hand openly, and the things that they have said and done\r\n     are dangerously near to illegality. I have in my files this\r\n     statement taken from a stenographic report of one of their\r\n     meetings, made by the president of the Association: \"If Negroes\r\n     do not get out of Hyde Park, we will get Bolsheviks to bomb them\r\n     out.\" The bombers of the homes of Negroes have been allowed to\r\n     get away unpunished. Judge Gary hanged numbers of anarchists\r\n     in the Haymarket riot for very much less complicity in bomb\r\n     outrages than these men are guilty of. Hatred can never be\r\n     counteracted by hatred. We cannot put any stop to the bombings\r\n     of Negro homes by going out and bombing homes of white persons.\r\n\r\nThe Negro press severely condemned the bombings, and the Negro population\r\nin general felt that the apathy of city authorities and even the\r\ninfluential public was responsible for continuance of the outrages.\r\nProtests were sent to the governor of the state. The mayor, chief of\r\npolice, and state's attorney were persistently importuned to stop the\r\ndestruction of Negroes' property and remove the menace to their lives.\r\nNegroes pointed out, for example, that the authorities had shown ability\r\nto apprehend criminals, even those suspected of bomb-throwing. They cited\r\nthe bombing of the home of a professional white \"gunman,\" when eleven\r\nsuspected bombers were caught in the dragnet of the state's attorney\r\nwithin thirty hours. Yet in fifty-eight bombings of Negro homes only\r\ntwo suspects were ever arrested.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1920, a Commission from the Chicago Church Federation Council\r\nsent a delegation to Mayor Thompson, Chief of Police Garrity, and\r\nState's Attorney Hoyne, to demand action on the bombing of Negroes'\r\nhomes. Prominent white and colored men comprised this delegation. A\r\nprominent Negro, testifying before the Commission, said that he, with\r\nother Negroes, both from the local branch of the National Association\r\nfor the Advancement of Colored People, and from other organizations,\r\nhad carried their grievances to city officials. He said:\r\n\r\n     We have been to the mayor's office, we have been to the state's\r\n     attorney's office, we have sent representatives to both these\r\n     offices, and nothing has been done--possibly something is being\r\n     done, but nothing of great moment. I think that the colored\r\n     people feel that they are so insecure in their physical rights\r\n     that rather than take any chance they're going out and paying\r\n     whatever the charge is for insurance against bombing.\r\n\r\nAnother delegation of Negroes in June, 1919, twice attempted to register\r\na complaint with the mayor against bomb outrages. The mayor's secretary,\r\nhowever, refused them an audience with the mayor.\r\n\r\nThe editors of local daily papers have also been visited by mixed white\r\nand Negro delegations in an endeavor to arouse public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these delegations and protests has been small. One joint\r\nconference with the mayor, chief of police, and state's attorney brought\r\nout the information that it was beyond the state's attorney's province\r\nto make arrests. The mayor, after some discussion, instructed Chief of\r\nPolice Garrity to do what he could toward putting a stop to the bombing\r\nof Negroes' homes. The chief of police, after explaining the shortage\r\nof patrolmen, said he would do so.\r\n\r\nThe bombing question began to figure in local politics. Charges were\r\nmade before the primary election of September, 1920, that the city\r\nadministration had not given Negroes the protection it had promised.\r\nThe matter of apprehending the \"nefarious bomb plotters\" was included\r\nin the platforms of Negroes running for office, and in those of white\r\ncandidates seeking Negro votes.\r\n\r\nThe Commission had neither authority nor facilities for accomplishing\r\nwhat all public agencies had signally failed to do. It could, however,\r\nand did, go over the trail of the bombers and collect information which\r\nshows that the sentiment aroused in the contested neighborhoods was a\r\nfactor in encouraging actual violence. Whatever antagonisms there were\r\nbefore the agitation were held in restraint, even though Negroes were\r\nalready neighbors. Other districts, like Woodlawn and sections of the\r\nNorth Side, undergoing almost identical experiences as those of Hyde\r\nPark, have had no violence; the absence of stimulated sentiment is as\r\nconspicuous as the absence of violence. In the Hyde Park district,\r\nbetween Thirty-ninth and Forty-seventh streets and State Street and\r\nCottage Grove Avenue, four-fifths of the bombings occurred. All but\r\nthree of those happening outside the district were against real estate\r\nmen accused of activities affecting the Hyde Park District. It seemed,\r\nespecially in the first bombings, that the bombers had information about\r\nbusiness transactions which the general public could not ordinarily get.\r\nHouses were bombed in numbers of cases long before their occupancy by\r\nNegroes. Each of the bombings was apparently planned, and the opportune\r\nmoment came after long vigil and, as it would seem, after deliberately\r\nsetting the stage. The first bombing of Binga does not appear to have\r\nbeen the result of resentment of neighbors in the vicinity of his home,\r\nfor it was his office on State Street that was bombed. His office is in\r\na neighborhood around which there is no contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. OTHER MEANS EMPLOYED TO KEEP OUT NEGROES\r\n\r\nThe Grand Boulevard Property Owners' Association officially decided\r\nthat its object should be \"the acquisition, management, improvement and\r\ndisposition, including leasing, sub-leasing and sale of residential\r\nproperty to both white and colored people within the said district\r\nheretofore described.\" This district was to include the area from\r\nThirty-fifth to Sixty-third streets, and from the Chicago and Rock Island\r\nRailroad tracks to Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1920, the manager of the Association cited an instance in\r\nwhich it had functioned. On Vernon Avenue a white man had sold property\r\ndirect to Negroes. The next-door neighbor had arranged a similar sale\r\nto potential Negro buyers. The neighbor next to him, a widow, loath to\r\nlose her home, appealed to the Association. After a conference with the\r\npossible Negro buyers, their money was returned to them, the Association\r\npurchased the house in question, and the whole matter was thus amicably\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nDuring April, 1920, inquiries were made by the Commission into the\r\nunrest caused by rumors that 800 Negro families intended to move into\r\nHyde Park. It developed that May 1, the customary \"moving day,\" was\r\nfeared both by whites in Hyde Park and by Negroes in and out of Hyde\r\nPark. Negroes living there feared that an attempt would be made to oust\r\nthem by canceling or refusing to renew their leases, and whites thought\r\nNegroes might get possession of some of the properties vacated on that\r\ndate. The Commission found, however, only eighteen instances where leases\r\nwere canceled on houses occupied by Negroes who were having difficulty\r\nin finding other places to live.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1920 the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'\r\nAssociation stated that sixty-eight Negro families had been moved through\r\ncancellation of leases and mortgage foreclosures.\r\n\r\nIncidental to the general plan of opposition to the entrance of Negroes\r\nin Hyde Park was the sending of threatening letters. For example, in\r\nAugust, 1919, a leading Negro real estate agent and banker received this\r\npen-printed notice by mail:\r\n\r\n                                    HEADQUARTERS OF THE WHITE HANDS\r\n                                TERRITORY, MICHIGAN AVE. TO LAKE FRONT\r\n\r\n     You are the one who helped cause this riot by encouraging\r\n     Negroes to move into good white neighborhoods and you know\r\n     the results of your work. This trouble has only begun and we\r\n     advise you to use your influence to get Negroes to move out of\r\n     these neighborhoods to _Black Belt_ where they belong and in\r\n     conclusion we advise you to get off South Park Ave. yourself.\r\n     Just take this as a warning. You know what comes next.\r\n\r\n                                  Respect.\r\n\r\n                                       WARNING COM.\r\n\r\nThis man's home and office have been bombed a number of times. Efforts\r\nwere made to buy out individual Negroes who had settled in the district,\r\nas well as to cause renters to move out. There are numerous incidents\r\nof this nature, with indications of many others. A Negro woman who was\r\nliving in the district, told one of the Commission's investigators that\r\nshe and her husband had formerly lived in the 3800 block of Lake Park\r\nAvenue. White neighbors caused them so much trouble that they had moved\r\nand bought the apartment house in which they are now living, renting out\r\nthe second and third flats. Almost immediately white people began to call\r\nand inquire whether she was the janitress, or whether she was renting\r\nor buying the place. When she gave evasive answers, letters began to\r\narrive by mail. One letter was slipped under the door at night. These\r\nletters informed her that she was preventing the sale of the adjoining\r\nhouse because she would not sell and no white person would live next\r\ndoor to her. She was advised that it would be best for her to answer and\r\ndeclare her intentions. Two white women called and offered her $1,500\r\nmore than she had paid for the property. She refused and a few days later\r\nshe received a letter demanding an immediate answer, to the Kenwood and\r\nHyde Park Property Owners' Association.\r\n\r\nLater three white men in overseas uniforms inquired as to the ownership\r\nof the property, asking if she was the janitress and if she knew who\r\nthe owner was. She answered in the negative. One of the men tore down\r\na \"For Sale\" sign on the adjoining property, and another informed her\r\nthat it was the intention to turn the neighborhood back to white people\r\nand that all Negroes must go.\r\n\r\nThis woman is the president of a neighborhood protective league, including\r\nthe Negroes in several of the blocks thereabouts. She received a letter\r\nfrom the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association asking the\r\npurposes and intentions of this league.\r\n\r\nThis woman also reported that a man had been going about the neighborhood\r\nunder the pretext of making calling cards, advising Negroes to sell out\r\nand leave the neighborhood, as it was better not to stay where they were\r\nnot wanted. Another white man who had been about the neighborhood selling\r\nwearing apparel, told her that two Negro families in the neighborhood\r\nwould be bombed. She inquired how he knew this and was told to wait and\r\nsee. Within two weeks these bombings had taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TREND OF THE NEGRO POPULATION\r\n\r\nIn considering the expansion of Negro residential areas, the most\r\nimportant is the main South Side section where more of the Negro\r\npopulation lives. This group is hemmed in on the north by the business\r\ndistrict and on the west by overcrowded areas west of Wentworth Avenue,\r\ncalled in this report \"hostile.\" During the ten years 1910-20 business\r\nhouses and light manufacturing plants were moving south from the downtown\r\ndistrict, pushing ahead of them the Negro population between Twelfth\r\nand Thirty-first streets. At the same time the Negro population was\r\nexpanding into the streets east of Wabash Avenue. This extension was\r\nstopped by Lake Michigan, about eight blocks east. Negro families then\r\nbegan filtering into Hyde Park, immediately to the south.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the Chicago Urban League found that Negroes were then living on\r\nWabash Avenue as far south as Fifty-fifth street east of State Street,\r\nwhere they had moved from the district west of State Street. From\r\nThirty-first to Thirty-ninth streets, on Wabash Avenue, Negroes had\r\nbeen living from nine to eleven years, and the approximate percentage\r\nof Negroes by blocks ranged from 95 to 100; from Thirty-ninth Street to\r\nForty-seventh Street they had been living from one to five years and\r\naveraged 50 per cent. The movement had been almost entirely from the\r\nwest and north.\r\n\r\nOn Indiana Avenue, from Thirty-first to Forty-second streets, a similar\r\ntrend was revealed. In the 3100 block, Negroes had been living for eight\r\nyears, in the 3200 block for fourteen years; in the more southerly blocks\r\ntheir occupancy had been much briefer, ranging down to five months. In\r\nthe most northerly of these blocks Negroes numbered 90 per cent and in\r\nthe most southerly only 2 per cent.\r\n\r\nOn Prairie Avenue, farther east, two Negro families bought homes in the\r\n3100 block in 1911, but the majority of the Negroes had come in since\r\n1916. The percentage of Negroes in that block was 50. From Thirty-second\r\nto Thirty-ninth Street the blocks were found to have more than 90 per\r\ncent Negroes. One family had been there five years and the average\r\nresidence was one and one-half years. No Negroes were found from Fortieth\r\nto Forty-fourth Street on Prairie Avenue. There were two families in\r\nthe 4500 block, and none south of that.\r\n\r\nOn Forest Avenue, from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street, 75 per cent\r\nof the families were Negroes and had lived there less than six years.\r\n\r\nOn Calumet Avenue, the next street east of Prairie, Negroes had begun\r\nto live within four years. The population was 75 per cent Negro from\r\nThirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street. None live south of Thirty-ninth\r\nStreet, except at the corner, where they had been living for five months.\r\n\r\nA similar situation was found on Rhodes Avenue, still farther east,\r\nfrom Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street. Negroes had lived in Vincennes\r\nAvenue, the next street east, less than two years, and in Cottage Grove\r\nAvenue, still farther east less than one year.\r\n\r\nSouth Park Avenue and its continuation, Grand Boulevard (south of\r\nThirty-fifth Street) was the most recent street into which Negroes had\r\nmoved in large numbers. This had occurred within the years 1915-17.\r\nThe first Negro families had moved into the 3400 block less than four\r\nyears previously. The percentage of Negroes between Thirty-first and\r\nThirty-fifth streets was less than 50. Within five months two Negro\r\nfamilies had moved into the hitherto exclusively white 3500 block.\r\n\r\nFew Negroes had moved from east of State Street to west of that street.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A NEGRO CHORAL SOCIETY]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. OUTLYING NEIGHBORHOODS\r\n\r\nThe Commission's investigation being confined to the city of Chicago,\r\nthe growing Negro colonies in such suburbs as Evanston and Glencoe\r\nwere not studied, but attention was given to two southwestern outlying\r\nneighborhoods in the east part of Morgan Park, just inside the city\r\nlimits, and the village of Robbins, wholly Negro, just outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MORGAN PARK\r\n\r\nIn 1910, 126 Negroes lived in Morgan Park, with a total population of\r\n5,269. In 1920 the area had been incorporated in the city of Chicago,\r\nand there were 695 Negroes in a total population of 7,780 occupying\r\napproximately the same area.\r\n\r\nIn its early days Morgan Park was the site of a theological seminary,\r\nwhich in 1892 became part of the University of Chicago. The first Negroes\r\nthere were servants, mostly from the South, working in the households of\r\nthe professors. The colony remained, and its more recent increase was due\r\nin considerable measure to the influx of well-to-do Negroes from farther\r\nnorth in Chicago, many of whom bought houses. In some cases Negroes in\r\ncongested Negro residential areas sold out to Negroes arriving in the\r\nmigration and re-established themselves in much better dwellings and\r\nsurroundings in Morgan Park.\r\n\r\nLess prosperous Negroes also came, despite the feeling of some home owners\r\nthat too great an influx of that type would injure property values and\r\nrender the neighborhood less desirable. Many of these work in the South\r\nChicago steel mills and the shops at Pullman. Some work in the Stock\r\nYards.\r\n\r\nA number of Negroes of Morgan Park are employed at the Chicago City\r\nHall. Some are porters on Pullman cars. Only a small number are laborers.\r\nMany of the women sew or work as car cleaners and seem reluctant to do\r\nhousework even at day wages.\r\n\r\nPhysically Morgan Park is attractive with comfortable homes and large\r\ngrounds. Several churches, a number of schools, and an attractive park\r\nall add to the desirability of the place as a \"home town.\" The lots\r\nare deep, affording plenty of space for gardens, and many vacant lots\r\nare cultivated. The opportunity for garden patches is an attraction for\r\nmany Negroes. There are two Negro churches, Methodist and Baptist, and\r\na Colored Men's Improvement Association which has provided a social hall\r\nfor the Negro population.\r\n\r\nSchool facilities are inadequate, and the buildings are old and\r\novercrowded. Because of this congestion, it becomes necessary for children\r\nin the sixth and higher grades to go three miles to a school on Western\r\nAvenue. About twenty Negroes attend the high school. In the Esmond Street\r\nschool approximately 25 per cent of the children are Negroes. The Negroes\r\nhave repeatedly requested enlarged school facilities. They want a new\r\nbuilding conveniently situated for their children.\r\n\r\nThe white people of Morgan Park are not unfriendly toward their Negro\r\nneighbors, though there seems to be a common understanding that Negroes\r\nmust not live west of Vincennes Road, which bisects the town from\r\nnortheast to southwest. A Negro once bought a house across the line but\r\nfound he was so unwelcome that he promptly sold again. More recently the\r\nowner of a three-story brick flat building rented to Negroes the twenty\r\nflats above his stores. A protest was made by both white and Negro house\r\nowners, so that he was forced to eject the Negro tenants.\r\n\r\nThe demand for homes is shown in the numbers of Negroes who go to Morgan\r\nPark on Sundays by automobile, street car, and train. In the spring of\r\n1920 a number of houses were being erected for Negro occupancy in what\r\nis known in Morgan Park as \"No Man's Land,\" east of Vincennes Road from\r\n109th to 112th streets. This swampy tract of land was being reclaimed.\r\nStreets had been surveyed and laid out, though with little paving. Water,\r\nlight, and gas were available, and some efforts at drainage had been\r\nmade, leaving some stagnant pools. Other plans involved the building of\r\neighty five-room bungalows by a Chicago contractor. Six of these were\r\nunder construction at the time of the investigator's visit, and five had\r\nbeen sold, corner-lot houses at $4,550, houses on inside lots at $4,330.\r\n\r\nMorgan Park Negroes appear to be progressing financially. An officer\r\nof a local trust and savings bank said that they met their obligations\r\npromptly, only occasionally defaulting or suffering foreclosure and then\r\nonly because of illness, death, or loss of employment. The same officer\r\nsaid savings accounts of Negroes were increasing in number, though small\r\nin amount.\r\n\r\nWhites and Negroes maintain a friendly attitude. During the 1919 riots\r\na number of conferences took place between Negroes and white people of\r\nMorgan Park. The Negroes kept rather close to their own neighborhood,\r\nand the only difficulty the police had was in controlling rowdy white\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nYounger children of the two races play together in the school yards.\r\nA teacher in the Esmond Street school declared that no distinction was\r\nmade between Negroes and whites in that school. It was noted, however,\r\nthat when games were played, this teacher directed the little Negroes\r\nto take little Negro girls as partners. Some prejudice is discernible\r\namong whites in the community, but there is an evident desire to be fair\r\nand to give the Negroes every reasonable opportunity to exemplify good\r\ncitizenship so long as they do not move from their own into the white\r\nneighborhoods.\r\n\r\nThose familiar with the Morgan Park settlement believe that it offers\r\nunusual inducements as a home community for Negroes. The contractor who\r\nis already building for Negroes there has confidence in the venture. He\r\nhas dealt before with Negroes and found them satisfactory clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. ROBBINS\r\n\r\nThis village is the only exclusively Negro community near Chicago with\r\nNegroes in all village offices.\r\n\r\nRobbins is not attractive physically. It is not on a car line and there\r\nis no pretense of paved streets, or even sidewalks. The houses are\r\nhomemade, in most cases by labor mornings, nights, and holidays, after or\r\nbefore the day's wage-earning. Tar paper, roofing paper, homemade tiles,\r\nhardly seem sufficient to shut out the weather; older houses, complete\r\nwith windows, doors, porches, fences, and gardens, indicate that some\r\nday these shelters will become real houses. In 1920 the village took\r\nout its incorporation papers, and while there are some who regret this\r\nindependence and talk of asking Blue Island to annex it, in the main\r\nthe citizens are proud of their village and certain of its future. There\r\nare 380 people all told, men, women, and children, living in something\r\nmore than seventy houses. It is a long mile down the road to the street\r\ncar, but daily men and women trudge away to their work, taking with\r\nthem the feeling of home ownership, of a place for the children to play\r\nunmolested, of friends and neighbors.\r\n\r\nThese men and women find many kinds of work in the neighboring towns--at\r\nthe mills, on the railroads, in the factories. Many of the women work\r\nin the factory of Libby, McNeil & Libby. Their wages go into payments\r\nfor their homes. Men and women together are living as pioneer families\r\nlived--working and sacrificing to feel the independence of owning a bit\r\nof ground and their own house.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE NEGRO COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE BEGINNING OF THE NEGRO COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nNegroes have been living in Chicago since it was founded. In fact, Jean\r\nBaptiste Point de Saible, a San Domingan Negro, was the first settler\r\nand in 1790 built the first house, a rude hut on the north bank of the\r\nChicago River near what is now the Michigan Boulevard Bridge.\r\n\r\nThere are records of Negroes owning property in Chicago as early as 1837,\r\nthe year of its incorporation as a city. In 1844 there were at least\r\nfive Negro property owners and in 1847 at least ten. Their property was\r\nin the original first and second wards of the city, one on Lake Street,\r\nothers on Madison, Clark, and Harrison, and Fifth Avenue. In 1848 the\r\nfirst Negro church property was purchased at the corner of Jackson and\r\nBuffalo streets, indicating the presence of the first colony of Negroes.\r\nIn 1850 the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law caused many to flee for\r\nsafety to Canada, many of the property owners disposing of their holdings\r\nat a great loss. In 1854 Negroes held two pieces of church property in\r\nthe same general locality. Although the great majority lived on Clark and\r\nDearborn streets north of Harrison Street, there was a tendency among\r\nthe property-owning class to invest in outlying property. Some of them\r\nbought property as far south as what is now Thirty-third Street.\r\n\r\nThe year of the Great Fire, 1871, Negroes owned four pieces of church\r\nproperty. That fire stopped at Harrison Street and did not consume all\r\nof the Negro settlement. A second large fire in 1874 spread northeast\r\nand burned 812 buildings over an area of forty-seven acres. With the\r\nrebuilding of the city they were pushed southward to make room for the\r\nbusiness district.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the most congested area of Negro residence, called the \"Black\r\nBelt,\" was a district thirty-one blocks long and four blocks wide,\r\nextending from Harrison Street on the north to Thirty-ninth Street on\r\nthe south, between Wabash and Wentworth avenues. Although other colonies\r\nhad been started in other parts of the city, notably the West Side,\r\nat least 50 per cent of the 1900 Negro population of 30,150 lived in\r\nthis area. As this main area of Negro residence grew, the proportion of\r\nNegroes to the total Negro population living in it increased until in\r\n1920 it contained 90 per cent of the Negroes of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE NEGRO COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of race contacts attention is called to the peculiar\r\nconditions which compel Negroes of the city to develop many of their\r\nown institutions and agencies. Partly from necessity and partly from\r\nchoice, they have established their own churches, business enterprises,\r\namusement places, and newspapers. Living and associating for the most\r\npart together, meeting in the same centers for face-to-face relations,\r\ntrusting to their own physicians, lawyers, and ministers, a compact\r\ncommunity with its own fairly definite interests and sentiments has\r\ngrown up.\r\n\r\nThe institutions within the Negro community that have been developed\r\nto aid it in maintaining itself and promoting its own welfare, are\r\nof four general types: (1) commercial and industrial enterprises; (2)\r\norganizations for social intercourse; (3) religious organizations; (4)\r\nagencies for civic and social betterment.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES\r\n\r\nCommercial and industrial establishments conducted by Negroes are listed\r\nby Ford S. Black in his yearly _Blue Book_, which serves as a directory\r\nof Negro activities. They increased from 1,200 in 1919 to 1,500 in 1920.\r\nThe compilation lists 651 on State Street, the main thoroughfare, 549 on\r\nprincipal cross streets, and more than 300 on other streets. The increase\r\nis strikingly shown in the following figures: In 1918 Negro business\r\nplaces on Thirty-first Street numbered nine and seventy-one in 1920; on\r\nThirty-fifth Street there were forty-seven in 1918 and seventy-seven in\r\n1920. On Cottage Grove Avenue, Negroes have only recently established\r\nthemselves in large numbers, yet between Twenty-eighth and Forty-fifth\r\nstreets there are fifty-seven Negro business places, including nine\r\ngroceries, three drug-stores, and two undertaking establishments.\r\n\r\nA partial list of business places as listed in Black's _Blue Book_ is\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n     Art stores                                      14\r\n     Automobile schools and repair shops             10\r\n     Bakeries, wholesale and retail                  13\r\n     Banks                                            2\r\n     Barbershops                                    211\r\n     Baths                                            2\r\n     Blacksmith shops                                 6\r\n     Book and stationery stores                       6\r\n     Chiropodist                                     29\r\n     Cleaning, dyeing, and repairing establishments  68\r\n     Clothing stores                                  8\r\n     Decorators                                      12\r\n     Dressmaking shops                               32\r\n     Drug-stores                                     31\r\n     Electricians and locksmiths                      9\r\n     Employment agencies                             15\r\n     Express and storage offices                     71\r\n     Fish markets                                     7\r\n     Florists                                         5\r\n     Furnace and stove repairing                      6\r\n     Groceries and delicatessens                    119\r\n     Hairdressing parlors                           108\r\n     Hotels                                          11\r\n     Ice-cream and confectionery stores               7\r\n     Insurance companies                              3\r\n     Jewelers                                         5\r\n     Laundries                                        2\r\n     Medicine specialists                             9\r\n     Millinery shops                                 15\r\n     Music and musical instruments                   16\r\n     Newspapers and magazines                        13\r\n     Musicians and music teachers                    66\r\n     Notions                                         25\r\n     Optometrists                                     4\r\n     Orchestras                                       1\r\n     Photographers                                    4\r\n     Plumbers                                         4\r\n     Printers                                        20\r\n     Public stenographers                             6\r\n     Real estate offices                             52\r\n     Restaurants                                     87\r\n     Schools                                          4\r\n     Shoemaking and repairing shops                  33\r\n     Shoe-shining parlors                            26\r\n     Sign painters                                    4\r\n     Soft-drink parlors                              11\r\n     Tailors                                         62\r\n     Toilet articles                                 10\r\n     Undertaking establishments                      21\r\n     Vending machines                                 2\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OLIVET BAPTIST CHURCH\r\n   The largest Negro church in Chicago (old building), at Twenty-ninth\r\n   and Dearborn streets.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ST.

ORGANIZATIONS FOR SOCIAL INTERCOURSE\r\n\r\nVarious organizations for social intercourse and mutual helpfulness have\r\ndeveloped in the Negro community. Some are local lodges or branches of\r\nnational organizations, and others are purely local and independent. Some\r\nare simply for social intercourse, and others have in addition benefit\r\nfeatures, professional interests, etc. Frequent reference is made in\r\nthe family histories given in this report to these various organizations.\r\n\r\n_Fraternal organizations._--Fraternal organizations are an old institution\r\namong Negroes. In the South they rank next in importance to the church;\r\nin the North they have considerable prestige. Membership is large and\r\ninterest is strong. Following is a list of the most active in Chicago:\r\n\r\n     Elks, Great Lakes Lodge No. 43, I.B.P.O.\r\n       Elks of the World (an independent order of Elks)\r\n     Ancient Order of Foresters\r\n     Catholic Order of Foresters\r\n     American Woodmen\r\n     Builders of America\r\n     Knights of Pythias\r\n     Mosaic Templars of America\r\n     Masons\r\n     Grand Court Heroines of Jericho of Illinois\r\n     Eastern Star\r\n     The Golden Circle\r\n     Odd Fellows (G.U.O. of O.F.)\r\n     Royal Circle of Friends\r\n     United Brotherhood of Friendship\r\n     Sisters of the Mysterious Ten\r\n\r\nAll of these organizations, although having their own rituals, serve\r\nas a means of group control and of exchange of views and opinions.\r\nThey are also a guaranty against absolute friendlessness, and that is\r\nperhaps one of the strongest motives for the establishment of the first\r\norganizations years ago. Much charitable and relief work is carried on\r\nby these fraternal bodies among their members.\r\n\r\nOut of these associations have grown clubs with social activities among\r\nwider circles. There are, for example, the Easter Lily Club, the Mayflower\r\nClub, and the Masonic Progressive Club.\r\n\r\n_Social clubs._--Many of the clubs and societies with social, educational,\r\nor professional interests are modeled after those of the larger community.\r\nThere are, for example, the Arts and Letters Society, the University\r\nSociety, and Civic Study Club. There are also many smaller clubs\r\norganized for various purposes, but designed principally to serve the\r\nNegro community. There are more than seventy women's clubs, leagued in\r\nthe Chicago Federation of Colored Women's Clubs. There are also the Art\r\nand Charity Club, Chicago Union Charity Club, Cornell Charity, Dearborn\r\nCentre, Diana Charity, East End 30th Ward, East Side Woman's Club,\r\nEureka Fine Arts, Fideles Charity, Giles Charity, Hyacinth Charity, Ideal\r\nEmbroidery Art, Ideal Woman's Club, Imperial Art, Kenwood Center, Mental\r\nPearls, Mothers' Union, Necessity Club, New Method Industrial, North\r\nShore, North Side Industrial, Motley Social Uplift, Phyllis Wheatley\r\nClub, Progressive Circle of Kings Daughters, 37th Ward Civic League,\r\nVolunteer Workers, West Side Woman's City Club, and the Woman's Civic\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\nAmong the exclusive social clubs, perhaps the most important is the\r\nAppomattox Club. Its membership includes the leading business and\r\nprofessional men, and it has a well-appointed club building. Its\r\nmembership is limited and it carries civic and social prestige.\r\n\r\nThe Phalanx Club is an organization of government employees. Its\r\nmembership is large, though limited by occupational restriction. Its\r\ninterests are largely social. The Forty Club and Half Century Club are\r\npurely social and still more exclusive.\r\n\r\nNegro professional societies, sometimes formed because of the objections\r\nof whites to the participation of Negroes in white societies of a similar\r\nnature, include the Lincoln Dental Association, Physicians, Dentists and\r\nPharmacists' Association, a Bar Association, and a Medical Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\n_Negro churches._--The church is one of the first and probably one of the\r\nstrongest institutions among Negroes. The importance of churches in the\r\nNegro community lies not only in their large membership and religious\r\ninfluence, but in their provision of a medium of social control for\r\ngreat numbers of Chicago Negroes, and in their great value in promoting\r\nthe adjustment of newcomers.\r\n\r\nIn the South the churches are the principal centers for face-to-face\r\nrelations. They serve as a medium for the exchange of ideas, making and\r\nmaintaining friendships, community co-operation, collective striving,\r\ngroup competition, as well as for the dissemination of information,\r\nassistance and advice on practical problems, and the upholding of\r\nreligious ideals. The pastors know the members personally, and the church\r\nexercises a definite control over individual behavior.\r\n\r\nThe church is often the only Negro social institution with an unhampered\r\nopportunity for development. In most southern cities, Negroes have no\r\nY.M.C.A., public playground, welfare organizations, public library,\r\ngymnasium, orderly dance halls, public parks, or theaters. The church in\r\na large degree takes the place of these and fills a vacancy created by\r\nthe lack of the public facilities ordinarily found in white communities.\r\nIn many instances it determines the social standing of the individual\r\nNegro. No one can escape the opprobrium attached to the term \"sinner\"\r\nif he is not a member of the church, however successful otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe minister is the recognized leader of the Negroes, and often their\r\nlegal adviser and school teacher. He is responsible for the social good\r\nbehavior of his people. No movement can get the support of the people\r\nunless it has his sanction.\r\n\r\nIn the North the function of both Negro church and pastor is different.\r\nNegroes can find other places than the church for their leisure time;\r\nnumerous urban and civic organizations with trained workers look after\r\ntheir interests, probably better than the church. In the Y.M.C.A. they\r\nfind religion related to the development of their bodies and minds. In\r\nnorthern cities enterprises and movements thrive without the good-will\r\nor sanction of the clergy, and even against their protest.\r\n\r\nThe field wholly occupied in the South by the church is shared in the\r\nNorth by the labor union, the social club, lectures, and political and\r\nother organizations. Some of the northern churches, realizing this, have\r\nestablished employment agencies and other activities of a more social\r\nnature in response to this new demand.\r\n\r\n_Social activities._--The churches in Chicago serve as social-contact\r\ncenters, though not to the same extent as in the South. Frequently they\r\narrange lectures, community programs, fêtes, and meetings. Many of them,\r\nseeking to influence the conduct of the group, have provided recreation\r\nand amusements for their members. Several churches have social-service\r\ndepartments, basket-ball teams, and literary societies. Olivet Baptist\r\nChurch, with a membership of 9,069, maintains an employment department,\r\nrooming directory, kindergarten, and day nursery, and employs sixteen\r\nworkers; in its social organization there are forty-two auxiliary\r\ndepartments. During the last five years it has raised $200,000,\r\ncontributed $5,600 for charitable relief, and found jobs for 1,100\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nUnique among such developments is the People's Church and Metropolitan\r\nCommunity Center, organized by a group which withdrew from the Bethel\r\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church in October, 1920. Relying solely\r\nupon its membership, it raised $22,000 during its first five months. Six\r\npersons are employed to carry on the work, one a social-service secretary.\r\nLand for a church building has been purchased, and plans have been made\r\nto buy a community-center building to accommodate several thousand people.\r\n\r\n_Relief work._--The records of the United Charities, which assumes the\r\ncare of dependent children of the juvenile court, show a much smaller\r\nproportion of appeals for aid from Negroes than might be expected.\r\nThis is partly explained by the work of the churches in relieving\r\nNegro families. A very high proportion of families below the line of\r\ncomfortable subsistence belong to the churches, the small \"store-front\"\r\nchurches. The number and variety of denominational divisions and sects\r\nincreases competition for membership and sends pastors and members out\r\ninto the community to gather in the people. Forty-one churches, many of\r\nthem small, reported a total of $15,038 distributed during 1920 for the\r\nrelief of the sick and distressed.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a summary of information collected by the Commission\r\nconcerning the churches in the Negro community:\r\n\r\n     Number of churches, regular and \"store-front\"               170\r\n     Number visited                                              146\r\n     Number of churches owning their property                     49\r\n     Value of property owned                              $1,677,183\r\n     Indebtedness on church properties being bought         $325,895.91\r\n     Amount collected in 146 churches during 1919           $400,000.00\r\n     Membership of 62 of the 146 churches                     36,856\r\n     Number in Sunday school in 57 of 146 churches            16,847\r\n     Number of persons in attendance in 64 of 146 churches\r\n       Morning                                                20,379\r\n       Evening                                                13,806\r\n\r\nIn a very few cases, Negroes are found to be members of white churches,\r\nbut the Negro churches have an entirely Negro membership with Negro\r\npastors.\r\n\r\n_\"Store-front\" churches._--The \"store-front\" church membership is\r\nmerely a small group which, for one reason or another, has sought to\r\nworship independently of any connection with the larger churches. The\r\nestablishment of such a church may be the result of a withdrawal of part\r\nof the membership of a larger church. They secure a pastor or select\r\na leader from their own number and continue their worship in a place\r\nwhere their notions are not in conflict with other influences. Most\r\nfrequently a minister formerly in the South has come with or followed his\r\nmigrant members and has re-established his church in Chicago. Or again\r\na group with religious beliefs and ceremonies not in accord with those\r\nof established churches may establish a church of its own. The groups\r\nare usually so small and the members so poor as to make the purchase of\r\na building impossible. The custom has been to engage a small store and\r\nput chairs in it. Hence the name \"store-front\" church.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO CHURCHES]\r\n\r\n_Denominations._--The varieties of denominational divisions are wide and\r\ninteresting.

In twenty of the twenty-six annual\r\ncollections aggregate $226,216.25.\r\n\r\nOut of 100 \"store-front\" churches visited only seven own or are buying\r\nthe property they use. The total value of the property of these seven\r\nchurches is $44,300. Four of the seven have an indebtedness of $7,300;\r\nand the four that kept records showed a total annual collection of $5,170.\r\n\r\n_The pastors._--A sharp division both as to education and experience\r\nis found between the pastors of the regular churches and those of\r\nthe \"store-front\" churches. Generally the larger churches have the\r\nbetter-trained, more experienced, and more highly salaried ministers.\r\nExceptions are found in the case of one or two \"holiness\" churches.\r\n\r\nThe ministers in these various churches represent a range of training\r\nfrom that of such seminaries as Newton Theological and institutions like\r\nYale University, University of Chicago, and Northwestern University, down\r\nto that of the sixth grade in grammar school. Some have had no schooling\r\nat all. The number of specially trained ministers totals twenty-one.\r\nSix of these are graduates of recognized northern institutions, while\r\nfourteen are graduates of recognized Negro institutions such as Lincoln\r\nUniversity, Howard University, Virginia Union University, and Livingston\r\nCollege. Four are graduates of standard high schools and four of other\r\nhigh schools below the standard rating. The remainder fall below the\r\nsixth grade. Among this last group it is not unusual to hear that \"God\r\nprepares a man to preach; he does not have to go to school for that. All\r\nhe must do is to open his mouth and God will fill it. The universities\r\ntrain men away from the Bible.\"\r\n\r\nThe range of active service in the ministry is from two months to\r\nforty-four years. Here again the larger established churches have the\r\nministers of longer service. Typical examples are found in churches like\r\nBethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, whose pastor has had forty-four\r\nyears of service; Shiloh, thirty-seven years; Bethesda Baptist Church,\r\nthirty-seven years; Grace Presbyterian Church, thirty-two years (all at\r\nthis one church); Original Providence, thirty-five years; Berean Baptist\r\nChurch, thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SOCIAL AND CIVIC AGENCIES\r\n\r\nSocial agencies in the Negro communities are an expression of group effort\r\nto adjust itself to the larger community. Within the Negro community\r\nthere are two types, those especially for Negroes and those which are\r\nbranches of the agencies of the larger community but located conveniently\r\nfor use by Negroes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TRINITY M.E.

AGENCIES ESPECIALLY FOR NEGROES\r\n\r\n_Chicago Urban League._--This organization is one of the thirty-two\r\nbranches of the National Urban League whose headquarters are in New York\r\nCity. It was established in Chicago in 1917 during the period of heaviest\r\nmigration of Negroes to the city. The numerous problems consequent upon\r\nthis influx guided the development of the League's activities. Its\r\nexecutive board and officers are whites and Negroes of high standing\r\nand influence in both the white and Negro groups, and it is supported\r\nby voluntary subscriptions. Within four years this organization has\r\ntaken the leading place among all the social agencies working especially\r\namong Negroes. It has a well-trained staff of twelve paid workers, and\r\nits work is carried out along the lines accepted in modern social work.\r\nThe League has organized its activities as follows: Administration\r\nDepartment, Industrial Department, Research and Records Department,\r\nChildren's Department, settlement work.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Administration Department involves, in addition to\r\ngeneral management, co-operation with other agencies and co-ordination\r\nof their efforts for community improvement through interracial meetings,\r\nconferences, and joint undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Department during 1920 placed more than 15,000 Negroes in\r\npositions, made industrial investigations in sixteen plants, provided\r\nlectures for workingmen in plants and for foremen over Negro workers.\r\nIt also investigates complaints of workers, selects and fits men for\r\npositions, secures positions for Negroes where Negroes have never worked\r\nbefore, and assists in other ways the adjustment of Negroes in industry.\r\nMore than 25,000 persons passed through the department during 1920.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Research and Records makes the investigations on the\r\nbasis of which the programs of the League are carried out. Its information\r\nis a permanent and growing body of material useful to all agencies and\r\npersons interested in obtaining reliable information concerning Negroes\r\nin Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe Children's Department handles cases of boys and girls and co-operates\r\nwith the schools, juvenile protective organizations, the juvenile court\r\nand probation department, and various other child-helping institutions.\r\nA total of 540 such cases were adjusted during 1920.\r\n\r\nDuring 1919 a total of $28,659 was raised and used in the support of\r\nthe Chicago Urban League.\r\n\r\nThe Wendell Phillips Settlement on the West Side is under the supervision\r\nof the League. The settlement has a day nursery and provides a center\r\nand leadership for twenty-five groups in the West Side community.\r\n\r\n_Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A._--This organization is a branch of the local\r\nYoung Men's Christian Association, but because of its location and the\r\npeculiar social problems of its membership and vicinity, it has become\r\none of the strongest agencies of the community. Its work is among boys\r\nand young men, many of whom are industrial workers in various plants.\r\nCommunity work is vigorously promoted. In 1920 an enthusiastic group\r\nof 1,137 boys was enlisted in a neighborhood clean-up campaign, and 100\r\ncommunity gardens were put in operation. Moving pictures and community\r\nsinging were provided during the summer months. The following list gives\r\nsome statistics of activities for the first nine months of 1920.\r\n\r\n     SOCIAL ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n     Attendance at building                  140,740\r\n     Attendance at reading-room               19,402\r\n     Attendance at Bible classes               1,514\r\n     Attendance at industrial clubs            5,394\r\n     Attendance at entertainments              6,542\r\n     Meals served                            100,610\r\n     Dormitory attendance                     71,396\r\n     Persons directed to rooms                   614\r\n     Persons assisted                          1,526\r\n     Persons reached through community work   10,406\r\n     Personal religious interviews               396\r\n     Men referred to churches                    196\r\n\r\n     PHYSICAL WORK\r\n\r\n     Men used swimming-pool                    3,604\r\n     Boys used swimming-pool                  14,096\r\n     Men and boys used shower baths           24,332\r\n     Participated in leagues and tournament    3,906\r\n     Spectators                               44,742\r\n     Men attended gymnasium classes            5,622\r\n     Boys attended gymnasium classes          17,106\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing work this institution has promoted efficiency\r\nand industrial clubs among Negro workers in industrial plants, three\r\nglee clubs, noonday recreational programs, and nine baseball teams.\r\n\r\nDuring 1919 the total contributions for support were $15,353, of which\r\n$3,100 came from Negroes. The membership dues of the latter, however,\r\ntotaled $16,000 and receipts from operation amounted to $143,747.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\r\nPeople._--This organization aims to carry out the general policies of the\r\nNational Association as far as they apply to Chicago. The national purpose\r\nis to combat injustice against Negroes, stamp out race discriminations,\r\nprevent lynchings, burnings, and torturings of Negroes, and, when they\r\ndo occur, to demand the prosecution of those responsible, to assure to\r\nevery citizen of color the common rights of an American citizen, and\r\nsecure for colored children equal opportunity in public-school education.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, the principal efforts of this organization have been in the\r\nline of securing justice for Negroes in the courts and opposing race\r\ndiscriminations in public accommodations. Its most active period followed\r\nthe riots of 1919. With a number of competent attorneys, white and Negro,\r\nit gave legal support to Negro riot victims and followed through the\r\ncourts the cases of many Negroes accused of participation in rioting.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SOCIAL AGENCIES USED BY NEGROES]\r\n\r\n_Community service._--The South Side Community Service is a re-established\r\norganization growing out of the Soldiers and Sailors' Club. It aims\r\nto provide wholesome recreation and leisure-time activities for its\r\nneighborhood. At Community House, 3201 South Wabash Avenue, it serves a\r\nnumber of organizations, arranges supervised dances, dramatics, programs,\r\nand other entertainment for the groups.\r\n\r\n_Wendell Phillips Settlement._--The Wendell Phillips Settlement is\r\nlocated on the West Side at 2009 Walnut Street and has been under the\r\nsupervision of the Chicago Urban League since 1918. It has a day nursery,\r\nserves as a center for twenty-five different groups, and provides the\r\nonly public meeting place for Negroes apart from the churches, on the\r\nWest Side. There is a Boy Scout division and a division especially for\r\nwomen and girls.\r\n\r\n_Butler Community Center._--The Butler Community Center is located on the\r\nNorth Side in a neighborhood with about 2,000 Negroes. About 250 persons\r\nuse the Center regularly. There are classes in citizenship, hygiene, Negro\r\nhistory, sewing, and china painting. There is an organization of Camp\r\nFire Girls and a Boys' Group. Through courses of lectures instruction\r\nis given in hygiene, sanitation, and first aid.\r\n\r\n_Phyllis Wheatley Home._--The Phyllis Wheatley Home was established\r\nseveral years ago to provide wholesome home surroundings for colored\r\ngirls and women who are strangers in the city and to house them until\r\nthey find safe and comfortable quarters. The building at 3256 Rhodes\r\nAvenue, which has been purchased, accommodates about twenty girls.\r\n\r\n_Home for the Aged and Infirm._--The Home for Aged and Infirm Colored\r\nPeople on West Garfield Boulevard is supported almost entirely by\r\ncontributions from Negroes.\r\n\r\n_Indiana Avenue Y.W.C.A._--The Indiana Avenue branch of the Y.W.C.A. on\r\nthe South Side is under the general direction of the Central Y.W.C.A.\r\nof Chicago. Its directors are Negro women. Many girls are directed\r\nin their activities by volunteer group leaders from the community.\r\nThe Industrial Department secures employment for Negro girls. A small\r\nnumber of girls live in the building at 3541 Indiana Avenue, and a room\r\ndirectory is maintained through which safe homes are secured for girls\r\nwho are strangers in the city, or who have no family connections. Mrs.\r\nMartha G. McAdoo is the executive secretary.\r\n\r\n_Elaine Home Club and Johnson Home for Girls._--The Elaine Home Club and\r\nthe Julia Johnson Home for Girls are small institutions which provide\r\nliving accommodations under careful supervision for young working girls.\r\n\r\n_Hartzell Center._--Hartzell Center is a social institution under\r\nthe direction of the South Park Methodist Episcopal Church. It has a\r\ncommercial school, in which typewriting and stenography are taught, a\r\ncafeteria, and some social activities.\r\n\r\n_Illinois Technical School._--The Illinois Technical School for Colored\r\nGirls, a Catholic Institution, serves as a boarding and technical school\r\nfor colored girls. It accommodates about 100 girls. Sister Augustina is\r\nthe superintendent.\r\n\r\n_Woodlawn Community Association._--This is a neighborhood organization\r\noriginally intended to interest the Negroes of the Woodlawn community\r\nin taking pride in their property and in making the neighborhood more\r\ndesirable for residence purposes. It has extended its functions to\r\ninclude community activities and civic welfare program.\r\n\r\n_Louise Training School for Colored Boys._--This school is at Homewood,\r\nIllinois, about twenty-five miles from Chicago; until 1918 it was located\r\nat 6130 South Ada Street. It receives dependent boys between eight and\r\nfifteen years of age. Some of these boys are placed in the institution\r\nby the Cook County authorities. The institution can accommodate only a\r\nfew. At present thirty-two boys are cared for in the dormitory. This is\r\nthe only institution in the city for dependent colored boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. AGENCIES CONVENIENT FOR NEGROES\r\n\r\n_American Red Cross._--The American Red Cross has a branch headquarters\r\nat 102 East Thirty-fifth Street. It gives emergency relief, general\r\ninformation and advice, and has been active in helping the families of\r\nNegro service men. During the riot of 1919 it provided food for thousands\r\nof Negroes who were cut off from work.\r\n\r\n_United Charities._--The United Charities, which provides relief and\r\nother help for needy families, has four branches convenient for use by\r\nNegroes: one at 2959 South Michigan Avenue, near the center of the main\r\nNegro residence area on the South Side; another at 1701 Grand Avenue,\r\nnear the West Side Negro residence area; another at 102 East Oak Street,\r\nnear the North Side area; and another at 6309 Yale Avenue, convenient\r\nfor Negroes living in Woodlawn, in the vicinity of Ogden Park and in\r\nthe southern part of the South Side residence area.\r\n\r\n_The Illinois Children's Home and Aid Society._--This society has two\r\nfield representatives who find homes for dependent Negro children and\r\nsupervise their placing. Since 1919 it has placed and supervised more\r\nthan 168 Negro children.\r\n\r\n_Abraham Lincoln Center._--The Abraham Lincoln Center is at Langley\r\nAvenue and Oakwood Boulevard. Although originally not used by Negroes,\r\nthe movement of the Negro population southward has added many of them\r\nto the group of people using its facilities. There is a boys' group, a\r\nbranch library, and a neighborhood visitor. Negroes are welcomed in most\r\nof the activities of this center. Miss Susan Quackenbush is the resident.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CHICAGO URBAN LEAGUE BUILDING\r\n   Located at 3032 South Wabash Avenue.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SOUTH SIDE COMMUNITY SERVICE BUILDING\r\n   Located at 3201 South Wabash Avenue.]\r\n\r\n\r\nC. MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n_Provident Hospital and Training School._--Provident Hospital and Training\r\nSchool is supported and controlled by whites and Negroes. It has a mixed\r\nboard of directors. Practically all its physicians and all its internes\r\nand nurses are Negroes. For the year ended June, 1919, the hospital\r\nhandled 1,421 patients, served 682 persons through its dispensary, and\r\ngave free medical care to 143. Of the total number of patients in the\r\nhospital during 1919, 1,248 were Negroes, and 173 were white. Support\r\nof the institution comes from patients and donations. During 1919 the\r\nreceipts from patients totaled $36,445.81; from donations $5,782.07.\r\nDonations in drugs totaled $1,505.95, and from the dispensary $112.05.\r\nThe expenses for the year were $42,002.35. The hospital has an endowment\r\nfund of $47,350, invested in securities. It has a training school for\r\nNegro nurses whose faculty is made up of prominent white and Negro\r\nphysicians and surgeons.\r\n\r\n_Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium._--The two branches of this institution\r\nwhich are in Negro neighborhoods, at 2950 Calumet Avenue and 4746\r\nSouth Wabash Avenue, and the Children's South Side Dispensary, 705 West\r\nForty-seventh Street, are municipal agencies so located that they are\r\nconvenient for Negroes.\r\n\r\n_South Side Dispensary._--This is at 2531 South Dearborn Street and is\r\nsupported by the Northwestern University Medical School. It gives free\r\ncare to those unable to pay for medical services.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. SUPPORT OF INSTITUTIONS BY NEGROES\r\n\r\nSocial agencies, although their work is limited as respects the Negro\r\ngroup, have for many years taken second place to the churches in\r\nself-support. This is accounted for largely by the fact that social work\r\nin general has been regarded as a philanthropic rather than a co-operative\r\nmatter. With Negro social and philanthropic agencies, especially during\r\nthe period of general unsettlement following the migration, the number\r\nof possible beneficiaries greatly increased, while the group of Negroes\r\neducated in giving to such agencies grew more slowly. Recently, however,\r\nsupport from Negroes for their own institutions has gradually been\r\nincreasing. An example is found in the Urban League. In 1917 Negroes\r\ncontributed $1,000 and in 1919 $3,000. During 1920 six social agencies\r\nand twenty-seven churches raised among Negroes approximately $445,000.\r\nAlthough Negroes contribute in some measure to agencies like the United\r\nCharities and American Red Cross, there is no means of knowing or\r\naccurately estimating the amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO HOUSING PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nA. A STUDY OF NEGRO FAMILIES\r\n\r\nConsideration of the housing problem as a continuing factor in the\r\nexperience of Negro families led to an effort to study it from a new\r\nangle of approach--through histories of typical families in the Negro\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe data thus gathered afford an opportunity to present an interpretative\r\naccount of Negro family life, setting forth the intimate problems\r\nconfronting Negroes in Chicago, their daily social difficulties, the\r\nreflection in their home life of their struggle for existence, just how\r\nthey live, how they participate in the activities of the Negro community\r\nand the community at large, their own opinions concerning civic problems,\r\ntheir housing experience, how much they earn and how much they save, how\r\nmuch they spend and what value they receive from these expenditures,\r\nhow they spend their spare time, and how they seek to improve their\r\ncondition in the community.\r\n\r\nA selection was made of 274 Negro families living in all sections of\r\nChicago. Three Negro women, well equipped to deal intelligently and\r\nsympathetically with these families, gathered this information. These 274\r\nfamilies lived in 238 blocks, the distribution being such that no type\r\nof neighborhood or division of the Negro population was overlooked. The\r\nquestionnaire employed contained five pages of questions and required an\r\ninterview of about two hours. Special effort was made to secure purely\r\nsocial information without the aid of leading questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL LIVING CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nFor the most part the physical surroundings of the Negro family, as\r\nindicated by these family histories, are poor. The majority of these\r\nhouses fall within the classifications noted as Types \"C\" and \"D\" in\r\nthe discussion of the physical condition of housing.[22]\r\n\r\nOn the South Side, where most of the Negro population lives, the low\r\nquality of housing is widespread, although there are some houses of a\r\nbetter grade which are greatly in demand.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary conveniences, considered necessities by the average white\r\ncitizen, are often lacking. Bathrooms are often missing. Gas lighting is\r\ncommon, and electric lighting is a rarity. Heating is commonly done by\r\nwood or coal stoves, and furnaces are rather exceptional; when furnaces\r\nare present, they are sometimes out of commission.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of \"Housing Conditions\" such notations as these are\r\noften found:\r\n\r\n     No gas, bath, or toilet. Plumbing very bad; toilet leaks; bowl\r\n     broken; leak in kitchen sink; water stands in kitchen; leak\r\n     in bath makes ceiling soggy and wet all the time. Plastering\r\n     off in front room. General appearance very bad inside and\r\n     out. Had to get city behind owner to put in windows, clean,\r\n     and repair plumbing. Heat poor; house damp. Plumbing bad;\r\n     leaks. Hot-water heater out of order. Needs repairing done\r\n     to roof and floors. In bad repair; toilet in yard used by two\r\n     families. Toilet off from dining-room; fixtures for gas; no gas;\r\n     just turned off; no bath; doors out of order; won't fasten.\r\n     Sanitary conditions poor; dilapidated condition; toilet won't\r\n     flush; carries water to bathtub. Plumbing bad; roof leaks;\r\n     plastering off; no bath or gas; general repairs needed; very\r\n     dirty. Plumbing bad; plastering off in toilet; window panes\r\n     broken and out; no bath or gas. Plastering off from water that\r\n     leaks from flat above; toilet leaks; does not flush; washbowl\r\n     and bath leak very badly; repairs needed on back porch; rooms\r\n     need calcimining. No water in hydrant in hall; no toilet,\r\n     bath, or gas; general repair needed. Water not turned on for\r\n     sink in kitchen; water for drinking and cooking purposes must\r\n     be carried in; toilet used by four families; asked landlord\r\n     to turn on water in kitchen; told them to move; roof leaks;\r\n     stairs and back porch in bad order. Sewer gas escapes from\r\n     basement pipes; water stands in basement. House dirty; flues\r\n     in bad condition; gas pipes leak; porch shaky. No heat and\r\n     no hot water; no repairing done; no screens; gas leaks all\r\n     over house; stationary tubs leak. Water pipes rotted out; gas\r\n     pipes leak. Toilet leaks; plastering off; windowpanes out.\r\n     Plastering off; large rat holes all over; paper hanging from\r\n     ceiling.\r\n\r\nThis is the common situation of the dweller in the districts mentioned.\r\nThe variations are in degree rather than kind. To dwellings a little\r\nbetter in sanitation and repair than those just described, the adjective\r\n\"fair\" was given.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a Negro family manages to escape from this wretched type of\r\ndwelling in the \"Black Belt.\" Some who were financially able purchased\r\nhomes in Woodlawn, for example, where they live much as white residents\r\ndo, supplied with the comforts and conveniences of life and in fairly\r\nclean, wholesome surroundings. There, as a rule, the physical equipment\r\nof their dwellings is good and is kept in repair. In some instances\r\nthey have hot-water heating, electric lighting, and gas for cooking\r\npurposes. They ordinarily redecorate once a year, take proper care of\r\ntheir garbage, keep the lawns cut and the premises clean; and otherwise\r\nreveal a natural and normal pride of ownership.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the Negro residents of Woodlawn are far more fortunate\r\nthan many of their race brothers who have purchased dwellings in the\r\n\"Black Belt.\" Many of these purchases have been made by migrants on\r\nlong-time payments, and large expenditure would be required to put the\r\nhouses in repair and keep them so. Purchases made by Negroes in Woodlawn\r\nhave been chiefly of substantial dwellings, not necessarily new but in\r\ngood condition and needing only ordinary repairs from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. WHY NEGROES MOVE\r\n\r\nExcept where the property is owned by Negroes there is frequent moving.\r\nThe records obtained of these movements give a great variety of reasons.\r\nA strong desire to improve living conditions appears with sufficient\r\nfrequency to indicate that it is the leading motive. Buying a home is one\r\nof the ways of escape from intolerable living conditions, but removal to\r\nother houses or flats is more often tried. For example, a man who now\r\nowns his home near Fifty-first Street and South Wabash Avenue--living\r\nthere with his two brothers and five lodgers--has moved six times, \"to\r\nlive in a better house and a better neighborhood.\" A family now living\r\nnear Thirty-first Street and Prairie Avenue, resident in Chicago since\r\n1893, has moved four times, three times to obtain better houses in better\r\nneighborhoods and once to get nearer to work. A man and wife living\r\nnear Fifty-third and South Dearborn streets have moved four times since\r\ncoming to Chicago in 1908. A family living on East Forty-fifth Street\r\nand paying $60 a month rent for six rooms has moved twice since 1900\r\nto \"better and cleaner houses.\" Another family paying $65 a month for\r\neight rooms on East Bowen Avenue has moved twice since 1905 into better\r\nhouses and neighborhoods. \"Better house\" and \"better neighborhood\" were\r\nthe most frequently given reasons.\r\n\r\n     Of kindred nature are these: leaky roof; house cold; dirty;\r\n     inconvenient; did not like living in rear flat; to better\r\n     conditions; better houses away from questionable places;\r\n     landlord would not clean; first floor not healthy; small and\r\n     undesirable; not desirable flat; poor plumbing; didn't like\r\n     neighborhood; moved to better quarters; landlord would not\r\n     repair; house too damp; no windows; owner would not fix water\r\n     pipes; more room wanted; better environment for children;\r\n     better street; no yard for children; better people; house in\r\n     bad condition; more conveniences for roomers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE FAMILY GROUPING\r\n\r\nThe normal family is generally recognized as consisting of five\r\npersons--two parents and three children. Properly they should make up\r\na single group and live by themselves. The 274 families studied were\r\nchosen as follows: in the most populous district, from Thirty-first\r\nto Thirty-ninth streets and from Wentworth Avenue to Lake Michigan,\r\nninety-nine family histories were taken; in the district north of\r\nThirty-first Street to Twelfth Street and from Wentworth Avenue to the\r\nLake, forty-six; in the narrow strip in Hyde Park known as the Lake Park\r\ndistrict, thirty-seven; in the district from Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth\r\nstreets and from Wentworth to Cottage Grove Avenue, thirty-six; on the\r\nWest Side, sixteen; in the Ogden Park district, fifteen; on the North\r\nSide, fourteen; and in Woodlawn, eleven. For convenience, as well as to\r\nshow contrasts or like conditions, the material has been analyzed and\r\ninterpreted by districts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOMES OF WHITE AND NEGRO EMPLOYEES OF AN OUTLYING\r\n   INDUSTRIAL PLANT\r\n\r\n     TIME CONSUMED IN TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM THE ARGO PLANT\r\n     BY ANY CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES.\r\n\r\n     LONGEST RIDE FOR WHITE EMPLOYEES:\r\n     ARGO TO LEMONT, VIA CHICAGO & JOLIET ELECTRIC R.R.       32 MINUTES\r\n\r\n     LONGEST RIDE FOR NEGRO EMPLOYEES:\r\n     ARGO TO STATE & 31ST ST.

WITH TWO TRANSFERS                        60 MINUTES]\r\n\r\nThere was found a wide variation in the family groups, comprising six\r\nclassifications, in three of which no lodgers appear. A lodger here means\r\nan adult not a member of the immediate family. Thus relatives, unless\r\ninfants or children, are classed as lodgers. The three groups without\r\nlodgers are: (1) man and wife; (2) two parents and children; (3) a parent\r\nand children. The other three groups with lodgers are: (1_a_) man and\r\nwife and lodgers; (2_a_) man, wife, children, and lodgers; (3_a_) man\r\nor woman, surviving head of the family, with lodgers.\r\n\r\nOf the total 274 family groups there were 104 without lodgers and 170,\r\nor 62 per cent, with lodgers. For the most part the lodgers were found in\r\n\"2_a_\" classification--in families. There were ninety-two such groups and\r\nonly sixty-one families with no lodgers. Forty-two couples had lodgers,\r\nand in thirty-six instances a man or woman living alone had lodgers.\r\nThirty-nine couples were living alone, and in only four instances was\r\nthere a parent alone with a child.\r\n\r\nThe Negro colony in Woodlawn approaches most nearly the normal family\r\ngrouping. Home ownership in that district is fairly common, and the\r\nhouses for the most part are substantial and well fitted and suited to\r\nthe families. In the eleven Woodlawn families there was but one where\r\nthe mother or father was dead or not living with the family. Lodgers\r\nwere found in only four of the eleven families: two were couples, one a\r\nfamily, and the other a single woman. In the eleven families there were\r\nseventeen children.\r\n\r\nA marked contrast with this section is found in the congested Negro\r\ndistrict between Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets. Out of a total\r\nof ninety-nine families seventy-two had lodgers, or 72 per cent as\r\ncontrasted with 36 per cent in Woodlawn and 62 per cent for the total\r\n274 cases. In this district there were forty-two families with children,\r\nthirteen couples without children, and seventeen where a man or woman\r\ntook lodgers. There were only fourteen families without lodgers, and\r\nthirteen couples living alone.\r\n\r\nNorth of Thirty-first Street in this South Side area were similar\r\nconditions. Of forty-six households studied, twenty-seven, or 58.7 per\r\ncent, had lodgers: of these sixteen were families with children, nine\r\nwere couples and two were man or woman with children. Of the households\r\nwithout lodgers, there were twelve families with children, five couples\r\nliving alone, and two instances of parent and child.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of families with lodgers was highest in the Lake Park\r\ndistrict, 75.6 per cent. On the West Side it was 68 per cent, a trifle\r\nhigher than for the entire 274 families. On the North Side it was 57\r\nper cent, on the South Side between Thirty-ninth and Sixtieth streets,\r\n41.6 per cent, and in the Ogden Park district 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Ogden Park district, with a relatively low percentage of families\r\nhaving lodgers, resembles the Woodlawn district in many respects. The\r\nhouses are built for single families and are largely owned by Negroes\r\nwho have lived in that locality for many years. Of the fifteen families\r\nthere visited, nine had no lodgers; and of the seven with lodgers, four\r\nwere families and two were couples without children.\r\n\r\n_Room crowding._--A study of Negro housing made in 1909 by the Chicago\r\nSchool of Civics and Philanthropy brought out the fact that, although\r\nNegro families find it extremely difficult to obtain a flat of three or\r\nfour rooms, they do not crowd together as much as white immigrants; that\r\nNegroes take larger flats or houses and rent rooms to lodgers to help\r\npay the rent, and thus lessen crowding among the members of the family.\r\nAmong the 274 families studied by the Commission there was comparatively\r\nlittle overcrowding. One room to a person is a standard of room occupancy\r\ngenerally accepted by housing authorities as involving no overcrowding.\r\nOf these 274 Negro households, only sixty-seven exceeded the standard.\r\nThere were, of course, wide divergences from the standard. For example,\r\nthere were eight instances of six persons living in five rooms; six of\r\neight persons living in six rooms; four of six persons living in four\r\nrooms; one of six persons living in three rooms; one of seven persons\r\nliving in three rooms; two of seven persons living in four rooms; two of\r\neight persons living in five rooms; one of nine persons living in five\r\nrooms; and one of eleven persons living in five rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of unusually large families, either in the number of children\r\nor lodgers, there was a corresponding increase in the number of rooms.\r\nThus in the case of fourteen persons making up one family, they were\r\nliving in ten rooms.\r\n\r\nThe five-room dwelling was the most common, with fifty-nine families;\r\nsix-room, forty-seven; seven-room, forty-two; four-room, forty-one.\r\n\r\nIn the Ogden Park district the standard of one person to one room was most\r\nclosely adhered to. All the fifteen families studied in that district were\r\nhoused in four-, five-, or six-room dwellings; ten of them in five-room\r\ndwellings. In Woodlawn the tendency was toward somewhat larger dwellings.\r\nThere were no four- and five-room dwellings, but five of seven rooms\r\nand three of six rooms, one each of eight and three rooms. The four-room\r\ndwelling was most prevalent on the North Side. Of the fourteen families\r\nstudied there, six were in such dwellings. There were two dwellings of\r\nsix rooms, two of seven, one of five, two of three, and one of eleven\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nOn the West Side, also, thirteen of the sixteen families were housed\r\nin four-, five-, six-, or seven-room dwellings, the five-room type\r\npredominating. In the Lake Park district the five-room type was most\r\nfrequent, there being eleven of these out of a total of thirty-seven,\r\nsix of six rooms and seven of seven rooms, the next largest group being\r\nfive of eight rooms.\r\n\r\nOn the South Side in the district from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth\r\nStreet, out of a total of ninety-nine there were eighteen families in\r\nfive-room dwellings, seventeen in four-room, nine in three-room, ten in\r\nsix-room, fourteen in seven-room, and eight in ten-room dwellings. In\r\nthe district north of Thirty-first Street the predominating size was\r\nsix-room dwellings, of which there were eleven, and there were nine\r\nof four rooms, seven of five rooms, and seven of seven rooms, the rest\r\nscattering from one-room dwellings to one dwelling of thirteen rooms.\r\nFrom Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth streets, six-room dwellings were most\r\nfrequent, there being eight of these out of a total of thirty-six,\r\nand there were seven of five rooms, six of six rooms, and six of seven\r\nrooms. The dwellings occupied by Negroes south of Thirty-ninth Street,\r\nit should be noticed, are larger than those north of that street.\r\n\r\nThe grouping of the 274 families according to number of persons is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Families   Persons to Family\r\n       48         4\r\n       40         2\r\n       35         3\r\n       37         5\r\n       30         7\r\n       29         6\r\n       22         8\r\n       17         9 or more\r\n       16         Not recorded\r\n     -----\r\n      274\r\n\r\nFour persons to a \"family\" was the most common type, there being\r\nforty-eight of these out of the 274. In the Woodlawn and Ogden Park\r\ndistricts the group of three was predominant. The North Side district\r\ngrouping of two persons to a family is partly due to the inclusion of\r\nnine \"groups\" of one person each who were interviewed mainly for data\r\nbearing upon industrial relationships. The tables show a total of sixteen\r\nsuch groups in the eight districts; but they are not deemed sufficient\r\nto vitiate the statistics.\r\n\r\nNegroes have more space in their living quarters than do other Chicago\r\npeople housed in similar grades of dwellings. They were usually found in\r\ndwellings of five rooms for each family, while the prevailing size among\r\nthe foreign groups was four rooms, as disclosed by the Chicago School\r\nof Civics housing studies from 1909 to 1917. In the School's earliest\r\nstudy of the Negroes it was said:\r\n\r\n     The colored families do not as a rule live in the small and\r\n     cramped apartments in which other nationalities are so often\r\n     found. Even the families who apply to the United Charities\r\n     for relief are frequently living in apartments which would be\r\n     considered adequate, as far as the number of rooms is concerned,\r\n     for families in comfortable circumstances.\r\n\r\nSome marked exceptions, of course, were found.\r\n\r\nThe four-room dwelling was found to prevail among the Slovaks of the\r\nTwentieth Ward, the Lithuanians of the Fourth Ward, the Greeks and\r\nItalians in the neighborhood of Hull-House, the various central and\r\nsouthern European nationalities who work in the South Chicago steel mills\r\nand live near-by, and among the Jews, Bohemians, and Poles of the West\r\nSide.\r\n\r\n_The lodger problem._--The prevalence of lodgers is one of the most\r\nconspicuous problems in the Negro housing situation. It is largely a\r\nsocial question. The difficulty of finding a home adequate for a family\r\nof four or five persons at a reasonable rent has forced many Negroes to\r\ntake over large buildings in better localities and in better physical\r\ncondition but with much higher rents. To meet these rents they have\r\ntaken lodgers. It was seldom possible to investigate the character of\r\nthe lodgers. The arrangement of these large houses, originally intended\r\nfor single-family use, prevents family privacy when lodgers are added,\r\nmaking a difficult situation for families with children. Again, the\r\nmigration brought to the city many unattached men and women who could\r\nfind no other place to live except in families. Thus it happens that\r\nin Negro families the lodger problem is probably more pressing than\r\nin any other group of the community. Not only do lodgers constitute a\r\nsocial problem for the family, but, having little or no interest in the\r\nappearance and condition of the property, they are in many instances\r\ncareless and irresponsible and contribute to the rapid deterioration of\r\nthe buildings.\r\n\r\nAs previously explained, the term \"lodgers,\" in this report, includes\r\nrelations as well as other adults unrelated to the family. It was apparent\r\nin the study that there was a large number of relative-lodgers in Negro\r\nfamilies. The recent migration from the South had a distinct bearing\r\non this situation. Many Negroes came to Chicago at the solicitation of\r\nrelatives and remained in their households until they could secure homes\r\nfor themselves. The migration further accounts for the accentuation of\r\nthe lodger problem during the period immediately following it. The 274\r\nfamily histories include 1,319 persons, of whom 485, or 35 per cent, were\r\nlodgers, living in 62 per cent of the households. The greatest number\r\nof households with lodgers were those living in five-room dwellings.\r\nThere were thirty-eight such households. Living in six-and seven-room\r\ndwellings were thirty-four families with lodgers. Families with only\r\none lodger were most numerous. There were fifty-five such families as\r\ncompared with thirty-nine having two lodgers, twenty-five with three\r\nlodgers, twenty-three with four lodgers, thirteen with six lodgers,\r\neight with five lodgers, and seven with more than six lodgers.\r\n\r\nNaturally the lodger evil was found in its worst form in the congested\r\nparts of the South Side. In the district from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth\r\nstreets seventy-two of the ninety-nine families had lodgers. In twenty-two\r\nfamilies there was but one, however, as against twelve with three and\r\nfour, eleven with two, and six with five and six lodgers. Two families\r\nhad ten each, and one had thirteen. This last case was that of a widow\r\nwho rented nine sleeping-rooms in her ten-room house, in addition to\r\ncatering at odd moments. It was a typical rooming-house as distinguished\r\nfrom a family taking lodgers. One family that had ten lodgers consisted\r\nof a man, his wife, and a son twenty-five years old; they had eight\r\nbedrooms, seven opening into a hall. The other family that had ten\r\nlodgers consisted of the parents and two children, a boy of eight and a\r\ngirl of seven, and had a ten-room house. The lodgers were two men and\r\nthree women, with five children. Five of the ten rooms were used as\r\nsleeping-rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the district north of Thirty-first Street an increased number of\r\nlodgers appeared in only one family, that of a man and his wife, without\r\nchildren. They lived in a ten-room house, using eight of the rooms for\r\nsleeping purposes and accommodating seven male and five female lodgers.\r\n\r\nIn the district from Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth Street was one instance\r\nof seven male lodgers in a seven-room house with the man who owned the\r\nproperty. Two of the lodgers were his brothers. There was no heat and\r\nno bathroom. The house had been reported to the health department.\r\n\r\nIn the Lake Park district one, two, or three lodgers were the rule,\r\nonly five of the twenty-eight families with lodgers in that district\r\nbeing outside of those three classes. Eight lodgers were found in an\r\neight-room dwelling. The family consisted of man and wife, and the only\r\nfemale lodger was their niece. Five rooms were used for sleeping purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the other district no instances of excessive overcrowding due to\r\nlodgers were found.\r\n\r\nComplaint has often been made of the numerical preponderance of lodgers\r\nover children among Chicago Negroes, and comment has been made on the\r\neconomic significance. It has been suggested, for example, that economic\r\npressure had lowered the birth-rate among Negroes and increased the\r\ninfant-mortality rate. As indicated by the 274 family histories, the\r\nnumber of lodgers among the Negro population exceeds the number of\r\nchildren, that is, the number of boys less than twenty-one years and\r\ngirls less than eighteen. The School of Civics and Philanthropy, in its\r\nhousing studies, counted as children those less than twelve years of\r\nage. On this basis it found in its study of the Negroes of the South and\r\nWest sides that there were less than half as many children as lodgers\r\non the South Side, but a more normal situation in the West Side. Even\r\nextending the ages of children, as has been done in the present report,\r\nthe situation does not appear in a much better light.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of lodgers and of children in the districts covered by\r\nthe Commission is shown in Table IX.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE IX\r\n\r\n     =====================================================================\r\n                                          | Percentage of | Percentage of\r\n               District                   |    Lodgers    |    Children\r\n     -------------------------------------+---------------+---------------\r\n     South Side:                          |               |\r\n       Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth       |      45.9     |     15.4\r\n       Twenty-second to Thirty-first      |      37.8     |     20.4\r\n       Thirty-ninth to Sixtieth           |      30.1     |     21.4\r\n     West Side                            |      21.8     |     32.0\r\n     Lake Park                            |      42.1     |     16.9\r\n     North Side                           |      15.2     |     25.0\r\n     Woodlawn                             |      26.9     |     30.0\r\n     Ogden Park                           |      12.3     |     45.0\r\n                                          +---------------+---------------\r\n         Total of 274 families            |      35.0     |     22.7\r\n     -------------------------------------+---------------+---------------\r\n\r\nBy way of comparison similar figures from other housing studies of the\r\nChicago School of Civics might be mentioned, the children in each instance\r\nbeing less than twelve years old.\r\n\r\nAmong the Slovaks of the Twentieth Ward, 13 per cent were lodgers and\r\n32 per cent children; in South Chicago, 27.3 per cent lodgers and 25.7\r\nper cent children; among the Greeks and Italians near Hull-House, 13\r\nper cent lodgers and 30 per cent children; among the Lithuanians of the\r\nFourth Ward, 28 per cent lodgers and 27 per cent children.\r\n\r\nAs far as the South Side is concerned, the situation with regard to the\r\nbalance between lodgers and children has become aggravated since the\r\nearliest School of Civics report was issued, whereas the situation on\r\nthe West Side has improved somewhat.\r\n\r\nWhere there were children and lodgers together, a considerable number of\r\ninstances were found which suggest probable injury to health or morals,\r\nand sometimes both. Even where lodgers are relatives, impairment of\r\nhealth and morals is threatened in certain circumstances, especially if\r\nthe over-crowding is flagrant. For example, a household on South Dearborn\r\nStreet near Thirty-fourth Street consisted of a father, mother, a son of\r\nnineteen years, and a baby girl of four months, with three lodgers, two\r\nmen and one woman--seven persons living in seven rooms and sleeping in\r\nall parts of the house. One of the lodgers was a sister-in-law, another a\r\nnephew by marriage, and the third, a stranger, had a bedroom to himself.\r\nIn a ten-room house in East Thirty-second Street parents having a boy of\r\neight years and a girl of seven years were found to have taken in ten\r\nlodgers, two of whom were men. In another instance five children, four\r\nof them boys of eight, five, four, and two years and a girl of eleven,\r\nlived with their parents and two lodgers in a six-room house.\r\n\r\nIn Ogden Park, a district which shows a high percentage of children,\r\nlodgers sometimes are added to the family. In one house of five rooms,\r\nfor example, there were found living twelve persons--father, mother, two\r\nsons, sixteen and seventeen years of age, four daughters, thirty-three,\r\ntwenty-four, twenty-two, and thirteen years of age, and four lodgers--a\r\ndaughter, her husband, and their two infants. There were only two bedrooms\r\nfor the twelve persons. Another instance was that of a family of father,\r\nmother, four sons, nine, five, three, and two years, and two daughters,\r\nseven years and three weeks, with a sister of one of the parents for a\r\nlodger. The nine persons lived in five rooms. There were only two beds\r\nin the house, and one of the bedrooms was not in use.\r\n\r\nOn the South Side near Thirty-first Street there was a case where a\r\nman lodger occupied one bedroom, the other being used by the parents\r\nand their eight-year-old daughter--four persons in a four-room flat.\r\nOn South Park Avenue near Twenty-ninth Street two lodgers, a son-in-law\r\nand a nephew, occupied two of the six rooms, while the husband and wife,\r\na son of twenty-three years, and a daughter of twenty-one years lived\r\nin the other four rooms, which included the kitchen and dining-room.\r\nA similar instance was found, on Indiana Avenue near Thirtieth Street,\r\nwhere two male lodgers lived with a family consisting of the parents,\r\na son of twenty, and a daughter of eighteen, all in six rooms, two of\r\nwhich were not sleeping-rooms. On Lake Park Avenue near Fifty-sixth\r\nStreet a family, including father, mother, and daughter of twenty, slept\r\nin the kitchen in order that three lodgers, one male and two female,\r\nmight be accommodated in the five-room flat. In a five-room flat on\r\nKenwood Avenue near Fifty-third Street the two male lodgers occupied\r\nboth bedrooms, while the mother and her boy of nine and girl of seven\r\nyears lived in the kitchen and dining-room. Seven persons were found\r\nliving in a six-room house on East Fortieth Street; they were father,\r\nmother, a son of five years, a daughter of seven years, and an infant,\r\nwith a male and a female lodger, friends of the parents. Virtually the\r\nwhole house was used for sleeping purposes.\r\n\r\nThese are examples of the arrangements that sometimes occur when children\r\nand lodgers are found in the same dwelling. The fact that in the main\r\nChicago Negroes live in more rooms per dwelling than immigrants, whose\r\nstandard of living has not yet risen, does not necessarily mean that\r\nthe Negroes have a greater appreciation of a house with more rooms.\r\nThe explanation in many cases is that the Negroes take whatever living\r\nquarters happen to be available, which often are large residences\r\nabandoned by well-to-do whites, and then adapt their mode of living to\r\nthe circumstances. Lodgers are one of the sources of revenue that aid\r\nin paying the rent. Negro families often expressed a desire to live by\r\nthemselves if they could find a dwelling of suitable size for reasonable\r\nrent. They sometimes complained of lodgers and declared that they would\r\nprefer not to take them at all, especially women lodgers. The objection\r\nto married couples and unattached men was not so pronounced.\r\n\r\nSmaller houses thus would seem to be a factor in the solution of the\r\nlodger problem. A Negro real estate dealer was asked if the Negro was\r\nas contented or as much disposed to live in a cottage as white people,\r\nor whether he wanted to live in spacious quarters where he could draw a\r\nrevenue from roomers. The reply was that the Negro would rather live by\r\nhimself. This is evidenced by the fact that many Negroes would rather\r\nlive in an apartment and rent two or three rooms than take a large house\r\nand have it full of roomers.\r\n\r\nLodgers are often found in the smaller dwellings occupied by Negroes.\r\nRent is often the determining factor in the selection of the smaller\r\ndwelling. When it is so high that it forms too large a proportion of\r\nincome, economic necessity often drives the Negro family to admit one or\r\nmore lodgers at the expense of overcrowding and its attendant harmfulness.\r\nThis was noted in certain districts where the dwellings as a rule were\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n_Rents and lodgers._--An effort was made to determine the economic\r\nnecessity for lodgers as expressed by the relation of the wages of heads\r\nof families to the amounts of rent paid. It is assumed that in a normal\r\nfamily budget rent should not exceed one-fifth of the income of the head\r\nof the family. Wide variations from that proportion were revealed.\r\n\r\nFacts as to both rent and wages were difficult to secure, owing to the\r\nvariable earnings of various members of the family, variable sums received\r\nfrom lodgers, and other factors. For example, seventeen occupants owned\r\ntheir houses. In seventy-eight other cases information obtained by the\r\ninvestigators was not adequate or could not, for various reasons, be\r\nused in calculations.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 179 cases out of the 274 provided data from which the\r\nfollowing facts are presented: In three instances the rent exceeded the\r\nincome of the head of the family; in thirty-one instances the rent equaled\r\none-half the income of the head of the family, and in an equal number it\r\namounted to one-third. In one case the rent was equal to three-fourths\r\nof the income, and in twenty-three cases the rent equaled one-fourth.\r\nThus eighty-nine instances were disclosed in which the rent was in excess\r\nof one-fifth of the income of the head of the family. In most of these\r\ncases, particularly the extreme ones, the income of the head of the\r\nfamily was greatly supplemented by money received from lodgers or from\r\nearnings of other members of the family.\r\n\r\nThe remaining ninety families in which the rent amounted to one-fifth\r\nor less of the income of the head of the family were divided as follows:\r\nTwenty-four fell in the one-fifth column, twenty-seven in the one-sixth\r\ncolumn, fourteen in the one-seventh column, eleven in the one-eighth\r\ncolumn, while fourteen were in the \"low\" column. The last named included\r\nthose ranging from one-ninth to one-twenty-third.\r\n\r\nOn the South Side, in the district from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth\r\nStreet, rents exceeded the one-fifth proportion in one-half of the\r\nsixty-two families studied, two of them paying rent in excess of income,\r\neight paying one-half of income for rent, fourteen paying one-third, and\r\nseven paying one-fourth. Of the remaining thirty-one families in that\r\ndistrict, seven fell in the one-fifth column, twelve in the one-sixth\r\ncolumn, six in the one-seventh column, four in the one-eighth column\r\nand two in the \"low,\" being one-ninth and one-eleventh.\r\n\r\nRents were high also in the Lake Park district, where twenty-five\r\nfamilies of a total of thirty-six were paying in excess of the one-fifth\r\nproportion. Fourteen of these paid one-half of the income for rent, five\r\npaid one-fourth, four paid one-third, one paid three-quarters, and in\r\none instance rent exceeded income. In only five instances was the normal\r\none-fifth paid, two paid one-sixth, two paid one-seventh, while two paid\r\none-ninth and one-eleventh respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the district north of Thirty-first Street, eighteen out of a total\r\nof thirty-eight families paid in excess of the one-fifth proportion,\r\nfour paid one-half, nine paid one-third, and five paid one-fourth.\r\nSix families paid the normal one-fifth, five paid one-sixth, two paid\r\none-seventh, one one-eighth, and six less than that, running as low as\r\none-twenty-third.\r\n\r\nThe Ogden Park area was found to be a district of low rents. None of the\r\neight families studied paid as much as the normal one-fifth. Two paid\r\none-sixth, one paid one-seventh, three one-eighth, one one-ninth, and\r\none one-twelfth.\r\n\r\nThe other districts did not show much variation from the normal proportion.\r\n\r\nExamination was made of all the factors in instances where the rent\r\nequaled one-half or more of the income of the head of the family or\r\namounted to one-third. With regard to the former it was assumed, for the\r\npurpose of the study, that it compelled renting rooms to lodgers. With\r\nregard to the one-third column, lodgers were assumed to be an economic\r\nnecessity when they offered the only source of income in addition to that\r\nof the head of the family. On these bases it was found that in forty-six\r\nfamilies supplementary income afforded by lodgers was necessary, that\r\nin three instances they were the sole source of the income, while one\r\ninstance was presented of a widow whose children partly supported her,\r\nbut insufficiently for their common needs.\r\n\r\nWhile in most instances of high rents and low income on the part of the\r\nhead of the family good reason appeared for taking lodgers, in not a few\r\ninstances further analysis revealed other sources of income which might\r\nindicate that there was no economic necessity for lodgers. There was one\r\ninstance on Forest Avenue, for example, where the relation of the rent\r\nto the father's income was one-third, but where his sons earned more\r\nthan double his income. In another family on South State Street near\r\nThirtieth Street, the father earned $125 a month and paid $50 a month\r\nrent, but additional income was derived from the wife, son, and daughter,\r\nin addition to that obtained from lodgers. There was likewise the case\r\nof a waiter living on Lake Park Avenue whose rent was $30 a month as\r\nagainst wages of $10 a week. In addition to the tips he doubtless received\r\nin his work, his wife earned $18 a week, and $6 a week was derived from\r\nlodgers. In one instance a man living near Fifty-sixth Street and Wabash\r\nAvenue paid rent equal to one-third of his wages, but had considerable\r\nincome from investments.\r\n\r\nSuch instances tend to explain why only forty-eight families were found\r\nin which lodgers seemed to be an economic necessity in aiding to pay\r\nrents, when eighty-nine cases were revealed in which the rent was in\r\nexcess of one-fifth of the wages of the head of the family. The family\r\nhistories also showed that various means besides lodgers supplemented\r\nthe insufficient income of a family head. In some cases the wife or\r\nchildren worked, and not infrequently their incomes exceeded those of\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\nLodgers were often found in families where the income from that source\r\ndid not appear to be needed. This was the case in a number of families\r\nwith unusually high wages and abnormally low rents. High wages and\r\nlow rents explain most of the cases shown where the rent ranges from\r\none-ninth to one-twenty-third of the income of the head of the family. In\r\nthe one-twenty-third case the couple lived in two rooms on South State\r\nStreet for which they paid $6 a month. The man earned $35 a week in an\r\niron foundry, while the wife added $18 a week to the common fund. Another\r\ninstance was that of a man who paid $16 a month rent and earned $48 weekly\r\nat the Stock Yards. His wife and a relative added $23.60 a week to the\r\nfamily income. A man in Ogden Park whose income as a contractor was $48\r\na week paid $16 a month rent. A man living on the West Side earned $48\r\na week and paid $15 a month rent. His children added $43.50 a week to\r\nthe family income.\r\n\r\nEven in circumstances such as these, lodgers were sometimes taken. In\r\none case where the rent was one-tenth of the wages of the head of the\r\nfamily the man paid $15 a month rent for a five-room dwelling out of his\r\n$36 weekly wages earned in a coke plant at Gary. His son and lodgers\r\nincreased the monthly income by $28. There was a teamster earning $30\r\na week who paid $15 a month rent for a six-room dwelling in which nine\r\npersons lived. The proportion of rent to his wages was as one to eight.\r\nHis wife, one of his children, and lodgers added to the income. As in\r\nnumerous instances where the income was high, a large amount was spent\r\nfor food in this family.\r\n\r\nAn instance was found of a man earning $9.50 to $10.50 a day. His wife\r\nwas a caterer. There was a daughter of fifteen years. They took three\r\nroomers. There was no need for the woman to work, but she said she wanted\r\nthe money. She was a good cook, having served in that capacity in the\r\nSouth, and she said she earned $15 when she went out for a week-end of\r\ncatering. In this instance there seemed to be little need for lodgers.\r\n\r\nAnother case was that of a man and his wife and two grown children living\r\nin a nine-room dwelling on Calumet Avenue and having nine lodgers. The\r\nman was earning $40 a week, and the lodgers paid $33.50 a week. The wife\r\noccasionally did day work, earning $3.65 a day. The monthly expenditure\r\nfor food was $100, clothing $33, and rent $60.\r\n\r\nAnother instance was that of a widow with three children who lived on\r\nState Street near Thirty-seventh Street, in a three-room flat. Though the\r\nchildren's earnings amounted to $78 a week, the inevitable lodger was\r\npresent, contributing $4 a week to the common fund. This little family\r\nspent $120 a month for food.\r\n\r\nLarge amounts spent for food were not uncommon in some families that\r\ntook lodgers. A typical instance was that of the man and wife with three\r\nchildren and two lodgers who lived on Prairie Avenue. The man earned\r\n$25 a week, while $82 a month was derived from the lodgers. Food for\r\nthe family alone cost $100 a month.\r\n\r\nA man on North Wells Street earned $57 a week for the support of his\r\nwife and three adopted children. They lived in an eleven-room house\r\nwhich also accommodated the man's sister and brother. One of the sons\r\nearned $75 a week, and the lodgers paid $45 a month. This family spent\r\n$180 a month for food. Another earned $22 a week in the Stock Yards.\r\nBesides his wife and child they had in their nine-room house on East\r\nThirtieth Street six lodgers paying $20 a week. This family spent $100\r\na month for food and $34 for clothing. Another man and wife on Forest\r\nAvenue paid $25 a month rent and spent $88 a month for food and $43 for\r\nclothing. They derived $3.75 a week from their two lodgers. A similar\r\ncase was that of a family which lived on East Thirty-second Street. The\r\nman earned $30 a week in a foundry. He and his wife have one child, and\r\nthey had ten lodgers, who paid $72 a week. In this family $80 was spent\r\nfor food each month and $50 for clothing.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest expenditure for food in any one family was $330 a month.\r\nThis was explained by the fact that there were twenty table boarders.\r\nThe husband earned $22.50 a week, and there were three lodgers who paid\r\n$13 a week. The boarders collectively paid $13 a day. Rent was $55 a\r\nmonth, and $25 a month was spent for clothing.\r\n\r\nOther reasons for the ready acceptance of lodgers in Negro dwellings\r\nwere apparent, among them friendship and the desire to be obliging and\r\nto assist others in a new environment. Most Negroes would regard it as\r\na breach of good faith to encourage friends and relatives to come to\r\nChicago from the South and then fail to help them after their arrival.\r\nThis accounts for the frequent designation of \"relatives\" and \"friends\"\r\namong the lodgers. Sometimes these lodgers seemed to be permanent, but\r\noften they were taken only until they could adjust themselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of greatest migration, 1915-20, hundreds of unattached\r\nmen and women could be seen on the streets as late as one or two o'clock\r\nin the morning, seeking rooms shortly after their arrival in Chicago.\r\nOne instance was reported of a family to whose house four men came at\r\nmidnight looking for rooms. Lack of lodging-houses or of hotels where\r\naccommodations could be had at reasonable prices was partly responsible\r\nfor this swarm of migrants seeking shelter in private homes. The meager\r\nprovision of such places for the accommodation of unattached Negroes\r\nhas been a factor in the lodger problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. HOW NEGRO FAMILIES LIVE\r\n\r\nHow Negroes earn their living in Chicago, what occupational changes\r\nthose from the South have undergone since arrival, how their present\r\noccupations differ from those in their former homes--information on\r\nall these points was gained from the family histories. Almost without\r\nexception, the Negroes interviewed declared that their economic situation\r\nhad improved in Chicago. In most instances they were able to earn more;\r\nsome said they were obliged to work harder but felt well recompensed\r\nbecause of their improved economic condition.\r\n\r\nFrom the occupations of persons included in the study it appears that\r\nthere is a distinct departure from the domestic and personal service in\r\nwhich Negroes were commonly found a few years ago. Among the 274 families\r\nvisited, the heads of 225 families were men. Of this number eighteen\r\nwere idle at the time of the investigation, in the summer of 1920, nine\r\nwere professional men, nineteen were in business, twenty-two were in\r\nsome skilled trade or work, 110 were doing unskilled work, and only\r\nforty-seven were engaged in personal service. The latter term includes\r\nsuch occupations as doorman in a hotel or club, bellboy, bootblack, cook,\r\nwaiter, porter, elevator operator, and chauffeurs who lack training as\r\nmechanics. These are chiefly functions which bring employees in contact\r\nwith the public or with white employers in a more or less personal\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to Chicago, forty-five of the 225 were farmers. Practically\r\nall of these entered the field of unskilled occupations here. Only\r\nsixty-four of the 225 had been doing unskilled work in their former\r\nhome. Six more did skilled work in their former homes than were doing\r\nsuch work in Chicago; two more were in personal service; two less were\r\nin business; and one more was in a profession.\r\n\r\nOf these 225 family heads, 122 migrated to Chicago, chiefly from the\r\nSouth, during the period from 1916 to 1920 inclusive. Three periods in\r\nthe industrial history of the family head were taken: (1) occupation in\r\nthe former home; (2) occupation on first arrival in Chicago; and (3)\r\nadjustment to new conditions in Chicago and occupation at the time of\r\ninvestigation, during the spring and early summer of 1920.\r\n\r\nMany of these migrants had not yet made their adjustment to the new\r\noccupations at that time. However, certain tendencies were manifest.\r\nFor example, in the former home thirty-one were farmers and forty-five\r\nwere unskilled workers. In the period of adjustment seventy-seven were\r\ndoing unskilled work. The unskilled occupations had apparently, in the\r\nshifting about, absorbed the farmers. The difficulty of continuing in\r\nskilled occupations in the North was evidenced. In the South fourteen\r\nof the 122 men were engaged in skilled occupations of some sort; in\r\nthe period of adjustment there were fifteen; but at the time of the\r\ninvestigation there were but twelve.\r\n\r\nIn the South nineteen of the 122 were in personal-service occupations;\r\nduring the transition period, eighteen; and at the time of the\r\ninvestigation, sixteen. In the South seven were in business; during the\r\nperiod of transition, three; and at the time of the investigation, five.\r\nIn the South four were in practice as professional men; during the period\r\nof transition only three; while at the time of the investigation there\r\nwere five, one just beginning to practice.\r\n\r\nAs to whether any previous occupational training was used or abandoned\r\nafter coming to the North, it appeared that of the 225 only 91 utilized\r\nsuch training. In 134 cases previous training was not used, but these\r\nincluded many who were farmers in the South.\r\n\r\nOf forty-nine who had been engaged in personal-service occupations before\r\ncoming to Chicago, only twenty still continued in such work. Six were\r\nunemployed at the time of the investigation, nineteen were in unskilled\r\nwork, one was doing skilled work, and three were in business.\r\n\r\nForty-nine women were heads of families as revealed by the 274 family\r\nhistories. This does not include all the Negro women shown by the\r\nhistories to be engaged in gainful occupations in Chicago. Often daughters\r\nwere working. There were thirty instances in which man and wife both\r\nworked outside of the home. Before coming to Chicago 129 wives were\r\nemployed, while in Chicago sixty-seven wives were gainfully employed,\r\nincluding the thirty who were working in addition to their husbands.\r\nDuring the period of transition, it appears, they helped out, since the\r\nrecords show that 132 were then at work. But the tendency plainly is to\r\nabandon the practice as soon as the family becomes settled in the new\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nOf seventeen women who had worked as house servants in their former\r\nhomes, seven were found in factories, three in offices, two in stores,\r\nand five in unskilled manual labor.\r\n\r\nSome of the transitions in occupation are especially interesting. One\r\noil-field worker in the South had become a shoemaker. A farmer had become\r\na postal clerk. A former superintendent of a label factory attended\r\nhigh school during the adjustment period and became an undertaker. One\r\nwho was a schoolboy in the South worked in a hotel on coming to Chicago\r\nbut became a grocer. A barber in Kansas City became first a painter in\r\nChicago, then a janitor. A bottler from Memphis, Tennessee, went to work\r\nin the Stock Yards but became a canvasser. A farmer from Alabama worked\r\nfirst in the Yards and later in woolen mills.\r\n\r\nOne man was a porter in a store in Mississippi. In Chicago he became a\r\nchauffeur. A farmer from Louisiana on arriving worked as a butcher and\r\nthen secured employment in a tannery. A porter in a wholesale grocery\r\nin Memphis, Tennessee, who worked first in Chicago as a lard maker in a\r\npacking-house, later became a building laborer. A preacher from Tennessee\r\nworked at Swift's packing-house until he could become established in a\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nA Mississippi plumber who served as a butter maker for a time after\r\nreaching Chicago became a contractor within three years. A hotel porter\r\nfrom Alabama came to Chicago in 1918 and went to work in a steel foundry\r\nand later in a soap factory. A farmer who worked on shares in Georgia\r\ntried work in the Stock Yards in Chicago, but changed to a paint shop. An\r\nAlabama man who worked in a sawmill there found a job in a steel foundry\r\nin Chicago, and later went to the Stock Yards. A man who worked in an\r\nice plant in Texas became a railroad porter after coming to Chicago and\r\nthen found a job as a butcher at the Stock Yards.\r\n\r\nA man who began life as a bootblack in Atlanta came to Chicago in 1893\r\nand sold newspapers until he could enter business for himself. For\r\nmany years he has been a jeweler. In the South his wife was a musician\r\nby profession. To aid her husband in his struggle she worked in a box\r\nfactory for a time after arriving in Chicago.\r\n\r\nClergymen sometimes abandon their profession for more remunerative\r\nemployment. One of these came to Chicago from Boston in 1904. For a time\r\nhe worked as a fireman and later in a packing-house. One who served\r\nas a waiter on first coming to Chicago became an insurance agent, and\r\nanother, who was a reporter on a Negro newspaper on arrival in Chicago,\r\nbecame the manager of a manufacturing company.\r\n\r\nFew migrants continued in Chicago the employment in which they worked\r\nin the South.\r\n\r\nThe family histories show that the Stock Yards industry absorbed many\r\nof the migrants, and a large number went to work in the steel mills and\r\niron foundries, as well as in lighter manufactures.\r\n\r\nMany Negro women have become hairdressers and manicurists after a course\r\nin a school of \"beauty culture\" which also teaches the use of cosmetics.\r\nConsiderable skill is often required in this work, and the earnings often\r\nsupplement very substantially the husband's income and may be sufficient\r\nto make an individual self-sustaining in case of need. Hairdressing is\r\nmost frequently done in the homes.\r\n\r\nAn occasional teacher, cateress, or seamstress was found among the Negro\r\nwomen. Some of them remained in personal-service occupations, but a\r\ndecided tendency was noticeable toward office and factory employment.\r\n\r\nIn summary it is scarcely necessary to remark that wages in the North far\r\nexceed those in the South. The difference in some instances is so great\r\nthat many foolish expenditures are indulged in before the relatively\r\nhigher cost of living is appreciated, or other conditions are properly\r\nunderstood. High wages, supplemented by income from other sources, often\r\nproved a temptation to unnecessarily heavy expenditures for material\r\ncomforts, such as food and clothing. With relation to food it did not\r\nappear that Negroes were deliberately taken advantage of in their buying,\r\nbut that they frequently bought articles without considering prices that\r\nhad been refused by others because they were deemed excessive.\r\n\r\nInsurance of one kind or another was often carried in the families\r\nstudied. In spite of high living costs, a considerable number of families\r\nwere found to have bank accounts, Liberty bonds, War Savings stamps,\r\nand good interest-paying investments.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Negroes who at some time had lived in the South was\r\nmainly that they were obliged to work harder for what they got North.\r\nThey also declared that they were unable to save as much as they hoped\r\nor expected, because of high prices. But in the great majority of\r\ncases satisfaction was expressed over the improvement in their economic\r\nsituation. While their movements in search of better housing in Chicago\r\nwere extremely frequent, they still felt that they were better housed\r\nthan in their former homes, where bathtubs, steam heat, and electric\r\nlighting were almost unknown. Being accustomed to a certain measure of\r\ndilapidation in their home surroundings in the South, the Negro is not\r\nnecessarily dismayed by the extent of dilapidation in Chicago's Negro\r\nhousing, though usually it is not long before he begins to think of more\r\nsubstantial dwellings in better surroundings than those he first obtains.\r\n\r\nAlso in Chicago he finds available and accessible to his home many\r\nchurches, some with large memberships and adequately housed; the best\r\nschools he has ever known; fine hospitals and dispensaries at his command;\r\nsome playgrounds, bathing-beaches, parks, and similar facilities for\r\nhis recreation and that of his children; settlement houses; libraries;\r\nand many other civic and recreational societies that make a strong\r\nappeal to his interest and promote his ambition for physical and mental\r\ndevelopment. He finds many motion-picture theaters and other amusements\r\nfor his leisure hours.\r\n\r\nWhere the habit has not already been established, he is learning to make\r\nliberal use of all these facilities through the guidance and direction\r\nof Negro newspapers and organizations working especially for the\r\nimprovement of the Negro group. There are indications of improvement in\r\nmoral standards, health, and civic consciousness through these contacts\r\nand the use of these up-building social agencies.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of migrants and their feeling toward the community were\r\nsolicited. It appeared that above all they prized the social and political\r\nfreedom of the North. Satisfaction was expressed over the escape from \"Jim\r\nCrow\" treatment in the South. They valued the independence possible in\r\nthe North, and sometimes spoke of having come North \"out of bondage.\" They\r\nrecalled frequently the \"shameful treatment received by the Negroes from\r\nthe white people in the South,\" the \"intimidation and discrimination,\"\r\nand they were surprised and sometimes amazed at the fact that they could\r\ngo and come at will in Chicago, that they could ride in the front of\r\na street car and sit in any seat. Satisfaction was also expressed over\r\nthe fact that they could get a job at good wages and did not have to buy\r\ngroceries at plantation stores where they felt they had been exploited.\r\n\r\nThus, while they may have to work harder and may find it difficult for\r\na long time to adjust themselves to the environment, few indicated any\r\nintention of returning to the South. In some instances, where adjustments\r\nhave not been made, some discouragement was evidenced, and they sometimes\r\nexpressed the feeling that they were no better off in Chicago than in\r\ntheir former homes. The prevailing sentiment, however, was in favor of\r\nremaining in spite of some greater difficulties.\r\n\r\nOften Negroes from the South said they missed the care-free social\r\ngreetings and relationships that prevail in the rural South. They thought\r\nthat people in the North were \"colder,\" that they did not show sufficient\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nAsked what conditions they would change if they could have their way,\r\nthe most frequently expressed desire was for more and better housing.\r\nImprovement of social, moral, or political conditions followed. Some\r\nemphasized the necessity of improving the management of the migrants\r\nfrom the South, whose new-found freedom had led them to become offensive\r\nin their conduct. Interviews with migrants, however, indicated that\r\ninstruction was being received without offense from many social agencies\r\non how to act, dress, and speak in such a manner as not to create\r\nunfavorable impressions.\r\n\r\nThere were some complaints of political exploitation and of being\r\nobliged to live in proximity to gambling and vice that were encouraged\r\nby political bosses in their neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry showed that membership in clubs, lodges, and kindred\r\norganizations was almost as universal as church affiliation. There\r\nwere only a few families in which no member had any association with a\r\nfraternity or club.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A GROUP OF FAMILY HISTORIES\r\n\r\nThe general statistical treatment of these 274 Negro families takes\r\naway many of their human qualities. For this reason a selection has\r\nbeen made of various types of Negro families in order that a rounded\r\npicture of the whole unit may be given. The family stories that follow\r\ninclude typical migrant Negroes from the South--common laborers, skilled\r\nlaborers, salaried, business, and professional men. They illustrate\r\nthe commonplace experiences of Negroes in adjusting themselves to the\r\nrequirements of life in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IRON WORKER\r\n\r\nMr. J----, forty-nine years old, his wife, thirty-eight years, and\r\ntheir daughter twenty-one years, were born in Henry County, Georgia.\r\nThe husband never went to school, but reads a little. The wife finished\r\nthe seventh grade and the daughter the fifth grade in the rural school\r\nnear their home.\r\n\r\nThey worked on a farm for shares, the man earning one dollar and the\r\nwomen from fifty to seventy-five cents a day for ten hours' work. Their\r\nhome was a four-room cottage with a garden, and rented for five dollars\r\na month. They owned pigs, poultry, and a cow, which with their household\r\nfurniture, were worth about $800. The food that they did not raise and\r\ntheir clothing had to be bought from the commissary at any price the\r\nowner cared to charge.\r\n\r\nThey were members of the Missionary Baptist Church and the wife belonged\r\nto the missionary society of the church and the Household of Ruth, a\r\nsecret order. Their sole recreation was attending church, except for\r\nthe occasional hunting expeditions made by the husband.\r\n\r\n_Motives for coming to Chicago._--Reading in the _Atlanta Journal_,\r\na Negro newspaper, of the wonderful industrial opportunities offered\r\nNegroes, the husband came to Chicago in February, 1917. Finding conditions\r\nsatisfactory, he had his wife sell the stock and household goods and\r\njoin him here in April of the same year. He secured work at the Stock\r\nYards, working eight hours at $3 a day. Later, he was employed by a\r\ncasting company, working ten hours a day and earning $30 a week. This is\r\nhis present employment and is about forty minutes' ride from his home.\r\nBoth jobs were secured by his own efforts.\r\n\r\nThe family stayed in a rooming-house on East Thirtieth Street. This\r\nplace catered to such an undesirable element that the wife remained\r\nin her room with their daughter all day. She thought the city too was\r\ncold, dirty, and noisy to live in. Having nothing to do and not knowing\r\nanyone, she was so lonely that she cried daily and begged her husband\r\nto put her in three rooms of their own or go back home. Because of the\r\nhigh cost of living, they were compelled to wait some time before they\r\nhad saved enough to begin housekeeping.\r\n\r\n_Housing experience._--Their first home was on South Park Avenue. They\r\nbought about $500 worth of furniture, on which they are still paying. The\r\nwife then worked for a time at the Pullman Yards, cleaning cars at $1.50\r\na day for ten hours' work. Their house leaked and was damp and cold, so\r\nthe family moved to another house on South Park Avenue, where they now\r\nlive. The house is an old, three-story brick, containing three flats. This\r\nfamily occupies the first flat, which has six rooms and bath. Stoves are\r\nused for heating, and gas for light and cooking. The house is warm, but\r\ndark and poorly ventilated. Lights are used in two of the rooms during\r\nthe day. The rooms open one into the other, and the interior, as well\r\nas the exterior, needs cleaning. There are a living-room, dining-room,\r\nand three bedrooms. The living-room is neatly and plainly furnished.\r\n\r\nThe daughter has married a man twenty-three years old, who migrated first\r\nto Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, then to Chicago. He works at the Stock\r\nYards. They occupy a room and use the other part of the house, paying\r\nhalf the rent and boarding themselves. A nephew, who was a glazier in\r\nGeorgia, but who has been unable to secure work here, also boards with\r\nMr. and Mrs. J----, paying $8 a week. He is now unemployed, but has been\r\ndoing foundry work. Mrs. J---- occasionally does laundry work at $4 a day.\r\n\r\n_How they live._--The cost of living includes rent $25; gas $5.40 a\r\nmonth; coal $18 a year; insurance $9.60 a month; clothing $500 a year;\r\ntransportation $3.12 a month; church and club dues $3 a month; hairdresser\r\n$1.50 a month. Little is spent for recreation and the care of the health.\r\nThe family carries insurance to the amount of $1,700, of which $1,200\r\nis on the husband.\r\n\r\nThe meals are prepared by the wife, who also does the cleaning. Greens,\r\npotatoes, and cabbage are the chief articles of diet. Milk, eggs, cereals,\r\nand meat are also used. Meat is eaten about four times a week. Hot bread\r\nis made daily, and the dinners are usually boiled.\r\n\r\n_Relation to the community._--The whole family belongs to the Salem\r\nBaptist Church and attends twice a week. The wife is a member of the\r\nPastor's Aid and the Willing Workers Club, also the Elk's Lodge. The\r\nhusband is a member of the Knights of Pythias. He goes to the parks,\r\nbathing-beaches, and baseball games for amusement. The family spends\r\nmuch of its time in church and helped to establish the \"Come and See\"\r\nBaptist Mission at East Thirty-first Street and Cottage Grove Avenue.\r\nThey have gone to a show only once or twice since they came to the city.\r\nDuring the summer they spend Sunday afternoons at the East Twenty-ninth\r\nStreet Beach.\r\n\r\nHeavier clothes were necessary because of the change of climate, and\r\nmore fresh meat is used because of the lack of garden space and the high\r\ncost of green vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe wife thinks that northern Negroes have better manners, but are not\r\nas friendly as the colored people in the South. She says people do not\r\nvisit each other, and one is never invited to dine at a friend's house.\r\nShe thinks they cannot afford it with food so high. She thinks people\r\nwere better in the South than they are here and says they had to be good\r\nthere for they had nothing else to do but go to church.\r\n\r\nShe feels a greater freedom here because of the right to vote, the better\r\ntreatment accorded by white people, the lack of \"Jim Crow\" laws. She\r\nlikes the North because of the protection afforded by the law and the\r\nbetter working conditions. \"You don't have an overseer always standing\r\nover you,\" she remarked.\r\n\r\nLife here is harder, however, because one has to work all the time. \"In\r\nthe South you could rest occasionally, but here, where food is so high\r\nand one must pay cash, it is hard to come out even.\" The climate is\r\ncolder, making it necessary to buy more clothes and coal. Rent also is\r\nvery much higher here. They had to sell their two $50 Liberty bonds.\r\n\r\n_Economic sufficiency._--With all this, Mrs. J---- gets more pleasure\r\nfrom her income because the necessities of life here were luxuries in\r\nGeorgia, and though such things are dear here there is money to pay for\r\nthem. Houses are more modern, but not good enough for the rent paid.\r\nThey had to pay $2 more than the white family that moved out when they\r\nmoved in.\r\n\r\n_Sentiments on the migration._--Mrs. J---- says \"some colored people\r\nhave come up here and forgotten to stay close to God,\" hence they have\r\n\"gone to destruction.\" She hopes that an equal chance in industry will\r\nbe given to all; that more houses will be provided for the people and\r\nrent will be charged for the worth of the house; and the cost of living\r\ngenerally will be reduced. She does not expect to return to Georgia and\r\nis advising friends to come to Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FACTORY HAND\r\n\r\nIn his home town in Kentucky, Mr. M---- was a preacher with a small\r\ncharge. Now, at the age of forty-nine, in Chicago, he works in a factory\r\nand is paid $130 a month. He has an adopted son, twenty-three years of\r\nage, who is an automobile mechanic in business for himself, drawing an\r\nincome of $300 a month.\r\n\r\nMr. M---- might still be a preacher on small salary but for the\r\nintervention of his wife. He came to Chicago about 1900. His wife came\r\nfrom Nashville, Tennessee, in 1902, and they were married in 1904. Mrs.\r\nM---- felt that she was too independent to \"live off the people\" and\r\npersuaded her husband to give up the ministry. He got a job as foreman\r\nat a packing-house, where he earned $25 a week for a ten-hour day. Next\r\nhe worked for the Chicago Telephone Company, and finally secured the\r\nposition with a box-manufacturing company which he now holds.\r\n\r\n_Family life._--The M----s have adopted three children, having had none\r\nof their own--the adopted son already mentioned, an adopted daughter now\r\ntwenty years of age, and another foster son of thirteen. The latter is\r\nin a North Side school. The girl is in a normal school in Alabama. Both\r\nMr. and Mrs. M---- completed high school. All speak good English.\r\n\r\nWife and husband have separate banking accounts. Living expenses for such\r\na large family are, of course, heavy. For example, the bills for food\r\naggregate from $42 to $45 a week, and more than $200 a year is paid in\r\ninsurance premiums. Frequently a woman is hired to come in and help with\r\nthe housework. Food in good variety is used. Illness prevented adding\r\nto the bank accounts during the year of 1920. An operation performed\r\non Mrs. M---- cost $650 and the illness of Mr. M---- and the daughter\r\nconsumed between $900 and $1,000.\r\n\r\n_Housing experience._--The M----s' first home in Chicago was a cottage\r\nin the \"Black Belt.\" They wanted a large house and found one on South\r\nState Street. The neighborhood, however, was displeasing to them, and\r\nthey moved to the North Side to be near a brother's children. The house\r\nwas too small, and they moved again to another North Side address. Again\r\nthe neighborhood proved distasteful, so they bought the three-story\r\ndwelling on the North Side where they now live. It is in good sanitary\r\ncondition and is supplied with gas. As lodgers they have the wife's\r\nsister and brother, who are actually members of the family.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--They belong to the Baptist church.\r\nAffiliations of a secular nature include the Masons, the Household of\r\nRuth, the Court of Calanthe, the Eastern Star, the Heroines of Jericho,\r\nthe North Side Men's Progressive Club, the Twentieth Century and Golden\r\nLeaf clubs, and the Young Matrons and Volunteer Workers. Mrs. M---- is\r\npresident of a settlement club and a member of the Urban League. After\r\ncoming to Chicago three years passed before she mingled much with people.\r\nShe had always done community work in her southern home and feels that\r\nher reluctance here was due to the fact that she did not know what the\r\nnorthern people were like. She found them friendly enough when at last\r\nshe did associate with them.\r\n\r\n_Sentiments on community problems._--They came to Chicago because they\r\nhad visited here and liked it well enough to come back and settle.\r\nConditions are not all that they would like. They would like to see\r\nNegroes allowed to live anywhere they choose without hindrance, they\r\nwould suppress moving pictures that reveal murder, drinking, and similar\r\nacts that lead young people to commit crimes. They would also like to see\r\nnewspapers abandon their habit of printing articles that are derogatory\r\nto the Negro, thus creating prejudice, and of printing items unfit for\r\nchildren. Also they would like to see better homes for Negroes.\r\n\r\nFor the Negroes, they feel, life in the North is considerably easier\r\nthan in the South, since they can always get plenty of work and do not\r\nhave to work so hard as in the South. The mixed schools in the North are\r\nespecially appreciated because no discrimination can creep in. The general\r\nlack of segregation on street cars, in parks, and in similar public places\r\nalso pleases them. Still they see difficulties for southern Negroes who\r\ncome North to live and are easily led astray. Southern Negroes are not\r\naccustomed to the new kinds of work and are inclined to slight it. This\r\nis, of course, unsatisfactory to their employers and accounts in some\r\nmeasure for the frequency with which they change jobs. This may also\r\naccount for the fact that white people are averse to paying migrants well.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RAILWAY MAIL CLERK\r\n\r\nMr. L---- was graduated from the Carbondale (Ill.) high school and the\r\nSouthern Illinois State Normal School, while Mrs. L---- was graduated\r\nfrom Hyde Park High School and the Chicago Normal School. The latter\r\nis a music teacher. Before coming to Chicago, Mr. L---- was a school\r\nprincipal in Mounds, Illinois, and Mrs. L---- also was a teacher. They\r\nare northern people, the husband having been born in East St. Louis and\r\nthe wife in Chicago. They have a daughter, three years of age, and have\r\nliving with them a niece and nephew, six and five years old, as well as\r\ntwo adult women relatives.\r\n\r\n_Economic sufficiency._--As a railway mail clerk, Mr. L---- earns $125\r\na month. He owns a house and lot in Carbondale and carries insurance on\r\nhis life and property. They spend $37.50 a month for rent, about $10\r\nfor miscellaneous items, $15 a week for food, $4 a month for gas, $1\r\nfor barber's services, and always $10 a month is added to the family's\r\nbank account.\r\n\r\n_Housing and neighborhood expenses._--In April, 1919, a flat building\r\nsouth of Sixty-third Street, previously occupied by white people, was\r\nopened to Negroes. The L---- family were the first of the Negroes to\r\nmove in. A few white families wished to remain and lived in the same\r\nbuilding with the Negroes. Mr. L---- says: \"We objected, as they were\r\nnot the kind of people we wanted to live with. My sister-in-law acted\r\nas agent of the building, and the condition of some of the flats was\r\nterrible. The owner was arrogant when the Negroes first came in, but\r\nhe soon found that we would not be pleased with just anything. He told\r\nus he saw that we were particular and wanted things nice, and, said\r\nhe, 'Seeing that you are that way, I'll do the best I can for you, as\r\nI believe you will take care of the flat.' The Negroes insisted on the\r\nlaundry being cleaned and it is now being used.\"\r\n\r\nThe L---- family has had three stoves since moving in. After thoroughly\r\nrenovating the building and making many of the repairs themselves, the\r\nsanitary conditions are good, and the owner makes no further objection\r\nto maintaining the good order of things.\r\n\r\nThe white people of the neighborhood objected to having the building\r\noccupied by Negroes. White boys of the neighborhood stoned the building,\r\nand its tenants were obliged to call upon the police for protection. This\r\nantagonism now seems to have disappeared. The white and Negro children\r\nplay together amicably.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--Mrs. L---- attends the First Presbyterian\r\nChurch regularly and Mr. L---- is a member and secretary of the board of\r\ntrustees of the A.M.E. Mission. He is a Mason and a member of the Woodlawn\r\nCommunity Organization, which has the betterment of the neighborhood\r\nas its aim. He plays tennis for recreation and goes to concerts and\r\nthe movies for entertainment. The children in the family have made use\r\nof public playgrounds and libraries. Bathing-beaches have been sought\r\noccasionally, and contacts have been made with the St. Lawrence Mission,\r\na neighborhood institution.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on race relations._--Mr. L---- thinks that agitation is of\r\nno assistance to the problem and draws attention to the fact that lack\r\nof agitation on the part of newspapers averted a riot in connection\r\nwith one recent racial disturbance. \"Housing is the greatest difficulty\r\nconfronted by the migrant from the South.\" It is his opinion, further,\r\nthat the Negroes are not understood, that the white people fear them\r\nuntil they become really acquainted with the Negroes. \"Contact,\" he\r\nsays, \"is the only thing that will help to make conditions better. It\r\nis just a question of understanding each other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA MULATTO\r\n\r\nMr. A---- was born in Chicago and his wife in Helena, Arkansas. He was\r\neducated in the Chicago public schools, and his wife attended Fisk\r\nUniversity, Nashville, Tennessee, and afterward the Chicago Musical\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nMr. A---- is light in complexion and is frequently mistaken for a white\r\nman. Several years ago, without announcing his race, he obtained work in a\r\nlabel factory and remained for some time until it was discovered that he\r\nwas not a white man, and therefore the only Negro in the establishment.\r\nThe officials, being the first to learn his racial identity, decided to\r\nkeep him as long as no objection came from the other white employees.\r\nIn a few years he became superintendent of the factory, which position\r\nhe held for eight years. He was treated as an equal by members of the\r\nfirm, who visited him at his home and invited him to their club. He was\r\nalso president of the company's outing club.\r\n\r\nA short time ago he decided to enter business for himself, and both he\r\nand his wife took courses in an embalming school. He now has a business\r\nwith stock and fixtures valued at $10,000.\r\n\r\n_Economic sufficiency._--His business income affords a comfortable\r\nlivelihood and a surplus for investment. He has bought one house and\r\nbuilt another. These two are valued at $8,000 and yield $90 monthly.\r\nHe also owns stock in the Pennsylvania Railroad and a fire insurance\r\ncompany, has $300 invested in Liberty bonds and owns a $1,000 automobile.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--Mr. and Mrs. A---- attend Congregational\r\nchurch services every Sunday and get much pleasure from concerts,\r\nlectures, and shows in the \"Loop.\" Their principal recreation is motoring.\r\nMr. A---- is president of an association of business men and of a\r\ncharity organization. He is a member of several fraternal organizations,\r\ncontributes to Provident Hospital, United Charities, and the Urban\r\nLeague. His wife is an active committee member of a charity organization.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on local race problems._--Mr. A---- thinks there would be\r\nno housing problem if prejudice were not so marked. He mentioned a\r\nsubdivision east of Stony Island Avenue where it is specifically stated\r\nthat Negroes are not desired. Homes there are being sold for prices within\r\nthe reach of Negroes, and he feels that at least 500 Negroes would be\r\nglad to pay cash for such homes anywhere in Chicago if they were given\r\nthe opportunity. He feels that proper protection should be given Negroes\r\nagainst bombers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRANSPLANTED HOUSEHOLD\r\n\r\nMr. B---- is seventy-two years old and his wife sixty-four. They came to\r\nChicago during the migration. They had difficulty in finding work suited\r\nto their advanced age and in accustoming themselves to the simplest\r\nchanges in environment. Neither of them can read or write.\r\n\r\n_Home life in the South._--In Alabama they owned an eight-acre farm\r\nand a four-room house and raised hogs, chickens, and cows. They both\r\nhad worked twelve hours a day for years and by denying themselves even\r\na comfortable home had saved $2,000. They were members of a church,\r\nalthough they could not actively participate in church or other affairs\r\nof their rural community. When the migration fever struck them they sold\r\ntheir property, drew out their $2,000, and followed the crowd.\r\n\r\n_Home life in Chicago._--They first secured rooms and began the search\r\nfor work. Mr. B---- finally secured a job in a livery stable at $18\r\na week, but the work was uncertain and the wages insufficient. Mrs.\r\nB---- went to work cleaning taxicabs. Illness and frequent lapses in\r\nwork depleted their savings. They rented an eight-room house and took\r\nin lodgers, hoping to insure a steady income. They have nine lodgers in\r\nthese eight rooms, in addition to themselves. There is no furnace heat;\r\nthe bathroom is out of repair, the halls dark and dirty, and they are\r\nusing their old furniture brought from the South. Three of the women\r\nlodgers came from the same Alabama community. The habits and customs of\r\nthis household are unchanged. They go out seldom, and all of the women\r\nsmoke pipes and use snuff.\r\n\r\nOf the original $2,000 which Mr. B---- brought with him, he has $250 left.\r\n\r\nThey make no use of civic and social agencies and do not go to church\r\nbecause they think Chicago Negroes are unsociable. They prize the\r\nfact, however, that work is plentiful for the lodgers, and they have no\r\nintention of returning South.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BARBER FROM MISSISSIPPI\r\n\r\nMr. D---- was a migrant and a member of a party of over a hundred Negroes\r\nwho left Hattiesburg, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1916.\r\n\r\nHe was a barber at home and earned an average of $25 a week. Mrs. D----\r\nwas a good housewife. They owned a house and lot valued at $1,000 and\r\nfurniture valued at $500. They have two children.\r\n\r\n_Motive for coming to Chicago._--Mr. D---- had always read the _Chicago\r\nDefender_, and usually got in a supply of these papers to sell to\r\nhis customers and to supply topics for barber-shop discussion. His\r\ndaughter, then a student at Straight College in New Orleans, was to be\r\ngraduated that year, and he went to New Orleans to spend a week. While\r\nthere he worked in a barber shop. He found that the migration was being\r\nmuch discussed. One day a man came into the shop and said he was a\r\nrepresentative of a northern industry that was anxious to get Negroes\r\nto come North and work for it. He argued that the North had freed the\r\nNegroes, but had left them in the South where they had not received good\r\ntreatment, so that at this late date the North was trying to right an\r\nold wrong and was now offering to Negroes a chance to work. On the other\r\nhand the Negroes were indebted to the North for their freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. D---- returned home he sold his barber shop and left for the\r\nNorth with his wife and children.\r\n\r\n_Life in Chicago._--Opening a place of business in Chicago, he called\r\nit the Hattiesburg Barber Shop. It is patronized largely by Hattiesburg\r\npeople who came up in his party. His earnings are larger here, but at\r\nfirst his wife was forced to work in the Stock Yards at $10 a week to\r\nhelp meet the family budget. Occasionally now she works as a hairdresser.\r\nThey pay $46.50 a month for rent. Their clothing bill amounts to $650\r\na year. Last year they spent $200 for medicine and an average of $18 a\r\nweek for food. Their insurance premiums total $6 a month.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--In the South the entire family was active in\r\nchurch affairs. In Chicago they have continued their church connections,\r\nand Mr. D---- is one of the officials at the Olivet Baptist Church. They\r\ngo to church four times a week.\r\n\r\n_Adjustments to Chicago._--They were quick to begin adjustment to their\r\nnew surroundings, profiting by the advice and instructions of their\r\npresent pastor. At the end of six months they felt themselves quite at\r\nhome. They feel the need for using more careful English and are more\r\nformal in their greetings and relations with persons whom they meet.\r\nThey enjoy the \"freedom of speech and action\" allowed in Chicago, the\r\nprivilege of voting, the freedom from segregation, and the absence of\r\nJim Crow laws. They think Chicago is fair to Negroes in so far as laws\r\nare concerned, but believe there should be better enforcement of the\r\nlaws. They find life easier here, although there is more work to be\r\ndone. They feel a great satisfaction in the more modern homes and other\r\ncomforts and pleasures they are able to obtain. Each month they add a\r\nsmall amount to their bank account. They suggest that Negroes who have\r\nbecome adjusted to Chicago should take pains in a kindly spirit to inform\r\nnewcomers concerning the proper deportment. They believe that if advice\r\nis offered in the right manner it will always be gladly received. They\r\ndo not intend to return South.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STOCK YARDS LABORER\r\n\r\nA son-in-law of the B---- family, also from Mississippi, is employed\r\nat the Stock Yards. His impressions throw light on the adjustment of\r\nmigrants and on their views. He said:\r\n\r\n\"A friend met me when I first came to Chicago and took me to the Stock\r\nYards and got me a job. I went to the front of the street car the first\r\ntime I entered one here because my friend told me to; I would not sit\r\nbeside a white person at first, but I finally got courage to do so.\r\n\r\n\"At Swift's the whites were friendly. There I was in the dry-salt\r\ndepartment at 22½ cents an hour. The foreman, a northerner, had been\r\nthere thirty-five years. He was fair to all. I worked with Americans,\r\nPoles, and Irish. But the work was very hard, and I had to leave. I\r\ncarried my lunch with me. Negroes and whites there eat together when\r\nthey wish. I am now working at Wilson's. The Irish and Poles are a mean\r\nclass. They try to get the Negroes to join the union. When the Negroes\r\nwent to work Friday after the riot, most of the Irish and Poles quit\r\nand didn't come back to work until Monday. They came back jawing because\r\nthe Negroes didn't join the union. White members of the union got paid\r\nwhen their houses had been burned--$50 if they had families and $25 if\r\nthey were single. Colored members of the union got nothing when their\r\nhouses had been burned. That's why I won't join. You pay money and get\r\nnothing. The whites worked during the riot; we had to lose that time.\r\nI lost two weeks. It seemed strange to me. It looked unfair. They are\r\nstill mean and 'dig ditches' for us. They go to the foreman and knock\r\nus, just trying to get us out of jobs. The foreman so far hasn't paid\r\nany attention to it. I am working in the fresh-pork department, handling\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n\"The Negroes stick together and tend to their business. Some of the\r\nAmericans and Polish are very friendly. Everybody does his own work. We\r\nuse the same showers and locker-rooms. They don't want us to work because\r\nwe are not in the union. One asked me yesterday to join. The Poles said\r\nnon-union men would not get a raise, but we got it.\"\r\n\r\n_Opinions on race relations._--\"When I first came I thought the city\r\nwas wide open--I mean friendly and free. It seems that there is more\r\ndiscrimination and unfriendly feeling than I thought. I notice it at\r\nwork and in public places. Wages are not increasing like the high cost\r\nof living. As soon as one gets a raise, the cost of living goes up [May,\r\n1920].\r\n\r\n\"The whites act just as disorderly on cars as the Negroes. Monday evening\r\ntwo white laborers sitting beside a white woman cursed so much that I\r\nhad to look around. Nothing is ever said about such incidents.\r\n\r\n\"Rent goes up whenever people think of it. We have to pay $8 more since\r\nApril. Things are getting worse for us and we need to think about it.\r\nStill it is better here than in the South.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD SETTLER\r\n\r\nMr. S---- was born in Baltimore in 1851. At the time of the gold rush\r\nto California, his father took his family and started out to seek his\r\nfortune. They had got as far as Chicago when his father was robbed and\r\nthe journey ended. Mr. S---- has lived here since. He has seen many\r\nchanges during his sixty-three years' residence in Chicago. When he came\r\nhere the city limits were Twelfth Street on the South and Chicago Avenue\r\non the North, and there were no street cars. The Negro population was\r\n175. His parents took him on Sunday to the Railway Chapel Sunday School,\r\nstarted in 1857 in two passenger cars by a Presbyterian minister, Father\r\nKent. The first building occupied by this congregation was on the site\r\nwhere the Board of Trade now stands, 141 West Jackson Boulevard. This\r\nwas destroyed in the fire of 1871. The second church was at the corner\r\nof State and Thirteenth streets, where the Fair warehouse now stands.\r\nThe next site of the church was that of the Institutional Church at\r\nThirty-eighth and Dearborn streets.\r\n\r\n_Early housing experience._--Prejudice, Mr. S---- says, was unknown in\r\nthe early days. He has lived south of Thirty-first Street for thirty-five\r\nyears. They were the first Negro family to enter the block in which they\r\nnow live. He built his home there and has been living there twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BASEBALL \"MAGNATE\"\r\n\r\nMr. G---- was born in La Grange, Texas, the son of a minister. As a boy\r\nhe worked on his father's farm, went to school, and progressed as far\r\nas the eighth grade. He was a good baseball player. He played first in\r\nForth Worth, Texas, then in New York and Philadelphia, and finally came\r\nto Chicago in 1907. The highest amount he had been able to earn was $9 a\r\nweek. His first job in Chicago netted him about $1,000 a year. In 1910\r\nhe had acquired ownership of the team, and now, at the age of forty,\r\nit nets him $15,000 a year. His team has traveled extensively, having\r\ncovered the principal cities in the United States at least twenty-five\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n_Home life._--Mrs. G---- was born in Sherman, Texas. She completed the\r\nfirst-year high school at her home. She is a modest woman and a good\r\nhousekeeper. They have two children, a son of nine and a daughter of\r\nthree. Mr. G---- has moved four times in Chicago, seeking desirable living\r\nquarters for his family. He owns a three-story brick building containing\r\nnine rooms, the house in which he now lives. In addition he owns $7,000\r\nworth of Liberty bonds and values his baseball team and other personal\r\nproperty at about $35,000.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--Both Mr. and Mrs. G---- were church members\r\nin the South. This membership is continued in Chicago. Mrs. G---- belongs\r\nto an A.M.E. church and is interested in and helps support Provident\r\nHospital and Phyllis Wheatley Home for Girls, while Mr. G---- is a\r\nmember of several fraternal orders, City Federation of Clubs, and the\r\nAppomattox Club. Their recreation is baseball and dancing, and they find\r\nentertainment in attending theaters and orchestra concerts principally\r\nin the \"Loop.\" Mr. G---- is very much interested now in a playground\r\nwhich is being established near his home and a tennis and croquet club\r\nfor young people in the same vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD RESIDENT\r\n\r\nBefore coming to Chicago in 1886 Mrs. L---- had lived in Washington and\r\nDetroit. Mr. L---- was successively a railroad porter, a night watchman,\r\nand a janitor. There are four children, three daughters and a son. Two\r\nof the daughters are married and have families. One is a dressmaker,\r\nanother a stenographer, and another an accomplished musician. The son is\r\na typist. Several years ago Mr. L---- purchased a lot near Forty-seventh\r\nStreet on Wells Street on which he built his home. In this neighborhood\r\nthe family was reared. Mr. L---- died several years ago.\r\n\r\n_Riot experience._--Although the L---- family has been living at\r\nForty-seventh and Wells streets for over thirty years, and relations\r\nbetween the family and the white neighbors in the block were cordial,\r\ngangs of hoodlums from other districts practically destroyed their\r\nproperty. The house was attacked, some of the furniture was stolen, and\r\nsome was destroyed. The heavy pieces of furniture were broken up and\r\nburned in the street. The building was so badly damaged that they were\r\nforced to move into a boarding-house for a time.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--The L---- family lived in a section of\r\nthe city in which there were few Negroes, but maintained an active\r\nrelationship with organizations of the Negro community. They are members\r\nof the A.M.E. Church and Sunday school and of two fraternal organizations.\r\nMrs. L---- is a member of the Linen Club of the Provident Hospital and\r\nis actively interested in the Old Folks Home. Miss L----, one of the\r\ndaughters, is well known in the community as a musician and composer.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\nDr. W---- and family came to Chicago in 1910. He had lived in Mexico\r\nCity until the revolution made living there hazardous. He was in good\r\ncircumstances, maintaining a comfortable household with servants. Since\r\nhe has been in Chicago he has had considerable difficulty in finding a\r\nhome in a neighborhood fit for rearing his children. He finally purchased\r\na home on Grand Boulevard which is valued at more than $25,000. It is a\r\nthree-story building with brown-stone front, ten rooms and two baths,\r\nand many works of art installed by the artist, Holslag, who formerly\r\nowned the house, and who himself painted some of the decorations. Dr.\r\nW---- has spent several thousand dollars on the furnishings.\r\n\r\n_Home life._--Besides the doctor and his family there are two other\r\nrelatives. The physician's income is adequate to maintain this\r\nestablishment and in addition two high-class automobiles. Mrs. W---- is\r\na social leader and does much entertaining. She is a patron of community\r\ndrama and attends grand opera and the leading theaters in the \"Loop.\"\r\nThey were formerly Catholics but now attend the Bahai Assembly. Dr.\r\nW---- is a member of two fraternal orders and two social clubs. Their\r\nrecreation is tennis, boating, motoring, and bathing. He is a director\r\nof the Chicago Health Society. He is an examining physician and a member\r\nof the board of directors in a life insurance company. Both are members\r\nof the Art Institute and are active in supporting the settlements and\r\nhospitals of the community.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her social duties Mrs. W---- continues the study of\r\nmusic. She is chaperon at the regular dances of a post of the American\r\nLegion held in the South Side Community Center; a member of the Library\r\nCommittee of the Y.W.C.A., and is interested in the entertainment of\r\nNegro students of the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThey are living in a neighborhood in which several bombings of homes\r\nof Negroes have occurred, but Mrs. W---- says that their relations with\r\nthe white neighbors are friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATIVE OF CHICAGO\r\n\r\nMr. C---- was born in Chicago in 1869. His grandmother was part Indian\r\nand his grandfather of Scotch extraction. The grandfather was born\r\nin Cincinnati, and was graduated from Oberlin College. His father's\r\nbrother was a personal friend of Owen Lovejoy and Wendell Phillips. In\r\nLeavenworth, Kansas, a monument had been erected to him as the first\r\nNegro captain of a volunteer company. He fought with General Buckner\r\nin New Orleans, was active as an abolitionist, and his wife was one of\r\nthe women sent to Kansas to establish schools among Negroes. She taught\r\nschool for thirty-six years and was one of the first women in the country\r\nwho were graduated as kindergarten teachers. His maternal grandfather\r\nbought a home in Chicago in 1854 and lived where the Federal Building\r\nnow stands. At the time of Mr. C----'s birth his father lived on Plymouth\r\nCourt, then called Diana Place. They lived for thirty-one years on South\r\nLa Salle Street, where they owned their home.\r\n\r\n_Economic sufficiency._--Mr. C---- is a graduate of the Chicago College of\r\nDental Surgery and practiced his profession until ill health forced him\r\ninto other fields. He has been a clerk in the county treasurer's office,\r\nassistant bookkeeper in a white bank in Memphis, which position he held\r\nfor two years, and assistant electrician for a telephone company. Now,\r\nat fifty-one, he is superintendent of the Western Exposition Company's\r\nbuilding. Twice he has lost his savings by bank failures. He lost $9,000\r\nthrough the failure of the Day and Night Bank in Memphis, Tennessee. He\r\nowns a house and lot, oil and mining stocks valued at $4,600, Liberty\r\nbonds, Thrift stamps, and carries a small bank balance. His present home\r\nis a four-room flat in a building on South State Street, which contains\r\nforty apartments and two stores. With him lives the family of his younger\r\nbrother, who has a twelve-year-old son. He is a member of the Baptist\r\nchurch and two fraternal orders. His chief recreation is swimming, and\r\nhe finds his entertainment in the \"Loop\" theaters and the city library.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MISSOURI FAMILY\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. T---- came to Chicago in 1919, the wife arriving one month\r\nbefore her husband. They had been living in St. Louis, Missouri, where\r\nMr. T---- was employed as a roller in an aluminum works. Prior to that\r\ntime he had been a houseman, and before that a teamster.\r\n\r\nThere are two children. One is fourteen years old and in the first-year\r\nhigh school, and the other is seven and in the first-grade grammar school.\r\n\r\nMrs. T---- has always been a substantial aid to her husband, and, as\r\nshe says, she \"doesn't always wait for him to bring something to her,\r\nbut goes out herself and helps to get it.\" Accordingly, when reports\r\nwere being circulated that Chicago offered good jobs and a comfortable\r\nliving, she came up to investigate while her husband held his job in\r\nSt. Louis.\r\n\r\n_Home life in Chicago._--The family lives on State Street over a store.\r\nThey have moved four times since coming to Chicago in 1919, once to be\r\nnearer work, once to get out of a neighborhood that suffered during the\r\nriot, and twice to find a more desirable neighborhood for their family.\r\nThey are not satisfied with their present home and are planning to move\r\nagain as soon as a more suitable place can be found. With them live a\r\nsister-in-law and her child, who are regarded as members of the family.\r\nThe house is in poor sanitary condition. The toilet is in the yard and\r\nused by two families. There is no bath. The sister-in-law is a music\r\nteacher but does not earn much. She pays board when she can afford it.\r\n\r\nMr. T---- is forty-seven and his wife forty-six years old. He is employed\r\nat the International Harvester Company and earns $35 a week for a\r\nnine-hour day. He consumes an hour and a half each day going to work.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. T---- lived on a farm and too far from school to attend, he\r\ntaught himself to read and write. Mrs. T---- went as far as the eighth\r\ngrade in grammar school.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--The entire family belongs to a Methodist\r\nchurch. Mr. T---- is a member of the Knights of Pythias and Mrs. T----\r\nis a member of the Sisters of the Mysterious Ten. They have no active\r\nrecreation. For amusement they attend motion-picture shows in the\r\nneighborhood. The children regularly use the playground near their home\r\nand the Twenty-sixth Street Beach.\r\n\r\n_Adjustment to Chicago._--Their most difficult adjustment has been in\r\nhousing. They think landlords should be forced to provide better homes\r\nfor the people in view of the high rents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EMBALMER\r\n\r\nMr. B---- was born in Texas, lived for a number of years in Tuskegee,\r\nAlabama, moved to Montgomery, and thence to Chicago in the summer of\r\n1906. His first position here was that of coachman for $30 a month,\r\nroom, and board. His next position was that of porter, working fifteen\r\nhours a day for $30 a week. He accumulated a small amount of money, and,\r\nwishing to enter business for himself, and not having sufficient funds\r\nto attend a specialized school, he secured a job with an embalmer and\r\nworked for him four years. In 1913 he entered the undertaking business\r\nfor himself. He is now buying a two-story brick building on a five-year\r\ncontract, to serve as a place of business and a home. The business is\r\nyoung and was begun on small capital. To establish himself he exhausted\r\nhis little bank account and sold his Liberty bonds. His equipment is\r\nstill incomplete, and he rents funeral cars and other equipment necessary\r\nfor burials.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--Both Mr. and Mrs. B---- are members of\r\nseveral local improvement clubs; they attend Friendship Baptist Church,\r\nand each belongs to three fraternal orders.\r\n\r\n_Sentiments on local conditions._--Mrs. B---- thinks the town too\r\nlarge for much friendliness. Mr. B---- believes that there should be\r\na segregated vice district. His principal objection to the present\r\nscattering of houses of prostitution is that his wife, who is frequently\r\nobliged to return home late at night, is subjected to insults from men\r\nin the neighborhood. He thinks there should be a law requiring that\r\nlandlords clean flats at least once a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YOUNG PHYSICIAN\r\n\r\nDr. C---- is a good example of the numbers of young Negro professional\r\nmen in Chicago. His office is on State Street near Thirty-fifth. He was\r\nborn in Albany, New York, and his wife in Keokuk, Iowa. They have lived\r\nin Chicago since 1915.\r\n\r\n_Early experiences in profession._--Through a civil-service examination\r\nDr. C---- secured a place as junior physician at the Municipal\r\nTuberculosis Sanitarium. At the same time he passed with high rating an\r\nexamination for interneship at the Oak Forest Infirmary. At the latter\r\nplace he was promptly rejected because of his color, and at the former\r\nhe was asked to leave nine hours after he reported for duty.\r\n\r\n_Economic status._--Dr. C---- owns a house and lot in his former home,\r\nAlbany, which he values at $14,000 and other property and stock holdings\r\nvalued at $13,000.\r\n\r\n_Education._--Dr. C---- was graduated from the Brooklyn Grammar School,\r\nthe Boys' High School of Brooklyn, and Cornell University, where he\r\nobtained his A.B. and M.D. degrees. Mrs. C---- is a graduate nurse.\r\nHe is at present an associate surgeon and chief of the dispensary of a\r\nlocal hospital.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--He has already assumed a position of\r\nleadership in the social activities of the community, is a trustee of\r\nthe new Metropolitan Church, a thirty-second degree Mason, a member\r\nof the Knights of Pythias, Chicago Medical Society, American Medical\r\nAssociation, Urban League, and a director of the Community Service, and\r\nalso an instructor at the Chicago Hospital College.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on race relations._--He believes that the recent migration\r\nof Negroes has been an advantage in teaching Chicago Negroes the value\r\nof property ownership and co-operation. He thinks the scarcity of homes\r\nfor Negroes can be relieved by allowing Negroes \"as much freedom as the\r\nAmerican dollar.\" Definite suggestions for improving conditions within\r\nthe race he gives as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Establishment of a permanent medium for understanding between the two\r\nraces--a permanent commission to act in the adjustment of difficulties\r\nof any kind. This body should be composed of Negroes and whites.\r\n\r\n2. Rigid enforcement of existing laws.\r\n\r\n3. A systematic campaign under the direction of the commission among\r\nNegroes to teach them personal hygiene.\r\n\r\n4. Negroes should join labor unions and refuse to serve as strike breakers.\r\n\r\n5. When Negroes do act as strike breakers, the doctor thinks, race\r\nfriction is created and labor is cheapened. Negroes can obtain a square\r\ndeal from the unions only when they have joined them in sufficient\r\nnumbers to demand justice by becoming an important factor in the unions.\r\nIf they are not permitted in certain unions they should form groups of\r\ntheir own for collective bargaining.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YOUNG LAWYER\r\n\r\nNumbers of young Negro lawyers are establishing themselves in Chicago, and\r\ntheir influence already is being felt in the community. A good example\r\nof this group is Mr. J----, who, although only twenty-eight years old,\r\nhas been actively practicing law six years. He was born in Kentucky and\r\nhas lived in Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, New York, and Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n_Education._--He completed high school in Kansas, graduated from Oberlin\r\nCollege, and then went to Columbia University, New York, and received\r\nthe degrees of Master of Arts and Bachelor of Laws. His wife completed\r\nthe junior year in college in New York, studied art in New York City,\r\nand is skilled in china painting.\r\n\r\n_Home life._--Mr. and Mrs. J---- have one child of four years. They live\r\nin one of the 1,400 buildings owned by a real estate man of that district\r\nwho \"notoriously neglects his property.\" The struggle to establish\r\nhimself during the first few years in Chicago was difficult. Now Mr.\r\nJ---- has the confidence of a large number of people, and a clientèle\r\nwhich provides a comfortable income.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--Mr. J---- is a trustee of the institutional\r\nA.M.E. Church, chairman of the United Political League, member of the\r\nY.M.C.A., Knights of Pythias, a Greek-letter fraternity and the Urban\r\nLeague, and is a member of the Executive Committee of the Friends of\r\nNegro Freedom.\r\n\r\n_Civic consciousness._--He thinks that if working Negroes and working\r\nwhite men can be led to regard one another as workingmen interested in\r\nthe same cause the color question will be forgotten. He believes that\r\nprejudice is based on the economic system. With respect to housing he\r\nthinks a Negro should, as an American citizen, be free to purchase real\r\nestate wherever he is able to make a purchase; that as long as artificial\r\nbarriers are set up there can be no successful solution of the color\r\nquestion; that a man's respect for the rights of others increases in\r\nproportion to his intelligence, and that the press can be a great source\r\nof evil or good in educating the people. He believes that there should\r\nbe clubs and educational meetings to instruct some of the less refined\r\nclasses of Negroes in conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MIGRANT PROFESSIONAL MAN\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. F---- lived in Jackson, Mississippi, until 1917, the year\r\nof the migration, when they moved to Chicago. He followed his clientèle\r\nand established an office on State Street near Thirty-first Street.\r\nMr. F---- received his commercial and legal training at Jackson College\r\nand Walden University. Mrs. F---- is a graduate of Rust College and the\r\nUniversity of Chicago.\r\n\r\n_Home life._--The F---- home evidences their economic independence. It\r\ncontains ten rooms and bath and is kept in excellent condition. They own\r\nsix houses in the South, from which they receive an income. Mr. F---- is\r\nthe president of an insurance company incorporated in Illinois in 1918,\r\nwhich has a membership of 12,000. He has also organized a mercantile\r\ncompany, grocery and market on State Street, incorporated for $10,000,\r\nof which $7,000 has been paid.\r\n\r\nThey have two sons, nineteen and twelve years of age, and three adult\r\nnephews living with them. One nephew is a painter at the Stock Yards,\r\nanother is a laborer, and the third a shipping-clerk.\r\n\r\n_Community participation._--They are members of the Baptist church and\r\nof the People's Movement, while Mr. F---- is a member of the Appomattox\r\nClub, an organization of leading Negro business and professional men.\r\nIn addition to membership in three fraternal organizations, they are\r\ninterested in and contribute to the support of the Urban League and\r\nUnited Charities.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on race relations._--Concerning housing, Mr. F---- feels that\r\nsome corporation should build medium-sized cottages for workingmen. He\r\nthinks that the changes in labor conditions make it hard for Negroes to\r\ngrasp immediately the northern industrial methods. Patience will help\r\ntoward adjustment, he thinks.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that colored women receive better protection in Chicago than\r\nin the South. His experience in the courts leads him to believe that\r\nNegroes have a fairer chance here than in the South. Agitation by the\r\npress in his opinion can have no other effect than to make conditions\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF NEGRO HOUSING\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this section of the report is to describe by a selection\r\nof types the physical condition of houses occupied as residences by\r\nNegroes. This description includes the structure, age, repair, upkeep,\r\nand other factors directly affecting the appearance, sanitation, and\r\ncomfort of dwellings available for Negro use.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy included Negro\r\nhousing in a series of general housing studies. This study was confined\r\nto the two largest areas of Negro residence, those on the South and West\r\nsides. Both of these were studied generally, and in each a selected area,\r\nof four blocks in one case and three blocks in the other, was studied\r\nintensively.\r\n\r\nThe South Side area included parts of the Second, Third, and Thirteenth\r\nwards between Fifteenth and Fifty-fifth streets, with State Street as\r\nthe main thoroughfare. The four blocks bounded by Dearborn Street,\r\nTwenty-seventh Street, Armour Avenue, and Thirty-second Street were\r\nintensively studied. It was found that within these four blocks 94 per\r\ncent of the heads of families were Negroes. The buildings were one- and\r\ntwo-story, with a considerable amount of vacant space in the lots. Half\r\nthe lots had less than 50 per cent of their space covered. The houses were\r\nfor the most part intended for single families but had been converted\r\ninto two-flat buildings. Rooms were poorly lighted and ventilated, the\r\nsanitation bad, and the alley and grounds about the houses covered with\r\nrubbish and refuse.\r\n\r\nComparisons with other districts studied showed the following: Of houses\r\nin a Polish district, 71 per cent were in good repair; in a Bohemian\r\ndistrict, 57 per cent; Stock Yards district, 54 per cent; Jewish and\r\nSouth Chicago districts, 28 per cent; and in the Negro district, 26 per\r\ncent. A study made three years later by the School of Civics covering the\r\nsame area showed a decrease of 16 per cent of buildings in good repair.\r\nFive buildings had been closed by the Department of Health as no longer\r\nfit for habitation. There were leaks in the roofs, sinks, and windows\r\nof five-sixths of the dwellings. In describing a typical house in this\r\narea, the report said:\r\n\r\n     There was no gutter and the roof leaked in two places, the sink\r\n     drain in the basement leaked, keeping it continually damp,\r\n     the opening of the chimney let the rain come down there, the\r\n     windowpane in front rattled from lack of putty. The conditions\r\n     in these houses are typical; almost every tenant tells of\r\n     rain coming in through roof, chimney or windows, and cases\r\n     of fallen plaster and windows without putty were too common\r\n     to be noted. One aspect of the situation that should not be\r\n     overlooked is the impossibility of putting these old houses in\r\n     good condition. Leaks may be repaired, plaster may be replaced,\r\n     windows may be made tight, and these things would certainly\r\n     improve most of the houses, but when all were done it would\r\n     not alter the fact that these are old houses, poorly built,\r\n     through which the wind can blow at will.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TYPES OF NEGRO HOUSING]\r\n\r\nLack of repairs to the houses in the \"Black Belt\" is accounted for by\r\nthe fact that owners do not regard the buildings as worth repairing, and\r\nthat tenants can always be found, even though it is necessary to reduce\r\nrents somewhat. This reduction is indeed notable. The School of Civics\r\nfound that while in 1909 50 per cent of the houses examined on the South\r\nSide rented for as much as $16 a month, in 1917 only 13 per cent could\r\ncommand as high a rental as that; that in 1909 the prevailing rents were\r\n$15 and $16 as against $10 and $12 in 1917.\r\n\r\nOn the West Side the area studied generally was that bounded by Lake\r\nStreet, Ashland, Austin, and Western avenues. Here the situation was\r\nlittle better. One-third of the families visited in the three selected\r\nblocks bounded by Fulton and Paulina streets, Carroll Avenue and Robey\r\nStreet were Negroes. The remaining two-thirds represented sixteen\r\nnationalities. It was reported that the white residents could get\r\nadvantages and improvements for their houses that a Negro could not.\r\nWhile 35 per cent of the houses were reported in good repair, 31 per\r\ncent were described as \"absolutely dilapidated\" and in a worse state\r\nof repair than those in any other districts studied except the Jewish\r\ndistrict. The report said:\r\n\r\n     Broken-down doors, unsteady flooring, and general dilapidation\r\n     were met by the investigators at every side. Windowpanes were\r\n     out, doors hanging on single hinges or entirely fallen off,\r\n     and roofs rotting and leaking. Colored tenants reported that\r\n     they found it impossible to persuade their landlords either\r\n     to make the necessary repairs or to release them from their\r\n     contracts; and that it was so hard to find better places in\r\n     which to live that they were forced either to make the repairs\r\n     themselves, which they could rarely afford to do, or to endure\r\n     the conditions as best they might. Several tenants ascribed\r\n     cases of severe and prolonged illness to the unhealthful\r\n     condition of the houses in which they were living.\r\n\r\nThat there was a continuing demand even for the shacks and shanties of\r\nthe \"Black Belt\" is evidenced in a report made by the Urban League of\r\nChicago in 1917 that only one out of every thirteen Negro applicants\r\nfor houses to rent could be supplied. At the height of the demand\r\napplications for houses were coming in at the rate of 460 to 600 a day,\r\nand only ninety-nine were available for renting purposes. This was due,\r\nof course, to the growing stream of Negroes arriving daily from the South.\r\n\r\nCovering the same area on the South Side as that studied by the School\r\nof Civics in 1917 a canvass was also made in 1917 by Caswell W. Crews, a\r\nstudent at the University of Chicago. He found that tenants had remained\r\nin these dwellings in some instances as long as twenty years after their\r\nunfitness had become evident, because the rent was low and they could\r\nfind nowhere else to go. He mentioned the mass of migrants from the South\r\nwho, because of their ignorance of conditions in Chicago as to what was\r\ndesirable and what was to be had for a given sum, fell an easy prey to\r\nunscrupulous owners and agents. Mr. Crew's description said:\r\n\r\n     With the exception of two or three the houses are frame, and\r\n     paint with them is a dim reminiscence. There is one rather\r\n     modern seven-room flat building of stone front, the flats\r\n     renting at $22.50 a month and offering the best in the way of\r\n     accommodations to be found there. There is another makeshift\r\n     flat building situated above a saloon and pool hall, consisting\r\n     of six six-room flats, renting at $12 per month, but in a very\r\n     poor condition of repair. Toilets and baths were found to be\r\n     in no condition for use and the plumbing in such a state as to\r\n     constantly menace health. Practically all of the houses have\r\n     been so reconstructed as to serve as flats, accommodating two\r\n     and sometimes three families. As a rule there are four, five,\r\n     and sometimes six rooms in each flat, there being but five\r\n     instances when there were more than six. It is often the case\r\n     that of these rooms not all can be used because of dampness,\r\n     leaking roofs, or defective toilets overhead.\r\n\r\n     The owners are in most instances scarcely better off than\r\n     their tenants and can ill afford to make repairs. One house\r\n     in the rear of another on Federal Street near Twenty-seventh\r\n     had every door off its hinges, water covering the floor from\r\n     a defective sink, and windowpanes out. A cleaning of the house\r\n     had been attempted, and the cleaners had torn loose what paper\r\n     yielded readily and proceeded to whitewash over the adhering\r\n     portion which constituted the majority of the paper. There\r\n     were four such rooms and for them the family paid $7 a month.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 a cursory examination by investigators from the Commission showed\r\nthat the only change in the situation was further deterioration in the\r\nphysical state of the dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the Negro population across State Street eastward into\r\nthe area once occupied by wealthy whites began as early as 1910. Wabash\r\nAvenue was the first street into which they moved. Gradually they\r\nscattered farther east toward Lake Michigan. Following the migration\r\nfrom the South the Negro area east of State Street expanded to the lake\r\nand pushed southward. The houses which they found in the new territory,\r\nalthough from twenty to forty years old, were a vast improvement over\r\nthose they had left west of State Street. These houses do not permit of\r\nany general classification, for some are very bad while others, though\r\nnot new, are in a state of good repair, largely according to the care\r\ntaken by previous occupants. Along with descriptions of Negro homes must\r\nbe considered the tendency among those Negroes who were able to move\r\naway from the congested areas of Negro residence. Some of the best houses\r\noccupied by Negroes in 1920 were in districts until recently wholly white.\r\n\r\nA rough classification of Negro housing according to types, ranging from\r\nthe best, designated as \"Type A,\" to the poorest, designated as \"Type\r\nD,\" was made by the Commission on the basis of a block survey comprising\r\n238 blocks, covering all the main areas of Negro residence, and data\r\nconcerning 274 families, scattered through these 238 blocks, one or two\r\nto a block, whose histories and housing experiences were intensively\r\nstudied by the Commission's investigators. Approximately 5 per cent of\r\nChicago's Negro population live in \"Type A\" houses, 10 per cent in \"Type\r\nB,\" 40 per cent in \"Type C,\" and 45 per cent in the poorest, \"Type D.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI. \"TYPE A\" HOUSES\r\n\r\nType A houses, with those of the other types, were not concentrated wholly\r\nin any one section but were found widely scattered; there were none,\r\nhowever, in the areas which in 1910 held practically the whole Negro\r\npopulation. Examples of Type A were found on South Park Avenue between\r\nThirty-third and Thirty-fifth streets, where some Negroes had lived for\r\nsix years; on Grand Boulevard between Thirty-fifth and Thirty-eighth\r\nstreets, where a few had lived for three years; on Champlain, Evans,\r\nVincennes, and Langley avenues, between Forty-third and Forty-seventh\r\nstreets, where some Negroes had lived four and five years; and on Wabash\r\nAvenue between Fifty-first and Fifty-third streets. In Woodlawn there\r\nare a few of recent occupancy, one of which was built by its Negro owner.\r\n\r\nMost of the Type A dwellings are of substantial construction, principally\r\nof brick and stone. Some are old family residences in formerly high-class\r\nneighborhoods, built to withstand the test of years. Consequently,\r\nalthough they have been subject to the usual deterioration, they still\r\nafford a fairly high standard of comfort and convenience. Some are large\r\nand exceptionally well equipped with luxurious fittings and adornments\r\ninstalled by former owners. Most of these houses were built and owned\r\nby people of wealth who abandoned them. Many of them have since passed\r\nthrough several stages of occupancy. Somewhat less permanent in their\r\nphysical aspects perhaps are the Type A houses in Woodlawn. Many of\r\nthe houses in this district are of frame structure, and they are not\r\nas commodious as those in the formerly fashionable white districts. But\r\nthey provide a desirable measure of comfort, with less waste space and\r\nsuperfluous rooms.\r\n\r\n_Comforts and conveniences._--Type A dwellings are fitted with all\r\nthe conveniences required by well-to-do whites. Some of them have more\r\nthan the customary one bathroom, have electricity and gas, and are well\r\nheated by steam or hot-air furnaces. One example of Type A housing is\r\na three-story, stone-front, ten-room house on South Park Avenue owned\r\nand occupied by a lawyer and his family. There is a garage, and the\r\nplace is kept in good condition. A twelve-room house, also on South\r\nPark Avenue, owned and occupied by a physician and his family, has two\r\nbathrooms, steam heat, and electricity, and is in excellent repair.\r\nAnother physician on the same street owns a three-story brown-stone\r\nhouse, with a garage. It contains ten rooms and two bathrooms, has steam\r\nheat and electric lights, and is in good condition. For this property\r\nhe paid $35,000. A three-story brick house on Vernon Avenue is owned\r\nand occupied by a business man. In addition to other modern conveniences\r\nthere are lavatories in four of the bedrooms. The house is in excellent\r\ncondition. A nine-room house on Langley Avenue, in good repair, owned\r\nby another business man, has gas, furnace heat, and a bathroom.\r\n\r\n_The occupants._--Although these buildings are occupied by the wealthier\r\nNegroes, business or professional men, it often happens that others\r\nsecure and occupy such houses. High wages during the war and immediately\r\nafterward permitted some Negroes who arrived in Chicago during the\r\nmigration to live in the best class of housing available for Negroes.\r\nFor example, an undertaker owns such a house on Langley Avenue, with\r\nseven rooms, with gas, a bathroom, electricity, and hot-water heat. This\r\nbuilding is ornate and in excellent repair. A postal clerk who has been\r\nin Chicago since 1897 owns a seven-room house on Champlain Avenue south\r\nof Sixty-sixth Street, where he lives with his wife and child. In the\r\nblock south of Forty-third Street on Prairie Avenue is a nine-room house\r\noccupied by an employee of the American Express Company. In order to\r\nhelp pay the rent, four lodgers are taken, who together pay $20 a week.\r\nThe house, which includes a bathroom, is furnace-heated and lighted by\r\nelectricity. A transfer man pays $65 a month rent for an eight-room house\r\nof this class on Bowen Avenue. He earns $35 a week, and two lodgers pay\r\n$50 a month. The house has bath, electricity, and furnace. A railroad\r\nporter, who has been a doctor's assistant and has lived in Chicago since\r\n1886, owns a house on Rhodes Avenue near Sixty-sixth Street. It has seven\r\nrooms and is provided with a furnace, gas, bathroom, and electricity.\r\n\r\n_Neighborhood conditions._--Surroundings of Type A houses are generally\r\nfar more pleasant than those in areas where the majority of Negroes live.\r\nThe streets and alleys are usually clean, except where Type A houses are\r\nin neighborhoods surrounded by poorer houses. The premises are generally\r\nwell kept. This is especially true where the occupants are owners. When\r\nspace permits, there is a lawn or a garden that shows signs of pride and\r\nattention. One block was noted, however, where the residents reported\r\nthat the street was watered twice a day until Negroes moved in, after\r\nwhich it received no such attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. \"TYPE B\" HOUSES\r\n\r\nType B designates a class of houses which have not the size, durability,\r\npermanence, architectural embellishments, or general standard of comfort\r\nand convenience of those classed as Type A. They are usually flat\r\nbuildings, whether originally intended for that purpose or not. Frequently\r\ndwellings are rearranged by landlords, when Negroes are given occupancy,\r\nto accommodate two or more families in place of the one for which they\r\nwere built. Type B houses have less floor space, the average number of\r\nrooms is fewer, and they have, as a rule, fewer modern conveniences.\r\nStill, they are good houses and much superior to the habitations in\r\nwhich Negroes are most often found.\r\n\r\nOccupants of Type B houses are frequently found to be clerical workers,\r\npostal clerks, railway mail clerks, small tradesmen, artisans, and\r\nbetter-paid workers in steel mills and Stock Yards.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOMES OWNED BY NEGROES ON SOUTH PARK AVENUE\r\n   Classified in text as \"Type A.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AN ABANDONED RESIDENCE IN THE PRAIRIE AVENUE BLOCK WITH\r\n   A FACTORY IN THE REAR]\r\n\r\nMost of the houses in the part of Woodlawn inhabited by Negroes are of\r\nType B. Another district in which this type of house is found extends from\r\nFortieth to Forty-seventh streets on Langley, Evans, Champlain, Vincennes,\r\nand St. Lawrence avenues. Although in this area a few dwellings are of\r\nType A, the greater part of them fall under Type B. About 5 per cent of\r\nthe dwellings occupied by Negroes on the West Side--for example, some of\r\nthose on Oakley and Washington boulevards--might also be classed as Type\r\nB. Brick or stone dwellings predominate in the districts where this type\r\nis found. For example, the block survey made by the Commission covered\r\ntwelve blocks in the Negro residence in Woodlawn on which there were 190\r\nbrick or stone and 119 frame houses. Practically all the Type B dwellings\r\nare one- and two-family houses, and the majority are two-family houses.\r\nThe Commission's study shows that these dwellings are not overcrowded\r\nand house their families comfortably. Many of the occupants own their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n_Comforts and conveniences._--Most of these houses have baths, electric\r\nlights, steam, hot-water or hot-air heating, and gas for cooking. Only a\r\nfew are heated by stoves or lack electrical fixtures. They were found to\r\nbe in good repair, well kept and clean. Special pride is taken by home\r\nowners of this class in keeping the property presentable and preventing\r\nrapid deterioration. Family histories reveal that most of the Woodlawn\r\nresidents are long-time residents of Chicago.\r\n\r\n_Neighborhood conditions._--In the neighborhoods where Type B houses\r\nwere found, no uniform standard of cleanliness was evident in streets\r\nand alleys or in adjoining properties. They were as frequently unkempt\r\nas tidy. Although the premises of Type B houses were generally kept\r\nneat, surrounding untidiness often detracted from their appearance. But\r\na block containing a majority of this type usually had an appearance\r\nof being better kept, whether the surrounding property was occupied by\r\nwhites or Negroes. In the Woodlawn area the surroundings of the houses\r\nwere well cared for, and sanitary measures were commonly observed. In\r\nsome blocks in the Langley Avenue neighborhood carelessness and neglect\r\nwere evident. Vacant lots were no more littered with rubbish than in\r\nwhite areas of a similar grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. \"TYPE C\" HOUSES\r\n\r\nType C houses are the most common in areas of Negro residence. In this\r\nclassification are included about 50 per cent of the houses on the South\r\nSide east of State Street, most of those in the North Side area, about\r\n60 per cent of those in the West Side area, practically all those in\r\nthe Ogden Park area, and many dwellings in the little Lake Park district.\r\n\r\nHeads of families occupying Type C houses were usually unskilled\r\nwage-earners, or in personal service. Their incomes were such that they\r\ncould rarely afford more than $20 a month rent.\r\n\r\n_Types of houses._--Eleven blocks on the North Side were included in\r\nthe Commission's block survey. In these blocks 146 of the buildings were\r\nof brick or stone, and 123 frame. Fifteen were single houses, four were\r\ndouble, and 167 housed three or more families, the largest proportion of\r\nsuch buildings in any district examined. There were also four rows of\r\nhouses. They were in a fair state of repair. Four-room houses or flats\r\npredominated among the fourteen families whose histories were taken. In\r\none instance seven persons were living in four rooms, in another nine\r\npersons were living in seven rooms, in another eleven persons were living\r\nin seven rooms. The dwellings were mainly one- and two-story buildings,\r\nwith a few three- and six-flat buildings.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of buildings housing three or more families was found\r\nalso in Ogden Park. In eleven blocks there were 109 such buildings. There\r\nwere also sixty-eight single and no double houses. The frame buildings\r\nnumbered 189, and brick or stone forty-eight. Most of the houses were\r\none- and two-story frame buildings. The majority were in good or fair\r\nrepair, though one block showed gross neglect of repairs to exteriors,\r\nand practically all needed painting. Five-room dwellings predominated\r\namong the fifteen families whose histories were recorded. Overcrowding\r\nwas frequent. In one instance eleven persons lived in five rooms; in\r\nanother nine persons in five rooms.\r\n\r\nIn the part of the South Side area east of State Street and between\r\nTwenty-second and Thirty-first streets forty-two blocks were surveyed.\r\nMichigan, Indiana, and Prairie avenues have excellent dwellings,\r\npractically all of which are still occupied by whites. Until a few\r\nyears ago these were fashionable residential streets, and the buildings\r\nare large, well built, and often ornate. Surrounding them, however,\r\nare hundreds of houses, old and difficult to keep in repair. In these\r\nforty-two blocks there were 767 buildings of which 163 were frame and\r\n604 brick. About 37 per cent of these are of Type C.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of these buildings appear in brief comments on some of\r\nthese blocks, taken from investigator's notes, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Property has been allowed to run down.\r\n\r\n     Five vacant houses; yards full of rubbish; lodgers transient;\r\n     families do not move.\r\n\r\n     Vacant lot dirty.\r\n\r\n     Two vacant lots; yards well kept.\r\n\r\n     Garbage piled up on vacant lot; Negroes moving in.\r\n\r\n     Roomers move often; one poolroom; empty church building.\r\n\r\n     Vacant lot used as dump; yards well kept.\r\n\r\n     Two vacant houses robbed of plumbing fixtures.\r\n\r\n     Yards poorly kept; whites moved out three years ago, except\r\n     one family.\r\n\r\n     Vacant lot used as dump; one poolroom, two hotels; yards well\r\n     kept; Negroes moving in.\r\n\r\n     Yards unkempt; mostly renters.\r\n\r\n     Formerly questionable houses for whites.\r\n\r\n     Mostly newcomers; property run down.\r\n\r\n     Yards well kept; boarding-houses.\r\n\r\n     People move in because they can't find anything better.\r\n\r\nBetween Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets east of State Street\r\nseventy-eight blocks were surveyed. There were seventy-eight frame and\r\n1,523 brick and stone buildings, 620 single houses, 559 double, 254\r\naccommodating three or more families, and nine apartment houses. Of this\r\ngroup 51 per cent were of Type C. The property and general surroundings\r\nshowed age and the beginning of rapid deterioration everywhere; in some\r\ncases there had been attempts to care for the premises and in some cases\r\nneglect was obvious. The streets, except Michigan Avenue and South Park\r\nBoulevard, showed much neglect, and the alleys generally were dirty.\r\nMany of these houses were occupied by their Negro owners. Negroes were\r\nfound to occupy about 40 per cent of these Type C houses.\r\n\r\n_Conveniences._--In these two parts of the South Side area conveniences\r\nand ordinary sanitary facilities are often absent. Gas is the common\r\nform of lighting, and often it is not used. Family-history data revealed\r\nthat there were about as many homes without as with bathrooms. In a\r\nlarge number of buildings families were obliged to use common toilets\r\nlocated in halls or back yards. The dwellings were out of repair in\r\nsome respects in nearly every instance. Defects of this kind were often\r\nin the plumbing. Leaky toilets or water pipes were common complaints.\r\nSome toilets did not flush. Some sinks were leaky, as were some of the\r\nroofs. In some houses windows or doors were broken, loose, or sagging.\r\nSome houses were very dirty.\r\n\r\nOn the West Side a situation not essentially different was found among\r\nthe Type C dwellings. Possibly baths were a little more frequent.\r\nOccasionally there was a furnace, though stove heat was most common.\r\nGas was the usual means of lighting. The situation as to toilets was\r\nabout the same, and the buildings, being chiefly old, were usually out\r\nof repair in some respect. The number of brick and frame dwellings was\r\nabout equal. There were more double houses in proportion to the single\r\nones, and none that had three or more families. Five-room dwellings were\r\nmost numerous, and there was little indication of overcrowding.\r\n\r\n_Neighborhood conditions._--Only two blocks in the West Side area were\r\nrated as merely \"fair,\" four in the North Side area were dirty, while\r\nonly one in the Ogden Park area was not cleaned. In the North Side and\r\nOgden Park areas distinct efforts were observed to keep yards clean.\r\nPremises showed signs of care and attention, though an occasional vacant\r\nlot showed use for dumping. Alleys in all three districts gave evidence\r\nof neglect. Some were badly littered with garbage and rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. \"TYPE D\" HOUSES\r\n\r\nType D housing is the least habitable of all. The houses were usually\r\ndilapidated, and in many cases extremely so. Most of the buildings are\r\namong the oldest in the city. They were occupied only by Negroes at the\r\nfoot of the economic scale, many families living from hand to mouth,\r\nfrequently in extreme poverty.\r\n\r\nThis class of houses predominates in those parts of the South Side\r\narea from Twelfth to Twenty-second Street along State Street and Wabash\r\nAvenue, and from Twelfth to Thirty-ninth streets and Wentworth Avenue.\r\nMany Negro dwellings in the North Side area and about 35 or 40 per cent\r\nof those in the West Side area were of Type D. Even in the area of the\r\nSouth Side between State Street and Lake Michigan many of the older\r\nframe and brick buildings fall into this classification. It is safe to\r\nsay that 43 per cent of the housing for Negroes is of this type.\r\n\r\nMost of these dwellings were frail, flimsy, tottering, unkempt, and some\r\nof them literally falling apart. Little repairing is done from year to\r\nyear. Consequently their state grows progressively worse, and they are\r\nnow even less habitable than when the surveys quoted at the beginning of\r\nthis section were made. The surroundings in these localities were in a\r\ncondition of extreme neglect, with little apparent effort to observe the\r\nlaws of sanitation. Streets, alleys, and vacant lots contained garbage,\r\nrubbish, and litter of all kinds. It is difficult to enforce health\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nAlthough there has been protest by Negroes against the necessity of\r\nliving in places so uncomfortable and unhealthful, improvement comes\r\nslowly. Contentment with such insanitary conditions is usually due to\r\nignorance of better living. For the poorest buildings low rents are\r\noffered to encourage continued occupancy and to forestall requests for\r\nrepairs. Prompt vacating of many of these houses usually follows when\r\na family can secure better accommodations in a better neighborhood.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nAmong the more intelligent Negroes neighborhood organizations were found\r\nsimilar to those of white people. Dissatisfaction with local conditions,\r\nfailure of authorities to sweep and sprinkle streets or to provide\r\nadequate street lighting, corner signs, and similar equipment usually\r\nprompt these efforts. Three or four such societies have been instituted\r\nby Negroes in Chicago. One example is the Middlesex Improvement Club,\r\norganized following the riots of 1919 in a neighborhood including three\r\nblocks on Dearborn Street near Fiftieth. Among other things it seeks to\r\npromote a friendly spirit among the people of both races in a neighborhood\r\nwhich was turbulent during the riots. It has extended some financial\r\naid to its members when required. It is financed by Negro business men\r\nwith some help from white business men of the locality.\r\n\r\nWoodlawn has a community organization which reflects the friendly\r\nattitude between the races in that district. Both whites and Negroes\r\nare members, with a common community interest. This organization goes\r\nsomewhat beyond the usual neighborhood improvement association in scope\r\nand purpose. While it embodies the usual purposes, it also seeks to induce\r\nfull use by all the people of the district of all public and semi-public\r\ninstitutions that contribute to good citizenship. One of the notices\r\nsent out by the association urged attendance at night sessions of public\r\nschools. It briefly set forth the advantages for both young and older\r\npeople, suggesting that their usefulness to the community might thus\r\nbe enlarged, that they might be trained for profitable employment, and\r\nincidentally that young people could be kept off the streets and away\r\nfrom demoralizing places. Attention was drawn to the fact that \"business\r\nmen of the city are seeking young people, both colored and white, for\r\npositions as stenographers, clerks, and trades people.\" The notice closed\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     We are desirous that you use your influence to maintain a\r\n     spirit of friendliness and good will among all citizens, white\r\n     and black, and especially among the school children, paying\r\n     especial attention to the conduct of pupils to and from school.\r\n     We earnestly seek your co-operation in these matters.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Fifty-sixth Street and Wabash Avenue is another\r\nof these neighborhood leagues; all the members are Negroes. Meetings\r\ntake place periodically at the houses of members, and special attention\r\nis given to such matters as the condition of their premises, care of\r\nlawns, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. EFFORTS OF SOCIAL AGENCIES\r\n\r\nSocial agencies likewise have given considerable attention to the\r\ninstruction and encouragement of Negroes in better living. While this\r\neffort has been directed mainly to the newer arrivals from the South,\r\nit has also had an effect on many who have lived in the city for some\r\ntime but have not yet adjusted themselves to city life and more rigid\r\nstandards of sanitation and deportment.\r\n\r\nOne of these agencies is the Urban League. Among other activities\r\nit issued placards to be kept in sight in Negro homes, graphically\r\ncontrasting good and bad habits of living. Pictures showed the front\r\nporch of a Negro family as it should and should not be used, with the\r\npointed question, \"Which?\" underneath. Then followed a sort of pledge\r\nof conduct:\r\n\r\n     _I realize_ that our soldiers have learned _new habits of\r\n     self-respect and cleanliness_.\r\n\r\n     _I desire_ to help bring about a _new order of living_ in this\r\n     community.\r\n\r\n     _I will attend_ to the neatness of my personal appearance on\r\n     the street or when sitting in front doorways.\r\n\r\n     _I will refrain_ from wearing dust caps, bungalow aprons,\r\n     house clothing, and bedroom shoes out of doors.\r\n\r\n     _I will arrange my toilet_ within doors and not on the front\r\n     porch.\r\n\r\n     _I will insist_ upon the use of rear entrances for coal dealers,\r\n     hucksters, etc.\r\n\r\n     _I will refrain_ from loud talking and objectionable deportment\r\n     on street cars and in public places.\r\n\r\n     _I will do my best_ to prevent defacement of property either\r\n     by children or adults.\r\n\r\nThe guidance and instruction given by the South Side Community Service,\r\npastors of churches and Negro newspapers have stimulated the Negro\r\npopulation to efforts at improvement of their property. One newspaper, for\r\nexample, conducted a column containing hints on cleanliness, sanitation,\r\nand deportment. It printed items concerning objectionable conditions\r\nat given addresses and warned offenders that they were being watched by\r\nthe neighborhood organization, which might take action against them if\r\nthey did not improve their conduct.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which Negroes have been led to understand that habits of\r\norderliness and cleanliness are expected of them in Chicago has been\r\nthrough a \"Clean-up Week\" in the spring of each year, when concerted\r\nefforts are made to collect and dispose of tin cans and other rubbish\r\non vacant lots and yards. A \"Tin Can Contest\" was conducted by the\r\nWabash Avenue Y.M.C.A., which offered prizes to the children collecting\r\nthe greatest number of tin cans beyond 300. The 1,000 youngsters who\r\nparticipated in the Second Ward were divided into eight regiments. The\r\neleven-year-old Negro girl who collected the greatest number of tin cans\r\nhad a total of 6,840 to her credit. Next in order was Hyman Friedman,\r\nwhose total was 5,347. More than 100,000 tin cans in all were obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDERS\r\n\r\nIndividual householders, especially those owning their homes, were\r\nfound to be trying to keep their premises presentable often in the face\r\nof discouraging odds. Throughout the family histories appear repeated\r\nprotests by tenants at the failure of landlords to maintain a decent\r\nstate of repairs and improvements.\r\n\r\nNone of the houses occupied by Negroes are of as high a standard,\r\ngenerally speaking, as those occupied by whites of a similar economic\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nNegroes rarely live in new houses. Virtually all live in neighborhoods\r\nwhere the housing is old. Negro houses, even of the best class, were built\r\nfrom twenty to forty years ago. Conditions in these old neighborhoods\r\ndo not make for high standards of sanitation and cleanliness, nor the\r\nbest habits of living generally; and Negroes labor under a handicap in\r\nstriving to attain such standards.\r\n\r\nLess attention is paid by public authorities to the condition of streets\r\nand alleys in such neighborhoods than in localities where the housing is\r\nof a higher grade. The streets are not cleaned and sprinkled as often and\r\nthe alleys are more likely to be dirty, unpaved, and generally uncared\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nIn most of the localities where Negroes live, buildings that have not\r\nalready reached a state of great dilapidation are deteriorating rapidly\r\nbecause of the failure of owners to make repairs and improvements.\r\n\r\nEscape from undesirable housing conditions is difficult for any Negroes,\r\nand for the vast majority it is practically impossible, particularly\r\nduring a period of acute general housing shortage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOMES OCCUPIED AND IN PART OWNED BY NEGROES\r\n   Classified in the text as \"Type B.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nC. NEGROES AND PROPERTY DEPRECIATION\r\n\r\nNo single factor has complicated the relations of Negroes and whites\r\nin Chicago more than the widespread feeling of white people that the\r\npresence of Negroes in a neighborhood is a cause of serious depreciation\r\nof property values. To the extent that people feel that their financial\r\ninterests are affected, antagonisms are accentuated.\r\n\r\nWhen a Negro family moves into a block in which all other families are\r\nwhite, the neighbors object. This objection may express itself in studied\r\naloofness, in taunts, warnings, slurs, threats, or even the bombing of\r\ntheir homes.[24] White neighbors who can do so are likely to move away at\r\nthe first opportunity. Assessors and appraisers in determining the value\r\nof the property take account of this general dislike of the presence or\r\nproximity of Negroes. It matters little what type of citizens the Negro\r\nfamily may represent, what their wealth or standing in the community\r\nis, or that their motive in moving into a predominant white neighborhood\r\nis to secure better living conditions--their appearance is a signal of\r\ndepreciation. So it happens that when a Negro family moves into a block,\r\nmost of the white neighbors show resentment toward both the Negro family\r\nand the owner or agent who rents or sells the property. Whites owning\r\nhomes in the neighborhood become much exercised by fear of loss both\r\nof money and of neighborhood exclusiveness and desirability. The Negro\r\nsuffers under the realization that, for reasons which he cannot control,\r\nhe is considered undesirable and a menace to property values. Wherever\r\nNegroes have moved in Chicago this odium has attached to their presence.\r\nThe belief that they destroy property values wherever they go is now\r\ncommonly taken as a valid explanation of any unfriendliness toward the\r\nentire group. This feeling takes on the strength of a protective instinct\r\namong the whites.\r\n\r\nSo wide and menacing, indeed, has this feeling grown that the Commission\r\ndeemed it necessary to make a thorough inquiry into its basis and to\r\ndetermine, if possible, to what degree the presence of Negroes is a\r\nfactor in the depreciation of property values. Therefore it is essential\r\nto distinguish clearly between: (1) general factors in depreciation;\r\nand (2) presence of Negroes as an influence in these factors, and also\r\nas a direct factor.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by \"depreciation\"? Real estate men know it as \"a loss in\r\nmarket value.\" Market value is \"the price which a buyer who wishes to\r\nbuy but is not forced to buy will pay to an owner who wishes to sell but\r\nis not forced to sell.\" Depreciation is reflected, not only in market\r\nvalues, but also in appraised or assessed valuations. Before purchasing\r\nproperty it is customary to take into account the surrounding conditions\r\nthat affect its value, as well as its inherent value. Assessed valuations,\r\nfixed for taxing purposes by authorized public officials, fluctuate to\r\nsome extent in harmony with appraised valuations. This analysis of the\r\nfactors that tend to determine the value of real estate for one purpose\r\nor another gives a fairly dependable rule for finding whether it has\r\nrisen or fallen in a given period. If property is thus shown to have\r\ndecreased in value, it is said to have depreciated.\r\n\r\nThe value of real estate is determined largely by the human factors\r\ninvolved. This fact accounts for the striking differences in value\r\nof property, for example, on Sixteenth Street, on State Street, in\r\nthe \"Loop,\" on Chicago Avenue, and on Sheridan Road. Convenience,\r\ndesirability, and other factors involving individuals who make up the\r\npublic enter into the determination of realty values.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to distinguish between land values and improved-property\r\nvalues. Usually buildings are erected that harmonize in cost with the\r\nvalue of the land on which they stand. But this harmonious relationship\r\nmay not continue; developments in the neighborhood may increase materially\r\nthe value of the land, while the value of the improvements decreases\r\nas time goes on. The values of the land and of the improvements do not\r\nnecessarily rise and fall together, though improvements generally tend\r\nto add to the value of the land. Much, however, depends on the use to\r\nwhich the land is put, and even more on the use of adjacent land. That\r\nuse may be such as seriously to impair the value of all the land within\r\na given area or some particular tract in that area. Such impairment is\r\na chief reason advanced for zoning, so that property values in various\r\ngiven districts may not be impaired through inharmonious uses, and that\r\nproperty values throughout a city may thus be stabilized.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to distinguish between \"deterioration\" and\r\n\"depreciation.\" They are not interchangeable. Deterioration of\r\nimprovements on land affects the value of the improvement, not necessarily\r\nthe value of the land. The property as a whole may be depreciated by\r\ndeterioration of improvements, but an increase in the land value might\r\nmore than offset this loss. This would be accounted for by a possible\r\nchange in the use of the land. For example, the buildings on the North\r\nSide in which Negroes now live are uniformly old and bad, yet the Negroes\r\ncannot buy them. The properties are in process of change from residence\r\nto industrial use, and the values placed upon them for the latter use\r\nare far beyond the financial capacity of the Negro residents.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL FACTORS IN DEPRECIATION OF RESIDENCE PROPERTY\r\n\r\nApart from any racial influence there are many causes of depreciation\r\nin property values, the responsibility for all of which has often been\r\nthoughtlessly placed upon Negroes. Throughout the city may be observed\r\nblocks, streets, and neighborhoods running a declining course in\r\ndesirability for residence purposes, losing value, changing in character\r\nand, in short, depreciating, but in or near which no Negroes live. The\r\nfollowing are important factors of depreciation not due to race:\r\n\r\n_Physical deterioration._--The natural wear of time and the elements is\r\na constant factor. Few houses are built to withstand these inroads over\r\na long course of years, even though they have the utmost care. Neglect\r\nand lack of repairs and improvements hasten this deterioration sometimes\r\ngreatly. Character of occupancy is often a factor. Some occupants are\r\nhighly destructive, particularly in rented houses. Their careless or\r\ninept use of a house often adds vastly to the wear and tear and hastens\r\ndeterioration. Overcrowding has a like effect.\r\n\r\n_Change in the character of a neighborhood._--Depreciation in property\r\nvalues in large cities is due in marked degree to factors not purely\r\nphysical. There is always a continuing yet varying fluctuation in\r\nthe character of neighborhoods; a restless shifting of population and\r\nconditions due to growth which rarely has been orderly or scientific.\r\nThe psychological factor of residential property values is such that they\r\nmay change very rapidly with the advent into a homogeneous neighborhood\r\nof a few families of a different nationality or social status. Between\r\nTwelfth and Thirty-first streets in the South Side Negro residence area,\r\nonce the most fashionable white residence section, property values based\r\non residential uses slumped utterly, and then later began to increase\r\nbecause of industrial uses. Such a change is often due to an encroachment\r\nupon a residential district of commercial or industrial enterprises.\r\nNeighbors will move away rather than endure such disturbance of their\r\npeace and comfort. Their places may be taken by people less sensitive\r\nto such influences who may be drawn to the neighborhood by reduced rents\r\nresulting from the exodus of former residents. Then rapid deterioration\r\nusually sets in as the tone of the neighborhood falls. A like result\r\nfollows a change from an exclusive residential district into one of\r\nrooming-and boarding-houses and large residences remodeled into flats.\r\n\r\nThe shifting of fashionable neighborhoods soon leads persons of means\r\nto abandon a high-grade residential section for some suburb or newer\r\nneighborhood which they think better suited to their social positions.\r\n\r\n_Use of buildings for immoral purposes._--Such use, though clandestine,\r\neventually becomes known; and although the property yields high rents,\r\nit lowers the standing and value of the block or neighborhood and of\r\nadjacent areas. It not only deteriorates the buildings thus used, but also\r\ndrives decent people from the locality; and the deserted houses either\r\nremain vacant or are taken by less desirable occupants. Depreciation\r\ninevitably results.\r\n\r\n_Public garages, theaters, and kindred nuisances._--People of a high-grade\r\nresidential district do not wish to live too near a public garage,\r\ntheater, bathing-beach, saloon, cabaret, dance hall, bowling-alley, or\r\nbilliard room. If they are unable to keep such enterprises out of their\r\nneighborhood they will sell their property and find homes elsewhere.\r\n\r\n_Changes in transportation facilities._--These may depreciate property\r\nin two ways: (_a_) they may themselves introduce obnoxious dirt or\r\nnoise-making features or bring in industries with such features; (_b_)\r\nnew transportation facilities often open up more desirable localities\r\nto which people are drawn from the older localities. In both cases\r\ndepreciation ensues.\r\n\r\n_Overbuilding._--Overbuilding is another and frequent cause of\r\ndepreciation. Building booms are often followed by years of depression\r\ndue to an oversupply of buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DEPRECIATION ON THE SOUTH SIDE\r\n\r\nThe area from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth Streets and State Street to\r\nthe lake is now the center of the largest Negro residential area in the\r\ncity, having approximately 20 per cent more Negroes than whites.\r\n\r\nIn the eighties and nineties this area was part of the most fashionable\r\nresidential district in Chicago and included some of the city's most\r\nprominent families and business leaders. They lived in houses which they\r\nhad built for their homes, and which were the first fine residences\r\nerected after the Chicago fire of 1871. Michigan, Prairie, and South\r\nPark avenues and Grand Boulevard were the most fashionable streets with\r\nthe best houses.\r\n\r\nThe Negro population then lived immediately west, between Wentworth\r\nAvenue and State Street and north of Thirty-fifth Street.\r\n\r\nThe North Side and the North Shore had not yet developed as fashionable\r\nneighborhoods. Indeed, the most prominent residence on Lake Shore\r\nDrive and one of the earliest stood almost alone for many years before\r\nfashionable people settled around it.\r\n\r\nAs the North Side grew in fashionable favor the South Side began to lose\r\nits original exclusiveness, and its residences began to depreciate. These\r\nproperties, while their original owners occupied them, were worth, many\r\nof them, from $30,000 to $100,000, including large grounds, elaborate\r\ninterior decorations, and sometimes works of art. The usual range of the\r\noriginal costs of these houses was from $10,000 to $30,000. The change\r\nsteadily continued, and these houses were rented and sold by the first\r\nowners at reduced prices to persons less prominent socially, until nearly\r\nall the original families had gone. A few refused to sell their houses\r\nand left them in charge of caretakers; and a very few still remain.\r\n\r\nThe gradual lowering of the market value of the property is pictured\r\nby prominent real estate men well acquainted with the neighborhood for\r\nmany years:\r\n\r\n     It is a positive fact, an economic fact, that any time a poor\r\n     class of people moves into a neighborhood formerly occupied\r\n     by people who had an earning capacity greater than that of\r\n     the people moving in, there is depreciation. That is true\r\n     whether Italians move in, or Poles, Negroes, Greeks, etc. If\r\n     the people moving into the neighborhood earn less and have\r\n     less than the people formerly living in that neighborhood,\r\n     there is depreciation.\r\n\r\nBetween 1900 and 1910 a few Negroes moved into Wabash Avenue. The houses\r\nwere very old and built close together, with few single residences.\r\nNegroes did not progress farther eastward in any large numbers because\r\nthe next street was Michigan Avenue, probably the most select of all the\r\nstreets in the area. With the pressure of increasing numbers and ascending\r\neconomic ability urging them out of the congested, uncomfortable, and\r\nunclean dwellings west of State Street, Negroes could and would pay higher\r\nrents than the class of white persons to which the oldest houses would\r\nnext descend. In 1912, in the area east of State Street, practically all\r\nof the original residents had gone, and few Negroes had come in. Real\r\nestate men estimate that generally natural depreciation proceeds at the\r\nrate of 2 to 2½ per cent a year. When Negroes first came into the area\r\nthe buildings were at least twenty years old, and many were much older,\r\nrepresenting at the lowest figure a very substantial depreciation.\r\n\r\nThere was another important factor in the depreciation of the area. In\r\n1912 the old vice district west of State Street and immediately northwest\r\nof this area was broken up. The inmates numbered approximately 2,000 and\r\nwere by no means confined strictly within the recognized limits. They\r\nmoved into the nearest good houses available where they could continue\r\nto ply their trade clandestinely. They could afford to pay high rents,\r\nand numbers of real estate owners profited greatly by dealing with them.\r\nAs many of these houses stood, they again yielded rents almost as high\r\nas when they were new. Cabarets, saloons, and amusement places packed\r\nthe side streets, and buffet flats opened up in the residence blocks.\r\nRaids and prosecution, night visits from men who did not live in the\r\ndistrict, called attention to the changed character of the neighborhood,\r\nand property values sank lower. Pressure from prosecuting agencies, as\r\nwell as the attraction of better houses in less conspicuous neighborhoods,\r\nurged the vice element southward. This southward trend is indicated in\r\nthe maps, facing pages 342 and 346, showing the environment of the South\r\nSide Negro.\r\n\r\nWhile property in this area could be bought cheaply it was also possible\r\nto obtain proportionately high rents by placing Negroes or prostitutes\r\nin houses not rented to either class before. Negroes were always charged\r\nhigher rents than were the whites who immediately preceded them.\r\n\r\nThe Juvenile Protective Association in 1913 made a study called _The\r\nColored People of Chicago_ and published it in a small pamphlet.\r\nConcerning the disposition of real estate men to profit in this way,\r\nthe reports say:\r\n\r\n     ... the dealer offers to the owner of an apartment house which\r\n     is no longer renting advantageously to white tenants cash\r\n     payment for a year's lease on the property, thus guaranteeing\r\n     the owner against loss, and then he fills the building with\r\n     colored tenants. It is said, however, that the agent does not\r\n     put out the white tenants unless he can get 10 per cent more\r\n     from the colored people.\r\n\r\nThe fact that for like quarters Negroes pay much higher rents than any\r\nother group in the city was discussed by the Chicago School of Civics\r\nand Philanthropy in a special study of housing for Negroes in 1911-12.\r\nThe report says:\r\n\r\n     The explanation for this condition of affairs among the colored\r\n     people is comparatively simple; the results are far-reaching.\r\n     The strong prejudice among the white people against having\r\n     colored people living on white residence streets, colored\r\n     children attending schools with white children, or entering into\r\n     other semi-social relation with them, confines the opportunities\r\n     for residence open to colored people of all positions in life\r\n     to relatively small and well-defined areas. Consequently the\r\n     demand for houses and apartments within these areas is strong\r\n     and comparatively steady, and since the landlord is reasonably\r\n     certain that the house or apartment can be filled at any time,\r\n     as long as it is in any way tenantable, he takes advantage of\r\n     his opportunities to raise rents and to postpone repairs.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that buildings could be easily purchased\r\nby Negroes. One white real estate dealer whose interests are almost\r\nexclusively in the area under discussion has purchased more than 1,000\r\nsuch houses which he rents to Negroes. These buildings were not purchased\r\nfrom Negroes but from first, second, and third owners, and at a price\r\nmuch below the original value.\r\n\r\nWith an opportunity for renting or purchasing the houses in this area,\r\nNegroes began to move in, first in small numbers and soon in larger\r\nnumbers. They naturally sought to abandon the generally and often\r\nextremely dilapidated houses west of State Street.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. DEPRECIATION AFTER THE COMING OF NEGROES\r\n\r\nBuildings twenty to thirty years old deteriorate rapidly unless expensive\r\nrepairs are made. As Negroes were often unable to make such repairs\r\nwhile paying for the property, the depreciation continued.\r\n\r\nWidespread buying of property in this district by Negroes began during\r\nthe period of the migration. Many home-owning Negroes, having sold their\r\nproperty in the South and brought the money to Chicago, found it easier\r\nto buy a house here on a first payment of $200 to $500, and on monthly\r\ninstalments thereafter, than to pay the rents demanded. Few, however,\r\nknew anything of city property values; they were often exploited by\r\nagents or assumed larger obligations than they could easily handle.\r\n\r\nMany Negroes purchased fairly substantial dwellings on the long-time\r\ninstalment plan without providing for repairs and maintenance. Usually\r\nthe monthly payment to cover interest, taxes, and instalment on principal\r\nwas about all the Negro and his family could carry, even though his\r\nwife's wages supplemented his. Thus nothing was left for upkeep.\r\n\r\nReal estate agents before the Commission agreed that Negroes meet these\r\nobligations with reasonable regularity. One white real-estate broker\r\nsaid: \"Those of us who have dealings with Negroes find that they make\r\nvery fair clients on the whole, pay their way, and ask no favors that\r\nany other human being would not ask.\"\r\n\r\nAnother referred to Negroes as \"wonderful instalment buyers\" who have\r\na \"tendency to invest in a home earlier than whites,\" and said that in\r\nfifteen years' experience his firm had never foreclosed on a Negro home\r\nbuyer; and in only two cases, due to exceptional circumstances, had\r\ncontracts been forfeited. Two Negro real estate dealers said:\r\n\r\n     A colored man usually feels that he will go without food rather\r\n     than not meet his obligations. That is one reason why sometimes\r\n     his home is run down, because he has spent every dollar he\r\n     can get to meet the payments on that property. He cannot spare\r\n     the money sometimes to buy a lawn mower or sprinkling hose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A colored man who buys a piece of property in a neighborhood\r\n     has no financial connections. He meets his obligations promptly\r\n     for three reasons: first, he wants a home; second, he knows\r\n     they may squeeze him; third, that mortgage is coming due and\r\n     he doesn't know where to go to get it renewed. We have no\r\n     organization of our own to back him. If the fence is to be\r\n     fixed or the house is to be painted, and a year from that date\r\n     the mortgage is due, and he has $500 in the bank, he will not\r\n     paint his house for the simple reason that, if he did, when\r\n     the mortgage is due he will not be able to meet it. He saves,\r\n     and when the mortgage comes due he has $500, $600, or $700\r\n     set aside to meet it.\r\n\r\nFrequently Negroes overreach themselves in purchasing property. Charles\r\nDuke, a Negro, in a pamphlet on Negro housing in Chicago remarked:\r\n\r\n     A very harmful result of present tendencies is manifested\r\n     in the acquisition of homes by colored people beyond their\r\n     social or economic advancement. The economic waste in this\r\n     particular has been especially great. They represent in many\r\n     cases a considerable outlay of capital. The domestic facilities\r\n     they afford are years beyond the needs of the people to whom\r\n     they are allotted. In many instances it costs a small fortune\r\n     annually to maintain one of these establishments, and when\r\n     this is not done the depreciation is both rapid and spectacular.\r\n\r\nThere is such lack of hotels and lodging-houses for Negroes, especially\r\nfor single men, that many Negroes have bought or rented houses with the\r\nintention of paying for them, in part at least, with income from lodgers\r\nor boarders. Such use leads to overcrowding, with consequent rapid\r\ndeterioration and depreciation. This tendency is accentuated by the fact\r\nthat the houses that Negroes can buy are usually old and deteriorated.\r\n\r\nWhile new arrivals from the South soon learn that the poorest city\r\ntenement requires better care than plantation cabins, their carelessness\r\nmeanwhile contributes to the property depreciation of their dwellings\r\nand neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThere are other factors of depreciation in this district which became\r\nactive after the Negroes came, but for which they were not wholly\r\nresponsible. One was the remodeling of residences for business purposes.\r\nWhile the remodeled property may bring larger returns, neighboring\r\nresidence property declines in value. Many fine old dwellings on Michigan\r\nAvenue and Grand Boulevard have been transformed in recent years into\r\nlamp-shade factories, second-hand fur shops, and small business houses;\r\nand these changes have depreciated neighboring property for residence\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAnother factor of depreciation is the city's tolerance of gambling and\r\nimmorality in and near areas of Negro residence. In most cities where\r\nNegroes are numerous a like tendency appears. Little consideration is\r\ngiven to the desire of Negroes to live in untainted districts, and they\r\nhave not been able to make effective protest.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the _Chicago Daily News_, in a series of articles on the Negroes,\r\ndescribed some of the disorderly saloons and cabarets in the South\r\nState and Thirty-fifth streets region, with their vile associations of\r\ndisreputable whites and blacks:\r\n\r\n     Other resorts in the district are worse; some are better.\r\n     These are typical of the roistering saloons, a kind which would\r\n     not be tolerated in any other part of the city since the old\r\n     Twenty-second Street levee was broken up. White proprietors have\r\n     brought them into the district, and many of them are patronized\r\n     largely by crowds from other parts of the city. The resorts\r\n     are forced on the colored people. Those colored families in\r\n     good circumstances and desiring respectable surroundings move\r\n     away, only to find disorderly saloons trailing after them.\r\n\r\n     At 301 East Thirty-seventh Street, on the southeast corner of\r\n     Forest Avenue, is the saloon of C----. With this exception the\r\n     district is a quiet, respectable residence quarter. When it was\r\n     known that this property was to be used for saloon purposes a\r\n     petition of protest was signed by 300 representative colored\r\n     men and presented to Mayor Harrison.\r\n\r\n     At night this saloon is an animated place. Reputable colored\r\n     families object to it chiefly on account of the numbers of\r\n     disorderly white women who meet colored men in its diminutive\r\n     back room. In the barroom an automatic piano thumps through the\r\n     night until closing hours. On the mirrors are pasted chromos\r\n     of \"September Morn\" and other poses of nude women.\r\n\r\n     Buffet flats and disorderly hotels are adjuncts of the bad\r\n     saloons. They make a better harvest for the police than the\r\n     saloons. The borderland of a colored residential district is\r\n     the haven for disorderly resorts. Protests of colored residents\r\n     against the painted women in their neighborhood, the midnight\r\n     honking of automobiles, the loud profanity and vulgarity are\r\n     usually ignored by the police.\r\n\r\n     In one block between South State and South Dearborn streets\r\n     which was canvassed by the _Daily News_, five places were\r\n     found openly admitted to be disorderly houses. Some were in\r\n     flat buildings, the other tenants of which apparently were\r\n     respectable, some raising families of children.\r\n\r\n     Many white owners of real estate who speak in horrified whispers\r\n     of vice dangers view such dangers with complacency when these\r\n     are thrust among colored families. Two years ago a woman\r\n     of the underworld and her gambler husband decided to open a\r\n     \"high-class\" resort on the South Side. She got a location as\r\n     a neighbor of reputable colored people by purchasing the home\r\n     of a former alderman and leader in a church, the one of which\r\n     the Rev. John P. Brushingham, secretary of Mayor Thompson's\r\n     Morals Commission, is the pastor. The woman was one of the most\r\n     notorious of the demimonde. An oil painting of her, as she was\r\n     before her husband in a fit of jealousy bit off a part of her\r\n     nose, for years hung in a saloon of international reputation.\r\n\r\n     These are some of the influences which the colored population is\r\n     forced to combat in its fight for decency and good citizenship.\r\n     A few secure political preferment and others profit by catering\r\n     to the city's vices, while the rank and file are hedged around\r\n     by demoralizing influences and the race is discredited unjustly.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HOMES OCCUPIED BY NEGROES ON FOREST AVENUE\r\n   (Note pavement and smoke.)\r\n   Classified in text as \"Type C.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: REAR VIEW OF HOUSES OCCUPIED BY NEGROES ON FEDERAL STREET\r\n   Classified in text as \"Type D.\"]\r\n\r\nAnother chapter of this series dealt with gambling in the South Side\r\ndistrict. Here are two excerpts:\r\n\r\n     Colored men are in active control of the gambling situation in\r\n     the big part of their district in the second ward. Back of them\r\n     are white police officials at one end of the line and white\r\n     politicians who keep them in power at the other end of the\r\n     line. When second ward, and even some adjacent ward, gambling\r\n     is discussed by gamblers on the inside, certain colored men\r\n     are always mentioned. They are called \"the syndicate,\" and\r\n     their approval is said to be necessary if the police are to\r\n     let anybody run in the ward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Whether gambling is a more dangerous cause of demoralization\r\n     of a community than are disorderly saloons, buffet flats and\r\n     dissolute women is an often discussed question. Gambling is a\r\n     man's game, is more open, and the connection between it, the\r\n     police, and politics easier to trace. In order to gamble the\r\n     police must be evaded, which is difficult, or made blind by a\r\n     peculiar remedy for itching palms or by orders from political\r\n     powers that be. However, it usually is the same police and\r\n     the same politicians who are protecting both classes of vice.\r\n\r\nThe contamination of these influences depreciates property and casts\r\na blight upon all who live within their unrestricted range. The taint\r\nextends beyond the blocks in which they exist and serves to promote\r\nprejudice and ill feeling against the Negroes who are the unwilling\r\nsufferers from these vicious resorts.\r\n\r\nThere are many landlords who exact high rentals from Negroes for the\r\nuse of run-down houses. All investigations of Negro housing on the South\r\nSide indicated that as a rule the rents are excessive, considering the\r\ninferior dwellings, their disrepair, and unsanitary conditions. This\r\nneglect by the landlords not only directly depreciates the property but\r\nencourages a careless use of it by tenants that leads to the same end.\r\nOne can hardly expect tenants to respect property that is not respected\r\nby its owners.\r\n\r\nOwners and agents of property occupied by Negroes differ in their opinions\r\nof Negroes as tenants and in their ways of handling them. Of course\r\nthere are differences in character, standing, and responsibility among\r\nNegroes as among whites, and this fact partly explains the following\r\ndifferences of opinion expressed by experienced real estate men:\r\n\r\n     One real estate firm, on Indiana Avenue, that makes leases\r\n     to both white and Negro clients, said that property occupied\r\n     by Negroes was more likely to run down. Another firm on East\r\n     Fifty-first Street reported that it rented to Negroes on\r\n     regular leases and had no trouble about collections. A young\r\n     Negro real estate agent on Indiana Avenue said that he had no\r\n     difficulty with collections: about half of his tenants came to\r\n     the office, and collectors called upon the other half. When a\r\n     building supports a janitor, he said, there is no trouble about\r\n     repairs, but if the responsibility is upon the tenants it is\r\n     difficult to keep a building in repair. The office manager for\r\n     a firm on Cottage Grove Avenue said that the majority of its\r\n     Negro tenants are on leases; all pay the rent at the office;\r\n     if they fall in arrears collectors are sent.\r\n\r\n     A firm which for many years has conducted a real estate business\r\n     on the South Side reported that 75 per cent of its Negro tenants\r\n     are on a month-to-month basis with thirty days' notice to\r\n     terminate; and 95 per cent of them are north of Thirty ninth\r\n     Street. A firm on Indiana Avenue requires its tenants to sign\r\n     leases; and in districts where there is much shifting about,\r\n     or where the property is for sale, a sixty days' notice clause\r\n     is inserted. It usually sends a collector, so that proper\r\n     supervision may be kept of the property. Its head expressed\r\n     the opinion that Negroes are just as good tenants as whites\r\n     whose wages are on about the same scale.\r\n\r\n     The office manager of an owner with about 1,400 Negro tenants\r\n     said that on the whole they compared very favorably with\r\n     the white tenants who preceded them; while some Negroes are\r\n     careless and ignorant, they all paid their rent promptly; his\r\n     office did not average one eviction a month, and when Negroes\r\n     are evicted they rarely cause trouble. Quite the contrary was\r\n     the report of the office manager of a real estate firm on\r\n     East Thirty-first Street, which does an extensive business\r\n     with Negroes. Much depreciation, he said, can be attributed\r\n     to Negro tenants; they are much harder on houses than white\r\n     tenants of the same station in life; they do not take proper\r\n     care of the furnaces or plumbing, and the higher rents paid\r\n     by them merely cover the cost of the additional repairs; the\r\n     recent comers pay their rent promptly when they have brought\r\n     money with them or when they receive good wages, but later on\r\n     become difficult to manage because they find it hard to adjust\r\n     themselves to city life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A firm on East Forty-seventh Street reported that it has\r\n     a large number of Negro tenants, makes leases to them, has\r\n     no difficulty in collecting rents, and considers them more\r\n     desirable than the whites who preceded them; a firm on Indiana\r\n     Avenue expressed the opinion that depreciation is very great\r\n     in houses rented to Negroes. That Negro tenants pay their rent\r\n     promptly was the experience of a real estate agent on Cottage\r\n     Grove Avenue. He has many Negro tenants on leases and is well\r\n     satisfied with them, although he does not think they take as\r\n     good care of the property as do the whites; Negroes are usually\r\n     occupants of old buildings, which are more difficult to take\r\n     care of.\r\n\r\n     Another real estate dealer on Cottage Grove Avenue who leases\r\n     to Negroes finds that usually they adhere to the terms of the\r\n     lease, although they sometimes move without notice. A dealer\r\n     on Wabash Avenue, who rents flats to Negroes, said that he\r\n     looked up the housing record of Negroes carefully before\r\n     letting them in, yet he sometimes had trouble with them. Once\r\n     he rented a flat to a mother and daughter, and the next day\r\n     he found another family living in it; but on the whole he was\r\n     well satisfied to have Negroes as tenants.\r\n\r\n     A prominent official of the Grand Boulevard district of the\r\n     Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association, which seeks\r\n     to keep Negroes out of Hyde Park, stated that a fundamental\r\n     fault in connection with the strained relations between\r\n     whites and Negroes was the failure of white owners to keep\r\n     their property in good condition so that it might be occupied\r\n     \"efficiently,\" that is, by white persons. Another official of\r\n     that organization said that Negro tenants could not be expected\r\n     to repair white men's property; that there are a great many\r\n     dwellings in the South Side Negro district that ought to be\r\n     condemned by the city health department, and that Negroes are\r\n     compelled to live in them because they can get nothing better.\r\n\r\nIn analyzing responsibility for depreciation, in the area from\r\nThirty-first to Thirty-ninth Street and from State Street to the lake,\r\nit is difficult to determine to just what extent the Negroes are there\r\nbecause of prior depreciation, and to what extent present depreciation\r\nis due to their presence. It is certain, however, that a large part\r\nof the depreciation is not justly chargeable to them, and that their\r\ncontribution is attributable partly to their economic status and partly to\r\nthe deep-seated prejudice against them. There are many instances in which\r\nproperty occupied by them has appreciated in value. This will always be\r\ntrue when the use by Negroes, or the demand for such use, is higher or\r\ngreater than any other use or demand. A symptom of the general prejudice\r\nis the very prevalent belief that if Negroes have once occupied property\r\nits value is thereby \"destroyed\" for white persons. This is true only\r\nuntil it has a value for use by whites greater than its value for use\r\nby Negroes. So long and only so long as Negroes as a class are, or are\r\ngenerally deemed to be, at the bottom of the economic scale will their\r\npresence in a neighborhood depreciate values. At present the fact stands\r\nout that Negro occupancy is an unmistakable symptom of depreciation--an\r\nindication that the value of property has fallen to their economic level,\r\nas well as an aid to depreciation in its last stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. DEPRECIATION IN HYDE PARK\r\n\r\nThe area bounded by Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets and Michigan and\r\nCottage Grove avenues has several property owners' protective associations\r\nfor the purpose of preserving property values. Their dominant interest\r\nhas been the exclusion of Negroes because these associated property\r\nowners believe that Negroes always depreciate the values of real estate.\r\nNegroes have moved into the neighborhood and there has been depreciation.\r\nTherefore Negroes are the cause.\r\n\r\nA complete understanding of the situation requires that it be determined\r\nto what extent property values decreased because Negroes moved in, and\r\nto what extent Negroes moved in because property values had decreased.\r\nThere is no doubt that the thousands of protests against the \"invasion\"\r\nof Negroes were sincere. It is also true that scarcely ten Negroes now\r\nliving there could have purchased their properties at the original prices.\r\n\r\nA leading real estate dealer said that \"when a Negro moves into a block\r\nthe value of the properties on both sides of the street is depreciated\r\nall the way from $100,000 to $500,000, depending upon the value of the\r\nproperty in the block\"; that it was a fact and that there was no escaping\r\nit.\r\n\r\n     It's a condition that is inherent in the human race ... a man\r\n     will not buy a piece of property or put his money in or invest\r\n     in it where he knows that he is liable to be confronted the next\r\n     day or the next year or even five years hence with the problem\r\n     of having colored people living alongside of his investment.\r\n     This depreciation runs all the way from 30 to 60 per cent.\r\n     Some time ago a survey was made as a result of which it was\r\n     estimated that the influx of Negroes into white neighborhoods\r\n     during the last two years had depreciated property on the\r\n     South Side about $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nHe cited as evidences of this the increased difficulty of negotiating\r\nloans on South Side realty on any terms, and the fact that some loan\r\ncompanies refused to write them at all, and loan values there had dropped\r\nenormously.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Boulevard district of the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners'\r\nAssociation reported an even larger estimate of the depreciation caused\r\nby the coming of Negroes into property near that boulevard. A committee\r\nof the Association in a report made early in 1920 claimed that the coming\r\nof Negro owners and tenants into that territory had depreciated property\r\nvalues of $400,000,000 fully 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the first Negro families in a white district usually creates\r\nsomething like a panic. The white residents, in a great many instances,\r\nfearing contiguity with Negroes and property loss, hasten to offer\r\ntheir property for sale and move elsewhere. Even a threat that Negroes\r\nintend to occupy a certain block or neighborhood will cause an exodus\r\nof white people, and their property is customarily sold at a sacrifice.\r\nWhen many properties are thus thrown on the market low prices are the\r\ncertain result.\r\n\r\nWhen in recent years, Negroes moved into the Hyde Park district, animosity\r\nwas aroused, and numerous bombings of property occupied by Negroes\r\nfollowed. One of the oldest South Side real estate dealers, quoted in\r\nthe _Daily News'_ series of articles in the summer of 1919, expressed\r\nthe tense feeling of an association there that was seeking methods to\r\ndrive out and keep out the Negroes:\r\n\r\n     We want to be fair. We want to do what is right, but these\r\n     people will have to be more or less pacified. At a conference\r\n     where their representatives were present I told them we might\r\n     as well be frank about it, \"You people are not admitted to\r\n     our society,\" I said. Personally I have no prejudice against\r\n     them. I have had experience of many years dealing with them,\r\n     and I'll say this for them: I have never had to foreclose a\r\n     mortgage on one of them. They have been clean in every way and\r\n     always prompt in their payments. But, you know, improvements\r\n     are coming along the lake shore, the Illinois Central, and\r\n     all that; we can't have these people coming over here. Not one\r\n     cent has been appropriated by our organization for bombing or\r\n     anything like that.\r\n\r\n     They injure our investments. They hurt our values. I couldn't\r\n     say how many have moved in, but there's at least a hundred\r\n     blocks that are tainted. We are not making any threat, but we\r\n     do say that something must be done. Of course, if they come\r\n     in as tenants, we can handle the situation fairly easily, but\r\n     when they get a deed, that's another matter.\r\n\r\nThis fear of Negro neighbors has been used by some real estate agents\r\nin promoting speculative schemes. By sending a Negro to inquire about\r\nproperty, they alarm the neighbors so that they will consider offers of\r\npurchase much below the normal prices. When the excitement has abated\r\nvalues rise again, and a profit is made.\r\n\r\nIn the actual depreciation of Hyde Park property there were several\r\nfactors, usually overlooked, that were in no wise attributable to the\r\npresence of Negroes. Some of Chicago's finest residences were located on\r\nMichigan Avenue and Grand Boulevard south of Thirty-ninth Street. This\r\nwas an extension of the early fashionable South Side district and had\r\nresidences that cost $350,000. But as in the case of the earlier South\r\nSide the neighborhood long since had lost some of its first settlers\r\nand had begun to decline. The World's Columbian Exposition, held in\r\nChicago in 1893, was near the Hyde Park neighborhood. To accommodate the\r\nmillions of visitors at the Exposition hotels and apartment houses were\r\nbuilt in that district far in excess of the normal need. The apartment\r\nhouses, moreover, affected the exclusiveness of the residence streets.\r\nThe buildings were speculations. Large sums were expended in the hope of\r\nimmediate exceptional profits. Property on Sixty-third Street sold at\r\nthe Exposition time for three times the price it could command today.\r\nThis is typical of the speculative values that then prevailed there.\r\nAfter the Exposition the removal of the first residents to the North\r\nSide and to suburbs steadily increased.\r\n\r\nThe abnormal years just preceding the Exposition had brought in thousands\r\nof workmen, who were thrown out of work when the Exposition buildings\r\nwere finished. This and the panic of 1893 made building costs very low\r\nand caused further construction of dwellings in that district. Mr. L.\r\nM. Smith, a prominent South Side real estate man, described this change\r\nat a meeting of the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association:\r\n\r\n     The condition that existed after the World's Fair, if you will\r\n     remember, in the material yards and the labor market was this:\r\n     Every yard was loaded up, and the carpenters and the mechanics\r\n     that were stranded here after the World's Fair were glad\r\n     to take jobs as janitors at $25 a month, in order that they\r\n     could have good warm places for their families, and buildings\r\n     that were put up three and four years after the Fair, along\r\n     in 1894, 1895, and 1896, could be built at about 30 per cent\r\n     cheaper than those that were put up during the World's Fair.\r\n     The consequences were that you could rent a flat cheaper in\r\n     a brand-new modern building than you could in a building that\r\n     was put up during the World's Fair, and as the older buildings\r\n     could not be rented, the owners finally had to come down in\r\n     their rent more and more; they got in less and less desirable\r\n     tenants until finally the whole territory became undesirable.\r\n\r\nThese first \"undesirables\" were not Negroes, for Negroes had not then\r\nmoved across State Street. And there were other causes for the vacancies\r\nand removals that admitted Hyde Park's first undesirables beside the\r\noverbuilding. One was the proximity of the Stock Yards. Since the\r\nSouth Siders could not have the Stock Yards moved, many of them moved\r\nthemselves. The railroads along the lake front, with their cinders, smoke,\r\nand noise, were also a factor. Another was the creeping in of industrial\r\nplants that located in and near the district, frequently in the face of\r\nprotests. A striking instance of this is the large assembly plant of an\r\nautomobile company at Thirty-ninth Street and Michigan Avenue. During\r\nrecent years the automobile industry has practically taken control of\r\nMichigan Avenue, once the most beautiful street of the South Side.\r\n\r\nThe coming of apartment houses and boarding-houses was another signal of\r\ndeclining values. It was shown that for twenty-five years scarcely a new\r\nresidence had been built on Grand Boulevard, once noted for its handsome\r\nresidences--due principally to the extensive building of apartment houses\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nRacial prejudice other than that against Negroes has operated in many\r\ninstances to depress property values. The presence of Jews, Germans,\r\nIrish, Italians, and Swedes has at times been objectionable to\r\nneighborhoods of Americans or of another race. A leader in the movement\r\nto remove Negroes from the Grand Boulevard area gave evidence of this,\r\nsaying: \"I know the Irish killed a certain boulevard. I know the Jews\r\nhurt another one, and I know the gambling element hurt another one.\"\r\n\r\nOn the South Side the Negroes were preceded by Irish. The original\r\nsettlers in the area around Thirty-first and Dearborn streets were mainly\r\nIrish laborers who worked in the lumber yards and mills, the Stock Yards,\r\nand other South Side industries. When they moved westward among their\r\nown people, thirty-five years ago, the Negroes took their places.\r\n\r\nSometimes social or sentimental values are involved in the depreciation\r\nbrought about when a new race or nationality breaks down the exclusiveness\r\nof a residence district. After the Exposition, for example, when wealthy\r\nresidents of Michigan Avenue, and Grand and Drexel boulevards deserted\r\ntheir houses for more fashionable locations, many of them were bought\r\nby Jews. This operated to depreciate adjacent property in the opinion\r\nof those who disliked Jews as neighbors.\r\n\r\nHow the changes take place was well described by an experienced real\r\nestate man: The original families have divided up and moved away; sons\r\nand daughters have married; the servant problem has become acute, making\r\nit difficult to maintain large houses; thus apartment houses have become\r\npopular; houses are older and deteriorated, apartments are new and\r\nmodern. In 1915 when the number of apartments for rent was in excess\r\nof the demand, a tenant would spend $25 or $30 in order to move into\r\nan apartment across the street merely because it happened to be fitted\r\nwith glass door knobs; a high-class residence at Forrestville Avenue\r\nand Forty-fifth Street was sold twenty years ago for $12,000; yet he\r\ntold the purchasers ten years ago that the property would not sell for\r\nmore than $4,000 to $6,000; and that was before Negroes had moved into\r\nthe neighborhood. Apartments in that vicinity still command a price\r\napproaching their original cost of building, because the demand for them\r\nis stronger than for houses.\r\n\r\nThis real estate man made the broad statement that the depreciation\r\nhas taken effect, in the majority of cases, before a Negro family has\r\nmoved into a neighborhood. There is depreciation, he thought, due to\r\nprejudice, when a Negro family moves into a good neighborhood that has\r\nbeen exclusively white, but that there are very few such instances for the\r\nreason that Negroes prefer to live where they are welcome, where there\r\nis no antagonism. With regard to the district between Thirty-ninth and\r\nFifty-fifth streets, State Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, he stated\r\nthat the entrance of the Negro had not appreciably affected values.\r\n\r\nAnother real estate dealer, experienced in South Side property and in\r\nselling to Negroes, expressed similar opinions. The greatest depreciation,\r\nhe felt, was in the expensive residences, and he doubted whether property\r\nas a whole in the square mile centered at State and Thirty-fifth streets\r\nhad been depreciated much if at all.\r\n\r\nThere was agreement among the authorities consulted that in an exclusive\r\nneighborhood of wealthy residents marked depreciation in large residences\r\nhas taken place, followed by the introduction of apartment buildings.\r\nOne of the men who had earnestly opposed Negro entrance into the Grand\r\nBoulevard district recalled when valuations on Grand and Drexel boulevards\r\nwere from $400 to $600 a front foot; then they fell to $125 or $150 a\r\nfoot; and then gradually climbed back to $175 or $200 a foot on account\r\nof the introduction of apartment buildings.\r\n\r\nSuch variations in value are the usual accompaniment of unguided growth\r\nin a large city. This unguided development brought depreciation, which\r\nwas manifest before Negroes began to make their appearance in the area.\r\n\r\nThe spread of clandestine prostitution, discussed in connection with the\r\narea north of Thirty-ninth Street, did not stop at Thirty-ninth Street.\r\nAs the environment maps indicate,[25] there was a noticeable increase\r\nfrom 1916 to 1918 in the number of houses or flats used by prostitutes in\r\nthe area south of Thirty-ninth Street. These changes occurred before the\r\nspread of the Negro population reached the neighborhood. Two houses, for\r\nexample, at 4404 and 4406 Grand Boulevard, bought by a Negro woman and\r\nbombed four times after she moved in, had been occupied by prostitutes\r\njust prior to her purchase.\r\n\r\n_The coming of Negroes._--In 1916 hundreds of buildings in the Hyde Park\r\narea stood vacant and had been so for some time. Owners and real estate\r\nmen were offering large concessions in the effort to get tenants. Values\r\nhad fallen greatly. A prominent real estate man closely in touch with\r\nthe neighborhood estimated that 25 per cent of the buildings there were\r\nvacant, and that there was little prospect of renting or selling them.\r\nCoincident with this oversupply in Hyde Park was an acute demand among\r\nNegroes for houses, intensified by the sudden addition of about 50,000\r\nmigrants. Many of them had sold their property in the South and brought\r\nthe money with them. Hyde Park landlords were willing to sell or rent\r\nto them rather than lose their property entirely. Many Negroes, however,\r\ninstead of renting, purchased the properties because of the exceptional\r\nterms offered.\r\n\r\nThis continued for about two years, when a demand for houses again arose\r\namong the white population. There was inactivity in building throughout\r\nthe war period. Chicago was sharing in the housing shortage which affected\r\nthe whole country, which was estimated in the early part of 1921 at\r\n50,000 houses. As the demand of whites for housing became acute, Hyde\r\nPark owners began to feel that their property was at a disadvantage due\r\nto the presence of Negroes.\r\n\r\nPlans for beautifying the lake front and improving Hyde Park were\r\nemphasized as a reason for holding on to property there. Alderman\r\nSchwartz, in addressing a meeting of the Grand Boulevard district of\r\nthe Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association, said:\r\n\r\n     The South Side, and Hyde Park and Kenwood in particular, in past\r\n     years has been the choice residential section of Chicago, the\r\n     show place of Chicago. Grand Boulevard is the most magnificent\r\n     street in the world, the finest boulevard of our wonderful\r\n     boulevard system. I know that for many, many years, in this\r\n     town, it was the ambition of people living in other parts\r\n     of the city to arrange matters so that they could have their\r\n     homes on the South Side in the place where you now live.\r\n\r\n     We have seen the rapid deterioration. In the council and in\r\n     the committees we have decided that we must do something.\r\n     The law has some very definite limitations written into our\r\n     constitution and statutes. It cannot afford any relief. You\r\n     yourselves must resurrect the South Side.\r\n\r\n     As one instance of what we attempted to do in the way of\r\n     assuring to the people who reside here that the South Side\r\n     can and will continue to be the great place we live in, we\r\n     passed the Lake Front Ordinance. You people probably never\r\n     realized what a wonderful thing that will be for the South\r\n     Side. It will take in the lake front from Twelfth Street south\r\n     to Fifty-first; it will affect the very choicest residential\r\n     district in Chicago, the territory between Thirty-ninth Street\r\n     and Forty-seventh Street--in this portion of the ward where\r\n     we now are, something like $125,000,000 will be expended in\r\n     reclaiming the lake front for you people, you men and women who\r\n     must stand together to save your homes, see that your homes are\r\n     kept as fine places to live in, that your neighbors are kept\r\n     the most desirable neighbors in the city of Chicago, so that\r\n     you may enjoy the benefit of that wonderful improvement that is\r\n     to come. Think of that tremendous stretch, from Thirty-ninth\r\n     to Forty-seventh, of bathing facilities, the finest in the\r\n     world. More than a year and a half ago an estimate was made of\r\n     the loss in property values in the Oakland district, north of\r\n     Forty-third Street, and that was estimated to be $100,000,000.\r\n     Now it is not only the loss of money that interests us. It means\r\n     not only that somebody has lost a certain amount of wealth,\r\n     but it means that somebody has lost comfort in living; someone\r\n     has lost joy in his home; someone has lost the opportunity to\r\n     give his children the environment that he wanted to give.\r\n\r\nA survey made by the Hyde Park Property Owners' Association in 1920\r\nshowed that there were then 3,300 property owners in the area bounded\r\nby Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets, Michigan Avenue and Cottage\r\nGrove Avenue, and that of this number 1,000 were Negroes. Then began\r\nthe attempts to move Negroes[26] back into \"their own neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the Negroes who moved into this area had substantial resources\r\nenabling them either to buy property outright or so to arrange for\r\npayments through instalments and mortgages as to render themselves secure\r\nagainst efforts to remove them. But in so doing they further complicated\r\nthe status of the neighborhood. Few white persons recognize the marked\r\ndifferences among Negroes, so that in purely commercial dealings they are\r\nnot as careful in selecting Negro tenants as they would be among whites.\r\nAs a result some Negroes who secured property there proved damaging to\r\nproperty values, just as would persons of a similar type from any other\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nMany of the houses for sale or rent were not suited to the incomes of\r\nordinary wage-earners. White persons whose incomes were sufficient to\r\npay the rental for such large houses preferred a different sort of house\r\nor neighborhood; and whites of smaller incomes could find more suitable\r\nhouses elsewhere; while Negroes, hard pressed for houses, rented them,\r\nand took lodgers to fill them and help pay the rent.\r\n\r\nThe exclusive occupancy of a block by Negroes is usually followed by less\r\ncare of streets and alleys. This neglect is general between Twenty-second\r\nand Thirty-ninth streets and is beginning to appear in the territory\r\nbetween Thirty-ninth and Forty-third streets where recently blocks have\r\nbeen \"turned over\" to Negroes. Community associations are being formed\r\nin some of these areas to protest against this laxity, and stimulate\r\nneighborhood interest in neat premises.\r\n\r\n_Appreciation of property._--When values fall extremely due to a selling\r\npanic among white owners, it is often followed by a decided recovery as\r\nthe Negro demand grows. Such a new market among Negroes, however, seems\r\nnever to have been strong enough to send prices for residence purposes\r\nback to original levels. But many instances have shown that prices rarely\r\nstay at the low \"panic\" level and frequently rebound to a level much above\r\nthat at which panic sales were made. Mr. Gates, a prominent South Side\r\nreal estate dealer, said: \"If a Negro family locates in a street where\r\nthe population is all white, values are cut in two, but this would not\r\nbe likely to occur if a large number of Negroes were ready and willing\r\nto buy adjacent property at established prices. Supply and demand would\r\nrule in such a market.\" Other real estate dealers expressed the opinion\r\nthat \"if the white owners were not over-anxious to sell when the Negro\r\n'invasion' begins, they might later on obtain as much or more for their\r\nproperty than they could have obtained before the advent of the Negroes.\"\r\n\r\nIn numerous cases Negroes created a market for property when there was\r\nnone. A prominent white business man long resident on the South Side\r\ntold of a row of houses on South Park Avenue and Grand Boulevard that\r\nwere vacant for years until sold or rented to Negroes: they could not\r\nbe sold at all until they took on a value because Negroes were ready to\r\nbuy them.\r\n\r\nA prominent Negro physician bought a piece of property in an exclusive\r\nwhite Hyde Park neighborhood. He lived there seven years and then sold\r\nthe property at an advance, and, to his knowledge, there had been no\r\ndepreciation in adjacent property.\r\n\r\nA white real estate dealer bought a house in Grand Boulevard between\r\nThirty-fifth and Thirty-sixth streets about five years ago. When Negro\r\nresidents came some of the white people sold at a sacrifice. But he\r\nremained and four years later sold the property for $2,000 above its\r\ncost to him.\r\n\r\nAn interesting instance related to property on Langley Avenue into which\r\na Negro family moved in 1919. The value of contiguous property remained\r\nthe same as of property two and three blocks east where no Negroes lived.\r\nSix months later, across the street from this Negro family, a white man,\r\naware of their occupancy, bought a house and paid $1,500 more than it\r\nhad formerly been offered for.\r\n\r\nThus, notwithstanding the prejudice against Negro neighbors that usually\r\nobtains, a block or neighborhood into which Negroes move is not always\r\nand necessarily depreciated, so many and active are the other factors\r\ncontributing to depreciation (or sometimes preventing); and so frequently\r\nhas it occurred that these factors of depreciation have operated\r\nextensively prior to the arrival of Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuation of values in response to sentiment, both inherent and\r\nstimulated, manifested itself in a practice of certain real estate dealers\r\non the South Side. Although it was stated and believed that values were\r\nirrevocably destroyed when a Negro family occupied a building, these\r\nagents boosted values by announcing that another building had been \"saved\"\r\nor \"redeemed,\" _thoroughly renovated_, and restored to its \"rightful\r\noccupants.\" The Kenwood and Hyde Park Property Owners' Association\r\nstated that this plan had succeeded in sixty-eight instances of buildings\r\n\"reclaimed\" by the Association.\r\n\r\n_A Prairie Avenue block._--To study the processes and factors of\r\ndepreciation the Commission selected an obviously depreciated block on\r\nthe once fashionable Prairie Avenue, between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth\r\nstreets, into which no Negroes had yet moved.\r\n\r\nIn 1885-90 Prairie Avenue was one of Chicago's most fashionable and\r\nexclusive residential streets. Imposing brown- and gray-stone residences,\r\nwith balconies of stone and ornamental iron, broad bay-windows, and large\r\nwell-kept lawns behind high iron fences, gave evidence of the wealth\r\nand social position of their owners.\r\n\r\nThe gradual decline of Prairie Avenue, as North Side and North Shore\r\nneighborhoods became more fashionable places of residence, and long\r\nbefore the approach of Negroes was even thought of, was exemplified in\r\nthis block. _Chicago Blue Book_, a broadly inclusive social directory,\r\npublished annually, shows that in 1890 the families living at forty-nine\r\nof the sixty-one addresses in the block were listed; in 1900 there were\r\neighteen of the forty-nine left; in 1910 there were only ten, and in\r\n1915 only two. Second and third occupants of the houses took the places\r\nof fifteen of the original forty-nine in 1900, of nine in 1910, and of\r\nfour in 1915. The _Blue Book_ listings at five-year intervals are shown\r\nin the table on the following page.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A CHANGING NEIGHBORHOOD]\r\n\r\nFrom 1895 on, those who moved away were to be found scattered all the way\r\nfrom Lake Shore Drive to Lake Forest. The newcomers who took their places\r\nappeared decreasingly in the _Blue Book_ and more and more frequently\r\nthey had Irish or Jewish names.\r\n\r\nA closer examination of the changing occupancy of the sixty-one houses\r\nin the block shows strikingly the rapidity and extent of the decline\r\nand reveals some of its causes.\r\n\r\n               \"BLUE BOOK\" LISTINGS IN PRAIRIE AVENUE BLOCK\r\n\r\n     =====================================================================\r\n                  | Number of Houses |                  | Number of Houses\r\n         Year     |  Listed with no  | Number of Houses | with Second and\r\n                  |    Change in     |    Not Listed    | Third Occupants\r\n                  |    Occupants     |                  |      Listed\r\n     -------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n     1890         |        49        |        12        |      .....\r\n     1895         |        26        |        25        |        10\r\n     1900         |        18        |        28        |        15\r\n     1905         |        12        |        36        |        13\r\n     1910         |        10        |        41        |         9\r\n     1915         |         2        |        54        |         4\r\n     -------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n_The residents._--In a house with fifty feet frontage on Prairie Avenue\r\nlived a wealthy artist, son of a Chicago pioneer merchant and member of\r\nseveral exclusive clubs. He lived there until a large brick factory was\r\nerected at the rear of his residence which is now occupied by a medical\r\nfraternity. A prominent Chicago family lived in another house which\r\nthey had built in 1885. In 1890, they moved to Cleveland and rented the\r\nproperty. For sentimental reasons they kept the property, although it was\r\nfast sinking in value. In 1919 a son living in Lake Forest proposed to\r\nremodel and improve the property, if by reasonable expenditures he could\r\nbe assured by real estate men of \"desirable\" tenants. No real estate man\r\nfelt able to do this, however, and the deterioration and depreciation\r\nwere uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nAnother residence, formerly occupied by a capitalist and journalist since\r\n1890, was a large two-story house with basement and attic and two-story\r\nbrick barn. The family long since moved to the North Side, and the old\r\nmansion on Prairie Avenue is now a rooming-house of thirty-eight rooms,\r\nincluding the garage.\r\n\r\nAt another address lived the president of a large business corporation,\r\nin a two-story stone-front building. It is now cut up into flats; and\r\nin the window recently was a sign: \"4th Flat for Rent, 6 Rooms, $20.00,\r\n_White Only_.\"\r\n\r\nOnly one or two of the fine old residences in this block are still\r\noccupied by Chicago's \"first families\" or owned by their estates.\r\n\r\nThere are now two relatively modern three- and four-story brick apartment\r\nbuildings in the block, and five old residences are rooming-houses. One\r\nis a club for railroad men, and another is a fraternity house. About a\r\nthird of the places are in fairly good repair.\r\n\r\nThe altered character of the block is revealed also in the number of\r\npersons now at each address. The polling lists for March, 1920, disclose\r\nthat fourteen persons are registered from one address, ten from another,\r\nseven from another, six each from three others, and so on, indicating\r\nmore adults than are usually found in a single family. These are probably\r\nroomers.\r\n\r\nThe problem, however, is a complex one, for, although no Negroes moved\r\ninto this block, they occupied parts of neighboring blocks during\r\nthat period, and their occupancy contributed to the final stage of\r\ndepreciation.\r\n\r\nThe picture in neighboring Calumet Avenue is not essentially different;\r\nperhaps the early occupants represented fewer of the \"first families,\"\r\nand the deterioration is more obvious.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of the oncoming of commerce and industry from the north are\r\nnumerous and inescapable. In this and adjoining blocks are now garages,\r\nan auto-repairing shop, the South Side Dispensary of the Municipal\r\nTuberculosis Sanitarium, a factory for grinding bearings, and a carpentry\r\nand glazing shop. An auto-laundry occupies the old church building.\r\n\r\nThis area is a comparatively short distance from the \"Loop.\" In real\r\nestate parlance it is known as \"close-in\" property. A former president of\r\nthe Chicago Real Estate Board stated that a large part of this \"close-in\"\r\nproperty depreciated because of its change from residential to commercial\r\nproperty. He mentioned Prairie and Calumet avenues, north of Thirty-first\r\nStreet--which includes the block studied. The depreciation, he asserted,\r\nwas also due to the \"departure of many owners of costly homes to other\r\ndistricts.\"\r\n\r\nWith the city's growth, transportation became an increasingly influential\r\nfactor. The automobile made it easy to reach the business center from\r\noutlying and suburban regions. It thus became less desirable to live near\r\nthe \"Loop,\" particularly as such districts are susceptible to changes\r\nthat may quickly destroy an exclusive residence district.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly developing automobile industry gravitated very largely\r\nto this part of the South Side. Its salesrooms, shops for the sale of\r\naccessories, and kindred business places spread along Michigan Avenue\r\nfrom Twelfth to Thirty-fifth street. Michigan Avenue is only two blocks\r\nwest of Prairie Avenue and one block west of Indiana Avenue. Garages,\r\nrepair shops, welding factories, and the like accompanied this invasion,\r\nand spread into adjoining streets. For instance, on an Indiana Avenue\r\ncorner a large eight-story factory was built immediately adjoining the\r\nrear of a handsome Prairie Avenue residence, and a one and one-half story\r\ngarage and repair shop was built in the rear of 2900 Prairie Avenue. Just\r\nnortheast of the block are factories and breweries with their noise,\r\nsmoke, and heavy traffic; and from the west and south Negroes have\r\nrecently been approaching--long after these other factors were operating.\r\n\r\nA peculiar fact about the property in this block and northward on Prairie\r\nAvenue is that the lots are long and narrow, and the houses are built\r\nto the side lines. These lots, when threatened with encroachment by\r\nfactories and the automobile industry, lost their residence value but did\r\nnot easily take on a new industrial value because they were individually\r\nowned and it required several lots to make a suitable industrial site.\r\nThe owners, though not desiring to live there, were yet loath to sell\r\nas cheaply as the individual strip sales would make necessary. And no\r\ninvestor would buy a single lot for industrial purposes unless certain\r\nof getting two or three others adjoining.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 land values on Prairie Avenue between Twenty-sixth and\r\nTwenty-eighth streets were $250 a front foot; and from Twenty-ninth to\r\nThirtieth streets, $200; on Indiana Avenue between Twenty-sixth and\r\nTwenty-eighth streets, $200, and between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth\r\nstreets $175. In 1920, however, values had dropped on Prairie Avenue to\r\n$60 a front foot while on Indiana Avenue, a semi-business street, they\r\nwere $150 and $180.[27] Negroes first moved into the block on Prairie\r\nAvenue between Thirtieth and Thirty-first streets about 1917, though\r\nvery few lived there at the time of the inquiry in 1920. In 1919 they\r\npurchased an abandoned church in this block which at one time was valued\r\nat $125,000.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the results of this investigation of depreciation: Negro\r\noccupancy depreciates the value of residence property in Chicago because\r\nof the prejudice of white people against Negroes, and because white\r\npeople will not buy and Negroes are not financially able to buy, at\r\nfair market prices property thrown upon the market when a neighborhood\r\ncommences to change from white to Negro occupancy; nevertheless a large\r\npart of the depreciation of residence property often charged to Negro\r\noccupancy comes from entirely different causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF NEGRO HOUSING\r\n\r\n\r\nI. NEGRO PROPERTY CONSIDERED A POOR RISK\r\n\r\nAn important factor in the housing problem is the low security rating\r\ngiven by real estate loan concerns to property tenanted by Negroes.\r\nBecause of this Negroes are charged more than white people for loans,\r\nfind it more difficult to secure them, and thus are greatly handicapped\r\nin efforts to buy or improve property. The general opinion that condemns\r\nsuch property makes the risk poor, even for Negroes. A Chicago Trust\r\nCompany representative said:\r\n\r\n     A Negro called to buy a mortgage. Our first thought was to\r\n     submit to him one of the colored loans, which we did. We showed\r\n     him a photograph; he liked the appearance of the building,\r\n     and then he inquired, \"Is this anywhere near the colored\r\n     district?\" He declined the loan on that account, showing that\r\n     this uneasiness is not confined to the white investor.\r\n\r\nWhen districts become exclusively Negro this reluctance to invest or\r\nto lend invariably appears. If there are sufficient Negroes with money\r\nto create a market the loss is somewhat relieved. Yet, deprived of the\r\nusual facilities for purchasing a home, they cannot relieve their housing\r\nshortage and are forced to seek houses in unfriendly neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nThe factors are similar to those in depreciation, often based on\r\nprejudices and erroneous beliefs concerning Negroes. Whatever depreciates\r\nreal estate necessarily depresses its security value--whether the cause\r\nbe fact or opinion. A South Side bank had difficulty in selling Negro\r\nloans to white people because \"they say they don't keep up the property;\r\nthey let it deteriorate; they don't improve it.\" The representative of\r\nanother bank said:\r\n\r\n     I don't believe you could find enough colored people who\r\n     could make a substantial first payment. There are a few that\r\n     I have talked with recently who are on the police force, who\r\n     wanted to know how we could help them out in buying places.\r\n     One had in mind the purchase of a three-flat building; the\r\n     price was around eight or nine thousand dollars. There was a\r\n     first mortgage on it of about five. He had only $300 cash to\r\n     buy it with.\r\n\r\nA former president of the Chicago Real Estate Board said:\r\n\r\n     The percentage of Negro people in Chicago who will buy homes\r\n     is comparatively small. The best evidence we have is that 85\r\n     per cent of the white people are tenants; 15 per cent of them\r\n     are home owners. It follows, I think, that a smaller percentage\r\n     of the colored race will buy homes, not more than from 3 to\r\n     5 per cent of the colored people at the present time.\r\n\r\nA representative of a very large South Side realty business said: \"There\r\nare ever so many mortgage men not familiar with the colored belt. That's\r\none of their greatest reasons for refusing the loans--they are not\r\nfamiliar with the values.\"\r\n\r\nReal estate men, white and Negro, were invited to present their views,\r\nand leading mortgage-loan houses and banks of the city were asked what\r\nthey knew about Negroes as borrowers, investors, tenants, and clients, and\r\ntheir thrift and care of property. Their testimony, with the Commission's\r\ninvestigations, yielded a fairly accurate picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NEGROES AS HOME OWNERS\r\n\r\nThe first house in Chicago was a rude cabin built by a Negro in 1790.\r\nThere were several Negro home owners when the city was incorporated in\r\n1837. The first Negroes to settle near Thirtieth Street--long before\r\nthe city had extended its limits that far--owned their homes. Although\r\nprior to 1916 most Negroes did not own homes, there were many, especially\r\nbusiness and professional men, who had gradually acquired dwellings. The\r\nmigration brought thousands of Negroes with ready cash who found it easy\r\nto buy dwellings on the South Side. The uncomfortable and inadequate\r\ndwellings of the \"Black Belt\" could be avoided only by the purchase of\r\nproperty elsewhere. Attention thus was directed, probably for the first\r\ntime, to the question of home buying by Negroes. Indeed home owning is\r\nan essential feature of any solution of their housing difficulties.\r\n\r\nUntil the migration Chicago's Negroes had engaged chiefly in\r\npersonal-service occupations that governed somewhat the location of\r\ntheir homes; when these were not in the \"Black Belt\" they were in shabby\r\nproperty in undesirable streets near their employment. Men who worked\r\non dining- and sleeping-cars lived near the railroad stations--on State\r\nand Dearborn streets, Plymouth Place, and the surrounding neighborhood;\r\nthey were generally renters and moved southward with the general trend.\r\n\r\n_Home buying stimulated by high wages and the migration._--The war brought\r\nwages to the Negroes that seemed fabulous to many; and the wages brought\r\nthe migration. The first migrants were mostly drifters. Then came a great\r\nmany who had acquired considerable substance in the South, and having\r\nsold out they came to Chicago with ready money, in some instances large\r\namounts. This class of Negroes bought dwellings. Several of them bought\r\napartment buildings, said a real estate dealer, and in one instance the\r\nbuyer paid $10,000 in cash; and there were very many who were able and\r\nready to pay from $1,000 to $3,000 on the purchase of a residence in a\r\nrespectable neighborhood. Another dealer said that he was not able to\r\nsupply the buying demand: \"We have put renters on the side list; buyers\r\nare taking up the time. We used to think $500 a good-sized payment for\r\nthem, but now they often have $3,000, $4,000, or $6,000. A Negro customer\r\nlately wanted a twelve-flat building and would pay cash.\"\r\n\r\n\"The average newcomer is a home-owner,\" said another realty dealer; \"he\r\nhas sold his home in the South to come here. Some say the high wages\r\nare not attracting them so much as better schools.\"\r\n\r\nAnother dealer said that the average amount per family brought from\r\nthe South was from $300 to $500, and he knew of one family that brought\r\n$6,000.\r\n\r\nIt was the experience of another firm that three or four years ago Negro\r\npurchasers paid down about $500, but that now (1920) they frequently\r\nmake first payments of $1,000 or more.\r\n\r\nThis sudden wave of home buying impressed Carl Sandburg, who wrote (1919)\r\nin the _Chicago Daily News_:\r\n\r\n     Twenty years ago fewer than fifty families of the colored\r\n     race were home owners in Chicago. Today they number thousands,\r\n     their purchases ranging from $200 to $20,000, from tar paper\r\n     shacks in the still district to brownstone and greystone\r\n     establishments with wealthy or well-to-do white neighbors. In\r\n     most cases, where a colored man has investments of more than\r\n     ordinary size, it is in large part in real estate. Realty\r\n     investment and management seems to be an important field of\r\n     operation among those colored people who acquire substance.\r\n\r\nSeveral other factors contributed to this house-buying movement. One was\r\nthat Hyde Park had many available houses in the early years of the war,\r\nwhile the Negro was excluded from the market west of Wentworth Avenue,\r\nwith its smaller and less expensive houses, by the vigorous antagonism of\r\nthe Irish and other people living there. The southern Negroes were glad\r\nto find that--at first, anyway--access was not denied them to districts\r\nhaving good schools, churches, recreation and amusements, and convenient\r\ntransportation facilities. This feeling was reflected in their purchase\r\nof churches; two of these, one on Washington Boulevard and one on Prairie\r\nAvenue, are in districts of extensive home buying by Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe high war wages contributed to home buying. Though in many instances\r\nthey induced extravagant expenditures, a surplus remained for many, and\r\nwith the frugal the savings were large.\r\n\r\nHigh rents were another primary contribution. Many of the ambitious\r\nnewcomers figured that they could buy a house for about the same monthly\r\namounts required for rent. In many instances they thriftily contrived\r\nto make the property pay for itself. Two- and three-flat buildings would\r\nfurnish a family with a home while providing a considerable revenue from\r\nthe rented flats. When old-fashioned houses too large for one family\r\nwere bought, lodgers and boarders were often taken. Frequently wife and\r\nchildren added to the family income so that they might own a home.\r\n\r\nA real estate dealer in Hyde Park said: \"The Negro has purchased 90\r\nper cent of the property where he lives, and 75 per cent of these are\r\n'high-class colored men.'\" This estimate is too high, but it shows the\r\nimpression made by the large number of Negro home buyers.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry in two blocks on Prairie and Forest avenues disclosed that 40\r\nper cent of the Negroes living on Prairie Avenue were property owners,\r\nin the intervening block on Thirty-seventh Street over 90 per cent were\r\nowners, while on Forest Avenue the Negro property owners were few.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the School of Civics canvassed a small area occupied by Negroes\r\nin the district west of State Street, a district where, because of their\r\nlow economic status, they would not be expected to buy. Of 331 families,\r\nthirty, or 10 per cent, were owners, and all but one had been owners\r\nfor from four to twenty years, so that they had not been influenced by\r\nthe migration.\r\n\r\nOf the impression made by the home-buying migrants a very intelligent\r\nNegro real estate dealer said, referring to the Chicago Negroes:\r\n\r\n     I will dare say that 90 per cent or even a greater number did\r\n     not own their property. They rented. It seems there has been\r\n     a different spirit instilled into the northern colored man.\r\n     We bow to the southern man because he is a home owner. The\r\n     northern man was satisfied to rent. I was born in Chicago and\r\n     felt the same as others do.\r\n\r\nThe present trend was indicated in these statements of two well-informed\r\nwhite real estate dealers on the South Side: \"The colored people are\r\ndemanding homes and the tendency is to buy\"; and that Negroes were\r\ncontinuing to buy homes in the district between Thirty-ninth and\r\nForty-seventh streets, Cottage Grove Avenue and State Street, more sales\r\nbeing made to Negroes in that particular location than in any other.\r\nAnd this has been during a period of acute and general housing famine\r\nin every large city.\r\n\r\n_Methods of purchase._--When Negroes first began to buy dwellings during\r\nthe migration years, the average price was $4,000 to $5,000, and the\r\ninitial payment, usually $500, ranged from $300 to $1,000. The time\r\nfor payment was ordinarily three years, though some contracts were for\r\nfive years. Later on Negroes began to buy houses or apartment buildings\r\nrunning as high as $8,000 or $10,000, and the payments were increased\r\nproportionately.\r\n\r\nThat the Negro assumed a heavy load, sometimes more than he could\r\nreasonably be expected to carry, was the opinion of several careful\r\nobservers. While the surplus from his wages might be expected to cover\r\nthe monthly payments, money for taxes, repairs, and insurance would have\r\nto come from the wages of wife or children, or from lodgers.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1920, when work at high wages was abundant, a well-informed\r\nNegro real estate dealer said that any Negro family head could then\r\nassume payments of from $40 to $55 a month on purchased property. But\r\nmany Negroes made contracts calling for monthly payments of $65 to $75.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of experienced persons in close touch with the situation\r\nwere divided as to whether, in making such purchases, Negroes had assumed\r\ntoo heavy obligations. One said his long experience showed that Negroes\r\ncarry out what they undertake to do; that very few default on their\r\npayments, and when Negroes buy on the instalment plan \"they pay out\r\nbetter than the whites do, as a rule.\"\r\n\r\nAnother said, though Negroes buy only old properties--and generally pay\r\nmore than white people--they are careful in assuming their obligations\r\nand make their payments promptly. They pay down to the mortgage, in from\r\nthree to five years, and sometimes within two years.\r\n\r\nAnother, who has been dealing with Negroes since 1907, gave his opinion\r\nthat they undertake their obligations seriously, and as instalment buyers\r\nof property they are entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nStill another South Side man who sells real estate to Negroes declared\r\nthat he had been getting better payments recently than he did three or\r\nfour years ago; in 1914, 1915, and 1916 he suffered considerable loss\r\nbecause of defaults in payments on purchases or in rents.\r\n\r\nA former president of the Chicago Real Estate Board remarked that Negroes\r\nbuy but do not build their houses, and are not yet sufficiently numerous\r\nto create a market for real estate; that white people will not buy\r\nback property once occupied by Negroes; that, as the numbers of Negroes\r\nincrease, this situation might be changed, but that the Negro who tries\r\nto sell old property, on which he has put no improvements, will rarely\r\nfind a buyer, because there is so much old property available.\r\n\r\nCertain banks and loan firms thought there would be a general foreclosure\r\nof mortgages on recently purchased property as they fell due, that the\r\nNegroes are carrying such heavy payments on their contracts that they\r\ncannot reduce their mortgages and consequently renewals will be denied;\r\nthat the Negro has not yet acquired sufficient stability to carry on\r\npayments over a long term of years, and if wage reductions become general\r\nthey will fall most heavily on unskilled workers and render difficult the\r\nmeeting of payments by such Negroes, who constitute the great majority.\r\n\r\nMost of the firms that had dealings with Negroes, whether as buyers,\r\nborrowers, or renters, expressed satisfaction with their transactions\r\nwith them. Typical of their comments was that of John A. Schmidt, who\r\nfound Negroes to be prompter than Jews in making payments, and of Milton\r\nYondorf, who said that Negroes, like the Italians, finish paying for\r\none house before undertaking to buy another, and are eager to make the\r\nfinal payment.\r\n\r\nWhile the preponderance of opinion was that the Negroes do meet their\r\npayments, it may be that experience is still too limited in Chicago and\r\nconditions have thus far been too abnormal to afford the basis for final\r\njudgment and future policy.\r\n\r\nThe first wave of buying by Negroes was stimulated by both Negro and\r\nwhite real estate agents because many dwellings had been unremunerative\r\nfor several years. With the tightening up of the real estate market that\r\nensued, Negroes became home hunters, and they are continuing to search.\r\n\r\nThere has been a wide variation in the prices paid by Negroes for\r\ndwellings. For some houses Negroes have undoubtedly paid more than could\r\nhave been obtained from a white purchaser. One dealer's opinion was that\r\nthe Negroes have paid full value. Another said that the Negro never pays\r\nhigher for property unless the price is measured by what has been paid\r\nfor it by white persons of the \"fourth class\"--referring to property that\r\nhas descended from the original owner through three classes of whites\r\nbefore coming into Negro hands. Many purchases during the last two or\r\nthree years have been made direct from the owners. An attempt made by\r\nwhite real estate men to come to an agreement regarding sales in new\r\ndistricts--whereby they would turn over to Negro agents all inquiries\r\nas to blocks where Negroes already lived, and Negro agents would not\r\nplace Negroes in exclusively white districts--was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. REAL ESTATE LOANS TO NEGROES\r\n\r\nThe most formidable stumbling-block in the way of home owning by Negroes\r\nis the unsalability of their mortgages. Except in a limited field these\r\nloans have no market. The Negro demand for home property has become so\r\nlarge in recent years that the search for it has extended beyond the\r\nfringes of the main existing districts on the South, West, and North\r\nsides into the outlying territory adjoining Negro settlements in Blue\r\nIsland, Woodlawn, Morgan Park, and Robbins. How the Negro is to be\r\nfinanced in his effort to improve his citizenship and home life through\r\nhome ownership thus becomes a matter of great concern.\r\n\r\nThe Commission sought to learn from banks, trust companies, brokerage\r\nfirms, and similar institutions their experience with Negro clients and\r\nproperty and their purpose and plans as to future dealings. To thirty\r\nsuch institutions questionnaires were sent, and twenty-three gave careful\r\nreplies.\r\n\r\nOnly a few real estate firms that have a large number of Negro clients\r\nhave funds available for such loans. These meet but a small part of the\r\ndemand. The three banks that have large Negro deposits, the Lincoln\r\nState, the Franklin State, and Jesse Binga's, make such loans when\r\ndeemed desirable, but they seem not a large factor in relieving the loan\r\nsituation. Many of the banks that are depositories for Negroes' funds do\r\nnot make loans to them, giving as their reason that they do not lend on\r\nthe class of property purchased by Negroes. Some of them have no real\r\nestate department. Only three of the downtown investment bankers make\r\nno restrictions regarding Negro borrowers that are not common to all;\r\nthey have dealt with Negro clients for many years and have found them\r\nentirely satisfactory. Possibly one reason for this is that they educate\r\ntheir buyers of mortgages concerning the value of these loans; and thus\r\nhave succeeded, they say, in overcoming many objections based upon race\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\nMost large real estate firms and loan companies decline to make loans\r\non property owned or occupied by Negroes. With some of them this is\r\na blanket provision that covers generally property in changing or\r\ndepreciated districts. Difficulty of disposing of such mortgages is one\r\nof the commonest reasons given for refusing to handle them.\r\n\r\nEven among the agencies that handle such loans opinion is not unanimous\r\non fundamental points involved. The Commission asked several brokers\r\nrepresenting large interests this question: \"Does your experience\r\nindicate that loans up to 50 per cent of the valuation on property in the\r\nresidence districts from Twenty-sixth to Sixtieth streets and from State\r\nStreet to the lake have a safe-and-sound investment value?\" Among those\r\nfavorable to Negroes the answer of Yondorf & Company, a downtown firm,\r\nis perhaps typical: It is necessary to consider each house separately,\r\nas conditions vary widely; consideration must be given to future uses of\r\nthe property, the present condition of the improvements, and especially\r\nthe stability of the person asking for the loan. As a general rule,\r\nloans on old residence property are not as good as those on houses in\r\nnew districts; on an old house about $1,000 would be loaned on a market\r\nvalue of $5,000, whereas in new districts the contractor can borrow up\r\nto two-thirds of the cost of the house; no conscious discrimination is\r\nmade in the nature of higher rates because a borrower happens to be\r\na Negro; careful consideration is given to the margin of safety, and\r\nsafeguards are arranged in the way provided for payments.\r\n\r\nLionel Bell, another downtown loan broker, regarded this general type\r\nof mortgages on old residence property as fully secured, and does not\r\nhesitate to recommend mortgages in the district mentioned.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Schmidt, who handles a large number of loans on Negro property\r\nin that district, considers them of high value, though the risks are\r\nboth physical and moral; it is essential to know both the client and the\r\nproperty; the amount of the loan asked on Negro property usually is not\r\nhigh as compared with its value. No distinction is made as to the color\r\nof the borrower, the condition and value of the property being the only\r\nbasis for the loan; loans to Negroes are less in amount than to whites,\r\nthough clients thus far accepted are commonly found satisfactory; the\r\nperiod of payment is about the same, varying between three and five years,\r\naccording to the amount paid monthly, the kind of property involved, and\r\nso on. The usual range of amounts requested was one-third to one-half\r\nof the value of the property.\r\n\r\nR. M. O'Brien & Company, an active South Side real estate firm which\r\nalso deals largely in Negro mortgages, found that the average amount\r\nloaned to Negroes was smaller, and that it is a smaller percentage of\r\nthe value of the property than in the case of loans to whites, and that\r\nthe average period for loans to Negroes was three years.\r\n\r\nMead & Coe, another real estate firm, found that the Negroes usually\r\nare allowed $1,000 to the white man's $1,500; that only 35 per cent of\r\nthe value of the property is loaned to the Negro, whereas 50 per cent\r\nis granted to whites. Maximum time of loan was five years for the white\r\nand three years for the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Trust Company answered that the same requirements were made\r\nof white and Negro; the range was from $2,000 to $6,000, limited to 50\r\nper cent of conservative valuation, and five years.\r\n\r\nIn general it was found that property values in the districts where\r\nNegroes usually buy are affected by more factors than is the property\r\nin districts where whites usually buy. Where Negroes are buying the\r\nmajority of white people are renting.\r\n\r\nIt was sought to find out whether Negroes ask for renewals more often\r\nthan do white borrowers; whether there was any marked difference between\r\nNegroes and other racial groups in the promptness of making payments,\r\nin asking for additional time, in the difficulty of collections, and in\r\ncompelling foreclosure. Comparison of Negroes and whites was found to\r\nbe difficult because of differences between various nationalities as to\r\nrepaying loans. The Poles pay promptly when dealing through loan companies\r\nor banks conducted by Poles. The Italians are eager to get their property\r\ncleared. Jews are likely to ask for renewals and to expect the property\r\nto pay the mortgage out of earnings. The Negroes pay if they can, but\r\nsometimes have difficulty because they have arranged heavy payments on\r\ntheir contracts; during the period of high wages there has been little\r\ntrouble, but the feeling was that as yet there had been no real test.\r\nSpeaking generally, a representative of Yondorf & Company said it was\r\nestimated that only about 25 per cent of working people are thrifty and\r\nsave anything; 75 per cent save nothing; and that proportion holds true\r\nof the Negroes.\r\n\r\nFirms that deal with Negroes ask for no larger reduction when a Negro\r\nrenews his loan, they say, than when a white person renews if the\r\ncharacter of the property is the same. The facts as to the reliability,\r\ncharacter, and standing of the borrower are established when the loan\r\nis first made. Negroes buy old properties where deterioration is rapid,\r\nand when the renewal is asked the value of the property has fallen in\r\nproportion. White persons do not buy the same class of property. So it is\r\nnecessary to ask the Negro to reduce his mortgage considerably, except\r\nwhen his property is in a location of newer houses, such as Morgan Park\r\nor Woodlawn.\r\n\r\nDifficulty is experienced by mortgage bankers and brokers in selling\r\nNegro mortgages to white clients. Yondorf & Company declared that while\r\ntheir old clients would buy regardless of the color of the borrower,\r\nothers had to be convinced of the value of the property and of the\r\nearning power and stability of the Negro borrower. The Negro mortgages\r\nare usually for smaller amounts and hence within the reach of small\r\ninvestors. When white investors find that Negroes' loans are promptly\r\npaid they continue to buy such securities.\r\n\r\nLionel Bell reported some difficulty in selling Negro mortgages to white\r\nclients, though he generally succeeded, by showing their value and by\r\ninspection, that the Negroes were keeping their houses in good condition\r\nas to both sanitation and repair.\r\n\r\nE. A. Cummings & Company have difficulty in selling such mortgages\r\nbecause many of their clients are out-of-town buyers who are suspicious\r\nof Negro property.\r\n\r\nE. and S. Lowenstein find no market for such loans; non-resident buyers\r\nand even local buyers fight shy of Negro property in particular, and\r\nproperty in general that is undesirable because of overcrowding and\r\nconsequent hard usage.\r\n\r\nIn general, the refusals to buy Negro loans are due to feeling against\r\nthe Negro, a disbelief in the Negro's ability to pay them, and distrust\r\nof the old properties which Negroes commonly buy. The opinion was general\r\nthat anything which would tend to stabilize values on the South Side,\r\nespecially in the lower part of the district occupied by Negroes, would\r\nbe desirable; that improvements such as the widening of South Park Avenue\r\nwould aid materially.\r\n\r\nReal estate men who have Negroes for clients are finding it advantageous\r\nto educate them in the meaning of mortgages, in the method of issuing\r\nand renewing them, and in what is expected of the mortgagor and what\r\nthe mortgagor may expect. When the Negro is carefully informed of the\r\nprocesses involved in financing the purchase of a home, and the terms\r\nare thoroughly understood, there is much less likelihood of losing his\r\nproperty. Friendly real estate men are constantly helping Negroes to\r\ncarry their mortgages and to find means of renewing when that contingency\r\narises. It is helpful also to remind Negroes of the necessity of paying\r\ntheir taxes and meeting other obligations promptly, and of keeping their\r\nproperty in good condition. Some firms stated that the \"natural honesty\r\nof the Negro and his love of home life\" have been fostered by thoughtful\r\nfriends and leaders, as well as by those who have business transactions\r\nwith him. This pays dividends in better citizenship.\r\n\r\n_Widening the market for Negro loans._--The white people need to know\r\nthe obstacles in the path of the Negro who wishes to establish a good\r\nhome for his family and thus improve his citizenship and serve as a good\r\nexample to others of his race. How to finance Negro home buyers is a\r\nlarge difficulty in solving the Negro housing problem. The Commission\r\nheld a conference devoted almost entirely to this topic, at which various\r\nexperts and authorities were consulted. It was sought to ascertain the\r\nfundamentals for meeting the needs of the future, assuming that the\r\nNegro population in Chicago is likely to continue in normal growth, and\r\nthat the demand for adequate housing for the Negro population is not\r\nlikely to lessen for several years. Particular attention was given to\r\nthe question of how a market might be created for the Negro's loans.\r\n\r\nAn appraiser for the Fort Dearborn National Bank suggested that a system\r\ninvolving partial payments represented by $25 bonds paying semiannual\r\ninterest might be helpful. Bonds of such low denominations might, he\r\nthought, be purchased by Negroes. By such a system Negroes would learn\r\nto invest their money wisely, and by putting money into substantial\r\nsecurities would encourage real estate investments. These securities\r\ncould be sold by Negro bankers and real estate brokers. But he expressed\r\nconfidence that not a few white people would buy bonds of that character.\r\nThey would be based on about 60 per cent of the value of the property.\r\n\r\nOne real estate broker averred that success in financing Negro home buyers\r\nwould be contingent upon creating definite districts in any portion of\r\nthe city where the colored men may find it necessary to live in order to\r\nbe able to reach their business or their place of employment, districts\r\nto be known as their exclusive territory. Then it would be possible to\r\ngo to a mortgage loan house and present a definite case when a mortgage\r\nfalls due. Knowing that the property was that of a Negro, and knowing the\r\ndistrict, one would have a definite basis for estimating future increase\r\nor depreciation of value. It was his opinion that white people would\r\nsupport a market of that nature, because it would not only protect the\r\ncolored man and the white man alike but all of the property interests\r\nof the city. He disclaimed any desire to promote segregation. But he\r\nmaintained that so long as the races mixed, clashes were inevitable, and\r\nthat the problem of selling Negro loans, erecting houses, and renewing\r\nmortgages would solve itself under this plan, \"because white men will\r\nbe very glad to come to the assistance of colored.\"\r\n\r\nIt happens, however, that some subdivisions developed \"especially\r\nfor Negroes\" present low standards as well as exploitation. One such\r\nsubdivision is called Lilydale. An investigator reported on it as follows:\r\n\r\n     Lilydale is on a flat prairie and was laid out as a subdivision\r\n     for Negro residents near the corner of Ninety-fifth and State\r\n     streets several years ago. It is about five blocks square. The\r\n     developer is a prominent white real estate dealer active in\r\n     subdivision property generally. Another well-known real estate\r\n     man, who is also a prominent local politician, is interested\r\n     in establishing a Negro colony on this property. The latter is\r\n     agent for a great deal of property on the South Side tenanted\r\n     by Negroes.\r\n\r\n     Many Negroes purchased lots in Lilydale at fairly high prices,\r\n     considering that virtually no improvements had been made to\r\n     the property. Water has since been laid in some of the streets\r\n     and some of them are supplied with sewers, but there is no\r\n     paving and no lighting. Sidewalks are few, mud holes many.\r\n     Yards, streets, and alleys are unkempt.\r\n\r\n     Those who promoted the subdivision set up the shells of a few\r\n     houses, mainly of the bungalow type. Most of these were sold\r\n     and the inside finish was supplied by the purchasers. Most\r\n     of these sale houses, though, remain unfinished. The building\r\n     of houses in Lilydale has been half-hearted, and most of the\r\n     structures are so poorly constructed that they are conspicuously\r\n     uncomfortable. Some of these were built by piecemeal with any\r\n     kind of waste building material that could be gathered. The\r\n     people in this isolated community apparently are making the\r\n     best of a hopeless situation. They express a desire to recover\r\n     the money they have invested. Provisions are obtained from two\r\n     or three small stores. There is a church in the vicinity, but\r\n     at the time of the investigation no services were being held\r\n     in it. The children attend a branch of the Burnside School,\r\n     which is conveniently located. The teacher is a Negro woman,\r\n     a graduate of a southern normal school. She reported that\r\n     there is apparently no prejudice between the white and Negro\r\n     children; that their only differences are those to which all\r\n     children fall heir. She regards the Negro colony of Lilydale\r\n     as a bad mistake and would discourage other Negroes from\r\n     making purchases there. She regards the investment there as\r\n     of doubtful value.\r\n\r\n     There is a car line on Ninety-fifth Street which connects with\r\n     the industries of South Chicago, where a number of the men of\r\n     Lilydale are employed.\r\n\r\n     Adding to the loneliness of the general aspect is the fact that\r\n     most of the surrounding area is still what is termed \"acreage.\"\r\n\r\nPertinent also is the statement of a man who for years has been interested\r\nin the housing difficulties of Negroes.\r\n\r\n     Some people have suggested taking a vacant piece of property\r\n     and building it up for colored occupancy, but there is the\r\n     biggest hubbub raised when any such attempt is made. People\r\n     complain: \"You will ruin this whole neighborhood! You will\r\n     ruin the street car line! Everything out in that neighborhood\r\n     will be ruined all along the street, because if you build up\r\n     a colored neighborhood in any one particular location nobody\r\n     else will want to go out that way.\" So that I have come to the\r\n     point where I say there is no solution. I can't do anything.\r\n     I'd have been willing to put in a million dollars in property\r\n     anywhere where there would have been a chance to get 5 per cent\r\n     return on my money. There isn't any use in doing a thing that\r\n     isn't economically sound. I wanted to bring this up to show\r\n     that I had given it some thought, and that I am very desirous\r\n     of having somebody make a suggestion that is feasible so that\r\n     something can be done.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of disposing of loans in a district inhabited by Negroes\r\nwas touched upon by a loan expert from the Chicago Trust Company, which\r\nhandles such loans. The trouble, he thought, centers on the character\r\nof the property and of the district, rather than on the fact that the\r\nproperty happened to be owned or occupied by Negroes. He said that even\r\nNegro investors object to property in such a district for the reason\r\nthat it is old, little in demand, and generally a poor risk. He suggested\r\nthe possibility of small mortgage bond issues with separate notes. This\r\nwould save the expense of printing the bonds, which is considerable at\r\npresent prices, and the investor would be afforded the same security.\r\nHe also suggested having \"baby\" bonds printed in standard form, so that\r\nthey could be simply filled in, thus saving expense.\r\n\r\nAnother real estate broker who had dealt in mortgages of South Side\r\nNegroes for a number of years declared that the average mortgage buyer\r\nseems to prefer those on new bungalows where the margin of security is\r\nless than that on property in the Negro district. Since the bungalow's\r\ncost of construction was less, the chance of revenue under adverse\r\ncircumstances would be less. He maintained that a ten- or twelve-room\r\napartment house in the Second Ward (South Side) affords a better margin\r\nof security than the ordinary cheap bungalow, and that it was therefore\r\na question of educating mortgage buyers on the question of security. The\r\nbest evidence on this, he maintained, would be the number of foreclosures.\r\nHe had never had to foreclose with Negroes in the fifteen years of his\r\nexperience. In that time only two contracts had been forfeited, both\r\nbecause of disputes between the heirs and the buyers. His firm had,\r\nhowever, made new contracts when illness or other adverse circumstances\r\nhad halted payments, thus allowing the buyers to start over again. Means\r\nhad also been taken to see that buyers paid their taxes, in which process\r\nthey had required education. White people must be depended upon to buy\r\nthe Negro's loans. Very few Negroes buy loans. Their tendency, he said,\r\nis to invest in a home earlier in their career than the white people,\r\nand they buy as soon as they have accumulated enough to make the initial\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nAccording to a bank appraiser's opinion Negroes do not understand values,\r\nand they are often led to purchase a building at much more than its\r\nworth. In consequence the amount of loans they need is much greater than\r\nit ought to be. He had not found, however, that the Negroes allow their\r\nproperty to deteriorate unduly. A different situation had been found\r\nwhere white people lease to Negroes.\r\n\r\nAccording to some real estate dealers, there are cases where houses\r\nare allowed to deteriorate, where the payment has been larger than the\r\npurchaser could carry conveniently. But \"after he has taken care of the\r\npayment and has his deed, he will give attention to the improvement of\r\nthe house.\" Others agreed that the Negro mortgage debtor is quite as\r\nreliable as a white debtor of the same class.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Cook County Real Estate Board suggested that one\r\nmeans of creating a market for Negro loans would be the passage of the\r\n\"Home Loan Bank Bill.\" Its provisions are that no loan would be made\r\nin excess of $5,000, but loans would be made up to 80 per cent of the\r\nfair value of the property. Many of the loan houses, he declared, do\r\nnot consider small loans, a fact confirmed by the Commission. He cited\r\none house that will not consider a loan of less than $500,000. For this\r\nreason he suggested that this business should be handled by the building\r\nand loan associations, since they do business on a smaller margin of\r\noperating cost and he regarded them as the proper media for finding\r\nsuitable markets for Negro mortgages.\r\n\r\nInvolved in the plan for funding the Negro's loans was the question\r\nof segregation. It has been maintained that not much financing could\r\nbe expected from white people unless boundaries were allotted to the\r\nNegroes, so that investors in loans would know definitely what to expect.\r\nOpinions, of course, differed on segregation. It was admitted that a\r\nspreading out of the Negro population in Chicago is to be expected, that\r\nNegroes can hardly be expected to remain in the districts in which they\r\nhave hitherto virtually segregated themselves. But the opinion was also\r\ngiven that their tendency is to remain among and near their own people.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF NEGROES\r\n\r\nThe chief concern of investors, brokers, and real estate dealers is as to\r\nthe ability of Negroes to meet obligations. There is a common belief, not\r\nshaken even by the satisfactory experiences of those who have dealt with\r\nthem, that Negroes have no financial resources, and are thriftless and\r\nimprovident. Inasmuch as a large part of the present housing difficulty\r\nhinges upon this point, the Commission made inquiries as to the thrift\r\nof Negroes. A group of large banks in the \"Loop\" and in neighborhoods\r\nof Negro residents were asked to give their experiences with Negroes\r\nas depositors and investors. In spite of contrary opinion it appears\r\nthat the resources of Negroes in Chicago are astonishingly large. In\r\nthe summer of 1920 in one of the South Side banks operated by white men\r\nNegroes had deposits of $750,000. One banker told of a Negro banker who\r\nsold among the Negroes a bond issue of $150,000 on an old building on\r\nWabash Avenue, paying solicitors 10 per cent commission to make sales.\r\nThe savings deposits in his bank recently had grown very materially. It\r\nwas his experience that only a few Negroes buy bonds. They only inquire\r\ncasually about them.\r\n\r\nThe sales manager for bonds at a large savings bank, however, told of\r\nthe sale of $3,000 worth of bonds to a Negro woman who paid for them\r\nfrom a roll of bills of $10 to $50. Another \"downtown\" broker told of a\r\nNegro porter in a \"Loop\" hotel, who recently loaned $6,000 through his\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nThe information as to Negro deposits, sought by the Commission, was\r\nprovided by seven trust and savings banks, three state banks, two national\r\nbanks, and one trust company. These were able to isolate and check up\r\ntheir Negro deposits. One of the banks had $1,500,000 on deposit for\r\nNegroes; another $1,000,000. Still another had 4,000 Negro depositors.\r\nA state bank had $650,000 on deposit for Negroes, another $150,000 and\r\none of the national banks had $47,000.\r\n\r\nThe average deposits of the Negroes are not so large as those of all\r\nthe depositors. The comparison, however, reveals a fair proportion when\r\nit is considered that there are many very large individual depositors\r\nand business houses among the whites. This is how the amounts run, by\r\ninstitutions:\r\n\r\n     Average Individual Savings Balance     Average Individual Balance\r\n        (White and Negro Combined)                (Negroes Only)\r\n\r\n                $125.00                              $ 50.00\r\n                 108.88                                66.76\r\n                 545.00                               332.00\r\n                 400.00                               200.00\r\n                 120.00                                60.00\r\n                 235.00                               100.00\r\n                 125.00                                10.00\r\n                 196.00                               105.00\r\n                 186.82                               300.00\r\n                 230.00                               186.00\r\n\r\nIt was the almost unanimous report that Negroes are more likely to\r\nwithdraw their accounts than are white people, that their accounts are\r\nless permanent. In two instances only was the opinion expressed that\r\nthey were about the same with both races.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the questionnaire to banks was a list of questions concerning\r\nreal estate loans. One of these was: \"Does your bank make loans to Negroes\r\non real estate, collateral, commercial paper, or personal notes?\" All\r\nexcept one of the trust and savings banks replied in the affirmative.\r\nOne of the state banks buys commercial paper on proper security, but\r\nnot real estate loans because of the difficulty in selling them. One of\r\nthe national banks buys commercial or collateral paper on its merits,\r\nwithout regard to color. Indeed, it appears that no color line is drawn\r\nin this line of business except by the few institutions that decline\r\nall loans to Negroes.\r\n\r\nIn general it was found that the Negroes are showing strong tendencies\r\nto open bank accounts, that they are steadily improving in the amount\r\nof deposits made, in the steadiness of their accounts, and in thrift in\r\ngeneral. However, it appears that in only a few of the banks are they\r\nwelcomed and in most of them they are only tolerated. In banks located in\r\nneighborhoods in which Negroes live there is an amazing number of Negro\r\ndepositors, who receive, as a rule, friendly advice and help in their\r\nfinancial transactions. Thus Negroes are taught banking formalities,\r\nwhile thrift is encouraged, and a good spirit is developed among the white\r\nemployees toward Negro depositors. In some instances, however, Negroes,\r\nlike their white brothers, show suspicion of banking institutions when\r\nthey have suffered losses.\r\n\r\nIt appears also that, in addition to the growing desire to invest in\r\nhomes of their own, Negroes are showing a strong tendency to engage in\r\nbusiness ventures. They are developing insurance companies, co-operative\r\nstores, retail stores of various kinds, and kindred enterprises.\r\n\r\n_Negroes' lack of opportunities for banking experience._--In order to\r\ncarry forward successfully their business undertakings Negroes need\r\npractical personal experience and training in banking and financial\r\nmethods. Yet there is a strong tendency to bar Negroes from employment\r\nin banks, except as porters or in some unskilled capacity, and they are\r\nthus denied the experience needed in solving financial problems among\r\ntheir own race.\r\n\r\nBankers were asked: \"If Negroes competent to learn practical banking\r\nwere available, could you employ them?\" Here are some of the condensed\r\nreplies:\r\n\r\n     1. Other employees would refuse to co-operate with them and\r\n     associate with them.\r\n\r\n     2. They are not reliable as a rule.\r\n\r\n     3. Do not think so.\r\n\r\n     4. Yes.\r\n\r\n     5. No.\r\n\r\n     6. We have no objections beyond the fact that 95 per cent of\r\n     our depositors are white; consequently we would not care to\r\n     employ colored tellers or clerks in handling their business.\r\n\r\n     7. We could not have them in clerical positions.\r\n\r\n     8. In a general way we feel that the employment of Negroes by\r\n     banking institutions would cause trouble with certain classes\r\n     of our depositors.\r\n\r\n     9. Very difficult to work white and colored in same office or\r\n     cages. White customers prefer to have white clerks wait upon\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     10. Clerks who were antagonistic to Negroes would bring\r\n     about constant difficulties through the misplacing of papers,\r\n     mistakes, etc., which would seem to be the fault of the Negroes.\r\n\r\n     11. Have found that a Negro will appear to be strictly honest\r\n     for a period of years and then turn around and prove not to be.\r\n\r\n     12. Our section of the city is entirely white, but with a fear\r\n     of colored invasion. There is, therefore, a strong prejudice\r\n     against them. We have only about half a dozen accounts with\r\n     colored people. Two of these are in the savings department\r\n     and are maintained with large balances. These two customers\r\n     are thrifty and careful with their money. The others are not.\r\n\r\n     13. In former years a bank position was eagerly sought and\r\n     considered exceptionally good. At present, because of higher\r\n     salaries which can be offered by concerns which make greater\r\n     earnings than banks and can therefore pay more, the banks are\r\n     not getting the same high grade of employees. With the former\r\n     class it would have been possible to appeal to their sense of\r\n     duty to help educate the Negroes and to overcome prejudice.\r\n     With present conditions it is not likely that this appeal would\r\n     have the same effect, and prejudice against Negroes would make\r\n     trouble in our routine.\r\n\r\n     14. Social factors enter. For instance, banks often have\r\n     dinners or other events for or among their employees. No \"Loop\"\r\n     hotel would put on an affair for whites and Negroes. There\r\n     is also the difficulty of washrooms, and lockers, etc., where\r\n     prejudiced employees could make a great deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that there is not much chance for the hundreds of\r\nintelligent Negro high-school and college graduates in Chicago to obtain\r\na practical education in banking methods through direct experience. Banks\r\nowned by Negroes are few and small, and there is scarcely any opportunity\r\nto obtain similar experience in Negro building and loan, insurance, and\r\nother companies, which are also limited in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRACIAL CONTACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nContacts of whites and Negroes in the North and South differ according\r\nto the institutions and traditions of the sections in which they have\r\nbeen reared. In the South relations are fixed and generally understood,\r\nalthough Negroes consider the institutions on which these relations are\r\nbased oppressive and consistently oppose them. There the \"color line\"\r\nis drawn rigidly without reference to the desires or comfort of Negroes\r\nor the free expression of their citizenship privileges. Because it is\r\nnearer than the North to the institution of slavery, the South still\r\nmaintains an almost patriarchal relationship with its Negro population.\r\nSmall communities, the plantation system, and the great numbers of\r\nNegroes in domestic service hold the two races steadily in contacts so\r\nclose that class as well as race lines are maintained with deliberateness\r\nand persistence. Even where there are no laws specifically regulating\r\nassociation of the races, the sentiment of the community is enforced,\r\nfrequently in disregard of existing general laws. Thus Negroes may not\r\neat in a restaurant with whites, sit in adjoining seats in a theater,\r\nlive in the same neighborhoods, work together on the same jobs, or attend\r\nthe same schools.\r\n\r\nIn northern communities the institutions are more liberal and with few\r\nexceptions there are no restrictive laws applying specifically to racial\r\nassociation. In fact, the trend of legislation and of court decisions\r\nis strongly toward adopting and enforcing general regulations without\r\nregard to race or color. Relations are less personal, contacts are wider\r\nand more frequent.\r\n\r\nFrom a very simple organization of relations in the South, Negroes are\r\ntransported to more complex relations based on more elaborate urban\r\ndistribution of responsibilities. Thus it happens that whites and Negroes\r\nin Chicago may be found working together in industry, riding together on\r\nstreet cars, attending the same schools, sharing political activities,\r\nwith an increasing number of Negroes holding public office, transacting\r\nbusiness in banks, stores, and real estate, competing in athletics in\r\npublic schools, colleges, and the Y.M.C.A., and conferring on social\r\nproblems in civic and reform clubs.\r\n\r\nThe increasing number of these contacts cannot fail to influence the\r\nnecessary adjustments. The general public seems to accept necessary\r\ncontacts with a minimum of outward friction, as is shown by thousands\r\nof daily contacts. Each contact, however, where there is friction, is\r\na focus of comment, antagonism, resentment, prejudice, or fear. But\r\nassociation in such places as hotels, restaurants, barber shops, dance\r\nhalls, and theaters is often limited by tradition and custom in the\r\nNorth as strictly as by regulation in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. LEGAL STATUS OF NEGROES IN ILLINOIS\r\n\r\nThe legal status of Negroes in Illinois differs in no respect from that\r\nof white persons. The limitations which affect Negroes are established\r\nthrough rules imposed by persons who offer public services and\r\naccommodations. When these rules are unfair, evasive, or even illegal,\r\nthey can be enforced only because of non-enforcement of existing laws.\r\nFederal and state courts are in accord in holding Negro men and women in\r\nIllinois to be citizens of the United States and of the commonwealth,\r\nprotected by the laws against discrimination or oppression on account\r\nof their race or color.\r\n\r\nThere are two lines of decisions in Illinois relating to discriminations\r\non account of color. One line of cases prohibits discrimination in certain\r\npublic places and the other prohibits discrimination against school\r\nchildren. All but two of these cases were tried since the passage of the\r\nSchool Act and the Civil Rights Act, prohibiting such discrimination,\r\nenacted in 1874 and 1885, respectively. The civil-rights cases[28] are\r\nbriefly reviewed below by a consideration of the school cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CIVIL RIGHTS IN PUBLIC PLACES\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights Act, originally passed in 1885, was amended in 1903,\r\nand again in 1911. Section 1 of this act now provides:\r\n\r\n     That all persons within the jurisdiction of said State of\r\n     Illinois shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment\r\n     of the accommodation, advantages, facilities and privileges\r\n     of inns, restaurants, eating houses, hotels, soda-fountains,\r\n     saloons, barber shops, bathrooms, theaters, skating rinks,\r\n     concerts, cafés, bicycle rinks, elevators, ice-cream parlors\r\n     or rooms, railroads, omnibuses, stages, street cars, boats,\r\n     funeral hearses, and public conveyances on land and water,\r\n     and all other places of public accommodation and amusement,\r\n     subject only to the conditions and limitations established by\r\n     law and applicable alike to all citizens; nor shall there be\r\n     any discrimination on account of race or color in the price\r\n     to be charged and paid for lots or graves in any cemetery or\r\n     place for burying the dead, but the price to be charged and\r\n     paid for lots in any cemetery or place for burying the dead\r\n     shall be applicable alike to all citizens of every race and\r\n     color.\r\n\r\nSection 2 provides:\r\n\r\n     That any person who shall violate any of the provisions of\r\n     the foregoing section by denying to any citizen, except for\r\n     reasons applicable alike to all citizens of every race and\r\n     color and regardless of color or race, the full enjoyment of\r\n     any accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges in\r\n     said section enumerated or by aiding or inciting such denial,\r\n     shall for every such offense forfeit and pay a sum not less\r\n     than $25 nor more than $500 to the person aggrieved thereby,\r\n     to be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction in the\r\n     county where said offense was committed, and shall also for\r\n     every such offense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon\r\n     conviction thereof, shall be fined not to exceed $500 or shall\r\n     be imprisoned not more than one year or both; and _provided_\r\n     further, that a judgment in favor of the party aggrieved,\r\n     or punishment upon an indictment, shall be a bar to either\r\n     prosecution respectively.\r\n\r\n_Anna William_ v. _Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company_ (55 Ill.\r\n185)--the first case of color discrimination which reached the supreme\r\ncourt of Illinois--was heard in 1870, before the passage of the Civil\r\nRights Act. The court decided that a railroad company could not exclude\r\na Negro woman on account of her color from a certain car reserved for\r\nthe use of ladies. The evidence showed that the brakeman had refused to\r\npermit the Negro woman to enter the \"ladies' car\" and pushed her away.\r\nThe jury awarded her $200 damages, which the court upheld as reasonable.\r\n\r\nBefore the Amendment of 1903, the Civil Rights Act of 1885 provided that\r\nall persons should be entitled\r\n\r\n     to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodation,\r\n     advantages, facilities and privileges of inns, restaurants,\r\n     eating houses, barber shops, public conveyances on land or\r\n     water, theaters, and all other places of public accommodation\r\n     and amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations\r\n     established by law and applicable alike to all citizens.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, in _Cecil_ v. _Green_ (60 Ill. App., 61; affirmed, 161 Ill.\r\n265), the court decided that the expression \"all other places of public\r\naccommodation\" embraced only places of the same general character as\r\nthose enumerated, and therefore that soda fountains were not included\r\nwithin the general term.\r\n\r\nThe amendment of 1903 included soda fountains, saloons, bathrooms,\r\nskating rinks, concerts, bicycle rinks, elevators, and ice-cream parlors.\r\n\r\nIn _Baylies_ v. _Curry_ (30 Ill. App. 105; affirmed, 128 Ill. 36), decided\r\nin 1889, a Negro woman, after being refused tickets at the box-office of\r\nCurry's Theater, had a white woman purchase two tickets for her in the\r\nbalcony. Upon attempting to use them, the Negro woman and her husband were\r\nreferred back to the box-office and their money returned. The proprietor\r\nintroduced evidence to show that his theater was in a bad neighborhood,\r\nand he had, therefore, adopted the rule of reserving certain rows for\r\nNegroes in each section of the house. The supreme court, in affirming\r\njudgment for $100 damages, said: \"Beyond all question, the Civil Rights\r\nAct prohibits the denial of access to the theater and to the several\r\ncircles or grades of seats therein, because of race or color.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1903, in _Grace_ v. _Moseley_ (112 Ill. App. 100), it was held that\r\nthe statute imposes liability only where the defendant denies or incites\r\na denial of service, not where he merely fails to provide service.\r\n\r\nThe amendment of 1911 provided that there should not be any discrimination\r\non account of race or color in the price charged for lots or graves in\r\nany cemetery.\r\n\r\nRelying upon this provision, Gaskill, a Negro, applied for a writ of\r\nmandamus to compel the Forest Home Cemetery Company to receive the body\r\nof his wife for burial (_People ex rel. Gaskill_ v. _Forest Home Cemetery\r\nCompany_, 258 Ill. 36, 1913). The cemetery company had passed a resolution\r\nin 1907 that thereafter the cemetery would be maintained for the burial\r\nof white persons only--except that colored persons owning lots in the\r\ncemetery, and their direct heirs, should be admitted for burial. Gaskill\r\ndid not own a lot in the cemetery, but four of his children had been\r\nburied there fifteen to twenty years before in single graves separated\r\nfrom each other; and when he applied in 1912 for space for the burial of\r\nhis wife, the company refused permission solely on account of her color.\r\n\r\nThe court held that the 1911 amendment did not prohibit a cemetery\r\ncorporation, which did not have the power of eminent domain under its\r\ncharter and which had no monopoly of the burial places in its vicinity,\r\nfrom making and enforcing a rule excluding colored persons from burial\r\nin its cemetery. The case was taken on writ of error to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States (238 U.S. 606), but the writ was dismissed\r\nfor want of jurisdiction without further comment.\r\n\r\nIn _Dean_ v. _Chicago & Northwestern Railway Company_ (183 Ill. App. 317;\r\n1913), Dean, a Negro, recovered damages of $300 from the railway company\r\nfor its refusal to allow him to ride in a station elevator because of\r\nhis color.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe first school case was decided in 1874, before there was any\r\nstatute forbidding discrimination against Negro children in the public\r\nschools.[30] In _Chase_ v. _Stephenson_ (71 Ill. 383; 1874) a taxpayer\r\nfiled a bill to enjoin the directors of a school district from maintaining\r\na separate school for Negro children; and the court held that the\r\ndirectors had no authority to discriminate on account of color, and the\r\nseparate school was enjoined.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1874, \"An Act to Protect Colored Children in Their Rights to\r\nAttend Public Schools\" was passed which provided:\r\n\r\n     That all directors of schools, boards of education, or other\r\n     school officers, whose duty it now is or may be hereafter\r\n     to provide in their respective jurisdictions schools for the\r\n     education of all children between the ages of six and twenty-one\r\n     years, are prohibited from excluding directly or indirectly\r\n     any such child from such school on account of the color of\r\n     such child.\r\n\r\nTwo school cases have since arisen at Quincy, Illinois. The first,\r\ndecided in 1882 (_People ex rel. Longress_ v. _Board of Education of\r\nQuincy_, 101 Ill. 308), was a _quo warranto_ proceeding, attacking a\r\nregulation of the school board, requiring all Negro children to attend\r\none school, and excluding them from all others. The court held that\r\nthe laws of Illinois prohibited such discrimination and the board was\r\nwithout authority to make the regulation.\r\n\r\nIn the second Quincy case, decided in 1888 (_People_ v. _McFall and\r\nBoard of Education of Quincy_ 26 Ill. App. 319; affirmed, 124 Ill. 642),\r\nthe petition for _quo warranto_ charged that the Board of Education\r\nhad continued the illegal discrimination against Negro children ever\r\nsince the decision in the first case. The petition was supported by a\r\nnumber of affidavits of Negroes. After a full hearing on affidavits and\r\ncounter-affidavits the trial court denied the petition. The appellate\r\ncourt affirmed the judgment, characterizing the affidavits in support\r\nof the petition as \"vague and unsatisfactory\"; and the supreme court\r\naffirmed the judgment.\r\n\r\nQuincy has fourteen schools, and the School Board has divided the city\r\ninto four school districts. The Lincoln School is exclusively a Negro\r\nschool and is the only school in the district in which most of the\r\nNegroes live. All white children in that district are transferred to other\r\nschools, and the few Negro children outside the Lincoln district are urged\r\nto attend the Lincoln School. The Negro teachers and Negro principal\r\nof the Lincoln School are paid higher salaries than other teachers in\r\nQuincy, and are told that if they wish to maintain themselves in the\r\nQuincy schools, they must persuade Negro children in other districts\r\nto attend the Lincoln School. In this way the board has succeeded in\r\nconfining Negro children with few exceptions to the Lincoln School. Yet\r\nsome Negroes are attending five other schools, including the high school.\r\n\r\nThere have also been two school cases from Alton, Illinois. The first\r\ncase was _People_ v. _Board of Education of Upper Alton_ (127 Ill. 613),\r\ndecided in 1889. This was a proceeding by mandamus, begun in the supreme\r\ncourt by John Peair, to compel the Board of Education to admit his two\r\nchildren to the high school of Upper Alton. Certain issues of fact were\r\ncertified to the circuit court for trial by jury. The jury returned a\r\ngeneral verdict in favor of the Board of Education, notwithstanding the\r\nfollowing special findings in answer to questions asked by the relator,\r\nJohn Peair:\r\n\r\n     _Q._: When application was made ... to the principal in charge\r\n     of the said building on behalf of relator's two children\r\n     for permission to attend school in said building, was such\r\n     permission refused by said principal because said children\r\n     were colored?\r\n\r\n     _A._: Yes.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: Have not the children of relator, John Peair, been\r\n     excluded from attending school in said high school building\r\n     by the defendants on account of the color of said children?\r\n\r\n     _A._: Yes.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court held that the general verdict in favor of the Board of\r\nEducation was \"so manifestly the result of misdirection by the court as\r\nto be entitled to no consideration,\" and a writ of mandamus was ordered.\r\n\r\nThe second school case from Alton, though begun in 1899, was not finally\r\ndecided until 1908. This was a petition for mandamus filed in the supreme\r\ncourt by Scott Bibb to compel the mayor and city council of Alton to admit\r\nhis children to the Washington School which they had been attending, and\r\nfrom which he alleged they were excluded on account of color and were\r\ntransferred to a school attended only by Negro children. The supreme\r\ncourt certified the case to the circuit court of Madison County for\r\nthe trial of certain issues of facts. Before the supreme court finally\r\nordered the mandamus to issue in 1908 the case had been tried by a jury\r\nseven times, had been before the supreme court five times, and the Bibb\r\nchildren were grown up. It is interesting as a flagrant example of race\r\nprejudice in the trial judge and jury.\r\n\r\nIn this case (_People ex rel. Scott Bibb_ v. _Mayor and Common Council\r\nof Alton_, 233 Ill. 542) the supreme court said:\r\n\r\n     The issues in this case have been tried seven times by juries\r\n     in the circuit court, and in two of them the jury disagreed.\r\n     Upon the first trial where there was a verdict it was in\r\n     favor of the respondents, and it was certified to this court.\r\n     That verdict was set aside for manifest error prejudicial\r\n     to the relator in rulings of the court in the admission of\r\n     evidence. (_People ex rel._ v. _Mayor and Common Council of\r\n     Alton_, 179 Ill. 615.) There was another trial resulting in a\r\n     verdict in favor of the respondents, which was set aside on\r\n     account of a misdirection of the court in submitting to the\r\n     jury a question of law. (_People ex rel._ v. _Mayor and Common\r\n     Council of Alton_, 193 Ill. 309.) Upon another trial there\r\n     was a third verdict in favor of the respondents, which this\r\n     court set aside because clearly contrary to the facts proved\r\n     and without any support in the evidence. It was proved at that\r\n     trial, beyond dispute or controversy, that the respondents\r\n     were guilty of the charge contained in the petition, and the\r\n     evidence introduced by them had no tendency to prove that the\r\n     intention clearly manifested by their acts did not exist. The\r\n     verdict could only be accounted for as a product of passion,\r\n     prejudice or hostility to the law. (_People ex rel._ v. _Mayor\r\n     and Common Council of Alton_, 209 Ill. 461.) The attorney for\r\n     relator then urged that a peremptory writ should be awarded\r\n     on the ground that the evidence in the record clearly showed\r\n     the relator to be entitled to it. The relator, however, had\r\n     not requested the circuit court to direct a verdict in his\r\n     favor, and it was said that if such a motion had been made the\r\n     court would doubtless have granted it. The court said that the\r\n     issues were sent to the circuit court for trial in conformity\r\n     with the practice governing the trial of issues of fact in\r\n     actions at law before a jury, and it was not deemed advisable,\r\n     in the existing condition of the record, to set aside that\r\n     order. The case was sent back for another trial, and upon the\r\n     next trial the attorney for relator moved the court to direct\r\n     a verdict in his favor, and this the court refused to do,\r\n     assigning as a reason that this court had directed that the\r\n     issues be submitted to another jury. The excuse was so shallow\r\n     and baseless as to justify a conclusion that it was a mere\r\n     pretext to evade a compliance with the law as declared by this\r\n     court, and the verdict was set aside and the circuit court\r\n     directed, in the trial of the questions of fact, to proceed in\r\n     accordance with the opinion then filed and the earlier opinions\r\n     in the case. (_People ex rel._ v. _Mayor and Common Council\r\n     of Alton_, 221 Ill. 275.) The case has been again tried, and\r\n     a verdict in favor of the respondents, unsupported by any\r\n     evidence, has been returned to this court. The evidence was to\r\n     all intents and purposes the same as upon the former trials,\r\n     and demonstrated, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the\r\n     children of relator were excluded from the Washington School,\r\n     which was the most convenient of the public schools of the\r\n     city to which they had the right to be admitted, and that the\r\n     exclusion was solely on account of their race and color, and\r\n     for no other reason whatever. The evidence for the respondents\r\n     that nothing was said about schools or colored children by the\r\n     mayor and council in changing the ordinances for the purpose\r\n     of excluding colored children from schools attended by white\r\n     children; that the intention to exclude them was not declared,\r\n     or that orders were never issued to the police, or that the\r\n     mayor never intended the police force under his control to\r\n     do what they did and what he knew they were doing, had no\r\n     tendency whatever to prove that the children of the relator\r\n     were not excluded by the respondents on account of their race\r\n     or color. At the conclusion of the evidence the attorney for\r\n     the relator moved the court to direct a verdict finding the\r\n     issues in favor of the relator and presented to the court a\r\n     written instruction for that purpose, but the court denied\r\n     the motion and refused to give the instruction. In so doing\r\n     the court erred, and the error was in a matter of law, and\r\n     contrary to the law in this case as declared by this court in\r\n     previous opinions filed in the case.\r\n\r\n     The attorney for respondents says that we ought to approve\r\n     this verdict for the reason that the questions of fact have\r\n     been tried seven times in the circuit court; that the juries\r\n     have twice disagreed and five juries have decided in favor of\r\n     the respondents, and all the trials have been presided over by\r\n     learned judges. Great weight is justly given to the conclusion\r\n     of a jury upon controverted questions of fact where the verdict\r\n     appears to be the result of an honest exercise of judgment and\r\n     the weighing, with fair deliberation, of the credibility of\r\n     witnesses, but it is beyond dispute that this verdict, when\r\n     viewed in the most favorable light for the respondents, does\r\n     not represent any conclusion of the jury from the evidence, and\r\n     that all of the verdicts represent nothing but a refusal by\r\n     juries to enforce a law which they do not personally approve\r\n     or which is distasteful to them. In the first opinion filed\r\n     in this case it was said that it might be that the wisest\r\n     of both races believe that the best interests of each would\r\n     be promoted by voluntary separation in the public schools,\r\n     but that it is no less the duty of courts to enforce the law\r\n     as it stands, without respect to race or persons. We would\r\n     be remiss in our duty to enforce the law and would forfeit\r\n     the respect of all law-abiding citizens if we should approve\r\n     this verdict for no other reason than because it is one of\r\n     a series which represent, not the enforcement of law or the\r\n     discharge of duty, but a deplorable disregard for the law and\r\n     for the rights of citizens. The verdicts have all been more\r\n     offensive and dangerous assaults upon the law, the government,\r\n     and organized societies, than utterances of individuals or\r\n     societies who are opposed to all law, and which are regarded\r\n     only as the sentiments of the ignorant, depraved and vicious\r\n     who are the enemies of a government of laws. These verdicts\r\n     were pronounced, not by those who were avowed enemies of law\r\n     and government, but by those who constituted a part of the\r\n     governmental machinery for the enforcement of the law and\r\n     who had been sworn to discharge their duty in that regard.\r\n     Such verdicts not only denote opposition to the enforcement\r\n     of the law, but they also jeopardize the highest interests of\r\n     society and individuals. When the law, through the refusal of\r\n     jurors to regard their oaths, becomes impotent to protect the\r\n     rights of the humblest, the rights of no person are secure;\r\n     and jurors may take heed that they obey and enforce the law,\r\n     lest their refusal to enforce the law for the protection of\r\n     others becomes effective to deprive them of their legal rights\r\n     and substitute the beliefs of jurors and courts as to the\r\n     wisdom of laws enacted for their protection. The error of the\r\n     court in refusing to direct a verdict is not obviated by the\r\n     fact that there have been so many verdicts contrary to the\r\n     law and the evidence. The verdict must be set aside, and the\r\n     next question is whether the issues shall be again sent to\r\n     the circuit court for trial.\r\n\r\n     In this case the effort to obtain a fair trial of the issues\r\n     of fact before a jury has proved utterly futile, and upon the\r\n     trial now under review the court refused to direct a verdict\r\n     in passing upon a question of law raised by the motion of the\r\n     relator for such a direction. It is clear that after so many\r\n     trials there can be no further evidence produced by either party\r\n     but that all the evidence relating to the issues is before us.\r\n     We are of the opinion that it would be a wrong to the relator\r\n     to further delay him in establishing his rights and to compel\r\n     him to add to the trouble and expense already incurred in an\r\n     effort to compel obedience to the law. The verdict of the jury\r\n     is set aside and the issues will not be again certified to\r\n     the circuit court for trial but will now be finally disposed\r\n     of. The averments of the petition have been fully proved upon\r\n     repeated trials and the evidence is preserved in the record.\r\n     The evidence produced by the respondents affords no support\r\n     to their answer.\r\n\r\n     We therefore find that all the material facts alleged in the\r\n     petition are true as therein stated and that the relator is\r\n     entitled to a writ of _mandamus_ as therein prayed, and it is\r\n     therefore ordered that a peremptory writ of _mandamus_ issue\r\n     according to the prayer of the petition, that the respondents\r\n     pay the costs, and that execution issue therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. CONTACTS IN CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe public schools furnish one of the most important points of contact\r\nbetween the white and Negro races, because of the actual number of\r\ncontacts in the daily school life of thousands of Negro and white\r\nchildren, and also because the reactions of young children should indicate\r\nwhether or not there is instinctive race prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Board of Education makes no distinction between Negro and\r\nwhite children. There are no separate schools for Negroes. None of the\r\nrecords of any teacher or principal shows which children are Negroes and\r\nwhich white. The board does not know how many Negro children there are\r\nin any school or in the city at large, nor how many of the teachers are\r\nNegroes. It was impossible to obtain from the board, for example, a list\r\nof the schools having a large Negro enrolment with which to begin the\r\ninvestigation. An unfortunate but unavoidable incidental effect of the\r\ninvestigation was the focusing of attention of principals and teachers\r\non the Negroes in their schools.\r\n\r\nFrequently white teachers in charge of classes with Negro pupils are\r\nrace conscious and accept the conduct of white children as normal and pay\r\ndisproportionate attention to the conduct of Negro children as exceptional\r\nand distinctive. As a result of the focusing of attention on Negro\r\nchildren, the inquiry, which was intended to get balanced information,\r\ndeveloped a disproportionate amount of information concerning their\r\nconduct as compared with that of whites. Teachers who considered both\r\nraces were inclined to believe that Negro children as a group had no\r\nspecial weaknesses that white children as a group did not also exhibit;\r\nthat some Negro children, like any other children, were good, some were\r\nbad, and some indifferent, and that no generalizations about the race\r\ncould be made from the characteristics or attitude of a few.\r\n\r\nIt became evident as soon as the investigation started that it was\r\nnecessary to distinguish between the northern and the southern Negro.\r\nThe southern Negro is conspicuous the moment one enters the elementary\r\nschools. Over-age or retarded children are found in all the lower grades,\r\nspecial classes, and ungraded rooms, and are noticeable all the way to\r\nthe eighth grade, where seventeen- and nineteen-year-old children are\r\nsometimes found. In some schools these children are found in the regular\r\nclasses; in others there are special rooms for retarded children, and\r\nas these groups are often composed almost entirely of Negro children,\r\nthere is an appearance of segregation which made necessary a study of\r\nthese retarded children from the South.\r\n\r\nThe southern child is hampered first of all by lack of educational\r\nopportunity in the South. He is usually retarded by two or more years\r\nwhen he enters the northern school because he has never been able\r\nto attend school regularly, due to the short term in southern rural\r\nschools, distance from school, and inadequacy of teaching force and\r\nschool equipment. According to a report by the United States Bureau of\r\nEducation on _Negro Education_[31] 90 per cent of the Negro children\r\nbetween fifteen and twenty years of age attending school in the South\r\nare over-age. Says this report:\r\n\r\n     The inadequacy of the elementary school system for colored\r\n     children is indicated both by the comparisons of public\r\n     appropriations and by the fact that the attendance in both\r\n     public and private schools is only 58.1 per cent of the children\r\n     six to fourteen years of age. The average length of the public\r\n     school term is less than five months in practically all of the\r\n     states. Most of the school buildings, especially those in the\r\n     rural districts, are in wretched condition. There is little\r\n     supervision and little effort to improve the schools or adapt\r\n     their efforts to the needs of the community. The reports of\r\n     the state departments of Georgia and Alabama indicate that 70\r\n     per cent of the colored teachers have third grade or temporary\r\n     certificates, representing a preparation less than that usually\r\n     given in the first eight elementary grades. Investigations made\r\n     by supervisors of colored schools in other states indicate\r\n     that the percentage of poorly prepared colored teachers is\r\n     almost as high in the other southern states.[32]\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of Negro teachers' salaries is shown by the per capita\r\nexpenditure in six southern states for each white and Negro child between\r\nsix and fourteen years of age. The salary of the teacher, expressed in\r\nper capita for each child, ranges from $5.27 to $13.79 for white pupils\r\nand from $1.44 to $8.53 for Negro pupils. South Carolina pays its white\r\nteachers ten times as much as its Negro teachers. Alabama pays its white\r\nteachers about nine times as much. In Kentucky the per capita for white\r\nand colored is about the same.[33]\r\n\r\nDistribution of school funds by counties indicated a decreasing per\r\ncapita expenditure for the Negro as the proportion of Negroes in the\r\ncounty increased. A table from the Bulletin shows:[34]\r\n\r\n   ========================================================================\r\n    County Groups,   |   White    |   Negro    | Per Capita   | Per Capita\r\n     Percentage of   |   School   |   School   | Expenditure, | Expenditure,\r\n     Negroes in the  | Population | Population |     White    |    Negro\r\n     Population      |            |            |              |\r\n   ------------------+------------+------------+--------------+------------\r\n   Counties under    |    974,289 |     45,039 |        $7.96 |       $7.23\r\n     10 per cent     |            |            |              |\r\n   ------------------+------------+------------+--------------+------------\r\n   Counties 10 to    |  1,008,372 |    215,774 |         9.55 |        5.55\r\n     25 per cent     |            |            |              |\r\n   ------------------+------------+------------+--------------+------------\r\n   Counties 25 to    |  1,132,999 |    709,259 |        11.11 |        3.19\r\n     50 per cent     |            |            |              |\r\n   ------------------+------------+------------+--------------+------------\r\n   Counties 50 to    |    364,990 |    661,329 |        12.53 |        1.77\r\n     75 per cent     |            |            |              |\r\n   ------------------+------------+------------+--------------+------------\r\n   Counties 75 to    |     40,003 |    207,900 |        22.22 |        1.78\r\n     100 per cent    |            |            |              |\r\n   =========================================================================\r\n\r\nA southern state superintendent of education is quoted in the report,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     There has never been any serious attempt in this state to\r\n     offer adequate educational facilities for the colored race. The\r\n     average length of the term for the state is only four months;\r\n     practically all of the schools are taught in dilapidated\r\n     churches, which, of course, are not equipped with suitable\r\n     desks, blackboards, and the other essentials of a school;\r\n     practically all of the teachers are incompetent, possessing\r\n     little or no education and having had no professional training\r\n     whatever, except a few weeks obtained in the summer schools;\r\n     the schools are generally overcrowded, some of them having as\r\n     many as 100 students to the teacher; no attempt is made to do\r\n     more than teach the children to read, write, and figure, and\r\n     these subjects are learned very imperfectly.[35]\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty was suggested by the principal of a Chicago school\r\n(Webster) where 30 per cent of the children are Negroes, who said:\r\n\"We base our educational ideas on certain backgrounds. The curriculum\r\nin Chicago was planned for children who come from families who are\r\neducated. It doesn't take children coming from uneducated families into\r\nconsideration. That isn't fair either to the white or colored children.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem of readjustment to life in a northern city also affects the\r\nchild's school life, and he is self-conscious and inclined to be either\r\ntoo timid or too self-assertive. A Negro teacher in speaking of the\r\ndifficulties confronting the southern Negro, as well as the whole Negro\r\ngroup, said:\r\n\r\n     The southern Negro has pushed the Chicago Negro out of his home,\r\n     and the Chicago Negro in seeking a new home is opposed by the\r\n     whites. What is to happen? The whites are prejudiced against\r\n     the whole Negro group. The Chicago Negro is prejudiced against\r\n     the southern Negro. Surely it makes a difficult situation for\r\n     the southern Negro. No wonder he meets a word with a blow.\r\n     And all this comes into the school more or less.\r\n\r\nAnother Negro teacher thus analyzes further the adjustment problems\r\nwhich tend to make the Negro newly come from the South unpopular with\r\nthe Chicago Negro, as well as with the whites:\r\n\r\n     These families from the South usually come from the country\r\n     where there are no close neighbors.... Then the family is\r\n     transplanted to Chicago to an apartment house, and even in\r\n     with another family. The whole environment is changed and\r\n     the trouble begins. No sense of property rights, no idea of\r\n     how to use conveniences, no idea of how to live in the new\r\n     home, to keep it up, to live with everybody else so near.\r\n     On top of that, the father does not fit into his work, and\r\n     therefore cannot support the family; the mother goes out to\r\n     work, and what is the result? Poorly kept houses and poorly\r\n     kept children.... A normal home shows itself in the school,\r\n     and poor home conditions show up still more.\r\n\r\nThe Negro child born in the North is not found to an unusual extent among\r\nthe retarded children. He has been able to enter school on time and to\r\nattend the full term of nine months; his teachers compare favorably with\r\nthose in white American and foreign neighborhoods, and his parents as\r\na rule have a better background. Many teachers say that the progress of\r\nnorthern-born Negroes compares very favorably with that of whites.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT OF SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nSince the Board of Education keeps no record of Negro children as such,\r\nit could not furnish a list of the schools having a percentage of Negro\r\nchildren. Therefore a list was made up of all the schools in the Negro\r\nresidential areas, the boundaries of these schools were obtained from the\r\nBoard of Education, and the percentage of Negroes in each school district\r\nwas worked out from the 1920 census figures. The schools listed in Table\r\nX were found to be situated in districts where the Negro population\r\nwas 10 per cent or more. The figures at the right show the approximate\r\npercentage of Negro children in the school, as given by the principal\r\nof the school.\r\n\r\nFuller School is a branch of Felsenthal and has the same principal;\r\nit is in a neighborhood where the percentage of Negroes is practically\r\nthe same as in the neighborhoods around Felsenthal, but there is a very\r\ngreat difference in the percentage of Negro children in the two schools,\r\naccording to figures given by the principal. It appears from this that\r\nthe principal, who is a believer in separate schools, places the large\r\nmajority of the Negro children in Fuller School. Negroes in the vicinity\r\nsay that Fuller School is run down and neglected, that the staff of\r\nteachers is below the average, that the school has no playground of its\r\nown but must use the one at Felsenthal, and that all the unmanageable\r\nchildren are sent there from Felsenthal. It is also believed by these\r\nNegroes that Fuller is used as a feeder for the other schools in the\r\nneighborhoods where there are fewer Negro children.\r\n\r\n                                  TABLE X\r\n\r\n     SCHOOLS IN DISTRICTS HAVING AN AVERAGE NEGRO POPULATION\r\n     OF 10 PER CENT OR MORE\r\n\r\n     ==============================+=============+==============\r\n                                   |Percentage of|Percentage of\r\n                 School            | Negroes in  |Negro Children\r\n                                   |  District   |  in School\r\n     ------------------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n     Colman                        |     81      |      92\r\n     Copernicus                    |     18      |      23\r\n     Doolittle                     |     65      |      85\r\n     Douglas                       |     72      |      93\r\n     Drake                         |     28      |      24\r\n     Emerson (branch of Hayes)     |     70      |      75\r\n     Farren                        |     69      |      92\r\n     Felsenthal                    |     38      |      20\r\n     Forrestville                  |     20      |      38\r\n     Fuller (branch of Felsenthal) |     42      |      90\r\n     Haven                         |     24      |      20\r\n     Hayes                         |     70      |      80\r\n     Keith                         |     89      |      90\r\n     McCosh                        |     13      |      15\r\n     Mann (branch of Raymond)      |     39      |      25\r\n     Moseley                       |     46      |      70\r\n     Oakland                       |     17      |      26\r\n     Raymond                       |     85      |      93\r\n     Sherwood                      |     20      |      25\r\n     Tennyson                      |     14      |      28\r\n     Webster                       |     50      |      30\r\n     Willard                       |     15      |      13\r\n     ------------------------------+-------------+--------------\r\n\r\nThe points in regard to physical equipment stressed by a district\r\nsuperintendent in the area containing the largest number of schools\r\nattended mainly by Negroes were: date of erection, an assembly hall\r\nlocated on the main floor, gymnasium, and, in the congested districts,\r\nbathroom and lunchroom.

A\r\nreally useful assembly hall, he stated, should be on the ground floor,\r\nopening directly on the school yard, and capable of being shut off\r\nentirely from the rest of the building so that it could be lighted and\r\nheated separately for evening gatherings. Only three of these fifteen\r\nschools had separate gymnasiums. In the others the gymnasium was combined\r\nwith the assembly hall. There was little in the way of apparatus;\r\nwhat there was consisted mainly of hand apparatus, including clubs,\r\ndumbbells and basket-balls, that could be used in the assembly hall\r\nor the corridors. The district superintendent emphasized the need for\r\ngymnasiums in Negro residential areas because the children were weak\r\nphysically and needed special exercises.\r\n\r\nPlayground space for schools attended largely by Negroes compares\r\nfavorably with that for schools attended largely by whites, though Douglas\r\nSchool (92 per cent Negro), with 1,513 pupils, has only one playground\r\n96×125 feet. Most schools have two playgrounds, one for boys and one for\r\ngirls. The only other school having such limited play space as Douglas\r\nis a foreign school, Von Humboldt, where there are 2,500 pupils and the\r\nplayground is 50×100 feet. Like Douglas, this is a double school with\r\ninadequate space for the children inside the school and outside. Sometimes\r\nthere is a public playground near by which relieves the congestion on\r\nthe school playground except in the case of Keith School (90 per cent\r\nNegro), the principal of which emphasized the need for a playground near\r\nher school.\r\n\r\nIn a group of twenty-four schools, six of which are attended mainly by\r\nNegroes, six mainly by white Americans, and twelve mainly by children of\r\nimmigrants, it was found that there was no unusual crowding of classrooms\r\nin those attended mainly by Negroes except in the case of Douglas School.\r\nConditions were practically the same in the three groups of schools.\r\n\r\nIndications of overcrowding are the average number of seats in a\r\nclassroom, the average number of pupils per teacher, and the double-school\r\nor shift system. There is little variation among the three groups of\r\nschools in the number of seats in the classroom and the number of pupils\r\nto each teacher, except that the school having the largest number of\r\npupils to each teacher (57) is Colman, 92 per cent Negro. Although there\r\nare no double schools in the group attended mainly by white Americans,\r\none of the six schools attended mainly by Negroes and five of the schools\r\nattended mainly by children of immigrants are double schools. Under this\r\nsystem, which is a makeshift in a neighborhood where another school is\r\nneeded to take care of the children, the children go to school in two\r\nshifts, one shift an hour later than the other, and leave correspondingly\r\nlater in the afternoon. Under this arrangement more children are at\r\nthe school during the major part of the day than can be seated in the\r\nclassroom and the full school curriculum can be carried on only under\r\npressure, as one group of children must always be hurried on before the\r\nnext group appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SCHOOL CONTACT PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nInformation as to problems of contact in the schools was gathered from\r\nconferences to which the principals of high and elementary schools were\r\ninvited, and by personal visits to the schools. Thirteen elementary\r\nschools were visited, seven of which had an enrolment of less than 50\r\nper cent Negro, and six of which had an enrolment of more than 50 per\r\ncent Negro. The schools with the smaller percentage were: Drake (30),[37]\r\nFelsenthal (20), Forrestville (38), Haven (20), Oakland (26), Webster\r\n(30), and Kenwood (a very small number of Negroes). The schools having\r\na majority Negro were Colman (92), Doolittle (85), Douglas (93), Farren\r\n(92), Keith (90), and Moseley (70).\r\n\r\nThe high schools visited were Englewood, Hyde Park, and Wendell Phillips.\r\nIn Englewood and Hyde Park the percentage of Negroes was very small,\r\nwhile in Wendell Phillips the Negro children were about 56 per cent of\r\nthe enrolment.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of principals and teachers about Negro children are a\r\ncross-section of public opinion on the race question with all its\r\ncontradictions and irritations. It must therefore be borne in mind in\r\nreading this section on school contacts that whether Negro children are\r\nreported good or bad, bright or dull, quarrelsome or amiable, whether\r\nantagonism and voluntary grouping or their lack are reported, there is\r\nan inevitable tendency for the teacher to see the facts in the light of\r\nany prejudice or general views she may have on race relations.\r\n\r\nIt was thought, for example, that for the purposes of this discussion\r\nthe schools could be put in two general groups: those with less than 50\r\nper cent Negroes and those with more than 50 per cent Negroes. But it was\r\nimmediately apparent that no generalizations could be made on the basis\r\nof the percentage of Negro children in the schools, because sometimes two\r\nprincipals of schools having the same proportion of Negro pupils reported\r\nwidely different experience with reference to friction; and in some\r\ncases principals of schools with a small percentage of Negroes reported\r\nfriction, while other principals of schools with a larger percentage\r\nreported harmonious relations. The most important factor determining the\r\nattitude of the teachers in a school was invariably the attitude of the\r\nprincipal. Though there were many cases where individual teachers held\r\nviews entirely different from those of the principal, yet the attitude\r\nof the principal was usually reflected in the expressed opinion of the\r\nteachers and in the atmosphere of the school.\r\n\r\nBut there is no explanation for total disagreement between two teachers\r\nin the same school as to whether or not there is race friction in the\r\nschool except difference in points of view on the race problem. This\r\nfactor is to be taken into consideration in weighing the testimony of\r\nteachers regarding school contacts of the races.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of some of the principals and teachers was revealed in their\r\nfear that their schools, with 20 per cent or 30 per cent Negro children,\r\nwould be regarded as largely Negro schools. The principal of a school\r\nwith 30 per cent Negro children considered it an insult to be asked\r\nto have his school take part in a song festival with schools largely\r\nattended by Negroes. A teacher in a school 26 per cent Negro was much\r\nincensed because the Board of Education had sent Negroes to the school\r\nto talk to the children on cleaning up the neighborhood. She said that\r\nthe white children did not seem to mind and listened interestedly; it\r\nwas the teachers who considered it an outrage that Negroes should come\r\nto \"tell a community seven-eighths white to clean up.\"\r\n\r\nSince the elementary schools and high schools present rather different\r\nproblems, due to the greater number of social activities in the latter,\r\nit was decided to consider the two groups separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe contacts in the elementary schools fall naturally under three heads:\r\nclassroom contacts, building and playground contacts, and social contacts.\r\n\r\n_Classroom contacts._--There was much less variety of opinion in regard\r\nto classroom contacts than the other two. Most teachers agreed that there\r\nwas little friction so far as school work was concerned, even when it\r\nmeant sitting next to one another or in the same seats. Most kindergarten\r\nteachers found the most natural relationship existing between the young\r\nNegro and white children. \"Neither colored nor whites have any feeling\r\nin our kindergarten,\" said one principal in a school 30 per cent Negro\r\n(Webster); \"they don't understand the difference between colored and white\r\nchildren.\" In visiting one school the investigator noticed that the white\r\nchildren who objected to holding hands with the Negro children in the\r\nkindergarten and first and second grades were the better-dressed children\r\nwho undoubtedly reflected the economic class and race consciousness of\r\ntheir parents. The Armour Mission near the school had excluded Negroes\r\nfrom its kindergarten, thereby fostering this spirit among the whites.\r\nA teacher in Doolittle (85 per cent) told of a little white girl in\r\nanother school who cried because she was afraid the color from the Negro\r\nchildren's hands would rub off on hers; in her present school she has\r\nknown no such instances in the kindergarten. This conduct is paralleled\r\nin instances in which Negro children who have never had any contact with\r\nwhite children in the South are afraid of them when they first come North.\r\n\r\nMost of the teachers in the higher grades reported that there were no\r\nsigns of race prejudice in the room. A teacher at Oakland (26 per cent)\r\nsaid that white girls sometimes asked to be moved to another seat when\r\nnear a very dirty Negro child, but that this often happened when the\r\ndirty child was white. This teacher said it was the white mothers from\r\nthe South, not the children, who wanted their children to be kept away\r\nfrom the Negroes. \"The white children don't seem to mind the colored,\"\r\nshe said. \"I have had three or four mothers come in and ask that their\r\nchildren be kept away from the colored, but they were women from the\r\nSouth and felt race prejudice strongly. But they are the only ones who\r\nhave complained.\"\r\n\r\nA teacher in a school 90 per cent Negro said that when doubling up in\r\nthe seats was necessary whites and Negroes frequently chose each other.\r\nA teacher at Moseley (70 per cent), when the investigator was present,\r\ncalled upon a white girl to act as hostess to a Negro girl who had just\r\ncome from the South, and the request was met with pride and pleasure\r\nby the white girl. On the same occasion a white boy was asked to help a\r\nNegro boy with his arithmetic, and the two doubled up and worked together\r\nquite naturally.\r\n\r\n\"Race makes no difference,\" declared the principal of a school 92 per cent\r\nNegro (Colman). \"The other day I had them all digging in the garden, and\r\nwhen they were all ready to go in I kept out one colored boy to help me\r\nplant seeds. We could use another boy, so I told Henry to choose anyone\r\nout of two rooms and he returned with an Italian. The color makes no\r\ndifference.\"\r\n\r\nA few instances of jealousy are cited. In one of them resentment ran\r\nhigh because when a loving cup was presented in McKinley (70 per cent)\r\nfor the best composition, it was awarded by a neutral outside jury to a\r\nwhite girl. The principal of this 70 per cent Negro school, in addition\r\nto finding the Negro children jealous, considered their parents insolent\r\nand resentful. On the investigator's first visit she said that military\r\ndiscipline was the only kind for children, and that absolute segregation\r\nwas necessary. At the next interview she said she preferred her school\r\nto any other; that there was never any disciplinary difficulty, and that\r\nwhite children who had moved from the district were paying car fare to\r\nfinish their course at her school.\r\n\r\n_Discipline._--There was considerable variety of opinion among the\r\nteachers as to whether Negro children presented any special problems of\r\ndiscipline. The principal of a school 20 per cent Negro (Felsenthal),\r\nfor example, said that discipline was more difficult in this school than\r\nin the branch where 90 per cent were Negroes (Fuller). This principal\r\nis an advocate of separate schools. She was contradicted by a teacher\r\nin her school who said she had never used different discipline for\r\nthe Negroes. In schools where the principals were sympathetic and the\r\ninterracial spirit good the teachers reported that Negro children were\r\nmuch like other children and could be disciplined in the same way. One or\r\ntwo teachers reported that Negro children could not be scolded but must\r\nbe \"jollied along\" and the work presented as play. This is interesting\r\nin view of the frequent complaint of the children from the South that\r\nthe teachers in Chicago played with them all the time and did not teach\r\nthem anything.\r\n\r\n_Attitude toward Negro teachers._--Few Negro teachers were found in the\r\nschools investigated.\r\n\r\nAt Doolittle (85 per cent) there were thirty-three teachers, of whom two\r\nwere Negroes. There was also a Negro cadet. At Raymond (93 per cent) there\r\nwere six Negro teachers and a Negro cadet in a staff of forty. At Keith\r\n(90 per cent) there were six Negro teachers in a staff of twelve. Two of\r\nthese principals said that their Negro teachers compared favorably with\r\ntheir white teachers and that some of them were excellent. Asked whether\r\nthere was much antagonism if a Negro teacher was assigned where all the\r\nchildren were white, the principal of a 93 per cent school (Raymond)\r\nsaid there had been one or two such cases. \"They are most successful in\r\nthe foreign districts on the West Side. The European people do not seem\r\nto resent the presence of a colored teacher.\"\r\n\r\nAnother principal said that this was especially true where the foreign\r\nelement was Jewish. A Negro teacher in a West Side school, largely\r\nItalian, is considered one of the ablest teachers in the school and\r\nproved herself highly competent during the war, when she assisted with\r\nthe work of the draft board in the district.\r\n\r\nOne or two principals said that they would not have Negro teachers in\r\ntheir schools because the white teachers \"could not be intimate with\r\ncolored teachers,\" or because Negro teachers were \"cocky,\" or because \"the\r\n_Defender_ preaches propaganda for colored teachers to seek positions in\r\nwhite schools.\" Sometimes an effort was made to explain the principal's\r\nobjection to Negro teachers by saying that Negro children had no respect\r\nfor Negro teachers. One principal whose white teachers were rather below\r\nthe accepted standard said that the one colored teacher who had been\r\nthere was obliged to leave because of the children's protest against her.\r\nA Negro teacher in a 20 per cent school (Haven) was valued highly by\r\nthe principal, who advised with her as to what measures could be taken\r\nto prevent the appearance of race feeling. This teacher formerly taught\r\nin a school where there were no Negro children and had experienced no\r\ndifficulty in either type of school. \"The children just seem to forget\r\nI am colored,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIn Farren School (92 per cent) a teacher of a special room for children\r\nrecently arrived from the South expressed the belief that these children\r\n\"have a distinct and decided fear of the white teacher and it's up to\r\nthe teacher to change this fear into respect.\" They were very timid at\r\nfirst, she said, due to the new environment and the contact with so many\r\nmore people, especially white. This timidity lasted for about a year\r\nand then these children became more like Chicago children.\r\n\r\n_Building and playground contacts._--At six out of the thirteen elementary\r\nschools some friction about the buildings and on the playgrounds was\r\nreported, and none at the other seven schools. On further analysis it\r\nappeared that the friction reported was general at only two of the six\r\nschools. At the other four the instances cited seemed either to involve\r\na few troublesome individuals or to be quarrels among Negro children\r\nrather than between Negroes and whites. The two schools reporting general\r\nantagonism between Negro and white children had about 30 per cent Negro\r\nchildren. The principals of these schools said that the white children\r\nwere dominated by the Negroes and did not dare stand up for their\r\nrights. The testimony of the principal of one of these schools showed a\r\ndisposition to regard many acts as characteristically racial. For example,\r\nshe needed no further evidence that a Negro boy had cut up a white boy's\r\ncap than the fact that it was cut with a safety-razor blade. Although\r\nboth white and Negro boys commonly carry safety-razor blades to sharpen\r\ntheir pencils, she thought of razors only in connection with Negroes.\r\nShe also believed that \"Negro children of kindergarten age are unusually\r\ncruel,\" and that \"Negroes need a curriculum especially adapted to their\r\nemotional natures.\" Again she said that a Negro boy who asked to be put\r\nback from the third to the first grade, because the third-grade work was\r\ntoo hard for him, was typical of Negro children, who \"shut down on their\r\nintellectual processes when they are about twelve or fourteen years of\r\nage.\" In view of the numbers of Negro children in the higher grades who\r\nare advancing normally, this is obviously an unwarranted generalization.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FARREN SCHOOL\r\n   Located at Forty-eighth Street and Wabash Avenue, 92 per cent Negro\r\n   attendance.]\r\n\r\nThere were some signs of friction at a school 20 per cent Negro (Haven)\r\nwhen a school largely Italian was combined with it, but the situation\r\nwas handled tactfully by the principal and there had been no trouble.\r\nAt a school 85 per cent Negro (Doolittle), where the white element was\r\nJewish, all the teachers reported that there was no antagonism between\r\nthe races.\r\n\r\n_Voluntary grouping._--The only school where the investigator noticed\r\nNegro and white children playing in separate groups was Webster (30 per\r\ncent), whose principal reported antagonism between Negroes and whites.\r\nAt the other schools natural mingling was reported by some teachers or\r\nobserved by the investigator. At a school 26 per cent Negro (Oakland)\r\nthree teachers said that Negro and white children did not mingle on\r\nthe playgrounds, while another teacher said they all played together\r\nregardless of color. The principal and twelve teachers at a school 85\r\nper cent Negro (Doolittle) agreed, with the exception of one teacher\r\nwho was a southerner, that there was never anything but the most natural\r\nmingling in the classrooms, about the building and on the playground. At\r\na school 30 per cent Negro (Drake), the principal of which stated that\r\nthe relations between the races were not harmonious, the investigator\r\nobserved a free and natural grouping of Negroes and whites of all ages\r\non the playground. The principal explained that this was \"a forced rather\r\nthan a natural grouping because of lack of apparatus for all.\" The white\r\nchildren at a school 20 per cent Negro (Haven) were Italians, Jews, and\r\nGreeks, and all the races played so naturally together that passersby\r\nfrequently stopped to watch them.\r\n\r\n_Social contacts._--There are few social organizations and gatherings\r\nin the elementary schools. The principal of a school 93 per cent Negro\r\n(Raymond) said that there were clubs through all the grammar grades and\r\nthat the friendliness between the two races was marked, but added:\r\n\r\n     We have not more than fifty or sixty white children in this\r\n     particular building. One white child was elected vice-president,\r\n     the first white child elected in eight years. It shows the\r\n     friendly relationship when a white child could be elected\r\n     to office with a large preponderance of colored children. A\r\n     Jewish boy was elected to a smaller office of clerk. The white\r\n     children are not foreign. In their meetings the question of\r\n     color never arises at all.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances principals had found that graduation presented some\r\ndifficulties, as white mothers would appear at the school a few days\r\nbefore and request that their children do not march with Negro children.\r\n\"About the only time I see a white mother is near graduation,\" said the\r\nprincipal of a school 38 per cent Negro (Forrestville). \"They always\r\nsay they wouldn't care for themselves, but a friend might see and they\r\nwould feel ashamed.\" \"White children prefer not to march with colored\r\nat graduation,\" said a teacher at Oakland School (26 per cent), \"and\r\nmothers sometimes come to ask that it be so arranged that their girls\r\ncan march with white girls. They usually say that for themselves they\r\ndon't mind, but friends might see and wonder why that should be.\"\r\n\r\nA number of the schools have orchestras or occasional musical programs.\r\nThe investigator heard one orchestra of eleven pieces in Doolittle School\r\n(85 per cent), which played remarkably well. All but one of the children\r\nwere Negroes. A teacher in Webster School (30 per cent), where there\r\nwas reported to be constant friction between Negro and white children,\r\ngave an incident of a Negro boy in the school playing the violin with\r\na white accompanist and being enthusiastically applauded by the children.\r\n\r\nThe principal of a 92 per cent Negro school (Colman) reported an\r\nunpleasant experience when pupils from her school were invited to take\r\npart in a musical program at a West Side Park.\r\n\r\n     A group of sixty went with two white teachers in charge. On\r\n     the way over a group of foreign women called out insulting\r\n     remarks to the teachers, but no one paid any attention. After\r\n     the program the group started marching out of the park and\r\n     were met at the gate with a shower of stones. The teacher\r\n     told the children to run for their lives, and they all had\r\n     to scatter and hide in the bushes in the park or run toward\r\n     home if they could. A rough set of boys had got together and\r\n     were waiting for those children, stones all ready to throw.\r\n     Since that time we have never accepted an invitation to sing\r\n     outside our own neighborhood. Invitations have come from time\r\n     to time, but the children all come with excuses. All of them,\r\n     children and parents throughout the neighborhood, are afraid\r\n     but you can't get anyone to come out and say it.\r\n\r\n_Attitude of parents._--Principals and teachers were questioned about\r\ntheir relations with the parents of both Negro and white children--whether\r\nthey received co-operation from the parents in matters of discipline;\r\nwhat was the attitude of the parents toward Negro teachers; and whether\r\nmany requests were received from Negro or white parents for transfers\r\nto schools where there were fewer Negroes.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the principals who found Negro parents\r\nunco-operative, unambitious, and antagonistic were those who believed\r\nin separate schools, found Negro children difficult to discipline, and\r\nwould have no Negro teachers in their schools. Such principals declared\r\nthat Negro parents were \"10 to 1 in the complaints brought into the\r\noffice,\"[38] and that \"they fuss over everything and tell their children\r\nnot to take anything from a white child.\" They also cited cases of\r\ninsolence and threats which appeared to be exceptional rather than\r\ntypical.\r\n\r\nSome teachers said the reason they did not receive any co-operation\r\nfrom Negro mothers was because a large proportion of them were working.\r\nTardiness and absence were due mainly to this cause, according to one\r\nprincipal, though a teacher of a room for retarded children in another\r\nschool said there was little tardiness and practically no absence in\r\nher group. This teacher expressed the conviction, as did many others,\r\nthat Negro parents were appreciative of school advantages and eager\r\nto have their children learn. Principals who came in contact with both\r\nNegro and foreign parents found the Negro parents much more interested\r\nand ambitious than the foreigners. Even the principal of a school 30\r\nper cent Negro (Webster), who was somewhat prejudiced in her attitude\r\ntoward Negroes in the school, said she had more Negro than white boys\r\nable to go to work whose parents wished them to remain in school.\r\n\r\nNegro teachers were apparently acceptable to Negro parents, only one\r\nof the principals or teachers interviewed reporting objections by Negro\r\nparents. One teacher in a school 30 per cent Negro (Webster) said that\r\nNegro parents had their children transferred there from schools with\r\nmore Negroes, so that they would have white teachers. The district\r\nsuperintendent said he had had some difficulty in placing Negro teachers\r\nin Negro schools, which he attributed to the fact that Negro parents\r\nfelt that Negro teachers had not had the same opportunity for thorough\r\ntraining as white teachers. Some Negro parents, however, had indicated\r\nthat their attitude was not due to belief that Negro teachers were\r\ninadequately trained, but to fear that too general placing of Negro\r\nteachers over Negro pupils was a step toward segregation.\r\n\r\nThe principal of a school 90 per cent Negro (Keith) thought Negro mothers\r\npreferred Negro teachers because several had said to her that the \"colored\r\nteachers understand our children better.\"\r\n\r\nThe district superintendent in the area including most of the schools\r\nlargely attended by Negroes said that few requests for transfers were\r\nmade during the year, but he believed more were made at the request of\r\nNegro than of white parents. A number of these Negro children transferred\r\nnot to go to a school largely white but to a school 70 per cent Negro,\r\nbecause they said they were afraid to go to the school in their own\r\ndistrict which was across Wentworth Avenue. The race feeling between\r\ncertain groups in this district was very intense, according to the\r\nsuperintendent. It was especially violent between the Negro children\r\nand the Italians and between the Jews and the Bohemians. The principal\r\nof a school 93 per cent Negro (Raymond) also testified to the spirit of\r\nantagonism along Wentworth Avenue:\r\n\r\n     Wentworth Avenue is the gang line. They seem to feel that\r\n     trespass on either side of that line is ground for trouble.\r\n     While they will admit colored members to the school without\r\n     any trouble for manual training, they have to be escorted over\r\n     the line, because of trouble, not from members of the school,\r\n     but groups of boys outside the school. To illustrate: We took\r\n     a kindergarten group over to the park. One little six-year-old\r\n     girl was struck in the face by a man. The condition is a\r\n     tradition. There does not seem to be any malice in it. \"He is\r\n     from the east side,\" or \"Hit him, he is from the West Side,\"\r\n     are remarks frequently heard.\r\n\r\nTransfers from schools with a predominant Negro membership were reported\r\nby one or two principals and teachers in schools with a Negro minority,\r\nwho said that the Negro mothers objected to having their children in\r\nschools \"where there are so many common niggers.\" One of the principals\r\nsaid she had many requests from Negro mothers for transfers from the\r\nbranch of the school with 90 per cent Negroes to the main school with 20\r\nper cent. The Commission did not find in its inquiry among Negro mothers\r\nthat such an objection was prevalent, but that most of the transfers\r\nrequested were due to the reputation of the school for being overcrowded,\r\npoorly taught, and generally run down.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HIGH SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n_Classroom and building contacts._--In the high schools the ordinary\r\ncontacts in classes and about the building become subordinate to the\r\nmore difficult problems created by the increased number of social\r\nactivities--athletics, gymnasium exhibitions, clubs, and parties.\r\n\r\nThe dean of Englewood High School, which has only about 6 per cent Negro\r\nchildren, said that the white and Negro children mingled freely with\r\nno sign of trouble or prejudice but thought that if more Negro children\r\ncame to the school the spirit would change. A teacher in this same school\r\nwho had formerly been at Wendell Phillips, where the majority are Negro,\r\nsaid that a spirit of friendliness had grown up there between the two\r\nraces, and race distinction had disappeared.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WENDELL PHILLIPS HIGH SCHOOL\r\n   Located at Thirty-ninth Street and Prairie Avenue, 52 per cent Negro\r\n   attendance.]\r\n\r\nThere was only one Negro teacher in the high schools of Chicago at\r\nthe time of this investigation, the teacher of manual training at\r\nWendell Phillips. He is a graduate of the University of Illinois and\r\nhad substituted around Chicago for several years. Although they spoke\r\nvery highly of him, none of the principals of three high schools with\r\nsmall Negro percentages and in which there were vacancies could use him.\r\nThe principal of Wendell Phillips, with a large proportion of Negroes,\r\ntold, however, of a different experience when this teacher was at that\r\nschool. \"In answer to complaints by pupils I told them that this man was\r\na graduate of the University of Illinois, a high-school graduate in the\r\ncity, and a cultured man. 'Go in there and forget the color, and see if\r\nyou can get the subject matter.' In the majority of cases it worked.\"\r\n\r\nRacial friction about the buildings and grounds was not reported by any\r\nof the high-school principals. \"I have not known of a fight between a\r\ncolored and a white boy in fifteen years,\" said the principal of Hyde\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nTwo principals said that the Negro children voluntarily grouped themselves\r\nat noon, either eating at tables by themselves in the lunchroom or\r\nbringing their own lunches and eating in the back part of the assembly\r\nhall. The gymnasium instructor at Wendell Phillips said that she had\r\nno difficulty in her work if she let the children arrange themselves.\r\nThe gymnasium instructor at a school with a small proportion of Negroes\r\nsaid that the white girls had objected to going into the swimming-pool\r\nwith Negro girls, but that she had gone in with the Negro girls, which\r\nhad helped to remove the prejudice.\r\n\r\n_Athletic teams._--In the field of athletics there seems to be no\r\nfeeling between the white and Negro members of a school team, but the\r\nNegro members are sometimes roughly handled when the team plays other\r\nschools. \"The basketball team is half and half,\" said the principal of\r\nWendell Phillips. He reported some friction in previous years but said\r\nthat \"this year it is not shown at all.\" \"They played a strenuous game\r\nwith Englewood last week. A colored boy was roughly treated by the other\r\nteam. Our white boys were ready to fight the whole Englewood team.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal of Hyde Park High School also said that there was no\r\nfeeling in his school against Negro members of athletic teams, and that\r\nhe did not know of a single instance in which a Negro boy was kept off\r\nan athletic team if he was the best for the place.\r\n\r\nTwo Seniors in a high school mainly white (Tilden) thus described the\r\nway they handled the Negro members of a visiting basket-ball team:\r\n\r\n     On the way over here fellows on the outside bawled them out,\r\n     but our fellows sure got them on the way home. There were three\r\n     black fellows on the team and those three got just about laid\r\n     out. Our team wouldn't play them, so there was a great old\r\n     row. Then, when they went home some of our boys were waiting\r\n     for them to come out of the building to give them a chase. The\r\n     coons were afraid to come out, so policemen had to be called\r\n     to take them to the car line. The white fellows weren't hurt\r\n     any, but the coons got some bricks.\r\n\r\n_Transfers between high schools._--Requests for transfers from Wendell\r\nPhillips to Englewood and Hyde Park schools had been made by both white\r\nand Negro children, according to the principals of the latter schools. The\r\npermits of the Negro children had frequently been revoked after they had\r\nbeen admitted to classes, and the children returned to Wendell Phillips.\r\nA teacher at Wendell Phillips pointed out the injustice of transferring a\r\nchild in the middle of a term. After a child has been admitted to classes\r\nhe should be permitted to remain through the semester, she believed, for\r\notherwise a full term's work was lost because the courses in the schools\r\nwere different. \"All this transferring is nonsense, anyway,\" she said.\r\n\"Children should be made to go to school in the district where they live\r\nand that would end the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThis teacher told of an incident at Tilden School when a group of Negro\r\nboys registered for entrance:\r\n\r\n     About sixty colored boys entered Tilden High School either\r\n     for the regular high-school course or prevocational work and\r\n     were thrown out by the Tilden boys. They made it so hot for\r\n     the colored boys that the sixty had to withdraw. Some came\r\n     back here; others dropped out of school entirely. It's pretty\r\n     bad when one set of boys can put out another set and nothing\r\n     is done to punish one and call back the other group.\r\n\r\nTwo boys at Tilden who took part in this affair gave this version of\r\nthe incident:\r\n\r\n     About thirty colored boys registered at Tilden last fall, but\r\n     we cleaned up on them the first couple of days and they never\r\n     showed up again. We didn't give them any peace in the locker\r\n     room, basement, at noon hours, or between classes--told them\r\n     to keep out of our way or we'd see they got out. The fellows\r\n     who were in school before we didn't tackle--they know where\r\n     they belong. There's one colored fellow in our class everybody\r\n     likes. He's a smart nice fellow to talk to, and he doesn't\r\n     stick around when you don't want him. He didn't say anything\r\n     when we made the new coons step around, but I guess he didn't\r\n     like it very well.\r\n\r\nIt was this same group of boys who objected to playing a visiting\r\nbasketball team with three Negroes on it and \"just about laid them out.\"\r\n\r\n_Social activities in high schools._--In high schools, with their older\r\npupils, there is an increased race consciousness, and in the purely\r\nsocial activities such as clubs and dances, which are part of high-school\r\nlife, there is none of the general mingling often found in semi-social\r\nactivities such as singing and literary societies. Although Negro pupils\r\ndo not share in the purely social activities, they do not organize such\r\nactivities among themselves.\r\n\r\n\"The colored never come to social affairs,\" said the dean of one school.\r\n\"They are so much in the minority here that they leave all organizations\r\nto the whites.\" The principal of this school told of having seen two\r\ncolored girls at a class party who danced together for a while and\r\nleft. \"It is the only time I've seen the two races at the same social\r\ngathering.\"\r\n\r\nThe dean of Englewood said: \"We have colored children in singing clubs,\r\nin the orchestra, in literary societies, in class organizations, and on\r\nathletic teams. Always when there is a class party there will be five\r\nor six colored children. They will always dance together, but they are\r\npresent and welcomed by the white. Between dances it is not uncommon to\r\nsee white and colored talking.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident showing lack of feeling against individuals of special\r\nachievement was given by the principal of this last school:\r\n\r\n     Several years ago we organized a voluntary orchestra which met\r\n     after school. The director accepted all applications, among\r\n     them a number of colored boys. The white boys balked; it should\r\n     be white membership or they would leave. As it was near the\r\n     end of the year the orchestra was dissolved. The next year I\r\n     suggested to the teacher that he fill the orchestra places by\r\n     a general tryout, so understood, but really with the policy\r\n     of excluding the colored. This was done and a white orchestra\r\n     organized. Shortly, the father of H. F., a colored boy who had\r\n     been excluded, protested in my office, saying that his boy\r\n     had been excluded because of race prejudice and that he was\r\n     going to carry his protest to the Board of Education, for he\r\n     knew his boy played better than any boy in school. I admitted\r\n     that it was a choice in the school of white orchestra or no\r\n     orchestra, but that if his boy was the fine musician he said\r\n     he was I would gladly see what could be done. Soon after that\r\n     H. appeared on a school program and played with remarkable\r\n     skill and technique. He was applauded enthusiastically and\r\n     recalled three times. Straightway the orchestra members asked\r\n     him to play with them. He became unusually popular throughout\r\n     the school. His standing was the highest and he was awarded a\r\n     scholarship of $100 allowed by the Board of Education for the\r\n     best student. He was also chosen to represent the school on\r\n     the Northwestern University scholarship, and in his Freshman\r\n     year he won another scholarship for the next year. The death\r\n     of his parents made it necessary for him to leave college to\r\n     support his brothers and sisters. At this time he was stricken\r\n     with infantile paralysis. The interest on Liberty bonds taken\r\n     out by the high school is paid in to H., and when the colored\r\n     people gave a benefit for him the pupils sold 500 tickets. He\r\n     is improving and teaching violin to thirty pupils at present.\r\n     His sister is in the school now on a scholarship and is doing\r\n     remarkably well also.\r\n\r\nAt Wendell Phillips the situation was quite different, for there were no\r\nschool or class social affairs which were general. There were invitational\r\naffairs to which the Negroes were not invited. All the clubs in the\r\nschool were white, Negroes being excluded. The principal said he would\r\nnot insist on mixed clubs until he saw the parents of the children mixing\r\nsocially. The glee club was an especially difficult problem because of\r\nits semi-public as well as social character. The Negro children maintained\r\nthat a glee club composed entirely of whites was not representative of a\r\nschool in which the majority were Negroes. The Negroes had not responded\r\nto the suggestion of the principal that they form a glee club of their\r\nown, and as the white children would not be in a glee club with Negro\r\nchildren, there was constant friction over this club.\r\n\r\nOther principals expressed the conviction that the racial problem\r\nof school social affairs could not be solved until the prejudice and\r\nantagonism of adults had disappeared. One principal said he had had to\r\ncall off an arrangement for a class affair because the hotel would not\r\naccommodate the Negroes. Another principal thought that the schools\r\nwould not wait to follow the lead of the parents in forgetting the race\r\nprejudice but would themselves be the greatest factor in destroying it.\r\n\r\n_Relations with parents._--In most cases the high schools were receiving\r\nsplendid support from Negro parents in matters of discipline. \"I have\r\nnever had a case where the parent did not back up the teacher in the\r\ntreatment given to a colored child,\" said one principal, speaking of\r\ncases where children had got into difficulty when they complained that\r\nthe teacher had \"picked on them\" because they were Negroes. The parents\r\nalways made the child withdraw the statement and admit that the trouble\r\nwas not due to color at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nReports were received from three technical high schools, Lane, Tilden,\r\nand Lucy H. Flower. Lane and Tilden had few Negro students, while in\r\nLucy H. Flower the Negroes were about 20 per cent. The principals of\r\nLane and Tilden said they were not conscious of any racial difference in\r\ntheir pupils, that no special methods of instruction were necessary for\r\nthe Negro children, that there were no quarrels with a racial background\r\nin the schools, and no voluntary or compulsory groupings of white and\r\nNegro. The principal of Lucy H. Flower found racial differences between\r\nthe Negroes and whites which she believed created special problems of\r\neducation and discipline. The children got along together very well in\r\nschool, and whatever quarrels there were, the principal thought were due\r\nto personal dislikes rather than to race prejudice. The colored girls\r\ngrouped themselves voluntarily at noon and at dismissal time, and the\r\nwhite girls did the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. RETARDATION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. RETARDATION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the Board of Education a selection was made\r\nof three groups of schools to be studied for comparative retardation.\r\nThe group comprised six schools having the largest percentage of Negro\r\nchildren, six attended mainly by whites in neighborhoods where the family\r\nincome might be comparable, and twelve attended mainly by children of\r\nimmigrants. Table XII gives the number and percentage of accelerated,\r\nnormal, and retarded children for each school, for each group, and for\r\nthe whole group of twenty-four schools.\r\n\r\nThis table shows the much greater amount of retardation among schools\r\nattended by Negroes than in schools attended by white Americans or by\r\nchildren of immigrants. The percentage for the group attended by Negroes\r\nis 74, while for the different schools in the group it varies from 67\r\nto 81. For the two groups of schools attended by white Americans the\r\npercentage of retardation is the same, 49, though there is greater\r\nvariation among these schools than among the schools attended by Negroes.\r\nIn the group attended by children of immigrants, for instance, only 32\r\nper cent are retarded in the Jungman (Bohemian) School, while 71 per\r\ncent are retarded in the Holden (Polish) School. A similar discrepancy\r\nappears in the group attended by white Americans, where the figure is 40\r\nper cent for the Armstrong School and 62 per cent for the Byford School.\r\n\r\n

twenty-four schools studied\r\nare close to those for the city at large, 53 per cent retarded in the\r\nspecial group and 51 per cent for the city at large. In the accelerated\r\ngroup the percentage of accelerated Negro children, 11, is smaller than\r\nthe percentage of accelerated white children, 17, or the percentage of\r\naccelerated foreign children, 19. This variation is not so striking as\r\nthat in the normal group where only 15 per cent of the Negro children\r\nappear to make normal progress as compared with 34 per cent of the white\r\nchildren and 32 per cent of the foreign children. From this it would\r\nappear that there are factors in the lives of many Negro children which\r\nprevent them from making normal progress.\r\n\r\nThe degree of retardation, as shown in Table XIII is again quite different\r\nfor the white and Negro groups.\r\n\r\nThe largest single groups of backward white American and foreign children\r\nare retarded less than one year (42 per cent of the white American and\r\n39 per cent of the foreign group), and the numbers decrease rapidly\r\nas the degree of retardation increases. In the case of the Negroes 19\r\nper cent are retarded less than one year. The decrease as the degree\r\nof retardation increases is slower than in the white groups, and many\r\nmore children are retarded two, three, four, five years and more. In\r\nthe white American group only one child out of 3,439 retarded children\r\nis retarded five and one-half to six years, while there are forty-one\r\nin the corresponding Negro group out of a total of 4,412. One white\r\nchild is retarded six and one-half to seven years, while seventeen Negro\r\nchildren are retarded this amount; twelve foreign children out of 10,379\r\nretarded children are retarded six to ten years, and thirty-seven Negro\r\nchildren are found in these groups.\r\n\r\nThough the main reasons for the high degree of retardation among Negro\r\nchildren are set forth in the next section under \"Causes of Retardation,\"\r\na partial explanation is to be found in the fact that Negro parents\r\nare frequently more interested in keeping their over-age children in\r\nschool than white parents, especially foreign parents, whose anxiety to\r\nhave their children leave school as soon as they are old enough to get\r\nwork-permits is well known.\r\n\r\n_Causes of retardation._--It is generally understood of course that\r\ncomparisons of Negro with white children are hardly fair, since Negro\r\nchildren have not had the same opportunities as whites to make normal\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nA study was made of the reasons why children were retarded in the\r\ngroups of schools attended mainly by Negroes, by white Americans, and by\r\nchildren of immigrants. Records were obtained at the schools for 1,469\r\nNegro children and 1,560 white children who were listed according to\r\nthe Board of Education's classification for retarded children.\r\n\r\nTable XIV shows clearly that the predominating cause of retardation among\r\nNegroes is late entrance, which, according to the board's classification,\r\nmeans that they did not enter school until more than six years of age.\r\nThis is generally explained by the fact that the family came from the\r\nSouth, where there was no school near enough for the child to attend, or\r\nthe school was overcrowded, or the family was uneducated and indifferent.\r\nIn some cases the parents have come North, leaving the child with\r\ngrandparents who made no effort to see that it went to school.\r\n\r\n

---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe next most important cause of retardation among the Negroes is family\r\ndifficulties. The fathers are often kept away from home weeks at a\r\ntime by their work. A large number of the mothers are working, and the\r\nparents' lack of education is frequently the cause of a home life that\r\nis below standard, physically and morally.\r\n\r\nAmong the whites, late entrance, inability to speak the language,\r\nill health, backwardness, and low mentality are the main causes of\r\nretardation. While it is often maintained that the Negro is the mental\r\ninferior of the white, these figures do not bear out that contention.\r\nAlso the retardation figures do not show the home life of the Negroes\r\nto be productive of as much ill health as is the case with the whites.\r\n\r\nApproximately the same number of Negro and white children were retarded\r\nbecause of irregular attendance.\r\n\r\nIn addition there were forty-two Negro children and 155 white children\r\nwho were classified under two, three, or four different causes for\r\nretardation. Children who were late entering also had some physical\r\ndifficulty, or children who were retarded because of family difficulties\r\nwere also of poor mental endowment. In some cases such double\r\nclassification represented a realization by the teacher that retardation\r\nis a complicated and delicate thing which cannot be explained by one\r\nhard-and-fast reason. Others, finding it difficult to decide whether\r\nchildren were backward, of low mentality, or feeble-minded, classified\r\nthem under all three causes. In two instances Negroes were found to be\r\nretarded because they were late entering and \"foreign\"--that is, they\r\nwere handicapped by an \"initial lack of the English language.\"\r\n\r\n_Intensive study of 116 retarded Negro children._--The presence of\r\nretarded Negro children in the Chicago public schools within recent\r\nyears has been regarded by many teachers and principals as a problem of\r\nNegro education. Some assume that this retardation is due to an inherent\r\nincapacity for normal grade work. Inquiries of the Commission early\r\ndisclosed the fact that although the retardation rate of Negro children\r\nwas higher than that of white, the great majority of the retarded Negroes\r\nwere from southern states, and that Negro children born in the North had,\r\nas a rule, no higher rate of retardation than the whites. In the belief\r\nthat the causes of retardation among Negro children could be found in\r\nthe same factors of social background and environment which operates to\r\nretard white children, an intensive study was made of 116 Negro children\r\ntaken at random from among all the retarded Negro children in several\r\nschools to learn what elements in their former life and present home\r\nenvironment might explain their retardation.\r\n\r\nOut of the 116 children 101 had been in school before coming to Chicago.\r\nOf these eighty-six had lived in the South and attended southern schools.\r\nSince this group was chosen at random, the large proportion from the\r\nSouth tends to bear out the statements of school principals and teachers\r\nthat Negro children from the South constitute the bulk of retarded\r\nchildren. Previous school records were obtained for eighty-four of these\r\neighty-six southern children, and in sixty-four cases the children were\r\nretarded when they came to Chicago. Many of them were retarded two and\r\nthree years, and some three, four, five, and even six years. Forty-seven\r\nof the sixty-four were retarded more than one year. In a number of cases\r\nchildren who were in the normal grade for their age in the South were\r\nput back one or two grades when they entered Chicago schools because\r\nthey were not equipped to do the work of this grade in the North.\r\n\r\nThe states from which these children came are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,\r\nGeorgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Twenty-three of the eighty-six children\r\nwho had lived in the South were from Mississippi--the largest group\r\nfrom any one state--and of these three were up with their normal grade,\r\neleven were retarded three or four years, one was retarded six years, and\r\none who was in the normal grade in the South was demoted two years. One\r\nreason for the poor record of these Mississippi children is undoubtedly\r\nto be found in that state's inadequate compulsory-education law which\r\nprovides a school term of eighty days in districts which do not reject\r\nthe law. Eight of the Mississippi children lived on plantations which\r\nwere so far from school that regular attendance was impossible.\r\n\r\nInformation gathered concerning the parents of these 116 retarded children\r\nshowed that in eighty-six cases the father was living with his family.\r\nIn six cases the father was dead, in one case he was insane, in fifteen\r\ncases he had separated from or deserted the mother, and in eight cases\r\nthere was no report on the father.\r\n\r\nThe mother was found to be living with her family in 112 cases. In two\r\ncases the mother was dead, and in two cases she had deserted father and\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAll of the eighty-six fathers who lived at home were working, though\r\none was reported as working irregularly, and two as having deserted\r\ntheir wives occasionally for periods of several weeks. In two of the\r\ncases where the father had separated from the mother he was reported as\r\ncontributing to the support of the child.\r\n\r\nIn forty out of the eighty-six cases where the father was living at home\r\nand working, the mother was also working, and in the fifteen separation\r\ncases where the mother was supporting the child, she was working. The\r\nfact that a total of fifty-five out of 112 mothers, or 49 per cent,\r\nwere working is undoubtedly a large factor in the retardation of the\r\nchildren. The statement was frequently made by teachers that 40 or 50\r\nper cent of the Negro mothers worked, and that the child was therefore\r\nneglected, and the teacher could get no co-operation from the mother,\r\nas she was never free to come to school to talk over matters affecting\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nSome teachers felt that many mothers worked where there was no economic\r\nnecessity, as the father was earning enough to support the family.\r\nIt should be noted in this connection that at the time this material\r\nwas gathered there were more opportunities for work than there were\r\nmen to fill them. Under ordinary conditions there would doubtless be\r\na certain amount of unemployment in these Negro families which would\r\ncause more mothers to work from economic necessity. Many of the families\r\ninvestigated, where both parents were working, were reported as getting\r\non very well, though there were some cases of real poverty. In a number\r\nof instances the families could not seem to make ends meet on a good\r\nincome because they were ignorant and did not know how to spend their\r\nmoney, or because they had not been able to adjust themselves to city\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOf the eighty-six fathers who were working, few were in skilled\r\noccupations which would command a substantial wage. Most of the mothers\r\nwere engaged in work that took them away from home. A few did sewing,\r\nhairdressing, and laundry work in their homes, but the large majority\r\nwent out to work. Work carried on in the home frequently has as bad an\r\neffect on the child's school attendance as the mother's absence, for the\r\nchild is sometimes kept at home to help and often finds the work more\r\ninteresting than school.\r\n\r\nThe following occupations of mothers of retarded children were noted:\r\n\r\n     Day work              22\r\n     Stock Yards           12\r\n     Hairdresser            4\r\n     Laundry                4\r\n     Maid                   4\r\n     Barrel factory         3\r\n     Seamstress             3\r\n     Domestic service       2\r\n     Box factory            1\r\n     Car cleaner            1\r\n     Cleaning (hospital)    1\r\n     Dishwasher             1\r\n     Elevator               1\r\n     Foundry                1\r\n     Housekeeper            1\r\n     Lamp-shade factory     1\r\n     Waist factory          1\r\n\r\n_Education of parents._--Of the eighty-six fathers, thirty-one were\r\nilliterate, and forty-eight had gone to elementary school but had\r\ncompleted only the second, fourth, or sixth grade. Five of the fathers\r\nhad gone to high school, and two were college graduates.\r\n\r\nThe figures are slightly better for the mothers. Out of 112, twenty-one\r\nwere totally illiterate, seventy-six had gone to elementary school,\r\nten had been in high school or college, and five were not reported on.\r\nEighty-eight per cent of the mothers, therefore, and 91 per cent of the\r\nfathers had less than a high-school education. Though there were many\r\nilliterate or poorly educated parents who were eager for their children\r\nto have advantages which they never had themselves, others, as in any\r\nilliterate group, no matter what the color, failed to appreciate the\r\nimportance of school.\r\n\r\n_Home discipline._--A number of teachers reported that they were unable\r\nto discipline the children in school because they were undisciplined at\r\nhome. In seventy-three of the 116 homes there was found to be discipline,\r\nin twenty-two a lack of discipline, and twenty were not reported on.\r\nDiscipline seemed to be the responsibility of the mother in the large\r\nmajority of cases, and many of the twenty-two undisciplined children\r\nwere boys who were beyond the control of the mother. In every case but\r\nfour where there was no discipline the mother was working, so that the\r\nchild did not receive much care during the daytime and the mother was\r\ntoo tired to bother about discipline at night. Lack of discipline can\r\nalso be traced to the fact that the child has not always lived with the\r\nparents but with relatives who have been lax in the matter of discipline.\r\n\r\n_Home care._--The physical condition of the home, the preparation and\r\nsubstance of the meals, may be expected to affect a child's health and\r\ntherefore his attendance at school. The homes of eighty-four children\r\nwere reported to be clean and twenty-five not clean, while seven were\r\nnot reported on. In twenty-one cases out of the twenty-five reported not\r\nclean, the mother was working. In forty-seven cases out of the eighty-four\r\nreported clean the mother was working. In many of the forty-seven cases\r\nthere was an aunt or grandmother who took care of the house.\r\n\r\nIn many homes the ignorance of the parents was obviously responsible for\r\nfailure to provide the kind of food adapted to the needs of the children.\r\nA great deal of fresh meat, usually pork and bacon, potatoes, rice, and\r\ncoffee were the staples, while green vegetable, fruits, cereals, and\r\nmilk were noticeably lacking. Also, when the mother is away all day the\r\nfood is hastily prepared, which usually means that it is fried. The girl\r\nwho gets home from school before her mother has finished her day's work\r\nusually starts the dinner, or brings something from the delicatessen.\r\nMany children are given twenty-five cents with which to buy lunch, and\r\nin three extreme cases the children were given money to buy all their\r\nmeals, with no supervision over what they ate.\r\n\r\n_Difficulty of adjustment._--When all the causes contributing to\r\nretardation were taken into consideration in the histories of the\r\n116 retarded children studied, it was still obvious that the greatest\r\nstumbling-block to normal progress was previous residence in the South.\r\nThe retardation of children from the South is explained in a variety of\r\nways.\r\n\r\nSome of the children from the South did not get along well because\r\nthey had not been able to adjust themselves to city life. They had been\r\naccustomed to the freedom and outdoor life of the farm and did not like\r\nthe confined life of the city. They felt timid and shy in the midst of\r\nso many people, as they did not come much in contact with people when\r\nthey lived on southern farms four or five miles from the nearest town.\r\nMost of these children had never gone to school for more than a few\r\nmonths at a time, either because the school term was short or they lived\r\ntoo far from the school to attend regularly. Consequently some of them\r\nfound the nine months' term irksome.\r\n\r\n_Demotion._--A number of children were found to be over-aged for their\r\ngrades because they had been demoted one or two years when they came to\r\nChicago. Some of these had gone to school regularly in the South and were\r\nof normal age for their grades, but the school term was so short that\r\nit was impossible for them to complete the same amount of work in the\r\nsame number of years as children in northern schools. Children who were\r\nin the fifth or fourth grade in the South had been put back to the third\r\nor second grade on entering Chicago schools. This sometimes discouraged\r\nthem so much that they dropped out of school on reaching fourteen, the\r\nage limit of the compulsory-education law.\r\n\r\n_Inadequate schools._--Overcrowded and poorly taught schools also are\r\nresponsible for the retardation of southern Negro children. One girl\r\nattended a school which was in session only three months a year and\r\nwhere there were 100 to 125 children under one teacher. Consequently\r\nthis girl was retarded four years. A boy who, when he came to Chicago,\r\nwas fifteen years old and six years behind his grade had always lived\r\nin small country towns in the South. In one of these his teacher was\r\nthe iceman. \"He didn't come to school until he was through totin' ice\r\naround,\" said the boy. \"Then if anyone wanted ice they comed after him.\r\nHe wasn't learning me anything so I quit.\" This boy was found to be\r\nambitious and was attending school regularly in Chicago in spite of the\r\nfact that he was conspicuously over-age for his grade.\r\n\r\n_Other causes of retardation._--Some over-age children are extremely\r\nsensitive about their size and are irregular at school on this account.\r\nA fifteen-year-old boy who was 5 feet 8 inches tall was in the fifth\r\ngrade. He refused to go to school because he was larger than anyone in\r\nhis class. At one time he was so ashamed of being seen in the room with\r\nsmaller children that he would go out of the classroom every time a girl\r\npassed the door.\r\n\r\nAs in many white families where the importance of regular school\r\nattendance is not fully understood, work at home or work after school\r\nhours is sometimes permitted to interfere materially with school\r\nattendance. Older children are kept at home to look after young children\r\nwhile the parents are away at work and sometimes when the mother is home.\r\nA fourteen-year-old girl who was three years retarded had always been\r\nkept out of school to do housework. The five younger children were all\r\nin the normal grades for their ages but the fourteen-year-old girl had\r\nbeen out of school so much she had lost interest. Other children were\r\nworking after school hours selling papers and delivering packages and\r\nwanted to leave school as soon as possible so that they could work all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the teacher seemed in a few instances to be responsible\r\nfor the child's lack of interest. In one case the teacher threw a paper\r\nat a boy instead of handing it to him, and the boy had refused to recite\r\nto her ever since. He went to school but recited to his mother at home.\r\nAnother boy had been kept back in school by a misunderstanding between\r\nhis mother and the principal. The principal took the boy home with her\r\nto do some work around her house and kept him until nine o'clock. The\r\nmother became so worried she had the police out looking for him. When\r\nshe found out the cause of his lateness coming home, she went to the\r\nschool and threatened the principal. The principal afterward refused\r\neither to promote the boy or transfer him to another school.\r\n\r\n_Recreation._--A study of the favorite forms of recreation among 116\r\nchildren, aside from the few who reported that they had no time to play,\r\nshowed the movies to be in the lead. Children economized on lunch, buying\r\npotato salad and pickles, in order to have enough left from their lunch\r\nmoney to go to the movies. One boy who worked outside of school hours\r\nmade $3 to $5 a week and spent most of it on the movies; he went three\r\nor four times a day if he had the money. A few children played truant\r\nin order to go to the movies.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE XV\r\n\r\n     FAVORITE RECREATION OF 116 RETARDED NEGRO CHILDREN\r\n\r\n     Movies                       85\r\n     Baseball                     32\r\n     Reading                      31\r\n     Marbles                      29\r\n     Skating                      20\r\n     Jumping rope                 11\r\n     Music                         6\r\n     Jacks                         6\r\n     Vaudeville                    5\r\n     Running games                 4\r\n     Singing games                 4\r\n     Sewing                        3\r\n     Basket-ball                   2\r\n     Target practice               1\r\n     Pool                          1\r\n     Mechanical toys               1\r\n     Drawing                       1\r\n     Dolls                         1\r\n     Bicycle                       1\r\n     Typewriting                   1\r\n     Swinging                      1\r\n     Rolling hoop                  1\r\n     Card games, checkers, etc.    1\r\n                                 ---\r\n            Total                248\r\n\r\nMost of these children had two and even three forms of recreation, and the\r\nsecond was usually some form of outdoor recreation--baseball, marbles, or\r\njumping rope. Most of the younger ones went to the playgrounds, except\r\nthose who had housework to do or the few who did not care to associate\r\nwith other children.\r\n\r\nA reference to the section on \"Recreation\" will show that Negro children\r\nare limited in their recreational activities by lack of recreation centers\r\nwhere they are welcome. There are playgrounds for the younger children\r\nin the areas of Negro residence, but no recreation centers with their\r\nvaried indoor facilities for the older children.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. OPINIONS ON SCHOLARSHIP OF NEGRO CHILDREN\r\n\r\n_Progress of the southern Negro._--The retarded Negro child, usually\r\nfrom the South, who is conspicuous in the elementary schools, has been\r\nreferred to in the section on \"Retardation in Elementary Schools.\" In\r\nsome schools such children are put in the regular grades, where they\r\nreceive no special attention and can progress only one year at a time,\r\nthough most teachers agree that retardation is due to lack of educational\r\nopportunity rather than to inability to learn. In other schools there\r\nare special rooms for these children where they are advanced through\r\nseveral grades as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nDoolittle School (85 per cent) had six first-grade rooms for such\r\nchildren. In one of these rooms there were about twenty-five children\r\nfrom twelve to seventeen years of age doing all the lower-grade work\r\nup to the sixth. The teacher said that many of these children who were\r\nunable to read or write when they came from the South showed remarkable\r\nprogress in a few months, and in less than a year were able to do fourth-,\r\nfifth-, and sixth-grade work.\r\n\r\n\"One big girl of thirteen, when she arrived from the South,\" this teacher\r\nsaid, \"pretended to read with her book upside down, but in a little more\r\nthan a year she was doing sixth-grade work. One twelve-year-old boy from\r\nthe South, unable to read the primer or write his name, after about nine\r\nmonths of applied work just ate up everything I gave him and during the\r\nfollowing year read sixty library books.\"\r\n\r\nA thirteen-year-old girl, just five days in the school, had come from\r\nAlabama, where she had never attended school. \"There wasn't room for\r\nme,\" she explained. She read for the investigator on the tenth page of\r\nthe primer, haltingly but with understanding. The teacher was confident\r\nthat she could put her through several grades next year. She said further:\r\n\r\n     These children who have been deprived in the South of their\r\n     rights educationally are very eager. At first they are timid,\r\n     but they learn very quickly. They're as smart as whips if\r\n     they'd just get down to business. Without question this is\r\n     the kind of attention all the colored children from the South\r\n     need when they enter school in the North. The plan has been\r\n     successful and should be adopted throughout the school system.\r\n     One appreciates by comparison the injustice of putting the\r\n     fifteen-year-old newcomer from the South into second grade,\r\n     requiring of him only second-grade work over the nine months'\r\n     period.\r\n\r\nAnother school, 92 per cent Negro (Farren), has a special room for\r\nchildren from the South. \"Our dull children are almost without exception\r\nthose from the South who have never been to school,\" said the teacher.\r\n\"Those children should not be classed as dull, either, for they learn\r\nremarkably fast and often catch up to grade.\"\r\n\r\nA teacher of the ungraded room in a school 38 per cent Negro\r\n(Forrestville) said:\r\n\r\n     Practically all of the colored children are from the South,\r\n     where they have not been in school. Once they get started they\r\n     learn very rapidly and often catch up to the proper grade if\r\n     they are not too old when they start school. The older children\r\n     in this room have good power of concentration and consequently\r\n     learn much in a short time. Take, for example, a boy twelve\r\n     years old who came here not two months ago from the South. When\r\n     he came he had no idea how to write his name. A few days ago\r\n     he wrote for me a fourth-grade eight-line memory passage with\r\n     but three mistakes in spelling. Now I call that remarkable.\r\n     I have taught in this school all my teaching years, and they\r\n     have been many, and have never seen any child equal this,\r\n     either white or black.\r\n\r\n_Capacity for advanced work._--Teachers in the seventh and eighth grades\r\nusually found Negro children equal to the work, though in some cases they\r\nfelt that these children had been pushed out of the lower grade because\r\nof crowded conditions before they were ready for the more advanced work.\r\nAn eighth-grade teacher gave the following statement:\r\n\r\n     When children get this far they have a good foundation and do\r\n     their work very well. One of my colored girls is the brightest\r\n     child in school--arithmetic is hard for her but she works at\r\n     it. One of my colored boys is seventeen years old. He came\r\n     here from the South last fall to live with an uncle and to\r\n     get to a better school. His father wants him to be a doctor\r\n     and thought he wasn't getting along as well in the South as\r\n     he would in the North. When the boy came to me he said he\r\n     had been going to a college[40] in the South. I took him into\r\n     the eighth grade but saw he didn't have the fundamentals. On\r\n     close questioning he told me he had been in the seventh grade\r\n     in that college. Now he is doing excellent work for me. He\r\n     has much broader interests than the other children. He reads,\r\n     reads, reads, all the time and is well informed.\r\n\r\nOther teachers believed that there was nothing to keep the Negro children\r\nfrom making equal progress with the white, given similar opportunities.\r\n\"The progress of the colored children in Drake school (30 per cent)\r\ncannot be compared with that of the white,\" said an upper-grade teacher,\r\n\"because the colored are all from the South and have had the poorest\r\nopportunities. But comparing a Negro child and a white child who have\r\nhad the same advantages in school and equal opportunities for observation\r\nand example in the home, the Negro makes the same progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that under the same conditions a Negro child will do as well every\r\ntime as a white,\" said the teacher of an ungraded room in a school 38\r\nper cent Negro (Forrestville). \"Many do as well as the white and live\r\nin very poor neglected homes. I think every person who is not prejudiced\r\nmust admit that the colored do fully as well in school as the white.\"\r\n\r\nAn upper-grade teacher in the Felsenthal School (20 per cent) held a\r\nsimilar point of view: \"The colored are making wonderful strides. They\r\nadvance just as rapidly as the white, given equal opportunities. But their\r\nbackground is so slight and so short in years that one cannot fairly\r\ncompare them. The southern colored child must be studied individually\r\nto get his point of view in the school or he gets nowhere in his work.\"\r\n\r\n_High-school work._--The principal of Wendell Phillips High School\r\nprepared tables showing the numbers of white and Negro children dropping\r\nout at the end of each school year. They show that the largest number\r\nof Negro children dropped out during the first year, and the largest\r\nnumber of white children during the first and second years, the number\r\nof drop-outs being the same for both years. Some children repeat the\r\nwork so that all of them do not leave school.\r\n\r\nOne or two teachers in other schools stated concerning Negro children\r\nthat a \"very limited number go beyond the first year.\" \"They cannot\r\ngrasp the subject,\" said an English teacher; \"they do not understand as\r\nthe white child does. They lack the mentality.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same school the Latin teacher held quite the opposite opinion.\r\n\"The colored children are in every way equal to the white children.\r\nThey are just as well equipped mentally and make similar progress. My\r\nbest student at present is a colored girl. Her choice of English and her\r\nvocabulary and construction are far ahead of that of any white student.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral teachers and principals testified to the brilliancy of individual\r\nNegro students who not infrequently had the highest standing in the\r\nschool. The principal of an elementary school (Crerar) who had formerly\r\nhad experience in a school largely Negro felt that the junior high school\r\nwould meet the needs of the Negro children to a large degree:\r\n\r\n     More of them than the immigrant enter high school but do\r\n     not stay to finish. I suppose the parents insist upon some\r\n     high-school training, but it is necessary for the child to go\r\n     to work before he finishes. Another reason for the dropping out\r\n     might be the teachers' lack of interest in the child. In the\r\n     high school you don't find the teachers taking a keen interest\r\n     in every individual child as you do in the grades, and just\r\n     what colored children need is a keen interest in them. They\r\n     do better work.\r\n\r\n_Academic v. other courses._--A preference of Negro children for academic\r\nwork was reported by principals and teachers at two high schools. This\r\nmay be due in part to the fact, testified to by many teachers, that Negro\r\nchildren excel in languages and music and find mathematics and sciences\r\ndifficult. The usual implication was, however, that Negro children took\r\nacademic work because they thought it gave them better social standing.\r\nA principal who said that \"Negroes want to know nothing about industrial\r\ntraining\" and that \"the girls don't care for sewing and cooking,\" said\r\non another occasion that the majority of children in auto-mechanics,\r\nprinting, and household arts were Negroes. He also reported more Negro\r\nthan white children in the normal course preparing themselves to be\r\nteachers, though this was the first year that this had been the case.\r\n\r\n_Comparative scholarship in elementary schools._--Negro children are\r\nreported to be slower than the Jews, less responsive than the Bohemians,\r\nand more ambitious than the Italians. A manual-training and domestic-arts\r\nteacher thought Negroes did as good work as the Jews, Bohemians, and\r\nwhite Americans whom he taught. A Latin teacher said that the Negroes\r\nwere studious and ambitious, and that in every way she preferred them\r\nto the Jews.\r\n\r\nSeveral teachers thought the Negroes were slow and lacked logic and\r\n\"sticking qualities.\" An upper-grade teacher explained the slowness\r\nas partly due to the fact that they had been pushed out of the crowded\r\nlower grades before they were ready for more advanced work. A physics\r\nteacher who was convinced that Negro children had no ambition said it was\r\nhis policy to promote a Negro child if the child had made the effort,\r\nbecause he appreciated that the child had come \"to the limit of his\r\nmental ability.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal who said that Negroes had no \"sticking qualities\" gave a\r\nsingle instance of a boy who wanted to become a mechanical engineer but\r\ngave up the course after five months, because he said he did not care\r\nenough about the course to work at it for several years. In endeavoring\r\nto prove that Negro children are not successful in completing high-school\r\nwork, this principal emphasized the fact that in the 3-B class 20 per\r\ncent of the Negroes dropped out as compared with 6 per cent of the\r\nwhites. In actual numbers three Negroes and two whites dropped out. He\r\ndid not mention that in the 2-A class 12 per cent of the whites (sixteen\r\nchildren) as compared with 3 per cent of the Negroes (three children)\r\ndropped out. In the 4-B grade 21 per cent of the whites (three children)\r\nand none of the Negroes dropped out. The fact that 21 per cent of the\r\nwhites dropped out was explained by the principal to be due to the fact\r\nthat the white children wished to graduate from a high school wholly\r\nwhite. However, only three children were involved.\r\n\r\n_Attendance and failures._--Table XVI shows the record for attendance\r\nand failures in three groups of schools attended mainly by Negroes, by\r\nchildren of immigrants and by white Americans. It will be noticed that\r\nthe best attendance records are found in Douglas and Farren schools,\r\nboth mainly attended by Negroes. The other schools, attended mainly by\r\nNegroes, compare favorably with those attended by whites.\r\n\r\nThe smallest percentage of failures is at Colman (92 per cent), while\r\nthe next to the largest percentage is also at a school attended mainly\r\nby Negroes (Raymond, 93 per cent). This may be explained to a certain\r\nextent by the fact that there is a higher economic class of Negroes in\r\nthe neighborhood of the Colman School. In the other schools the percentage\r\nof failures compares very favorably with that of whites.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE XVI\r\n\r\n     ENROLMENT, AVERAGE ATTENDANCE, AND NUMBER OF FAILURES IN TWENTY SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n  ===================================================================================\r\n                              | Enrol- |  Average   | Percent- |  Number  | Percent-\r\n           School             |  ment  | Attendance |  age  of |    of    |  age of\r\n                              |        |            | Attend-  | Failures |Failures\r\n                              |        |            |   ance   |          |\r\n  ----------------------------+--------+------------+----------+----------+---------\r\n  Attended mainly by Negroes: |        |            |          |          |\r\n    Colman, 92 per cent       |    964 |        709 |       73 |       13 |      1.8\r\n    Doolittle, 85 per cent    |  1,784 |      1,282 |       72 |       77 |      6.0\r\n    Douglas, 93 per cent      |  1,443 |      1,341 |       93 |       -- |      ---\r\n    Farren, 92 per cent       |    986 |        924 |       93 |       83 |      8.9\r\n    Forrestville, 38 per cent |  1,493 |      1,085 |       73 |      130 |     12.0\r\n    Haven, 20 per cent        |  1,165 |        700 |       60 |       24 |      3.4\r\n    McCosh, 15 per cent       |  1,280 |      1,017 |       79 |       -- |      ---\r\n    Moseley, 70 per cent      |    923 |        605 |       66 |       81 |     13.3\r\n    Raymond, 93 per cent      |  1,532 |      1,299 |       85 |      200 |     15.4\r\n    Webster, 30 per cent      |    805 |        654 |       81 |       -- |      ---\r\n  Attended mainly by          |        |            |          |          |\r\n     children of immigrants:  |        |            |          |          |\r\n    Farragut                  |  1,729 |      1,502 |       86 |      107 |      7.0\r\n    Goodrich                  |  1,305 |      1,039 |       78 |      121 |     11.6\r\n    Kosciusko                 |  1,134 |        775 |       68 |       33 |      4.2\r\n    Lawson                    |  3,069 |      2,545 |       83 |      292 |     11.5\r\n    McCormick                 |  1,432 |      1,266 |       88 |      204 |     16.1\r\n    Seward                    |  1,058 |        708 |       67 |       43 |      5.9\r\n    Smyth                     |  1,106 |        860 |       77 |       69 |      8.0\r\n    Swing                     |    810 |        629 |       77 |       99 |     15.8\r\n  Attended mainly by white    |        |            |          |          |\r\n      Americans:              |        |            |          |          |\r\n    Fiske                     |  1,535 |      1,272 |       83 |       45 |      3.5\r\n    Howland                   |  2,161 |      1,809 |       84 |      100 |      5.0\r\n     -------------------------+--------+------------+----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\nC. CONTACTS IN RECREATION\r\n\r\nIn studying contacts between the races at places of recreation a survey\r\nwas made of the various recreational facilities maintained by the\r\nMunicipal Bureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing Beaches, the South\r\nPark Commission, the West Chicago Park Commission, and the Lincoln Park\r\nCommission. Recreational facilities maintained by twelve park boards which\r\ncontrol smaller areas in outlying parts of the city were not included\r\nin the survey unless they were in or near Negro areas. Visits were made\r\nby the Commission's investigator to places in or bordering on the Negro\r\nareas at a time of day when the use of the park would be greatest; the\r\ndirector or one of his assistants was interviewed and observations were\r\nmade as to the relations between Negroes and whites.\r\n\r\nThe information thus gathered was supplemented by a conference held\r\nby the Commission, at which representatives of the various park boards\r\ndiscussed policies and experiences with reference to race relations in\r\nthe various recreation places under their charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CLASSIFICATION OF FACILITIES\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no definite city-wide classification, the publicly\r\nmaintained recreation facilities of the city may, for the purpose of\r\nthis study, be grouped by types and defined as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. _Playground._--A small tract of land, usually adjacent to\r\n     public schools, providing space for ball games, gymnastic and\r\n     play apparatus, and in most cases a small building used as an\r\n     office and storage place for apparatus.\r\n\r\n     2. _Recreation center._--Including outdoor and indoor gymnasiums\r\n     for men, women, and children, a swimming-pool, and a little\r\n     children's playground out doors, and a field house providing\r\n     an assembly room and dance hall, clubrooms, shower baths, and\r\n     often an infant-welfare station and branch library.\r\n\r\n     3. _Large park._--A large area with lawns, shrubbery, and\r\n     general recreation facilities, such as tennis, golf, baseball,\r\n     and boating.\r\n\r\n     4. _Bathing-beach._--Intended primarily for swimmers and usually\r\n     including no other recreation equipment. A dressing-house,\r\n     showers, and towel supply are provided with life guard and\r\n     attendants on duty.\r\n\r\n     5. _Swimming-pool._--In some instances a swimming-pool or\r\n     natatorium is maintained separately from a recreation center.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DISTRIBUTION OF FACILITIES IN RELATION TO NEGRO AREAS\r\n\r\nOf a total of 127 public places of recreation excluding the large parks,\r\nthirty-seven are in or near Negro areas. Of the eighty-two playgrounds,\r\nfourteen are in the Negro areas and nine are adjacent. Of the twenty-nine\r\nrecreation centers, none is located within the Negro areas, but seven\r\nare adjacent.\r\n\r\nThough these figures seem to indicate that the Negro areas are fairly\r\nwell supplied with recreation facilities, it should be borne in mind\r\nthat their use by the Negroes in their vicinity is by no means free and\r\nundisputed. The reasons for this are shown in the next section on \"Use\r\nof Facilities,\" but the following summary of use will aid in considering\r\nthe distribution of recreation facilities in relation to the Negro areas:\r\n\r\n     =====================================================================\r\n                        |           |          |            | Number Used\r\n                        | Total for | In Negro | Near Negro | 10 Per Cent\r\n                        |   City    |  Areas   |   Areas    | or More by\r\n                        |           |          |            |   Negroes\r\n     -------------------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------\r\n     Playgrounds        |        82 |       14 |          9 |          13\r\n     Recreation centers |        29 |     None |          7 |           1\r\n     Bathing-beaches    |         8 |        3 |          2 |           1\r\n     -------------------+-----------+----------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\nThe type of recreation facility most commonly found in the Negro areas\r\nis the playground. The lack of recreation centers within the Negro areas\r\nis conspicuous, as is also the fact that six of the seven recreation\r\ncenters accessible to Negroes are not used as much as 10 per cent by\r\nthem. The playground is intended for the use of young children and has\r\npractically nothing to attract older children and adults, except sometimes\r\na baseball or athletic field. Indoor facilities are not a part of the\r\nequipment of a playground, so that the average maintenance cost of a\r\nplayground is not more than $2,000 to $5,000 a year.[41]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RECREATION FACILITIES]\r\n\r\nThe recreation center is the most unusual and notable feature of Chicago's\r\nrecreation system but one from which the Negro gets little benefit. It\r\nis a complete community center, with both indoor and outdoor facilities.\r\nIt represents an investment of from $200,000 to $800,000, according to\r\nthe amount of ground, the location, and the extent of its facilities. The\r\nyearly expenditure necessary to maintain such a recreation center where\r\nolder children and adults can hold meetings, dances, and entertainments,\r\nand where there are concerts, indoor games, swimming-pools, showers,\r\netc., is shown by the reports of the park boards to be from $30,000 to\r\n$50,000. Though the argument that wholesome recreation makes for better\r\ncitizenship applies to Negroes as well as to whites, no recreation center\r\nhas been located within the Negro areas and only seven near them.[42]\r\n\r\nThe director of Armour Square, a recreation center which is just beyond\r\nthe edge of the main Negro area, but which the Negroes do not feel free\r\nto use for reasons discussed later, was asked what places of recreation\r\nfor adult Negroes existed in that neighborhood. She instanced a social\r\nsettlement that had been out of existence for more than six years, an\r\ninfant-welfare station and a commercial amusement park known to be in\r\nbad repute.\r\n\r\nAlthough in recent years the Negro population has been increasing in\r\ndensity in the neighborhood directly east of Wentworth Avenue along which\r\nHardin, Armour, and Fuller recreation centers are located, this has not\r\nincreased the use of these centers by Negroes. It has tended, rather, to\r\nincrease the antagonism of the whites in the vicinity to the use of the\r\ncenters by Negroes. In this neighborhood the hostility toward Negroes\r\nof whites, especially gangs of hoodlums, is shown by the many attacks\r\nupon Negroes in this area as discussed in the sections on the \"Riot of\r\n1919\" and \"Antecedent Clashes.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral representatives of the park boards strongly deprecated the lack\r\nof recreation centers within the Negro area and said that such facilities\r\nshould be provided. The South Park representative recommended the area\r\neast of Wentworth Avenue between Thirtieth and Forty-seventh streets as\r\none needing additional facilities. The West Park representative said: \"A\r\ncomplete all-year-round recreation center for the colored people should\r\nbe established at Ashland and Lake streets. We need greater facilities,\r\nor equal facilities, for the colored people. There isn't any place on\r\nthe West Side that I know of, but yet we have many of these complete\r\nrecreation centers there for the whites.\" Although the Negroes on the\r\nWest Side had never asked for additional facilities, the white people\r\nin that neighborhood had frequently asked the West Park Commission to\r\nprovide greater facilities for the Negroes. The Negroes in the district\r\nwere not organized, according to the West Park official, but the white\r\npeople realized that something ought to be done for the Negroes and made\r\nthe request.\r\n\r\nThe director of Seward Park said the maintenance cost was the chief\r\nobstacle to additional recreational facilities. \"The law permits\r\nacquisition of property for small parks by request of citizens and bond\r\nissues for the purchase of the property and its development,\" he said.\r\n\"When it comes to maintenance the question of taxes comes in, and unless\r\npeople are willing to be taxed in excess of what they are taxed now,\r\nthere won't be any possibility of maintaining more parks.\"\r\n\r\nThough there are three public bathing-beaches near the main Negro\r\narea, the whites seem to expect Negroes to confine themselves to the\r\nTwenty-sixth Street Beach. It is quite limited and unattractive in\r\napproach and surroundings. The approach is over a rough road through a\r\nmuch-neglected neighborhood, and then up a long flight of stairs to a\r\nfour-foot viaduct over the railroad tracks, and a roundhouse and switch\r\nyards are near by. The beach is a strip of sand about fifty feet wide\r\nand a short block in length; it narrows at one end to the tracks and at\r\nthe other end is walled by a high embankment. While it offers a chance\r\nto get into the lake, the atmosphere of wholesome, recreative outdoor\r\nlife is entirely lacking.\r\n\r\nIn the Morgan Park region there is a large Negro population but no park\r\nor playground within its Negro area. Barnard Playground and Ridge Park\r\nare the nearest facilities, a mile or more distant. Negro children said\r\nthey did not go there because \"those are in Beverley Hills and only rich\r\nfolks go there--no colored people.\" The directors of these parks said\r\nthere was no discrimination against Negroes but that they did not come\r\nbecause they felt that these parks were \"for white folks only.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

Negroes approximately, 19,000.[43]\r\n\r\n_Factors influencing attendance._--Out of the thirty-five playgrounds,\r\nrecreation centers, and bathing-beaches in or near the Negro areas for\r\nwhich attendance figures were secured, at fifteen Negro attendance never\r\namounted to more than 10 per cent, and usually was less. In several\r\ncases distance or such barriers as railroad tracks seemed to explain the\r\nsmall percentage of Negro patrons. In other cases it seemed due to the\r\nexistence of other facilities nearer the center of the Negro area which\r\nwere more largely patronized by the Negroes; an example is Stanton,\r\nwhich though not far from the Negro area is farther than Seward Park.\r\nThe small number of Negroes at other places often could not be explained\r\nby the director. At Gladstone Playground, for example, in a neighborhood\r\nwhere the Negro population was increasing rapidly, practically no Negro\r\nchildren were found, though the white children said there were plenty\r\nof Negro children in the school. \"They don't stick around after school\r\nhours or in the summer,\" said the children, but no one appeared to know\r\nwhy this was the case, as there had never been any difficulty at this\r\nplayground. Negro children used Drake and Sherwood playgrounds much\r\nless, or not at all, after school hours and in summer. At Drake, though\r\nthe two races mingled in games in the daytime and no disorders had\r\noccurred, the Negro boys took no part in the games in the evening when\r\nthe older white boys were home. This, the director said, was due not\r\nto timidity or fear of aggression, but rather to \"lack of ambition.\" At\r\nSherwood Playground, west of Wentworth Avenue, where 50 per cent of the\r\nchildren using the playground during school hours were Negroes, there\r\nwere no Negroes on the playground in the afternoon and evening and all\r\nsummer. This was said to be due to the fact that the Negro children in\r\nthe school, especially the girls, were larger than the white children\r\nand during the school session were the dominating group. After school,\r\nhowever, the older white children got home from other schools or from work\r\nand assumed control, allowing no Negroes in the playground. The Negroes\r\nthen went to Carter Playground, which is east of Wentworth Avenue, in\r\nthe main Negro settlement. This separation, the attendant stated, was\r\ndue entirely to action on the part of the children, as the officials did\r\nnot discriminate in any way. This neighborhood has been much disturbed\r\nand is discussed in more detail under \"Contacts.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A TYPICAL SCHOOL YARD PLAYGROUND IN A WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD]\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of each park commission said that they had no rules or\r\nregulations of any kind discriminating against Negroes, and that all\r\nraces were treated in exactly the same way. The only case in which this\r\nrule appeared to be violated was in connection with Negro golf players\r\nat Jackson Park. Two Negroes participated in the Amateur Golf Tournament\r\nat Jackson Park in the summer of 1918 and made good records. The only\r\nrequirement for entrance into the tournament at that time was residence\r\nin the city for one year. In 1919 the requirements were increased,\r\nentries being limited to the lowest sixty-four scores, and membership\r\nin a \"regularly organized golf club\" being required. Since Negroes\r\nare not accepted in established golf clubs, the Negro golf players\r\nmet this qualification by organizing a new club, \"The Windy City Golf\r\nAssociation.\" In 1920 the restriction was added that contestants must\r\nbelong to a regularly organized golf club affiliated with the Western\r\nGolf Association. As it was impossible for Negro clubs to secure such\r\naffiliation, it is impossible for Negroes to compete in the tournament.\r\n\r\nUnofficial discrimination, however, frequently creeps in. According to\r\nthe representative of the Municipal Bureau, \"the person in charge of the\r\npark is largely influenced by the attitude of the people outside the\r\npark. We had trouble at Beutner Playground because of the tendency on\r\nthe part of the director, who was a white man, to be influenced by the\r\nattitude of the white people in the neighborhood, and either consciously\r\nor unconsciously showed by his actions to the colored people that they\r\nwere not fully accepted.\" Beutner Playground later became an example\r\nof unofficial discrimination in favor of the Negroes, for the Municipal\r\nBureau decided to \"turn over the playground particularly to Negroes\" and\r\ninstructed the director \"to give them more use of the facilities than the\r\nwhites.\" But this was found to be impossible as long as a white director\r\nwas employed, because he was influenced by the feeling of the whites\r\nin the neighborhood who did not want the playground turned over to the\r\nNegroes. The desired result was finally obtained by employing a Negro\r\ndirector. \"Then the switch suddenly came,\" said the park representative,\r\n\"and the playground was turned over to the Negroes almost exclusively.\"\r\n\r\nA similar method was employed with reference to the Twenty-sixth Street\r\nBeach, according to the head of the Municipal Bureau, who said: \"As the\r\ncolored population gradually got heavier and more demand came for the use\r\nof that beach it gradually developed into a beach that was used almost\r\nexclusively by Negroes. And we did as we did in the Beutner case: we\r\nemployed a Negro director when the preponderance was Negro.\"\r\n\r\nThis beach has since been transferred to the South Park Commission, and\r\nthere is no longer a Negro director there, though most of the attendants\r\nare Negroes.\r\n\r\nPark policemen will not let Negroes go in swimming at the Thirty-eighth\r\nStreet Beach, according to a Negro playground director. \"The park\r\npolicemen tell you, 'You can't go in, you better not go in, I'd advise\r\nyou not to go in,'\" said the director. \"If you try to go in he keeps\r\nyou out.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negro director of Beutner Playground reported an unpleasant personal\r\nencounter with the policeman of Armour Square. \"Last summer I had\r\noccasion to go over there with my assistant who is colored. We went to\r\nthe library and the park police officer we met said, 'niggers ought to\r\nstay in Beutner Park.'\" Policemen in Armour Square also had helped to\r\ndrive out Negro boys who had gone over there to use the showers, according\r\nto this director. In addition he said that Negro boys had been refused\r\npermits to play baseball at Armour Square. The director of the park\r\nsaid, in answer to these statements, that there was no discrimination\r\non the part of the management and if such things had occurred it was\r\nwithout the knowledge of the management and due to the fact that the\r\napplicants did not see anyone in authority. \"The only applicants I have\r\nhad for a colored baseball team this year was for an outside industrial\r\nteam, and they were given permission,\" said the director. \"Whether the\r\npolice officer followed them up and told them they shouldn't come back,\r\nI don't know, but they didn't come back. I gave them the permit to come.\"\r\n\r\nAt one or two parks definite efforts had been made to encourage larger\r\nnumbers of Negroes to make use of the facilities, but at Armour Square\r\nthe director did not believe this to be advisable. \"I have never gone\r\nout to do any promotional work to bring them in,\" she said, \"because I\r\nwould not choose personally to be responsible for the things that would\r\nhappen outside my gates if I were responsible for bringing large groups\r\ninto Armour Square. If such groups come to me for reservations I give\r\nthem, but they don't come.\" This director also said that she would feel\r\nit necessary to warn any Negro group that might come to her park that\r\nshe could not be responsible for their protection outside the park.\r\n\r\nAt Union Park, which has a playground and swimming-pool and is situated\r\non the edge of the densest Negro residential area on the West Side,\r\nevery effort has been made to encourage the Negroes of the neighborhood\r\nto make use of the limited facilities, according to the representative\r\nof the West Chicago Park Commission, who said:\r\n\r\n     We have advertised among the colored people and done everything\r\n     we could to get them to use the swimming-pool, shower baths,\r\n     and reading-room, and send their children to the playground.\r\n     The result to some extent is satisfactory but of course they\r\n     are not using it in proportion to the population of the Negroes\r\n     in that neighborhood. That, I think, is partly due to the fact\r\n     that we ought to have some other facilities there. We ought to\r\n     have some equipment for boys over sixteen years of age, and we\r\n     ought to have an assembly hall, a regular library, clubrooms,\r\n     and other facilities for the recreation of older boys and girls.\r\n\r\nThe director of Fuller Park told of a special effort he had made, with\r\nthe assistance of a Y.M.C.A. physical instructor, a Negro, to increase\r\nthe use of the park by Negroes living east of Wentworth Avenue. The\r\nY.M.C.A. instructor guaranteed to get the people, and 400 application\r\nblanks were distributed among Negro children in the Sunday schools of\r\nthe neighborhood. All the blanks were signed with the names of Negro\r\nchildren between eight and sixteen and returned to the office. When\r\nthe classes started a few weeks later, no Negro children appeared. The\r\ndistributor of the blanks tried for three or four weeks to find out why\r\nthe Negro children did not come but failed to discover any reason. Then\r\nthe director sent a notice to the _Defender_, a widely circulated Negro\r\nnewspaper, saying that the children who had signed application blanks\r\nfor classes at Fuller Park were requested to come at any time and were\r\njust as welcome as white children. Thereupon a few children came--two\r\nor three out of a class of thirty. Additional notices were put in the\r\n_Defender_, and an effort was made to interest the Negro pastors, but\r\nthe attendance did not increase, and finally the attempt was given up\r\nfor that year. The next year a similar effort was made but with only\r\nslightly better results. At the band concerts and moving pictures the\r\nNegro attendance is fairly good, and a large number of Negroes use the\r\nlibrary, but the gymnasium and the children's playground are used very\r\nlittle by the Negroes, and the swimming-pool practically not at all.\r\n\r\nThe reasons advanced by the park officials for the non-use of convenient\r\nrecreation facilities are that the Negro is timid and reluctant to go\r\nwhere he feels he is not wanted, or that he fears attack in the park or\r\nnear it. At a conference the West Park representative said:\r\n\r\n     When we first opened the doors of Union Park we thought,\r\n     owing to the large colored population in the district, that\r\n     the colored people would come there most willingly and avail\r\n     themselves of the facilities just as freely as any person\r\n     would. But we found that it was not so, that the greater number\r\n     of persons who came there were the whites, and they as usual\r\n     availed themselves of the facilities freely. The colored were\r\n     timid, came in gradually, and as soon as they found they were\r\n     welcome, that there was no line of discrimination drawn, the\r\n     attendance of the colored increased.\r\n\r\nAt Sherwood Playground, Armour Square, and Fuller Square, all west of\r\nWentworth Avenue, which is considered the dividing line between the\r\nwhite and Negro areas, fear is probably a large factor in the small\r\nNegro attendance, as the feeling in the neighborhood is bitter and\r\nfights have been frequent. At Sherwood Negro children use the playground\r\nduring school hours when they feel that they have the protection of the\r\nschool, but not after school when they feel that protection is lacking.\r\nWebster School at Wentworth Avenue and Thirty-third Street, which is 30\r\nper cent Negro, has its graduation exercises in Armour Square, but the\r\nNegro children do not go to Armour Square at any other time, and they\r\ndid not go over at night for an entertainment which the principal of\r\nWebster School arranged at Armour Square. Negro children use the Armour\r\nSquare library freely, according to the director, but there has never\r\nbeen an application for the use of a clubroom, and no Negroes come to\r\nthe outdoor moving pictures which are given one night a week. \"There's\r\nabsolutely nothing to prevent them coming,\" said the director. \"Why don't\r\nthey come? There is nothing within the park they need to be afraid of.\r\nThere has been absolutely no distinction made in the handling of colored\r\nchildren or colored men or colored women coming to Armour Square, but\r\nthey do not come.\" The director was positive that the failure to come\r\nto the park was due to the attitude toward Negroes outside the park. She\r\nexplained that although she could guarantee safety and police protection\r\ninside the park, she could do nothing to protect Negroes outside the\r\npark gates. The park policemen are employees of the park boards and not\r\nof the city and have no jurisdiction outside the parks. This is true of\r\nthe police at all parks and beaches maintained by the park boards, but\r\nthe police at the playgrounds and beaches maintained by the Municipal\r\nBureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing Beaches are members of the\r\nregular city police force.\r\n\r\nContinuing, the Armour Square director said:\r\n\r\n     Personally I know of no disturbances that have started within\r\n     Armour Square, and yet we have had outside of Armour Square\r\n     every year at least two riots, not counting the general race\r\n     riot--riots that started largely in school clashes. There\r\n     have been some very serious riots between the children of the\r\n     Webster School and the Keith School just east of it, and there\r\n     have also been some very serious clashes between the black and\r\n     white children going to and from the parochial school--actual\r\n     fights in which they have had to call large detachments of the\r\n     police. Armour Square is not used by the colored people in\r\n     proportion to their numbers in the neighborhood, but it has\r\n     absolutely nothing to do with our management. It is because\r\n     they are afraid to come to the park. They know absolutely that\r\n     within the four walls of the park nothing is going to happen\r\n     to them.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the Negro director of the Beutner Playground seemed to\r\nindicate that Negroes were kept out of Armour Square in ways that its\r\ndirector did not know about.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CONTACTS\r\n\r\n_Behavior._--The behavior of Negroes at the parks apparently has not been\r\nthe major cause of the difficulties that have arisen in the past. Such\r\ncomplaints as were made by park officials in regard to the behavior of\r\nNegroes at the parks concerned groups of rough or domineering children\r\nat the playgrounds rather than adults.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEUTNER PLAYGROUND\r\n   The largest in the Negro residence area.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIELD HOUSE EQUIPMENT AT BEUTNER PLAYGROUND]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO ATHLETIC TEAM REPRESENTING DOOLITTLE PLAYGROUND IN\r\n   CITY-WIDE MEET]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FRIENDLY RIVALRY\r\n   White and Negro boys at a playground near the Negro residence area]\r\n\r\nThe playgrounds where the attitude of Negro children was criticized\r\nwere Sherwood and Moseley, both in neighborhoods where unusually bitter\r\nracial feeling was reported by the playground directors. The older Negro\r\ngirls were particularly rough and hard to control, these officials said,\r\nabusing small children both white and Negro, monopolizing apparatus,\r\nand refusing to leave the playground when asked to do so.\r\n\r\nTestimony in regard to adults indicated that the park directors found\r\nthem quiet and desirable patrons of the parks. Said the director of\r\nSeward Park:\r\n\r\n     One of the most interesting and best-conducted and best-behaved\r\n     groups I have ever seen is a group of colored people known as\r\n     the \"Jolly Twenty,\" a dancing organization. They started coming\r\n     eight years ago and had a system of couple dancing which was\r\n     marvelous. I have never seen it equaled anywhere. They have\r\n     been coming every year, once a year, for a dance at Seward,\r\n     and the \"Jolly Twenty\" has grown to be about the \"Jolly Four\r\n     Hundred,\" but the larger the group the better they seem to\r\n     behave and the better they dance.\r\n\r\nThe director of Ogden Park told of a Negro club which holds frequent\r\ndances at Ogden Park. He said: \"About 300 attended the last one. They\r\nare the best-behaved group that come. I never have to object to improper\r\ndancing or boisterousness, and they always leave on time, have had to\r\nobject several times to conduct at white dancing parties.\"\r\n\r\nThis testimony in regard to Negroes at dances is interesting in view of\r\nthe situation regarding the recreation facilities at the Municipal Pier.\r\nNegro attendance there is about 8 per cent of the total attendance of\r\nfour million or five million a year, according to the director of the\r\nPier. They are well dressed and well behaved and inclined to segregate\r\nthemselves. There had never been a single instance of an intoxicated Negro\r\nor of one who had made himself in the least objectionable, the director\r\nsaid. The only people whom the pier authorities have had to reprimand\r\nfor violation of pier rules in regard to cleanliness, monopolizing of\r\nfurniture, etc., have been whites. Many of the attendants are Negroes, and\r\nthe band which plays for the dance concessionaire is composed of Negroes.\r\nNegroes are welcome everywhere on the Pier, as are all races, according\r\nto the director, except in the dance hall, where their appearance is\r\ndiscouraged by the concessionaire. The following method is followed to\r\ndiscourage the appearance of Negroes on the dance floor, according to\r\na white man who had observed it:\r\n\r\n     Admission to the dance floor is at the rate of five cents per\r\n     couple, per dance. Each dance lasts about three minutes. If\r\n     a Negro couple buys a ticket and dances one dance nothing is\r\n     said. If the couple comes in for another dance, one of the floor\r\n     managers--employed by the concessionaire--speaks courteously\r\n     to the couple. He expresses regret that he must mention the\r\n     matter of their dancing to them, but that they are not dancing\r\n     properly, and he invites them to come to a corner of the dance\r\n     floor where he will instruct them in the proper way to dance.\r\n     This usually occupies the remainder of the particular dance,\r\n     and results in the Negroes not coming on the floor again. If\r\n     the couple does reappear, the floor manager again speaks to\r\n     them saying he is very sorry he has to tell them again that\r\n     they still are not dancing quite properly and again he invites\r\n     them to a corner of the dance floor for further instruction.\r\n     This is the procedure by which the Negroes are embarrassed\r\n     and discouraged from using the dance floor.\r\n\r\n_Relations between the children._--Lack of antagonism was reported at a\r\nlarge number of playgrounds. Apparatus was used by both groups without\r\nfriction, Negro and white children mingled freely in their games and\r\nin the swimming-pools, and both Negroes and whites played on baseball\r\nand athletic teams. Occasional playground fights had taken place, but\r\nusually without any element of racial antipathy. \"There might be personal\r\nmisunderstandings and disagreements between a white and a black just\r\nthe same as between two whites,\" said the director of Union Park, \"but I\r\nwouldn't lay it to race prejudice. They work together and play together\r\nand seem to harmonize in most instances.\" When this director came to\r\nUnion Park a year before he found a tendency among Negroes and whites\r\nto group by themselves, but steps were taken to bring them together in\r\ngames of various kinds, and toward the end of the season the director\r\nfelt that they \"harmonized better and worked together more cordially\r\nthan they did before.\" When the investigator from the Commission visited\r\nUnion Park Playground, he saw the small children playing together on the\r\nsame pieces of apparatus--a Negro child on one end of a teeter ladder\r\nand a white child on the other.\r\n\r\nThese children were ten years or under. The director felt that it was\r\nnot until children reached the age of eleven years or older that they\r\nbegan to feel racial antipathy. In the swimming-pool at this park, which\r\nis used by the older children and adults, the Negroes and whites kept\r\nseparate. There was no trouble between them, but they stayed in separate\r\ngroups. The director felt that there was little likelihood of trouble\r\never starting in this park, because \"where such nicknames as 'Smoke'\r\nare applied to colored boys by white boys, and is given and accepted in\r\na friendly spirit, there is little chance for serious disturbance.\"\r\n\r\nAs this playground in Union Park is intended for children under ten,\r\nthe occasional difficulties between older children might be alleviated\r\nif the Hayes Playground, one of those in the system maintained by the\r\nMunicipal Bureau, were kept open in the summer. The playground at the\r\nHayes School, 80 per cent Negro, was closed and the apparatus dismantled\r\nin the summer of 1920 when the investigator visited it. Though it is not\r\na large playground it is the one the older Negro children are accustomed\r\nto use during the school year, and they are doubtless reluctant to go\r\nin the summer to other school playgrounds which they do not ordinarily\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAt Seward Park the Negroes use the facilities freely and play with the\r\nwhite children on the apparatus and in the ball field. The only difficulty\r\nreported here was in connection with a wrestling tournament. The director\r\ndescribed it as follows:\r\n\r\n     Last season we had a wrestling championship tournament. There\r\n     were some colored groups who had wrestled at Seward who were\r\n     eligible for entrance into this tournament, and when the night\r\n     came for weighing in, the director for one of the other parks\r\n     said, \"What are these colored people doing here?\" \"They are\r\n     weighing in.\" I said. \"They will not wrestle with my group,\"\r\n     he said. \"Very well, then, I guess your groups will not be in\r\n     it,\" I said.\r\n\r\n     It looked as though we were up against a problem, but the night\r\n     when the wrestling came the colored contestants didn't show\r\n     up, so that the problem was solved for that time. Of course we\r\n     couldn't say that any white man must wrestle with a colored\r\n     man. It presented a problem that had to be settled in some\r\n     way. I think the reason they didn't show up was because I told\r\n     my investigator to say to these colored men, \"Next season if\r\n     you have a sufficiently large group you can have a contest of\r\n     your own. We'll award the same prizes to colored wrestlers as\r\n     we do to the white.\"\r\n\r\nThe representative of the Municipal Bureau also spoke of occasional\r\ndifficulty in wrestling, though there may be no objection to Negro\r\nparticipation in other events. He said:\r\n\r\n     We have athletic meets in which a Negro team has competed\r\n     and for five years has won the championship in athletics. In\r\n     baseball there is no trouble. The difficulty comes in some of\r\n     the activities, particularly wrestling, because of the nature of\r\n     the activity. It is a closer contact. We make no distinction,\r\n     however, and when a Negro boy gets up to face a white boy and\r\n     the white boy doesn't face him, the bout is forfeited to the\r\n     Negro. I think more meet than fail to.\r\n\r\nAt Fiske Playground, where there are few Negroes, as they do not live\r\nnear, the investigator witnessed a baseball game with a team from Colman\r\nPlayground composed entirely of Negro boys except the pitcher. They\r\nplayed as any teams would, with no evidence of racial antipathy. The\r\nNegro team seemed to be the better, and according to the director had\r\nwon every game so far that season.\r\n\r\nAt McCosh, Robey, Carter, Oakland, Colman, Doolittle, and Beutner\r\nplaygrounds the children mingled without friction, according to the\r\ndirectors. Negroes were in a minority at the first three and in a majority\r\nat the last four. At Carter Playground the investigator witnessed the\r\npresentation of a medal for athletics to one of the white boys while the\r\nNegro boys looked on in admiration and, after it was over, invited the\r\nwhite boys to \"come on out and play ball.\" The only trouble that has been\r\nexperienced at this playground was a few days before the 1919 riot, when\r\na fight between a white boy and a Negro started on the playground and\r\nthe spectators divided along racial lines, especially after the fight\r\nwas transferred to the street. A riot call was sent in, and the police\r\nput a stop to the fight. No trouble has occurred since and the director\r\nbelieved it could not happen again. \"The boys have learned better,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nFree mingling of Negro and white children was observed at Oakland and\r\nRobey playgrounds and was encouraged by the directors. Italian and Negro\r\nboys were playing ball together when the investigator visited Robey\r\nPlayground, and Negro and white girls were playing on the same slides.\r\nThe director said that in the evening the ball games were watched by\r\nboth Negroes and whites, and that frequently the Negroes had a game\r\nthemselves, which white onlookers enjoyed watching. The only incident\r\nof importance at Robey Playground had occurred a few days before, when\r\na dispute over a baseball game arose between a white boy of fourteen and\r\ntwo Negro boys of eleven, resulting in a fight in which the director had\r\nto interfere. The director said there was not the slightest chance that\r\nsuch a fight would divide the playground along racial lines, as there\r\nhad never been any disorders there, and that animosity between the Negro\r\nand white groups was entirely lacking.\r\n\r\nAt Oakland Playground, where neither race predominated strongly, the\r\nassistant director said there had never been any difficulty. The\r\ninvestigator witnessed a ball game in which Negro and white girls\r\nparticipated and saw groups of Negro and white boys talking outside the\r\nplayground in a friendly manner.\r\n\r\nAt Colman, Beutner, and Doolittle playgrounds, where the Negroes come\r\nin the majority, no difficulties were reported. The Negro director of\r\nDoolittle Playground encourages comradeship between Negro and white\r\nchildren and allows no discrimination against white children. \"If a\r\nwhite boy can make a team, he makes it,\" this director says to a Negro\r\nteam which objects to a white boy being allowed to play on it. When\r\nthis director was assigned to Doolittle Playground he was told that 60\r\nper cent of those who made use of the playground were Negro and 40 per\r\ncent white. When he got there he found that 70 per cent were white and\r\n30 per cent were Negroes. He said:\r\n\r\n     I had to look around to find a colored child, but I never had\r\n     any trouble. Of course the white people gradually moved out\r\n     and the colored people moved in. We never had any trouble with\r\n     colored boys or white boys--they played on the same teams. In\r\n     fact, I think we won the district championship for four years.\r\n     Then they moved me over to the Beutner and the majority of the\r\n     white children got up a petition to bring me back to Doolittle\r\n     Playground. That shows there was no distinction there. They\r\n     wanted me because we carried on activities.\r\n\r\nWhite ball teams often use the field at Beutner Playground in spite of\r\nthe fact that Armour Square is only two blocks away. \"Last year [1919]\r\nthere were several games between white and colored teams,\" said the\r\nassistant director, \"but there have been none so far in 1920.\"\r\n\r\nNo difficulties between Negroes and whites were reported at Palmer\r\nPark, Bessemer Park, or Thorpe, Otis, and Orleans playgrounds, which\r\nare patronized by a few Negroes, though they are too far away from the\r\nNegro areas to be generally used.\r\n\r\nThe supervisor of girls' work in the Municipal Bureau made the following\r\nstatement in regard to the relations between the Negro and white children\r\nvisiting the municipal playgrounds:\r\n\r\n     From my observation and supervision of the girls' work in the\r\n     municipal playgrounds I can only say that in all our activities\r\n     colored and white children mingle without restriction. In\r\n     indoor gymnasium and dancing-classes as well as in games,\r\n     athletics, and general informal use of the playground, they\r\n     take part together. Ability and sportsmanship are the only\r\n     qualifications considered in candidates for any playground team.\r\n     In the field of adult recreation, since we have no community\r\n     centers conducting indoor activities in connection with any of\r\n     our playgrounds within the colored area, my observations refer\r\n     only to outdoor gatherings. On such occasions adults of both\r\n     races mingle without friction. It is my experience that the\r\n     most harmonious relations are established in connection with\r\n     band concerts, field days, festivals, pageants, etc., including\r\n     all forms of community art, which tend to unify rather than to\r\n     split those taking part. In the Illinois Centennial Pageant,\r\n     presented by groups from thirty-eight neighborhoods in 1918,\r\n     girls from Doolittle Playground represented \"Dances of the New\r\n     Freedom,\" bringing \"Liberty and New Strength to Illinois.\" In\r\n     preparation of this episode several rehearsals were held at\r\n     Doolittle Playground, white dancers from other playgrounds\r\n     taking part; and the interest and co-operation shown by the\r\n     neighbors made each evening memorable.\r\n\r\n_Voluntary racial grouping._--Voluntary racial grouping appears to be a\r\ncharacteristic of the large parks and beaches, which adults frequent,\r\nrather than of the playgrounds which are used mainly by children. One\r\ninstance of voluntary grouping among children was found at Copernicus\r\nPlayground. The percentage of Negroes using this playground is much larger\r\nin summer than in winter. The playing space is in the shape of an \"L,\"\r\none end intended for boys and the other for girls, but by common consent\r\nthe children divide along race lines rather than sex. The investigator\r\nsaw small white children playing at one end of the playground, while\r\nNegro boys were playing ball in the larger end. Later, after the Negro\r\nboys left, some of the white children used the larger space while some\r\nNegro children collected around the apparatus in the smaller end. No\r\ninstance of mixed play was observed, but there seemed to be no antagonism\r\nbetween the groups, and no disorders were reported.\r\n\r\nThe director of Union Park in speaking of boys who play games in the\r\nrecreation rooms, said that there seemed to be a tacit understanding\r\nbetween the blacks and whites that they had certain nights. On certain\r\nnights all the attendance would be black and on other nights it would\r\nall be white. Asked whether Negro and white boys who were school friends\r\nplayed separately at the park, the director said that blacks and whites\r\noften came in together, but that for every case where they came in\r\ntogether and played a sociable game, there were probably three instances\r\nwhere groups were either of one race or the other. However, the director\r\nsaid that this grouping was casual, and that there was no prevailing\r\ncommunity sentiment that the Negroes should use the park on separate\r\nnights. He believed that additional recreation facilities would help\r\ngreatly in doing away with this tendency to voluntary segregation. He\r\nalso said that the Negroes had a tendency to separate from the whites,\r\nnot because they wished to avoid them, but because they preferred to\r\nassociate with their own race.\r\n\r\nIn the general use of Lincoln and Washington parks the Negroes and whites\r\nstay in separate groups. There has never been any difficulty, according\r\nto the Lincoln Park representative, arising from the fact that Negroes\r\nhave taken possession of a spot desired by whites for a picnic or other\r\namusement. No part of either park is especially set aside for the use of\r\none race, and groups of both Negroes and whites are seen everywhere in\r\nthe parks, but they do not mingle. While there was no outward evidence\r\nof antagonism toward Negroes at the time of the investigator's visit to\r\nWashington Park, white visitors who were questioned showed an antipathy\r\nto the Negro which seemed to have its basis in the influx of Negroes\r\ninto the residence districts. One man, originally from the South, was\r\nbitter against Negroes. He said he had left the Socialist party because\r\nit accepted Negroes as equals. At an open-air \"free-speech\" meeting\r\nspeakers representing various radical doctrines were addressing a crowd\r\ncomposed almost entirely of whites. The chairman of the meeting, however,\r\nwas a Negro, whose humorous remarks made him popular with the white crowd.\r\n\r\nThe only place in Washington Park where there seemed to be a general\r\nmingling of Negroes and whites was on the ball field. There were games\r\nin which the two teams were composed entirely of Negroes, and games\r\nin which the teams were composed entirely of whites; there were also\r\ngames in which both Negroes and whites were engaged. The investigator\r\nwatched one game in which vacancies on two teams from American Legion\r\nposts had been filled by Negroes. There was the best of spirit between\r\nthe players and among the spectators. The white spectators were lined\r\nup along the first base line and the Negro spectators along the third\r\nbase line, but rooters and players joked with each other with no sign\r\nof racial antagonism.\r\n\r\nThe South Park representative testified to the good feeling between\r\nNegroes and whites at a baseball game, and said the whites often\r\npreferred to watch the Negro games. At other points in the park, however,\r\nparticularly the tennis courts and the boathouse, difficulties between\r\nthe races were reported. These will be discussed in the next section on\r\n\"Clashes.\"\r\n\r\nSeparate racial grouping is the general rule at the beaches, though it\r\nis not always voluntary. At the Thirty-eighth Street Beach, for example,\r\nNegroes are prevented by white boys and the park policeman from going\r\ninto the water, according to a Negro playground director. \"Boys who live\r\naround there from Thirty-ninth to Thirty-first Street have to swim at\r\nthe street end between Thirty-third and Thirty-second. They rock you if\r\nyou go in.\" This director was invited by white boys of the Vincennes\r\nClub to swim at Thirty-eighth Street, but when he suggested bringing\r\nsome Negro boys along the white boys said, \"Oh no, they can't come.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ARMOUR SQUARE RECREATION CENTER\r\n   Located at Thirty-third Street and Shields Avenue.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BEUTNER PLAYGROUND\r\n   Located at Thirty-third Street and La Salle Avenue.]\r\n\r\nAt the Diversey Beach in Lincoln Park both races go in the water, but\r\na Lincoln Park representative said that the few Negroes who used this\r\nbeach kept by themselves on one part of the beach, though there was\r\nno official rule compelling them to do this. There have never been any\r\nracial disturbances at this beach.\r\n\r\nFrom the Twenty-sixth Street Beach, which is patronized almost entirely\r\nby Negroes, down to Thirty-sixth Street, Negroes and whites go into the\r\nwater in separate groups, except at Twenty-sixth Street, where the few\r\nwhites who go in mingle amicably with the Negroes. The investigator\r\nsaw a white couple who had gone out to a raft and could not get back\r\nrescued by a Negro life guard. The other bathing-places along the shore\r\nfor those ten blocks have been allotted by custom exclusively to one\r\nrace or the other. At Twenty-ninth Street, where the 1919 riot started,\r\na policeman is now stationed, and no trouble has occurred since the\r\nriot, though many fights have started which the police have stopped.\r\nGangs of young men come from as far as Halsted Street, according to the\r\npolicemen, ready to fight at the slightest opportunity. Fights usually\r\noccur because of some remark made by one group about a girl in another\r\ngroup. On the whole, however, few Negroes come to Twenty-ninth Street,\r\nthe policeman said, going instead to Twenty-sixth Street.\r\n\r\nAt the beaches outside the main Negro area, such as Fifty-first Street\r\nand Triangle Park, and Clarendon and Rogers Park beaches to the north,\r\nthe only Negro patrons are a few young children. The attendants at these\r\nbeaches believe there would be trouble if adult Negroes started to use\r\nthem. Negro children have been objected to at Clarendon Beach, where\r\na man asked the director to put a little girl out because \"she was a\r\nnigger.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral directors reported that the Negroes did not use the swimming-pools\r\nmuch and segregated themselves when they did go in. The director at Union\r\nPark said the Negroes did not use the swimming-pool in proportion to\r\ntheir numbers, and that when they did use it, they came in small groups\r\nand confined themselves to a certain part of the pool instead of mingling\r\nwith the whites. He said that there was nothing in the attitude of the\r\nwhite boys to make them do this, but that it was the \"natural impulse\r\nof the colored people to do that in the swimming-pool.\" He thought that\r\nmany Negroes did not use the pool more because \"they are afraid of the\r\nwater.\" A Negro playground director testified that he had frequently\r\nseen a white boy dive off one side of the pool at Union Park when a\r\nNegro boy dived off the other side and hold the Negro boy down until,\r\nwhen he came up, he was gasping for air.\r\n\r\nThe director of Ogden Park gave an incident that had occurred recently\r\nat that park:\r\n\r\n     One day I noticed three small colored girls sitting among the\r\n     others in the \"swimming line\" waiting for the doors to open.\r\n     A few minutes afterward they were at the end of the line. I\r\n     tried to find out the reason but could discover nothing either\r\n     from the colored girls or the others. I saw that they went\r\n     back to the place in the line they had before and went to my\r\n     office. Some minutes later I looked out and saw that while\r\n     the swimming had begun, these three had not gone in but were\r\n     sitting there watching the rest. I was unable to discover why\r\n     they didn't go in--they said merely that they \"didn't want\r\n     to.\" Whether there was some threat or whether the girls were\r\n     naturally timid about going into the pool I do not know.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the South Park Commission said that in the South\r\nPark district the parents were opposed to race contacts in swimming- and\r\nwading-pools. \"Not 10 per cent of the families will allow contact with\r\nNegroes in the pools,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNone of the three natatoriums maintained by the Municipal Bureau is\r\npatronized by Negroes, with the exception of the Washington Heights pool\r\nwhich is used by a few Negro children in the summer. This pool is near\r\na Negro district, but the other two are remote from the Negro areas.\r\n\r\nA distinction was made by several directors between formal and informal\r\nactivities at playgrounds and recreation centers. It was their theory\r\nthat Negroes and whites mingled successfully in informal activities,\r\nbut not in formal ones. \"There is a difference in the informal use by\r\nchildren of a playground and the use of a recreation building where\r\nthere are clubs and dances and classes and things of that sort,\" said\r\nthe director of Armour Square. \"Children and adults come in individually\r\nto use the library and other facilities, but there are no applications\r\nfrom organized groups of Negroes for any of the facilities at Armour\r\nSquare.\" The real distinction in most cases is probably not between\r\nformal and informal use but between use by children and use by adults,\r\nas the formal activities are those in which older children and adults\r\nengage, as was pointed out by the representative of the West Chicago\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n_Clashes._--Clashes between Negroes and whites at various places of\r\nrecreation are reported as far back as 1913. These clashes in the main\r\nhave been initiated by gangs of white boys. In 1913, for example, the\r\nsecretary of boys' work at the Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A. (for Negroes)\r\nconducted a party of nineteen Negro boys from the Douglass Center\r\nBoys' Club to Armour Square. They had no difficulty in entering the\r\npark and carrying out their program of athletics. The party then took\r\nshower baths in the field house. The Y.M.C.A. secretary had noticed the\r\nincreasing crowds of white boys near-by but had no misgivings until the\r\nparty left the park. Then they were assailed with sandbags, tripped,\r\nwalked over, and some of them badly bruised. They were obliged to take\r\nrefuge in neighboring saloons and houses in Thirty-third Street west\r\nof Shields Avenue. For fully half an hour their way home was blocked,\r\nuntil a detachment of city police, called by the park police, scattered\r\nthe white gang.\r\n\r\nThat same year the Y.M.C.A. secretary had found it impossible to proceed\r\neast through Thirty-first Street to the lake with groups of Negro boys.\r\nWhen this was tried they inevitably met gangs of white boys, and fights\r\nensued with any missiles procurable. Attempts to overcome this antagonism\r\nby continuing to demonstrate that the Negro boys had a right to use\r\nthese streets were unavailing for the next two years.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 similar conflicts occurred. That winter Father Bishop, of St.\r\nThomas Episcopal Church, took a group of the Negro Y.M.C.A. boys to\r\nArmour Square to play basket-ball. The party, including Father Bishop,\r\nwas beaten up by white boys, their sweaters were taken from them, and\r\nthey were otherwise maltreated. The Y.M.C.A. staff then decided not to\r\nattempt to use the park or field house during the evenings.\r\n\r\nThe same year an attempt was made to take seventy-five of these boys\r\nthrough the Stock Yards. They had received tickets of admission to\r\nthe annual stock show, in the pavilion at \"the Yards.\" In spite of the\r\nfour adult leaders, several of the boys were struck by sticks and other\r\nmissiles while passing from one section of the show to another. The gang\r\nof white boys continually increased in numbers, and the situation by\r\nthree o'clock, two hours after the Negroes had entered, began to look\r\ndesperate. Police assistance was required to get the Negro boys safely\r\nout of the building and into street cars. No effort was made to restrain\r\nthe white gangsters, who were allowed to range through the building at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAn altercation between white and Negro boys in Washington Park is\r\non record as early as the summer of 1913. These boys were sixteen or\r\nseventeen years of age. During the spring and summer of 1919, numerous\r\noutbreaks occurred because of the use of the baseball diamonds in\r\nWashington Park by Negro players. White gangs from the neighborhood of\r\nFifty-ninth Street and Wentworth Avenue, not far from the park, also came\r\nthere to play baseball, among them some of \"Ragen's Colts.\"[44] Gang\r\nfights frequently followed the games. Park policemen usually succeeded\r\nin scattering the combatants. The same season gangs of white boys from\r\nsixteen to twenty years of age frequently annoyed Negro couples on the\r\nbenches of this park. When the Negroes showed fight, minor clashes often\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nIn Ogden Park, as far back as 1914, there were similar instances of\r\nrace antipathy, expressed by hoodlums who were more or less organized. A\r\nNegro playground director said that if Negro boys attended band concerts\r\nin that park, white gangs would wait for them outside the park, and the\r\nNegroes were slugged. The white gangs also tried to keep Negro boys from\r\nusing the shower baths at the park. This director told how a party of\r\nNegroes whom he had taken there was surrounded by white gangsters when\r\nthey emerged from the shower house. \"A boy reached around and caught me\r\nand pulled me up close to the other fellow,\" he said. \"I dug down and\r\ngot out. Of course they rushed for me. In the rush the other colored\r\nlads got out. Brass knuckles were used on me. When I looked up they\r\nsaid, 'My God, you have hit L--; you have hit the wrong fellow.'\" The\r\ndirector declares that the man who hit him with the brass knuckles was\r\ndischarged by the court with a reprimand.\r\n\r\nThis condition in the parks continued up to the early summer of 1920.\r\nGeorge R. Arthur, secretary of the Negro Y.M.C.A. branch, expressed the\r\nfear at that time that a riot might occur in Washington Park any Sunday\r\nafternoon. He described the condition in the vicinity of the boathouse in\r\nthat park as \"fierce.\" There were fights there every Sunday. Five white\r\nmen had beaten a Negro there one night the previous week. That sort of\r\nthing had been going on for years, he said. The Y.M.C.A. had long been\r\ndealing with the situation but he had noticed this trouble especially\r\nin the last two years. He attributed it to the gang spirit and to racial\r\nantipathy, which ordinarily would not amount to much, but which because\r\nof the tense situation in Chicago might lead to serious riots.\r\n\r\nThe director of the Negro branch of Community Service of Chicago ascribed\r\nthe trouble to the same source. He said that most of the white boys came\r\nto Washington Park from the \"Ragen's Colts\" Club, that some of them went\r\nto poolrooms where the mischief was hatched. There was but one policeman\r\nin charge of about fifteen baseball games in the park, he said.\r\n\r\nThe racial difficulties at the baseball fields in Washington Park had\r\ndoubtless never been brought to the attention of the representative of\r\nthe South Park Commission, because he cited these games as an example of\r\ngood feeling between the two races. He believed that there was never any\r\ndifficulty at the baseball fields, and that the white people who enjoyed\r\nthe Negro games would be the first to object if the Negroes were not\r\npermitted to play in the park. This opinion coincides with the situation\r\nat the ball fields observed by the investigator for the Commission, but\r\napparently there are occasional clashes here as in other parts of the\r\npark.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the South Park Commission did not think Negroes\r\nhesitated to use any of the facilities of the park because of fear of\r\nmistreatment in the park, though they might have some fear of being\r\nmistreated outside the park. He did not know that any difficulties have\r\never occurred at the boathouse, though a Negro doctor testified that\r\nhe had treated many Negro boys who had been assaulted there. The South\r\nPark representative said:\r\n\r\n     I have never known of any actual abuse of a colored patron\r\n     in any park to which I was personally assigned. I have known\r\n     people coming and going who were abused, mistreated, and\r\n     actually assaulted, outside the park reservations, but I don't\r\n     believe our records would show very many cases--probably no\r\n     more than occur where the Poles and the Irish get together,\r\n     or the Bohemians and the Germans.\r\n\r\nFights of a racial character were reported at one or two playgrounds.\r\nAt Franklin Playground, where fights among boys between ten and fourteen\r\nare frequent, the director said he was always especially careful to stop\r\na fight between a white and Negro boy because \"a race riot would be easy\r\nto start.\"\r\n\r\nAt Sherwood Playground Negro children do not use the playground after\r\nschool hours or during the summer. The attendant declared that \"things\r\nused to be mighty rough but are better now.\" The change may have been\r\ndue to a younger group of children replacing the former pupils, among\r\nwhom were many children fourteen to seventeen years of age. There was\r\nmuch fighting between Negroes and whites in the neighborhood of Sherwood\r\nPlayground, according to the attendant. Street fights were frequent,\r\noften ending in the use of knives or stones, and numerous arrests had\r\nbeen made. The fight usually started between two boys over some trivial\r\ndispute, a mixed crowd gathered, and the fight became general. Fights were\r\nalso frequent within the playground, the attendant said; sometimes as\r\nmany as three were going on at once. But a policeman had been stationed\r\nnear-by, and conditions were improving. The playground had no director\r\nat the time it was visited.\r\n\r\nAn example of objection to the first Negroes appearing in a park was\r\ngiven by an official of the Municipal Bureau:\r\n\r\n     I remember a particular instance at the Beutner Playground in\r\n     about 1903. Prior to that time we had very few colored people\r\n     in that vicinity. One evening a young colored boy, probably\r\n     seventeen or eighteen years of age, came in there. I happened\r\n     to be on the athletic field at that time. He came in the rear\r\n     gate, and the first thing I noticed there was quite a crowd of\r\n     white fellows chasing this fellow all over the field. He ran\r\n     down to where the Armory now stands, doubled, and came back\r\n     and got out of the gates.\r\n\r\nThis official said that after that incident there was little trouble\r\nbetween the races at the playground until about 1910, when the balance\r\nof the patronage became almost equal. He continued:\r\n\r\n     That was when the trouble started. There wasn't any preference\r\n     shown on the part of the park management to any particular\r\n     race, but it was the people outside. They absolutely took the\r\n     stand that as long as they could keep the colored people away\r\n     they were going to do it. They used every means they could\r\n     to keep the colored people away from Beutner Playground and\r\n     Armour Square.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of whites objecting to the use of recreation facilities\r\nfor the first time by Negroes was given by the representative of the\r\nWest Chicago Commission:\r\n\r\n     Not long ago, two colored men, for the first time in the\r\n     history of Garfield Park, came out there to play tennis.\r\n     Immediately somebody in the neighborhood called up the Park\r\n     Board and complained about Negroes breaking into Garfield\r\n     Park. We frankly told the people who were complaining that\r\n     they had equal rights to the use of the facilities at Garfield\r\n     Park. But it seemed that while we said nothing, the colored\r\n     gentlemen never appeared again to use the tennis facilities.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the South Park Commission in commenting on this\r\nsame point said:\r\n\r\n     There is a history of development in amicable race relations.\r\n     Most of the troublous conditions are where there is injected\r\n     for the first time the question of racial intermingling. Where\r\n     it is established, where it has gradually grown up, in time\r\n     there comes an adjustment.\r\n\r\nAt Armour Square individual Negroes have been accepted as \"part of the\r\nscheme,\" according to the representative of the South Park Commission,\r\npractically ever since the park was opened. But the director says that\r\nit is group action which stirs up trouble:\r\n\r\n     I think the trouble will adjust itself as the colored people\r\n     continue to come into the neighborhood, but we are in the\r\n     situation of having colored people come into the neighborhood\r\n     where there haven't been any before. I think it will adjust\r\n     itself in a year or so, and that possibly at that time colored\r\n     people will begin coming.\r\n\r\nThe head of the Municipal Bureau thought the difficulties arose, not\r\nwhen Negroes first entered a white neighborhood, but when a balance\r\nbetween the two races was struck, and it was a question which race was\r\ngoing to predominate. \"That has been my experience with the municipal\r\nplaygrounds,\" he said, citing the case of the Beutner Playground which\r\nthe Municipal Board decided to turn over to the Negroes.\r\n\r\nWhere Negroes are accepted and live amicably near white people, or where\r\nthere has not been enough influx of Negroes to arouse feeling against them\r\nthe contacts in the playground are usually peaceful. On the other hand,\r\nin communities where Negroes are looked on as intruders and objectionable\r\nneighbors, and where the white people are antagonistic, a contact between\r\na Negro and white child, which would normally be peaceful, will result\r\nin a disturbance and tend to increase existing antagonism. This is the\r\nsituation at Moseley and Sherwood playgrounds.\r\n\r\nAt Thirty-eighth Street Beach the prejudice is such as to prevent any\r\nNegro from bathing there, although it is as near the center of the main\r\nNegro area as the Twenty-sixth Street Beach, to which Negroes are expected\r\nto confine themselves. At Armour Square neighborhood sentiment permits\r\na few Negroes to use the park, but trouble starts if new groups come.\r\nAt Ogden Park a Negro playground director was assaulted by white boys\r\nand hit with brass knuckles in 1914, but now, according to a prominent\r\nNegro familiar with the situation at the center, there is order and fair\r\ntreatment both within the park and on the way to it, and the Negroes\r\nprefer to travel out there than to go to Washington Park, which is closer\r\nat hand, but where they may be attacked if they try to use a boat or\r\nmay be obliged to wait indefinitely for a tennis court.\r\n\r\nThe use of the parks by Negroes is determined almost entirely by the\r\ndegree of antagonism in the neighborhood, and Negroes are afraid to\r\nmake use of the parks where the neighborhood sentiment is hostile. \"The\r\nneighborhood condition pretty much governs the feeling of security, on\r\nthe basis of which the Negro will come in and use our park facilities,\"\r\nsaid the representative of the South Park Commission. \"Without feeling\r\nsecure in his neighborhood and in his access to the park, I don't think\r\nanything we could do would pull the Negro in.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A NEGRO AMATEUR BASEBALL TEAM]\r\n\r\nAt Mitchell Playground, in a district with a reputation for lawlessness,\r\nand at Seward Park, two blocks from a region known as \"Little Hell,\" no\r\nracial difficulty is reported.\r\n\r\nThe two causes of neighborhood antagonism most commonly cited were the\r\nreal estate and the sex problems. Among visitors to Washington Park\r\nthe real estate problem in the residence districts near the park seemed\r\nto be the primary cause of ill feeling. One of the property owners in\r\nthat region showed his feeling by complaining that the park ought to be\r\nrechristened \"Booker T. Washington Park.\" The figures in Table I indicate\r\nthat only about 10 per cent of the patrons of the park are Negroes.\r\n\r\nAn important point in considering neighborhood sentiment is whether\r\nthe white hoodlum who appears to be mainly responsible for the clashes\r\nwhich have taken place is a cause of neighborhood antagonism or whether\r\nhe merely reflects the attitude of the community. The fact that the\r\nhoodlum is permitted to terrorize and mistreat Negroes without serious\r\nprotest from whites is an indication that the hoodlum expresses what\r\nthe white community feels. The hoodlum does not always live, however,\r\nin the immediate neighborhood of the place of recreation where he makes\r\ntrouble. The gangs of white boys who come down to Twenty-ninth Street\r\nBeach and start trouble, for example, do not live near the beach, the\r\npoliceman in charge says, but over at Halsted Street. The director\r\nof Armour Square, though she stated that the feeling in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the park was responsible for keeping Negroes away from\r\nArmour Square, said that the boys who were active in starting trouble\r\nat the time of the 1919 riot came from west of the park, and that the\r\nboys in her vicinity tried to stop the others.\r\n\r\nThe head of the girls' work in the Municipal Bureau said:\r\n\r\n     It [hoodlumism] is a symptom, the reflection and logical\r\n     carrying out of an attitude widely accepted by the community as\r\n     a whole. Although a serious and troublesome symptom, I believe\r\n     it should be faced and welcomed as evidence of the potential\r\n     brutality of this attitude. Men and women of good standing\r\n     in white society condone much that they would hesitate to do\r\n     in person; and by their failure to protest prove themselves\r\n     equally responsible for results.\r\n\r\nThe director of Fuller Park believed that the groups of hoodlums mainly\r\nresponsible for keeping Negroes out of the parks were the athletic clubs\r\n\"composed usually of a bunch of young sports that are not athletes at\r\nall.\" \"These clubs, which have only about one athlete on the roster,\" he\r\nsaid, \"are so situated that the Negroes have to pass them going to and\r\nfrom the park. Those are the boys, numerous in every park neighborhood,\r\nwho are keeping the colored people out of the parks.\"\r\n\r\nThe director of Ogden Park took the part of a Negro boy set upon by a\r\nwhite gang during the 1919 riot and rescued by the police, though they\r\ndid not keep the mob from killing the Negro. He advocated the formation\r\nof \"square-deal\" clubs to defend innocent people from hoodlums. \"Members\r\nwould be bound to fight for the square deal--whites against white hoodlums\r\nand blacks against black hoodlums,\" he said. \"Until both races will act,\r\nthe lawless elements will continue to cause trouble.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible in some cases, such as those in which the \"athletic clubs\"\r\nare involved, to find out the identity of boys who molest Negroes, but,\r\naccording to the testimony of several park directors, it is absolutely\r\nimpossible to control these boys because the courts will not convict\r\nthem. The director of Armour Square stated:\r\n\r\n     I have had boys taken down to the courts time after time, and\r\n     now my policeman refuses to take them down to the court any\r\n     more, because he is reprimanded when he brings them in....\r\n     One of our attendants was shot through the lung and is now\r\n     absolutely incapacitated for work, and the policeman was\r\n     reprimanded because he had kept the boy in jail two nights.\r\n     When it came to trial, they had already seen somebody and the\r\n     policeman got the reprimand.\r\n\r\nThere was a general feeling among park representatives that the presence\r\nof a director with a proper attitude toward the problem was the greatest\r\nfactor in bringing about amicable relations within the park, but there was\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion as to whether the park management could\r\nor should attempt to influence the surrounding neighborhood. The West\r\nChicago Commission representative said that there was no instructor at\r\nUnion Park the first year it was open, and that considerable segregation\r\nand undesirable conduct on the part of both whites and Negroes resulted.\r\nSince then, there had always been a director in charge, and a very\r\nharmonious mingling of the two races had been brought about on the\r\nplayground. He believed that a similar relationship could be brought about\r\nwithin the recreation building by a director with the right personality,\r\nif adequate facilities were provided.\r\n\r\nThe Seward Park director did not consider it a proper function of a\r\nrecreation center to try to direct the community life outside it.\r\n\r\nThe director of Armour Square felt that she could do nothing to promote\r\nNegro activities there. She did not approve of the suggestion of turning\r\nover Armour Square to the Negroes as the best way of solving the problem.\r\nShe thought this would result in ill feeling and trouble, since there was\r\na well-established tradition that the whites should use Armour Square to\r\nthe fullest extent. But since the Negroes had no such recreation center\r\nas Armour Square available to them, she believed that a new center with\r\nfull equipment should be started in a neighborhood part white and part\r\nNegro with the understanding that it should be a Negro recreation center\r\nwhere the whites were welcome if they wished to come. She thought that\r\nwhite people would patronize such a recreation center and, with careful\r\nleadership, would mingle with the Negroes on friendly and peaceable terms.\r\n\r\nTwo recreation-center directors favored entirely separate recreational\r\nfacilities for Negroes with whites excluded. One of these was the director\r\nof Fuller Park, who told the Commission that he had made every effort to\r\nget Negroes to come to the park, and that he considered it part of his\r\nduty to go out into the neighborhood and try to get Negroes to use the\r\npark. \"Separate parks and playgrounds for colored people are advisable,\"\r\nhe said, \"not because one group is any better than the other, but because\r\nthey are different. Human nature will have to be remodeled before racial\r\nantipathy is overcome.\"\r\n\r\nThe director of Hardin Square, another recreation center little used by\r\nNegroes, though it is near the main Negro area, believed that separate\r\nfacilities for each race would be the best solution of the problem. He\r\ndid not encourage Negroes to come to Hardin Square. The policeman at\r\nthe park also believed that \"you can't make the two colors mix.\" This\r\npoliceman said he knows a group of young men in the district, mostly\r\nex-service men, who would \"procure arms and fight shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith me if a Negro should say one word back to me or should say a word\r\nto a white woman.\" He thought it would not take much to start another\r\nriot, and that the white people of the district would resolve to make a\r\n\"complete clean-up this time.\" This policeman is the one whose failure\r\nto arrest a white man accused of stoning the Negro boy, Williams, at\r\nthe Twenty-sixth Street Beach was an important factor in precipitating\r\nthe riot in 1919.\r\n\r\nThe director of Moseley Playground, who was born and raised in that\r\nvicinity, said there had been antagonism between the two races in that\r\nneighborhood for thirty years. He believed that separate recreation\r\nfacilities would be impracticable because the taxpayers could not be\r\ndivided in such a way that they would not be paying for fields their\r\nchildren could not use.\r\n\r\nThe director of Seward Park thought that it might be arranged in the\r\nsmall parks to give special hours to Negro groups. This would meet what\r\nhe believed to be the desire of the Negroes to be by themselves and also\r\nthe objection of the white girls who had protested against having Negro\r\ngirls in the same gymnasium classes with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. TRAINING FOR RECREATION DIRECTORS\r\n\r\nThe importance of the personality of the park director in determining the\r\nconditions in the park, which was often emphasized, led to a consideration\r\nof the training for the work--whether training was required that would\r\ndevelop the understanding and vision necessary to handle the problems\r\ninvolved in racial contacts. The representative of the Municipal Bureau\r\nsaid that every effort had been made to get trained men, but that there\r\nwas no school or curriculum of training that determined the efficiency\r\nof a person in charge. Some of his best directors had had no specific\r\ntraining, while some of the poorest came from the best recreational\r\ntraining schools.\r\n\r\nFew Negro instructors were found at the places of recreation and these\r\nwere employed by the Municipal Bureau. The representative of the West Side\r\nCommission said that he had been trying for a long time without success\r\nto get a Negro to take the civil-service examination for playground\r\ninstructors, as he was anxious to get a Negro for Union Park. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Lincoln and South Park commissions said that they\r\nused Negroes only as life guards, attendants, janitors, etc. The South\r\nPark Commission representative said the question of the desirability\r\nof having Negro instructors and play leaders had never come up, because\r\nno Negro had ever become a candidate for a position as a result of the\r\ncompetitive examinations.\r\n\r\n_Training opportunities for Negroes._--It was found that the Y.M.C.A.\r\nhas a four-year recreational training-course in which no distinction is\r\nmade between Negroes and whites. As the courses are not open to women,\r\nthe Y.M.C.A. has no such race problem as arises in recreation courses\r\nwhere women are admitted. The president of the graduating class at the\r\nY.M.C.A. College the year previous was a Negro, though the rest of the\r\nclass was composed entirely of whites. The number of Negroes taking the\r\nY.M.C.A. recreation course is relatively small, usually about two in a\r\nclass of 150.\r\n\r\nThe American College of Physical Education and the Chicago Normal School\r\nof Physical Education reported that they did not admit Negroes to any\r\ncourses, saying that their students would object to physical contact\r\nwith Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe Recreation Training School of Chicago, successor to the Recreation\r\nDepartment of the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, admits\r\nNegroes to the recreation course on the same terms as all other students\r\nand has trained several, both in the short courses and in the full year's\r\ncourse. This school admits both men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThough the Negro areas are as well supplied with ordinary playgrounds\r\nas the rest of the city, they are noticeably lacking in more complete\r\nrecreation centers with indoor facilities for the use of older children\r\nand adults. Several of these recreation centers, such as Hardin, Armour,\r\nand Fuller squares, Stanton and Ogden parks, border on Negro areas but\r\nare not used to any great extent by Negroes because the Negroes feel that\r\nthe whites object to their presence. Though there are three publicly\r\nmaintained beaches within the main Negro area the Negroes feel free to\r\nuse only the Twenty-sixth Street Beach, though many of them live as far\r\nsouth as Sixty-sixth Street. Where Negroes do not use nearby facilities\r\nto any great extent they have usually either been given to understand,\r\nthrough unofficial discrimination, that they are not desired, or they\r\nhave been terrorized by gangs of white boys. Few attempts to encourage\r\nNegro attendance have been made, and with the exception of Union Park\r\nthese attempts have failed.\r\n\r\nIn the main there seem to be no difficulties arising from contacts between\r\nyoung white and Negro children at the playgrounds, no matter whether\r\nthe playground is predominantly white or predominantly Negro, with the\r\nexception of one or two playgrounds, such as Sherwood and Moseley, which\r\nseem to share in traditional neighborhood antagonism between the two\r\nraces. Voluntary racial grouping at the playground was found only in\r\nrare instances and usually involved the older rather than the younger\r\nchildren. The swimming-pools, for example, are patronized more by older\r\nchildren, and voluntary racial grouping at swimming-pools was reported\r\nin several instances. In the ordinary playground sports and athletic\r\ncontests the two races mingle with the best of feeling.\r\n\r\nVoluntary racial groupings and serious clashes are found mainly at the\r\nplaces of recreation patronized by older children and adults--the large\r\nparks, beaches, and recreation centers. Trouble is usually started by\r\ngangs of white boys, organized and unorganized. The members of so-called\r\n\"athletic clubs,\" whose rooms usually border on the park, are the worst\r\noffenders in this respect. If they do not reflect the community feeling\r\nthey are at least tolerated by it, as nothing is done to suppress them.\r\nSome park authorities that have made sincere efforts to have these\r\nhoodlums punished are discouraged because they get no co-operation from\r\nthe courts, and the policeman who takes the boy to court gets a reprimand,\r\nwhile the boy is dismissed.\r\n\r\nAnother source of racial disorder is the lack of co-ordination between\r\npark and city police. The park police stop a fight between a white child\r\nand a Negro child and send them from the park. Outside the park gates\r\nthe children start fighting again, and the park police have no power to\r\ninterfere. The spectators may then get into the fight, dividing along\r\nracial lines, and before the city police can be summoned a race riot\r\nmay be well under way. Either city police should be stationed directly\r\noutside every park, ready to co-operate with the park police, or else\r\nthe jurisdiction of the park police should be extended to include the\r\narea immediately surrounding the park.\r\n\r\nThe most important remedies suggested to the Commission for the betterment\r\nof relations between Negroes and whites at the various places of\r\nrecreation were: (1) additional facilities in Negro areas, particularly\r\nrecreation centers which can be used by adults; (2) an awakened public\r\nopinion which will refuse longer to tolerate the hoodlum and will insist\r\nthat the courts properly punish such offenders; (3) selection of directors\r\nfor parks in neighborhoods where there is a critical situation who will\r\nhave a sympathetic understanding of the problem and will not tolerate\r\nactions by park police officers and other subordinate officials tending to\r\ndiscourage Negro attendance; and (4) efforts by such directors to repress\r\nand remove any racial antagonism that may arise in the neighborhood\r\nabout the park.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. CONTACTS IN TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n_Volume of traffic._--The number of passengers carried in 1916 in a\r\ntwenty-four-hour day by the Chicago surface lines was 3,500,000 and\r\nby the elevated railway lines 560,000, according to a tabulation made\r\nby the Chicago Traction and Subway Commission in 1916. With the city's\r\ngrowth in population the traffic in 1920 doubtless showed an even larger\r\nvolume. This traffic is distributed over approximately 1,050 miles of\r\nsurface and 142 miles of elevated track. It is most congested in the\r\n\"Loop\" area of the downtown business section, which is a transfer center\r\nfor the three sides of the city, North, South, and West; and of course\r\nit is heaviest at the hours when people go to and from work.\r\n\r\n_Concentration of Negro traffic._--Negroes constitute 4 per cent of\r\nthe city's population, according to the federal census for 1920, and\r\npresumably about that percentage of the city's street-car traffic.\r\nThe Negro traffic, however, instead of being scattered all over the\r\ncity, is mainly concentrated upon twelve lines which traverse the Negro\r\nresidence areas and connect them with the manufacturing districts where\r\nNegroes are largely employed. These twelve lines, which are shown on\r\nthe two transportation diagrams facing page 300, cover 11 per cent of\r\nthe total mileage of the surface and elevated lines. Because of this\r\nconcentration, however, the proportion of Negroes to whites on these\r\ntwelve lines is much higher than 4 per cent, and on such lines as that on\r\nState Street, which runs along the principal business street of the main\r\nSouth Side Negro residence area, it often happens that the majority of\r\nthe passengers are Negroes. In addition to these twelve lines of heaviest\r\nNegro traffic, there are others traversing less densely populated parts\r\nof Negro residence areas. In varying degrees contacts of Negroes and\r\nwhites may be found on other lines which serve the small proportion of\r\nthe Negro population scattered throughout the city.\r\n\r\nThe main area of Negro residence, on the South Side, where about 90 per\r\ncent of the Negroes in Chicago live, is traversed by the State Street,\r\nIndiana Avenue, Cottage Grove Avenue, Stony Island Avenue, and the South\r\nSide elevated lines, running north and south, and by eleven cross-town\r\nlines, running east and west, beginning with the Twenty-second Street\r\nline at the north and ending with the Seventy-first Street line at the\r\nsouth. From six to nine o'clock in the morning, and from four to six\r\no'clock in the afternoon, there is a heavy Negro traffic on the lines\r\ngoing north to the \"Loop,\" on the Cottage Grove Avenue line going south\r\nto the South Chicago manufacturing district, and on the Thirty-fifth\r\nStreet and Forty-seventh Street lines and the elevated branch line at\r\nFortieth Street going west to the Stock Yards. To reach the Stock Yards,\r\nNegro laborers must ride through a territory between Wentworth Avenue\r\nand Halsted Street in which, as shown in the sections of the report\r\ndealing with housing and with racial clashes, hostility toward Negroes\r\nhas often been displayed. This Negro traffic west of Wentworth Avenue\r\nis, therefore, chiefly confined to a few hours in the morning and the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe West Side Negro residence area is connected with the \"Loop\" by the\r\nMadison Street and Lake Street surface lines, and the elevated line on\r\nLake Street, and with the Stock Yards by the Halsted Street and Ashland\r\nAvenue lines.\r\n\r\nThe North Side Negro residence area is connected with the \"Loop\" by\r\nthe lines on State and Clark streets and by the Northwestern elevated\r\nlines. Contacts on these lines, however, are not as important as on\r\nthe lines serving the South and West Side areas, because the number of\r\nNegroes involved is only about 1,500, or less than 2 per cent of the\r\nNegro population.\r\n\r\n_Contacts and racial attitudes._--As in other northern cities, there is\r\nno \"Jim Crow\" separation of the races on street cars in Chicago. The\r\ncontacts of Negroes and whites on the street cars never provoked any\r\nconsiderable discussion until the period of Negro migration from the\r\nSouth, when occasional stories of clashes began to be circulated, but\r\nonly one such incident was reported in the newspapers. Even since the\r\nmigration began there have been few complaints based upon racial friction\r\nin transportation contacts.\r\n\r\nIn response to inquiries, the South Side Elevated Company, which has the\r\nlargest Negro traffic of any elevated line, replied that except during\r\nthe riot in 1919, when a few cases of racial disorder were reported,\r\nthere had been no complaints from motormen or trainmen since 1918, when\r\na trainman was cut by a Negro but not seriously injured. No complaints\r\nfrom white passengers had been received since the spring of 1917, when\r\nwhite office workers objected to riding with Stock Yards laborers,\r\nmainly Negroes, on the Stock Yards spur of the elevated. White laborers\r\nin the Stock Yards mostly lived within walking distance of their work,\r\nbut Negroes found it necessary to use car lines running east to the main\r\nNegro-residence area. The Chicago Surface Lines replied that complaints\r\ndue to racial friction were negligible.\r\n\r\nInformation obtained by investigators for the Commission showed that\r\nthe attitude of Negroes and whites toward each other was being affected\r\nby contacts on the cars. A white woman in the Hyde Park district, an\r\nofficer of the Illinois Federation of Woman's Clubs, when interviewed\r\nupon race relations, made special reference to transportation contacts.\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n     While Negroes are coming into this neighborhood, especially\r\n     on Lake Park, I see little of them, except on the street car.\r\n     There I must say I have a decided opinion. Just last evening\r\n     around five o'clock, I took a Lake Park car at Fortieth Street\r\n     and Cottage Grove Avenue, and several colored men saw to it\r\n     that they were first to board the car. I had to sit near the\r\n     front and a great big Negro man sat next to me, smoking a cigar\r\n     right in the car. I told my husband when I got home, I was for\r\n     moving them all out of the city, and I never felt like that\r\n     toward them until just of late. There's a feeling of resentment\r\n     among us white people toward the colored people on the cars,\r\n     and they feel that, and they feel the same resentment toward\r\n     us. I think I see that very plainly. Last night, on this same\r\n     car, a colored man was hanging over me, and I know he didn't\r\n     want me there near him, any more than I wanted him.\r\n\r\nAs a factor in attitudes on race relations, transportation contacts,\r\nwhile impersonal and temporary, are significant for several reasons.\r\nIn the first place, many whites have no contact with Negroes except on\r\nthe cars, and their personal impressions of the entire Negro group may\r\nbe determined by one or two observations of Negro passengers. Secondly,\r\ntransportation contacts are not supervised, as are contacts in the school,\r\nthe playground, and the workshop. If there is a dispute between passengers\r\nover a seat it usually rests with the passengers themselves to come to\r\nan understanding. Any feeling of suspicion or prejudice on either side\r\nbecause of the difference in race accentuates any such misunderstanding.\r\nIn the third place, transportation contacts, at least on crowded cars,\r\ninvolve a degree of physical contact between Negroes and whites which\r\nrarely occurs under other circumstances, and which sometimes leads to\r\na display of racial feeling.\r\n\r\n_Scope and method of investigation._--In obtaining information as to\r\ntransportation contacts the Commission's investigators, both white and\r\nNegro, men and women, made many observation trips on the twelve lines\r\ncarrying the heaviest volume of Negro traffic and therefore involving\r\nthe greatest amount of contact. Counts of passengers, Negro and white,\r\nwere made, behavior and habits were noted, passengers and car crews were\r\nquestioned, and officials of the surface and elevated lines, starters,\r\nand station men were interviewed.\r\n\r\nSuperintendents of 123 industrial plants were interviewed to ascertain\r\nthe numbers of whites and Negroes employed in offices and in plants,\r\ntransportation lines used by workers, nature of work and its effect upon\r\ncleanliness of person and clothing, provision of baths, etc. A further\r\nsource of information was a report made for the officers of the Central\r\nManufacturing District, setting forth the transportation facilities\r\nfor the 12,000 employees of the district and providing data drawn from\r\nquestionnaires filled out by these employees. The district includes the\r\narea from Thirty-fifth to Forty-third streets and from Morgan to Robey\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DISTRIBUTION OF NEGRO TRAFFIC\r\n\r\nNegro traffic is fairly continuous throughout the day in the Negro\r\nresidence areas, and the proportion of Negroes and whites is about the\r\nsame at different hours of the day. Except during the times of going to\r\nand from work the cars are not overcrowded, and the danger of friction\r\nis therefore small. On the routes connecting the Negro residence areas\r\nwith the Stock Yards and with South Chicago, where many Negroes are\r\nemployed in steel plants, the Negro traffic is confined to a few hours\r\nin the morning and late afternoon, but at these hours the cars are very\r\ncrowded. There is much rushing to board cars and get seats, and white\r\noffice workers and other non-laborers are thrown into contact with Negro\r\nlaborers still in their working clothes. It is under such circumstances\r\nthat irritation and actual clashes are most likely to arise. It should be\r\nnoted that similar contacts with white laborers in their working clothes\r\nare disagreeable in the same ways, though in such cases the odors and\r\ngrime are not associated with race and color.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TRANSPORTATION CONTACTS\r\n   MORNING TRAFFIC 7 TO 9 O'CLOCK FROM HOME TO WORK]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TRANSPORTATION CONTACTS\r\n   AFTERNOON TRAFFIC--4 TO 6 O'CLOCK FROM WORK TO HOME]\r\n\r\nThe hours of greatest general travel and car crowding were found to be\r\nfrom six to nine o'clock in the morning and from four to six o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of whites and Negroes on lines carrying the largest\r\nnumbers of Negroes to and from work are shown in two diagrams. These\r\nare based on counts of white and Negro passengers, several trips being\r\naveraged to show typical car loads during the heavy travel of early\r\nmorning and late afternoon. The first diagram shows the proportions in\r\ntravel from the Negro residence areas of the South and West sides toward\r\nthe Stock Yards, the other large industries employing Negroes, and\r\nthe \"Loop\" district during the period from six to nine A.M. The second\r\ndiagram shows the proportions in travel from the Stock Yards, the other\r\nindustries, and the \"Loop\" toward the Negro residence areas of the South\r\nand West sides during the period from four to six P.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CONDUCT RESULTING FROM CONTACTS\r\n\r\nAs already noted, contacts of Negroes and whites on street cars provoked\r\nlittle discussion until the migration of Negroes from the South began to\r\nbe felt. The great majority of the migrants are laborers. Many of them\r\nare ignorant and rough mannered, entirely unfamiliar with standards of\r\nconduct in northern cities. It is this type which is meant in references\r\nhereinafter to the \"migration\" or \"southern\" Negro.\r\n\r\nComing to a city like Chicago, with no \"Jim Crow\" racial segregation,\r\nwas a new experience to many southern Negroes. They felt strange and\r\nuncertain as to how they should act. Many whites and Negroes long\r\nresident in Chicago have said that they could tell a migration Negro by\r\nhis ill-at-ease manner and often by his clothes.\r\n\r\nThe conspicuous points in the behavior of the migration Negro before he\r\nbecame urbanized were his \"loud laughing and talking,\" his \"ill-smelling\r\nclothes,\" his \"roughness,\" and his tendency to \"sit all over the car.\"\r\nThese are easier to understand when one considers the background of the\r\nsouthern Negro.\r\n\r\nFew white people realized how uncertain the southern Negro felt about\r\nmaking use of his new privilege of sitting anywhere in the car, instead\r\nof being \"Jim Crowed.\" One Negro woman who came to the city during\r\nthe migration said, when she was asked about her first impression of\r\nChicago: \"When I got here and got on the street cars and saw colored\r\npeople sitting by white people, I just held my breath, for I thought any\r\nminute they would start something. Then I saw nobody noticed it, and I\r\njust thought this is a real place for Negroes.\" There were exceptional\r\ncases in which southern Negroes walked miles, rather than take a car.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange in view of such uncertainty of mind and timidity\r\nthat the most noticeable point of behavior of the southern Negro was\r\nloud talking, joking, and laughter. The South Side Elevated Company,\r\nreplying to the Commission's inquiries, said: \"These colored people are\r\nof a happy-go-lucky type and are often noisy, especially when two or\r\nmore acquaintances meet on the trains or station platforms or crossing\r\nfrom one side of the station to the other. They laugh and talk a good\r\ndeal and seem to be happy and care-free.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough some of this boisterousness was no doubt due to a care-free\r\nspirit and a broad good humor, some of it had quite a different source.\r\nMany a southern Negro thinks that the whites like him to be \"typical,\"\r\nand that they will tolerate him as long as his dialect, his wit, and\r\nhis manner are amusing enough. A Negro newspaper of Chicago took the\r\nsouthern Negroes to task for using this safety device in Chicago.\r\n\r\nMany whites, clerical workers, shoppers, and others of a non-laboring\r\ntype, have expressed objections to what they term a tendency of Negroes\r\nto \"sit all over the cars,\" meaning to sit anywhere in the car. This was\r\nmost conspicuous when whites had to ride in the morning on a car which\r\nhad come from one of the Negro residence areas and was already filled\r\nwith Negroes, or when Negroes and whites were boarding a comparatively\r\nempty car near one of the big industrial plants in the afternoon. The\r\nemployment manager of the Corn Products Company plant at Argo reported\r\na complaint about this tendency made to him by one of the girls in the\r\noffice:\r\n\r\n     An office girl told me she had trouble getting a seat on the\r\n     cars. She was not able to get a seat by herself and did not\r\n     want to sit next to a Negro. She said that Negroes would rush\r\n     in and get all the seats by the windows. She thought they\r\n     did it more to tease the office help than anything else. This\r\n     girl was undoubtedly prejudiced. That was one of her arguments\r\n     to explain why she had difficulty in getting to work in the\r\n     morning. She is a St. Louis girl of Flemish extraction.\r\n\r\nMany of the southern Negroes were found to be very hesitant about taking\r\nseats next to whites. The southern tradition was so ingrained in them\r\nthat they tried to be as inconspicuous as possible. On the other hand,\r\nsome, with the sudden removal of the restraints of the South, used their\r\nnew freedom without thought of the effect of their behavior on Chicago\r\nwhites and Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of migration Negroes was sometimes expressed to the\r\nCommission's investigators. For example:\r\n\r\n     You can spend your money as you please, live better and get\r\n     more enjoyment out of it--I mean go where you please, without\r\n     being Jim-Crowed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     There's no lynching or Jim Crow. You can vote, you receive\r\n     better treatment and more money for your work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The freedom of speech and action. You can live without fear\r\n     and there's no Jim Crow.\r\n\r\nSome southern Negroes apparently came to Chicago with a real grudge\r\nagainst all whites and ready at slight provocation to display their\r\nresentment. The minister of one of the Negro churches in Chicago said:\r\n\r\n     After years of restriction and proscription to which they were\r\n     subjected in the South, they suddenly find themselves freed in\r\n     a large measure of these conditions. Their mind harks back to\r\n     that which they endured at the hands of members of the Aryan\r\n     race in the South, and they grow resentful, and in the midst\r\n     of their new environment they vent their spleen. One has but\r\n     to ride on any of the surface lines running into the section\r\n     of Chicago largely occupied by my race group to be convinced\r\n     of the facts mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe southern Negro who got into trouble with whites by insisting on\r\nhis right to a seat sometimes belonged to the class of suspicious\r\nand sensitive Negroes, and sometimes he was simply a \"greenhorn.\" The\r\nfollowing cases show how \"green\" the migration Negro could be, and how\r\neasy it was for him to make himself disliked and ridiculous. The first\r\ncase was observed by a Negro man, the second by a Negro woman, both long\r\nresident in Chicago:\r\n\r\n     I boarded a crowded car in the \"Loop\" going south and was forced\r\n     to stand near the rear door. There are two lengthwise seats\r\n     at the rear of the car, one of which will hold three people\r\n     and one of which will hold two. Two colored women, carelessly\r\n     dressed and holding greasy paper bundles in their hands, got\r\n     on the car at Twelfth Street and stood in the back of the\r\n     car hanging on to straps. They rode this way until Eighteenth\r\n     Street, when one of them, a large woman, noticing that there\r\n     were three white people on one of the seats and only two on\r\n     the other said to her companion, \"If three folks can sit on\r\n     that seat, I ain't going to stand over these white folks, who\r\n     are just like they are down South, and don't want you to sit\r\n     down. I'm going to sit down myself.\" She then inserted herself\r\n     between the two white women, one of whom was pushed to the\r\n     floor. The Negro woman was much embarrassed, but I don't think\r\n     she has yet realized that the seats were of different lengths.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I was on a State Street car when two southern Negro women got\r\n     on, talking loud, and throwing themselves around loose and\r\n     careless like. I was sitting on one of the end seats, just\r\n     big enough for three, and one of the women says to the other,\r\n     \"Here's a seat, here's a seat.\" \"You move over,\" she said to\r\n     me. There was fire in their eyes, and I don't like fighting,\r\n     so I made up my mind that if they started anything I'd get up\r\n     and give them my seat. Most people would have understood how\r\n     you felt if you did that, but I am not sure they would have\r\n     understood. I said to one of them, \"There really isn't room on\r\n     this seat.\" She gave me a shove, so I said, \"But I'll get up\r\n     and give you my seat.\" You wouldn't believe what happened then.\r\n     The conductor came in and said, \"You just keep your seat.\"\r\n     And a white man, who was sitting in one of the cross-seats,\r\n     turned around and said, \"I'll see that she does.\"\r\n\r\nSoiled and ill-smelling clothes were a large factor in making Negro\r\nworkingmen objectionable to many whites even of the same working class.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the migration, in the fall of 1916 and the spring of 1917,\r\nthe Stock Yards were taking on hundreds of Negro laborers to increase\r\ntheir war-time production, and these new hands, most of them migration\r\nNegroes, rode to and from work with white office workers. How the white\r\noffice workers felt about it is shown by a statement of a white woman\r\nclerk in the Stock Yards:\r\n\r\n     Some of the Negroes on the Thirty-fifth Street car are very\r\n     rough. Most of them work out at the Stock Yards and the smell\r\n     of the Yards is very bad. They seem to try to clean up, but\r\n     the smell is there, especially in cold weather when the cars\r\n     are closed. I would suggest that they run special cars from\r\n     the Stock Yards for those people, and that would leave enough\r\n     cars for us and we wouldn't get the odor either.\r\n\r\nThis situation was somewhat remedied by the fact that most of the Negro\r\nlaborers at least changed their clothes before going home, even if they\r\ncould not entirely rid themselves of the Stock Yards odor; also the hours\r\nfor Stock Yards employees were so arranged that the office workers came\r\nto work later and left later than the white and Negro laborers.\r\n\r\nThe Negro press of Chicago tried to make the migration Negro realize\r\nhow the odor attaching to his clothes was affecting public opinion. The\r\n_Chicago Searchlight_ of May 22, 1920, had this exhortation by the editor:\r\n\r\n     Did you ever get on the elevated train at Indiana Avenue about\r\n     5:30 o'clock in the afternoon, and meet the \"gang\" from the\r\n     Stock Yards? It would make you ashamed to see men and women\r\n     getting on the cars with greasy overalls on and dirty dresses\r\n     in this enlightened age. There is really no excuse for such a\r\n     condition to exist. There is plenty of soap and water in the\r\n     Stock Yards and you have better clothes in your homes. Why not\r\n     take a suit to the yards and wash up and change your clothing,\r\n     before attempting to mingle with men and women, many of them\r\n     being dressed for theaters and club parties, etc.? Don't you\r\n     know that you are forcing on us here in Chicago a condition\r\n     similar to the one down South?\r\n\r\nIn order to find out whether Negroes working in other plants than\r\nthe Stock Yards do work which leaves the worker soiled and smelling,\r\nsuperintendents or foremen were questioned. It was learned that much\r\nother work done by Negro laborers leaves oil, grease, and acid stains,\r\nthat many of the plants have no baths or adequate facilities for washing,\r\nand that sometimes where there are such facilities they are not kept in\r\norder. Three-fourths of the superintendents and foremen interviewed had\r\nthe impression that Negroes were more careful about bathing and changing\r\ntheir clothes than whites. They said the difference was probably due\r\neither to the fact that the white laborer who was doing the same class\r\nof work as the Negro, was an immigrant, or to the fact that the white\r\nlaborer often lived near the plant where he works, and preferred to wash\r\nup at home.\r\n\r\nThe Negro laborer meets little objection when he is riding with white\r\nlaborers; it is when he comes in contact with whites of a non-laboring\r\nclass that there is the most likelihood of trouble. Such whites often\r\nfind white laborers quite as objectionable. A lawyer in Indiana Harbor\r\nwho was questioned about the transportation contacts in the Calumet\r\nindustrial district, said:\r\n\r\n     So far as transportation is concerned, little trouble need\r\n     be expected. Most of the people here are working people, and\r\n     they know what to expect when a dirty workman comes and sits\r\n     down next to them. The fact of it is that if there is any\r\n     complaint to be made, it would be against the foreigners. In\r\n     the winter, when the doors are closed, the smell of garlic is\r\n     almost unbearable.\r\n\r\nAnother complaint from whites is that Negroes on the street cars are\r\n\"rough.\" It is significant, however, that all the incidents related to\r\nthe Commission in regard to \"roughness\" occurred on crowded cars. The\r\nrush to get on a car before or after working hours is often heavy. The\r\nCommission's investigator, describing the loading of cars at an important\r\ntransfer point near the Stock Yards at the evening rush hour, said:\r\n\r\n     I observed the loading and transfers at Ashland and\r\n     Forty-seventh from three to four o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n     With the possible exception of six to seven in the morning\r\n     the traffic is heaviest at this time. The transfers from the\r\n     Ashland to the Forty-seventh Street car are mostly Negroes\r\n     from the government plants at Thirty-ninth and Robey. About 40\r\n     per cent of them are women. Cars going east on Forty-seventh\r\n     Street leave every five minutes. There is a supervisor on this\r\n     corner, whose duty it apparently is to supervise the arrival\r\n     and departure of cars. He pays no attention, however, to the\r\n     matter of loading. Usually the men meet the car in the middle\r\n     of the block and climb on while it is moving. By the time the\r\n     car reaches the corner the seats are all taken and the doorway\r\n     is congested. The women, like the men, get on as they can. No\r\n     deference is shown them. Most of those who get on this car are\r\n     colored, and most of them, colored and white alike, are workmen.\r\n\r\nSome friction between whites and Negroes has occurred during the boarding\r\nof cars. It may be caused by general racial attitude as well as by the\r\ncircumstances of the particular case. The following cases were both\r\nrelated by white men, one an assistant superintendent in a foundry, and\r\nthe other a barber:\r\n\r\n     One of our employees (Negro) in running to catch a car\r\n     accidentally knocked over a white man. The white man became\r\n     particularly abusive, and the crowd joined in with him. The\r\n     crowd attempted to beat the Negro up, but he ran back to the\r\n     plant here for protection and we quieted them down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I remember one time about three years ago, I was coming home\r\n     on the Forty-seventh Street car and two Negroes were standing\r\n     on the back. It was pretty crowded. A man swung his wife on\r\n     board, and two more white men jumped on too. He got her through\r\n     into the car, and one of the Negroes said to her: \"I'm going\r\n     to get that husband of yours.\" I went up and stood in back\r\n     of the white man and told him I'd stand by him, if anything\r\n     happened. There were lots of whites on the car but about half\r\n     Negroes, I guess. I think the Negroes have too much freedom.\r\n     They don't know how to act. Some of those Negroes on the street\r\n     car are real uncivilized.\r\n\r\nThe South Side Elevated Company, in answer to a questionnaire said:\r\n\"It requires constant watching to prevent Negroes from entering and\r\nleaving cars through the windows.\" The following incident, reported by\r\nthe Commission's investigator, who traveled over all the lines used by\r\nNegroes, shows that both whites and Negroes may climb through the windows\r\nunder the same conditions of crowding:\r\n\r\n     I was transferring from the Argo car to the Sixty-third Street\r\n     car with a number of white and Negro workmen from the Corn\r\n     Products Refining Company. The crowd rushed for the door,\r\n     and the doorway soon became congested. Two white men climbed\r\n     in the car through the back window, followed immediately by\r\n     a Negro. When the conductor came up, a white woman, who was\r\n     standing next to me and had seen the whole performance, said\r\n     to the conductor, indicating the Negro, who had climbed in\r\n     through the window: \"I wouldn't take his fare, if I were you.\r\n     He came in through the window.\"\r\n\r\nSelection of seats by white and Negro passengers often provides instances\r\nof conduct which is based on racial prejudices. These seem to be most\r\nfrequent on lines with comparatively light travel by Negroes and where\r\nthere is thus less opportunity for the races to become accustomed to\r\ncontact. Sometimes whites show plainly their avoidance of Negroes.\r\n\r\nSome Negroes have timidly offered their seats to women standing, and\r\nhave been chagrined by the refusal of the white women to accept the\r\ncourtesy. The superintendent of one of the plants where Negroes work\r\nmade the following comment:\r\n\r\n     Negroes seemingly refrain from showing courtesy to white women,\r\n     such as offering them their seats, because of two facts. Either\r\n     the woman to whom the courtesy was extended, or outsiders, seem\r\n     to the Negro to place a wrong construction upon his courtesy.\r\n     They think him either fresh or servile, and in the majority of\r\n     cases where a Negro would extend such courtesies, he refrains\r\n     from doing so.\r\n\r\nA few Negroes justified themselves by pointing out that white men did\r\nnot give up their seats for Negro women, and so they did not intend to\r\ngive up their seats for white women. The editor of a Negro newspaper\r\ntook Negro men to task for their disregard of white women and also women\r\nof their own race, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Do you know that there is a growing tendency among the young\r\n     men of our race to show disrespect for our womanhood? If\r\n     you don't think so, just get on a street car or visit public\r\n     amusement places, or even notice their actions as they walk\r\n     along the street. It is nothing to see hundreds of big strong\r\n     young men sitting on our cars, while women stand until they\r\n     become almost exhausted, while those \"fellows\" sit and read\r\n     their papers or gaze out of the car windows.\r\n\r\n     There is one trait, and I might say only one, that I take off\r\n     my hat to the southern \"Cracker\" for, and that is his respect\r\n     and high regard for women. While he hasn't any for the other\r\n     fellow's [the Negro's] wives and daughters, yet he respects\r\n     his own. We must set a good example for him and respect all\r\n     women, regardless of race, color, or creed. Then you will win\r\n     the admiration of all civilized people. Men who do not respect\r\n     and honor their women are not worthy of citizenship. Do you\r\n     get me, brother?\r\n\r\nWhite men have become much incensed when they have given seats to white\r\nwomen, and Negro men, not realizing what had happened, took the seats.\r\nThe timekeeper at a large industrial plant said:\r\n\r\n     I was on an East Chicago Whiting car. Six Negro workmen were\r\n     standing. The car was full about one-third with Negroes. A\r\n     man got up to let a white woman sit down. A Negro, seeing the\r\n     seat vacated, sat down before the woman had a chance to get\r\n     to it. The man who had proffered the seat became indignant,\r\n     cursed the Negro, yanked him out of his seat, and proceeded\r\n     to beat him up. The Negro drew out a knife. About this time,\r\n     it became a general race clash. One of the Negro workmen had\r\n     a gun: he pulled it out of his pocket and cleaned out the car.\r\n\r\nThe following incidents were reported by two white investigators:\r\n\r\n     I was on a Cottage Grove Avenue car at 5:30 P.M. The car was\r\n     crowded, about one-third colored people. A young, well-dressed\r\n     colored boy of about twenty was standing in the aisle beside\r\n     a white man and a white woman. The seat directly in front of\r\n     this colored boy was vacated, and the white man made a move\r\n     to seize it, but the boy by holding his arm on the back of\r\n     the seat barred the white man's way and stepped aside to allow\r\n     the woman to sit down. The woman nodded her thanks to the boy,\r\n     and the white man went on reading his paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I was on an eastbound Oak Park elevated train at about 10:30\r\n     A.M. Several Pullman porters got on at Campbell Avenue and had\r\n     to stand, as did several white women and men. As the crowd\r\n     began to thin out, I noticed that the white men were apt to\r\n     drop into a vacant seat themselves, while the Negro porters\r\n     were careful to wait until the women sat down before they took\r\n     advantage of any vacant seats.\r\n\r\nA white woman in the Hyde Park district said to one of the investigators:\r\n\r\n     On the street cars I would rather ride with Negro gentlemen\r\n     than with many of our so-called white gentlemen. A Negro man\r\n     who has the slightest training is courteous and genuinely so.\r\n     My children use the street car every day to go to the Hyde Park\r\n     High School, and it's not the Negro men on the street cars\r\n     I hate to think of; it's the cheap white men. A very rough\r\n     element of whites congregate every night on Lake Park near\r\n     Fifty-first Street--hoodlums that the colored people living\r\n     there must fear.\r\n\r\nNo case of attempted familiarity by a Negro man toward a white woman on\r\nthe street cars was reported to the Commission. Cases were reported,\r\nhowever, of accidental contacts between Negro men and white women\r\nwhich might easily have been misunderstood, but which seemed to the\r\ninvestigator, a white woman, to be due to the clumsiness of southern\r\nrural Negroes in crowded cars. Two such cases follow:\r\n\r\n     I was on a Madison car going west. A number of Negroes got on\r\n     at the Northwestern Station. The car was crowded, and I felt\r\n     someone in the aisle leaning heavily against my shoulder. I\r\n     was very much annoyed and glanced up. I saw that the man was\r\n     a Negro about twenty years old. He was with a girl, obviously\r\n     his sister, who was also standing in the aisle. They both had\r\n     childlike faces, and I could see that he was quite unaware\r\n     that he was leaning against me. I didn't say anything, as the\r\n     car was really crowded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I was in the aisle seat of an Illinois Central suburban car\r\n     about 5:00 P.M., waiting for the train to start. A Negro man\r\n     standing in the aisle next to me suddenly leaned against my\r\n     shoulder so hard that it hurt. I looked up at him resentfully\r\n     but he didn't notice me. He looked as though he had been picked\r\n     up in a little western town and dumped down in a city for the\r\n     first time. He had a wide western hat on, and his face was\r\n     lean and weatherbeaten. I take it he was about fifty years\r\n     old. He was in animated conversation with a woman in a seat\r\n     behind me. This woman had many bundles. Apparently they wanted\r\n     to find seats together. Soon another man joined them who had\r\n     been scouting for seats in the car ahead, and they all set out\r\n     together for another car. They were so concentrated on this\r\n     problem of getting a seat that they didn't know there was anyone\r\n     else in the car. They lunged down the aisle knocking against\r\n     people as they went along, but no one paid any particular\r\n     attention to them.\r\n\r\nAnother case of accidental contact, showing an attitude of suspicion on\r\nthe part of a white woman, was reported by a Negro Y.M.C.A. secretary:\r\n\r\n     I was on a street car going west through the \"Loop\" on Madison\r\n     Street. A colored man, apparently a workman, was sitting across\r\n     the aisle from me, looking out of the window, with his left\r\n     arm stretched along the back of the seat. A white woman came\r\n     in, glanced at the vacant seat beside me, and sat down beside\r\n     the colored man across the aisle. He looked around and saw\r\n     the woman sitting in the seat, and apparently was confused. He\r\n     attempted to remove his arm, and in doing so his arm brushed\r\n     across the woman's shoulder. She got right up and exclaimed:\r\n     \"How dare you put your arm around me?\" The man looked at her\r\n     dumbly, his face the picture of excitement and wonder. I said\r\n     to the lady, \"I was watching this man and he was honestly\r\n     trying to remove his arm from the back of the seat. I think\r\n     he was more surprised to find you there than anything else,\r\n     and the whole thing was sheer accident.\" She wanted to know\r\n     what I had to do with it, and I simply said I wouldn't like\r\n     to see a matter of that kind misunderstood. She resumed her\r\n     seat beside the colored man and nothing further happened.\r\n\r\nMany cases of improper advances by white men toward Negro women were\r\nreported to the Commission by Negro women, well known to the Commission,\r\nwhose character is beyond question. The following are typical:\r\n\r\n     Going south on a State Street car to Fifty-third Street, I\r\n     noticed a man in the aisle staring at me. He kept moving down\r\n     nearer and nearer to my seat and sat down in front of me. He\r\n     handed me a note written on a scrap of newspaper. I opened it\r\n     because I was curious to know what his motive was. He was a\r\n     young man, in his twenties, and well dressed. He had written\r\n     down his name and telephone number and the words: \"Call me\r\n     for a date.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I remember one man especially, because I used to ride downtown\r\n     on the same car he took every morning. The first time I ever\r\n     saw him, he stared at me a great deal and when I got off the\r\n     car, he got off too. As he got off he said to me, \"Don't take\r\n     that car, wait for the other one.\" I noticed then that he\r\n     went over to the corner and took a car going in the opposite\r\n     direction from mine. I saw him lots of times after that, and\r\n     he always got just as close as he could and stared. I always\r\n     arranged it so that he could not sit next to me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I was on the elevated with a friend the other day. We were\r\n     sitting on end seats. A man got up to give a white woman his\r\n     seat and then came over and stood close to us. He stood with\r\n     his legs against my friend's knees, until she jerked around\r\n     and sat facing me. Then he tried standing close to me. He had\r\n     me so hedged in I could hardly move, and I had to make a very\r\n     abrupt movement to get away. He moved on after a while.\r\n\r\nWhat may be done to prevent misunderstanding and check in its incipiency\r\ntrouble which might easily and suddenly become serious, is illustrated\r\nin the action of a white woman, a resident of the Chicago Commons Social\r\nSettlement:\r\n\r\n     One evening, soon after the race riot in July, 1919, I was\r\n     riding on a State Street car, going south from Grand Avenue. I\r\n     had only ridden a block, when there was a general stir in the\r\n     car, a young woman fainted, and I learned that the conductor\r\n     had been struck and his cap knocked off. Word went around\r\n     the car that a \"nigger\" did it. Ugly remarks were being made\r\n     and I feared there would be trouble. I stepped to the back of\r\n     the car and asked two colored women if they knew who struck\r\n     the conductor. One said, \"He looked like a colored man,\" the\r\n     other said, \"I don't know.\" Then I asked the conductor, in a\r\n     voice loud enough so that the rest of the car could hear me,\r\n     whether it was a white or a black man that struck him and why.\r\n     He said: \"It was a white man. I wouldn't let him bring his\r\n     big drum on the platform, it was too crowded.\" Having learned\r\n     this, I turned to two young couples who were still showing\r\n     much feeling and said, \"A white man struck the conductor.\"\r\n     The whole car then quieted down, and there was no more feeling.\r\n\r\nMost of the difficulties in transportation contacts reported and generally\r\ncomplained of seem to have centered around the first blundering efforts\r\nof migrants to adjust themselves to northern city life. The efforts of\r\nagencies interested in assisting this adjustment, together with the Negro\r\npress, and the intimate criticisms and suggestion for proper conduct\r\nof Chicago Negroes, have smoothed down many of the roughnesses of the\r\nmigrants, and as a result friction from contact in transportation seems\r\nto have lessened materially.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. CONTACTS IN OTHER RELATIONS\r\n\r\nHere are included:\r\n\r\nI. Contacts in public places, such as restaurants, department stores,\r\ntheaters, and personal-service places.\r\n\r\nII. \"Black and tan\" resorts, which present a much-criticized association\r\nbecause of the vicious elements of whites and Negroes in contact there.\r\n\r\nIII. Cultural contacts which indicate associations on a purely\r\nintellectual basis.\r\n\r\nIV. Contacts in co-operative efforts for race betterment, which includes\r\nmost of the social organizations working among Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CONTACTS IN PUBLIC PLACES\r\n\r\nOn the street, in public conveyances, stores, restaurants, and commercial\r\nplaces of amusement, contacts of races and nationalities are unavoidable\r\nand have not the supervision that is common in schools or even public\r\namusement places.\r\n\r\nWhere large numbers of Negroes live there are theaters, restaurants,\r\nstores, barber shops, and personal-service places, which are used by\r\nNegroes in the proportion in which they predominate in the population\r\nof the area. In any or all of these places, however, white persons are\r\nserved.\r\n\r\nThe business district along State Street between Twenty-sixth and\r\nForty-seventh, and on the car-line cross-streets, is maintained partly\r\nby, and largely for, the Negro residents in the general neighborhood.\r\nSince, however, about 50 per cent of the population is white, there are\r\npersonal-service places which are used almost exclusively by whites.\r\nBarber shops are wholly exclusive, and several restaurants attempt to\r\nmake themselves so. For example:\r\n\r\n     At Thirty-first Street and Indiana Avenue, in the heart of\r\n     the Negro residence area, a restaurant proprietor maintains\r\n     an L-shaped establishment. Fronting on Thirty-first Street is\r\n     a neatly arranged and well-kept dining-room, with tables for\r\n     ladies, and a lunch counter with white waiters. Fronting on\r\n     Indiana Avenue is a narrow, dark dining-room, with a counter\r\n     served by colored waitresses. It is not kept neatly, and is not\r\n     so well supplied. Both dining-rooms are served from the kitchen\r\n     in the corner of the L, and patrons in either dining-room would\r\n     never suspect that there were two dining-rooms with connection\r\n     through this kitchen. At the time of the investigation, the\r\n     dining-rooms had different names.\r\n\r\n     Negroes entering the Indiana Avenue dining-room are given\r\n     prompt service. If they enter the Thirty-first Street room\r\n     they are given indifferent service, are required to wait long\r\n     and the service given them is reluctant and discourteous.\r\n\r\n     At another restaurant in the same neighborhood, similar means\r\n     are used to discourage Negro patronage. Sometimes in addition\r\n     to long waiting and discourtesy, food is spoiled. For example,\r\n     egg shells are placed in egg orders, and salt is poured into\r\n     the food.\r\n\r\nIn the districts where whites predominate, the measures taken to exclude\r\nNegroes are very definite. In a lunchroom near Forty-third Street and\r\nVincennes Avenue, a well-educated, well-appearing young Negro had the\r\nfollowing experience:\r\n\r\n     I went into the restaurant about two o'clock June 13, and sat\r\n     about four seats from the front at a counter. After about ten\r\n     minutes the waiter came and asked me to move to a seat at the\r\n     rear of the counter. I asked him why and he told me he could not\r\n     serve me where I was sitting. He said the management reserved\r\n     the right to seat its guests, and pointed to a sign on the\r\n     wall bearing that notice. I asked him if he could not serve\r\n     me just as well where I was sitting as on the rear counter.\r\n     He said maybe he could, but it was a rule of the house not\r\n     to, and he would not. I left without being served.\r\n\r\nAnother Negro experience in a lunchroom on Forty-third Street near the\r\nElevated is thus described: \"Service given was very poor. When protest\r\nwas made, the police were called and the young man was arrested for\r\ndisorderly conduct. The case was dismissed.\"\r\n\r\nFifty-ninth and Halsted streets: \"Service refused in a Swedish café. No\r\nwitnesses.\"\r\n\r\nNear Berwyn and Broadway (North Side): \"Service refused, and investigator\r\nordered out.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Loop,\" experiences are widely varied. In all of the following\r\ncases, carefully selected investigators were sent and asked to report in\r\ndetail what happened. It is possible to gather large numbers of personal\r\nexperiences, from any group of Negroes, but as the facts cannot be\r\nverified they have not been used. These instances usually go unnoticed\r\nby all but the participants, except where the parties offended may secure\r\nwitnesses among the guests present, which is difficult.\r\n\r\nAt a large, popular, general restaurant on Randolph Street, two women\r\ninvestigators had this typical experience showing how a manager can\r\nrefuse service, and still attempt to keep within the law:\r\n\r\n     Entered about 7:30 P.M. The restaurant was well filled; I\r\n     counted only six vacant tables. A woman head waitress took\r\n     us through the main dining-room to the annex, where another\r\n     head waitress preceded us down the length of the room to a\r\n     corner table in the rear. There was a vacant table on either\r\n     side of us. We waited almost a half hour, with no attention,\r\n     until a couple was seated at the next table. When the waitress\r\n     brought water to them she also brought water to us. She took\r\n     the orders for both tables. Mrs. H---- ordered steak, salad and\r\n     tea. I ordered chicken salad and tea. Steak and potatoes were\r\n     served to the next table in about ten minutes. The waitress\r\n     came to me and said the chef said he was out of chicken. I\r\n     ordered steak. After another long period of waiting, she came\r\n     back and said, \"The chef says he is out of small steaks.\" I\r\n     asked, \"What have you?\" She said she would go and see. She did\r\n     not return, but after about fifteen minutes a man came to our\r\n     table, put his hands on it, leaned down and said, \"Do you want\r\n     to see me?\" Although I suspected he was the manager, he had not\r\n     said so, and I replied, \"Who are you? I don't know anything\r\n     about you. No, we don't want to see you.\" He then said, \"I\r\n     am the manager. What do you want?\" \"I came to be served with\r\n     dinner.\" He replied, \"We have nothing to serve you.\" I asked,\r\n     \"Why, what is the reason?\" He replied \"There is no reason; we\r\n     haven't anything to serve you.\" He was evidently cautious to\r\n     keep within the letter of the law, but was determined that we\r\n     should not be served. He would give no reason, simply repeating\r\n     his former statement. We left without further discussion, and\r\n     without being served.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. T---- says the waitress was courteous, and evidently\r\n     regretful of the embarrassment of repeated refusal to serve.\r\n     None of the patrons sitting near made any protest at their\r\n     presence. It has been her experience that patrons, waitresses,\r\n     ushers in theaters rarely show any hesitancy in accepting the\r\n     presence of colored people who are orderly and self-respecting.\r\n     Almost invariably the disagreeable incidents happen through\r\n     the management, or through the carrying out of orders.\r\n\r\nAn interview with the manager of this restaurant was willingly given\r\nto a white investigator who later visited the place, and questions were\r\nanswered freely and carefully. He said he had a number of Negro friends\r\nand appreciated the differences in them, as he did in whites. The main\r\npoints in a long discussion of restaurant management in general, and\r\nthe particular problem with reference to serving Negroes, he summed up\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     In the past five years, only one Negro has been served in this\r\n     restaurant. She came in with a southern family as maid to a\r\n     small child. The family was told that she could be served at a\r\n     table with them, or in a side room, but could not be served at\r\n     an adjoining table, even with the child. After some discussion,\r\n     the maid ate at one end of a long table with the child, while\r\n     the family sat at the other end.\r\n\r\n     At the time of the recent instance, when the two Negro women\r\n     came in, the manager was not in the restaurant. From what he\r\n     was told of the incident, he thinks he should have asked them\r\n     to come to the office, and explained the situation to them.\r\n     He had no doubt they would have understood, as he has always\r\n     found intelligent Negroes readily responsive to the things\r\n     which might be injurious to their relations with whites.\r\n\r\n     Before he was manager, a man brought in two Negroes, seemingly\r\n     to get a basis for a suit and damages. The manager offered to\r\n     serve them in a side room, but refused service in the main\r\n     dining-room. They left without being served, and nothing\r\n     further was heard from them.\r\n\r\n     In former years he had seen dishes broken in the presence of\r\n     Negroes after being used in high-grade restaurants where their\r\n     patronage was not wanted.\r\n\r\n     Barring Negroes was not personal, he said. A successful\r\n     restaurant must watch closely the desires of its patrons, and\r\n     not allow anything to interfere with smooth running. Complaints\r\n     are made after each appearance of Negroes. He did not know\r\n     what he would do if Negroes insisted on being served, but was\r\n     firm that no Negro could be served in the main dining-rooms.\r\n     He would vary procedure to suit the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe following case, illustrative of the witnesses and testimony necessary\r\nto a court decision, was tried before Judge Adams, and damages of $100\r\nwith costs were awarded:\r\n\r\n     In August, 1920, Miss Lillian Beale, Negro secretary to Miss\r\n     Amelia Sears, white, superintendent of the United Charities,\r\n     went as the guest of her employer to a candy shop and lunch\r\n     room on Michigan Avenue. They seated themselves and remained\r\n     for two hours without service. During this time several\r\n     friends of Miss Sears came in, were served and left, all of\r\n     them commenting on the apparently deliberate oversight of the\r\n     party. They remained for some time and left. Suit was brought\r\n     against the company, supported by Miss Sears and her friends.\r\n     At the first hearing it was stated that the waitress was ill at\r\n     a hospital in Cincinnati. The judge, however, was insistent,\r\n     and she was produced. When placed on the stand she admitted,\r\n     contrary to the expectations of the management, that she had\r\n     been ordered by the management not to serve any colored persons\r\n     at any time. Miss Beale was awarded and collected damages of\r\n     $100 and costs.\r\n\r\nEight months later, in July, 1921, a test was made of the same restaurant.\r\nTwo Negro women went together to the restaurant, and a white woman\r\nobserver went along to watch what might happen. Their reports agree and\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n     Time, one o'clock. Restaurant 50 per cent filled. Mrs. L----\r\n     and Mrs. S---- came in and seated themselves at a table for\r\n     two near the center of the room. Waitress followed usual\r\n     routine of bringing water, taking order, etc. Service of a\r\n     table d'hôte luncheon was prompt and courteous. No inattention\r\n     was observed, nor any disturbance on part of neighbors. Two\r\n     white women came in and seated themselves at the next table,\r\n     though there were several others vacant.\r\n\r\nTwo other Negro women and a white observer were sent to another restaurant\r\noperating under the same firm name. It was reported by the white observer\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     Restaurant two thirds filled--12 o'clock. Mostly women patrons,\r\n     though a fair number of men alone, and of couples use this\r\n     restaurant. Mrs. T---- and her friend came in through the long\r\n     passage by the candy counter, and crossed to a table for two\r\n     in the middle of the room. The manager, who is a young woman\r\n     of considerable poise and ability, came at once and gave them\r\n     water, took their order, and later served them. Two young\r\n     white women at an adjoining table moved, but it may have been\r\n     because they were sitting with strangers and preferred a table\r\n     for two. After finishing my lunch, I joined Mrs. T---- and\r\n     her friend, and the manager kept us under observation, but\r\n     nothing was said.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent interview with the manager at the general office of this\r\nchain of tea rooms cautiously worded replies were made to questions,\r\nwith constant reiteration of the statement, \"But you know we must serve\r\nthem.\" In general it was said:\r\n\r\n     Negro patrons are infrequent, and there has been no noticeable\r\n     increase. After many cases, complaint is made by white patrons,\r\n     either in person or by letter, to the effect that if the tea\r\n     room caters to Negroes, the white patrons will no longer use\r\n     it. They had never known of a case of objectionable conduct\r\n     but whites simply objected to their presence.\r\n\r\n     No instructions were given waitresses, but each case was\r\n     handled by the head waitress as it occurred. Some girls made no\r\n     objections to waiting on Negroes, and some refused to do it,\r\n     but each attitude is individual, and not from instructions.\r\n     No question that Negro patronage would hurt any high-grade\r\n     place, as white patrons would be likely to leave. Rights did\r\n     not enter into the problem--simply a matter of profitable\r\n     business.\r\n\r\nInterviews with managers of tea rooms in department stores brought out\r\nuniformity of attitude and of practice, as is shown in the following\r\nreports:\r\n\r\n     The manager of one tea room is a young woman of considerable\r\n     experience. She was emphatic in saying that Negroes were not\r\n     wanted, and that every effort would be made to discourage\r\n     their coming. Considerable personal feeling was manifested in\r\n     her statements.\r\n\r\n     Not enough Negroes can afford to pay the prices in high-grade\r\n     restaurants to make them a real problem, and stray cases\r\n     are handled as they appear. The effort was made to make them\r\n     feel uncomfortable so they would not return. Slow service,\r\n     indifferent attention were given, but there was no overcharging,\r\n     and no spoiling of food.\r\n\r\n     Had never observed any objectionable conduct. Objections of\r\n     white patrons was only reason. Especially difficult in summer,\r\n     when many southern white people come to Chicago as a summer\r\n     resort.\r\n\r\n     Waitresses are largely young married women with spare time.\r\n     Manager finds them more unwilling than regular waitresses to\r\n     give service to Negroes.\r\n\r\nAt another tea room practically the same statements were made, and the\r\nfollowing instance was given: \"Last winter a telephone reservation was\r\nmade for a large luncheon party--about forty. When the group arrived,\r\nit was a club of colored women. Screens were placed around the tables,\r\nand luncheon served. A rule was then made and enforced that no telephone\r\nreservations would be made.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing are reports from investigators seeking to learn at which\r\nrestaurants, tea rooms, and lunch counters, service would be given to\r\nNegroes:\r\n\r\n     We had been shopping down town, and went into ----'s on State\r\n     Street to get a light lunch. There were vacant tables and\r\n     we sat down. No one came to wait on us. After waiting until\r\n     several persons who had come in after us had been served, I\r\n     went to one of the men who appeared to be the manager, and\r\n     asked him why we were not served. He did not respond very\r\n     cordially, but sent a girl. We ordered several dishes from\r\n     the card, and were told that they were \"just out.\" Although\r\n     orders were being served, the girl stated that they were \"just\r\n     out\" of everything we ordered. To cover our embarrassment,\r\n     we practically begged her to serve us cups of chocolate. She\r\n     gave us the chocolate and our check; we paid it and left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Mrs. T---- and Mrs. -- were served promptly and without incident\r\n     in a well-known candy store in the shopping district on State\r\n     Street. Mrs. T---- says that for many years this place has been\r\n     known for its courtesy to colored people. Soon after it was\r\n     opened, about World's Fair year, Mrs. ----, a Negro woman, was\r\n     refused service by a waitress. She reported the fact to the\r\n     owner, who investigated, and finding her statement correct,\r\n     discharged the waitress. He made the rule that every patron\r\n     was entitled to prompt, courteous service, and that discharge\r\n     would follow any justified complaint. Although the store\r\n     has been under other management for many years, later adding\r\n     light luncheons to candy and soft drinks, the tradition has\r\n     continued. Mrs. T---- says neither waitress nor patrons paid\r\n     any attention to the serving of two colored women.\r\n\r\nThis case, involving three races, was reported from one of the Chinese\r\nrestaurants on South Wabash Avenue:\r\n\r\n     About 7:00 P.M. we entered a Chinese restaurant. There were\r\n     three or four white couples eating in the main dining-room,\r\n     and two in booths. A Japanese waiter ushered us toward the\r\n     furthest booth at the rear of the room. \"I prefer sitting in\r\n     the main dining-room,\" I said. He replied, \"I can't serve you\r\n     here.\" \"Why?\" \"These seats are reserved. I will serve you in\r\n     there [pointing to the booth] but not out here.\" We left.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest chains of cafeterias in Chicago is noted for the\r\nfairness of its treatment of Negroes, but even here there are exceptions.\r\nOne of the Commission's staff observed two incidents within a short time\r\nin the same cafeteria of this system and reported them as follows:\r\n\r\n     Just in line before me was a small, quiet, well-dressed\r\n     colored woman. She passed the checker, carried her tray to an\r\n     unoccupied table, and then counted her check. She took her\r\n     tray back to the checker, and made complaint of overcharge.\r\n     The checker did not recount, or explain, simply saying, \"That\r\n     is our price.\" The woman went back to her table, ate, paid,\r\n     and went out without further protest.\r\n\r\n     A few nights later, I noticed two young, well-mannered colored\r\n     girls at a nearby table. As I went out I met the manager and\r\n     said to him, \"Do many Negroes come here to eat?\" He said,\r\n     \"No, occasionally they come in, but they don't come back more\r\n     than once, or at most twice.\" \"How do you manage it?\" \"Well,\r\n     under the law, we can't refuse to let them eat, but we can\r\n     charge them any price we like. The first time we charge them\r\n     enough to keep them from coming back. Then if they persist\r\n     and come again, as soon as they go down the line, I see to\r\n     it that something is put in their food which makes it taste\r\n     bad--salt or Epsom salts. They never come back after that.\"\r\n     After a pause he added, \"You know we are within the law. We\r\n     can't have them coming here--it would ruin our trade.\"\r\n\r\nIn the inexpensive restaurants on the edge of the \"Loop,\" various\r\npractices are followed, as indicated by the following reports:\r\n\r\n     Miss B. S. met a friend and went into the ---- Cafeteria on\r\n     Lake Street, near State, upstairs. They were served, but the\r\n     waiter put screens around their table while they were eating.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In May, 1921, I went to a lunchroom on Van Buren Street to\r\n     get a lunch at noon. Six or seven men were at the counter,\r\n     and were served as fast as they came in. Finally all seats\r\n     were filled and three waiters were doing nothing, so I asked\r\n     to be served. The waiter pretended not to hear me, then said\r\n     roughly, \"What do you want?\" I said, \"I do not know until I\r\n     get a bill of fare.\" He pitched it at me and I asked for some\r\n     baked beans. He stuck his head through the chef's window and\r\n     gave my order. He brought me a plate on which were fourteen\r\n     beans, and one small roll. I asked for a glass of water and he\r\n     brought me a half-glass. I asked for butter (which had been\r\n     served with two rolls to white patrons) and he said it would\r\n     cost me a nickel. He said with emphasis, \"It will cost _you_\r\n     a nickel.\" I said, \"You give me the butter, and then watch me\r\n     and see if I pay for it.\" I asked for some pie and he gave me\r\n     a piece about half the size he was serving the others. Then\r\n     he said again, \"Remember that butter will cost you a nickel\r\n     extra.\" I said, \"I won't pay it.\" He said, \"You will pay for\r\n     that dinner before you eat a bite of it.\" I said, \"No chance,\r\n     because I am not going to pay you at all, either before or\r\n     after I eat. After I have finished I will pay the cashier at\r\n     the desk.\" He looked at me hard and I kept on eating. Then he\r\n     threw me down a check for 25 cents. I said, \"Brother, you are\r\n     wrong. My bill is only 20 cents. Your menu says beans are 15\r\n     cents and pie is 5 cents, and you gave me only one roll when\r\n     to all of the others you served two.\" He said again, \"I told\r\n     you your butter would cost you a nickel.\" I said, \"Now, you\r\n     watch me right close when I go out and see if I pay for it.\"\r\n     I told the cashier that my check called for 25 cents when it\r\n     should be 20, \"beans 15, pie 5, and if you can make 25 out of\r\n     that all right.\" She said, \"You know I have to collect what\r\n     the check calls for, or else make good myself.\" I told her\r\n     I appreciated her position but would not pay 25 cents for a\r\n     20-cent lunch. Then my waiter stepped up with an iron tap in\r\n     his hand, and said, \"I told you that butter would cost you a\r\n     nickel, and now you pay it or else----.\" I said, I will \"else,\"\r\n     and laid down twenty cents and walked out. At the door he gave\r\n     me a push but did not strike me.\r\n\r\nThe white proprietor of a drug-store in a residence neighborhood\r\nvolunteered this story to a member of the Commission's staff:\r\n\r\n     Several years ago, there was a fine old colored man who used\r\n     to come in frequently to buy drugs, supplies, etc. One day he\r\n     came in with his wife, sat down at one of the little tables,\r\n     and asked for soda water. My clerk refused to serve them, and\r\n     the idea occurred to me that I would serve them myself in such\r\n     a way that there would be no possibility that they would ever\r\n     come back. I compounded a vile concoction and served it to\r\n     them. They tasted it, paid for it, thanked me, and went out\r\n     without making any complaint. I have never got over feeling\r\n     mean about it. I not only humiliated them, and insulted them,\r\n     but I cheated them out of their money.\r\n\r\nAn instance of unusual absence of friction in contacts under conditions\r\nwhich might be expected to produce it was given by a white woman who\r\nvisited a restaurant patronized by many whites and Negroes:\r\n\r\n     In talking with Mr. O---- he asked me, \"Would you consider it\r\n     possible that you would voluntarily go into a restaurant and\r\n     eat your lunch where you might have a Negro sitting on the\r\n     next stool, or perhaps one on either side of you at a table?\"\r\n     I answered promptly, \"No, I can't imagine it.\" He said, \"A year\r\n     ago I wouldn't have imagined such a thing possible myself, but\r\n     now I do it quite frequently. There is a restaurant across the\r\n     street from my office, right here in the heart of the Negro\r\n     district, which a few years ago was a very good one, with\r\n     regular table service, excellent food, and all the rest. Last\r\n     year it was changed into a sort of a cafeteria, with a lunch\r\n     counter down one side, and some tables. You get your knife\r\n     and fork, go to the serving counter, and a man gives you on a\r\n     plate whatever you order. The other day I found myself between\r\n     two colored men, and took a good look at the restaurant. There\r\n     is absolutely no disturbance, or even consciousness of any\r\n     reason for disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n     Today I decided I would try it myself. The restaurant has no\r\n     frills; it is simply an eating-place. I chose a corner seat\r\n     at a table, because I could see all over the room. As I sat\r\n     down, a courteous arm reached across the table to shove back\r\n     the used dishes. I looked up to say \"thank you,\" and found a\r\n     good-looking young colored man opposite. No further attention\r\n     was paid to me, nor was there any consciousness in his face,\r\n     other than courtesy. In a few minutes, two young white truck\r\n     drivers took the other places at my table. They were in working\r\n     jeans, and except that the color was blue instead of khaki,\r\n     looked just like the young soldiers in transport service who\r\n     used to come into my canteen in France. At the next table was\r\n     a quietly dressed young colored girl eating her lunch in a\r\n     business-like way. A young white father brought in his little\r\n     daughter. At the long lunch counter were neighborhood business\r\n     men, white and colored, some professional men, each taking\r\n     whatever stool happened to be vacant. Occasionally a truck\r\n     driver or roughly dressed working man came in. Even the white\r\n     dandy, immaculate in linen and with a cane hooked over his\r\n     arm, took his cup of coffee to the counter and sat between a\r\n     laborer and a business man.\r\n\r\nIn theaters, as in restaurants, there are petty evasions of the law,\r\ndisagreeable encounters, and small but insistent snobberies. A colored\r\ninvestigator reported the result of a test of the purchase of tickets\r\nfor a play which had had a long run, as follows:\r\n\r\n     On July 5 I went down to the ---- theater and asked the ticket\r\n     seller if I could get two seats for Thursday or Friday night\r\n     between the third and ninth rows, center. She hunted out two\r\n     seats in the ninth row for Thursday. I said, \"If you have them\r\n     I would prefer them for Friday.\" I asked the price, paid her,\r\n     and she thanked me.\r\n\r\n     Friday, I went to the theater, and handed the doorman my\r\n     tickets. He tore off the coupons, and directed me to the\r\n     main-floor door. The lady usher seated us three rows from\r\n     the back on the aisle. I counted and found that I was in the\r\n     seventeenth row. I went to the usher and said, \"I beg your\r\n     pardon, but you seated me in the wrong place.\" She took the\r\n     coupons, said, \"Wait a second,\" and started out with them. I\r\n     followed to see that she did not exchange my coupons. She went\r\n     to the lobby and talked with the manager. He looked at me and\r\n     said, \"Well, seat them; there is nothing else to do now.\" She\r\n     went back, gave my coupons to another usher, who asked her\r\n     if I was to be seated in the seats the coupons called for.\r\n     She answered, \"I guess so.\" Then we were shown to the correct\r\n     seats. There was no protest from those around us.\r\n\r\nThe manager of this theater was later interviewed. He had been in Chicago\r\nonly a few months and was not at all interested in the general question\r\nof race relations, but was decided in his opinion that the attendance\r\nof Negroes in any high-class theater was not desirable. His views were\r\nabout as follows:\r\n\r\n     Not many Negroes buy seats down stairs. Usually the ticket\r\n     seller gives them tickets in the balcony or gallery and on the\r\n     side aisles. Usually had complaints from white patrons if they\r\n     found a Negro seated near them, especially if there were ladies\r\n     in the party. It was not that the conduct of the Negroes was\r\n     objectionable, but their mere presence was objectionable. If\r\n     Negroes present tickets for the best main-floor seats, ushers\r\n     try to put them in less conspicuous places. If they insist on\r\n     taking their seats as shown on tickets, nothing can be done.\r\n     If white patrons object, every effort is made to change their\r\n     seats. Usual objection is offensive odor and proximity.\r\n\r\nIn making the study of theaters, certain tests were established. A Negro\r\nwould ask at the box-office for seats on the main floor within certain\r\nrows and on the aisle. In the preceding report it will be noted that\r\nseats were sold readily, but some difficulty was found in using them.\r\nIn the next report, conditions were reversed:\r\n\r\n     Mr. J----, Negro, asked for tickets, and was told that there\r\n     was nothing on the main floor further in front than the\r\n     twenty-third row. Miss H----, white, who was standing by him\r\n     as he made the request, and heard the answer, moved up to\r\n     the window and was immediately and without any remark, sold\r\n     tickets in the seventeenth row on the aisle.\r\n\r\nThese tickets were presented by Mr. and Mrs. S----, Negroes. They report:\r\n\r\n     We arrived at 8:15, five minutes before the opening of the\r\n     performance. The ticket taker tore off our stubs and returned\r\n     them to us without any hesitancy. The ushers, who were women,\r\n     glanced at the seat numbers and directed us to our seats,\r\n     which were in a very conspicuous location on the first floor.\r\n     They were in the seventeenth row, on the aisle. The people\r\n     around us, even the ones immediately next to us, were not in\r\n     the least concerned at our presence. The treatment accorded\r\n     us in general could not have been surpassed.\r\n\r\nA different report comes from another \"Loop\" theater, which has always\r\nbeen rather conservative in the standard of plays which it presents:\r\n\r\n     My husband and I wished to see a play at ---- Theater, and\r\n     bought seats several days in advance that we might have a\r\n     choice. When we were shown to our seats, however, we were\r\n     surprised to find that our tickets called for seats in the\r\n     gallery, and in a corner which did not afford a view, and\r\n     made them more than undesirable. We noticed that there were\r\n     several vacant seats in the balcony, also on the first floor.\r\n     My husband went to the box office and tried to exchange the\r\n     seats. The ticket seller refused to make the exchange and also\r\n     became insulting in his remarks to us. Afterwards we made the\r\n     attempt to secure seats on the first floor of this same theater\r\n     several days in advance of the performance which we wished to\r\n     attend. We were told there were no seats on the first floor\r\n     which we could get.\r\n\r\nA contrasting experience follows:\r\n\r\n     On Tuesday I went to the ---- Theater, and applied for two\r\n     tickets on the main floor, center aisle, between the third and\r\n     eleventh rows. The ticket seller stated politely that he had\r\n     two tickets in the ninth row on the left. When we attended the\r\n     performance, nothing unusual occurred. Other patrons made no\r\n     comment, and in no way could we observe any objection made to\r\n     our presence. There were no other Negroes at the performance.\r\n\r\nReports of investigators indicate that the managers of movies are\r\nconvinced that their main floors, at least, should be guarded against\r\nNegroes. In most of the commercial amusement places, Negroes seldom have\r\ndifficulty if they are willing to sit in the balcony, though attempts\r\nare frequently made to seat them on the aisles next to the walls, even\r\nwhen there are center seats empty. It is rare that any report is obtained\r\nof objections by white patrons to the actual presence of Negroes when\r\nthey are well-mannered, well-dressed, and appreciative auditors.\r\n\r\nAs a rule movie theaters do not sell reserved seats, general admission\r\nentitling any patron to any seat in the house. But the following detailed\r\nreport of the experience of two intelligent, well-dressed, quiet-mannered\r\nNegro women at a new movie theater on State Street is typical:\r\n\r\n     Purchased tickets, and entered the large lobby which extends\r\n     across the front of the house. From this lobby there are closed\r\n     doors at the entrance of several aisles, so that patrons are\r\n     directed by ushers to different aisles, supposedly wherever\r\n     there are vacant seats. We followed directions, and went to\r\n     the extreme left of the lobby. We opened the door, and the\r\n     usher in charge of this aisle started down toward the front\r\n     to show us seats. We saw at once that the narrow section of\r\n     seats next to the wall was empty except for one colored woman\r\n     sitting about the middle of the section. Instead of following\r\n     the usher down the aisle, and taking seats indicated to the\r\n     right of this section, we turned through a row of empty seats\r\n     on the left-hand section, and sat next to a woman in the aisle\r\n     seat. This put us two rows from the rear in a side middle\r\n     section, instead of in the section which seemed to be reserved\r\n     for colored patrons, next to the wall. As the usher returned\r\n     to his station he said, \"We have some lovely seats in the\r\n     balcony; wouldn't you prefer sitting there?\" He was courteous,\r\n     and I thanked him, telling him that we were quite satisfied\r\n     with the seats we had taken.\r\n\r\n     Later, seeing two vacant seats further front in the center\r\n     section which gave us a much better view we decided to take\r\n     them and see what would happen. As we rose, the usher tried to\r\n     block us by putting his hands on the back of the seat in front,\r\n     and saying, \"I am sorry that you can't take those seats.\" I\r\n     brushed by him and took one of the seats. He tried the same\r\n     thing with Mrs. H----, and she also brushed by and joined me.\r\n     There were scattered vacant seats both in the section we left\r\n     and the one to which we moved. We remained until the end of\r\n     the show without embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe manager of this theater has had many years of experience in Chicago,\r\nand was quite willing to discuss race contacts. Nothing in his words\r\nwould indicate any strong prejudice against Negroes, even when expressing\r\nhis conviction that they should keep to places intended especially for\r\nthem. He said, in substance:\r\n\r\n     Not many Negroes buy tickets--perhaps ten or a dozen a day.\r\n     An effort is made to seat them in one section of the house,\r\n     preferably the balcony, to which they are directed by ushers.\r\n     Reason is the complaint by white patrons who object to sitting\r\n     next to them for an hour, or hour and a half. Offensive odor\r\n     reason usually given. White patrons often complain to manager\r\n     as they go out if Negro has been sitting near them.\r\n\r\n     Conduct of Negroes is not often objectionable--runs about\r\n     the same as all patrons. Occasionally one tries to \"start\r\n     something.\" Recently two Negroes came to manager in crowded\r\n     lobby after they had attended the show and objected to their\r\n     seats on the balcony to which they had been sent by ushers,\r\n     saying there were vacant seats on the main floor. Wanted to\r\n     know why they were discriminated against. Manager did not want\r\n     an argument in the presence of other patrons, and told them\r\n     that as they had seen the show, heard the music, and shared\r\n     everything with other patrons, he did not see they had any real\r\n     cause for complaint. Called attention to the notice printed\r\n     on almost every theater ticket in some form or other to the\r\n     effect that the management reserves the right to revoke the\r\n     license granted in the sale of the ticket, by refunding the\r\n     money paid.\r\n\r\nThe same two women bought tickets the next day and attended a movie in\r\nan older and very popular \"Loop\" theater. They reported that they had\r\nno difficulty of any kind.\r\n\r\nOn a test made of a new and popular movie theater in an outlying section\r\nthe investigator reported:\r\n\r\n     There were four of us in the party on June 5. We were told\r\n     by the usher that there were no seats on the first floor, and\r\n     that we would find seats in the first balcony. I think he was\r\n     right, for there were white people also sent to the balcony. We\r\n     were ushered in promptly, but another usher met us and said,\r\n     \"Right on up to the second balcony.\" We said we preferred\r\n     seats in the first balcony, and walked by him. He went and\r\n     got two more ushers and stood in front of us to prevent us\r\n     from going into the first balcony, insisting that there were\r\n     no seats there. One of the young ladies stepped around the\r\n     usher, and saw three vacant seats. She called them to the\r\n     attention of the usher, and he then said he meant there were\r\n     no seats for four. Two of our party took those seats, and the\r\n     other two waited about twenty minutes till they could get the\r\n     seats they wanted. After getting into the first balcony, we\r\n     saw vacant seats in at least four rows, two, three, and four\r\n     seats together into which we might quietly have gone had the\r\n     usher been courteous.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1920, a well-known Negro employed in the City Hall was denied\r\nadmission to a movie theater at Halsted and Sixty-third streets. There\r\nis a small but long-established Negro colony about a mile west of this\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nIn business places of various kinds, contacts are determined largely\r\nby the kind of service offered. Department-store managers questioned\r\nby investigators concerning their Negro patronage and the use of Negro\r\ngirls as clerks, stated that the public had definite preferences, and\r\nprobably would not willingly tolerate Negroes either as patrons or as\r\nclerks. In stores selling general merchandise, courteous treatment is,\r\nas a rule, accorded to Negro patrons, although there are occasional\r\nannoying incidents. The attitude then taken is determined by the standing\r\nand influence of the Negroes discriminated against. For instance:\r\n\r\n     At one of the largest department stores, two Negro women,\r\n     both school teachers, were refused service in the basement\r\n     shoe department. The clerks refused to fit shoes for them. A\r\n     Negro alderman became interested in this case, and because of\r\n     refusal of service, canceled his account.\r\n\r\n     The wife of a prominent Negro attorney went into a State Street\r\n     candy store and was flatly refused service. Her husband brought\r\n     suit and got damages.\r\n\r\n     Miss V---- was refused service at a large State Street\r\n     department store by one of the clerks. The manager was\r\n     interviewed and the clerk reprimanded and transferred. On the\r\n     second visit, Miss V---- received attention.\r\n\r\nIn residence areas which are largely white, certain stores practice a\r\npeculiar subversion of the law in the effort to regulate contacts. A\r\nNegro resident of Woodlawn stated that his seven-year-old daughter had\r\ngone to the store to purchase goods for a costume to wear at a school\r\nentertainment. She was given material for which she had not asked, which\r\nshe did not want, and for which she was overcharged. Frightened at the\r\nmanners of the clerk, she took it. When it was returned, the clerk was\r\nextremely abusive, and told her that colored people were not wanted in\r\nthe store. The little girl had, according to her parents, made a mistake\r\nin entering the store. Her parents were acquainted with the attitude of\r\nthe management and avoided the place. In the following reports, there is\r\nevident the sense of injustice felt by both whites and Negroes concerned\r\nin the contacts:\r\n\r\n     Miss S. T---- wrote a prominent musical college and made\r\n     arrangements for taking the summer normal-training courses.\r\n     Her tuition fee was accepted, and the classes arranged. On her\r\n     arrival, the manager received the balance of her money for the\r\n     entire course, but told her the classes she wanted were full,\r\n     and she would have to take private lessons with another teacher.\r\n     The teacher of the desired classes told her the manager had\r\n     not been frank, and that he feared the objection of southern\r\n     white girls in the classes. Miss T---- made repeated attempts\r\n     to get into the classes, but each time was told to apply again.\r\n     This she did until it was too late to catch up with her back\r\n     work. Other pupils were given prompt admission to the classes.\r\n\r\nTwo investigators were instructed to go to a public restroom in a large\r\noffice building on State Street where there are many small shops selling\r\nwomen's wearing apparel. Their experience follows:\r\n\r\n     On July 6, at one P.M. with Mrs. H----, I visited the public\r\n     restroom in the ---- building. It is on the eleventh floor,\r\n     on the main hall, and the door to the suite of rooms stood\r\n     open. On one side of the entrance hall there is a small room\r\n     used for a shoe-shining, with a Negro in attendance. Next on\r\n     the same side is a large lavatory. Facing the outside door\r\n     is the entrance to the restroom proper, which is large enough\r\n     for ten or fifteen women, and is fitted up with wicker chairs,\r\n     lounge, table, etc.\r\n\r\n     As we were about to enter the restroom, the woman in charge\r\n     stood with her arm across the door, and said, \"You are not\r\n     to go in there; you may go into the lavatory.\" We asked why,\r\n     and she said, \"Those are the orders of the office.\" We went\r\n     into the restroom, and she did not offer any opposition, but\r\n     a little later came to us and said, \"You are not allowed in\r\n     here. You will have to see the manager.\"\r\n\r\n     I asked the attendant for the manager's name and room number,\r\n     which she gave me. I related the incident to him. He told\r\n     me that the attendant had informed me correctly, that the\r\n     eleventh-floor restroom was reserved for \"white folks\" and that\r\n     \"colored folks\" were not allowed to use it. They could use a\r\n     restroom on the nineteenth floor set aside for colored employees\r\n     of the building, and for any \"colored folks\" who might come\r\n     into the building. He said it was one of the \"iron-clad rules\r\n     of the man who owned the building,\" and that \"the attendant\r\n     had it down in black and white.\"\r\n\r\nDifficulties of this sort which confront Negroes and the efforts by\r\nNegroes to share equal treatment in public accommodations as well as the\r\nexperiences met with when cases reach the courts were commented upon by\r\nJudge Cook, of the municipal court, in testimony before the Commission.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n     During the earlier part of 1918 I sat in what was known as\r\n     the criminal jury branch. That is the branch to which were\r\n     assigned all criminal cases in the municipal court where the\r\n     defendants demanded a trial by jury and were not tried at the\r\n     police station. Among them were cases involving violations of\r\n     what is known as the civil-rights law, where a colored man had\r\n     a druggist or the proprietor of a moving picture or legitimate\r\n     theater arrested for refusing to serve him soda water or\r\n     refreshments at the drug store or to furnish him admission by\r\n     ticket at a movie or legitimate theater, or if he did furnish\r\n     him admission by selling him a ticket, limiting the ticket\r\n     which he would sell to some undesirable portion of the house\r\n     or to the gallery and not to the main floor, claiming that\r\n     the theater was crowded downstairs and that there were no seats.\r\n\r\n     I suppose I tried during the early part of 1918 and the summer\r\n     of 1919 probably a half-dozen of those civil-rights cases. In\r\n     every one of them that I tried, there was virtually a clear\r\n     case against the defendant. The jury in every instance was\r\n     practically a white jury, or may have had one or two colored\r\n     men. Notwithstanding that I gave very positive and clear\r\n     instructions as to what the law was--to wit, that they were\r\n     entitled to equal rights and privileges in public places and\r\n     that if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiff\r\n     was not accorded such right, there was a violation of the\r\n     law and the defendant should be punished, and after elaborate\r\n     argument by counsel for both the prosecution and the defendant\r\n     (and by parenthesis I may say in all of these cases the state's\r\n     attorney prosecuted vigorously), the jury, notwithstanding the\r\n     plain evidence and the instructions of the court, went out and\r\n     in about such time as it would take them to sign the verdict\r\n     and return to court, would bring in a verdict of \"Not Guilty.\"\r\n\r\n     Of course in the criminal court in a case of that kind, the\r\n     jury is the judge of both the law and the fact. Therefore,\r\n     I was not in a position to grant a new trial. The white jury\r\n     simply say that law was not the law in Illinois or they would\r\n     not convict under such circumstances, and having once acquitted\r\n     the man the court and the state were without any remedy. Now\r\n     I have always thought that was unjust.\r\n\r\nIt was his opinion that those Negroes who did bring cases into court made\r\na mistake in prosecuting them from a criminal standpoint. It seemed to\r\nbe, in his opinion, hopeless for Negroes to assert their rights through\r\nthe criminal courts.\r\n\r\nAnother judge of long experience in the Chicago courts expressed the view\r\nthat few Negroes brought in cases involving discrimination. He thought\r\nthat especially the better class of Negroes would not bring them because\r\nof the unpleasantness involved and because the damages obtained in most\r\ncases would not pay the attorney's charges. \"Most Negroes,\" he said, \"have\r\nfound out by experience what the actual feeling is and act accordingly,\r\ntrying to avoid unpleasant experiences as much as possible. Although\r\nthere would be no trouble in getting a verdict in any clear case, the\r\namount obtained would not compensate for the trouble involved.\" He did\r\nnot believe that any jury would convict a white defendant on a criminal\r\ncharge of discrimination. A prominent Negro attorney, who formerly held\r\na responsible state office, in giving his general experience said:\r\n\r\n     In cases involving only Negroes on each side, both judges\r\n     and juries will act squarely between them; in cases involving\r\n     white defendants and Negro plaintiffs, the tendency is to give\r\n     considerably less credibility or weight to Negro testimony;\r\n     in cases involving Negro defendants and white plaintiffs, the\r\n     tendency is to give more weight to white testimony.\r\n\r\nHe stated further that in discrimination cases, where the law had been\r\nclearly violated, there was usually no difficulty in getting a verdict\r\nand damages for $25 and up, but that he did not care much about handling\r\nsuch cases and Negroes did not care to push them, because they were\r\nunpleasant and expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. \"BLACK AND TAN\" RESORTS\r\n\r\nThe intimate association of Negroes and whites in the cabarets of the\r\nSouth Side has occasioned frequent and heated protests. Negro men are\r\nthere seen with white women and white men with Negro women. Although\r\nmixed couples constitute somewhat less than 10 per cent of the patronage,\r\nthis mingling is used to characterize all of the association there.\r\nThese resorts, with their liquor selling and coarse and vulgar dancing,\r\nare highly dangerous to morals and established law and order, and a\r\nnuisance to the neighborhoods in which they are located. They are used as\r\namusement places, both by white couples living in other sections of the\r\ncity and by Negro couples who live near them. In fact, although many of\r\nthe resorts are patronized by an equal number of whites and Negroes, the\r\nactual mixed couples are few. The habitués of these resorts are usually\r\nof an irresponsible type of pleasure seekers, and frequently they are\r\nvicious and immoral. Newspapers and several of the civic agencies have\r\nviolently criticized these places as a menace, but in their attacks the\r\nemphasis has usually been shifted from the menace to morals to that of\r\narousing sentiment against the mingling of races. The police on numbers\r\nof occasions have been urged to close the places in which this form of\r\nassociation took place. In most cases they have not done so, stating\r\nas their reason that, although mingling was undesirable, there was no\r\nlaw prohibiting such contacts, and that evidence of violations of such\r\nlaws as those concerning liquor selling or decency would be necessary\r\nto warrant their closing.\r\n\r\nDuring 1920 the Negro press began a series of attacks on violations\r\nof law and against the immoral resorts in the Negro residence areas,\r\nincluding the so-called \"black and tan\" cabarets, some of which were the\r\nmost notorious violators. This was followed by similar attacks from the\r\nwhite local newspapers. The emphasis in the white papers, however, was\r\non the race mingling. An extract from one of the articles in a white\r\npaper is given:\r\n\r\n              \"LID\" A JOKE AS PEKIN SHIMMIES DEFIANCE OF LAW\r\n\r\n              LIQUOR, SIRENS, JAZZ, RACE RAINBOW RIOT IN CAFÉ\r\n\r\n     \"Lawless liquor,\" sensuous \"shimmy,\" solicitous sirens,\r\n     wrangling waiters, all the tints of the racial rainbow, black\r\n     and tan and white, dancing, drinking, singing, early Sunday\r\n     morning at the Pekin café, 2700 South State Street....\r\n\r\n                         \"BLACK AND TAN AND WHITE\"\r\n\r\n     The crowd began to arrive. In came a mighty black man with\r\n     two white girls. A scarred white man entered with three girls,\r\n     two young and painted, the other merely painted.\r\n\r\n     Two well dressed youths hopped up the stairs with two\r\n     timid girls. Seven young men--they looked like back o' the\r\n     Yards--came with two women, one heavy footed, the other laughing\r\n     hysterically.\r\n\r\n     Two fur-coated \"high yaller\" girls romped up with a slender\r\n     white man. An attorney gazed happily on the party through horn\r\n     rimmed glasses. The waiters called, shouted, whistled when\r\n     each party arrived--a full table meant big tips.\r\n\r\n     At one o'clock the place was crowded. Meanwhile a syncopating\r\n     colored man had been vamping cotton field blues on the piano. A\r\n     brown girl sang.... All the tables were filled at two o'clock,\r\n     black men with white girls, white men with yellow girls, old,\r\n     young, all filled with the abandon brought about by illicit\r\n     whisky and liquor music.... The Pekin is again the Pekin of\r\n     years ago. Only more so.\r\n\r\nThe reply of a Negro newspaper to the series of articles in the white\r\npress on these resorts expresses the reactions of Negroes to this view:\r\n\r\n                       BLACK AND TANS AND RACE RIOTS\r\n\r\n     It is an established conviction that the so-called\r\n     \"intermingling of races\" in the cabarets of the South Side\r\n     is a fruitful source of riots. To those whose minds are bent\r\n     in this belief, the fact that no riot has ever yet started in\r\n     one of them is of little importance. Men believe, as a rule,\r\n     most readily what they earnestly wish to believe. It matters\r\n     little how absurd the proposition, if it expresses a desire\r\n     they will make of it an everlasting verity even though it costs\r\n     them the kingdom of heaven. And so it happens that we are told\r\n     that the Abyssinians burned a flag and almost precipitated\r\n     a race riot because they happened be to standing in front of\r\n     the Entertainers' Café where Negroes and white persons dance\r\n     on the same floor and occasionally together.\r\n\r\n     To carry further these deductions the United Cigar Store also\r\n     should be closed because one of the fanatics shot into it and\r\n     killed a white man. The connection of both of these places\r\n     with the incident is just about the same, if not a little\r\n     worse for the cigar store.\r\n\r\n     The fury back of complaints like that, for instance, of one\r\n     Mr. Farwell of the Law and Order League invites suspicion. In\r\n     all seriousness what is this crime of association for which\r\n     Mr. Farwell would have these places closed? If demoralization\r\n     of character is more certain in mixed places or liquor sold\r\n     more openly can it be urged that race contact is responsible?\r\n     It cannot. The sore point is the contact. These places are\r\n     located in the most densely populated Negro neighborhoods.\r\n     Attendance is voluntary and so is whatever amount of association\r\n     that follows. There is no manhandling of white innocents to\r\n     force them into the society of Negroes. Neither do Negroes\r\n     go snooping around the high lights of the West or North sides\r\n     seeking white companionship. But that is not the point. When\r\n     this antipathy is analyzed it becomes apparent that there is a\r\n     well defined intention to prove that any relationship varying\r\n     too sharply from the master and servant type is wrong. It\r\n     is the yelp of tribal jealousy. It is the gaunt denial of a\r\n     fallacious orthodoxy which proclaims that certain instincts\r\n     will keep certain persons eternally apart. It is that complex\r\n     of emotion into which all discussions of race relations resolve\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     The resentment of Negroes at the poorly veiled thrusts is\r\n     perfectly justifiable. However unwholesome to morals these\r\n     places may be they refuse to join in the chorus of hate against\r\n     amusement places just because they put no restraints upon their\r\n     associations. They feel that they are human and at liberty to\r\n     seek pleasure if they so desire where contacts are mutually\r\n     agreeable. Those who do not care for this contact will stay\r\n     away. Because a white woman will dance with a colored man or a\r\n     white man with a colored woman there is no argument that a riot\r\n     will follow. Persons who dance together are not so likely to\r\n     fight as persons who stand at a distance and call each other\r\n     bad names.\r\n\r\n     Rationally considered there is no ground for these contentions.\r\n     They are insulting. If danger is ahead for the city when the\r\n     Irish and Italians visit the same places of amusement or the\r\n     Swedes and Lithuanians, then some thought will be given by\r\n     Negroes to eliminating their dangers. There is no point to\r\n     calling the patrol because Mr. Farwell and the News think it\r\n     complicates the race question.\r\n\r\n     This paper condemned all of these places because they were\r\n     nuisances to the neighborhood--the blacks, the black and tans\r\n     and the whites--it did not by this condemnation imply that\r\n     color affects morals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CULTURAL CONTACTS\r\n\r\nContacts of whites and Negroes in institutions of learning, general\r\ncultural agencies, and meetings ordinarily involve no friction and are\r\nfrequently directly beneficial to race relations. Many Negroes visit and\r\nuse the public libraries. In fact, instances of objections on the part\r\nof the public in this institution appear to be extremely few. In the\r\nreading-rooms Negroes sit where they wish, and no objections to their\r\npresence are noted. At a branch library on Oakwood Boulevard over 70\r\nper cent of the patronage is of Negroes, and, the director says, very\r\ncordial relations exist. The civil-service system has made a number of\r\nNegroes eligible for positions in the direct public-service branches of\r\nthe city government. No apparent difficulties or objections have resulted.\r\n\r\nThe University of Chicago and Northwestern University have for many years\r\nhad Negro students. There were in 1921 more than sixty at the University\r\nof Chicago, and, although many southern white students attend, there\r\nhave been no conspicuous difficulties resulting from the associations. On\r\nthe contrary, certain individual Negroes have been very popular with the\r\nstudent body. During the 1920 football season two Negroes were members\r\nof the football squad, and for several years the favorite of the \"track\"\r\nwas Binga Dismond, a Negro runner.\r\n\r\nThere is no Negro member of the City Club or of the Woman's City\r\nClub, although the question of admitting Negroes has occasionally been\r\ndiscussed. The Chicago Woman's Club has two Negro members, one for more\r\nthan fifteen years. Negroes, however, have been welcomed to meetings\r\nand in some instances have themselves held meetings there.\r\n\r\nA few white churches have several Negro members, usually of long standing.\r\nThere are instances of white churches accepting particular Negro members,\r\nwith some apprehension that they might bring friends. The Catholic and\r\nChristian Science churches welcome the presence of Negroes at their\r\nservices. There is no Christian Science church exclusively for Negroes,\r\nand several hundred Negroes attend the various services of this church.\r\n\r\nMany of the more definitely intellectual agencies like the Chicago\r\nEthical Society, the Chicago Rational Society, and the Sunday Evening\r\nClub have regular Negro attendance. At the Chicago Rational Society one\r\nof the young hostesses is a Negro.\r\n\r\nIn these forms of contact it is seldom, if ever, that Negroes are\r\ndiscourteously received. This may be due to the relatively high class\r\nof whites and Negroes who share these associations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. CONTACTS IN CO-OPERATIVE EFFORTS FOR RACE BETTERMENT\r\n\r\nMost of the important social organizations and agencies of the city\r\nwhich aim definitely at the improvement of the Negro group have mixed\r\nboards of control and supervision. The philanthropy, business ability,\r\nand influence of white members is combined with the influence of Negro\r\nmembers and their intelligent understanding of their own group problems.\r\n\r\nThe Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian\r\nAssociation, the Chicago Urban League, Community Service, the National\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Inter-racial\r\nCommittee organized by the Chicago Woman's Club are examples of this\r\nform of joint effort. The sentiments of both groups in contact may\r\nbe discussed and, on the basis of represented group conditions and\r\nsentiments, programs are formulated and carried out. This association\r\nand exchange of sentiment provide a means of breaking down the isolation\r\nbetween the groups and at the same time offer a means of extending the\r\nrepresentative thought of Negroes through their white associates to\r\ncircles in which contacts are either prohibited or restricted by custom\r\nand tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCRIME AND VICIOUS ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crime rate of Negroes is so largely controlled by a tangle of\r\npredisposing circumstances that it is hardly possible to isolate\r\nand measure its factors. The most important element is the general\r\nlawlessness, crime, and vice in the whole population, irrespective of\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL CRIME SITUATION\r\n\r\nDuring 1919 there were 330 homicides in Chicago. In 1920, in addition\r\nto 162 murders, 559 persons were slain by automobiles, largely through\r\ncarelessness. According to the Chicago Crime Commission's report for\r\n1920 there are 10,000 professional criminals in Chicago, and the annual\r\nloss from larcenies, robberies, and burglaries aggregates $12,000,000.\r\nChicago pays a higher rate for burglary insurance than any other American\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nCrime conditions in Chicago are even worse than is indicated by these\r\nfigures, which are based on incomplete police records. In 1919 the police\r\nrecords showed 1,731 burglaries or persons arrested for burglaries,\r\nwhile _Bulletin No. 9_ of the Chicago Crime Commission reported 5,509\r\nburglaries during the first eleven months. During the same period the\r\npolice records showed 1,975 robberies or persons arrested for robbery,\r\nwhile the Crime Commission bulletin listed 2,470 robberies. This bulletin\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     An investigation in August, 1919, to determine whether all\r\n     crimes were being reported from the Eleventh Precinct and the\r\n     Englewood precinct showed that in forty instances burglaries\r\n     and robberies committed during the ninety days preceding had\r\n     not been reported. A detailed statement of these offenses\r\n     was prepared giving the victim's names, addresses, date and\r\n     amount of loss, and presented to the general superintendent\r\n     of police. The list was checked by the departmental inspector\r\n     and found correct.\r\n\r\nAnother investigation by the Crime Commission showed that in one month\r\na certain police captain reported only thirty-seven of the 141 criminal\r\ncomplaints made to him for his district.\r\n\r\nIn his book, _Crime in America and the Police_, Raymond B. Fosdick wrote\r\n(1920):\r\n\r\n     London in 1916, with a population of seven and a quarter\r\n     million, had nine premeditated murders. Chicago, one-third the\r\n     size of London, in the same period had 105, _nearly twelve\r\n     times London's total_. In 1916 Chicago with its 2,500,000\r\n     people had twenty more murders than the whole of England and\r\n     Wales with their 38,000,000. The Chicago murders during the\r\n     year totalled one more than London during the five-year period,\r\n     1910-14 inclusive.\r\n\r\n     In 1917 Chicago had ten more murders than the whole of England\r\n     and Wales, and four more murders than all England, Wales,\r\n     and Scotland. In 1918 Chicago had fourteen more murders than\r\n     England and Wales, and in 1919 the number of murders in Chicago\r\n     was almost exactly six times the number committed in London.\r\n\r\n     Chicago in 1916 had 532 more burglaries than London; in 1917,\r\n     3,459 more; in 1918, 866 more, and in 1919, 2,146 more. In\r\n     1918, for example, Chicago had twenty-two robberies for every\r\n     robbery in London, and fourteen robberies for every robbery\r\n     in England and Wales.\r\n\r\n     Chicago's arrests for 1917 exceeded London's by 61,874.\r\n\r\n     Thefts of automobiles reported in 1919: New York, 5,527, Chicago\r\n     4,316.... London, 290, Liverpool, 10. Comparative statistics\r\n     as to the number of automobiles in English and American cities\r\n     are impossible to obtain.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that this reign of violence and lawlessness must have a\r\npotent effect upon the crime rate of Negroes in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PREVALENT IMPRESSIONS REGARDING NEGRO CRIME\r\n\r\nIn its inquiry the Commission met the following current beliefs among\r\nwhites in regard to the Negro criminal:\r\n\r\nThat the Negro is more prone than the white to commit sex crimes,\r\nparticularly rape; that he commits a disproportionate number of crimes\r\ninvolving felonious cuttings and slashings; that the recent migrant\r\nfrom the South is more likely to offend than the Negro who has resided\r\nlonger in the North; and that Negroes willingly tolerate vice and vicious\r\nconditions in the midst of their residence districts. These and similar\r\nimpressions are compared with the facts as found by the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CRIMINAL STATISTICS\r\n\r\nIn its effort to secure information regarding Negro crime the Commission\r\nsought the only available records kept of all crimes--the police records,\r\nespecially the annual report of the Department of Police. On examination\r\nthese records were found to be of questionable value for any accurate\r\npresentation of Negro crime, or, in fact, of general crime. In 1913 the\r\nCity Council Committee on Crime made a study of crimes in Chicago and\r\nencountered the same difficulty. Says the report of this Committee: \"The\r\npolice and criminal judicial statistics in Chicago are wholly incomplete\r\nand are not even assembled or published by any authority.\" Further\r\ncommenting on this inadequacy, it says:\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately, there is in Illinois no central bureau of\r\n     criminal statistics through which statistics from the police\r\n     department, the courts, the jails, prisons, and the probation\r\n     department are collected and correlated. A state bureau of\r\n     criminal statistics does exist on our statute books, for, by\r\n     a law approved June 11, 1912, the State Charities Commission\r\n     was directed to establish such a bureau with the secretary of\r\n     the Commission as director in charge. This proposed bureau was\r\n     charged with the duty of collecting and publishing annually\r\n     the statistics of Illinois relating to crime, and all courts\r\n     of Illinois, police magistrates, justices of the peace, clerks\r\n     of all courts of record, sheriffs, keepers of all places\r\n     of detention for crime or misdemeanors or violations of the\r\n     criminal statutes are to \"furnish said bureau annually such\r\n     information on request as it may require in compiling such\r\n     statistics.\" Up to the present time, however, owing chiefly\r\n     to the fact that no appropriation has been made to cover\r\n     the expenses of this work, no steps have been taken by the\r\n     executive secretary of the Commission towards putting this law\r\n     into effect. Moreover, there has never been in Chicago any\r\n     attempt at an annual \"stock-taking\" in which the statistics\r\n     furnished by the various departments and agencies dealing with\r\n     the problem of crime might be brought together and examined\r\n     with the hope of determining how far the problem is being\r\n     adequately met.\r\n\r\nBecause there has been no systematic handling of criminal statistics,\r\nno method has been developed for accurately measuring the prevalence of\r\ncrime. The Crime Commission expressed its difficulty here in this manner:\r\n\r\n     It is very important to note that the number of arrests is\r\n     not synonymous with number of crimes, among others reasons\r\n     because (1) a large number of persons may be arrested for\r\n     complicity in a single crime; (2) many innocent persons are\r\n     arrested through misapprehension and later discharged; and\r\n     (3) the vast majority of arrests are for petty offenses that\r\n     are not serious enough to be called \"crimes\" at all. Some\r\n     consideration should be given to the question of \"new crime.\"\r\n     When laws are passed creating new offenses, there may be an\r\n     increase in arrests without any corresponding increase in\r\n     criminality. As a matter of fact, however, the new offenses\r\n     are chiefly those involving misdemeanors and violations of\r\n     ordinances. New felonies are rarely created. In Chicago the\r\n     police classification does, however, include two new offenses\r\n     improperly classed as felonies, \"contributing to delinquency\"\r\n     and \"pandering.\"\r\n\r\nTo the difficulties experienced by the City Council Crime Committee in\r\ndetermining the extent of general crime may be added the even greater\r\ndifficulty of comparing the crime record of Negroes with that of other\r\nracial groups. The sources of the police statistics are the bookings by\r\nthe desk sergeant in the police station. These are taken from arrest slip\r\nnotations made by police-station desk sergeants, before whom persons\r\narrested are brought. The ability of these desk sergeants correctly\r\nto ascertain the prisoner's race or nationality is open to question.\r\nReports from the Immigrants' Protective League show that the foreigners\r\narrested are often given wrong racial designations. On the other hand\r\nthe classification of Negroes, even of half blood, is never in doubt.\r\nThis fact should be remembered in interpreting the figures, for the Negro\r\nwill be debited with all the crimes he commits, while figures for other\r\ngroups will probably not indicate the full extent of their criminality.\r\nAdded to this is the disposition, conscious or unconscious, to arrest\r\nNegroes more freely than whites, to book them on more serious charges,\r\nto convict them more readily, and to give them longer sentences.\r\n\r\nThis bias does not appear in the bare figures, which thus seem to\r\nsubstantiate the already existing belief that Negroes are more criminal\r\nthan other racial groups. An example of this is found in the bookings\r\nin murder cases. For the six-year period 1914-19 inclusive, 1,121\r\nwhites and 193 Negroes were booked for murder, while 501 whites and\r\nonly twenty-one Negroes were booked for manslaughter. While Negroes\r\nwere charged with 17.1 per cent of the murders, they were charged with\r\nonly 4.1 per cent of the cases of manslaughter. This, of course, takes\r\ninto account bookings before trial. On the other hand, according to\r\nthe testimony, they are more easily convicted on the charges on which\r\nthey are booked. This fact introduces another element in the figures,\r\nwhich, although not representing the actual criminality of Negroes, yet\r\ngives plausibility to records. These situations presented such obvious\r\ndangers that the Commission considered it best to avoid giving currency\r\nto figures which carried such clear evidence of their own inaccuracy and\r\nmisrepresentation. Since it is necessary to employ some of these figures\r\ndespite their inaccuracies, the effort has been made to use them only\r\nwhere clear comparisons are possible.\r\n\r\nThe Commission is aware that statistics have been prepared giving the\r\nrelative crime rates of different national groups, and has inquired into\r\nthe sources of such statistics. In one case, for example, population\r\nestimates were based on 1910 census figures, arbitrarily increased by\r\none-third. But when the abnormal situation with respect to immigration\r\ncaused by the war, to mention only one important disturbing factor, is\r\ntaken into consideration, it will be appreciated that any estimate is\r\nof doubtful value for careful calculation.\r\n\r\nAfter much study and experimentation, and particularly after the counsel\r\nof statistical authorities had been obtained, the Commission's plan to\r\nwork out comparative racial crime tables was abandoned.\r\n\r\nAside from the striking discrepancies between the crime figures of\r\nthe Police Department and those of the Chicago Crime Commission, it\r\nis doubtful whether a reliable index to Negro crime as a separate item\r\ncould be obtained even if the police figures showed the whole, instead\r\nof one-fifth or one-half, of the crimes committed.[45]\r\n\r\nIt was brought out in the testimony of judges and other authorities\r\nthat Negroes are more easily identified and more likely to be arrested,\r\nand it is reasonably certain that a smaller proportion of Negroes who\r\ncommit crimes escape than whites. But there is absolutely no means of\r\ndetermining what proportion of crime unrecorded by the police or other\r\nauthorities is committed by whites or Negroes.\r\n\r\nAdequate comparison of criminal statistics requires at least comparable\r\nunits. This is rarely taken into account in comparing Negro and white\r\ncrime. For example: a true comparison of relative crime rates between\r\nthe two groups would require that the age distribution in each should\r\nbe the same. For, although the population figures include children,\r\nwomen, and old persons, the greatest proportion of crimes is committed by\r\npersons within what is known to criminologists as the \"violent ages,\" or\r\nbetween eighteen and thirty. If the population is overbalanced in these\r\nages the crime rate will be exaggerated. Such an overbalance exists in\r\nthe Negro population because of the migration to Chicago of more than\r\n50,000 Negroes, mainly adults. Besides, a greater proportion of these\r\nadults were men without families, another factor known to overweight\r\ncrime figures. It is a curious fact, however, that, although the Negro\r\npopulation of Chicago increased from 2.1 per cent of the total in 1914\r\nto 4.5 per cent in 1919, an increase of more than 100 per cent, the\r\nNegro crime rate during the same period increased 50 per cent, or less\r\nthan half as rapidly as the Negro population.\r\n\r\nThe court cases studied intensively by the Commission show that the\r\nmajority of Negro criminals are recruited from the lowest economic\r\nclass of the Negro group. The frequency with which these persons are\r\ntaken to the Bureau of Identification; their inability to provide\r\nbonds; their lack of means to employ attorneys, and their commitment on\r\naccount of inability to pay fines, all tend to emphasize the relation\r\nbetween poverty and crime. The economic factors, as well as the actual\r\ncommission of crime, determine largely the size of groups eligible for\r\narrest and conviction. For example, laborers are likely to contribute\r\nmore crimes proportionate to the total than salaried men, and salaried\r\nmen more than professional men. The proportion of white laboring men to\r\nthe total white population is considerably smaller than the proportion\r\nof Negro laboring men to the total Negro population. As a consequence,\r\nthe \"eligibles\" for arrest and conviction are fewer in the white group\r\nthan in the Negro group.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the City Council Committee on Crime, known as the\r\n\"Merriam Report,\" and of the Chicago Vice Commission, both indicate that\r\nthe economic factor is an important cause of both vice and crime. The\r\nfollowing is from the Vice Commission report:\r\n\r\n     Among the reasons why women or girls enter the life of\r\n     prostitution, the economic question plays a more or less\r\n     conspicuous part. The low wages paid, the long hours of\r\n     standing, insanitary conditions under which girls work in\r\n     factories--all these have a powerful effect on a woman's or\r\n     girl's nerves or physical force.\r\n\r\n     First among these causes [for prostitution] should be named\r\n     unfavorable home conditions.... Often when the home is not\r\n     entirely degraded there are conditions of crowding and poverty\r\n     which lead to misfortune. Working all day, the girls are often\r\n     obliged to work at home in the evening, and if they live in\r\n     a crowded house they must go on the street to receive their\r\n     friends. They are thus practically forced on the streets for\r\n     social life.\r\n\r\n     Among the economic conditions contributing to the social evil\r\n     are the following: low wages, insanitary conditions, too long\r\n     hours and high pressure of work; the over-crowding of houses\r\n     upon lots; of families in the house, and of persons in single\r\n     rooms.\r\n\r\nThe Merriam report similarly said:\r\n\r\n     The pressure of economic conditions has an enormous influence\r\n     in producing certain types of crime. Unsanitary housing and\r\n     working conditions, unemployment, wages inadequate to maintain\r\n     a human standard of living, inevitably produce the crushed\r\n     or distorted bodies and minds from which the army of crime\r\n     is recruited. The crime problem is not merely a question of\r\n     police and courts; it leads to the broader problem of public\r\n     sanitation, education, home care, living wages and industrial\r\n     democracy.\r\n\r\nThe greater liability of Negroes to unemployment introduces another\r\nfactor. A plant official told the Commission that his plant had dismissed\r\nmore than 500 Negro girls for business reasons. These girls, it was\r\nstated, could not easily find re-employment and were therefore probably\r\nexposed to certain necessities and temptations from which white girls\r\nof comparable status are exempt.\r\n\r\n_Ratio of convictions to arrest._--Police statistics of the relation\r\nof convictions to arrests do not involve the question of faulty source\r\nand bias and can therefore be used. They show that Negro defendants are\r\nmore frequently convicted than whites, and this difference is even more\r\npronounced in the more serious crimes. This excess ranged from 3 to 8\r\nper cent during the period 1914-19.\r\n\r\n_The Negro and sex crimes._--Examination of the records of sex offenders\r\nbrought into the criminal court in the two-year period 1917-18 showed\r\na total of 253, of whom thirty-two, or 12.6 per cent, were Negroes.\r\nThis was lower than the Negro rate, according to police statistics, for\r\nfelonies in general. The sex offenses of Negroes were committed for the\r\nmost part only against Negroes, and the specific charges were rape,\r\nattempted rape, accessory to rape, crimes against children, indecent\r\nliberties, contributing to delinquency, incest, adultery, murder by\r\nabortion, bigamy, crimes against nature, seduction, and bastardy. Of\r\ncrimes against children two out of forty-six were committed by Negroes,\r\nor about 5 per cent, substantially the proportion of Negroes to the\r\ntotal population. The figures, however, are not a reliable index either\r\nfor white or Negro crime because they include only cases passing through\r\nthe social-service department of the criminal court.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE NEGRO IN THE COURTS\r\n\r\nDuring the Commission's inquiry an effort was made to ascertain conditions\r\nin some of the various courts into which Negroes are brought; to learn\r\nthe comparative attitudes of judges, prosecutors, and policemen toward\r\nNegro and white offenders, and to learn some of the pertinent facts in\r\nthe social history of Negroes brought into these courts.\r\n\r\nIn all, 703 cases were studied, 538 white and 165 Negro. The social\r\nhistories showed a conspicuous lack of schooling in the Negroes arrested,\r\nmore than half of whom had left school before reaching the age of twelve.\r\nThis is two years below the minimum age for children in Illinois. Only\r\neight had gone beyond the fifth grade. More than 76 per cent were engaged\r\nin unskilled work, and more than 70 per cent had incomes of less than\r\n$25 a week. Few were property owners. More than 50 per cent were locked\r\nup because of inability to furnish bonds.\r\n\r\nCompared with white prisoners there was little difference in economic\r\nclass, ability to provide bonds, or legal representation. There was some\r\nnoticeable difference in the character of offenders, varying with the\r\ntype of neighborhood, but no general comparisons were possible because\r\nthe courts were selected in a manner to get the greatest number of Negro\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nWhile judges in most courts treated Negro defendants as considerately\r\nas they did whites, conditions in other courts were quite different. One\r\njudge frequently assumed an attitude of facetiousness while hearing Negro\r\ncases. The hearings were characterized by levity and lack of dignity.\r\nIn one instance the judge was shaking dice during the hearing of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. JUVENILE COURT\r\n\r\nBetween 1913 and 1919, inclusive, the number of Negro boys brought into\r\nthe juvenile court increased from 123 to 288, and the number of Negro\r\ngirls from 71 to 112. The proportion of Negro boys to the total during\r\nthis six-year period decreased from 9 to 6.8 per cent; and the proportion\r\nof Negro girls increased from 5.6 to 14.8 per cent. The proportion for\r\nNegro boys represents a little over twice the proportion of the Negroes\r\nto total population, and for Negro girls about three and one-half times.\r\nAlthough the proportion for both Negro boys and girls increased from 7.9\r\nper cent in 1913 to 9.9 per cent in 1919, the Negro population for the\r\nsame period increased over 100 per cent. The constant disproportion in\r\nthe number of Negro boys and girls coming into the juvenile court points\r\nagain to infective environment and to other circumstances heretofore\r\nmentioned involved in the crime rate for Negroes.\r\n\r\n_Northern and southern Negro delinquents._--Miss Mary Bartelme, assistant\r\nto Judge Arnold, before whom all cases of delinquent girls are tried,\r\nsaid: \"In recent years we have had a large number of colored girls who\r\nhave come up from the South to Chicago because their fathers sent for\r\nthem. Their education has not been equal to the education of white girls\r\nand their mental development has not been the same.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph L. Moss, chief probation officer in the juvenile court, believed\r\nthat Negro girls might be more affected by the war situation, the abnormal\r\nexcitement, the lure of the uniform, than white girls.\r\n\r\nMr. Moss further said:\r\n\r\n     My impression is that southern Negroes contribute just about\r\n     their portion to the total number of delinquents. If any\r\n     difference could be noted I might say that the delinquencies of\r\n     the southern Negro might be more often classed as misdemeanors\r\n     than as the more serious offenses. One noted at times a sort of\r\n     irresponsibility on the part of southern Negro delinquents which\r\n     seemed to me to be traceable to the difference in standards\r\n     between former environment and the present one.\r\n\r\n_Differences in delinquency of Negro and white children._--No information\r\ncould be secured to show that the conduct for which Negro children\r\nare brought into court is in any way different from the conduct of all\r\ndelinquent children. On this point Miss Bartelme testified: \"I get all\r\noffenses committed by girls under eighteen years of age. I want to say\r\nthat the offenses of white and colored are very much the same as far as\r\nthose offenses come before me.\" Mr. Moss testified before the Commission:\r\n\"From my experience I would say that there is no significant difference\r\nbetween acts for which colored delinquent boys are brought into court,\r\nand the acts for which white delinquent boys are brought into court, with\r\nthis exception: that larceny, as an offense, seems to have a considerable\r\nlead over other offenses.\"\r\n\r\n_Comparative environment._--Since many of the delinquent children who\r\ncome into the juvenile court, particularly first offenders, are placed\r\non probation, comparative environment of white and Negro children is\r\nimportant. This subject does not lend itself to statistical presentation,\r\nbut Miss Bartelme said:\r\n\r\n     Negro girls have not the same supervision that many of the white\r\n     girls of their same class have, because in so many instances\r\n     both parents are working, and the girls are left alone. They\r\n     come home from school to a house that is closed. There is no\r\n     one to receive them, and that, with a child, is always a very\r\n     serious matter. The environment in which they live is not\r\n     equal to the environment of the white girls. In these homes\r\n     lack of privacy is greater than in the homes of the same class\r\n     of white girls, therefore making life much more difficult and\r\n     temptations more numerous. These conditions are much worse\r\n     on account of the recent congestion, but they have existed\r\n     right along. Negro children have been allowed to live in worse\r\n     quarters, more crowded quarters, than the other children....\r\n     We feel that in placing the children on probation, especially\r\n     colored girls, they are placed in a home which often is not\r\n     a home because the mother is away at work.\r\n\r\nMr. O. J. Milliken, for many years a public-school principal in Chicago,\r\nand now superintendent of the Chicago and Cook County School for Boys,\r\nto which the milder delinquent cases are committed, testified:\r\n\r\n     I should not like to be recorded as giving a criticism of\r\n     the Board of Education, because I know that the present Board\r\n     of Education believes in what I have to say now, but this is\r\n     true: the colored boys are in the district that has practically\r\n     been abandoned by the white people and the schools are only\r\n     boxes for them to go to school in. You don't find any of the\r\n     $900,000 school buildings in the colored population district,\r\n     and I think that the time is approaching when the old system\r\n     will be changed and we will have the vocational work, etc.,\r\n     thoroughly organized in the schools in these districts where\r\n     most needed.[46] In dealing with boys I think more complaints\r\n     come along that line than in any other, and I have made a\r\n     report to the superintendent of schools on that at different\r\n     times.\r\n\r\nBoys who are \"trusties\" in the above school are allowed to secure jobs\r\nin Chicago. Their difficulties were outlined by Mr. Milliken as follows:\r\n\"After a boy has been committed by the Juvenile Court, he is known by\r\nthe police, and I have four or five colored boys today who are carrying\r\nletters from me asking the police to please allow these boys to go to\r\nwork, and if the boys are in trouble to notify our institution.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Milliken told how, when the boys are seen on the streets, they\r\nare picked up by the police. He referred to \"one of the finest lads we\r\nhave had\" and said, \"I think probably within the last three months I\r\nhave had to get him out of the hands of the police by calling up the\r\npolice department twenty times, to get him to work.\" This difficulty,\r\nin Mr. Milliken's opinion, was more common in regard to Negro than white\r\ndelinquents.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. BUREAU OF IDENTIFICATION\r\n\r\nWhile only 11.5 per cent of all persons arrested in Chicago in 1919 were\r\nNegroes, more than 21 per cent of all persons held on criminal charges\r\nin 1919 and taken to the Detective Division Identification Section were\r\nNegroes. In proportion to total arrests about twice as many Negroes as\r\nwhites were taken to the Identification Bureau. Explanations of this\r\ndisproportion by officials indirectly connected with this branch of the\r\ndepartment and familiar with its methods are illuminating.\r\n\r\nJudges of the criminal court have stated that \"Negroes look alike,\" and\r\nthat it is \"more difficult offhand to place them than it is to identify\r\na white criminal\"; that Negroes are frequently taken to the Bureau for\r\nidentification when white men would not be arrested or would be at once\r\nrecognized, picked up, and booked.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is explained that it is unquestionably safer \"to pick up\r\nand mug\" a Negro than a white person, because there is less fear of an\r\nunpleasant \"comeback.\" Negroes have fewer resources and less influence\r\nwith which to insure their fair treatment, and so are more likely to be\r\nsubjected to annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental reason, however, is perhaps more economic than racial.\r\nThe _City Council Crime Committee Report_, or \"Merriam Report,\" says:\r\n\r\n     The department of police maintains a bureau of identification\r\n     with a system of photographs and finger prints, but it is\r\n     largely a matter of chance as to who is photographed, and\r\n     as to whether the record of criminality is asked for before\r\n     he is sentenced, the judge relying largely on the statement\r\n     of the prisoner and the memory of the officer. In general,\r\n     all prisoners who are held to the Grand Jury and are not\r\n     released on bail are taken to the bureau, photographed, and\r\n     their finger prints are taken. This seems a very unfair and\r\n     illogical arrangement. If there is a reason for photographing\r\n     a man before he is tried and while he is still only a suspect,\r\n     the reason should apply equally to those in jail and those on\r\n     bail. The practice of taking the finger prints and photographs\r\n     of only the men and women who cannot afford bail, seems hard\r\n     to justify.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PROBATION AND PAROLE\r\n\r\nIt appears from the testimony of officials and others interested in the\r\ncare of offenders that the Negro on probation or parole is handicapped\r\nby his color. He is more likely to be interrogated as a suspect; is\r\nmore frequently arrested, and perhaps \"mugged,\" and is in more danger of\r\nbeing molested even while on legitimate business. The principal sources\r\nof information on this subject were:\r\n\r\n1. Statistics from the Municipal Department of Adult Probation.\r\n\r\n2. Statistics from state institutions.\r\n\r\n3. Testimony of John L. Whitman, state superintendent of prisons; John\r\nM. Houston, head of the Municipal Department of Adult Probation; and\r\nDr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent of the Central Howard Association.\r\n\r\nThe figures provided from institutions are probably accurate, since\r\nthey are based on actual count, and do not involve any of the factors\r\noverweighting crime statistics.\r\n\r\n_Number admitted to probation._--From 1911 to January 1, 1920, 27,252\r\nwhites and 1,917 Negroes were admitted to probation after conviction\r\nin the municipal and criminal courts. Negroes were thus slightly less\r\nthan 7 per cent of the total. For the six-year period ended January\r\n1, 1920, Negro arrests for misdemeanors, according to police records,\r\naveraged 8.20 per cent and for felonies 11.13 per cent. On convictions\r\nfor misdemeanors, Negroes average about 8.5 per cent of the total, and\r\nfor felonies, over 13 per cent. The percentage of Negroes among all\r\noffenders placed on probation is thus less than the percentage of Negroes\r\namong those convicted in either group. In other words, the convicted\r\nwhite man seems more likely to be put on probation than the convicted\r\nNegro.\r\n\r\nProbation depends largely upon the attitude of the judges. The total\r\nnumber of persons placed on probation has remained virtually the same\r\nfrom year to year. In fact, 164 fewer persons were put on probation in\r\n1920 than in 1919; so that the migration of southern Negroes does not\r\nseem to have affected this situation.\r\n\r\n_Extent to which probationers \"make good.\"_--There are no exact figures\r\nshowing the relative degree to which white and Negro probationers\r\njustify the leniency shown them, but Judge Houston testified before the\r\nCommission: \"I do not think there is any difference. I am satisfied that\r\nthe results are equally as good in the colored cases as in the white.\r\nI don't see any material difference between a colored man and a white\r\nman, so far as their truthfulness and reliability are concerned.\"\r\n\r\n_Institutional figures._--Official reports were submitted by the following\r\nstate correctional and penal institutions: Chester State Hospital for the\r\nCriminal Insane, Pontiac Reformatory, Southern Illinois Penitentiary at\r\nMenard, and Joliet Penitentiary. No prisoners are paroled from Chester\r\nState Hospital.\r\n\r\n     Pontiac reported that last year 45 Negroes and 294 whites had\r\n     been paroled. Of the Negroes 88 per cent, and of the whites\r\n     80 per cent, had \"made good.\"\r\n\r\n     Menard reported that 50 Negroes and 168 whites had been paroled.\r\n     Of the Negroes 76 per cent, and of the whites 81 per cent,\r\n     had \"made good.\"\r\n\r\n     Joliet reported that 61 Negroes and 223 whites had been paroled.\r\n     Of the Negroes 69 per cent, and of the whites 74 per cent,\r\n     \"made good.\"\r\n\r\nTotals for all the above institutions show that the percentages of Negro\r\nand white paroled who \"make good\" are nearly the same, the Negro rate\r\nbeing 76.9 per cent and the white 78.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Whitman, state superintendent of prisons, who has had a continuous\r\nexperience covering more than twenty-six years in correctional and penal\r\ninstitutions, testified before the Commission:\r\n\r\n     If there is a consistent effort being made to prepare inmates\r\n     of prisons for good citizenship when they are released, the\r\n     colored man responds as readily as the white, but it is a\r\n     question in my mind whether the colored man can profit as much\r\n     by it when he gets out as the white man can. That, however, is\r\n     not due to a natural inclination; perhaps his opportunities\r\n     on the outside are not as good.... I think if the reports of\r\n     those on parole from the state institutions now are closely\r\n     studied, it will be found that they have more difficulties to\r\n     surmount on the outside than the whites. If you assumed the\r\n     white and colored ex-convicts on a par when they get out, the\r\n     colored ex-convict would find it more difficult to lead the\r\n     \"straight and narrow\"--on account of the forces set against\r\n     him he is more greatly handicapped.\r\n\r\nDr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent of the Central Howard Association, an\r\norganization which for twenty years has been dealing with ex-convicts,\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n     We have found this greater difficulty in dealing with colored\r\n     men--in finding suitable rooming places within their means. Of\r\n     course we could always find rooms recommended by the colored\r\n     Y.M.C.A., or some such source as that, but generally for\r\n     desirable places charges were beyond their means.\r\n\r\n     My experience in dealing with the colored and white, and in\r\n     getting them employment, and in observing their satisfactory\r\n     fulfilment of their paroles, is that possibly a little larger\r\n     percentage of colored men make good on their paroles. They\r\n     take any kind of employment by which they can make an honest\r\n     living. I notice in our report of this year that out of 972\r\n     assisted, discharged and paroled men, ninety-two were colored\r\n     men. This would be just about 10 per cent. I think that is\r\n     probably a fair proportion each year in the history of the\r\n     Association.\r\n\r\nColonel C. B. Adams, managing officer of St. Charles School for boys,\r\nsaid: \"We have seven farm cottages.... but we rarely send a Negro boy\r\nto the farm cottage for the reason that it is almost impossible for him\r\nto secure employment on the farms. The farmers in northern Illinois....\r\nare prejudiced against colored help, and it is almost impossible for us\r\nto secure employment on the farm for a colored boy.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Clara Hayes, managing officer of the State Training School for\r\nGirls at Geneva, said: \"I think the proportion of the colored girls who\r\nare returned for one cause or another is practically the same as the\r\nproportion of white girls.... I think the proportion of those recurring\r\nfrom misconduct is practically the same.\"\r\n\r\nMr. O. J. Milliken, of the Chicago and Cook County School for boys,\r\nsaid that Negro boys equaled white boys in fulfilling satisfactorily\r\nthe requirements for those paroled.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. INSTITUTIONAL INQUIRY\r\n\r\nThrough the co-operation of John L. Whitman, state superintendent of\r\nprisons, information was secured regarding comparative treatment and\r\nconduct of white and Negro inmates of Illinois. The data covered the\r\nState Penitentiary at Joliet, Southern Illinois Penitentiary at Menard,\r\nState Reformatory at Pontiac, and State Hospital for the Criminal Insane\r\nat Chester.\r\n\r\n_Total number of prisoners._--In the total number of inmates in those\r\ninstitutions, the percentage of Negroes is much larger than the percentage\r\nconvicted of felonies in Chicago. The percentage of Negroes among all\r\npersons convicted of felonies in Chicago for a six-year period averaged\r\n13.1 per cent, whereas their proportion among all inmates of these prisons\r\nis about 23 per cent. Omitting the Southern Illinois Penitentiary, the\r\nproportion is about 20 per cent. This disproportion is in part explained\r\nby facts brought out elsewhere showing that Negroes receive much longer\r\nsentences and fewer paroles (see p. 330).\r\n\r\nAll these institutions reported that in no cases were Negro and white\r\nprisoners kept in the same cells. Mr. Whitman stated that this arrangement\r\nwas preferred by both whites and Negroes. Negro and white prisoners are\r\nnot segregated in separate cell sections but occupy adjoining cells in\r\nthe same block. \"They are all in the same cell house; they are together\r\nin the shops; in cottages; in the farm where there are dormitories.\"\r\n\r\nNegro and white prisoners eat in the same dining-room at the same time\r\nand at the same table. \"The tables are for six or eight and there will be\r\ncolored and white at the same table.\" They also attend public meetings\r\ntogether. Mr. Whitman also stated that in all the institutions Negroes\r\nand whites mingled without distinction, and that the result had been\r\nsatisfactory. There was no difference in food, clothing, employment,\r\ncells, or discipline for Negro prisoners as a group from that of white\r\nprisoners because of the Negro's character or deportment. In no case was\r\nracial discrimination in such matters used as a means of discipline or\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n_Conduct in prison._--There is no exact system for appraising conduct\r\nwithin the prison, but at Mr. Whitman's request persons were appointed\r\nin each institution to examine the record of each inmate as to conduct\r\nand tabulate the results. These and other data secured by Superintendent\r\nWhitman indicate that Negroes are less amenable to prison discipline\r\nthan whites, but that their violations of rules are not so grave.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of Negro inmates whose conduct was marked \"satisfactory\"\r\nwas smaller in all institutions than the percentage of whites. At Pontiac\r\nthe difference in conduct was negligible. The greatest disparity was in\r\nMenard (in the southern part of the state), where the difference amounted\r\nto more than 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. OTHER CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n_St. Charles School for Boys_ receives delinquent boys between ten and\r\nseventeen years of age from the whole state. Negro and white boys are\r\naccepted up to the capacity limit. Negro boys are 12.5 per cent of the\r\ntotal, or slightly above the proportion which the Cook County Juvenile\r\nCourt report shows Negro boys bear to the total of delinquent boys. Since\r\n1915, the Negro population at St. Charles has increased from 8 per cent\r\nto 12.5 per cent of the total, or approximately half as rapidly as the\r\nNegro population in Chicago. St. Charles is conducted on the cottage\r\nplan, there being twenty-two cottages. Negro and white boys live in the\r\nsame cottage, eat in the same dining-room, and use the same playground.\r\n\r\nFour out of the twelve cadet companies have Negro captains, and these have\r\nmore white than Negro boys under them. There are no racial difficulties\r\nin regard to employment or discipline, and the general conduct of Negro\r\nand white boys was reported to be the same. Colonel C. B. Adams, managing\r\nofficer, said: \"I really think mentally, and I am sure physically, the\r\ncolored boys, such as come into the institution today, are superior to\r\nthe white boys. We make much of athletics in the school and the best\r\nathletes we have are colored boys.\"\r\n\r\n_Geneva State Training School for Girls_ had 417 girls in 1917, 475 in\r\n1918, and 445 in 1920. The increase over 1917 is proportionately the same\r\nfor white and Negro girls. In 1920, out of 445 girls, eighty-three, or\r\nabout 18.5 per cent, were Negro. Conditions at Geneva are substantially\r\nsimilar to those at St. Charles, with the exception that in one cottage,\r\nNegro and white girls eat at different tables. This, the managing officer,\r\nDr. Clara B. Hayes, says is mutually agreeable. No difficulties exist\r\nwith regard to employment or discipline. As to conduct on probation and\r\nparole, Dr. Hayes thought there was no material difference between Negro\r\nand white girls.\r\n\r\n_Chicago and Cook County School for Boys._ This school is located in\r\nRiverside, just west of Chicago, on a farm belonging to the City of\r\nChicago. The county feeds and clothes the boys; the city erects the\r\nbuildings, and the Board of Education manages the school and pays all\r\nsalaries. There are three buildings holding forty boys each. About 600\r\nboys go through the institution in a year. It is a \"testing out\" school\r\nand working boys' institution to which first offenders between the ages\r\nof ten and eighteen are committed through the juvenile court. In 1919\r\nthe Negro boys were 15 per cent of the total; in 1920, less than 7 per\r\ncent. This decline Mr. Milliken, the managing officer, thought to be\r\ndue to the cessation of Negro migration.\r\n\r\nThe treatment accorded Negro boys in cottages and at meals, play, and\r\nwork is identical with that given white boys. There is no difference in\r\ndiscipline. Race prejudice is not prominent, and the boys are said to be\r\nmost democratic with each other regardless of color. The director says:\r\n\"They work together, beautifully; the idea [of prejudice] never enters\r\ninto their heads. I think it is the outside influence that brings about\r\nthese conditions [of prejudice].\"\r\n\r\n_Chicago Parental School._ To this school, situated on the North Side of\r\nthe city, truants from the public schools of Chicago are committed by\r\nthe juvenile court. The total number of pupils last year included 993\r\nboys and eighteen girls. The Negro boys numbered eighty and the Negro\r\ngirls five.\r\n\r\nThe treatment accorded white and Negro children is the same. No difference\r\nin regard to discipline or punishment exists. Race prejudice is not\r\napparent, and the children's attitude toward each other seems not to\r\nbe influenced by color. The deportment of Negro and white children is\r\nreported to be the same.\r\n\r\n_House of Correction._ To this institution adult misdemeanants are\r\ncommitted. Information concerning conditions was furnished by Joseph\r\nSiman, superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe total number of inmates in 1919 was 5,723, and 1,151, or more than\r\n20 per cent, were Negroes. This percentage is larger than the percentages\r\nof Negroes among persons arrested on misdemeanor charges and among those\r\nconvicted.\r\n\r\nNegro inmates are not put in the same cells with whites, but are\r\nfrequently lodged in the same tier of cells. There are separate blocks\r\nof cells, but no separate tiers for whites and Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners eat together in the same dining-room. They march from\r\ntheir cells or work to meals, meetings, and church services and usually\r\nsit in the same order as that in which they march.\r\n\r\nNo race prejudice is noticeable among prisoners, and no racial clashes\r\nor unpleasant experiences have occurred in the institution.\r\n\r\n_Cook County Jail._ The greatest discrimination noted in the course of\r\nthe institution inquiry was at the Cook County Jail, where segregation\r\nhas been carried out in nearly every department. The statements below\r\nare based on interviews with Chief Deputy Sheriff Laubenheimer and with\r\nMr. King of the sheriff's office, who was chief clerk at the jail at\r\nthe time of this study.\r\n\r\nNegroes are completely segregated in cells on the first two floors in\r\nthe new jail. Sometimes, when the jail is crowded, a few Negroes are\r\nput in among the whites, but whites are not often put in the part of the\r\njail where Negroes are segregated. A condemned Negro murderer is placed\r\nwith white condemned murderers in the section set apart for condemned\r\nmurderers. Similarly Negro boys are placed with white boys in the boys'\r\nsection of the jail.\r\n\r\nMeals are served to all prisoners in their cells. The Negroes have a\r\nseparate \"bull pen\" for exercise but are given the same facilities as the\r\nwhites. They have separate church services. Negro guards have charge of\r\nthe Negro prisoners. The conduct of Negroes, according to the observation\r\nof Mr. King, is practically the same as that of the whites.\r\n\r\nOut of a total of 8,616 inmates in the county jail in 1919 there were\r\n1,655 Negroes, or about 19 per cent. This is larger than the proportion of\r\nNegroes among all arrested or convicted. The report of the City Council\r\nCrime Committee showed that inmates of the county jail were confined\r\nthere to a large extent on account of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. NEGRO CRIME AND ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n_Housing._--Housing must be considered as an important element in the\r\nenvironmental causes of crime. Elsewhere this report presents a more\r\ndetailed study of housing and it will suffice here to call attention to\r\nthe prevalence of taking lodgers which is economically necessary in many\r\nNegro homes, and the consequent danger to the integrity of the family;\r\nto the laxity of law enforcement in certain sections; to the condition\r\nof streets and alleys; and to frequent instances of defective housing\r\nwhich have the effect of driving the children into the streets or to\r\nquestionable places of amusement.\r\n\r\n_Recreation._--A comprehensive inquiry into the relations between\r\nrecreation and delinquency, made by the Cleveland Foundation in 1917,\r\nshowed that the use of leisure time had a relation to delinquency in\r\n75 per cent of the cases observed, and that 51 per cent of the leisure\r\ntime of the delinquent child was spent in ways that were aimless and\r\nundirected; while in the case of the \"wholesome\" child, only seven-tenths\r\nof 1 per cent of the spare time was thus spent. Local studies made by\r\nT. J. Szmergalski, of the West Chicago Park Commission, show that the\r\nestablishment of a supervised park or playground tends to decrease\r\ncomplaints of delinquency from 30 to 40 per cent within the range of its\r\nusefulness--a radius of about three-quarters of a mile. With these facts\r\nas a background it is significant that there is no recreation center and\r\nonly a few small playgrounds freely available for Negro children within\r\nthe congested Negro district. In many of the crowded areas inhabited by\r\nforeign colonies are well-equipped recreation centers with model field\r\nhouses, used by thousands of persons from these districts. The facilities\r\navailable to Negro children and young people in this respect are much\r\nless adequate.[48]\r\n\r\nBathing-beaches, which are a summer-time boon to Chicago residents,\r\nforeign and native, are not freely accessible to Negroes. The tragic\r\nincidents in which the riot of 1919 began, illustrate the discriminatory\r\nattitude frequently observed when Negroes attempt to enjoy some of these\r\nrecreational facilities.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these recreation opportunities is further emphasized in\r\nthe _Annual Report of the Crime Commission_ in its section on recreation.\r\n\r\n     The answer to the lack of a sufficient number of well-ordered\r\n     places of recreation and amusement is to be found in the\r\n     thriving condition of Chicago's cheap dance halls, underworld\r\n     cabarets, unsupervised movie theatres of the cheaper class\r\n     and the large number of pool-rooms scattered throughout the\r\n     city. These establishments are the worst breeders of crime\r\n     with which this community has to contend and they should\r\n     be subjected to rigid police regulations on the part of the\r\n     municipal authorities.\r\n\r\n     The chief counteracting influences of such places of amusement\r\n     are the parks, playgrounds and other municipal recreation\r\n     centers, and there is a great need for the establishment of\r\n     more of these, particularly in the congested districts.\r\n\r\n_Psychological._--It is the opinion of criminologists that a \"warped\"\r\nmind is responsible for many crimes. This general condition is true of\r\nNegroes as well as whites. But another factor appears in many crimes\r\nof Negroes. The traditional ostracism, exploitation and petty daily\r\ninsults to which they are continually exposed have doubtless provoked,\r\neven in normal-minded Negroes, a pathological attitude toward society\r\nwhich sometimes expresses itself defensively in acts of violence and\r\nother lawlessness. A desire for social revenge might well be expected\r\nto result from the facetious and insulting manner in which Negroes are\r\noften treated by officers of the law.\r\n\r\n_\"Infective\" environment._--Much of what is said in the _Annual Report\r\nof the Crime Commission_ for 1920 regarding the relation of infective\r\nenvironment to crime, can be fairly applied to the congested South Side\r\nareas of Negro residence:\r\n\r\n     Infective environment as a cause of crime is classified\r\n     separately from problems of home environment because where the\r\n     latter may be conducive to the proper rearing of children into\r\n     manhood and womanhood, the influence immediately outside the\r\n     home may be exactly the opposite. There are, in a great city\r\n     like Chicago, certain neighborhoods in which influences are at\r\n     work continuously to produce criminals. While the production\r\n     of criminals is by no means confined to any one section of the\r\n     city but is widespread throughout the community, still there\r\n     are sections in which conditions are such that the growing\r\n     child is indeed fortunate if he can attain manhood without\r\n     being led to commit some offense against society.\r\n\r\n     In Chicago our chief district of this character is, or was\r\n     until recently at least, \"Canaryville\" and much of the other\r\n     territory immediately adjacent to the Stock Yards. It was this\r\n     section which produced \"Moss\" Enright, \"Sonny\" Dunn, Eugene\r\n     Geary, the Gentlemen brothers and many others of Chicago's\r\n     worst type of criminals. It is in this district that \"athletic\r\n     clubs\" and other organizations of young toughs and gangsters\r\n     flourish, and where disreputable poolrooms, hoodlum-infested\r\n     saloons and other criminal hangouts are plentiful.\r\n\r\n     Often it has been the case that public officials having such\r\n     constituencies have utilized these conditions to further their\r\n     own political advantages without making the slightest effort\r\n     to bring about improvements, in some instances, actually\r\n     assisting their constituents to violate the law in order to aid\r\n     the building up of their political machines.... Improvement\r\n     of districts of this character and the elimination of such\r\n     conditions within them is highly essential if organized crime\r\n     is to be reduced.\r\n\r\n_Vice._--Vice districts and Negro residence districts are now and have\r\nlong been close together. As late as 1905 a segregated vice district was\r\ntolerated on the West Side, on Green, Peoria, Sangamon, Morgan, Curtis,\r\nCarpenter, and Randolph streets, and Washington Boulevard. Just north\r\nof this district on Lake, Walnut, and Fulton streets, lived Negroes,\r\nsegregated by public sentiment. Another vice district was along Custom\r\nHouse Place, now Federal Street, near which Negroes lived, similarly\r\nsegregated by public sentiment. When this vice district was moved\r\nsouthward to Twenty-second Street it had a fringe of Negro residence.\r\nLater this district was abolished, and now vice of this kind is scattered\r\nand more clandestine and is to be found farther south, largely between\r\nThirty-first and Fifty-fifth streets. More than 75 per cent of the Negro\r\npopulation of the city lives in this area.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ENVIRONMENT OF THE SOUTH SIDE NEGRO\r\n   NO. 1\r\n   HOUSES OF PROSTITUTION\r\n   1916\r\n   DEALT WITH BY THE MORALS COURT AND THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN.

THE AREA\r\n   OUTLINED IN BLACK SHOWS THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RECOGNIZED SEGREGATED VICE\r\n   DISTRICT WHICH WAS IN EXISTENCE UP TO NOVEMBER, 1912.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the proximity of Negro residence areas to vice areas, the\r\nChicago Vice Commission report in 1911 said:\r\n\r\n     The history of the social evil in Chicago is intimately\r\n     connected with the colored population. Invariably the large\r\n     vice districts have been created within or near the settlements\r\n     of colored people. In the past history of the city every time\r\n     a new vice district was created downtown or on the South Side,\r\n     the colored families were in the district, moving in just\r\n     ahead of the prostitutes. The situation along State Street\r\n     from Sixteenth Street south is an illustration.\r\n\r\n     So whenever prostitutes, cadets and thugs were located among\r\n     white people and had to be moved for commercial or other\r\n     reasons, they were driven to undesirable parts of the city;\r\n     the so-called colored residential sections.\r\n\r\nThe chief of police in 1912 warned prostitutes that so long as they\r\nconfined their residence to districts west of Wabash Avenue and east of\r\nWentworth Avenue, they would not be disturbed. This area contained at\r\nthat time the largest group of Negroes in the city, with most of their\r\nchurches, Sunday schools, and societies.\r\n\r\nThe Vice Commission report further said:\r\n\r\n     In addition to this proximity to immoral conditions young\r\n     colored girls are often forced into idleness because of\r\n     prejudice against them and they are eventually forced to accept\r\n     positions as maids in houses of prostitution.\r\n\r\n     Employment agents do not hesitate to send colored girls as\r\n     servants to these houses. They make the astounding statement\r\n     that the law does not allow them to send white girls, but they\r\n     will furnish colored help.\r\n\r\n     In summing up, it is an appalling fact that practically all\r\n     of the male and female servants connected with houses of\r\n     prostitution in vice districts and in disorderly flats in\r\n     residence sections are colored....\r\n\r\n     The apparent discrimination against colored citizens of the\r\n     city in permitting vice to be set down in their very midst\r\n     is unjust and abhorrent to all fair-minded people. Colored\r\n     children should receive the same moral protection that white\r\n     children receive.\r\n\r\n     The prejudice against colored girls who are ambitious to earn\r\n     an honest living is unjust. Such an attitude eventually drives\r\n     them into immoral surroundings. They need special care and\r\n     protection on the maxim that it is the duty of the strong to\r\n     help the weak. Any effort, therefore, to improve conditions\r\n     in Chicago should provide more wholesome surroundings for the\r\n     families of its colored citizens who now live in communities\r\n     of colored people.\r\n\r\nThat many Negroes live near vice districts is not due to their choice nor\r\nto low moral standards, but to three causes: (1) Negroes are unwelcome\r\nin desirable white residence localities; (2) small incomes compel them\r\nto live in the least expensive places regardless of surroundings; while\r\npremises rented for immoral purposes bring notoriously high rentals,\r\nthey make the neighborhood undesirable and the rent of other living\r\nquarters there abnormally low; and (3) Negroes lack sufficient influence\r\nand power to protest effectively against the encroachments of vice.\r\n\r\nThe records of convictions in the morals court and the evidence of the\r\nCommittee of Fifteen show the gradual drift of prostitution southward\r\ncoincidentally with the expansions of the main area of Negro residence.\r\n\r\nBetween 1916 and 1918 houses of prostitution decreased from forty-eight to\r\ntwenty-five in number in the territory between Twelfth and Twenty-second\r\nstreets, and from 130 to 107 between Twelfth and Thirty-first streets.\r\nBetween Thirty-first and Thirty-fifth streets, the number had slightly\r\nincreased, while there was an increase of nearly 80 per cent between\r\nThirty-fifth and Thirty-ninth streets. In the combined districts between\r\nThirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets the number increased from sixty-two\r\nto eighty-four; and between Thirty-ninth and Fifty-fifth streets the\r\nincrease was from eleven to fifty-four.\r\n\r\nThese are probably only a fraction of the number that really exist there,\r\nand while they are too few to be conclusive, they are significant when\r\nconsidered in relation to the movement of the Negro population. The\r\naccompanying maps show that the figures coincide substantially with the\r\nexpansion of Negro residence areas southward and eastward.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of this movement of vicious resorts, and an abnormally\r\nlarge number of them, into the Negro areas was obtained from the state's\r\nattorney's office, the Commission's investigations, and from confidential\r\nreports submitted by other organizations. Most of these places are\r\nmaintained by white persons, because in this district there is less\r\nlikelihood of effective interference, either from citizens or public\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n_Cabarets and gambling._--In close relation to the disorderly houses\r\nare the vicious cabarets in the Negro areas on the South Side. Their\r\nreputation and the conditions existing in them have been given much\r\npublicity by the local press.\r\n\r\nGambling was found to be prevalent at many places in this section, and\r\nonly slight effort was made to conceal violations of the law. Under the\r\nguise of \"clubs\" some places were being operated as gambling houses with\r\ndice and card games predominating. Other places, apparently with little\r\nfear of the police, both conducted and permitted gambling with cards\r\nand on pool games. Baseball pools and \"policy,\" as well as betting on\r\nhorse-race returns, were prevalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. VIEWS OF AUTHORITIES ON CRIME AMONG NEGROES\r\n\r\nMuch information was secured from conferences with numerous authorities on\r\ncrime: judges of the juvenile, municipal, circuit, superior and criminal\r\ncourts; the general superintendent of police and police captains, former\r\nhigh police officials; heads of correctional and penal institutions;\r\nthe state's attorney; experts on probation and parole, representatives\r\nfrom the sheriff's office; and social workers having intimate knowledge\r\nof crime conditions.\r\n\r\nThe views of those authorities are an important aid in giving proper\r\ninterpretation to the factors which cause crime among Negroes, and to the\r\ncircumstances connected with crime prejudicial to Negroes as compared\r\nwith whites. For example, the testimony is practically unanimous that\r\nNegroes are much more liable to arrest than whites, since police officers\r\nshare in the general public opinion that Negroes \"are more criminal than\r\nwhites,\" and also feel that there is little risk of trouble in arresting\r\nNegroes, while greater care must be exercised in arresting whites.\r\n\r\nThe Negro crime rate is exaggerated quite as much by the fewer arrests of\r\nwhites than Negroes, in comparison with the number of crimes committed,\r\nas by the ease with which many Negroes may be arrested for one crime. We\r\nhave already noted the remarkable discrepancy between the police reports\r\nof crimes committed and the actual crimes listed by the Crime Commission.\r\nFewer Negroes than whites escape arrest and prosecution. When comparisons\r\nare made on the basis of statistics for arrests and convictions, there\r\nis presented, unless proper explanations of the statistics are made, an\r\nexaggerated picture of Negro crime.\r\n\r\nThe views of many of these authorities on various branches of this\r\ninquiry are here given:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FEWER PROFESSIONAL AND BANDED CRIMINALS AMONG NEGROES\r\n\r\nJudge Edmund Jarecki, municipal court:\r\n\r\n     I know of no built-up organization of Negroes that would have\r\n     any particular control over criminals.\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude, municipal court:\r\n\r\n     I think Negro criminals are more isolated. My experience in\r\n     the boys' court was with the colored boys who would go out\r\n     and steal clothes, a new shirt or some socks, or something\r\n     of that sort that they could pick off the back porch. I found\r\n     that there was considerable of that, but they are very partial\r\n     and take from their own people.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson, criminal court:\r\n\r\n     Negro crime is not organized, but individual, I should say,\r\n     almost without exception.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan, criminal court:\r\n\r\n     In May, 1920, I was assigned to the North Side to try some\r\n     unbailable murder cases. It was found that there were over\r\n     500 homicide cases ... these were nearly all cases in which\r\n     gangs of young white men confederated together to go out and\r\n     hold up places, and they made a business of it, and some of\r\n     these gangs have committed any number of hold-ups, and one\r\n     member of the gang explained that he had killed as many as\r\n     twenty victims. The evidence showed that they killed when they\r\n     didn't have to kill, just recklessly and wantonly. In none of\r\n     the cases of the character I have talked about were there any\r\n     colored defendants. They were all white men ... there were\r\n     some of the most vicious cases I know anything about in my\r\n     thirty-four years of experience.\r\n\r\n     I just want to make that one point to this Commission, that\r\n     never in the history of this community has the white race\r\n     stood so low from the standpoint of crime as it does at the\r\n     present time. White young men are banding together in gangs\r\n     and deliberately going out and holding people up, right and\r\n     left, and shooting them down. I notice that there are a few\r\n     colored imitators of the white men, but the bad man of the\r\n     city of Chicago at the present time is the young white man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Leroy T. Steward, former chief of police:\r\n\r\n     I think generally speaking that the Negro criminals work as\r\n     individuals. I only recall one instance where there was a gang\r\n     of colored men that came to my attention, but I know of many\r\n     white gangs.\r\n\r\nDr. Herman Adler, state criminologist:\r\n\r\n     You asked a question in regard to gangs--whether there is a\r\n     combination among Negroes. There are not many. They are more\r\n     individual, but on the other hand the lower grade of Negroes\r\n     are likely to be the tools of the others at times; they have\r\n     been used that way. Where you are dealing with murder, with\r\n     sex crimes, with certain forms of burglary, larceny, you are\r\n     usually dealing with individual criminals....\r\n\r\n     Now there is here, in Chicago, professional organized crime.\r\n     The colored people as a whole are less engaged in professional\r\n     crime and they are more the accidental, casual criminal or the\r\n     low-grade person with a strong temper and a strong physique\r\n     etc., who slips into crime by following the line of least\r\n     resistance.\r\n\r\nMajor L. M. C. Funkhouser:\r\n\r\n     Negro criminals are not organized.\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles E. Merriam:\r\n\r\n     My belief is that the Negro criminals are not so well organized\r\n     as the white. They don't go much in bands; furthermore, they\r\n     are not so much in the class of professional criminals as they\r\n     are in the class of occasional criminals. It seems to me that\r\n     the colored offender is the individual offender; his crimes\r\n     are more of haste or passion. He is in the occasional offender\r\n     class.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ENVIRONMENT OF THE SOUTH SIDE NEGRO\r\n   NO. 3\r\n   RESORTS\r\n   SUMMER OF 1919]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SEX CRIME AMONG NEGROES AS COMPARED WITH WHITES\r\n\r\nJudge Edmund Jarecki:\r\n\r\n     So far as sex crimes are concerned, during the time I have\r\n     been there [in the boys' court] I have not noticed anything\r\n     that would indicate any difference between colored and white\r\n     boys.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson:\r\n\r\n     In my work with the criminal court, I was astonished at\r\n     the large number of criminals involving the sexual abuse of\r\n     children, but I remember no case in which a colored defendant\r\n     was charged with that crime. Almost all races were represented,\r\n     but I don't remember one colored man charged with the abuse\r\n     of a child. There were many, however, accused of adultery.\r\n\r\nJudge Hugo Pam, criminal court:\r\n\r\n     I have had more serious rape cases against white than against\r\n     colored people. The most serious case I had was about ten days\r\n     ago, and I sentenced the man to life imprisonment. I never\r\n     had such a case involving a Negro.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan, criminal court:\r\n\r\n     I do not think Negroes are more liable to sex crimes than\r\n     whites. I tried a colored man six or eight years ago for rape.\r\n     He founded an alleged orphan asylum. The evidence showed that\r\n     he had held a number of young children in that place. He got\r\n     life in the penitentiary. He was the only colored man ever tried\r\n     before me with any offense of that character. The children in\r\n     that case were colored children. But I have tried a number of\r\n     white men for rape, and while I have had ten or a dozen cases\r\n     of crimes against children, in my twelve years' experience on\r\n     the bench, I have never had a case of a colored man charged\r\n     with crime against children.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. OFFENSES AGAINST MORALS\r\n\r\nJudge Arnold Heap:\r\n\r\n     The number of colored cases in the morals court is largely\r\n     disproportionate to the number of Negroes in the total Chicago\r\n     population. There are more colored cases now in the morals\r\n     court than formerly because in the past the houses kept by\r\n     white people with colored inmates were alone held responsible.\r\n     Since colored people are now doing business on their own\r\n     responsibility, they are at present brought in the same as\r\n     white people. At first the Negro newcomers were strangers to\r\n     our surroundings and were not such frequent offenders, but as\r\n     that strangeness wore off they became familiar with vice as\r\n     it exists among us today. The offenses of these new comers are\r\n     about the same as those of the northern Negroes. Some persons\r\n     think that the immorality of the colored is more gross than\r\n     that of the whites, but I have my doubts about it. One factor\r\n     in the problem is that colored people of the poorer class crowd\r\n     together in smaller quarters than whites, and this tends to\r\n     a lesser type of morality because they are so crowded.\r\n\r\nJudge Wells M. Cook, municipal court:\r\n\r\n     Prostitution among the white people in Chicago in 1918 was more\r\n     or less clandestine, in flats and cheap hotels and in private\r\n     homes, and more or less under cover. The colored people, living\r\n     largely in one section of the city, and being naturally of a\r\n     social, emotional temperament, are apt to congregate in places\r\n     and in resorts where the police could more easily raid them,\r\n     and are much more easily apprehended. That is about the only\r\n     reason I can see for the disproportionate number of colored\r\n     defendants brought into the morals court. It is not that there\r\n     is any greater percentage of immorality, but prostitution\r\n     among whites was more clandestine.\r\n\r\nO. J. Milliken, superintendent, Chicago and Cook County School for\r\nDelinquent Boys:\r\n\r\n     I don't think that homosexual relations are a racial matter\r\n     with the boys. The sex problem, I think, doesn't manifest\r\n     itself between races as much as it does in the lower classes\r\n     of whites that come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. LYING AND STEALING\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     \"I think the colored man, if he is not a desirable citizen, is\r\n     undesirable because he has not been given a chance; he has not\r\n     been given the advantages that a white fellow has from birth.\"\r\n     Judge Trude agreed with the view expressed in a question that\r\n     if the Negro were found careless as to the truth and as to\r\n     his promises, it was due to his heredity and lack of training\r\n     rather than anything inherently bad in him.\r\n\r\nJudge Wells M. Cook:\r\n\r\n     I think there is a great deal of nonsense in the talk about\r\n     the colored man being more apt to lie or steal than the white\r\n     man. I think that is largely a question of environment and\r\n     training. He is not more inclined, in my judgment, to tell a\r\n     lie or steal than a white man.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson:\r\n\r\n     I would say there is a far larger number of larceny cases\r\n     involving the white than the colored man, even in proportion\r\n     to the population. The larger proportion of cases involving\r\n     the colored is in having to do with fights, involving murder\r\n     in some instances.\r\n\r\nJudge Edmund Jarecki:\r\n\r\n     No, I don't think Negroes are more likely to be guilty of\r\n     theft than whites; that is not usually the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. TYPES OF NEGRO CRIMES\r\n\r\nJudge Hugo Pam:\r\n\r\n     The colored man is frequently charged with robbery with a gun,\r\n     and a great many have guns. Relatively speaking, more colored\r\n     men have guns than white men.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan:\r\n\r\n     The most prevalent crimes or types of crimes amongst Negroes,\r\n     according to my observation, are gambling, assault cases,\r\n     caused by drinking or women, petty theft.\r\n\r\nF. Emory Lyon, superintendent, Central Howard Association:\r\n\r\n     My experience in dealing with colored offenders would indicate\r\n     a slightly larger proportion of crimes of violence than in\r\n     the case of white men.\r\n\r\nDr. Clara Hayes, Geneva School for Delinquent Girls:\r\n\r\n     I think there is a little more tendency on the part of colored\r\n     inmates toward violence than there is among white girls. I\r\n     mean such misconduct as attacks on other girls, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. MENTAL\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     I today received a letter from a young colored man who has\r\n     been in the boys' court several times. His father is a mental\r\n     defective, and he is a mental defective. That is the reason\r\n     he keeps committing these crimes. He is in the Dixon Home for\r\n     Feeble Minded. There are a number of colored boys that come up\r\n     from the South that way, and it is my judgment that southern\r\n     institutions are turning them loose. I think Illinois does as\r\n     well as other states. They all discharge mental defectives as\r\n     cured, and they wander all over the face of the earth, in and\r\n     out of other institutions.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson:\r\n\r\n     As a rule the mentality of colored offenders was not high.\r\n     I had a few cases where the reverse was true, and one which\r\n     involved a man who was as smart a man as I ever tried.\r\n\r\nMary Bartelme, associate judge of the juvenile court:\r\n\r\n     As to mentality, I would say that in recent years we have had\r\n     a large number of girls who have come up to Chicago from the\r\n     South and their educations have not been equal to the educations\r\n     of the white girls and their mental development has not been\r\n     the same.\r\n\r\nDr. Herman Adler:\r\n\r\n     At Pontiac we find in general that the average of intelligence\r\n     in the colored people is rather less than in the whites. Take\r\n     the white people separately and you will find about the same\r\n     proportion of low grades as in the colored race. In actual\r\n     group comparison, the colored race is somewhat below that of\r\n     the whites. That is, in general the distribution is about the\r\n     same, but there is always a slight lag of the colored below\r\n     the white. The lower the intelligence, on the whole, the more\r\n     likely it is that the individual is in the institution for a\r\n     crime of violence or a sex crime or incendiarism; the higher\r\n     the intelligence, the more likely that the crime is forgery\r\n     or some crime involving fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. CHANGE IN CHARACTER OF CRIME OR INCREASE IN CRIME DUE TO MIGRATION\r\n\r\nJudge Hugh Stewart:\r\n\r\n     I am of the impression that the colored men from the South\r\n     are in the courts in larger numbers than are those who have\r\n     lived here a long time.... A great many of the colored people\r\n     from the South are very dark skinned, and there is a larger\r\n     proportion, in my estimation, of offenses among dark-skinned\r\n     colored people than among those of the light color. I sometimes\r\n     try to trace out where they come from. I find a great many of\r\n     these cases come from the South.\r\n\r\n     I think there is a difference between offenses committed by\r\n     colored persons from the South and colored persons who have\r\n     resided for a long time in the North. I think there are more\r\n     hold-ups and burglaries committed by men who come from the\r\n     South than by the colored population before the influx.\r\n\r\n     I am of the opinion that Negroes who have recently come from\r\n     the South and find their way into the police courts do not\r\n     typify or reflect the general character of the southern Negroes\r\n     as a class, any more than the white people who find their way\r\n     into the police courts typify other whites who manage to keep\r\n     out of them.\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     It was frequently true that the boys would jump freights from\r\n     down South and come up here and be picked up and brought into\r\n     court and be left in jail for a while with nobody to keep\r\n     after them, or furnish bail. The South has never given the\r\n     Negro adequate educational advantages, so they come up here\r\n     more or less uneducated, many of them, and they are not given\r\n     a helping hand as they should be.\r\n\r\n     In the boys' court the number of southern boys recently arrived\r\n     in Chicago was startling. While I was in the boys' court, I\r\n     made it a practice to give every one of them a card to the\r\n     Urban League, so that they would know where to go to get advice\r\n     on any difficulty.\r\n\r\nJudge Wells M. Cook:\r\n\r\n     I would say that of the colored men and women brought into court\r\n     in the summer of 1918, the greater percentage were colored\r\n     people who had recently come to Chicago. In most instances\r\n     the colored man brought in had money; he was receiving more\r\n     wages than in the South; the city was \"wet\"; he had come\r\n     from districts in the South where he could not get whiskey;\r\n     in a great many instances he had not brought his wife and\r\n     family with him, so he was easy prey for those engaged in\r\n     commercial sexual vice. In consequence he would be arrested\r\n     in these raids, made usually by the police on the night\r\n     when the underworld was supposed to be the busiest, usually\r\n     Saturday and Sunday nights. I do not think there are any more\r\n     vicious colored men than there are vicious white men, but the\r\n     colored man who was brought in largely was a newcomer. There\r\n     had been no particular increase in vice that I observed among\r\n     the native-born colored people or the man who had come to\r\n     Chicago a reasonable number of years back. As to the women,\r\n     they were almost entirely typical southern prostitutes, who\r\n     had come here from New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta,\r\n     Galveston, and other large cities in the South, attracted to\r\n     Chicago by reason of the fact there were a lot of colored men\r\n     up here who were making good money. I would say that so far\r\n     as the colored women of Chicago were concerned, there was no\r\n     noticeable increase in immorality among them.\r\n\r\nMr. O. J. Milliken:\r\n\r\n     In 1919, we ran up to 15 per cent colored. This year, 1920, it\r\n     is less than 7 per cent. The reason is found in the boys from\r\n     the South. They have stopped coming now and we are getting back\r\n     to normal. The boys from the South have been very illiterate.\r\n     We have received a number who could not write their own names\r\n     and would almost be counted subnormal on first examination\r\n     but are often found to be very bright. A great many asked to\r\n     come back or asked to remain in the institution until they\r\n     could get some education. I never noticed any difference as\r\n     to color in the handling of the boys in any department.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. LIABILITY OF THE NEGRO TO ARREST\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     I think that at the time of the riot there was more disposition\r\n     on the part of the officers to make arrests of colored\r\n     offenders, frequently for protection. I think it was due to\r\n     what Dr. Shepardson used to call, out at the University, \"the\r\n     mind of the mob\"--a disturbed view of things which makes one\r\n     likely to go too far one way or the other. These people were\r\n     that way. They had to arrest a certain number and try to check\r\n     the riot, and they went too far in many cases.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson:\r\n\r\n     I have seen cases where Negroes were arrested on suspicion; I\r\n     would not say there was any large proportion. I remember one\r\n     case was a young colored fellow arrested purely on suspicion.\r\n     The jury disagreed the first time. The next time he was tried\r\n     before me, and the jury found him guilty. Because it was a\r\n     second trial, and because of the disagreement, I watched it\r\n     very carefully as the evidence went in, and I became convinced\r\n     that it was a pure case of the officers having had some trouble\r\n     with this fellow before. A crime occurred in their district,\r\n     and they pounced on this chap. I felt pretty sure he was not\r\n     guilty. The state's attorney called the trial off. He became\r\n     convinced himself.\r\n\r\nMr. O. J. Milliken:\r\n\r\n     After a boy has been committed by the juvenile court, he is\r\n     known to the police, and I have four or five colored boys today\r\n     who are carrying letters from me asking that the police will\r\n     please allow these boys to go to work. Prejudice on the part\r\n     of the police in picking up alleged offenders is more apt to\r\n     occur against Negroes than whites.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan:\r\n\r\n     Negroes are more likely to be arrested on suspicion than white\r\n     persons. If you will tell me why race prejudice exists in\r\n     this world, I will tell you why this is so. I don't think the\r\n     police are quite as careful with reference to the rights of\r\n     the colored man as with the white man. I think they hesitate\r\n     a little longer when a white man is involved; I am certain\r\n     that it is so.\r\n\r\nState's Attorney Maclay Hoyne:\r\n\r\n     In the race riots, the police arrested almost exclusively\r\n     Negroes, and practically no white men.\r\n\r\nGeneral Leroy T. Steward:\r\n\r\n     Recently there have come to Chicago from the South large\r\n     numbers of colored men who have formerly lived in the country\r\n     and are not accustomed to city environments. These men have\r\n     largely been employed at the Stock Yards and, being unknown\r\n     to the police, there is concerning them naturally a greater\r\n     suspicion than would attach to the white man who had lived\r\n     for a greater length of time in the same district, and who\r\n     also would be more easily identified and traced, if need be,\r\n     and he would not, therefore, perhaps, be arrested but simply\r\n     be observed, while the police would, no doubt, feel if they\r\n     permitted the colored man to pass on at the time, they would\r\n     lose him completely. This would seem to me to be the real basis\r\n     of the feeling that has maintained on the part of these men,\r\n     that they are discriminated against as compared with the whites.\r\n\r\n     Another matter in this same connection that no doubt has a\r\n     bearing on the subject is that these same men who have been\r\n     accustomed to rather close surveillance in the South, seem\r\n     to feel that when they come to the North they must conduct\r\n     themselves in a manner to evidence to all concerned that they\r\n     have equal rights of every kind and character, with the result\r\n     that they sometimes are guilty of unnecessarily accentuating\r\n     these matters, and thus bringing on disputes which occasion bad\r\n     feeling and perhaps lead to disturbances resulting in arrest.\r\n\r\nDr. Herman C. Adler:\r\n\r\n     Repeatedly colored men have been convicted on evidence which\r\n     I know perfectly well would not have been satisfactory in\r\n     white cases. I know that was so in the case of the East St.\r\n     Louis riot where a colored man was sent down to the Southern\r\n     Illinois Penitentiary for participating in the riots on the\r\n     charge of murder. Even the prosecuting office, on reviewing the\r\n     facts, a year later, admitted he did not believe the evidence\r\n     sufficient. If that had been a white man the chances are that\r\n     he would not have been convicted upon that evidence.\r\n\r\n     We had the same thing here in Chicago: a colored man sent\r\n     to the penitentiary on a charge of attempted rape where the\r\n     identification was made by a child of six or eight years who\r\n     picked him out of a crowd under suspicion. No such evidence\r\n     ought to be accepted. We know there is prejudice, and when there\r\n     is prejudice we know the person against whom the prejudice is\r\n     directed has a hard time.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. DISCRIMINATION IN THE COURTS\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     I think in the main the Negro gets as good a show as the white\r\n     man when he gets before the judge. Whether the other forces\r\n     before he gets up to that point treat him right or not, I\r\n     cannot say.... A certain number of policemen have \"got it in\"\r\n     for him and are going to \"take a crack\" at him because he is\r\n     a colored man.\r\n\r\nJudge Hugo Pam:\r\n\r\n     In a murder case lawyers will challenge a Negro; if there were\r\n     a colored man in the box he would soon be put out.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson:\r\n\r\n     Take for example a gun case, with twelve men in the box, and\r\n     one a colored man, and suppose that the lawyer challenged\r\n     the Negro. If you went to the lawyer and said, \"Give me your\r\n     reason,\" I don't think he would give you any reason.... If you\r\n     had a case where the defendant was colored that juror would\r\n     stay in the box so far as the defendant was concerned.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan:\r\n\r\n     Of course there is another thing about the colored man in the\r\n     criminal court that must be kept in mind. It is a peculiar\r\n     thing about human nature, that no man wants to admit that he\r\n     has prejudices. He will talk loosely on the outside that he\r\n     doesn't like the Negro, or doesn't like the Jew, or doesn't\r\n     like this person or that person, but you get him under oath in\r\n     the jury box and in my twelve years on the bench I never knew\r\n     a juror to admit that he was prejudiced against anybody. It\r\n     goes without saying that in such a state of affairs you will\r\n     probably get men on the juries that try colored men who have\r\n     some prejudice against Negroes. I would say that when there\r\n     is a colored defendant and white prosecuting witness there\r\n     would be grave danger that the jury might unconsciously favor\r\n     the white side of the case. Juries will convict a colored man\r\n     with less hesitation than they will convict a white man on the\r\n     same kind of evidence. For that reason, in the many cases in\r\n     which the colored man is involved, I watch the evidence like\r\n     a hawk. The verdict has got to pass me.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. EASE WITH WHICH NEGROES ARE CONVICTED\r\n\r\nJudge George Kersten, criminal court:\r\n\r\n     There is unfortunately a difference in the ease or difficulty\r\n     with which white and colored persons brought into court are\r\n     convicted, and the misfortune operates adversely towards\r\n     colored people. In many cases jurors have been excused from\r\n     service because upon examination under oath to test their\r\n     qualifications to act as jurors they said they could not give\r\n     a colored person a fair trial. In my experience I have known\r\n     verdicts to be set aside by the presiding judge, because he\r\n     was convinced that the jury was influenced by color prejudice.\r\n     As to the prosecution of colored offenders by white plaintiffs\r\n     and white offenders by colored plaintiffs, I believe that the\r\n     influence of color prejudice is sometimes felt in our courts.\r\n     I think it is easier under similar facts and circumstances in\r\n     evidence to convict a colored defendant than a white one. And\r\n     for the same reason, a white person on trial is less liable\r\n     to conviction if the prosecuting witnesses are all colored.\r\n     Perhaps an enlightening phase of the whole situation is to be\r\n     found in the fact that colored offenders, on being brought in\r\n     for trial, usually ask to be tried by the judge instead of a\r\n     jury.\r\n\r\nJudge Hugo Pam:\r\n\r\n     In light cases involving pocket-picking, larceny, stealing a\r\n     bag of sugar, a barrel of flour, clothing, etc., I think the\r\n     races stand on an equality, but in a serious offense I think\r\n     the colored man has the less chance. I feel that the colored\r\n     man starts with a handicap. I haven't any question about it\r\n     in my mind. In the more serious crimes, where a hold-up is\r\n     committed or guns are used, I think there is great prejudice.\r\n     I think very few white or colored men are convicted that\r\n     shouldn't be; no judge would allow such a case to stand if he\r\n     thinks there has been unfair trial, but, for instance, where a\r\n     white man will be found guilty of manslaughter, a colored man\r\n     will be found guilty of murder. A white man might escape with\r\n     three to twenty years in the penitentiary, while the colored\r\n     man would get ten years to life.\r\n\r\n     I think the colored man would not be convicted if he is not\r\n     guilty, but I am not certain that the white man would be\r\n     convicted if he is guilty.\r\n\r\n     I see colored men, very resigned men, very often feeling that\r\n     most people are not interested in them. They come and take their\r\n     medicine, and go away. I feel that they are being disposed of\r\n     without the interest being shown that should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR NEGRO DEFENDANTS\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     My experience in court work is that Negro lawyers in the main\r\n     lack education such as is necessary, but there are among the\r\n     members of the bar some very good colored attorneys. Many\r\n     Negroes cannot afford to pay the attorney's fees necessary to\r\n     obtain these, so that they are handicapped in court by lack of\r\n     competent counsel, and it becomes necessary for the judge to\r\n     give them more careful hearings and more careful consideration\r\n     to protect their interests.\r\n\r\nJudge Wells M. Cook:\r\n\r\n     The handicap that the colored man seems to be under in the\r\n     severe cases is that he frequently does not get a good lawyer.\r\n     As a rule he is not represented by as good a lawyer as the\r\n     white. Of course there are capable Negro lawyers in Chicago,\r\n     but there were few such retained in the cases tried before me.\r\n\r\nJudge Hugo Pam:\r\n\r\n     I do not think that Negroes have as able lawyers as whites.\r\n     I had a case of a colored man who I felt was misrepresented\r\n     instead of represented. He was convicted of murder and sentenced\r\n     to life imprisonment. I felt that the sentence was too severe.\r\n     I set it aside and granted a new trial and it resulted in a\r\n     verdict of manslaughter which was the thing that should have\r\n     been done.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan:\r\n\r\n     The Negro hasn't the money to employ proper attorneys,\r\n     competent attorneys. In two out of three cases tried before\r\n     me in which there were colored defendants, I have appointed\r\n     attorneys to defend them. I appointed white attorneys. I asked\r\n     the defendants whom they wanted. They told me and I appointed\r\n     the white lawyers mentioned and made them serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. IDENTIFICATION\r\n\r\nJudge Daniel P. Trude:\r\n\r\n     I did find where certain of the police were going into Negro\r\n     clubs and arresting Negroes they found there, bringing them into\r\n     court without a bit of evidence of any offense. Somebody would\r\n     tip off the police that there was gambling going on so they\r\n     would raid the place, locking up all the men they found there\r\n     for the night and send them to the Bureau of Identification,\r\n     but that was all. Some policemen take many people to the Bureau\r\n     of Identification who absolutely should not be taken there,\r\n     but the judge only knows about it after they have been taken\r\n     there, when they are brought into court after the damage has\r\n     been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. PROBATION ON PAROLE\r\n\r\nDr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent, Central Howard Association:\r\n\r\n     In dealing with colored men on parole, our experience has\r\n     been that fully as large a proportion have completed their\r\n     parole with credit as in the case of white men under parole.\r\n     I should say that the task of securing employment has been\r\n     less difficult because colored men as a rule have been less\r\n     critical as to the kind of employment they would accept. They\r\n     have been willing to make an honest living at any work that\r\n     is offered.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Whitman, superintendent of state prisons:\r\n\r\n     I have seen many colored men, young men or boys, who gave every\r\n     evidence of a sincere desire to do well on the outside. They\r\n     meet with disappointment that they did not expect, hardships,\r\n     difficulty in securing work as well as homes, and they fall.\r\n     The desire was there just the same. The opportunities were\r\n     not. But when the employer gives him a chance, the Negro\r\n     appreciates it and he sticks--and we have had employers say\r\n     during the last year many times, \"If you have got such colored\r\n     men as you have sent before, give them to us in preference\r\n     to the whites, because there is a lack of appreciation on the\r\n     part of white men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n14. ENVIRONMENT: VICE IN NEGRO RESIDENCE AREAS\r\n\r\nGeneral Leroy T. Steward:\r\n\r\n     Where Negroes have come in and as a result white people\r\n     have moved out and the neighborhood has, plainly speaking,\r\n     deteriorated, there is a great tendency to permit infractions of\r\n     the law, as in any neighborhoods which are regarded as not as\r\n     important as high-class residence neighborhoods. For instance,\r\n     Calumet Avenue from Thirty-first to Thirty-ninth streets is\r\n     entirely colored. Fifteen years ago it was entirely white. Now\r\n     it would be much easier to establish vice there than it would\r\n     have been fifteen years ago when a lot of well-known people\r\n     lived in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMajor L. M. C. Funkhouser:\r\n\r\n     Most of the Negroes found in disorderly houses are employees.\r\n     There was one notorious place down there that we closed where\r\n     they were all colored. That was the most notorious one we had.\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles E. Merriam:\r\n\r\n     I think there is this to be said about the colored side of\r\n     it there [on the South Side]: I am asked whether the colored\r\n     protest against disorderly resorts would be as effective as a\r\n     protest made by an equal number of white men. Making allowance\r\n     for the fluctuating conditions in a long period, I don't believe\r\n     it would be quite as effective. Not only that, but I don't\r\n     think the colored people are so well organized to fight these\r\n     evils as a class of men ... they have not the wealth. In the\r\n     territory upon the North Side or in any territory where there\r\n     are many lawyers and people of some means, if they found a\r\n     place like that they would never rest until they got it out.\r\n     They would just keep at it with time and money until they\r\n     forced it out.\r\n\r\nDr. F. Emory Lyon, superintendent, Central Howard Association:\r\n\r\n     Our observation would indicate that the Negro delinquent has\r\n     suffered under the handicap of unsatisfactory home conditions.\r\n     Owing to the general public discrimination, fewer opportunities\r\n     have been offered him. In addition to adverse conditions in\r\n     the home, some opportunities in public places have been denied\r\n     him. Some of the discrimination and ostracism on the part of\r\n     his associates has been unconscious in many instances. The\r\n     colored boy has especially few recreational facilities.\r\n\r\nMr. O. J. Milliken:\r\n\r\n     It is up to us to give them the best that there is, and we\r\n     can clean up those districts. I don't believe the question\r\n     of color is going to enter into the matter at all if we once\r\n     clean up the districts where they are obliged to live.\r\n\r\nMyron Adams, former pastor of the First Baptist Church:\r\n\r\n     North of my church for a block or two along Thirty-first\r\n     Street at the time I went there was almost exclusively a\r\n     white residence district. The moral conditions could not have\r\n     been worse. I had a list in my church study of the houses of\r\n     prostitution and other lawless agencies gathered by the police\r\n     and the Committee of Fifteen. I don't know of a district in\r\n     Chicago where there were more gunmen, more high-class criminals,\r\n     more high-class prostitutes than there were within three blocks\r\n     of the First Baptist Church when I came there as pastor.\r\n\r\n     Speaking from my observation I think that any colored community\r\n     is liable to be imposed upon by white men who are vicious, and\r\n     the colored people get no encouragement when they themselves\r\n     endeavor to rout out that vice. White prostitutes and white\r\n     gamblers and vicious resorts come into the \"Black Belt\" because\r\n     it is black; they operate with more safety than they do in the\r\n     white belt. That is true of every American city that I know\r\n     of personally.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ASPECTS OF NEGRO CRIME\r\n\r\nJudge Charles M. Thomson:\r\n\r\n     Colored people who were up before me in the criminal court\r\n     were mostly men who did not have steady employment.... My\r\n     experience was that the environmental conditions out of which\r\n     the colored defendant arose were an environment of idleness,\r\n     very largely. I would say, as to the economic factors, that I\r\n     don't remember a case that I had involving a colored defendant\r\n     whom I would call prosperous, whereas there were many white\r\n     defendants who were very prosperous. Most of the colored people\r\n     tried were in stringent circumstances and poverty.\r\n\r\nJudge Kickham Scanlan:\r\n\r\n     My experience in the criminal court is that the colored\r\n     defendant, even in bailable cases, is unable to give bail. He\r\n     has to stay in jail, and therefore his case is very quickly\r\n     disposed of by the prosecutor. Defendants locked up are\r\n     usually tried first. The colored man is more apt to be out of\r\n     work than the white man, and that is a possible reason for\r\n     the large number of arrests of Negroes. His sphere is very\r\n     limited, and if there is any let up in the industry that is\r\n     involved in that sphere, he is a victim. I have often wondered\r\n     if you could change the skins of a thousand white men in the\r\n     city of Chicago and handicap them the way the colored man is\r\n     handicapped today, how many of those white men in ten years'\r\n     time would be law-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles E. Merriam:\r\n\r\n     This problem as I see it is very complicated. We have to deal\r\n     first with the matter of economic class which is at the bottom\r\n     of a good deal of it, then with the matter of race, which is\r\n     at the bottom of a good deal more of it, although perhaps not\r\n     as much as class; then there is the matter of politics or a\r\n     system which has grown up for thirty or forty years back, which\r\n     makes the class and race relations a good deal more difficult\r\n     to deal with.\r\n\r\n     If every man had good housing conditions and a steady job, at\r\n     a living wage, a good opportunity for education, there would\r\n     not be very much crime.... Particularly in the case of the\r\n     colored people, the crime is on the part of the community,\r\n     on the part of the city that allows bad conditions to exist.\r\n     Negroes ought to be protected. They don't get protection for the\r\n     same reason that it is always hard to protect the economically\r\n     weak against the strong. There is not any use of making a lot\r\n     of fine phrases about it--that is largely where the trouble\r\n     lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nA. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NEGRO WORKING POPULATION IN 1920\r\n\r\nBetween 1910 and 1920 the Negro population of Chicago increased from\r\n44,103 to 109,594. Of this number it is estimated that about 70,000 were\r\nengaged in industries in 1920 as compared with about 27,000 in 1910.[49]\r\n\r\nQuestions which naturally suggest themselves for answer in connection\r\nwith this great increase in the Negro working population in Chicago are:\r\nHow did this large number of Negroes fit into the industrial life of the\r\ncity? What were and are the opportunities open to them? Have they given\r\nsatisfaction to employers? Are they discriminated against by employers\r\nor fellow-workers? Has racial friction developed because of competition\r\nbetween white and Negro workers? Were the riots of 1919 in any sense the\r\nresult of labor troubles? What part have the Negroes taken in strikes?\r\nWhat is the relation of the Negro to organized labor? What is the outlook\r\nfor the Negro in industry? These and other questions guided the inquiries\r\nand investigations of the Commission in the industrial field.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE WAR\r\n\r\nThe Negro's position in the industrial life of Chicago is so intimately\r\nconnected with the changes due to the war that a brief reference to\r\ncertain facts of common knowledge in connection with the war will be\r\nhelpful. With the beginning of the war in 1914 came an abnormally large\r\ndemand by the belligerent countries for American munitions, food products,\r\nclothing, leather, iron and steel products, and other manufactured\r\ngoods. Existing establishments were enlarged and new ones were erected\r\nin response to the demand for increased production. It was not uncommon\r\nfor a plant to double or treble its labor force. A typical case was one\r\nof the large packing-plants in the Chicago \"Yards\" which increased its\r\nworkers during the war from 8,000 to 17,000.\r\n\r\nThe war stimulated the demand for goods, and therefore for labor, and at\r\nthe same time decreased the available labor supply. Immigration from the\r\nbelligerent nations immediately ceased, and there was a marked decrease\r\nin immigration from other countries; aliens in large numbers departed\r\nto join the fighting forces of their native lands.\r\n\r\nThe labor shortage became acute soon after the United States entered the\r\nwar in 1917, and enlistments withdrew hundreds of thousands of men from\r\nnorthern industries. An unprecedented demand for Negro workers was the\r\nresult. The migration from the South was mainly a response to the call\r\nof larger opportunity and higher wages in the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. INDUSTRIAL BACKGROUND OF NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\nFor the United States as a whole in 1910 the industrial condition of\r\nthe gainfully occupied Negro population is shown in Table XVIII:\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XVIII\r\n\r\n     GAINFULLY OCCUPIED NEGRO POPULATION TEN YEARS OF AGE AND OVER\r\n     IN THE UNITED STATES IN 1910\r\n\r\n     ====================================================================\r\n             Industry        |Both Sexes|Percentage|   Male   |  Female\r\n     ------------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n     Agriculture             | 2,893,674|   55.7   | 1,842,537| 1,051,137\r\n     Domestic and personal   |          |          |          |\r\n       service               | 1,074,543|   20.7   |   234,063|   840,480\r\n     Manufacturing and hand  |          |          |          |\r\n       trades                |   657,130|   12.6   |   575,845|    81,285\r\n     Transportation          |   276,648|    5.3   |   274,565|     2,083\r\n     Trade                   |   132,019|    2.5   |   123,635|     8,384\r\n     Professional service    |    69,471|    1.3   |    39,400|    30,071\r\n     Public service          |    26,295|    0.5   |    25,838|       457\r\n     Others                  |    62,755|    1.4   |    62,671|        84\r\n                             +----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n      Total United States[50]| 5,192,535|  100.0   | 3,178,554| 2,013,981\r\n     ------------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nIn 1910, more than three-fourths of the gainfully occupied Negroes in\r\nthe United States were engaged in two forms of industry--agriculture\r\nand domestic and personal service. In the South at that time 78.8 per\r\ncent of the Negro population lived in rural communities[51] and 62 per\r\ncent of those employed were engaged in agriculture.[52] It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the northward migration involved a sudden transition of\r\nthe southern Negro from farms or small towns to the highly specialized\r\nindustries of northern cities, with marked changes in modes of living.\r\n\r\nOn many southern plantations the Negroes were required to buy food and\r\nclothing on credit at such high prices that their shares of the return\r\nwere usually spent before the crops were harvested.[53] This system\r\nencouraged careless spending and did nothing to induce habits of thrift.\r\nEven the hardest-working Negroes frequently found themselves in debt to\r\ntheir landlords at the end of the year.[54] Incentive to sustained effort\r\nand regular work was lacking in the hand-to-mouth existence under this\r\nprevailing system of share rent and credit. It naturally produced habits\r\nsuch as drawing against wages and working irregularly under the spur of\r\ntemporary need. Men handicapped by such habits joined the migration in\r\ngreat numbers. Though ill-fitted for the keen competition, business-like\r\nprecision, and six-day-week routine of northern industry, the southern\r\nNegro, in spite of these handicaps, has succeeded in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE NEGRO IN CHICAGO INDUSTRIES IN 1910 AND 1920\r\n\r\nOf the Negro population of 44,103 in Chicago in 1910 the gainfully\r\noccupied numbered 27,317. The distribution of this number, according\r\nto industrial classification, is given in Table XIX, which shows that\r\n60 per cent of all such Negroes were engaged in domestic and personal\r\nservice, as compared with 15 per cent in manufacturing and 3 per cent\r\nin clerical occupations.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE XIX\r\n\r\n           NEGROES GAINFULLY OCCUPIED IN CHICAGO IN 1910[55]\r\n\r\n   =======================================================================\r\n                                 |  Both   |            |        |\r\n            Industries           |  Sexes  | Percentage |  Male  | Female\r\n   ------------------------------+---------+------------+--------+--------\r\n   Manufacturing and mechanical  |  4,071  |     15     |  3,073 |    998\r\n   Transportation                |  1,852  |      7     |  1,849 |      3\r\n   Trade                         |  1,241  |      5     |  1,148 |     93\r\n   Public service                |    224} |            |   {224 |      0\r\n   Professional                  |    963} |      4     |   {640 |    323\r\n   Clerical occupations          |    934  |      3     |    771 |    163\r\n   Domestic and personal service | 16,389  |     60     |  9,426 |  6,963\r\n   Agriculture, mining, and      |         |            |        |\r\n     unclassified                |  1,643  |      6     |  1,306 |    337\r\n                                 +---------+------------+--------+--------\r\n       Totals                    | 27,317  |    100     | 18,437 |  8,880\r\n   ------------------------------+---------+------------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\n1. METHOD AND SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nTo discover the industries in Chicago which were employing Negroes in\r\nappreciable numbers in 1920, preliminary questionnaires were sent to 850\r\nemployers compiled from lists furnished by: (1) the Chicago Association\r\nof Commerce (covering 591 establishments, with a total of 350,000\r\nemployees); (2) the Employment Department of the Chicago Urban League;\r\n(3) the Illinois Free Employment Bureau; (4) the Federal Employment\r\nBureau; and (5) the classified telephone directory.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaires were returned by 460 establishments of 850 to which they\r\nwere mailed. We are satisfied that the replies received cover the field\r\nof Negro labor, and that no establishments of importance in this field\r\nhave been overlooked. Table XX shows the results:\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE XX\r\n\r\n     ====================================================================\r\n                                            |  Number of   |Total Negroes\r\n                Negroes Employed            |Establishments|  Employed\r\n     ---------------------------------------+--------------+-------------\r\n     No Negroes                             |      264     |         0\r\n     Less than five Negroes                 |       59     |       111\r\n     Five Negroes or more (manufacturing)   |       69     |    12,854\r\n     Five Negroes or more                   |              |\r\n       (non-manufacturing)                  |       68     |     9,483\r\n                                            +--------------+-------------\r\n         Totals                             |      460     |    22,448\r\n     ---------------------------------------+--------------+-------------\r\n\r\nAnswers came from 156 manufacturing establishments employing fifty-one\r\nor more wage-earners. The representative character of this group is\r\nindicated by the fact that over three-fourths of the total wage-earners\r\nin Chicago engaged in manufacturing in 1914 were employed in factories of\r\nthis class. The United States Census of Manufactures for 1914 reported\r\nthe total number of wage-earners employed in manufacturing in Chicago\r\nin that year as 313,710; of this number, 244,827, or 78 per cent, were\r\nemployed in 1,032 establishments employing fifty-one or more wage-earners.\r\nThe 156 questionnaires therefore represented 15 per cent of the 1,032\r\nestablishments in this class (in 1914) and included 107,403 wage-earners,\r\nor almost 44 per cent of the total wage-earners in this class and 30\r\nper cent of the total wage-earners engaged in manufacturing in 1914.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaires reporting Negro employees were returned by 104\r\nmanufacturing establishments of all classes. Of these, sixteen employed\r\none to fifty wage-earners, representing a total of 435 wage-earners;\r\nand eighty-eight employed fifty-one or more wage-earners, representing\r\na total of 78,919 wage-earners.\r\n\r\nSince thirty-five of the manufacturing establishments reporting Negro\r\nlabor (or 33 per cent of the 104 so reporting) employed less than five\r\nNegroes each, or a total of seventy Negroes in all, while sixty-nine\r\nemployed 12,854 Negroes, or 99.4 per cent of the total Negroes reported\r\nby manufacturing establishments, it seemed advisable in this report\r\nto consider only those employing five Negroes or more, in order not to\r\ngive undue weight to conditions where only a relatively few Negroes were\r\nconcerned. A similar situation was disclosed by the returns furnished\r\nby non-manufacturing establishments, and the returns from twenty-four\r\nemploying a total of forty-one Negroes have been disregarded in this\r\nreport in order to give proper weight to conditions in the sixty-eight\r\nemploying five or more Negroes which reported a total of 9,483\r\nNegroes.[56] The combined number of establishments, both manufacturing\r\n(69) and non-manufacturing (68), employing five or more Negroes each\r\nwas 137.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: INDUSTRIAL PLANTS\r\n   120 INDUSTRIAL CONCERNS EMPLOYING 24,286 NEGROES]\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the returns reported in the preliminary questionnaires\r\ncertain establishments and industries were selected for more intensive\r\nstudy through personal interviews with employers, conferences participated\r\nin by employers and members of the Commission, and interviews with\r\nemployees. The basis on which the selection was made was either the\r\nnumber of Negroes employed or the length of time during which Negroes\r\nhad been employed, special attention being given to those industries\r\nand establishments which had employed Negro labor for the first time\r\nsince the war. The industries employing large numbers of Negro workers\r\nwhich were selected for further study were: slaughtering, meat packing,\r\nand other food products; iron foundries and iron and steel products;\r\nlaundries; needle trades; hotels; railroads; Pullman and dining-car\r\nservices; tanneries; taxicab upkeep and repair; mail order.\r\n\r\nAn investigator for the Commission visited 101 establishments of the 137\r\nreporting five or more Negro employees (ten establishments employing less\r\nthan five Negroes each were also visited). Four industrial conferences or\r\ninformal hearings were held by the Commission, large employers of Negro\r\nlabor being invited to co-operate with the Commission by giving it the\r\nbenefit of their experience with Negro labor.

INCREASE IN NEGRO LABOR SINCE 1915\r\n\r\nThe data obtained from questionnaires, interviews, and conferences with\r\nemployers disclosed the fact that there has been a remarkable increase\r\nsince 1915 in the number of Negro workers employed in manufacturing, in\r\nclerical occupations, and in laundries. As was to be expected, the number\r\nof Negroes in personal service (hotels, dining-cars, and parlor-cars)\r\nalso increased, but the increase was negligible in comparison with the\r\ngain in the other fields mentioned.\r\n\r\nInability to obtain competent white workers was the reason given in\r\npractically every instance for the large increase in the number of\r\nNegroes employed since 1914. All of the large employers of Negro labor\r\nattending the conferences assigned shortage of labor as the principal\r\nreason for the increased number of Negroes reported. A few establishments\r\n(not represented in the conferences) reported that Negroes had first\r\nbeen employed to take the place of strikers, and increasing numbers had\r\nbeen employed thereafter. The establishments so reporting were hotels,\r\na small clothing factory, and a warehouse company. Because of the labor\r\nshortage in the North, large numbers of Negroes left the southern states.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXIII\r\n\r\n       NEGROES EMPLOYED FROM 1915 TO 1920 IN SIXTY-TWO MANUFACTURING\r\n           ESTABLISHMENTS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO INDUSTRIES[60]\r\n\r\n   ======================+==========+======+======+======+======+======+=======\r\n                         |Number of |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n      Industries         |Establish-| 1915 | 1916 | 1917 | 1918 | 1919 | 1920\r\n                         |  ments   |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   ----------------------+----------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n   Box making            |     3    |    3 |    3 |  116 |  116 |  145 |   143\r\n   Clothing              |     9    |   75 |  110 |  140 |  108 |  161 |   203\r\n   Other needlework      |     3    |    0 |    0 |    0 |   25 |  325 |   325\r\n   Cooperage             |     2    |   29 |   34 |   95 |  110 |   15 |   106\r\n   Food products[61]     |    16    |1,103 |2,529 |4,765 |6,518 |5,789 | 5,379\r\n   Iron and steel[62]    |    22    |  121 |  672 |1,115 |1,580 |3,002 | 3,829\r\n   Tanneries             |     7    |    0 |   17 |   36 |   87 |  229 |   462\r\n   Miscellaneous         |          |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n     manufacturing       |    10    |   15 |   15 |   24 |   48 |   75 |   140\r\n                         +----------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n       Totals            |    62    |1,346 |3,380 |6,291 |8,592 |9,881 |10,587\r\n   ----------------------+----------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXIV\r\n\r\n     NEGROES EMPLOYED FROM 1915 TO 1920 IN FORTY-SEVEN ESTABLISHMENTS\r\n        (NON-MANUFACTURING) CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO INDUSTRIES[63]\r\n\r\n   ======================+==========+======+======+======+======+======+======\r\n                         |Number of |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n      Industries         |Establish-| 1915 | 1916 | 1917 | 1918 | 1919 | 1920\r\n                         |  ments   |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   ----------------------+----------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n   Hotels                |     9    |  544 |  559 |  615 |  684 |  693 |   956\r\n   Laundries             |    20    |  118 |  180 |  220 |  350 |  520 |   764\r\n   Mail order (clerical  |          |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n     occupations)        |     2    |    0 |    0 |    0 |  664 |1,650 | 1,400\r\n   Railroads (dining- and|          |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n     parlor-car service) |    16    |3,939 |3,940 |4,274 |4,493 |4,506 | 5,363\r\n                         +----------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n       Totals            |    47    |4,601 |4,679 |5,109 |6,191 |7,369 | 8,483\r\n   ----------------------+----------+------+------+------+------+------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\n4. CHICAGO EMPLOYERS AND SOUTHERN NEGRO LABOR\r\n\r\nDuring the course of its inquiry the statement was frequently made to\r\nmembers of the Commission or to its investigators that large employers of\r\nlabor in Chicago, and particularly the packers, had imported many Negroes\r\nfrom the South. Although the Commission made a thorough investigation\r\nof such statements, no evidence of any value was discovered to support\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe general superintendents of the Armour, Morris, Swift, and Wilson\r\nplants who attended conferences declared emphatically that their companies\r\nhad not engaged in any encouragement of migration.\r\n\r\nMr. Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, being\r\nasked through correspondence from the Commission if he could furnish any\r\nevidence tending to prove the importation of Negroes into the Chicago\r\ndistrict by employers, replied, \"There is a plentitude of such evidence,\"\r\nbut when Mr. Gompers was urged to cite the evidence, his reply was: \"It\r\ncannot be unknown to you that some 30,000 Negroes were imported into\r\nthe Chicago district during the steel strike. They did not go there of\r\ntheir own volition, but through inducements which were held out to them\r\nby the agents of employers who visited southern and western cities.\"\r\n\r\nAs, however, the Chicago race riot occurred a year prior to the steel\r\nstrike, importation of Negroes at the latter time could not have affected\r\nthe situation out of which the riot came. But the fact remains that labor\r\nleaders insist that employers in the Chicago district imported Negroes\r\nfrom the South, notwithstanding their inability to cite facts in support\r\nof this belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. CLASSIFICATION OF NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\nAn accurate classification of Negro laborers into skilled, semi-skilled,\r\nand unskilled would help to an understanding of the position of the Negro\r\nin industry. In manufacturing, such a classification was attempted,\r\nbut the results were unsatisfactory. These classes cannot be strictly\r\ndefined, and different employers give them different meanings. In a number\r\nof important cases employers reported the total number of skilled and\r\nunskilled, and that figures for each class could not be compiled without\r\ngreat labor. In all such cases the total is listed as \"unskilled.\" This\r\nclass is thus unduly enlarged at the expense of the semi-skilled and\r\nthe skilled. So the number of semi-skilled workers appears to be less\r\nthan the skilled. These facts show that accuracy cannot be claimed for\r\nthe classification in Table XXV.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE XXV\r\n\r\n         NEGRO EMPLOYEES IN SIXTY-SIX MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS\r\n            CLASSIFIED AS SKILLED, SEMI-SKILLED, AND UNSKILLED\r\n\r\n   ==================+===============+=========+=========+=========+==========\r\n                     |  Number of    |  Total  |         |  Semi-  |\r\n       Industry      |Establishments | Negroes | Skilled | skilled | Unskilled\r\n   ------------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n   Box manufacturing |       3       |    143  |   ...   |   ...   |     143\r\n   Clothing          |       9       |    203  |    57   |    29   |     117\r\n   Cooperage         |       2       |    106  |     8   |    45   |      53\r\n   Food products[64] |       8       |  7,597  |   229   |    12   |   7,356\r\n   Iron and steel    |      27       |  3,879  |   434   |   180   |   3,265\r\n   Tanneries         |       7       |    462  |   175   |   ...   |     287\r\n   Miscellaneous     |      10       |    139  |    24   |     1   |     114\r\n                     +---------------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n     Total[65]       |      66       | 12,529  |   927   |   267   |  11,335\r\n   ------------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThe attempt to classify Negro workers according to occupation failed\r\nbecause the necessary information was not obtainable, especially from\r\nlarge employers. Nevertheless the number of workers in certain occupations\r\nreported by a few establishments is suggestive of the fields recently\r\nopened to Negroes in Chicago. In 1910[66] there were only thirty-one\r\nNegro molders in Chicago, while in 1920 there were 304 reported by ten\r\nestablishments. In 1910 there were but twenty-eight factory sewers or\r\nmachine operators, while in 1920 there were 382 in twelve factories. In\r\n1910 there were 934 Negroes employed in clerical occupations as compared\r\nwith 1,400 in two concerns in 1920. In 1910 there were but 287 Negro\r\nlaundry operatives in Chicago, while there were 764 reported by twenty\r\nlaundries in 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. WAGES OF NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\nThe period of this industrial investigation--the spring and summer\r\nof 1920--was one of exceptional demand for labor and of high wages.\r\nEmployers were glad to get workers of any sort at high pay.[67] In\r\nbranches of employment where Negroes were permitted to work, their wages\r\nwere generally the same as those of the white workers. In interviewing\r\nmany Negro workers the Commission's investigators found practically no\r\ncomplaints of discrimination in wages on the same tasks. And the Chicago\r\nUrban League which, through its industrial department, places more\r\nNegroes in employment than any other agency in Chicago reported that it\r\nhad very few complaints of such discrimination.\r\n\r\nSome discrimination was practiced by foremen in placing or keeping Negroes\r\nat work on processes that yielded smaller returns than those to which\r\nwhite workers were assigned. In the field of common labor, where the\r\nlargest number of Negroes are employed, some kinds of piecework yield\r\ngreater returns than others. The tendency of foremen in some plants was\r\nto place Negroes on those processes yielding the smallest returns. The\r\nfollowing are instances of such discrimination in favor of the white\r\nworkers in the same plants.\r\n\r\nIn two large foundries white molders were given standard patterns, which\r\nremain the same throughout the year and permit the working up of speed;\r\nwhile patterns that were changed frequently, and made production slower\r\nwere given to the Negroes. As speed determined the piecework earnings,\r\nthe Negroes could not earn as much as the white molders in the same\r\nfoundry.\r\n\r\nIn the several plants the white workers were favored in the distribution\r\nof overtime work; or Negroes were not permitted to work at all on overtime\r\nat \"time and a half\" rates or on Sundays at \"double pay\" as long as\r\nwhite workers were available.\r\n\r\nWhile in the larger industries there was seldom any complaint about\r\ninequality in the basic rate of pay for common labor, restrictions upon\r\nthe promotion and advancement of Negroes frequently prevented them from\r\nearning higher wages. In one department of a large food-products plant\r\nNegroes reached the maximum rate of 61 cents per hour after a few months'\r\nemployment. No further advancement could be had because the superintendent\r\nwas not willing to place Negro foremen over white workers. A Negro in\r\nthe starch-mixing department held a skilled position as starch tester.\r\nIt became apparent that in carrying out his duties many of the starch\r\nmixers would be subject to his immediate direction. The foreman apparently\r\ndid not approve of this and ordered him to teach his duties to a Polish\r\nworkman. The Negro declined to do this, and the matter was referred to\r\nthe general superintendent. After an investigation it was decided to\r\npermit the Negro to retain his position as tester, but he was given no\r\nauthority over the men.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fluctuations in wages, the impracticability of getting\r\nactual records of wages from all plants, and the discrepancies which in\r\nsome instances did appear between reported and actual wages, it seemed\r\ndesirable to supplement the information of the Commission's investigators.\r\nThe records of the industrial department of the Chicago Urban League\r\nafforded the most complete data on wages received by Negroes that could\r\nbe found in Chicago. During the year 1919 it placed more than 14,000\r\nNegroes in plants in the Chicago District. In each case, when securing\r\nNegro employment, it kept a record of the wages actually offered and of\r\nconditions of work. If the Negro made complaint that the wage or work\r\nconditions did not prove to be as stated, it investigated the complaint.\r\n\r\nIncluded in these records are the Pullman Company, Wilson & Company\r\n(packers), Armour & Company, Morris Company, Swift & Company, Illinois\r\nMalleable Iron Company, National Malleable and Castings Company,\r\nInternational Harvester Company, the General Can Company, the Republic Box\r\nCompany, Chicago Fire Brick Company, Sears, Roebuck & Company, Superior\r\nProcess Company, Consumers Coal Company, Corn Products Refining Company\r\nat Argo, United States Quartermasters' Department, Adams & Westlake\r\nCompany, Griess Pfleger Tanning Company, and Inland Steel Company.\r\n\r\nIn the industries listed above, the minimum wage rate per hour is 42.5\r\ncents, which is the minimum rate for the packing industries. The maximum\r\nrate is sixty-one cents per hour paid by the Corn Products Refining\r\nCompany at Argo and the International Harvester Company. Neither of\r\nthe latter, however, represents a basic wage. The average wage for\r\nthe thirty-six companies is 48.7 cents. These wage rates cover the\r\nmost arduous tasks found in the list of common labor. Three items for\r\ntrack laborers are included. Others include freight handlers, yardmen,\r\ntruckers, sweepers, foundry laborers, etc. Six companies work ten hours\r\nper day, twelve companies nine hours, one company nine and one-half\r\nhours, seventeen companies eight hours. Four pay bonuses, not including\r\npackers, who also pay a bonus in compliance with the award of a judge\r\nacting as mediator between the packers and the union.\r\n\r\nThe building trades are not included, but of the three independent\r\ncontractors listed the wage paid common laborers is 50 cents per hour,\r\n60 cents per hour, and 70 cents per hour, respectively, for eight hours,\r\nwhile the union rate of pay for common labor is $1.00 per hour for eight\r\nhours, time and one-half for overtime, and double time for Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. WOMEN EMPLOYEES IN INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS\r\n\r\nNegro women employed in thirty-one industrial establishments worked,\r\nin five of them forty-four hours a week, in fifteen of them forty-eight\r\nhours, in seven of them forty-nine hours, and in four of them fifty-one\r\nhours. The weekly pay ranged from $9.00 to $15.00 a week as clothing\r\nfolders, to as high as $20.00 to $35.00 a week as clothing drapers\r\nor finishers. Map mounting paid $15.00 a week, book binding $15.00,\r\npaper-box making $13.00, tobacco stripping $16.40, core making (foundry\r\nwork) $16.40, twine weaving $17.40, silk-shade making $10.00 to $18.00,\r\nfood packing $12.00 to $15.00, mattress making $12.00 to $22.00,\r\nriveters (canvas) $15.00, paper sorters $12.00, steam laundry workers\r\n(unskilled) $13.00 to $16.00, steam laundry hand workers $18.00 to $29.00,\r\npower-machine operators on men's caps $15.00 to $18.00, on aprons $14.00\r\nto $18.00, on dresses $15.00 to $18.00, on overalls (union shop) $18.00\r\nto $25.00, and on overalls (non-union shop) $15.00 to $18.00.\r\n\r\nOf fourteen companies employing colored girls as operators, five paid\r\non a piecework basis only. Two paid from $12.00 to $18.00 per week,\r\ndepending on the skill of the operator, two companies paid $14.00 per\r\nweek to beginners, one paid $15.00 per week to beginners, three paid\r\n$12.00 per week to beginners, one paid $18.00 per week to beginners,\r\nthe latter being a union shop.\r\n\r\nConsiderable unrest has been traceable to delay on the part of the\r\nmanagers in promoting beginners above the beginning wage. Girls have been\r\nretained at a beginning wage for an unreasonable time after acquiring\r\nsatisfactory skill and production. This condition is known to the Women's\r\nTrade Union League, but no well-directed effort has ever been made to\r\nunionize colored workers in the garment trades, except when they have\r\nbeen called in as strike breakers to replace white workers. An instance\r\nof this was the strike at the C. B. Shane Company, manufacturers of\r\nraincoats, where colored girls were employed to replace striking white\r\nunion workers. At that time very few colored girls were members of the\r\nlocal union. According to an official of the Women's Garment Workers'\r\nUnion not more than 125 colored workers have become members.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. HOTEL AND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES\r\n\r\n_Men._--In about twenty-five hotels and restaurants in which colored\r\nmen are employed, wages are as follows:\r\n\r\n     Chief cooks                           $25.00 to $50.00 per week\r\n     Waiters                                25.00 to  40.00 per week\r\n     Bus boys                               14.00 to  20.00 per week\r\n     Hotel porters                          45.00 to  65.00 per month\r\n     Dishwashers                            15.00 to  20.00 per week\r\n     Second cooks                           20.00 to  35.00 per week\r\n     Bell-boys                              40.00 to  45.00 per month\r\n     Shoe shiners and washroom porters      15.00 to  17.00 per week\r\n\r\nIn all of the above-listed occupations the wages are augmented by tips.\r\nIt is difficult to form an accurate estimate of the amount earned in\r\ntips for the reason that it is conditioned upon the character of service\r\nrendered and the inclination of the person served to pay for personal\r\nservice. It would be fair to estimate that in hotels and restaurants\r\nknown to employees as \"good houses\" the tips range from $2.00 to $5.00\r\nper day. In a colored restaurant in the neighborhood of Thirty-first and\r\nState streets a wage of $5.00 per week is paid to waitresses, while the\r\ntips have been known to total five times that amount.\r\n\r\n_Women._--The twenty-five hotels and restaurants concerning which the\r\nChicago Urban League's Industrial Department has records, employ women\r\nin the occupations and at the wages listed as follows:\r\n\r\n     Waitresses       $ 8.00 to $15.00 per week and tips (board)\r\n     Chambermaids      25.00 to  45.00 per month and tips (board)\r\n     Pantry girls      15.00 to  18.00 per week and board\r\n     Kitchen help       9.00 to  16.00 per week and board\r\n\r\nAllowing an average of 35 cents per meal for three meals, $1.05 per day\r\nor $7.35 per week should be added where board is included. This would\r\nmake the following schedule of wages:\r\n\r\n     Waitresses       $15.35 to $22.35 per week\r\n     Chambermaids      54.40 to  74.40 per month\r\n     Pantry girls      22.35 to  25.35 per week\r\n     Kitchen help      16.35 to  23.35 per week\r\n\r\nIn clerical positions colored men have had very little opportunity,\r\nexcept in the post-office. There are exceptions, however, such as shipping\r\nclerks, storekeepers, and bookkeepers.\r\n\r\nThe girls employed as long-hand entry clerks, typists, checkers, routers,\r\nand Elliott-Fisher and adding-machine operators received during 1920 from\r\n$15.00 to $16.00 as a beginning wage. The chief supervisor (colored)\r\nin charge of 600 girls in one of the large mail-order houses received\r\n$23.00 per week, and the assistant superintendent, a white man, received\r\n$50.00 per week while studying the mail-order business under the chief\r\nsupervisor. When the management's attention was called to the inequality,\r\ntwo additional supervisors were added and the work lessened without\r\nincrease of pay.\r\n\r\nAnother firm employing several hundred colored girls paid a welfare\r\nworker $20.00 per week, while another with half that number of girls\r\npaid $25.00 per week.\r\n\r\nThere was a deep-seated suspicion existing among the clerical force of\r\na firm employing a large number of colored girls that the white girls\r\nemployed by the same company received a higher wage than that paid the\r\ncolored girls. The suspicion grew out of the mistake of an employment\r\nmanager in mistaking a colored girl for a white one.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. RAILROAD WORKERS\r\n\r\n_Dining-car men._--According to the records of the Railway Men's\r\nInternational Industrial Benevolent Association, wages of dining-car\r\nwaiters prior to 1916 were universally $25.00 per month, with the\r\nexception of the Santa Fe, which paid from $35.00 to $40.00 per month for\r\n\"preferred\" runs. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy allowed an additional\r\n$3.00 to the $25.00 standard for men in service ten years or more.\r\n\r\nIn 1918, after the roads had been federalized, the minimum wage became\r\n$48.00 per month. In May, 1919, a further increase to $55.00 per month\r\nand overtime on a mileage basis was granted. This gave an average of\r\n$62.00 per month for so called \"transcontinental\" runs, that is, service\r\nbetween Chicago and the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nEffective February 1, 1920, wages were adjusted to an hourly basis,\r\nwhich gave payment for overtime in excess of 240 hours per month. On\r\nJuly 20, 1920, most roads allowed a general increase to dining-car men\r\nwhich brought the average to $65.00 per month.\r\n\r\nAn official of the Railway Men's International Industrial Benevolent\r\nAssociation estimated that the tips and salary of the average waiter\r\nwere $105.00 per month, including three meals valued at 35 cents per\r\nday. This estimate was accepted by the Federal Railway Labor Board. This\r\nlow estimate is arrived at because it is generally the custom to feed\r\nwaiters and kitchen crews on leftovers which would otherwise become waste.\r\n\r\n_Porters._--The wages of porters, including tips, is estimated at $105.00\r\nper month. The present salary paid to porters is $65.00 per month. In\r\nMay, 1919, the minimum basis was $60.00 per month on a mileage basis of\r\n$.0055 per mile in excess of 11,000 miles per month. In December of the\r\nsame year a final adjustment of the wage scale was made in which length\r\nof service was taken as a basis. For three years or less the pay was\r\n$63.00 per month; for from three to ten years the pay was $66.00 per\r\nmonth; for ten years or more the pay was $69.00 per month. The Railway\r\nMen's International Industrial Benevolent Association furnished the\r\nabove information.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same authority, on January 1, 1921, most roads reduced\r\nthe hourly overtime for waiters, cooks, and stewards and placed it on\r\na straight time service, with pay ranging between $60.00 and $65.00 per\r\nmonth. A twenty-four-day month was also established. This was equal to\r\na reduction of wages for the class of labor referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the case of thirty-one orders for porters in stores, restaurants,\r\ncafés, and drugstores, office buildings, etc., the wages ran from $12.00\r\nper week to $25.00. Some difficulty was experienced in determining a\r\nminimum wage, for the reason that in many instances full time is not\r\nrequired, porters being allowed to do odd jobs on their own account. Of\r\nthese thirty-one, three received $12 a week, one $13, four $15, two $16,\r\none $17, four $18, two $19, six $20, three $21, one $21.25, one $22 and\r\ntwo $25.\r\n\r\nApartment-house janitors usually are affiliated with the labor unions.\r\nAn instance of financial benefit is as follows: F----, who is engineer\r\nfor an apartment in Evanston, before joining the union received $45.00\r\nper month for his services, with quarters in a basement apartment. He\r\nnow receives $125.00 per month with the same quarters.\r\n\r\nFiremen with licenses were offered from $125.00 to $150.00 per month in\r\nten different positions filled by the League.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. DOMESTIC WORKERS\r\n\r\nEighty-one orders for maids for service in private families were listed\r\nwith the following results: maximum, $18.00 per week with room and board;\r\nminimum, $6.00 per week with room and board; average, $12.84 per week\r\nwith room and board. Of these, twenty-six were paid $15, eight $14,\r\ntwelve $12, fifteen $10. Three received $18, and one $20.\r\n\r\n_Children's nurses._--Fifteen were listed, of whom five were paid $15.00\r\nper week with room and board, six were paid $12.00, one was paid $7.00,\r\ntwo were paid $5.00, and one was paid $3.00.\r\n\r\n_Cooks._--Sixteen were listed as follows: one was paid $25.00 per week\r\nwith room and board, four were paid $18.00, three were paid $16.00, six\r\nwere paid $15.00, and two were paid $14.00.\r\n\r\nThe minimum wage for cooks indicated is $14.00 per week with room and\r\nboard. The maximum wage is $25.00 per week with room and board, while\r\nin the case of children's nurses the maximum wage is $15.00 per week\r\nand the minimum $3.00 per week for part time.\r\n\r\n_Housemen._--Out of a list of twenty-five orders, a minimum of $40.00\r\nper month with room and board, a maximum of $100.00 per month with room\r\nand board, and an average of $65.00 per month with room and board.\r\n\r\n_Chauffeurs._--Minimum of $100.00 per month with room and board and\r\nmaximum of $150.00 per month with room and board. It is difficult to\r\noutline the duties of chauffeurs for the reason that they often perform\r\nthe duties of butler, houseman, yardman, etc., in addition to that of\r\nchauffeur.\r\n\r\n_Couples._--(Man and wife.) Out of twenty-five orders listed, the\r\nfollowing wages were offered: minimum of $85.00 per month with room and\r\nboard. A maximum of $165.00 per month with room and board.\r\n\r\n_Laundresses._--Usually employed by the day. The prevailing rate per\r\nday over the past year was $4.00 and car fare, with one meal. This\r\nwage was asked by common understanding and without any visible form of\r\norganization. Since November 1, 1920, when the unemployment situation\r\nbecame manifest, $3.60 per day, car fare, and one meal has been accepted.\r\n\r\nFrom 1918 to November 1, 1920, a serious shortage of domestic help\r\nwas noted. Colored girls and women deserted this grade of work for the\r\nfactories, where shorter hours and free Sundays were secured. The larger\r\npay of domestic employment did not attract the average worker, for the\r\nreason that free evenings for recreation and amusement were apparently\r\nmore desirable than the isolation and long hours of domestic service.\r\n\r\nRecently housekeepers secured Negro girls from the southern states\r\nand imported Negro girls from the British West India Islands[68] in\r\nan attempted solution of the domestic-help problem. Transportation and\r\nclothes were furnished by employers and some sort of verbal agreement\r\nentered into by which the girls were expected to work out this\r\nindebtedness. Instances have come to the attention of the Chicago Urban\r\nLeague which seem to indicate that these agreements have not worked\r\nout satisfactorily. For example: One colored woman was brought from a\r\nsmall town in Florida to a Chicago suburb by a white family on such an\r\nagreement. After a few weeks' service the employer complained that the\r\nwork performed by the woman as a general maid was unsatisfactory. Abuse\r\nfollowed. The woman sought to go to a Negro family under the pretence\r\nthat she wished to return a pair of borrowed shoes. Her employer,\r\nfearing that she wished to escape, drove her to the home of the Negro\r\nfamily in his automobile. Once inside the home, she told a story of\r\nhow her employer had kicked, beaten, and threatened her with a revolver\r\nif she attempted to leave. The Negro family gave asked-for shelter and\r\ninformed the employer that she would not return. After threatening to\r\ntake her away by force, the employer went away and the woman remained.\r\nA suit followed on a charge of assault and battery and the employer was\r\ndischarged for lack of evidence.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago a white resident of another Chicago suburb applied to\r\nthe juvenile court for the guardianship of a colored girl. The court,\r\nbeing unable to handle the case, requested the advice of the Chicago\r\nUrban League. The details of the case were substantially as follows:\r\n\r\nA Roman Catholic organization in Jamaica, British West Indies, sent\r\nten or twelve Jamaican girls to the United States, upon applications\r\nof housekeepers, to serve as domestics. Some verbal agreement had been\r\nentered into whereby the girls were to accept service as domestics and\r\nwork out the cost of transportation and clothing at a stipulated rate\r\nper week. The arrangement seems to have progressed fairly until the girls\r\nbecame acquainted with other colored people residing in the neighborhood.\r\nIt was then discovered that they were working at a wage considerably\r\nlower than the usual wage. The girl in question, who was a minor but\r\nseems to have misrepresented her age when applying for a passport, was\r\nreceiving $6.00 per week, one dollar of which was paid in cash and the\r\nbalance deducted to cover the expense of clothing and transportation.\r\nAfter becoming dissatisfied with these wages, the girl left the home\r\nof her white employer, who sought to be appointed her guardian so that\r\nhe could restrain her. A guardian has not thus far been appointed, for\r\nthe reason that the legal status of the girl and the legality of the\r\ncontract entered into are doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EMPLOYERS' EXPERIENCE WITH NEGRO LABOR\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Negroes in large numbers into manufacturing industries\r\nand clerical occupations is one of the striking facts shown by this\r\ninvestigation. Shortage of labor due to war conditions created many\r\nopenings for the Negro. Whether he will remain in these fields and become\r\nan increasingly important factor in them will depend in a large degree\r\nupon his efficiency and reliability, as well as upon absence of racial\r\nfriction, satisfactory wages, etc. It was therefore deemed important to\r\nlearn how the Negro improved his industrial opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Commission made some investigation of this subject, seeking the\r\nopinion of as many employers as possible who had had experience with\r\nNegro workers. The inquiry covered two points: (1) a general question in\r\nthe preliminary questionnaire, to learn whether Negro labor had proved\r\nsatisfactory; and (2) a comparison of the Negro with the white worker\r\nin efficiency, reliability, regularity, and labor turnover. The facts\r\nunder each head are considered separately below, following a brief\r\nconsideration of the difference between the southern and northern Negro.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN NEGROES COMPARED\r\n\r\nMany employers drew a distinction between the recent southern migrants\r\nand northern Negroes, and commented upon certain shortcomings of the\r\nformer, although they expressed themselves as satisfied on the whole\r\nwith Negro labor.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the representative of a foundry company with 200 Negroes\r\nout of a total of 950 employees said:\r\n\r\n     It appears to me that the men coming from the South get here\r\n     and for a limited length of time seem to have a different view\r\n     of things. They do things that probably the Chicago Negro\r\n     wouldn't do. They don't seem to know exactly how to control\r\n     themselves. They are unsettled and to a great degree unsteady.\r\n     The northern-born Negro is more active. He is brighter in a way\r\n     and a little more ambitious. The southern Negroes are inclined\r\n     to work today, lay off tomorrow, and be back the next day on\r\n     the job again.\r\n\r\nA representative of a large machinery-manufacturing establishment\r\nemploying 1,500 Negroes out of a total of 23,000 employees in Chicago\r\nexpressed the same opinion in these words:\r\n\r\n     Our experience with Negroes has a tendency to show that these\r\n     people do not realize that there is such a thing as steady work.\r\n     They work for possibly a week or two, then say they are obliged\r\n     to lay off for some imaginary cause and will probably return\r\n     within a week or four weeks. We believe they are improving\r\n     and will be better as time goes on and they become more used\r\n     to the way work and business are done in the North.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of a foundry which increased its Negro employees in\r\nfive years from six to 125 out of a total of 466 employees was of the\r\nfollowing opinion:\r\n\r\n     The Negro up here from the South never heard of working six\r\n     days a week and being on time every morning and staying until\r\n     the job was done. It is entirely foreign to his idea of things,\r\n     but with a little persistent effort and showing him that it\r\n     is necessary he soon learns the system the same as the others,\r\n     and I do not believe he is any worse than the white man after\r\n     he has been here a year or two.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of a company employing more that 2,000 Negroes out\r\nof a total of 10,000 employees in Chicago declared:\r\n\r\n     The southern Negroes have not yet become thoroughly reconciled\r\n     to working six days a week. Down South they are accustomed\r\n     to taking off Saturdays, and they are quite frequently absent\r\n     on Saturday. That is not true of the colored man who has been\r\n     with us a long time. He is accustomed to the regularity of six\r\n     days a week, but the men from the South have the weakness of\r\n     being away on Saturdays.\r\n\r\nIn general it was the employers of large numbers of Negroes who\r\ndifferentiated between the southern and the northern Negro. Employers\r\nof Negroes in small numbers were more inclined to judge all Negroes by\r\nthose recently arrived from the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. NEGRO LABOR SATISFACTORY\r\n\r\nOne of the questions contained in the preliminary questionnaire was: \"Has\r\nyour Negro labor proved satisfactory?\" Of 137 questionnaires returned by\r\nestablishments employing five or more Negro workers, 118 reported that\r\nNegro labor had proved satisfactory and nineteen that it had not proved\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these returns is disclosed by Table XXVI, in which\r\nthe establishments are classified by industries, and the number of Negro\r\nemployees in establishments reporting Negro labor satisfactory is shown\r\nto be 21,640 as contrasted with 697 Negro employees in the nineteen\r\nestablishments reporting Negro labor unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXVI\r\n\r\n       NEGRO LABOR SATISFACTORY OR UNSATISFACTORY IN ESTABLISHMENTS\r\n                         CLASSIFIED BY INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n   ===================+==========+=========+================+=================\r\n                      |          |         | ESTABLISHMENTS | ESTABLISHMENTS\r\n                      |          |         |    REPORTING   |    REPORTING\r\n                      |          |         |   NEGRO LABOR  |   NEGRO LABOR\r\n                      |          |         |  SATISFACTORY  | UNSATISFACTORY\r\n                      |  TOTAL   | TOTAL   +------+---------+------+----------\r\n        INDUSTRY      |  NUMBER  |Negroes  |      |Number of|      |Number of\r\n                      |Establish-|EMPLOYED |      | Negroes |      | Negroes\r\n                      |  MENTS   |         |Number|Employed |Number|Employed\r\n                      |          |         |      |in These |      |in These\r\n                      |          |         |      | Estab-  |      | Estab-\r\n                      |          |         |      |lishments|      |lishments\r\n   -------------------+----------+---------+------+---------+------+----------\r\n   Manufacturing:     |          |         |      |         |      |\r\n     Clothing         |        9 |     203 |    8 |     191 |    1 |      12\r\n     Food products    |        8 |   7,597 |    7 |   7,547 |    1 |      50\r\n     Iron and steel   |       27 |   3,879 |   22 |   3,750 |    5 |     129\r\n     Tanneries        |        7 |     462 |    6 |     421 |    1 |      41\r\n     Miscellaneous[69]|       18 |     713 |   13 |     464 | 5[70]|     249\r\n                      +----------+---------+------+---------+------+----------\r\n       Totals         |       69 |  12,854 |   56 |  12,373 |   13 |     481\r\n                      |          |         |      |         |      |\r\n   Non-manufacturing: |          |         |      |         |      |\r\n     Railroads        |       16 |   5,408 |   16 |   5,408 |      |\r\n     Hotels           |        9 |     923 |    8 |     911 |    1 |      12\r\n     Laundries        |       20 |     764 |   16 |     587 |    4 |     177\r\n     Mail order       |        2 |   1,773 |    2 |   1,773 |      |\r\n     Public service   |        4 |      42 |    4 |      42 |      |\r\n     Taxicab upkeep   |        1 |     250 |    1 |     250 |      |\r\n     Miscellaneous[70]|       16 |     323 |   15 |     296 |    1 |      27\r\n                      +----------+---------+------+---------+------+----------\r\n       Totals         |       68 |   9,483 |   62 |   9,267 |    6 |     216\r\n                      +----------+---------+------+---------+------+----------\r\n       Totals, all    |          |         |      |         |      |\r\n         industries   |      137 |  22,337 |  118 |  21,640 |   19 |     697\r\n   -------------------+----------+---------+------+---------+------+----------\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NEGRO AND WHITE LABOR COMPARED\r\n\r\nAt a conference at which Negro and white workers were under discussion a\r\nlarge foundry representative suggested that such a comparison was unfair\r\nto the Negro because he was still a newcomer in manufacturing industries\r\nand could not be expected to be as efficient, reliable, and regular as\r\nthe white worker who had been thus engaged much longer. Other employers\r\nfelt that this point should be borne in mind.\r\n\r\n_Efficiency._--Comparing the efficiency of the Negro worker and the white\r\nworker, seventy-one employers interviewed (thirty-four manufacturing\r\nand thirty-seven non-manufacturing establishments) considered the Negro\r\nequally efficient, and twenty-two employers (thirteen manufacturing and\r\nnine non-manufacturing) considered the Negro less efficient.[71]\r\n\r\nThe seventy-one establishments which reported Negro labor as equally\r\nefficient as white labor included all of the large employers of Negro\r\nlabor, with very few exceptions. Ability shown by Negro workers in widely\r\ndissimilar occupations and industries was commented upon. The following\r\ninstances are of interest:\r\n\r\nFoundries: \"Our star molder in the foundry is a Negro who has been with\r\nus twenty years. Our best truck driver is a Negro who has been with us\r\nabout eighteen years.\" \"About the best grinder we have in one department\r\nis a colored man.\" The superintendent of a large foundry employing 125\r\nNegroes said:\r\n\r\n     I covered thirty foundries, members of the National Association\r\n     when I was serving on a certain Committee, and I know that\r\n     in their departments Negroes have made very good. Out of the\r\n     thirty foundries, there are half or more which have colored\r\n     men in now which did not have colored men two years ago. One\r\n     of the instances, a little foundry I know of, had four men in\r\n     the grinding department; one colored man and his partner wanted\r\n     to take the job of running the grinding room. The partner\r\n     wanted to do it all himself, and is now doing what four men\r\n     were doing formerly.\r\n\r\nThat the Negro is apt in learning new work is illustrated by an instance\r\ncited by the same superintendent:\r\n\r\n     I know of a Pullman porter who has been with the Pullman Company\r\n     twenty years who turned out to be as good a helper as we had\r\n     in the foundry. Take a man who has made beds for twenty years,\r\n     put him to carrying melted iron in a ladle, which is a real\r\n     man's job, and make good at it, and I think he's going some!\r\n     We had one man who did that and did it well. He was a helper\r\n     that the different foremen tried to get hold of, wanted to\r\n     have him with them.\r\n\r\nPublic service: The probation department of the juvenile court reported\r\nsix Negro employees. \"The colored employees are intelligent, efficient\r\npersons. With one exception they are probation officers. One employee\r\nis in charge of the probation clerk's office and not only works with\r\nwhite clerks but directs the work of nine white persons.\"\r\n\r\nThe office of the recorder of deeds reports seventeen Negro employees\r\nin the folio or record-writing department. \"The employees are marked\r\non their efficiency. Percentages of efficiency run from 94.5 to 98 per\r\ncent among the colored clerks, and several of them averaged 97.9 per\r\ncent and 98 per cent for the past three years.\"\r\n\r\nStock Yards: \"Negroes make skilled workmen. They are among the best of\r\nwhat are known as 'knife-men' we have.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Negro labor shows greater efficiency in a working unit composed\r\nentirely of colored workers or in a mixed unit of Negro and white workers\r\nis an unsettled question. Only a few employers expressed an opinion on\r\nthis point (not affording a sufficient basis for generalization), but it\r\nis interesting to note that of four foundries, one favored the separate\r\nunit and three the mixed unit, while a large food-products company had\r\nfound both satisfactory.\r\n\r\nSeveral employers mentioned the fact that, because of his knowledge of\r\nEnglish, the Negro is frequently more efficient than the foreign-speaking\r\nworker. One wool warehouse company, for example, reported that Poles were\r\nsatisfactory under the old method of shipping wool in carloads from a\r\nsingle shipper, but the new system, with shipments of hundreds of sacks\r\ntagged with the names of as many shippers, required laborers unloading\r\nthe cars to separate the shipments into sections. This the Poles were\r\nunable to do, while the Negroes did the work very efficiently.\r\n\r\n_Reliability._--Does the Negro require more supervision than the white\r\nworker in order to secure equally good results? An opinion was expressed\r\non this point by ninety-two employers; sixty-three (thirty manufacturing\r\nand thirty-three non-manufacturing establishments) considered that\r\nthe Negro did not require more supervision while twenty-eight (sixteen\r\nmanufacturing and thirteen non-manufacturing establishments) considered\r\nthat he did. The general superintendents of two of the large packing\r\ncompanies expressed contrary views on this point during one of the\r\nconferences. One said:\r\n\r\n     Negroes do not require as much supervision as some of those\r\n     racial groups who do not understand the language. We can talk\r\n     to a man and tell him what to do, where to go to do the work\r\n     and how to do it, we can accomplish a whole lot more than if\r\n     we had to send an individual with him constantly from place to\r\n     place to show him how to do it. To that extent the Negro has\r\n     the advantage over the man who cannot talk the English language.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the other company expressed the opinion that\r\nNegroes require more supervision than white workers:\r\n\r\n     For example, when they are working together in groups,\r\n     especially after pay-day, they are inclined to wander into\r\n     isolated spots and shoot craps. We've a good deal of trouble\r\n     of that kind. They spend their money when they get it more\r\n     recklessly than white people.\r\n\r\nThe representative of a food-products company with 500 Negro employees\r\nin the working force of 3,000 stated that the company had found no need\r\nof greater supervision of Negro workers than of white.\r\n\r\nA representative of a taxicab company employing 250 colored workers stated:\r\n\r\n     We have some colored employees we trust absolutely and as far\r\n     as any white employees. We have some colored men in the garage,\r\n     and they take more supervision not because they are colored\r\n     but because they lack education and are shiftless, but this\r\n     you would find in the same grade of white workers.\r\n\r\nA preliminary questionnaire returned by the president of a laundry company\r\nemploying eighty-two Negroes out of a total of 110 employees reported:\r\n\r\n     We have a number of exceptionally good and reliable Negro\r\n     employees. These men and women need very little supervision.\r\n     We get some, who have never worked in industries, who require\r\n     more supervision and are not very steady. On the whole we are\r\n     pleased with our Negro employees.\r\n\r\n_Regularity._--Of the employers interviewed, fifty-seven (twenty-three\r\nmanufacturing and thirty-four non-manufacturing establishments) expressed\r\nan opinion that \"absenteeism\" among colored workers was no greater than\r\namong white workers, while thirty-six employers (twenty-four manufacturing\r\nand twelve non-manufacturing establishments) reported that it was greater.\r\nIn this connection the habits of the southern Negro, commented upon\r\nabove, would naturally exercise great influence. The superintendent of\r\none of the packing companies employing 2,084 Negroes reported:\r\n\r\n     Previous to the war and up to the war the Negro was the poorest\r\n     in attendance in the plant. Since the war his attendance\r\n     compares favorably with any other class of employees in the\r\n     Yards. It is pretty hard to explain excepting this, as they\r\n     lived here longer they acquired better habits, I mean more\r\n     ambition, and ambition brought about the necessity for better\r\n     methods of living, better clothing, and they required more\r\n     money and I guess they found out in a short time that work\r\n     brought its compensations.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to work and accumulate a little and then take a vacation\r\nis no more pronounced among the colored workers than among the white\r\nworkers, according to the representative of a food-products company\r\nemploying 500 Negroes out of a total of 3,000 employees.\r\n\r\n_Labor turnover and \"hope on the job.\"_--Of the fifty-two employers\r\nexpressing an opinion on the comparative labor turnover of Negro\r\nand white workers twenty-four (eleven manufacturing and thirteen\r\nnon-manufacturing establishments) considered the labor turnover about\r\nequal, and twenty-eight (eighteen manufacturing and ten non-manufacturing\r\nestablishments) considered the turnover greater among the Negro workers.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the question of labor turnover among Negroes is\r\nthe question of \"hope on the job,\" as one alert Negro expressed it. The\r\ndesire to secure improved conditions of work and higher wages is shared\r\nby all workers irrespective of race. If Negro workers are not allowed to\r\nadvance to better positions in a given plant, or if they are discriminated\r\nagainst by having their efficiency underrated by foremen, the turnover\r\nof Negro labor will naturally be high. The attitude of foremen largely\r\ndetermines whether Negro workers will succeed or fail. Superintendents\r\nof large plants realizing this fact have taken special care to educate\r\nforemen in the treatment of Negro labor.\r\n\r\nFor example, the superintendent of a tannery with 175 Negroes out of a\r\ntotal of 600 employees notified his foremen that he intended to use Negro\r\nlabor, and that any foreman who felt that he could not teach colored\r\nworkers would have to yield his place to someone who could. Frequent\r\nlectures to foremen were necessary to make them realize that fairness to\r\nNegro labor meant tolerance of a beginner's awkwardness and shortcomings\r\nand refraining from the use of insulting terms such as \"nigger,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnother company reported that when it attempted to fill skilled positions\r\nwith Negroes the foremen said they would never be able to teach them as\r\nlong as they lived. \"It couldn't be done.\" The foremen were told they\r\nhad to do it, and they now agree that it can be done and are \"quite won\r\nover to the point of employing Negroes.\" The experience of this plant\r\nled the superintendent to the conclusion that no particular race is\r\nespecially fitted for any given kind of work.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of a foundry employing 2,500 men, of whom 427 are\r\nNegroes, said:\r\n\r\n     The foremen told me one time that they never could get a\r\n     colored man to grind because he was afraid of the wheel. I\r\n     thought we'd better try out a few of them. We found that was\r\n     not the fact at all. One of the best grinders we now have is\r\n     a colored man.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the attitude of foremen toward colored labor, the\r\nsuperintendent of another large foundry made this significant statement:\r\n\r\n     I think 50 per cent of what trouble we who employ Negro labor\r\n     have is due to inefficient foremen, and the failure is in\r\n     the foreman directly over the man to understand the Negro.\r\n     As I see it, the Negro must be handled differently from the\r\n     Pole whom we have usually had in the common labor capacity.\r\n     We cannot handle the Negro the same as we could the Pole. Our\r\n     foremen have not been accustomed here in Chicago in our shops\r\n     to handling Negroes, and at times I have a real fight to see\r\n     a Negro get an absolutely square deal.\r\n\r\nThe industrial secretary of the Chicago Urban League, referring to a\r\nlarge firm engaged in the manufacture of machinery, remarked:\r\n\r\n     I find the attitude of the company liberal. Negroes are\r\n     advanced to high-grade positions, although some foremen need\r\n     education in order to have them take the proper attitude toward\r\n     the employment of Negroes. One foreman set their efficiency\r\n     down to 75 per cent; the matter was taken to the efficiency\r\n     department and his statement was found to be untrue. This bears\r\n     out the point that Negroes will not succeed where foremen do\r\n     not intend them to succeed.\r\n\r\nDespite occasional statements that the Negro is slow or shiftless,\r\nthe volume of evidence before the Commission shows that Negroes are\r\nsatisfactory employees and compare favorably with other racial groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. NEGRO WOMEN IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nBefore the war created openings in industry for Negro women, they were\r\neven more definitely restricted in their choice of occupations than were\r\nNegro men. Restricted opportunity is evident from the fact that, in 1910,\r\nalmost two-thirds of the gainfully occupied Negro women in Chicago were\r\nengaged in two occupational groups, \"servants\" and \"laundresses not in\r\nlaundries,\" these being included among those in domestic and personal\r\nservice who numbered more than three-fourths. The enumeration of Negro\r\nwomen gainfully employed in Chicago in 1910 classified in the census\r\naccording to industries is given in Table XXVII.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO WOMEN AND GIRLS EMPLOYED IN A LAMP-SHADE FACTORY\r\n   Work room is poorly lighted and generally unattractive.]\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXVII\r\n\r\n            NEGRO WOMEN GAINFULLY OCCUPIED IN CHICAGO IN 1910,\r\n                         CLASSIFIED BY INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n     ========================================+=========+===========\r\n                                             |         | Percentage\r\n                  Industry                   |  Number |  of Total\r\n     ----------------------------------------+---------+-----------\r\n     Manufacturing and mechanical industries |    998  |     11\r\n     Trade and transportation                |     96  |      1\r\n     Professional service                    |    323  |      4\r\n     Clerical occupations                    |    163  |      2\r\n     Domestic and personal service:          |         |\r\n       Laundresses not in laundries          |  2,115} |\r\n       Servants                              |  3,512} |     78\r\n       Other domestic and personal service   |  1,336} |\r\n     General and unclassified occupations    |    337  |      4\r\n                                             +---------+-----------\r\n       Total gainfully occupied              |  8,880  |    100\r\n     ----------------------------------------+---------+-----------\r\n\r\n                               TABLE XXVIII\r\n\r\n  NEGRO WOMEN IN FIFTY ESTABLISHMENTS CLASSIFIED BY INDUSTRIES IN 1920[72]\r\n\r\n   ==============================+==========+=========+=========|============\r\n                                 |Number of |         |  Total  |   Total\r\n                                 |Establish-|  Total  |  Negro  |Negro Women\r\n           Industry              |   ments  |Employees|Employees| Employees\r\n                                 |Reporting |         |         |\r\n   ------------------------------+----------+---------+---------+------------\r\n   Manufacturing:                |          |         |         |\r\n     Tanneries                   |     1    |     600 |    175  |      50\r\n     Iron and steel              |     3    |  10,435 |  1,729  |      74\r\n     Slaughtering and packing    |     3    |  20,990 |  4,818  |     437\r\n     Cooperage                   |     2    |     327 |    106  |      30\r\n     Clothing                    |     9    |   1,405 |    203  |     202\r\n     Other needle trades         |     3    |     775 |    325  |     325\r\n     Box making (paper)          |     3    |     995 |    143  |     104\r\n     Miscellaneous               |     3    |   1,543 |     95  |      73\r\n                                 +----------+---------+---------+------------\r\n       Totals                    |    27    |  37,070 |  7,594  |   1,295\r\n                                 |          |         |         |\r\n   Non-manufacturing:[73]        |          |         |         |\r\n     Hotels                      |     4    |     550 |    250  |      69\r\n     Taxicab upkeep              |     1    |   1,600 |    250  |     100\r\n     Laundries                   |    16    |   1,511 |    664  |     543\r\n     Mail order                  |          |         |         |\r\n       (clerical occupations)[74]|     2    |     ... |  1,773  |   1,400\r\n                                 +----------+---------+---------+------------\r\n       Totals                    |    23    |     ... |  2,937  |   2,112\r\n   ------------------------------+----------+---------+---------+------------\r\n\r\nTo learn the special problems concerning Negro women in industry,\r\none conference was devoted to the industries recently opened to them.\r\nRepresentatives of four establishments employing a total of 1,713 Negro\r\nwomen attended the conference. The investigation of the 101 establishments\r\n(employing five or more Negroes) disclosed the presence of women in a\r\nlarge majority of cases, but in a number of instances the management\r\nwas unable to tell the sex of workers from the records kept and gave the\r\ninvestigator the total number of Negroes employed without classification\r\nby sex. Of the 137 establishments reporting, forty-two had no Negro\r\nwomen employees; forty-five kept no separate sex records; fifty reported\r\nseparately the number of Negro women workers.\r\n\r\nComparing the industries in which Negro women were employed in 1910 with\r\nthe figures quoted for 1920, a striking increase is seen in the total\r\nengaged in manufacturing, 998 being the total Negro women reported for\r\nall manufacturing establishments in Chicago in 1910, as compared with\r\n1,295 Negro women reported by twenty-seven establishments in 1920.\r\n\r\nComparisons for special industries and occupations show the contrasts\r\nbetween 1910 and 1920 in Table XXIX.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXIX\r\n\r\n   =================================================+======+=======+==========\r\n                                                    |      |       |Number of\r\n                       Industry                     | 1910 | 1920  |Establish-\r\n                                                    |      |       |  ments\r\n   -------------------------------------------------+------+-------+----------\r\n   Sewers and sewing-machine operators in factories |   25 |   527 |    12\r\n   Slaughtering and packing-house operatives        |    8 |   437 |     3\r\n   Box making (paper)                               |    3 |   104 |     3\r\n   Tanneries                                        |    0 |    50 |     1\r\n   Clerical occupations                             |  163 | 1,400 |     2\r\n   Laundry operatives                               |  184 |   543 |    16\r\n   Taxicab cleaning                                 |    0 |   100 |     1\r\n   -------------------------------------------------+------+-------+----------\r\n\r\nLabor shortage was given as the reason for employing Negro women and\r\ngirls by all of the firms employing them in large numbers. The outlook\r\nfor Negro women in industry when there is a labor surplus is uncertain.\r\nEmployers employing 1,713 Negro women represented at a conference,\r\nMay 18, 1920, agreed that there were no indications of a reduction of\r\nemployment. This question is considered at length hereafter in \"Future\r\nof the Negro in Chicago Industries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS WITH NEGRO WOMEN WORKERS\r\n\r\nEmployers' opinions regarding the character of Negro labor without\r\nreference to sex were considered above. Particular comments concerning\r\nmale workers were quoted there, comments upon women workers are now\r\ngiven. Four employers of Negro women in large numbers within the past\r\ntwo years gave the Commission the benefit of their experience. They were\r\ntwo mail-order concerns, a manufacturer of automobile spring cushions,\r\nand a wholesale millinery shop.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO WOMEN EMPLOYED ON POWER MACHINES IN A LARGE APRON\r\n   FACTORY\r\n   This concern when it increased its number of Negro women combined its\r\n   four shops and moved into this modern daylight factory building.]\r\n\r\nThe mail-order house which established a large office for Negro entry\r\nclerks in September, 1918, was the first to try the experiment. It had\r\nno precedent to guide it and \"did not know how the colored girl would\r\nact in business.\" The unit was opened with ninety girls, and increased in\r\nthe fall of 1919 to 650 girls, who were given the promise of advancement\r\nand Negro supervision. In the early summer of 1920, when the investigator\r\nvisited this office, there were 311 girls at work, as follows:\r\n\r\n     Operators on Elliott-Fisher machines   30\r\n     Mail-order workers                     76\r\n     Instructing new girls                   9\r\n     Checkers                              138\r\n     Supervisors                             5\r\n     Mail opening, sorting, etc.            27\r\n     Posting                                26\r\n\r\nThey were above the average in education, 75 per cent being high-school\r\ngraduates and 12 per cent having had two or more years in college.\r\n\r\nThe employment manager said that misunderstandings had arisen\r\noccasionally, due to the colored girl being oversensitive and suspicious.\r\n\"The colored girl seems to suspect that her employer is going to put\r\nsomething over on her. She is suspicious of any whites that come in her\r\nvicinity and is ready to believe that any white person is prejudiced\r\nagainst her on account of race.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negro welfare worker for this unit suggested that what might seem\r\nsupersensitiveness was often overzealousness on the part of girls who have\r\nnot had experience enough to judge their limitations or qualifications.\r\nBeing eager to succeed, they are very much disappointed when advancement\r\ndoes not reward their efforts: \"I think the best type of colored girl\r\nwe have in business is very ambitious. This is her first opportunity,\r\nand she feels that she is really a pioneer making history for her race.\r\nShe is possibly a little overzealous, but can be made to get the right\r\nattitude and accept it all very gracefully.\"\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of Negro girls, in the opinion of the employment\r\nmanager, was an \"excitable nature\" which made it possible for a good\r\nleader to influence them readily:\r\n\r\n     They complain of a change of supervisors, for instance. You\r\n     attempt to shift supervisors from one point of the office to\r\n     another and you immediately receive a petition signed by all\r\n     the girls, saying, \"We love So-and-So, and please don't change\r\n     her.\" This is not to be criticized too harshly, but it does\r\n     represent something that does go on. It shows inexperience. The\r\n     white girl would expect that those things would take place.\r\n     The colored girl, not having been in the office very long,\r\n     would feel that the fact that the supervisor was changed was\r\n     something derogatory to the supervisor.\r\n\r\n     The whites didn't want to act as instructors, and the colored\r\n     girls didn't want to receive instructions from the whites. By\r\n     being very careful in the girls that were selected, and showing\r\n     the white girls where they were wrong, and then attempting to\r\n     show the colored people that these girls were not to exercise\r\n     supervision, but were merely to be instructors, both sides\r\n     came to an understanding on it, and we had pretty good results.\r\n     The white girls that we had over there became very used to it\r\n     and usually hated to leave, but we have always insisted that\r\n     they leave as soon as the girls learned the work.\r\n\r\nDuring the conference on Negro women in industry the representative of\r\nthis mail-order establishment was asked why the Negro workers were put\r\ninto a separate unit instead of being intermingled with white girls. He\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n     The first reason is that we haven't any room. The second is,\r\n     I imagine, because the officials who started the office and\r\n     who have carried it on since felt that it wouldn't be policy.\r\n     We haven't discussed the question because we've never had\r\n     occasion to consider such a move seriously. Our main office\r\n     is not large enough to accommodate any more employees than\r\n     we have white employees in the house. We keep that office\r\n     constantly recruited up to its present strength, and there has\r\n     never been any necessity or any reason to seriously consider\r\n     bringing colored girls in with the white girls....\r\n\r\n     Another thing to consider there would be the type of girl that\r\n     we employ. They are all young girls, mostly under twenty-five\r\n     years, and they don't think for themselves; they are influenced\r\n     very easily by what other girls say. You take one girl in an\r\n     office of that size who was very anti-colored, and it wouldn't\r\n     be very long until her sentiment would spread and pretty soon\r\n     you'd have a strong sentiment against the colored girls.\r\n\r\n     If a colored girl should want to obtain employment in that\r\n     part of our concern where we now employ all white girls, even\r\n     if she were very competent she would undoubtedly have some\r\n     trouble in securing employment in that department.\r\n\r\nThe result of the experiment with the colored unit, he said, was highly\r\nsatisfactory: \"We have been very favorably impressed.... The girls have\r\nmade very rapid progress, in fact they surprised all of us. Their progress\r\nalong lines of leadership, as supervisors, etc., has been remarkable.\"\r\n\r\nAbout six weeks after this conference the colored unit was closed. The\r\nreasons given were lack of business, trouble with the lessor of the\r\noffice, and failure to find another convenient location. A letter of\r\nrecommendation was given to each employee showing that her service had\r\nbeen satisfactory, and a letter was also sent to the Urban League, through\r\nwhich the women had been employed, explaining why it had been necessary\r\nto close the office and emphasizing the fact that this action should not\r\nbe considered in any sense a reflection upon the Negro workers employed.\r\n\r\nThe other mail-order house opened a unit for Negro women in the fall\r\nof 1918, with 650 women who worked until the end of the \"fall rush\" in\r\nJanuary, 1919. In the following fall the unit was again opened, with\r\n1,050 Negro women; and the office was still in operation in 1920. This\r\noffice was just outside the \"Loop\" district. The sudden influx of Negro\r\ngirls there caused complaints by the local restaurants, fearing the loss\r\nof old patrons in handling this new business. The company then installed\r\nan \"at cost\" cafeteria service. The work of these girls was clerical,\r\nbilling, labeling, addressing, etc. Considering their inexperience,\r\ntheir service has been highly satisfactory. The employment manager said:\r\n\"It's not a defect in their minds, it's a defect in the country. They\r\nhaven't had the opportunity to gain the education and experience needed\r\nfor responsibility; the Negro girl is equal to the Italian or Bohemian\r\nin working ability and superior for executive work, such as instructing\r\nor supervising.\" Among 143 girls interviewed in the entry offices of\r\nthese two mail-order houses only three expressed dissatisfaction with\r\nthe conditions of work. The girls seemed to take pride in the fact that\r\nthey had succeeded in \"making good\" in a new and attractive field of work.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of the establishment manufacturing automobile spring\r\ncushions had a very modest beginning. A factory was rented in the Negro\r\nresidential area on the South Side, and twenty machines were installed\r\nto test out Negro women as sewing-machine operators. Gradually the\r\nnumber increased to 120 in this plant, and a second plant was opened in\r\nthe same vicinity with about the same number of operators. During the\r\nyear 1919-20 there were 250 Negro women employed as machine operators\r\nin these two plants. The superintendent considered that they required\r\nless supervision than the white workers in the company's other shops\r\nand rated them equal to white workers in efficiency. \"We could take our\r\nbest white girl and our best colored girl, and they earn about the same\r\namount of money on piecework rates, in the same number of hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the wholesale millinery establishment represented\r\nin conference considered that the employment of Negro women in that\r\nindustry had outgrown the experimental stage. Although a long period\r\nof training is necessary in order to become a skilled milliner (four\r\nyears for hand sewers, eight years for machine operators), Negro women\r\nwere keen to learn the trade and willing to accept the low wages paid\r\nto beginners. Of the forty-seven Negro women employed on the day of the\r\ninvestigator's visit, thirty-three received less than $12.00 a week\r\nand forty-two received less than $15.00 a week. These women were all\r\nemployed as hand sewers, and in the opinion of the superintendent they\r\nhad done \"just as well as the white. They learn as quickly and are as\r\npersevering, and in every respect equal to the whites as far as their\r\nwork is concerned. We are absolutely satisfied with their work.\"\r\n\r\nOther industries in which Negro women are engaged in considerable\r\nnumbers include laundering, the manufacture of clothing, lamp shades,\r\ngas mantles, paper boxes, barrels, and cheese making. An investigator\r\nfrom the Commission visited establishments employing Negro women in each\r\nof these industries.\r\n\r\n_Laundry operatives._--The fact that 543 Negro women laundry operatives\r\nwere reported by sixteen laundries, as contrasted with 184 in all Chicago\r\nlaundries in 1910, gives evidence of an increase in the number of Negro\r\nwomen in this field proportionately much greater than the increase in\r\nNegro population in Chicago in the same decade. The opportunity to work\r\nin a laundry was practically denied to Negro women until labor shortage\r\nforced laundry owners to tap this reserve labor supply. Negro women were\r\neager to desert work as domestic servants and \"family washer-women,\"\r\nwith the social stigma and restricted human contact involved, to enter\r\nlaundries where more independence was possible, hours were better\r\nstandardized, and association with fellow-workers enlivened the work\r\nday. The employment department of the Urban League experienced great\r\ndifficulty in supplying the demand for domestic servants and laundresses\r\nin the home, but had no difficulty in filling openings in laundries.\r\n\r\nThe work of Negro women in this field has proved satisfactory except\r\nin a few establishments. Of the twenty laundries which reported Negro\r\nlabor satisfactory or unsatisfactory (included in Table XXVI), four\r\nfailed to report separate figures covering male and female employees.\r\nOf the remaining sixteen establishments, twelve, with a total of 409\r\nNegro women, reported Negro labor satisfactory, and four with a total\r\nof 134 Negro women, reported Negro labor unsatisfactory. The complaint\r\nin two instances was unwillingness to work overtime and on Sundays. In\r\nboth these instances the employees interviewed complained that hours\r\nwere long (nine-hour day) and the treatment by the management harsh and\r\ninconsiderate.\r\n\r\nLaundries which did not make a practice of requiring overtime and Sunday\r\nwork found Negro women workers cheerful, loyal, and industrious. The\r\nemployees interviewed in these establishments expressed satisfaction\r\nwith working conditions and with hours.\r\n\r\nOne efficiently managed laundry, employing seventy-six Negro women and\r\nsix Negro men, out of a total of 110 employees, reported: \"We have a\r\nnumber of exceptionally good and loyal Negro employees. These men and\r\nwomen need very little supervision. We got some who have never worked\r\nin industries. They require more supervision and are not very steady.\r\nOn the whole, we are well pleased with our Negro employees.\"\r\n\r\n_Sewing-machine operators and sewers._--Denial of opportunity to enter\r\nthe sewing trades is evidenced by the small number of Negro women listed\r\nin the 1910 census as sewers and sewing-machine operators in factories,\r\nthe number being twenty-five. That this exclusion was not because of any\r\nnatural inaptitude for sewing is indicated by the fact that the 1910\r\ncensus listed 867 Negro women as seamstresses not in factories. Negro\r\nwomen have entered millinery work and proved apt hand workers; they have\r\nalso proved efficient sewing-machine operators in the manufacture of\r\nautomobile cushions. The lampshade manufacturers employed Negro women\r\nas hand sewers and found them to be efficient workers. The clothing\r\nestablishments which reported Negro women workers found them satisfactory\r\nmachine and hand workers, with the exception of one apron factory which\r\ncomplained that they are shiftless, often unreasonable, and do not stick\r\nto the job. An investigation of this establishment by the Urban League\r\ndisclosed the following facts: The shop was located in a shabby-looking,\r\nunclean store, inadequately heated by a coal stove. The work day was\r\nnine and one-half hours, and piece rates on several operations were so\r\nlow that it was impossible to earn a decent wage. In this case the large\r\nlabor turnover was evidently a healthy protest against poor working\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NEGRO WOMEN AND GIRLS IN A LARGE HAT-MAKING CONCERN\r\n   This shop has been partitioned for the accommodation of Negro women\r\n   workers. The workshop is unattractive and the lighting extremely poor\r\n   for the character of work required.]\r\n\r\n_Other industries._--Three paper-box-making plants employing Negro\r\nwomen were investigated. They reported that Negro women had proved\r\nunsatisfactory, either slow or lazy. The experience of a cheese factory\r\nis worth noting in this connection. Because Negro women appeared to be\r\nslow at their work it was decided to measure their tasks. It was then\r\nfound that many were doing as well as and some better than the white\r\ngirls in whose places they were working.\r\n\r\nWhether such tests had ever been made in the box-making plants does\r\nnot appear. The employees interviewed in one box factory complained of\r\nlow wages and no chance for advancement. Negro women in this plant were\r\naveraging only $2.40 a day. A cooperage company reported fifteen women\r\nstave carriers and fifteen machine operators. Negro labor in this plant\r\nwas reported satisfactory. Negro women in the garage of a taxicab company,\r\ncleaning automobiles, have shown themselves not afraid of hard work;\r\n100 Negro women were reported working in this capacity. Negro women as\r\nPullman-car cleaners have also proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nBefore the war Negro women were popularly thought of as a class of\r\nservants unfitted by nature for work calling for higher qualifications.\r\nIt is difficult to say how long this popular misconception might have\r\nsurvived had it not been for the labor shortage which forced employers\r\nto experiment with Negro women workers and to learn with surprise that\r\nthey were as teachable as white women and became as efficient workers\r\nafter receiving the necessary training.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. INDUSTRY AS THE NEGRO SEES IT\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ATTITUDE TOWARD INDUSTRIAL OPPORTUNITIES\r\n\r\nIn order to learn the attitude of the Negro toward his work, and his\r\nspecial problems, including the treatment accorded him by foremen and\r\nby fellow-workers, 865 Negro employees were interviewed by a Negro\r\ninvestigator at their work or at home. Less than 1 per cent of those\r\ninterviewed complained of disagreeable treatment by white workers.\r\nApproximately one-half had no complaints to make about conditions of\r\nwork. On the contrary, they expressed themselves as being glad of the\r\nopportunity to work and earn good wages.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of a large number of the workers interviewed is illustrated\r\nby the following:\r\n\r\n     C---- W---- was referred to in one of the industrial conferences\r\n     before the Commission. The superintendent of the foundry said\r\n     he was the \"star molder\" in the plant. When interviewed C----\r\n     W---- said he had come to Chicago in 1910 from Kentucky because\r\n     he was tired of being a flunkey. He had been in the high school\r\n     for two years, but could only get work as janitor in a public\r\n     building in his home town. After coming here he worked in a\r\n     foundry as a molder's helper until he learned the trade. \"I\r\n     was getting 38 cents an hour then, but I got on piecework and\r\n     my wages have steadily gone up. I'm an expert now and make as\r\n     much as any man in the place. I can quit any time I want to,\r\n     but the longer I work the more money it is for me, so I usually\r\n     work eight or nine hours a day. I am planning to educate my\r\n     girl with the best of them, buy a home before I'm too old,\r\n     and make life comfortable for my family. There is more chance\r\n     here to learn a trade than in the South. I live better, can\r\n     save more, and I feel more like a man.\"\r\n\r\n     R---- N----, who is working as a helper in the same foundry,\r\n     says he has just gone from one job to another. In the South\r\n     he worked on a section gang on the railroad most of the time.\r\n     \"Didn't have to know much to get a job on the section gang--just\r\n     able to lift.\" Friends here wrote him of the chances to make\r\n     money, so he came because he was just drifting anyway. When he\r\n     got here he thought Chicago was \"full of life.\" Every night\r\n     for a month he went to cabarets. He likes his work and his\r\n     wages. \"My wife can have her clothes fitted here; she can try\r\n     on a hat and if she don't want it she don't have to buy it.\r\n     I can go anywhere I please on the cars after I pay my fare,\r\n     and I can do any sort of work I know how to do.\"\r\n\r\n     When M---- G---- came to Chicago in 1900 he thought it \"the\r\n     biggest place in the world and the world didn't reach much\r\n     further. Life is easier here because you can make more money.\r\n     Working conditions are better than in the South, but they could\r\n     be better still.\" He worked as a butler in the South, but when\r\n     he came to Chicago he got out of personal service and became\r\n     a laborer in the Stock Yards. Later he went to Gary, Indiana,\r\n     to the steel works, where he is earning about $40.00 a week.\r\n     His wife is doing clerical work in a mail-order house and is\r\n     going to night school three nights a week to learn typing.\r\n\r\n     H---- B---- with his family left Mississippi in 1916 and came\r\n     to Chicago, where he found work as a coal heaver at $3.20 a day.\r\n     His wife sorted paper in a junk house at $10.00 a week, and his\r\n     daughter entered a canning department at the Stock Yards at\r\n     $18.00 a week. When Mr. B---- was interviewed in June, 1920,\r\n     he was working in the Stock Yards and earning $27.00 a week\r\n     for an eight-hour day. He said he didn't have to work nearly\r\n     as hard here as in the South and was earning enough money so\r\n     his wife could stay at home. \"In the South you had to work\r\n     whether you wanted to or not unless you were very sick. White\r\n     people did not work there as they do here. They made the Negro\r\n     do the work. Men and women had to work in the fields. A woman\r\n     was not permitted to remain at home if she felt like it. If\r\n     she was found at home some of the white people would come to\r\n     ask why she was not in the field and tell her she had better\r\n     get to the field or else abide by the consequences. After the\r\n     summer crops were all in, any of the white people could send\r\n     for any Negro woman to come and do the family washing at 75\r\n     cents to $1.00 a day. If she sent word she could not come she\r\n     had to send an excuse why she could not come. They were never\r\n     allowed to stay at home as long as they were able to go. Had\r\n     to take whatever they paid you for your work.\"\r\n\r\n     M---- H---- \"likes the air of doing things here.\" He is able to\r\n     earn enough to keep the family without having his wife go out\r\n     to work. There are four \"youngsters,\" the oldest being eight\r\n     years old. Mr. H---- came to Chicago in 1918 from Tennessee.\r\n     He complained that there was not much work for a man in his\r\n     home town. He did whatever odd jobs turned up. People there\r\n     were talking about the chances in Chicago, so he came here and\r\n     went to work as a monument setter on the West Side. Later he\r\n     found a better-paying job in a mattress factory and was able\r\n     to send for his family. He is now working in a foundry and\r\n     makes $35.00 a week but finds it hard to live on this. If he\r\n     can go to night school he feels he will be able to earn more\r\n     money.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. L---- works as an entry clerk in a mail-order house and\r\n     likes everything connected with the place. She used to be a\r\n     maid in a private family but says she wouldn't work in service\r\n     again \"for any money. I can save more when I'm in service, for\r\n     of course you get room and board, but the other things you have\r\n     to take--no place to entertain your friends but the kitchen,\r\n     and going in and out the back doors. I hated all that. Then,\r\n     no matter how early you got through work you could only go\r\n     out one night a week--they almost make you a slave. You can\r\n     do other work in Chicago and you don't have to work in such\r\n     places.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. L---- had taught school in Atlanta, Georgia. After her\r\n     husband died she had tried to get back in the school but\r\n     could not. Friends here advised her to move to Chicago, so she\r\n     sold her property in 1915 and came here. She got work in the\r\n     Stock Yards but gave music lessons on the side to help keep\r\n     up expenses. \"I hated the surroundings at the Yards and the\r\n     class of people who worked there, so when I had a chance to\r\n     work in a mail-order house I changed. The first work here was\r\n     filing. I learned it very quickly and tried so hard to make\r\n     good that they made me a supervisor.\" She likes the freedom\r\n     of the North and the opportunities to advance in work. Her\r\n     ambition is to get into the public schools as a teacher.\r\n\r\n     Miss T---- S----, twenty-two years old, started to work when\r\n     she was fourteen, helping her mother cook for a large family\r\n     in Lexington, Georgia. Her mother died when she was about\r\n     seventeen, and she continued to work in the same family about\r\n     three years. Then some relatives persuaded her to come north\r\n     with them in 1919. She worked as a waitress in Chicago until\r\n     her cousin got her a job in a box factory. \"I'll never work in\r\n     nobody's kitchen but my own any more. No, indeed! That's the\r\n     one thing that makes me stick to this job. You do have some\r\n     time to call your own, but when you're working in anybody's\r\n     kitchen, well, you're out of luck. You almost have to eat on\r\n     the run; you never get any time off, and you have to work half\r\n     the night, usually. I make more money here than I did down\r\n     South, but I can't save anything out of it--there are so many\r\n     places to go here, but down South you work, work, work, and\r\n     you have to save your money because you haven't any place to\r\n     spend it.\"\r\n\r\nMany of those interviewed were grateful for the opportunity to work\r\novertime at overtime rates. A number complained that they were able to\r\nspend but little time with their families, or in recreation, because\r\nthey were compelled to live in districts far from the plants in which\r\nthey worked, so that two, and often three, hours a day were wasted on\r\nthe cars. The Negroes who had come to Chicago within the past two or\r\nthree years as a rule were satisfied with conditions of work, including\r\nhours, wages, and treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. COMPLAINTS ABOUT CONDITIONS OF WORK\r\n\r\nAmong the Negroes who had lived in Chicago for a longer period the\r\nmost insistent complaint was lack of opportunity for advancement or\r\npromotion. This was occasionally coupled with the complaint that foremen\r\ndiscriminated in favor of the white workers. In certain industries no\r\ncomplaint of treatment by foremen was made, while approximately 10 per\r\ncent of those interviewed in three industries (mentioned below) complained\r\nof discrimination in favor of white workers, in the distribution of work,\r\nin recognition of efficiency, or in permitting the earning of overtime\r\nrates. The industries registering the greatest percentage of complaints\r\nwere: (1) foundry and iron and steel mills, (2) Stock Yards, and (3)\r\nrailroad dining-car and Pullman service. The common complaints in each\r\nof these fields are considered briefly below.\r\n\r\n_Foundries and iron and steel manufacturing._--The ninety-three Negro\r\nemployees interviewed in fourteen establishments in this field were of\r\ndifferent grades of skill: fifty-nine unskilled, twelve semi-skilled,\r\nnineteen skilled, and three apprentices to skilled trades. The length of\r\ntime in the plant varied from a week to twenty years (forty-one employees\r\nless than one year, and eighty less than five years). To the inquiry,\r\n\"Is anything wrong with your conditions of work?\" fifty answered, \"No\";\r\nsixteen complained that hours were too long (in these cases the men\r\nwere working a twelve-hour day and a seven-day week); ten complained\r\nof low wages; six that foremen or straw bosses were not fair in the\r\ndistribution of work or of \"heats\"; four complained that straight-time\r\npay only was allowed for overtime, three that working gangs were reduced\r\nwithout decreasing the work demanded or increasing the pay of the men\r\nwho remained; one thought that Negroes were paid lower wages than white\r\nworkers; one said the work in his plant was much dirtier than it need\r\nbe; and two were dissatisfied because shower or locker accommodations\r\nwere insufficient.\r\n\r\nA foundry company employing twenty Negroes out of a total of eighty\r\nemployees was one of the establishments reporting Negro labor\r\nunsatisfactory. Negroes interviewed there complained of harsh and unfair\r\ntreatment by bosses and said that Negroes usually did not stay longer\r\nthan thirty days. The employment manager of a large foundry employing 427\r\nNegroes out of a total of 2,488 employees told the investigator that the\r\nforemen in the plant would refuse to use Negroes if white labor could be\r\nobtained, and if such a time should come the foremen would have their\r\nway, because it took years to make a foreman, but a laborer could be\r\npicked up any day. The investigator was not permitted to interview any of\r\nthe employees at this plant, but he visited some of them at their homes.\r\nThey complained of harsh treatment by foremen, reduction in piece rates\r\nwithout notice, and discrimination in favor of white workers. The labor\r\nturnover reported by this plant was 70 per cent for Negro as compared\r\nwith 14 per cent for white workers. This contrast is readily accounted\r\nfor when the attitude of foremen toward Negroes is known.\r\n\r\nNegroes interviewed at one of the plants of another foundry company\r\nemploying seventy-five Negroes out of a total of 300 employees complained\r\nthat the foreman in one department established conditions discouraging to\r\nNegro workers. He had an even number of Negro and white workers employed\r\nas partners on a certain process of piecework rates, each doing one-half\r\nof a joint task. When a man was absent, partners would be shifted about\r\nso that a Negro worker would be left without a partner instead of a white\r\nman. This handicapped the single worker by slowing down the process so\r\nhe could not earn a full day's pay. Complaint was also made that the\r\nsame foreman allowed white workers to accumulate a supply of material\r\nfor their work, although he ordered Negro workers to stop this practice,\r\nthus forcing them to lose time in making frequent trips for material.\r\n\r\nIn a large iron and steel plant a few of the workers interviewed\r\ncomplained of unfair and abusive treatment by foremen. Numerous\r\ncomplaints had likewise come to the attention of the industrial secretary\r\nof the Urban League, who took the matter up with the chief of the\r\nindustrial-relations department of the company. An investigation was\r\nordered, and it was found that a certain foreman had made a threat to\r\ndrive all the \"niggers\" from the department. This foreman, who had been\r\nemployed by the company for more than sixteen years, was discharged\r\nas a result of the investigation. The company states that considerable\r\npressure has been brought to bear for the foreman's reinstatement, but\r\nthat it will not reinstate him because it wants his case to be a warning\r\nto others in the plant who may be prejudiced against Negro workers. The\r\ndischarged foreman has been told that he may seek employment with the\r\ncompany in some other capacity, with the loss of his seniority rights.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with conditions in the preceding cases, the investigator\r\nfound no complaints of mistreatment by foremen or other causes for\r\ndissatisfaction among Negro workers at another foundry which employs\r\n125 Negroes out of a total force of 466 employees. Negro labor in this\r\nfoundry was reported \"satisfactory\" and as efficient as white labor.\r\nThe attitude of foremen evidently contributed to the contentment and\r\nsuccess of Negroes in this plant.\r\n\r\n_Stock Yards._--Interviews with seventy-four Negroes employed in the\r\nStock Yards disclosed much dissatisfaction with treatment by foremen.\r\nSpecific instances of discrimination were cited in great detail, leaving\r\nno doubt in the mind of the investigator that these workers felt that\r\nthey did not have an equal chance with white workers in many departments\r\nin the Yards. Some of those interviewed were well pleased with the\r\ntreatment of present foremen, but had worked in other departments in\r\nthe same plants where they said foremen had been unfair and insulting\r\nto Negroes. The Negroes interviewed, with one exception, considered\r\ntheir treatment by white fellow-workers good or \"O.K.\" The following\r\nare typical of the complaints made by the men interviewed in three of\r\nthe large establishments in the Yards:\r\n\r\n     G---- R---- had worked in one plant in the Yards for four\r\n     years. He said that he was not given a chance to make overtime,\r\n     while Poles who had not been with the company as long as he\r\n     had were given this privilege.\r\n\r\n     Another worker had been dismissed by a foreman when a white\r\n     worker in the boiler room had shut off the supply of water\r\n     for washing hogs. No blame was attached to the real offender,\r\n     but the Negro worker was discharged. He wrote a letter to\r\n     the general superintendent, who investigated and ordered his\r\n     reinstatement. The foreman then tried to reinstate him as a\r\n     new hand, which would deprive him of his seniority rights.\r\n\r\n     Another worker interviewed said that one assistant foreman had\r\n     openly made the statement that he would not work with \"niggers.\"\r\n\r\n     The foreman over pipe fitters was accused of placing new\r\n     Negroes on the hardest work, with no one to give assistance.\r\n     He permitted white men to work as helpers for two or three\r\n     months, and then to quit for a month or two and return as pipe\r\n     fitters, advancing them over Negroes who had more training\r\n     for the work.\r\n\r\n     The foreman in the sheep-killing department of one of the plants\r\n     was said by one worker to make advancement difficult, if not\r\n     impossible, for Negroes. Another worker complained that this\r\n     foreman had recently taken one man off the jaw-trimming machine\r\n     but ran the chain just as fast, with the evident intention of\r\n     overtaxing the remaining Negroes and reporting that they were\r\n     not equal to the job.\r\n\r\n     The foreman in the hog-killing department was charged with\r\n     showing preference to the Poles in shoulder sawing. If a Negro\r\n     made complaint to the superintendent and was sent back with\r\n     instructions to the foreman, the latter would try to \"burn\"\r\n     the Negro out with work.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the discussion of the representatives of the packing\r\ncompanies before the Commission that the Negro in reality has little\r\nopportunity for promotion in the Yards. There are no Negro foremen over\r\nmixed gangs. The highest position a Negro is able to reach is that of\r\nsubforeman over a group of Negro workmen. The general superintendent of\r\none of the packing companies admitted that he had never tried out a Negro\r\nas foreman over a mixed gang because he wouldn't want to work under a\r\nNegro himself. Such an attitude on the part of a general superintendent\r\ncloses the door to experimentation and limits the opportunities of\r\neven the most capable Negroes. It was this same official who said, as\r\npreviously noted, that Negro labor required more supervision than white\r\nlabor, and that the turnover of Negro labor was greater. Lack of \"hope\r\non the job\" would seem an adequate explanation of both conditions.\r\n\r\n_Railroad dining-car and Pullman service._--Negroes are used as\r\ndining-car waiters on all roads running out of Chicago which carry such\r\naccommodations. Certain of the roads also use Negro cooks and kitchen\r\nhelp. The dining-cars on all roads are in charge of white stewards. The\r\nsource of greatest complaint among the 204 Negro waiters interviewed\r\nwas the arbitrary use of authority by the stewards and the fact that\r\ncolor bars Negro waiters from becoming stewards. They say that when\r\nstewards are needed, intelligent and experienced Negroes are passed over\r\nand white men, often entirely ignorant of the work, are taught their\r\nduties by these Negroes and are then placed in authority over them. One\r\nroad carrying seven dining-cars uses white stewards on two cars and the\r\nremaining five cars are in charge of Negroes called \"waiters in charge.\"\r\nNegroes complained that these men get little more than the wages of a\r\nwaiter, and in many cases do all that is required of steward and waiter.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding complaint concerned the drawing of the color line in\r\npromotion. In view of the fact that many college graduates are serving\r\nas waiters, it would seem absurd to say that Negro waiters are incapable\r\nof performing a steward's duties, which consist of receiving and checking\r\nsupplies for the car, seating dining patrons and issuing checks to them,\r\nhaving general supervision of the other employees on the dining-car, and\r\nmaking daily reports to the car superintendent of business transacted.\r\nRace prejudice on the part of administrative officials of railroads seems\r\nto be the only explanation for barring Negroes from becoming stewards,\r\nin view of the fact that Negro waiters have been used in dining-cars for\r\nover forty years and have been accepted by the white traveling public\r\nas a matter of course, though some contend that some patrons who accept\r\nNegroes as waiters would object to seeing them in positions of stewards,\r\nparticularly if that brought white employees under them.\r\n\r\nNegroes are employed in large numbers in Pullman cars as porters,\r\ncleaners, cooks, and mechanics. The main complaint made by the sixty\r\nporters interviewed was poor wages and necessity of dependency on tips to\r\nmake a decent living. The wages of porters, as stated by a representative\r\nof the Pullman Company before the Commission, are:\r\n\r\n     The minimum rate for a porter on a standard sleeping or parlor\r\n     car is $60.00 per month; when running in charge of one car the\r\n     rate is $70.00 per month; when running in charge of a private\r\n     car the rate is $75.00 per month; but when operating in charge\r\n     of two or more cars the rate is $155.00 per month.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the minimum was either $27.50 or $30.00 per month. Asked whether\r\nthe Government Railroad Administration had anything to do with the\r\nincrease granted by the Pullman Company, he indicated that the Pullman\r\nCompany was under the direction of the Railroad Administration.\r\n\r\nAnother complaint by Pullman porters was that no promotion was possible\r\nfor them, since only white men are used as Pullman-car conductors.\r\nThe explanation of the company, given by one of its representatives at\r\na conference with the Commission, was: \"It is merely carrying out an\r\nancient and honorable custom--we started out with white conductors and\r\ncolored porters and have always continued that way.\"\r\n\r\nInterviews with Negro workers revealed individual differences in attitude\r\nand temperament, but the more ambitious and thoughtful Negroes expressed\r\nthe conviction that they were barred by color from positions for which\r\nthey were better qualified than the white men who held them. Their\r\ncomplaints were largely variations of the same theme--race discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. INDUSTRIES EXCLUDING THE NEGRO\r\n\r\nSeveral important industries in Chicago have not yet employed Negroes.\r\nThe traction companies (both elevated and surface) do not employ them as\r\nconductors, motormen, guards, or ticket agents. The large State Street\r\ndepartment stores have no Negro clerks, and taxicab companies do not\r\nemploy colored drivers. In these industries, which depend directly upon\r\nthe public for patronage, it is to be expected that the employing of\r\nNegro help will be determined by the employer's views of the wishes of his\r\npatrons. If there is any fear that they are unfavorable, any individual\r\nemployer in a competitive industry will hesitate to try the experiment\r\nalone. The employment managers of five State Street department stores\r\nmade the following statements:\r\n\r\n     1. Our customers would object to colored salespeople, I am sure.\r\n\r\n     2. We have never employed any Negroes in our Chicago\r\n     establishments. I don't care to go into the matter. It will\r\n     not do you any good and will not do us any good.\r\n\r\n     3. Customers and white employees would object if they were\r\n     used as clerks.\r\n\r\n     4. No Negroes are ever employed because we have sufficient\r\n     white applicants.\r\n\r\n     5. If we ever tried using Negroes as clerks the white workers\r\n     would make trouble, I am sure of that. Our customers would\r\n     object. A good many are from the South and would make trouble\r\n     even if Chicago people did not.\r\n\r\nOne large taxicab company, employing 250 Negroes for repair work\r\nand upkeep of automobiles, does not employ Negroes as drivers. A\r\nrepresentative of this company stated that the company had gone as far\r\nas many employers, and often farther, in the employment of Negro labor;\r\nthat it had done this in a progressive way, one step after another, but\r\nhad \"not yet got as far as employing Negro chauffeurs,\" although this\r\nmight come in time. When asked whether he thought such action would\r\naffect the company's business unfavorably he said, \"I do not know. It\r\nis a matter that I have never thought about.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Telephone Company does not employ Negro telephone operators.\r\nIts only Negro employees are porters, window washers, and maids. A\r\nrepresentative stated that it has always had sufficient white applicants\r\nfor positions as telephone operators and has not considered taking on\r\nNegro girls, although the suggestion has often been made that Negro\r\noperators be used at the Douglas Exchange (located in the Negro area of\r\nthe South Side). This official thought there was very little possibility\r\nthat they would employ Negro operators in the future. He feared objection\r\nfrom white employees.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing it may be borne in mind that the company\r\nhas answered complaints of poor telephone service within the past few\r\nyears with the statement that it is difficult to secure capable girls,\r\nand that the Telephone Company is continually advertising for girls as\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n_Social waste involved._--The industrial secretary of the Urban League\r\nhas called attention to the large number of educated Negro girls who are\r\nunable to secure industrial openings where education is required. It is\r\nimpossible to estimate how great a social waste is involved in relegating\r\ntrained and educated Negroes to inferior positions, and there is evidence\r\nthat such waste is considerable. Negroes with college training are found\r\nworking as waiters; young women college graduates are frequently forced\r\nto serve as ladies' maids, theater ushers, or in some other capacity\r\nwhere they are unable to use their educational training. The fact that\r\nit was not difficult to find over 1,500 Negro women of more than average\r\neducation for clerical positions in two Chicago mail-order houses when\r\nthe opportunity offered is some indication of the extent of the social\r\nwaste when Negroes are not used in other positions which require training.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. RELATIONS OF WHITE AND COLORED WORKERS\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Negroes into new industries and occupations means that\r\nthe workers already in these fields will meet increased competition. The\r\nself-interest of white workers in a given shop may therefore cause them to\r\nresent the presence of Negro workers. On the other hand, through contact\r\nand association with Negroes during working hours, white workers may come\r\nto look upon Negroes, not as members of a strange group with colored skin,\r\nbut as individuals with the same feelings, hopes, and disappointments\r\nas other people. Whether the hostile attitude prompted by self-interest\r\nor the friendly attitude born of understanding, acquaintance, and daily\r\nassociation will prevail in any given shop depends on many factors, over\r\nsome of which the workers involved have no control. Some of these are:\r\n\r\n1. The attitude of the management when Negro labor is first introduced.\r\n\r\n2. Circumstances under which Negroes are hired, whether because of\r\nrecognized labor shortage, or as strike breakers, or to reduce labor\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n3. The attitude and characteristics of the particular Negroes employed.\r\n\r\n4. The attitude of the white workers toward Negroes as a result of\r\nprevious contacts with Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe spirit displayed in the shop is likely to spread beyond it and affect\r\nrelations between the races on the streets and in cars and other public\r\nplaces. It is therefore important to know what the relations between\r\nwhite and Negro workers are, both because of their importance to the\r\nNegro in industry and their bearing on the broader social aspect of race\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. RACE FRICTION AMONG WORKERS\r\n\r\nInformation concerning race relations in industry was received from\r\nemployers through questionnaires returned by 137 establishments employing\r\na total of 22,337 Negroes, through interviews at places of business\r\nwith representatives of 101 employers, through industrial conferences\r\nheld by the Commission, and through interviews with 865 Negro workers.\r\nSince the best judges of the existence of race friction would be the\r\nNegro workers themselves, who would bear the brunt of any ill-treatment\r\nresulting from such friction, it was considered that any extended canvass\r\nof opinion among white workers beyond the inquiries made in connection\r\nwith the trade-union investigation was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nRace friction between white and Negro workers sufficient to interfere\r\nwith output would militate against the use of Negro labor. The fact that\r\nNegro labor has proved satisfactory in the great majority of cases where\r\nit has been used is therefore indirect evidence that race friction is\r\nnot pronounced in Chicago industries. Direct evidence from employers\r\non this subject was also secured in answer to a specific question on\r\nthe point. Out of 137 establishments employing Negroes, which returned\r\nquestionnaires, only two reported that race friction was a disturbing\r\nfactor in their plants. The facts in these two cases were as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a steel-manufacturing plant there was a total of 1,300 employees, of\r\nwhom seventeen were Negroes, eleven men and six women. During the steel\r\nstrike of 1919 Negroes were employed in this plant in large numbers.\r\nFeeling was antagonistic on the part of the whites, \"particularly\r\nAustrians and Slavonians.\" The total number of Negroes employed during\r\nthe strike and the turnover were reported as \"an average force of 175.\"\r\n\r\nFriction in the foregoing case was probably due to the heritage of\r\nbitterness over the use of Negroes as strike breakers and to irritation\r\ncaused by the low grade of workers employed more than to difference\r\nin color. They were described by the manager as \"irresponsible and\r\nshiftless.\"\r\n\r\nIn the other case fear of Negroes' competition rather than race prejudice\r\nwas apparently the cause of friction. The manager of a wholesale millinery\r\nhouse employing forty-three girls in one department, out of a total of\r\n700 employees, said:\r\n\r\n     We decided to take on colored help in June, 1919. Our white\r\n     people resented very much the fact of employing colored people\r\n     in our business, and I believe the blame, if there is any, lies\r\n     as much with the whites as with the blacks in the difficulties\r\n     we have had. I find a great resentment among all our white\r\n     people. I couldn't overcome the prejudice enough to bring the\r\n     people in the same building, and had to engage outside quarters\r\n     for the blacks. We had a meeting of our colored operators\r\n     after employing the hand workers. We thought it would be nice\r\n     if we would start a school for machine operators. It was, of\r\n     course, rumored that we were going to do this, and I received\r\n     a delegation from our sewing hall who said they resented the\r\n     idea. They wouldn't listen to it at all, and I had to abandon\r\n     the project. Their argument was: \"If you let them in it won't\r\n     be long until we are out entirely.\" The attitude against the\r\n     colored is only the same as it was against the Slavs or the\r\n     foreign races when they first intruded in the field. There\r\n     was no prejudice, particularly against the color. In millinery\r\n     establishments in New York City colored girls and white girls\r\n     work together and do not seem to have any trouble, but, we\r\n     can't do it here.\r\n\r\nThe resentment felt by the white girls in this shop may be accounted for\r\nin part by a fact to which the manager apparently attached no importance.\r\nIn speaking of the loyalty and good spirit of the Negro girls, he said\r\ncasually:\r\n\r\n     In a few instances, where we have had difficulty in getting\r\n     work done by the whites, we have been able to use the colored\r\n     workroom as a level. We have sent it over to them and gotten it\r\n     out. The white girls have refused either through stubbornness\r\n     or some condition to get the work out.\r\n\r\nFriction was also reported between women employees in a plant where\r\nrelations between the men of both races were reported harmonious. This\r\nplant which manufactures machinery, has a total of 6,647 employees,\r\nincluding 1,225 Negro men and sixty Negro women. A representative of\r\nthe company said:\r\n\r\n     Among the girls we had quite a lot of trouble in some\r\n     departments against our hiring colored girls. To every colored\r\n     girl employed we lost five white girls. There was friction in\r\n     the washrooms due probably to race, though it may have been\r\n     personal.\r\n\r\nThe report from a foundry employing 950 men, of whom 200 were colored,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     As a rule if any objection is made to working together it comes\r\n     from the white men (Polish) on the grounds that the colored\r\n     man is being given the preference.\r\n\r\nA laundry company employing ten Negroes out of a total of thirty-five\r\nemployees, reported that when the first Negro girl was employed the\r\nwhite girls threatened to quit. The manager asked them to wait a week\r\nand, if they still objected, he would let her go. There was no further\r\nobjection; they grew to like her.\r\n\r\nThe reports of employers regarding the absence of friction between\r\nwhite and Negro workers is borne out by the testimony of Negro workers\r\nthemselves. Among 865 Negroes interviewed in all the industries covered,\r\nthe number who complained of disagreeable treatment by white workers was\r\npractically negligible. It is possible that some Negro workers among those\r\ninterviewed at their work places, sometimes with white fellow-workers\r\nand foreman near by, felt hesitancy in voicing such complaints. But\r\nthe fact that the information was sought by an investigator of their\r\nown race, and confidentially for the Commission, may be considered as a\r\nfactor likely to encourage the expression of any grievance, especially\r\nif felt at all deeply.\r\n\r\nConditions of work in large foundries would seem to offer plenty of\r\nopportunity for friction even where workers are all of the same race.\r\nThis is particularly true of foundries where the piecework system\r\nprevails. The work is done in the confusion of smoke, heat, dust, and\r\nnoise, with men shouting at each other, each striving to be first to\r\nreceive this pouring of molten iron from the vats. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the work is carried on under great tension, the ninety-three\r\nNegroes interviewed in fourteen foundries, when asked how they got along\r\nwith the white men with whom they worked, said: \"Good,\" \"Fine,\" or used\r\nother words to indicate friendly relations. Not a single complaint was\r\nmade against treatment by white workers in any of the foundries or iron\r\nand steel establishments investigated.\r\n\r\nOne interesting instance of happy working relations in which several\r\nnationalities of whites were involved was found at Hull-House. A Negro\r\nhas been in charge of the Coffee House there for six years. He had nine\r\nemployees working under him: three Negro girls, one German boy, one\r\nGreek man, two Polish girls, and two Italian women. The Greek man and\r\nthe two Polish girls were in the employ of the Coffee House when he took\r\ncharge. The others have all been employed for a considerable period. In\r\ncommenting upon the amicable relations of people representing so many\r\ndifferent races and under a Negro manager, he said, \"We are all working\r\nfor a living, and there will be no discrimination. It is very simple.\r\nThe thing to do is to get acquainted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2. WORKERS REFLECT ATTITUDE OF MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the employment of Negroes is decided upon, there is an effort to\r\nmake the change with as little disturbance as possible to white workers.\r\nFrequently the manager tries to imagine himself in the place of his\r\nwhite workers in order to discover what their reaction will be. In so\r\ndoing, he considers, not what they will think or feel, but what a man\r\nwith his own social background would feel in their position. The attitude\r\nof the management therefore determines whether Negro workers shall be\r\nsegregated or treated like other workers in the plant without regard to\r\ncolor. Separation once decided upon and partitions erected, white workers\r\nmay insist upon the distinction being maintained where they would not\r\nhave raised the point in the first instance. Establishments following\r\nboth courses gave the Commission the result of their experiences. Of 101\r\nestablishments employing five or more Negroes each, eighteen maintained\r\nseparate lavatory and toilet accommodations for Negro workers. This\r\ncondition was accepted without complaint in some establishments, while\r\nin others it was a source of dissatisfaction among the Negro workers,\r\nwho resented this manifestation of \"Jim Crowism\" in the North. The fact\r\nis worthy of note that the eighteen establishments reporting separate\r\naccommodations or separate departments for colored workers employed but\r\n2,623 Negroes out of a total of 22,337 covered by the investigation, or\r\nslightly more than 11 per cent. The remaining 89 per cent, or 19,714,\r\nwere using all accommodations in common with white workers.\r\n\r\nOne large foundry company employing 427 Negroes out of a total of 2,488\r\nemployees tried a different method in each of its three plants. In one\r\na partition in the locker and shower rooms was erected, to which the\r\nNegro workers objected. The general superintendent said he would not\r\nhave consented to the erection of the partition in the first place, but\r\nhe was afraid to take it down. In the second plant separate lavatory\r\naccommodations were provided in connection with separate departments for\r\nNegro and white workers on different floors, and there was no trouble.\r\nIn the third plant, where no color distinctions were made, all workers\r\nusing the same lavatory accommodations, the manager never heard of any\r\ncomplaint from white or Negro workers.\r\n\r\nIn another foundry employing 125 Negroes out of a total of 466 employees\r\nthe representative said that the Polish workers had objected \"that the\r\ncolored people used the showers and basins all the time and they did not\r\nget a chance to. We checked up on this and limited some of our showers to\r\ncolored only, and we only had two men use the white showers in something\r\nlike two weeks, time, and in the colored there was something like 200\r\nbaths taken.\" The use of the same accommodations in this plant caused\r\nno further complaint after this incident. Another foundry reported that\r\nthe white and Negro workmen ate lunch and smoked together. There were no\r\nseparate accommodations and there was no ill-feeling whatever. Another\r\nfirm employing 500 Negroes out of a total of 3,000 employees reported:\r\n\"The relationship between our Negro and white employees is very friendly.\r\nDuring the past year we have not had a single encounter of any kind\r\nbetween the white and colored workers. They work together in most of our\r\ndepartments, use the same locker rooms and washrooms, and eat in the same\r\nrestaurant in the plant.\" In one foundry the superintendent was nearly\r\ncompelled to install separate accommodations because of stealing in the\r\nlocker rooms. Suspicion was aroused against the Negro workers, and the\r\nwhite workers had a shop meeting to demand separate accommodations. The\r\nmanager said: \"The same day the janitor caught a red-headed Irish boy\r\nred-handed. We paraded him through the shop and made quite a grandstand\r\noperation out of it, and it ended my troubles from that time on, but if\r\nI hadn't caught him I might have had to maintain separate locker rooms.\"\r\n\r\nThere were only six establishments which maintained separate departments\r\nfor Negro workers. In some cases segregation was effected by a partition;\r\nin others by maintaining a complete Negro unit in a different part of\r\nthe city. The second plan has worked satisfactorily, but segregation by\r\npartition in the same plant is resented by Negro workers. Representatives\r\nof the largest employers of Negro labor expressed the opinion that\r\nerecting a partition, by drawing the \"color line,\" causes friction which\r\nin all probability would not otherwise appear.\r\n\r\nThe industrial secretary of the Urban League, who has been actively\r\ninterested in extending the range of opportunity for the Negro in\r\nindustry, firmly believes that the attitude of the management on racial\r\nmatters is reflected by the employees, that wherever an uncompromising\r\nstand is made for fair play for all employees, racial differences do\r\nnot cause annoyance. He cites the following incident as one of several\r\ntending to support his view:\r\n\r\n     During the fall of 1919 the general manager of the S----\r\n     F---- P---- Company was approached on the subject of employing\r\n     colored girls. To our surprise, it was discovered that colored\r\n     girls were already employed by him in all branches of the\r\n     industry, and mixed freely with white employees. There was no\r\n     discrimination in the character or kind of work or the use of\r\n     plant facilities. Mr. N---- explained that he had never thought\r\n     of segregating white and colored workmen, and the wisdom of\r\n     his plan had been proved by the experience of his father, who\r\n     employs both white and colored girls, but keeps the groups\r\n     separated by a partition. According to Mr. N---- the partition\r\n     had been a source of trouble for the reason that the placing\r\n     of the partition itself indicated that the company intended\r\n     to make a difference between white and colored workers. This\r\n     put each group in a frame of mind which caused them to resent\r\n     the presence of any worker on the side of the partition on\r\n     which she was not employed. The elder Mr. N---- realized his\r\n     mistake but did not dare to take the partition down, fearing\r\n     that by so doing he would precipitate further trouble which\r\n     would result in the most desirable girls in each group quitting\r\n     the plant.\r\n\r\nForemen, because they personify the management in the mind of the workmen,\r\nplay a large part in shaping the attitude white workers adopt toward\r\nNegroes. If the foremen are antagonistic or insulting in their treatment\r\nof the Negro, white workers find favor with the foremen by adopting the\r\nsame attitude. A construction company employing sixty Negroes reported:\r\n\r\n     There were always difficulties with this gang when the Italian\r\n     foreman was here, as he constantly endeavored to place Italians\r\n     at work displacing some very good Negro workers. When I was\r\n     sent here I dug under the difficulties and found the Italians\r\n     were very clannish and were using the foreman to carry out\r\n     the plan of giving every Italian who came along a job, at the\r\n     expense of some Negro's job. I am a French Canadian and have\r\n     worked with colored men before. After failure in trying to get\r\n     Italians to see how bad the old system was, I was forced to\r\n     let all the Italians go. I have an excellent gang of Negroes\r\n     now.\r\n\r\nThe representative of a large foundry said:\r\n\r\n     I believe I have a harder time to get the Polish foremen to\r\n     handle Negro help than any other. Our foremen are accustomed\r\n     to handling the Polish workers pretty rough. While employers\r\n     don't want that, it goes on that way. A Pole is \"cussed\" around\r\n     and does not care what he is called. It's all the same to\r\n     him, but a colored man is a pretty thin-skinned individual.\r\n     You call a colored man something, and he will grab his hat\r\n     and is gone. He thinks that when the foreman uses those words\r\n     he means it. He will not stand for the same kind of language\r\n     that the Polak will.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. USE OF NEGRO LABOR TO UNDERMINE WAGES\r\n\r\nIf Negroes are introduced into a plant during a strike and retained\r\nafterward, a period of strained relations between white and Negro workers\r\nis almost certain to ensue. They are given a similarly unfavorable\r\nstart when they are introduced to reduce labor costs. In the smaller\r\nestablishments, where wages and conditions of work were not well\r\nstandardized, white workers were suspicious that Negroes were working\r\nfor lower wages, and the Negroes suspected that they were being paid\r\nlower wages than white workers. It is obvious that where mutual distrust\r\nand suspicion are present, friction readily develops which may lead to\r\nserious social consequences.\r\n\r\nTo what extent Negroes are being paid lower wages than white workers it\r\nis impossible to say. In this connection the Chicago Urban League made\r\nthe following statement:\r\n\r\n     The charge of inequality in the wages of white and colored\r\n     workers is frequently made, but the League is not always\r\n     permitted to inquire into wage scales, and therefore\r\n     verification of some of these rumors has been impossible.\r\n\r\n     The League has taken up this matter with such companies as\r\n     ----, ----, ----, and numerous others, with the result that\r\n     in each instance the statement has been made that white and\r\n     colored workers receive the same pay for the same work. There\r\n     is a deep-seated suspicion, however, that this is not true. In\r\n     some cases this suspicion seemed to be justified. Complaints\r\n     have come to our attention where colored people have been\r\n     mistaken for white in the offices of the ---- Company and\r\n     employed at a higher rate of pay than that given colored girls\r\n     for similar work. This, however, has never been verified. Pay\r\n     inequalities have been explained away by larger experience,\r\n     seniority, superior production, etc., in favor of whites.\r\n\r\n     The employment manager of one company has told representatives\r\n     of the Chicago Urban League that the colored girls employed\r\n     in their South Side Branch Office started at a wage in excess\r\n     of that given white girls for similar work in their main office.\r\n\r\n     The statement can be correctly made, however, that many\r\n     employers of colored girls, particularly in the needle trades,\r\n     have refused to pay colored workers a wage equal to that of\r\n     white. There are well-known instances of sweatshop tactics\r\n     used on colored girls because of their inexperience in industry\r\n     and lack of organization.\r\n\r\n     An official of the Women's Garment Workers' Union reported\r\n     that ---- Company, upon finding that they had to pay the union\r\n     scale of wages, requested the local to supply white girls\r\n     instead of the colored girls who were already in his employ.\r\n     The colored girls were employed to replace the striking whites.\r\n\r\n     No complaint has come to our attention of inequality of wages\r\n     in union shops employing white and colored workers, or in any\r\n     of the larger industries. Colored workers are usually exploited\r\n     in the smaller shops. White workers have been known to refuse\r\n     to work in shops paying white and colored workers the same wage.\r\n\r\nAll of the representatives of employers appearing in conferences and all\r\nbut one of the representatives interviewed stated that Negro and white\r\nworkers were being paid equal wages in their establishments. The exception\r\nwas a wholesale hardware company where the employment manager admitted\r\npaying Negroes \"a dollar or two less per week\" because they could not\r\nbe shifted from one department to another as readily as white workers\r\non account of prejudice of workers or foremen in certain departments.\r\n\r\nIt was learned that employers occasionally refuse to hire Negro unionists\r\nwhen they learn they must pay them \"white men's wages.\" Unionists allege\r\nthat even Negro employers object to paying Negroes the same union scale as\r\nwhite workers. To the extent that Negro labor is being used to undermine\r\nwage standards, misunderstanding and race friction develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. RELATIONS OF WHITE AND NEGRO WORKERS DURING THE RIOT\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the violence that characterized street encounters during\r\nthe riots it is significant that no unfriendly demonstrations occurred\r\nbetween workers in any of the establishments covered by the investigation,\r\naccording to statements made by representatives of employers. On the\r\ncontrary, white workers are said by employers to have expressed sympathy\r\nin many ways with their Negro fellow-workers. The general superintendent\r\nof one of the largest packing companies in the \"Yards\" emphasized the\r\ngood feeling that existed between the workers at this critical time:\r\n\r\n     I think this Commission ought to know that there wasn't a\r\n     single case of violence in what we call Packingtown during\r\n     the race riot, and the morning that the Negroes were brought\r\n     back to work in this packing-house there was not a single\r\n     argument--there wasn't a single indication in this plant of\r\n     any racial feeling. In fact the two classes of common labor\r\n     we have are the Slavs and the Negroes, and they met as old\r\n     friends. In many instances they put their arms around one\r\n     another's necks. In one particular instance a Negro and a\r\n     Pole got on an elevated truck and rode all around this plant\r\n     simply to signify to the rest of the workers that there was a\r\n     good spirit existing between the two. There was nothing in the\r\n     contact between the Negro and the Pole or the Slav that would\r\n     indicate that there had ever been a race riot in Chicago, and\r\n     there was nothing from the beginning of the race riot to the\r\n     end that would indicate that there was any feeling started in\r\n     the Stock Yards or in this industry that led up to the race\r\n     riot.\r\n\r\nThat there was at least one case of mob violence is shown by the report\r\nof the coroner's jury which investigated the riots. William H. Dozier,\r\na colored man, was killed in the Stock Yards, according to this report.\r\nThe jury's finding in this case was:\r\n\r\n     We find that during the race riots at a point about Cook Street\r\n     and Exchange Avenue in the Union Stock Yards, and at about 7:15\r\n     A.M., July 31, 1919, deceased, a colored man, was struck by a\r\n     hammer held and wielded by one Joseph Carka, that the deceased\r\n     ran east on Exchange Avenue toward the sheep pens at Morgan\r\n     Street, that he was followed and chased by a mob of white men,\r\n     and that while so running the deceased was struck by a street\r\n     broom, held and wielded by one Joe Scovak, and that he was\r\n     also struck by a shovel in the hands of an unknown white man,\r\n     and by one or more stones or missiles thrown by one or more\r\n     unknown white men; injuries sustained causing death.\r\n\r\nThis was the only serious case of violence in the Stock Yards discovered,\r\nalthough a number of rumors were investigated, which could not be\r\nsubstantiated by facts.\r\n\r\nBecause of the nature of the work in the \"Yards\" and the presence of\r\nknives and other dangerous implements which could be turned to ready use,\r\nit is significant that more rioting, with deaths and injuries resulting,\r\ndid not take place. But it is also true that the riot, which started on\r\nSunday afternoon, became so serious by Monday morning that few Negroes\r\nmade an effort to reach their work at the Stock Yards.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. FUTURE OF THE NEGRO IN CHICAGO INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the Negro in industry points to the conclusion that\r\nNegro labor has made a satisfactory record, and that there is little\r\nrace friction in evidence between white and Negro workers. What the\r\nfuture will hold for him depends upon many complicating factors, some\r\nof which are: renewal of immigration in large volume, depressed business\r\nconditions, attempted reductions in labor costs, increasing unemployment,\r\nfalling wages, the announced determination of many employers' associations\r\nthroughout the country to undermine the strength of unions by establishing\r\nthe \"open shop\" which might involve the use of Negro labor, and the\r\nadmitted prejudice of foremen against Negro labor in many plants. It was\r\nlabor shortage which forced employers to experiment with Negro workers\r\nin new fields. Whether Negro employees will be retained when a surplus\r\nof white labor is available is an open question.\r\n\r\nEmployers' representatives, in April and May, 1920, stated (with one\r\nexception) that no reduction in labor force was contemplated; that when\r\nsuch reduction became necessary, efficiency and seniority rights would\r\ndetermine which workers would be retained; that the question of color\r\nwould not enter into the decision in any way. The employment manager of\r\na firm employing a very large number of Negroes expressed the general\r\nopinion of the employers' representatives when he said:\r\n\r\n     I feel that our house will continue to run a colored office\r\n     as long as they can run it as efficiently and economically as\r\n     they could a white office; while, on the other hand, if they\r\n     could not run it as efficiently and economically of course\r\n     they wouldn't run it, because it's just a matter of dollars\r\n     and cents, and as far as charity and good will goes, all good\r\n     business men have it, but they are not going to run their\r\n     business according to that entirely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the employment manager of an establishment which had\r\nexperienced friction between white and Negro workers was of the opinion\r\nthat white workers resented the intrusion of Negroes. He thought that this\r\nfeeling would be a factor if a time came when there was an oversupply\r\nof labor; that Negroes would then have to give way because no employer\r\nwould be strong enough to resist the resentment of white workers; and\r\nNegro workers would thus be thrown out of work and would be a standing\r\nmenace to the community.\r\n\r\nThe investigations and inquiries of the Commission in industry took\r\nplace almost entirely in the period from March to September, 1920, and\r\nthe statistics concerning Negroes employed were gathered in the earlier\r\npart of this period. During these months the general industrial situation\r\nwas such as to demand all the labor, both white and Negro, that could be\r\nsecured. In the autumn of 1920, however, a period of decline began, with\r\nincreasing unemployment. This affected both white and Negro workers. Its\r\nown investigational staff no longer available for additional service,\r\nthe Commission sought information concerning these changed conditions,\r\nso far as they affected Negro workers, from the industrial secretary of\r\nthe Chicago Urban League. Through its industrial department the League\r\nplaces more Negroes in employment than any other agency in Chicago. The\r\nindustrial secretary made the following statement on November 20:\r\n\r\n     At the present time the unemployment among colored people\r\n     has reached what seems serious proportions. While there is\r\n     no indication that colored people are suffering more in this\r\n     respect than any other group, the constantly swelling number\r\n     is a cause for grave concern. For three weeks our employment\r\n     office has been crowded with job seekers. At first it appeared\r\n     that those who failed to take their work seriously suddenly\r\n     found themselves unable to get employment, but now hundreds\r\n     of men with good records have been forced out by temporary\r\n     \"shut downs\" and reduced forces of various plants.\r\n\r\n     During the working days included between November 15 and\r\n     20, our attendance record is 1,073 job seekers with only 131\r\n     openings. One month ago the attendance figure was 571 persons\r\n     for the equal period (259 men and 312 women).\r\n\r\n     Our labor reports for May, 1920, indicated an attendance of\r\n     941 males and 739 females; about 1,000 orders for male help\r\n     and about 500 for female help; there were 722 placements for\r\n     males and 371 for females. The total attendance was 1,680;\r\n     orders, 1,500; placements, 1,093.\r\n\r\n     A casual survey including most of the leading industries ...\r\n     shows a general decline and a letting off of workers. Some\r\n     few report difficulty in keeping their present forces.\r\n\r\n     There have been some complaints of discrimination against\r\n     colored workers, but few comparatively.... Most industries\r\n     are keeping their proportionate share of Negroes. In some\r\n     instances the proportion has been slightly increased....\r\n\r\n     During the week, workers have registered from cities in states\r\n     from Mississippi to Michigan. Detroit predominates, where the\r\n     automobile industries show a marked depression.\r\n\r\n     Women's work presents a very discouraging outlook. Hundreds\r\n     of needle workers are out of employment by the closing of\r\n     many of the smaller shops which employed colored girls. The\r\n     Women's Trade Union League reports many workers unemployed,\r\n     due to the slowness of the trade. Immigrant white girls are\r\n     said to be consuming much of the work offered to domestics....\r\n     Colored women seem in most cases as reluctant as ever to accept\r\n     domestic employment.\r\n\r\n     The present unemployment problem is probably as serious as\r\n     any the League has known. What shall become of the army of\r\n     jobless men is a problem serious and perplexing.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the necessity of reducing costs in response to depressed\r\nbusiness conditions, managers of establishments employing both white and\r\nNegro workers may be tempted to pit Negro and white workers against each\r\nother, paying Negro labor less than white labor as a means of forcing\r\ndown wages or undermining labor-union organizations. Such attempts would\r\ncertainly be conducive to increased racial animosity. On the other hand,\r\nmanagers who are hostile to Negro labor may take advantage of the change\r\nin the labor situation by discharging Negroes indiscriminately, replacing\r\nthem with white workers.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of business depression which had already begun, both\r\nwhite and Negro workers seemed certain to lose some of the advantages\r\nwhich they had gained as a result of the labor shortage caused by the\r\nwar. After the industrial depression has passed, discrimination against\r\nthe Negro, to whatever extent it may exist, will make the recovery of\r\nlost ground more difficult for Negro workers than for white workers.\r\nIn considering the question of race discrimination, it is evident that\r\nthe Negro who has lived in the North for a number of years feels keenly\r\nthe fact that color bars even the most capable members of his race from\r\nthe hope of promotion to executive or administrative positions, while\r\nprejudice on the part of persons in authority prevents the rank and file\r\nof Negroes from developing the degree of efficiency which they could\r\ndevelop if they knew their efforts would be judged on merit alone. Where\r\nadvancement is precluded by color, the incentive supplied by recognition\r\nof effort is lacking.\r\n\r\nOne door of escape from the discouraging prospects held out in industries\r\nmanaged by white men, where there is no chance for promotion to executive\r\npositions, is the opportunity for an increasing number of the more\r\nambitious Negroes to enter business among members of their own race.\r\nAccording to Black's _Blue Book_ (1919-20) there were over 1,200 Negro\r\nbusiness houses and professional offices in Chicago in 1920. Among\r\nothers, the list included five banks, forty dentists, fifteen druggists,\r\ntwenty-four employment agencies, six hotels, three insurance offices,\r\nforty-eight real estate offices, eleven newspapers and magazines, 106\r\nphysicians, seventy lawyers, 161 barber shops and billiard rooms, and 120\r\nhairdressing parlors. Although the list of Negro business men in Chicago\r\nis growing rapidly, it must necessarily remain but a small percentage\r\nof the total Negro population. The great majority of Negroes gainfully\r\noccupied will continue to be employees in industry. Therefore the fact\r\nthat a large number of Negroes feel that discrimination is practiced and\r\nthat, no matter what abilities they show, they can \"go so far and no\r\nfarther\" in industries managed by white men is of great importance in\r\nany consideration of race problems. These men are the more thoughtful,\r\naspiring members of their race, and their opinion accordingly carries\r\nmore weight than the opinion of an equal number of care-free Negroes who\r\nmay consider that the high wages of the present are an offset for all\r\nhandicaps. Negroes who feel keenly the injustice of unequal opportunities\r\nare the ones to seek expression in Negro newspapers and magazines with\r\nthe aim of arousing widespread resentment against race discrimination.\r\nMen who frequently would not resent discrimination directed against\r\nthemselves are stirred to resentment by well-told recitals of injustice\r\nto others. Specific instances may seem to be of trifling importance, but\r\nin being retold they reach an ever-widening audience, which is constantly\r\ngrowing more race conscious.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ORGANIZED LABOR AND THE NEGRO WORKER\r\n\r\n\r\nI. INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nIndustry involves the continuous contact of more whites and Negroes than\r\nany other field. It therefore affords wide opportunity for the operation\r\nof racial misunderstanding and friction. It is also a field in which the\r\nlines of economic interest are so tightly drawn and so closely watched\r\nthat any misunderstanding or friction is thereby greatly accentuated.\r\n\r\nIrritation and clashes of interest have been conspicuous in the relations\r\nbetween labor unions and Negro workers. This friction has extended to\r\nthe relations between whites and Negroes generally. The efforts of union\r\nlabor to promote its cause and gain adherents have built up a body of\r\nsentiment that cannot easily be opposed by non-union workers. The strike\r\nbreaker is intolerable to the union man. Circumstances have frequently\r\nmade Negroes strike breakers, thus centering upon them as a racial group\r\nall the bitterness which the unionist feels toward strike breakers as a\r\nclass. This tends to increase any existing racial antipathy or to serve\r\nas concrete justification for it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Negroes have often expressed themselves as distrustful\r\nof the unions because prejudice in the unions has denied them equal\r\nbenefits of membership. They often find that their first opportunity in\r\na new industry comes through the eagerness of a strike-bound employer\r\nto utilize their labor at wages more than they have previously earned,\r\neven if less than the union scale. This often tends to make them feel\r\nthat they have more to gain through affiliation with such employers than\r\nby taking chances on what the unions offer them.\r\n\r\nThere is a gradually increasing sympathetic understanding by unionists of\r\nthe struggle of Negroes to overcome their handicaps, and an increasing\r\nrealization of the importance to the unions of organizing them. Negroes\r\nare themselves showing more interest in efforts toward organizations, but\r\nthere is still much mutual suspicion and resentment in their relations.\r\n\r\nTo understand these relations it is necessary to know (1) the policy and\r\nattitude of organized labor toward the Negro and how its expressed policy\r\nis carried out in practice; and (2) what the Negro believes the facts to\r\nbe and what his attitude is toward organized labor. In its investigation\r\nthe Commission used the following methods of inquiry: Questionnaires\r\nwere sent to all labor organizations; interviews were held with union\r\nofficials and members, both white and Negro, with officers and members\r\nof Negro \"protest\" unions, with non-union Negroes, and with persons\r\nwho were not connected with unions but had certain special information.\r\nNinety-one persons, of whom twenty-five were Negroes, were interviewed.\r\nTrade-union meetings were attended by the Commission's investigator. Union\r\nconstitutions, magazines, convention reports, etc., were collected and\r\nstudied. Conferences were held by the Commission at which the following\r\nlabor leaders and organizers presented their information and views:\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Perkins, president of the International Cigarmakers' Union,\r\nand prominent in the affairs of the American Federation of Labor since\r\nits organization.\r\n\r\nVictor Olander, secretary-treasurer, Illinois State Federation of Labor,\r\nand vice-president of International Seaman's Union.\r\n\r\nJohn Fitzpatrick, president, Chicago Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nW. Z. Foster, organizer of the American Federation of Labor in the steel\r\nand packing industries.\r\n\r\nA. K. Foote, Negro, vice-president of Stock Yards Labor Council and\r\nsecretary-treasurer, Local 651, Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher\r\nWorkmen of America.\r\n\r\nI. H. Bratton, Negro organizer for Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher\r\nWorkmen of America.\r\n\r\nJohn Riley, Negro organizer for the American Federation of Labor in the\r\nStock Yards district.\r\n\r\nMax Brodsky, secretary-treasurer, Local 100, International Ladies'\r\nGarment Workers' Union.\r\n\r\nAgnes Nestor, president, Women's Trade Union League.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Maloney, treasurer and organizer, Chicago Waitresses' Union.\r\n\r\nRobert L. Mays, Negro, president of an independent Negro union, the\r\nRailway Men's International Benevolent and Industrial Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. POLICY OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND OTHER FEDERATIONS\r\n\r\nFrom its beginning the American Federation of Labor has declared a uniform\r\npolicy of no racial discrimination, although this policy has not been\r\ncarried out in practice by all the constituent autonomous bodies. At its\r\nfortieth annual convention, held at Montreal, Canada, in June, 1920, a\r\nplan was presented to \"use every means in its power to have the words\r\n'only white' members stricken out of the constitution\" of the Brotherhood\r\nof Railway Clerks, an organization which exercises jurisdiction over\r\n100,000 colored employees, although barring them from membership, and\r\n\"admit the colored workers to full membership in their Brotherhood or\r\nhave them relinquish jurisdiction\" over these Negro employees and allow\r\nthem to establish a brotherhood of their own.\r\n\r\nThis failed to receive favorable action, but a resolution was passed\r\nreaffirming the position taken at the Atlantic City convention in 1919\r\nthat \"where international unions refuse to admit colored workers to\r\nmembership, the American Federation of Labor will be authorized to\r\norganize them under charters from the American Federation of Labor.\" This\r\nmeans that in such cases the American Federation of Labor itself becomes\r\nthe national or international union of such locals. According to the\r\ninformation given to the Commission by George W. Perkins, \"the American\r\nFederation of Labor has organized hundreds of local unions and thereby\r\ndirectly attached to the American Federation of Labor colored workers.\"\r\nPresident Gompers states: \"Of the 900 unions affiliated directly with\r\nthe American Federation of Labor there are 169 composed exclusively of\r\nNegroes.\"\r\n\r\nA brief reference to the history of the national federations which\r\npreceded the American Federation of Labor shows that the foregoing policy\r\nhas been followed since shortly after the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe National Labor Union (1866-72), at its first convention in 1866, was\r\nthe first national federation of labor unions to deal with the problem of\r\nmeeting Negro competition after the Civil War. The formation of trades\r\nunions among colored people was favored. In 1869 Negro delegates were\r\nadmitted to the annual convention. A separate national Negro Labor Union,\r\nformed in 1869, was short-lived. The unfriendly attitude of the unions\r\ntoward the Negroes was the subject of bitter comment at the various\r\nsessions of the latter organization. The Knights of Labor, which rose\r\nto prominence after the decline of the National Labor Union, admitted\r\nall workers without regard to color. Many Negroes in the South joined\r\nthe organization. When the leadership of organized labor shifted from\r\nthe Knights of Labor to the American Federation of Labor in the late\r\neighties, the Federation continued to express the policy of no racial\r\ndiscrimination and has stood for that policy to the present time.[75]\r\nAt the convention of the American Federation of Labor in Atlantic City,\r\n1919, there were present about fifty Negro delegates, men and women.\r\nA large number of Negro delegates also attended the last convention of\r\nthe Federation at Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Illinois State Federation of Labor was outlined to\r\nthe Commission by Victor Olander, secretary-treasurer, as follows:\r\n\r\n     The State Federation of Labor is under the jurisdiction of\r\n     the American Federation of Labor, and the laws governing the\r\n     national would necessarily govern the state federation, so\r\n     that in respect to law they are the same. I might add that\r\n     they are carrying out the law in much the same manner with\r\n     respect to the Negro. There hasn't been a convention of the\r\n     Illinois State Federation of Labor held in many years that\r\n     hasn't had in attendance Negro delegates. That is the usual\r\n     thing at every convention. There is no discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Federation of Labor is the city central body of the various\r\nlocal unions in Chicago which are connected with the American Federation\r\nof Labor. Each of these local unions elects delegates to represent it\r\nat the semi-monthly meetings of the Chicago Federation. Negro delegates\r\ntake an active part in these meetings, and are cordially received. The\r\nFederation and its president have been very active in all efforts to\r\norganize Negroes, especially in the Stock Yards, the steel industry,\r\nand the culinary trades.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. POLICY OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL UNIONS\r\n\r\nIn considering the policy of national and international unions, that\r\nof the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor will\r\nbe discussed first, and following this the policy of six of the most\r\nimportant of the independent internationals.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. UNIONS AFFILIATED WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR\r\n\r\nThe American Federation of Labor has consistently followed a policy of no\r\nracial discrimination. It has, however, no power to compel its constituent\r\nnational and international unions to follow this policy. The question of\r\nrace discrimination by an autonomous national or international union has\r\nbeen frequently the subject of spirited discussion at American Federation\r\nof Labor conventions, but the outcome has been merely a recommendation\r\nto the offending union that the discrimination be discontinued. Since\r\nstrict autonomy of national and international unions is recognized in\r\nthe constitution of the American Federation of Labor, no more effective\r\naction can be taken.\r\n\r\nIn order to learn the racial policy of the 110 nationals and\r\ninternationals affiliated with the American Federation of Labor inquiries\r\nwere sent to each, and direct responses were received from sixty-nine.\r\nThe policy of twenty-five additional unions was learned through their\r\ndistrict councils or locals in Chicago. Thus all but sixteen of the 110\r\nnational and international unions in the American Federation of Labor\r\nwere covered. Of these, two were suspended from the American Federation\r\nof Labor in 1919-20. Only three have locals in Chicago, and all have\r\nlittle significance for Chicago. Information concerning the racial policy\r\nof the sixteen unions not heard from was supplied by labor leaders in\r\ntouch with the whole union situation and able to speak with authority\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nOf the 110 national and international unions affiliated with the American\r\nFederation of Labor, eight expressly bar the Negro by their constitutions\r\nor rituals. These unions are: Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America,\r\nInternational Association of Machinists, American Association of\r\nMasters, Mates, and Pilots, Railway Mail Association, Order of Railroad\r\nTelegraphers, the Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America, American\r\nWire Weavers' Protective Association, and Brotherhood of Railway Mail\r\nClerks.\r\n\r\nThus 102 of the 110 national and international unions affiliated with\r\nthe American Federation of Labor admit Negroes. Not all of these unions,\r\nhowever, have Negro members, notwithstanding the fact that Negroes are\r\neligible to membership. In accounting for the absence of Negro members,\r\ntwenty-eight national and international unions reported \"no Negroes\r\nin the trade,\" or \"no applications ever received.\" Certain of the 102\r\nnationals and internationals reported a small Negro membership with the\r\nfollowing explanations:\r\n\r\nEleven stated that employers discriminated against Negro members of the\r\nunion--wanted white men if they had to pay the union scale of wages.\r\n\r\nSeven internationals and five delegate bodies reported that special\r\nefforts were now being made to organize Negro workers.\r\n\r\nTwelve internationals called attention to long periods of\r\napprenticeship--four had a three-year period, six a four-year period,\r\nand two a five-year period--as a factor which accounted for the failure\r\nof Negroes to join.\r\n\r\nIn their comments, some of these union officials unconsciously express\r\ntheir prejudice, sometimes attributing traits to the Negro which they\r\nseem to take for granted as being characteristic. The following are some\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n     No Negroes have applied for membership in our union or did\r\n     not have nerve enough as it requires lots of climbing.\r\n\r\n     We do not have any Negroes in our organization, but there is\r\n     nothing in the constitution which prevents them from becoming\r\n     members after they have learned the trade. No one has ever\r\n     made application for a Negro. I judge this is because they\r\n     have to blow in the same pipe [in glass blowing].\r\n\r\n     I find nothing in our laws which bars Negroes from becoming\r\n     members of this union, but in my thirteen years in this office\r\n     I have never known one to make application for membership.\r\n     This may be due to the hazardous nature of our work.\r\n\r\n     Ours is usually very hard work. Negroes as a whole do not like\r\n     hard work. They instead very often prefer employment where\r\n     they can get along at their own gait or in their own way,\r\n     especially working in gangs.\r\n\r\nNational and international unions which had Negro members in appreciable\r\nnumbers reported the following facts:\r\n\r\nSixteen had Negro officers or organizers.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three reported that relations between the races in the unions\r\nwere undisturbed by race prejudice.\r\n\r\nThirty-three stated that Negroes had belonged to the union for the\r\nfollowing periods:\r\n\r\n                            Number of\r\n                              Unions\r\n\r\n      2 years or less          12\r\n      2 to 4 years              8\r\n      4 to 6 years              1\r\n      6 to 8 years              2\r\n      8 to 15 years             4\r\n     20 years                   4\r\n     25 years                   1\r\n     35 years                   1\r\n\r\n\r\n2. UNIONS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR\r\n\r\nThere are a number of unions[76] not affiliated with the American\r\nFederation of Labor, of which the most important are: the four railway\r\nbrotherhoods--Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, Brotherhood of Locomotive\r\nFiremen and Enginemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, Order of Railway\r\nConductors of America--Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Industrial\r\nWorkers of the World (I.W.W.). The four railway brotherhoods exclude\r\nthe Negro by constitutional provision. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers\r\nof America and the Industrial Workers of the World admit the Negro and\r\nmake special efforts to organize Negro workers. The I.W.W. has its main\r\nfoothold in the lumber, mine, and textile industries and does not have\r\nany strong unions in Chicago.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the classification of nationals and internationals based\r\nupon affiliation with the American Federation of Labor, a review of the\r\nfigures presented above shows that 104 national and international unions\r\nadmit the Negro, and that twelve exclude the Negro by written provision.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding fact with reference to these twelve organizations is that,\r\nwith the exception of the Wire Weavers, they are all connected with the\r\ntransportation industry: seven are members of the American Federation of\r\nLabor Railway Department and the other four constitute the big \"railway\r\nbrotherhoods.\" The latter are sometimes referred to by members of the\r\nunions as the \"aristocrats in the labor movement.\" All of these unions,\r\nexcept the Masters, Mates, and Pilots, have been organized more than\r\ntwenty years. None of the unions formed within the last twenty years,\r\nexcept the Masters, Mates, and Pilots, excludes the Negro.\r\n\r\nIn these crafts, excepting such trades as carmen, machinists, clerks,\r\nand firemen, it may be that in general the Negro would not be much of\r\na factor at present, because these trades demand an amount of education\r\nand skill not yet possessed by a large percentage of Negroes. But this\r\nby no means proves that the Negro would not acquire the necessary skill\r\nand education if opportunities in these trades were actually open to him.\r\n\r\nThe Railway Department of the American Federation of Labor is composed\r\nof fourteen craft unions, all but two of which exclude the Negro worker.\r\nThe Stationary Firemen and Oil Men of the American Federation of Labor\r\nRailway Department are openly soliciting Negro members. The only other\r\ncraft organization which admits Negroes is the Maintenance of Way Craft,\r\nwhich really means the common labor group. Negroes can get into this\r\ncraft through an auxiliary charter to a Negro local. Regardless of how\r\nskilled or how intelligent the applicant may be, or how logically he\r\nfalls into some other craft, he can only come in through one or the\r\nother of these two craft unions.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the railway brotherhoods is typified in remarks made to\r\nan investigator for the Commission by a member of the Brotherhood of\r\nRailway Clerks who is now serving on an important public commission.\r\nHe was emphatic in upholding the brotherhood's policy of excluding\r\nNegroes. \"As long as the engineers have anything to say about it, they\r\ncertainly will not get in.\" He said that the modern locomotive was a\r\nhighly complicated and scientific mechanism, and that the Negroes \"did\r\nnot have brains enough to run one.\"\r\n\r\nAs showing the contrasting view of another trade-union man, an employee\r\nof the public commission mentioned said that he had been a member of the\r\nUnited Mine Workers since 1901, and in that organization no color line\r\nis drawn; that he had worked beside Negro miners and feels no prejudice.\r\nHe pointed out that the national conventions of the miners always have\r\na large representation of Negro delegates, and some of the ablest and\r\nbest speakers come from the Negro race. He expressed the feeling that\r\nthe policy of the railway brotherhoods is a mistake, and is a case of\r\n\"swell-headedness.\"\r\n\r\nThe general exclusion policy of the railway brotherhoods and certain of\r\nthe unions in the Railway Department of the American Federation of Labor\r\nhas created a feeling of bitterness among Negroes which spreads beyond\r\nthese crafts and is directed against unions in general, notwithstanding\r\nthe constructive and progressive policy of the many unions which admit\r\nNegroes. In the transportation crafts it has led to the formation of a\r\n\"protest\" Negro railway union.\r\n\r\n_The Railway Men's International Benevolent Industrial Association._--This\r\norganization is a labor union open to Negro railway employees. It is\r\na protest organization which has grown up because of the exclusion of\r\nNegroes by the railway brotherhoods and certain unions in the Railway\r\nDepartment of the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nThe Association was organized May 12, 1915, and has seventeen locals\r\nin Chicago and a membership of about 1,200, all railway employees. The\r\nleaders of this group disclaimed any intention of building up \"a rival\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor among Negroes,\" but stated that, as far as\r\nthey were personally concerned, they would be willing to affiliate with\r\nthe American Federation of Labor in its proper department, _providing_\r\nall forms of discrimination in national and international unions, both\r\nin constitution and practice, were done away with, and the Negro worker\r\nwas assured of equal treatment and opportunity with the white worker.\r\nThey realize that the highest welfare of both groups depends upon\r\nco-operation. But, as to what the membership would want to do when that\r\ntime comes, they of course do not know.\r\n\r\nMr. Mays, the president of the organization, was asked by the Commission's\r\ninvestigator what he would do in a situation where both Negroes and\r\nwhites were organized separately, and the whites were going out on a\r\nstrike and had requested the Negroes to come out also. He stated that\r\nseveral such local strike situations had arisen in the South, and that\r\nhe had advised the Negro union in each of these cases to use its own\r\njudgment, but that if it decided to support the white unions, it should,\r\nbefore doing so, have a joint committee of both groups meet and make\r\nit understood absolutely that any agreement finally reached with the\r\nemployers must include both groups on equal terms. In one case, after\r\nsuch an agreement had been reached and the men had gone back to work,\r\nthe employer tried to keep out certain Negroes, but the white unionists\r\ninsisted that the agreement must be lived up to.\r\n\r\nThe officials of this organization are exceptionally capable Negroes;\r\nits advisers are professional men, well educated and thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the history and tactics of white labor unions.\r\n\r\nA more definite statement of the purpose and policies of this protest\r\norganization was made before the Commission by R. L. Mays:\r\n\r\n     The Railway Men's International Benevolent Industrial\r\n     Association really protests as an organization against unfair\r\n     and bad working conditions of the employer and against unfair\r\n     practices on the part of the American Federation of Labor and\r\n     the railway brotherhoods.\r\n\r\n     This is the crux of the problem as we see it. We agree with\r\n     the policies and principles of the American Federation of\r\n     Labor so long as they are American and in the interests of the\r\n     workmen, but if their practices are against Negroes, then we\r\n     are against the American Federation of Labor unflinchingly.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: To what extent have you found their practices\r\n     unfair to the colored people?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Mays_: There are fourteen unions in railway employment\r\n     in the American Federation of Labor. The United Brotherhood of\r\n     Railway Employees has been accepting Negroes in full membership,\r\n     but the other thirteen organizations do not accept Negroes in\r\n     membership. As a matter of fact, they are secured on contract,\r\n     which is the greatest holdback for the Negroes and breeds more\r\n     distrust on the part of the Negro in these places, so far as\r\n     the American Federation of Labor is concerned.\r\n\r\n     Before the roads were under government control certain\r\n     discriminatory practices were found in the South, but now\r\n     you will find colored men in certain skilled positions. In\r\n     the Brotherhood of Carmen, if a colored man is not organized\r\n     into the local union, he cannot advance automatically from\r\n     repair to car building. He might be a member of one of these\r\n     local unions chartered by and affiliated with the American\r\n     Federation of Labor. But under contract they say their members\r\n     must be white, and they use only white men. In the South our\r\n     men have enjoyed these jobs; under war conditions they were\r\n     brought here, but under this contract no Negro can be employed\r\n     as a carman, although he has all the experience in the world.\r\n     They refuse to take the colored man but take the white man.\r\n     No colored boy can go in as an apprentice and work up to a\r\n     skilled mechanic's position. Consequently they are reducing\r\n     the Negro railway worker to a position of common laborer and\r\n     automatically are keeping him down. If this is the condition\r\n     in the railways in the North, I say it will prevail everywhere.\r\n     I have said that it is a northern prejudice coming South.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE RAILWAY MEN'S INTERNATIONAL BENEVOLENT\r\n   INDUSTRIAL ASSOCIATION]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ATTITUDE AND POLICY OF LOCAL UNIONS IN CHICAGO\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WHITE AND NEGRO MEMBERSHIP IN CHICAGO LOCAL UNIONS\r\n\r\nMuch effort was made to obtain statistics of white and Negro membership\r\nin local trade unions in Chicago. Information was sought through requests\r\naddressed to the national headquarters of all national and international\r\nunions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor for data as to\r\nany local unions they might have in Chicago. Requests were also addressed\r\ndirectly to these local unions as listed in a directory published by\r\nthe Chicago Trade Union Label League. Further requests were addressed to\r\nlocal unions in Chicago directly affiliated with the American Federation\r\nof Labor as listed in a directory of all such unions published by that\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to ascertain the exact number of local unions in\r\nChicago. Those covered embraced, however, as full a list as could be\r\nsupplied by trade-union offices in Chicago. But the president of the\r\nChicago Federation of Labor said that the number of local unions was\r\nchanging so continually by reason of the organization of new ones and\r\nthe consolidation of two or more into one, that no accurate list was\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nData for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and for the Railway\r\nMen's International Industrial Benevolent Association were obtained\r\ndirectly from those organizations.\r\n\r\nReports were received from the railway brotherhoods saying that they\r\nexclude Negroes, but giving no data as to the number of white members.\r\n\r\nThe information which was obtained may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                                   Members\r\n\r\n   371 local unions affiliated with the American Federation of\r\n     Labor, comprising locals of national and international unions\r\n     so affiliated, and also federal and local unions directly\r\n     affiliated with the American Federation of Labor              253,237\r\n\r\n   11 local unions of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of\r\n     America                                                        40,000\r\n\r\n   17 local unions of the Railway Men's International Industrial\r\n     Benevolent Association                                          1,200\r\n                                                                   -------\r\n                                                                   294,437\r\n\r\nThe total Negro membership reported for Chicago by the foregoing\r\norganizations was 12,106. The number of locals through which this Negro\r\nmembership was distributed cannot be stated with any approach to accuracy,\r\ndue to the fact that in a number of cases the district council or the\r\nnational body reported the membership for its Chicago locals jointly.\r\nIn such cases it could not safely be assumed that each of the locals in\r\nquestion had Negro members. Disregarding all such cases, however, there\r\nstill remains a total of at least eighty-five Chicago locals for which,\r\nindividually, Negro members were reported.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, judging by the figures here shown as to\r\nwhite and Negro membership in local unions in Chicago, the proportion of\r\nNegro union members to the Negro population in Chicago is almost exactly\r\nthe same as the proportion of white members to the white population in\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. METHODS OF DEALING WITH NEGRO APPLICANTS\r\n\r\nIf the unions which bar the Negro are chosen as examples, organized labor\r\nmight appear to be very unfair to Negro workers. On the other hand, if\r\nunions which admit them into the same locals and have Negro organizers\r\nand officers are chosen as examples, it might appear that there was no\r\nprejudice whatever against Negroes on the part of trade unions. Neither\r\nextreme would represent the facts. On the basis of policy toward the\r\nNegro, unions in Chicago may be divided into four classes or types.\r\nThese classes are:\r\n\r\nA. Unions admitting Negroes to white locals.\r\n\r\nB. Unions admitting Negroes to separate co-ordinate locals.\r\n\r\nC. Unions admitting Negroes to subordinate or auxiliary locals.\r\n\r\nD. Unions excluding Negroes from membership.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these classes indicates the fact that the union\r\nattitude and policy toward the Negro cannot be summed up by any simple\r\ngeneralization. Each class or type has its own policy, and even within\r\nthe class there are minor variations of attitude and policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. UNIONS ADMITTING NEGROES TO WHITE LOCALS\r\n\r\nWherever and whenever Negroes are admitted on an equal basis and given\r\na square deal, the feeling inside the union is nearly always harmonious.\r\nThis is true in such unions as the Butcher Workmen's, Hodcarriers', Flat\r\nJanitors', and Ladies' Garment Workers', which include important fields\r\nof Negro labor in Chicago.\r\n\r\n_Stock Yards' unions._--The Stock Yards' strike of 1904 was broken by\r\nthe use of Negroes. This was the opening wedge for the admittance to\r\nthe union of the large number of Negroes which followed. No organization\r\nthereafter could hope to amount to anything in the Yards unless it took\r\nin Negroes. From 1917 until the riot of 1919 Negroes in large numbers\r\nwere joining the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen's Union of\r\nNorth America. Forty locals were formed. The Negro was welcome to join\r\nany local he desired, whether it was predominantly Polish or Irish or\r\nNegro. However, the majority gravitated to Local 651, which was composed\r\nmainly of Negroes and had Negro officers and organizers and headquarters\r\nnear the \"Black Belt.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not unnatural, since the headquarters of the various local unions\r\nare distributed over the city with a view to their convenience for the\r\nmembers. Most of the Negro members live within the \"Black Belt.\" The\r\nmost active Negro organizer in the city is connected with this local.\r\nNegroes living outside this area belong to the locals nearest their homes.\r\n\r\nEfforts to organize Negro workers in the Yards are commented upon in\r\nthe _Negro Year Book_ of 1918-19 in the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n     That the unions are doing much to organize Negro labor is\r\n     indicated by the fact that of the more than ten thousand\r\n     Negro workers in the Chicago packing houses, over 60 per\r\n     cent are reported in the unions. The International Union of\r\n     Butchers' Workmen, which has jurisdiction over 90 per cent of\r\n     the employees in the packing houses of the country, has three\r\n     paid Negro organizers. In other lines of work there is equal\r\n     activity in organizing Negro labor.\r\n\r\nThe unions succeeded in securing an agreement under which Judge Samuel\r\nAlschuler was mutually accepted by the packing companies and the unions\r\nas an arbitrator on matters affecting working conditions in the Yards,\r\nespecially hours and wages. This agreement applies to all who work in the\r\nYards, whether in or out of the union, but, according to labor leaders,\r\nunion action and union money \"put it across.\" Consequently there was\r\nthe feeling that all who benefited should join and help share in the\r\nexpense, and a feeling of hostility toward such Negroes, and whites\r\nas well for that matter, who did not join because they found that they\r\ncould get all the benefits of the arrangement without paying dues.\r\n\r\nWhile the Commission's investigator was interviewing the officials of\r\none of the unions of the packing industry at their headquarters, a number\r\nof the white members dropped in to pay their dues. In conversation they\r\nshowed, quite unsolicited, that considerable feeling existed because the\r\nNegro workers were not coming into the union. They felt that the Negroes\r\nwere receiving all the benefits secured for the workers by the unions\r\nwithout paying their proportion of the expense of the organization. In\r\nfact, several used rather strong terms with the words \"fink\" and \"scabs.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of the men present seemed to be that, while mistakes had\r\nbeen made on both sides in the 1904 strike and since, the antagonistic\r\nfeeling had been pretty largely eliminated, as was shown by the large\r\nNegro membership prior to the riot, and they said that every effort was\r\nbeing made at that time and since to bring the Negro into the union.\r\nConferences had been held with Negro ministers and other organizations\r\nexplaining the position of the unions, literature had been distributed,\r\nand a great deal of money had been spent through Negro organizers, and yet\r\nthe results were disappointingly small. These white union men contended\r\nthat they were opposed by an effective combination of \"packers'\" influence\r\nhard to beat and intensively interested in keeping the races apart for\r\nits own purposes in opposing union organization.\r\n\r\n_The Hod Carriers_ have sixteen locals in Chicago with a large total\r\nmembership. No racial record is kept, but Negroes are admitted without\r\ndiscrimination into all of the unions. A few years ago the Negro\r\nmembership was between 1,200 and 1,400; at present with an increase of 300\r\nto 500 from the South, the secretary of the executive council estimates\r\nthe total Negro membership to be at least 1,700, most of whom have joined\r\ntwo locals. The president of the Evanston union and the vice-president\r\nof the Chicago Heights union are colored. No feeling of discrimination\r\nexists, all being treated alike as long as they pay their dues and live\r\nup to the rules. The Hod Carriers have joint arbitration agreements with\r\nthe employing contractors' associations in this industry, and no strikes\r\nhave been called since 1900.\r\n\r\n_The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union_ is another illustration\r\nof a union which accords Negroes the same treatment as white members,\r\nand where the relationship is entirely harmonious. This union has never\r\ndrawn the race, creed, or color line and is trying to leave out the word\r\n\"white\" and \"colored\" from its minutes and reports. The Negro girls came\r\ninto this industry as strike breakers within the last three years.\r\n\r\nThe officials of this union, in interviews and in testimony before the\r\nCommission, claimed that whenever any friction did arise it was due\r\nto the fact that the employers in this industry discriminated against\r\nNegro girls and paid them less than white girls. The agreement between\r\nthe ladies' garment manufacturers and the union provided a weekly\r\nwage of $37.40 for skirt and dress operators--85 cents per hour for a\r\nforty-four-hour week. Negro operators in non-union factories for the\r\nsame work were being paid from $18.00 to $25.00 per week. Union skirt\r\nand dress finishers were being paid $26.40 per week--60 cents per hour\r\nfor forty-four hours. Negro operators in non-union factories averaged\r\n$15.00 per week for the same work and frequently worked longer than\r\nforty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe relations of whites and Negroes in the union were discussed before\r\nthe Commission by Max Brodsky, a representative of the union, who said:\r\n\r\n     As a result of the 1917 strike we have now about 450 colored\r\n     women workers in our industry. We lost the strike, and this is\r\n     how the colored women got into our industry. Now the union knew\r\n     the object of the colored women coming into our industry, and\r\n     we decided to have them organized just like the white women\r\n     and girls, so we established this particular union. They are\r\n     at present conscientious union girls and women. It was the\r\n     policy of the union not to discriminate against the colored\r\n     women who broke the strike in 1917. This helped us.\r\n\r\nAt the same conference, Agnes Nestor, president of the Women's Trade\r\nUnion League, testified as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Miss Nestor_: In the ladies' garments work, the unions have\r\n     taken in colored girls on the same basis as the white girls.\r\n     They made a colored girl a chairman of their shop meeting.\r\n     There is no feeling there with them as far as I know.\r\n\r\n     _Miss McDowell_: Didn't they elect a colored girl as shop\r\n     steward where they had both white and colored girls?\r\n\r\n     _Miss Nestor_: Yes.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of employers' discrimination against Negro workers,\r\nand of the efforts of the union to protect Negroes when they become\r\nmembers of the union, the case of a manufacturer was cited whose shop\r\nhad only Negro workers. Shortly after the union had organized them they\r\nwere locked out. Later the employer was willing to settle \"providing\r\nyou sent us a set of white workers.\" The union refused to do this and\r\ncalled a strike.\r\n\r\nThe union claimed that in many recent cases where Negro girls were sent\r\nout on jobs the employers would refuse them when they found out that\r\nthey had to pay them the same scale as white workers. During 1917-18,\r\nowing to the war, the manufacturers worked in harmony with the unions\r\nbecause they had to; since the war, and largely within the first few\r\nmonths of 1920, the manufacturers have opened many shops on the South\r\nSide employing only non-union colored girls. In the various strikes\r\nin which this union has been engaged for this same period, the strike\r\nbreakers have been Negro girls secured for the employers through a Negro\r\nminister acting as a labor agent or solicitor.\r\n\r\n_The Flat Janitors' Union_ has a membership of approximately 5,000, of\r\nwhom 1,000 are Negroes. It includes many nationalities with strong racial\r\nfeelings, yet, as stated by Mr. Fitzpatrick, president of the Chicago\r\nFederation of Labor, rarely is any complaint made against this union by\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nInterviews with the president and other officials, attendance at a\r\nsession of the Executive Board, and attendance at a crowded meeting of the\r\nunion, where transaction of general business, nomination of candidates\r\nfor the coming election, and initiation of new members occurred, gave\r\nthe Commission's investigator ample opportunity for observation of the\r\nattitude toward Negroes.\r\n\r\nThis union, organized in 1904, started out with a Negro as recording\r\nsecretary and business agent. At the time of the interviews, the\r\nvice-president and three members of the Executive Board were Negroes.\r\nThese had been elected for a three-year term. At the general meeting\r\nattended, the Negro officers were renominated unanimously to hold office\r\nfor a period of five years. In addition, several more Negroes were\r\nnominated as stewards and as delegates to the Chicago Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\nAccording to the members, discrimination in this craft is practiced by\r\nthe flat and apartment owners. The experience of the union is that as\r\nsoon as a Negro is taken into the union and demands the union scale the\r\nowner calls up the union and says, \"If I have to pay these wages I'm\r\ngoing to get a good white man.\"\r\n\r\nThe position taken by the union is that if a Negro has had the job he\r\nmust be allowed to stay there and get the scale, and the union will back\r\nhim up in the fight for it. The threat of a strike against a building\r\nis usually effective.\r\n\r\nInquiry among Negro janitors in the residence districts brought up a\r\ncase in which one Negro claimed that Negroes were forced into the union\r\nand then usually found themselves discriminated against by the white\r\nmembers, especially by Belgians, and soon or later, were squeezed out of\r\nthe good jobs. However, this Negro admitted that he had not attended a\r\nunion meeting since his initiation, except to stop in to pay his dues,\r\nand that he had never made a complaint to the Negro officer of the\r\nunion. The officers of the union admitted that there was, in the many\r\nracial groups in this craft, strong racial feeling, especially among\r\nAustrians and Belgians, who seemed to feel that whenever a janitor died\r\nor left the job, or an assistant or helper was needed, such job should\r\nalways be filled with members of their own nationality. However, the\r\nNegro officials claimed that with three Negroes on the Executive Board\r\nand a Negro vice-president, any complaint coming from a Negro would\r\nsurely be fairly dealt with; but that unless their attention was called\r\nto unsatisfactory conditions the union could not be expected to know of\r\nthem, and in such cases it was not the union that was to blame, but the\r\nmember himself.\r\n\r\nFrequently, in those unions in which the Negroes are not admitted into\r\nthe same locals with the whites, the reasons given for putting them\r\ninto separate locals or auxiliaries is that the white members object\r\nto the close physical contact or association in meetings, especially\r\nwhere there is some element of ritual in connection with the meetings.\r\nAt the meeting of the Janitors' Union attended by the investigator,\r\nnew pass words were given out, and all members, white and Negro, had to\r\ncome before the Negro vice-president, who whispered the words to each\r\nand they in turn repeated them to him. Not the slightest hesitancy was\r\nnoted on the part of the white members, but rather a hearty handshake or\r\na slap on the back seemed to be the rule. Again, in taking in nineteen\r\nnew members, four of whom were Negroes, the major part of the ceremony\r\nwas performed by the Negro vice-president. At this meeting, packed to\r\nstanding-room and attended by well over a thousand members, Negroes were\r\na large percentage of those present. These were not confined to a group\r\nby themselves, but were scattered in all parts of the hall and seemed\r\nto be in cordial conversation with the white members.\r\n\r\nA number of interesting comments by members and officers of unions\r\nadmitting Negroes on equal terms with whites were volunteered, either\r\nin interviews or in correspondence. In one union of 700 highly skilled\r\nworkers receiving $1.50 an hour, or $12.00 a day, no Negroes were found\r\nto be members, although they are not barred by the constitution. It was\r\nsuggested that the five-year apprenticeship period discouraged Negroes. It\r\nwas further noted that admittance was by a two-thirds vote, a provision\r\nwhich could easily result in the exclusion of any race which two-thirds\r\nof the members did not like. The investigator's report of his interview\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     The business representative of this union was strongly of\r\n     the personal opinion that unions had made a mistake in ever\r\n     admitting the Negro into any of the unions. He claimed that\r\n     the employers' only interest in them was as a lever to keep\r\n     wages down for the workers.\r\n\r\n     Two other members of the League took a contrary position and\r\n     held that Negro labor was in the field, and that while the\r\n     employer's interest in the Negro was simply to play one group\r\n     against another to keep expense down as low as possible, it\r\n     was really up to labor itself to solve the question and that\r\n     the Negroes must be taken into unions. They admitted that\r\n     undoubtedly prejudice existed, but that it was gradually being\r\n     overcome.\r\n\r\nOther comments are as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom an officer of the Teamsters and Chauffeurs: \"We have had one Negro\r\nholding office as trustee for several years. So feeling is brotherly.\"\r\n\r\nFrom an officer of a specialized mechanics' union: \"There has been no\r\nsign of race feeling or hatred since we have been organized. We have\r\nsix officers (one colored). I myself, being colored, have no complaints\r\nwhatever against my white brothers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a Negro officer of the Mattress Makers: \"Discrimination and race\r\nprejudice does not exist in this union. We are one happy family. It seems\r\nimpossible to organize the other Negro mattress makers. Would appreciate\r\nsome assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nB. UNIONS ADMITTING NEGROES TO SEPARATE CO-ORDINATE LOCALS\r\n\r\nCertain unions organize Negroes into separate locals which are in all\r\nrespects co-ordinate with the white locals belonging to the same unions.\r\nThe reason for maintaining separate Negro locals is either (1) preference\r\nof the Negro workers for locals of their own, or (2) unwillingness of\r\nwhite workers to admit Negroes to white locals. It often seemed that\r\nthe second indicated the real situation, the first reason being given\r\nas an excuse for it.\r\n\r\nThe important factor is the reason for the existence of separate Negro\r\nlocals rather than the fact of separation. This is illustrated by the\r\nexperience of the Painters' and Musicians' unions on the one hand, and\r\nthat of the Waiters' Union on the other.\r\n\r\nDuring July, 1920, twenty Negro painters applied to the Painters' District\r\nCouncil for membership in the Painters' Union. They passed the required\r\nexamination but, instead of being placed in the existing Painters' Union,\r\nwere given temporary working permits which identified them as members of\r\n\"South Side Colored Local.\" They immediately suspected that some effort\r\nwas being made to place them in a separate Negro local in which they\r\ncould not get the full benefits of union membership. They then went to\r\ndiscuss the matter with the editor of a Negro paper which had expressed\r\nthe point of view of many Negroes concerning labor unions in its editorial\r\ncolumns. This editor told them his belief that the Painters' District\r\nCouncil was merely duplicating the practices of several other unions in\r\nthe city, and was attempting to limit these men to a \"Jim Crow\" union.\r\nThey returned to the president of the District Council, who explained\r\nthat he had to keep track of all temporary permits issued, and inasmuch\r\nas the charter for their local was not yet issued he could not know\r\nthe number until issued. He had to put the description on the cards to\r\nidentify the men temporarily.\r\n\r\nA charter for the local was given from national headquarters, and the\r\nnew cards were issued, designating them simply as members of Local No.\r\n----. The membership of this local, exclusively Negro, grew from twenty\r\nto seventy-five in two months. One of the Negro officials of the local\r\nstated that its members had been working in all parts of the Chicago\r\nDistrict, including the North Side and Evanston, and that they had\r\na representative on the District Council. The attitude of the white\r\nworkers, he stated, was a little cool on the first day, but there is\r\nnow no evidence of friction. He thought that the members of this local\r\nwere well pleased and happy.\r\n\r\n_The Negro Musicians_ are organized into a strong separate local,\r\nchartered in 1902. It has a membership of approximately 325. It has held\r\nthe Municipal Pier dance-hall contract for three years, and besides\r\nmany other contracts in the city. It furnishes players for various\r\noccasions for a considerable territory outside of Chicago. This group\r\nmuch prefers its own union, but works jointly with the large white union,\r\nthe Chicago Federation of Musicians, whenever matters come up affecting\r\nboth organizations. Both unions have the same wage scale.\r\n\r\nWhere Negro workers are permitted to join white locals but prefer to have\r\ntheir own colored local there is no feeling that they are discriminated\r\nagainst, occasional joint meetings with white locals being characterized\r\nby friendly interest and good fellowship. Where, however, a union closes\r\nthe door of its white locals to Negroes and organizes them into separate\r\nlocals because the white members object to contact with Negroes, a very\r\ndifficult situation exists. This condition is illustrated by the methods\r\nof the Waiters' Union in Chicago.\r\n\r\nNegro waiters are not admitted into the white Waiters' Union, but are\r\nplaced in the Pullman Porters and Dining-Car Waiters' Union, which is\r\na local affiliated with the same international as the white Waiters'\r\nUnion. The makeshift of putting Negro waiters, although employed in city\r\nhotels, restaurants, and cafés, into this local is pointed to by Negroes\r\nas unmistakable evidence of discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe culinary strike in Chicago, which started May 1, 1920, resulted in\r\nfailure for the unions concerned largely because Negroes acted as strike\r\nbreakers. This is easily accounted for by the fact that seventeen years\r\nago Negro waiters lost their positions in many of the first-class hotels\r\nand restaurants in the business district through circumstances in which\r\nthey felt that they had been \"double-crossed\" by the unions, of which\r\nthey then were members.\r\n\r\nThe Negro strike breakers in 1920, however, found themselves again\r\ndisplaced, this time through the action of employers. A typical instance\r\nwas found in the restaurant of a hotel patronized largely by people of\r\nGerman descent, the managers as well as many of the former waiters being\r\nof German extraction. These waiters, some of whom had been employed for\r\nmany years in this restaurant, were members of the union and went out\r\nwhen the strike was called. The managers replaced them with Negroes.\r\nThe latter filled the positions with apparent satisfaction for nearly a\r\nyear, when suddenly they were all discharged and the old waiters taken\r\nback.\r\n\r\nA regular patron of the restaurant, a man of German descent, expressed\r\nvigorous views upon the \"injustice\" with which the Negroes had been\r\ntreated by the management, which should have appreciated their service\r\nthrough the period when the former waiters caused trouble. He said he had\r\nalways found the Negroes efficient and willing, and many of them \"very\r\nintelligent fellows.\" Although of the same nationality as the managers\r\nand the former waiters, many of whom he had known for years, he did not\r\nlet this national feeling blind him to what he considered most unfair\r\ntreatment of the Negroes. He said that he had discussed the matter with\r\none of the managers and had been told that the reason why the Negroes had\r\nbeen discharged and the old waiters taken back was because of complaints\r\nagainst the Negroes by patrons of the restaurant. He added, \"I think\r\nthat's bunk.\"\r\n\r\nA change in the officers of the Waiters' Union at the recent election\r\nhas placed in power a group which recognizes that the entire policy of\r\nthe culinary unions must be co-ordinated and proper provision made for\r\nthe large Negro element in the field. If this is not done, it is felt\r\nthat a rival Negro union may be organized, similar to that organized\r\nby the Negro railway workers. In fact, even now a beginning has been\r\nmade toward such an organization by a few high-grade Negro waiters who\r\nhave been in active charge of the waiters of several of the large hotel\r\ndining-rooms during the recent strike.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. UNIONS ADMITTING NEGROES TO SUBORDINATE OR AUXILIARY LOCALS\r\n\r\nThe practice of admitting Negroes to subordinate locals appears to be\r\nvery unusual in Chicago. The investigation disclosed only one instance\r\nwhere the policy of the union was to admit Negroes only to subordinate\r\nlocals. The Commission is not at liberty to publish the name of this\r\nunion, which makes the following provision for Negro locals in its\r\nconstitution:\r\n\r\n     Where there are a sufficient number of colored helpers they\r\n     may be organized as an auxiliary local and shall be under\r\n     the jurisdiction of the white local union having jurisdiction\r\n     over that locality; and minutes of said auxiliary local must\r\n     be submitted to duly authorized officers of said white local\r\n     for their approval.\r\n\r\n     In shops where there is a grievance committee of the white\r\n     local, grievances of members of said auxiliary local will be\r\n     handled by that committee.\r\n\r\n     Members of auxiliary locals composed of colored helpers shall\r\n     not transfer except to another auxiliary local composed of\r\n     colored members, and colored helpers will not be promoted to\r\n     ... or helper apprentice; and will not be admitted to shops\r\n     where white helpers are now employed.\r\n\r\n     Auxiliary locals will be represented in all conventions by\r\n     the delegates elected from the white local in that locality.\r\n\r\nThe officials of this union stoutly maintain that the provisions above\r\nquoted are not discriminatory, and they are at a loss to explain why\r\nattempts to organize Negro workers in Chicago into auxiliary locals have\r\nnot met with success.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. UNIONS EXCLUDING NEGROES FROM MEMBERSHIP\r\n\r\nChicago locals which exclude the Negro do so either in conformity with\r\nthe laws of their national unions or in the exercise of \"local option.\"\r\nLocals belonging to the national and international unions which bar the\r\nNegro by written provision in their constitutions or rituals are obliged\r\nto follow the same racial policy as their parent bodies. This number\r\nincludes the Chicago locals belonging to the eight American Federation of\r\nLabor national unions which exclude the Negro, and the locals of the four\r\nrailway brotherhoods which likewise exclude the Negro by constitutional\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the locals which are bound to follow the policy of their\r\nnationals, there are certain other locals which are known to reject\r\nNegro applicants. By allowing their locals to practice \"local option\"\r\nor to require a majority or two-thirds vote for election to membership,\r\nthe progressive policy of certain American Federation of Labor national\r\nand international unions which admit the Negro is nullified.\r\n\r\nThe Machinists' Union has frequently been referred to as a union which,\r\nalthough complying in its constitution with the American Federation of\r\nLabor policy of no racial discrimination, still effectually bars the\r\nNegro by a provision in its secret ritual. In effect, however, there is\r\nno real difference between such a policy on the part of the Machinists'\r\nUnion and that of the unions which apparently practice exclusion as\r\nan unwritten law. With the Machinists' Union must then be grouped such\r\nunions as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' International Alliance,\r\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers of America, and United\r\nAssociation of Plumbers and Steam Fitters of United States and Canada. The\r\nElectricians' Union has only one Negro member out of a total membership\r\nof 11,000 in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ATTITUDE OF NEGROES TOWARD UNION ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nFrom its attitude toward labor unions the Negro population of Chicago\r\nmay be considered in four groups: (1) racial leaders outside the labor\r\nmovement--ministers, editors, politicians, etc.; (2) Negroes with a\r\nspecial interest in opposing unions; (3) Negro workers outside of the\r\nunions; (4) Negro workers within the ranks of the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. RACIAL LEADERS OUTSIDE OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nWithin this group are found many sincere workers for the welfare of the\r\nrace. Their attitude is determined by the apparent practicability of\r\ncourses of action for Negroes in relation to the unions. These attitudes\r\nagain depend upon their familiarity with the principles and purposes of\r\nunionism. They recognize that the entrance of large numbers of Negroes in\r\nindustry has been recent. The belief is that the employers rather than\r\nthe labor unions provided this first opportunity, and since, under most\r\nfrequent circumstances, the holding of these positions has been due to\r\nthe kindly attitude of employers, they felt that first loyalty was due\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThey have also been affected by experiences with labor unions which in\r\nthe past have not been disposed to accept Negroes freely into membership\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the interest of employers in securing Negroes has not always\r\nbeen merely the granting of an opportunity for work, where Negroes\r\nhave entered as strike breakers they have usually remained. This recent\r\nentrance into industry has made them, for the first time, a considerable\r\nfactor, and they feel that the unions, recognizing their importance\r\nto the accomplishment of union aims, are making appeals to them for\r\nmembership, not out of a spirit of brotherhood, but merely to advance\r\ntheir purposes.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have largely determined the attitude of many Negro\r\nleaders, especially the ministers, some of whom have been requested\r\nby employers to recommend members of their congregations for jobs in\r\nvarious fields of industry. At a recent industrial convention of Negro\r\norganizations controlling the employment of thousands of Negro workers, it\r\nwas decided that Negroes would not be sent as strike breakers to plants\r\nwhere the strikers' unions accepted Negroes, and that they would advise\r\nNegroes to join the unions wherever possible, but that where Negroes\r\nare offered positions by employers in trades where Negroes are excluded\r\nfrom the unions, they would not be advised to forego the opportunity.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent Negro woman, who has been active in trying to acquaint\r\nministers with union aims and methods, commented upon the fact that\r\nuntil recently Negro ministers knew very little about unionism, except\r\nthat employers were opposed to it. This was enough to influence many\r\nministers to urge Negro workers to stay out of labor unions and thus\r\ndemonstrate their loyalty to employers who had given them a chance in\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nA prominent Negro leader, a member of the Illinois legislature, stated\r\nhis position respecting unions, at one of the industrial conferences\r\nheld by the Commission, as follows:\r\n\r\n     I want to confess that I have never felt that I could\r\n     intelligently advise the colored people who ask me whether\r\n     laboring people should join the unions. It has been the opinion\r\n     of the leaders of our race for years that employers of labor\r\n     felt more kindly toward colored labor and were less concerned\r\n     about the color of the workmen--were only concerned about the\r\n     character of the service. We felt as leaders of the race that\r\n     the labor employer was given a square deal much more than the\r\n     employee himself.... We had a strike here of waiters several\r\n     years ago when the Kohlsaat lunchroom waiters were involved.\r\n     I was the president of a men's Sunday club, and some labor\r\n     agitators got the colored boys to join the white Waiters'\r\n     Union, and I remember when the matter came before the club I\r\n     told them, \"They raised your wages to the white man's scale,\r\n     and the white men are raising you out in the street,\" and that\r\n     is what they did too.... I have been somewhat influenced by\r\n     that experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. NEGROES WITH A SPECIAL INTEREST IN OPPOSING UNIONS\r\n\r\nThe rift between employers and labor unions has provided a field of\r\nexploitation for certain less responsible Negroes. Their operations\r\nhave occasioned bitter feeling between Negroes and labor unions and have\r\naccomplished little or nothing for the Negro workers. A Negro editor of\r\na small and irresponsible paper advises Negro workers not to join the\r\nwhite man's union, but instead to join a union which he has formed and of\r\nwhich he is president. He is looked upon with suspicion by representative\r\nNegroes of Chicago, who believe that he is willing to sacrifice the best\r\ninterests of the race to serve his own purposes. A well-informed Negro\r\noutlined the method employed by the editor in question to represent\r\nhimself to employers of labor as one who controls large numbers of Negro\r\nlaborers. In furtherance of this plan, which appears to have prospered,\r\nhe organized a group which he called the \"American Unity Labor Union.\"\r\nThe appeal on the one hand to Negroes was that white unions would not\r\nadmit them on an equal basis and that white employers preferred Negro\r\nnon-unionists to white unionists and would pay them the same wages while\r\naccording them better treatment. To white employers he represented the\r\nNegroes as being opposed to unions because they were white men's unions,\r\nand as such discriminated against Negroes, and that they belonged in\r\nlarge numbers to his organization, which was designed to improve the\r\nquality of Negro labor by increasing Negro pride in special and unmixed\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\nThat certain employers did give money for this kind of service is apparent\r\nin several instances. A Negro ex-clergyman secured for a long period\r\nsomething like $2.00 per capita for every Negro supplied by him to any\r\none of ten iron foundries in the Calumet district.\r\n\r\nThe following are typical of advertisements which appear regularly in\r\nthe paper of the Negro editor referred to above:\r\n\r\n                                  WANTED\r\n\r\n     100 Building Laborers to work in the city of Chicago at Building\r\n     Scale Wages. Union Job. If you are not a Union man you can\r\n     get a permit to work as a Union Man at ---- Indiana Avenue.\r\n\r\n     Do not pay $33.00 to join a white man's union, when you can\r\n     join the black man's union for $5.00 and work on any building\r\n     in Chicago.\r\n\r\n                             WAGE EARNERS CLUB\r\n\r\n     American Unity Labor Union was organized March 10th, 1917,\r\n     Chicago, Illinois.\r\n\r\n                   GET A SQUARE DEAL WITH YOUR OWN RACE\r\n\r\n     Time has come for Negroes to do now or never. Get together\r\n     and stick together is the call of the Negro. Like all other\r\n     races, make your own way; other races have made their unions\r\n     for themselves. They are not going to give it to you just\r\n     because you join his union. Make a union of your own race;\r\n     union is strength. Join the American Unity Packers Union of\r\n     the Stock Yards, this will give you a card to work at any\r\n     trade or a common laborer, as a steam fitter, electrician,\r\n     fireman, merchants, engineers, carpenters, butchers, helpers,\r\n     and chauffeurs to drive trucks down town, delivering meat as\r\n     white chauffeurs do for Armour's and Swift's, or other Packers.\r\n     A card from this Union will let you work in Kansas City, Omaha\r\n     and St. Louis, or any other city where the five Packers have\r\n     packing houses.\r\n\r\n     This Union does not _believe in strikes_. We believe all\r\n     differences between laborers and capitalists can be arbitrated.\r\n     Strike is our last motive if any at all.\r\n\r\n     _Get in line for a good job. You are next. Office, ---- Indiana\r\n     Ave._\r\n\r\n                          THE WORKING MEN'S CLUB\r\n\r\n     Join the American Unity Steel and Metal Union, a Union of your\r\n     own race with officers of your own race with a President. A\r\n     card from this Union will entitle you to work any place in the\r\n     United States as a steel and iron worker, craneman, engineer,\r\n     molders, rail straighteners, and any job that it takes brains\r\n     and skill to do and common laborer. _Join one big union and\r\n     demand a square deal with your own strength_. 8 hour day's work.\r\n\r\n     _Get in line for a good job. You are next. Office, ---- Indiana\r\n     Ave._\r\n\r\n     All classes and kinds of work waiting for good people in our\r\n     Association.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of December, 1920, the editor in question visited\r\nthe large daily newspapers in Chicago and presented an article which\r\npurported to tell of a large mass meeting of his union at which this\r\ngroup decided that they would work at the Stock Yards, steel mills, and\r\nall other plants in Chicago and the Calumet region and at all foundries\r\nand factories at a 15 per cent discount on wages previously paid for\r\nskilled labor, and 10 per cent on common-labor wages. Although only one\r\npaper gave any attention to this statement, the opinion of some of the\r\nmore responsible Negroes was expressed in a Negro newspaper in Chicago,\r\nwhich characterized the man as \"a public nuisance\" and his story as\r\n\"bunk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NEGRO WORKERS OUTSIDE OF UNIONS\r\n\r\nNegro workers outside of the union ranks often do not see any necessity\r\nfor unionism or do not understand its aims and methods; many are frankly\r\nsuspicious of the good intentions of white unionists toward Negroes;\r\nothers condemn unions generally because of some bitter experience with\r\na particular union, while still others are enthusiastic believers in\r\nunionism and expect to join a union at some time. Several shades of\r\nopinion are illustrated by the following quotations taken at random from\r\ninterviews with a large number of Negro workers.\r\n\r\n     H---- G----, thirty-four years old, left a farm in Georgia\r\n     to come to Chicago in October, 1919. Employed as a laborer\r\n     in a paper-box manufacturing plant. He said he didn't know\r\n     much about unions but couldn't see what good they were doing.\r\n     They made prices go up, but wages didn't go up with prices.\r\n     If unions did any good he would join, but he can't see that\r\n     they do.\r\n\r\n     W---- W---- had spent nearly all of his life hauling logs to\r\n     be made into ties for railroads. When he came here from the\r\n     South he worked as a trucker in the Quartermaster's Department\r\n     of the army until the department closed. After loafing half a\r\n     month, he got his present job trucking at a box factory. Unions\r\n     would be all right, in his opinion, if they let all of the\r\n     men in who would do right, but when they don't, they do more\r\n     harm than good. He used to belong to the Butchers' Union at\r\n     the Stock Yards and \"got along fine,\" but he quit butchering.\r\n     He intends to get back in a union if possible. Strikes are\r\n     too hard on the man that \"ain't in the union; strike out here\r\n     recently and now we can't make overtime and we hardly make\r\n     enough in regular time to live on. Unions are secret--I can't\r\n     remember all the bunk about them now, but you pay dues and go\r\n     to meetings, something like a lodge I guess. If anything goes\r\n     wrong on your job you tell it in meeting, and your branch of\r\n     the union takes it up with the people. You don't have any of\r\n     that worry on yourself. They are all right if you are on the\r\n     inside, but mighty hard if you ain't.\"\r\n\r\n     J---- McN----, forty-two years old, had been a farmer in the\r\n     South all of his life until he came to Chicago in January,\r\n     1920, and went to work in the Yards as a meat trimmer. He has\r\n     been asked to join the unions but hasn't done it as yet--he\r\n     isn't quite sure they mean a square deal by the colored man,\r\n     although he can't see why they would ask him to join if they\r\n     didn't. Don't know much about the \"workings of 'em\" but they\r\n     pull together, sort of \"lodge like.\" He thinks everybody who\r\n     belongs is mighty \"close mouthed\" about what they do at the\r\n     meetings. He knows that they pay dues and have assessments, that\r\n     they look after sick members and have some sort of initiation.\r\n\r\n     J---- L----, fifty-two years old, is foreman over the truckers\r\n     in a box factory. He said: \"Unions ain't no good for a colored\r\n     man, I've seen too much of what they don't do for him. I\r\n     wouldn't join for nothing--wanted me to join one at the Yards\r\n     but I wouldn't; no protection; if they had been, the colored\r\n     men who belonged might have worked while the riot was going on;\r\n     only thing allowed out there then was foreigners. If a thing\r\n     can't help you when you need help, why have it? That's the way\r\n     I feel about unions. I tell you they don't mean nothing for me.\"\r\n\r\n     H---- S----, twenty-four years old, had lived in Chicago only\r\n     two months. He said: \"Well I don't know, you see these other\r\n     folks been here longer than me; they ain't joined, and I reckon\r\n     they know more about it than me. No, they didn't have no unions\r\n     where I comed from--ain't nothing there anyway but farmers.\r\n     I reckon, though, if I had a chance I might join. They can't\r\n     do much harm here to a fellow.\"\r\n\r\n     J---- H----, thirty-eight years old, came up from Alabama\r\n     in 1916 with about thirty other men during the big rush from\r\n     the South. They went to work almost immediately at the Stock\r\n     Yards, where he worked as a laborer, stripping bacon. After\r\n     he quit this he was out of work for nearly a month. He heard\r\n     about the wool mills. They put him on the very first day and\r\n     he has been there ever since.\r\n\r\n     He does not belong to a union. He \"would join one if I had a\r\n     chance and it meant anything to me materially.\" He does not\r\n     understand them, \"can't understand why they strike and keep\r\n     men out of work.\"\r\n\r\n     M---- L----, forty-two years old, came to Chicago from Tennessee\r\n     in 1894. He said: \"I tried every job under the sun since I\r\n     came. My first job was porter in the Palmer House; made good\r\n     tips here but not very much salary. Changed to bellboy; was\r\n     finally made head bellboy; stayed there four years; boss made\r\n     me mad and I quit. Along about this time I met my wife. I\r\n     wanted to make her think I was a regular man, so got a job as\r\n     a laborer in a foundry. Since then I've gone from one foundry\r\n     to the other. Work got so hard I quit one time; went on the\r\n     road; stayed there for about four years, then went back to the\r\n     foundry work; worked for Illinois Malleable for three years\r\n     first time; had trouble with straw boss; he fired me; went\r\n     to McCormick's but they didn't pay so well, so I got back on\r\n     my old job. Yes, unions are the best thing in the world for\r\n     a working man. If I'd been in a union my boss couldn't have\r\n     fired me that time. I wish it was so you could join a union\r\n     regardless of your color. We need protection on our jobs as\r\n     well as the white man. I guess though that time is coming. I\r\n     don't know much about the workings of a union, but I do know\r\n     it's a protection to the man who belongs.\"\r\n\r\n     F---- D----, twenty-eight years old, does not belong to a\r\n     union because there are no unions in the car shops where he\r\n     works. He says unions are the best things in the world if the\r\n     right kind of people are at the head, and if all the fellows\r\n     will join, but when half of them won't join, unionism won't\r\n     do because it just means loss of your job.\r\n\r\n     R---- R----, thirty-four years old, has been working in Chicago\r\n     three months at his regular trade as a stove joiner. He learned\r\n     to join stoves at a mill in Helena. He has never had a chance\r\n     to join a union, but all the white men in the mill at Helena\r\n     belonged, and they fared lots better than the Negro men. He\r\n     wants to join one here the very first chance he gets. He is\r\n     a skilled laborer, knows he can put out as much work as any\r\n     man doing his line of work, feels he should be paid as much\r\n     as anyone else, and knows the only way this can happen to him\r\n     is to get in a union where he has some protection and backers.\r\n     There is a union where he is, but he hasn't been asked to join\r\n     it yet. He says he has found out that the colored man, if he\r\n     wants the same thing as a white man gets, has to get in things\r\n     with them.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. N---- M---- found work as a maid in a Chicago hospital\r\n     after she was deserted by her husband. She wants to save money\r\n     enough to run her while she takes \"nurse training.\" She did\r\n     not know anything about unions until she went to the hospital.\r\n     The nurses there had a union, and she saw just how much they\r\n     can mean to people. \"They usually make the employers do the\r\n     right thing by the people; unless the nurses asked too much\r\n     they got what they wanted.\" That was what made her decide she\r\n     wanted to be a nurse; she saw how square they were with each\r\n     other, and how the union made them pull together regardless of\r\n     whether or not they liked each other. That is what she liked\r\n     about the unions: \"They make you treat the other fellow right\r\n     regardless how you feel toward him.\"\r\n\r\n     Nellie W----, age thirty, doing clerical work in a large\r\n     mail-order establishment, said that \"unions don't mean anything\r\n     to colored people. The only reason they let them in when they\r\n     do is so they can't become strike breakers.\" She didn't know\r\n     how her husband felt about unions, as they had never talked\r\n     about the matter, but she knew that she wouldn't join one.\r\n\r\n     O---- L----, thirty-eight years old, had migrated from Georgia\r\n     in the summer of 1917. To him unions are \"the best thing that\r\n     ever came the colored man's way. Out here [in a box factory]\r\n     it doesn't make quite so much difference whether I'm in one or\r\n     not, but if I ever go back to my trade as plasterer, that's\r\n     the first thing I intend to try and do. You get protection,\r\n     you get more money, and then too the white man gets a chance\r\n     to see that you are not all for yourself, for when you are in\r\n     a union you work for everybody's good.\"\r\n\r\n     H---- has been a head waiter in a hotel. He believes the big\r\n     reason why Negroes are not strongly enthusiastic for unions\r\n     is because they feel they will not get square treatment. This\r\n     he based upon continual references to the 1903 waiters' strike.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of indifference or suspicion so frequently encountered among\r\nNegro workers outside of the unions is attributed by white and Negro\r\nlabor leaders and union men to the following reasons: (_a_) traditional\r\ntreatment of Negroes by white men; (_b_) influence of racial leaders who\r\noppose unionism; and (_c_) influence of employers' propaganda against\r\nunionism.\r\n\r\nThe traditional treatment of Negroes in the South, increasingly reflected\r\nin the North, has made the Negro suspicious of the white man's sincerity.\r\nNegroes, therefore, naturally feel that they will not get a \"square deal\"\r\nin white unions. In support of this attitude the waiters' strike of 1903\r\nis still cited as an instance of \"double-crossing\" by white unions.\r\n\r\nThis strike was so often referred to by Negroes as a justification for\r\ntheir attitude toward labor-union policies that it seemed worth while\r\nto attempt to learn the facts, even though seventeen years had elapsed\r\nsince the strike occurred.\r\n\r\nTwo organizers for the American Federation of Labor, a newspaper editor,\r\nan officer of the Negro local during the strike, the head waiter of one\r\nof the large hotels (all Negroes), and John Fitzpatrick, president of\r\nthe Chicago Federation of Labor, were asked to tell the facts.\r\n\r\nReports are conflicting in many instances. However, the explanations of\r\ncircumstances as presented to the Commission are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe union of cooks and waiters involved in the strike of 1903, affiliated\r\nwith the American Federation of Labor, had a membership of 20,000, of\r\nwhom over 2,000 were Negroes. The Negroes had only recently been taken\r\ninto the union as a separate local under their own officers. The strike\r\nfirst centered on Kohlsaat's chain of restaurants. This lasted seven\r\nweeks, during which time all of the union members were out. The strike\r\nterminated in circumstances on which there is general disagreement.\r\nNegroes state that the white unionists \"double-crossed\" them, and when\r\nKohlsaat refused to take back the Negro waiters who had walked out with\r\nthe whites the latter went back to work and left the Negroes without\r\njobs. It is known that during the general excitement the charter of\r\nthe Negro local was revoked, although no one appears to know how or by\r\nwhom this was done. The white union leaders have frequently attempted\r\nto absolve the union of responsibility for this situation and place the\r\nblame on the Kohlsaat restaurants and the _Chicago Herald_, controlled\r\nby Kohlsaat. John Fitzpatrick, before the Commission, referred to the\r\nincident thus:\r\n\r\n     _Commissioner_: Concerning the waiters' strike several years\r\n     ago, the Kohlsaat strike, were they unionized under your\r\n     direction in order to raise the scale of dinner men [they were\r\n     known as dinner men] to the union scale? What was the success\r\n     of it as far as the colored waiters were concerned?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Fitzpatrick_: They weren't organized for financial\r\n     purposes. They were organized as workers. We felt they ought\r\n     to have our co-operation, so we went out to organize them. The\r\n     Kohlsaat newspaper was one of the instruments by which they\r\n     perpetrated the conspiracy, and some other papers went into\r\n     a scheme and tried to bring about an atmosphere of fear and\r\n     suspicion between the colored and white workers.\r\n\r\n     It was Sunday, and the charter of the colored workers was\r\n     in my possession. That night they met, and I was installing\r\n     officers at Twenty-third Street and Washington Avenue. That\r\n     morning the _Herald_ ran a front-page story, first column,\r\n     teeming with a set-up against organized labor and warning the\r\n     colored workers to beware.\r\n\r\n     When I got up on the platform I read the story to them and said,\r\n     \"That sets up one side of the story, and there is a conspiracy\r\n     to destroy your rights. What do you want to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n     They said, \"We will go ahead. We know what the employers want\r\n     and you go ahead and instal us.\" They went ahead and got into\r\n     that strike. The employers said: \"We are going to supplant\r\n     colored men with white union girls.\" We told them we wouldn't\r\n     permit union girls to go on the job. The Kohlsaats begged of\r\n     us to give them white union women, and we refused to do so.\r\n\r\n     Now then, while this was going on, the newspapers had different\r\n     reports out, and they went out and had the charter of this\r\n     local revoked. How they did it, I don't know. But I have my\r\n     own notions how a newspaper operates. I think that a newspaper\r\n     has influence and money and other things, and that is the\r\n     only way I can account for that thing happening. They went to\r\n     the international organization to revoke the charter of this\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\nThis whole situation was obscured by a mass of charges and\r\ncounter-charges, but the fact that the strike failed was evident enough.\r\nRegardless of what the facts actually were, there is a widespread belief\r\namong Negro workers that the colored waiters were \"double-crossed\" by\r\nwhite unions in this strike. Since it is men's belief about facts which\r\ndetermines behavior, it is not surprising to find that Negro strike\r\nbreakers could be found in large numbers to take the place of waiters\r\nwho went on strike in May, 1920.\r\n\r\nThe influence of some employers is also a factor in the attitude of\r\nNegroes toward labor unions. In many open shops the employers and unions\r\nare engaged in a continuous struggle. In such cases, if persuasion and\r\nargument fail, there is an effective instrument in strike breakers. For\r\nthis purpose Negroes have frequently been used. Instances in Chicago\r\nare found in the strikes in the steel industry, the Stock Yards, and\r\nthe culinary industry. Many labor leaders and union members believe\r\nthat welfare clubs, company Y.M.C.A.'s, glee clubs, and athletic clubs\r\nare encouraged and supported by employers as a substitute for a form\r\nof organization which they cannot control. The subsidizing of social\r\nmovements and churches is regarded as one of the means employed by large\r\nemployers to insure this reserve of strike breakers. The union organizer\r\nin the steel strike, W. Z. Foster, stated at one of the conferences held\r\nby the Commission that, after an address to the Negro steel workers at\r\na church in Pittsburgh, the Negro preacher had said to him: \"It nearly\r\nbroke up the congregation, but we decided you were going to speak here\r\nin this church.\" The organizer continued:\r\n\r\n     Then I got the underneath of all this thing and found that\r\n     this church had lost a donation of $2,500.00 from the Steel\r\n     Corporation for allowing me to speak. They had tried to block\r\n     my speech to these colored workers in Pittsburgh. Whenever\r\n     it's a question of a donation to a poor, struggling church\r\n     like that, we know what usually happens.\r\n\r\nThe statement made by George W. Perkins, president of the Cigarmakers'\r\nInternational Union, was typical of the view of labor leaders:\r\n\r\n     If you go to the root, you will find that economic reason; the\r\n     employers, not all of them but many of them, in our industry\r\n     as well as others, will divide the workers if they can. That\r\n     is the history all along. They will divide them, not because\r\n     they are black and white, but to keep them divided so they\r\n     won't unite in the organization.\r\n\r\nAnother labor leader, acting as an organizer in large industries in\r\nvarious cities, stated at another conference:\r\n\r\n     I want to tell you that a strike breaker is a very precious\r\n     animal for the employer, and if he thinks he has a great\r\n     body of colored workers in this country who are apt to learn\r\n     trades with very little practice, as an inexhaustible well of\r\n     strike breakers, he is not going to stop at a little thing\r\n     like propaganda. He will find plenty of excuses to keep men\r\n     out of the union. In the Stock Yards, in the steel industry,\r\n     he will find arguments and he will carry on propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties inherent in the whole question of organizing Negroes\r\nwere probably best brought out before the Commission by W. Z. Foster,\r\nwho took a leading part in organizing Negroes in the Stock Yards, the\r\nmost important industry in Chicago so far as Negroes are concerned:\r\n\r\n     We found in the steel industry that the colored worker was\r\n     very unresponsive to organization. The same was true in the\r\n     packing industry. Let me give you first what steps we took in\r\n     the packing industry in Chicago in 1917, the big campaign which\r\n     resulted in the organization of men. The first meeting we had\r\n     we sat around a table and talked it over, and we realized that\r\n     there were two big problems, the organization of the foreign\r\n     worker and the organization of the colored worker. We shortly\r\n     dismissed the problem of organizing the foreign worker, but\r\n     we realized that to accomplish the organization of the colored\r\n     worker was the real problem. When we went into the packing-house\r\n     situation we were determined to organize the colored worker\r\n     if it was humanly possible to do so, and I think I can safely\r\n     say that the men who carried on that campaign realized fully\r\n     the necessity for the organization of the colored worker, not\r\n     wholly, or at least not only, from the white man's point of\r\n     view, but from his own point of view to a certain extent. In\r\n     other words, we were not altogether materialistic. We like to\r\n     think that we were a little bit altruistic in the situation.\r\n     There was a total employment of twelve or fourteen thousand.\r\n     We found that we had tremendous opposition to encounter.\r\n\r\n     First of all it took this attitude, that the colored man\r\n     would not be allowed to join the unions at all. We met that\r\n     broadcast with such circulars as those already shown. I wrote\r\n     some of them up myself as secretary of the council, inviting\r\n     these men in such a way that these colored men could not help\r\n     but realize that there was nothing to this argument that they\r\n     would not be allowed to join the union.... The next argument\r\n     that developed was, \"Sure, the white man will take you into\r\n     his union because you are in the minority.\" But we fought all\r\n     of these arguments, and we organized a local union on State\r\n     Street.\r\n\r\n     Then the argument was raised that it was a \"Jim Crow\"\r\n     proposition. It was quite general along State Street that it\r\n     was a \"Jim Crow\" proposition. It seemed to make no difference\r\n     what move we made, there was always an argument against it,\r\n     so we overcame the \"Jim Crow\" argument by combining the white\r\n     locals and the black. We said to the boys: \"This is not a\r\n     colored local. This is a neighborhood local of miscellaneous\r\n     locals. Any colored man can belong to this local.\" We told the\r\n     white men: \"You are free to come in here and join this union.\"\r\n\r\n     Well, we punctured that argument that there was discrimination\r\n     in the Stock Yards, and I would challenge anyone to show where\r\n     the unions in the Stock Yards campaign have discriminated\r\n     against the colored man. There may have been isolated cases of\r\n     an individual here and there, but I will say this, and I was\r\n     on the organizing committee and probably in closer touch with\r\n     the situation than anyone else here in the city with those\r\n     four or five thousand colored workers that we organized, I\r\n     dare say that 40 per cent of the total amount of grievances\r\n     that were presented by all the workers in the Stock Yards came\r\n     from these colored workers, and the standing instructions were\r\n     to look after them very carefully....\r\n\r\n     But the more we tried to help the colored worker the more\r\n     intense the opposition was, because there was a force working\r\n     against us, and we could not help but feel it. We got it from\r\n     the colored people themselves, and it is a fact that some of\r\n     the organizers were actually afraid to go around to some of\r\n     these saloons and poolrooms where they congregated because of\r\n     the agents of the packers, or whoever was responsible for that\r\n     propaganda, and they felt that their lives were in danger....\r\n     Out in the Stock Yards we could not win their support. It could\r\n     not be done. They were constitutionally opposed to unions,\r\n     and all our forces could not break down that opposition....\r\n     We tried to make our appeal quite general in scope. We got\r\n     the best organizers. A good colored organizer is very rare--a\r\n     man who is thoroughly qualified to represent the trade-union\r\n     point of view. We tried to find one and picked out a colored\r\n     member of the Engineers' Union, a man highly honored in all\r\n     the trade unions of Chicago.... The reason the colored man\r\n     gave for not joining you will find in the circular \"Beware of\r\n     the White Man's Union,\" and that the only way that they can\r\n     ever make any headway in the industry is to stick in with the\r\n     boss and then when there is a strike to step in and take the\r\n     jobs that are left there....\r\n\r\n     Race prejudice has everything to do with it. It lies at the\r\n     bottom. The colored man as a blood race has been oppressed for\r\n     hundreds of years. The white man has enslaved him, and they\r\n     don't feel confidence in the trade unions. But there is more\r\n     real fraternal feeling among the black and white workers than\r\n     in any other grade of society.... As soon as the colored man\r\n     becomes a factor in industry, he is going to be organized,\r\n     providing he does not become a victim to the line of tactics\r\n     that are laid out by the employer. In the steel strike he\r\n     lined up with the bosses.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. NEGRO WORKERS WITHIN THE UNIONS\r\n\r\nNegro workers inside the ranks of such unions as the Stock Yards',\r\nJanitors', and Hodcarriers', types of the unions which accept Negroes\r\nwith complete equality, feel, with very few exceptions, that they are\r\nbeing given a \"square deal\" by the unions. By coming into the unions\r\nthey say they have been able to secure better working conditions and\r\nhigher wages. They express satisfaction with the treatment accorded them\r\nby white unionists on the job and at meetings, where the grievances of\r\nNegro members are given the same attention as the complaints of white\r\nmembers. The situation in the unions mentioned has been so fully described\r\nalready in this report that there is no need for further details on the\r\nfriendly relationship which exists between white and colored members of\r\nthese unions. Many Negro unionists look to labor organization as one of\r\nthe most promising solutions of race problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE NEGRO AND STRIKES\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Negro workers during strikes is closely connected with\r\nthe attitude of Negroes toward union organization. As stated before,\r\nthere are many cross-currents at work, some tending to keep Negroes out\r\nof unions and others impelling them toward the unions. All the forces\r\nat work to prejudice the Negro against union organization are factors\r\nwhich help to explain his willingness to take the place of striking white\r\nworkers. The loyalty of the Negro during strikes by white employees\r\nwas referred to by a number of the representatives of large employers\r\nattending the industrial conferences held by the Commission.\r\n\r\nSome of the most conspicuous cases coming to the attention of the\r\nCommission in which Negroes have taken the place of white strikers or\r\nhave remained at work during strikes are the following:\r\n\r\n     The Stock Yards strike of 1904 lasted from July 4 to the middle\r\n     of September. The general superintendent of one of the plants in\r\n     the Yards, appearing before the Commission, said: \"The strike\r\n     was called at 12:00 o'clock. Every employee practically that\r\n     we had went out. Within two or three days we had any number\r\n     of colored employees return to work.... I'd say Negroes helped\r\n     us to break the strike by coming to work. A number of Negroes\r\n     that we understand belonged to the union did not remain out\r\n     more than two or three days. Practically all the Negroes came\r\n     back before the strike was called off.\"\r\n\r\n     The strike in the Corn Products Refining Company plant at Argo,\r\n     where, in the summer of 1919, before the strike, 300 Negroes\r\n     were employed, during the strike 900, and when it was over\r\n     about 500.\r\n\r\n     The steel strike of 1919. Representatives of several of the\r\n     iron and steel plants stated that Negroes had helped to break\r\n     this strike. The _Inter-Church World Movement Report on the\r\n     Steel Strike of 1919_ (p. 177) lists the \"successful use of\r\n     strike-breakers, principally Negroes, by the steel companies\" as\r\n     the second cause of the failure of the steel strike. \"'Niggers\r\n     did it' was a not uncommon remark among company officials.\"\r\n\r\n     The waiters' strike in 1920.\r\n\r\nLess important cases were the following:\r\n\r\n     A clothing shop where Negro women broke a strike in 1916\r\n     and continued in the employ thereafter. A wool warehouse and\r\n     storage company which used Negroes at slightly higher wages\r\n     to replace striking Polish laborers in 1916, and have since\r\n     continued to employ Negroes.\r\n\r\n     The strike of Pullman-car cleaners about 1916. Negroes were\r\n     used as strike breakers and have since been employed in large\r\n     numbers, men cleaning the windows and outside of cars and\r\n     Negro women doing most of the inside cleaning.\r\n\r\n     Many other instances where Negroes have been used as strike\r\n     breakers could be cited.\r\n\r\nDuring a strike, feeling runs high and the word \"strike breaker\" or\r\n\"scab\" carries with it a decided stigma among the strikers. White workers\r\nordinarily do not try to understand why the Negro acts as he does. They\r\ndo not reason that the Negro is often loyal to the employer because he\r\nfeels that the employer, sometimes at considerable risk, has opened to\r\nhim industrial opportunities which, translated into wages, mean better\r\nliving conditions for himself and his family. If the white worker took\r\ninto account the struggle of the Negro to gain entrance into the fields\r\noutside of personal service, the latter's eagerness to take advantage\r\nof any opening, however created, might be better understood and regarded\r\nwith more tolerant spirit.\r\n\r\nWhat bearing this use of Negro labor has on the attitude of white workers\r\ntoward Negroes depends upon whether the subject is approached from the\r\npoint of view of the employer or of the trade unionist. Representatives\r\nof the packing companies emphasized the employers' appreciation of the\r\nNegro's loyalty and discounted the antagonism caused by Negroes serving\r\nas strike breakers, while trade-union leaders and others having the\r\nworkers' point of view emphasized the seeds of dissension that were sown\r\nby such action and contended that the good will of the employer gained\r\nat such a cost was in reality a handicap to the Negro. White workers\r\nfeel that Negroes who serve as strike breakers are helping to earn for\r\ntheir race the stigma of being a \"scab\" race. This is especially serious\r\nin the case of Negroes, because color identification makes it easy to\r\nfocus hatred for the \"scab.\"\r\n\r\nUnion leaders and social workers who participated in the conferences\r\nheld by the Commission condemned the practice of some private employment\r\nagencies in sending Negroes to plants as strike breakers without informing\r\nthem that a strike was in progress. Investigations in several states\r\nhave disclosed such practices of some private employment agencies,\r\n\"misrepresentation of terms and conditions of employment\" being the\r\nmost frequent abuse, according to the report of the Federal Commission\r\non Industrial Relations: \"Men are not informed about strikes that may\r\nbe on at places to which they are sent, nor about other important facts\r\nwhich they ought to know.\"[77]\r\n\r\nPrivate employment agencies following such practices try to do so against\r\ncolored as well as white workers, although with probably less success\r\nbecause of the ability of the Negro to speak English. However, the part\r\nplayed by private employment agencies in supplying Negro strike breakers\r\nin Chicago appears to be of relatively little importance. Ordinarily\r\nagents of employers find Negro strike breakers directly by going into the\r\nNegro residence section with autos or trucks and recruiting the number\r\nof men desired. The industrial secretary of the Urban League made the\r\nfollowing statement regarding Negro strike breakers:\r\n\r\n     According to all information available to the Chicago Urban\r\n     League, it does not appear that any of the private employment\r\n     agencies except the one conducted by R. G. Parker, editor of\r\n     the _Chicago Advocate_, who advertised for cooks and waiters\r\n     to break the strike of the Cooks and Waiters' Alliance during\r\n     the National Republican Convention in June, 1920, have been\r\n     instrumental in strike breaking.\r\n\r\n     The method used in the organization of strike breakers among\r\n     colored people is not well defined. Generally labor scouts\r\n     work directly for companies affected by strikes. These scouts\r\n     have frequently applied to our office for workers, but we\r\n     have refused assistance. The men are usually gathered from the\r\n     streets, poolrooms, or wherever they can be found. It is the\r\n     policy of the Chicago Urban League not to interfere in strikes\r\n     unless the striking unions have refused to admit colored workers\r\n     to their membership. The League is not opposed to unionism,\r\n     but is interested primarily in the welfare of colored workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. ATTITUDE AND OPINIONS OF LABOR LEADERS\r\n\r\nFrom the eleven representative labor leaders attending the trade-union\r\nconferences held by the Commission, from the various interviews by the\r\ninvestigators with these and other union officials and members, and from\r\nletters received from labor officials from various parts of the United\r\nStates, it was apparent that there were certain definite views held by\r\nmost of these leaders as to the relationship of organized labor to the\r\nNegro. These views are summarized and set forth in the following pages:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GENERAL PUBLIC HAS RACE PREJUDICE\r\n\r\nRace prejudice exists generally in all groups of the white race and\r\nonly changes slowly. The worker is just as much subject to it in the\r\nbeginning as are the members of all other groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. UNIONS FAIRER TO NEGRO THAN ARE OTHER GROUPS\r\n\r\nThe unions have given the Negro a fairer deal than other social\r\ninstitutions or groups, such as department stores, clubs, churches,\r\ntheaters, fraternal organizations, hotels, and railways.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. UNIONS BLAMED FOR CONDITIONS THEY CANNOT CONTROL\r\n\r\nUnions are many times blamed for situations in which Negroes are not\r\nadmitted to an occupation or industry over which the unions have no\r\ncontrol, the exclusion existing because the attitude of either the public\r\nor the employer prevents the entrance of Negroes into the industry. For\r\nexample, Negroes are not employed in Chicago as motormen or conductors on\r\nsurface or elevated transportation lines, as telephone operators by the\r\ntelephone company, as sales clerks in department stores, as chauffeurs\r\nby taxicab companies, nor as upholsterers and drapers by firms sending\r\nsuch employees to work in private homes.\r\n\r\nThe position taken by the unions is that they cannot organize a\r\nmiscellaneous public, but that they can only organize those that have the\r\njobs, that as long as street and elevated lines do not employ Negroes\r\nas motormen and conductors the unions cannot take them in. True, there\r\nmight be objection on the part of the members in these unions, but\r\nthe question has never come up. Also the traction companies are not\r\nin business to reform public opinion and so, because the public might\r\nobject, do not engage Negroes in these jobs. In this their position is\r\nsimilar to that of the large taxicab companies, which, however, employ\r\nnon-union workers. They have Negroes in the garages but not as chauffeurs,\r\nprobably because they believe that the general public would object if\r\nNegroes were employed as chauffeurs. In such cases the unions feel that\r\nthey are not responsible, any more than they are accountable for the\r\npolicy of the telephone company which engages no Negro operators. Among\r\nother large businesses must be listed the department stores, which have\r\nno Negroes as sales clerks.\r\n\r\nExclusion of Negroes from a trade or industry results in inability to\r\njoin the unions in such trades. This fact is well illustrated by the\r\nUpholsterers' Union, which has three branches--furniture upholsterers,\r\ndrapers, and mattress makers. Upholsterers and drapers are frequently\r\nsent out by the large stores to residences of customers, and the stores\r\nwill not risk offending customers by sending a Negro into their homes.\r\nConsequently there are no Negroes in these branches of the union. The\r\nmattress makers' local, on the other hand, has more Negro than white\r\nmembers, and the secretary of the union is a Negro. This situation would\r\nnot be possible if Negroes were excluded from employment in mattress\r\nfactories. In view of the fact that the Upholsterers' Union freely\r\nadmits Negroes into the mattress makers' local, Negroes would also, no\r\ndoubt, be admitted into the locals of the upholsterers and the drapers\r\nif employers hired Negroes for such work.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. EXCLUSION POLICY CONDEMNED\r\n\r\nThe policy, wherever it exists, of excluding Negroes from unions, whether\r\nby direct or indirect means, is considered wrong and shortsighted by\r\nthe great majority of labor leaders. They believe that the small group\r\nof \"aristocratic and conservative\" unions cannot long withstand the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor policy of organizing Negroes in local and\r\nfederal unions, nor the policy of the more progressive national and\r\ninternational unions. As the number of Negroes increases in the unions\r\nnow admitting them, as the number of Negro delegates to city centrals,\r\nlike the Chicago Federation of Labor, increases, and as the number of\r\ndelegates to conventions of the State Federation of Labor and to the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor increases each year, more and more pressure\r\nis being brought to bear on these unions from without and also by the\r\nprogressive leaders from within, so that gradually all barriers will\r\nbe swept aside. That a gradual change is taking place in the policy of\r\nmany unions is evidenced by the following instances:\r\n\r\n_International Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers._--\"In 1902 a local\r\nunion of Negro stationary firemen in Chicago could not be chartered\r\nbecause the white local union would not give its consent.\"[78] In 1920\r\nthe president of Local 7, Chicago, reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     The symbol of our organization is, \"We shall not discriminate\r\n     against creed, color or nationality.\" The membership of our\r\n     organization is open to the Negro as much as to any other\r\n     man who earns his living by the sweat of his brow. I should\r\n     say, offhand, that we have approximately about 100 Negroes\r\n     who are members of our Chicago local and who take an active\r\n     part in all of our deliberations. So far as has come under my\r\n     observation the feeling towards these men has always been of\r\n     the most cordial nature.\r\n\r\n     I am, however, free to say that we have found that a great many\r\n     of the employers, who do not desire to play fair, use the Negro\r\n     to offset any high standard of wages which the organization\r\n     may deem proper and just, and I have found, in my experience,\r\n     an endeavor on the part of some of the employers to only use\r\n     the Negro when he would want to maintain a lower standard of\r\n     wages, but when compelled by force of circumstances to pay a\r\n     living rate of wages, immediately a request would be made on\r\n     the organization that the Negro be removed and a white man\r\n     furnished. This we emphatically refuse to do. If the Negro\r\n     was efficient and competent to perform his duties prior to\r\n     the establishment of a living wage he certainly should be\r\n     competent enough to perform the same duties afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Metal Polishers' International Union._--The general secretary informed\r\nthe Commission:\r\n\r\n     At the last international convention held, the question of\r\n     Negroes entering our trade was taken up, and the delegates\r\n     anticipated that, at some future time, Negroes would be\r\n     employed, and we felt that, if the manufacturers were left under\r\n     the impression that we would refuse to accept them into the\r\n     organization, it would be an incentive to the Manufacturers'\r\n     Association to import Negroes or hire them, so a resolution\r\n     was passed that any skilled polisher, buffer, or plater, even\r\n     though a Negro, should be admitted to our organization.\r\n\r\n_International Association of Machinists._--Although at its convention\r\nat Rochester, New York, in 1920, this union again voted down the\r\nproposition to strike out the word \"white\" from its ritual, there was\r\nsignificance in the fact that seven resolutions were introduced at the\r\nconvention to remove the excluding provision. These resolutions came from\r\nunions in the following cities: two from different locals in Chicago;\r\none from Columbia, South Carolina; one from Akron, Ohio; one from New\r\nHaven, Connecticut; one from Tucson, Arizona. Resolutions opposing came\r\nfrom Bakersfield, California; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Whistler, Alabama;\r\nand Savannah, Georgia. As an instance of enthusiastic appreciation of\r\nthe mutual advantage to whites and Negroes of joint effort in union\r\norganization with no discrimination the following comment from an office\r\nof the Hotel and Restaurant Employees' National Alliance was received\r\nby the Commission:\r\n\r\n     We have one local union composed of white and colored\r\n     workers--that union is located in the city of Boston,\r\n     Massachusetts; roughly speaking, there are approximately 400\r\n     in a total membership of about 2,000; at our convention held\r\n     at Providence, Rhode Island, last August, one of the delegates\r\n     from that union was a colored man. Six years ago Boston colored\r\n     waiters woke up, and so did the whites, to the fact that for\r\n     decades they had been used one against the other by their\r\n     employers; they got together, and they affirm with considerable\r\n     emphasis that amalgamation has proved beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. UNIONS INSTRUMENTAL IN REMOVING RACE PREJUDICE\r\n\r\nLabor leaders emphasize the influence of contact in union meetings in\r\npromoting a friendly understanding between white and colored members.\r\nThey point out the fact that the Negro ceases to be a stranger or an\r\nobject of prejudice when once he has identified himself with the union.\r\nA common interest in common problems binds the members together, and\r\na spirit of loyalty to the union develops in the effort to realize the\r\naims of the group. White members come to have a more kindly feeling for\r\na Negro within the union group than they have toward a white man who\r\nremains outside the union ranks. Said one union leader:\r\n\r\n     Some day the white worker is going to coax the black man to\r\n     line up with him; all that he needs is a crusader's heart\r\n     and a genuine desire to make the black man and himself free,\r\n     and when he succeeds there won't be, in the economic field at\r\n     least, the differences which now exist, due to this pitting\r\n     of one race against the other and both being walloped by the\r\n     action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPUBLIC OPINION IN RACE RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Negro in the United States: \"A person of African blood (much\r\n     or little) about whom men of English descent tell only half the\r\n     truth, and because of whom they do not act with frankness and\r\n     sanity either toward the Negro or to one another--in a word,\r\n     about whom they easily lose their common sense, their usual\r\n     good judgment, and even their powers of accurate observation.\r\n     The Negro-in-America, therefore, is a form of insanity that\r\n     overtakes white men.\"--_The Southerner_ by Walter Hines Page.\r\n\r\nThe Stoic proverb, that \"men are tormented by the opinions they have\r\nof things rather than by the things themselves,\"[79] applies as aptly\r\nto the relations between the white and Negro populations as to other of\r\nour problems. Because the \"race problem\" has been so vaguely stated, so\r\nvariously explained, and so little understood, discussions of it and the\r\nconduct of whites and Negroes toward each other usually express feeling\r\nrather than intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe public is guided by patterns of behavior and traditions generally\r\naccepted, whether sound or unsound. False notions, if believed, may\r\ncontrol conduct as effectively as true ones. And pre-established notions\r\nlose their subtle influence when it appears that their basis is in error.\r\n\r\nWhite persons are generally uninformed on matters affecting Negroes\r\nand race relations. They are forced to rely on partial and frequently\r\ninaccurate information and upon traditional sentiments. This same\r\nignorance applies to Negroes, though not to the same degree; for they\r\nknow white people in their intimate personal and home relations and in\r\nconnection with their work in factories and stores. They read their books\r\nand papers and often hear their discussions. Negroes are perhaps more race\r\nconscious than whites because every day they must face situations which\r\nremind them of their race. They are sensitive to moods and antagonisms\r\nexpressed in words and shown in manners. Their impressions from the white\r\ngroup are subject to distortion as are those received by the whites from\r\nthem. Negroes manifest characteristics which, though the natural result\r\nof their circumstances and experiences, are yet misunderstood and often\r\nresented by the white group. For Negroes live and think in a state of\r\nisolation which is almost complete; and no white group understands it,\r\nor can fully understand it.\r\n\r\nThe riot of 1919 is an example of the effects of this isolation and\r\nmisunderstanding. The accumulated resentments, unchallenged mutual\r\nbeliefs and resultant friction, culminated in a surprising calamity and\r\nwholesale bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThis chapter, therefore, has a thesis and a purpose. If these beliefs,\r\nprejudices and faulty deductions can be made accessible for examination\r\nand analysis, many of them will be corrected. If a self-critical\r\nattitude toward these prejudices can be stimulated by typical examples,\r\na considerable step will have been taken toward understanding and harmony.\r\n\r\nThe study of public opinion in race relations attempted by the Commission\r\ndoes not presume to set down definite laws of its working, or to tell all\r\nabout how it works. The aim is merely to make apparent and objective its\r\nplace and importance in race relations, to indicate some of the ways in\r\nwhich it has developed; how it expresses itself, how it affects both the\r\nwhite and Negro groups; how, in its present state, it is strengthened,\r\nweakened, polluted, or purified by deliberate agencies or even by its\r\nown action, and finally how it may be used to reduce, if not to prevent,\r\nracial unfriendliness and misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe following plan is employed in presenting this branch of the subject:\r\n\r\n1. Beliefs regarding Negroes, which greatly influence the conduct of\r\nwhite persons toward them, are described as they apply in the local\r\nenvironment, and their origin and background are traced suggestively to\r\ntheir responsible literature and circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. Types of sentiment which are variants of these basic beliefs are\r\npresented with a view to making them intelligible, and to classifying\r\nthem according to resolvable factors of misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n3. Since personal attitudes and beliefs are molded by traditions and\r\nheritages apart from the exclusive influence of literature, material\r\ncollected through intimate inquiry is presented objectively to describe\r\nthe processes by which they appear to be created and to grow. Replies to\r\na searching questionnaire on attitudes and opinions express the result\r\nof painstaking self-analysis.\r\n\r\n4. Negro opinion on these same issues is described and illustrated with\r\na view to making it intelligible. Their views are listed and their\r\ninterpretations of current white sentiment are explained as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n5. From the subjective aspect the study then turns to the instruments\r\nby which these opinions are formed and perpetuated and the individual\r\nattitudes created. The following are deemed the chief agencies: (_a_)\r\nthe press, (_b_) rumors, (_c_) myths, (_d_) propaganda. Conscious and\r\nunconscious abuse of these instruments of opinion-making is pointed out\r\nand explained.\r\n\r\n6. Finally, means are suggested by which public opinion may, where it is\r\nfaulty, correct itself, and employ its own instruments in the creation\r\nof wholesome sentiments among Negroes with respect to whites, and among\r\nwhites with respect to Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. OPINIONS OF WHITES AND NEGROES\r\n\r\n\r\nI. BELIEFS CONCERNING NEGROES\r\n\r\nLiterature concerning Negroes has been written chiefly by southern\r\nstudents facing the problem in its most intense form and usually meeting\r\nthe most backward of Negroes. Negro habits have been objectively explained\r\nand standards of judgment upon the entire group have usually been deduced\r\ntherefrom. This constitutes the bulk of serious literature on the subject\r\nof the Negro; it is generally used in research into the problem.\r\n\r\nIn the North as in the South the assumptions regarding the Negro have\r\ntheir basis in similar sources. The beliefs, in general, are the same,\r\nthough held by individuals in varying degrees. Though northerners do not\r\nbelieve so firmly and with such emotional intensity all that southerners\r\nbelieve about Negroes, yet they share these beliefs in proportion as\r\nthey have been influenced or informed by southerners. It may happen,\r\nfor example, that in a small northern town with but a handful of Negroes\r\nthere is no discernible distinction in the treatment accorded them. The\r\ngrowth of the colony, however, can bring to the surface at first almost\r\nundiscernible shades of the usual beliefs, and finally the identical\r\nbeliefs entertained by other communities.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, no section of the country in which it is not\r\ngenerally believed by whites that Negroes are instinctively criminal in\r\ninclination. Some believe that they are criminal by nature and explain it\r\nas a result of heredity; some feel that it is a combination of heredity\r\nand environment; while others may feel that this inclination is due to\r\nenvironment alone. How, indeed, may the belief be avoided? Crime figures\r\non Negroes are consistently unfavorable to any other conclusion. Students\r\nhave gone so far as to accept without question these figures and proceed\r\nto explain that criminal tendency scientifically. This is also true as\r\nto low mentality, sexual immorality, and a long list of other supposed\r\nracial defects.\r\n\r\nBelow are presented some of the more important beliefs among whites about\r\nNegroes that have become crystallized by years of unchallenged assumption.\r\nThey divide themselves into two general classes: (1) Primary beliefs, or\r\nfundamental and firmly established convictions which have, all around,\r\nthe deepest effect on the attitude of whites toward Negroes. These are\r\nusually presented as revealed by statistics, authorities, and research.\r\n(2) Secondary beliefs, or the lighter modifications and variants of the\r\nsupposed attributes of Negroes included in the more important assumptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PRIMARY BELIEFS\r\n\r\n_Mentality._--The chief of these is that the mind of the Negro is\r\ndistinctly and distinctively inferior to that of the white race, and so\r\nare all resulting functionings of his mind.\r\n\r\nThis view is held by some to be due to a difference in species, by\r\nothers to more recent emergence from primitive life, and by others to\r\nbe due to backwardness in ascending the scale of civilization. For this\r\nreason it is variously assumed as a corollary that the mind of the Negro\r\ncannot be improved above a given level or beyond a given age; that his\r\neducation should be adapted to his capacities, that is, he should mainly\r\nbe taught to use his hands. Thus a teacher in one of the elementary\r\nschools of Chicago finds that \"colored children are restive and incapable\r\nof abstract thought; they must be constantly fed with novel interests\r\nand given things to do with their hands.\" Accordingly they are given\r\nhandicraft instead of arithmetic, and singing instead of grammar.\r\n\r\nIn seeking the opinion of white trades unionists on the admission of\r\nNegroes to unions in Chicago, the Commission encountered in perhaps\r\nthe harshest form the conviction that Negroes were inherently unable to\r\nperform tasks that white men did as a matter of course. A member of the\r\nBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers felt that no Negro had, or could\r\never acquire, intelligence enough to run an engine. Employers frequently\r\nexpressed the belief that Negroes are incapable of performing tasks\r\nwhich require sustained mental application. This view of their mental\r\nweakness appeared in the following statement made before the Commission\r\nby a school principal concerning her experience with Negro children:\r\n\r\n     So far as books are concerned there are set types of learning\r\n     which they take with great difficulty. Last Friday a colored boy\r\n     came to me and said, \"I want to go back to the first grade.\" We\r\n     have gotten him in the third grade. He came to me and cried--a\r\n     great big boy--because he said the work was much too hard for\r\n     him, and he didn't want to study. His teacher was cross with\r\n     him and insisted he must get to work. It is an exception to\r\n     have a boy so frank. But I don't think the instance is far\r\n     from the truth. I have never had a white child complain that\r\n     he was graded too high and wanted to be put down. Sometimes\r\n     when they come in, they say to me: \"I went to school in the\r\n     South, and I am in high fifth grade.\" \"How long were you in\r\n     school in the South?\" \"Three sessions.\" Two months, and they\r\n     are in high fifth grade! I put them into the first or second\r\n     grade. Sometimes I can't fit them into the smaller grades, and\r\n     sometimes they resent it, but when they get into the actual\r\n     school work and find they can't do it, they can't complain. I\r\n     should say therefore that there is a certain amount of mental\r\n     backwardness found in colored children not found in whites.\r\n\r\nA teacher in a Chicago public school said: \"I believe like Dr. Bruner\r\n[director of Special School, Board of Education] that when a Negro boy\r\ngrows a mustache his brain stops working.\"\r\n\r\nA teacher in Moseley School said: \"The great physical development of\r\nthe colored person takes away from the mental, while with the whites\r\nthe reverse is true. There is proof for this in the last chapter of\r\nEcclesiastes.\"\r\n\r\n_Morality._--Another of these primary beliefs is that Negroes are not\r\nyet capable of exercising the social restraints which are common to the\r\nmore civilized white persons. Sometimes it is said that they are unmoral\r\nrather than immoral. This view, while charitably explaining supposed\r\ninnate defects of character, places them outside the circle of normal\r\nmembers of society. Thus the assistant principal of a Chicago high school\r\nattended by Negroes said:\r\n\r\n     When it comes to morality, I say colored children are unmoral.\r\n     They have no more moral sense than a very young white child.\r\n     Along sex lines they don't know that this is wrong and that\r\n     is wrong--that wrong sense isn't a part of them. Of course we\r\n     say they are immoral and a white child doing the same thing\r\n     under the same circumstances would be. The colored and white\r\n     children here don't get mixed up in immorality; they are too\r\n     well segregated. Not that we segregate them: the whites keep\r\n     away from the colored.\r\n\r\nThis belief appears in statements that there is no family life among\r\nNegroes and but little respect, even in Chicago, for the ordinary\r\ndecencies; when serious students of society speak of the promiscuity\r\nof colored women and men in sexual as well as social relations; and\r\nwhen social institutions assume the impossibility of locating the real\r\nfather of children in a Negro family. Much public emphasis is given to\r\nthe subject of venereal disease among Negroes, and certain deductions\r\nregarding this incidence of disease have resulted from comparative\r\nstatistics.\r\n\r\n_Criminality._--The assumption back of most discussions of Negro crime\r\nis that there is a constitutional character weakness in Negroes and a\r\nconsequent predisposition to sexual crimes, petty stealing, and crimes of\r\nviolence. Sexual crimes are alleged and frequently urged in justification\r\nof lynching. Popular judgment takes stealing lightly, because Negroes\r\nevidence a marked immaturity and childishness in it. It is supposed that\r\nthey appropriate little things and do not commit larger thefts. Crimes\r\nof violence are thought to be characteristic of Negroes because crimes\r\ninvolving deliberation and planning require more brains than Negroes\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe president of a branch of the Illinois Federation of Women's Clubs\r\nthus explained the decision of that organization not to discuss the\r\nNegro question in its meetings:\r\n\r\n     Most of the presidents expressed themselves as against\r\n     discussion of the Negro question because as women's names\r\n     come out as being against the Negroes these women and others\r\n     of the club would have to live in fear of Negro men. A woman\r\n     must be careful not to put herself in a position of causing\r\n     them to have a grudge against her, as you know a white woman\r\n     has to fear a colored man.\r\n\r\nA resident in an exclusively white residential district said:\r\n\r\n     Mother, sister, and I lived here alone and we had a car which\r\n     we kept in a garage in the back yard. Whenever we came in\r\n     at night we never used the back door, but always went around\r\n     front. Several times in walking up the back steps to the porch\r\n     we had been frightened by colored men sitting on the steps or\r\n     lying on the porch, and so we couldn't use that way into the\r\n     house.\r\n\r\nAnother white woman, in the course of a discussion of housing indicated\r\nthis fear of Negro men:\r\n\r\n     When we came here this was a nice neighborhood. After some\r\n     years a colored family moved in, then two or three more, and\r\n     more and more, until you see what we have here now. I tell\r\n     you the white people right on this street have to be afraid\r\n     for their lives.\r\n\r\nAnother, living on Langley Avenue, near Forty-third Street, said:\r\n\r\n     I don't hold any conversations with Negroes. It's better to be\r\n     on the safe side when you've got grown-up daughters. I worry\r\n     a good deal about my two daughters as they go and come from\r\n     work, but they've never had anything happen.\r\n\r\nThe principal of a Chicago public school was questioned by a visitor\r\nconcerning the attitude of white parents toward the association of\r\ntheir children with Negro pupils in that school. \"The white parents\r\nare cautious about stirring up trouble,\" he said, \"for they know the\r\nemotional tendency of the colored to knife and kill.\"\r\n\r\nPetty thefts by Negroes, especially of food, are regarded as annoying\r\nevils most easily dealt with by a sort of half-serious firmness. A white\r\nresident of a district largely inhabited by Negroes said:\r\n\r\n     A white neighbor keeps chickens in her back yard. She gets the\r\n     burglar alarm from the hen house sometimes twice in a week,\r\n     and the running thief is always colored.... The colored buy\r\n     whatever they want; they'll spend their last cent and not\r\n     worry about the next day. If they want a chicken for dinner\r\n     and it's $1 a pound, they buy it or steal it.\r\n\r\n_Physical unattractiveness._--Objections to contact are often attributed\r\nto physical laws which, it is said, make the sight or other sensory\r\nimpression of the Negro unbearably repulsive. This attitude is found in\r\nprotests against indiscriminate seating arrangements in street cars.\r\nThe word \"black\" has long been associated with evil and ugliness, and\r\nit is not always a simple task to disassociate the idea from impressions\r\ngiven by a black man. Not merely is the color regarded as repulsive, but\r\nit is the further belief that Negroes have a peculiar and disagreeable\r\nbody odor. A Christian Science practitioner in Chicago, giving her\r\nopinion of Negroes, had an idea that they carried a \"musky odor,\" and\r\nwere therefore to be avoided. A student at the University of Chicago\r\nand a resident of Hyde Park, talking with an investigator, said: \"It is\r\nconceded that the Negro in Chicago must have some place to live, but to\r\npermit promiscuous distribution through scattered sections of the city\r\nwould tend to increase the difficulties rather than mitigate them, partly\r\nbecause a white man would shrink from having a Negro live near him.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1919 there appeared in one of the Chicago daily papers\r\na series of articles on the Negro question. In describing the relations\r\nbetween Negroes and whites in Chicago, the writer said:\r\n\r\n     A second phase of the situation, and the one that causes more\r\n     inutile railing than any other, is the crowding into the street\r\n     cars of colored people. Well, they must ride on street cars,\r\n     if only for the reason that most of them live remote from\r\n     their work. Even the North State Street line, that used to be\r\n     considered the special conveyance for \"the quality,\" has come\r\n     to be known as the \"African Central.\" If you can't stomach\r\n     it, you'll have to walk. They won't.\r\n\r\nLiving in neighborhoods infrequently visited by Negroes and where, as\r\na general rule, their occupancy is effectively discouraged, some white\r\nresidents occasionally express objections as based on a \"natural physical\r\nopposition.\" Following is a typical statement:\r\n\r\n     I came here six years ago and there was a very noisy set of\r\n     white people living in the apartment house back of mine. Four\r\n     years ago the landlord put them all out and rented to colored\r\n     families. We were all up in arms then; but say, I never had\r\n     nicer, more quiet, and respectable neighbors. Their children\r\n     all behave well, and we can't kick. But at the same time, black\r\n     people aren't what one would pick out to have around--I guess\r\n     it's just because they are black.\r\n\r\n_Emotionality._--This is commonly regarded as explaining features of\r\nconduct in Negroes, some of which are beautiful in their expression while\r\nothers are ugly and dangerous. The supposed Negro gift of song is thus\r\nan accepted attribute of his emotional nature. So with his religious\r\ninclination. This same emotionalism is believed to lead him to drink\r\nand is frequently made to account for \"his quick, uncalculated crimes of\r\nviolence.\" The natural expression of Negro religious fervor is supposed\r\nto be noisy and frenzied. This view of the _Chicago Tribune's_ special\r\nwriter is, roughly speaking, the view of thousands of Chicagoans:\r\n\r\n     I passed grand old stone churches, once the pride of rich and\r\n     powerful white congregations, whither I used to be sent as a\r\n     reporter not so many years ago, to hear some of the premier\r\n     pulpiteers of this town. They are colored people's churches\r\n     now, and beneath the arches, where a sedate gospel once was\r\n     expounded you hear today the jubilant yell of the dusky brother\r\n     who has found grace....\r\n\r\n     The service was, indeed, an incident in a three weeks' series\r\n     of revival meetings they have been holding at Olivet. The\r\n     principal performer was the Rev. S. E. J. Watson, a revivalist\r\n     from Topeka, a big man--mulatto, I should say, or perhaps\r\n     quadroon--with a powerful voice, a masterly platform style,\r\n     and enormous ardor. He spoke fluently, used no notes, and\r\n     demonstrated a free, wide skill in homely imagery, which,\r\n     however, included no slang nor vulgarities, but was racy\r\n     of the plantation and the cabin kitchen. His picture of God\r\n     \"opening the front door of this good old world every morning\r\n     to let in the sun\" was one of the most gorgeous flights in\r\n     primitive poetry I ever heard, and his narrative, accompanied\r\n     by the most vivid pantomime, of the Roman soldiers lifting up\r\n     the cross after they had nailed Jesus to it was hardly less\r\n     than terrifying--it certainly was terrific--in its sweep of\r\n     passion and its reality of detail.\r\n\r\n     And so he wrought them to a high emotional state. Many were\r\n     crying. Then came the direct personal appeal to \"the unsaved,\"\r\n     the threat of the everlasting fire, and the \"lifting up\" again\r\n     and again of the thought of the all-forgiving, all-saving Jesus.\r\n     The soft crying became heavy, convulsive sobbing. One by one\r\n     the unsaved who made the surrender to whatever it was that had\r\n     been holding them back, were led to the seats near the pulpit.\r\n     Those who did not surrender promptly were evidently in terrible\r\n     stress, or thought they were. They emitted shrieks that, truly,\r\n     made my heart stand still, and I would have trembled for the\r\n     sanity of the poor creatures except that I observed from the\r\n     corner of my eye that the \"saved\" in the assemblage took the\r\n     shrieks with perfect equanimity.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SECONDARY BELIEFS\r\n\r\nIn addition to the primary beliefs there are others supposedly not so\r\nserious or significant in their effects. These are usually modifications\r\nof primary beliefs, and are accepted as a consequence of frequent and\r\nalmost unvaried repetition. In this manner these secondary beliefs have\r\nedged their way into the popular mind.\r\n\r\nGeorge Jean Nathan and H. L. Mencken in a recent volume, _The American\r\nCredo_, point out fairly striking instances of this tendency of the\r\nAmerican mind. They have compiled a series of 435 commonly accepted\r\nbeliefs covering a wide range. Among these 435 listed American beliefs\r\nthere are some very real ones which involve and include the following\r\npopular notions about Negroes:\r\n\r\n     1. That a Negro's vote may always be readily bought for a\r\n     dollar.\r\n\r\n     2. That every colored cook has a lover who never works and\r\n     that she feeds him by stealing the best part of every dish\r\n     she cooks.\r\n\r\n     3. That every Negro who went to France with the army has a\r\n     liaison with a white woman and won't look at a colored woman\r\n     any more.\r\n\r\n     4. That all male Negroes can sing.\r\n\r\n     5. That if one hits a Negro on the head with a cobblestone\r\n     the cobblestone will break.\r\n\r\n     6. That all Negroes born south of the Potomac can play the\r\n     banjo and are excellent dancers.\r\n\r\n     7. That whenever a Negro is educated he refuses to work and\r\n     becomes a criminal.\r\n\r\n     8. That every Negro servant girl spends at least half of her\r\n     wages on preparations for taking the kink out of her hair.\r\n\r\n     9. That all Negro prize fighters marry white women and then\r\n     afterwards beat them.\r\n\r\n     10. That all Negroes who show any intelligence are two-thirds\r\n     white and the sons of U.S. Senators.\r\n\r\n     11. That the minute a Negro gets eight dollars he goes to a\r\n     dentist and has one of his front teeth filled with gold.\r\n\r\n     12. That a Negro ball always ends up in a grand free-for-all\r\n     fight in which several Negroes are mortally slashed with razors.\r\n\r\nThe most usual of these secondary beliefs which figure in the experience\r\nof Negroes and whites in Chicago are apparently of southern origin. This\r\nis due, not so much to any deliberate effort of southerners to infiltrate\r\nthem into northern race relations, as that northerners largely regard as\r\nauthoritative the experience of the South which holds almost nine-tenths\r\nof the total Negro population.\r\n\r\nSome of the secondary beliefs are:\r\n\r\n1. That Negroes are lazy; that they are indisposed to, though not\r\nincapable of, sustained physical exertion.\r\n\r\n2. That they are happy-go-lucky; that their improvidence is demonstrated\r\nin their extravagance, and that their reckless disregard for their welfare\r\nis shown in a lack of foresight for the essentials of well-being. It is\r\nasserted that they do not purchase homes and do not save their money;\r\nthat they spend lavishly for clothes to the neglect of home comforts and\r\nthe demands even of their health; that they work by the day, and before\r\nthe week is ended confuse bookkeeping by demanding their pay.\r\n\r\n3. That they are boisterous. Hilarity in public places and especially\r\nin their own gatherings is thought to be common. They are considered\r\nas rude and coarse in public conveyances and are believed to jostle\r\nwhite passengers sometimes without thought and sometimes out of pure\r\nmaliciousness.\r\n\r\n4. That they are bumptious; that when a Negro is placed in a position of\r\nunaccustomed authority relative to his group he has an unduly exaggerated\r\nsense of his own importance and makes himself unbearable.\r\n\r\n5. That they are overassertive; that constant harping on constitutional\r\nrights is a habit of Negroes, especially of the newer generation; that\r\nin their demands for equal rights and privileges they are egged on by\r\nagitators of their own race and are overinsistent in their demands; that\r\nthey resent imaginary insults and are generally supersensitive.\r\n\r\n6. That they are lacking in civic consciousness. Absence of community\r\npride and disregard for community welfare are alleged to be the common\r\nfailing of Negroes. It is pointed out that the \"Black Belt\" has been\r\nallowed to run down and become the most unattractive spot in the city.\r\nTo this fact is attributed the tolerance of vice within this region.\r\nNegroes generally, it is still believed, can be bought in elections with\r\nmoney and whiskey. They are charged with having no pride in the beauty\r\nof the city, and with making it unbeautiful by personal and group habits.\r\n\r\n7. That they usually carry razors. Whenever a newspaper reporter is in\r\ndoubt he gives a razor as the weapon used. Some time ago a woman was found\r\nmurdered in a town near Chicago. She had been slashed with a razor, and\r\nthe broken blade was left beside her body. The murder was particularly\r\natrocious, and the murderer left no other clew. Several Negroes were\r\narrested on suspicion but were released when a white youth confessed\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\nA Negro lawyer said:\r\n\r\n     During the riot a Negro was arrested for having a razor in his\r\n     pocket. I was his attorney, and the evidence showed that he\r\n     always shaved at work. After having shaved at this particular\r\n     time, he put his razor in his pocket and forgot it. He started\r\n     home and was accosted by two officers, who searched him\r\n     and found the razor. The judge heard the evidence and then\r\n     whispered to me that he was going to give the fellow ten days\r\n     because \"you know your people do carry razors.\" He asked me\r\n     if I thought it all right and I said that I did not.\r\n\r\n8. That they habitually \"shoot craps.\" The Negro's supposed fondness\r\nfor gambling is a phase of the belief concerning his improvidence. It\r\nis not unusual for whites, in conversation with any Negro whom they do\r\nnot know well, when they wish merely to be friendly, to refer to dice.\r\nEmployers frequently say that Negroes never keep money because as soon\r\nas it is earned it is thrown away on gambling with dice. The state's\r\nattorney believed that the riot of July, 1919, began over a beach craps\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nNegroes are believed to be flashy in dress, loving brilliant and gaudy\r\ncolors, especially vivid red. Again, they are believed by white unionists\r\nto be natural strike breakers with deliberate intentions to undermine\r\nwhite living standards. Similarly they are believed to be fond of gin.\r\nPauperism among them is believed to be unduly high, and they are thought\r\nto have no home life.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BACKGROUND OF PREVAILING BELIEFS CONCERNING NEGROES\r\n\r\nLying back of the current opinions about Negroes is a chain of\r\ncircumstances involving the history of divers racial groups over hundreds\r\nof years. Slavery placed a stamp upon Negroes which it will require many\r\nmore years to erase. Probably there would have been no doubt at all in\r\nthe minds of Americans that essential inequalities existed between white\r\nand Negro had not their emancipation developed numerous unsuspected\r\nqualities. Thomas Jefferson is responsible for the observation that \"a\r\nNegro could scarcely be found who was capable of tracing and comprehending\r\nthe investigations of Euclid.\" John C. Calhoun asserted that if a Negro\r\ncould be found capable of giving the syntax of a Greek verb he would be\r\ndisposed to call him human. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to\r\nthe Constitution fixed the Negro's status by law, and as soon afterward\r\nas his broader contacts with American institutions provided an outlet\r\nfor more human participation, serious questions concerning his fitness\r\nfor citizenship were put. The first studies that followed have been\r\naccepted for many years as the standard of judgment.\r\n\r\n_Mentality._--Regarding Negro mentality, Dr. Jeffries Wyman, anatomist\r\nof Harvard University, about 1870, said: \"It cannot be denied that the\r\nNegro and ourang do afford the point where man and the brute, when the\r\ntotality of their organization is considered, most nearly approach each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nAs a corollary he adds:\r\n\r\n     The Negro may be a man and a worker in some secondary sense;\r\n     he is not a man and a brother in the same full sense in which\r\n     every Western Aryan is a man and a brother. To me the Negro\r\n     is repulsive.\r\n\r\n     The Negro is not yet a man and he is not yet a brother to the\r\n     white. It will take generations, no man can say how many, to\r\n     bring him to the level of supreme Caucasian man. He will have\r\n     to reduce the facial angle and he will have to have a more\r\n     spacious cranium before he can come into brotherhood with the\r\n     more advanced species of mankind.\r\n\r\nProfessor A. H. Keane, author of _Man Past and Present_, at least gave\r\nsome sanction to the disposition to regard the Negro and Caucasian races\r\nas having nothing in common. To quote from his book, published in 1890:\r\n\r\n     No historic or scientific reason can be alleged why these\r\n     races, black or white, should be grouped together under one\r\n     appellation if by such name it is meant to convey the idea\r\n     that the human type can have any sanguinary affiliation. In\r\n     the Negro groups it is absolutely shown that certain African\r\n     races, whether born in Africa or America, give an internal\r\n     capacity almost identical of 83 cubic inches. It is demonstrated\r\n     through monumental, cranial and other testimonials, that the\r\n     various types of mankind have ever been permanent; have been\r\n     independent of all physical influences for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nDr. J. C. Nott, scientist and author of _Types of Mankind_ said:\r\n\r\n     It is mind and mind alone which constitutes the proudest\r\n     prerogative of man, whose excellence should be measured by his\r\n     intelligence and virtue. The Negro and other unintellectual\r\n     types have been shown in another chapter to possess heads\r\n     much smaller, by actual measurement in cubic inches, than the\r\n     white races; and although metaphysicians may dispute about\r\n     causes which have debased their intellects and precluded their\r\n     expansion, it cannot be denied that these dark races are,\r\n     in this particular, greatly inferior to the others of fairer\r\n     complexion.\r\n\r\nThis school of anthropology very clearly belongs to the period of slavery\r\nwhen it was necessary to rationalize the wishes of persons who, in\r\norder to treat Negroes as if they were mentally different, had first to\r\nconvince, then justify, themselves in so doing.\r\n\r\nFollowing them was another type of scientific writers who, while assuming\r\nthat Negroes possessed brains, denied that they were like those of white\r\npersons or ever could be.\r\n\r\nG. Stanley Hall thought that the Negro's development came to at least\r\npartial standstill at puberty. E. B. Tylor, author of _Anthropology_,\r\nassumed, from the accounts of European teachers who had taught children\r\nof the \"lower\" races, that after the age of twelve the colored children\r\nfell off and were left behind by the white children. Odum thought that\r\nthe Negro child's mental development ended at the age of thirteen. None\r\nof these opinions, however, was the result of experimentation. A. T.\r\nSmith, author of _A Study of Race Psychology_, is responsible for the\r\nassociation and memory study of what he called a \"typical\" Negro boy of\r\nsixteen years. He discovered that \"the Negro child is psychologically\r\ndifferent from the white child, superior in automatic power but decidedly\r\ninferior in the power of abstraction, judgment and analysis.\" A. McDonald,\r\nauthor of _Colored Children--A Psycho-physical Study_, gave physical\r\nand mental tests in 1899 to ninety-one Negro children and concluded\r\nthat dulness in colored children sets in between thirteen and sixteen.\r\nM. J. Mayo, author of _The Mental Capacity of the American Negro_, in\r\n1913 studied 150 white and 150 colored high-school pupils in the schools\r\nof New York, and found the efficiency of colored pupils 76 per cent of\r\nthat of the white. His selection included a large number of emigrants\r\nfrom the South, which, he explained, would increase the quality of the\r\ncolored group, since only the more ambitious Negroes would seek to better\r\ntheir conditions by moving North. No account was taken of the defective\r\nschool system of the South. Phillips made a study of retardation in the\r\nschools of Philadelphia and concluded that the course of study was not\r\nsuited to Negroes, since colored children showed a greater degree of\r\nretardation than the whites.\r\n\r\nCharles Carroll's book on the Negro points out by texts drawn from the\r\nBible that the Negro is a beast created with an articulate tongue and\r\nhands in order that he may serve his white master. To bear out this\r\ntheory Carroll's book says that man has been created in the image of\r\nGod, but since, as everyone knows, God is not a Negro, it follows that\r\nthe Negro is not in the image of God; therefore he is not a man.\r\n\r\nThere is a plain explanation of the origin of these beliefs. The science\r\nof anthropology itself has remarkably advanced during the past fifty\r\nyears. When Negroes emerged from slavery, illiterate and unaccustomed\r\nto freedom, it was natural that their condition should be accepted as\r\nevidence that they could neither learn nor absorb the standards of the\r\ncivilization around them. But although their illiteracy, for example,\r\nhas decreased from 98 to 27 per cent, the original beliefs persist.\r\n\r\n_Morality._--The reputation of Negroes for immorality is based largely on\r\nsouthern authority and is historically explained by reference to slavery,\r\nin which state immorality is asserted to have been common between the\r\nmaster and the woman slave. There are many authorities on this character\r\ntrait. Perhaps the most pretentious study on this subject is by Howard\r\nO. Odum in \"Studies in History, Economics and Public Law,\" Columbia\r\nUniversity, 1910. It is called _A Study in Race Traits, Tendencies and\r\nProspects_. Writing of immorality among Negroes, Odum says:\r\n\r\n     It has generally been assumed that the Negro is differentiated\r\n     by a distinct sexual development. It is affirmed that the\r\n     sex development crowds out the mental growth. It is affirmed\r\n     that the period of puberty in boys and girls is marked by\r\n     special manifestations of wildness and uncontrol. It is true,\r\n     too, that the practices of the Negroes leave little energy\r\n     for moral and mental regeneration. Their lives are filled\r\n     with that which is carnal; their thoughts are most filthy\r\n     and their morals are generally beyond description. Again,\r\n     physical developments from childhood are precocious and the\r\n     sex life begins at a ridiculously early period. But granting\r\n     these truths, it is doubtful if there is sufficient evidence\r\n     to warrant such a conclusion. The Negro reveals a strong\r\n     physical nature; the sex impulse is naturally predominant. But\r\n     its manifestations are probably no more violent and powerful\r\n     than are the expressions of other feelings already suggested.\r\n     The Negro's sensuous enjoyment of eating and drinking and\r\n     sleeping, relatively speaking, are no less marked than his\r\n     sexual propensities. Likewise lack of control and extreme\r\n     manifestations characterize the discharge of other impulses.\r\n     It is true, again, that the part played by sexual life among\r\n     the Negroes is large for a people; but to state that the\r\n     Negro is inherently differentiated and hindered by a sexual\r\n     development out of proportion to other physical qualities is\r\n     quite a different proposition. But whether the question here\r\n     raised is answered in the affirmative or not, it still remains\r\n     that in the practical life of the Negro his better impulses\r\n     are warped and hindered by his unreasonable abuse of sexual\r\n     license. And it is safe to suggest that the Negro need hope\r\n     for little development of his best qualities until he has\r\n     learned to regulate and control his animal impulses.\r\n\r\nStatistics on illegitimate births and abortions are frequently quoted\r\nas evidence of Negro immorality. It is further asserted, with rarely\r\nan attempt at correction, that these immoral tendencies are responsible\r\nfor rape and attempted rape of white women.\r\n\r\nTradition maintains that it is a part of Negro nature to desire a white\r\nwoman and similarly a part of his nature to be lacking in those restraints\r\nand inhibitions which might control this desire. C. H. McCord, author of\r\n_The American Negro as a Dependent, Defective, and Delinquent_, said:\r\n\"The average Negro is a child in every essential element of character,\r\nexhibiting those characteristics that indicate a tendency to lawless\r\nimpulse and weak inhibition.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous magazine articles and written studies in the South on this\r\nsubject have given weight to this belief through sheer repetition.\r\nIt is now not necessary to prove assertions or present an array of\r\ninstances; they are taken for granted. Allusions to the \"well-known\r\nimmoral character\" of the Negro or his instinctive tendency to commit\r\nsex crimes appear to carry as strong an impress of certainty as proved\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n_Other supposed social characteristics._--Discussions of each of the\r\ncharacteristics mentioned and many others are found in the literature\r\non the subject. It will suffice here to give selections typical of the\r\ntrend of descriptions to indicate the manner in which the picture of\r\nthe Negro in practically every phase of his life has been set. Of his\r\nindustrial habits Odum, in the social study of the Negro, says:\r\n\r\n     In any discussion of the economic situation this (the question\r\n     of the efficiency of Negro labor) is an important consideration.\r\n     A portion of the Negroes wander about and seek to get a living\r\n     as best they can without working for it; they must necessarily\r\n     live at the expense of the other Negroes and the whites. The\r\n     number of vagrants in every community is surprisingly large.\r\n     They are naturally divided into several groups; those who never\r\n     work but wander from place to place, never fixed and without\r\n     a home, stealing, begging, and obtaining a living from any\r\n     source possible. Such men never work except when forced to do\r\n     so in little jobs or on the streets or in the chain gang.\r\n\r\nOf the Negro's social affairs he says:\r\n\r\n     The description of one of these [Negro] dances would be\r\n     repulsive. The Negroes have \"good times\" on such occasions\r\n     and will go a long distance to attend. The whole trend of the\r\n     dance is toward physical excitation; they are without order\r\n     and the influence is totally bad.\r\n\r\nOf the condition of the Negro's home:\r\n\r\n     It will be seen that there is little orderly home life among\r\n     the Negroes. Health conditions and daily habits are no better\r\n     than the arrangement of the house. Sometimes an entire family\r\n     consisting of father, mother, large and small children occupy\r\n     the same rooms. Nor do they ventilate, and especially when any\r\n     of the inmates are sick they are loath to let in the fresh\r\n     air. Physicians testify that three or four often sleep in a\r\n     bed together; they do not change clothing before going to bed\r\n     in many cases, and often go for many days without a change of\r\n     garments. It has been suggested that the personal habits of\r\n     the Negroes are filthy; such is the case. Filth and uncleanness\r\n     are everywhere predominant.\r\n\r\nOf his religion:\r\n\r\n     In spite of pretentions and superficiality, there is nothing so\r\n     real to the Negro as his religion, although it is a different\r\n     \"reality\" from what we commonly expect in religion. The Negro\r\n     is more excitable in his nature, and yields more readily to\r\n     excitement than does the white man. The more a thing excites\r\n     him, the more reality it has for him....\r\n\r\n     The criminal instinct appears to overbalance any consciousness\r\n     which makes for righteousness, and the Negro has little serene\r\n     consciousness of a clean record; he is ready to rush at any\r\n     surprising or suspicious turn of affairs. The Negro does not\r\n     value his word of honor; he apparently cannot always tell\r\n     the truth. Only about one in every ten will keep an important\r\n     engagement made in seriousness.\r\n\r\n     The Negro's conception of heaven and hell, God and the devil\r\n     are very distinct. Heaven is an eternal resting-place where\r\n     he shall occupy the best place. He sings of his heavenly home\r\n     in striking contrast to his earthly abode. Perhaps for the\r\n     reason that the Negroes have little satisfactory home life,\r\n     they expect to have a perfect home in the next life.\r\n\r\nOf his finer emotions:\r\n\r\n     While it is doubtful if there is enough evidence to warrant a\r\n     full statement concerning the affections of the Negroes, it is\r\n     apparently based on the gregarious impulse and upon a passive\r\n     sympathy rather than upon individual emotions intellectually\r\n     developed. The emotion is rarely of long duration.... The\r\n     Negro mother rarely mourns for her wandering child, or sits\r\n     up at night waiting for his return or thinking of him. The\r\n     father shows little care except that of losing a laborer from\r\n     his work.... The Negro has no loved ones. Numbers were asked\r\n     for the names of those whom they considered friends or whom\r\n     they loved or those who loved them. The question was put in\r\n     various ways with different subjects, but the returns were the\r\n     same.... But as a rule the Negro is without friendship among\r\n     his own people.\r\n\r\nIt may help to comprehend the range of conclusions found in the\r\nliterature on the subject of Negro traits of character to note the array\r\nof descriptive adjectives employed, thus: sensual, lazy, unobservant,\r\nshiftless, unresentful, emotional, shallow, patient, amiable, gregarious,\r\nexpressive, appropriative, childish, religious, unmoral, immoral,\r\nignorant, mentally inferior, criminal, excitable, imitative, repulsive,\r\npoetic, irresponsible, filthy, unintellectual, bumptious, overassertive,\r\nsuperficial, indecent, dependent, untruthful, musical, ungrateful, loyal,\r\nsporty, provincial, anthropomorphic, savage, brutish, happy-go-lucky,\r\ncareless, plastic, docile, apish, inferior, cheerful.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said of influences which have operated to counteract the\r\nopinion-making literature as to the utterly hopeless condition of Negroes.\r\nThe object of this study, however, is not to attack these conclusions,\r\nbut merely to cite them as indicating how certain attitudes detrimental\r\nto racial friendliness and understanding have had their rise.\r\n\r\nIn academic circles the more balanced opinions of anthropologists are\r\ngaining some headway. Franz Boaz, probably the foremost anthropologist\r\nin the United States, in _The Mind of Primitive Man_, maintains:\r\n\r\n     Our considerations make it probable that the wide differences\r\n     between the manifestations of the human mind in various stages\r\n     of culture may be due almost entirely to the form of individual\r\n     experience, which is determined by the geographical and social\r\n     environment of the individual. It would seem that, in different\r\n     races, the organization of the mind is on the whole alike,\r\n     and that the variations of mind found in different races\r\n     do not exceed, perhaps not even reach, the amount of normal\r\n     individual variation in each race. It has been indicated that,\r\n     notwithstanding this similarity in the form of individual mental\r\n     processes, the expression of mental activity of a community\r\n     tends to show a characteristic historical development.\r\n\r\nThis author in an article in the _Nation_ for December, 1920, comments\r\nthus on Lothrop Stoddard's book, _The Rising Tide of Color_:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Stoddard's book is one of the long series of publications\r\n     devoted to the self-admiration of the white race, which begins\r\n     with Gobineau and comes down to us through Chamberlain and,\r\n     with increasingly passionate appeal, through Madison Grant\r\n     to Mr. Stoddard. The newer books of this type try to bolster\r\n     up their unscientific theories by an amateurish appeal to\r\n     misunderstood discoveries relating to heredity and give in\r\n     this manner a scientific guise to their dogmatic statements\r\n     which misleads the public. For this reason the books must be\r\n     characterized as vicious propaganda, and gain an attention\r\n     not warranted by an intrinsic merit in their learning or their\r\n     logic.\r\n\r\n     Each race is exceedingly variable in all of its features, and\r\n     we find in the white race, as well as in all other races, all\r\n     grades of intellectual capacity, from the imbecile to the man\r\n     of high intellectual power. It is true that intellectual power\r\n     is hereditary in the individual, and that the healthy, the\r\n     physically and mentally developed individuals of a race, if\r\n     they marry among themselves, are liable to have offspring of a\r\n     similar excellence; but it is equally true that the inferior\r\n     individuals in a race will also have inferior offspring. If,\r\n     therefore, it were entirely a question of eugenic development\r\n     of humanity, then the aid of the eugenist would be to suppress\r\n     not the gifted strains of other races, but rather the inferior\r\n     strains of our own race. A selection of the intelligent,\r\n     energetic and highly endowed individuals from all over the\r\n     world would not by any means leave the white race as the only\r\n     survivors, but would leave an assembly of individuals who\r\n     would probably represent all the different races of man now\r\n     in existence.\r\n\r\nJean Finot, in _Race Prejudice_, says:\r\n\r\n     When we go through the list of external differences which appear\r\n     to divide men, we find literally nothing which can authorize\r\n     their division into superior and inferior beings, into masters\r\n     and pariahs. If this division exists in our thought, it only\r\n     came there as the result of inexact observations and false\r\n     opinions drawn from them.\r\n\r\n     The science of inequality is emphatically a science of white\r\n     people. It is they who have invented it and set it going, who\r\n     have maintained, cherished, and propagated it, thanks to their\r\n     observations and their deductions. Deeming themselves greater\r\n     than men of other colours, they have elevated into superior\r\n     qualities all the traits which are peculiar to themselves,\r\n     commencing with the whiteness of the skin and the pliancy of\r\n     the hair. But nothing proves that these vaunted traits are\r\n     traits of real superiority.\r\n\r\nW. I. Thomas, in _Sex and Society_, concludes his discussion of relative\r\nmentality with this statement:\r\n\r\n     The real variable is the individual, not the race. In the\r\n     beginning--perhaps as the result of a mutation or series\r\n     of mutations--a type of brain developed which has remained\r\n     relatively fixed in all times and among all races. This\r\n     brain will never have any faculty in addition to what it now\r\n     possesses, because as a type of structure it is as fixed as\r\n     the species itself, and is indeed a mark of species. It is\r\n     not apparent that we are greatly in need of another faculty,\r\n     or that we could make use of it even if by a chance mutation\r\n     it should emerge, since with the power of abstraction we are\r\n     able to do any class of work we know anything about.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. TYPES OF SENTIMENTS AND ATTITUDES\r\n\r\nIn the South the relations between the white and Negro races are\r\ndetermined by custom as well as law, which, however, permit the close\r\npersonal relationships of family servants. In the North, when these\r\nrelations become more impersonal and contacts are widened through change\r\nof occupation from domestic service to industry, these close personal ties\r\nare weakened. There is no established rule of conduct binding on whites\r\nand Negroes in their relations with each other; and although traditional\r\nbeliefs may influence present relations in the North, they do not always\r\ndominate them. So it happens that there are to be found shades of opinion\r\nconcerning Negroes varying from deliberate indifference to vituperative\r\nabuse of Negroes, whatever the subject, depending on one's beliefs about\r\nthem. The selections of sentiment which follow are examples collected\r\nat random over the city--through interviews and discussions, from group\r\npublications, speeches and reports. They illustrate the real sentiments\r\nthat white persons express when brought into contact with Negroes, or\r\nwhen their opinions are solicited.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE EMOTIONAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n_Hostile sentiment._--The refusal of Policeman Callahan to arrest Stauber,\r\na white youth accused of throwing stones which resulted in the drowning\r\nof Eugene Williams, is regarded as the significant incident precipitating\r\nthe riot of 1919 (see p. 4). Callahan was dismissed from the force, but\r\nreinstated. One year later, when questioned by an investigator for the\r\nCommission, he gave his racial philosophy freely in the following remarks:\r\n\r\n     So far as I can learn the black people have since history began\r\n     despised the white people and have always fought them.... It\r\n     wouldn't take much to start another riot, and most of the white\r\n     people of this district are resolved to make a clean-up this\r\n     time.... If a Negro should say one word back to me or should\r\n     say a word to a white woman in the park, there is a crowd of\r\n     young men of the district, mostly ex-service men, who would\r\n     procure arms and fight shoulder to shoulder with me if trouble\r\n     should come from the incident.\r\n\r\nThe following is from a letter written by a white employee of Albert\r\nPick & Company:\r\n\r\n     Negroes in street cars refuse to double up with others of their\r\n     race, but seem to delight in sitting beside some dainty white\r\n     girl.\r\n\r\n     The Thirty-fifth Street cars are crowded by low-grade\r\n     \"plantation niggers\" who crowd on at Ashland Avenue via windows\r\n     and doors, then awkwardly step and fall over passengers; it is\r\n     maddening. About this time girls from Albert Pick & Company, the\r\n     Magnus Company, and the tailoring establishments are crowded\r\n     together breast to breast with Negroes. Often he falls asleep\r\n     and leans on his white seatmate's shoulder.\r\n\r\n     Laws should be urged preventing intermarriage.\r\n\r\n     Assaults upon white women are frequent, but hushed up by fear\r\n     of newspaper publicity, and the Negro is thus encouraged in\r\n     his felony.\r\n\r\n     In cases where a white girl is involved in an assault case\r\n     by a colored man, the white woman should be shielded, and her\r\n     name withheld from the newspapers and public, before and after\r\n     the trial. This will prevent race riots.\r\n\r\n     A movement is now afoot to declare a silent boycott against\r\n     employers of colored help.\r\n\r\nA physician living on Oakwood Boulevard said: \"The increasing amount\r\ngenerally of sex immorality is being contributed to by mixing Negroes\r\nand whites in schools and parks.\"\r\n\r\nA teacher in the Felsenthal School said:\r\n\r\n     The colored people are coming from the South all the time,\r\n     for political purposes. It's propaganda for the colored man\r\n     to sit down by the white woman, and not to double up to make\r\n     room for the whites. Their papers tell them to do it. I was\r\n     the only white person in an empty car one day and a colored\r\n     man came in and took the seat beside me.\r\n\r\n_Fear._--From _White Americans_ circulated in Chicago:\r\n\r\n     In the United States Negroes not only vote and hold office, but\r\n     the Negro vote is the deciding factor in the national elections,\r\n     and also in many of the northern cities, and they trade their\r\n     vote for jobs and offices and other privileges. The Negroes\r\n     control the great city of Philadelphia, and the press said the\r\n     Negro delegates at the Republican Convention in Chicago openly\r\n     offered to sell their support to the presidential candidate\r\n     who would pay the most money. Just think this thing over,\r\n     you sovereign United States citizens: the Negroes control the\r\n     elections, and thus your law-makers, judges, and officials;\r\n     and the Negroes have so much pull and confidence, that they\r\n     not only defend their political rights, but they start riots\r\n     and race wars, and openly threaten that they are going to make\r\n     the white folks stand around.\r\n\r\n_Fear and pity._--A resident in the 6600 block on Langley Avenue said:\r\n\r\n     A colored family lives next door north of me, and you'll be\r\n     surprised when I tell you that I haven't been able to open my\r\n     bedroom window on that side to air that room for three years.\r\n     I couldn't think of unlocking the windows because their window\r\n     is so near somebody could easily step across into this house.\r\n     It's awful to have to live in such fear of your life.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if she considered her neighbors so dangerous as that, she said:\r\n\r\n     Well, no, the woman seems pretty nice. I see her out in the back\r\n     yard occasionally and bid her the time of day out of charity.\r\n     You can't help but pity them, so I am charitable and speak.\r\n     Where the danger really is, is that you never know who's in\r\n     their house; they bring such trash to the neighborhood, even\r\n     if they are good and decent. How do I know what kind of people\r\n     this woman next door associates with? There's awful-looking\r\n     people sit on the front porch sometimes. Why, I couldn't sit\r\n     on my porch on the hottest day because I'd be afraid they\r\n     would come out any minute. And what white person will sit on\r\n     a porch next door to a porch with black ones on it? Not me,\r\n     anyhow, nor you either I hope.\r\n\r\n_Hostile but resigned._--A resident near Dorchester Avenue and Sixtieth\r\nStreet said:\r\n\r\n     I have nothing against the black man as a black man. He comes\r\n     into my place of business (drug-store) and I sell him. Not\r\n     many come in, as there aren't a lot of colored people around\r\n     Sixty-third and Woodlawn or Dorchester. But I don't want to\r\n     live with niggers any more than you or any other white person\r\n     does. People who say, \"I like the colored people and don't see\r\n     why others can't get along with them\" don't talk practical\r\n     common sense. Theoretically all this talk is all right, but\r\n     you get a white man of this sort to come right down and live\r\n     with a nigger and he won't do it.\r\n\r\n     Niggers are different from whites and always will be, and that\r\n     is why white people don't want them around. But the only thing\r\n     we can do, it seems to me, is make the best of it and live\r\n     peaceably with them. The North can never do what the South\r\n     does--down there it is pure autocracy. I might say like Russia.\r\n     That might have worked here in the North from the start, but\r\n     can't be started now, and we wouldn't want such autocracy\r\n     anyway. They are citizens, and it is up to us to teach them to\r\n     be good ones. How it can be done I don't know--it will have to\r\n     come slow, and no one can give a solution offhand. Everybody\r\n     says, \"We don't want the niggers with us.\" Well, here they\r\n     are, and we can't do anything. Must let them live where they\r\n     want to and go to school where they want to, and we don't want\r\n     to force their right away.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find in some circles and with many individuals\r\na resolute indisposition to discuss any phase of the Negro problem.\r\nConvictions regarding the race are so firmly set and hostile that no\r\nargument or appeal to fair-mindedness can alter their position.\r\n\r\n\"Eye Witness,\" a special writer for the _Chicago Tribune_, encountered\r\nthis state of mind in interviewing whites and Negroes for a series of\r\narticles on the Negro question which appeared in the _Tribune_ in May,\r\n1919. He characterized it as insensate and dangerous. His own statement,\r\npublished May 4, 1919, said:\r\n\r\n     Among men like publicists and administrators of large affairs,\r\n     who, when they discuss the problems and troubles of their\r\n     race, are wont to speak in a rational, or at least mannerly\r\n     way, there was often an unfeeling kind of don't-give-a-damn\r\n     cry when they talked on this subject that made one wonder how\r\n     they had managed so well in maintaining a human and successful\r\n     relationship with their white associates in business and with\r\n     their employees.\r\n\r\n     I heard more, far more, insensate language from the lips of\r\n     white men than of black men throughout the series of interviews.\r\n     The horrible part of that, to me, was that when a white employer\r\n     more or less accountable for the well-being of colored workmen,\r\n     or a publicist entrusted with a pen that forms and directs\r\n     opinions, had railed about \"these damn niggers\" they appeared\r\n     to think they had said something rather gallant and decisive,\r\n     for they would smile fatuously and expect acquiescence.\r\n\r\n     And more terrible than the language was the insensate state\r\n     of mind such language betrayed. The only way one could avoid\r\n     the suspicion that one was listening to a potential lunatic\r\n     or a desperately stupid person without a human or a community\r\n     sense, was to allow much for the vehemence of the American\r\n     tongue and to concede that these men don't mean one-tenth of\r\n     what they say. If they did they would be fomenters of race wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SENTIMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\n_Sentiment for the \"old family servants.\"_--A white physician born in\r\nthe South said:\r\n\r\n     My father owned slaves. He looked out for them; told them what\r\n     to do. He loved them and they loved him. I was brought up during\r\n     and after the war. I had a \"black mammy\" and she was devoted\r\n     to me and I to her; and I played with Negro children. In a\r\n     way I'm fond of the Negro; I understand him and he understands\r\n     me; but the bond between us is not as close as it was between\r\n     my father and his slaves. On the other hand, my children have\r\n     grown up without black playmates and without a \"black mammy.\"\r\n     The attitude of my children is less sympathetic toward the\r\n     Negroes than my own. They don't know each other.\r\n\r\n_Paternal relationship._--In testimony before the Commission a witness\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The prejudice against the colored people in the South isn't as\r\n     strong in some instances as it is in the North. It's a queer\r\n     thing, but the white man in the South, and the white woman,\r\n     too, has a sort of paternal feeling that he must look after him\r\n     and that the colored man's interests are better in his hands\r\n     than if he is left to drift for himself. I don't state that\r\n     as an actual fact, but I believe it is true. That is their\r\n     point of view. They don't hate the colored man. They don't\r\n     dislike him, but I should say this, that they won't take him\r\n     into their homes. They don't dislike him, provided he keeps\r\n     his place. I believe the white people of the South think more\r\n     of the Negro than the white people of the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. ABSTRACT JUSTICE\r\n\r\nA trained nurse of Woodlawn said:\r\n\r\n     I meet colored people only on the cars. There are none anywhere\r\n     around here, I believe. I don't know how I would feel if they\r\n     came to Woodlawn to live. But they must live, and I hear their\r\n     quarters are getting too small. It seems that Chicago ought to\r\n     let them live somewhere. Some people treat Negroes terrible\r\n     and I think that is all wrong. Why can't we act respectably\r\n     toward colored people on the cars and treat them nice on the\r\n     street? We surely don't want to be like the people in the\r\n     South who make colored persons get off the walk when they come\r\n     along. But I see white people here almost that bad--can't see\r\n     a black man live.\r\n\r\nThe pastor of a church in Woodlawn said:\r\n\r\n     I have come to no final conclusion as to the best policy to\r\n     pursue in the adjustment of the race problem. I am thinking\r\n     about it a great deal and am deeply concerned over the whole\r\n     matter. In the present state of popular mind, there is no doubt\r\n     but property values are depreciated by the presence of Negro\r\n     tenants or property owners in residential sections. However,\r\n     if everyone felt as I do, it would not be so. I mean, provided\r\n     that the same general social standards were observed by all\r\n     nationalities in the city. It would be very fine, it seems to\r\n     me, to maintain certain standards in each neighborhood. Why\r\n     not bring pressure to bear on white landlords and make them\r\n     keep their property up to a given average standard in the\r\n     community, that only such a class of people will rent or buy\r\n     as are already there? I am very anxious that the Negro shall\r\n     be treated fairly. I do not want him to feel that I have stood\r\n     in the way of his opportunities and his rights.\r\n\r\nA professor at the University of Chicago said:\r\n\r\n     The final solution, it seems to me, must come as a result of\r\n     honest and successful efforts for mutual understanding between\r\n     the races. There must be apparent on the part of the white\r\n     race an attempt to treat the Negro with justice, and I feel\r\n     sure that he will respond. I do not think the black race, as\r\n     a race, desires intermarriage more than the white race, yet\r\n     the assertion to the contrary is much overworked by the white\r\n     opposition in these neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nA minister said:\r\n\r\n     All I want for the Negro is justice--then I think the economic\r\n     laws will settle this problem. Let the people interested try\r\n     justice; they will find it will solve the race problem faster\r\n     than any other course, just as it will solve any other problem.\r\n     Treat the bad Negro just as rough as you treat the bad white\r\n     man, but acclaim the good Negro after the same manner of your\r\n     acclamation of the good white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SENTIMENTS STRONGER THAN RACE PREJUDICE\r\n\r\n_Class kinship stronger than race._--A Swedish employee in a department\r\nstore said:\r\n\r\n     We have quite a number of Negro neighbors where I live, and\r\n     several black men work with me, and I want to say I think\r\n     they are just as good as anybody. There are classes of people\r\n     in every race, and of course there is a rough element among\r\n     the blacks. Some highbrows try to make out that they are\r\n     representative, but I think opposition to the Negro in Chicago\r\n     comes from the \"swell\" class. I do not have any different\r\n     feeling for them than for the same kind of people in any other\r\n     race. I think race relations will get better in Chicago. The\r\n     workingman has learned that the Negro will treat him right\r\n     when he is treated right, and as soon as the other folks find\r\n     that out, things will be all right.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the Cook County Labor Party said:\r\n\r\n     I have thought about this problem a good deal, and I think you\r\n     will find it is the so-called middle class that is making all\r\n     the trouble. The laboring-man does not care who his neighbor\r\n     is, so long as he is a good neighbor. I think you can trace\r\n     most of the racial activities to jealousy on the part of a\r\n     certain class of American citizens who are not any too wealthy\r\n     and feel constrained to maintain a sort of fictitious position\r\n     in life at the expense of anybody, in this case the Negroes.\r\n     You will find that the very well-to-do are not nearly so much\r\n     aroused over the problem.\r\n\r\nA Japanese said:\r\n\r\n     I think it is simply a matter of race prejudice, which of course\r\n     means first of all that the color is not acceptable, while, in\r\n     the second place, they were imported to the United States as\r\n     slaves, and thus it always occurs in the American mind that\r\n     they are a lower class of people. Furthermore, as they were\r\n     slaves and the American does not like them, they don't have\r\n     equal opportunities to educate themselves up to such a degree\r\n     which means no more than environment. In the last place, they\r\n     want to keep away from them. I think it might be said that\r\n     they are willing to receive lower wages, which tends to lower\r\n     the wage system; thus the American worker suffers a good deal.\r\n     In the whole process the Negroes have been kept out of social\r\n     and political activities that would have given them a chance\r\n     to develop. Allow them to have these activities in the future\r\n     and they will make more rapid progress than they have even in\r\n     the past.\r\n\r\n_General historical comparisons._--A Jewish resident of the West Side said:\r\n\r\n     I believe that the segregation movement is wrong because it\r\n     is unjust and because it is devoid of any principle whatever.\r\n     It has not risen out of the consideration of the needs of the\r\n     colored people, nor out of consideration of real advantages that\r\n     the whites might thereby gain. What is back of race prejudice?\r\n     Nothing more than the spirit of superiority and selfishness\r\n     which moves the aristocrats to move out of a neighborhood as\r\n     soon as a few common people move in. This is here too prevalent.\r\n     The segregation movement has its parallel in history. Who does\r\n     not remember the old Jewish Ghetto of Amsterdam, Frankfort,\r\n     etc., or the Pale of Russia? What has this segregation done\r\n     for the Jews? It curtailed their rise, depriving them of an\r\n     opportunity to develop, and I foresee the same result in the\r\n     new segregation movement, and therefore deem it a great public\r\n     evil and moral issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. TRADITIONAL SOUTHERN BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nA window dresser said:\r\n\r\n     I am from the South, and I am used to seeing the Negro kept\r\n     in his place. I would colonize them, every one of them, and\r\n     make them stay where they are put. I would colonize them in\r\n     Africa if I had to do it. There's where they came from and\r\n     there's where they belong. Of course, some few northern folks\r\n     say that they were taken away against their own wills, but I\r\n     say they ought to go back against their own wills.\r\n\r\nThe woman manager of a tailor shop, Fifty-fifth Street, said: \"I am a\r\nsoutherner, and I feel the way they all do about it. I guess you know\r\nwhat I mean. I think the nigger should stay in his place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6. GROUP SENTIMENTS\r\n\r\n_Fear of social censure._--A property owner at Langley Avenue and\r\nFifty-fifth Street said:\r\n\r\n     \"I am not proud to be living on the same street with Negroes,\r\n     so I never tell my friends--they would say: 'You must move\r\n     out.'\"\r\n\r\nGeorge L. Giles Post of the American Legion is a Negro post with\r\nheadquarters at the South Side Branch of the Community Service.\r\nInvitations to a musicale and dramatic entertainment for the benefit\r\nof ex-service men were sent to all the local posts by the Community\r\nService. It was responded to by the adjutant of George L. Giles Post,\r\nwho received a reply from the executive secretary saying:\r\n\r\n     I am quite sure you will understand that our sending one to\r\n     the George L. Giles Post was a slip. Will you kindly let me\r\n     know if there are other Posts of colored men in the city?\r\n\r\nSimilar recognition of the force of public opinion may be found in\r\nindustry. The manager of a large industrial plant, speaking of Negro\r\nworkmen, said: \"I have a feeling that white workers would object to\r\nNegroes in any position but that of common laborers, although I have no\r\nbasis for this opinion.\" Another said: \"I have heard whites remark that\r\nthey wouldn't want to work here if many colored were employed but none\r\nleft on that account.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n7. ATTITUDES DETERMINED BY CONTACTS\r\n\r\n_No contacts but a hostile attitude._--A resident at Drexel Avenue and\r\nSixty-fifth Street said:\r\n\r\n     I don't see many niggers around here; most of them are west\r\n     of Cottage Grove Avenue. I never had any dealings with them,\r\n     so can't tell you anything much. I know I don't want niggers\r\n     living next door to me, but I can't tell you why. Do you want\r\n     them next-door neighbors to you? There are some living down\r\n     in the next block--two families of them--between Sixty-fourth\r\n     and Sixty-fifth, and I guess they are pretty wild, but I have\r\n     never seen them. It's just what people tell me. I never had\r\n     any dealings with them.\r\n\r\n_Generalization from a particular experience._--A teacher in the Wendell\r\nPhillips High School said:\r\n\r\n     You can't trust the best of them. The minute you have your\r\n     back turned something disappears. They are the worst bunch of\r\n     little thieves I ever struck. A few weeks ago I had a colored\r\n     girl helping me fix costumes in my little office. During the\r\n     hour she was in there I was absent about five minutes. She\r\n     had hardly got out of the building before I discovered that a\r\n     dollar had disappeared out of my purse. I questioned her for\r\n     thirty minutes next morning, but not a word of confession.\r\n     Another time I had small change in the top drawer of my desk.\r\n     While I was teaching a class, two girls slipped into the office\r\n     and helped themselves to half of it. I surprised them when I\r\n     unexpectedly entered the office to get something. Everything\r\n     here that isn't tied or watched walks off. It didn't used to\r\n     be this way before the colored came in so thick; then I never\r\n     locked my office, and now I have everything under lock.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of a woman's dress shop on Sixty-third Street said:\r\n\r\n     Little of my trade is colored, possibly 2 per cent. We do not\r\n     cater to colored trade. We do not want it. If colored people\r\n     come in, we will sell them if they buy quick and get out.\r\n     Our trade does not care to deal where colored people are also\r\n     accommodated.... You will find it pretty hard to be neutral in\r\n     Chicago. The more I know of niggers, the more I am convinced\r\n     that there is no good nigger but a dead one. I had a colored\r\n     helper who wanted tips every time he was asked to render\r\n     services outside of his recognized regular duties. I gave him\r\n     a good salary, $18 per week, and yet he was never satisfied,\r\n     and one day he got hold of the keys to the cash drawer and\r\n     ran away with $300.\r\n\r\n_Exaggerated notion of prosperity._--A physician said:\r\n\r\n     I think that the solution of the race problem can come only by\r\n     recognition by white men of the Negroes' potential equality.\r\n     They are only fifty years out of slavery, and in that fifty\r\n     years they have progressed faster than the white race has\r\n     done in a hundred years. The Negro man of forty today is less\r\n     advanced than the white man of forty, but I expect his son\r\n     to be almost on a par with our sons, and his grandson will be\r\n     every whit as good. The husband of the colored woman who has\r\n     been getting our dinners for us for a number of years is making\r\n     more killing steers for Armour than I am. He makes $16 a day.\r\n     They have $12,000 worth of Liberty bonds. They are sending\r\n     all of their relatives through high school and declare they\r\n     will put them through the University of Chicago. In fact we\r\n     are compelling the Negro to get an education, and he cannot\r\n     help but progress. Colonizing the Negro is merely making him\r\n     bitter and postponing the day of settlement. Presently we shall\r\n     have with us under such a régime a race of comparative equals\r\n     very much disgruntled by the unfair treatment accorded them. I\r\n     think you will find that practically all the professional men\r\n     in this building, at least a very large percentage of them,\r\n     think as I do on this subject.\r\n\r\n_Contact with servants._--A resident of Woodlawn said:\r\n\r\n     Practically my only contact with Negroes is with servants and\r\n     laundresses. I have had colored women working for me for many\r\n     years, and the majority of them I could not trust outside my\r\n     sight. By that I don't mean they would steal--they just weren't\r\n     dependable. It is all wrong for colored children and white\r\n     children to be in school together. There should be separate\r\n     schools, because the two races of children are as different\r\n     in everything as in their color.\r\n\r\nThe interviewing of hundreds of white persons, members of practically\r\nevery social class, reveals little information regarding the sources of\r\ntheir beliefs about Negroes. Some think them instinctive; some hold that\r\ntheir opinions are a result of observation; some, who make discernible\r\neffort to stem the current of prejudiced views and remain fair, have\r\nread the books of Negroes. But by far the greater number either admit\r\nor otherwise give evidence of having absorbed their views from tradition.\r\n\r\nInformation by word of mouth, unquestioned statements, uncorrected\r\naccounts, all continue to add credence to any current interpretation of an\r\nact involving Negroes. The fault lies for the most part at the information\r\nsource. Fairly to judge the Negro group, or any member thereof, there\r\nshould be some unquestioned basis of fact, yet the assumption is common\r\nthat almost any Negro can be judged by what has been observed in the\r\nconduct of the family cook or chauffeur, who no more represents the\r\nwhole or the majority of Negroes than a white cook or chauffeur can be\r\nsaid to represent the whole or the majority of the white race.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SELF-ANALYSIS BY FIFTEEN WHITE CITIZENS\r\n\r\nTo secure definite information upon this background twenty representative\r\nwhite persons were selected at random, and eighteen carefully prepared\r\nsuggestive questions were put to each of them. The purpose was to draw\r\nout the raw material of their unqualified opinions on the question\r\nof the Negro, and to ascertain as far as possible the background in\r\ntheir early experiences. The questions were suggestive in order to\r\ncompel a disclosure of mental attitudes. The only qualification in the\r\nselection of persons was their probable capacity for self-analysis and\r\na willingness to answer. The length and difficulty of the questions put\r\nmade it necessary to limit the selection of persons to a few, who in\r\nappreciation of the inquiry, could and would give it a careful study.\r\nFifteen of these persons entered into the spirit of the inquiry and\r\nsubmitted the results of their self-scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThese fifteen include business and professional men and women, none\r\nof whom, however, is actively associated with racial movements. They\r\nrepresent probably a fair sample of sentiment and at the same time\r\nability to analyze accurately their own feelings and opinions.\r\n\r\nThe questions put were as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. Have you formed definite opinions about Negroes? Briefly,\r\n     what are they?\r\n\r\n     2. Do Negroes in your opinion possess distinguishing traits\r\n     of mentality or character?\r\n\r\n     3. As well as you can remember, on what facts, authorities,\r\n     information, sources, do you base your opinions?\r\n\r\n     4. What incidents or experiences involving Negroes either in\r\n     Chicago or elsewhere stand out in your memory?\r\n\r\n     5. As a child, did you have contacts of any kind with Negroes?\r\n\r\n     6. Can you recall any early prohibitions of association by\r\n     word or printed warnings of any sort, implied prohibitions in\r\n     institutional or social arrangements?\r\n\r\n     7. When were you first conscious of a racial difference?\r\n\r\n     8. Whom of your friends, acquaintances, favorite authors,\r\n     scholars, etc., do you regard as best fitted to speak with\r\n     authority on the question?\r\n\r\n     9. Do you ever inquire for information on this subject? Whom\r\n     do you ask? What Negroes do you know whom you would consider\r\n     leaders among colored people in Chicago? in the United States?\r\n\r\n     10. Did you ever read a Negro periodical? What did you think\r\n     of it?\r\n\r\n     11. What subjects of discussion most frequently lead to the\r\n     Negro?\r\n\r\n     12. In what circles is this subject most frequently discussed?\r\n\r\n     13. If it were in your power to make whatever social adjustment\r\n     you deemed wise, what disposition would you make of the Negro\r\n     population?\r\n\r\n     14. If Negroes obstinately objected to your plan and you still\r\n     had power, what would you do?\r\n\r\n     15. What do you think of the following propositions:\r\n\r\n          _a_) When you educate Negroes you increase their\r\n          demands. Either their education should be curtailed\r\n          or modified or their demands granted.\r\n\r\n          _b_) Prejudice has its principal basis in fear.\r\n\r\n          _c_) Isolating groups favors the unhampered\r\n          development of special group prejudices. Do prejudices\r\n          form a background of conflicts? The greater the\r\n          isolation, the greater the prejudices and, as would\r\n          naturally follow, the greater the chances of conflict.\r\n\r\n          _d_) A minority of the population should not expect\r\n          complete justice at the hands of an overwhelming\r\n          majority.\r\n\r\nTheir answers are given separately. The letters used to designate the\r\ndifferent persons are arbitrary.\r\n\r\nA--\r\n\r\n     I have rather definite opinions of Negroes. As a class they\r\n     cannot be depended upon. They are shiftless and really must\r\n     be treated like children. I make allowance for the fact that\r\n     they have not the years of education back of them.\r\n\r\n     My opinions are based on visits made to the South and on\r\n     information obtained from relatives who live in the South\r\n     as well as from the colored help we have had. As a child my\r\n     contact with Negroes began with our Negro house servants,\r\n     and my first consciousness of a racial difference came while\r\n     visiting relatives in the South. I know but two persons who\r\n     might speak with authority on the race question. They are Edgar\r\n     A. Bancroft and Miss Mary McDowell. It is very seldom that I\r\n     inquire for information on this subject. People whom I know\r\n     are not interested in the problem.\r\n\r\n     The only Negroes whom I know are my present colored help and\r\n     those who have worked for me. I don't know whom to consider\r\n     leaders among the colored people either in Chicago or in\r\n     the United States. Concerning the Negro periodicals, I have\r\n     occasionally read copies of one of their newspapers which bore\r\n     out my opinion of their simple minds. Discussion of domestic\r\n     help and of newspaper articles about Negroes and sociological\r\n     conditions most frequently lead to the discussion of the\r\n     Negro in my circle. If it were in my power to do so, I would\r\n     segregate Negroes as to living quarters and do all possible\r\n     to help them educate and help themselves.\r\n\r\n     Concerning proposition (_a_) I agree that if you educate\r\n     Negroes, you increase their demands, but I also believe that\r\n     as they become educated, greater demands will arise in their\r\n     own groups.\r\n\r\n     In my opinion prejudice has its principal basis in the fact\r\n     that one can't depend upon Negroes.\r\n\r\n     I do not believe that it is necessarily true that a minority\r\n     of the population should not expect complete justice at the\r\n     hands of the majority if the proper appeal is made.\r\n\r\nB--\r\n\r\n     I have more or less definite opinions about Negroes. I\r\n     believe that as a race they are entitled to more leniency and\r\n     consideration than we would give to adult whites because as a\r\n     race they are not as mature as whites. I think it is unfortunate\r\n     that we have such a race question to deal with, but we ought\r\n     to meet it squarely and insist that under the law Negroes\r\n     are entitled to equal protection and equal consideration. I\r\n     do not believe in any attempt at social equality because the\r\n     antipathy between whites and Negroes is so acute that such\r\n     attempt would not only break down itself but it would lead to\r\n     serious race difficulties. I think the Negro race has as much\r\n     right to protect its race purity as the white race. I believe\r\n     Negro women are entitled to the same protection from white men\r\n     that we demand on behalf of white women against black men. I\r\n     believe Negroes should have decent housing conditions, proper\r\n     social outlets and opportunities to earn a living at the same\r\n     wages paid white men for the same class and character of work.\r\n     They should share equally in the benefits of government, with\r\n     particular reference to schools, bathing-beaches, playgrounds,\r\n     parks, etc. They should be protected against exploitation by\r\n     employers, property owners, merchants, etc.\r\n\r\n     I do think Negroes possess distinguishing traits of both\r\n     mentality and character. For many years now I have come into\r\n     more or less personal contact with Negroes. I have been in\r\n     contact with them in public schools, in colleges, in politics\r\n     and in civic work. I cannot say that any particular incidents\r\n     or experiences stand out in my memory.\r\n\r\n     My opinions are based upon my personal observation, personal\r\n     contacts with Negroes and discussions with other white persons\r\n     having independent contacts. As a child I had practically no\r\n     real contact of any kind with Negroes. I don't recall now\r\n     any Negro children in any of my primary grades, and while\r\n     there were Negroes in my native city, they were few and in a\r\n     neighborhood far removed from my own home. I imagine that I\r\n     was first conscious of a racial difference when I first saw\r\n     a Negro.\r\n\r\n     I don't recall any early prohibition against association with\r\n     Negroes although I do recall clearly that the attitude of my\r\n     family and associates, generally, was not one of approval.\r\n     Negroes were regarded as an inferior race, and I think as a\r\n     child I gathered the impression that contact with them was to\r\n     be avoided. My feeling is that if in normal circumstances I had\r\n     been thrown into more or less contact with Negroes, prohibition\r\n     against association, except where absolutely necessary, would\r\n     have been forthcoming.\r\n\r\n     I have never formally asked for information on the subject, but\r\n     I have discussed the matter with a good many people and have\r\n     given thought to it. I know a good many Negroes, not only in\r\n     Chicago but outside, but I don't know many of them intimately.\r\n     Among the leaders of the Negroes in Chicago are Dr. Bentley,\r\n     Dr. George C. Hall, Edward H. Morris, Edward H. Wright, Louis\r\n     B. Anderson, Oscar De Priest. In the United States, since\r\n     the death of Booker T. Washington, I imagine that two of the\r\n     outstanding men are Mr. Moton and Professor Du Bois.\r\n\r\n     I am a subscriber to the _Crisis_. In general my feeling is\r\n     that the tendency of this periodical is to stimulate and foster\r\n     race feeling among the Negroes. I don't say this critically. It\r\n     may be the best thing to do, considering all the circumstances,\r\n     and anything that will make for growth in self-respect,\r\n     character and initiative on the part of the Negroes is to be\r\n     commended even if, at the same time, race spirit is fostered\r\n     and developed.\r\n\r\n     Generally speaking, I find that discussion most frequently leads\r\n     to the Negroes when there are questions of lynching, race riots,\r\n     crimes or disturbances in which Negroes are involved. It also\r\n     comes up in connection with public schools, churches, parks\r\n     and public transportation systems. I had it arise recently in\r\n     connection with the Naval Academy at Annapolis. My experience\r\n     is that this subject is most frequently discussed among those\r\n     interested in social problems.\r\n\r\n     I used to think that the Negro question might be best solved\r\n     if the Negroes would be colonized in some favorable spot in\r\n     Africa under an American protectorate until they were capable\r\n     of self-government. I realize, however, that no such scheme\r\n     ought to be attempted if the Negroes obstinately objected, and\r\n     in that event I would see to it, if I had the power, that they\r\n     were protected from exploitation, were given a square deal\r\n     and had the equal protection of the laws. They should have\r\n     schools adequate to their needs and average living conditions.\r\n\r\n     I believe the Negro race should be educated, but I believe\r\n     at the same time that the most solid foundation for the race\r\n     is education in accordance with the ideas of the late Booker\r\n     T. Washington as I understand those ideas. While I think this\r\n     type of education will mean more for the race in the long run\r\n     I believe at the same time that individual Negroes should have\r\n     an opportunity fully to develop individual capacities.\r\n\r\n     I think there is an element of fear in the prejudice of\r\n     Negroes, but I don't think this is the chief element. I think\r\n     the real basis for this prejudice is a racial antipathy that\r\n     is instinctive and fundamental in the white race. I imagine\r\n     that in individual cases where this prejudice does not exist\r\n     it is not because it was not there originally, but because it\r\n     has been overcome by reason and education. It isn't unlikely\r\n     that this prejudice is in the main grounded upon an instinct\r\n     in the white race to keep its strain pure and strong.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that it isn't isolation so much as it is contact\r\n     that favors the development of race prejudice. If the Negroes\r\n     had never been brought out of Africa, we wouldn't feel the\r\n     prejudice that we do. Or, if they were restricted to one or\r\n     two southern states, prejudice in other parts of the country\r\n     would rapidly disappear. A community that has no Negro problem\r\n     is relatively free from prejudice. It is when the two races\r\n     come into contact that prejudices run riot and race conflicts\r\n     result. My own opinion is that if you should scatter the Negro\r\n     population throughout Chicago and its suburbs and put one\r\n     or two Negro families in every block, race prejudice would\r\n     increase enormously.\r\n\r\n     A minority of the population will not get complete justice\r\n     at the hands of an overwhelming majority. But this is true of\r\n     all minorities, whether racial, political, or religious. All\r\n     we can do is to keep working for an approximation to ideal\r\n     justice. A minority has the right to demand, and a majority\r\n     should be willing to grant, substantial justice and that is\r\n     all that can be expected in the present state of civilization.\r\n\r\nC--\r\n\r\n     My opinion is that we must cling to the ideal of Lincoln--the\r\n     right of every human being to equality in the real sense of\r\n     the term. I have found, however, that Negroes are dull and\r\n     sensitive. These opinions are based upon observation at Tuskegee\r\n     and in this school--[the Lewis Institute]. Among my outstanding\r\n     experiences is a visit made to Tuskegee and meeting Booker\r\n     T. Washington. The visit showed great hope for the Negro. As\r\n     a child I had no contact aside from living in the same city\r\n     with them.\r\n\r\n     It has always been considered unwise in the circles in which\r\n     I moved for whites and blacks to associate socially. I first\r\n     became conscious of a race difference when a very small\r\n     child--about three years of age.\r\n\r\n     Booker T. Washington, Cable, Dunbar, southerners and northerners\r\n     who have traveled in the South are probably best fitted to\r\n     speak for Negroes. I do inquire of both Negroes and whites\r\n     for information. The only Negroes I know are working people.\r\n     Robert Jackson, alderman, and Ed. Green, lawyer. Booker T.\r\n     Washington's successor. I have read one Negro paper. It was\r\n     insistent in a very fair way on the political rights of the\r\n     Negro. Good. Lynchings, lying, stealing, and the attacking of\r\n     little girls are the subject of discussion that most frequently\r\n     lead to the Negro, and these occur principally among men who\r\n     have seen Negroes socially and women who have hired them.\r\n\r\n     As a solution I would colonize them in Africa, and if they\r\n     objected I would use all peaceable means to force them to go.\r\n\r\n     Regarding the propositions: Their education should be increased\r\n     and the demands produced by education met.\r\n\r\n     Prejudice has its basis in race repulsion. Unless the isolation\r\n     is African colonization, there will be group prejudices.\r\n\r\n     Every man or group should demand and get complete justice.\r\n\r\nD--\r\n\r\n     I assume that it is a fact recognized by science that Negroes\r\n     are so different from whites that the two races cannot\r\n     be amalgamated. This fact interposes a barrier to social\r\n     relationships. I share in the general dislike of Negroes as\r\n     neighbors or traveling companions on the street cars. The white\r\n     race is responsible for the existence of the Negro problem in\r\n     America, and must submit patiently to the penalty for many years\r\n     to come. Lincoln's second inaugural is the best expression of\r\n     this thought. The Negro race is extraordinarily docile and easy\r\n     to handle. If surrounded by good living conditions and given a\r\n     proper education they would be good citizens. The progress of\r\n     their race since slavery, considering their many handicaps, has\r\n     been very creditable. The prejudice against them is probably\r\n     the most deep-seated of all American prejudices, and must be\r\n     reckoned with as one of the great factors in the problem.\r\n\r\n     In my opinion they are characterized by distinctly inferior\r\n     mentality, deficient moral sense, shiftlessness, good nature,\r\n     and a happy disposition. I have in mind no special facts,\r\n     authorities or sources of information on which I base my\r\n     opinions. I do, however, recognize the bearing of Christianity\r\n     on the problem, and find it impossible to formulate a viewpoint\r\n     which I can reconcile with the demands of Christianity.\r\n\r\n     We had a Negro family chauffeur some years ago who misconducted\r\n     himself so seriously as to have caused a very considerable\r\n     increase in the family prejudice against the race. If he had\r\n     been an Irish man our prejudice against him would not have\r\n     extended to his race. As a child I had no contacts with Negroes,\r\n     excepting one or two fellow-pupils in public schools of whom\r\n     I saw very little, and a few servants in the neighborhood who\r\n     were of the old-fashioned type, of pleasant memory.\r\n\r\n     I can recall no early prohibitions of association with Negroes.\r\n     There were so few in my neighborhood that they constituted no\r\n     real problem. As to implied prohibitions, I suppose I understood\r\n     at a very early age the existing social difference, although\r\n     I remember no instances of this.\r\n\r\n     I cannot remember when I first became conscious of a racial\r\n     difference, but I assume it was at a very early age.\r\n\r\n     I do not know that I can cite any friends, acquaintances,\r\n     favorite authors or scholars well fitted to speak with authority\r\n     on the question. Lincoln's views always seemed true to me, while\r\n     I have not been so favorably impressed by southern writers.\r\n     Every southerner I have ever met, no matter how reasonable\r\n     on other subjects, seemed to be incapable of looking at this\r\n     question with an open mind. His confidence that he knew all\r\n     about the Negro and the problem seemed absolute, and therefore\r\n     he was not in position to learn. I occasionally inquire for\r\n     information on this subject. Naturally most of the men of whom\r\n     I have made inquiries have been white, as I come in contact\r\n     with very few Negroes. I have, however, talked with Negroes\r\n     who have expressed their willingness to be segregated if the\r\n     segregation was complete enough to rid their district of all\r\n     whites, and give them fair living conditions. I cannot say that\r\n     I know any Negroes, although there are a few with whom I have\r\n     sufficient acquaintance to talk with them occasionally. As to\r\n     their leaders in Chicago, I have assumed that their political\r\n     leaders and their ministers were their leaders, the ministers\r\n     having a larger place of leadership than ministers among white\r\n     people. I used to come in contact occasionally with colored\r\n     lawyers who were capable men, and I believe leaders of their\r\n     race, and I understand that there is a colored physician, whose\r\n     name I cannot recall, who is the real leader of the best Negroes\r\n     in Chicago. Nationally I could not name any since the death\r\n     of Booker Washington, whom I very much admired, excepting Du\r\n     Bois whom I have heard speak, and with whose views I do not\r\n     sympathize. I do not remember ever reading a Negro periodical.\r\n\r\n     As I live on the South Side the subject of discussion most\r\n     frequently leading to the Negro is their encroachment on white\r\n     residence districts. Two years ago my church was given up to\r\n     a colored congregation, and the church into which we were\r\n     transferred is seriously threatened by the same invasion.\r\n     Property interests in a large part of the South Side bring up\r\n     the question, as does the unpleasantness of meeting them on the\r\n     street cars. I do not hear serious constructive discussion in\r\n     any circle. The invasion is deplored in all circles, social,\r\n     business, church and others.\r\n\r\n     I would not undertake to make any social adjustment on my\r\n     present information, except segregation of the Negroes in a\r\n     part of the South Side, and this only if it had the approval of\r\n     their own leaders. I do not approve of \"Jim Crow\" street cars\r\n     for Chicago, although I would not insist on their abandonment\r\n     in southern cities where they are already used, and I would\r\n     not favor any radical change if the better Negroes obstinately\r\n     objected.\r\n\r\n     I believe in educating Negroes, even though I am not sure\r\n     to what it will lead. I hope that as the race progresses the\r\n     prejudice against it will be modified. Still this prejudice is\r\n     so very great that I think it would be foolish for the Negroes\r\n     ever to seek a high station through demands. Probably many of\r\n     their demands should be granted, but they will make greater\r\n     progress by reckoning with the prejudice, and continuing their\r\n     present conciliatory attitude.\r\n\r\n     I do not believe that prejudice is based on fear. There is,\r\n     of course, a well-founded fear of many individual Negroes, but\r\n     I do not believe that the white race is conscious of any fear\r\n     of the Negro race as such. I think the prejudice is based on\r\n     the relative inferiority of the Negro race.\r\n\r\n     As a general proposition this is doubtless true that isolation\r\n     fosters prejudice. As applied to Negroes, however, it is\r\n     doubtful whether it would produce more conflict than the\r\n     present system. I would feel more hopeful of the overcoming\r\n     of the prejudice through more intimate contact with Negroes\r\n     if the difference between Negroes and white men were not so\r\n     fundamental.\r\n\r\n     As an abstract proposition the despotism of a majority cannot\r\n     be justified. I would say it is a very bad doctrine to spread\r\n     among a majority, but has in it a certain amount of practical\r\n     truth which the minority would do well to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nE--\r\n\r\n     Negroes do possess distinguishing traits of mentality and\r\n     character. My opinions are based upon my personal observation.\r\n\r\n     As I knew the Negro in the South he was inclined to be indolent,\r\n     shiftless and lacking in a high sense of honesty, though\r\n     religious. His disposition is a happy one, and often his good\r\n     will is shown in many ways of gratitude and faithfulness. These\r\n     traits I have seen expressed in service as servants, in the\r\n     cotton fields, in their homes, and on town streets. In Chicago,\r\n     when the Negro has long been a resident here, having larger\r\n     advantages in education and employment, I find the colored\r\n     man honest in business and other transactions, diligent at\r\n     work, and inoffensive, but firmly standing for his citizenship\r\n     rights, and wanting to live peaceably. My Chicago experience\r\n     has been principally as a physician visiting in Negro homes.\r\n\r\n     When a boy I worked in the cotton fields with Negroes, and\r\n     I attended some of their religious meetings for the sake of\r\n     amusement. It was a social law in the South that we must not\r\n     eat at the same table with Negroes, and we were not to sit\r\n     with colored people when riding on street cars or on trains.\r\n     However, if a Negro was driver of a horse and buggy, the most\r\n     beautiful and refined woman might sit on the same seat with\r\n     the colored driver. White people visiting a colored church\r\n     were given seats to themselves, usually front seats. Colored\r\n     children could not attend white schools. At the age of six when\r\n     I first saw Negroes, I became conscious of a race difference.\r\n\r\n     I regard Rev. John R. Hayworth as fitted to advise on the\r\n     question. I have sought information from about twenty-five\r\n     Negroes when in their midst as their physician. I am acquainted\r\n     with at least a dozen Negro families but can give the names\r\n     of only three. I consider Alderman De Priest, Mr. Lucas and\r\n     Colonel Jackson leading colored men; Dr. George Hall is also\r\n     well known. I have never read a Negro periodical.\r\n\r\n     In Chicago the subject of undesirable neighbors leads to the\r\n     discussion of Negroes in our neighborhood improvement clubs.\r\n\r\n     Believing that both black and white people prefer to live\r\n     separately, I would make agreeable provision for separate\r\n     locations in which each might live and in so doing abide by\r\n     the wish of the majority and enforce its dictates.\r\n\r\n     The Negro should be given the advantage of education, culture\r\n     and good employment. We should expect to grant him better\r\n     living conditions on account of such advantages.\r\n\r\n     Prejudice against the Negro has its principal basis in not\r\n     understanding him, as well as fear and an inborn dislike for\r\n     people of another race.\r\n\r\n     There never seemed to be any conflicts in the South because the\r\n     whites and blacks occupied separate parts of towns. Colored\r\n     people in the South seem to prefer to live in communities to\r\n     themselves, because a bond of sympathy holds them together.\r\n\r\n     It is better for a minority to bear an injustice than for an\r\n     overwhelming majority to bear an injustice.\r\n\r\nF--\r\n\r\n     Negroes should have the same rights as we.\r\n\r\n     I know of no distinguishing traits.\r\n\r\n     My opinion is based largely on reading, as I never lived in\r\n     the South. I had no early contacts. There were few Negroes\r\n     near, and none in my schools. As authorities I would mention\r\n     Professor Du Bois, Fannie B. Williams, Professor Graham Taylor.\r\n     I know an able colored woman, a member of the Chicago Woman's\r\n     Club and women who have worked in our home.\r\n\r\n     Occasionally I read a Negro periodical.\r\n\r\n     The discussion of lynchings and riots at home and church lead\r\n     most frequently to the Negro.\r\n\r\n     Our schools, trades and professions should be opened to Negroes\r\n     and they be permitted to take care of themselves. Let them\r\n     follow their own bent so long as it injures no one else.\r\n\r\n     Of course, when you educate Negroes you increase their demands.\r\n     Grant their demands.\r\n\r\n     Egotism and the jealousy that we whites are better are the\r\n     basis of prejudice.\r\n\r\n     It is true that a minority has no right to expect complete\r\n     justice from the majority, if Negroes reason from experience;\r\n     but the colored race probably has idealists who hope for better\r\n     future treatment.\r\n\r\nG--\r\n\r\n     The trouble is with the whites; selfishness and pride have\r\n     caused the situation and the regulation of the Negro according\r\n     to faulty concepts of right will always fail. The Stock Yards\r\n     riots gave proof of equality in passion, cowardliness, and\r\n     unfairness between blacks and whites.\r\n\r\n     Negroes lag in evolution through hinderment. They may put\r\n     reason above emotion as they develop mentally, as do cultured\r\n     whites, but a better evolution may bring trained intuition\r\n     from crude emotion.\r\n\r\n     My opinions are based upon short trips South, residence in\r\n     Louisville and northern contacts, plus general reading.\r\n\r\n     My only contacts are on the streets.\r\n\r\n     Children's talk and the term \"Nigger\" just called my attention\r\n     to a race difference.\r\n\r\n     I know a few highly educated Negro pastors. I never read\r\n     Negro papers. The subject of interracial marriage leads to\r\n     the discussion of the Negro.\r\n\r\n     As a solution they should be distributed without boundaries,\r\n     among whites, as to residence, occupation and society. They\r\n     would not object; it is what they fight for--equality.\r\n\r\n     Negro faults are the result of retarded mental growth. Why\r\n     further retard them? The problem ceases to be as their mental\r\n     level rises. Prejudice is the result of selfishness in whites.\r\n     Your third proposition is absolutely true.\r\n\r\n     Injustice to the minority by the majority is unconstitutional,\r\n     un-Christian and unwise.\r\n\r\nH--\r\n\r\n     My opinion is that the Negro is entitled to life, liberty,\r\n     and the pursuit of happiness as well as the white. The very\r\n     fact that his skin is differently colored than mine is no\r\n     reason why he should not be free to develop himself mentally,\r\n     morally, and physically the same as I do. Observation is basis\r\n     of my opinion. No contacts or warnings as a child. No friends\r\n     particularly familiar with question.\r\n\r\n     I have given this matter some little consideration, and have\r\n     discussed it with some Negroes as well as many white men. It\r\n     is my opinion that the consensus of opinion among Negroes to\r\n     whom I have talked is that they have no particular desire to\r\n     mix socially with the white man, but that they do feel they\r\n     should be given opportunity for development along those lines\r\n     for which they are best fitted. I am not acquainted particularly\r\n     with any of the leaders in this movement anywhere.\r\n\r\n     I read no Negro periodical. Racial equality is the subject\r\n     that leads to the Negro.\r\n\r\n     In all circles where general subjects are usually discussed\r\n     the question of the Negro arises.\r\n\r\n     Until the white man is ready to give the Negro a square\r\n     deal, I would suggest that he be segregated, and given every\r\n     opportunity for development possible under such segregation.\r\n     If they objected I would insist upon majority rule.\r\n\r\n     Nothing is gained by keeping the Negro ignorant, any more than\r\n     would be gained by keeping the white man ignorant. Education\r\n     of all of our races will bring about the world's salvation.\r\n\r\n     Prejudice among white women has its basis in fear but not\r\n     particularly among men. This is partly due to the publicity\r\n     given to all acts against women by Negroes, in my judgment.\r\n\r\n     The history of the world has proved that most of the races on\r\n     earth tend to group themselves, which is the natural thing,\r\n     because of the community of interest.\r\n\r\n     Until the Golden Rule is accepted unanimously majority rule\r\n     will continue to be the human law and under our present world\r\n     political arrangements, it seems to be about as fair as any\r\n     arrangement could be.\r\n\r\nI--\r\n\r\n     The Negro seems to me to be evolutionally handicapped, but\r\n     possesses the qualities of children--imitativeness, affection,\r\n     loyalty, receptiveness, lack of responsibility, carelessness,\r\n     improvidence. They also seem to me to lack racial pride, for\r\n     which their history in this country may well account. There\r\n     are fine Negroes and those who are as worthless as \"poor white\r\n     trash.\" To judge them all by either the best or the worst would\r\n     be manifestly unfair. I feel that they have, as a race, never\r\n     had a fair chance for their finest development.\r\n\r\n     I have lived among them and practiced medicine in their families\r\n     for ten years.\r\n\r\n     The most tender, loving service, beyond monetary recompense,\r\n     of one Negro woman who worked in my family for ten years. Her\r\n     intimate, gentle, faithful services to members of my family\r\n     in health and sickness will always endear her to us and make\r\n     us more conscious of the possibilities of members of that race.\r\n\r\n     The community in which I was raised had so few Negroes\r\n     that there was no occasion for contacts or prohibitions to\r\n     association. I suppose as a boy I first became conscious of\r\n     race difference.\r\n\r\n     I have discussed this question with intelligent Negroes, have\r\n     heard some fine sermons by Negro preachers, and am somewhat\r\n     familiar with the writings of Booker T. Washington and Du Bois.\r\n\r\n     I do not read their periodicals.\r\n\r\n     Mention of the servant cited in a foregoing question, newspaper\r\n     accounts of lynchings, house-bombings most frequently lead to\r\n     discussion of Negroes among our personal friends.\r\n\r\n     I feel that Negroes would be happier if segregated in\r\n     neighborhoods which allowed contact with the dominant race. I\r\n     feel that they are as unhappy to be isolated among whites as\r\n     the whites would be to be isolated among Negroes. I feel they\r\n     should have the right to live under decent conditions, with\r\n     those things which make life livable and enjoyable. Probably\r\n     part of my unwillingness to have them for neighbors lies\r\n     in the fear of undesirable neighbors (bad citizens), in the\r\n     fear of property depreciation which would follow, and because\r\n     of the lack of interests in common that make for neighborly\r\n     intercourse. I suppose I am as inconsistent as others in this,\r\n     for in my heart I have no prejudice of which I am aware, yet I\r\n     believe I am infected with the universal indefinite prejudice,\r\n     if I could but analyze it thoroughly.\r\n\r\n     Their education should not be curtailed, but enlarged. Their\r\n     demands should be granted if not incompatible with the common\r\n     good.\r\n\r\n     It is probably true that prejudice is based on fear, a result of\r\n     the abuse of female slaves by the whites in slavery time, and\r\n     the resultant desire on the part of a few Negroes engendered\r\n     during the reconstruction period by the carpet-baggers, to\r\n     have social equality. I have discussed this subject of \"social\r\n     equality\" with intelligent, fine Negroes, and believe they\r\n     meant what they said when they assured me that among decent\r\n     Negroes there is no more desire for this than there is among\r\n     the white people. I feel that it is a bugaboo, useful in\r\n     increasing fear and prejudice against the Negro.\r\n\r\n     By segregation, I did not mean isolation, but the natural\r\n     grouping together of Negroes under wholesome conditions, but\r\n     which permitted their contact through employment, through\r\n     meetings for the common good, with the dominant race.\r\n\r\n     Even a minority has the right to expect and demand justice\r\n     in opportunity to develop industrial, social and spiritual\r\n     growth. I recognize that education of both whites and blacks is\r\n     necessary to overcome fear and prejudice and make this possible.\r\n\r\nJ--\r\n\r\n     My opinion, which is still open to conviction, is that the\r\n     Negro race overlaps the white race throughout the bulk of the\r\n     frequency curves of distribution of intelligence of the two\r\n     races; but the average of the Negro race is probably lower\r\n     than that of the white race, and among the extreme varieties\r\n     the Negroes probably go lower and the whites higher than the\r\n     similar varieties of the other race. This refers to distribution\r\n     of inherent capacity. But I believe that many of them are\r\n     modifiable and differ only in their average distribution from\r\n     similar qualities in whites. Also that certain distinguishing\r\n     traits may be so adjusted to the circumstances under which\r\n     Negroes are educated and employed as to be distinctly\r\n     advantageous, both to themselves and to society.\r\n\r\n     Aside from my conversation with southerners, I have made\r\n     a special study of the Negro problem in connection with my\r\n     undergraduate work, and again at the University of Pennsylvania.\r\n     I am familiar with a number of worth-while sources which can\r\n     be listed on request. I lived for four winters in St. Louis,\r\n     where I saw a great many Negroes, but knew none. Some excitement\r\n     was caused there by an instructor inviting a mulatto school\r\n     principal to address our sociology class. There was no protest\r\n     here in Evanston. I also passed through the South, and stopped\r\n     twice at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n     As a child in Portland, Oregon, I had two Negro nurses. At the\r\n     age of perhaps seven or eight years, one of my nurses returned\r\n     for a visit, and I was teased by companions for kissing her.\r\n     That was my first consciousness of a racial difference.\r\n\r\n     My authorities and sources of importance are the N.A.A.C.P.,\r\n     Urban League, the Race Relations Commission, and certain\r\n     Negroes. I might also mention the two Spingarns and Mr. Roger\r\n     Baldwin. I know C. S. Johnson, T. Arnold Hill and the colored\r\n     members of the Commission, together with the union leaders whom\r\n     I heard. W. E. B. Du Bois, Haynes, Dr. Roman, J. W. Johnson,\r\n     T. A. Hill, I regard as leaders among the Negroes.\r\n\r\n     I read the _Crisis_, and occasional newspapers. The _Crisis_\r\n     is good except the fiction; the newspapers are rather poor.\r\n\r\n     Race relations, mob action, venereal disease, and housing\r\n     questions lead to discussion of the Negro.\r\n\r\n     As a solution I suggest equal facilities, spontaneous\r\n     segregation, spontaneous co-operation in common interest,\r\n     education in matters of sex. In this program there would be\r\n     no compulsion involved--unless possibly upon the whites.\r\n\r\n     Their education should be modified and their demands granted\r\n     so far as they can be harmonized with the general good.\r\n\r\n     The main question involved in prejudice seems to me whether\r\n     it is an interest or an instinct. If it is an interest then\r\n     changes in social organization may with comparative ease abate\r\n     the fear and the prejudice. If it is an instinct then we can\r\n     only deal with it by repression and sublimation of a more\r\n     deeply psychological character.\r\n\r\n     I question whether the prejudice is greater the greater the\r\n     isolation. The word isolation should be analyzed into physical\r\n     or economic on the one hand, and psychological on the other.\r\n\r\n     Plato asked, \"What is justice?\" The answer can never be final,\r\n     and one's concept of it is usually colored by interest. A\r\n     sociological definition of justice is in terms of harmony\r\n     or harmonization of interests. Complete harmony never does\r\n     exist, else we should have no thought and no progress, but\r\n     harmonization of interests can be a continuous process, and\r\n     is not irreconcilable with the existence of minorities and\r\n     majorities.\r\n\r\nK--\r\n\r\n     I have formed no definite opinions about Negroes. I am inclined\r\n     to the opinion that generally the balance is found on the\r\n     side of the white races. In general I believe they possess\r\n     distinguishing traits of mentality and character. I find it\r\n     very difficult, however, to define my opinion regarding this.\r\n\r\n     When I was in high school in Petersburg, Illinois, from 1895 to\r\n     1898, the school had an attendance of about forty. There were\r\n     two Negroes, a boy and a girl. The boy's name was John Gaddie.\r\n     I have the impression now that they both acted as though they\r\n     were out of place. I found John a likeable boy. I think all\r\n     of the members of the school liked him. I particularly liked\r\n     him, so paid considerable attention to him, to which John\r\n     reacted in a decided manner. He never forgot it. I do not like\r\n     to shake hands with Negroes. I avoid it whenever I can, but\r\n     I never had any hesitancy in shaking hands with John. After\r\n     finishing school, I went to college and John went to work. His\r\n     work was some sort of manual labor. From time to time when I\r\n     went back to Petersburg I saw John, always spoke to him, shook\r\n     hands with him and talked to him. John appreciated this very\r\n     much and acted as though he regarded it a condescension on my\r\n     part. I am not aware that I feel toward any other Negro as I\r\n     feel toward John Gaddie.\r\n\r\n     I was first conscious of a racial difference when I first\r\n     knew the Negro, which was when I was about fifteen years of\r\n     age. In the small town of Petersburg (about 3,000 inhabitants)\r\n     the Negroes there, as here in Chicago, lived in a segregated\r\n     district. There were no clashes between the Negro and the\r\n     whites but the racial difference was obvious enough.\r\n\r\n     I know very few Negroes. I know too little to be in a position\r\n     to consider anyone as a leader among the colored people in\r\n     Chicago or the United States. I never read a Negro periodical.\r\n     The subjects most frequently leading to the discussion of the\r\n     Negro are riots, housing problems, certain industrial problems,\r\n     and, here in Chicago, politics.\r\n\r\n     The fact that the Negroes obstinately objected quite logically\r\n     would not interfere with making any adjustment which seemed\r\n     \"wise.\" The social adjustment which seemed \"wise\" would have\r\n     to be based on the possibility of objection on the part of\r\n     the Negro. If the leaders were obstinate, some other solution\r\n     would have to be worked out, but if the leaders saw that it\r\n     was wise and for the best interest of the masses I would insist\r\n     that the plan be tried out.\r\n\r\n     I do not comprehend what is meant by \"demand.\" It may mean\r\n     ambition for social standing in the sense of intermingling with\r\n     the whites. It may mean other things. No matter what it means,\r\n     I am not impressed, if the statement is true, that it is any\r\n     reason for not educating the Negro. I am not impressed that\r\n     it becomes necessary either to curtail or modify the Negro's\r\n     education or to grant their demands whatever they may be.\r\n\r\n     I do not think it true that prejudice has its basis in fear.\r\n\r\n     So far as I am familiar with it there is naturally a very\r\n     high degree of segregation of the Negro as to living quarters\r\n     everywhere. I am not aware that the segregation which we now\r\n     find of habitation brings about the development of special group\r\n     prejudices. Undoubtedly, if there are or were such prejudices\r\n     they would form the background of conflicts. It doesn't seem\r\n     to me to follow that the greater the isolation the greater\r\n     the prejudice.\r\n\r\n     There never is complete justice; but if a minority may not\r\n     expect justice at the hands of an overwhelming majority it can\r\n     expect no justice at all. The justice, if it comes at all, will\r\n     be at the hands of an overwhelming majority. Theoretically, in\r\n     this country all are entitled to justice. I know no reason why\r\n     this should not be true in a practical sense. Furthermore, I\r\n     see no reason why a minority may not only expect but demand,\r\n     at the hands of an overwhelming majority, justice. It seems\r\n     to me that if the overwhelming majority hoped to prosper, it\r\n     would see to it that justice was dispensed to the minority.\r\n     I do not find myself ready to place the Negro on an equal\r\n     basis with the white in every respect, that is, socially and\r\n     otherwise. I do not regard the failure to so place the Negroes\r\n     as injustice to them.\r\n\r\nL--\r\n\r\n     In general, I like the Negro, but I lament his presence in\r\n     this country in large numbers. I have never heard a solution of\r\n     the Negro problem. Their distinguishing traits are ignorance,\r\n     good nature, mental weakness, and physical strength.\r\n\r\n     I have never heard of good arguments for extensive isolation.\r\n\r\nM--\r\n\r\n     I have a strong prejudice, but it is undefined. For instance,\r\n     the hair of Negroes always holds a peculiar fascination, but\r\n     under no consideration could I touch it, but there was always\r\n     a great curiosity about it. I was undecided whether or not I\r\n     should shake hands or in any way touch a colored skin, but I\r\n     am quite sure I would never do it from choice. The everyday\r\n     contacts on street cars are the only personal experiences I\r\n     have had. The fascination of watching them is constant.\r\n\r\n     When I was about two years old a family moved into the village\r\n     bringing with them an old colored nurse. She was too old to\r\n     work, and my childish remembrance is that she always sat in\r\n     the corner near the fireplace with a pipe in her mouth. I did\r\n     not know that the Negro could do anything else.\r\n\r\n     When I was about five years old a Negro came to the village\r\n     and opened a barber shop. I remember my father telling mother\r\n     about the Negro and how he took the three small children down\r\n     to see \"Snowball\" as a matter of curiosity. My reaction was\r\n     that the Negro was not a person such as I was accustomed to\r\n     seeing, although there was no feeling of classing him as an\r\n     animal.\r\n\r\n     The third contact came when I was half-grown. My father was\r\n     prominent in politics and on election day the table was kept\r\n     set so that anyone sent from the polls could have a meal.\r\n     By some chance a Negro was sent and ate. After he had gone I\r\n     remember seeing my mother take the plate and other dishes out\r\n     in the yard and scour them with brick dust, evidently with an\r\n     idea that something had rubbed off.\r\n\r\n     My information is largely taken from the books of Booker T.\r\n     Washington. I admired Dunbar's poems when they were current in\r\n     the newspapers and magazines. I have not seen any of them for\r\n     many years but remember vividly, \"When the Bread Won't Raise.\"\r\n     I was naturally familiar with _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, both as a\r\n     book and a play in Civil War days. I do not consciously seek\r\n     for information on the subject of Negroes and do not personally\r\n     know any Negroes. Outside of the names which appear in the\r\n     press I do not know of any Negro leaders and could not be sure\r\n     of correct information as to those who are well known.\r\n\r\n     I have never seen a Negro periodical and have so rarely heard\r\n     Negroes discussed that no conclusions can be given. The Negro\r\n     is rarely a topic of conversation in my circle.\r\n\r\n     As a solution they might be nationalized if possible, somewhere\r\n     and somehow, like the Japs. Liberia is a failure largely\r\n     because of white leadership and policy. Some portion of the\r\n     earth should be set aside where the Negroes can be a nation,\r\n     perhaps in Africa. They have a right to work out their own\r\n     problems in their own ways.\r\n\r\n     All Negroes should be educated as highly as possible. They have\r\n     a right to it because they are Americans. If demands follow\r\n     this education, it is right they should be granted.\r\n\r\n     There is no personal fear of Negroes as a basis of my prejudice.\r\n\r\n     I agree with the third proposition as to isolation.\r\n\r\n     Majority's injustice to minority is always true in politics,\r\n     religion, everyday dealings. Is not peculiar to relations\r\n     between white and colored.\r\n\r\nN--\r\n\r\n     My views are more impressions than opinions. I have a distinct\r\n     aversion to close association with Negroes generally. On the\r\n     other hand I have a distinct liking for particular Negroes\r\n     whom I have been thrown with. Aside from the more educated\r\n     ones, they seem to me to be of a sluggish mentality and of\r\n     somewhat low moral character. They seem to have more of the\r\n     animal in them. I am not sure that this is not an impression\r\n     rather than an opinion.\r\n\r\n     I have no basis for my views except my own experience and what\r\n     I have read in papers and periodicals.\r\n\r\n     I had two Negro classmates in college; I saw a good deal of\r\n     Negroes as a boy; and I have known Negroes, some well educated,\r\n     since I came to Chicago from the law school.\r\n\r\n     Although my contacts were largely casual, I particularly\r\n     remember one very old Negro man whom I regarded as a sort\r\n     of patriarch and of whom I was a little bit afraid. Then I\r\n     recall vividly my impression of the filth and sordidness of\r\n     \"darky-town\" in the small city in which I lived as a boy. I\r\n     was never forbidden, so far as I can remember, to associate\r\n     with Negroes. In public school there was no separation of the\r\n     races. As a small boy, it seems to me my playmates in school\r\n     were partly Negroes. Of course the Negroes, as is usual, lived\r\n     in a separate part of the city. I should say that this seemed\r\n     to me then to be a natural and necessary arrangement. Negroes\r\n     were black and we were white. That was about all there was to\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     Very early I became race conscious, I should say along about\r\n     the fourth or fifth grade in school, perhaps even before.\r\n\r\n     I regard as authorities on the question teachers or officers\r\n     of Fisk University, Tuskegee Institute, those who have to do\r\n     with criminals; employers of Negroes; persons who have dealt\r\n     with Negroes as a class as well as individually. Booker T.\r\n     Washington's writings should be an authority.\r\n\r\n     I have made very few inquiries for information. I know few\r\n     Negroes in Chicago. Those that I do know are of the better\r\n     educated type. Some of them, I think, have been at Fisk\r\n     University. I do not know the leaders in the city, nor do I\r\n     know the leaders in the country; but I should say they are\r\n     the heads of the great Negro universities and colleges, like\r\n     Fisk, Tuskegee, Lincoln Institute. Booker Washington was, of\r\n     course, a leader. I do not know who his successors are.\r\n\r\n     So far as I know, I have seen only one Negro periodical, some\r\n     years ago. The article I read in it I happened to be interested\r\n     in because I was dealing with the subject of it, and it was\r\n     undoubtedly a prejudiced article founded on misinformation and\r\n     a rather wilful disregard of facts. As I recall the paper as\r\n     a whole its main motive and purpose was an apparent hatred of\r\n     the white race. I realize that this is not enough to base an\r\n     opinion on.\r\n\r\n     The discussion of labor, politics, especially questions\r\n     connected with southern politics, almost any question relating\r\n     to the South, education, home missions, living conditions,\r\n     the servant problem, crime, most frequently lead to the Negro.\r\n\r\n     It would hardly be feasible to send Negroes out of the country\r\n     as a whole; they are needed in the industrial world, and it\r\n     would not be a Christian act to deport them. Nor does it seem\r\n     right or practicable or just to segregate them entirely. They\r\n     need education and the help that comes from association with\r\n     those who are further along in the polite amenities. On the\r\n     other hand, unless they are somewhat segregated racial troubles\r\n     are sure to arise when a Negro tries to settle, say, in the\r\n     same block with upper class whites. I am not sure that it might\r\n     not be a good plan if one or two of the southern states could\r\n     be turned over to the Negroes, but if this is done they should\r\n     be allowed to govern themselves and should be protected from\r\n     exploitation from unscrupulous whites.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that race prejudice is not based principally\r\n     on fear, but rather on a natural aversion or shrinking from a\r\n     man of another color. It is almost as elemental as fear. We\r\n     fear any uneducated, ignorant and brutal man, whether he be\r\n     white, red, black or yellow. We have an aversion, as I have\r\n     said, to close association with any man of another color, even\r\n     though he be educated. I do not know whether this aversion is\r\n     curable by any method or not.\r\n\r\n     I am inclined to agree with the third proposition, and I\r\n     suppose the fourth proposition is regrettably true.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature in the answers to the queries: \"Have you formed\r\ndefinite opinions about Negroes?\" and \"Do Negroes, in your opinion,\r\npossess distinguishing traits of mentality or character?\" is the great\r\nvariation in opinions. As a race they are \"shiftless,\" \"childish,\"\r\n\"docile,\" \"evolutionarily handicapped,\" \"undependable,\" \"some of\r\nthem good,\" \"they have as a mass a lower level of inherent capacity,\"\r\n\"disliked in the mass,\" \"liked as individuals,\" \"entitled to the same\r\nleniency and consideration as whites,\" \"entitled to the same rights as\r\nwhites,\" \"lacking in racial pride,\" \"loyal,\" \"imitative,\" \"affectionate,\"\r\n\"improvident.\"\r\n\r\nThe feelings toward Negroes are as varied. There is aversion to close\r\nassociation, a distinct dislike, a desire that Negroes should have equal\r\nrights and privileges, a desire that they should have the same rights, a\r\nfeeling that Negroes have been mistreated and exploited, a feeling that\r\nselfishness and pride of white persons have caused the present racial\r\nsituation, and a conviction that present behavior toward the Negro is\r\nfaulty and wrong. Lincoln is twice mentioned but with different meanings.\r\nThe trend of sentiment, while unfavorable toward Negroes, maintains some\r\nsort of ideal. Although childish, they \"must be trained,\" \"although we\r\ndislike their presence, we must submit to our penalty for years to come,\"\r\netc. Some are not sure of their opinions. Some call them impressions or\r\nregret a lack of knowledge. A general summing up would show a desire to\r\nbe fair in spite of unfavorable opinions.\r\n\r\nThe questions regarding the disposition they would make of Negroes if they\r\ncould entirely control the situation were put to get views uninfluenced\r\nby considerations of present practicability. The play of circumstances,\r\nopinion, ethical considerations, and difficulties were excluded from\r\nconsideration. The trend of replies was toward segregation, even to\r\nthe extent of colonization in Africa. There were curious anomalies,\r\nlike segregation without Jim Crow and segregation for the Negro's own\r\nhappiness. Others would distribute them without boundaries throughout the\r\nsocial system. When segregation is generally mentioned it is conditioned\r\non the consent of Negroes.\r\n\r\nInteresting answers are made on propositions (_a_), (_b_), (_c_), and\r\n(_d_), covering education, prejudice, isolation, and justice. In spite\r\nof unforeseen danger, it is pretty generally agreed that Negroes should\r\nbe educated, even though their demands are thus increased. There is less\r\nagreement on granting demands. The analysis of prejudice brought a wide\r\nvariety of opinions. Repulsion, natural aversion, social equality and\r\nthe sex complex, selfishness of whites, egotism and inborn dislike, as\r\nwell as fear, are accredited as forming the basis of prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe problem of isolation was essentially a problem of segregation. Strange\r\nto say, although the trend of some was toward isolation, there was a\r\nmajority belief that isolation would increase conflict and friction. The\r\nethical problem developed in general the opinion that there does exist\r\na disparity between what is and what should be.\r\n\r\nThe unwisdom of an unjust course of social conduct is recognized, but\r\nis for the most part held to be warranted by the peculiar difficulty\r\nof present relations. Here, probably as nowhere else, the problem was\r\ncompared with other general problems not involving race.\r\n\r\nThe experiences on which opinions are based divide into definite classes:\r\n\r\n1. Experiences in the South.\r\n\r\n2. Experiences with individual Negro servants.\r\n\r\n3. Experiences with individual Negroes of intelligence.\r\n\r\n4. General observation.\r\n\r\nThe actual basis of opinions as stated by the persons themselves provides\r\nan interesting question.\r\n\r\nThe question concerning early childhood experiences was put to draw\r\nout, if possible, impressions unconsciously insinuated or consciously\r\nobtained but perhaps discounted and forgotten through subsequent years of\r\nintermittent relations. It was successful in bringing to light incidents\r\nof striking significance. The answers, indeed, show striking elements in\r\nthe heritage of racial consciousness. Impressions gained in early life\r\nrequire many facts to unsettle or remove.\r\n\r\nMost important in considering the trustworthiness of information sources\r\nare the replies to the question: \"Whom of your friends, acquaintances,\r\nfavorite authors, scholars, etc., do you regard best fitted to speak with\r\nauthority on the question?\" There are mentioned seven Negroes and ten\r\nwhite persons. Of the four local Negroes mentioned, two might be regarded\r\nas well informed; one has been out of public life for fifteen years,\r\nand the other, although by no means an authority, probably could provide\r\ninteresting information. Of the Negro national figures, Washington, Du\r\nBois, and Dunbar are mentioned, Washington three times, Dunbar and Du\r\nBois once. Booker T. Washington died in 1915. Paul Laurence Dunbar, the\r\npoet, died in 1906. Practically all of the white persons mentioned have\r\nbeen at some time connected with movements to improve conditions among\r\nNegroes. George W. Cable wrote for the most part stories of the Creole\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, though, that in answering the question, \"Who are the Negro\r\nleaders?\" so many gave the names of politicians, who are not the real\r\nleaders of Negroes. About half of those who answered had never read a\r\nNegro periodical, and half of those who had read them considered their\r\ninfluence pernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. PUBLIC OPINION AS EXPRESSED BY NEGROES\r\n\r\nThe practice of \"keeping the Negro in his place\" or any modification of\r\nit in northern communities has isolated Negroes from all other members\r\nof the community. Though in the midst of an advanced social system and\r\nsurrounded by cultural influences, they have hardly been more than exposed\r\nto them. Of full and free participation they know little. The pressure\r\nof the dominant white group in practically every ordinary experience has\r\nkept the attention and interests of Negroes centered upon themselves,\r\nand made them race conscious. Their thinking on general questions is\r\ncontrolled by their race interests. The opinions of Negroes, therefore,\r\nare in large measure a negative product.\r\n\r\nIt is probably for this reason that most of their expressions of opinion\r\ntake the form of protest. This same enforced self-interest warps these\r\nopinions, giving exaggerated values to the unconsidered views of the\r\nlarger group, increasing sensitiveness to slights, and keeping Negroes\r\nforever on the defensive. Extreme expressions, unintelligible to those\r\noutside the Negro group, are a natural result of this isolation. The\r\nprocesses of thought by which these opinions are reached are, by virtue\r\nof this very isolation, concealed from outsiders. Negroes by their words\r\nalone may often be judged as radical, pernicious, or fanatic. Without\r\nthe background of their experiences it is no more possible for their\r\nviews to be completely understood than for Negroes to understand the\r\nconfessed prejudices of white persons, or even their ordinary feelings\r\ntoward Negroes.\r\n\r\nNegroes know more of the habits of action and thought of the white\r\ngroup than white people know of similar habits in the Negro group. For\r\nNegroes read the whites' books and papers, hear them talk, and sometimes\r\nsee them in the intimacy of their homes. But this one-sided and partial\r\nunderstanding serves only to make the behavior of the whites more keenly\r\nfelt. Until these differences, long held as taboo, are thoroughly\r\nunderstood and calmly faced, there is small chance of satisfactory\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of Negroes on this question are as various as the white\r\nopinions of the Negro. Their response may reflect, the sentiment of the\r\nlarger group; it may take a conciliatory turn, or, it may be exclusively\r\nself-centered in disregard, if indeed not in defiance, of the white\r\ngroup. The rapid growth of the Garvey movement[80] is a good example of\r\nthis last type of opinion. There is harmony of opinion on ultimates, but\r\non programs, processes, and methods there are differences among Negroes\r\nthat reach the intensity of abusive conflicts.\r\n\r\nNo Negro is willing to admit that he belongs to a different and lower\r\nspecies, or that his race is constitutionally weak in character. All\r\nNegroes hope for an adjustment by virtue of which they will be freely\r\ngranted the privileges of ordinary citizens. They are conscious, however,\r\nof an opposition in the traditions of the country and actually meet\r\nit daily. Conflict arises from opinions as to methods of combating and\r\novercoming the opposition with the greatest gain and smallest loss to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThus we come to hear of different schools of thought among Negroes.\r\nBooker T. Washington is contrasted with W. E. B. Du Bois, and Du Bois is\r\ncontrasted with Owen, Peyton, and Colson, and they, in turn are contrasted\r\nwith Garvey. Among individual Negroes opinion is determined by experience\r\nas well as tradition. The Negro house-servant does not feel toward white\r\npersons as does a Negro common laborer. The independent professional man\r\nholds an opinion essentially different from the social worker. Yet they\r\nare all governed by those trends of sentiment protective of the Negro\r\ngroup, and in crises either act upon them or suffer the group's censure.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the strength of Negro group opinion appeared in a tragic\r\nby-product of the Chicago riot. A Negro prominent in local political and\r\nsocial circles was sought out as a leader, and asked for an interview by\r\na reporter of the _Chicago Tribune_ during the riot. In the published\r\ninterview he was reported as saying: \"This is a white man's country,\r\nand Negroes had better behave or they will get what rights they have\r\ntaken away.\" This aroused a solid Negro sentiment against him; his life\r\nwas threatened; for several weeks he had to have police protection; he\r\nwas finally ostracized; and in less than a year he died. His friends\r\nasserted that he was slanderously misquoted, and that his death was due\r\nlargely to the resulting criticism.\r\n\r\nThe more balanced opinions may be found among Negroes who have developed\r\na defensive philosophy. Race pride and racial solidarity have sprung from\r\nthis necessity. The term radical is used to characterize Negroes whose\r\nviews and preachments are in advocacy of changes which to the general\r\nwhite public appear undesirable. It will be observed that most of the\r\nso-called radicals are southern Negroes now living in the North. They\r\nknow by experience the meaning of oppression. Contrasts with them are\r\nsharper and the desire for change is more insistent, because they can\r\nappreciate differences.\r\n\r\nFrequently this \"radicalism\" is no more than a matter of interpretation by\r\nwhite persons and possibly an oversuspicion. For example, Attorney-General\r\nA. Mitchell Palmer, in his report on the investigations of his department,\r\nreferred to the bitter protests of Negro publications against lynching\r\nand disfranchisement as radical and incendiary documents. This report\r\nis headed, \"Radicalism and Sedition among the Negroes as Reflected in\r\nTheir Publications.\" It reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     There can no longer be any question of a well-concerted movement\r\n     among a certain class of Negro leaders of thought and action\r\n     to constitute themselves a determined and persistent source of\r\n     a radical opposition to the government, and to the established\r\n     rule of law and order.\r\n\r\n     Among the more salient points to be noted in the present\r\n     attitude of the Negro leaders are, first, the ill-governed\r\n     reaction toward race rioting; second, the threat of retaliatory\r\n     measures in connection with lynching; third, the more openly\r\n     expressed demand for social equality, in which demand the sex\r\n     problem is not infrequently included; fourth, the identification\r\n     of the Negro with such radical organizations as the I.W.W. and\r\n     an outspoken advocacy of the Bolsheviki or Soviet doctrines;\r\n     fifth, the political stand assumed toward the present federal\r\n     administration, the South in general, and incidentally, toward\r\n     the peace treaty and the League of Nations. Underlying these\r\n     more salient viewpoints is the increasingly emphasized feeling\r\n     of a race consciousness in many of these publications always\r\n     antagonistic to the white race and openly, defiantly assertive\r\n     of its own equality and even superiority. When it is borne in\r\n     mind that this boast finds its most frequent expression in the\r\n     pages of those journals whose editors are men of education, and\r\n     in at least one instance, by men holding degrees conferred by\r\n     Harvard University, it may be seen that the boast is not to be\r\n     dismissed lightly as the ignorant vaporing of untrained minds.\r\n     Neither is the influence of the Negro press in general to be\r\n     reckoned with lightly. The _Negro World_ for October 18, 1919,\r\n     states that \"there are a dozen Negro papers with a circulation\r\n     of over 20,000, and scores with smaller circulation. There\r\n     are half a dozen magazines with a large circulation and other\r\n     magazines with a smaller circulation, and there are easily over\r\n     fifty writers who can write interesting editorials and special\r\n     articles, written in fine, pure English, with a background of\r\n     scholarship behind them.\" Notwithstanding the clumsiness of\r\n     expression of this particular assertion, the claim is not an\r\n     idle one. It may be added that in several instances the Negro\r\n     magazines are expensive in manufacture, being on coated paper\r\n     throughout, well-printed, and giving evidence of the possession\r\n     of ample funds.\r\n\r\n     In all the discussions of the recent race riots there is\r\n     reflected the note of pride that the Negro has found himself,\r\n     that he has \"fought back,\" that never again will he tamely\r\n     submit to violence or intimidation. The sense of oppression\r\n     finds increasingly bitter expression. Defiance and insolently\r\n     race-centered condemnation of the white race is to be met with\r\n     in every issue of the more radical publications, and this one\r\n     in moderateness of denunciation carries its own threat. The\r\n     Negro is \"seeing red,\" and it is the prime object of the leading\r\n     publications to induce a like quality of vision upon the part\r\n     of their readers. A few of them deny this, notwithstanding\r\n     the evidence of their work. Others of them openly admit the\r\n     fact. The number of restrained and conservative publications\r\n     is relatively negligible, and even some of these ... have\r\n     indulged in most intemperate utterance, though it would be\r\n     unfair not to state that certain papers--I can think of no\r\n     magazines--maintain an attitude of well-balanced sanity....\r\n\r\n     The _Messenger_ for October is significant for one thing above\r\n     all others. In it for the first time a Negro publication comes\r\n     out openly for sex equality.[81]\r\n\r\nIt is the sentiment briefly sketched in the foregoing pages that summons\r\nattention. What are Negroes actually thinking? How are they being affected\r\nby what the general public is thinking? What do they want? Against what\r\nare their protests directed? What kinds of group sentiments are being\r\ndeveloped and how significant are they as to subsequent relations between\r\nthe two groups?\r\n\r\nThis report merely sets out examples of those views in the hope of\r\nshowing the beliefs that control the conduct of Negroes in Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. RACE PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n_Criticism of Negro leaders._--A Negro attorney said:\r\n\r\n     I have read numerous articles written by prominent colored\r\n     men on the subject of Negroes moving North, and I have heard\r\n     many of them speak. But few of them, in my opinion, will\r\n     bear rigid criticism. They are wanting in genuine expression\r\n     of true conditions. Those writers and orators who have some\r\n     personal motive for their expression do not necessarily speak\r\n     with absolute frankness.\r\n\r\nA Negro worker said:\r\n\r\n     Our leaders are not interested enough in the welfare of the\r\n     race. As soon as they reach some little place of fame they\r\n     try to get off to themselves.\r\n\r\n_Contacts as basis for respect._--A Negro professional man said:\r\n\r\n     When in school in Oberlin my professor in debating and oratory\r\n     was so prejudiced that he would not let the other colored\r\n     boy and me be on teams together. We asked him repeatedly,\r\n     but he always refused. We decided to work on a debate for all\r\n     there was in it and compel him to recognize the fact that we\r\n     could measure up to the other members of the class. When we\r\n     finished he praised our work in the highest terms. After that\r\n     he began to take an interest in me and finally told me that he\r\n     did not know anything about Negroes and just felt that there\r\n     was nothing worth while in them. He tried to persuade me to\r\n     teach, and when I left he gave me one of the best letters of\r\n     recommendation that I have ever seen. That shows what contact\r\n     can do.\r\n\r\n_Not a race problem._--A Negro business man said:\r\n\r\n     There is no race problem; if the white people would only do as\r\n     they would be done by we would not have need of commissions\r\n     to better conditions. This won't be done, but an easier plan\r\n     is to enforce the law. The laws are good enough but they are\r\n     not enforced. Riots grow out of hate, jealousy, envy, and\r\n     prejudice. When a man becomes a contented citizen there will\r\n     be little chance of causing him to fight anyone. Give us those\r\n     things that are due us--law, protection, and equal rights--then\r\n     we will become contented citizens.\r\n\r\n_For better race relations in Chicago._--A Negro alderman said:\r\n\r\n     1. Pass a vagrancy law that will take the idle, shiftless and\r\n     intolerant hoodlum off the streets. Put the burden of proof\r\n     on the one so arrested.\r\n\r\n     2. Close all vicious poolrooms and dens of vice, and permit\r\n     no boy under nineteen years of age to enter poolrooms.\r\n\r\n     3. Forbid loitering on the street corners, especially transfer\r\n     points.\r\n\r\n     4. Prohibit vicious and race-antagonizing campaign speeches\r\n     on the streets of the city and in public halls. Races must\r\n     not be arrayed against each other.\r\n\r\n     5. Make more rigid the habeas corpus act, tighten up on the\r\n     parole and probation laws and enforcement of the truancy law.\r\n\r\n     6. Stop the newspapers from referring to the territory occupied\r\n     by the colored people as the \"Black Belt.\"\r\n\r\n     7. Inciting and inflammatory headlines in the newspapers must\r\n     be stopped.\r\n\r\n     8. Open the gates of employment to all races in our public\r\n     utilities, such as street-car and elevated-road service,\r\n     Chicago Telephone Co. exchanges, Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co.,\r\n     and the Commonwealth Edison Co.\r\n\r\n     9. Better housing for the colored people and improvement\r\n     of the district in which a vast majority of them reside by\r\n     turning certain streets into boulevards, building small parks\r\n     and playgrounds, and let the city or South Park Commissioners\r\n     build a bathing-beach equal to any other for the benefit and\r\n     comfort of all races along the water front, between Twenty-ninth\r\n     and Thirty-ninth streets. This without lines or thought of\r\n     segregation and for the benefit of a neglected part of our\r\n     tax-paying community.\r\n\r\n     10. Apprehend and convict the bomb throwers by placing in\r\n     command of our police-stations officers who will do their\r\n     duty and place patrolmen on duty who will not sympathize with\r\n     this lawless element of our citizenry. Greater still, insist\r\n     that the state's attorney do his full duty in prosecuting the\r\n     people who are responsible for inciting these criminal acts.\r\n\r\n     11. Safeguard the rights of all races in our public parks and\r\n     on the public highways.\r\n\r\n     12. Give us a man's chance in the field of labor, and we will\r\n     prove that we are no burden to any other race of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE EMOTIONAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n_An old settler._--The sentiment presented below is probably the\r\nunpolished feeling of a Negro who was born in Chicago before the fire of\r\n1871, and has lived here since. His grandfather owned the property where\r\nthe post-office now stands. He was at one time a member of the Central\r\nY.M.C.A. (white). For two and a half years he was assistant bookkeeper\r\nin a white bank in Memphis, Tennessee. He said:\r\n\r\n     Prejudice has been on the increase in Chicago since 1893.\r\n     Southerners came to the World's Exposition and many of them\r\n     remained. They brought their prejudices with them. On the cars\r\n     they would order colored people to get up and give their seats\r\n     to them. This resulted in fights, and when the cases were\r\n     taken to court colored people won as many cases as whites. I\r\n     took my grandmother to the fair and on the street car I had an\r\n     altercation with a white southerner who called her \"Auntie.\"\r\n     He tried to hit me, and I got out my gun to shoot him. A\r\n     Columbian guard and detective grabbed me. When the case was\r\n     called I was discharged.\r\n\r\n     Hyde Park is a nest of prejudice. These southerners moved out\r\n     there. Southern clubs are established throughout the country.\r\n     They get northernized and want straight-haired mulatto maids\r\n     for their mistresses and call them typists. The southern white\r\n     boys get jobs on newspapers in the North and work for nothing\r\n     in order that they may write articles and editorials against\r\n     Negroes and spread the doctrine of the South.\r\n\r\n     A good many years ago colored people lived in good homes and\r\n     the Irish lived in shanties. They used to call them \"flannel\r\n     mouth,\" \"mick,\" and \"shanty Irish.\" It used to be that only\r\n     colored men of light complexion could secure jobs as porters\r\n     on certain railroads. In 1908 the Archbishop of the Diocese of\r\n     the Catholic Church issued an edict that white communicants\r\n     should not worship at the Thirty-sixth and Dearborn streets\r\n     church. The whites still go there, however. The very fact that\r\n     the G.A.R. invited the Confederate veterans to march in the\r\n     same parade on Memorial Day goes to show that prejudice against\r\n     Negroes is increasing. They are combining. These southern\r\n     societies in Chicago which foster race prejudice should be\r\n     exposed.\r\n\r\n_Abyssinians._--During the summer of 1920 a group of self-styled\r\n\"Abyssinians,\" in a spectacular demonstration,[82] killed two white\r\nmen and seriously wounded two Negroes, one of whom was a policeman.\r\nNeither whites nor Negroes could give any further explanation of the\r\naffair than that it was an ignorant outburst of fanatics. Although the\r\ndemonstration was announced as part of a membership drive in a \"Back to\r\nAfrica Movement,\" there was a definite racial sentiment in the appeals\r\nto unlettered Negroes. This sentiment was calculated to solidify the\r\nfanatic group, while, at the same time, by its anti-social dogma, it\r\nplaced this group in opposition to the safety and well-being of the\r\ncommunity. Meetings and speeches and anti-racial dogma, founded upon\r\nunusual interpretations of the Bible, gave their sentiments a religious\r\nfervor and a racial aim. Thus these sentiments grew, uncorrected by\r\noutsiders, and finally expressed themselves in criminal but significant\r\nconduct. The significance of these sentiments is apparent in the\r\nattitude of a sympathizer with the movement, expressed to one of the\r\nCommission's investigators several weeks before the outbreak made the\r\nmovement unpopular. He is a shopkeeper, and most of his trade is among\r\nNegroes. His business with whites is wholly with wholesale dealers. In\r\nhis treatment of those who came into his store during the interview he\r\nwas rude and discourteous. He said:\r\n\r\n     I am a radical. I despise and hate the white man. They will\r\n     always be against the Ethiopian. I do not want to be called\r\n     Negro, colored, or \"nigger.\" Either term is an insult to me\r\n     or to you. Our rightful name is Ethiopian. White men stole\r\n     the black man from Africa and counseled with each other as to\r\n     what to do with him and what to call him, for when the Negro\r\n     learned that he was the first civilized human on earth he\r\n     would rise up and rebel against the white man. To keep him\r\n     from doing this it was decided to call him Negro after the\r\n     Niger River in Africa. This was to keep him from having that\r\n     knowledge by the Bible, for his right name was Ethiopian.\r\n     This was done so we could always be ruled by the white man. I\r\n     will call your attention to the Bible. There is not one word\r\n     of evil against the Children of Israel and Ethiopia written\r\n     in it. Ethiopia came out of Israel and God said they are his\r\n     people and he will be their God. He also says after the 300\r\n     years of punishment he will never go by [desert] Israel again\r\n     and will be with him for ever and ever. We find by the Bible\r\n     that he, the Ethiopian, is the only child of God.\r\n\r\n     The three hundred years of punishment are up, and this is the\r\n     year of deliverance. It started in 1619 when we were stolen from\r\n     Africa and made slaves. God is taking care of the black man.\r\n     Some great destruction will take place, but God's chosen people\r\n     will be all right. White passers-by from other neighborhoods are\r\n     the only people who trouble us. They will call you insulting\r\n     names or try to annoy you in a hundred little ways. The white\r\n     people in the neighborhood are all right. Two white men ran\r\n     down an old pet rooster of mine this morning. They were on a\r\n     motor-cycle and picked him up, carried him off, paying no heed\r\n     to me, as I ran two blocks after them.\r\n\r\n_Ready for trouble._--A Negro ex-soldier said:\r\n\r\n     I went to war, served eight months in France; I was married,\r\n     but I didn't claim exemption. I wanted to go, but I might as\r\n     well have stayed here for all the good it has done me.... No,\r\n     that ain't so, I'm glad I went. I done my part and I'm going\r\n     to fight right here till Uncle Sam does his. I can shoot as\r\n     good as the next one, and nobody better start anything. I ain't\r\n     looking for trouble, but if it comes my way I ain't dodging.\r\n\r\n_Agitation and discussion._--A Negro lawyer said:\r\n\r\n     Agitation by the press, both white and colored, does nothing\r\n     but create dissension. The religious and political leaders have\r\n     gone from one extreme to the other. Formerly the Negroes were\r\n     cringing and ingratiating when dealing with the whites. Now\r\n     they are trying to be radical in order to gain notoriety. There\r\n     is nothing to be gained in either being servile or radical.\r\n     I have had indignities heaped upon me by the white man. Why,\r\n     my mother was ill when a white man in Georgia took every bit\r\n     of our furniture from us, pulling the bed from under her. She\r\n     screamed with pain each time they moved the bed, but they left\r\n     her on the floor. I swore that I would kill that man and for\r\n     many years held hatred against him. Now I know it is wrong\r\n     and only hope that he has learned better.\r\n\r\n_A Negro and a mob._--How does a Negro feel when he is being hunted or\r\nchased by a mob? Few persons are able to analyze their emotions under\r\nsuch stress. It happens, however, that a Negro university student fell\r\nvictim to the sportive brutality of a gang of white men in a clash in\r\nSeptember, 1920, and after being chased and hunted for five hours and a\r\nhalf in an unfriendly neighborhood escaped uninjured. He recounted his\r\nexperience in an effort at a purely objective study of his emotions.\r\n\r\nWhile at work in a plant just outside Chicago he became ill and was\r\nforced to leave early. Unaware that a riot was in progress, he left\r\na street car to transfer in a hostile neighborhood. As he neared the\r\ncorner one of a group of about twenty young white men yelled: \"There's\r\na nigger! Let's get him!\" He boarded a car to escape them. They pulled\r\noff the trolley and started into the car after him. His story follows:\r\n\r\n     The motorman opened the door, and before they knew it I jumped\r\n     out and ran up Fifty-first Street as fast as my feet could\r\n     carry me. Gaining about thirty yards on them was a decided\r\n     advantage, for one of them saw me and with the shout \"There he\r\n     goes!\" the gang started after me. One, two, three, blocks went\r\n     past in rapid succession. They came on shouting, \"Stop him!\r\n     Stop him!\" I ran on the sidewalk and someone tried to trip me,\r\n     but fortunately I anticipated his intentions and jumped into\r\n     the road. As I neared the next street intersection, a husky,\r\n     fair-haired fellow weighing about 180 pounds came lunging at\r\n     me. I have never thought so quickly in all my life as then, I\r\n     believe. Three things flashed into my mind--to stop suddenly\r\n     and let him pass me and then go on; to try to trip him by\r\n     dropping in front of him; or to keep running and give him a\r\n     good football straight arm. The first two I figured would stop\r\n     me, and the gang would be that much nearer, so I decided to\r\n     rely on the last. These thoughts flashed through my mind as\r\n     I ran about ten steps. As we came together, I left my feet,\r\n     and putting all my weight and strength into a lunge, shot my\r\n     right hand at his chin. It landed squarely and by a half-turn\r\n     the fair-haired would-be tackler went flying to the road on\r\n     his face.\r\n\r\n     That was some satisfaction, but it took a lot of my strength,\r\n     for by this time I was beginning to feel weak. But determination\r\n     kept me at it, and I ran on. Then I came to a corner where a\r\n     drug-store was open and a woman standing outside. I slowed\r\n     down and asked her to let me go in there, that a gang was\r\n     chasing me; but she said I would not be safe there, so I turned\r\n     off Fifty-first Street and ran down the side street. Here\r\n     the road had been freshly oiled and I nearly took a \"header\"\r\n     as I stepped in the first pool, but fortunately no accident\r\n     happened. My strength was fast failing; the suggestion came\r\n     into my mind to stop and give up or try to fight it out with\r\n     the two or three who were still chasing me, but this would\r\n     never do, as the odds were too great, so I kept on. My legs\r\n     began to wobble, my breath came harder, and my heart seemed to\r\n     be pounding like a big pump, while the man nearest me began\r\n     to creep up on me. It was then that an old athletic maxim\r\n     came into my mind--\"He's feeling as tired as you.\" Besides,\r\n     I thought, perhaps he smokes and boozes and his wind is worse\r\n     than mine. Often in the last hundred yards of a quarter-mile\r\n     that thought of my opponent's condition had brought forth the\r\n     last efforts necessary for the final spurt. There was more than\r\n     a medal at stake this time, so I stuck, and in a few strides\r\n     more they gave up the chase. One block further on, when I\r\n     had made sure that no one was following me on the other side\r\n     of the street, I slowed down to walk and regained my breath.\r\n     Soon I found myself on Forty-sixth Street just west of Halsted\r\n     where the street is blind, so I climbed up on the railroad\r\n     tracks and walked along them. But I imagined that in crossing\r\n     a lighted street I could be seen from below and got down off\r\n     the tracks, intending to cross a field and take a chance on\r\n     the street. But this had to be abandoned, for as I looked over\r\n     the prospect from the shadow of a fence I saw an automobile\r\n     held up at the point of a revolver in the hands of one member\r\n     of a gang while they searched the car apparently looking for\r\n     colored men.\r\n\r\n     This is no place for a minister's son, I thought, and crept\r\n     back behind a fence and lay down among some weeds. Lying there\r\n     as quietly as could be I reflected on how close I had come to\r\n     a severe beating or the possible loss of my life. Fear, which\r\n     had caused me to run, now gave place to anger, and a desire\r\n     to fight, if I could fight with a square deal. I remembered\r\n     that as I looked the gang over at Fifty-first and Ashland\r\n     I figured I could handle any of them individually with the\r\n     possible exception of two, but the whole gang of blood-thirsty\r\n     hoodlums was too much. Anger gave place to hatred and a desire\r\n     for revenge, and I thought if ever I caught a green-buttoned\r\n     \"Ragen's Colt\" on the South Side east of State that one of\r\n     us would get a licking. But reason showed me such would be\r\n     folly and would only lead to reprisals and some other innocent\r\n     individual getting a licking on my account. I knew all \"Ragen's\"\r\n     were not rowdies, for I had met some who were pretty decent\r\n     fellows, but some others--ye gods!\r\n\r\n     My problem was to get home and to avoid meeting hostile\r\n     elements. Temporarily I was safe in hiding, but I could not\r\n     stay there after daybreak. So I decided to wait a couple of\r\n     hours and then try to pass through \"No Man's Land\"--Halsted to\r\n     Wentworth. I figured the time to be about 11:30 and so decided\r\n     to wait until 1:30 or 2:00 A.M., before coming out of cover.\r\n     Shots rang out intermittently; the sky became illumined; the\r\n     fire bells rang, and I imagined riot and arson held sway as of\r\n     the previous year. It is remarkable how the imagination runs\r\n     wild under such conditions.\r\n\r\n     Then the injustice of the whole thing overwhelmed me--emotions\r\n     ran riot. Had the ten months I spent in France been all in\r\n     vain? Were those little white crosses over the dead bodies of\r\n     those dark-skinned boys lying in Flanders fields for naught? Was\r\n     democracy merely a hollow sentiment? What had I done to deserve\r\n     such treatment? I lay there experiencing all the emotions I\r\n     imagined the innocent victim of a southern mob must feel when\r\n     being hunted for some supposed crime. Was this what I had\r\n     given up my Canadian citizenship for, to become an American\r\n     citizen and soldier? Was the risk of life in a country where\r\n     such hatred existed worth while? Must a Negro always suffer\r\n     merely because of the color of his skin? \"There's a Nigger;\r\n     let's get him!\" Those words rang in my ears--I shall never\r\n     forget them.\r\n\r\n     Psychologists claim that it is in the face of overwhelming\r\n     forces that man is prone to turn to the Supreme Being. I was\r\n     no longer afraid, only filled with righteous indignation and\r\n     a desire to get out of danger. But mingled emotions shook me,\r\n     and a flood of tears burst forth. In the midst of it I found\r\n     myself praying fervently to God against the injustice of it\r\n     all, for strength and help to go through safely, and thanks for\r\n     my deliverance from the gang which had chased me. Then relief\r\n     came from all these pent-up feelings with the determination\r\n     to get up and try to go through--and to fight, if necessary.\r\n     I began to speculate on means. A freight train came along, and\r\n     the impulse came to jump on it and ride out of town until the\r\n     trouble was over, but the knowledge of only 15 cents carfare\r\n     in my pocket compelled the rejection of this idea. I thought\r\n     of phoning to a friend to come and get me in his car, but\r\n     this was futile, for where could I find a phone and be safe\r\n     in that neighborhood? Some clothes on a line in a yard across\r\n     the field offered a disguise, but even dressed as a woman I'd\r\n     need a hat, and that idea had to be abandoned. With resources\r\n     at an end, I picked up four rocks for ammunition and started\r\n     out.\r\n\r\n     For four blocks I glided from shadow to shadow, through alleys.\r\n     A couple of dogs nearly \"spilled the beans\" when they barked\r\n     just as an automobile came down the street. I dove for cover\r\n     until the car had disappeared and then emerged. At Forty-ninth\r\n     Street and Union Avenue I climbed up on the railroad tracks\r\n     and cautiously walked along them in the darkness. All of a\r\n     sudden a block ahead appeared what seemed to be about ten men\r\n     standing on the tracks, so I dropped to the ground and made a\r\n     pair of binoculars out of my hands. For what seemed like five\r\n     minutes I watched these forms then decided they were uprights\r\n     on a bridge and went on. Imagination and fear can play tricks,\r\n     and this was one of them.\r\n\r\n     Finally I found myself at Thirty-seventh and Stewart streets,\r\n     having been walking northeast instead of east as I thought.\r\n     I climbed down to the street and walked through back lanes\r\n     until I saw the Sox ball park. All was quiet, so I came out\r\n     and crossed Wentworth Avenue. At State and Thirty-seventh\r\n     I saw two colored fellows waiting for a car and ran up to\r\n     them. Putting my hands on their shoulders I said, \"Gee! I'm\r\n     glad to see a dark skin.\" Then I related my experience. They\r\n     assured me the \"fun\" was all over, and I was thankful. It was\r\n     twenty-five minutes to four, just five and a half hours after\r\n     I had started for home from work. A white man came along,\r\n     and my first impulse was to jump on him and beat him up. But\r\n     again reason told me he was not responsible for the actions of\r\n     a gang of rowdies, and he was as innocent as I had been when\r\n     set upon.\r\n\r\n     Is such an experience easily forgotten? Recent events would\r\n     prove to the contrary. I vowed that morning never to let\r\n     the sun set on me west of Wentworth Avenue, and never to go\r\n     into that section unprotected, even in daytime. On a recent\r\n     Sunday the papers came out with an \"Extra\" about 11:00 P.M.,\r\n     announcing a \"Big South Side Fight.\" I went to the door and\r\n     hailed a boy. Just then an automobile with men standing on\r\n     the running-board came around the corner. The possibility\r\n     of another riot flashed through my mind and without looking\r\n     at the paper I snapped off the light, closed the door, and\r\n     prepared for trouble if it came my way. But the \"Fight\" had\r\n     been a gunman's war. This is just indicative of the caution\r\n     such an experience develops. It is not a fear, but a wariness\r\n     in uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. DEFENSIVE POLICIES\r\n\r\nTo stimulate group morale and solidify the sentiments of Negroes for\r\nunified opposition to what they regard as oppressive measures of white\r\npeople, many tactics are employed. The most common of these is that of\r\ninterpreting the aims and ambitions of Negroes to white persons and of\r\ndefending themselves generally against criticism. A selection of types\r\nof this \"defensive\" sentiment is given.\r\n\r\nA Negro attorney said:\r\n\r\n     The only way to gain favorable public opinion is to create\r\n     favorable press notices. A certain amount of agitation is\r\n     necessary on the part of colored papers to educate the race\r\n     as to what it is entitled to. The American white race has been\r\n     very successful in its propaganda that colored people are not\r\n     entitled to certain things. This has caused many Negroes to\r\n     believe that they are not as good as the white people.\r\n\r\n     The press can be a source of evil or of good. It depends upon\r\n     the point of view. The difficulty lies in the fact that the\r\n     white press has the wrong attitude, usually. A great deal of\r\n     harm is done by paid workers who will give interviews that\r\n     will sustain the viewpoint of the papers. Others desirous of\r\n     newspaper notoriety are guilty of the same offense. Usually\r\n     those interviewed are not capable of giving exact opinions and\r\n     viewpoints. Those capable of doing justice to the situation\r\n     are not sought by reporters. During the time when there is\r\n     more calm and people are in a position to give thoughtful\r\n     consideration to the question, no effort is made to find out\r\n     the attitude of substantial citizens. If this were done the\r\n     papers would get somewhere.\r\n\r\nA letter from a Negro thanking the editor of a northern paper for a fair\r\neditorial said:\r\n\r\n     The colored citizens realize fully the extent to which\r\n     propaganda is spread against them in the average newspaper\r\n     under the guise of news, and when they find someone who knows\r\n     that too, and who is strong enough to help, as is the ----\r\n     [newspaper], they thank him with all the strength of their\r\n     hearts, although their lips may remain mute.\r\n\r\n_Negro sentiment regarding racial news in the white press._--A Negro\r\nweekly paper said:\r\n\r\n     Whatever be the cause or the motive there is apparently a\r\n     well organized plan to discredit the race in America and to\r\n     bring estrangement between fellow Americans. A short-sighted\r\n     ... press is contributing to this estrangement by playing\r\n     upon the passions of the undiscriminating and thoughtlessly\r\n     by its glaring and sensational headings, emphasizing rumours\r\n     of alleged crimes by Negroes.\r\n\r\n_Flattery as a means of promoting tolerance._--A popular Negro orator said:\r\n\r\n     I think that the great trouble with us already is that we have\r\n     allowed the white people to settle too many things for us.\r\n     The nation gave you constitutional freedom, but no man can\r\n     make you truly free except you yourself. The white man hates\r\n     nothing worse than a coward, and the American white man is the\r\n     most remarkable human being the world ever knew. He is God's\r\n     superman. As white and black have one destiny beneath the Stars\r\n     and Stripes, so have we the common duties of citizenship....\r\n\r\n     Woodrow Wilson is my leader. What he commands me to do I shall\r\n     do. Where he commands me to go I shall go. I had naught of\r\n     ill will toward Von Bernsdorf until Wilson pointed him out\r\n     as a national menace. Whom Woodrow Wilson cannot receive into\r\n     fellowship, I cannot receive.\r\n\r\nA Negro resident of Chicago for fourteen years, formerly of Louisiana,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     I went to Wilson's last inauguration in Washington and tried to\r\n     talk to the President. I got in the gate, but the guard would\r\n     not let me go farther without a pass. I went into every place\r\n     that men were allowed to enter and found no \"Jim-Crowing\" in\r\n     any public place. The nearest approach to it was in the printing\r\n     department of the government. There were several colored girls\r\n     all working at the same table. In other departments I had\r\n     seen white and colored together. I went into every washroom\r\n     on every floor of one building and must have washed my hands\r\n     twenty times.\r\n\r\n_Negroes, real Americans._--A letter from a Negro workman to Governor\r\nLowden said:\r\n\r\n     Why is it that intelligent colored people, the real Americans\r\n     and the most humble and purest nation that ever trod the soil\r\n     of America since they have been here--we have never thrown\r\n     any bombs; we have never written a black-hand letter and what\r\n     disgrace and shameful things we do it was learned to us by\r\n     our foreparents' masters down south because they taught them\r\n     to steal and murder and do all other most disgraceful things.\r\n     We have never bombed any white people's homes, but I cannot\r\n     see into it why it is that all nations such as the Polish,\r\n     Japan, Chinaman, Mexican, German and Russ and now you see what\r\n     they have done to this country; they have done everything to\r\n     overthrow this Government and have got the I.W.W. and the Red.\r\n     Where have we done such dirty deeds? We have enriched this\r\n     soil of America with our blood in every war for this country\r\n     and then cannot live where we want to as an American citizen.\r\n     We even shed our blood in France to save someone else money\r\n     and their homes, and the thanks we got when we come back was\r\n     a big race riot which I do believe was started by southern\r\n     white men to put a disgrace on the North because the North do\r\n     not lynch and burn as they do. Of course I know you cannot do\r\n     anything by yourself. But if you can get enough men who have\r\n     got a backbone to protect the ones who have always protected\r\n     them this outrage could be stopped. I read a piece in the\r\n     _Herald-Examiner_ that it would be a riot here; that has\r\n     poisoned the minds of so many people. So now I hope you will\r\n     try to stop such trouble.\r\n\r\n_Defensive philosophy; silence does not mean contentment._--A Negro\r\neducator said:\r\n\r\n     Many white men of high intellectual ability and keen discernment\r\n     have mistaken the Negro silence for contentment, his facial\r\n     expression for satisfaction at prevailing conditions, and his\r\n     songs and jovial air for happiness. But not always so. These are\r\n     his methods of bearing his troubles and keeping his soul sweet\r\n     under seeming wrongs. In the absence of a spokesman or means\r\n     of communication with the whites over imagined grievances, he\r\n     has brightened his countenance, smiled and sung to give ease\r\n     to his mind. In the midst of it all he is unable to harmonize\r\n     the teachings of the Bible which the white Christian placed\r\n     in his hands with the practices of daily life. He finds it\r\n     difficult to harmonize the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood\r\n     of man, and his faith is put to the test in that \"Providence\"\r\n     which enslaved his ancestors, corrupted his blood and placed\r\n     upon him stigmas more damaging than to be a leper or convict\r\n     by making his color a badge of infamy and his preordained\r\n     social position at the bottom of human society. So firmly has\r\n     his status been fixed by this \"Providence\" that neither moral\r\n     worth, fidelity to trust, love of home, loyalty to country or\r\n     faith in God can raise him to human recognition.\r\n\r\n_Votes for Negroes._--The _Crisis_ for January, 1921, said:\r\n\r\n     The astonishing thing about the Bourbon South is its\r\n     intellectual bankruptcy when it comes to the Negro. It\r\n     continually assumes that the Negro is a fool. Some Negroes are\r\n     fools, but the proportion among them is steadily decreasing,\r\n     while that among the Bourbons seems to increase. When the\r\n     average white Southerner faces the problem of racial contact\r\n     he has absolutely nothing to offer except what he offered\r\n     in 1861, namely: the Will of God, Force and Bloodshed, and,\r\n     \"The best friend in the world to the Negro is the Southern\r\n     white man--the only one who truly loves him.\" We quote from\r\n     our ever-delightful friend, the editor of the _Macon_ (Ga.)\r\n     _Telegraph_.\r\n\r\n     The tragedy of the situation is that this man believes what\r\n     he says. He knows absolutely just the \"place\" for which God\r\n     made \"niggers\"; but to support this sincere belief he spreads\r\n     falsehoods. He says that the woman suffrage party by its secret\r\n     machinations \"probably\" caused the blood shed in the Florida\r\n     elections! He threatens murder for black men who want to vote,\r\n     and almost weeps over the misguided Negroes who have left the\r\n     Empire State of lynching and gone to Chicago.\r\n\r\n     There seems to be in this man's mind absolutely no conception\r\n     of the tremendous, increasing, unswerving development of the\r\n     Negro. To him all aspiration, unrest, and complaints of black\r\n     folk are conspiracies of whites. For the blacks he has no\r\n     program, no vision, except that they stay where they have always\r\n     been, growing more content with \"Jim-Crow\" cars, lynching and\r\n     disfranchisement.\r\n\r\n     It is inconceivable to the mentality of this section of the\r\n     white South that such a program is absolutely impossible.\r\n     That if, in the end, the price we must pay for aspiration to\r\n     modern manhood is death, and death in the most horrible form\r\n     of public torture and burning like that in Florida, if to live\r\n     we must die, then the South will have us to kill. Any man who\r\n     does not prefer death to slavery is not worth freedom....\r\n\r\n     The black man must vote. Every Southerner with brains knows\r\n     this. The Negro is awaiting his enfranchisement with greater\r\n     patience than the South has any right to expect. But he will\r\n     not wait forever. If he sees gathering signs of sanity--a\r\n     willingness to let the intelligent and thrifty vote, an honest\r\n     effort to establish law and order and overthrow the rule of\r\n     the mob, a desire to substitute honest industrial conditions\r\n     in place of the organized and entrenched theft of black wealth\r\n     upon which southern industry is based today--such a program,\r\n     tardy and slow and inadequate though it be, may count on the\r\n     infinite patience and long suffering of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. RACE CONSCIOUSNESS\r\n\r\n_Ancient Order of Ethiopian Princes_:[83]\r\n\r\n     TO MY KINSMEN.--In a broad sense, the words \"Negro\" and \"Nigger\"\r\n     have no historical significance. They are used synonymously\r\n     in the white man's dictionary. \"Negro\" is a pure Spanish word\r\n     meaning \"black.\" The word \"Negro,\" therefore, may be descriptive\r\n     of a race, but not the name of it. In reality \"Negro\" is an\r\n     alias, or nickname applied to us originally, in much the same\r\n     contemptuous spirit as the black boy is called \"Rastus\" or\r\n     \"Sambo.\"\r\n\r\n     The white man writes his history for us to study, makes his\r\n     scenario with his heroes and heroines for us to admire, and\r\n     supplies our newspapers. Through these instrumentalities he\r\n     almost entirely controls our thought.\r\n\r\n     Remember that \"a word is the sign of an idea.\" The kind of an\r\n     \"idea\" that the \"sign\" stands for depends upon our teaching.\r\n     If we associate a word, then, with a noble or degraded idea,\r\n     we have been taught to do so.\r\n\r\n     You can easily prove this by experimenting with certain words\r\n     for yourself. After repeating each word tell what your idea\r\n     is and what you see: (1) Roman, (2) Paradise, (3) Statesmen,\r\n     (4) General. Is the idea or picture you get degraded? No. The\r\n     White Press, history, reel and teacher have taken care of that.\r\n\r\n     Now take the following words: (1) Lynched, (2) Jim Crow, (3)\r\n     Disfranchised, (4) Negro.\r\n\r\n     What is the result? The words \"Lynched,\" \"Jim Crow,\"\r\n     \"Disfranchised,\" are the signs of degraded ideas. Moreover,\r\n     \"Negro\" is very apt to creep into each one of the three mind\r\n     pictures and conversely one of the three into the \"Negro\" mind\r\n     picture.\r\n\r\n     Do you understand? Now why is that? That is what Ethiopic\r\n     culture teaches, through the \"Ancient Order of Ethiopian\r\n     Princes.\"\r\n\r\n     If we believe that we come from nowhere and have no history\r\n     but that of a slave, our substance will be the charity of our\r\n     oppressors, and our future handicapped by doubts and fears.\r\n\r\n     Ancient history knows no \"Negro,\" but ancient history does\r\n     know Ethiopia and Ethiopians. Change a family's name and in a\r\n     generation you cannot tell whether its foreparents were rogues\r\n     or saints. It is the same with a race. You cannot trace your\r\n     ancestors through the name \"Negro.\"\r\n\r\n     Take away our birthright, our ancient honorable name,\r\n     \"Ethiopian\" and you have stopped the very fountain of our\r\n     inspiration. If we are \"Negroes\" we are by the same dictionary\r\n     also, \"Niggers.\" The moment we realize, however, that we are\r\n     \"Ethiopians,\" we can see the beams from the lamps of Ethiopian\r\n     culture lighting a pathway down the shadowy ages, and the\r\n     fires of ambition are rekindled in our hearts, because we\r\n     know that we came from the builders of temples and founders\r\n     of civilization.\r\n\r\n     Study this.\r\n\r\n_Contrasts of North and South._--An investigator's report on home\r\nconditions of retarded children said:\r\n\r\n     The mother is eager to learn, and constantly talks of wanting\r\n     to attend night school if the opportunity ever offers itself.\r\n     She is eager for her girl to complete her education and wants\r\n     her to take a business course so she will be independent. \"A\r\n     white man can take everything from the colored man but his\r\n     learning,\" Mrs. ---- said repeatedly.\r\n\r\n     In coming to Chicago she wasn't sure what she would find, but\r\n     she had heard that colored people had a show here. She brought\r\n     her child here to give her one. Chicago seems like heaven to\r\n     her now when she thinks of what she had been through in the\r\n     South.\r\n\r\n     When the investigator asked her about the church to which she\r\n     belonged she said: \"Olivet. I goes every Sunday and Wednesday\r\n     nights to prayer meeting just to thank God that he let me live\r\n     to go to a place of worship like that, a place where my people\r\n     worship and ain't pestered by the white men.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chicago riot provoked probably the first full expressions of sentiment\r\nfrom Negroes in their own press. Underlying them are attitudes toward\r\npresent race relations. There is a strong note of resentment, and the\r\nannouncement of the birth of a \"New Negro.\"\r\n\r\nThe war is credited with bringing about this change. More than 250,000\r\nyoung Negroes, the pick of the race in health and intelligence, had\r\nreturned to the United States, presumably with changed ideas, and perhaps\r\nwith growing cynicism as to promises of fair treatment. Perhaps for\r\nthe first time in American history the Negro group fought in the 1919\r\nriot as a body against mob violence. The idea that these disorders are\r\na result of active opposition to distasteful practices is prominent in\r\npractically every Negro discussion. \"The Negro race is facing about\" is\r\na familiar statement. Said one Negro newspaper:\r\n\r\n     It is the utter ignoring of the Negro in the community life\r\n     that is responsible for these outbreaks. The controlling whites\r\n     were absolutely out of touch with the Negroes, and the races\r\n     came together in a quarrel and there was no means by which\r\n     the trouble could be settled.\r\n\r\nA monthly magazine, the _Favorite_, said:\r\n\r\n     If the white man thinks that the rights, privileges and ordinary\r\n     pursuits of the Negro can now be annulled at this stage of the\r\n     world's affairs, he certainly has \"another thought coming.\"\r\n     This Washington revolt is only the \"handwriting on the wall.\"\r\n     Don't squeeze the Negro too hard; if you do you squeeze him to\r\n     the bursting point. The young Negro of today is far different\r\n     from his foreparents, and will not be content with anything\r\n     less than a fair deal.\r\n\r\nThe _New York American_ said:\r\n\r\n     The dangerous enemy of his race is the colored man that\r\n     advocates force as a remedy. There is such a thing as being\r\n     outnumbered beyond any hope.\r\n\r\nA Negro newspaper replied:\r\n\r\n     There is such a thing, too, as a noble preference of death\r\n     to a life of slavery. Do Hearst and Arthur Brisbane think\r\n     the sentiment of \"Give me Liberty or Give me Death\" belongs\r\n     exclusively to a white skin?\r\n\r\nA poem in the _Crusader_ and republished in the _Messenger_ and several\r\nother periodicals, carries this same idea:\r\n\r\n     IF WE MUST DIE\r\n\r\n     If we must die, let it not be like hogs\r\n         Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,\r\n     While around us bark the mad and hungry dogs\r\n         Making their mock at our accursed lot.\r\n\r\n     If we must die--oh, let us nobly die,\r\n         So that our precious blood may not be shed\r\n     In vain; then even the monsters we defy\r\n         Shall be constrained to honor us, though dead!\r\n\r\n     Oh, kinsmen! We must meet the common foe;\r\n         Though far outnumbered, let us still be brave,\r\n     And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!\r\n         What though before us lies the open grave?\r\n     Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,\r\n         Pressed to the wall, dying, but--fighting back!\r\n\r\n     --CLAUDE MCKAY\r\n\r\n_Defensive measures justified._--The general belief among Negroes is\r\nthat resistance to violence is justified. Some view this display of\r\ncounterviolence as simply defensive measures, some as retaliation, which\r\nin substance means the same.\r\n\r\nThe _Washington Eagle_, a Negro newspaper, commenting on the beginning\r\nof the Washington riot, said:\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the fact that these mobs, increasing in number\r\n     and in violence each evening, were allowed to harass law-abiding\r\n     colored citizens for three consecutive evenings, the colored\r\n     citizens showed no signs of revenge or retaliation. But when\r\n     the situation became so terrible that colored citizens could\r\n     endure it no longer they rose up almost as one man, and,\r\n     adhering to the first law of human nature, which says that\r\n     self-preservation is the first law of nature, they armed\r\n     themselves \"to the teeth,\" to use the phrase of one of the\r\n     local newspapers. It was only when they showed this disposition\r\n     to fight back that the riot ceased.\r\n\r\nThe _Messenger_, a Negro magazine, said:\r\n\r\n     The world knows not that the new Negroes are determined to\r\n     observe the primal law of self-preservation whenever civil\r\n     laws break down; to assist the authorities to preserve order\r\n     and prevent themselves and families from being murdered in\r\n     cold blood. Surely, no one can easily object to this new and\r\n     laudable determination.\r\n\r\n_Opinions of Negroes regarding the conduct of the police._--Negro\r\ncondemnation of the police seems general. From a large selection of\r\ncomments two are given. The _Favorite_ said:\r\n\r\n     History proves that nearly all race riots are started by white\r\n     policemen. East St. Louis, Houston and Washington, D.C., have\r\n     had terrible cataclysms provoked by white bluecoats who in\r\n     nine cases out of ten carry their prejudices with them whenever\r\n     they enter black belts. Instead of acting in behalf of law and\r\n     order white policemen usually act in behalf of some passion\r\n     that tells them Negroes are convenient brutes. For the safety\r\n     of the twenty-five thousand colored and ten thousand whites in\r\n     the Second Ward of Chicago we ask that every white patrolman\r\n     in the district be replaced by a colored bluecoat. Chicago\r\n     must not be added to the list of American cities cut off from\r\n     civilization by race riots, and it is up to Mayor William Hale\r\n     Thompson and Chief Garrity to see that the honor of that city\r\n     is preserved.\r\n\r\nThe _Washington Eagle_ thought most of the trouble was due to the\r\noverbearing attitude of the police. It said:\r\n\r\n     Bishop Cottrell, wiring from Holly Springs, Miss., wants the\r\n     President to call a conference of representatives of both races\r\n     to consider the matter of mob law. We doubt if the President\r\n     will take the trouble to do anything of the kind: while he\r\n     is thinking it over the police in every place had better be\r\n     instructed to have more respect for the rights and feelings of\r\n     the Afro-American people. Most of the trouble is to be found\r\n     in the insolent and overbearing attitude of the police.\r\n\r\n_Negro opinions regarding white newspapers._--It is asserted by numerous\r\nNegro papers that certain white papers spurred the rioters to greater\r\nlawlessness in the Washington outbreak, and in some cases settled the\r\ndate and place of assembly for attacking parties. The _Afro-American_\r\nquoted from the _Washington Post_ an excerpt headed \"Mobilizing for\r\nTonight,\" and reading:\r\n\r\n     It was learned that a mobilization of every available service\r\n     man stationed in or near Washington or on leave here has been\r\n     ordered for tomorrow evening near the Knights of Columbus hut\r\n     on Pennsylvania Avenue, between Seventh and Eighth streets. The\r\n     hour of assembly is 9 o'clock and the purpose is a \"cleanup\"\r\n     that will cause the events of the last two evenings to pale\r\n     into insignificance. Whether official cognizance of this\r\n     assemblage and its intent will bring about its forestalling\r\n     cannot be told.\r\n\r\nThe _Afro-American_ added:\r\n\r\n     Commenting on this article Secretary Shillady of the\r\n     National Association declares: \"In view of the fact that the\r\n     'mobilization' announced by the _Washington Post_ had not been\r\n     ordered by any authority, military or civil, does not the\r\n     passage show intent by the _Washington Post_ to bring about\r\n     such mobilization?\"\r\n\r\nAnother Negro paper in Washington carried the criticism farther:\r\n\r\n     Editorials are supposed to concern those topics that are most\r\n     important to the community in which they are written. No one\r\n     can deny the importance of the race riots that disgraced the\r\n     name of fair America's Capital during the present week; yet\r\n     two of the leading daily papers of the city found everything\r\n     to fill their editorial columns but the proper attempts\r\n     to discourage mob violence and a disposition to place the\r\n     blame where it justly belongs. The rioting, in itself, was a\r\n     deplorable disgrace, but a greater disgrace is that the daily\r\n     newspapers should have encouraged the rioting by the glaring,\r\n     ugly headlines that they gave it, rather than discourage the\r\n     riots in editorials.\r\n\r\nThe _National Defender and Sun_ replied to an editorial of the _Chicago\r\nTribune_:\r\n\r\n     In a recent edition of the _Chicago Daily Tribune_, which calls\r\n     itself the world's greatest newspaper, in discussing the recent\r\n     race riot in Chicago, it had this to say: \"Can the two races\r\n     continue to live in peace in Chicago without segregation? We\r\n     have for some time criticized the South for its treatment of\r\n     its black citizens. We believe since the race riot in Chicago\r\n     that segregation, separate cars, will be the only cure to\r\n     prevent race riots in the future.\" We are very much surprised\r\n     at the statement of the _Chicago Tribune_. Does the world's\r\n     greatest newspaper forget that Atlanta, Ga., Memphis, Tenn.,\r\n     Arkansas and Texas, had great race riots, and that all of the\r\n     above-named states have their Jim Crow laws and segregated\r\n     district?\r\n\r\nThe _New York Age_ had this to say:\r\n\r\n     So much clamor and bad blood have been aroused by the repeated\r\n     charge of assaults attempted upon women in the city of\r\n     Washington, that more than ordinary significance attaches to\r\n     a news item found tucked away in an inconspicuous position\r\n     on an inside page of the _Washington Times_. It was headed:\r\n     \"Woman Now Denies She Was Attacked,\" and read as follows: \"The\r\n     case of an alleged attack on Mrs. Minnie Franklin, 1361 K.\r\n     Street Southeast, by two Negroes near Fifteenth and H. Sts.,\r\n     Northeast, Thursday night, was closed last night when according\r\n     to detectives, the woman said the story was a fabrication.\r\n     Several headquarters detectives questioned the woman yesterday\r\n     and then went over the ground where the alleged attack was\r\n     supposed to have occurred, but could find no evidence of a\r\n     struggle.\"\r\n\r\n     This reported case of \"assault\" had \"scare\" headlines at the\r\n     time it was supposed to have occurred, and it looked as if\r\n     the daily papers were trying to provoke another riot. Later,\r\n     by the admission of the accuser, the police and the press,\r\n     the charge was shown to be groundless. Time and again these\r\n     charges of assaults have been shown to be \"faked,\" and the most\r\n     credulous should be brought to see the necessity of searching\r\n     investigation before pronouncing the accused guilty. Hysteria,\r\n     by newspaper suggestion, may be at the foundation of many a\r\n     case of reported \"assault.\"\r\n\r\n_Charges of southern propaganda in the North._--A wide distinction has\r\nbeen made by Negro observers between the Washington and Chicago riots,\r\nthe former being called a typical southern, and the latter a typical\r\nnorthern, riot. Reasons for this are given in the different forms of\r\nincentive to rioting. The Washington reasons were largely sentimental\r\nand bore a striking resemblance to the Atlanta riot about 1906. Reports\r\nof attacks on white women, played up in the newspapers, were sufficient\r\nto set the current going. The sentiment of the South is said to have\r\nbeen behind this outbreak. Said the _Chicago Defender_:\r\n\r\n     It is easy to see that the southern white man is at the\r\n     bottom of race riots in the northern cities to which we have\r\n     migrated in recent years.... It is idle to suppose that the\r\n     black man was the only migrator from the South; every northern\r\n     community is practically overrun with southern whites of both\r\n     sexes. In many of the northern cities a majority of the white\r\n     women employed as clerks and saleswomen in department stores,\r\n     telephone operators and other fields of industry are from the\r\n     South. In every place where men are utilized, including public\r\n     officials, judges and prosecuting attorneys, some of them are\r\n     also from the South.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._--The _Chicago Defender_ said:\r\n\r\n     To emphasize the fact that no self-respecting citizen had\r\n     anything to do with the disgraceful affairs recently witnessed\r\n     here and in Washington, thousands of circulars have been\r\n     distributed by our people and to our people filled with good,\r\n     wholesome advice as to being good, law-abiding citizens. Our\r\n     only salvation lies in harmony, and both elements must come to\r\n     understand that each is necessary to the other, and that with\r\n     all pulling together, democracy for America will no longer be\r\n     a theory, but a reality.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing examples of sentiment by no means cover the varieties of\r\nNegro opinion. They are merely illustrative of different types. The\r\npeculiarities of group behavior which appear to be the attributes of\r\nthe Negro group would doubtless show themselves in any other groups\r\nsimilarly placed in the social scale. There would at the same time be\r\nno more likelihood of their being understood. Situations develop which\r\nappear to the uninitiated white observer strange and even dangerous.\r\nThat they do represent very definite and calculated programs of action\r\nwithin certain circles of the Negro group may be illustrated by a few\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nAt a garment manufacturer's plant thirty colored girls were employed in\r\na separate unit. When a white girl was employed, the colored girls walked\r\nout. They explained that when they first began work in a plant employing\r\nwhite girls a precedent for this action was given. If white girls were\r\ntoo proud to work with colored girls, then colored girls should be too\r\nproud to work with white girls. It required much effort on the part of\r\nthe Urban League to correct their viewpoints.\r\n\r\nA short time ago there was considerable agitation among certain groups\r\nof Negroes over the appointment of a Negro principal for one of the\r\nelementary schools. His appointment was strongly opposed by Negroes.\r\nAlthough this may have seemed inexplicable to white people, the action\r\nwas not wholly illogical from the viewpoint of Negroes. The school in\r\nquestion, near the Negro residential area, had an attendance of about\r\n70 per cent Negro children. Negroes reasoned thus: If a Negro principal\r\nwere appointed the white teachers would eventually resign or for one\r\nreason or another be transferred; the white parents then would withdraw\r\ntheir children because there would be no white teachers, and so the first\r\nstep would be accomplished toward segregation of Negroes in the public\r\nschools. It was segregation that was opposed, although the advancement\r\nof one of their number must be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nMarcus Garvey, a West Indian Negro, with a remarkable genius for\r\norganization, four years ago began a venture on a commercial basis and\r\ndeveloped it into a definite racial movement. He conceived the notion\r\nof establishing trade relations with Africa, and accordingly organized\r\na steamship line. It was a large undertaking. There were few large Negro\r\ninvestors, and if money was to be raised it had to come in numerous small\r\namounts rather than in a few large ones. Again, if commercial relations\r\nwere to be established, there must be intelligent Negroes at the African\r\nend. The effort grew into another \"Back to Africa\" movement. To increase\r\ninterest it was necessary to campaign actively, using appeals calculated\r\nto arouse the great mass of Negroes. This Garvey did with such success\r\nthat his \"Back to Africa\" slogans created a far larger movement than\r\nhis original commercial proposition. The Universal Negro Improvement\r\nAssociation attracted more interest and members. The _Negro World_, a\r\nnewspaper with a constant and powerful appeal to racial pride, racial\r\nsolidarity, and racial independence, is the organ of the movement. During\r\nthe summer of 1920 a great convention was held. A provisional president\r\nof the Black Republic was elected, and was acclaimed the recognized\r\nleader of the black people of the world. The women were organized into\r\n\"Black Cross\" nurses and it was planned to establish a \"Black House\" in\r\nWashington. The movement has been widened to include the black peoples\r\nof the British colonies and Africa. An alliance of sympathy has been\r\ndeclared with peoples similarly disadvantaged. Thus Ireland's contention\r\nfor home rule is supported, in spite of the supposed general hostility\r\nbetween the Negroes and the Irish in the United States. The movement is\r\ncredited with 4,000,000 followers in different parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. OPINIONS OF FIFTEEN NEGROES ON DEFINITE RACIAL PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nWhat are Negroes thinking? Few white persons know the intimate reactions\r\nof Negroes to problems which they face daily. Yet it is obvious that the\r\nconduct of Negroes in practically every phase of life is determined by\r\nthese very sentiments, which for the white world remain a closed book.\r\n\r\nIt was with this in mind that a series of questions was put to seventeen\r\nNegroes whose intelligence and public-mindedness qualified them for\r\ncritical self-analysis as well as dispassionate examination of racial\r\nissues as they affect the minds, behavior, and policies of Negroes as a\r\ngroup. Ten of these Negroes lived in Chicago and represented an ordinary\r\ntype of the intelligent Negro. Five of them lived outside of Chicago.\r\nIncluded in this latter number were two Negroes whose writings have\r\nbeen widely read and who may be said to exercise some influence over\r\nthe thinking of Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen whose replies are presented here included business men,\r\nphysicians, ministers, school teachers, lawyers, and social workers.\r\nTwo were women.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE RACE RELATIONS IMPROVING?\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Putting aside for the moment the question of right\r\n     and wrong and the iniquity of the causes back of present\r\n     relations, do you believe that the relations are becoming\r\n     better or worse, or are they at a standstill?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Better, decidedly better. If it becomes unprofitable to lynch\r\n     Negroes, or unprofitable to shoot them up in riots, they will\r\n     probably more and more be let alone. The riots in Chicago and\r\n     Washington mean that not only Negroes will lose their lives.\r\n     They also indicate to me that the Negro feels that his back\r\n     is more and more to the wall, and he is bestirring himself. So\r\n     long as he is satisfied, his case is hopeless. When he begins\r\n     to force respect he will usher in the dawn of a new day. Again\r\n     there is an increasing number of evidences that white people\r\n     are waking up to the conditions. Negroes feel that some of\r\n     the \"Study Groups\" are ineffective, but the fact remains that\r\n     at one time the race question was not deemed worthy of study\r\n     except by Negroes. When all is said, I would rather be living\r\n     in 1920 than in 1870.\r\n\r\n     2. The relations are becoming worse. Relatively speaking, race\r\n     relations in America have not kept pace with progress in many\r\n     fields along other lines. The great desideratum is that the\r\n     Negro change his point of view.\r\n\r\n     3. The present relations between the races seem more tense than\r\n     formerly. This is due to the fact that Negroes have developed\r\n     within the past few years a greater race consciousness, a\r\n     great race respect. The immigration from the South which\r\n     permitted him to enter into the industrial life of the North\r\n     with very few hindrances, to partake of its civic life without\r\n     an ever-constant reminder of race, was one of the main factors\r\n     in increasing race consciousness and race respect. Another\r\n     factor was the treatment as equals and fellow human beings of\r\n     the Negro soldiers by the French soldiery and people. These\r\n     things have caused the Negro to demand the respect which he is\r\n     entitled to as a man and the privileges due him as a citizen.\r\n     The whites at the present time still object to giving him\r\n     these. This causes friction. I believe, however, that it will\r\n     be lessened as soon as the whites realize that these demands\r\n     of the Negro will not be withdrawn but will continue to be\r\n     made with greater insistence.\r\n\r\n     4. Better.\r\n\r\n     5. Much was gained through the war. However, at the present\r\n     time things seem to be at a standstill.\r\n\r\n     6. Racial relations between all races were never more acute\r\n     nor more keenly felt and resented than during the present day.\r\n\r\n     7. Conditions, I believe, are getting a little better.\r\n\r\n     8. I don't believe that consideration of right and wrong\r\n     influences fundamental reactions. One's conception of advantage\r\n     and disadvantage determines the character of every act. I\r\n     believe that all social relations are in a state of flux and\r\n     that with the improvement of mankind which is coming with\r\n     the evolution of a sense of higher values there will be an\r\n     improvement in human relationships.\r\n\r\n     9. Race relations on the whole are growing worse instead of\r\n     better, and they are crystallizing in the wrong direction. The\r\n     whites are adjusting their conscience to their conduct, and\r\n     are consciously or unconsciously justifying violation of the\r\n     Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, the Sermon on the Mount,\r\n     the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the\r\n     United States at the behest of race prejudice.\r\n\r\n     10. They are becoming distinctly worse as each year solidifies\r\n     the hatred and crystallizes the opinions of the whites which\r\n     immediately subsequent to the Civil War were in a chaotic state.\r\n\r\n     11. The last year or so has shown that riots are more quickly\r\n     started. In our opinion race relations are likely to get much\r\n     worse, especially if the present flood of European immigration\r\n     continues. But getting worse to become better is much like\r\n     a boil which, after it gathers and breaks, leaves the body\r\n     in a healthier condition. Negroes are becoming more and more\r\n     determined to enjoy their constitutional rights.\r\n\r\n     12. I am in doubt.\r\n\r\n     13. I am an optimist. I believe relations are becoming better.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS ON SOLUTION\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you believe that money and the acquisition of\r\n     wealth make an appreciable difference in the degree of respect\r\n     in which Negroes are held by their white neighbors, or in the\r\n     treatment they receive?\r\n\r\n   =========================+=============+================+===================\r\n     Economic Progress[84]  |    1866     |      1919      |      Gain in\r\n                            |             |                | Fifty-three Years\r\n   -------------------------+-------------+----------------+-------------------\r\n   Homes owned              |      12,000 |        600,000 |           588,000\r\n   Farms operated           |      20,000 |      1,000,000 |           980,000\r\n   Businesses conducted     |       2,100 |         50,000 |            47,900\r\n   Value of church property |  $1,500,000 |    $85,900,000 |       $84,400,000\r\n   Wealth accumulated       | $20,000,000 | $1,100,000,000 |    $1,080,000,000\r\n   -------------------------+-------------+----------------+-------------------\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Yes, money and wealth are the root of all good and evil.\r\n     In North Carolina, a rich Negro, McCary, who, it was alleged,\r\n     had been caught in intimate relations with a leading white\r\n     woman, was sued for money damages instead of being lynched.\r\n     Money and wealth must be widely diffused enough to make an\r\n     appreciable difference, however; isolated cases of wealth\r\n     ordinarily engender friction and hatred.\r\n\r\n     2. No, because I personally know many who are highly respected\r\n     and kindly treated in their communities though in very humble\r\n     circumstances.\r\n\r\n     3. I believe that money or wealth causes more respect to be\r\n     accorded within white people's hearts, but it is more likely\r\n     to increase racial feeling than to lessen it. The element\r\n     of jealousy among poorer whites probably gives rise to such\r\n     statements as keeping the Negro in his place. The whites of\r\n     better circumstances merely use these existing feelings to\r\n     gain their own selfish ends.\r\n\r\n     4. Yes, and no. Money is power. The power over a man's\r\n     subsistence is the power over his will. The individual who\r\n     has money is sought because he is in a position to confer\r\n     advantages. He is likewise hated because he can inflict\r\n     pain. Were race prejudice logical and based upon reason and\r\n     not hysteria, the procurement of money and the consequent\r\n     demonstration of basic equality would improve conditions.\r\n     However, the majority of persons do not think but are exploited.\r\n     Religious dogmas and racial antipathies being useful adjuncts\r\n     in the process are sufficient to outweigh material or rational\r\n     considerations.\r\n\r\n     5. Absolutely.\r\n\r\n     6. The possession of money causes whites to accord the Negro\r\n     more respect and better treatment if the particular Negro can\r\n     intelligently handle his affluent situation so as to demand\r\n     such.\r\n\r\n     7. I think that money and the acquisition of wealth make an\r\n     appreciable difference in the degree of respect in which Negroes\r\n     are held by their white neighbors; not that the prejudice\r\n     against the race is reduced considerably or possibly to any\r\n     extent, but because men worship dollars, and if they are\r\n     possessed by Negroes, Negroes fall in for additional respect\r\n     as the holders of wealth.\r\n\r\n     8. I believe that the acquisition of wealth causes marked\r\n     increase in respect, provided that a fairly large group of\r\n     Negroes in that community respectively are the possessors; but\r\n     for merely one or two persons to acquire wealth in a community\r\n     is not likely to inspire respect. It may cause its opposite.\r\n     I assume, of course, that a fair intelligence was necessary\r\n     to secure the wealth.\r\n\r\n     9. Intelligence and wealth are necessary to the self-respect\r\n     of the Negro. I doubt not that in many instances they would\r\n     increase racial friction for the time being; but the time\r\n     must come and is now near at hand, when the white race must\r\n     recognize that the whole is greater than any of its parts. A\r\n     community like Chicago, for instance, cannot be intelligent if\r\n     the Negro is ignorant; it cannot be competent if the Negro is\r\n     inefficient; it cannot be virtuous if the Negro is vicious;\r\n     it cannot be healthy if the Negro is diseased. Intelligence\r\n     and wealth will not of themselves solve the race problem, but\r\n     the problem cannot be solved without intelligence and wealth.\r\n\r\n     10. Money and wealth do make a difference in the amount of\r\n     respect accorded to individuals, as they lessen the causes for\r\n     class antagonism. The white man accords esteem to those who\r\n     are able to secure good clothing, decent homes, education,\r\n     and indulge in what are considered luxuries. These things,\r\n     too, increase the respect the Negro has for himself and make\r\n     him demand respect from others. The treatment accorded him is\r\n     not likely to be changed as his advancement tends to increase\r\n     hatred among the whites whom he rises above, and a desire not\r\n     to treat him as an equal among those whose level he reaches.\r\n\r\n     11. Money, commerce, rule the world. The average white man is\r\n     happiest when he sees the Negro down. But if the Negro has\r\n     money he is willing to conceal his prejudice and trade with\r\n     him. Money, in the possession of no matter whom, commands fear,\r\n     which is the nearest most human beings get to having respect\r\n     for others. While one rich Negro in a town, in most instances,\r\n     would receive pretty much the same treatment as other Negroes,\r\n     yet a hundred rich Negroes in that same town would certainly\r\n     make a big difference. Apply this ratio to the nation. A rich\r\n     Negro, even in Georgia or Mississippi, certainly has a far\r\n     pleasanter lot than a poor white.\r\n\r\n     12. Yes.\r\n\r\n     13. Yes, it does for white people. To quote a friend, \"It is\r\n     easy for anybody to be respectful and courteous to a million\r\n     dollars.\" This is especially true of Americans.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you believe that if Negroes were 100 per cent\r\n     literate it would make any great difference in race relations?\r\n     Are general and higher education likely to widen the breach\r\n     between Negroes and white persons, increase intolerance,\r\n     resentment, sensitiveness to insults, or can a quieted process\r\n     of adjustment or complete fusion of interests be expected?\r\n\r\n   ==================================+==========+=============+=============\r\n        Educational Progress[85]      |   1866   |    1919     |   Gain in\r\n                                     |          |             | Fifty-three\r\n                                     |          |             |    Years\r\n   ----------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------\r\n   Per cent literate                 |       10 |          80 |          70\r\n   Colleges and normal schools       |       15 |         500 |         485\r\n   Students in public schools        |  100,000 |   1,800,000 |   1,700,000\r\n   Teachers in all schools           |      600 |      38,000 |      37,400\r\n   Property for higher education     |  $60,000 | $22,000,000 | $21,940,000\r\n   Annual expenditures for education | $700,000 | $15,000,000 | $14,300,000\r\n   Raised by Negroes                 |  $80,000 |  $1,700,000 |  $1,620,000\r\n   ----------------------------------+----------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Education will help decidedly, especially that kind of\r\n     education which gives Negroes a command of some special\r\n     accomplishment in any field of endeavor. Higher education will\r\n     not in my opinion widen the breach if Negroes will consciously\r\n     and deliberately set out to educate white people as to their\r\n     ideals, ability and character, and at the same time labor to\r\n     increase the spirit of self-help and self-confidence among\r\n     their own group which will serve to decrease ignorance and\r\n     irresponsibility among the less fortunate and untrained members\r\n     of the race.\r\n\r\n     2. I conceive that literacy in itself is a cure for nothing\r\n     except illiteracy. One-hundred-per-cent literate Negroes\r\n     without proper use of their literacy may even make matters\r\n     worse. General and higher education may be expected to make\r\n     matters better only if there is general and higher education\r\n     among whites and the education on both sides is of the right\r\n     kind. In America, at present, education, where it touches\r\n     race lines, appears to be more propaganda than education. It\r\n     is reported that some histories of reconstruction taught to\r\n     Negroes by the state in parts of the United States emphasize\r\n     and detail their shortcomings and omit their virtues. Obviously\r\n     such education is education for mistrust, unrest, conflict.\r\n     It educates the races apart, and its logical consequence is\r\n     conflict. I am ready to answer, then, that general and higher\r\n     education which emphasizes likeness and passes over without\r\n     undue attention unlikeness, education which aims to have men\r\n     live in harmony and cooperation and does not aim to array\r\n     classes against classes and races against races by omissions\r\n     and emphasis, may be expected to better our race relations\r\n     in the United States provided it finds lodgment in the school\r\n     systems of both races.\r\n\r\n     3. If 10,000,000 literate Negroes were environed with\r\n     100,000,000 white men, the majority of whom were below their\r\n     cultural level, the dominant minds among the whites would\r\n     arouse ethnic antagonisms as an economic weapon to be used in\r\n     promoting their selfish ends. I believe that there is not a\r\n     single force, ethical, religious, or of any type, sufficiently\r\n     powerful to cause an individual to forego what he believes to\r\n     be his highest advantage, and the appeal to group instincts\r\n     is the easiest method of securing mass action.\r\n\r\n     4. If Negroes were 100 per cent literate they would certainly be\r\n     more sensitive to insults and more resentful. I should expect\r\n     a great increase in racial differences, unless those Negroes\r\n     imbibed a tendency to non-resistance. That, however, is far\r\n     from likely. With universal literacy, a larger acquaintance\r\n     with current events and conditions, Negroes could immeasurably\r\n     improve their living conditions, but their contacts with the\r\n     whites would be far more unpleasant.\r\n\r\n     5. One hundred per cent literacy among Negroes would make a\r\n     huge difference. In the long run it would lessen the breach\r\n     between Negroes and white persons, for Negroes would strive\r\n     for equality. The most essential thing is to produce a change\r\n     in the mental equipment of the Negro. The white man's mind\r\n     will take care of itself. What is needed is a more balanced\r\n     and equal meeting of the minds. But there would be bloodshed\r\n     at the beginning.\r\n\r\n     6. Resentment and sensitiveness to insults will increase\r\n     on the part of Negroes as they grow in intelligence, but as\r\n     their spirits rebel more insistently and positively against\r\n     insults, it cannot help but have its effect upon white men who\r\n     ignorantly mistreat them, and if the respect growing out of\r\n     love does not follow, the respect growing out of tolerance,\r\n     as in the case of the Jews in America, will ensue and result\r\n     in recognition of equal intelligence and culture.\r\n\r\n     7. Literacy must be 100 per cent on both sides to bring about\r\n     a \"complete fusion of interests\" or a \"quieted process of\r\n     adjustment.\" Intelligent Negroes among uneducated whites would\r\n     aggravate the situation.\r\n\r\n     8. If Negroes were 100 per cent literate they would command\r\n     more respect, because men always command more respect when\r\n     they are intelligent.\r\n\r\n     9. I believe in education first, last, and always as a leveller\r\n     and as a bulwark of defense. There is no race prejudice among\r\n     broadly cultured people. Art knows no such distinctions.\r\n\r\n     10. (_a_) Yes. (_b_) Not, if at the same time the education\r\n     of the whites is broadened and made more general. (_c_) Better\r\n     education of both races will facilitate a fusion of interests,\r\n     beginning probably in economic relations.\r\n\r\n     11. It would make them much more bitter, for (_a_) the Negro\r\n     would be more sensitive to injustice and have more of the\r\n     combative spirit which literacy usually gives, and (_b_)\r\n     whites would be more jealous and anxious to show the Negro\r\n     his place. I believe that such an intensification of the\r\n     struggle is desirable and necessary, as I don't believe that\r\n     the brilliant ideas necessary for solution of the race problem\r\n     can come other than as the children of the most intense and\r\n     bitter racial conflict. Of course it would defeat its purpose\r\n     if such a conflict were bloody, as then we would have a long\r\n     period of the nauseating burden such as America suffers with\r\n     today, viz.: the North attempting to reconcile the South.\r\n\r\n     12. Literacy will make a difference also in race relations. The\r\n     difference will increase in degree as literacy advances beyond\r\n     the mere ability to read and write to a wider participation\r\n     in every field of educational or intellectual endeavor. As\r\n     far as I have been able to observe, the breach between whites\r\n     and Negroes is widened as Negroes advance in education and\r\n     culture. The educated Negro rarely comes in contact with the\r\n     white man as a menial or laborer--the only point of contact\r\n     which the great majority of white people want. He will respect\r\n     the Negro teacher, lawyer, doctor, or business man who knows\r\n     his work thoroughly and can do as well as he. He is not likely,\r\n     however, to find any reason to co-operate with this class of\r\n     Negroes, and the Negroes do seek such co-operation.\r\n\r\n     13. (_a_) Yes. (_b_) In slavery times whites made it a crime to\r\n     teach Negroes to read. That desire, in up-to-date garb, remains\r\n     in the breast of most whites today. To many white persons a\r\n     Negro of superior talent and refinement is a more detestable\r\n     production than the most pronounced rogue. Most white persons,\r\n     even of the best quality, are secretly displeased at a Negro\r\n     of this type. They were brought up to regard Negroes as being\r\n     below them, and the sight is a blow to their vanity. (_c_) A\r\n     dollar talks much more sweetly than Emerson or Shakespeare and\r\n     even Christ to most men, therefore a process of adjustment or\r\n     complete fusion of interests will be effected chiefly through\r\n     trade relationship, not esthetics.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: If unrestricted suffrage were given Negroes\r\n     throughout the United States, would matters be helped?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Equal suffrage between the races in some parts of the country\r\n     would doubtless precipitate a temporary disturbance, but it\r\n     is not thinkable that under democratic institutions any group\r\n     or class can be permanently or for a long while refused equal\r\n     participation in the government under which they live and by\r\n     which they are controlled. Shall we do evil that good may come?\r\n\r\n     2. Every appreciable increase in power among Negroes will be\r\n     met with jealousy and repression by the whites. Unrestricted\r\n     suffrage does not mean much when people have guns at the polls\r\n     and dare other people to vote. Its inception would mean acute\r\n     racial trouble, I think, but if the Negroes used the same\r\n     means and methods to register their vote as the whites do to\r\n     keep them from registering it, and kept it up long enough,\r\n     ultimately conditions would be very much improved where Negroes\r\n     constitute about half the population of a unit.\r\n\r\n     3. Yes. Even though Negroes might not vote intelligently at\r\n     the outset, they would tend to vote for their own welfare.\r\n     The Negro does not feel wholeheartedly that he is a part\r\n     of the American people. But with the vote he would be in a\r\n     better position to work for common ends. Though voting for the\r\n     capitalist parties would not mean much to the Negro, a vote\r\n     for the money barons is better than no vote at all.\r\n\r\n     4. Unrestricted suffrage is a right as well as a privilege. It\r\n     is essential for building up the sense of responsibility and\r\n     loyalty among any group of people in a democracy founded on the\r\n     ideals of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     5. Yes, the ballot is a protection which the Negro now is\r\n     intelligent enough to use and keep. In the present segregated\r\n     condition of the Negro, the ballot has a genuine property value.\r\n     Police protection, better lighted and better paved streets, I\r\n     am convinced, must come to him through the ballot or else he\r\n     does not get them.\r\n\r\n     6. Unrestricted Negro suffrage would help a great deal in\r\n     securing for Negroes the things it is possible to secure through\r\n     the use of the ballot. Political parties, as well as the Negro\r\n     himself, would realize the power of Negro suffrage and would\r\n     doubtless be inclined to cater to that vote. The exercise of\r\n     such unlimited suffrage is likely to increase for a time the\r\n     tenseness in race relations, as the whites would not readily\r\n     give up the domination they have secured. The agitation in\r\n     Ohio and in the Middle West over the exercise by the Negro of\r\n     his suffrage shows how clearly the white man fears the power\r\n     of the ballot when used by the Negro.\r\n\r\n     7. Other things remaining the same, it would not.\r\n\r\n     8. Not necessarily by that fact alone. The ultimate value of\r\n     the right of suffrage is conditioned by the intelligence with\r\n     which that right is used.\r\n\r\n     9. This goes without saying. In Chicago, Negroes exercise\r\n     considerable influence in the city administration, because\r\n     of their strong political power. The same is true of New York\r\n     and Cleveland. Apply this to the nation.\r\n\r\n     10. Yes.\r\n\r\n     11. Yes, if we had a third party with racial cohesion.\r\n\r\n     12. Suffrage to be effective must be taken and not conferred.\r\n     \"Who would be free, himself must strike the blow.\" A man has\r\n     no right that he can't protect and defend.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: How about religion as a solvent of racial\r\n     difficulties and differences?\r\n\r\n     =========================+=========+===========+===================\r\n      Religious Progress[86]   |  1866   |   1919    |      Gain in\r\n                              |         |           | Fifty-three Years\r\n     -------------------------+---------+-----------+-------------------\r\n     Number of churches       |     700 |    43,000 |            42,300\r\n     Number of communicants   | 600,000 | 4,800,000 |         4,200,000\r\n     Number of Sunday schools |   1,000 |    46,000 |            45,000\r\n     Sunday-school pupils     |  50,000 | 2,250,000 |         2,200,000\r\n     -------------------------+---------+-----------+-------------------\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Religion, if it ever becomes a vital force in the everyday\r\n     affairs of people, will be one of the greatest forces in\r\n     solving race difficulties. At the present time its influence is\r\n     practically nil. The average church is still calling worn-out\r\n     theology religion; those which have adopted a more modern and\r\n     practical view of religion are too few to exert any influence\r\n     in race problems.\r\n\r\n     2. Religion per se, to my mind, has failed, but Christianity,\r\n     the spirit manifested by Jesus Christ in his life and which\r\n     he commanded his followers to imitate, if adopted in its vital\r\n     truth and simplicity by all professing Christians, could solve\r\n     all the difficulties.\r\n\r\n     3. Religion might be helpful in solving racial difficulties\r\n     if it were tried--but it has not been very largely tried yet.\r\n\r\n     4. Religion as a solvent of racial difficulties is necessary,\r\n     but both groups will need to practice it to the same degree.\r\n\r\n     5. The religion of America, or of any other country, is merely\r\n     an index to the national character. Religion expresses itself\r\n     in the church, and the church is a capitalistic institution.\r\n     Expressed religion in America, because its pecuniary existence\r\n     largely depends upon the rank and file of the people who\r\n     support it, will not rise above the prejudices and folkways\r\n     of that rank and file. Religion will not solve many racial\r\n     difficulties or differences.\r\n\r\n     6. Religion hardly touches the deeper motivations. It may\r\n     regulate details, but usually the priest-craft succeeds by\r\n     sophistry, emphasis or omission in avoiding certain fundamental\r\n     issues in their religious exhortations. It often appears that\r\n     the preacher is retained to idealize the crassness of the\r\n     world, and unpleasant things are simply taboo. He must look\r\n     to his salary.\r\n\r\n     7. It has no utility. It had no utility in the world war and\r\n     so a fortiori could have no utility in our race problem where\r\n     more bitter issues are involved.\r\n\r\n     8. Unfortunately religion has little sanction over the social\r\n     conduct where interest and passions are involved. This was too\r\n     sadly manifested in the world war. It is to be hoped, however,\r\n     that there may arise a moral and spiritual renaissance under\r\n     whose sanction religion may exercise controlling influence\r\n     over the frictional relations among men.\r\n\r\n     9. Very much overestimated is religion as a solvent of racial\r\n     differences. Neither Negroes nor whites have enough confidence\r\n     in it to put it into practical application. No one thing will\r\n     bring about the Negro's real emancipation. The fight must\r\n     be carried on in every sphere where prejudice has vitiated\r\n     relations.\r\n\r\n     10. Religion has failed to solve the racial difficulties and\r\n     differences in America because its principles have never been\r\n     practiced by the people. Religion has remained a beautiful\r\n     theory. If the religious principles were practiced there would\r\n     be no racial difficulties.\r\n\r\n     11. Utterly valueless. The average individual cannot think.\r\n     He lives only in the concrete. Material advantages outweigh\r\n     philosophical benefits. Deprive religion of the moving force\r\n     of fear which its exponents engender, and it will entirely\r\n     cease to be dynamic.\r\n\r\n     12. The religion of Christ will prove a solvent if men ever\r\n     give it a trial.\r\n\r\n     13. Religion, in our opinion, has never settled any question.\r\n     Nothing else contains so much the germs of strife. Mankind,\r\n     throughout the ages, has never been able to agree on it. The\r\n     history of Europe, Asia and Northern Africa is one long record\r\n     of warring religions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL ADJUSTMENTS\r\n\r\n     _Question_: What are some of the most pronounced mental\r\n     complexes experienced in adjusting your personal desires and\r\n     expectations to the present social system?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. A constant haunting feeling when in the presence of white\r\n     persons that they desire to shun me because of my color; that\r\n     they are eager to use me to further their ends under the guise\r\n     of piety or patronizing the \"good-feeling-toward-your-people\"\r\n     attitude. I suffer from time to time an acute embarrassment\r\n     because of uncouth conduct in the presence of white persons\r\n     on the part of uncultured Negroes. Such conduct embarrasses me\r\n     generally, but the presence of white persons who are supposed to\r\n     be inimical seems to be the dominant element in the situation.\r\n\r\n     2. The most pronounced mental complex which I experience in\r\n     adjusting my desires and expectations to the present social\r\n     system is not the \"inferiority complex\" with which most\r\n     Negroes are charged by the whites. I desire all that the social\r\n     system affords; but as to expectation it is necessary for me\r\n     to use auto-hypnotism to make myself expect it in order that\r\n     I can present to the white man the front of optimism, the\r\n     necessary air of expectancy to secure success. The shocks and\r\n     disappointments which a Negro must constantly experience tend\r\n     to get him in the attitude of expecting nothing.\r\n\r\n     3. I can't describe the mental complexes, but some are caused\r\n     by situations such as these: I go to the library to get a book,\r\n     and I am told that I must sit in a seat among dusty shelves\r\n     of newspaper files at a table marked \"For colored people\"; in\r\n     order to see a play I have to sit in the gallery. I submit to\r\n     that and when I get to the theater, I am told that no seats\r\n     are reserved for colored people. I go to a lecture by the Hon.\r\n     Mr. So and So (white) and he discusses the Declaration of\r\n     Independence and the Constitution, creating much enthusiasm\r\n     among the unthinking and some of the thinking. Then the next\r\n     morning I take up the paper of which the same gentleman is the\r\n     editor, and read a sneering editorial on the race question,\r\n     and so on.\r\n\r\n     4. Personally, I am able to impersonalize my relation to the\r\n     situation, and experience no mental perplexities. I try to\r\n     preserve a rational attitude in an irrational environment and\r\n     objectify cruelty, injustice and wrong. I know that I as an\r\n     individual am not Jim Crowed, or disfranchised or socially\r\n     isolated; it is the race to which I belong. My only perplexity\r\n     is how to remove these racial, not personal, disqualifications.\r\n\r\n     5. Determination to fulfill my personal desires in spite of\r\n     the present social system; a loss of respect for the white\r\n     man's sense of justice.\r\n\r\n     6. The arrogance of the poor ignorant white man and the\r\n     snobbishness of the middle class. This is the stumbling-block\r\n     for the future of our race to overcome.\r\n\r\n     7. Trying to get white persons, as employers, etc., to accept\r\n     me as a man first of all, then to judge me on my merits,\r\n     irrespective of my color. Trying to attain to the same degree\r\n     of success and liberty of any other man of my training and\r\n     experience in spite of the world in which I live.\r\n\r\n     8. Amused and almost cynical tolerance. A desire to reap\r\n     the greatest possible advantages from the system, without\r\n     permitting my intelligence to admit that it is right because\r\n     it is personally advantageous.\r\n\r\n     9. My desires are never adjusted to the present \"social system\";\r\n     they are constantly out of harmony with the practices of our\r\n     so-called democracy, as these practices relate to the Negro.\r\n\r\n     10. If this question means what I think it does, space will\r\n     not permit an intelligent answer.\r\n\r\n     11. A hyper-sensitiveness in regard to the subject Negro;\r\n     a tendency to see racial antagonism as a motive of conduct\r\n     in every act of white persons when perhaps it is sometimes\r\n     absent; a hesitancy about entering public places or approaching\r\n     individuals for fear of rebuff or insult; a withdrawal into a\r\n     Negro world in which almost every thought and act are colored\r\n     by a racial aspect before a humanitarian one, are some of the\r\n     mental complexes experienced in a greater or less degree by\r\n     almost every colored person.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you believe that Negroes are prejudiced against\r\n     white persons?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Some are, but the prejudice is due to nurture rather than\r\n     to nature.\r\n\r\n     2. Prejudice means pre-judgment. Negroes come into the world\r\n     to find most white persons disliking them. They grow up in\r\n     an atmosphere where they find whites ready to insult them\r\n     because of the color Nature saw fit to give them. Therefore,\r\n     knowledge, not prejudice, causes Negroes to dislike whites.\r\n     Human beings, and even dumb animals, love only those who\r\n     love them. The average Negro is, however, quick to drop this\r\n     defensive attitude when he meets a fair-minded white person.\r\n     Perhaps too easily, as he is often taken advantage of by shrewd\r\n     whites disguised as friends.\r\n\r\n     3. I do not believe that Negroes are inherently prejudiced\r\n     against the white race. Personally, I have absolutely no such\r\n     prejudice. I do not believe that the white race is inherently\r\n     prejudiced against the Negro, but that it is wholly a feeling\r\n     stimulated by social opinion which can be modified and\r\n     controlled. I put in evidence the facts: First, when social\r\n     pressure is removed, white women marry Negro men, and white\r\n     men marry Negro women. Second, the superior always shows\r\n     prejudice against the inferior, whether superiority is claimed\r\n     on basis of wealth, culture, birth, or position. The prejudices\r\n     of inferior against superior is never so pronounced as that\r\n     of superior against inferior. Natural antipathy is mutually\r\n     reciprocal. Third, some white persons are less influenced by\r\n     it than others. Fourth, race antagonism as such is scarcely\r\n     discernible where Latin civilization and the Catholic religion\r\n     are in control. Fifth, it does not exist in the Mohammedan\r\n     dispensation. Sixth, the experience of thousands of Negro\r\n     soldiers in France proves its comparative absence. Seventh,\r\n     race prejudice seems to be principally the vice of the Teuton\r\n     and the Anglo-Saxon, which must be subject to ultimate control.\r\n     It will not be quite so strong among Germans as it was before\r\n     the war.\r\n\r\n     4. I do not believe that Negroes as a race are prejudiced\r\n     against white people, although I am conscious of an increasing\r\n     prejudice against white people on the part of many individual\r\n     Negroes, especially educated colored women who live in the\r\n     South and resent keenly the indiscriminate approaches of white\r\n     men.\r\n\r\n     5. Many Negroes are cynical of all the professions of white\r\n     men. They often express their hatred of white people openly.\r\n     I think, however, that feeling is more prevalent among the\r\n     younger Negroes than among the older ones.\r\n\r\n     6. Many pretend to be. Most of them are not.\r\n\r\n     7. Yes, 98 per cent of them are.\r\n\r\n     8. Not as individuals. They are affected by the spirit of\r\n     mass hostility to dissimilar masses based upon the desire to\r\n     appropriate and retain advantages. Racial prejudices are the\r\n     products of the will of dominant individuals evoking responses\r\n     from weaker intelligences and serving the purpose of the\r\n     dominating mind.\r\n\r\n     9. If so, to a very slight extent. What feeling most Negroes\r\n     have is created almost solely to offset the prejudice and\r\n     antagonism of the whites. The prejudice of the whites I might\r\n     describe as primary; that of the colored, secondary.\r\n\r\n     10. Yes; too much so among some groups.\r\n\r\n     11. Negroes in most cases are very much prejudiced against\r\n     whites.\r\n\r\n     12. Yes. The difference lies in the degree. Prejudice is\r\n     artificial. It is learned. The white boy and girl have been\r\n     \"taught\" more prejudice than the Negro. Negroes seldom teach\r\n     prejudice outright. When they learn it, it is inescapable.\r\n     America is a school, I fear, at present where even the most\r\n     backward learns something of prejudice whether he will it or\r\n     not.\r\n\r\n     13. I believe there is a strong prejudice against white persons.\r\n     This antipathy is, I believe, not based on racial unlikeness,\r\n     but on resentment because of cruel treatment as an inferior.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Are you ever conscious of a feeling of racial\r\n     inferiority or even the desire to compensate for a supposed\r\n     inferiority?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. I attribute inferiority and superiority alike to individuals,\r\n     not race. I have every confidence that my race is capable of\r\n     producing as great men, and proportionately as many of them,\r\n     as any other race under the sun. I trace to environment the\r\n     responsibility for not releasing their energy upon constructive\r\n     work, but concentrating it upon gaining a living or a chance\r\n     to gain a living. Many times I feel the desire to compensate\r\n     for a supposed inferiority, because I believe in nailing a\r\n     lie wherever possible.\r\n\r\n     2. I never have a feeling of racial inferiority or a desire to\r\n     compensate for a supposed inferiority (with reservations). I am\r\n     usually cognizant of the fact that most white people consider\r\n     the Negro an inferior. This often causes the bristles to rise\r\n     on my back.\r\n\r\n     3. Personally, at no moment of our lives. The Negro is really\r\n     superior in stamina. His race is progressing, while the whites\r\n     appear to be standing still. The white race has had seven\r\n     thousand years or more of education and civilization, yet in\r\n     this prosperous republic today the average white person is\r\n     comparatively poor and possesses little education. The Negro,\r\n     in spite of the oppressive handicap due to color, is progressing\r\n     along all lines, commercial, professional and artistic.\r\n\r\n     4. I am never conscious of racial inferiority, but I am a firm\r\n     believer in the theory that any human being will be whatever\r\n     his environment and his heredity will make of him, regardless\r\n     of the color of his skin or the form of his skull. One in\r\n     considering this point of view should be sure not to confuse\r\n     the words \"inferiority\" and \"inequality.\"\r\n\r\n     5. No.\r\n\r\n     6. I feel no desire to apologize to the world because I am a\r\n     colored woman; I had to be of some race, and here I am.\r\n\r\n     7. No. I believe that accidents of environment determine\r\n     relative positions.\r\n\r\n     8. Decidedly no! I believe absolutely in my own worth as a man\r\n     and as a Negro and defer only to wider experience, knowledge,\r\n     or skill, whether possessed by white persons or Negroes.\r\n\r\n     9. No!\r\n\r\n     10. No.\r\n\r\n     11. I never have a feeling of racial inferiority or a desire\r\n     to compensate for a supposed inferiority.\r\n\r\n     12. Personally, I am absolutely unconscious of any feeling of\r\n     racial inferiority. I recognize the control of social forces\r\n     and influences which may seem too strong to be overcome at\r\n     present. I simply suffer it to be so now.\r\n\r\n     13. I have never felt any racial inferiority, though always\r\n     when thrown in school work or business with white people\r\n     the desire to do my work as well or better than they is very\r\n     strong. This desire comes primarily from a desire to show that\r\n     the Negro is not inferior in his ability.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRO PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you believe that there should be recognized\r\n     leaders of Negroes? Are there such persons whom you regard as\r\n     qualified for leadership? Discuss their merits and demerits.\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. As long as the dominant power treats with us as with Negroes\r\n     rather than as with American citizens, there will be need of\r\n     recognized leaders; but these leaders should be chosen by the\r\n     Negroes themselves, not chosen and imposed by others.\r\n\r\n     2. Yes and no. Theoretically and ultimately, no. Practically\r\n     and immediately, yes. In any clearly differentiated group the\r\n     spokesman should come from and grow out of conditions within\r\n     the group. In a community in which there were cultural and\r\n     not ethnic divisions there would be no need for Negro leaders.\r\n     What was good for the hive would be for the good of each bee.\r\n     However, in a community in which color is a target, defensive\r\n     alliances under the best possible leadership are a _sine\r\n     qua non_. I am too close to the problem to have sufficient\r\n     perspective to attempt the discussion of personalities.\r\n\r\n     3. Logically, no. Practically, under present conditions it is\r\n     imperative to have Negro leaders. Where people do not read\r\n     much, do not study much, they are incapable of doing much\r\n     thinking. Better a bad leader under such circumstances than\r\n     no leader at all. The very clashes between rival leaders with\r\n     their several points of view force the rank and file to attend\r\n     to conditions and compare conflicting views. This often marks\r\n     the beginning of interests in striving to improve conditions.\r\n     The merits of leaders are considered in another place.\r\n\r\n     4. I do not think that it will be possible, or advisable, to\r\n     attempt to appoint or elect leaders for Negroes. Naturally men\r\n     and women of exceptional powers will be recognized by those\r\n     of less developed powers as leaders of thought in various\r\n     connections in their several localities.\r\n\r\n     5. There should be no recognized leaders of Negroes except those\r\n     who are selected from groups or bodies of Negroes--selected by\r\n     them for a particular purpose or a particular cause. I do not\r\n     believe in Negro leadership secured by members of the white\r\n     race and then handed to our group as a leader without first\r\n     having had the endorsement of the Negroes themselves.\r\n\r\n     6. Yes. Emmet Scott, Dr. Du Bois and Mr. Grimke. Mr. Scott has\r\n     great executive ability. Dr. Du Bois is a great philosopher\r\n     and an ardent race rights advocate. Mr. Grimke a scholar and\r\n     wise counsellor. This combination as Leaders' Council would,\r\n     in my opinion, conserve our best interests. Mr. Scott is too\r\n     much of an opportunist for an ideal leader, Dr. Du Bois is too\r\n     radical at times, Mr. Grimke is too much of an intellectual\r\n     recluse.\r\n\r\n     7. There should be recognized leaders of Negroes, recognized\r\n     by Negroes because of their merits in their particular fields\r\n     of endeavor. There are Negroes qualified for such leadership\r\n     today, but their affiliations with organizations largely\r\n     or partly supported by philanthropic whites negative their\r\n     usefulness.\r\n\r\n     8. I believe every community should develop its own leadership.\r\n     A great deal of our present leadership is too largely clerical\r\n     and political and therefore not free, broad, and independent.\r\n     We need a leadership which is free, courageous, and which\r\n     possesses a program and definite objective.\r\n\r\n     9. I do not approve self-appointed leadership or leadership\r\n     bestowed by white friends because they can command funds. If\r\n     there are to be leaders, they should be chosen by selection so\r\n     that there can be \"solemn referendum.\" With this qualification,\r\n     there are a large number of Negroes whom I would vote for as\r\n     leaders. The trouble now is that our so-called leaders are\r\n     not responsible to those whom they are supposed to represent.\r\n\r\n     10. There should not be; as soon as one appears, destructive\r\n     influences are brought to bear upon him both from within and\r\n     without, making of him within a short period an extremely\r\n     artificial and useless guide, but who is followed, nevertheless,\r\n     by Negroes blindly to their own great injury.\r\n\r\n     11. I believe firmly in the capacity of the race for\r\n     self-leadership. Any people can govern themselves better than an\r\n     outsider is apt to govern them, unless the alien is willing to\r\n     become naturalized in the group he aspires to lead. The white\r\n     race at present is unable or unwilling to become naturalized\r\n     in the Negro group.\r\n\r\n     12. The basis of Negro leadership should rest on the ability\r\n     to develop within the masses a desire and the power to obtain\r\n     better homes, education and their privileges as citizens without\r\n     belittling themselves or adopting the toadying attitude. Any\r\n     individual who is striving in a community to secure these\r\n     things for his people should be considered a leader. The mere\r\n     ability to write a book, edit a magazine, or publicly express\r\n     the cause of the Negro is not a sufficient qualification for\r\n     leadership even though it does bring national prominence.\r\n\r\n     13. (_a_) Under the circumstances, yes. (_b_) Useless to discuss\r\n     this. People usually choose as their leaders those who express\r\n     most strongly prevailing sentiments. (_c_) The followers are\r\n     their own judges of merit and demerit.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: What, in your opinion, are some of the greatest\r\n     mistakes of prominent Negroes in their policies or stand on\r\n     racial issues?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Most are honest, I think, but emphasize too much some one\r\n     pet solution, such as \"Get Property,\" \"Industrial Education,\"\r\n     etc. Many are insincere, using their influence to feather\r\n     their own nests, letting the race go hang. An intolerance\r\n     among Negroes themselves for those among their number who have\r\n     different opinions as to the wisest courses in arriving at\r\n     the better conditions which they equally are trying to bring\r\n     about. Some characteristics possessed by most of the so-called\r\n     leaders may be summed as follows:\r\n\r\n          Don't bother and leave all in the hands of God.\r\n\r\n          Overestimation of the Negroes' present attainments,\r\n          eulogies instead of information.\r\n\r\n          Oratory of denunciation only, raising prejudice\r\n          against whites but offering no course of action or\r\n          thought leading to improvement either of Negroes\r\n          personally or individually, or as a race.\r\n\r\n          A disinclination to tell the blunt truth when\r\n          interracial conferences offer the opportunity for\r\n          an exchange of views.\r\n\r\n     2. The greatest mistake that leaders usually make is that of\r\n     failing to study the problems towards the solution of which\r\n     they are working. They also are not willing to co-operate with\r\n     leaders along other lines.\r\n\r\n     3. Selfishness and lack of moral backbone in the face of\r\n     possible financial loss.\r\n\r\n     4. To accept that there is a purely racial psychology. And to\r\n     think, act, or accept as a Negro and not as a man.\r\n\r\n     5. (_a_) Compromising attitude; (_b_) depending on support\r\n     of white people financially and morally; (_c_) failure to\r\n     co-operate freely with all cases among the Negroes themselves.\r\n\r\n     6. Lack of absolute frankness with white people about mind and\r\n     feeling of Negroes; lack of absolute frankness with Negroes\r\n     about their own shortcomings and failure. I believe that many\r\n     men are overcoming this weakness.\r\n\r\n     7. Short-sightedness. They seem not to look ahead and see the\r\n     consequence of their arrangements and concessions. Most of them,\r\n     because of the manner of their selections, are unacquainted\r\n     with history, sociology, etc. They see the present, not even the\r\n     present generation. They fall into advices and concessions today\r\n     which prove a noose tomorrow. There is lack of poise. Often\r\n     they seem to know nothing of a means. There is no intermediate\r\n     ground; it simply is or it is not. This absolutism inevitably\r\n     leads to trouble. This of course does not apply to all of our\r\n     leaders.\r\n\r\n     8. The greatest mistakes of prominent Negroes in their stands:\r\n     A statesman is supposed to be the fusion of two necessary\r\n     elements: (1) the theorist, such as we have in our college\r\n     professors and most of our writers; and (2) the practical\r\n     politician who can get things done. The main fault with most of\r\n     our prominent Negroes in their policies and behavior is that\r\n     they never accomplish this fusion; all fall very definitely\r\n     into either group one or group two, and either group by itself\r\n     is helpless.\r\n\r\n     9. The greatest mistake of prominent Negroes, in my judgment,\r\n     is that they pay too great a deference to the attitude of the\r\n     white race rather than to the inherent demands of humanity.\r\n     Jesus refused to defer to the arrogance of Pilate, although\r\n     he exercised the power of life or death.\r\n\r\n     10. Faulty perspective due to improper training; failure\r\n     to grasp the economic significance of race prejudice; and a\r\n     tendency to preach the doctrine of non-resistance when they get\r\n     rich and fat. The younger crop of Negroes, armed with modern\r\n     scientific education are remedying the first two. Time will\r\n     show whether they will prove more unselfish.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFENSIVE PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n     _Question_: If it may be assumed that there are conditions which\r\n     are intolerable, or, at least, a constant source of irritation\r\n     to Negroes, it is to be expected that some defensive philosophy\r\n     is necessary to give poise, dignity, and self-respect. What is\r\n     your philosophy? What basic philosophical considerations, even\r\n     if not crystallized into dogma, support your outlook on life,\r\n     or that of Negroes of your acquaintance and general point of\r\n     view?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. I believe racial solidarity, as I conceive it, to be the\r\n     defensive philosophy of many Negroes. My own philosophy, if I\r\n     have one, is summed up in the belief that potentially the Negro\r\n     has the same qualities making for success and usefulness as\r\n     any other group. All he needs is an even break. I believe in\r\n     an offensive program to teach pride in their achievements and\r\n     prepare themselves for keen, hard competition all along the\r\n     line. I believe in attacking the indifference and ignorance\r\n     of white people which is largely the basis of prejudice, by\r\n     educating them to respect and believe in the self-defending,\r\n     non-favor-asking, justice-demanding Negro.\r\n\r\n     2. My philosophy rests upon two propositions. The first is\r\n     borrowed from the Latin \"I am a man; nothing human is foreign\r\n     to me.\" The second is: A man is entirely the product of his\r\n     environment. (Heredity is the sum of our former environments.)\r\n     Given, then, an essential equality in all men, temporary\r\n     advantages are the results of environment. Self-preservation\r\n     and its corollary, the desire for the preservation of species,\r\n     are fundamental traits, and the Israelites, killing those who\r\n     said Sibboleth and not Shibboleth, have their prototype in those\r\n     who make non-conformity in hair, color, speech or culture, a\r\n     crime and inferiority stamp. It seems rational to suppose,\r\n     however, that man may evolve sufficient mentality, and far\r\n     enough away from the brute, to make differences in culture and\r\n     not physical characteristics the basis of distinctions. Until\r\n     then the pursuit of pleasure and advantage is the proper aim\r\n     of life.\r\n\r\n     3. The Negro maintains his self-respect and dignity in the\r\n     face of intolerable conditions because of his natural optimism\r\n     and his hope for and belief in the approach of a better day.\r\n     I teach my children that they should not seek companionship\r\n     with any other children who reluctantly associate with them,\r\n     not that my children should consider themselves in any way\r\n     inferior or unequal, but that they should be possessed of too\r\n     much personal pride to wish association with those who would\r\n     not be pleasant and agreeable.\r\n\r\n     4. My philosophy is a pessimistic one. There is often a sense\r\n     of hopelessness. To live in the white group makes it incumbent\r\n     on me to overcome many presumptions on their part. On the\r\n     other hand, to create mutual understandability is a phase of\r\n     aggressive conduct I follow. To conduct one's self in a more\r\n     socially acceptable way, viz., to do a certain thing better than\r\n     any member of the dominant group, is another excellent mode of\r\n     enhancing social values. But the best way of all is to assume\r\n     an offensive attack, and place the white group or individual\r\n     on the defensive at all times. This can be accomplished only\r\n     by a superior type of mind.\r\n\r\n     5. Never submit passively to unnecessary indignities. Keep\r\n     alive the spirit of protest against all injustice from black\r\n     or white. I am just as good or at least my right to decent\r\n     treatment is as good as that of any other man. I am what I\r\n     think and do, not what some other person does to me or thinks\r\n     about me.\r\n\r\n     6. My experience with the segregation tendency has taught me\r\n     to look down upon the system. It bristles with contradictions,\r\n     being foolishly fastidious, fanatically unreasonable, and\r\n     usually carried out by the uncultured element. Moreover, the\r\n     promoters of the system are not ready to discuss the matter;\r\n     it is simply taboo. The immoral forays of members of this\r\n     super-sensitive \"superior race\" coupled with criminal economical\r\n     advantages maintained by intimidation aside from being tragic\r\n     lends a subtle hypocrisy which does not escape even the casual\r\n     observer. Add to this the hysteria of the thing and you have a\r\n     medley of the ludicrous hypocritical, illogical, and hysterical.\r\n     Any man then who is honest and self-respecting easily comes to\r\n     feel himself superior to the promoters of the institutions.\r\n     One moves among these conditions with a feeling probably not\r\n     unlike that of Socrates among the Athenians, although, if he\r\n     chances to be a man of color, with far less freedom of conduct\r\n     and speech.\r\n\r\n     7. My philosophy would be that by our conduct as a group we\r\n     will be able to disprove the principles upon which the white\r\n     man's intolerance is based; we should assert our rights and use\r\n     propaganda to change the white man's point of view civically,\r\n     morally and in the economic world.\r\n\r\n     8. I am firmly convinced that a dignified friendly attitude\r\n     towards the white race is the wisest course for the Negro:\r\n     education, industry, and good manners will win for us more\r\n     real tolerance and consideration than continued agitation and\r\n     bitterness. Truth and justice will demand fair play in time,\r\n     and sentiment must be molded by appeal to intelligence and\r\n     finer sentiments through undisputable facts.\r\n\r\n     9. Cultivate a wholesome discontent with untoward conditions\r\n     and use every lawful means to improve these conditions, so\r\n     that it may not be said that we are satisfied with unjust\r\n     discriminations. \"The talent for misery is the fulcrum of\r\n     progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSEGREGATION AND RACIAL SOLIDARITY\r\n\r\n     _Question_: What, to your mind, is the distinction, either in\r\n     point of view or definite racial aim, between segregation and\r\n     \"racial solidarity\"?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Segregation implies coercion by the dominant group.\r\n     Racial solidarity implies certain subjective tendencies\r\n     of like-mindedness. Racial solidarity may be enhanced by\r\n     segregation but it thrives best if its causes have their roots\r\n     in the will to progress rather than the will to exist amidst\r\n     oppression. Though segregation may aid the tendency toward\r\n     racial solidarity, neither segregation nor racial solidarity\r\n     are to be advised in a modern civilization. Racial solidarity\r\n     for protective reasons with strong limitations (never legal)\r\n     may be advisable today in America.\r\n\r\n     2. The definite racial aim of segregation is to prevent the\r\n     contact of races physically; to prevent Negroes from living\r\n     with the whites in their neighborhoods and vice versa; to keep\r\n     themselves separate as a group, thus making segregation of\r\n     schools and other institutions a natural sequence. Whereas, the\r\n     aim of racial solidarity is to focus the financial, economic,\r\n     political and social strength of the group for the purpose\r\n     of meeting the attacks of the white race as well as for the\r\n     solution of group problems; for example, solid financial\r\n     strength would mean Negro business houses of every description,\r\n     banks, etc.; it would mean that the race as a unit would\r\n     withdraw its patronage and support from any institution or\r\n     business that discriminated against members of their group;\r\n     they would boycott as a unit any brand of goods made by a firm\r\n     dealing unjustly with colored patrons, etc. It means that\r\n     politically the group would throw its strength to the party\r\n     whose principles are in harmony with the welfare of the Negro.\r\n\r\n     3. Segregation presupposes a force from without which seeks\r\n     to compel those of the same race or nationality or religious\r\n     belief to remain among themselves, separated from those\r\n     of another group supposedly superior. Grouping together\r\n     either for purposes of living or of religious worship or for\r\n     other purposes, with the idea of developing a group or race\r\n     consciousness and thus to develop \"pride of race,\" presupposes\r\n     a force from within--that is a conscious desire of the people\r\n     themselves to develop the latent powers within their own group\r\n     through intensive application.\r\n\r\n     4. Negroes tend to flock together as do members of other\r\n     racial groups. I do not regard this as segregation. When an\r\n     effort is made from without to group them together, which\r\n     carries along with it restrictions of movement, residence or\r\n     activity, we have segregation. Racial solidarity seems to me\r\n     to be the conscious or unconscious reaction to segregation.\r\n     It is a doctrine of revolt.\r\n\r\n     5. Segregation means to me regulation of racial contacts by law\r\n     or force between white and colored people. Racial solidarity is\r\n     a natural development of massing because of race congeniality.\r\n\r\n     6. Segregation and racial solidarity differ fundamentally\r\n     and essentially in the motive prompting the individual act to\r\n     be discussed. Segregation is the forcing apart of any group\r\n     into a less favorable environment in order that advantage or\r\n     position may accrue to those in authority. Race solidarity\r\n     represents the active part in the same rôle, and is the effort\r\n     of individuals to utilize similarity of aims or of situation\r\n     as the basis of an offensive or defensive alliance.\r\n\r\n     7. Racial segregation is harmful as a social aim. Racial\r\n     segregation is the result of the attempt of a more powerful\r\n     group to impose its ideas of racial inferiority upon a weaker\r\n     group. The weaker group in its attempt to defeat this program\r\n     rightly adopts racial solidarity as a definite aim in order to\r\n     strengthen itself both to resist discrimination which usually\r\n     follows segregation and to attack the vicious and narrow-minded\r\n     motives of proponents of racial segregation.\r\n\r\n     8. Voluntary segregation is a step, consciously or unconsciously\r\n     taken, toward racial solidarity.\r\n\r\n     9. It seems to me that segregation and racial solidarity differ\r\n     in that the latter is merely a mental attitude whereas the\r\n     former, though it includes a certain mental attitude, is chiefly\r\n     characterized by a sort of hysterical physical separation.\r\n     Racial solidarity obviously can exist among groups separated by\r\n     considerable distance, as among Jews. When the mental attitude\r\n     is not, or is felt not to be, adequate to effect the desired\r\n     separation among races, then a sort of hysteria ensues and\r\n     separation is one of the forms in which this hysteria expresses\r\n     itself. On the whole we may have reason to doubt its efficacy,\r\n     for it bears a relation to race solidarity akin to that which\r\n     legal restraint bears to moral restraint.\r\n\r\n     It seems probable that both racial solidarity and segregation\r\n     aim at the same thing. Segregation, it seems to me, in the\r\n     long run must prove a poor means to the end, and it would\r\n     not require a very imaginative person to think that in its\r\n     crass forms it may destroy the very end it aims to achieve by\r\n     creating a prejudice of a violent and consuming sort.\r\n\r\n     10. The term \"segregation\" in current discussion connotes legal\r\n     compulsion, whereas \"racial solidarity\" implies voluntary\r\n     union of the colored group under the compulsion of internal\r\n     feeling or social influences.\r\n\r\n     11. Segregation, either voluntary or forced, is purely an\r\n     objective situation, a setting apart in a definite location\r\n     from one's fellows. Racial solidarity is subjective and is\r\n     the feeling of cohesion between persons of the same race.\r\n     Segregation is undoubtedly a factor in intensifying this\r\n     feeling of the consciousness of kind.\r\n\r\n     12. The distinction between segregation and \"racial solidarity\"\r\n     is in a point of view, viz.: racial solidarity concerns the\r\n     interior of the Negro, his psychosis, as to its inclusion of\r\n     a cohesive spirit; segregation concerns the exterior of the\r\n     Negro, is looking at the situation from the viewpoint of the\r\n     whites and relates to the barriers opposed by the whites to\r\n     his unlimited expansion. Voluntary segregation may seem to\r\n     point to the mind and viewpoint of the Negro rather than the\r\n     whites, but voluntary segregation does not become a practical\r\n     problem until the whites attempt to use it as a precedent, in\r\n     which case it becomes after all a matter of the viewpoint of\r\n     the whites.\r\n\r\n     13. It would appear that there is a very fundamental difference\r\n     between segregation and racial solidarity as the terms are\r\n     now used in the United States relative to the Negro. By racial\r\n     solidarity it is generally understood that there is some sort of\r\n     a physical separation which has been decreed by a law, as for\r\n     example: the various residential segregation laws enacted some\r\n     years ago and the segregation laws relative to the separation\r\n     of races in public conveyances, etc. Racial solidarity, it may\r\n     be said, is largely volitional, whereas segregation, as the\r\n     term now is generally used, has back of it an enacted law or\r\n     the idea of having an enacted law.\r\n\r\n     A still more fundamental distinction is that racial solidarity\r\n     does not turn upon the receiving of benefits from privileges\r\n     or things that are for all the public; segregation, on the\r\n     other hand, has to do almost exclusively with the restriction\r\n     of privileges relating to the free use of things that are\r\n     for all the public, as for example, the free use of public\r\n     conveyances, public places, the establishing of residences, etc.\r\n\r\n     14. Segregation aims to herd Negroes together in order that they\r\n     may be cheated of the rights of citizenship the more easily.\r\n     Racial solidarity urges Negroes to get together in order that\r\n     they may fight segregation the more effectively. \"National\r\n     solidarity\" is, to our thinking, a far better weapon. Negroes\r\n     should endeavor to find out those whites who are their friends\r\n     and ask them to join in the fight for the enforcement of the\r\n     Constitution.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: A large number of Negroes are in agreement on\r\n     the matter of separate colored churches with colored pastors,\r\n     and, more recently, colored bishops. Yet this is an argument\r\n     used by many exponents of the segregation idea, both whole\r\n     and partial, for other separate institutions. Candidly, what\r\n     is your opinion on the subject?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Separate churches, etc., are but a part of the system of\r\n     segregation inherent in the social fabric of America. This\r\n     question is therefore not fundamental or basic enough. As\r\n     a matter of logic and sociological analysis, since I do not\r\n     favor legal or customary segregation, I cannot favor separate\r\n     churches, which are but a reflex of enforced segregation.\r\n     Therefore I do not favor other separate institutions. Yet, I\r\n     at all times favor free assemblage and organization whatever\r\n     the social system is or may be. If separate institutions are\r\n     \"desired\" by the group and this \"want\" is not cramped by such\r\n     considerations as factors like American public opinion, then\r\n     separate institutions are in order. The test is the free and\r\n     unimpaired development of the group.\r\n\r\n     2. The \"colored\" church is itself an anomaly. The very idea\r\n     is logically ridiculous. From the practical standpoint it is\r\n     the result of the un-Christian attitude of churches which\r\n     preceded it and largely brought it into being. If I had to\r\n     join a church now, I hope I should decide according to the\r\n     doctrines and tenets rather than according to the race of the\r\n     pastor and communicants. If any consideration should guide me\r\n     rather than the doctrines, it would be to go where I could do\r\n     the most good.\r\n\r\n     3. The idea of using the fact of the Negro's preference for\r\n     his own church, governed by its own ministry, as a reason for\r\n     segregation not only is absurd but is a weak reason for the\r\n     manifestation of race prejudice. That Negroes prefer to be\r\n     together in religious worship is a well-established fact; that\r\n     they wish their church to be governed by their own ministers\r\n     and bishops is equally well established; that such desire is\r\n     natural and human, one must admit; but that this perfectly\r\n     normal desire should become a reason for forcing upon the Negro\r\n     other separate institutions is not justifiable. There is a fine\r\n     distinction between the performance of one's religious rites and\r\n     the activities necessary to maintain and foster these (which\r\n     becomes social in character), and the business arrangements\r\n     of getting an education, being conveyed somewhere, buying a\r\n     meal, or paying to hear a world-famed artist. The former is\r\n     part of one's private life and as such is a matter of choice\r\n     and should be confined to those who are closest to him by race\r\n     and spiritual conception. The latter are affairs of business\r\n     wherein one wishes something and pays for it; and as long as\r\n     he has the necessary greenback, expects to be accorded the\r\n     rights and courtesies given any citizen of the city or state.\r\n     The French, the Italian, nearly every nationality, have their\r\n     own churches, their own ministers, and worship in their own\r\n     tongue. But no one ever hears anything about segregating the\r\n     Frenchman or the Italian for that reason.\r\n\r\n     4. The latter plan, racial solidarity, is not at all\r\n     inconsistent with the spirit of democracy even when it means\r\n     the development of separate colored churches or the appointment\r\n     of colored bishops for colored churches in the denominations\r\n     where the color line is not so sharply drawn.\r\n\r\n     5. In my opinion, the Negroes as a whole are not in harmony and\r\n     agreement on colored churches as such. It is a condition that\r\n     has been pushed upon them; a means to the end. If Negroes were\r\n     treated just as any other member of a white church, and given\r\n     the same opportunity to advance to positions of honor within\r\n     the church, ministers, priests, bishops, etc., regardless of\r\n     color, there would be no Negro churches.\r\n\r\n     6. It is this universal spirit which causes Negroes to desire\r\n     Negro churches and Negro bishops, because the dominant minds\r\n     can more easily secure advantages when in an environment in\r\n     which they conform to the majority pattern and are not parts\r\n     of a clearly differentiated minority.\r\n\r\n     7. Separate colored churches in some degree are necessary\r\n     in order to build up racial solidarity as described above.\r\n     In other words, a strong defensive many times makes for an\r\n     effective offensive.\r\n\r\n     8. Separate colored churches have never seemed to me to be\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\n     9. I am convinced that a limited race separation is not\r\n     only desirable but unavoidable. There is a wide stretch of\r\n     possibilities between absolute segregation and unlimited\r\n     social communication. To argue that because Negroes have and\r\n     want ministers and teachers of their own color, therefore they\r\n     should want absolute segregation, strikes me as a bit absurd.\r\n     There are at least two justifications: it may be thought\r\n     that the Negro ministers and teachers understand our racial\r\n     aspirations better and can better impart instructions leading\r\n     to a realization of them.\r\n\r\n     10. Wherever Negroes find themselves segregated in schools\r\n     and churches by choice or control, they should have teachers,\r\n     preachers and overseers of their own race. Long distance\r\n     leadership is neither desirable nor effective. This leadership\r\n     will acquire requisite efficiency by survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\n     11. The motivation of any separate institutions should be the\r\n     basis of its approval or disapproval. If Negroes of their own\r\n     volition develop Negro churches, banks, clubs, stores or other\r\n     organizations as a means of developing enterprise or initiative,\r\n     or for providing better opportunities of work for young men\r\n     and women of our race, I am in accord with such separation.\r\n     If, however, such separation is forced on them especially\r\n     in public places, such as hotels, restaurants, theaters and\r\n     railroads, a separation which sets the Negro apart from the\r\n     general public, I believe it should be condemned and fought\r\n     against.\r\n\r\n     12. It is argued that if many of our leading Negroes agree\r\n     upon the expediency of complete racial separation in church\r\n     life, they are inconsistent in not applying it to all matters\r\n     concerning the Negro. The answer to this is as follows: The\r\n     highest end of the Negro is the same as that of the man of any\r\n     other race, viz.: complete self-expression and development\r\n     of his individuality; in deciding upon what he shall accept\r\n     or reject in any case this must be his guiding principle;\r\n     between being a nonentity in the \"white\" church and partially\r\n     expressing himself in a Negro church, he naturally chooses\r\n     the latter, choosing it not as the _summun bonum_, but solely\r\n     as the lesser of two evils; between having the Negro officers\r\n     in the world war and having Negro officers who are trained\r\n     in a separate camp, he considers the latter less injurious.\r\n     But give the Negro a choice between a separate church where\r\n     only partial self-expression can be possible, and a \"white\"\r\n     church which would give him full opportunity for individual\r\n     expression, and he would not hesitate a moment in choosing\r\n     such a \"white\" church.\r\n\r\n     13. Separate colored churches, colored pastors and colored\r\n     bishops represent more or less a voluntary action of colored\r\n     people and are indicative of racial solidarity in just the\r\n     same way as Jewish churches having Jewish rabbis represent\r\n     Jewish solidarity.\r\n\r\n     14. As a slave the Negro was welcome to worship at the\r\n     white church. As a citizen he is not. The white church is a\r\n     semi-public institution, being more social than religious in\r\n     its tone. Since Negroes are not wanted, their only recourse\r\n     is to have their own churches. And if their own churches,\r\n     why a white pastor or bishop, when Negro preachers quite as\r\n     competent can be found?\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINION-MAKING\r\n\r\n     _Question_: On what instruments ordinarily responsible for the\r\n     making of public opinion do you rely for your opinions? With\r\n     what reservations do you accept what you read in the white\r\n     press? To what degree are you influenced by the opinions of\r\n     colored persons?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. Of course I read daily papers, magazines and books and attend\r\n     lectures and seek every possible means to learn the trend\r\n     of thought and philosophy of life as it develops throughout\r\n     civilization. However, whenever the Negro question is treated,\r\n     I always approach with suspicion the arguments presented by\r\n     white people. I always read expressions forecasting the approach\r\n     of democracy with the knowledge that but few white writers\r\n     and speakers think of the colored races in their utterances.\r\n     The colored newspapers are much more fair than the whites,\r\n     but even they, at times, are inclined to bias.\r\n\r\n     2. Magazines, colored and white papers, public speakers. I\r\n     accept with great reservation what I read in the white press. I\r\n     am influenced to a small degree by the opinions of the colored\r\n     papers.\r\n\r\n     3. The daily papers, the _Nation_, the _New Republic_, the\r\n     _Crisis_, the _Messenger_, the _Literary Digest_, the _Socialist\r\n     Review_, the colored papers, and other scattered organs from\r\n     here, there and everywhere. The dependence I put upon these\r\n     white papers is hard to state in words. If in a white paper I\r\n     see something favorable to the Negro on a question of fact,\r\n     I take it at face value. On questions of opinion, I draw my\r\n     own conclusions from my own study and experience, wherever\r\n     possible. Likewise in a colored paper I take at face value\r\n     on a question of fact anything favorable to the white view.\r\n     Otherwise I draw my own conclusions.\r\n\r\n     4. (_a_) Daily papers, lectures and magazines. (_b_) Always\r\n     with reservations on any subject, especially on race records.\r\n     (_c_) Not very much outside of a few good magazines.\r\n\r\n     5. Every article in white or Negro press is read with the idea\r\n     that the bias of the writer must be discounted and that the\r\n     conclusions cannot be accepted, but that one's conclusions\r\n     must be made from the aggregate of the facts gleaned from every\r\n     available source bearing upon the subject under discussion.\r\n\r\n          Leading New York newspapers: _Herald_, _Times_,\r\n          _World_, _Tribune_, _Call_.\r\n\r\n          Leading American monthlies: _World's Work_,\r\n          _American_, _Metropolitan_.\r\n\r\n          Leading American weeklies: _Nation_, _New Republic_,\r\n          _Freeman_.\r\n\r\n          Leading American quarterlies: _Yale Review_, _American\r\n          Journal of Sociology_, _Non-Partisan Review_.\r\n\r\n          Leading New York Negro weeklies: _New York Age_,\r\n          _Negro World_.\r\n\r\n          Leading Negro monthlies: _Messenger_ and _Crisis_.\r\n\r\n          I read all these papers with great reservations as\r\n          to their truth and good judgment.\r\n\r\n     6. Newspapers, magazines, legislative action, personal\r\n     contacts. The white press will always justify suspicion and the\r\n     traditional grain of salt with reference to its news concerning\r\n     Negroes. White news reporters know too few actual facts about\r\n     Negroes and are too hemmed about by traditional prejudices to\r\n     be reliable news gatherers in this field. Colored newspapers\r\n     are, in my opinion, becoming increasingly more reliable in\r\n     their expression of the thoughts and mind of Negroes, although\r\n     many times they suffer from the same disease with reference\r\n     to white people which besets white reporters.\r\n\r\n     7. History and observation. I habitually question unfavorable\r\n     comment, because the prejudice and the training of the writers\r\n     must be considered. Colored papers, unless paid to do otherwise,\r\n     are more likely to exaggerate reports favorable to the Negro.\r\n     Therefore some reservations must be made on account of the\r\n     prejudice and the lack of training of many of the writers.\r\n\r\n     8. I believe that the information I get from the instruments\r\n     ordinarily responsible for public opinion influences my opinion\r\n     but little at any particular moment. I seem to have a theory of\r\n     present-day tendencies in American institutions with reference\r\n     to the Negro, and I accept items from these instruments merely\r\n     as confirmations or negations of my opinions. Usually the\r\n     negations are so few and far between that I can look upon them\r\n     as sports or the \"exception that proves the rule.\" Perhaps\r\n     the _Crisis_ figures most prominently in forming my opinion.\r\n     At least when my opinion is formed, I am unable to account\r\n     for it by any small number of books, or other publications. I\r\n     read regularly the _New York Age_, the _Negro World_, and from\r\n     time to time many other Negro newspapers; I read the _Crisis_,\r\n     the _Messenger_, the _Century_, _Review of Reviews_, _World's\r\n     Work_, _Outlook_, _Independent_, and various scientific articles\r\n     bearing on the Negro and such reviews of an even larger number\r\n     of articles as appear in the _Psychological Bulletin_ and\r\n     similar publications from time to time.\r\n\r\n     Nearly always when I read, the white press items concerning\r\n     the Negro are looked upon as carefully selected and shaped\r\n     for propaganda. By a careful and studied system of emphasis\r\n     and omission such items can be made to prove most any point.\r\n     There are exceptions, such as the _Independent_ editorials,\r\n     etc. Colored newspapers influence my opinion little directly.\r\n     The items of real news are accepted at face value, there being\r\n     no appeal, and these are referred to a more or less stable\r\n     theory of the situation. The theory changes so gradually that\r\n     I am unable to tell what items exert the greatest influence.\r\n\r\n     9. I read the dailies and the _Crisis_, _Messenger_ and\r\n     _Amsterdam News_. I accept what all of them say with great\r\n     reservation, though I naturally give more credence to report\r\n     of Negro topics in Negro papers than in white papers.\r\n\r\n     10. I regret to say that the Christian church and the religious\r\n     press, which should be the chief reliance in shaping public\r\n     opinion in the moral direction, are all but negligible factors.\r\n     More race prejudice will be shown in Chicago in the churches\r\n     on next Sunday morning than in the schools on the following\r\n     Monday. Religion failing, the chief reliance for the present\r\n     must be upon the secular agencies such as science, politics,\r\n     trade, business and the public press and platform. The Negro\r\n     himself must shape and direct righteous public opinion. Moral\r\n     reform comes through the public, who feel the need of it. The\r\n     Negro press is greatly hampered by restrictive and controlling\r\n     influences, but on the whole it is, perhaps, the most righteous\r\n     voice in America now crying in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n     11. I rely on books, magazines and newspapers for facts on\r\n     which to base opinions. With the exception of a few weeklies,\r\n     and a few radical newspapers and magazines, I believe the white\r\n     press is hostile towards the Negro. Whatever I read concerning\r\n     him, in the daily papers especially, I take with a grain of\r\n     salt. In matters of race problems the Negro papers usually\r\n     present the facts of the case fairly. I am inclined to accept\r\n     their views about such matters. Their opinions about other\r\n     phases of life, in which race is not predominant concern, I\r\n     take also with a grain of salt or not at all.\r\n\r\n     12. Personally we rely on facts, not opinions. Hardly anything\r\n     in the white press regarding Negroes is to be believed. It\r\n     rarely, if ever, mentions good about Negroes. The white press\r\n     is the chief instrument used for fostering the exploitations of\r\n     Negroes. Most of the news is cooked and doctored to fan race\r\n     hatred. A few white editors would perhaps write more fairly\r\n     were they free. Personally very little. Nearly every Negro\r\n     newspaper that we know, though, aims sincerely to benefit\r\n     Negroes. While the judgment of the Negro editor is often at\r\n     fault, his heart is honest. It is infinitely safer for Negroes\r\n     to accept the judgment of a Negro editor than that of a white\r\n     one.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Specifically what constitutes the offensiveness\r\n     in the manner in which the subject \"Negro\" is handled in some\r\n     of the local white papers and what sensitive spots do these\r\n     methods of handling touch?\r\n\r\n     _Answers_:\r\n\r\n     1. There is a suggestion of inferiority and degradation in\r\n     the usual handling of the subject \"Negro\" by the local white\r\n     papers; they generally use the subject in connection with\r\n     something evil or unlovely; seldom discussed with credit or\r\n     praise. This affects race honor, race pride, and race love.\r\n\r\n     2. Withholding the titles Miss and Mrs. from the names of\r\n     colored women.\r\n\r\n          Crime headlines, parading Negro crime and criminals.\r\n\r\n          Printing misstatements of facts but not the denials\r\n          of them.\r\n\r\n          Continual suggestions of \"proper limitations upon\r\n          Negro activity\" along lines innocent where other\r\n          races are concerned.\r\n\r\n          A patronizing attitude toward the Negro and his\r\n          activities.\r\n\r\n     3. I detest the use of the word \"Negro\" as it is spelled with\r\n     a small _n_. I shrink from the feminine \"Negress.\" \"A colored\r\n     American\" is not distasteful to me at any time.\r\n\r\n     4. The realization that an inferior man whose face is white\r\n     can, by appealing to white racial consciousness, outstrip his\r\n     superior by the utilization of mass cohesion. My feeling is\r\n     one of thwarted ambition rather than offended sensibilities.\r\n\r\n     5. Spelling of \"Negro\" with a small _n_.\r\n\r\n          Negro caricatures--always a joke and easily handled.\r\n\r\n          The Negro as criminal is the general view.\r\n\r\n          Nothing said about the Negro on the progressive side.\r\n\r\n          Negro naturally inferior. I need only refer to the\r\n          Harding episode.\r\n\r\n     6. The assumption that all Negroes are intellectually and\r\n     morally inferior. The implication that certain crimes are\r\n     peculiar to the Negro. The application of opprobrious epithets,\r\n     so common in some papers. The statement that the race is\r\n     satisfied with the treatment it receives in public places.\r\n\r\n     7. Undue prominence and emphasis upon the social aspect of\r\n     news which is purely personal. Evident failure to obtain or\r\n     give expression to the Negro point of view.\r\n\r\n     8. The tendency in my community to connect the Negro in public\r\n     print with some offensive or boorish or irresponsibly humorous\r\n     incident is the most annoying use of the word \"Negro.\" By\r\n     careful emphasis and omissions, the word \"Negro\" comes to be\r\n     associated with irresponsible, apish, or silly conduct on the\r\n     one hand or criminality on the other.\r\n\r\n     9. Among the other things I take offense at the way the local\r\n     white papers cannot report crimes committed by Negroes without\r\n     a big headline, often on the front page, stating that \"Brutal\r\n     Negro Commits Outrage\"; I object to the use of the word\r\n     \"Negress,\" to spelling Negro with a small _n_; and particularly\r\n     I object to the sins of omission of these newspapers in\r\n     that they never attempt any news which may construct better\r\n     relations, e.g., such as could be obtained if they secured\r\n     on their reportorial staff an intelligent Negro who knew the\r\n     needs and aspirations of his people. My sensitiveness upon this\r\n     results from two things: (1) it wounds my self-respect, and\r\n     (2) I hate to see race struggle consciously and effectively\r\n     fomented by the powerful press.\r\n\r\n     10. The white race as a whole seems to disregard the just\r\n     sensibilities of the Negro race, and does not scruple to use\r\n     offensive terms and epithets which would be violently resented\r\n     by any other group of American citizens. I have no objection\r\n     to the term Negro used in a descriptive sense for the entire\r\n     racial group.\r\n\r\n     11. The word Negro is still printed in many papers with a\r\n     small _n_. A general attitude to ridicule Negroes is sometimes\r\n     evident. Recently a baby contest was held in New York in which\r\n     there were entered several Negro babes; some of them took\r\n     prizes. One paper spoke of them as \"dusky belles.\" Very often\r\n     when a colored woman is mentioned in the papers it is written\r\n     in this manner: \"Katherine Jones, a negress.\" The recent\r\n     discussion of Senator Harding's lineage showed that most of\r\n     the papers considered it a \"vile and contemptuous slander\";\r\n     the possession of Negro blood seemed to be a polluting element\r\n     which could only mean degradation.\r\n\r\n     12. The word Negro is wrong, altogether. Prejudice is the\r\n     only reason for its use. Capitalizing might help, but does it\r\n     modify the treatment?\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Crisis_, whose opinions are read by millions of\r\nNegroes, was one of the five Negroes living outside of Chicago to\r\nwhom the foregoing questions were put. He sensed in them an insidious\r\nattempt to make Negroes confess that they preferred ill treatment,\r\nriots, segregation by proscription, and Negro Ghettos. Acting upon this\r\nconviction, he warned the Negroes of the country to watch the white\r\nmembers of this Commission. The article is given as it appeared in the\r\nJanuary 1921 issue of the _Crisis_:\r\n\r\n     CHICAGO\r\n\r\n     We would advise our Chicago friends to watch narrowly the\r\n     work and forthcoming report of the Interracial Commission\r\n     appointed by the Governor of Illinois after the late riot.\r\n     The Commission consists of colored men who apparently have\r\n     a much too complacent trust in their white friends; of white\r\n     men who are too busy to know; and of enemies of the Negro race\r\n     who under the guise of impartiality and good will are pushing\r\n     insidiously but unswervingly a program of racial segregation.\r\n     They have, for instance, sent a \"questionnaire\" to prominent\r\n     colored men, consisting of fifteen questions, which with all\r\n     their surface frankness and innocence seek to betray black folk\r\n     by means of the logical dilemma of \"segregation\" and racial\r\n     \"solidarity.\" By subtle suggestion these queries say: If you\r\n     believe in colored churches, why not in colored ghettos? Does\r\n     not Negro advancement increase anti-Negro hatred? Are not\r\n     Negroes prejudiced against whites? Are not the mistakes of\r\n     Negro leaders manifest? And so on.\r\n\r\n     Indeed, if a professed enemy of black folk and their progress\r\n     had set out to start a controversy so as to divide the Negroes\r\n     and their friends in counsel and throw the whole burden of such\r\n     hasty outbreaks of race hate as the East St. Louis, Washington,\r\n     and Chicago riots upon them, he would have framed just such\r\n     a questionnaire as has been sent out by this Commission.\r\n\r\nThe _Crisis'_ view of the questions is presented in the following contrast:\r\n\r\n           THE QUESTIONNAIRE                   THE \"CRISIS\" VERSION\r\n\r\n     What, to your mind, is the             If you believe in colored\r\n     distinction, either in point of        churches, why not in colored\r\n     view or definite racial aim,           ghettos?\r\n     between segregation and \"racial\r\n     solidarity\"?\r\n\r\n     A large number of Negroes are\r\n     in agreement in the matter of\r\n     separate colored churches with\r\n     colored pastors, and, more\r\n     recently, colored bishops. Yet\r\n     this is an argument used by\r\n     many exponents of the segregation\r\n     idea, both whole and partial, for\r\n     other separate institutions.\r\n     Candidly, what is your opinion\r\n     on this subject?\r\n\r\n     Do you believe that if Negroes         Does not Negro advancement\r\n     were 100 per cent literate it          increase anti-Negro hatred?\r\n     would make any great difference\r\n     in race relations? Are general\r\n     and higher education likely to\r\n     widen the breach between Negroes\r\n     and white persons, increase\r\n     intolerance, resentment,\r\n     sensitiveness to insults, or\r\n     can a quieted process of\r\n     adjustment or complete fusion\r\n     of interests be expected?\r\n\r\n     Do you believe Negroes are             Are not Negroes prejudiced\r\n     prejudiced against white persons?      against white persons?\r\n\r\n     Do you believe there should be         Are not the mistakes of\r\n     recognized leaders of Negroes?         Negro leaders manifest?\r\n     Are there such persons whom\r\n     you regard as qualified for\r\n     leadership? Discuss their merits\r\n     and demerits.\r\n\r\n     What in your opinion, are some of\r\n     the greatest mistakes of prominent\r\n     Negroes in their policies or stand\r\n     on racial issues?\r\n\r\nAt the time of this article the Commission had made no report of its\r\nfindings whatever, and there was no possible basis for the accusation\r\nof bias. When a Negro living in Chicago explained that the questionnaire\r\nwas prepared by a Negro member of the Commission's staff, the editor of\r\nthe _Crisis_ replied that \"whoever framed the questionnaire of which I\r\nspeak in the _Crisis_ or advised its framing had a bias against Negroes.\r\nOf that I have not the slightest doubt, and what I was doing was simply\r\nto warn the public of this bias.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPUBLIC OPINION IN RACE RELATIONS--_Continued_\r\n\r\n\r\nB. INSTRUMENTS OF OPINION MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE PRESS\r\n\r\n     We cannot escape the conclusion that the press is the most\r\n     powerful institution in this country. It can make men, it can\r\n     destroy men. It can conduct crusades; it can put an end to\r\n     crusades. It can create propaganda; it can stifle propaganda.\r\n     It can subvert the Government; it can practically uphold\r\n     the Government. It is at once the most powerful agency for\r\n     good in the United States and the most dangerous institution\r\n     known under our system of Government. More than all this,\r\n     despite theoretical laws which restrain abuses of the Press,\r\n     so determined are the American people that its freedom shall\r\n     not be abridged that they have written into the Constitution\r\n     of the United States (Amend. I) the express provision that\r\n     \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ... of\r\n     the press,\" and in practice the Press is free to destroy men,\r\n     institutions and races, or to make them live, the power being\r\n     limited only by the conscience and sagacity of the men who\r\n     compose this powerful Fourth Estate.\r\n\r\n               --EDMUND BURKE\r\n\r\nSound opinions depend always upon accurate statements of facts. Upon the\r\nobjective information which the press is supposed to provide, the public\r\ndepends to guide its thinking. If the information source is polluted,\r\npollution may be expected in the opinions based upon it. When the public\r\nis deluded by distortions of fact, one-sided presentations, exaggerations,\r\nand interpretations of fact controlled by definite policies of whatever\r\nsort, a situation is created which will inevitably accomplish great\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nRace relations are at all times dependent upon the public opinion of the\r\ncommunity. Considering the great number of delicate issues involved, the\r\ncareful handling of this kind of news is a question of great concern and\r\nhas been the subject of much comment and criticism both by Negroes and\r\nwhites. These criticisms are frequent and vehement. Negroes in Chicago\r\nalmost without exception point to the Chicago press as the responsible\r\nagent for many of their present difficulties. Throughout the country it\r\nis pointed out by both whites and Negroes that the policies of newspapers\r\non racial matters have made relations more difficult, at times fostering\r\nnew antagonism and enmities and even precipitating riots by inflaming\r\nthe public against Negroes. For example, the Federal Council of the\r\nChurches of Christ in America, in its report on the church and social\r\nwork, makes this comment: \"We observe also with regret and deep concern\r\n... the continuing incitement to riot by certain public officials and\r\nperiodicals, especially the partisan press with its misrepresentation\r\nand inflaming spirit.\"\r\n\r\nSaid the _Survey_ magazine, May 15, 1920: \"The custom of newspapers to\r\nridicule the efforts of colored people is a gratuitous insult that they\r\nhave to meet on every hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe _New Republic_ observes editorially: \"Race riots within a week of\r\none another occurred in Washington and Chicago.... The press made a race\r\nquestion of individual crime, and the mob, led by marines and soldiers,\r\ntook up the issue which the press had presented to them.\"\r\n\r\nNegroes are loud in their condemnation of the press throughout the\r\ncountry. Says one Negro newspaper:\r\n\r\n     Whatever be the cause of the motive, there is apparently a\r\n     well-organized plan to discredit the race in America and to\r\n     bring estrangement between fellow-Americans. A short-sighted\r\n     ... press is contributing to this estrangement by playing upon\r\n     the passions of the undiscriminating, and thoughtlessly, by\r\n     its glaring and sensational headlines, emphasizing rumors of\r\n     alleged crimes by Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Negro Press accuses the Associated Press of fostering\r\nill feeling and hatred between whites and Negroes. It says:\r\n\r\n     The Associated Press (white) ... always in its first paragraph\r\n     ... attributes the source of trouble to our people \"molesting\r\n     white women.\" That, the Associated Press knows, is always fuel\r\n     for the fire of the fury.... It arouses certain elements of\r\n     whites to indignation by the thoughts of the ever \"burly black\r\n     brutes,\" and it stirs the people of our group to a state of\r\n     fighting, mad by the folly of it.\r\n\r\nThe _Philadelphia Tribune_, a Negro paper, said: \"Daily papers keep up\r\nmob sentiment. They continue to fan the riot flames into a destructive\r\nblaze.\"\r\n\r\nThe method of news handling now in practice in the Chicago Press, white\r\nand Negro, appears to contribute in effect to strained relations between\r\nthe races. This condition prompts a more than casual inquiry into these\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nA few examples will illustrate. On the night of July 20, 1920, following\r\nthe demonstration of a group of Negro fanatics, the self-styled\r\n\"Abyssinians,\" a prominent newspaper printed in large headlines: \"Race\r\nRiot--Two Whites Slain.\" The paper was an extra and widely distributed.\r\nAt Sixty-third and Halsted streets four Negro ministers returning from\r\na church conference in Gary, Indiana, were set upon by a mob of whites\r\nwho had merely read the report, and were beaten unmercifully.\r\n\r\nOn January 23, 1920, the following article appeared in the _Chicago\r\nHerald-Examiner_:\r\n\r\n                        STUDENTS DEFY NEGRO TEACHER\r\n\r\n     Pupils' Strike Starts at Altgeld School over Substitute;\r\n     Parents Support Them\r\n\r\n     A revolt which threatened to require settlement by the Board\r\n     of Education developed yesterday in the eighth grade of the\r\n     Altgeld School, Seventy-first and Loomis streets. Two of the\r\n     pupils have been suspended, others threaten a general walkout.\r\n     Pickets are to be established about the school today, several\r\n     students promised tonight to urge a general strike. The regular\r\n     teacher was ill with influenza yesterday.\r\n\r\n                         PUT NEGRO GIRL IN CHARGE\r\n\r\n     The only available substitute was a Negro girl, Effie Stewart,\r\n     normal graduate and accredited eighth-grade instructor. She\r\n     was taken to the schoolroom by Principal J. W. Brooks and\r\n     given charge. As the principal left pandemonium broke loose.\r\n     Disregarding the efforts of the teacher to restore calm,\r\n     several of the boys arose and harangued the class to ignore\r\n     the substitute. Half a dozen of the pupils left the room.\r\n\r\n                            REFUSE TO OBEY HER\r\n\r\n     The teacher directed one of the pupils, Paul Brissono, to\r\n     summon Principal Brooks to the room. Paul flatly refused. He\r\n     walked out and reported the trouble to his parents at 1406 West\r\n     Seventy-third Street. Genevieve Lindy, 6744 Laflin Street,\r\n     next was told to go to the Principal's office for help. She\r\n     declined and went home. Principal Brooks ordered both pupils\r\n     suspended. He said the facts would be placed before the district\r\n     superintendent, John A. Long. In the meantime many of the\r\n     parents of eighth-grade pupils took a stand supporting their\r\n     children.\r\n\r\nThe Commission sent investigators to check up the facts as a thorough\r\ntest of a report which most whites believed and most Negroes did not\r\nbelieve. The Negro teacher in question, the school principal, the\r\nsuperintendent of schools, and some of the parents of white children\r\nin the school were interviewed. The following is the result of the\r\nCommission's investigation:\r\n\r\n     _a_) Every item noted by the press in this case was contradicted\r\n     by the principal and teachers.\r\n\r\n     _b_) Principal Brooks stated that \"the only part of the story\r\n     that the newspapers gave straight was the color of the young\r\n     lady teacher.\"\r\n\r\n     _c_) Superintendent of Schools Mortensen stated that there\r\n     was no basis whatever for the story, and that no more trouble\r\n     happened than often happened when mischievous boys took\r\n     advantage of the absence of the regular teacher.\r\n\r\n     _d_) Miss Stewart, the colored substitute teacher involved,\r\n     stated that she was assigned to the Altgeld School on Monday, to\r\n     the Pullman School Tuesday, and back to the Altgeld Wednesday.\r\n     On Monday she had charge of the eighth grade. About twenty-five\r\n     minutes before recess five or six boys came to her stating that\r\n     they had been appointed as monitors for that day and asked to\r\n     be excused. This request was granted by Miss Stewart. Shortly\r\n     afterward Miss Deneen, a white teacher, brought the boys back\r\n     into the room, stating that they had been disorderly; she\r\n     deprived them of their monitorship. One boy, Paul, mentioned\r\n     in the article, resented this and was impudent to Miss Deneen.\r\n     He was suspended by Miss Deneen to take effect the next day\r\n     and to return only on condition that he made apologies for\r\n     his conduct. He was present in the room on the same afternoon.\r\n\r\n     Miss Stewart first knew about the supposed strike when she read\r\n     it in the morning paper. She stated that she had no trouble\r\n     with any of the students during the entire day, and there was\r\n     no occasion to call in the principal, Mr. Brooks. Miss Deneen\r\n     also had some trouble with a girl in the same room. Miss Stewart\r\n     had no trouble either with Paul or the girl mentioned in the\r\n     case. Mr. Brooks at no time during that day was called into\r\n     the room.\r\n\r\n     _e_) The parents of the children were incensed over the false\r\n     publicity given them.\r\n\r\n     _f_) The suggestive effect of this report was immediate. At\r\n     the Coleman School, according to the principal, the children\r\n     were greatly excited over the account and looked upon it as\r\n     a precedent which had not occurred to them. She thought that\r\n     such publicity, even if true, could have no good effect upon\r\n     the minds and conduct of the children.\r\n\r\nThe prominence given to the idea of \"striking\" also had its effect.\r\nDiscussions of strikes for other causes followed in the Pullman School.\r\nLater, in February the students of the Crane Technical School threatened\r\na strike because of the removal of a teacher from the junior staff to\r\nthe high-school staff.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1918, a Negro organization expressed the views of Negroes\r\non the _Chicago Tribune's_ handling of a news article entitled: \"Negro\r\nBenefit Carries Mammy to Pearly Gates.\" The occasion of the article was\r\na musical recital given by Negro artists at the Auditorium and patronized\r\nby many cultured whites and Negroes. It was a benefit performance in aid\r\nof the families of Negro soldiers. The letter of protest to the editor\r\nof the _Tribune_ read:\r\n\r\n     On Saturday, June 15, there appeared in your paper what\r\n     purported to be an account of a meeting and concert at the\r\n     Auditorium held for the benefit of Negro soldiers' families.\r\n     Despite the fact that it was distinctly a patriotic affair,\r\n     presenting on its program colored artists of unquestioned\r\n     talent, and rendered in such a manner as to evoke the warmest\r\n     praise from an appreciative and music loving audience, your\r\n     reporter saw fit to tell of it by reciting what he knew or\r\n     thought he knew about Negro \"mammies.\"\r\n\r\n     The body of the article contains sixty-two lines. Thirteen\r\n     of these are devoted to mention of the names of the colored\r\n     artists, ten to a description of the crowd, which, by the\r\n     way, was inaccurate, fourteen to another list of notables in\r\n     attendance and twenty-five to an enraptured dissertation on\r\n     \"mammies.\" Not only is this reference grossly irrelevant, but\r\n     to colored people it is positively distasteful as everyone\r\n     should know by now.\r\n\r\n     The caption of the article \"Negro Benefit Carries Mammy to\r\n     Pearly Gates\" could by no stretch of fancy be taken as the\r\n     heading for an account of a musical concert.... There is no\r\n     complaint against the limited appreciations of your reporter,\r\n     neither do we protest against his fondness for the adolescent\r\n     idol of his black mammy; but as a news item the account is\r\n     ridiculously improper and out of place.\r\n\r\n     The patriotic endeavors of the colored people of this city have\r\n     more than once been discouraged by just such thoughtlessness\r\n     and incomprehension. You would do a great service to colored\r\n     people and to our government in the prosecution of the war if\r\n     in such accounts as appear you cause to be eliminated such\r\n     personal reminiscences and irritating irrelevancies as are\r\n     calculated to make patriotism difficult and racial relationship\r\n     unsettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GENERAL SURVEY OF CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS\r\n\r\nIt was assumed by the Commission that so far as the ordinary reading\r\npublic is concerned the study of the three Chicago white daily papers with\r\nthe largest circulation and the three Negro weekly papers most widely\r\nread would provide an adequate basis for a test of news handling, and\r\nfor measuring the effect on the public of accounts of racial happenings.\r\nThe papers selected are listed in Table XXX.\r\n\r\n                                 TABLE XXX\r\n\r\n   ============================+==================+=======================\r\n                               |                  |    CIRCULATION[87]\r\n          NAME OF PAPER        |    PUBLISHED     +-----------+-----------\r\n                               |                  | Week Days | Sundays\r\n   ----------------------------+------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n   White                       |                  |           |\r\n     _Chicago Tribune_         | Every morning    |  439,262  |  713,966\r\n     _Chicago Daily News_      | Every afternoon  |  404,726  |...........\r\n                               |   except Sundays |           |\r\n     _Chicago Herald-Examiner_ | Every morning    |  289,094  |  596,851\r\n   Negro                       |                  |           |\r\n     _Chicago Defender_        | Weekly           |  185,000  |...........\r\n     _Chicago Whip_            | Weekly           |   65,000  |...........\r\n     _Chicago Searchlight_     | Weekly           |   10,000  |...........\r\n   ----------------------------+------------------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nFor the two-year period 1916 and 1917 the Commission listed from\r\nthe _Chicago Tribune_, the _Chicago Daily News_, and the _Chicago\r\nHerald-Examiner_ 1,551 articles on racial matters. Of these articles 1,338\r\nwere news items, 108 were letters to the press, and 96 were editorials.\r\n\r\nTable XXXI classifies these items according to subject:\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXXI\r\n\r\n                                    Number\r\n         Subject                 of Articles\r\n     Riots and clashes                309\r\n     Crime and vice                   297\r\n     Soldiers                         199\r\n     Politics                          99\r\n     Housing                           89\r\n     Ridicule                          63\r\n     Illegitimate contacts             61\r\n     Sports                            56\r\n     Migration                         45\r\n     Personal                          39\r\n     Special columns                   33\r\n     Education                         18\r\n     Meetings                          17\r\n     Art                                8\r\n     Business                           5\r\n                                    -----\r\n     Total                          1,338\r\n\r\nThese figures do not represent all articles appearing on racial issues\r\nduring the two-year period. Many additional articles appeared in early\r\neditions and not in the editions examined.\r\n\r\nGenerally these articles indicated hastily acquired and partial\r\ninformation, giving high lights and picturing hysteria. Frequently they\r\nshowed gross exaggeration. The less sensational articles, permitting a\r\nglimpse of the stabler side of Negro life, were less than seventy-five.\r\nThe subjects receiving most frequent and extended treatment in these\r\nthree papers were: crime, housing, politics, riots, and soldiers. In\r\nanalyzing the articles themselves, under these specific headings, it\r\nappears that the appeal to the interests of the public is founded on\r\ndefinite assumptions in the public mind. It has come to be recognized by\r\nboth whites and Negroes, but more especially by the latter, that crime\r\nis most often associated with the publication of Negro news in white\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n_Crime._--The University Commission on Southern Race Problems in a\r\nrecommendation to the white college men of the South said:\r\n\r\n     Colored people feel very keenly about the way crime committed,\r\n     or alleged to have been committed, by Negroes is played up\r\n     in the newspapers. We never see the Negro's good qualities\r\n     mentioned. As a rule, when a Negro's name appears in the\r\n     newspapers he has done something to somebody, or somebody has\r\n     done something to him. It may be true that the newspaper's\r\n     attitude toward the Negro does not influence white public\r\n     opinion as much as the Negro thinks, but it is bound to affect\r\n     the point of view of those white people who do not know the\r\n     Negro.\r\n\r\nAs between North and South this press handling of racial matter seems\r\nbut a question of degree. For a public which depends upon newspapers\r\nfor its information an inordinately one-sided picture is presented. This\r\nemphasis on individual crimes specifying Negroes in each offense tends\r\nto stamp the entire Negro group as criminal. The following headings in\r\nwhite newspapers will suggest the inference of the public as to whether\r\nor not Negroes are criminally inclined:\r\n\r\n                NEGRO ROBBERS ATTACK WOMAN NEAR HER HOME\r\n     Tear Open Her Waist in Search for Money, but Fail to Find $6 Which She Had\r\n\r\n                  POLICE HUNT FOR NEGRO WHO HELD UP WOMAN\r\n     Scour Englewood District for Short Black Man Who Threatened\r\n     Girls with Revolver\r\n\r\n                      NEGRO SLAYER ESCAPES FROM JAIL\r\n\r\n                AUSTIN WOMAN ATTACKED IN OWN HOME BY NEGRO\r\n\r\n                       WOMAN SHOCKED BY NEGRO THIEF\r\n     Mrs. John W.

Brewere of Following Them\r\n\r\n               NEGRO TROOP RUNS AMUCK.

It plays upon the popular belief that Negroes are naturally criminal.\r\n\r\n2. The constant recounting of crimes of Negroes, always naming the race\r\nof the offender, effects an association of Negroes with criminality.\r\n\r\n3. It frequently involves reference to sex matters which provides a\r\npowerful stimulant to public interest.\r\n\r\n4. It provides sensational and sometimes amusing material, and at the\r\nsame time fixes the crimes upon a group with supposed criminal traits.\r\n\r\nThe beliefs handed down through tradition concerning the weak moral\r\ncharacter of Negroes and their emotional nature are thus constantly\r\nand steadily held before the public. Police officers, judges, and other\r\npublic officials are similarly affected, consciously or unconsciously,\r\nby these beliefs and by the constant mention of Negroes in relation to\r\ncrime. Arrest on suspicion, conviction on scanty evidence, and severe\r\npunishments are the results. A vicious circle is thus created.\r\n\r\nCrimes involving only Negroes as offenders and victims receive little\r\nnewspaper attention. It might be supposed that they are uninteresting\r\nbecause there is no element of race conflict. As long as crimes are\r\ncommitted within the group, and this group is regarded as an isolated\r\nappendix of the community, there is little public interest in them, and\r\nconsequently little news value. When, however, a member of the isolated\r\ngroup comes into conflict with the community group, whether in industry,\r\nhousing, or any relation, it assumes a wider significance, and the\r\ninformation appears to become news of importance in the judgment of the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nInstances of purely Negro crime, which in the community at large would\r\nhave a strong appeal to public interest, take on news value only when\r\nthe ludicrous or grotesque can be pictured. For the most part, this\r\ntype of article is written by a reporter with some reputation for wit.\r\nHe inserts the expected Negro dialect, whether with or without warrant,\r\nand proceeds to make an amusing story.\r\n\r\n_Negro soldiers._--News interest in articles on Negro soldiers appears\r\nto be founded largely on sentiment. During the war Negro soldiers,\r\nespecially from Illinois, were given unstinted praise by the public and\r\nthe newspapers. Illustrative headlines follow:\r\n\r\n                        CHICAGO SOLDIERS ARE READY\r\n     Col.

One\r\nwas the mention of the purchase of a $75,000 lot by Mme. C. J. Walker,\r\na colored woman living in New York. Two related to the efforts of white\r\nresidents to keep Negroes out of white residence districts; two were\r\ndevoted to the effort of white residents to put Negroes out of white\r\ndistricts; and one to a meeting of realty men at which, it was alleged,\r\nangry Negroes \"blasted harmony on a housing plan.\" The plan in question\r\nwas a segregated Negro district to which Negroes objected.

Hordes of illiterate and impecunious\r\nNegroes were pouring into the city, according to some reports, at the\r\nrate of forty carloads a day; they brought smallpox and low living\r\nstandards, imperiled health, and created a dangerous problem for the\r\ncity. The combined estimates from day to day in the press would give a\r\nnumber of arrivals in Chicago, equal to or even more than the migration\r\nto the entire North.

Some of these\r\nsubjects are thus indicated:\r\n\r\n                    WIFE VANISHES--HUSBAND SEEKS NEGRO\r\n\r\n              MAY PUT WOMAN ON TRIAL FOR PAYING NEGRO'S FARE\r\n     San Diego Case First Instance of Man Not Being Taken under Mann Act\r\n\r\n                LITTLE MARJORIE GAY, BUT AGED MAMMY MOURNS\r\n     Colored Woman Who Raised White Girl Says Officers Are Influencing Child\r\n\r\n                           A STRANGE, TRUE STORY\r\n     On Frank Jaubert, manager of New Orleans City Belt Railroad, who was accused\r\n     of being a Negro.

INTENSIVE STUDY OF CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS\r\n\r\nA careful study of the three selected white daily papers was made covering\r\n1918, the year preceding the riot, to note relative space, prominence,\r\nimportance, and the type of articles on racial matters. During the year\r\n534 articles appeared on racial matters distributed among the three\r\npapers as follows:\r\n\r\n          NEWS ITEMS ON RACIAL MATTERS--1918\r\n\r\n                                       No. Items\r\n     _Chicago Daily Tribune_              253\r\n     _Chicago Herald-Examiner_            157\r\n     _Chicago Daily News_                 124\r\n                                          ---\r\n         Total                            534\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXXII\r\n\r\n  CLASSIFICATION OF ARTICLES ACCORDING TO SUBJECT AND NEWSPAPER DURING 1918\r\n\r\n     Key:\r\n      A = No. of Articles\r\n      B = Amount of Space in Inches\r\n\r\n   =============================+==========+==========+==========+==========\r\n                                |          |\"HERALD-  |          |\r\n                                |\"TRIBUNE\" |EXAMINER\" | \"NEWS\"   |  TOTAL\r\n             SUBJECT            +----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----\r\n                                |  A |  B  |  A |  B  |  A |  B  |  A |  B\r\n   -----------------------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----\r\n    Crime and vice              | 70 | 231 | 58 | 181 | 21 | 122 |149 | 534\r\n    Soldiers, war work          | 33 | 136 | 21 |  88 | 28 | 196 | 82 | 420\r\n    Politics                    | 21 |  78 | 12 |  28 | 14 |  63 | 47 | 169\r\n    Riots                       | 15 |  80 |  5 |  19 |  2 |   3 | 22 | 103\r\n    Lynchings                   | 24 |  57 | 15 |  43 |  4 |  21 | 43 | 121\r\n    Editorials                  |  6 |  34 |  8 |  67 |  6 |  28 | 20 | 129\r\n    Organizations and movements | 13 |  25 |  8 |  22 |  4 |  27 | 25 |  75\r\n    Housing                     | 12 |  28 |  5 |  14 |  1 |   3 | 18 |  46\r\n    Personal and miscellaneous  | 15 |  35 |  5 |  16 |  5 |  33 | 25 |  85\r\n    Industry, labor             | 11 |  28 |  1 |   1 |  2 |  18 | 14 |  47\r\n    Athletic, sports            |  8 |  12 |  3 |   4 |  3 |   7 | 14 |  24\r\n    Letters to editor and       |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |\r\n      \"Voice of People\"         | 13 | 107 |  9 |  30 | 21 |  34 | 43 | 171\r\n    Migration                   |  2 |   4 |  0 |   0 |  9 | 126 | 11 | 130\r\n    Propaganda                  |  0 |   0 |  0 |   0 |  1 |   6 |  1 |   6\r\n    Race relations              |  0 |   0 |  1 |   1 |  1 |   8 |  2 |   9\r\n    Radicalism                  |  0 |   0 |  1 |   1 |  3 |   9 |  4 |  10\r\n    Guide post                  |  0 |   0 |  4 |  59 |  0 |   0 |  4 |  59\r\n    Intermarriage               |  0 |   0 |  1 |   7 |  0 |   0 |  1 |   7\r\n    Education                   |  3 |   8 |  0 |   0 |  0 |   0 |  3 |   8\r\n    Segregation                 |  4 |  15 |  0 |   0 |  0 |   0 |  4 |  15\r\n    Social service              |  1 |   8 |  0 |   0 |  0 |   0 |  1 |   8\r\n    Theatrical                  |  2 |   1 |  0 |   0 |  0 |   0 |  2 |   1\r\n   -----------------------------+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----\r\n\r\nMost of the published information concerning the Negro and issues\r\ninvolving him magnifies his crimes and mistakes beyond all reasonable\r\nproportions. The Chicago public is aware of the sentiment against morons\r\ncreated by the newspaper practice of calling persons who attack women\r\nor girls morons--an unscientific classification, of course, since all\r\nwho attack women are not morons. Negroes frequently say that if each\r\ncrime committed by a \"red-headed\" man were listed as a crime committed\r\nby a \"red-headed\" man, a sentiment would soon be created sufficiently\r\nhostile to provoke prejudice against all red-headed men.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 there were more than 90,000 Negroes in Chicago. Practically all of\r\nthe more serious crimes in this group, especially those involving whites\r\nand Negroes, were given publicity. This simple notation of crimes may be\r\na part of the routine of journalism. It does not, however, explain the\r\nobvious appeal to passion found in many of them or even the prominence\r\ngiven to articles of a certain type. Crimes, riots, intermarriage,\r\nlynchings, and radicalism were the subjects of articles which, in their\r\nrepetition and accumulative significance, presented a disproportionately\r\nunfavorable aspect of the Negro population.\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Tribune_ published, in 1918, 145 articles which, because of\r\ntheir emphasis on crimes, clashes, political corruption, and efforts to\r\n\"invade white neighborhoods\" definitely placed Negroes in an unfavorable\r\nlight. Of this number, twenty-three appeared on the first page of the\r\nfirst section and twenty on the first page of the second section. It\r\nalso published eighty-four articles dealing with Negro soldiers, sports,\r\nindustry, and personalities, which, aside from flippancy in treatment,\r\ndid not place Negroes in an unfavorable light. Of this number, two were\r\non the first page of the first section and three on the first page of\r\nthe second section. The relative length of articles indicates another\r\npossible effect on the public. The unfavorable 145 articles contained\r\n487 inches of printed matter, while the less colorful items contained\r\n223 inches.\r\n\r\nFront-page space amounting to eleven inches was given to favorable\r\narticles, and 158 inches to unfavorable. Of the articles concerning\r\nNegro soldiers appearing on the first page, four of the eleven inches\r\nconcerned a report that two Negro soldiers had been killed following a\r\ndispute at Camp Merritt between a white sergeant and a Negro trooper.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald-Examiner_ published ninety-seven unfavorable and thirty\r\nfavorable articles. Of this number, thirty-one unfavorable and six\r\nfavorable appeared on the front page.\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Daily News_ devoted thirty-three articles to unfavorable\r\npublicity and fifty-one to publicity of a favorable sort. Of these,\r\neighteen unfavorable and eighteen favorable appeared on the first page.\r\n\r\n_Bombing publicity._--The bombing of the homes of Negroes is an expression\r\nof lawlessness which in an orderly community should not be tolerated.\r\nThe primary function of the newspaper is to report the facts. Upon this\r\nbasis the public may then pass its judgment. In the case of a bombing\r\nit might be supposed that an orderly community would wish to know the\r\npersons involved, the damage effected, the motive, the action of the\r\npolice and the result of efforts to capture the perpetrators of the act.\r\nOrdinarily this is done in most cases of lawlessness and in bombings\r\nnot involving racial issues.\r\n\r\nOf the forty-five racial bombings which took place in Chicago between July\r\n1, 1917, and June 18, 1920, fourteen were not mentioned in any of the six\r\nlarge dailies of the city.[88] Of the remaining thirty-one, seven were\r\nreported in one paper, ten in two papers, nine in three papers, while\r\nfive appeared in four papers. Not one of the forty-five cases appeared\r\nin more than four papers. Although there might have been a total of 270\r\nnews reports of these bombings only seventy-four actually appeared. Of\r\nthe forty-five bombings the _Tribune_ and _Herald-Examiner_ each reported\r\ntwenty, the _Post_ fourteen, the _News_ eleven, the _Journal_ eight,\r\nand the _American_ one. In all cases the reports openly recognized that\r\nthese bombings were not the result of individual grievances but involved\r\norganized effort and activity on the part of groups or communities in\r\nthe practice of throwing racial bombs. It was generally referred to as\r\na \"race bomb\" or \"race war bombs.\" Typical headings were:\r\n\r\n     _Journal_, April 7, 1919:\r\n     RACE HATRED BOMB HURLS SIX FAMILIES FROM BED\r\n\r\n     _Journal_, November 19, 1918:\r\n     BOMB HOME OF AGED NEGRO.

This space was given by the\r\n_Tribune_ and the _Herald-Examiner_.\r\n\r\nJesse Binga, a Negro banker, was bombed five times. The article in the\r\n_Daily News_ was five inches long. In the _Herald-Examiner_, April 20,\r\n1919, there appeared an article, \"Curious Boy Drops Bomb as It Explodes.\"\r\nThe article covered eleven inches, of which eight inches were given to\r\nthe story of a boy who picked up a bomb in the street and dropped it as\r\na lady signaled him to drop it because it might be an explosive. At the\r\nend of this article were appended three inches containing a narrative\r\nof a racial bombing at 4722 Indiana Avenue where Wimes & Lassiter, Negro\r\nreal-estate dealers, had an office.\r\n\r\nThe fifth bombing directed against Mr. Binga is treated humorously in\r\nspite of the serious damage done to his home.\r\n\r\nThe average length of racial bombing articles was about four and one-half\r\ninches. The explanations of motive offered were stereotyped in character\r\nand involved assumptions which it is not considered necessary here to\r\nanalyze. It was explained that the person bombed was a Negro or that he\r\nhad moved into a \"distinctly white residential district,\" against which\r\nencroachment bombing had been instituted as an intimidating or expulsive\r\nmeasure. It was sometimes stated that the person was a real estate agent\r\nnegotiating with Negroes concerning property in \"restricted\" districts.\r\nThis sort of explanation was either stated in the headline or appended\r\nat the end in a brief sentence. The reports in the papers apparently\r\nundertook merely to notify the public that bombings had happened. The\r\nfollowing are examples of press treatment of race bombings:\r\n\r\n     _Herald-Examiner_, May 25, 1918:\r\n     This building was occupied by Negro families.... The white residents\r\n     objected to the Negroes.\r\n\r\n     _Post_, November 19, 1918:\r\n     BOMB SHATTERS NEGRO HOME IN \"WHITE DISTRICT\"\r\n\r\n     _Tribune_, March 19, 1919:\r\n     BINGA PROPERTY WAS WRECKED\r\n     Binga is an agent for buildings.

DEAL FOR SALE OFF\r\n     The prospective buyer was talking with ---- when there came a loud noise.\r\n     [Buyer was colored.]\r\n\r\nA typical example of newspaper reports of the bombings of Negro homes\r\nappeared in the _Herald-Examiner_ of April 4, 1920:\r\n\r\n               BOMB BLASTS IN FRONT OF NEGRO FLAT BUILDING\r\n\r\n     A black powder bomb was exploded last night in front of the\r\n     vestibule of a four-story flat building 423 E. 48th Place,\r\n     occupied by Negroes. The building is owned by Robert B. Jackson,\r\n     who lives on the second floor. He recently purchased it from\r\n     Louis Cohen. The apartment is in the neighborhood peopled\r\n     mainly by whites, and the police believe racial differences\r\n     are responsible for the bomb. The explosion did slight damages.\r\n     No one was hurt.\r\n\r\nOne of the typical shorter reports also appeared in the same paper May\r\n25, 1918:\r\n\r\n               BOMB EXPLODES BEFORE HOME OF NEGRO FAMILIES\r\n\r\n     A bomb exploded in the front of 4529 Vincennes Avenue early\r\n     this morning, wrecked the front porch of the structure and\r\n     broke windows for a block around. The building is occupied by\r\n     Negro families. White residents objected to the Negroes.\r\n\r\nSimilar language was used in all the articles.\r\n\r\nMost of the articles carried a suggestion of a race war on the South\r\nSide. Many of the reports helped to contribute to popular anticipation\r\nof future trouble. For example, in the _Post_ of January 6, 1920, page\r\n1, column 3, a bombing was reported thus: \"A bomb early today damaged\r\nthe residence at 4404 Grand Boulevard which was said to have been a\r\nNegro 'sniping-post' during the race riot last summer.\"\r\n\r\nThe home at 4404 Grand Boulevard was owned and occupied by Mrs. Byron\r\nClarke, and was not a sniping-post during the riot. It had been bombed\r\nfour times, once while officers were guarding it. All papers used the\r\nexpression, \"No one was hurt.\" Property destruction was usually dismissed\r\nwith statements like these: \"All the glass was shattered\"; \"the front\r\nporch was demolished\"; \"about $---- damage was done\"; or \"the damages\r\nwere slight.\" The _Daily News_ was exceptional in using the word \"outrage\"\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\nTwo reports gave accounts of arrests, and all others in which police\r\nactivity was mentioned merely said, \"The police are investigating.\" None\r\nof the articles gave the results of any such investigation, other than\r\nthat the police generally attributed the \"hurling of the bomb\" to the\r\noccupants of a black touring-car. The articles contained no condemnation\r\nof the bombings as lawlessness or crime except in the case of a bombing\r\nat 3401 Indiana Avenue, where a child was killed May 1, 1919. The _Chicago\r\nTribune_ spoke of this death as an incident of that bombing.\r\n\r\nOne of the two arrests above referred to was that of a janitor who was not\r\nable to explain sufficiently his presence in or about a building which\r\nhad just been bombed. He was taken into custody but was soon dismissed.\r\nThe other arrest was that of the nephew of a prominent business man\r\nliving in the neighborhood of the bombed property.\r\n\r\nDuring the time from February, 1918, to February, 1919, prior to the\r\nChicago riot, there were eleven bombings in the city. If each paper\r\nhad reported each bombing there would have been sixty-six reports.\r\nOnly seven reports actually appeared. During the six weeks immediately\r\npreceding the Chicago race riot, there were seven racial bombings. Of a\r\npossible forty-two reports, only four appeared, or two bombings in two\r\npapers. Thus violent and criminal expressions of hostility which might\r\nhave been checked by arousing the public conscience silently continued.\r\nThe resentment of Negroes increased, and the ignorance of the larger\r\nwhite public remained undisturbed. The articles were apparently written\r\nwithout much investigation. Upon the fifth bombing of Mr. Binga's home,\r\nthe _American_, _Herald-Examiner_, and _Chicago Daily News_ quoted Mr.\r\nBinga as saying, \"This is the limit; I am going.\" Mr. Binga declares\r\nthat he did not say this, that he did not even see a reporter, and that\r\nhe had not moved.\r\n\r\nDuring the nine months following the riot, publicity on bombings increased\r\nto several times the former amount. Beginning in March, 1920, the articles\r\nagain showed slackened interest. The _Tribune_ and _Herald-Examiner_,\r\nusually giving most frequent publicity to such matters, missed about\r\nevery other one. The _Post_ had no reports, the _Journal_ two, the _News_\r\nfour, and the _American_ none. Seven bombings took place from March 1\r\nto July 1.\r\n\r\nThe apparent indifference toward race bombings in the minds of editors,\r\nofficials, and the public was indicated by the relative prominence given\r\nto a race bomb which threatened life and damaged property as compared\r\nwith an \"odor bomb\" dropped in a moving-picture theater.\r\n\r\nOn the first page of the _Tribune_ of February 11, 1921, under the caption\r\n\"Crow Raid Opens Inquiry into Bombs,\" were seventeen inches of space\r\nreporting cases of \"odor bombs\" and emphasizing the determination of the\r\nstate's attorney to make investigation. At the bottom of the adjoining\r\ncolumn were four inches devoted to a dynamite race bomb which damaged\r\na three-story apartment and involved menace to life. No reference was\r\nmade to any effort by the state's attorney or the police to investigate.\r\nSimilar prominence was given to the \"odor bomb\" in the _Herald-Examiner_.\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the _Tribune_, February 14, 1921, condemning bombing\r\nmade no reference to the fifty-six race bombings of recent record, but\r\ndid refer to other bombing aimed at white citizens. The editorial reads:\r\n\r\n               THE BUSINESS OF BOMBING\r\n\r\n     Anthony D'Andrea, whose aldermanic campaign meeting Friday\r\n     night was broken up by a bomb which injured seventeen persons,\r\n     speaks with some indignation on the matter as indicating a bad\r\n     moral slump in political methods. If it had been a union labor\r\n     bomb, apparently, it would have been of no great importance.\r\n\r\n     \"I'm a union man myself,\" he explains. \"I wouldn't care if\r\n     they threw a bomb at my house. That's all in the game.\"\r\n\r\n     On the latter point D'Andrea is right. It is \"all in the game,\"\r\n     but the game is one which gets out of control of the players.\r\n     It is because bomb throwing has come to be accepted as \"all in\r\n     the game\" of union labor warfare that it is now being extended\r\n     to political warfare. The man, the gang, or the organization\r\n     which sanctions or adopts bombing as a method of obtaining\r\n     results in ordinary activities cannot expect to be able to\r\n     restrict the use of such methods to one line of business.\r\n\r\n     Originally the bomb was a political weapon, as in the hands\r\n     of the Russian nihilists. In late years it has grown popular\r\n     with labor leaders of a certain class. Such bombings as the\r\n     recent one at the Tyson apartments, ascribed by the police to\r\n     labor troubles, and the repeated odor bomb outrages at movie\r\n     theaters, are sufficient illustrations of its use by labor.\r\n     The post-office bombing in 1918 and the numerous so-called\r\n     race-bombs exploded on the South Side are illustrative of the\r\n     widening use of bombs. In such progress D'Andrea should not be\r\n     surprised that the bomb is being adopted by ward politicians.\r\n     Properly applied, a good bomb can be expected to neutralize\r\n     half a dozen or so precinct captains. Bomb throwing is becoming\r\n     a business.\r\n\r\n     Friday night's bombing is a perfectly logical development. As\r\n     a result several men may be cripples for life, if they do not\r\n     die. It is time such logical developments are stopped. Among\r\n     the scores of bomb outrages of the last few years, so far as\r\n     we recall, there has not been a single case of punishment of\r\n     the perpetrators. They are justified in believing that they are\r\n     safe. As long as they retain that belief they will continue\r\n     to extend the business of bombing. One thing will stop it.\r\n     That is drastic punishment. Any person who throws a bomb is\r\n     a potential murderer. Life in prison is none too severe a\r\n     penalty. Good detectives can trap some of these men and good\r\n     prosecution can send them to prison. It should be done and\r\n     done now.\r\n\r\n_The Abyssinian affair._--The \"Abyssinian affair\" referred to earlier\r\nin this part of the report, was treated with remarkably good judgment by\r\nthe press. It is to be believed that further clashes were avoided by the\r\neffective way in which the newspapers pointed out that the demonstration\r\nwas the work of fanatics rather than a race riot. Two days later, however,\r\nthe _Chicago Tribune_ published an article ascribing the Abyssinian\r\nmurders to \"racial reds.\" The article ran:\r\n\r\n               \"ABYSSINIAN\" MURDERS BARE RACIAL \"REDS\"\r\n\r\n               Leaders Lay Unrest to Du Bois Creed\r\n\r\n     Shocked by the fantastic violence of Sunday night, when a United\r\n     States sailor and a citizen were killed by pseudo-Abyssinian\r\n     zealots, thoughtful colored leaders began a determined effort\r\n     yesterday to stamp out anti-white exploitation and to bring\r\n     about better understanding....\r\n\r\n     This type of exploitation, they say, is aimed at the more\r\n     ignorant among the colored masses. It carries the same appeal\r\n     as the glittering promises of the I.W.W. and the Communists\r\n     to the illiterate and ignorant among the whites.\r\n\r\n     According to Negro leaders, this exploitation is based upon the\r\n     theory of _social equality_. Its motive can be seen, they say,\r\n     in recent utterances and writings of Negro intellectuals, in\r\n     which a high pitch of \"social equality\" fervor is established\r\n     as a panacea for the ills of the race. This theory, translated\r\n     and exaggerated into ambiguous prophecies by the soap-box\r\n     orator, is slowly being percolated through the masses of a\r\n     race as yet generally unprepared by education to understand it.\r\n\r\n     Chief among the writers whose works have been of this\r\n     intellectual caliber is Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.... His latest\r\n     volume, a \"best seller\" entitled _Darkwater_, has been widely\r\n     circulated. It is a volume of almost super-intellectual caliber,\r\n     and is bitter in tone.\r\n\r\n     In _Darkwater_, which is taken simply as a typical volume,\r\n     are found the teachings, colored leaders say, which have been\r\n     seized upon by those who, under the shadow of Dr. Du Bois'\r\n     reputation among colored folk, would seek to incite and exploit.\r\n\r\nThe \"colored leaders\" quoted were F. L. Barnett, R. S. Abbott, and A. H.\r\nRoberts. They did not impute any such danger to Mr. Du Bois' books. Mr.\r\nBarnett, for example, mentioned the exploitation of the \"Back to Africa\"\r\nmovement by Jonas and Redding, while Mr. Abbott and Mr. Roberts spoke\r\nof the lack of sympathy among Negroes for criminal types like Jonas and\r\nRedding. The article then stated the \"Du Bois Creed,\" saying:\r\n\r\n     The agitators have used considerable skill in exploiting the\r\n     Negroes by use of doctrines which they have taken from Dr. Du\r\n     Bois, as expressed in _Darkwater_. Here are some of them:\r\n\r\n     \"The world market most widely and desperately sought today\r\n     is the market where labor is cheapest and most helpless and\r\n     profit is most abundant. This labor is kept cheap and helpless\r\n     because the white world despises 'darkies.'\"\r\n\r\n     This is given as the underlying premise for the late war.\r\n\r\n     \"But what of the darker world that watches?\" the author\r\n     continues. \"Most men belong to this world. With Negro and\r\n     Negroid, East Indian, Chinese, and Japanese they form two-thirds\r\n     of the population of the world. A belief in humanity is a\r\n     belief in colored men. If the uplift in mankind must be done\r\n     by men, then the destinies of the world will rest ultimately\r\n     in the hands of darker nations.\"\r\n\r\nThe article quoted from _Darkwater_ a chapter, which, by cutting the text,\r\nleft a suggestion of sex intimacy between a colored bank messenger and\r\na white girl very different from the intention of the author. The entire\r\narticle was calculated, through its suggestion and insinuation, to rouse\r\nracial antagonism. It is doubtful whether the \"Abyssinian\" leaders, who\r\nwere ignorant fanatics little known within the Negro group, had read\r\nDu Bois' books. With all its wildness and fatuousness the movement was\r\ndirected away from America and from whites. A photograph of Du Bois was\r\npublished with the caption:\r\n\r\n                           KARL MARX OF NEGROES\r\n     Noted Colored Philosopher Whose Works Are Used by Agitators to\r\n     Stir Race Hatred\r\n\r\n_Miscegenation._--Similarly dangerous treatment is apparent in an article\r\nwhich appeared in the _Tribune_ of November 6, 1920, under the heading:\r\n\"Miscegenation is O.K.'d in New Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe article called attention to a proposed provision in the new state\r\nconstitution of Illinois against public discrimination on account of\r\ncolor, which was intended to put into the constitution rights already\r\nguaranteed by state laws. According to the article this law was\r\ntentatively agreed upon \"during the newsy days surrounding the Republican\r\nNational Convention and escaped the notice of the public generally.\"\r\nThe article said:\r\n\r\n     Under the basic law, if adopted, a colored man and woman\r\n     will be entitled to buy vacant seats of a grand opera box,\r\n     otherwise occupied by whites. A Mongolian--if a citizen--and\r\n     a mesochromic bride cannot be denied a vacant flat in the most\r\n     \"exclusive\" apartment building.\r\n\r\n     A law prohibiting the Japanese, as in California, from owning\r\n     land, will be illegal. Two colored people may take two of the\r\n     four seats in the Blackstone restaurant beside the wives of\r\n     two packers.\r\n\r\n     A member of the convention said yesterday that it is as broad\r\n     and comprehensive as it can be made. He claimed that this\r\n     sentence in the constitution will prevent the Legislature\r\n     from prohibiting in any way the colored citizen from getting\r\n     all the rights and privileges accorded to other citizens.\r\n     According to this constitutional delegate and lawyer the new\r\n     constitution, as now worded, will prevent segregation of the\r\n     Negroes, Jim-Crow cars, or special schools for the colored.\r\n\r\n     A Negro lawyer said that the Morris section only recognizes\r\n     openly the rights of equality which were settled by the Civil\r\n     War and enunciated in an amendment to the federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the article dealt in brief with fifteen other decisions\r\nof the Convention. These decisions were merely stated and not commented\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n_Newspaper handling of the \"back of the Yards\" fire._--At the close of\r\nthe Chicago riot fire was set to a large number of houses back of the\r\nStock Yards. Since these were the homes of white persons, principally\r\nLithuanians, it was generally assumed that it was an act of retaliation\r\nby Negroes. Articles in the newspapers strengthened the belief. The\r\n_Chicago Daily News_ article gave a full account of statements made by\r\nFire Marshal O'Connor to the effect that Negroes were responsible. It\r\nstated that the police and militia were combing the South Side for a\r\nband of eight Negroes, alleged automobile fire bugs. These men, it was\r\nsaid, were stalled in an automobile at West Fifty-fifth and South Wood\r\nstreets ten blocks south of the fire; when the police reached Fifty-fifth\r\nStreet the Negroes had repaired their car and fled. John R. McCabe, Fire\r\nDepartment attorney, was reported as being positive that the fire was\r\nstarted by Negroes.\r\n\r\nInvestigation was made by the Commission to ascertain the facts concerning\r\nNegro responsibility for these incendiary fires. The state's attorney\r\ndeclared that no records had come to his office implicating Negroes, and\r\nthat he had no information, except rumors which he seriously questioned.\r\nThe records, he thought, were held at the Stock Yards police court.\r\nInquiry at this police station disclosed the fact that no Negroes had\r\nbeen apprehended on this charge, and the belief was expressed that the\r\nact was committed by white men with blackened faces. The fire marshal's\r\noffice had no record other than unsubstantiated rumors spread by persons\r\nliving in the district. The matter had been dropped for lack of evidence.\r\n\r\n_Negro revolt._--On January 4, 1920, during the general crusade against\r\n\"reds\" the _Herald-Examiner_ published a two-inch headline across the\r\ntop of the first page saying:\r\n\r\n                          REDS PLOT NEGRO REVOLT\r\n     I.W.W. Bomb Plant Found on South Side\r\n\r\nThe article mentioned below alleged secret activities of Negroes and\r\ntheir plans to revolt against the government. The bomb plant and many of\r\ntheir secret plans were reported to have been discovered by the state's\r\nattorney's office. The article further stated: \"In Chicago it was learned\r\nthat the headquarters for Negro revolutionary propaganda are centered\r\nin these four organizations: The Free Thought Society, Universal Negro\r\nImprovement Association, Negro Protective League, and Soldiers and\r\nSailors Club.\"\r\n\r\nEach organization named was, as a matter of fact, open to the public,\r\nthough patronized almost entirely by Negroes. The Negro Improvement\r\nAssociation was by no means secret in its plans; it published a newspaper\r\nin which they were set forth. The slogan of this organization was then\r\nand is now, \"Back to Africa,\" and not \"Down with the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe Free Thought Society mentioned is the Chicago Free Thought Educational\r\nSociety. The following is a declaration of its principles:\r\n\r\n     In order to achieve a better understanding of the phenomena\r\n     of nature, for ourselves and for such of our fellow-men as\r\n     shall care to become affiliated with us, we do hereby bind\r\n     ourselves by the following declaration of principles.\r\n\r\n     First: That the attainment of truth shall be the fundamental\r\n     purpose of the work of this society and all its members.\r\n\r\n     Second: That truth shall be recognized as that body of\r\n     conclusions which may be logically drawn from the facts of\r\n     nature as evidence by the five senses, or may be demonstrated\r\n     mathematically.\r\n\r\n     Third: That we abstain from all dogma, insisting upon a fair\r\n     and impartial investigation of all subjects and at all times.\r\n\r\n     Fourth: That we do recognize a universal kinship binding\r\n     together in one common band all members of the human society\r\n     regardless of race, color or sex.\r\n\r\nAmong its members are W. E. Mollison, F. D. Summers, and among its\r\nhonorary members are F. Percy Ward, lecturer for the Chicago Rationalist\r\nSociety, and Clarence S. Darrow. The Negro Protective League is an\r\nemployment office and day nursery. The full name of the organization is\r\nthe Negro Equal Rights and Protective Association.\r\n\r\nThe Soldiers and Sailors Club is a community house located on the South\r\nSide and a branch of the local War Camp Community Service. It served\r\nduring war time as a recreational and social center for returning\r\nsoldiers, and in 1920 became the South Side Branch of Community Service,\r\nIncorporated. At the time of the article it was under the general\r\nsupervision of the Chicago Community Service, of which Eugene T. Lies,\r\nformerly of the United Charities, was director.\r\n\r\n_Newspaper handling of the Waukegan riot._--Considerable excitement was\r\noccasioned by reports in all the Chicago daily papers of a race riot\r\nin Waukegan, about thirty-six miles north of Chicago. The first news\r\nreports gave the following versions:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE RIOT\r\n\r\n     _Chicago Tribune_, June 1, 1920:\r\n\r\n     A group of Negro boys in Sheridan Road stood about stoning\r\n     passing automobiles for several hours, finally shattering a\r\n     windshield on the car of Lieut. H. B. Blazier and injuring\r\n     Mrs. Blazier.\r\n\r\n     _A throng of sailors and marines were passing when Mrs. Blazier\r\n     was injured and they immediately chased the Negro boys. The\r\n     chase led to the Sherman House, a rooming place for Negroes,\r\n     and when the persons living there defended the boys and sought\r\n     to drive off the sailors, there was a prospect of serious\r\n     trouble._\r\n\r\n     _Chicago Daily News_, June 1, 1920:\r\n\r\n     According to the police a thirteen-year-old colored boy and his\r\n     little sister had been in ambush near Sheridan Road throwing\r\n     stones at passing automobiles. _One of the stones_ struck the\r\n     windshield of a car driven by a coal dealer, Chas. Bairscow,\r\n     according to Assistant Chief of Police Thomas Tyrrell, and\r\n     injured a woman occupant of the car. Another shattered the\r\n     windshield of the car of Lieut. A. F. Blasier a naval officer.\r\n     Mrs. Blasier was cut by flying glass. When he drove into\r\n     the city Lieut. Blasier told several sailors of the affair\r\n     and the news quickly spread. The town was alive with marines\r\n     and sailors on \"shore leave.\" They concentrated in the town\r\n     square and upon a signal made an attack on the Sherman House,\r\n     a hostelry occupied by Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASHES\r\n\r\n     _Chicago Tribune_, June 1, 1920:\r\n\r\n     For hours there were individual instances of attacks by both\r\n     whites and Negroes in various parts of the town.\r\n\r\n     _Chicago Daily News_, June 1, 1920:\r\n\r\n     A general man hunt ensued. One group stormed the postoffice\r\n     and tried to break open the doors, as it was thought a Negro\r\n     was hiding there. Another made an attack on the house of Ike\r\n     Franklin, colored. Ike had fled. Another group chased a Negro\r\n     across the Genesee bridge in the center of the town. It had\r\n     nearly captured him when the blue-jacket guards arrived in\r\n     trucks. Under command of Provost Marshall Lieut. A. C. Fisher\r\n     the town was quickly cleared. The police arrested the following\r\n     six marines: Thomas Levinger, Charles Thrawle, John Smith,\r\n     Burney Poston, Herman Blockhouse and Harold Denning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACE RIOTS AND THE POLICE\r\n\r\n     _Chicago Daily News_, June 1, 1920:\r\n\r\n     Acting Chief Tyrrell, after a cursory investigation, said that,\r\n     as far as he could learn, Policeman Frank Bence, on whose beat\r\n     the trouble started, was not in the vicinity at the outbreak.\r\n     He said that if this proved true the man would be dismissed.\r\n     The policeman said he was making a tour of alleys at the time\r\n     of the stone throwing and knew nothing of it.\r\n\r\nInquiry by the Commission brought out the following facts: The first\r\nnewspaper accounts of the riot indicated that Lieutenant Blazier and his\r\nwife were driving in one automobile, and that Mr. Bairscow was driving\r\nin another automobile. The story was that Mrs. Blazier was injured by\r\nglass from the windshield broken by stones, and that a woman occupant\r\nof the Bairscow car was similarly injured. Lieutenant Blazier and Mr.\r\nBairscow were driving in the same car, the windshield of which was broken,\r\ninstead of separate cars. There was no woman in the car and Lieutenant\r\nBlazier has no wife.\r\n\r\nThe story was telephoned into the _Tribune_ by a member of the staff\r\nof the _Waukegan Sun_. This was the source of the report of the woman\r\nbeing injured.\r\n\r\nThe stoning occurred one block away from the Sherman House, occupied by\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\n_Negro housing in Chicago._--The housing situation has frequently\r\noccasioned alarm on the part of whites and bitterness of feeling toward\r\nNegroes. Many newspaper articles, by their play upon racial fears, have\r\nincreased the tension between the two groups. An example of this type\r\nof article is given:\r\n\r\n               WHITE TENANTS FEAR NEGROES WILL BUY BLOCK. FIRE CHIEF'S\r\n               RESIDENCE ONE OF THOSE IN DANGER\r\n\r\n     Twenty-six houses on the old Chicago university campus in East\r\n     Thirty-fourth Street, between Cottage Grove Avenue and Rhodes\r\n     Avenue, are about to be sold to colored people, according to\r\n     the tenants....\r\n\r\n     \"I'm going to offer the houses to the present occupants at\r\n     prices ranging from $6,000 to $7,000 on easy terms,\" Mr.\r\n     O'Brien said. \"Of course if they don't accept I'm going to\r\n     do the best I can. I can't predict how things will turn out\r\n     until the tenants have given me their reply. They'll be around\r\n     tomorrow.\r\n\r\n     \"Among the residents of the block are Fire Chief Thomas\r\n     O'Connor, Dr. William E. Hall, and Dr. M. J. Moth.\r\n\r\n     \"The tenants are all worried. Colored people have learned\r\n     of this sale and for days have been walking up and down and\r\n     pointing out houses, discussing, apparently, what they intended\r\n     doing and where they planned to live. Unless every one of\r\n     the twenty-six buys his house it will not remain a white\r\n     neighborhood. And I don't believe we can get everyone to buy\"\r\n     [_Chicago Tribune_, February, 1920].\r\n\r\nInquiry by the Commission disclosed a situation similar to that underlying\r\nmany discussions of \"exclusive areas.\" The article was written by a\r\nmember of the _Tribune_ staff. It was learned at Mr. O'Brien's office\r\nthat he had come to that office inquiring about the matter. A member\r\nof the O'Brien firm stated to him that he did not think the matter had\r\nany racial significance because the firm intended to sell the houses to\r\npresent tenants, all of whom happened to be white.\r\n\r\n_Labeling fights as \"riots.\"_--Attention might be called to the suggestion\r\nin articles which treat trivial disputes and street fights as race\r\nriots. On August 4, 1920, the _Evening Post_ published an article headed:\r\n\"Negroes Held to Grand Jury after Riot in Street Car.\"\r\n\r\nThe article related a dispute over a car seat ending in a fight in which\r\none man was stabbed. The entire article is given:\r\n\r\n     Six Negroes were arraigned in the South Chicago court today,\r\n     charged with having started a \"near\" race riot in a Cottage\r\n     Grove Avenue car last night. They were: Isaac Nelson, 3256\r\n     South Park Avenue; Henry Broadnax, 3235 Calumet Avenue; Samuel\r\n     Bound, 3127 Cottage Grove Avenue; Albert McMurry, 3027 Cottage\r\n     Grove Avenue; Abe Mitchell, 3703 South La Salle Street and\r\n     Walter McConnor, 538 West 45th Street.\r\n\r\n     McConnor, who was charged with assault with a deadly weapon,\r\n     is said to have taken a seat which Herbert Douglas, 1637 East\r\n     78th Street, offered to a woman passenger.\r\n\r\n     In the scuffle which ensued, Douglas received a stab from a\r\n     knife in the hands, it is alleged, of McConnor, and was taken\r\n     to the South Chicago hospital. The Negroes were held on bonds\r\n     of $400 to $3,500, pending jury trials.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1920, the _Tribune_ gave eight inches to an article with the\r\nheadline: \"Race Riot and Labor Riot in New England.\" The item reported a\r\nfight between a Negro waiter and a Harvard student in one of the college\r\ndining-halls. To show how trivial the incident was the article said in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     The trouble began when Mayer (a colored waiter) made a slighting\r\n     remark to Wilson (a white student) and, grabbing him by the\r\n     hair struck him in the face. Wilson, in an attempt to defend\r\n     himself, grabbed a water pitcher, and as he raised it, Mayer\r\n     drew a revolver and pointed it at Wilson. Immediately the\r\n     student body was in an uproar and rallied to the defense of\r\n     Wilson.... The police are searching for Mayer.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ referred to a \"riot\" precipitated by a colored chef's\r\nremarks. The incident referred to loud talking in the kitchen of a Greek\r\nrestaurant and the chef's swearing at a cook which was overheard by\r\na woman in the dining-room. She objected, and the police were called.\r\nAnother such article appeared in the _Tribune_ under the heading: \"Women\r\nin Riot. White versus Negro in Reformatory.\" The article told of state\r\ntroops, local police, and a chaplain having been mobilized to stop a\r\n\"race riot.\" The casualties given were one policeman bitten by a girl\r\nand several state troopers kicked and scratched.\r\n\r\nAn instance of undiscriminating news handling appeared in the _Chicago\r\nTribune_ of July 24, 1917. During the race riot in East St. Louis, while\r\nthe front pages of all the papers were filled with descriptions of the\r\nhorrors, an article appeared in the fourth column of the first page,\r\nalong with the East St. Louis riot news. It occupied fourteen inches and\r\nbore the heading: \"Whites Were Firing at Blacks near Scene of Murder.\r\nFour Negroes Jailed after Slaying of Aged Man.\" Of the fourteen inches,\r\nsix were given to an account of the murder in Chicago of a saloon-keeper\r\nby a Negro in which mobs of Negroes were said to have flourished guns;\r\nfour inches were given to a totally irrelevant report that two young\r\nwhite girls were chased through Washington Park by a Negro; three inches\r\nmore to a further account of the first murder, and one inch to a report\r\nthat a Negro was shot by a policeman.\r\n\r\nOn the second page was an eleven-inch article with the large headline:\r\n\"Lawyer Warns Negroes Here to Arm Themselves.\" Underneath was a five-inch\r\nreport concerning a Negro held for trial on a girl's story of an attack.\r\nNine inches were given in another article to a warning by Chicago labor\r\nleaders that \"the influx of blacks\" to replace the strikers in the plants\r\nwas bringing a riot peril to Chicago. Under this article was an account\r\nof the freeing of a policeman for killing a Negro; and beneath this an\r\narticle from Orange, Texas, with the headline: \"Negro Shot Down Trying\r\nto Escape after Crime.\" Also on the same page nine inches were devoted\r\nto a condemnation of black politics in East St. Louis, and three inches\r\nto a minor clash in which a Negro was reported to have drawn a knife\r\nwhen attacked by six white youths. Two inches were given to the account\r\nof a clash between Negroes and whites in New York City and seventy-two\r\ninches to accounts of the East St. Louis riot.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis was on the work of the mob and the fact that Negroes were\r\nreplacing strikers in East St. Louis, and that this was responsible\r\nfor the riot. Some of the reports of Chicago incidents proved to be\r\ninaccurate. It developed that Charles A. Maronde, a saloon-keeper, who\r\nwas supposed to have been killed by Negroes, his death precipitating a\r\nclash between Negroes and white persons, actually died of heart failure.\r\nThere was no connection and no apparent reason for inserting the incident\r\nof the white girls being chased through the park by a Negro. This report\r\nwas hearsay and was joined to the article in this manner: \"About the\r\ntime the Negroes were being fired upon, two young white girls were being\r\nchased by a Negro through Washington Park.\"\r\n\r\nThe item concerning the Negro held for trial on the charge of a white that\r\nhe had attacked her, turned out to be the imaginings of a young girl,\r\nwhich involved a forty-three-year-old Negro, whose character had never\r\nbefore been questioned, and who, as the facts developed, was entirely\r\ninnocent. Linked up in this article was an account of disciplining in\r\nthe county jail; 150 prisoners had been locked in their cells and placed\r\non bread and water because they were found shooting craps in the \"bull\r\npen.\"\r\n\r\n_Flippant treatment and ridicule of Negroes._--The \"human-interest\"\r\nnewspaper story is undoubtedly one of the most effective means of gaining\r\npublic attention. But it presents a single incident from which the\r\nreader is likely to apply characteristics vividly set forth concerning\r\nan individual to the group of which the individual is a member. It\r\ntherefore leads to unfair judgments of the group when the characteristics\r\nare not representative of the group, even if they are representative of\r\nthe individuals. It may be written with genuine humor and with the best\r\nof intentions, or perhaps only with thoughtlessness of the effect. But\r\nthat does not obviate the sense of injury when the group involved feels\r\nitself misrepresented and held up to ridicule.\r\n\r\nNewspaper flippancy concerning Negroes has found a sensitive spot\r\namong members of the race. Often there are suggestions and exaggerated\r\ndescriptions that can be characterized as nothing else than ridicule.\r\nNegroes especially resent misrepresentation of Negro weddings, since no\r\naccounts are given by white newspapers of more representative weddings.\r\n\r\n                              A NEGRO WEDDING\r\n\r\n     \"Yassah, I'se tuh git hitched up.

When deeds of heroism were\r\ncabled back to the United States, Negroes at home expected serious\r\nreports of the activities of the sons, husbands, and brothers whom they\r\nhad given up to fight for their country. Exception was taken by them to\r\nnewspaper treatment of a serious feat as merely ludicrous. For example:\r\n\r\n            BLACK YANK BAGS HUN; MAJOR WEARS CAPTAIN'S MONOCLE\r\n\r\n     Paris, Sept. 7 (Delayed). During the recent American advance\r\n     out of Château Thierry, a Red Cross captain was looking about\r\n     for suitable hospital sites, when he met an American Negro\r\n     soldier marching along toward Château Thierry, following close\r\n     behind a German major. The Negro had transferred his pack from\r\n     his own back to the back of the German officer, and had also\r\n     transferred the German major's monocle to his own eye. Thus\r\n     equipped the black warrior was parading triumphantly down the\r\n     road. As he passed the Red Cross captain he called out, \"I\r\n     say, look here what dis Niggah done got\" [_Chicago Evening\r\n     Post_].\r\n\r\nThe following is a news report, with dialect, which was supposed to have\r\nbeen cabled from Paris:\r\n\r\n            NEGRO STEVEDORE COMING BACK \"BY WAY OF NEW OHLEENS\"\r\n\r\n     August 17 (Delayed). George Washington Henry Clay Smith, Negro\r\n     stevedore at one of the American base ports, expressed the\r\n     feeling of a large part of the expeditionary force about ocean\r\n     travel. \"When dis heah wah is ovah,\" he said, \"you-all will\r\n     nevah see me goin' back across dat ole ocean. Ahm not goin'\r\n     back to United States that away. Ahm goin' back by way of New\r\n     Ohleens\" [_Chicago Evening Post_, September 9, 1918].\r\n\r\n\"Crap shooting\" is ordinarily regarded as the peculiar pastime and passion\r\nof Negroes. Popular expectation is fed by newspaper stories of these\r\ngames, made even more humorous by dialect, and the frequent implications\r\nof levity in religious matters. Such stories would probably be enjoyed\r\nby Negroes if they did not have the effect of picturing this trait as\r\nan exclusively Negro form of gambling.\r\n\r\nOr again, the newspaper plays up a supposed superstition of the Negro\r\nin such an article as appeared in the _Chicago Tribune_ of January 1,\r\n1920, under the heading \"Negroes Driven to Jail in Big Black Hearse.\"\r\nPseudo-serious newspaper reference was made to Negro street sweepers as\r\nthe \"official chamber maids\" of the city in an article in the _Chicago\r\nHerald_ of March 31, 1916, headed:\r\n\r\n                        BLACK BIRDS AS WHITE WINGS\r\n\r\n     Negroes Supplant Sons of Italy as City's Official Chambermaids\r\n\r\nOr again, a Negro saves a white man from a mob and is called a \"darky\"\r\nin the report of the incident:\r\n\r\n              DARKY PASTOR SAVES WHITE AUTOIST FROM NEGRO MOB\r\n\r\n     Newport News, Va., Oct. 27.--The attempt here today of a mob\r\n     of Negroes to lynch Isadore Cohen after his automobile had\r\n     run over a Negro child was frustrated by R. H. Green, a Negro\r\n     preacher, who fought off the white man's assailants long\r\n     enough to let him escape in the car. Cohen is held without\r\n     bond [_Chicago Tribune_, October 28, 1920].\r\n\r\nA Chicago colored boy is pictured at the Salvation Army Camp at Glen\r\nEllyn. Under the picture is the title \"Rastus.\" He has been given a\r\npiece of watermelon to complete the picture.\r\n\r\n                                JOY SUPREME\r\n\r\n     \"Come here, you Rastus, and git yo' pitcher took t' show how\r\n     glad you are.\"\r\n\r\n     Rastus was glad and Rastus came hither, but he was so glad\r\n     about going to the Salvation Army Camp yesterday with several\r\n     hundred boys and girls from the poorer districts that he failed\r\n     to register the smile his mammy demanded.\r\n\r\n     The annual camp of the Salvation Army at Glen Ellyn opened in\r\n     the afternoon. In the morning the first group of children left\r\n     over the Northwestern Railroad. Practically every nationality\r\n     was represented [_Chicago Tribune_, July 3, 1920].\r\n\r\nAnother picture is given in another issue of a little Negro boy at the\r\nJuvenile Detention Home. It is headed \"Losted,\" and carries the suggestion\r\nof loose family life:\r\n\r\n        LITTLE PICKANINNY WHO WAITS FATHER AND MOTHER TO CLAIM HIM\r\n\r\n     Who's lost a little colored boy about four years old? He's\r\n     at the Juvenile Detention Home. He says his mother is \"Mis'\r\n     Brown\" and his father \"Mistuh Parsons.\"\r\n\r\n     He's got an inexpensive lavalliere for identification, a dime\r\n     with a hole in it. He keeps the dime on his neck by means of a\r\n     piece of string that runs through the hole [_Chicago Tribune_].\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NEWSPAPER POLICY REGARDING NEGRO NEWS\r\n\r\nThe policy of a newspaper in handling racial news can be better determined\r\nby studying its articles and editorials than by asking the editors.\r\nIn fact, when the editor of the _Tribune_ was asked concerning this\r\nmatter he referred the Commission to the columns of his paper. It would\r\nbe difficult to find a definite policy on the race question stated and\r\nconsistently followed out by any newspaper in all items affecting race\r\nissues. Ordinarily when misleading emphasis, misinterpretation, and\r\ndistortions of fact occur, they are due to the ignorance concerning\r\nNegroes which is fairly general among white persons, rather than to\r\nany inclination to injure a disadvantaged group of people. Reporters\r\nand editors frequently use, doubtless unwittingly, terms unnecessarily\r\nirritating to Negroes. Individual notions of relations between whites\r\nand Negroes determine the character, color, and emphasis of articles\r\nand editorials.\r\n\r\nA conference of editors of the white press was held to discuss these\r\nmatters with the Commission. The white press was represented by Edgar T.\r\nCutter, district superintendent of the Associated Press, W. A. Curley,\r\nmanaging editor of the _Chicago American_, Victor F. Lawson, editor\r\nof the _Chicago Daily News_, and Julian Mason, managing editor of the\r\n_Chicago Evening Post_. A brief questionnaire was filled out and returned\r\nby Joseph M. Patterson, editor of the _Chicago Tribune_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. EDITORIAL POLICY\r\n\r\n_Chicago American._--The _Chicago American_ had recently adopted a policy\r\nof eliminating the racial designation, \"Negro\" or \"colored,\" unless some\r\nspecial circumstance made the mention of race of particular news value.\r\nSaid Mr. Curley:\r\n\r\n     There was a meeting at which newspaper men were gathered\r\n     together with some representatives of the colored race down\r\n     in a clubhouse on Grand Boulevard, the Appomattox Club, and we\r\n     were informed then that there was a feeling among the Negroes\r\n     that the newspapers emphasized in crime stories particularly\r\n     the fact that a man was a Negro. Our publisher and I discussed\r\n     it, and we decided that there was no more reason to emphasize\r\n     that it was a Negro bandit than that it was an Irish or Jew\r\n     bandit.\r\n\r\n     Our general policy has been that we must treat the Negro with\r\n     the same consideration and tolerance as we give any other\r\n     nationality. When he had those troubles here before [the riot\r\n     of July, 1919] we had some editorials to that effect.\r\n\r\nSince the date of the meeting mentioned, the _American_ has consistently\r\nmaintained this policy. Its editorials prior to that time had shown a\r\nspirit of tolerance and fairness. During the riot especially it published\r\neditorials designed to aid in the restoration of order.[89] It published\r\nperhaps the strongest of local newspaper editorials condemning the\r\nbombing of Negro homes.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Daily News._--The _Chicago Daily News_ in its reference to\r\nNegroes used the expression \"colored.\" Although it had sometimes published\r\narticles which were not representative, it had often given space and\r\nprominence to news concerning Negroes which presented them in a more\r\nfavorable light. This was clearly manifested during the world-war.\r\nIts interest in a serious treatment of Negro affairs was shown in two\r\nspecial series of articles, the first by Junius B. Wood, the second by\r\nCarl Sandburg, both published later as booklets. These articles were\r\nwell received and gave a necessary balance to the more usual publication\r\nof stories involving Negroes only in crimes. In a special column of\r\nthe _Daily News_, \"The Human Side of Things,\" many articles have been\r\npublished relating to efforts for social welfare among Negroes.\r\n\r\nConcerning the use of the racial designation in reporting crimes, Mr.\r\nLawson explained that he considered it appropriate to mention race,\r\nas, for example, in giving an account of a lynching or the bombing of a\r\nNegro home. The racial designation, he believed, gave significance to\r\nthe article. This consideration, he believed, balanced references in\r\nother cases. He said:\r\n\r\n     The newspaper point of view is to use the national, or\r\n     professional, or racial distinction, the word giving the\r\n     distinction, wherever it interprets the news that is being\r\n     printed. There are some places where the character of the thing\r\n     that is being told naturally suggests the name Negro, or the\r\n     word Presbyterian, or Jew or Gentile or German or English, or\r\n     Irish, and the newspaper never stops to suppress that. On the\r\n     contrary it puts it in as interpreting fully the character of\r\n     the news that is being told.\r\n\r\nConcerning news items unnecessarily provoking race antagonism, as, for\r\nexample, reports of speeches by a candidate for governor of Illinois\r\non \"White Supremacy,\" he thought that most of the papers as well as his\r\nown \"played it down.\"\r\n\r\nThe statements of Mr. Lawson on other questions of policy are quoted:\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Lawson_: We regard items describing constructive work by\r\n     Negroes or items indicating their advancement as better news\r\n     than articles indicating degradation or criminality on their\r\n     part. The _Daily News_ endeavors to appeal to all readers\r\n     alike. Instructions in news handling comprehend the employment\r\n     of fairness, conservatism, and candor; special instructions\r\n     based on these principles are issued to cover special cases.\r\n     The terms \"darky,\" \"nigger,\" \"coon,\" \"shine,\" \"wench,\" and\r\n     \"negress\" are not employed by members of the staff in writing\r\n     news articles and are rarely admitted to any class of matter.\r\n     The style of the _Daily News_ for many years has been to\r\n     speak of the Negro as a colored man and the Negroes as colored\r\n     people. When \"Negro\" is used it is rarely capitalized.\r\n\r\n     _Commissioner_: Is it objectionable?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Lawson_: No, simply the style of the paper; typographic\r\n     styles of paper vary. Some papers capitalize more than others.\r\n     Some papers always spell the word \"Bible\" with a capital _B_. We\r\n     don't. It simply follows the style of the paper. Dialects are\r\n     very seldom employed in the news stories. They are not used to\r\n     ridicule any race or nationality. The _Daily News_ recognizes\r\n     the importance and delicacy of the race problems in Chicago in\r\n     its news columns as elsewhere in the paper. It aims to assist\r\n     constructive movements, eliminate sensationalism, and quiet\r\n     prejudice, while at the same time presenting truthfully such\r\n     facts as may be of interest and proper to the reading public\r\n     as a whole. I think, perhaps, I ought to emphasize that last\r\n     thought to this extent: the newspaper impulse is to print\r\n     the news, that is the controlling, dominating purpose of the\r\n     newspaper mind, to print the news. But circumstances will at\r\n     times suggest some particular expression of that impulse. Many\r\n     times, as Mr. Curley told you, we don't print the news, we\r\n     suppress it in the public interest.\r\n\r\n     _Chairman_: But that is a difficult self-control.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Lawson_: Yes, I think so. To err is human, to print the\r\n     news is the natural impulse of newspaper people, but we do\r\n     recognize--I know all newspapers recognize--a very definite\r\n     responsibility that, in so far as it lies within a reasonable\r\n     discretion and a reasonable ability to act, they must consider\r\n     always the general public interest in any grave matter. I think\r\n     Mr. ---- struck a very important interpretative status when\r\n     he said he didn't like to have the designation of the race in\r\n     any respect used as an expression of ridicule. Of course, that\r\n     goes without saying. No newspaper that is wise, let alone a\r\n     newspaper that is fair, will deliberately inflict derision on\r\n     any class of its readers. It is a foolish thing to do aside\r\n     from anything else, and anything that would seem to suggest a\r\n     deliberate intent to bring the Negro race into derision, every\r\n     man in the room would resent and properly. But I think, as I\r\n     said before, that at times a purpose of derision is imagined\r\n     when there hasn't been any. I think that is true and I don't\r\n     think that it is surprising. If I were a member of a race that\r\n     was fighting its way all the time toward a square deal and a\r\n     fair show, I presume I'd be supersensitive about some things.\r\n\r\n_Herald-Examiner._--The _Herald-Examiner's_ principal handling of\r\nthe race issue has been through the presentation of news items. The\r\nterm of designation employed is \"Negro.\" On several occasions the\r\n_Herald-Examiner_ has made commendable effort to show in its columns that\r\na friendly spirit exists between the two races. Most notable of these\r\nefforts was the picture of whites and Negroes fraternizing in an effort\r\nto restore order immediately after the \"Abyssinian affair,\" in which\r\ntwo white persons were killed and several Negroes, including a Negro\r\npoliceman, were injured. Some of its editorials on the Negro question\r\nwere headed:\r\n\r\n                              NEGRO EDUCATION\r\n     Education the Best Solvent for the Negro Problem (Based on the Report of\r\n     the Chamber of Commerce of the United States)\r\n\r\n                          DISLOYALTY AND LYNCHING\r\n     East St. Louis Massacres Have Not Been Properly Published. A Gulf\r\n     Separates Governor Lowden's Denunciation of the Riot and\r\n     the Treatment Accorded Slayers\r\n\r\n                          THE BLACK MAN STOOD PAT\r\n     On the Loyalty of Negroes\r\n\r\n                            NO \"PATRIOTIC\" MOBS\r\n     A Condemnation of Mob Violence in Illinois\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the most emphasized misrepresentations of\r\nNegroes have appeared in the _Herald-Examiner_, as, for example, the\r\nstory of the \"Negro revolt,\"[90] and various riot articles.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Tribune._--The _Chicago Tribune_ stated its policy of\r\nhandling Negro news to be one of \"fair dealing and recognition of the\r\ndifficulties.\" The managing editor stated that the _Tribune_ used dialect\r\nin cases of kindly human-interest stories, refrained from the use of\r\nterms like \"darky,\" \"coon,\" \"Negroes,\" etc., and employed the term Negro,\r\ncapitalizing the _N_. The last practice was begun at the instance of Negro\r\nleaders. During the threatened race riot the _Tribune_ sought the aid of\r\nleading Negro newspapers in Chicago. There were no definite instructions\r\nregarding the handling of Negro news matter. The difficulties in race\r\nrelations recognized by the editors of the _Tribune_ are to be found in\r\nthe following editorials:\r\n\r\n                        WHITE AND BLACK IN CHICAGO\r\n\r\n     It is possible for whites and Negroes to live in peace in\r\n     Chicago. They have done so for years, in normal conditions\r\n     and in normal times. They have managed to live without much\r\n     prejudice. There has been good feeling. The Negro has had\r\n     political equality. There has been an attempt to give him a\r\n     fair representation in public affairs and not to resent his\r\n     presence there.\r\n\r\n     We admit frankly that if political equality had meant the\r\n     election of Negro mayors, judges, and a majority of Negroes in\r\n     the city council the whites would not have tolerated it. We do\r\n     not believe that the whites of Chicago would be any different\r\n     from the whites of the South in this respect....\r\n\r\n     We have been able to extend the essentials of citizenship to\r\n     the Negroes freely because the whites are dominant in numbers.\r\n     All the essentials are in the possession of the Negro. He is\r\n     not Jim-Crowed by law. A line is drawn by usage. The law in\r\n     fact forbids what actually is done. It is a futile law because\r\n     it encounters instinct.\r\n\r\n     Legally a Negro has right to service anywhere the public\r\n     generally is served. He does not get it. Wisely he does not ask\r\n     for it. There has been an illegal, non-legal, or extra-legal\r\n     adjustment founded upon common sense which has worked in the\r\n     past, and it will work in the future.\r\n\r\n     The fact is that so long as this city is dominated by whites,\r\n     whether because of their numbers without force or by their\r\n     force if they were in the minority, there will be limitations\r\n     placed upon the black people. They will be limitations which\r\n     will not work an injustice to the black people, who have a\r\n     right to their own development.\r\n\r\n     There is no objection to economic equality. There is a decided\r\n     objection to the exploitation of black labor. During the war\r\n     many Negroes were brought from the South. Thousands of them\r\n     went into the Stock Yards. The war shut off the supply of\r\n     common labor. The South supplied the want.\r\n\r\n     Thus the population of blacks doubled in war times. Concerns\r\n     which brought the Negro here to exploit him damaged the\r\n     community by throwing a race question upon it. Concerns which\r\n     needed the Negro and put him upon an equal basis with the\r\n     whites, without importing cheap labor to take the jobs of\r\n     whites, were legitimately supplying their need for labor.\r\n\r\n     The race issue in California grew out of the fact that the\r\n     Japanese were cutting under the price of white labor. That\r\n     will produce race troubles as quickly as anything.\r\n\r\n     Concerns may have been derelict in not considering the housing\r\n     problem. The imported Negroes could not live in the streets\r\n     or vacant lots. They had to get under roofs, and in getting\r\n     under roof they suddenly established new contact with white\r\n     neighborhoods.\r\n\r\n     In this change there was bound to be trouble unless precautions\r\n     were taken. In the present case there is no evidence of\r\n     precaution and some of provocation. It is possible for that\r\n     question to adjust itself. Such realty movements cannot take\r\n     place without friction, but the friction need not lead to\r\n     riots. The city is steadily shifting in residential character.\r\n     Some of the people affected by the shifts do not like it,\r\n     but in normal times the readjustment is not disturbing to the\r\n     community. A spread of factories may change the character of\r\n     a section. A spread of Negroes may do the same thing.\r\n\r\n     A writer once summed up the Negro question by saying, \"The\r\n     North has the principles and the South has the Negroes.\" We are\r\n     coming to have the Negroes, and we want to keep the principles\r\n     so far as they are applicable.\r\n\r\n     Industrial radicalism, expressed in the I.W.W. propaganda among\r\n     the Negroes, will not help us to keep them. Thuggery will not\r\n     help us to keep them. A rebellion by the Negroes against facts\r\n     which exist and will persist will not help us to keep them, but\r\n     we are confident that the situation in Chicago is susceptible\r\n     of being handled in the fashion it always has been handled.\r\n\r\n     UNSETTLING THE RACE PROBLEM\r\n\r\n     ... Regardless of what may be considered the justice of the\r\n     claims of the races, the fact undeniably is that white and\r\n     black will not mix in quantity. For this reason--the reason\r\n     reached by the jury--the remedy seems obvious: there must be\r\n     a plane upon which the races can live socially distinct but\r\n     industrially co-operative.\r\n\r\n     We are not disposed to think that the mass of the Negroes want\r\n     social equality in the full sense of the term. The _Tribune_\r\n     has had many intelligently composed letters from Negroes\r\n     disclaiming any such desire. We believe the Negroes want an\r\n     opportunity to develop their own society. If this is true\r\n     there ought not be widespread objection to social segregation,\r\n     directed by themselves and upon the theory of wholesome living\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n     But against what we think is an inherent disregard for exact\r\n     social equality there is appearing a very insidious propaganda\r\n     among the Negroes. Whether it is being circulated as a radical\r\n     irritant calculated to disturb political conditions or merely is\r\n     the parlor philosophy of eager sociological transcendentalists,\r\n     there is no means of determining.\r\n\r\n     The propaganda urging agitation for social equality may have\r\n     every support under the law and under what ought to be human\r\n     justice, but while fortified by what ought to be, it flies in\r\n     the face of what is....\r\n\r\n     The blacks form less than 10 per cent of the population of the\r\n     United States. They have less than one-tenth of a ghost of a\r\n     show if the relations between white and black become bitterly\r\n     hostile. The average black man and the average white man get\r\n     along fairly well. Unless something happens to arouse their\r\n     race prejudices and instincts they live by tolerance which may\r\n     not be a solution of race difficulties, but it is a method of\r\n     life and it is practical.\r\n\r\n     There is plenty of evidence just now that something is raising\r\n     the race question. There is evidence, it is said, to support the\r\n     story that agents had played on the imagination and ignorance\r\n     of Negroes in Arkansas inciting them to arise against the\r\n     whites and take their lands. Agitators have tried to excite\r\n     the blacks. Some misguided sentimentalists have tried to\r\n     organize whites and blacks for the compulsory recognition of\r\n     social equality--a propaganda which is even more vicious than\r\n     the red propaganda. There are numerous elements and factors\r\n     of disorder, and the consequences already have been bad....\r\n\r\n     The position of the Negro is not a preferred one in American\r\n     society. The Negro is at an economic disadvantage. He is\r\n     needed in the South and has been brought into the North to\r\n     meet labor emergencies, but he does not have an open field\r\n     of work. These disadvantages cannot be removed by discussing\r\n     them. They exist in race instincts and, along with the other\r\n     disadvantages which the Negro meets, arise from causes not at\r\n     the control of the reasoning faculties.\r\n\r\n     No sensible person imagines that he knows what to do about the\r\n     race problem because he does not know a method of eradicating\r\n     race instincts, and he would not want to eradicate them if\r\n     he knew how. A person may know what will surely happen if the\r\n     race instincts become inflamed and not have the slightest idea\r\n     how to prevent contact from flaming into violent action.\r\n\r\n     We know that if it comes to violence the blacks will get the\r\n     worst of it. We know that the situation as it exists now has\r\n     many possibilities of danger. Both North and South have had\r\n     enough violence. Both may have more. Communities may not be\r\n     able to stop agitation or effectively to counteract it, but they\r\n     can see that the processes of law are applied with severity.\r\n\r\n     Law strong enough to make the races live in peace will allow\r\n     them to find their own ways of living in the same communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. HANDLING OF NEGRO NEWS\r\n\r\n_Chicago Evening Post._--The _Post_ is an afternoon paper. It does not\r\ncarry a large amount of news on racial matters. The policy of this paper\r\nwas thus expressed by the managing editor, Mr. Julian Mason:\r\n\r\n     We have always checked information very carefully because we\r\n     have had a very close Negro sympathy for years and because\r\n     we have had editorial writers who have had special contacts.\r\n     For instance, during the race riots we were constantly in\r\n     communication with a young Negro, Mr. Jackson, a Y.M.C.A. man,\r\n     a fine man. We checked up with him every single day. We used\r\n     to call up Mr. Barnett and some of the others.\r\n\r\n     We use the word \"Negro\" and the Negro dialect in what you call\r\n     feature stories. I don't know why we should deprive American\r\n     life of that flavor. We also use the word \"darky\" once in a\r\n     while in a humorous sense, but not in news items.\r\n\r\n_The Associated Press._--Mr. Edgar T. Cutter, district manager, Western\r\nDistrict, the Associated Press, said in his testimony before the\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\n     The Associated Press is a non-money-making, non-sectarian,\r\n     non-political organization. It is made up of over 1,260 daily\r\n     papers. It is a mutual organization, and it gets its news by\r\n     an exchange among the members. Aside from that, in big cities\r\n     like Chicago we have our own bureaus which collect news in\r\n     certain events. In Chicago the Associated Press gets its news\r\n     from the five daily papers that are members, and from the city\r\n     news bureau. This city news bureau, by the way, is kept up\r\n     by the Chicago papers and therefore is supervised by them and\r\n     carries the same class of news. Now on a big story such as the\r\n     race riots, the Associated Press got its news from all these\r\n     sources, and it also sent a staff man who was experienced in\r\n     general newspaper work to the South to investigate for himself\r\n     so we should get the absolute facts. The Associated Press\r\n     makes a practice of covering only news of general interest,\r\n     and it has made its reputation on the covering of facts. It\r\n     never handles editorials, nor does it ever make a comment on\r\n     any news. If a piece of news is not of general interest, at\r\n     least throughout the state, it doesn't attempt to handle it. It\r\n     confines itself to news that is of general interest throughout\r\n     the country, and therefore it covers these matters very briefly.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you personally in your representative capacity\r\n     handle any of the news from the southern states?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Cutter_: Only as it passes through here. Each district\r\n     passes on its own news, but we verify it if it ever appears\r\n     to be incorrect. But any item that reflects upon any person\r\n     or upon any organization, even if we get it from our own\r\n     newspapers, is first checked up to its source, if that is at\r\n     all possible, and then if there is a matter of controversy and\r\n     only one side has been stated, we always try to get a statement\r\n     from the other side, from some head official. In case of Negro\r\n     news, we have many times had as our representatives leading\r\n     Negroes. Negro organizations have come into our office and we\r\n     have solicited news from them....\r\n\r\n     In cases of lynchings and such things from the South, the\r\n     Associated Press often has used twenty-five or fifty words and\r\n     just let it pass with the mere fact. Where we have covered\r\n     crime in full, big cases, very often it has been upon the\r\n     demand of the members of the organizations.\r\n\r\n     News concerning Negroes is handled just the same as any news\r\n     of any nationality. We use the words, \"Negro\" and \"colored.\"\r\n     And it is always the desire of the Associated Press and the\r\n     attempt of the Associated Press not only not to injure any\r\n     person but to show the proper respect to all religions, races,\r\n     and all classes of society. It makes no difference whether\r\n     we would capitalize the word \"Negro\" or not. Our copy goes to\r\n     the newspaper and, as Mr. Lawson says, they follow their own\r\n     ideas in that....\r\n\r\n     In all of our services we attempt to suppress news that we\r\n     think might stir up race relations involving Japanese, Mexicans,\r\n     Negroes, or any others, and we follow the lead of newspapers.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: What is the extent to which news from these members\r\n     of the Associated Press is verified when it comes from regions\r\n     or localities where there may be prejudice?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Cutter_: Wherever there is any question of the news or\r\n     wherever there are two sides, as in the labor question, we send\r\n     a staff man out from headquarters who makes his reputation\r\n     and that of the Associated Press upon covering both sides of\r\n     the story equally. He knows very readily that if he doesn't\r\n     cover that with thorough fairness, he is going to hear from\r\n     it later from one side or the other.\r\n\r\n_Chicago American._--Mr. William H. Curley, managing editor of the\r\n_Chicago American_, gave the following information:\r\n\r\n     Of course as to accuracy, we check that up the same as we do\r\n     any item. We find out where the item came from; if it is a\r\n     police item we find out who is responsible for it and send\r\n     reporters immediately to cover it and rely upon them for\r\n     accuracy regarding the report.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Let me ask whether you do that with the same care\r\n     and precision that you do in the case of a white man that is\r\n     involved.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Curley_: Absolutely.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: That is no insinuation against the newspapers,\r\n     but, for instance, it is said that in the courts, if a man is\r\n     a colored man he doesn't have the same thoughtful care that\r\n     a man has if he is a white man.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Curley_: A good many items, of course, come from the City\r\n     Press that supplies all the newspapers. If it is a matter that\r\n     is trivial, of course a newspaper won't send a special reporter\r\n     but relies upon the City Press for accuracy. In a crime story\r\n     we eliminate the word \"Negro\" unless there is some reason for\r\n     it. We don't use any of the terms, \"darky,\" \"nigger,\" \"coon,\"\r\n     \"shine,\" \"wench,\" or \"negress.\"\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Do you get news unsolicited regarding Negroes any\r\n     more than other persons?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Curley_: We don't take any news that comes in over the\r\n     telephone without checking it.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Regarding items coming from the South, is there\r\n     any particular care or checking used to see whether they are\r\n     true stories, trustworthy or not?\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Curley_: You have to take that as it comes because that\r\n     is your news service. In other words, they are supposed to\r\n     use their care down there the same as we do here. We have to\r\n     rely on that.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Daily News._--\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Lawson_: Sources of information are the same as in the case\r\n     of other news, and in addition matter originally in Negroes' own\r\n     publications, bulletins of welfare organizations, etc. Generally\r\n     speaking, it may be said that more news on this subject comes\r\n     from outside sources such as telephone tips and correspondence\r\n     than from members of the staff. Perhaps 10 per cent comes from\r\n     the Associated Press. This is an arbitrary estimate. The same\r\n     methods are used to determine the accuracy of news concerning\r\n     the Negroes that are used under other circumstances. The _Daily\r\n     News_ does not publish any news except after determining its\r\n     accuracy to the best of its ability. No special reporter may\r\n     be said to be assigned to news of Negroes, but owing to his\r\n     special study of the conditions in Chicago, however, Carl\r\n     Sandburg is on occasion called into consultation or assigned\r\n     a topic for investigation. I may say that years ago the Negro\r\n     poet Dunbar was a reporter on the _News_.\r\n\r\n     Negro news is received from the Associated Press in the same\r\n     manner as other news. It is not often re-written, and then\r\n     only when the subject-matter is local to Chicago. Headlines\r\n     are written to conform to the text of the article. The _Daily\r\n     News_ is in touch with very reliable and well-informed Negroes\r\n     in whom, because of long experience, it has confidence. It\r\n     obtains information from them and seeks their viewpoint on\r\n     serious matters. We regard items describing constructive work\r\n     by the Negroes or items indicating their advancement as better\r\n     news than articles indicating degradation or criminality on\r\n     their part. The _Daily News_ endeavors to appeal to all readers\r\n     alike.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Tribune._--The following is taken from the replies in the\r\nquestionnaire returned by Mr. Joseph M. Patterson, editor of the _Chicago\r\nTribune_:\r\n\r\n     The sources of Negro news are the same as sources of other\r\n     news. Some comes from the staff; some from the City News\r\n     Bureau. Some of the local news concerning Negroes comes from\r\n     reporters. No news of any consequence is received by telephone\r\n     or correspondence. The Associated Press treats it on the same\r\n     basis as other news. To insure accuracy the usual methods of\r\n     inquiry are employed. However, most of this news comes from\r\n     responsible news bureaus. Articles are re-written but only\r\n     for condensation. During the threatened race riot the aid of\r\n     leading Negro newspapers was sought to check information on\r\n     serious matters. Each item is judged on its merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE NEGRO PRESS\r\n\r\nAmong the considerations which have been urged by Negroes as making\r\nnecessary the establishment of the Negro press are:\r\n\r\n1. The indifference of white newspapers to the Negro group, their emphasis\r\non the unfortunately spectacular, and the consequent loss of items of\r\ninterest among Negroes throughout the country.\r\n\r\n2. The importance of developing the morale of the Negro group, creating\r\na solidarity of interest and purpose for measures of defense, correcting\r\nthe impressions created by general opinion, and centering the attention\r\nof Negroes upon themselves and their destiny. There has never been\r\nsufficient capital for the adequate development of the Negro press. The\r\npurpose, however, has been served of collecting items of interest from\r\nall sections of the country, although they lack the facilities of so\r\nefficient an agency as the Associated Press.\r\n\r\nFor a time practically all of the northern Negro newspapers fell under\r\nthe condemnation of the United States Attorney-General's office.[91]\r\nThey were accused of radicalism and incitation to violence. Frequent\r\ncriticisms of the Negro press declare it dangerous to the interests of\r\ncordial race relations. Ex-President Taft in the _Philadelphia Ledger_\r\nsaid: \"The editors of the colored press should be reasoned with to cease\r\npublishing articles, however true, having inciting effect.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on criticisms of this kind, Isaac Fisher, editor of the _Fisk\r\nUniversity News_, said:\r\n\r\n     Since the Washington and Chicago riots, the colored newspapers\r\n     have been bitterly arraigned in some quarters for being\r\n     responsible for race hatred. But the singular part of the\r\n     indictment is that these papers are not accused of \"falsifying\"\r\n     the record, but of stating the grounds of the Negro's\r\n     resentment; and there is growing up a school of thought which\r\n     argues that the colored papers should refrain from publishing as\r\n     news any facts, even though true, which serve to increase the\r\n     bitterness of the colored people against the white people. The\r\n     comments made by those who charge the Negro press with being\r\n     the cause of race antagonism are unanimous in interpreting as\r\n     \"incendiary\" all statements of facts whose bare recital makes\r\n     the Negro discontented with present conditions.\r\n\r\n     It should also be noted that the charge of inciting to race\r\n     hatred is laid against the Negro press specifically for the\r\n     period which has followed the end of the late war; whereas the\r\n     charge of inciting white people to wrath against the Negro is\r\n     an old one which has been repeated again and again during the\r\n     past thirty years.\r\n\r\n     But, while the Negro press is not as old as the white press\r\n     and cannot possibly be charged with having \"been on the job\"\r\n     quite so long, it is true, nevertheless, that some of its\r\n     members have cast all prudence to the winds since the signing\r\n     of the armistice, and have entered a mad race with the most\r\n     \"yellow\" of yellow white journals in vitriolic race attacks,\r\n     in this case upon all white people, in the attempt to meet\r\n     the \"yellow\" white press more than half way.\r\n\r\n     Whatever the relative degree of culpability, \"yellow\" journalism\r\n     is as reprehensible when supported by a part of the Negro press\r\n     as it is when upheld by a part of the white press. The Negro\r\n     might just as well learn now the lesson which the white man\r\n     must learn if he would save the civilization which he has been\r\n     laboring so long to perfect, i.e., that one's color and race\r\n     do not excuse wrongdoing. If it is wrong for a white newspaper\r\n     to make white people hate colored people, how can it be right\r\n     for a Negro newspaper to make colored people hate white people?\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CLASSIFICATION OF ARTICLES\r\n\r\nThe news items in Negro papers show a bias in reporting the opposite of\r\nthat of many white papers. They emphasize the Negro's view, frequently\r\nto the point of distorting fact. If anything, they might be said to\r\nprovide a compensatory interpretation of the news. The three Negro\r\nnewspapers selected for study mentioned and briefly characterized in\r\nthe foregoing pages will show a classification of news items appearing\r\nduring a forty-week period.\r\n\r\nIn addition to general news items concerning Negroes, the _Defender_\r\ngave one page to sporting news, one page to theatrical news, two pages\r\nto personal news items sent in by correspondents in other cities, and\r\none page to local personal items. On its editorial page two and one-half\r\ncolumns each week were devoted to health articles by Dr. Wilberforce\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\nThe _Whip_ gave one page to sports, one to theatrical news and\r\norganization articles, one to out-of-town personal news items and one\r\nto local personal items. Its editorial page devoted one column to \"Legal\r\nHints to Women,\" one-half column to \"Health Hints,\" one column to \"Legal\r\nCatechism,\" and two columns to editorials from other papers.\r\n\r\nThe _Searchlight_ gave one page to theatrical, local personal news, and\r\nchurch notes. The editorial page contained two half-columns each week\r\nby \"The Man about Town.\"\r\n\r\n                               TABLE XXXIII\r\n\r\n

in each of the papers,\r\nespecially cases in which whites and Negroes were involved. The intention\r\nappeared to be to present the Negro's side of the story. A measurement\r\nof news interest on different types of crime articles is possible in\r\nTable XXXV with space in inches.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE XXXV\r\n\r\n                   LOCAL AND OUT-OF-TOWN CRIMES COMBINED\r\n\r\n   =============+==============+==============+==============+===============\r\n                |    CRIMES    |    CRIMES    |    CRIMES    |    CRIMES\r\n                |   INVOLVING  |  INVOLVING   |   INVOLVING  |   INVOLVING\r\n                | ONLY NEGROES |   NEGRO V.   |   WHITES V.  |  ONLY WHITES\r\n      NEGRO     |              |    WHITE     |    NEGROES   |\r\n    NEWSPAPERS  +--------+-----+--------+-----+--------+-----+--------+------\r\n                | No. of |Space| No. of |Space| No. of |Space| No. of |Space\r\n                |Articles|     |Articles|     |Articles|     |Articles|\r\n   -------------+--------+-----+--------+-----+--------+-----+--------+------\r\n   _Defender_   |   233  |1,032|    90  |  467|    55  |  260|     4  |   31\r\n   _Whip_       |    75  |  495|    70  |  440|    44  |  350|     8  |   44\r\n   _Searchlight_|    26  |  121|    37  |  440|    11  |   67|     1  |    2\r\n   -------------+--------+-----+--------+-----+--------+-----+--------+------\r\n\r\nThe method of presentation of articles revealed the strongest\r\ncharacteristic of Negro journalism. In this connection a random selection\r\nof headlines is interesting:\r\n\r\n     CRIMES INVOLVING WHITE ASSAILANTS AND NEGRO VICTIMS\r\n\r\n     \"Free White Woman Who Killed Attorney\"\r\n     \"Threatens Mother and Babes with Axe\"\r\n     \"Bowman Milk Driver Brutally Assaults Woman\"\r\n     \"Crime of Postmaster Starts Serious Trouble\"\r\n     \"Commits Suicide to Escape Mob\"\r\n     \"Baby Girl Assaulted by White Farm Hand\"\r\n     \"Maid Is Robbed by White 'Iceman'\"\r\n     \"Stepped on Man's Foot in Street Car; Shot\"\r\n     \"Wouldn't Say 'Mister'; Is Beaten to Death\"\r\n     \"Kills White Man for Girl's Honor\"\r\n     \"Convict White Man on Rape Charge\"\r\n     \"Protects Wife's Honor; Slain by Land-Owner\"\r\n     \"White Tenants Kick on Living in Same Building with Owner\"\r\n     \"White Woman Confesses Lies on Colored Men\"\r\n     \"Kills Negro Minister for Stepping on His Foot\"\r\n     \"White Confectioner Arrested for Refusing to Serve Trotter\"\r\n     \"To Pay $750 for Attack on Negro Woman\"\r\n     \"White Girl Robs Father's Bank; Elopes with Negro Taken in Rooming\r\n     House; Half of Stolen Wealth Recovered\"\r\n     \"Two Boys Shot; Crowd Blames White Man\"\r\n\r\nCRIMES INVOLVING NEGRO ASSAILANTS AND WHITE VICTIMS\r\n\r\n     \"Laundryman Stabbed in Controversy over Price\"\r\n     \"Boy Pupil Rebels at Scolding; Shoots Teacher\"\r\n     \"Slayer Captured, Tried, Hanged, in 24 Hours\"\r\n     \"Quarrel over Price of Cotton; Farmer Is Shot\"\r\n     \"Hold Three for Murder of White Infantryman\"\r\n     \"Haunted by Man's Face He Killed; Surrenders\"\r\n\r\nCRIMES INVOLVING ONLY NEGROES\r\n\r\n     \"Woman Who Took a Life to Die Herself\"\r\n     \"Mother Kills Self and Babe with Gas\"\r\n     \"Wife Slayer Must Serve 20-Year Term\"\r\n     \"Raids on Homes Net Pullman Goods\"\r\n     \"Woman Dynamites Jail to Free Her Lover\"\r\n     \"Bullet Strikes Brass Chain, Man's Life Saved\"\r\n     \"Girl to Die on Gallows; Slew Rival\"\r\n     \"Cost Girl Her Life to Stop Love Affair\"\r\n\r\nDefinite differences of news value were noted, between articles appearing\r\nin Negro papers and those in white papers on the same topics. The items,\r\nfor the most part, carried a specific appeal. Where the item was of\r\ngeneral interest and appeared in both white and Negro papers, the facts\r\nusually corresponded.\r\n\r\nThe difference again lies in emphasis and prominence.

The _Chicago Whip_ devotes two columns of the paper\r\nto a section called \"Under the Lash of the Whip,\" the \"You Know 'Em,\r\nEditor,\" and \"Nosey Knows.\" Persons who become offensive to the principles\r\nsupported by the _Whip_ are put \"Under the Lash.\" \"Nosey Knows\" and the\r\n\"You Know 'Em, Editor\" attempt to hold individual conduct of Negroes to\r\nconventional standards by the threat of semi-publicity, for example:\r\n\r\n     You know those new \"loop hounds.\" I know them because they go\r\n     to the loop for the purpose of visiting--no object of buying\r\n     anything. Well, tell them it's alright to go to the loop, but\r\n     they don't have to attract everybody's attention for blocks\r\n     around with their loud talk, using their ignorant, non-sensical\r\n     expressions. And should they get hungry while down there and\r\n     feel like having lunch, don't stand outside the door of a\r\n     restaurant with a surprised look on their faces--just tell\r\n     them to walk right in, in an orderly and sensible manner and\r\n     order what they want. They don't have to slip in like thieves.\r\n\r\n     You know the restaurants where those household insects known\r\n     as flies are very prevalent. I know you know them, because\r\n     they are all along State Street, Thirty-first and Thirty-fifth.\r\n     Well, if you don't mind, kindly tell some of those proprietors\r\n     that there is a way of ridding their places of such nuisances.\r\n\r\n     You probably don't know that lady who resides in a prominent\r\n     building in the vicinity of Thirty-first Street and Indiana\r\n     Avenue, and who tried to enveigle a young girl on the street\r\n     car to her flat by telling her that she could meet some high\r\n     class doctors and lawyers there. Well, you may not know her now,\r\n     but if you watch the columns of the _Whip_ you will know her\r\n     because she is gradually working her way to the penitentiary\r\n     by the route of the seduction law. Everybody will know her then.\r\n\r\nThe _Searchlight_ carries a column by \"The Man about Town\" which is\r\nsimilar in character. Two examples of its criticism of Negro conduct were:\r\n\r\n     The gang that hangs around the \"pillars of knowledge\" in the\r\n     county building every day at noon is becoming so obnoxious\r\n     that they are attracting the attention of everybody who enters\r\n     the building.\r\n\r\n     Politicians from every section of the city crowd there and\r\n     shoot off their \"hot air\" in a loud tone of voice. They seem\r\n     to think that the future of the country depends on what they\r\n     say or do.\r\n\r\n     They have become so bold in their actions they have begun to\r\n     stop some of our race women and engage them in conversation\r\n     around that historic spot.\r\n\r\n     Now boys, cut out that \"rough stuff\" and take a walk around\r\n     the block at noon and let the fresh air blow on your beautiful\r\n     carcass; if you don't the sheriff will ask you to do so, or\r\n     he may take some of you fellows to the North Side. Don't make\r\n     yourself a nuisance around the city hall and county building.\r\n     Hear me, boys.\r\n\r\n     Another thing that is very disgusting is the arrogance of the\r\n     girl waitresses in some of these race restaurants. Instead of\r\n     striving to please the patrons they act as though they were\r\n     doing you a personal favor to serve you, and when you are\r\n     through with your meal you must thank them for so doing and\r\n     leave a piece of money at the cash stand for them. If you don't\r\n     do that the very next time you go into that restaurant the\r\n     waiter will not want to wait on you. The poor proprietor of\r\n     the place, if he or she is one of the \"brothers\" or \"sisters,\"\r\n     is almost helpless in the matter because if he opens his mouth\r\n     to one of these so-called waitresses about the mistreatment\r\n     of their guests he is minus a waiter. Go down in the loop and\r\n     see how the other folks attend to business and treat patrons.\r\n     Awake, folks, from your slumber; you are fast asleep. Do you\r\n     hear me?\r\n\r\nA fight on vice in the Second Ward was begun by the _Searchlight_ and\r\nfinally given strong emphasis by the local daily papers.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. NEGRO NEWSPAPER POLICY\r\n\r\nAlthough Negroes for their general news depend upon the white press,\r\nwith its superior facilities, they look to the Negro press for full and\r\nspecific news covering the activities of Negroes. The editorial columns,\r\nas well as the arrangement of news items and writing of headlines, are\r\naimed at building up the morale of the Negro group. Frequently an attempt\r\nis made to get these papers into the hands of whites to acquaint them\r\nwith the Negro's point of view.\r\n\r\nA conference was held by the Commission with several Negro newspaper men.\r\nThe Negro press was represented by R. S. Abbott, editor and publisher of\r\nthe _Chicago Defender_; Nahum D. Brascher, editor-in-chief, and Claude\r\nBarnett, director of the Associated Negro Press; Willis N. Huggins,\r\neditor of the _Upreach Magazine_; and R. E. Parker, editor of the _Chicago\r\nAdvocate_.\r\n\r\nMr. Brascher, of the Associated Negro Press, said:\r\n\r\n     The colored newspapers have recently gotten up to the point\r\n     where most of us are proud to have them seen in the hands of our\r\n     white friends and it is only through them that they can really\r\n     get our viewpoint. We cannot hope to have the daily newspapers\r\n     give our viewpoint and the aspirations and struggles that we\r\n     are making, and some of the things that we are suffering. I\r\n     am very much interested in having the editorial feeling of\r\n     the newspaper get to the white people. Sometimes they may\r\n     be termed as radical. I found in recent months that some of\r\n     the weekly papers published in the South are saying things\r\n     editorially that I would question about saying even here in\r\n     Chicago, and, as we say in common parlance, getting away with\r\n     it. I have in mind now one particular instance. In Houston,\r\n     Texas, week before last, the entire circulation list of the\r\n     _Houston Informer_ was stolen out of its office. The theft\r\n     was attributed to the new organization of the Ku Klux Klan.\r\n     The daily papers of Houston came out condemning that move, and\r\n     also condemning the idea of the Ku Klux Klan, and this young\r\n     man has an editorial in last week's issue that is one of the\r\n     strongest I have ever seen on the matter, backed probably by\r\n     some of the strong things that have been said in the daily\r\n     papers.\r\n\r\n     Now if we could have people of Chicago know just how the\r\n     sentiment is changing in the South in favor of a square deal and\r\n     mutual toleration, we could soon get to a point where there'd\r\n     be no fear on either side of working out our salvation, you\r\n     might say, along co-operative lines.\r\n\r\n     Another instance concerned the _Plain Dealer_ in Birmingham,\r\n     Ala. The Ku Klux Klan paraded the streets of that city about\r\n     three weeks ago and in an editorial this paper came out and\r\n     stated that if that was done to frighten the colored people,\r\n     they had to do something different, because whenever they\r\n     began to terrorize and came down into the neighborhood where\r\n     colored people lived somebody there would be ready to meet\r\n     them. That is a pretty strong statement for Birmingham, and\r\n     they got away with it.\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Defender_ gives the greatest amount of space to criminal news\r\nof a sensational type in the field of racial happenings. It is a great\r\nfavorite in the South with Negroes because it publishes news condemning\r\nthe practices of the South in terms forbidden to southern Negro journals.\r\nOf a circulation of 185,000, two-thirds of which is outside of Chicago,\r\nit was largely responsible for stimulating the migration to the North.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Negro\" is used occasionally in the _Defender_. Its policy is\r\nto use the term \"race\" man, where it is necessary to distinguish Negro\r\nfrom other groups. Adopting the opposite policy from the white papers,\r\nit places \"white\" after persons not Negroes to mark the distinction.\r\nConcerning this, Mr. R. S. Abbott, editor of the _Defender_, said:\r\n\r\n     We use that as a bridge, as you might say, which we intend to\r\n     blow up pretty soon. We are leading the people away from the\r\n     word \"Negro,\" especially in our papers. And in cases where\r\n     white men are well known in the country we never even put\r\n     \"white\" after their names. We never put \"colored\" after a\r\n     colored man's name in this city.\r\n\r\nThe _Defender's_ editorials are as a rule carefully written, balanced,\r\nand critical, at times in contrast with the popular appeal of the news\r\narticles. The _Whip's_ editorials usually are on some aspect of the\r\ngeneral race problem in the United States. They are characterized by\r\nstrong pronouncements of the views of Negroes and violent criticism of\r\npractices alleged to be inimicable to Negroes. An editorial from each\r\nof the papers will indicate the trends of interests. The first is from\r\nthe _Defender_:\r\n\r\n                          JUST BETWEEN OURSELVES\r\n\r\n     Character is what we are; reputation is what other people think\r\n     we are. We get only the respect we demand; no more, no less.\r\n     One of the greatest barriers to our progress is the individual\r\n     who attempts to curry the favor of the whites by whom he is\r\n     employed by openly humiliating and insulting others of his\r\n     same flesh and blood. Because sections of this country reek\r\n     with color prejudice, must we lend a helping hand to those\r\n     who foster segregation, discrimination and \"Jim Crowism\" in\r\n     general? And yet that is just what many are doing.\r\n\r\n     In the railroad service as waiters and porters we have a\r\n     monopoly, and those whose runs require them to cross the Mason\r\n     and Dixon line are often confronted with situations that require\r\n     good common sense in handling. In many states the law requires\r\n     the blacks and the whites to be separated on transportation\r\n     lines, dining-rooms, places of amusement, etc. There is no\r\n     question as to whether these laws are just or unjust. They\r\n     are at least temporary laws and must be obeyed. But there is\r\n     something mentally wrong with the porter or the waiter who\r\n     lends himself to such measures, whether under orders from his\r\n     superiors or not.\r\n\r\n     Admitting that to disobey such orders means the loss of a\r\n     job, there are other jobs that pay a better wage where a\r\n     man does not have to sacrifice his principles to hold. What\r\n     other group of people in the world have those that could be\r\n     induced at any price to place their heel on the neck of even\r\n     the humblest member of their race? Are we less human, less\r\n     interested in the welfare of our race than they? Are we still\r\n     puppets, still chattels, still ignorant of the fact that as\r\n     we respect ourselves, so others will respect us? This matter\r\n     is put squarely up to you, Mr. Porter; to you, Mr. Waiter.\r\n     Will you play the part of a man and refuse to humiliate your\r\n     people? Will you cease playing the part of a spy? Will you\r\n     singly and collectively tender your resignation to employers\r\n     who require you to \"Jim Crow\" one of your own? If you will do\r\n     these things there is only one thing that can happen--a speedy\r\n     repeal of the offensive legislation.\r\n\r\n     Recently a young woman who was able to \"pass\" entered the\r\n     Washington (D.C.) railroad station café and was given a seat\r\n     at a table with several other ladies. Soon there entered\r\n     two refined, well-dressed, unmistakably colored, young women\r\n     who took seats at an unoccupied table. Immediately a colored\r\n     waiter rushed over to them and after a few minutes of whispered\r\n     conversation the embarrassed patrons followed the waiter to\r\n     a far corner of the café, where semi-screened off they were\r\n     permitted to dine. So enraged was the first young woman that\r\n     she boldly went to the desk where stood the white higher-ups\r\n     and several waiters, and gave them a curtain lecture they\r\n     doubtless will not soon forget, not failing to tell them her\r\n     own nationality. This incident happened in Washington, the\r\n     seat of our government, where the doctrine of democracy is\r\n     preached but not practiced.\r\n\r\n     Things worth having are worth fighting for. We must make\r\n     sacrifices. If it is the policy of certain business places\r\n     to discriminate let us not be a party to the discrimination.\r\n     Let it be firmly fixed in the mind that we are a vital part\r\n     of this nation's life, that we are a necessary \"evil,\" that\r\n     our places cannot and will not be filled with whites, no\r\n     matter how drastic is our stand, providing we have right on\r\n     our side, which we undoubtedly have in this instance. This\r\n     heart to heart talk applies to those engaged in other lines of\r\n     endeavor as well as it does to those who follow railroading.\r\n     Many who run barber shops, for instance, display the sign,\r\n     \"For whites only.\" If we did not realize that these evils are\r\n     the direct result of ignorance and lack of racial pride, it\r\n     would indeed be discouraging. But, truly, we are still a child\r\n     race. We must not be flattered by the tales of our marvelous\r\n     advance during the last fifty years into dropping our oars\r\n     and resting on our laurels, for we have barely started up the\r\n     hill called success. When we have reached the first milestone\r\n     on our journey--racial solidarity--the rest of the way will\r\n     be comparatively easy. Success has come to the Jew and to the\r\n     Japanese because they are clannish. Black isn't a bad shade;\r\n     let's make it popular in complexions as well as in clothes.\r\n\r\nThis is from the _Whip_:\r\n\r\n                               WHO'S AFRAID?\r\n\r\n     If the white races of the world are so sure of their inborn\r\n     and inherent supremacy, if they are so sure that they are the\r\n     salt of the earth and the born rulers of human kind, it appears\r\n     to us as strange indeed that they should fear that their glory\r\n     will be usurped, their power depreciated, and their world-wide\r\n     domination seriously challenged.\r\n\r\n     As a general rule, the giant does not fear the pigmy, neither\r\n     does man, the acme of civilization, fear that his civilization\r\n     will be eclipsed by a new order of apes. Should the tribes\r\n     and clans of the highest developed gorillas seek to overrun\r\n     the accomplishments of humanity, no one would say, \"Beware of\r\n     monkey domination.\" Man, according to his own concepts, is only\r\n     a little lower than the angels and the monkey just a little\r\n     lower than himself. The white races claim that their darker\r\n     brothers are lower in the graduated scale of their own making\r\n     than themselves, yet they cry out, \"Beware of the Yellow Peril\r\n     and behold the Black Plague.\"\r\n\r\n     If the white races possess the keys to knowledge and the\r\n     passwords to progress as well as the elixirs of strength,\r\n     why should they fear danger of \"Black domination\" and \"Yellow\r\n     dictation\"? The white man, even through the maze of his own\r\n     conceit and out of the trance of his self-hypnotism, sees that\r\n     \"he and his heirs\" shall not forever inherit the face of the\r\n     earth.\r\n\r\n     The black and yellow races are breaking the white man's monopoly\r\n     of organized brain and wealth. The white man sees this and in\r\n     his own bigotry knows that these people are not his inferiors\r\n     in latent abilities. He knows that the same fire of genius\r\n     burns in the breasts of the black and yellow races as did in\r\n     the dark and mediaeval ages. He knows that black and yellow\r\n     men can unravel the mysteries of nature and the intricacies of\r\n     science. He knows that creative and constructive ability has\r\n     been beaten down by his might but yet it lives. The white races\r\n     know that their present achievements are small in comparison\r\n     with those which will be accomplished. It is feared that in the\r\n     future, not in the mediate or immediate, but not far distant\r\n     nevertheless, that the sleeping giant will awaken, shake off\r\n     the listlessness of a thousand years and put into action again\r\n     the powerful dynamo of his great reign and shake the world\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     We do not object to the cry of \"Beware of the Yellow Peril\r\n     and behold the Black Plague.\" It is the involuntary shriek of\r\n     danger which is a part of man's reaction. White people know\r\n     that they are not superior to the dark races. They know that\r\n     the raillery about dark people being innately and inherently\r\n     inferior is nothing more than the outcropping of race prejudice,\r\n     color hatred and ignoble fear. They fear that should they lose\r\n     the power of might and brute force, and equal opportunities\r\n     are gained by the dark people, that they will be dethroned\r\n     and surpassed. For this reason they warn of the unfitness and\r\n     undesirability of their darker brothers. They ruthlessly declare\r\n     that Japanese, East Indians and Negroes are not their equals\r\n     and justify all of their tyranny upon this foolish subterfuge.\r\n\r\n     We are tired of subterfuge and evasiveness. If the white man\r\n     wishes to maintain his power at the expense of the dark people\r\n     of the world, let him cease his prattlings about charity, human\r\n     kindness and benevolence. Let him admit that he is afraid of\r\n     the rising tide of color and fear shakes his entire system.\r\n     Let the world know that the cry of inferiority and unfitness\r\n     is not conscientious and that apprehension clouds the brow of\r\n     white humanity.\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the _Searchlight_ read:\r\n\r\n                       CLEANING UP THE \"BLACK BELT\"\r\n\r\n     \"Death Corner\" has a local reputation which bespeaks an\r\n     abominable state of affairs. Nice respectable persons dare not\r\n     visit it unless heavily escorted. The \"East Side\" in New York\r\n     provokes a shiver by the very sound of the name. The \"Black\r\n     Belt\" carries the same dark background of hovering evil. One\r\n     is expected to regard black belts as isolated plague-spots\r\n     full of lurking pitfalls for unsuspecting innocents. It is\r\n     spoken of as \"that Black Belt down there.\" Little girls go\r\n     there and go wrong and you never hear of them again. When\r\n     trouble is threatened in the city the police force is dumped\r\n     into it with clubs and pistols and rifles, patrol wagons,\r\n     flivvers and ambulances. For you can never tell what is likely\r\n     to break out in a place with so many mysterious corners and\r\n     vicious characters. When the morals of the city come under\r\n     scrutiny the crusaders send up a howl of helplessness for the\r\n     rampant vices in that \"Black Belt down there.\" The entire city\r\n     believes it to be a bad place. The neglect of it is a standing\r\n     disgrace to the city, and yet the only means of cleaning it up\r\n     and bringing it up to the standard of the community as a whole\r\n     discovered so far is by keeping the handful of white persons\r\n     out of it. The protests against the mixed cafés, by far the\r\n     loudest and most severe, seem to represent the sole spirit\r\n     and motive of the effort. No attention is paid to the iron\r\n     circle tightening around this section and making it practically\r\n     impossible for Negroes to move out. No attention is paid to\r\n     the rundown schools in the district. No one is interested in\r\n     providing recreation facilities for the thousands of colored\r\n     children growing up in the streets. No one of these reformers\r\n     and critics has suggested that a branch of the public library\r\n     be made convenient. The Juvenile Protective Association, an\r\n     association whose purpose is to prevent criminality, walks\r\n     around the district and speaks about it as disparagingly as\r\n     the rest. The old Committee of Fifteen had no representative\r\n     there to detect the out-cropping of vicious places. It had been\r\n     thus for the eight years of its existence. And yet epithets\r\n     are hurled at the district, and it is called bad names and\r\n     the city turns up its nose and goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. NEGRO NEWS SOURCES\r\n\r\nNegro newspapers are published weekly because they cannot compete with\r\nthe daily papers in providing any part of the public with news from day\r\nto day.\r\n\r\nFor out-of-town news, the news letters of correspondents and accounts of\r\nincidents by specially designated representatives make up a large portion\r\nof the reports. All the papers have the service of a clipping bureau.\r\nItems in local papers are noted and, when practicable, the newspapers\r\ntelegraph to some responsible person in town to send a full account of the\r\nincident. Traveling men from Chicago and friends of the paper scattered\r\nthroughout the country also contribute to the news supply. News letters\r\ncontaining personal items are still continued in the _Defender_ and are\r\nsaid to be responsible for the first extension of its circulation. The\r\n_Defender_ and the _Whip_ have small staffs of reporters to cover local\r\nnews. The objects of the Associated Negro Press were thus outlined by\r\nMr. Barnett, a representative of that organization:\r\n\r\n     It is an organization of affiliated newspapers. We serve\r\n     eighty-nine newspapers throughout the country, the total\r\n     circulation of these papers as given to us for advertising\r\n     purposes running a little in excess of 400,000....\r\n\r\n     We handle items only that are of national importance because\r\n     we are a national news service. We gather all out of town items\r\n     that we are able to gather for the same reason, if they are of\r\n     national importance. As a news service we would not take any\r\n     purely local item in Chicago unless it would interest readers\r\n     in every section of the country. We also get service from a\r\n     clipping bureau.\r\n\r\n     It all relates to the interests of the colored people. If there\r\n     is anything which affects the country at large, which also\r\n     has either an indirect or a direct influence upon our group,\r\n     we feature it, but as a rule most of the news which we gather\r\n     is about things which particularly affect colored people.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. RUMOR\r\n\r\nRumors which significantly affect race relations consist largely of\r\nunfounded tales, incorrectly deduced conclusions, or partial statements\r\nof fact with significant content added by the narrator, all of which are\r\ngiven easy and irresponsible circulation by a credulous public during\r\nthe excitement of a clash. Examples of this type of irritating untruth\r\nwere found in the Chicago riot.\r\n\r\nThe number of Negroes killed during the riot (twenty-three Negroes\r\nand fifteen whites) has been magnified in popular accounts beyond all\r\nreasonable limits of credibility. It is popularly believed that more\r\npersons were killed than official records indicate. The exaggeration\r\nhas not been confined to reports involving Negroes. For example, there\r\nwas a report in circulation that more than seventy-five white policemen\r\nwere killed during the riot. The rumor was traced to the half-jesting\r\nremark of a policeman that, as a member of a benefit organization, he\r\nhad paid death dues on a number of policemen greater than the total\r\ndeaths of the riot as popularly estimated at the time. This number was\r\nplaced at seventy-five. The director of the Civic Bureau of the Seattle\r\nChamber of Commerce, writing to a friend in Chicago, asked for authentic\r\ninformation concerning the number of Negroes killed during the riot. He\r\nsought the information because, he said, the industrial editor of the\r\n_Outlook_ had told him that police officers said that \"more than 2,000\r\nNegroes were killed in the race riot,\" and that a certain labor report\r\nplaced the number at 1,700. Suspecting that even the latter number was\r\ntoo large, although the police mentioned 10,000 wounded and killed, he\r\nwrote for information.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. AN IMPRESSION STUDY\r\n\r\nA special impression study was made with a class of forty-nine students\r\nin the University of Chicago, to measure the effect upon them of\r\nword-of-mouth rumor, gossip, and newspaper stories concerning the 1919\r\nriot. Specific questions were asked concerning their understanding as to\r\nthe number of whites and Negroes killed and their source of information.\r\nThe students ranged in age from twenty to twenty-five years. Each was\r\nasked to indicate in the order of their influence upon him the sources\r\nof information which gave him his understanding of the magnitude of the\r\nriot. The following is a compilation from their statements.\r\n\r\nTen were out of the city at the time and got their information chiefly\r\nthrough newspapers published elsewhere. Their average opinion of\r\nthe number killed was fifty-five. Thirteen were informed chiefly by\r\nsecond-hand stories quoting relatives who were in Chicago, policemen\r\ninterviewed, and others, and their general impression of the number\r\nkilled averaged 209. Thirty-three got their information from newspapers\r\nboth in and out of the city, and their average impression of the number\r\nkilled was 115. Twenty-four of those who were residing in Chicago got\r\ntheir information chiefly from newspapers published in the city, and\r\ntheir average impression was that 131 were killed.\r\n\r\nA point of interest in comparison is that those who were out of town and\r\nread out-of-town newspapers believed seventy-three were killed, while\r\nthose who got their information through local publications thought 131\r\nwere killed. One young woman made this interesting comment:\r\n\r\n     I think a very conservative estimate of the number killed\r\n     would be about 450 or 500. My first source of information,\r\n     newspapers. My father also told me of the affair and he is a\r\n     medical director of an insurance company and therefore was in\r\n     a more or less good position to know.\r\n\r\nA young man said:\r\n\r\n     There were at least 200 people killed in the race riot.\r\n     Sources of information: a policeman who was stationed at\r\n     Forty-seventh Street and Wentworth, my own direct observations,\r\n     and conversations with people who live in the Black Belt.\r\n\r\nAnother young man said:\r\n\r\n     About 200 were killed. Chief source of information a review\r\n     of Carl Sandburg's pamphlet, and newspaper stories.\r\n\r\nAnother young woman thought that about 150 were killed. She said that\r\nher father maintained an office at Forty-third Street and St. Lawrence\r\nAvenue, which is in the Negro district. Another said:\r\n\r\n     If I remember correctly, about forty black and white people\r\n     were killed and several hundred wounded, and there was a loss\r\n     of several thousand dollars worth of property by fire. The\r\n     chief information that impressed me was personal experiences.\r\n     I witnessed one mob of 2,000 whites take a Negro on the West\r\n     Side and burn him to death. The newspaper gave me my information\r\n     of atrocities on both sides.\r\n\r\nAnother stated that he believed the number killed in the race riot in\r\nChicago was about 275, and continued:\r\n\r\n     I base my guess on reports of the newspapers, i.e., the dailies\r\n     of the city and particularly one weekly paper which in my\r\n     opinion is entirely unbiased in such matters, the _Weekly\r\n     Socialist_. I personally saw four Negroes lynched and shot to\r\n     death.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that a fairly balanced type of impression would\r\ncome from university students. The effect of rumor stands out from\r\nthe examination of this highly selected group. In exaggeration the\r\nword-of-mouth rumors led, followed by rumors circulated by newspapers\r\nand alleged first-hand accounts of eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\nRumors from policemen and relatives placed the average number of persons\r\nkilled at 209, the largest average of the lot. This is significant when\r\ntaken with the reports given in the foregoing pages which emanated from\r\npolicemen. Undoubtedly their experiences were of such a nature as to make\r\nexaggeration easy and plausible. They were living in conditions far from\r\nnormal, and their impressions were greatly magnified by the stress and\r\nthe excitement of events. The out-of-town students were less affected\r\nby word-of-mouth rumor, and consequently their impressions showed the\r\nsmallest average of persons killed.\r\n\r\nPersonal experiences show more vividly than anything else the\r\nunreliability of much of the testimony from observation that gives such\r\nfrequent rise to rumor. One student said he saw a mob of 2,000 whites\r\ntake a Negro on the West Side and burn him to death. Records show that\r\nonly one Negro was killed on the West Side (Joseph Lovings). He was shot\r\nand stabbed many times, but not burned.[92] Another student \"personally\r\nsaw four Negroes lynched and shot to death.\" No Negroes were lynched in\r\nthe riot.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE BUBBLY CREEK RUMOR\r\n\r\nA persistent rumor during the riot served to provide an explanation of\r\nthe unaccounted deaths of the riot. It had plausibility and soon was\r\naccepted and even repeated on the floor of Congress in Washington as a\r\nfact. Bubbly Creek is a small branch of the Chicago River extending to\r\nthe Stock Yards. Into it flows a great deal of waste from the slaughter\r\nhouses. The surface of the water is thick with the scum of decomposed\r\nsubstances, hair, and trash. Bodies could be thrown into it and remain\r\nundetected for a long time. A rumor became current that bodies of riot\r\nvictims were thrown into this stream. It became so persistent that efforts\r\nwere actually made to discover them. Even when no bodies were found, the\r\nrumor did not weaken. Examples of how it cropped up in various ways are\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n     A man told a friend of mine, I can furnish the name of that\r\n     man; a man told him that he saw fifty-six bodies taken out of\r\n     Bubbly Creek. [A juror in the coroner's inquest.]\r\n\r\n     I heard the story that 100 men had been taken out of Bubbly\r\n     Creek. They used a net and a seine to drag them out. [A. L.\r\n     Williams, attorney, before the coroner's jury.]\r\n\r\n     There is a story that was repeated on the floor of Congress\r\n     that numerous colored people were caught down there [at the\r\n     Stock Yards] and thrown in Bubbly Creek, and their bodies\r\n     never recovered. A congressman from our district down there,\r\n     representing our Stock Yards district, told me that on the\r\n     floor of Congress it was recently stated that a man with a\r\n     dumb-bell in his hand stood there at the big rock entrance of\r\n     Exchange Avenue and knocked a half-dozen of these colored men\r\n     on the heads as they passed through that rock door there. [A\r\n     juror in the coroner's inquest.]\r\n\r\n     I hear they dragged two or three bodies out of Bubbly Creek.\r\n     [A witness before the coroner's jury.]\r\n\r\nA meat curer in the superintendent's office of Swift & Company said:\r\n\"Well, I hear they did drag two or three out of Bubbly Creek--dead bodies,\r\nthat is the report that come in the yards, but personally I never got\r\nany positive evidence that there was any people who was found there.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Daily News_ of July 29, 1919, printed the subheading: \"Four\r\nBodies in Bubbly Creek.\" The article did not give details, but said:\r\n\"Bodies of four colored men were taken today from Bubbly Creek in the\r\nStock Yards district, it is reported.\"\r\n\r\nIn its final report the coroner's jury made a conclusive statement\r\nregarding the Bubbly Creek rumor which stamped it as pure rumor.[93]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. RIOT RUMORS\r\n\r\nThe state of mind produced by rumors is manifest in other experiences\r\nof riot. The following is an example:\r\n\r\nAt Forty-fourth Street and Grand Boulevard, a corner on which the only\r\nNegro family in the block lived at the time of the riot, an elderly\r\nwhite man clad in a worn dressing-gown, carpet slippers, and a skull\r\ncap, excitedly rushed from his house to the curb and shouted to a crowd:\r\n\"They're giving ammunition away to the niggers at the Eighth Regiment\r\nArmory!\" The crowd became excited and finally threatened the house of\r\nthe Negro family. A cry went up, \"Hang the niggers! The niggers in the\r\nhouse are firing at every white man that passes!\" The police searched\r\nthe house and found an 1894 model rifle, ammunition, that would not fit,\r\nand a decorated sword. The six Negroes in the house were taken to the\r\npolice station.\r\n\r\nDuring the riot a white man was caught crawling beneath a house in which\r\nNegroes lived. In his pocket was found a bottle of kerosene. He confessed\r\nthat his mission was arson and justified his intended act by repeating\r\na rumor then current that Negroes had set fire to the houses of whites\r\nback of the Yards.\r\n\r\nOne Negro said that a mob of white men knocked a colored woman down,\r\ncut her up frightfully, and then took her baby and dashed its brains out\r\non the street-car tracks. He was of fair complexion and could easily be\r\ntaken for white. He said:\r\n\r\n     I came upon the mob as they were laughing and shouting. Why I\r\n     could have torn every one of the white cusses in a thousand\r\n     pieces. Just think, they stood there laughing and shouting\r\n     over what they had done. Why every drop of blood in my body\r\n     boiled and at that moment I swore to God in heaven that I'd\r\n     kill some white man if I swung for it.\r\n\r\nThis report was not substantiated by wide and thorough inquiry by the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n_Rumor in the East St. Louis riot._--Under \"Myths,\" hereinafter discussed,\r\nare given stereotyped sex stories circulated to produce antagonistic\r\nsentiment toward Negroes. Many rumors, however, which had no relation\r\nto sex crimes were circulated at the time of the East St. Louis riot.\r\nThe following example taken from the testimony before one of the boards\r\nof inquiry pictures the effective use at East St. Louis of a rumor\r\nconcerning an imaginary smallpox epidemic:\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Tower_: Other statements I heard were that people\r\n     feared an epidemic of smallpox; that the County Hospital had\r\n     been burdened for months with an average of thirty cases of\r\n     smallpox.... The whole County became fearful. You could hear\r\n     the same discussions away from East St. Louis. People were\r\n     inflamed, and their feelings were directed against the big\r\n     employers of East St. Louis feeling that they were responsible\r\n     for the great influx of Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. RUMORS PREDICTING RIOTS\r\n\r\nRumors that persist usually have some plausibility. The series which\r\nfollows contains elements of possible truth. Rumors predicting race\r\nriots in Chicago centered about fixed dates on which excitement often\r\nexisted each year. Thus July 4, a holiday celebrated with fireworks and\r\nnoise in which shots would not be noticed, was the date set in popular\r\nexpectation for the Chicago riot that broke out almost three weeks later.\r\nSigns had been posted in Washington Park to the effect that Negroes\r\nwould be driven out of the park on that date.\r\n\r\nAll this expectation undoubtedly caused preparation for trouble. It is\r\nconceivable that this preparation at least accentuated the violence of\r\nthe riot which began on July 27.\r\n\r\nHallowe'en night, when ruffians could mask and take reprisals with less\r\nfear of identification or detection than ordinarily, was the next date in\r\npopular expectation. An official report to Washington by a governmental\r\nagency on \"Radicalism among Negroes,\" carried the rumor thus:\r\n\r\n     ... A report was received at this office to the effect that\r\n     an uprising of Negroes in Chicago has been planned for the\r\n     night of October 31, 1919. This report came in a somewhat\r\n     vague form, through children attending schools located in the\r\n     colored districts. The Negroes were aroused over a report to\r\n     the effect that the white residents of a certain South Side\r\n     district were planning to drive out all colored inhabitants.\r\n     The police were informed of the situation.\r\n\r\nNo riot occurred at or near that date.\r\n\r\nMay 1, 1920, was next rumored as the date when a riot would start\r\nsurpassing in violence any that had yet occurred. Labor parades were\r\nplanned in Chicago for May 1, 1920. It is also moving day, many residence\r\nleases then expiring. Thousands of Negroes, it was widely said, would be\r\ntold to leave Hyde Park. Negroes, it was further said, had no intention\r\nof leaving and would oppose ejection even with force. This rumor was\r\ntaken up and circulated by responsible authorities. As early as April\r\n20, 1920, this article appeared in the _Herald-Examiner_:\r\n\r\n                      U.S. SEES RACE RIOTS HERE MAY 1\r\n\r\n     Warning that race riots may occur in the South Side Negro\r\n     districts May 1 was sent yesterday to John H. Alcock, first\r\n     deputy superintendent of police, by the army intelligence\r\n     department. The exact nature of the warning could not be learned\r\n     and no information could be obtained as to the supposed source\r\n     of the predicted trouble, but it is expected to arise when\r\n     Negro families move into new homes in white sections of the\r\n     South Side.\r\n\r\n     Numerous bombings have given strength to the belief that more\r\n     trouble may develop this summer. Official notice to the police\r\n     department is said to have been made by E. J. Rowens of the\r\n     army intelligence staff.\r\n\r\n     No comment on the warning could be obtained from Chief of\r\n     Police John J. Garrity or Superintendent Alcock. Capt. Michael\r\n     Gallery of the Deering St. Station said that he believed such\r\n     reports were absurd.\r\n\r\n     \"I have been all through the Negro section of my district\r\n     today,\" said Capt. Gallery. \"All is serene and the Negroes are\r\n     happy. I do not believe that there will be any trouble this\r\n     summer.\"\r\n\r\n     Capt. Thomas Caughlin of the Cottage Grove Ave. Station in\r\n     whose district the riots started last summer, said he was\r\n     always prepared and on the lookout for trouble in his territory.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry based upon this \"May 1\" rumor came to the Commission. The\r\nmanager of a West Side restaurant told the Commission that a Negro girl\r\nin his employ had asked him whether it would be safe for her to come to\r\nwork on that day. Her sister had been warned in a friendly way by white\r\nfellow-waitresses in a downtown restaurant that she should not risk\r\ncoming to work that day, \"because there is going to be a race riot.\"\r\n\r\nOn May 1, as was to have been expected, thousands of persons were armed\r\nand ready for the anticipated clash.\r\n\r\nNo riots occurred. The report was later denied by the Army Intelligence\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nLabor Day, 1920, was next set. Rumors flying fast were picked up by\r\nagents from the state's attorney's office. Reports by these agents from\r\nday to day show the persistence of the rumor. For example:\r\n\r\n     The U.S. Club which had planned to hold a meeting August 28,\r\n     did not hold the meeting because they expected another race\r\n     riot on Labor Day.\r\n\r\n     On August 28, Negroes in the barber shop on ---- State Street\r\n     were carrying guns. Many went to Gary and Hammond to stock up\r\n     against Labor Day but found that hardware dealers would not\r\n     sell.\r\n\r\n     On August 29 little else was talked about in the Black Belt\r\n     outside the coming riot on Labor Day. The statement of Garrity\r\n     [chief of police] that an extra cordon of police would patrol\r\n     the Black Belt was taken as confirmation of the rumor August\r\n     20.\r\n\r\n_An averted clash._--Seeley Street on the West Side is a district\r\nwhere Negroes infrequently go. On the night of May 1, one of the dates\r\nscheduled in rumors and reports for a race riot in Chicago, the daughter\r\nof a pressroom foreman was returning home at night. As she passed an\r\nalley a man grabbed her by the arm and attempted to drag her into the\r\nalley. She managed to struggle away and ran home, reporting the incident\r\nincoherently to her father. Immediately he armed himself and went out\r\nlooking for the assailant.\r\n\r\nNear the alley where the incident occurred, a lone Negro was standing\r\ndressed in overalls. Across the street was a clubroom in which were a\r\nnumber of white men. When he saw the Negro his first impulse was to shoot.\r\nThe Negro, however, gave no indication of being hunted, but reached into\r\nhis pocket, looked at his watch, and continued to stand there.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to the father that he had not learned from the girl whether\r\nit was a white man or a Negro who had attempted to attack her. He went\r\nback home and asked, and she said it was a white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. RUMORS CONCERNING NEGRO RADICALS\r\n\r\nDuring the country-wide excitement over radicals caused by the activities\r\nof the Department of Justice in the fall of 1919, the Chicago office of\r\nthe United States Army Intelligence Bureau sent to Washington reports\r\nconcerning Negro organizations. These reports were founded upon scarcely\r\nanything more than suspicion due to lack of information and acquaintance\r\nwith the Negro group. One section of a report made in October, 1919, read:\r\n\r\n     A convention of the colored organization known as the National\r\n     Urban League was held in Detroit on October 15, 1919, at which\r\n     Eugene Kinkle Jones, Negro agitator, presided. Mr. Jones has\r\n     his headquarters at 127 East 23rd Street, New York City. Wm.\r\n     D. Haywood was invited to speak at this convention.\r\n\r\nThe National Urban League is an organization of responsible Negroes and\r\nwhites, with branches in thirty-one cities. It numbers among its executive\r\nofficers L. Hollingsworth Wood, A. S. Frizzell, Robert R. Moton, Mrs.\r\nJulius Rosenwald, George W. Seligman, and Mrs. Booker T. Washington.\r\nIts avowed purposes are:\r\n\r\n1. Try to show social welfare agencies the advantage of co-operation.\r\n\r\n2. Secure and train social workers.\r\n\r\n3. Protect women and children from unscrupulous persons.\r\n\r\n4. Fit workers for work.\r\n\r\n5. Help to secure playgrounds and other clean places of amusement.\r\n\r\n6. Organize boys' and girls' clubs and neighborhood unions.\r\n\r\n7. Help with probation oversight of delinquents.\r\n\r\n8. Maintain a country home for convalescent women.\r\n\r\n9. Investigate conditions of city life as a basis for practical work.\r\n\r\nConcerning the reference to William D. Haywood and E. K. Jones, this\r\nstatement was received by the Commission from E. K. Jones:\r\n\r\n     The National Urban League did hold its annual convention in\r\n     Detroit, October 15, 1919. William D. Haywood was not invited\r\n     to speak at this convention. Judging from the reference to\r\n     Haywood the term \"Negro agitator\" as applied to myself connotes\r\n     a most violently radical strain in whatever methods I might\r\n     be using to bring about better conditions for the Negro.\r\n\r\n     Throughout my ten years' connection with the League, I have\r\n     sought by courageous but practical methods to bring to the\r\n     Negro an opportunity in American life and have urged Negroes\r\n     to measure up in every way along lines of efficiency and be\r\n     satisfied with nothing but a square deal and equal opportunity\r\n     in our national life.\r\n\r\n     I have never suggested violence of any kind as a means toward\r\n     this end, nor, in fact, has the idea ever arisen in my mind\r\n     that this would be an effective means of attaining this end.\r\n\r\nFrom the same Intelligence Bureau report this statement is taken: \"Another\r\nrecent report states that the National Association for the Advancement\r\nof Colored People with offices at 70 Fifth Avenue, New York City, is\r\nplanning to flood the colored districts with I.W.W. literature.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is a\r\nreputable organization of whites and Negroes numbering among its executive\r\nofficers Hon. Moorfield Storey, Rev. John Haynes Holmes, Arthur E.\r\nSpingarn, Oswald Garrison Villard, Mary White Ovington, and Dr. Charles\r\nE. Bentley. It has no relation with the I.W.W. and has never planned\r\nany distribution of I.W.W. literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. RUMOR WITHIN THE NEGRO GROUP\r\n\r\nThe _Chicago Advocate_, a Negro paper of an irresponsible, sensational\r\ntype, published under large headlines a report of a run on the Lincoln\r\nState Bank. The reason alleged was indignation over the refusal of the\r\nwhite officials of the bank to lend money on Negro property in Hyde\r\nPark. The bank officials were accused of discrimination in favor of an\r\norganization of men in Hyde Park who were making every effort to keep\r\nNegroes segregated within the \"Black Belt.\" The Pyramid Building and\r\nLoan Association was said to have requested the loan. Since nearly 90\r\nper cent of the depositors of the bank were supposed to be Negroes, the\r\nact was considered an insulting disloyalty to Negroes who supported the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nA number of Negroes, believing that their savings were in danger, rushed\r\nto the bank. Soon there was an actual run, and for several days long\r\nlines of depositors passed through the bank and carried away their\r\nsavings. More than $243,000 was withdrawn. The report proved to be without\r\nfoundation, and the three largest and most influential Negro newspapers\r\naided in restoring normal business relations. The president of the bank\r\ncharged the head of the Building and Loan Association and the editor of\r\nthe newspaper that published the story with responsibility for this rumor.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. RUMORS OF ATROCITIES\r\n\r\nOf the type of rumor which has had effect upon the sentiments of Negroes\r\nconcerning the Chicago riot, the following quotations from a pamphlet\r\nentitled _The Chicago Race Riots_, by Austin D. N. Sutton, a Negro,\r\nprovide a good example:\r\n\r\n     In an investigation made personally by me, beginning about\r\n     five o'clock Wednesday afternoon, July 30, until far into the\r\n     evening, visiting the districts from Forty-seventh Street,\r\n     East to Indiana Avenue, West to Wentworth Avenue, South to\r\n     Fifty-fifth Street, I found a little short street between\r\n     Forty-eighth and Fifth Avenue called Swan Street, that is not\r\n     easily located, and very little known by the general public.\r\n     Eye-witnesses said that men, women and children were being\r\n     attacked and killed and thrown into the sewer, and no account\r\n     of their whereabouts has ever been given.\r\n\r\n     I found about twenty refugees who had been run away from their\r\n     homes on Forty-eighth, Forty-ninth and Fifth Avenue, also\r\n     Wentworth and Princeton avenues. Their homes had been burned,\r\n     and they were made to flee for their lives. I have the names\r\n     and addresses of more than one hundred cases investigated, one\r\n     more horrible case, where a young colored boy was gasolined\r\n     and burned after having been killed and where colored women\r\n     in the Stock Yards district were attacked and their breasts\r\n     cut off. These things were perpetrated by the whites upon\r\n     peaceful law-abiding blacks, some of whom had been residents\r\n     for twenty-seven years in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThorough inquiries were made by the Commission into these alleged\r\natrocities, and no evidence was found to show that anyone was \"gasolined\r\nand burned\" during the riot or that any colored women's breasts were\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. RUMORS AND THE MIGRATION\r\n\r\nThe rumors in circulation in the South at the beginning of the migration\r\nof Negroes to the North were responsible for the presence in Chicago of\r\nmany who heard them. It is hard to conceive how the tale that the Germans\r\nwere on their way through Texas to take the southern states could have\r\nbeen believed, yet it is reported that this extravagant rumor was taken\r\nseriously in some quarters.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of Meridian, Mississippi, a band of gypsies was encamped.\r\nThe rumor gained circulation that the Indians were coming back to retake\r\ntheir land, lost many years ago. Further it was declared that the United\r\nStates government was beginning a scheme to transport all the Negroes\r\nfrom the South to break up the Black Belt. Passed from mouth to mouth\r\nunrestrainedly, the tale became an established verity for many Negroes.\r\n\r\nIt was declared on the word of honor of \"one in a position to know\"\r\nthat the packing-houses in Chicago needed and would get 50,000 Negro\r\nworkers before the end of 1917. One explanation of the belief that the\r\nSouth was overrun with labor agents is the fact that Negroes at the\r\nSouth saw in every stranger a man from the North looking for laborers\r\nand their families. If he denied it, they thought that he was concealing\r\nhis identity from the police, and if he said nothing, his silence was\r\nregarded as affirmation.\r\n\r\nHundreds of disappointments of prospective migrants were traced to the\r\nrumor that a train would leave on a certain date, sometimes after the\r\npresence of a stranger in town; they would come to the station prepared\r\nto leave, and when no agent appeared, would purchase their own tickets to\r\nthe North. Wages and privileges in the North were greatly exaggerated.\r\nSome men, on being questioned, supposed that it was possible for any\r\ncommon laborer to earn $10 a day and that $50 a week was not unusual.\r\nThe strength of this belief was remarked by several social agencies\r\nin Chicago which attempted to supply migrants with work. The actual\r\nwages paid, though much in excess of what they had been receiving, were\r\ndisappointing. Similarly in the matter of privilege and \"rights,\" it was\r\nlater discovered by the migrants that unbounded liberty was not to be\r\nfound in the North. Many cases of grotesque misconduct of newly arrived\r\nmigrants in Chicago, against which more sober-minded Negroes preached,\r\npossibly had root in exaggerated reports of \"freedom and privilege\" in\r\nthe North which had reached the South.[94]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. MYTHS\r\n\r\nThere arise among groups of people various stories with little or no\r\nbasis in fact, which, through repetition and unvaried association with\r\nthe same persons or incidents, come to be regarded as true. These stories,\r\nwhen they persist through years and even through generations, are myths.\r\nThey are usually the response to a prejudice or a desire.\r\n\r\nIn general they have some plausible and apparent justification. In turn\r\nthey lend stability not only to the beliefs out of which they were born,\r\nbut to themselves. Frequently they are the result of the assumption that\r\nbecause two things happen at the same time they are connected by the\r\nrelationship of cause and effect. So long as these stories are uncorrected\r\nthey hold and exercise a marked degree of control over personal conduct.\r\n\r\nMyths are important in any consideration of the instruments of\r\nopinion-making. Fernand von Langenhove, a Belgian scientist associated\r\nwith the Solvay Institute for Sociological Study at Brussels, has made\r\nprobably the first researches in this field. He took as his material\r\nthe reports spread in Germany by German soldiers concerning the Belgian\r\npriests. These myths, for the most part unfounded, began to spread and\r\neventually were taken up by German authorities and given the stamp of\r\nofficial sanction. The reports were investigated and found to be false\r\nand libelous by German authorities themselves. The method by which these\r\nmyths arose is thus described in his book _The Growth of a Legend_:\r\n\r\n     Hardly had the German armies entered Belgium when strange\r\n     rumors began to circulate. They spread from place to place.\r\n     They were reproduced by the press and they soon permeated\r\n     the whole of Germany.... Public credulity accepted these\r\n     stories. The highest powers in the state welcomed them without\r\n     hesitation and indorsed them with their authority. Even the\r\n     Emperor echoed them and, taking them for a text, advanced in\r\n     the famous telegram of September 8, 1914, addressed to the\r\n     President of the United States, the most terrible accusations\r\n     against the Belgian people and clergy.\r\n\r\n     ... It was the German army which, as we have seen, constituted\r\n     the chief breeding ground for legendary stories. These were\r\n     disseminated with great rapidity among the troops; the liaison\r\n     officers, the dispatch riders, the food convoys, the victualling\r\n     posts assured the diffusion of them....\r\n\r\n     Submitted to the test of the German military inquiry these\r\n     stories are shown to be without foundation. Received from the\r\n     front and narrated by a soldier who professes to have been\r\n     an eye witness, they are nevertheless clothed in the public\r\n     view with special authority. Welcomed without control by the\r\n     press, the stories recounted in letters from the front appear,\r\n     however, in the eyes of the readers of a paper clothed with\r\n     a new authority--that which attaches to printed matter. They\r\n     lose in the columns of a paper their individual and particular\r\n     character.... The statements thus obtain a substance and an\r\n     objectivity of which they would otherwise be devoid. Mixed\r\n     with authentic news, they are accepted by the public without\r\n     mistrust. Is not their appearance in the paper a guaranty of\r\n     accuracy?...\r\n\r\n     All these pseudo-historical publications are, however, only\r\n     one aspect of the abundant literary production of the Great\r\n     War....\r\n\r\n     So one finds in this literature of the lower classes the\r\n     principal legendary episodes of which we have studied the origin\r\n     and followed the development; accommodated to a fiction, woven\r\n     into a web of intrigue, they have undergone new transformations;\r\n     they have lost every indication of their source; they are\r\n     transposed in the new circumstances imagined for them; they\r\n     have usually been dissociated from the circumstances which\r\n     individualize them and fix their time and place.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of myths concerning Negroes shows a striking resemblance to\r\nthese mentioned by von Langenhove. In this category would fall the myths\r\nconcerning Negro mentality, or the closing of the frontal sutures at\r\nthe age of fourteen; the \"rape myth,\" or the belief that some character\r\nweakness and inordinate sexual virility in Negroes make them rapists\r\nby nature; and the \"insurrection myth,\" or the recurrent assertion and\r\nbelief that Negroes are plotting the downfall of the government. These\r\nare general in their acceptance. They illustrate the tendency of authors\r\nobserved by Langenhove in his study \"to incorporate new ideas with the\r\ncomplex old ones and show that they are not surprising and that all\r\nearlier facts tend to prove it.\" The efforts of some recent writers on\r\nthe Negro question may be noted.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 R. M. Bache[95] made one of the first experimental studies\r\nof the relative mentality of the white, Negro, and Indian races. His\r\nstudy was based on only ten Negroes. He began with an assumption of the\r\ninferiority of Negroes and was satisfied that he had proved it. In his\r\ntests the whites were slowest in reacting to the visual, auditory, and\r\nelectrical stimulation, the Indians were quickest, and the Negroes about\r\nmidway between. He deduced from this that the whites were superior,\r\nthe Indians next, and the Negroes the lowest of the group. The Negroes\r\nhe explained were slower than the Indians because they were of mixed\r\nwhite and Negro blood and had inherited the effects of slavery, while\r\nthe Indians' mode of life compelled them to rely upon quick movement.\r\nTherefore he said the Indian was of a higher race than the Negro. Dr.\r\nVogt, a German anthropologist, is responsible for the statement: \"On\r\nexamining the brain of a Negro I find a remarkable resemblance between\r\nthe ape and the Negro, especially with reference to the development of\r\nthe temporal lobe.\" He made this deduction from the examination of the\r\nskull of one Hottentot Negro woman.\r\n\r\nA. T. Smith made association and memory tests and concluded[96] that the\r\nNegro child was psychologically different from the white child in power\r\nof abstraction, judgment, and analysis. He took a single Negro boy as\r\ntypical.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of studying myths pertinent to this inquiry instances\r\nwere taken from the testimony in race riots, both in East St. Louis and\r\nChicago. The excerpts which follow illustrate the tendency of myths to\r\ncreate and give currency to rumors:\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGROES SECRETING ARMS\r\n\r\n     I returned in about an hour and learned from Col. Tripp\r\n     that it had been reported that Negroes were forming and had\r\n     large quantities of arms and ammunition at a saloon on the\r\n     northeasterly corner of Nineteenth and Market Avenue; at the\r\n     time the small detachment of troops remaining at the City\r\n     Hall was loaded into an auto truck and Col. Tripp, Lieut.\r\n     Col. Clayton, Chief of Police Ransom Payne and myself, in my\r\n     automobile proceeded to the saloon and pool-room located at the\r\n     northeasterly corner of Nineteenth Street and Market Avenue,\r\n     where it was reported there were large stores of ammunition\r\n     and arms.\r\n\r\n     We accompanied Col. Tripp into the building and found perhaps\r\n     fifteen or eighteen Negro men; Col. Tripp ordered them to\r\n     surrender arms and there being no ready compliance with the\r\n     order, he thereupon ordered them searched and found one man who\r\n     had a number of loaded shot-gun shells. [Testimony by Thomas\r\n     L. Fekete, Jr., city attorney of East St. Louis, at East St.\r\n     Louis Inquiry into Conduct of Militia.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGROES PLANNING ATTACK\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Now what happened Tuesday?\r\n\r\n     _Answer_: Well, Tuesday I spent most of my time in the City\r\n     Hall except when we would be sent out on false alarms, calls\r\n     from the different parts of the city. That was practically all\r\n     of our work there then. There was no rioting on Tuesday, but\r\n     they continued calling from different parts of the city that\r\n     Negroes were forming and ready to attack, and we would send\r\n     men, whenever they were available, out with squads, two squads\r\n     of men to investigate, but invariably it was a false alarm.\r\n     [Testimony by Major Wm. Klauser at East St. Louis Inquiry into\r\n     Conduct of Militia.]\r\n\r\n     CONCEALING ARMS FOR INSURRECTION\r\n\r\n     We then searched the building, particularly the dwelling\r\n     quarters above these rooms, for arms which it had been alleged\r\n     Dr. L. N. Bundy had stored at this place. We found that Dr.\r\n     Bundy had sent two cartons of his property to this place for\r\n     safe-keeping and on opening the cartons, we discovered that they\r\n     contained no firearms or ammunition, but contained automobile\r\n     supplies and some stationery. [Testimony by Col. S. O. Tripp\r\n     at East St. Louis Inquiry into Conduct of Militia.]\r\n\r\n     NEGROES ARMING AND PLANNING AN ATTACK\r\n\r\n     Then we commenced to get reports from different parts of the\r\n     city that Negroes were arming, getting ready to attack. One of\r\n     the persistent rumors was there were two hundred Negroes armed\r\n     around Sixty and Bond streets some place there. That rumor\r\n     was so persistent that Col. Tripp ordered me to take Company\r\n     B down and investigate it and the police sent one policeman\r\n     along to show us the way and show us the place where it was\r\n     supposed to be. We got down there within probably three blocks\r\n     of the place and the policeman told us we better not get too\r\n     close without forming a line of skirmishers, which I did. I\r\n     divided the company into two platoons. One platoon under the\r\n     Company commander and the other under the first lieutenant, and\r\n     we combed that district all through. The policeman deserted\r\n     us as soon as we started out and we were all left alone. We\r\n     combed all over for an hour or probably more.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Who was the commander of Company B?\r\n\r\n     _Answer_: Captain Eaton. We did not find a single thing except\r\n     two Negroes who just came out of a house. We searched them and\r\n     they were armed and we arrested them. We brought these back\r\n     with us when we came perhaps an hour or an hour and a half\r\n     later.\r\n\r\n     _Question_: Is there anything else that night?\r\n\r\n     _Answer_: Yes, it was not very long until we got rumors that at\r\n     about 27th and 28th and Tudor that the Negroes and whites were\r\n     in a pitched battle. That is about two miles I think southeast,\r\n     and they asked me to go out and look into the situation and\r\n     take a squad of men with me ... we got to Eighteenth and Bond\r\n     and we were perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead of the truck and\r\n     we were fired upon. We stopped the car and Brown returned the\r\n     fire. We could see smoke coming from a vacant lot and by that\r\n     time the truck came up and we formed a line of skirmishers\r\n     and went through and could not find a single thing.\r\n\r\n     The Chief of Police was advised, on rumor, that Negroes were\r\n     forming in the Black Belt for the purpose of marching on the\r\n     whites. In response to this rumor, the witness [Col. S. O.\r\n     Tripp], the Acting Mayor [Fekete], and the military officials\r\n     left for the seat of the purported mobilization of Negroes,\r\n     but found that the report was untrue. The record shows that\r\n     during this temporary departure of authorities, military and\r\n     civil, acts of lawlessness were being exerted against Negroes\r\n     in other sections of the city. [Testimony by Major Wm. Klauser\r\n     at East St. Louis Inquiry into Conduct of Militia.]\r\n\r\n\r\nARMED AND MASSED ATTACKS BY NEGROES\r\n\r\n     ... As we got to 27th and Tudor I found a first lieutenant of\r\n     the Missouri National Guard there. I afterwards found out his\r\n     name was Crawley. He had one soldier with him. He called him his\r\n     orderly. I think his name was Murphy. There they were perhaps\r\n     a dozen young men, about eighteen or twenty, armed with rifles\r\n     and were lined up at 28th Street there under trees, that is\r\n     behind trees, at least it looked that way in the night, and\r\n     perhaps a half a block more north it looked to me two houses\r\n     were burning; it was a big fire; they were burning, and they\r\n     claimed that the Negroes had been firing at them and they\r\n     were returning the fire, and I guess that is where the report\r\n     came from. He advised me that it was a little dangerous work\r\n     up there and that we had better form a few men, form a line\r\n     of skirmishers, and I sent one bunch to the east side of the\r\n     fire to see what we could find in there. So I did that. I gave\r\n     Capt. Easterday a bunch of men, one detachment, and Lieut.\r\n     Brown another, one on each side, and then Lieut. Crawley and\r\n     one private went right through the center of it, right next to\r\n     the place seemed deserted and we could not find anybody and\r\n     we waited for the other detachments to come out and they did\r\n     not find anything and I walked around, it seemed on the west\r\n     side of the block, between 27th and 28th Streets, and I saw a\r\n     couple of fellows sticking their heads up over the fence, the\r\n     fence of an old two story brick building, and I hollered. I\r\n     thought perhaps it was Lieut. Crawley and waited for him and we\r\n     found a bunch of Negroes in there, perhaps twenty-five of them.\r\n     Lieut. Crawley and myself lined them up and searched them and\r\n     there was not a Negro who had any arms or ammunition, and we\r\n     asked if there were any more in the house, and they said this\r\n     private came in and already had three of us. So Lieut. Crawley\r\n     said if I guard the ones outside he would go inside and run\r\n     the rest out, so in the neighborhood of one hundred fifty or\r\n     two hundred came out, men, women and children and we searched\r\n     all of them but did not find anything on them. [Testimony by\r\n     Thomas L. Fekete, city attorney at East St. Louis Inquiry into\r\n     Conduct of Militia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE RAPE MYTH\r\n\r\nIt is the common belief among whites that Negroes are rapists by nature.\r\nIn this belief are involved the \"fear obsession\" of Negro men, held by\r\nmany white women, fear of the \"social equality\" bugaboo, condonings of\r\nlynchings, and repressive social restriction as well as attempts at\r\nlegislative restraints. The persistency of these assertions and this\r\nbelief point to an interesting peculiarity of popular opinion.[97] There\r\nhave been cases of rape involving Negroes, but they have contributed no\r\nsuch preponderance as would justify the wholesale charge against the Negro\r\nrace. The tendency is to stress Negro sex offenses as though they alone\r\nconstituted almost the whole of revolting crime. The usual proportion of\r\nwhite sex offenses is lost in the general statistics of crime. In the\r\nSouth, where it was first persistently asserted that Negro men have an\r\nabnormal tendency to sexual crimes, each crime, or attempted crime, and\r\nin many cases even suspected crime, of this sort has registered itself\r\nin a lynching.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-year period between 1883 and 1903 there were lynched in\r\nthe South 1,985 Negroes. Rape was assigned as the cause in 675 cases.\r\nIn 1,310 cases other causes were given. James Welden Johnson, field\r\nsecretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\r\nPeople, has prepared figures on lynchings and sex offenses charged to\r\nNegroes which point out the misrepresentation in easy but persistent\r\ncharges and the unquestioning acceptance of them by the public. He says:\r\n\r\n     Whenever the Negro protests against lynching, nearly all\r\n     southern newspapers and a great many northern newspapers call\r\n     upon him to deprecate the crime which leads to lynching. The\r\n     authentic statistics on lynching prove the falsehood on which\r\n     this propaganda is based. In the past thirty-five years fifty\r\n     Negro women have been lynched. In the twelve-month period,\r\n     August, 1918-August, 1919 [when the statement was prepared]\r\n     five Negro women were lynched.\r\n\r\n                  LYNCHINGS\r\n     ===========+===========+==============\r\n                |           |    Number\r\n        Years   | Lynchings | Charged with\r\n                |           |     Rape\r\n     -----------+-----------+--------------\r\n     1914-18[98]|     264   |       28\r\n     1883-1903  |   1,985   |      675\r\n     -----------+-----------+--------------\r\n\r\nWhen the Congressional Committee on Immigration in 1911 made its study\r\nof crime in the United States, an investigation was made of 2,262 cases\r\nin the New York Court of General Sessions, and in that investigation\r\nit was found that the percentage for the crime of rape was lower for\r\nNegroes than for either the foreign-born whites or native whites.\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK COURT OF GENERAL SESSIONS[99]\r\n\r\n            1911                    Rape\r\n     Native-born whites         .8 per cent\r\n     Foreign-born whites       1.8 per cent\r\n     Negroes                    .5 per cent\r\n\r\nContrast these records, bad as they may appear, with the records for New\r\nYork County, which is only a part of New York City, and we find that in\r\nthis one county in the single year of 1917, 230 persons were indicted\r\nfor rape. Of this number, 37 were indicted for rape in the first degree.\r\n\r\n                    INDICTMENTS AND LYNCHINGS FOR RAPE\r\n\r\n     ===============================+========+======================+========\r\n                 Place              |  Year  |      Crime           | Number\r\n     -------------------------------+--------+----------------------+--------\r\n     Number indicted by Grand Jury, |  1917  |      Rape            | 230\r\n       New York County              |        |                      |\r\n     Number of whites indicted by   |  1917  | Rape in first degree |  37\r\n       Grand Jury, New York County  |        |                      |\r\n     Number of Negroes indicted by  |  1917  | Rape in first degree |   0\r\n       Grand Jury, New York County  |        |                      |\r\n     Number of Negroes lynched in   | {1914} | Charged with rape    |  28\r\n       entire United States         | {1918} |                      |\r\n     -------------------------------+--------+----------------------+--------\r\n\r\n     That is, in just a part of New York City the number of persons\r\n     indicted for rape in the first degree was nine more than the\r\n     total number of Negroes lynched on the charge of rape in the\r\n     entire United States during the period 1914-1918. Among these\r\n     thirty-seven persons indicted by the New York County Grand\r\n     Jury, there was not a single Negro. The evidence required by\r\n     the Grand Jury of New York County to indict a person charged\r\n     with rape must be more conclusive than the evidence required\r\n     by a mob to lynch a Negro accused of rape.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago the statistics of sex offenses tell a significant story.\r\nChicago judges in the criminal courts were questioned by the Commission\r\non their experience to test the foundation of this belief. Their replies\r\nwere practically unanimous. Some of them are given:\r\n\r\n     _Judge Pam_: You talk about sex cases. Whether you call them\r\n     rape cases or crimes against children, I have more serious\r\n     rape cases against white than I have against colored people.\r\n     The most serious case I had was about ten days ago, and I\r\n     sentenced the man to life imprisonment. I never had such a\r\n     case involving a Negro.\r\n\r\n     _Commissioner_: We read a great deal in the papers about rape\r\n     in the South. How does the colored man stand on that matter\r\n     in comparison to the white man?\r\n\r\n     _Judge Thompson_: Practically the same.\r\n\r\n     _Commissioner_: You spoke about crimes involving sex. What\r\n     is your experience with regard to whether they are committed\r\n     more often by colored persons than whites?\r\n\r\n     _Judge Trude_: I don't think in Chicago they are committed\r\n     more by Negroes than whites.\r\n\r\n     _Judge Thompson_: In my work with the criminal court I was\r\n     astounded at the large number of crimes involving the sexual\r\n     abuse of children, but I remember no case in which a colored\r\n     defendant was charged with that crime. Almost all other races\r\n     were represented, but I don't remember one colored man charged\r\n     with the abuse of a child.... I tried many of those cases,\r\n     but never tried a colored man for that offense. I would say\r\n     the majority of them were slavic or German; practically no\r\n     Scandinavian.\r\n\r\n     _Dr. Adler, State Criminologist_: We had the same thing here\r\n     in Chicago of a colored man sent to the penitentiary on a\r\n     charge of attempted rape or something of that sort, where the\r\n     identification was made by a child of six or eight years who\r\n     picked him out in a crowd under suspicion. No such evidence\r\n     ought to be accepted. We are perfectly sure, and everybody\r\n     else agrees that such evidence is not sufficient to warrant\r\n     the action.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE SEX MYTH\r\n\r\n_East St. Louis riot._--The records of the Congressional Investigating\r\nCommittee contain much evidence of the use of this myth in fomenting\r\nriots. Edward F. Mason, representing the interests of labor, gave a\r\nvivid account of the report that Negro men had committed vicious acts\r\nof assault against white girls in the East St. Louis streets. He stated\r\nfurther that 200 white women were among the 1,200 persons present at\r\nthe meeting on the night of May 28, just prior to the riot, and that\r\n\"we brought these girls along to see if we couldn't teach--we wanted to\r\nwake him [the mayor] up. He was in a trance. He couldn't see the thing\r\nlike we did.\"\r\n\r\nAlois Towers emphasized in his testimony the sentiment among the whites\r\nof East St. Louis just prior to the outbreak:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Chairman, yesterday I made the statement that the great\r\n     influx of Negroes was responsible for the riot. I want to\r\n     try and show some of the feelings that developed after this\r\n     great influx of Negroes. It was a terrible feeling in the\r\n     air. Everyone felt that something terrible was going to\r\n     happen. On the street comers, wherever you went, you heard\r\n     expressions against the Negro. You heard that the Negro was\r\n     driving the white man out of the locality--by moving into\r\n     the white neighborhood--that the whites were being forced out\r\n     of their localities. Stories were afloat on the streets and\r\n     on the street cars of the worst kind that would inflame the\r\n     feelings. For instance, I heard one story so persistently that\r\n     I commenced to think later on there might be some truth in it.\r\n     First I thought it was just originated by some who might want\r\n     to inflame the feelings of the people. I heard stories of this\r\n     kind and I heard it no less than a dozen times on the streets\r\n     of East St. Louis, that Negroes had made the boast that they\r\n     were invited to East St. Louis; that great numbers of white\r\n     people were taken away for war purposes; and that _there would\r\n     be lots of white women for the Negroes in East St. Louis_....\r\n     The whole country became fearful. You could hear the same\r\n     discussions away from East St. Louis. People were inflamed and\r\n     their feelings were directed against big employers of East\r\n     St. Louis, feeling that they were responsible for the great\r\n     influx of Negroes.\r\n\r\nOf actual assaults against white women there was found no evidence.\r\nTestimony by the mayor before the Military Committee investigating the\r\nconduct of soldiers adds substantiation to this fact:\r\n\r\n     _Q._: Now did you hear of any other complaints of these colored\r\n     men from any source as to their conduct and behavior when\r\n     they first came here other than being imported here to work\r\n     in large numbers?\r\n\r\n     _A._: Yes sir.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: What do you know about it?\r\n\r\n     _A._: Some complaints that they were sticking up people, holding\r\n     up people at night time, and various other police violations.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: Now were these complaints verified by the records, or\r\n     otherwise?\r\n\r\n     _A._: I think they were, they were arrested and locked up,\r\n     got trial and punishment, the usual procedure of the Police\r\n     Department and Courts.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: You keep in pretty close touch with these Police Court\r\n     Proceedings?\r\n\r\n     _A._: Yes sir.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: So you would say that there were more colored people\r\n     arrested and convicted for such offenses as you mentioned than\r\n     there were four or two years ago?\r\n\r\n     _A._: I have not made that comparison, but I would think so.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: Any other offenses except larceny and robbery?\r\n\r\n     _A._: No.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: Any sex outrages?\r\n\r\n     _A._: No.\r\n\r\n     _Q._: No complaints or prosecutions that white women were\r\n     outraged by colored men?\r\n\r\n     _A._: No sir.\r\n\r\n               [Board of Inquiry, East St. Louis, Ill.]\r\n\r\n_Washington riot._--The Washington race riot was precipitated by reports\r\nof alleged attacks upon white women by Negroes. These reports were\r\nfeatured in the daily newspapers with large front-page headlines, and\r\nsuggestions were made that probable lynchings would follow the capture\r\nof the Negroes. The series of reported assaults totaled seven. In each\r\nit was claimed that a Negro had assaulted a white woman. When the fury\r\nand excitement of the riot had subsided and the facts were sifted, it\r\nwas found that of the seven assaults reported, four were assaults upon\r\ncolored women. Three of the alleged criminals arrested and held for\r\nassault were white men, and at least two of the white men were prosecuted\r\nfor assaults upon colored women. It further developed that three of the\r\nassaults were supposed to have been committed by a suspect who at the\r\ntime of the riots was under arrest.\r\n\r\n_Waukegan riot._--A story with the implication that a sex issue was\r\ninvolved was the significant feature of the riot between marines from\r\nthe Great Lakes Naval Training Station, aided by citizens of Waukegan,\r\nand the Negro residents of Waukegan. It is entirely likely that the\r\noutburst was wholly precipitated by the entirely false report that\r\n\"Mrs. Blazier, the wife of Lieutenant Blazier,\" was \"attacked\" by Negro\r\nboys.[100] Lieutenant Blazier, it developed, was unmarried and had no\r\nwoman occupant in the car.\r\n\r\n_Chicago riot._--The most atrocious murder of the Chicago riot of 1919 was\r\nprecipitated by a report involving an Italian girl. The story circulated\r\nthat she had been killed by a Negro. Joseph Lovings, an innocent Negro,\r\nchanced into the neighborhood on a bicycle. He was set upon and murdered.\r\nThe coroner found fourteen bullet wounds, many stab wounds, contusion of\r\nthe head, and fractures of the skull bones and of the limbs. The report\r\nproved a myth, for no girl was killed by anyone during the riot. The\r\nNegro killed was innocent of any injury, and if a girl was injured it\r\nhad not been learned by whom the injury was inflicted. There had been\r\nno previous rioting on the West Side, where the murder was committed,\r\nand no further clashes followed it. The usual report of the burning of\r\nthe Negro which followed an assault was also circulated, and this was\r\nfalse and unfounded.\r\n\r\nIn the frenzy of the rioting in Chicago a report gained circulation\r\nthat white women were being attacked by Negroes. Some reports picked\r\nup by newspapers asserted that women were being shot as the riot grew.\r\nThe _Chicago American_ during the riot pertinently made a plea for\r\ncool-headedness and intelligence in receiving reports. In an editorial\r\nit thus importuned the citizenry:\r\n\r\n     Don't circulate wild stories that tend to infuriate respectable\r\n     citizens, both white and black. They are trying to suppress\r\n     the hoodlums who have been responsible for all the rioting.\r\n\r\n     Don't believe every infuriating report you hear, and don't\r\n     repeat them to others more credulous than yourself.\r\n\r\n     Depend on the _American_ to tell you what happened just as\r\n     accurately as careful, intelligent reporting will permit.\r\n\r\n     The most notable instance of inflammatory faking was observed\r\n     in one newspaper (not the _American_) yesterday afternoon. It\r\n     ran across its front page in big type the heading: \"Women Shot\r\n     as Riots Grow.\" It was based on an incoherent, unsubstantiated\r\n     rumor which later investigation proved has no foundation.\r\n\r\n     The same information was received by the _Evening American_\r\n     from the detective bureau, where the report was received. The\r\n     _American_ published a few lines announcing that the police\r\n     had received such reports. Men were rushed out, but the report\r\n     could not be verified, and this newspaper withdrew further\r\n     publication of the unverified report.\r\n\r\nAt Chicago Heights a race riot was reported on August 7, 1920. It was\r\nsaid in the press that a Negro motor-cyclist had run down a Hungarian\r\nboy. The actual report circulated was that a Negro had struck an Italian\r\ngirl. The latter report was not true; the first one, contrary to press\r\nreports, did not start a riot. In fact, there was no riot.\r\n\r\nIn the racial clash of September 20, 1920, the sex myth again arose.[101]\r\nImmediately after one of the Negroes had struck Barrett down, the trio\r\nran. Few persons actually knew what had occurred. Excitement waxed high\r\nwhen the wild report flew about that a Negro had attacked a white woman.\r\nA mob of several thousand men, women, and children formed to storm the\r\nchurch in which they had sought refuge.\r\n\r\nAn investigator from the Commission, sent out immediately after the clash,\r\npicked up traces of this myth in the sentiments of white residents of\r\nthe neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThere was a story which everyone in the neighborhood seemed to know\r\nconcerning trouble on the street-car lines between Negroes and whites.\r\nA middle-aged Irish woman on Union Avenue, who had been with the crowd\r\nat the church, gave the following account of it: \"Not long ago, a Negro\r\nknocked a white woman off the cars. It never appeared in the papers. I\r\nnever go on the cars where they [Negroes] are. You couldn't get me to\r\ngo on a State Street car line.\"\r\n\r\nA barber at Forty-fifth Street and Emerald Avenue said:\r\n\r\n     There was some trouble the Saturday before Labor Day. A Negro\r\n     gave the conductor a dollar bill, and the conductor said\r\n     he hadn't change and told him to get off the car. As he was\r\n     getting off, he knocked against a white woman, and seven men\r\n     in an automobile who were right behind the car saw him and\r\n     chased him. They brought him up to the alley right across the\r\n     street, beat him up, and cut up his head something awful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nBoth whites and Negroes have recognized the value of propaganda as\r\nan instrument of opinion-making. Both employ it, sometimes openly,\r\nsometimes insidiously. Its effects may be unmistakably observed in\r\nmuch of the literature about the Negro. It is the purpose here to give\r\nattention to certain forms of propaganda now in circulation, with a view\r\nto defining roughly their place in the manufacture of sentiment on the\r\nrace question in Chicago. In spite of similarity it would be obviously\r\nunfair to lump all sorts of propaganda, good and bad, under one general\r\nclassification. It is possible, however, to classify different types\r\nfrom the examples which came to the attention of the Commission, as\r\nfollows: (1) educational, (2) radical and revolutionary, (3) malicious,\r\n(4) defensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. EDUCATIONAL PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nPropaganda on the race situation with a true educational purpose seems to\r\nbe confined largely to organizations composed of both whites and Negroes,\r\nwho make joint appeals to both groups. An example is the publicity\r\ncampaign of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\r\nPeople. This Association definitely asserts that it can best accomplish\r\nits ends by reaching \"the conscience and heart of the American people,\"\r\nand publicity is the weapon. The _Crisis_ magazine is the principal organ\r\nof the Association, although the public is reached through various other\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Association for 1919, the following figures\r\ncovering the circulation of information is obtained: During that year\r\n1,138,900 copies of the _Crisis_ were sold; officers of the Association\r\ntraveled 101,009 miles, delivered 286 addresses, including eleven in\r\nChicago, and contributed nineteen special articles, not including special\r\nreleases, of press material to magazines of wide circulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. RADICAL AND REVOLUTIONARY PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nA broad basis of appeal to Negroes as a group is provided in their\r\neconomic status. Placed by circumstances near the bottom of the industrial\r\nladder, victims of exploitation, restlessly resentful of practices\r\nemployed against them because of class as well as race, it might be\r\nreasoned that they would be vitally interested in a revolution, industrial\r\nif not social. The Industrial Workers of the World has reasoned after\r\nthis fashion and, probably because class meant more to it than race,\r\nextended open arms to Negro workers. This appeal was even stronger\r\nin view of the attitude of partial exclusion adopted by many trades\r\nunions. To strengthen its organization, ally with it a restless group,\r\n90 per cent of whom are laborers, while at the same time providing an\r\nunmistakable demonstration of its own disregard for race lines in its\r\nso-called struggle for \"industrial freedom,\" the I.W.W. directed a\r\ndefinite propaganda toward the Negro group, and founded it upon a very\r\nhuman desire. Thousands of letters and pamphlets were addressed, \"To\r\nthe colored workingmen and women,\" calling them fellow-workers. Excerpts\r\nfrom one of them follow:\r\n\r\n     There is one question which, more than any other, presses upon\r\n     the mind of the worker today, regardless of whether he be of\r\n     one race or another, of one color or another, the question of\r\n     how he can improve his conditions, raise his wages, shorten\r\n     his hours of labor, and gain something more of freedom from\r\n     his master, the owners of the industry wherein he labors.\r\n\r\n     To the black race, who, but recently, with the assistance\r\n     of the white men of the northern states, broke their chains\r\n     of bondage and ended chattel slavery, a prospect of further\r\n     freedom or _real freedom_ should be most appealing.\r\n\r\n     For it is a fact that the Negro worker is no better off under\r\n     the freedom he has gained than under the slavery from which\r\n     he has escaped. As chattel slaves we were the property of\r\n     our masters and, as a piece of valuable property, our masters\r\n     were considerate of us and careful of our health and welfare.\r\n     Today, as wage workers, the boss may work us to death, at the\r\n     hardest and most hazardous labor, at the longest hours, at\r\n     the lowest pay, we may quietly starve when out of work and the\r\n     boss loses nothing by it and has no interest in us. To him the\r\n     worker is but a machine for producing profits and when you,\r\n     as a slave who sells himself to the master on the installment\r\n     plan, become old, or broken in health or strength, or should\r\n     you be killed while at work, the master merely gets another\r\n     wage slave on the same terms.\r\n\r\n     We who have worked in the South know that conditions in lumber\r\n     and turpentine camps, in the fields of cane, cotton and tobacco,\r\n     in the mills and mines of Dixie, are such that the workers\r\n     suffer a more miserable existence than ever prevailed among\r\n     the chattel slaves before the great Civil War. Thousands of\r\n     us have come and are coming northward, crossing the Mason and\r\n     Dixon line, seeking better conditions. As wage slaves we have\r\n     run away from the masters in the South, but to become the wage\r\n     slaves of the masters in the North. In the North we find that\r\n     the hardest work and the poorest pay are our portion. We are\r\n     driven while on the job, and the high cost of living offsets\r\n     any higher pay we might receive.\r\n\r\n     The only problem then, which the colored worker should consider,\r\n     as a worker, is the problem of organization with other working\r\n     men in the labor organization that best expresses the interest\r\n     of the whole working class against the slavery and oppression\r\n     of the whole capitalist class. Such an organization is the\r\n     I.W.W., the _Industrial Workers of the World_, the only labor\r\n     union that has never, _in theory or practice_, since its\r\n     beginning, twelve years ago, barred the workers of any race or\r\n     nation from membership. The following has stood as a principle\r\n     of the I.W.W., embodied in its official constitution since\r\n     its formation in 1905:\r\n\r\n          \"By-Laws. Article I--Section 1\r\n\r\n          \"No working man or woman shall be excluded from\r\n          membership in Unions because of creed or color.\"\r\n\r\n     If you are a wage worker you are welcome in the I.W.W. halls,\r\n     no matter what your color. By this you may see that the I.W.W.\r\n     is not a white man's union, not a black man's union, not a\r\n     red or yellow man's union, but a _working man's union_. _All\r\n     of the working class in one big union._\r\n\r\n     In the I.W.W. all wage workers meet on common ground. No\r\n     matter what language you may speak, whether you were born in\r\n     Europe, in Asia or in any other part of the world, you will\r\n     find a welcome as a fellow worker. In the harvest fields where\r\n     the I.W.W. controls, last summer saw white men, black men and\r\n     Japanese working together as union men and raising the pay of\r\n     all who gathered the grain. In the great strikes the I.W.W.\r\n     has conducted at Lawrence, Massachusetts, in the woolen mills,\r\n     in the iron mills of Minnesota and elsewhere, the I.W.W. has\r\n     brought the workers of many races, colors and tongues together\r\n     in victorious battles for a better life.\r\n\r\n     The foundation of the I.W.W. is _industrial unionism_. All\r\n     workers in any division of any industry are organized into an\r\n     _industrial union of all_ the workers in the _entire industry_;\r\n     these _industrial unions_ in turn are organized into _industrial\r\n     departments_ of connecting or kindred industries, while all are\r\n     brought together in the _central organization of the Industrial\r\n     Workers of the World--one big union of all the working class\r\n     of the world_. No one but actual wage workers may join. The\r\n     working class cannot depend upon anyone but itself to free it\r\n     from wage slavery. \"He who would be free, himself must strike\r\n     the blow.\"\r\n\r\n     When the I.W.W. through this form of _industrial unionism_\r\n     has become powerful enough, it will institute an _industrial\r\n     commonwealth_; it will end slavery and oppression forever and\r\n     in its place will be a world of the workers, by the workers,\r\n     and for the workers, a world where there will be no poverty\r\n     and want among those who feed and clothe and house the world; a\r\n     world where the word \"master\" and \"slave\" shall be forgotten;\r\n     a world where peace and happiness shall reign and where\r\n     the children of men shall live as brothers in a world-wide\r\n     _industrial democracy_.\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet published a hideous picture of a lynching in the South.\r\nIn both of these pamphlets the appeal is about the same and may be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\n     The Negro is oppressed. He is subjected to the worst possible\r\n     cruelties and indignities. The working men are oppressed.\r\n     Negroes have left one slavery for another which is shared\r\n     by white workers. Race hatred is played upon by capitalists\r\n     to keep the two races apart and thus thwart their efforts at\r\n     improving their condition. The I.W.W. union will unite all of\r\n     the oppressed of all colors and all languages. One big union\r\n     of defensive brotherhood, not only in America but throughout\r\n     the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MALICIOUS PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nAnti-Negro propaganda is not wholly new in the North, but it has usually\r\nbeen carefully concealed. Recently there have been several conspicuous\r\ninstances of open and organized effort to influence the minds of white\r\npersons against Negroes. The slogans, charges, and incriminations\r\nhave included, with gross exaggeration, not only all of the actual but\r\nall of the fancied and rumored defects of Negro character. Ignorance\r\nand suspicion, fear and prejudice, have been played upon violently. A\r\ngroup of South Side real estate dealers and owners, anxious to preserve\r\nexclusively for whites sections of the city known as Hyde Park and\r\nKenwood, formed themselves into an organization to protect property\r\nvalues on the assumption that the presence of Negroes depreciated real\r\nestate values. Since they did not own or control enough property to be in\r\nthemselves effective, they sought to awaken the white residents to the\r\n\"danger that menaced them.\" Funds were raised, meetings held, a journal\r\nstarted, bills and posters distributed, and many letters circulated. A\r\nbulletin was widely distributed with this heading:\r\n\r\n                           YOUR RIGHTS AND MINE\r\n     A Short Symposium on Current Events as Applied to and Effecting Realty\r\n     Values in Kenwood and Hyde Park\r\n\r\nIt began by disclaiming any desire to foment or foster race antagonism,\r\nbut stated its determination to work insistently and persistently along\r\nlegal lines for the elimination of undesirables of whatever brand or color\r\nwhose residence in this section lowered the value of real estate. The\r\nremainder of the bulletin, however, was devoted to a discussion of the\r\nNegro. A letter to Mayor Thompson from the president of the Association\r\nmentioned the vicious element of Negroes \"haranguing about constitutional\r\nrights,\" aided by the Negro press, claiming social equality, and then\r\nattributed the riot to the scattering of Negroes in white residential\r\nsections. It spoke of a feeling that was rampant because the \"legal rights\r\nof Negroes have been placed above his moral obligation to the white\r\npeople.\" The _Chicago Tribune_ was quoted twice and the Chicago Real\r\nEstate Board once on the desirability of segregation. The _Daily News_\r\nafforded a fourth quotation from an article in which three solutions were\r\nadvanced--amalgamation, deportation, and segregation. As to amalgamation\r\nthe article said: \"Every white man would rather see the nation destroyed\r\nthan adopt that method.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Property Owners' Journal_ became so bitter in its utterances that\r\nthe protests of whites forced its discontinuance. A few selections from\r\nthe _Journal_ picture the character of the campaign:\r\n\r\n     What a reputation for beauty Chicago would secure if visitors\r\n     touring the city would see crowds of idle, insolent Negroes\r\n     lounging on the South Side boulevards and adding beauty to\r\n     the floricultural display in the parks, filling the streets\r\n     with old newspapers and tomato containers and advertising the\r\n     Poro-system for removing the marcelled kinks from Negro hair\r\n     in the windows of the derelict remains of what had once been\r\n     a clean, respectable residence.\r\n\r\n                               THE NEW NEGRO\r\n\r\n     Negroes are boasting, individually and through the colored\r\n     press, that the old order of things for the Negro is changing\r\n     and that a new condition is about to begin. As a result of\r\n     the boastful attitude, the Negro is filled with bold ideas,\r\n     the realization of which means the overturning of their older\r\n     views and conditions of life. The Negro is unwilling to resume\r\n     his status of other years; he is exalting himself with idiotic\r\n     ideas on social equality. Only a few days ago Attorney General\r\n     Palmer informed the Senate of the nation of the Negroes'\r\n     boldest and most impudent ambition, sex equality.\r\n\r\n     From the Negro viewpoint sex equality, according to Mr.\r\n     Palmer, is not seen as the equality of men and women; it is\r\n     the assertion by the Negro of a right to marry any person whom\r\n     he chooses, regardless of color. The dangerous portion of\r\n     their outrageous idea does not consist in the accident that\r\n     some black or white occasionally may forget the dignity of\r\n     their race and intermarry. That has happened before; doubtless\r\n     it will recur many times. Where the trouble lies is in the\r\n     fact that the Department of Justice has observed an organized\r\n     tendency on the part of Negroes to regard themselves in such\r\n     a light as to permit their idea to become a universal ambition\r\n     of the Negro race.\r\n\r\n     As a corollary to their ambition on sex equality, it is not\r\n     strange that they are attempting to force their presence as\r\n     neighbors on the whites. The effrontery and impudence that\r\n     nurses a desire on the part of the Negro to choose a white as\r\n     a marriage mate certainly will not result in making the Negro\r\n     a desirable neighbor. That fact alone is enough to determine\r\n     the property owners of this district to declare to the Negroes\r\n     that they must stay out. As neighbors they have nothing to\r\n     offer. \"They lived for uncounted centuries in Africa on their\r\n     own resources, and never so much as improved the make-up of\r\n     an arrow, coined a new word, or crept an inch nearer to a\r\n     spiritual religion,\" and it is a certainty that their tenure\r\n     of those unfortunate buildings now occupied by them will not\r\n     be improved by a single nail if it is left to the Negro to\r\n     provide and drive the nail.\r\n\r\n     Keep the Negro in his place, amongst his people, and he is\r\n     healthy and loyal. Remove him, or allow \"his newly discovered\r\n     importance to remove him from his proper environment and the\r\n     Negro becomes a nuisance.\" He develops into an overbearing,\r\n     inflated, irascible individual, overburdening his brain to such\r\n     an extent about social equality that he becomes dangerous to\r\n     all with whom he comes in contact; he constitutes a nuisance\r\n     of which the neighborhood is anxious to rid itself. If the new\r\n     Negro desires to display his newly acquired veneer of impudence\r\n     where it will be appreciated we advise that they parade it in\r\n     their own district. Their presence here is intolerable.\r\n\r\n     As stated before, every colored man who moves into Hyde Park\r\n     knows that he is damaging his white neighbor's property.\r\n\r\n     Therefore, he is making war on the white man.\r\n\r\n     Consequently, he is not entitled to any consideration and\r\n     forfeits his right to be employed by the white man.\r\n\r\n     If employers should adopt a rule of refusing to employ Negroes\r\n     who reside in Hyde Park to the damage of the white man's\r\n     property it would soon show good results.\r\n\r\n                     FOOD FOR THOUGHT FOR HYDE-PARKERS\r\n\r\n     Their solid vote is the Negroes' great weapon. They have a\r\n     total vote in Chicago of about 40,000. This total vote is cast\r\n     solid for the candidate who makes the best bargain with them.\r\n     When both our principal political parties are split, and when\r\n     each of them has two or more candidates in the field, this\r\n     solid block of 40,000 becomes a possible power and might be\r\n     able to defeat or elect a candidate.\r\n\r\n     This vote situation is the foundation of the Chicago Negro's\r\n     effrontery and his evil design against the white man's property.\r\n     He feels that he holds the balance of power and that he can\r\n     dictate the policy of any administration that happens to be\r\n     elected by his controlling black vote.\r\n\r\n     He therefore becomes arrogant, insulting, threatening. He\r\n     abuses his rights and liberties and feels that he is perfectly\r\n     safe in doing so for the reason that as he controls this block\r\n     of votes he believes that he can practically dictate to the\r\n     police department, the city administration and the courts.\r\n     Consequently he is bold.\r\n\r\n     Now then, white property owners and voters, this vote situation\r\n     must be corrected. It is time for you to think and ponder.\r\n     Remember this, that this Negro vote power could not exist except\r\n     for the fact that the candidate who caters to it is traveling\r\n     on his belief that the white man will vote the ticket any\r\n     way. The white voter is not supposed to think, nor to indulge\r\n     in any investigations of a candidate to ascertain whether or\r\n     not the candidate is favorable or inimical to his interests.\r\n     No, the white voter is supposed to be a blind ass who has no\r\n     care for his own interests, who does not know or care to know\r\n     of the foul plots against him, who has no knowledge of what\r\n     is going on around him, but who simply does as he is told and\r\n     walks to the polls as in a dream, having eyes and seeing not,\r\n     ears and hearing not, and religiously casts his vote for the\r\n     ticket and against his own interests.\r\n\r\n     Wake up, white voters! Come out of your dream. Open your eyes\r\n     and ears. It is high time that you realize what is going on.\r\n     Hereafter in local affairs affecting your property and home\r\n     interests, there should be only one test of a candidate and\r\n     that one should be, \"Will his election work for the betterment\r\n     of Hyde Park or for its deterioration?\"\r\n\r\n     The Negro should be consistent. As he segregates his vote and\r\n     casts it all together in one block, so he should live together\r\n     all in one block.\r\n\r\nSome of the slogans of the organization were: \"Our neighborhood must\r\ncontinue white\"; \"They shall not pass\"; \"Stay out of Hyde Park\"; \"We\r\nbase our rights on priority, majority and anthropological superiority.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentiment was contagious.[102] Other literature of even more\r\npronounced anti-Negro character followed. An unsigned card was distributed\r\nin large numbers throughout the district during the presidential\r\ncampaign, showing a vicious looking Negro and words of warning for family\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe attempt still further to instill fear and bitterness was manifest\r\nin a pamphlet sent, by whom it is not known, to the wives of prominent\r\nwhite residents of the city and particularly of Hyde Park, entitled _An\r\nAppeal of White Women to American Womanhood_. It was a reprint from an\r\narticle in the _New Times_, which in turn reprinted an appeal from the\r\n_German Women on the Rhine_. Although there could be slight connection\r\nbetween the conduct of colored French colonial troops on the Rhine and\r\nChicago Negroes, its circulation in Hyde Park possibly helped to fan the\r\nflames of race feeling which had already been so deliberately kindled.\r\nThe pamphlet detailed the \"bestial ferocious conduct of Negroes against\r\nGerman women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DEFENSIVE PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nWithin the Negro group there are to be found many defensive programs\r\ndesigned for group protection. They rarely reach the point of organized\r\neffort for the control of opinion. The essence in all appeals is\r\n\"protest,\" which is tacitly understood to be an effective sentiment to\r\ncirculate. The most striking illustrations of this type of propaganda are\r\nthose which follow definite provocations. The appeal of the propaganda\r\nis directed first to Negroes as a means of cementing the group from\r\nwithin, and indirectly to the whole group by way of impressing it with\r\nthe strength of solidified opposition to insults. One example of this\r\ntype will suffice.\r\n\r\nFollowing the bombing of Negro homes and the inauguration of a campaign\r\nof reckless propaganda against Negroes in the interest of exclusive\r\nwhite residence neighborhoods, Negroes organized the \"Protective Circle\r\nof Chicago.\" The object of this organization was to \"oppose segregation,\r\nbombing and the defiance of the Constitution.\" The admitted method of\r\ncombating these objectionable practices was propaganda. The question\r\non which certain white people living in Hyde Park were greatly wrought\r\nup was that of keeping Negroes out of \"white residential districts.\"\r\nNegroes were classed as \"undesirables,\" and the efforts of the whites\r\nin offensive propaganda were aimed at proving it. Fortunately for the\r\nNegroes, an article appeared in a real estate publication, the _Real\r\nEstate News_, presenting with unusual force an aspect of the neighborhood\r\ndispute favorable to the contention of the Negroes. This was seized\r\nupon by the Protective Circle, and the editor consented to elaborate it.\r\nTwenty-five thousand copies were distributed among Negroes and whites,\r\nresidents of the district.\r\n\r\nThe heading \"Solving Chicago's Race Problem,\" coupled with the fact that\r\nthe article had first appeared in a real estate periodical published by\r\nwhites, immediately attracted attention. The subheadings of the article\r\nread: \"South Side Property Owners Warned against Perils of Boycott\r\nand Terrorism Being Promoted by Local 'Protective Associations,'\"\r\n\"Conspiracies Violating Civil Rights Act Bring Danger of Heavy Damages\r\nor Imprisonment,\" \"A Complete Analysis of Chicago's Race Movement Proves\r\nIt to Be Small Factor in Causing Great Changes in Residential Values,\"\r\nand \"How Influence of Stock Yards, Railroads, Auto Industry and City\r\nGrowth Force Big and Sweeping Changes on South Side of Chicago.\" One\r\nparagraph of the article, printed in italics, ran:\r\n\r\n     Any association formed in Chicago for the purpose of, or having\r\n     among its aims, refusal to sell, lease or rent property to\r\n     any citizen of a certain race, is an unlawful association.\r\n     Every act of such an association for advancement of such an\r\n     aim is an act of conspiracy, punishable criminally and civilly\r\n     in the District Court of the United States. And every member\r\n     of such an association is equally guilty with every other\r\n     member. If one member hires a bomber, or a thug who commits\r\n     murder in pursuance of the aims of the association, all in\r\n     the organization may be found guilty of conspiracy to destroy\r\n     property or to commit murder, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAt a mass meeting held by the Protective Circle at which there were\r\n2,000 Negroes present, $1,000 was collected to advance this propaganda.\r\nAs the chairman of the meeting stated:\r\n\r\n     We wanted to get at the responsibility for these bombings and\r\n     intimidations, and we intended to give publicity to the Negro's\r\n     side of the story. Papers will not print the Negro's story.\r\n     We wanted to get this survey of white and colored property\r\n     owned, and whites and Negroes bombed, and send it to every\r\n     white person living in Kenwood, and just as we were about to\r\n     start on our task, there came like a flash out of the sky\r\n     an article by the editor of the _Real Estate News_. It was\r\n     a godsend. We have secured thousands of copies of this paper\r\n     and are buying more as fast as we can get funds. We intend to\r\n     send copies to every white person interested in this question.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nThe inquiries of this Commission into racial sentiments which characterize\r\nthe opinions and behavior of white persons toward Negroes lead us to\r\nthe following conclusions:\r\n\r\nThat in seeking advice and information about Negroes, white persons\r\nalmost without exception fail to select for their informants Negroes\r\nwho are representative and can provide dependable information.\r\n\r\nThat Negroes as a group are often judged by the manners, conduct, and\r\nopinions of servants in families, or other Negroes whose general standing\r\nand training do not qualify them to be spokesmen of the group.\r\n\r\nThat the principal literature regarding Negroes is based upon traditional\r\nopinions and does not always portray accurately the present status of\r\nthe group.\r\n\r\nMost of the current beliefs concerning Negroes are traditional, and\r\nwere acquired during an earlier period when Negroes were considerably\r\nless intelligent and responsible than now. Failure to change these\r\nopinions, in spite of the great progress of the Negro group, increases\r\nmisunderstandings and the difficulties of mutual adjustment.\r\n\r\nThat the common disposition to regard all Negroes as belonging to one\r\nhomogeneous group is as great a mistake as to assume that all white\r\npersons are of the same class and kind.\r\n\r\nThat much of the current literature and pseudo-scientific treatises\r\nconcerning Negroes are responsible for such prevailing misconceptions\r\nas: that Negroes have inferior mentality; that Negroes have inferior\r\nmorality; that Negroes are given to emotionalism; that Negroes have an\r\ninnate tendency to commit crimes, especially sex crimes.\r\n\r\nWe believe that such deviations from recognized standards as have been\r\napparent among Negroes are due to circumstances of position rather than\r\nto distinct racial traits. We urge especially upon white persons to exert\r\ntheir efforts toward discrediting stories and standing beliefs concerning\r\nNegroes which have no basis in fact but which constantly serve to keep\r\nalive a spirit of mutual fear, distrust, and opposition.\r\n\r\nThat much of the literature and scientific treatises concerning Negroes\r\nare responsible for such prevailing misconceptions as that Negroes are\r\ncapable of mental and moral development only to an inferior degree, are\r\ngiven to an uncontrolled emotionalism, and have a distinctive innate\r\ntendency to commit crimes, especially sex crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE CHICAGO RIOT\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn July, 1919, a race riot involving whites and Negroes occurred in\r\nChicago. For some time thoughtful citizens, white and Negro, had sensed\r\nincreasing tension, but, having no local precedent of riot and wholesale\r\nbloodshed, had neither prepared themselves for it nor taken steps to\r\nprevent it. The collecting of arms by members of both races was known\r\nto the authorities, and it was evident that this was in preparation for\r\naggression as well as for self-defense.\r\n\r\nSeveral minor clashes preceded the riot. On July 3, 1917, a white\r\nsaloon-keeper who, according to the coroner's physician, died of heart\r\ntrouble, was incorrectly reported in the press to have been killed by a\r\nNegro. That evening a party of young white men riding in an automobile\r\nfired upon a group of Negroes at Fifty-third and Federal streets. In\r\nJuly and August of the same year recruits from the Great Lakes Naval\r\nTraining Station clashed frequently with Negroes, each side accusing\r\nthe other of being the aggressor.\r\n\r\nGangs of white \"toughs,\" made up largely of the membership of so-called\r\n\"athletic clubs\" from the neighborhood between Roosevelt Road and\r\nSixty-third Street, Wentworth Avenue and the city limits--a district\r\ncontiguous to the neighborhood of the largest Negro settlement--were a\r\nconstant menace to Negroes who traversed sections of the territory going\r\nto and returning from work. The activities of these gangs and \"athletic\r\nclubs\" became bolder in the spring of 1919, and on the night of June\r\n21, five weeks before the riot, two wanton murders of Negroes occurred,\r\nthose of Sanford Harris and Joseph Robinson. Harris returning to his home\r\non Dearborn Street, about 11:30 at night, passed a group of young white\r\nmen. They threatened him and he ran. He had gone but a short distance\r\nwhen one of the group shot him. He died soon afterward. Policemen who\r\ncame on the scene made no arrests, even when the assailant was pointed\r\nout by a white woman witness of the murder. On the same evening Robinson,\r\na Negro laborer, forty-seven years of age, was attacked while returning\r\nfrom work by a gang of white \"roughs\" at Fifty-fifth Street and Princeton\r\nAvenue, apparently without provocation, and stabbed to death.\r\n\r\nNegroes were greatly incensed over these murders, but their leaders,\r\njoined by many friendly whites, tried to allay their fears and counseled\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nAfter the killing of Harris and Robinson notices were conspicuously\r\nposted on the South Side that an effort would be made to \"get all the\r\nniggers on July 4th.\" The notices called for help from sympathizers.\r\nNegroes in turn whispered around the warning to prepare for a riot; and\r\nthey did prepare.\r\n\r\nSince the riot in East St. Louis, July 4, 1917, there had been others\r\nin different parts of the country which evidenced a widespread lack\r\nof restraint in mutual antipathies and suggested further resorts to\r\nlawlessness. Riots and race clashes occurred in Chester, Pennsylvania;\r\nLongview, Texas; Coatesville, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and Norfolk,\r\nVirginia, before the Chicago riot.\r\n\r\nAside from general lawlessness and disastrous riots that preceded the riot\r\nhere discussed, there were other factors which may be mentioned briefly\r\nhere. In Chicago considerable unrest had been occasioned in industry\r\nby increasing competition between white and Negro laborers following a\r\nsudden increase in the Negro population due to the migration of Negroes\r\nfrom the South. This increase developed a housing crisis. The Negroes\r\noverran the hitherto recognized area of Negro residence, and when they\r\ntook houses in adjoining neighborhoods friction ensued. In the two years\r\njust preceding the riot, twenty-seven Negro dwellings were wrecked by\r\nbombs thrown by unidentified persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. STORY OF THE RIOT\r\n\r\nSunday afternoon, July 27, 1919, hundreds of white and Negro bathers\r\ncrowded the lake-front beaches at Twenty-sixth and Twenty-ninth streets.\r\nThis is the eastern boundary of the thickest Negro residence area. At\r\nTwenty-sixth Street Negroes were in great majority; at Twenty-ninth\r\nStreet there were more whites. An imaginary line in the water separating\r\nthe two beaches had been generally observed by the two races. Under the\r\nprevailing relations, aided by wild rumors and reports, this line served\r\nvirtually as a challenge to either side to cross it. Four Negroes who\r\nattempted to enter the water from the \"white\" side were driven away by\r\nthe whites. They returned with more Negroes, and there followed a series\r\nof attacks with stones, first one side gaining the advantage, then the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nEugene Williams, a Negro boy of seventeen, entered the water from the\r\nside used by Negroes and drifted across the line supported by a railroad\r\ntie. He was observed by the crowd on the beach and promptly became\r\na target for stones. He suddenly released the tie, went down and was\r\ndrowned. Guilt was immediately placed on Stauber, a young white man, by\r\nNegro witnesses who declared that he threw the fatal stone.[103]\r\n\r\nWhite and Negro men dived for the boy without result. Negroes demanded\r\nthat the policeman present arrest Stauber. He refused; and at this\r\ncrucial moment arrested a Negro on a white man's complaint. Negroes then\r\nattacked the officer. These two facts, the drowning and the refusal of\r\nthe policeman to arrest Stauber, together marked the beginning of the\r\nriot.\r\n\r\nTwo hours after the drowning, a Negro, James Crawford, fired into a group\r\nof officers summoned by the policeman at the beach and was killed by a\r\nNegro policeman. Reports and rumors circulated rapidly, and new crowds\r\nbegan to gather. Five white men were injured in clashes near the beach. As\r\ndarkness came Negroes in white districts to the west suffered severely.\r\nBetween 9:00 P.M. and 3:00 A.M. twenty-seven Negroes were beaten, seven\r\nstabbed, and four shot. Monday morning was quiet, and Negroes went to\r\nwork as usual.\r\n\r\nReturning from work in the afternoon many Negroes were attacked by white\r\nruffians. Street-car routes, especially at transfer points, were the\r\ncenters of lawlessness. Trolleys were pulled from the wires, and Negro\r\npassengers were dragged into the street, beaten, stabbed, and shot.\r\nThe police were powerless to cope with these numerous assaults. During\r\nMonday, four Negro men and one white assailant were killed, and thirty\r\nNegroes were severely beaten in street-car clashes. Four white men were\r\nkilled, six stabbed, five shot, and nine severely beaten. It was rumored\r\nthat the white occupants of the Angelus Building at Thirty-fifth Street\r\nand Wabash Avenue had shot a Negro. Negroes gathered about the building.\r\nThe white tenants sought police protection, and one hundred policemen,\r\nmounted and on foot, responded. In a clash with the mob the police killed\r\nfour Negroes and injured many.\r\n\r\nRaids into the Negro residence area then began. Automobiles sped through\r\nthe streets, the occupants shooting at random. Negroes retaliated by\r\n\"sniping\" from ambush. At midnight surface and elevated car service was\r\ndiscontinued because of a strike for wage increases, and thousands of\r\nemployees were cut off from work.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 29, Negro men en route on foot to their jobs through\r\nhostile territory were killed. White soldiers and sailors in uniform,\r\naided by civilians, raided the \"Loop\" business section, killing two\r\nNegroes and beating and robbing several others. Negroes living among\r\nwhite, neighbors in Englewood, far to the south, were driven from their\r\nhomes, their household goods were stolen, and their houses were burned\r\nor wrecked. On the West Side an Italian mob, excited by a false rumor\r\nthat an Italian girl had been shot by a Negro, killed Joseph Lovings,\r\na Negro.\r\n\r\nWednesday night at 10:30 Mayor Thompson yielded to pressure and asked\r\nthe help of the three regiments of militia which had been stationed in\r\nnearby armories during the most severe rioting, awaiting the call. They\r\nimmediately took up positions throughout the South Side. A rainfall\r\nWednesday night and Thursday kept many people in their homes, and by\r\nFriday the rioting had abated. On Saturday incendiary fires burned\r\nforty-nine houses in the immigrant neighborhood west of the Stock Yards.\r\nNine hundred and forty-eight people, mostly Lithuanians, were made\r\nhomeless, and the property loss was about $250,000. Responsibility for\r\nthe fires was never fixed.\r\n\r\nThe total casualties of this reign of terror were thirty-eight\r\ndeaths--fifteen white, twenty-three Negro--and 537 people injured.\r\nForty-one per cent of the reported clashes occurred in the white\r\nneighborhood near the Stock Yards between the south branch of the Chicago\r\nRiver and Fifty-fifth Street, Wentworth Avenue and the city limits, and\r\n34 per cent in the \"Black Belt\" between Twenty-second and Thirty-ninth\r\nstreets, Wentworth Avenue and Lake Michigan. Others were scattered.\r\n\r\nResponsibility for many attacks was definitely placed by many witnesses\r\nupon the \"athletic clubs,\" including \"Ragen's Colts,\" the \"Hamburgers,\"\r\n\"Aylwards,\" \"Our Flag,\" the \"Standard,\" the \"Sparklers,\" and several\r\nothers. The mobs were made up for the most part of boys between fifteen\r\nand twenty-two. Older persons participated, but the youth of the rioters\r\nwas conspicuous in every clash. Little children witnessed the brutalities\r\nand frequently pointed out the injured when the police arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. RUMORS AND THE RIOT\r\n\r\nWild rumors were in circulation by word of mouth and in the press\r\nthroughout the riot and provoked many clashes. These included stories\r\nof atrocities committed by one race against the other. Reports of the\r\nnumbers of white and Negro dead tended to produce a feeling that the\r\nscore must be kept even. Newspaper reports, for example, showed 6 per\r\ncent more whites injured than Negroes. As a matter of fact there were\r\n28 per cent more Negroes injured than whites. The _Chicago Tribune_ on\r\nJuly 29 reported twenty persons killed, of whom thirteen were white and\r\nseven colored. The true figures were exactly the opposite.\r\n\r\nAmong the rumors provoking fear were numerous references to the arming\r\nof Negroes. In the _Daily News_ of July 30, for example, appeared the\r\nsubheadline: \"Alderman Jos. McDonough tells how he was shot at on South\r\nSide visit. Says enough ammunition in section to last for years of\r\nguerrilla warfare.\" In the article following, the reference to ammunition\r\nwas repeated but not elaborated or explained.\r\n\r\nThe alderman was quoted as saying that the mayor contemplated opening\r\nup Thirty-fifth and Forty-seventh streets in order that colored people\r\nmight get to their work. He thought this would be most unwise for, he\r\nstated, \"They are armed and white people are not. We must defend ourselves\r\nif the city authorities won't protect us.\" Continuing his story, he\r\ndescribed bombs going off: \"I saw white men and women running through\r\nthe streets dragging children by the hands and carrying babies in their\r\narms. Frightened white men told me the police captains had just rushed\r\nthrough the district crying, 'For God's sake, arm; they are coming; we\r\ncannot hold them.'\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not the alderman was correctly quoted, the effect of such\r\nstatements on the public was the same. There is no record in any of the\r\nriot testimony in the coroner's office or state's attorney's office of\r\nany bombs going off during the riot, nor of police captains warning the\r\nwhite people to arm, nor of any fear by whites of a Negro invasion. In\r\nthe Berger Odman case before a coroner's jury there was a statement to\r\nthe effect that a sergeant of police warned the Negroes of Ogden Park to\r\narm and to shoot at the feet of rioters if they attempted to invade the\r\nfew blocks marked off for Negroes by the police. Negroes were warned,\r\nnot whites.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. CONDUCT OF THE POLICE\r\n\r\nChief of Police John J. Garrity, in explaining the inability of the\r\npolice to curb the rioters, said that there was not a sufficient force\r\nto police one-third of the city. Aside from this, Negroes distrusted\r\nthe white police officers, and it was implied by the chief and stated\r\nby State's Attorney Hoyne, that many of the police were \"grossly unfair\r\nin making arrests.\" There were instances of actual police participation\r\nin the rioting as well as neglect of duty. Of 229 persons arrested and\r\naccused of various criminal activities during the riot, 154 were Negroes\r\nand seventy-five were whites. Of those indicted, eighty-one were Negroes\r\nand forty-seven were whites. Although this, on its face, would indicate\r\ngreat riot activity on the part of Negroes, further reports of clashes\r\nshow that of 520 persons injured, 342 were Negroes and 178 were whites.\r\nThe fact that twice as many Negroes appeared as defendants and twice as\r\nmany Negroes as whites were injured, leads to the conclusion that whites\r\nwere not apprehended as readily as Negroes.\r\n\r\nMany of the depredations outside the \"Black Belt\" were encouraged by the\r\nabsence of policemen. Out of a force of 3,000 police, 2,800 were massed\r\nin the \"Black Belt\" during the height of the rioting. In the \"Loop\"\r\ndistrict, where two Negroes were killed and several others wounded, there\r\nwere only three policemen and one sergeant. The Stock Yards district,\r\nwhere the greatest number of injuries occurred, was also weakly protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE MILITIA\r\n\r\nAlthough Governor Lowden had ordered the militia into the city promptly\r\nand they were on hand on the second day of the rioting, their services\r\nwere not requested by the mayor and chief of police until the evening\r\nof the fourth day. The reason expressed by the chief for this delay\r\nwas a belief that inexperienced militiamen would add to the deaths\r\nand disorder. But the troops, when called, proved to be clearly of\r\nhigh character, and their discipline was good, not a case of breach of\r\ndiscipline being reported during their occupation. They were distributed\r\nmore proportionately through all the riotous areas than the police and,\r\nalthough they reported some hostility from members of \"athletic clubs,\"\r\nthe rioting soon ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. RESTORATION OF ORDER\r\n\r\nThroughout the rioting various social organizations and many citizens\r\nwere at work trying to hold hostilities in check and to restore order.\r\nThe Chicago Urban League, Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A., American Red Cross,\r\nand various other social organizations and the churches of the Negro\r\ncommunity gave attention to caring for stranded Negroes, advising them\r\nof dangers, keeping them off the streets and, in such ways as were\r\npossible, co-operating with the police. The packing companies took their\r\npay to Negro employees, and various banks made loans. Local newspapers in\r\ntheir editorial columns insistently condemned the disorder and counseled\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. THE AFTERMATH\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-eight persons killed in the riot:\r\n\r\nFifteen met death at the hands of mobs. Coroner's juries recommended\r\nthat the members of the unknown mobs be apprehended. They were never\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nSix were killed in circumstances fixing no criminal responsibility: three\r\nwhite men were killed by Negroes in self-defense, and three Negroes were\r\nshot by policemen in the discharge of their duty.\r\n\r\nFour Negroes were killed in the Angelus riot. The coroner made no\r\nrecommendations, and the cases were not carried farther.\r\n\r\nFour cases, two Negro and two white, resulted in recommendations from\r\ncoroner's juries for further investigation of certain persons. Sufficient\r\nevidence was lacking for indictments against them.\r\n\r\nNine cases led to indictments. Of this number four cases resulted in\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nThus in only four cases of death was criminal responsibility fixed and\r\npunishment meted out.\r\n\r\nIndictments and convictions, divided according to the race of the persons\r\ncriminally involved, were as follows:\r\n\r\n     ================================================\r\n                 |     NEGRO       |     WHITE\r\n                 +-------+---------+-------+---------\r\n                 | Cases | Persons | Cases | Persons\r\n     ------------+-------+---------+-------+---------\r\n     Indictments |     6 |      17 |     3 |       4\r\n     Convictions |     2 |       3 |     2 |       2\r\n     ------------+-------+---------+-------+---------\r\n\r\nDespite the community's failure to deal firmly with those who disturbed\r\nits peace and contributed to the reign of lawlessness that shamed Chicago\r\nbefore the world, there is evidence that the riot aroused many citizens\r\nof both races to a quickened sense of the suffering and disgrace which\r\nhad come and might again come to the city, and developed a determination\r\nto prevent a recurrence of so disastrous an outbreak of race hatred.\r\nThis was manifest on at least three occasions in 1920 when, confronted\r\nsuddenly with events out of which serious riots might easily have grown,\r\npeople of both races acted with such courage and promptness as to end\r\nthe trouble early. One of these was the murder of two innocent white\r\nmen and the wounding of a Negro policeman by a band of Negro fanatics\r\nwho styled themselves \"Abyssinians\"; another was the killing of a white\r\nman by a Negro whom he had attacked while returning from work; and still\r\nanother was the riotous attacks of sailors from the Great Lakes Naval\r\nTraining Station on Negroes in Waukegan, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THE RIOT\r\n\r\nThis study of the facts of the riot of 1919, the events as they happened\r\nhour by hour, the neighborhoods involved, the movements of mobs, the\r\npart played by rumors, and the handling of the emergency by the various\r\nauthorities, shows certain outstanding features which may be listed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_a_) The riot violence was not continuous hour by hour, but was\r\nintermittent.\r\n\r\n_b_) The greatest number of injuries occurred in the district west and\r\ninclusive of Wentworth Avenue, and south of the south branch of the\r\nChicago River to Fifty-fifth Street, or in the Stock Yards district. The\r\nnext greatest number occurred in the so-called \"Black Belt\": Twenty-second\r\nto Thirty-ninth streets, inclusive, and Wentworth Avenue to the lake,\r\nexclusive of Wentworth Avenue; Thirty-ninth to Fifty-fifth streets,\r\ninclusive, and Clark Street to Michigan Avenue, exclusive of Michigan\r\nAvenue.\r\n\r\n_c_) Organized raids occurred only after a period of sporadic clashes\r\nand spontaneous mob outbreaks.\r\n\r\n_d_) Main thoroughfares witnessed 76 per cent of the injuries on the\r\nSouth Side. The streets which suffered most severely were State, Halsted,\r\nThirty-first, Thirty-fifth, and Forty-seventh. Transfer corners were\r\nalways centers of disturbances.\r\n\r\n_e_) Most of the rioting occurred after work hours among idle crowds on\r\nthe streets. This was particularly true after the street-car strike began.\r\n\r\n_f_) Gangs, particularly of young whites, formed definite nuclei for\r\ncrowd and mob formation. \"Athletic clubs\" supplied the leaders of many\r\ngangs.\r\n\r\n_g_) Crowds and mobs engaged in rioting were generally composed of a\r\nsmall nucleus of leaders and an acquiescing mass of spectators. The\r\nleaders were mostly young men, usually between the ages of sixteen\r\nand twenty-one. Dispersal was most effectively accomplished by sudden,\r\nunexpected gun fire.\r\n\r\n_h_) Rumor kept the crowds in an excited, potential mob state. The press\r\nwas responsible for giving wide dissemination to much of the inflammatory\r\nmatter in spoken rumors, though editorials calculated to allay race\r\nhatred and help the forces of order were factors in the restoration of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n_i_) The police lacked sufficient forces for handling the riot; they were\r\nhampered by the Negroes' distrust of them; routing orders and records\r\nwere not handled with proper care; certain officers were undoubtedly\r\nunsuited to police or riot duty.\r\n\r\n_j_) The militiamen employed in this riot were of an unusually high type.\r\nThis unquestionably accounts for the confidence placed in them by both\r\nraces. Riot training, definite orders, and good staff work contributed\r\nto their efficiency.\r\n\r\n_k_) There was a lack of energetic co-operation between the police\r\ndepartment and the state's attorney's office in the discovery and\r\nconviction of rioters.\r\n\r\nThe riot was merely a symptom of serious and profound disorders lying\r\nbeneath the surface of race relations in Chicago. The study of the riot,\r\ntherefore, as to its interlocking provocations and causes, required a\r\nstudy of general race relations that made possible so serious and sudden\r\nan outbreak. Thus to understand the riot and guard against another,\r\nthe Commission probed systematically into the principal phases of race\r\ncontact and sought accurate information on matters which in the past\r\nhave been influenced by dangerous speculation; and on the basis of its\r\ndiscoveries certain suggestions to the community are made.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MIGRATION OF NEGROES FROM THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nDuring the period 1916-18 approximately 500,000 Negroes moved from\r\nsouthern to northern states. Some cities of the North received increases\r\nin Negro population of 10 per cent to 300 per cent. The Negro population\r\nof Gary, Indiana, increased from 383 in 1910 to 5,299 in 1920, an increase\r\nof 1,283 per cent.\r\n\r\nChicago was in direct line for migrants from the South, especially\r\nalong the Mississippi Valley, and received approximately 65,000, who\r\nconstituted a large proportion of the increase of 148.5 per cent in\r\nits Negro population in the last decade. These migrants definitely\r\naccentuated existing problems of race contact and brought new problems\r\nof adjustment and assimilation. Southern Negroes with southern manners,\r\nhabits, and traditions, and mostly from rural districts, became part of\r\na northern urban community. Knowledge of the causes of this movement of\r\nNegroes will make easier an understanding of the difficulties following\r\nit. These causes were economic as well as sentimental.\r\n\r\nThe South was paying to Negroes wages which varied from 75 cents a day\r\non a farm to $1.75 a day in certain city jobs. For two seasons the boll\r\nweevil, a destructive pest, had been making heavy ravages upon the cotton\r\ncrops, ruining thousands of farms and throwing out of employment many\r\nthousands of Negro workers. Lack of capital to carry labor through a\r\nperiod of poor crops and over the normal intervals between planting and\r\nharvesting largely increased Negro unemployment. Unsatisfactory living\r\nconditions, on plantations and in segregated quarters of southern cities,\r\nstimulated unrest. School facilities for Negro children, described as\r\nlamentably poor even by southerners, increased dissatisfaction with\r\nconditions in the South. The Negro illiteracy in fifteen southern\r\nstates was 33.3 per cent as compared with 7.7 per cent for whites. The\r\nappropriations for teachers in the schools of these states on a per\r\ncapita basis was $10.32 for each white child, and $2.89 for each Negro\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the North was for the first time on a large scale\r\nopening up opportunities for Negroes to earn a livelihood. The cessation\r\nof immigration due to the war and the drawing of workers into military\r\nservice created a great demand for labor; and the opening of new\r\nindustries and the extension of old ones to meet the demands of the war\r\nprovided still greater opportunities. At the same time, these industries\r\nwere paying laborers from $3 to $8 per day, and offering shorter hours\r\nand the opportunity for overtime work and bonuses. The North also offered\r\nliving accommodations which, although below standard for city dwellers,\r\nwere a vast improvement over most of the plantation cabins and frail\r\nframe dwellings of the South. There are no segregated schools in the\r\nNorth, and Negro children are offered identical school privileges with\r\nwhite children.\r\n\r\nOther causes of the migration, as stated by the migrants and otherwise\r\nconfirmed, were: lack of protection from mob violence, injustice in the\r\ncourts, inferior transportation facilities, deprivation of the right to\r\nvote, \"rough-handed and unfair competition of 'poor whites,'\" \"persecution\r\nby petty officers of the law,\" and \"persecution by the press.\"\r\n\r\nBetween 1895 and 1918, 2,881 Negroes were lynched in the United States,\r\nand more than 85 per cent of these lynchings occurred in the South. The\r\n_Atlanta Constitution_ declared that the heaviest migration of Negroes\r\nwas from those counties in which there had been the worst outbreaks\r\nagainst Negroes.\r\n\r\n_How the migration began._--The migration began early in 1916.\r\nHard-pressed industries in the East, principally in Pennsylvania, imported\r\nNegroes from Georgia and Florida. During July of that year, 13,000 were\r\ncarried to Pennsylvania by one railroad company alone.[104] They wrote\r\nback for their families and friends. Reports of high wages and good\r\ntreatment, aided by the hysteria of a mass movement, accomplished the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe migration was first noted in Chicago in 1917. It had been rumored\r\nin the South that the Stock Yards needed 50,000 men; the city had\r\nbeen regarded by Negroes as a future home since the World's Columbian\r\nExposition in 1893; it was the great city of mail-order houses, the home\r\nof the _Chicago Defender_, a widely circulated Negro newspaper, the \"end\r\nof the railroad line,\" and the \"top of the world\" for Negroes. Negro\r\nnewspapers gave up their columns to migration news and urged southern\r\nNegroes to go North. The movement soon became a mass movement; with\r\nstandards, songs, and watchwords the migrants began arriving in the city\r\nfaster than they could be absorbed into the population.\r\n\r\n_The arrival in Chicago._--Prior to the migration, the majority of\r\nNegroes in Chicago lived in a fairly limited area on the South Side,\r\nprincipally between Twenty-second and Thirty-ninth streets, Wentworth\r\nAvenue and State Street, and in scattered groups east of State Street\r\nto Cottage Grove Avenue. This area adjoined the old vice area, and many\r\nhouses of the vicinity had been abandoned by older Chicago Negroes.\r\nShortly after the migrants began to arrive, practically all available\r\nhouses had been taken and filled to overcrowding. On a single day the\r\nChicago Urban League found 664 Negro applicants for houses with only\r\nfifty-five dwellings actually available for use by Negroes. At the same\r\ntime rents for Negroes were increased by from 5 to 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nMeeting actual conditions of life in Chicago brought both exaltation and\r\ndisillusionment to the migrants. These were reflected in the schools,\r\nin public amusement places, in industry, and in the street cars. The\r\nChicago Urban League and the various Negro churches and newspapers\r\nassumed the task of making the newcomers \"city folk.\" The difficulty of\r\nadjustment showed itself in the great differences in habits of life and\r\nemployment. Craftsmen had to relearn their trades when thrown amid the\r\nhighly specialized processes of northern industries; domestic servants\r\nwent into industry; professional men had to re-establish themselves in\r\na new community.\r\n\r\nMany Negroes sold their homes in the South and brought their furniture\r\nwith them. Reinvesting in property frequently meant a loss; the furniture\r\nbrought was often found to be unsuited to the tiny apartments or the\r\nlarge abandoned dwellings that they were able to rent or buy.\r\n\r\nChange of residence carried with it in many cases change of status.\r\nThe \"leader\" in a small southern community when he came to Chicago was\r\nimmediately absorbed into the great, struggling mass of unnoticed workers.\r\nSchool teachers, male and female, whose positions in the South held\r\ncommendable prestige, had to go to work in factories and plants because\r\nthe disparity in educational standards would not permit a continuation\r\nof their profession in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe migrants visited by the Commission investigators, however, for the\r\nmost part gave evidence of satisfaction with their change of home, and\r\nwere pleased with the opportunity of voting, of sending their children\r\nto schools, and of higher wages, and with the privilege of participation\r\nin community life. Others felt the pressure of high rents and bad living\r\naccommodations and complained against certain discriminations.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, however, that few Negroes have returned to the South, even\r\nin response to insistent invitations and offers of free transportation\r\nand better home conditions made by southern states that were left badly\r\nin need of laborers as a result of the migration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE NEGRO POPULATION OF CHICAGO\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DISTRIBUTION AND DENSITY\r\n\r\nThe Negro population of Chicago, as reported by the Federal Bureau of the\r\nCensus, was 44,103 in 1910, and 109,594 in 1920. The increase during the\r\ndecade was, therefore, 65,491, or 148.5 per cent. Negroes constituted\r\n2 per cent of the city's total population in 1910 and 4.1 per cent in\r\n1920. The increase in the white population during the decade was 450,047,\r\nor 21 per cent, bringing the number up to 2,589,104 in 1920. Counting\r\n3,007 Chinese, Japanese, and Indians of whom there were 2,123 in 1910,\r\nChicago's total population in 1920 was 2,701,705.\r\n\r\nThis growth of the Negro population did not bring into existence any new\r\nlarge colonies of Negroes, but merely expanded and increased the density\r\nof areas in which they already lived. The areas of Negro residence are\r\nlisted under designations arbitrarily given for convenient reference.[105]\r\n\r\n     1920\r\n\r\n     SOUTH SIDE\r\n     Roosevelt Road--Fifty-fifth St.; Wentworth Ave.--Cottage Grove Ave.\r\n     Population: total, 376,171; Negro, 92,901.\r\n\r\n     _Woodlawn_\r\n     Sixty-first St.--Sixty-seventh St.; Eberhart Ave.--Grand Blvd.\r\n     Population: total, 8,861; Negro, 1,235.\r\n\r\n     _Lake Park Avenue Area_\r\n     Fifty-third St.--Fifty-seventh St.; Harper Ave.--Lake Park Ave.\r\n     Population: Negro, 238.\r\n\r\n     _Ogden Park Area_\r\n     Fifty-ninth St.--Sixty-third St.; Halsted St.--Loomis Blvd.\r\n     Population: total, 38,893; Negro, 1,859.\r\n\r\n     NORTH SIDE\r\n     North Ave.--Chicago Ave.; State St.--Larrabee St.\r\n     Population: Negro, 1,050.\r\n\r\n     _Ravenswood_\r\n     Lawrence Ave.--Montrose Ave.; Sheridan Road--Ashland Ave.\r\n     Population: Negro, 175.\r\n\r\n     WEST SIDE\r\n     Austin Ave.--Washington Ave.; Morgan St.--California Ave.\r\n     Population: Negro, 8,363.\r\n\r\n     MORGAN PARK AREA\r\n     107th St.--115th St.; Loomis St.--Vincennes Ave.\r\n     Population: Negro, 695.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. NEIGHBORHOODS OF NEGRO RESIDENCE\r\n\r\n_The South Side._--While the main colony of Chicago's Negro population\r\nis located in a central part of the South Side, Negroes are to be found\r\nin several parts of the city, ranging from less than 1 per cent to more\r\nthan 95 per cent in proportion to the total population. In some of these\r\nneighborhoods whites and Negroes have become adjusted to one another; in\r\nothers they have not. One of these adjusted areas is the so-called \"Black\r\nBelt.\" Because 90 per cent of the Negroes of Chicago live there, it is\r\nusually assumed that the area is 90 per cent Negro. The fact is very\r\ndifferent. The most densely populated section of the South Side area,\r\nbetween Roosevelt Road and Thirty-ninth Street, Wentworth Avenue and Lake\r\nMichigan, has a population of 54,906 Negroes and 42,797 whites. There\r\nhas been no noticeable friction in this area; and even during the riot\r\nfew whites living or engaged in business there were molested by Negroes.\r\nMost of the whites killed or injured there came from other sections of\r\nthe city. The many large apartment houses and family hotels occupied\r\nby whites are apparently little affected by the presence about them of\r\nmany Negroes. Relations in Woodlawn, where the Negro increase has been\r\nrelatively large, are for the most part friendly. No clashes have been\r\nreported except in the one instance of a group of white boys who threw\r\nstones at a building in which they saw Negroes. When they were arrested\r\nit developed that they had come from another neighborhood. Following\r\nthe stirring up and organization of anti-Negro sentiment in Hyde Park,\r\nan attempt was made to organize white Woodlawn property owners against\r\nthe \"invasion\" of the district by Negroes. This organization was not a\r\nvery great success. There have been no bombings in this district, and\r\nno concerted opposition to the presence of Negroes as neighbors. Long,\r\namicable residence together and the good character of the Negroes as\r\nwell as the whites are probably important reasons for the absence of\r\nfriction. And it also should be said that in the Woodlawn district the\r\nproportion of Negroes is so small that there has been no occasion for\r\nmuch controversy over an alleged depreciation of property values on\r\naccount of Negro occupancy.\r\n\r\n_The West Side._--On the West Side there has been a settlement of\r\nNegroes for many years. Houses are cheaper there than on the South Side;\r\nand although the general level of ordinary workingmen's homes compares\r\nfavorably with that on the South Side, there are few abandoned residences\r\nformerly occupied by wealthy persons now available for Negroes. There has\r\nbeen little friction within this area, in which 9,221 whites and 6,520\r\nNegroes live. West Side Negroes, laborers for the most part, are generally\r\nhome-loving, hard-working people, desirous of improving conditions for\r\ntheir children. Older settlers among them have been able to make their\r\nadjustments without great difficulty, meeting with no serious antagonism\r\nfrom white neighbors.\r\n\r\n_The North Side._--On the North Side, Negroes live among foreign whites\r\nand near a residential area of wealthy Chicagoans. The appearance of\r\nthe first Negro residents there occasioned little notice or objection.\r\nThey were for the most part house servants living near their work.\r\n\r\nThis neighborhood has experienced several complete changes in population.\r\nIt was first occupied by Irish, then by Swedes, then by Italians, who\r\nare the present neighbors of Negroes. Friendly relations exist between\r\nthe Sicilians, who predominate, and their Negro neighbors. Some Negroes\r\nlive harmoniously in the same tenements with Sicilians. Their children\r\nplay together, and some of the Negro children have learned Sicilian\r\nphrases so that they are able to deal with the Sicilian shopkeepers.\r\nElsewhere on the North Side the feeling between Italians and Negroes is\r\nnot so cordial.\r\n\r\n_Non-adjusted neighborhoods._--In other sections the failure of Negro\r\nand white neighbors to adjust themselves mutually has produced the most\r\nserious phases of the Negro housing problem. A general housing shortage\r\nmay be relieved by the opening of new neighborhoods or the availability\r\nof houses in various parts of the city, but for Negroes there is less\r\nopportunity for thus relieving the housing shortage because of the\r\nhostility of many white neighborhoods to the presence of Negroes.\r\n\r\nWhite residents immediately south of the old West Side Negro residence\r\narea objected to the moving in of Negroes, sending numerous threatening\r\nletters to the newcomers and otherwise annoying them. In certain sections\r\nof the North Side, Negro residents have been molested. On one occasion\r\nshots were fired at their homes, and at other times warning signs with\r\npictures of skulls, crossbones, and coffins were posted. In the Lake\r\nPark Avenue area on the South Side, Negroes are limited to a few blocks,\r\nare not permitted to buy, and are discriminated against in practically\r\nall restaurants and amusement places.\r\n\r\nWest of Wentworth Avenue, adjoining the South Side Negro residence area,\r\nfew Negroes live. The residents here are largely Irish working people and\r\ndistinctly hostile to Negroes, even to those merely passing through the\r\nneighborhood. This area has many organized gangs and \"athletic clubs,\"\r\nand its racial antagonisms appear to be traditional.\r\n\r\nIn Park Manor and Wakeford, between Sixty-ninth and Seventy-ninth\r\nstreets, Cottage Grove and Indiana avenues, excitement was created in\r\na new white settlement by an advertisement in a local paper addressed\r\nto Negroes offering them houses there. The name of a white real estate\r\ndealer living there was given. A demonstration followed, meetings were\r\nheld, and the real estate man was asked to explain. He asserted, and\r\nit seems to have been the case, that the advertisement was the \"spite\r\nwork\" of an enemy.\r\n\r\nKenwood and Hyde Park: The neighborhood between Thirty-ninth and\r\nFifty-ninth streets, State Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, just south\r\nof the Negro residence area, has been termed a \"contested neighborhood,\"\r\nbecause of the recent influx of Negroes. The \"Black Belt\" was already\r\novercrowded, and its occupants were seeking relief from deteriorated and\r\ninsufficient housing. The coming of thousands of Negroes from the South\r\nmade it overflow. With Lake Michigan flanking the east, encroaching\r\nindustry the north, and overcrowded, hostile neighborhoods the west,\r\nthe overflow inevitably went south into the west portion of Hyde Park\r\nand Kenwood. Scattered through the South Side were numerous houses\r\nand apartments that had been vacant for many years; and sales were\r\ngladly made to the Negroes, many of the recent southern migrants having\r\nconsiderable funds. In 1919, of the 3,300 owners of property in the region\r\nembracing parts of Kenwood and Hyde Park and adjacent territory, 1,000\r\nwere Negroes. Already a popular agitation against the Negroes had been\r\nbegun by real estate men who formed the Kenwood and Hyde Park Property\r\nOwners' Association. They increased and organized the prejudice against\r\nthe Negroes in a campaign \"to make Hyde Park white.\" They held meetings,\r\npublished a weekly newspaper, and called upon property owners and other\r\nreal estate dealers to pledge themselves against renting or selling to\r\nNegroes. In carrying out their program, they resorted to vilification,\r\nridicule, and disparagement of Negroes, accusing them of destroying\r\nproperty values and robbing white people of their homes.\r\n\r\n_Outlying neighborhoods._--Few outlying places welcome Negroes as\r\nresidents. Morgan Park, however, has offered homes for Negroes, and the\r\nNegro population there has increased from 126 in 1910 to 695 in 1920. They\r\nlive for the most part on one side of the town near their own churches;\r\nthey own their homes and keep them attractive. School accommodations\r\nare poor, many children leaving school early for that reason.\r\n\r\nRobbins, another suburb, is entirely Negro, having a Negro mayor. The\r\ntown is difficult to reach, unattractive, and uninviting. About 400\r\nhard-working Negroes occupying seventy houses are trying to develop\r\na town against the handicaps of lack of capital, swampy lands, and\r\ninaccessibility.\r\n\r\n_Depreciation of property._--One of the strongest influences in creating\r\nand fostering race antagonism in Chicago is the general belief among\r\nwhites that the presence of Negroes in a neighborhood inevitably and\r\nalone depreciates the market value of real estate, and this belief is\r\ncommonly accepted as a valid reason for unfriendliness toward Negroes\r\nas individuals and as a race. Therefore the Commission felt that it was\r\nimportant to learn what basis there is for this belief.\r\n\r\nThe principal influence of Negroes upon property values in a neighborhood\r\nis psychological, due to the deep-seated and general prejudice of whites\r\nagainst Negroes, which begets and sustains the belief that Negroes\r\ndestroy property values wherever they go. The facts as ascertained by\r\nthe Commission show that Negro occupancy in a neighborhood is more often\r\ndue to a prior depreciation of the property there than the depreciation\r\nis due to Negro occupancy; and that it is unfair to place the entire\r\nresponsibility for loss of property values in a neighborhood upon Negro\r\noccupancy. In other sections of the city, where there are no Negroes,\r\ndepreciation of property values has been produced by contacts between\r\npopulations differing in race, religion, or social standards. Race\r\nprejudice produces the present conditions of social injustice toward\r\nthe Negro, and uses the depreciation of property which it causes, as a\r\nnew ground for such racial prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn virtually every neighborhood in Chicago where Negroes now live they\r\nwere preceded by two or more distinct groups of occupants, and an earlier\r\nand often long-continued depreciation of property values is one of the\r\nexplanations of their presence. This depreciation of values has come\r\nfrom several causes, such as natural physical deterioration, vacation\r\nof old and large houses through the death of their original occupants\r\nor their removal to new neighborhoods, or the encroachments of vice, or\r\nbusiness, or factories, and the like. In this way Negroes have found an\r\nopportunity to rent or buy at figures that were comparatively low and\r\nwithin their limited means.\r\n\r\nThe extension of Negro occupancy into the district between State Street\r\nand Lake Michigan and Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth streets followed\r\nsuch an earlier depreciation; and later, similar conditions had similar\r\nconsequences in the district between State Street and Cottage Grove\r\nAvenue and Thirty-ninth and Sixty-third streets, where there has been\r\nthe most active opposition to the Negro influx.\r\n\r\nIn the first named of these two districts there are now about 20 per\r\ncent more Negroes than whites. During the eighties and nineties this\r\narea embraced the most fashionable residence district in Chicago, and\r\nalmost the entire Negro population lived in the adjoining area on the\r\nwest--from State Street to Wentworth Avenue and north of Thirty-fifth\r\nStreet. When the fashionable people of this district began to move to\r\nthe North Side, the deserted section began to depreciate, and costly\r\nhouses recently occupied by wealthy owners were thrown upon the market\r\nand began to pass through the hands of real estate dealers and into the\r\npossession of people belonging to a different social class. Physical\r\ndeterioration also played its part. Between 1900 and 1910, when the\r\nfirst Negroes moved into Wabash Avenue--one street nearer to the old\r\nfashionable district--the houses were at least twenty years old and many\r\nof them much older. Real estate men estimate the natural depreciation of\r\nsuch buildings at from 2 to 2½ per cent per year; so that in many cases\r\nproperty once exclusive and of a high class had depreciated at least 50\r\nper cent before there was any prospect of Negro occupancy.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the old vice area west of State Street and northwest of this\r\nexclusive area was broken up. The inmates, numbering at that time more\r\nthan 2,000, moved into the nearest large houses available where they could\r\nply their trade clandestinely. They could afford high rents, and owners\r\nand agents profited accordingly. Cabarets, cafés, and saloons sought the\r\nside streets, and buffet flats were opened. Raids and prosecutions called\r\nattention to the changed character of the neighborhood, and property\r\nvalues sank still lower. Many buildings affected by this decline were\r\nbought up by real estate speculators and sold to Negroes who were eager\r\nfor housing. One speculator bought more than 1,400 such houses.\r\n\r\nThen came the automobile industries with their showrooms, gas stations,\r\nmanufacturing plants, and accessory shops, even invading the boulevards,\r\nand the desirability of adjacent residence property still further\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nAfter the coming of the Negroes the depreciation continued. It was clear\r\nthat the character of the neighborhood had definitely changed. Negroes\r\nwere frequently unable to make the needed extensive repairs while they\r\nwere paying for their property. There are other instances in this area\r\nwhere property not owned by Negroes declined in value chiefly because\r\nof its neglect by landlords.\r\n\r\nIn the district west of Cottage Grove Avenue, adjacent to Hyde Park\r\nproper, depreciation had proceeded in much the same manner. This\r\nneighborhood was temporarily congested in the period of the World's\r\nColumbian Exposition in 1893, and hotels and apartment houses were built\r\nfar in excess of normal needs. Real estate men of that district have made\r\nmuch of this point, stating that many of the houses there had been vacant\r\nas long as fifteen years. The first \"undesirables\" were not Negroes,\r\nbut other national or racial groups of whites who were objectionable\r\nto the original residents. Several factors have combined to make this\r\nsection less and less desirable for residence purposes. It is close to\r\nthe Stock Yards, with their offensive odors; and railroads flank it on\r\nboth sides, with their smoke and noise. The coming of the automobile\r\nindustries, the opening of boarding-houses, the southward movement of\r\nthe vice element, all had their adverse effect on property values before\r\nNegroes moved east of State Street.\r\n\r\nThe widespread and deep-seated racial prejudice among whites against\r\nNegroes, heretofore mentioned as a psychological basis for the belief that\r\nthe presence of Negroes is disastrous to property values, is directly\r\nreflected in the unwillingness of whites to buy property close to that\r\noccupied by Negroes and in their desire to sell, even at a sacrifice, when\r\nNegroes move into the immediate neighborhood. While frequently the demand\r\nfor property among Negroes financially able to buy has not been large\r\nenough to absorb realty offered for sale because of the reasons given\r\nhere, there are, on the other hand, some neighborhoods where the Negro\r\ndemand has provided a market for property that had long been unmarketable,\r\nand in these neighborhoods there has been some increase in the value of\r\nsuch property. It should be noted that the understandable bitterness of\r\nfeeling on this question of Negro entrance into white residence districts\r\nhas been intensified in some cases through exploitation, by both white\r\nand Negro real estate operators, of anti-Negro prejudice and fear of\r\nloss on account of Negro occupancy.\r\n\r\nIn brief, Negro occupancy depreciates the value of residence property in\r\nChicago because of the social prejudice of white people against Negroes,\r\nand because white people will not, and Negroes are financially unable\r\nto buy at fair market prices property thrown upon the market when a\r\nneighborhood begins to change from white to Negro occupancy; nevertheless,\r\na large part of the depreciation of residence property often charged to\r\nNegro occupancy comes from entirely different causes.\r\n\r\n_Financial aspects of Negro housing._--One difficulty of Negroes in\r\nhandling their own housing problem is the attitude of real estate\r\nmortgage and loan concerns with respect to property tenanted or likely\r\nto be tenanted by Negroes. Such property is assumed to be a bad risk,\r\nand, as a consequence, Negroes are charged more than whites and find it\r\ndifficult to secure mortgages to assist in purchasing and are greatly\r\nhandicapped in their efforts to improve property. This situation has its\r\nbasis in various beliefs concerning Negroes that are often unwarranted.\r\nIt developed from the inquiries of the Commission that mortgage brokers\r\nwere influenced to a large degree by opinions of prospective buyers of\r\nNegro mortgages, and these prospective buyers in turn were influenced\r\nby beliefs for which there was little basis. It was assumed, for\r\nexample, that Negroes were unreliable in business dealings. Conferences\r\nwere held by the Commission with the real estate men who handled the\r\ngreatest portion of Negro property, and many other real estate men were\r\ninterviewed by the Commission's investigators. Their testimony indicated\r\na buying capacity far beyond what was expected and showed that Negroes\r\nhad a good record for meeting their obligations. One real estate man who\r\nhas made a large number of sales to Negroes, stated that in the whole\r\nof his experience there had been but two forfeitures, and neither of\r\nthese was due to negligence or carelessness. An increasing tendency to\r\nbuy was noted. This was easily explained by other facts gathered by the\r\nCommission which indicated that it was easier for Negroes to buy than\r\nto rent property, that during the period of the migration hundreds of\r\ndwellings were offered for sale to Negroes on long-term payment plans,\r\nand that many migrants who had sold their homes, farms, and belongings\r\nin the South came to the city prepared to make substantial payments on\r\nproperty. Many Negroes now own houses valued at from $10,000 to $20,000,\r\nand in one instance $30,000.\r\n\r\nRegarding Negro habits of saving, inquiries were made at all the\r\nprincipal banks of the city's business section and of the neighborhood\r\nwhere Negroes live. Those who were able to check up on Negro depositors\r\nreported large sums deposited and invested. One trust and savings bank\r\nhad Negro deposits of $1,500,000 and another of $1,000,000; one state\r\nbank had $650,000 and another $150,000. A large banking institution in\r\nthe \"Loop\" district had 4,000 Negro depositors.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for using their own capital to relieve their housing\r\nproblems were limited by lack of opportunities for obtaining business\r\nexperience. All the concerns questioned regarding the practicability\r\nof employing Negroes in such institutions were of the opinion that it\r\nwould not meet with the favor of the other employees and patrons.\r\n\r\n_Bombings._--The antagonistic sentiment attributable to the Negro housing\r\nsituation both incited and condoned the fifty-eight bombings of homes\r\ncommitted between July 1, 1917, and March 1, 1921. In these bombings\r\ntwo persons, a Negro girl and an infant, were killed, many whites and\r\nNegroes were injured, and damage done to property amounted to more than\r\n$100,000. Negroes who purchased or rented property and whites who sold\r\nor leased it were bombed. Thirty-two bombs were exploded within the area\r\nbounded by Forty-first and Sixtieth streets, Cottage Grove Avenue and\r\nState Street. Although Negroes in some cases were warned of the exact\r\ndates on which they were to be bombed, and policemen were sometimes\r\non duty at the places where bombs were exploded, only two arrests were\r\nmade. One of those arrested was immediately released and the other was\r\nnever brought to trial. Protests to the authorities from Negroes have\r\nbeen without effect, and a strong feeling of insecurity and resentment\r\nhas developed among them. It appears from evidence presented to the\r\nCommission that bombings have been systematically planned. Many white\r\nresidents, objecting to the violence suggested and used to keep out\r\nNegroes, withdrew from the neighborhood protective organizations, fearing\r\nthat they might be held responsible for the resulting lawlessness.\r\n\r\nThese protective associations have denied responsibility and declared\r\nthat they used only legitimate methods, such as foreclosure of mortgages\r\nand refusal to deal with Negroes. During the summer of 1920, they stated,\r\nsixty-eight foreclosures were effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. THE NEGRO COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nThe Negro community in Chicago is virtually a city within a city. It\r\naffords opportunity to observe how it is accomplishing its own adjustment\r\nto the larger community, and how it attempts to function in its own\r\nbehalf and for the betterment of the community at large.\r\n\r\nNegroes have lived in Chicago since its founding. In fact, the first\r\nsettler, in 1778, was a Negro, Jean Baptiste Point de Saible. There\r\nwere Negro property owners at the time of the city's incorporation in\r\n1837. Before the Chicago fire in 1871 they lived near what is now the\r\n\"Loop\" business district, north of Harrison Street on Clark and Dearborn\r\nstreets and on Lake Street on the West Side. Their homes were burned in\r\n1873, and after that they settled in the territory adjoining what later\r\nbecame the \"red light\" district near Roosevelt Road.\r\n\r\n_Organization of the Negro community._--Partly from necessity and partly\r\nfrom choice, Negroes have established their own churches, business\r\nenterprises, amusement places, social agencies, and newspapers. The number\r\nof their business places increased from about 1,200 in 1919 to about\r\n1,500 in 1920. There are 651 places of business operated by Negroes on\r\nSouth State Street, and 549 on the principal cross streets. The majority\r\nof these places are those rendering personal service--barber shops,\r\nrestaurants, hair-dressing parlors, and undertaking establishments.\r\nThere are also two banks.\r\n\r\nOrganizations for social intercourse are numerous, consisting principally\r\nof churches, fraternal societies, and social clubs. There are 170\r\ncongregations holding services in church edifices and in \"store-front\"\r\nchurches. Olivet Baptist Church has more than 10,000 members, the largest\r\nNegro church membership in the world. It employs sixteen paid workers,\r\nand during the last five years has raised more than $200,000. These\r\nchurches are the principal center for \"face-to-face\" relations and aid\r\ngreatly in the process of adjusting Negroes to civic responsibilities.\r\nForty-nine of these congregations own property valued at fully a million\r\nand a half dollars.\r\n\r\nThe social and civic agencies are expressions of the group effort to\r\nadjust itself to the community. There are in the Negro community distinct\r\norganizations of this kind designed especially for Negroes, and branches\r\nof general agencies located conveniently for use by Negroes. Of the\r\nformer type the Chicago Urban League is the most notable example. This\r\norganization is a clearing-house for social work among Negroes, and\r\nits activities include social investigations, an industrial bureau, and\r\nchild welfare. It has an executive board and officers composed of both\r\nwhites and Negroes, and a highly efficient staff of Negro workers. During\r\n1920 more than 25,000 Negroes were assisted through this organization.\r\nProvident Hospital is another example of this type.\r\n\r\nOf the latter type the Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A. is an example. It is a\r\nbranch of the city Y.M.C.A., and has adjusted itself to the peculiar\r\nsocial problems of its membership and community. Other agencies are the\r\nCommunity Service, Wendell Phillips Settlement on the West Side, Butler\r\nCommunity Center on the North Side, Phyllis Wheatley Home for Girls,\r\nHome for the Aged and Infirm, Indiana Avenue Y.W.C.A., Elaine Home Club,\r\nJulia Johnson Home for Girls, Hartzell Center, and Illinois Technical\r\nSchool for Colored Girls (a Roman Catholic institution).\r\n\r\nOf the general social agencies with branches convenient for Negroes\r\nare the American Red Cross, United Charities, Municipal Tuberculosis\r\nSanitarium, Abraham Lincoln Center. Although some of these branches are\r\npoorly supported and undermanned, they represent efforts of the community\r\nto care for itself. During 1920 six social agencies and twenty-seven\r\nchurches raised among Negroes $445,000 for social-welfare work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. RACIAL CONTACTS\r\n\r\nThe problems arising out of various occasions, both voluntary and\r\nenforced, for race association in Chicago, have, for convenience, been\r\nincluded in this report under the general classification of \"racial\r\ncontacts.\" Attention is given to contacts in the public schools, in\r\npublic recreation places, on transportation lines, and in other relations\r\nexclusive of industry and housing which require special treatment. Negroes\r\nin Illinois are legally entitled to all the rights and privileges of\r\nother citizens. Actually, however, their participation in public benefits\r\nin practically every field is limited by some circumvention of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CONTACTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe public schools furnish one of the most important points of contact\r\nbetween the white and Negro races because of the daily association\r\nof thousands of Negro and white children at an impressionable age.\r\nThe Chicago Board of Education makes no distinction between the races\r\nand keeps no separate records. Certain schools, therefore, with white\r\nAmerican, Negro, and white foreign-born preponderances, were selected\r\nfor special study.\r\n\r\n_Physical equipment of schools._--Twenty-two schools located in and\r\nnear areas of Negro residence were selected and visited. Of these only\r\nfive, or 23 per cent, have been built since 1900, and four of these\r\nfive schools are in regions where the Negro population is smallest. The\r\nten schools serving the largest percentage of Negroes were built, one\r\nin 1856, one in 1867, seven between 1880 and 1889, and only one after\r\n1890. Of the 235 schools attended almost wholly by whites, 133, or 56\r\nper cent, were built after 1899. The old buildings will not accommodate\r\nmodern equipment and cannot be enlarged. The absence of modern buildings\r\nis in part due to the old residence areas in which Negroes must live.\r\nThe gymnasiums in fifteen of these twenty-two schools of predominant\r\nNegro attendance are poorly equipped, and in the other seven schools\r\nthere are none. Playground space is about the same in all the schools,\r\nand there was no exceptional overcrowding in schools attended largely\r\nby Negroes except in one case where by the \"shift\" system a double\r\nattendance was made possible. In the schools of mixed attendance one\r\ninstance was conspicuous: Fuller School--a branch of Felsenthal which\r\nis well equipped, and under the same principal, who is an advocate of\r\nsegregation--is in a neighborhood where the percentage of Negroes is the\r\nsame as that around Felsenthal, but it has no playground, is run down,\r\nand neglected. Yet it has 90 per cent Negroes, while Felsenthal has 38\r\nper cent. Unmanageable white children are sent to Fuller.\r\n\r\n_Retardation._--The question of retardation[106] of Negro children is of\r\nserious concern in race relations, since this fact is urged by advocates\r\nof separate schools as an unnecessary handicap for white children and a\r\nreason for segregation. Twenty-four schools were selected, with the aid\r\nof the Board of Education: six attended mainly by Negroes, six mainly\r\nby white Americans, and twelve mainly by children of immigrants. Of a\r\ntotal of 34,593 children there were 18,230, or 53 per cent, retarded--the\r\nsame percentage as in the entire city; 10,250, or 30 per cent, normal;\r\nand 5,910, or 17 per cent, accelerated. In the schools attended mainly\r\nby white Americans, 49 per cent were retarded; in those attended mainly\r\nby children of immigrants 49 per cent; and in those attended mainly by\r\nNegroes 74 per cent. The percentage of retardation in schools attended\r\nmainly by Negroes ranges from 57 to 80 per cent; in schools attended\r\nmainly by children of immigrants from 32 to 71 per cent; and in schools\r\nattended mainly by white Americans from 40 to 62 per cent.\r\n\r\nPredominating causes of this retardation of Negro children, according to\r\nthe Board of Education's classification, are: \"late entrance to school,\"\r\n\"family difficulties,\" \"fathers or mothers working,\" \"lack of education\r\nin parents.\" The majority of retarded Negro children are southerners, and\r\ntheir retardation can be readily understood when the gross inadequacies\r\nof southern schools for Negroes are considered.\r\n\r\nAmong the whites, late entrance, inability to speak English, ill health,\r\nbackwardness, and low mentality are the various causes. It is interesting\r\nto note that while it is often maintained that Negroes are mentally\r\nweak and incapable, classification of retardation figures according to\r\ncauses does not bear out that theory. Negro children retarded from \"late\r\nentrance\" have made excellent records in attaining a normal rating, some\r\ncompleting three grades in a year.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixteen Negro children were picked at random for an\r\nintensive inquiry by the Commission into causes of retardation. Of these,\r\n101 had been in school before coming to Chicago; and of the 101 children,\r\neighty had lived in the South and had gone to southern schools; those\r\nborn and educated in the North showed no greater rate of retardation than\r\nthe whites. For much of the retardation the school facilities for Negroes\r\nin the South appear to be responsible. In Mississippi, for example, only\r\neighty days' schooling is required in counties that do not absolutely\r\nreject the compulsory-education law. Other causes found were inadequate\r\ncare and instruction at home due to the ignorance of parents, mothers\r\nworking out, poor parental discipline, and the physical condition of\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n_Contact problems._--A wide variety of opinions was found among principals\r\nand teachers concerning the relations of white and Negro children.\r\nSeveral principals were distinctly antagonistic to Negroes, and in their\r\nschools the race relations of the pupils were not cordial. The most\r\nimportant factor in determining the attitude of teachers as well as of\r\npupils was the attitude of principals. Kindergarten teachers found a\r\nnatural, pleasant relationship existing between the young white and Negro\r\nchildren. As children grew older they became more race conscious, and in\r\nthe high schools friction frequently arose from race groupings in class\r\nand social organizations. Negro teachers are assigned to schools attended\r\nby both Negroes and immigrants, and apparently have no difficulties with\r\npupils or parents. Difficulties and bad feeling have been provoked by\r\nthe disposition of certain white teachers to adapt their instruction in\r\naccordance with their assumptions concerning Negroes' mental and emotional\r\ncharacteristics, putting stress on singing and handicraft instead of on\r\nbasic studies in arithmetic and grammar.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. RECREATION\r\n\r\nIn its investigation of recreation places, the Commission listed 127\r\nparks, playgrounds, recreation centers, and beaches under the supervision\r\nof the Municipal Bureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing Beaches, and\r\nof the South Park, West Park, and Lincoln Park commissions. Of these,\r\nthirty-seven are in or near Negro areas. Though this figure represents a\r\nfairly adequate distribution, it is not an accurate picture. Twenty-three\r\nof these places are playgrounds attached to schools, fourteen being in,\r\nand nine near, Negro areas; and only thirteen have more than 10 per\r\ncent use by Negroes. Three bathing-beaches are within, and two near,\r\nNegro areas, while only one has more than 10 per cent use by Negroes.\r\nThere are seven recreation centers near Negro areas, none within, and\r\nonly one with more than 10 per cent use by Negroes. Armour Square, for\r\nexample, is a recreation center bordering on the area of the largest Negro\r\npopulation; but the hostility of whites, especially gangs of hoodlums,\r\nattacks on Negro children, and the indifferent attitude of the director\r\nrender attendance by Negroes extremely hazardous. Of a daily attendance\r\nof 1,500, less than 1 per cent are Negroes, despite the fact that over\r\n50 per cent of the immediately surrounding population is Negro. Natural\r\nbarriers of distance, unofficial discrimination of officials, and the\r\nhostility of neighborhood groups are largely responsible for the lack\r\nof participation.\r\n\r\nThe beaches have presented the most difficult problems of race control.\r\nThe riot of 1919 began at the Twenty-ninth Street Beach, and since the\r\nriot numerous smaller clashes have occurred there. At Thirty-eighth\r\nStreet, also on the edge of the largest area of Negro residence, Negroes\r\nare entirely excluded, the policeman on duty and the attendant in\r\ncharge assisting in this exclusion to prevent clashes. In neighborhoods\r\nwith a small Negro population, attendance at the recreation places is\r\nalways much below the percentage of Negroes to the total population in\r\nsuch neighborhoods, this being due to the hostility shown by whites,\r\nespecially of the hoodlum element, and also to the reluctance of Negroes\r\nto go where they feel unwelcome.\r\n\r\n_Contacts._--Most difficulties in parks and playgrounds have not\r\nbeen caused by the behavior of Negroes there. Such complaints against\r\nNegroes as have come from these contacts have concerned groups of rough\r\nor domineering children at the playgrounds rather than adults. Two\r\nplaygrounds on the South Side make such complaints.\r\n\r\n_Race relations of the children._--Lack of racial antagonism was reported\r\nat a large number of playgrounds. Apparatus was used by both groups\r\nwithout friction. Negro and white children mingled freely in their games\r\nand in the swimming-pools, and both Negroes and whites played on baseball\r\nand athletic teams. The occasional playground fights usually lack any\r\nelement of racial antipathy. \"There might be personal misunderstandings\r\nand disagreements between a white and a black just the same as between\r\ntwo whites,\" said the director of Union Park, \"but I wouldn't lay it\r\nto race prejudice. They work together and play together and seem to\r\nharmonize in most instances.\" When this director came to Union Park a\r\nyear ago he found a tendency among Negroes and whites to separate into\r\nrace groups, but steps were taken to bring them together in games of\r\nvarious kinds, and toward the end of the season the director felt that\r\nthey \"harmonized better and worked together more cordially than they did\r\nbefore.\" When the Commission's investigator visited Union Park Playground\r\nhe saw small children of both races playing together on the same pieces\r\nof apparatus--a Negro child on one end of a teeter ladder and a white\r\nchild on the other. Occasionally there is a disturbance, usually starting\r\nfrom a dispute over the apparatus; but on the whole the children play\r\ntogether peacefully.\r\n\r\n_Voluntary racial grouping._--Voluntary racial grouping appears to be\r\nmore characteristic of the large parks and beaches which adults frequent\r\nthan of the playgrounds, which are used mainly by children. One instance\r\nof voluntary grouping among children was found at Copernicus Playground.\r\nThe playing space is in the shape of an \"L,\" one end intended for boys\r\nand the other for girls, but by common consent the children divide along\r\nrace lines rather than sex.\r\n\r\nIn the general use of Lincoln and Washington parks the Negroes and whites\r\nstay in separate groups. There has never been any difficulty, according\r\nto the Lincoln Park representative, arising from the fact that Negroes\r\nhave taken possession of a spot desired by whites for a picnic or other\r\namusement. No part of either park is especially set aside for the use\r\nof one race, and groups of both Negroes and whites are seen everywhere\r\nin the parks, but they do not mingle.\r\n\r\nSome directors attempt to regulate these contacts to avoid any mingling\r\nof groups. At the Municipal Pier, for example, an investigator learned\r\nthat when Negro couples went on the dancing-pavilion floor the floor\r\nmanager informed them that they were not dancing properly and took them\r\nto one side to acquaint them with the approved style of dancing; no\r\nmatter how well they danced, they were to be prevented from going on\r\nthe floor by the manager's judgment of their dancing. More recently,\r\nhowever, Negroes have reported that they have been able freely to use\r\nthis dance floor.\r\n\r\nClashes in the various recreation places as early as 1913 were found to\r\nhave been started mostly by gangs of white \"roughs.\" On one occasion,\r\nfor example, the secretary of boys' work of the Wabash Avenue department\r\nY.M.C.A. (for Negroes) conducted a party of nineteen Negro boys to Armour\r\nSquare. They had no difficulty in entering the park, but on leaving\r\nthey were assailed by crowds of white boys. Some of them were tripped,\r\ntrodden upon, and badly bruised. They took refuge in a neighboring\r\nsaloon, where they remained for a half-hour, when a detachment of police\r\nscattered the white gang. On another occasion a group of boys from the\r\nsame institution were driven from the lake at Thirty-first Street.\r\nIn 1915 Father Bishop, of St. Thomas Episcopal Church, took a group\r\nof Negro boys to Armour Square to play basket-ball. The entire party,\r\nincluding Father Bishop, were beaten by white boys and their sweaters\r\ntaken from them. In the same year an attempt was made by a Negro boys'\r\nclub director to take seventy-five Negro boys through the Stock Yards.\r\nThey had received tickets of admission to the stock show. In spite of\r\nthe presence and efforts of four adult leaders, these boys were struck\r\nby sticks and other missiles while passing from one section of the show\r\nto another. Police assistance was required to get them from the pavilion\r\nto the street cars.\r\n\r\nGangs of white boys, sixteen and seventeen years of age, from the\r\nneighborhood of Fifty-ninth Street and Wentworth Avenue frequently\r\ninterfered with Negro participants in baseball games in Washington Park,\r\nespecially during the spring and summer of 1918 and 1919. They also\r\nannoyed Negro couples on the park benches. Where the Negro showed fight,\r\nminor clashes resulted. Park officials have not been able to restrain\r\nthe ill feeling which these conflicts engender.\r\n\r\nClashes were noted in Ogden Park as early as 1914 and frequently since\r\nthat time. A Negro playground director testified that he and other\r\nNegroes had been slugged while attending band concerts or attempting to\r\nuse shower baths after a game in the park. At the boathouse in Washington\r\nPark, in the early summer of 1920, there were numerous clashes between\r\nNegroes and whites. In the following year, however, considerably fewer\r\ninstances of friction were reported. Playground directors are of the\r\nopinion that friction is likely to occur where groups of Negro children\r\nfor the first time come into parks theretofore exclusively used by\r\nwhites. Adjustment is likely to follow after this period. In some cases,\r\nhowever, when the proportion of Negroes has grown larger than that of\r\nwhites, a Negro director has been placed in charge of the park with the\r\nunofficial understanding that it should be turned over to Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe two causes of neighborhood antagonism back of the friction in\r\nthe parks most commonly cited are the housing and sex problems. The\r\nplaygrounds and parks usually share in a general way the sentiments of\r\nthe mixed neighborhoods in or near which they are located.\r\n\r\nOne source of racial disorders is lack of co-operation between park and\r\ncity policemen. The park police stop a fight between white and colored\r\nchildren and send them out of the park. When the fight is renewed outside\r\nthe park they have no power to interfere. Spectators may then get into\r\nthe fight, and serious clashes may be well under way before the city\r\npolice can be summoned.\r\n\r\nThe most important remedies suggested to the Commission for the betterment\r\nof relations between Negroes and whites at the various places of\r\nrecreation were: (1) additional facilities in Negro areas, particularly\r\nrecreation centers which can be used by adults; (2) an awakened public\r\nopinion which will refuse to tolerate the hoodlum and will insist that\r\nthe courts properly punish such offenders; (3) selection of directors\r\nfor parks in neighborhoods where there is a critical situation who have\r\na sympathetic understanding of the problem and will not tolerate actions\r\nby park police officers and other subordinate officials which tend to\r\ndiscourage Negro attendance; and (4) efforts by such directors to repress\r\nand remove any racial antagonism that may arise in the neighborhood\r\nabout the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CONTACTS IN TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nThe study of contacts between whites and Negroes in street cars and other\r\npublic conveyances was prompted by a usually unexplained emphasis on\r\napparently trivial incidents connected with public conveyances, together\r\nwith the observation that the greatest disturbances during the riot of\r\n1919 commonly occurred along transportation lines and at transfer points.\r\n\r\nAlthough many clashes and other instances of racial friction on the street\r\ncars were not serious enough to be reported to the newspapers or to be\r\nmade the subject of complaint, information obtained by investigators\r\nfor the Commission showed that the attitude of both Negroes and whites\r\ntoward each other was being affected by contacts on the cars.\r\n\r\nAs affecting attitudes on race relations, transportation contacts,\r\nwhile impersonal and temporary, are significant for several reasons.\r\nMany whites have no contact with Negroes except on the cars, and their\r\npersonal impression of the entire Negro group may be determined by one\r\nor two observations of Negro passengers. Unlike contacts in the school,\r\nplayground, and workshop, transportation contacts are not supervised, and\r\nif there is any dispute among passengers the settlement usually rests\r\nwith themselves. Suspicion or prejudice on either side because of the\r\ndifference in race accentuates any misunderstanding. And transportation\r\ncontacts, at least on crowded cars, involve physical contact between\r\nNegroes and whites, which rarely occurs under other circumstances and\r\nsometimes leads to a display of racial feeling.\r\n\r\nThe Commission's investigators, white and Negro, men and women, made many\r\ntrips for observation on the twelve lines carrying the heaviest volume\r\nof Negro traffic and therefore involving the greatest amount of contact.\r\nCounts of passengers, Negro and white, were made, behavior and habits\r\nwere noted, and passengers and car crews were drawn into conversation.\r\nOfficials of surface and elevated lines, starters, and station men were\r\ninterviewed. Instances of friction which came to the attention of the\r\nCommission were noted and the circumstances studied.\r\n\r\nTraffic counts made by the Chicago Traction and Subway Commission in 1916\r\nshowed 3,500,000 surface-railway and 500,000 elevated-railway passengers\r\ncarried in a twenty-four-hour day. Negroes constitute 4 per cent of\r\nthe city's population and probably about that percentage of the city's\r\nstreet-car traffic. Negro traffic, however, instead of being scattered\r\nover the city, is mainly concentrated upon twelve lines which traverse the\r\nNegro residential areas and connect those areas with the manufacturing\r\ndistricts where Negroes are employed. Because of this concentration the\r\nproportion of Negroes to whites on these twelve lines is much higher\r\nthan 4 per cent, and on such lines as that on State Street, the principal\r\nbusiness street of the South Side Negro residence area, it often happens\r\nthat the majority of the passengers are Negroes.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"Jim Crow\" separation of races on street cars in Chicago.\r\nContacts of Negroes and whites on the street cars did not provoke any\r\nconsiderable discussion before the period of migration of Negroes from\r\nthe South, when occasional stories of clashes began to be circulated;\r\nand even then, such friction as developed did not come prominently to\r\npublic attention. Only one incident involving a clash was reported in\r\nthe newspapers. Even since the migration began, there have been very few\r\ncomplaints based upon racial friction. The Elevated Railroad Company,\r\nwhose South Side line has the largest Negro traffic of any elevated\r\nline, replied to inquiries that, except during the riot of 1919, when a\r\nfew cases of racial disorder were reported, there had been no complaints\r\nfrom motormen or trainmen since 1918, when a trainman was cut by a Negro.\r\nNo complaints from white passengers had been received since the spring\r\nof 1917, when white office workers objected to riding with Stock Yards\r\nlaborers, mainly Negroes, on the Stock Yards spur of the elevated. White\r\nlaborers in the Stock Yards mostly live within walking distance of their\r\nwork, but Negroes found it necessary to use car lines running east to\r\nthe main area of Negro residence. The Chicago Surface lines replied that\r\ncomplaints due to racial friction were negligible.\r\n\r\nMany of the migrants are laborers who must use these lines going to and\r\nfrom work, and many of them are rough-mannered and entirely unfamiliar\r\nwith standards of conduct in northern cities. Another serious factor\r\nis the recent entrance of Negroes into industry. Before the war the\r\ngreat majority of Negroes gainfully employed were engaged in some form\r\nof personal service which did not require use of transportation lines\r\nin their working clothes to and from the manufacturing centers. The\r\nmigrants, many of them coming to a city like Chicago with no \"Jim Crow\"\r\nsegregation, felt strange and uncertain as to how they should act. In\r\nfact, peculiarities of conduct on the part of these were noted by Negroes\r\nof longer residence in Chicago, and it has been remarked by whites and\r\nNegroes that they could tell a Negro migrant by his uneasy manner and\r\noften by his clothing. Conspicuous points of behavior of migrant Negroes\r\nbefore they became urbanized, which many whites noted and commented\r\non were: \"loud laughter and talking,\" \"old and ill-smelling clothes,\"\r\n\"roughness and his tendency to sit all over the car.\" These are easy\r\nto understand when one considers the background of the southern Negro.\r\nThere are, on the other hand, exceptional cases where Negroes have walked\r\nmiles rather than take a car, thus avoiding possible embarrassment. A\r\nNegro who has been in Chicago for a long time is not self-conscious about\r\nsitting near white persons. Negroes who get into trouble with whites\r\nabout insisting on their right to a seat often belong to the class of\r\nsuspicious and sensitive Negroes who fear that an attempt is being made\r\nto segregate them, and sometimes they are simply \"greenhorns.\"\r\n\r\nSoiled and ill-smelling clothing was found to be an objection applying\r\nto white as well as Negro laborers. These complaints came, for the\r\nmost part, from clerical workers who objected to physical contact with\r\npersons who might \"rub off.\" A difficulty involving this feature was\r\nadjusted by one packing company by dismissing its clerical workers and\r\nits laborers at different hours. A frequent source of misunderstanding\r\nhas been a situation in which it appeared that Negroes had taken seats\r\nintended for white women. In several such cases thoroughly examined\r\nby the Commission's investigators the difficulties were found to have\r\nresulted from misunderstood actions.\r\n\r\nMost of the difficulties in transportation contacts reported and generally\r\ncomplained of seem to have centered around the first blundering efforts\r\nof migrants to adjust themselves to northern city life. The efforts of\r\nagencies interested in assisting this adjustment, together with the Negro\r\npress and the intimate criticisms and suggestions for proper conduct\r\nof Chicago Negroes, have smoothed down many of the roughnesses of the\r\nmigrants, and as a result friction from contacts in transportation seems\r\nto have lessened materially.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. CRIME AND VICIOUS ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\nMany students of the race problem look upon public crime records as a\r\nregister of the failure of Negroes to adjust themselves to the social\r\nfabric. Study of infractions of law by Negroes, of provocation to\r\nlawlessness, and of the history of their crimes would indeed reveal an\r\ninteresting background of their present behavior in relation to whites, if\r\nsuch a study were possible from present records. The Commission carried\r\nits investigations into this field and found no means of determining\r\nhow great a proportion of the city's crimes is committed by Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing impression that Negroes are by nature more criminal\r\nthan whites and more prone to commit sex crimes has restricted their\r\nemployment, increased unfair measures of restraint, and blackened the name\r\nof the entire Negro group. Two important facts were apparent from the\r\nCommission's study: (1) the danger inherent in the vicious environment\r\nin which Negroes are forced to live, and (2) the misrepresentative\r\ncharacter of the statistics of Negro crime.\r\n\r\n_Environment._--The limitations imposed on Negro residential areas have\r\nprovided undue cause and occasion for crime. The entire population, good\r\nand bad, is thrown together, exposing children to the sight and temptation\r\nof vice and immorality. Ninety per cent of the Negro population has\r\nalways lived near the city's former segregated vice districts, partly\r\nbecause white sentiment excluded them from other neighborhoods, partly\r\nbecause rents in the neighborhood of vice were low enough to meet their\r\nmeager economic resources, and partly because their weakness made their\r\nprotests against the proximity of vice less effective than the protests\r\nof whites. When the vice districts were broken up and the inmates\r\nscattered, they entered the better neighborhoods of Negro residence and\r\nclandestinely plied their trade. In fact, according to the report of the\r\nChicago Vice Commission in 1911, at one time prostitutes were promised\r\nimmunity by the police if they confined themselves to a certain area\r\nin which Negroes predominated. The spread of the Negro population has\r\nalways been accompanied by the spread of clandestine prostitution. The\r\nVice Commission's report said:\r\n\r\n     The history of the social evil in Chicago is intimately\r\n     connected with the colored population. Invariably the large\r\n     vice districts have been created within or near the settlements\r\n     of colored people. In the past history of the city every time\r\n     a new vice district was created downtown or on the South Side,\r\n     the colored families were in the district moving in just ahead\r\n     of the prostitutes. The situation along State Street from\r\n     Sixteenth Street south is an illustration.\r\n\r\n     So whenever prostitutes, cadets, and thugs were located among\r\n     white people and had to be moved for commercial or other\r\n     reasons, they were driven to undesirable parts of the city,\r\n     the so-called colored residential sections.\r\n\r\nMost of the vicious resorts in the \"Black Belt\" are owned and operated\r\nby whites and are not interfered with by the authorities. Protests\r\nfrom Negroes have never succeeded in removing them. Opportunities for\r\nwholesome recreation in the Negro districts are limited, and commercial\r\namusements, though probably no worse than in some other sections of the\r\ncity, are of a distinctly inferior type and carelessly supervised. In\r\nsuch an infective environment it is not unnatural that many criminals\r\nshould be developed.\r\n\r\nBut the study of crime statistics, aside from showing the unreliability\r\nof records due to careless methods of obtaining and presenting data,\r\nrevealed that Negroes suffer gross injustice in the handling of criminal\r\naffairs. The general inaccuracy of criminal statistics is shown by the\r\nfact, for example, that the police reported 1,731 burglaries, or persons\r\narrested for burglary, in 1919, while the Chicago Crime Commission\r\nreported 5,509 burglaries during the first eleven months of that year.\r\nThe evidence at hand indicates that Negroes are debited with practically\r\nall their crimes, while others are not. It further appears, from the\r\nrecords and from the testimony of judges in the juvenile, municipal,\r\ncircuit, superior, and criminal courts, of police officials, the state's\r\nattorney, and various experts on crime, probation, and parole, that\r\nNegroes are more commonly arrested, subjected to police identification,\r\nand convicted than white offenders; that on similar evidence they are\r\ngenerally held and convicted on more serious charges, and that they are\r\ngiven longer sentences. This bias, when reflected in the figures, serves\r\nto bolster by false figures the already existing belief that Negroes\r\nare more likely to be criminal than other racial groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE NEGRO IN CHICAGO INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nOut of Chicago's Negro population of approximately 110,000 in 1920, it\r\nis estimated that 70,000 were gainfully employed. The opportunity for\r\nengaging in industry in large numbers came to Negroes following the\r\noutbreak of the world-war. With the enormous demand from the belligerent\r\ncountries for American goods, existing establishments were enlarged and\r\nnew ones created. As an example of the increased demand for workers,\r\none of the packing-plants in the Chicago Stock Yards increased its force\r\nduring the war from 8,000 to 17,000. Immigration was almost wholly cut\r\noff. The labor shortage became acute after the entrance of the United\r\nStates into the war in 1917. The migration of Negroes from the South\r\nduring that period was mainly in response to this demand.\r\n\r\nPrior to the beginning of the war in 1914, Negroes had been virtually\r\nlimited to personal and domestic service in almost every city in the\r\nNorth. In 1910 more than 60 per cent of those gainfully employed were\r\nso engaged, 15 per cent in manufacturing, and 3 per cent in clerical\r\noccupations. The Commission's inquiries covered 136 establishments\r\nreporting five or more Negroes. In these were employed 118,098 whites and\r\n21,987 Negroes--12,854 in manufacturing and 9,133 in non-manufacturing\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. INCREASE IN NEGRO LABOR\r\n\r\nBetween 1915 and 1920 there was a remarkable increase in the number of\r\nNegroes employed in industries which before 1915 had either employed\r\nthem in small numbers or not at all. In a total of sixty-two such plants\r\nthere was an increase from 1,346 in 1915 to 10,587 in 1920, or more\r\nthan 1,000 per cent. Labor shortage, or inability to obtain competent\r\nwhite workers, was the reason given in practically every instance for\r\nthe large increase in Negro employees.\r\n\r\nFrequent complaints have been made that large employers, particularly\r\nthe packers, imported Negroes from the South and were thus responsible\r\nfor the difficulties that followed. Definite effort was made to determine\r\nthe facts, but the Commission found no basis for the statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CLASSIFICATION OF NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\nAbsence of standards of classification for skilled, semi-skilled, and\r\nunskilled work invalidated the Commission's effort to classify Negro\r\nworkers. In sixty-six industries with definite divisions in grades of\r\nwork, it was found that out of 12,529 Negroes employed, 927 were skilled,\r\n267 semi-skilled and 11,335 unskilled workers. In other returns, not\r\ncapable of full classification, ten establishments reported 304 Negro\r\nmolders; there were thirty-one Negro molders in 1910. Twelve factories\r\nreported 382 machine operators; in 1920 the census reports showed only\r\ntwenty-eight.\r\n\r\nWages of Negroes in the branches of employment where they were permitted\r\nto work were generally the same as for white workers. There were\r\ninstances, however, of discrimination in placing or keeping Negroes at\r\nwork on processes in which they could not earn as much as in processes on\r\nwhich white men were engaged. Also there were instances of discrimination\r\nin piecework, the foremen invariably giving Negroes only the jobs yielding\r\na low rate. For common labor the average wage was 45 and 50 cents an\r\nhour for an eight-, nine- and ten-hour day for men; $15 to $20 a week for\r\nwomen, and an average of $15 a week, with room and board, for domestics\r\nwere the going wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. EMPLOYERS' EXPERIENCE WITH NEGRO LABOR\r\n\r\nWhether or not the Negro will be able to hold the position in industry\r\nmade possible for him by the war depends much on employers' attitude\r\ntoward him as a worker. Common explanations given before this period as a\r\nreason for not employing Negroes more were that they were lazy, shiftless,\r\nirresponsible, and inefficient. Generalizations of this sort demonstrate\r\ntheir weakness in the fact that employers were not speaking from their\r\nown experiences. To reach a fair conclusion employers of Negroes in\r\nlarge numbers were interviewed by the Commission's investigators.\r\n\r\nEmployers drew a distinction between northern and southern Negroes; they\r\nthought that the latter had shortcomings when they first began work,\r\nbut that this was due to former habits of work and familiarity with\r\nonly simple industrial processes. Many of these southern workers were\r\nirregular at first in reporting for work and frequently drew their wages\r\nbefore pay day, thus confusing the bookkeeping. They were soon forced,\r\nhowever, to abandon these habits.\r\n\r\nOne question asked of all employers was: \"Has your Negro labor proved\r\nsatisfactory?\" Of the 137 establishments employing five or more\r\nNegro workers, 118 reported that Negro labor had proved satisfactory;\r\nnineteen reported that Negro labor had not proved satisfactory. The 118\r\nestablishments reporting Negro workers as satisfactory employed 21,640\r\nNegroes, while the nineteen reporting them as unsatisfactory employed\r\n697. Comparing the efficiency of Negro and white workers, seventy-one\r\nemployers interviewed (thirty-four manufacturers and thirty-seven\r\nnon-manufacturers) considered the Negro equally efficient, twenty-two\r\nemployers (thirteen manufacturers and nine non-manufacturers) considered\r\nthe Negro less efficient. The seventy-one establishments included almost\r\nall the large establishments. A few gave the Negro a higher rating than\r\nthe foreigners because of his knowledge of English.\r\n\r\nRegarding reliability, ninety-two employers gave opinions. Sixty-three\r\n(thirty manufacturers and thirty-three non-manufacturers) believed that\r\nNegroes did not require more supervision than white workers, while\r\ntwenty-nine (sixteen manufacturers and thirteen non-manufacturers)\r\nthought they required more supervision. Of the employers interviewed,\r\nfifty-seven expressed the opinion (twenty-three manufacturers and\r\nthirty-four non-manufacturers) that \"absenteeism\" among Negro workers was\r\nno greater than among whites, while thirty-six reported it was greater.\r\n\r\nOne plant employing 2,084 Negroes stated that the better living standards\r\nand ambitions had brought up the rating of Negro workers during the war\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. LABOR TURNOVER\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-two employers giving figures on relative labor turnover,\r\ntwenty-four (eleven manufacturers and thirteen non-manufacturers)\r\nreported the Negro turnover to be the same as the white, and twenty-eight\r\n(eighteen manufacturers and ten non-manufacturers) believed the turnover\r\nto be greater. Closely connected with the labor turnover among Negroes\r\nis the question of \"hope on the job,\" as one Negro expressed it. When\r\nNegroes are not allowed to advance to better positions in a given plant,\r\nor are discriminated against by foremen underrating their efficiency,\r\nthe turnover in the plant is high.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. NEGRO WOMEN IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nBefore the war Negro women were even more definitely restricted than Negro\r\nmen in choice of occupations. Two-thirds of those gainfully employed were\r\nin two occupation groups: \"servants\" and laundresses, not in laundries,\r\nand domestic servants. Of the 137 establishments studied, forty-two had\r\nno Negro women employees, forty-five kept no separate records, and fifty\r\nreported a total of 3,407 Negro women workers. Although this study does\r\nnot include all industries employing women, the total given represents\r\na large increase over the figure of 998 Negro women enumerated by the\r\n1910 census as engaged in all industries in Chicago.\r\n\r\nMany of the establishments in question had employed large numbers of Negro\r\nwomen as an experiment and had found them satisfactory. One mail-order\r\nhouse employed as many as 650 girls for clerical work. When the plant\r\nwas investigated in 1920, there were 311 girls, 75 per cent of whom\r\nwere high-school graduates, while 12 per cent had had two or more years\r\nin college. These employers said the girls felt that they were making\r\nhistory for the race and were, if anything, a little over-zealous. They\r\nwere thought to be excitable and suspicious of the actions of the white\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nMillinery establishments, manufacturers of clothing, lamp-shades,\r\ngas-mantles, paper-boxes, and cheese makers reported satisfactory\r\nexperience with Negro women. Of twenty laundries employing Negro workers,\r\nsatisfactory or unsatisfactory, four did not keep separate records.\r\nTwelve with 409 Negro women reported their work satisfactory, and four\r\nwith 134 Negro women reported it unsatisfactory. The chief complaint was\r\nunwillingness to work overtime or on Sundays. In both instances, however,\r\nemployees interviewed complained that the hours were long (nine hours\r\na day) and their treatment by the management harsh and inconsiderate.\r\n\r\nOf 865 Negro employees interviewed, less than 1 per cent complained\r\nof disagreeable treatment by white workers and less than 50 per cent\r\ncomplained of conditions of work. Others expressed themselves as glad\r\nof the opportunity to earn good wages. Complaints against conditions of\r\nwork were found in the iron and steel mills, Stock Yards, and dining-car\r\nand sleeping-car service.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. INDUSTRIES EXCLUDING THE NEGRO\r\n\r\nSeveral important industries have not opened their doors to Negroes\r\nexcept as janitors and porters. Among these are the traction companies,\r\nelevated and surface, the State Street department stores, and the taxicab\r\ncompanies. Employers in these establishments express the belief that\r\nthe public would object to Negroes.\r\n\r\nAttention has been called to the waste involved in the limitations of\r\nNegroes in industry. Men with college training are forced to work as\r\nwaiters and porters, and young-women college graduates are frequently\r\nforced to work as ushers in theaters and as ladies' maids. This condition\r\nhelps to account for the ease with which 1,500 Negro girls with more\r\nthan average schooling were recruited in less than two months for the\r\nmail-order houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. RELATIONS BETWEEN WHITE AND NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\nThrough working together friendliness between white and Negro workers\r\nhas been increased, according to prevalent views. Information concerning\r\nrelations was secured from all the 137 plants studied. Two reported that\r\nrace friction was a disturbing factor in the plants. Minor instances\r\nof friction have occurred, but it appeared that as a rule the workers\r\nreflected the attitude of the management. The setting up of partitions\r\nseparating the races developed an antagonistic sentiment, and in some\r\ninstances this antagonism was removed when the partitions were taken\r\ndown. Of 101 establishments visited eighteen, or 11 per cent, with 2,623\r\nNegroes, maintained separate accommodations. This constituted a continuous\r\nsource of dissatisfaction for Negro workers, who felt themselves \"Jim\r\nCrowed.\" In the remaining 89 per cent, employing 19,714 Negroes among\r\nmore than 100,000 whites, all accommodations were used in common by both\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. THE PERIOD OF INDUSTRIAL DEPRESSION\r\n\r\nFollowing the war's inflation of industry a slump came in the winter of\r\n1920-21. Common labor was reduced in all the large plants from 20 to\r\n50 per cent. Negroes, mostly common laborers, suffered most from this\r\nreduction. At one period there were as many as 15,000 Negroes unemployed\r\nin Chicago. They were cared for during their enforced idleness by the\r\nUrban League and Negro churches and by popular contributions from working\r\nNegroes. The reduction of labor was usually carried out by employers\r\nwith some system, and few instances of gross race discrimination were\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. ORGANIZED LABOR AND NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\nClashing interests have manifested themselves conspicuously in the\r\nrelations between union labor organizations and Negro workers, and\r\nthis antagonism has been carried over into the relations of whites and\r\nNegroes generally. The efforts of union labor to promote its cause have\r\nbuilt up a body of sentiment not easy to oppose by workers unsympathetic\r\ntoward the labor movement. Circumstances have frequently made Negroes\r\nstrike breakers, and thus centered upon them as a racial group all the\r\nbitterness of the unionist toward strike breakers as a class.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Negroes have often expressed themselves as having\r\nlittle faith in the union labor movement because the unions have\r\nmanifested prejudices against permitting them to share equal benefits\r\nof membership; and again they have gained their first opportunity in a\r\nnew industry frequently through the desire of a strike-bound employer\r\nto keep his plant running when his white employees have walked out.\r\n\r\nFrom its beginning the American Federation of Labor has declared a uniform\r\npolicy of non-racial discrimination, but this policy has not been carried\r\nout in practice by all its constituent or affiliated bodies. At several\r\nof its conventions resolutions have been passed embodying the official\r\nsentiment of the federation, but no means has yet been discovered to\r\neffect a uniform policy of fair dealing throughout all its affiliated\r\nbodies. Aside from those unions in which the membership privilege for\r\nNegroes is modified, eight of the 110 national or international unions\r\naffiliated with the American Federation of Labor explicitly bar the\r\nNegro by provisions in their constitutions or rituals. These unions\r\nare: Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of\r\nAmerica, International Association of Machinists, American Association of\r\nMasters, Mates, and Pilots, Railway Mail Association, Order of Railroad\r\nTelegraphers, the Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America, and American\r\nWire Weavers' Protective Association.\r\n\r\nThe general exclusion policy of the railway brotherhoods and several\r\nunions of the Railway Department of the American Federation of Labor\r\nhas created a feeling of bitterness among Negroes, many of whom are\r\nemployed in branches of the railway service. As a protest against this\r\npolicy there has been formed the Railway Men's International Benevolent\r\nIndustrial Association with seventeen locals in Chicago and a local\r\nmembership of 1,200. Mr. Mays, president of this organization, stated\r\nthat its purpose was merely to safeguard the ranks of Negro workers, and\r\nsaid that it was ready to merge itself into the general unions as soon\r\nas they were ready to accept them without discrimination and accord the\r\nsame privileges as white railway workers.\r\n\r\nThe Commission obtained information from local unions in Chicago with\r\na membership of 294,437, of whom 12,106 were Negroes. On the basis of\r\npolicy toward the Negro, unions in Chicago may be divided into four\r\nclasses or types:\r\n\r\nA. Unions admitting Negroes to white locals\r\n\r\nB. Unions admitting Negroes to separate or co-ordinate locals\r\n\r\nC. Unions admitting Negroes to subordinate or auxiliary locals\r\n\r\nD. Unions excluding Negroes from membership\r\n\r\nWherever and whenever Negroes are admitted on an equal basis and given\r\na square deal, the feeling inside the union is nearly always harmonious.\r\nExamples of type A are the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen\r\nof the World, Hodcarriers, Flat Janitors, and Ladies' Garment Workers.\r\nIn some of these organizations Negroes hold office.\r\n\r\nUnions of type B give as reasons for organizing Negroes into separate\r\nlocals, first, preference of Negro workers for locals of their own,\r\nand, second, unwillingness of white workers to admit Negroes to white\r\nlocals. The Negro Musicians' Union belongs to this type and has the same\r\nwage scale as the white union. There appears to be little difficulty\r\nhere because there is no conflict in contracts for work in the city.\r\nThe painters, however, have had difficulties which have \"hung fire\" for\r\nmore than a year; after being given a temporary charter they still were\r\nunable to work.\r\n\r\nUnions of type C, admitting Negroes to subordinate locals, are few\r\nin number, apparently because Negroes strongly resent this form of\r\naffiliation. There is, however, one example of this type which permits\r\nNegro helpers in a certain trade to be organized as an auxiliary under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the white local unions having jurisdiction over their\r\ndistrict. By constitution it is provided that their minutes be submitted\r\nto the white locals and their grievances placed before the white locals.\r\nThe constitution also provides that there shall be no transfer of colored\r\nhelpers to any except Negro auxiliaries, and that Negro helpers shall\r\nnot be promoted to skilled trades or to helper apprentice, and shall\r\nnot be admitted to shops where white helpers are employed. These Negro\r\nlocals are represented by delegates selected by the white locals in\r\ntheir districts.\r\n\r\nUnions of type D, excluding the Negro from membership, do so either in\r\nconformity with the laws of their national unions or in the exercise\r\nof local option. In addition to the eight internationals which exclude\r\nthe Negro by constitutional provision, there are other locals which are\r\nknown to reject Negro applicants. The Machinists' Union, for example,\r\nalthough complying in its constitution with the American Federation of\r\nLabor policy of no racial discrimination, still effectually bars the\r\nNegro by a provision in its secret ritual. With the Machinists' Union\r\nmust be grouped such unions as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers'\r\nInternational Alliance, the Electrical Workers, and the Plumbers and\r\nSteam Fitters.\r\n\r\nSome Negro leaders, in view of these practices, have been strong in\r\ntheir advocacy of non-affiliation with union organizations, holding that\r\nthe employers, after all, offer for Negroes the fairer terms, and that\r\nthey have, in fact, given Negroes their first opportunity in industry.\r\nHowever, certain other Negroes have taken advantage of the rift between\r\nemployers and labor unions to exploit Negro laborers. They have played\r\nupon racial sentiment to establish separate unions for Negroes, both\r\nin lines of work where they are admitted to the general unions and in\r\nlines of work where they are excluded. This type of leadership has been\r\nirresponsible and dangerous; it has made ridiculously generous promises,\r\nand has addressed its appeal to the less intelligent classes of Negro\r\nworkers. Its literature has in turn provoked extreme bitterness among\r\nlabor union members and officials, who have mistakenly accepted it as\r\nrepresentative of the sentiment of all Negro workers.\r\n\r\nInterviews with Negro workers outside of the unions reveal an attitude\r\nof indifference or suspicion which is attributed by both white and Negro\r\nlabor leaders and union men to the following reasons: (1) the usual\r\ntreatment of Negroes by white men, (2) traditional treatment of Negroes\r\nby white men, (3) influence of racial leaders who oppose unionism, (4)\r\ninfluence of employers' propaganda against unionism. Many of them, it\r\nwas learned, have a distorted view of the purposes and principles of\r\nunionism, and many others, while sympathetic with the movement, object\r\nto the practices of the locals. An experience frequently referred to was\r\nthe waiters' strike in 1911, when Negro union men walked out with white\r\nunion men and were replaced by white girls, while the white union men\r\nreturned to their jobs; since that time Negro waiters have been out of\r\nthe more desirable hotel jobs.\r\n\r\nThe explanations by labor leaders of the practices of local unions are\r\nto the effect that while the general public race prejudice might be\r\nexpected in organizations of white workingmen, the unions, as a group,\r\nare fairer to the Negro than other groups; that unions are blamed for\r\nconditions which are really due to general public opinion. They cite\r\nas an example the fact that Negroes are not employed in Chicago as\r\nmotormen or conductors on the surface or elevated lines because of\r\npublic objection, and that they cannot be organized until they are in\r\npositions. Views were also expressed in condemnation of the exclusion\r\npolicy of one local. These union officials believe that the unions will\r\neventually be the most powerful agencies in the removal of race prejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. PUBLIC OPINION IN RACE RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA. OPINIONS OF WHITES AND NEGROES\r\n\r\nThe \"Negro problem\" is deeper and wider than the difficulties which center\r\nabout the more specialized problems of Negro housing, Negro crime, and\r\nindustrial relations involving Negroes. All such special studies conducted\r\nby the Commission left a baffling residuum of causes of racial discord,\r\ndeep rooted in the psychology of the white and Negro groups in contact.\r\nThe beliefs and attitudes, firmly fixed and accepted prejudices of the\r\none race as to the other, grouped under the term \"public opinion,\" thus\r\nbecame the subject of a novel but most interesting inquiry.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion with respect to the Negro forms a body of sentiment so\r\ndefinite and compact as to make it an excellent laboratory case for\r\nanalysis and study; but the Commission's aim in investigating it was\r\nmerely to make apparent and objective its place and importance in race\r\nrelations; to indicate some of the ways in which it has developed; how\r\nit expresses itself; how it affects both the white and Negro groups;\r\nhow, in its present state, it is strengthened, weakened, polluted, or\r\npurified by deliberate agencies or even by its own action; and finally\r\nhow it may be used to reduce, if not prevent, racial unfriendliness and\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is regarded here as a phase of the social mind, but\r\nnevertheless as a definite reality. For purposes of examination,\r\ntherefore, its study gives attention to that body of sentiments, beliefs,\r\nattitudes, and prejudices which, taken together, give to public opinion\r\nits content and meaning.\r\n\r\nTo present this subject intelligently, the following plan has been\r\nemployed:\r\n\r\n1. Beliefs and sophistications regarding Negroes, which exercise so great\r\nan influence in determining the conduct of white persons in relation to\r\nthem, are described as they apply in the local environment, and in origin\r\nand background are traced suggestively to their responsible sources in\r\nliterature and circumstance.\r\n\r\n2. Types of sentiment which, in Chicago and similar northern communities,\r\nare variants of these basic beliefs are presented with a view to making\r\nthem intelligible and classifying them according to resolvable factors\r\nof misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n3. Since personal attitudes and beliefs are molded by traditions\r\nand heritages apart from the exclusive influence of literature, more\r\nsignificant material collected through intimate inquiry is presented\r\nobjectively to describe the processes by which they appear to be created\r\nand grow. Replies to a searching questionnaire on attitudes and opinions\r\nare, in the instances quoted, the result of painstaking self-analysis.\r\n\r\n4. The opinions and sentiments of Negroes on these same issues are\r\ndescribed and illustrated with a view to making them understandable,\r\nand their interpretations of current white sentiment are explained as\r\nfar as possible.\r\n\r\n5. The report then turns to the agencies by which these opinions are\r\nmade and perpetuated and the individual attitudes created. The chief of\r\nthese are: (_a_) the press, (_b_) rumors, (_c_) myths, (_d_) propaganda.\r\nThe conscious and unconscious abuse of these instruments of \"opinion\r\nmaking\" is pointed out and explained.\r\n\r\n6. Finally, the study is intended to suggest means by which public\r\nopinion, where it is faulty, may correct itself and employ its own\r\ninstruments in the creation of wholesome sentiments among Negroes with\r\nrespect to whites, and among whites with respect to Negroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BELIEFS OF WHITES CONCERNING NEGROES\r\n\r\nThe conduct of individuals is largely determined by their attitudes toward\r\na subject and their general beliefs concerning it. Definite beliefs\r\nconcerning Negroes may be found in the North as well as in the South,\r\nvarying with the individuals who hold them, according to degrees of\r\ncontact with the Negro group and the individuals' traditional background.\r\nThese may be divided according to their character and effect into two\r\ngeneral classes: (_a_) primary beliefs or those fundamental and firmly\r\nestablished convictions which have, all around, the deepest effect on\r\nthe conduct of whites toward Negroes and are pretentiously supported\r\nby statistics, authorities, and scientific research; (_b_) secondary\r\nbeliefs, or modifications and variants of important assumptions as to\r\ncardinal attributes.\r\n\r\n_a_) _Primary beliefs._--Among these primary beliefs are the following:\r\n\r\n1. Mentality: That the mind of the Negro is distinctly and distinctively\r\ninferior to that of the white race. Some believe that this is due to\r\nbackwardness in ascending the scale of civilization; some that the Negro\r\nbelongs to a different species of the human family.\r\n\r\n2. Morality: That Negroes are not yet capable of exercising social\r\nrestraints common to white persons; that they are unmoral as well as\r\nimmoral.\r\n\r\n3. Criminality: That Negroes possess a constitutional character weakness,\r\nand a consequent predisposition to sexual crimes, petty stealing, and\r\ncrimes of violence.\r\n\r\n4. Physical unattractiveness: That physical laws prompt whites to avoid\r\ncontact with Negroes.\r\n\r\n5. Emotionality: That Negroes are highly emotional and for that reason\r\nare given to quick, uncalculated crimes of violence as easily as to\r\nnoisy and emotional religious expressions.\r\n\r\n_b_) _Secondary beliefs._--As continued repetition of any plausible\r\nstatement without correction of its error eventually gives it credence,\r\nthese secondary beliefs have rooted themselves deep in the public\r\nmind. Among other things it is believed that Negroes are: (1) lazy, (2)\r\n\"happy-go-lucky,\" (3) boisterous, (4) bumptious, (5) over-assertive, (6)\r\nlacking in civic consciousness, (7) addicted to carrying razors, (8)\r\nfond of shooting craps, (9) flashy in dress and like gaudy, brilliant\r\ncolors, especially red.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. BACKGROUND OF PREVAILING BELIEFS CONCERNING NEGROES\r\n\r\nSoon after the first emergence of Negroes from slavery their illiteracy\r\nand general behavior in response to the novel experience of freedom\r\ncreated situations which appeared to justify judgments concerning their\r\ngroup traits. Scholars rationalized and tried to explain these apparent\r\ntraits: If they were illiterate as a group they must be incapable of\r\nlearning, and if they committed crimes, they must be fundamentally\r\nlacking in social restraints.\r\n\r\nDr. Jeffries Wyman, of Harvard, Professor A. H. Keene, author of _Man\r\nPast and Present_, Dr. J. C. Nott, author of _Types of Mankind_, and\r\nalmost all the other anthropologists of that period, gave the stamp of\r\nscientific authority to the view that Negroes were of a different species\r\nand could never reach the level of the Caucasian. Even more recently\r\nmental tests were carried out on the same assumption and were made to\r\nprove it in some instances where the facts were unexpectedly contrary.\r\nStudents of the race problem in the South continued to generalize about\r\nNegro character from selected specimens, other more popular writers and\r\nspeakers, with their anecdotes, stories, and jokes, all of which went\r\nuncorrected, tended to strengthen this body of beliefs to a point where\r\nany difference of views was intolerable. Although the status of the Negro\r\nhas changed, the beliefs remain the same, and have led to bitterness and\r\nresentment among Negroes, with consequent misunderstandings and friction.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago sentiments collected from a wide variety of sources and\r\ninvolving the views of several thousands of white persons indicate the\r\npersistence of these archaic beliefs and fears, so deep set and of such\r\nlong standing that they are assumed by many persons to be instinctive.\r\n\r\nTo secure definite information upon the traditional background of beliefs\r\nconcerning Negroes, fifteen white persons with no special interest in\r\nNegroes were selected at random from professions, business, and other\r\nvocations and submitted to a careful and searching inquiry. They were\r\nasked eighteen carefully prepared questions to draw out the raw material\r\nof their unqualified reactions on the question of the Negro and, as far\r\nas possible, the background in their early experience. They were asked\r\nfor their opinions concerning Negroes, whether or not they believed\r\nthat they possessed distinguishing traits of mentality and character;\r\ntheir attitudes were solicited by questions and propositions designed\r\nto provoke an expression of attitude. Questions were put regarding\r\ninstances and experiences involving Negroes in their early experience;\r\ntheir first consciousness of racial differences; their first contacts;\r\nand information was sought on the definite sources of their knowledge\r\nor opinions concerning Negroes.\r\n\r\nAll the persons questioned had clear-cut opinions and thought that Negroes\r\npossessed distinguishing traits ranging from \"affectionate loyalty\" to\r\n\"mental and moral handicaps imposed by evolution.\" An abolitionist's\r\nson, for example, thought that \"Negroes should desire segregation\";\r\na man who had observed Negroes at Tuskegee and Lewis institutes would\r\nincrease their education and meet the demands produced by education.\r\nOne whose only contact had been with his \"black mammy\" thought that\r\nthe Negroes were \"affectionate and loyal, but lacking in racial pride,\r\nthough evolutionarily handicapped, possessing the qualities of children.\"\r\nAnother who had had an unfortunate experience with his Negro chauffeur\r\nthought that Negroes were characterized by \"distinctly inferior\r\nmentality, deficient moral sense, shiftlessness, good-natured, and a happy\r\ndisposition.\" They knew little about the activities of Negroes, their\r\nleaders, their papers, or their problems, and the sources on which they\r\nrelied for their information, except in two instances, were undependable.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. NEGRO OPINION\r\n\r\nNegroes, although exposed to various forms of social contact, have been\r\nintellectually isolated from the white group. They have not participated\r\nfully and freely in community and cultural activities. The pressure\r\nof the white group in practically every ordinary experience has kept\r\ntheir attention and interest centered upon themselves, and they have\r\nbecome race conscious. Their thinking, therefore, on general questions,\r\nwhether they involve race relations or not, is conditioned and largely\r\ncontrolled by the relation of these questions with group interests. The\r\nopinions of Negroes, therefore, on race relations are largely negative.\r\nWhite persons know very little about what Negroes are thinking, because\r\nthey are not familiar with their experiences; they frequently do not\r\naccredit them with the sensibilities that they do possess; and are not\r\nacquainted with the processes of thought by which the opinions of Negroes\r\nare formed. Thus it is that many of the statements and expressions of\r\nfeeling of Negroes are unintelligible to persons outside of their group.\r\nSimilarly, many statements and expressions of feeling by white persons\r\nare unintelligible to Negroes. But in the understanding of white persons\r\nNegroes have the advantage, because they do read their papers, see them\r\nin the privacy of their homes, and are forced constantly to interpret\r\ntheir actions.\r\n\r\nAmong Negroes there may be found a group control as strong and binding\r\nas among white persons. One striking instance of the operation of this\r\ngroup control was the complete ostracism of a prominent Negro lawyer who\r\nwas reported to have made a public statement contrary to the views and\r\naspirations held by his group. When this Negro was reported in the press\r\nto have said, \"This is a white man's country, and Negroes had better\r\nbehave or they will get what rights they have taken away,\" he was first\r\nsnubbed, then his life was threatened, and for several weeks he was\r\nforced to go about under police protection. He was seriously criticized\r\nand finally ostracized. In less than a year he died. His friends declare\r\nthat he was slanderously misquoted.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of Negroes fall into somewhat the same classification as\r\nthose of whites, but with one or two notable exceptions: there is (1) more\r\ndiscussion of race problems, more criticism of the conduct of leaders,\r\nmore discussion of the practicability of programs of action; and (2) a\r\ngreat deal of literature and other expressions concerning the development\r\nof a defensive philosophy. In this latter are included various defensive\r\npolicies, the stimulation of race pride, the explanation of behavior, and\r\nthe struggle for status. There might also be included frequent evidences\r\nof the development of race consciousness. The emotional background,\r\nclass consciousness, and the influences of group control are as evident\r\nin the sentiments of Negroes as of white persons.\r\n\r\nA wide selection of views was obtained from Negroes and presented\r\nunder the classifications in which they appeared naturally to fall.\r\nTo get a more precise statement of views, a questionnaire was sent to\r\nNegroes representing a class intellectually able to subject themselves\r\nto self-analysis and to discuss various confusing angles of the race\r\nquestion. They were asked concerning interracial problems; whether or\r\nnot race relations appear to be growing better or worse; whether the\r\nacquisition of wealth, or 100 per cent literacy, or unrestricted suffrage\r\ncould affect race relations; they were asked questions concerning their\r\nadjustment to the present social system, their most pronounced mental\r\ncomplexes experienced in adjusting personal desires to the present social\r\nsystem; whether they were prejudiced against white persons; whether or\r\nnot they were conscious of a feeling of race inferiority, or of a desire\r\nto compensate for a supposed inferiority. Concerning Negro problems\r\nthey were asked whether or not there should be recognized leaders of\r\nNegroes; their criticisms of the policies of Negro leaders. Their racial\r\nphilosophy was solicited. They were asked the distinction that they made\r\nbetween segregation and racial solidarity, and information was sought\r\non the agencies responsible for their opinions. A most interesting array\r\nof views was secured, ranging from suspicion and abuse of the questions\r\nthemselves to dispassionate analysis.\r\n\r\nThe war has produced a new type of sentiment. It not only brought\r\ndisappointment and disillusionment for Negroes led into a new hope by the\r\npromises that accompanied the manifest efforts to stimulate patriotism,\r\nbut actually gave to Negroes new experiences. Following the return of\r\nNegro soldiers from France, measures of restraint were increased, and\r\nfrom the usual lawlessness of the period of reconstruction they probably\r\nsuffered more severely than others because they are to a much larger\r\nextent dependent upon law enforcement for security and comfort. Race\r\nriots, which are an expression of both loose machinery of community\r\ncontrol and the development of a more determined resistance on the part of\r\nNegroes, grew more frequent in number and more serious in consequences.\r\nA new note was sounded in radical Negro literature, which appeared to\r\ncarry a very popular appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. FACTORS IN THE MAKING OF PUBLIC OPINION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE WHITE PRESS OF CHICAGO\r\n\r\nAside from the agencies ordinarily responsible for providing the\r\nindividual with his views, there are others equally as powerful in\r\ndeveloping and influencing opinions. Most important of these is the\r\npress. For that portion of the public which depends upon the press for\r\nits contact with the Negro group and its information concerning it, this\r\nagency holds a controlling hand. Throughout the country it is pointed\r\nout, by both whites and Negroes, that the policies of many newspapers on\r\nracial matters have made relations more difficult, at times fostering\r\nnew antagonisms and even precipitating riots by inflaming the white\r\npublic against Negroes. A study was made of the three principal white\r\ndaily newspapers of Chicago, covering a two-year period. Included in this\r\nstudy were 1,347 news items, 108 letters to the press, and ninety-six\r\neditorials on the Negro.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the type of publicity given to racial news concerning\r\nNegroes and the types of articles considered to have good news value,\r\nof the 1,338 articles published, 606, or nearly 50 per cent, dealt with\r\nriots, crime, and vice. Each of these articles specifically identified\r\nthe persons involved as Negroes.\r\n\r\nConstant identification of Negroes with certain definite crimes could have\r\nno other effect than to stamp the entire Negro group in the public mind\r\nas generally criminal. This in turn contributes to the already existing\r\nbelief that Negroes as a group are more likely to be criminal than others,\r\nand thus they are arrested more readily than others. Publication of\r\ntheir names with race identification and with the crimes alleged against\r\nthem keeps up a vicious circle. The unfortunate emphasis on sex offenses\r\ninvolving race, the subtle fanning of latent animosities by innuendo and\r\nsuggestion, attaching the crime not only to the individual but to the\r\nrace, direct a current of fear, intolerance, and ill will against the\r\nwhole Negro group. An apt illustration, frequently cited by Negroes, is\r\nthat if each time a crime was committed by a red-headed man, he was so\r\ndescribed in telling of his crime, a popular fear and prejudice would\r\nsoon develop against all red-headed men.\r\n\r\nCrimes involving Negroes alone receive little attention. As with the\r\nItalians, as long as crimes are committed within the group, and this group\r\nis regarded as an isolated appendix of the community, they hold very\r\nlittle news value. When, however, a member of the isolated group comes\r\ninto conflict with the community group, whether in industry, housing,\r\nor any relation, its representative significance is thus established,\r\nand the information becomes news. Publicity on housing, for example,\r\nstresses the conflict with other neighborhoods, the \"invasion\" of white\r\ndistricts, and plans for segregation. News items on politics involving\r\nNegroes get more space and prominence when they describe graft and\r\ncorruption. In the list of articles studied are included sixty-three\r\narticles particularly ridiculing the Negro group.\r\n\r\nIncidents occurring during the activities of the Commission were\r\nchecked up with reports of them appearing in the papers, and serious\r\nmisrepresentations of the Negro group were revealed. One example was\r\nan article in the _Herald-Examiner_ on January 4, 1920, with two-inch\r\nheadlines across the entire first page: \"Reds Plot Negro Revolt,\" \"I.W.W.\r\nBomb Plant Found on South Side.\" The article mentioned the alleged secret\r\nactivities of Negroes and their plans to revolt against the government.\r\nThe bomb plant and many of their secret plans were reported to have\r\nbeen discovered by the state's attorney. The article further said: \"In\r\nChicago it was learned that the headquarters for Negro revolutionary\r\npropaganda are centered in these four organizations: the Free Thought\r\nSociety, Universal Negro Improvement Association, Negro Protective\r\nLeague, and the Soldiers and Sailors Club.\" The article and the reported\r\n\"discoveries\" of the state's attorney's office are evidence of the\r\nabsurd ignorance frequently manifested by members of the white group\r\nconcerning the activities of Negroes. Each of the organizations named was\r\nknown to the Commission and visited by its representatives on numbers of\r\noccasions. All of their meetings are open to the public, though attended\r\nalmost entirely by Negroes. The Universal Negro Improvement Association\r\npublishes all of its plans in its newspaper, the _Negro World_. Its\r\nslogan is \"Back to Africa\" and not \"Down with the United States.\" The\r\nFree Thought Society mentioned is an organization designed to provide a\r\nmedium of expression for persons who seek the \"attainment of truth.\" Its\r\ndiscussions concern religion and philosophy, and it numbers among its\r\nmembers prominent Negro and white professional men. The Negro Protective\r\nLeague is an employment office and day nursery. The full name of the\r\norganization is the \"Negro Equal Rights and Protective Association.\" The\r\nSoldiers and Sailors Club is a community house located on the South Side\r\nand a branch of the local War Camp Community Service. Eugene T. Lies,\r\nformerly of the United Charities, was its director. The occasion of the\r\npublicity in question was a convention of a national Negro Greek-letter\r\nfraternity, which held its meetings in the auditorium of the Soldiers\r\nand Sailors Club. This fraternity, like all others of its kind, excluded\r\nnon-members and by so doing aroused the suspicion of the newspaper's\r\ninformants. No correction appeared in the paper, and to date no further\r\n\"discoveries\" have been made.\r\n\r\nArticles of this type illustrate the possible effect on the public mind\r\nof such misrepresentations of the Negro. One newspaper has abandoned its\r\npolicy of identifying Negroes with reports of incidents, in recognition\r\nof the gross unfairness of the practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE NEGRO PRESS\r\n\r\nThe development of the Negro press was stimulated by several necessities\r\nimportant among which were:\r\n\r\n_a_) The indifference of the white press to the Negro group; its emphasis\r\non the unfortunately spectacular, and the consequent loss of items of\r\ninterest about Negroes throughout the country.\r\n\r\n_b_) The importance of developing the morale of the Negro group, creating\r\na solidarity of interest and purpose for measures of defense, correcting\r\nthe impressions created by general opinion, and centering the attention\r\nof Negroes upon themselves and their advancement.\r\n\r\nThree of the most important local Negro weekly papers were studied.\r\nTheir news items showed bias in reporting just the reverse of that which\r\ncharacterizes the reports of many white papers. They emphasize the Negro's\r\nview and may be said to provide a compensatory interpretation of the\r\nnews. When, for example, the _Chicago Tribune_ reports the approval in\r\nthe Illinois Constitutional Convention of a civil-rights bill with the\r\nheadline: \"Miscegenation Is O.K.'d in New Constitution; Negroes Given All\r\nthe Rights of Whites,\" the _Chicago Whip_, a Negro newspaper, headlines\r\nthe same incident: \"Morris Gets Civil Rights into Constitution; Victory\r\nfor Race Won at Springfield.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important function exercised by the Negro press is its control\r\nof the Negro group and of their education in conduct. All of these papers\r\ngive considerable space to such popular education.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. RUMOR\r\n\r\nRumor, if unchecked, can do incalculable damage to race relations.\r\nIncluded under the term \"rumor\" are those unfounded tales, incorrectly\r\ndeduced conclusions, partial statements of fact with significant content\r\nadded by the narrator, all of which are given wide circulation and easy\r\ncredence by the public. Other forms of rumor are tales of unheard-of\r\nbrutality and of plots and plans which are either fabrications or partial\r\nstatements of fact and serve only to stimulate resentment, fear, and a\r\ndesire for retaliation. Of the rumors predicting riots, one example will\r\nillustrate: During the riot a white man was caught in the act of crawling\r\nbeneath a house in which Negroes lived. In his pocket was found a bottle\r\nof kerosene. He confessed that his mission was arson and justified his\r\nact by repeating to the police the current rumor that it was known that\r\nNegroes had set fire to the houses of whites \"back of the Yards.\"\r\n\r\nA persistent tale circulated during and for a long time after the riot\r\nwas to the effect that the bodies of hundreds of Negroes were taken\r\nfrom Bubbly Creek where they had been thrown after being killed by white\r\nrioters. The story was so frequently repeated that it was accepted and\r\neven repeated in Congress. It caused an intense feeling among Negroes.\r\nInvestigation by the coroner, Police Department, and other agencies showed\r\nthat no bodies had ever been thrown into Bubbly Creek or recovered from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA rumor given official sanction and carried into the files of the\r\nDepartment of Justice illustrates other possible dangers of this kind.\r\nThis rumor concerned two prominent and highly accredited organizations for\r\nNegroes. Rumors connected them with \"I.W.W. plots and plans to overthrow\r\nthe government.\" These reports were founded upon scarcely anything more\r\nthan suspicion due to lack of information and acquaintance with the\r\nNegro group. The National Urban League, for example, an organization of\r\nresponsible Negroes and whites with branches in thirty-one cities, was\r\nreported to have asked William D. Haywood, head of the I.W.W., to speak\r\nat its convention in Detroit. This report grew out of the misreading of\r\nthe name of William Hayward, a United States district attorney in New\r\nYork, who is a member of the executive board and whose name appears on\r\nthe stationery of the organization. The National Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Colored People, also a reputable organization of whites\r\nand Negroes, was reported to be \"planning to flood the colored districts\r\nwith I.W.W. literature.\" This was entirely false, but the reports went\r\nto the Department of Justice headquarters secretly and could not be\r\ncorrected by the persons most affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. MYTHS\r\n\r\nGroup myths, like those about the American Indian, the Oriental, and the\r\nJew, are very common. Usually they are the expression either of a wish\r\nor of fear, which sociologists call a negative wish. Mythical stories\r\nand anecdotes about Negroes, accepted by whites, are usually popular.\r\nMany of them may have had a reasonable origin, but as a matter of fact\r\nhave long outgrown it. So long as they are uncorrected they hold and\r\nexercise a marked degree of control over personal conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the category of myths fall the popular beliefs of whites concerning\r\nthe mentality of Negroes, and the more definite myth that the mind of\r\nthe Negro child ceases to develop when he reaches the age of puberty.\r\nThe sex myth is always in evidence. It involves the fear obsession\r\nof Negro men held by many white women, fear of miscegenation, the\r\ncondonation of lynchings, repressive social restrictions, as well as\r\nattempts at legislative restraints. Negroes are by these myths shown to\r\nhave a predilection for sex crimes. This sex myth has been stressed in\r\nalmost every riot. It precipitated the Washington riot; it provoked the\r\nmost brutal murder of the Chicago riot, and it was responsible for the\r\nbrutality of the Omaha and Tulsa riots. Always resident in the background\r\nof popular consciousness, it shows the same head and features in almost\r\nevery clash of races.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\nConscious control of public opinion by propaganda has been used with\r\ntremendous effect by social, political, and religious organizations\r\nseeking popularity and support for their movements and reforms. Both\r\nNegroes and whites employed propaganda, sometimes openly, sometimes\r\ninsidiously. Racial propaganda has probably a more powerful appeal than\r\nany other type because it is based upon the instinct of race and race\r\ndifferences, rivalry and jealousy. The most common forms of propaganda\r\nmay be classified into the following types: (_a_) educational, (_b_)\r\nradical and revolutionary, (_c_) defensive, (_d_) malicious.\r\n\r\nThe activities and programs of the National Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Colored People fall under the classification of educational\r\npropaganda; this propaganda is directed to the white public principally\r\nand is intended to change public opinion by providing a foundation of\r\nactual facts for the public's judgment.\r\n\r\nThe more striking examples of the radical and revolutionary propaganda are\r\nthe appeals sent out by the Industrial Workers of the World to Negroes,\r\ncarrying their doctrines and extending open arms to Negro workers and\r\noffering them what most other organizations refuse--the privilege of\r\nassociation and membership on the basis of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nDefensive propaganda is more apparent within the Negro group and is\r\nusually designed for the purpose of combating aggression and injury\r\nto their purposes and aspirations from without. The appeals of this\r\npropaganda are directed first to Negroes as a means of cementing the group\r\nfrom within, and indirectly to the white group by way of impressing them\r\nwith the strength of solidified opposition to insults. The Protective\r\nCircle of Chicago, organized to \"oppose segregation, bombing, and defiance\r\nof the Constitution,\" admitted employing propaganda to accomplish its\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMalicious propaganda is by far the most dangerous because it is founded\r\nupon race antagonism. In the appeal to the emotions facts are soon lost.\r\nAnti-Negro propaganda is not wholly new in the North, but when employed\r\nit has usually been done insidiously because \"Negro-baiting is considered\r\nin bad taste.\" Recently, however, there have been conspicuous instances\r\nof open and organized efforts to influence the minds of whites against\r\nNegroes. Ignorance and suspicion, fear and prejudice, have been played\r\nupon deliberately. The stated purpose of the propaganda was to unite white\r\nproperty owners in opposition to the \"invasion\" of other residential\r\nareas by Negroes, but in the actual carrying out of the propaganda it\r\nwas extended to all Negroes, and many methods were employed which could\r\nhave no other effect than to arouse bitterness and antagonism leading to\r\nclashes. The _Property Owners' Journal_, the organ of an association of\r\nreal estate men, became so violent in its preachments that the protest\r\nof whites forced its discontinuance. Appeals were made not only to the\r\ninstinct of race but to the sex instincts and the protective instincts of\r\nwhite men. A pamphlet sent to the wives of prominent residents in that\r\nneighborhood, entitled _An Appeal of White Women to American Humanity_,\r\nrecounted the \"horrible conduct of French Colonials on the Rhine and\r\nthe abuse of German white women,\" although there was little apparent\r\nconnection between the conduct of Chicago Negroes and that of the black\r\nsoldiers in the French Army of Occupation on the Rhine. This pamphlet,\r\nhowever, served to increase the fears of Negro men by white women and\r\nto arouse the resentment and hatred of white men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION\r\n\r\nMany of our citizens who were appalled by the rioting and murders of\r\n1919, feeling the need of a solution of the problem dealt with in this\r\ninvestigation, have hoped that this Commission might suggest some ready\r\nremedy, some quick means of assuring harmony between the races.\r\n\r\nCareful consideration of the facts set forth in this report shows that\r\nno such suggestion is possible. No one, white or Negro, is wholly free\r\nfrom an inheritance of prejudice in feeling and in thinking as to these\r\nquestions. Mutual understanding and sympathy between the races will be\r\nfollowed by harmony and co-operation. But these can come completely only\r\nafter the disappearance of prejudice. Thus the remedy is necessarily\r\nslow; and it is all the more important that the civic conscience of\r\nthe community should be aroused, and that progress should begin in a\r\ndirection steadily away from the disgrace of 1919.\r\n\r\nEach member of this Commission feels that he has more understanding and\r\nless prejudice than before its work began. Therefore we recommend the\r\nthoughtful examination of the body of this report, so that all who read\r\nour recommendations may weigh for themselves the evidence upon which\r\nthey are based.\r\n\r\nHaving in mind the basic facts in the problem of race relations and the\r\nconclusions from a careful study of the various phases of these relations\r\nin Chicago, the Commission presents for the consideration and action of\r\nstate and local authorities, and of the social agencies and citizens of\r\nChicago, the following recommendations and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Police, Militia, State's Attorney, and Courts:\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING OF RIOTS\r\n\r\n1. We recommend that the police and militia work out, at the earliest\r\npossible date, a detailed plan for joint action in the control of race\r\nriots.\r\n\r\n2. In accordance with such a plan, and in the event of race rioting,\r\nwe specifically recommend: (_a_) that the militia, white and Negro, be\r\npromptly mobilized at the beginning of the outbreak; (_b_) that police\r\nand deputy sheriffs and militia, white and Negro, be so distributed as\r\nadequately to protect both races in white and Negro neighborhoods and to\r\navoid the gross inequalities of protection which, in the riot of 1919,\r\npermitted widespread depredations, including murder, against Negroes in\r\nwhite neighborhoods, and attacks in Negro neighborhoods by invading white\r\nhoodlums; (_c_) that the police and militia be stationed with special\r\nreference to main street-car lines and transfer points used by Negroes\r\nin getting to and from work; (_d_) that substantial assurance be given\r\nof adequate and equal protection by all agencies of law enforcement,\r\nthus removing the incentive to arm in self-defense; (_e_) that in the\r\nappointment of special peace officers there shall be no discrimination\r\nagainst Negroes; (_f_) that all rioters, white and Negro, be arrested\r\nwithout race discrimination; (_g_) that all reports and complaints\r\nof neglect of duty or participation in rioting by police, deputy\r\nsheriffs, or militia be promptly investigated and the offenders promptly\r\npunished; (_h_) that all persons arrested in connection with rioting be\r\nsystematically booked on distinct charges showing such connection, in\r\norder to avoid the confusion and evasions of justice following the riot\r\nof 1919.\r\n\r\n3. We recommend that, without regard to color, all persons arrested\r\nin connection with rioting be promptly tried and the guilty speedily\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBINGS\r\n\r\n4. We recommend prompt and vigorous action by the police, state's\r\nattorney, and courts to suppress the bombings of Negro and white houses,\r\nthese acts being criminal and likely to provoke race rioting.\r\n\r\n5. The testimony of court officials before the Commission and its\r\ninvestigations indicate that Negroes are more commonly arrested, subjected\r\nto police identification, and convicted than white offenders, that on\r\nsimilar evidence they are generally held and convicted on more serious\r\ncharges, and that they are given longer sentences. We point out that\r\nthese practices and tendencies are not only unfair to Negroes, but weaken\r\nthe machinery of justice and, when taken with the greater inability\r\nof Negroes to pay fines in addition to or in lieu of terms in jail,\r\nproduce misleading statistics of Negro crime. We recognize that these\r\npractices and tendencies are in a large degree the unconscious results of\r\ntraditional race prejudice. We recommend to the police, state's attorney,\r\njudges, and juries that they consider these conditions in the effort to\r\ndeal fairly (and without discrimination) with all persons charged with\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n6. We recommend that, in order to encourage respect for law by both\r\nNegroes and whites, the courts discountenance the facetiousness which\r\nis too common in dealing with cases in which Negroes are involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICIOUS ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n7. We recommend that the police, state's attorney, and other authorities\r\npromptly rid the Negro residence areas of vice resorts, whose present\r\nexceptional prevalence in such areas is due to official laxity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICING OF PARKS AND BEACHES\r\n\r\n8. We recommend better co-operation between the city and park police in\r\nand near parks, bathing-beaches, and other public recreation places,\r\nespecially where there has been or is likely to be race friction; and\r\nin the speedy punishment of persons guilty of stoning houses, molesting\r\nindividuals, or committing other depredations calculated to arouse race\r\nantagonism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ATHLETIC CLUBS\"\r\n\r\n9. We recommend that the police pay particular and continuous attention\r\nto the so-called \"athletic clubs\" on the South Side, which we have found\r\nto be a fruitful source of race conflict, and that when race conflict\r\narises or is imminent the members and meeting places of such clubs be\r\nsearched for arms and that, if deemed necessary, such clubs be closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BARRETT MURDER\r\n\r\n10. We commend the police for the prompt and effective action in the\r\nBarrett murder case, September 20, 1920, which allayed public alarm and\r\naverted a serious clash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the City Council and Administrative Boards, the Park Boards and the\r\nMunicipal Bureau of Parks, Playgrounds, and Bathing-Beaches:\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROL OF FIREARMS\r\n\r\n11. We recommend that the most stringent means possible be applied to\r\ncontrol the importation, sale, and possession of firearms and other\r\ndeadly weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERVISION OF \"ATHLETIC CLUBS\"\r\n\r\n12. In order to facilitate police supervision of so-called \"athletic\r\nclubs,\" we recommend that all such clubs be required to file with the\r\ncity clerk statements of their purposes and, at stated intervals, lists\r\nof their members and officers, with their addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITATION\r\n\r\n13. We recommend that the authorities exercise their powers to condemn and\r\nraze all houses unfit for human habitation, many of which the Commission\r\nhas found to exist in the Negro residence areas on the South and West\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n14. We recommend better enforcement of health and sanitary laws and\r\nregulations in the care, repair, and upkeep of streets and alleys and\r\nthe collection and disposal of rubbish and garbage in areas of Negro\r\nresidence, where the Commission has found these matters to be shamefully\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECREATION CENTERS\r\n\r\n15. We recommend that the park and other proper authorities (_a_)\r\nput an end to the present gross discrimination by white persons which\r\npractically bars Negroes out of certain recreation centers near their\r\nown congested residence area; and (_b_) that a recreation center of\r\nadequate size and facilities be established for the use of both whites\r\nand Negroes in the principal Negro residence area of the South Side; and\r\n(_c_) that steps be taken to secure more adequately trained, competent,\r\nand intelligent playground and recreation-center directors, white and\r\nNegro, who shall be held responsible for racial clashes arising in places\r\nunder their direction and shall be required to interest themselves in\r\nreducing and avoiding racial friction in their neighborhoods; and (_d_)\r\nthat proper equipment and supervision be provided at the Twenty-sixth\r\nStreet Bathing-Beach, where they are now almost wholly lacking; and (_e_)\r\nthat, in co-operation with the city police, the park police adequately\r\nprotect all citizens, without regard to color, in going to and from\r\nparks, recreation centers, and playgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Board of Education:\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE SCHOOLS IN NEGRO AREAS\r\n\r\n16. We recommend that in the areas where the main part of the Negro\r\npopulation lives, and where elementary-school accommodations are notably\r\ndeficient, buildings, equipment, and teaching forces be provided which\r\nshall be at least equal to the average standard for the city, in order\r\nthat the present conditions of overcrowding, arrangement of pupils\r\nin shifts, and the assignment of too large classes to teachers may be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS\r\n\r\n17. We recommend the establishment of night schools and community centers\r\nin sections of the city not now adequately provided with such facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPULSORY EDUCATION\r\n\r\n18. Having found that many Negro children who quit school at an early\r\nage, as in the case of similar white children, appear later as criminals\r\nand delinquents, we urge strict enforcement of regulations as to working\r\npermits for such children, and we especially recommend that truant\r\nofficers give attention to school attendance by the children of Negro\r\nfamilies migrating here from the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF PRINCIPALS AND TEACHERS\r\n\r\n19. Since the attitude of principals and teachers vitally influences\r\nthe relations of white and Negro children in the public schools, we\r\nrecommend that special care be exercised in appointing principals and\r\nteachers who have a sympathetic and intelligent interest in promoting\r\ngood race relations in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDENT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n20. We recommend that public-school principals and teachers encourage\r\nparticipation by children of both races in student activities as a means\r\nof promoting mutual understanding and good race relations in such schools\r\nand in the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Social and Civic Organizations, Labor Unions, and Churches:\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMOTION OF RACE HARMONY\r\n\r\n21. Being convinced by our inquiry that much of the antagonism evinced in\r\nthe areas of marked hostility toward Negroes is founded upon tradition\r\nwhich is itself without foundation in fact or justice, we recommend to\r\nschools, social centers and agencies, churches, labor unions, and other\r\norganizations in these areas, and to public-spirited citizens, white\r\nand Negro, that they endeavor to dispel the false notions of each race\r\nabout the other and promote mutual tolerance and friendliness between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n22. We recommend that both white and Negro churches seek and use\r\nmeans to improve race relations, and that these means include the\r\nfinding of frequent occasion for having their congregations addressed\r\nby representatives of both races on the subject of race sympathy and\r\ntolerance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AGENCIES IN NEGRO COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\n23. We commend the course of such agencies as the United Charities,\r\nIllinois Children's Home and Aid Society, and American Red Cross in\r\nextending their work to the Negro community, and recommend that other\r\nagencies whose work is similarly useful extend their work in like manner.\r\n\r\n24. Recognizing and commending the practical efforts of the Interracial\r\nCommittee of the Woman's City Club, the Public Affairs Committee of the\r\nUnion League Club, and the Chicago Urban League, in promoting better\r\nrace relations, especially in the summer of 1920, when racial friction\r\nwas deemed imminent, we recommend that other organizations of the same\r\nkind undertake like activities.\r\n\r\n25. We recommend that the appropriate social agencies give needed\r\nattention to dealing extra-judicially with cases of Negroes coming before\r\nthe morals and juvenile courts; also to cases of Negro children dropping\r\nout of school too early in age.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY FOR RECREATION TRAINING\r\n\r\n26. We recommend that Negroes, as well as whites, be given opportunity\r\nfor training for service in the city's public recreation facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Public:\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERRACIAL TOLERANCE\r\n\r\n27. We are convinced by our inquiry: (_a_) that measures involving or\r\napproaching deportation or segregation are illegal, impracticable and\r\nwould not solve, but would accentuate, the race problem and postpone\r\nits just and orderly solution by the process of adjustment; (_b_) that\r\nthe moral responsibility for race rioting does not rest upon hoodlums\r\nalone, but also upon all citizens, white or black, who sanction force\r\nor violence in interracial relations or who do not condemn and combat\r\nthe spirit of racial hatred thus expressed; (_c_) that race friction\r\nand antagonism are largely due to the fact that each race too readily\r\nmisunderstands and misinterprets the other's conduct and aspirations.\r\n\r\nWe therefore urge upon all citizens, white and Negro, active opposition\r\nto the employment of force or violence in interracial relations and to the\r\nspirit of antagonism and hatred. We recommend dispassionate, intelligent,\r\nand sympathetic consideration by each race of the other's needs and\r\naims; we also recommend the dissemination of proved or trustworthy\r\ninformation about all phases of race relations as a useful means for\r\neffecting peaceful racial adjustment.\r\n\r\n28. Since rumor, usually groundless, is a prolific source of racial\r\nbitterness and strife, we warn both whites and Negroes against the\r\nacceptance or circulation by either of reports about the other whose\r\ntruth has not been fully established. We urge all citizens, white and\r\nNegro, vigorously to oppose all propaganda of malicious or selfish origin\r\nwhich would tend to excite race prejudice.\r\n\r\n29. We commend race contacts in cultural and co-operative efforts as\r\ntending strongly to mutual understanding and the promotion of good race\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n30. We condemn the provocation or fostering of race antagonism by\r\nassociations or organizations ostensibly founded or conducted for purposes\r\nof patriotism or local improvements or the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERMANENT RACE-RELATIONS BODY\r\n\r\n31. We recommend as of special importance that a permanent local body\r\nrepresenting both races be charged with investigating situations likely\r\nto produce clashes, with collecting and disseminating information tending\r\nto preserve the peace and allay unfounded fears, with bringing sound\r\npublic sentiment to bear upon the settlement of racial disputes, and\r\nwith promoting the spirit of interracial tolerance and co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the White Members of the Public:\r\n\r\n\r\nRACE ADJUSTMENT IN MIXED NEIGHBORHOODS\r\n\r\n32. We call to public attention the fact that intensity of racial feeling\r\nis not necessarily due to the presence of Negroes in a neighborhood,\r\neither in the majority or minority, and that such feeling is not the rule\r\nbut the exception; and we cite as a conspicuous example the peaceful\r\nconditions that have long obtained in the area between Roosevelt Road\r\nand Thirty-ninth Street from Wentworth Avenue to Lake Michigan, in which\r\nthe Negro population in 1920 numbered 54,906 and the white population\r\n42,797.\r\n\r\n\r\nBETTER NEGRO HOUSING WITHOUT SEGREGATION\r\n\r\n33. Our inquiry has shown that insufficiency in amount and quality of\r\nhousing is an all-important factor in Chicago's race problem; there\r\nmust be more and better housing to accommodate the great increase\r\nin Negro population which was at the rate of 148 per cent from 1910\r\nto 1920. This situation will be made worse by methods tending toward\r\nforcible segregation or exclusion of Negroes, such as the circulation\r\nof threatening statements and propaganda by organizations or persons\r\nto prevent Negroes from living in certain areas, and the lawless and\r\nperilous bombing of houses occupied by Negroes or by whites suspected\r\nof encouraging Negro residence in the district.\r\n\r\nWe therefore recommend that all white citizens energetically discourage\r\nthese futile, pernicious, and lawless practices, and either co-operate\r\nin or start movements to solve the housing problem by constructive and\r\nnot destructive methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPRECIATION AND PROPERTY RISKS\r\n\r\n34. Testimony before the Commission and investigations made by it show two\r\nimportant facts: (_a_) that depreciation of residence property generally\r\ncharged exclusively to the presence of Negroes in a neighborhood is\r\noften largely due to other factors; (_b_) that many Negroes of this city\r\nmeet their obligations in such a manner as to make their home-building\r\nand home-owning investments seem a more desirable risk than has been\r\ngenerally supposed. We therefore recommend that these facts be taken\r\ninto consideration in connection with loans on Negro property.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCED RENTS FOR NEGROES CONDEMNED\r\n\r\n35. We condemn and urge the discontinuance of the practice of property\r\nowners who arbitrarily advance rents merely because Negroes become\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION ABOUT NEGROES\r\n\r\n36. We recommend that white persons seek information from responsible\r\nand representative Negroes as the basis of their judgments about Negro\r\ntraits, characteristics, and tendencies, and thereby counteract the\r\ncommon disposition, arising from erroneous tradition and literature, to\r\nregard all Negroes as belonging to one homogeneous group and as being\r\ninferior in mentality and morality, given to emotionalism, and having\r\nan innate tendency toward crime, especially sex crime.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Negro Members of the Public:\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL DOCTRINES\r\n\r\n37. We recommend to Negroes the promulgation of sound racial doctrines\r\namong the uneducated members of their group, and the discouragement of\r\npropaganda and agitators seeking to inflame racial animosity and incite\r\nNegroes to violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPORT OF SOCIAL AGENCIES\r\n\r\n38. We urge Negroes to contribute more freely of their money and personal\r\neffort to the social agencies developed by public-spirited members of\r\ntheir group; also to contribute to the general social agencies of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n39. We recommend that the Negro community, through the extension or\r\nestablishment of the necessary social agencies, undertake to supply\r\nmeans and encouragement for leisure activities, and undertake work among\r\nNegro boys and girls along the lines of prevention of vice and crime;\r\nalso that it provide institutional care of dependent Negro children.\r\n\r\n40. We particularly urge that Negroes vigorously and continuously protest\r\nagainst the presence in their residence areas of any vicious resort,\r\nand that they join in and support all efforts to suppress such places.\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUSTMENT OF MIGRANTS\r\n\r\n41. We commend the important work done by the Chicago Urban League, the\r\nNegro churches, and other organizations in facilitating the adjustment\r\nof migrant Negroes from the South to the conditions of living in Chicago\r\nand urge its extension. We also commend the work already done by Negroes\r\nthrough community associations in bettering the appearance and sanitary\r\ncondition of housing and recommend its further extension.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACE PRIDE\r\n\r\n42. While we recognize the propriety and social values of race pride\r\namong Negroes, we warn them that thinking and talking too much in terms\r\nof race alone are calculated to promote separation of race interests\r\nand thereby to interfere with racial adjustment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Employers and Labor Organizations:\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE TOWARD NEGRO WORKERS\r\n\r\n43. We have found that in struggles between capital and labor Negro\r\nworkers are in a position dangerous to themselves and to peaceful\r\nrelations between the races, whether the issues involve their use by\r\nemployers to undermine wage standards or break strikes, or efforts by\r\norganized labor to keep them out of certain trades while refusing to admit\r\nthem to membership in the unions in such trades. We feel that unnecessary\r\nracial bitterness is provoked by such treatment of Negro workers, that\r\nracial prejudice is played upon by both parties, and that through such\r\npractices injury comes, not alone to Negroes, but to employers and labor\r\norganizations as well.\r\n\r\nWe therefore recommend to employers that they deal with Negroes as workmen\r\non the same plane as white workers; and to labor unions that they admit\r\nNegroes to full membership whenever they apply for it and possess the\r\nqualifications required of white workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRO AND WHITE WORKERS\r\n\r\n44. We commend to the attention of employers who fear clashes or loss of\r\nwhite workers by taking on Negro workers the fact that in 89 per cent\r\nof the industries investigated by this Commission, Negroes were found\r\nworking in close association with white employees, and that friction\r\nbetween these elements had rarely been manifested.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEGROES\r\n\r\n45. In view of the limited field of employment within which Negroes are\r\nrestricted we recommend that employers in all lines enlarge that field\r\nand permit Negroes an equal chance with whites to enter all positions\r\nfor which they are qualified by efficiency and merit. In this connection\r\nespecial attention is called to the fact that opportunity is generally\r\ndenied to Negroes for gaining experience in business methods through\r\nservice in responsible positions in business houses. Such opportunities,\r\nif made available for them, would not only be of benefit to Negroes in the\r\ndevelopment of sounder business methods among them and the building up of\r\ntheir resources, but would also be a gain to the business establishments\r\nand the community at large.\r\n\r\n46. We have found that Negroes are denied equal opportunity with whites\r\nfor advancement and promotion where they are employed. As a measure of\r\njustice we urge that Negroes be employed, advanced, and promoted according\r\nto their capacities and proved merit. We call to the attention of those\r\nconcerned the high qualifications of many Negro workers in sleeping-car\r\nand dining-car service, and recommend that when they deserve it and the\r\nopportunity offers, they be made eligible for promotion to positions as\r\nconductors and stewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT OF NEGROES AS STRIKE BREAKERS\r\n\r\n47. We point out as an injustice and a cause of racial antagonism the\r\npractice of some employers who having hired Negroes as strike breakers\r\ndischarge them when the strike is settled to make places for former\r\nwhite employees.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRO WOMEN WORKERS\r\n\r\n48. We find that employment of Negro girls at a smaller wage than white\r\ngirls and the denial to them of apprenticeship opportunities are a cause\r\nof racial antagonism. We therefore recommend that the employment of\r\nNegro girls be based on merit, with equality of wages, piece rates, and\r\napprenticeship opportunities with white girls; we also recommend that\r\nNegroes in domestic employment rendering the same quality of service as\r\nwhites be paid at the same rate as white domestics.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACIAL PEACE IN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n49. Realizing that the common welfare is involved in the employment or\r\nnon-employment of Negro workers, and seeking means to preserve racial\r\npeace in industry, we recommend: (_a_) that where Negro employees are\r\ndismissed for unsatisfactory service other Negroes, recommended by\r\nreliable Negro organizations, be given an opportunity to replace them;\r\n(_b_) that in times of industrial depression, employers reduce their\r\nforces in such a manner that the hardships of unemployment may not be\r\ndisproportionately severe on Negro workers; (_c_) that where Negroes\r\nare employed with whites at the same tasks they be given equal pay for\r\nequal work and equal opportunity for piecework and overtime work; (_d_)\r\nthat Negro workers be given opportunity for advancement and promotion\r\naccording to merit and efficiency and without race discrimination; (_e_)\r\nthat Negro workers be afforded the opportunity to learn and engage in\r\nthe skilled processes of their employment; (_f_) that superintendents\r\nclosely supervise the relations of foremen with Negro workers and see\r\nthat there is no racial injustice or discrimination; (_g_) that employers\r\ngenerally deal with Negroes, whether engaged in, or seeking opportunity\r\nto engage in, manual labor or clerical work, without discrimination as\r\nto race, and apply to them the same tests and conditions as to white\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPARATE LABOR UNIONS\r\n\r\n50. We strongly condemn the efforts of self-seeking agitators, Negro\r\nor white, who use race sentiment to establish separate unions in trades\r\nwhere existing unions admit Negroes to equal membership with whites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Negro Workers:\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH UNIONS\r\n\r\n51. We recommend that qualified Negro workers desiring membership in\r\nlabor organizations join unions which admit both races equally, instead\r\nof organizing separate Negro labor unions.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH EMPLOYERS\r\n\r\n52. We recommend that Negroes completely abandon the practice of seeking\r\npetty advance payments on wages and the practice of laying off work\r\nwithout good cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEARNING TRADES\r\n\r\n53. We recommend that Negroes avail themselves wherever possible of\r\nopportunities in apprentice schools and classes.\r\n\r\n54. We recommend to all Negroes dependent on manual labor the learning\r\nof some skilled trade even though there is no present opportunity to\r\nengage in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Street-Car Companies:\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF PASSENGERS\r\n\r\n55. In view of the large number of racial assaults on persons riding\r\nin street cars, we recommend that conductors and motormen be specially\r\ninstructed concerning protection of passengers, white and Negro, and be\r\nrigidly held to the discharge of this duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERCROWDING\r\n\r\n56. We recommend that at all loading-points where whites and Negroes\r\nboard cars in large numbers, starters be employed and overcrowding be\r\nprevented as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Restaurants, Theaters, Stores, and Other Places of Public Accommodation:\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUAL RIGHTS IN PUBLIC PLACES\r\n\r\n57. We point out that Negroes are entitled by law to the same treatment\r\nas other persons in restaurants, theaters, stores, and other places of\r\npublic accommodation, and we urge that owners and managers of such places\r\ngovern their policies and actions and their employees accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Press:\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING OF NEWS INVOLVING NEGROES\r\n\r\n58. In view of the recognized responsibility of the press in its general\r\ninfluence upon public opinion concerning Negroes--especially important\r\nas related to the suppression of race rioting--we recommend: (_a_) that\r\nthe newspapers generally, including the foreign-language press, apply\r\nthe same standards of accuracy, fairness, and sense of proportion, with\r\navoidance of exaggeration, in publishing news about Negroes as about\r\nwhites; in this connection special attention is called to the fact that\r\nemphasis, greatly out of proportion to that given their creditable acts,\r\nis frequently placed on the crimes and misdeeds of Negroes, who, unlike\r\nother groups, are identified with each incident and thus constantly\r\nassociated with discreditable conduct; (_b_) that the manner of news\r\ntreatment be no different in the case of Negroes than in that of whites,\r\nto the end that there shall always be the unwritten assumption that the\r\nsame responsibility for equal consideration of the rights of the one by\r\nthe other rests on whites and Negroes alike, in respect of the matter\r\ninvolved in the publication; (_c_) that, in consideration of the great\r\nease with which the public is influenced against the whole Negro group\r\nby sensational articles and headlines, the press should exercise great\r\ncaution in dealing with unverified reports of crimes of Negroes against\r\nwhite women, and should avoid the designation of trivial fights as race\r\nriots; (_d_) that in recognition of the dangers of racial antagonism\r\non the part of the ignorant, the unthinking, and the prejudiced of both\r\nraces, publication be made, as opportunities offer, of such matters as\r\nshall in their character tend to dispel prejudice and promote mutual\r\nrespect and good will.\r\n\r\nWe specially recommend more frequent publications concerning: (1)\r\ncreditable achievements of consequence by Negroes; (2) their efforts\r\ntoward a higher cultural and social life, and (3) their improvement of the\r\nphysical conditions of their own communities; (4) the common obligation\r\nof all citizens of all races to recognize in their interrelations the\r\nsupreme duty of strict obedience to the law, in spirit as well as in\r\ndeed; (5) verification, so far as practicable, of all news concerning\r\nNegroes and their activities by reference to recognized Negro agencies\r\nor responsible representative Negroes.\r\n\r\nWe further recommend the capitalization of the word \"Negro\" in racial\r\ndesignation, and avoidance of the word \"nigger,\" as contemptuous and\r\nneedlessly provocative.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING OF NEWS INVOLVING NEGROES AND WHITES\r\n\r\n59. To the Negro press we recommend greater care and accuracy in reporting\r\nincidents involving whites and Negroes, the abandonment of sensational\r\nheadlines and articles on racial questions, and more attention to\r\neducating Negro readers as to the available means and opportunities of\r\nadjusting themselves and their fellows into more harmonious relations\r\nwith their white neighbors and fellow-citizens, and as to the lines of\r\nindividual conduct and collective effort which will tend to minimize\r\ninterracial friction, promote their own social and economic development,\r\nand hasten interracial adjustment.\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, December 6, 1921\r\n\r\n     ROBERT S.

The cases listed in this\r\ncategory do not include all those due to mob violence, but only those\r\nqualified as stated:\r\n\r\n     1. Eugene Williams\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of death                   July 27\r\n        Approximate time of death       Probably 4:00 P.M.\r\n        Place where death occurred      Lake Michigan at foot of Twenty-\r\n                                          ninth Street\r\n        Manner in which death occurred  Drowning\r\n\r\nQuarrel arose on beach between Negroes and whites in regard to the use\r\nof the beach.

White passengers alighted, Negro passengers hid under seats. From\r\ntwenty-five to fifty white men boarded car and beat the Negroes with\r\nbats, clubs, bricks. Driven out from the refuge of the car, they ran for\r\ntheir lives, chased by the mob. Mills ran from Forty-seventh Street into\r\nNormal Avenue. A brick hit him in the back, halted him, and before he\r\ncould run again a young white man hit him on the head with a scantling.\r\nHe was left unconscious. Four other Negroes from this car were beaten\r\nbut not fatally.\r\n\r\n     3. Oscar Dozier\r\n        Race                                Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound       July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound       5:55 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound      Thirty-ninth Street and\r\n                                              Wallace Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                     Stabbing; external violence\r\n\r\nDozier worked for the Great Western Smelting and Refining Works. The\r\nforeman warned negroes not to try to go home till adequate protection\r\ncould be furnished. In spite of the warning Dozier was seen to crawl\r\nover the fence around the works at 5:45 P.M. He was next seen breaking\r\naway from a mob of 500 to 1,000 white men at Thirty-ninth Street and\r\nParnell Avenue. He ran west on Thirty-ninth toward Wallace, the crowd\r\nthrowing stones. Halfway down the block he fell. When rescued by the\r\npolice immediately afterward he was found to have a stab wound two inches\r\nlong over his heart.\r\n\r\n     4. Henry Goodman\r\n        Race                                Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound       July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound       7:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound      Thirty-ninth Street and\r\n                                              Union Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                     External violence\r\n\r\nGoodman, with other Negroes was returning from the Stock Yards on an\r\neast-bound Thirty-ninth Street car. A truck stalled across the track\r\nat Thirty-ninth Street and Union Avenue brought the car to a stop and\r\nallowed white men to force an entrance through the front door and beat\r\nthe Negroes off the rear of the car. The chief weapon was the iron lever\r\nused for opening the front door of the car. The Negroes tried to run east\r\nto Halsted Street where there were police officers. The crowd pursued,\r\nknocked Goodman down, and beat him. Apparently Goodman recovered from\r\nthe violence, but a week later it was necessary to remove him to the\r\nhospital, where a skull fracture, with a small pebble imbedded in the\r\nwound, was discovered. He died of tetanus on August 12. The wound was\r\nfirst treated by Dr. William W. Bradley on the evening the deceased\r\nwas injured. The coroner's jury said, \"Tetanus would probably not have\r\ndeveloped had the wound been thoroughly examined and properly cleaned.\"\r\n\r\n     5. Louis Taylor\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   9:40 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Root Street and Wentworth Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Scalp wounds; skull fracture due\r\n                                         to external violence\r\n\r\nTaylor, employed by the Chicago & Great Western Railway Co., had just\r\ncome off his run and was returning home on a south-bound Wentworth Avenue\r\ncar. Cars, both north and south bound, were attacked at Root Street\r\nand Wentworth Avenue by a mob of 100 white people armed with clubs and\r\nbricks. Taylor was found unconscious on the sidewalk, his watch and\r\nsuitcase missing, when the police arrived. He died August 1.\r\n\r\n     6. B. F.

At Forty-seventh Street some of these\r\nalighted. A mob of whites in the street saw the Negro and jerked the\r\ntrolley from the wire. The car came to a stop at Forty-sixth Place.\r\nWhite passengers in a panic demanded to be let off. When the front door\r\nwas opened Hardy tried to hide in their midst and leave the car. He\r\nwas seen by the waiting mob, knocked down, and pounded with fists until\r\nunconscious. He died the next day.\r\n\r\n     7. John Simpson\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   7:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Thirty-first Street between Wabash\r\n                                          Avenue and \"L\" alley\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nSeveral accounts have been given of the killing of Simpson. The coroner's\r\njury says: \"... Thirty-first Street near the said elevated station, being\r\nwell filled with a rioting and disorderly mob, mainly colored people,\r\na white man being pursued east on Thirty-first Street, at that time,\r\nand that deceased was a police officer of the City of Chicago, and was\r\nengaged as a police officer in preserving the peace in and about the\r\npoint indicated, and that a number of shots were fired from revolvers\r\nheld in hands of men unknown to this jury.\" Another account says Simpson\r\nwas shot by the Negro keeper of a poolroom on account of a previous\r\nquarrel. Simpson did not regain consciousness after being shot.\r\n\r\n     8. Henry Baker\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   10:00 or 11:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  544 East Thirty-seventh Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound in skull\r\n\r\nThe bullet which caused Baker's death was one of a number fired on the\r\nstreets at the time. Baker was not on the street but in a second-story\r\nwindow. It is not known whether this shot was one fired by white men from\r\na passing automobile or by one of a crowd of Negroes at Thirty-seventh\r\nStreet and Vincennes Avenue. The majority of witnesses gave the time\r\nof the shooting of Baker as 11:00 P.M., but the coroner in his report\r\nnames 10:00 P.M. as the hour.\r\n\r\n     9. David Marcus\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   9:30 or 10:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  511 East Thirty-seventh Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet\r\n\r\nOnly one eyewitness, a white companion of Marcus, testified. He said\r\na Negro walked up to Marcus and shot him. The witness stopped to pick\r\nup his friend, was advised by Negroes to get out of danger, but when\r\nhe persisted in lifting the wounded man, he himself received a bullet\r\nwound in the arm. A bullet also pierced the window of a laundry at this\r\ntime. The coroner gives the time of shooting as 8:45, though most of the\r\ntestimony seems to indicate that it occurred about fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes after the first shooting from automobiles which occurred at\r\napproximately 9:15 to 9:30. The police report gives 10:45 as the hour.\r\n\r\n     10. Eugene Temple\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   5:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  3642 South State Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Stab wound\r\n\r\nTemple, owner of a laundry at the above address, left his place of\r\nbusiness to enter his automobile which stood at the curb. His wife and\r\nanother young woman accompanied him but were the width of the sidewalk\r\nfrom him when he was attacked by three Negroes, robbed, and stabbed. The\r\nmurderers escaped in the crowd of Negroes which immediately gathered.\r\nIt was testified that Temple employed both Negroes and whites and had\r\nnever had any difficulties of a racial nature with his workers.\r\n\r\n     11.

An automobile\r\nbearing Otterson as a passenger turned from Thirty-fifth Street to go\r\nsouth on Wabash Avenue. One of the stones and bricks hurled at the motor\r\ncar hit Otterson on the head, and he immediately became unconscious. He\r\nwas seventy-four years old and a plasterer by trade.\r\n\r\n     12. Stefan Horvath\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving wound         9:00 or 9:35 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Root and South State streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nAt the time Horvath was shot, there was a crowd of fifty to seventy-five\r\nNegroes on the sidewalk, but only about three on the corner where the\r\nshooting occurred. The only eyewitness who testified was a policeman\r\nwho saw the shooting from a distance of 400 feet. The three Negroes ran\r\nafter firing the shot, and could not be found later.\r\n\r\n     13. Edward W. Jackson\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   9:00 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Fortieth and Halsted streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Shock and hemorrhage due to beating\r\n\r\nJackson had started to walk to work. At Fortieth and Halsted streets he\r\nwas attacked by four or five white men and beaten. He ran to Thirty-ninth\r\nStreet, where he was found by the police. No further information could\r\nbe obtained in this case.\r\n\r\n     14. Samuel Bass\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   Between 7:00 and 9:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Twenty-second and Halsted Sts.\r\n\t                                  or Union Ave.\r\n        Manner of wound                 External violence\r\n\r\nSamuel Bass, on account of the street-car strike, was walking the five\r\nand one-half miles from his work to his home when a gang of white men\r\nknocked him down three times, and cut gashes in his nose and cheeks\r\nwith their shoes. Bass hid behind freight cars till a Jewish peddler\r\ntook him in his cart to State Street. A doctor was visited, but when he\r\nlearned that Bass had no money, he turned him away without treatment. He\r\nwas picked up by a passing patrol and taken to the hospital, where his\r\ntreatment was cursory. Apparently he recovered, but in two weeks gave\r\nevidence of a hemorrhage on the brain from which he died September 5.\r\n\r\n     15. Joseph Lovings\r\n        Race                               Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound      July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound      About 8:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound     839 Lytle Street\r\n        Manner of wound                    Bullet wound, stab wounds,\r\n\t                                     skull fracture\r\n\r\nLovings, returning home from work on a bicycle, rode through an Italian\r\nneighborhood whose residents were much excited because it had been said\r\nearlier in the evening that a Negro employee of a mattress factory near-by\r\nhad shot a little Italian girl. A mob filled the streets when Lovings\r\nwas sighted. He tried to escape by running down an alley between Taylor\r\nand Gilpin streets, and then jumped back fences and hid in a basement.\r\nThe mob dragged him out, riddled his body with bullets, stabbed him, and\r\nbeat him. It was afterward rumored that his body had been burned after\r\nbeing saturated with gasoline. This was proved not to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Deaths due to circumstances creating no criminal responsibility:\r\n\r\n     1. Nicholas Kleinmark\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   About 6:58 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Thirty-eighth Place and Ashland\r\n\t                                  Boulevard\r\n        Manner of wound                 Stab wound\r\n\r\nScott, Brown, and Simpson, Negroes, were returning by street car from\r\nwork in the Stock Yards when the car was boarded by a mob of white men\r\nwho attacked the Negroes with clubs and bricks. Scott defended himself\r\nwith a pocketknife, while Kleinmark tried to beat him with a club. One\r\nof the blows with the knife went home, and Kleinmark staggered from\r\nthe car mortally wounded. Scott was jailed and charged with murder. The\r\ncoroner's jury commented as follows: \"It is the sense of this jury that\r\nthe conduct of the police at the time of the riot at this point, during\r\nthe subsequent investigation, and at the preliminary hearing at which\r\nJoseph Scott was bound over to the grand jury without counsel, was a\r\ntravesty on justice and fair play.\"\r\n\r\n     2. Clarence Metz\r\n        Race                              White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound     July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound     11:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound    Forty-third Street between\r\n                                            Forrestville and Vincennes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t    avenues\r\n        Manner of wound                   Stab wound\r\n\r\nMetz was one of an assaulting party of whites which roamed the streets\r\nfrom Forty-third to Forty-seventh streets and from Grand Boulevard to\r\nCottage Grove Avenue on the night of the twenty-eighth. Three Negroes,\r\none of them Lieutenant Washington, U.S.A., were returning from a theater\r\nwith three Negro women by way of Forty-third Street. At the place\r\nmentioned they were attacked by a mob of whites and beaten with fists and\r\nclubs. One of the Negroes was shot in the leg. Lieutenant Washington,\r\nthreatened with an ax handle, defended himself with his pocketknife.\r\nMetz was stabbed as a result. The coroner's jury said: \"We find that\r\nthe group of colored people, en route to their home, were acting in an\r\norderly and inoffensive manner, and were justified in their acts and\r\nconduct during said affray.\"\r\n\r\n     3. Berger Odman\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   8:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Sixtieth and Ada streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nThis shooting occurred just inside the Negro neighborhood near Ogden\r\nPark. One of the numerous mobs threatening this neighborhood began to\r\nmove into it from Fifty-ninth and Sixtieth streets and Racine Avenue.\r\nThe vanguard, composed of young boys, went a few feet inside the Negro\r\narea and fired directly at a Negro named Samuel Johnson. He returned\r\nthe fire with a rifle. Other Negroes also fired in the direction of the\r\nboys. One of the latter, Odman, was fatally wounded. The coroner's jury\r\nsaid: \"We believe and find that the action of Samuel R. Johnson was\r\nfully justified and recommend his discharge from police custody.\"\r\n\r\n     4. James Crawford\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 27\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   6:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Twenty-ninth Street and Cottage\r\n                                          Grove Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nA mob of about 1,000 Negroes congregated at Twenty-ninth Street and\r\nCottage Grove Avenue, whence they had chased Officer Callahan, supposed\r\nto have refused to arrest the alleged slayer of Eugene Williams.\r\nOther policemen attempting to disperse the mob were assaulted. James\r\nCrawford, Negro, fired a revolver directly into the group of policemen.\r\nThey retaliated and Crawford ran. A Negro policeman followed Crawford,\r\nattempting to stop him by firing. Crawford was wounded and died on July\r\n29. The coroner's jury asserted: \"We further find that the shooting was\r\njustifiable on the part of the police officer.\"\r\n\r\n     5. Thomas Joshua\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   7:00 or 7:30 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Fifty-first Street and Wabash\r\n\t                                  Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nAbout 7:30 A.M., July 29, Lieutenant Day of the Police Department, his\r\nson and daughter, and Policeman Mitchell rode down Fifty-first Street\r\nin an automobile. As the automobile reached Wabash Avenue a colored boy\r\npointed a gun toward it. Day sprang out, drawing his pistol. It is said\r\nthat the boy fired and Day returned a shot. The boy ran, and Day fired\r\ntwo more shots. A crowd of Negroes running from State Street came upon\r\nthe scene. The police escaped in a Yellow taxicab. Joshua was shot by\r\nLieutenant Day. While the testimony was a mass of contradictions, the\r\ncoroner's jury said: \"We are of the opinion that Thomas Joshua came to\r\nhis death from revolver shots fired by the police officer in the discharge\r\nof his duty.\"\r\n\r\n     6. Ira Henry\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 30\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   1:30 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  4957 South State Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nPolicemen Keal and Sullivan were accompanying three Jewish families\r\nfrom their residence on South State Street to the Fourth Precinct\r\npolice station. As the party passed 4957, Officer Sullivan saw a Negro\r\nin an alley. He ran back to search him and received a bullet wound. He\r\nreturned fire. Keal ran to his assistance and fired other shots. Henry\r\nwas killed instantly. A Negro woman who was with Henry testified that\r\nthe first shot was fired by Sullivan, but this was not substantiated.\r\nThe coroner's jury said: \"We are of the opinion that the officers were\r\nfully justified, owing to the circumstances, in shooting the deceased.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Deaths due to the Angelus riot as to which no recommendations were\r\nmade by the coroner's jury:\r\n\r\n     1. Joseph Sanford\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   8:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash\r\n\t                                  Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\n     2. Hymes Taylor\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   8:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Thirty-fifth Street and Wabash\r\n\t                                  Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\n     3. John Walter Humphrey\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   8:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Thirty-fifth Street between Wabash\r\n                                          Avenue and the \"L\"\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\n     4.   Edward Lee\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 28\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   8:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Thirty-fifth and State streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nThe Angelus riot centered at the intersection of Thirty-fifth Street and\r\nWabash Avenue, the location of the Angelus apartment house, occupied\r\nat the time by whites; Thirty-fifth Street was crowded all the way to\r\nState Street. It was at Thirty-fifth and State streets that a secondary\r\nriot occurred, an aftermath of the Angelus riot, yet almost simultaneous\r\nwith it. The crowd of Negroes on these corners had been growing during\r\nthe afternoon, and stone-throwing had been prevalent. The rumor which\r\nraised the mob to riot pitch was that a Negro boy had been shot by a\r\nwhite tenant of the Angelus building. A search by the police failed to\r\nproduce a culprit. By eight o'clock a mob of about 1,000 to 1,500 Negroes\r\nmassed on the streets. To cope with the mob were between sixty to 100\r\npolicemen on foot and about twelve mounted officers.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock a Negro either threw some missiles or fired a shot\r\nat a policeman. Immediately there followed a massing of the police at\r\nthe north of the intersection of the two streets. Evidence of an order\r\nto fire was not produced, but simultaneously with the massing came a\r\nvolley. During this fire Sanford and Taylor were killed while trying\r\nto escape into the entrance of the Angelus building. Shots followed at\r\nThirty-fifth Street and the \"L,\" where a large number of the Negroes ran\r\nfor protection. Several were wounded, and Humphrey was killed. Almost\r\nat the same time shots were fired at Thirty-fifth and State streets,\r\nwhere Lee received his death wound.\r\n\r\nThe Lee case is the only one in which suspicion of deliberate shooting\r\nrested upon anyone. Atrus Lee, brother of the deceased, accused Mounted\r\nPoliceman Brooks of firing directly at his brother. Brooks said that\r\nshots were fired at him from north of the intersection, and that he fired\r\nin the air and ran east. Drs. Anderson and Teffner, white, who saw the\r\nshooting from Dr. Anderson's office windows, bore him out. The corner's\r\njury concluded: \"We find that deceased was wounded by one of the shots\r\nfired at Officer Brooks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Deaths in circumstances which seemed to involve specific persons\r\nnamed by the coroner's jury for further investigation, but as to which\r\nno indictments followed:\r\n\r\n     1. Joseph Schoff\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 30\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   5:00 or 5:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  4228 South Ashland Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Stab wound\r\n\r\nSchoff, walking on Ashland Avenue, accosted Jose Blanco repeatedly, \"Are\r\nyou a Negro?\" Receiving no response he swung at Blanco with his fist.\r\nThe latter stabbed Schoff under the heart, then walked on. As he was\r\nabout to enter the house of a friend the police arrested him. He admitted\r\nthat he had stabbed a man, but said he had done it in self-defense.\r\nThe coroner's jury reported: \"We, the jury, are unable to agree as to\r\nwhether the accused, Jose Blanco, should be held to the grand jury upon\r\na charge of manslaughter.... We recommend that the coroner present this\r\nevidence to the grand jury for consideration and determination.\"\r\n\r\n     2. Samuel Banks\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 30\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   11:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  2729 Dearborn Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nAt 11:00 P.M., July 30, three policemen patrolling State Street at\r\nTwenty-eighth Street, heard a shot on Dearborn Street. At Twenty-sixth\r\nPlace they met about a dozen Negro ex-soldiers acting as police reserves\r\nunder doubtful orders and asked them to accompany them. They all went\r\ninto Dearborn Street. Sixteen-year-old Sam Banks saw them and ran for\r\nrefuge, dodging under the house steps at 2729. His running was taken\r\nas evidence of guilt. The officers halted in front of the house. One\r\nFrancis, a Negro, also believing that because the boy ran he was guilty,\r\nopened his door and pointed out the hiding-place of young Banks. The boy\r\nran into the passageway between the houses. A shot fired by one of the\r\nofficers took effect. Suspicion rested upon Patrolman O'Connor of the\r\nPolice Department and two of the ex-soldiers, Adams and Douglas. The\r\ncoroner's jury stated: \"The jury is unable to determine whether one or\r\nmore individuals of the group was acting criminally and is not able to\r\ndetermine which individual fired the shot.... We find that two of said\r\nvolunteers, Ed. Douglas and Charles Adams, are held on a charge of murder\r\nin connection with the death of deceased. We find there is evidence of\r\nthe presence of Ed. Douglas, but no satisfactory evidence of the presence\r\nof Charles Adams at the scene of the shooting. We recommend the discharge\r\nof Charles Adams from police custody on the charge of murder.\"\r\n\r\n     3. Theodore Copling\r\n         Race                                Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound       July 30\r\n        Time of receiving death wound       10:00 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound      2934 South State Street\r\n        Manner of wound                     Bullet wound\r\n\r\nA gang of Negro boys passing 2920 South State Street saw the white man\r\nand came back. A Negro, one Partee, was sitting outside the store. He\r\nwarned the watchman to get inside. Almost immediately shots were fired.\r\nThe only person injured was young Copling, who apparently was not in the\r\ncrowd but on the outskirts as a sightseer. Suspicion rested upon four\r\npersons--Baker, Negro, leader of the gang; Partee, Negro, who warned\r\nthe watchman and was opposed to the gang; Torcello, white watchman; and\r\nGraise, Negro, step-father of Copling, who had on previous occasions\r\nthreatened to kill the boy because of disagreements between them. The\r\ncoroner's jury said: \"We recommend that the said Hanson Baker, and the\r\nsaid Norman Partee, and the said Dan Torcello, and the said Louis Graise\r\nbe held to the grand jury on a charge of murder until discharged by due\r\nprocess of law.\"\r\n\r\n     4.  George Flemming\r\n         Race                                White\r\n         Date of receiving death wound       August 5\r\n         Time of receiving death wound       9:00 or 9:30 P.M.\r\n         Place of receiving death wound      549 East Forty-seventh Street\r\n         Manner of wound                     Wound (inflicted by bayonet)\r\n\r\nThe coroner's jury report said: \"We find that deceased, in company with\r\nseveral other young men, was at Forty-seventh Street and Forrestville\r\nAvenue when they were ordered to move away by a police officer and that\r\nthey obeyed and were walking east; that the group were followed by one\r\nEdgar D. Mohan, a soldier, armed with a rifle, bayonet fixed; that said\r\nMohan commanded the young men to move faster, accompanying the command\r\nby twice stabbing and wounding one Thomas J. Fennessey in the right hip\r\nand scrotum; and that he immediately after plunged the bayonet into the\r\nback of deceased, the bayonet penetrating through the body. We recommend\r\nthat the said Edgar D. Mohan be held to the grand jury upon a charge of\r\nmanslaughter, until discharged by due process of law.\r\n\r\n\"Being informed by the attorney general of Illinois that the military\r\nauthorities of the state of Illinois have jurisdiction over acts of\r\nthe said Edgar D. Mohan while in the military service, and have in fact\r\nassumed jurisdiction, a court martial being now in progress, we, the jury,\r\nhereby amend the last paragraph of our verdict of September 12, 1919, to\r\nread that 'Edgar D. Mohan be held to a court martial' instead of 'Edgar\r\nD. Mohan be held to the grand jury.'\" The court martial exonerated Mohan.\r\n\r\nStatements made in the office of the state's attorney show that Flemming\r\nwas implicated in attacks in the neighborhood upon Negroes earlier in\r\nthe riot period and was known as the leader of an unruly group who made\r\na certain poolroom their hangout.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Deaths for which specific persons were subsequently indicted by the\r\ngrand jury:\r\n\r\n1. Casmere Lazzeroni Race White Date of receiving death wound July 28\r\nTime of receiving death wound 4:50 P.M. Place of receiving death wound\r\n3618 South State Street Manner of wound Stab wound\r\n\r\nThe defendants were four Negro boys, Charles Johnson, eighteen; Frank\r\nCoachman, sixteen; John Green, fourteen; and Walter Colvin, sixteen.\r\nLazzeroni, a sixty-year-old Italian peddler, driving a banana wagon on\r\nState Street, was pursued by boys throwing stones who overtook him, jumped\r\non his wagon, and stabbed him with pocketknives. All except Johnson were\r\nalleged to have confessed, and the confessions were given before the\r\ngrand jury by Policeman Deliege as he remembered them. They were not\r\nread. The boys who confessed implicated the one who did not, Johnson.\r\nMrs. Dolly Herrmann identified all of the boys as being implicated.\r\n\r\nThe four boys were indicted and tried and on September 19, 1919, a verdict\r\nof guilty was rendered against Colvin and Johnson. They were sentenced\r\nto the penitentiary for life on December 17, 1919; the cases of Green\r\nand Coachman were stricken off with leave to reinstate.\r\n\r\n     2.  Joseph Powers\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   6:00 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Root and Emerald streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Stab wound\r\n\r\nA Negro, William Henderson, was walking west on Root Street on the\r\nmorning of July 29 going to work at the Stock Yards. He was overtaken\r\nby another Negro whom he did not know, but who accompanied him down the\r\nstreet. As they crossed Emerald Avenue they were met by two white men\r\nwalking east. One of these was Joseph Powers. He walked slightly behind\r\nthe other white man, whose identity was never discovered. It was not\r\nknown whether Powers was with this man or not. As the unknown white man\r\npassed the two Negroes he struck out at them. The unknown Negro walking\r\nwith Henderson struck back, evidently with a knife in his hand, and hit\r\nPowers, who was then abreast of the group, mortally wounding him. All the\r\nparticipants ran except Powers. Henderson was the only one overtaken.\r\nHe was chased through alleys and brought down with stones and bricks\r\nand severely beaten. From the description of the second Negro given by\r\nHenderson, and the fact that another had been found wounded near this\r\nspot, it was supposed at first that the second man was one Henry Renfroe.\r\nThe coroner's jury said: \"We believe that William Henderson was guilty\r\nof no wrong doing, and that if the unknown colored man should prove to\r\nbe Henry Renfroe, that he was acting in self-defense. We recommend their\r\nimmediate discharge from police custody. We further recommend that the\r\nwhite men guilty of assault on William Henderson and his companion be\r\napprehended and punished.\"\r\n\r\nLater Judge Tate, Negro, was identified as the companion of Henderson.\r\nBoth Negroes were indicted by the grand jury. On December 13, 1919, a\r\nverdict of not guilty was returned against Tate and the case of Henderson\r\nwas nolle prossed.\r\n\r\n     3. Walter Parejko\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   7:30 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Fifty-first Street near Dearborn\r\n\t                                  Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\n     4. Morris I. Perel\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   8:15 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Fifty-first and Dearborn streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Stab wound\r\n\r\nThe same three defendants appear in both these cases, three young Negro\r\nboys, Ben Walker, William Stinson, and Charles Davis.\r\n\r\nThere were no eyewitnesses in either case except the defendants involved,\r\nand they did not appear in person before the coroner's jury, but\r\nstatements by them were either read or repeated by officials in charge.\r\nDavis and Stinson declared that Walker shot Parejko. When the statements\r\nwere read to Walker, who had so far refused to make a confession, he\r\nsaid Stinson stabbed Perel.\r\n\r\nParejko and his friend Josef Maminaki, laborers on the Grand Trunk\r\nRailway, were going to work. According to Stinson the boys were sitting\r\non a bread box in front of a store when they saw the two white men.\r\nWalker said, \"Let's get this guy.\" Stinson answered, \"Not me.\" Walker\r\nsaid, \"Stand aside now, boys; I will do my stuff.\" He fired and Parejko\r\nwas mortally wounded and Maminaki slightly wounded. Walker denied the\r\nshooting. However, he told where the weapon could be found, and it was\r\nbrought before the coroner as evidence.\r\n\r\nPerel was walking to his place of business going west on Fifty-first\r\nStreet. Near Dearborn Street four or five Negro men or boys jumped on him\r\nand stabbed him. When he was found, it was discovered that his gold watch\r\nhad been forcibly severed from the chain and was missing. Someone said a\r\ncrowd of boys had been seen running south. According to the statement of\r\nBen Walker, \"Fat Stinson jumped on him and stabbed him and hit him with\r\na club at the same time.... After he stabbed and hit him the whole gang\r\njumped on him.\" Afterward Stinson is reported by Walker to have said,\r\n\"I surely hit that guy,\" and to have displayed a pearl-handled knife.\r\n\r\nThe coroner's jury said in the Parejko case: \"We recommend that the\r\nsaid Ben Walker, the said William Stinson, and the said Charles Davis be\r\nheld to the grand jury upon a charge of murder until discharged by due\r\nprocess of law.\" In the Perel case the jury said: \"We recommend that the\r\nsaid William Stinson be held to the grand jury upon a charge of murder\r\nuntil discharged by due process of law.\"\r\n\r\nThey were indicted by the grand jury, and on January 9, 1920, a verdict\r\nof not guilty was returned in each case.\r\n\r\n     5. Harold Brignadello (see p. 27)\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   10:30 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  1021 South State Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nHarold Brignadello was one of a crowd of white men who wandered south\r\non State Street and halted at No. 1021 and stoned the house. It was not\r\nbrought out whether the stone-throwing was done because Negroes lived in\r\nthe house, or was provoked by taunts from Negroes in the second-story\r\nwindow. A Negro woman and two men appeared at the window, and when the\r\nthrowing did not stop, the woman raised her arm. A shot was fired into\r\nthe crowd, fatally wounding Brignadello. Police officers found in the\r\nflat and arrested Emma Jackson, Kate Elder, John Webb, Ed Robinson, and\r\nClarence Jones. The coroner's jury recommended that they be held to the\r\ngrand jury upon a charge of murder until discharged by due process of\r\nlaw, and that members of the unknown white mob be apprehended. The five\r\nNegroes named were indicted, and on September 20, 1919, a verdict of\r\nnot guilty was returned as to each.\r\n\r\n     6. G. L. Wilkins\r\n        Race                            White\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 30\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   1:30 P.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  3825 Rhodes Avenue\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nWilkins, an agent for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, on his\r\nrounds collecting, entered the house at 3825 Rhodes Avenue where several\r\nNegro families live. While he was inside three young Negro men approached\r\none of the tenants who was sitting on the front porch, and one of them\r\nasked who the white man was. This youth is alleged to have said, \"We\r\ndon't want no damned insurance man here. What money we have got we want\r\nto keep it.\" When Wilkins appeared, two of the youths stood on the curb,\r\nand one went between two houses which Wilkins had to pass. As he went\r\nby he was shot. It was said that Spurgeon Anthony and Willis Powell were\r\nthe two who stood at the curb, and John Washington was the one who went\r\nbetween the houses. The coroner's jury recommended that the three be held\r\nto the grand jury upon a charge of murder, and the grand jury indicted\r\nthem. On December 16, 1919, a verdict of not guilty was returned as to\r\nPowell, and Washington was found guilty and sentenced to twenty years\r\nin the penitentiary.\r\n\r\n     7. Paul Hardwick\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   5:00 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  Wabash Avenue and Adams Street\r\n        Manner of wound                 Bullet wound\r\n\r\nA mob of white civilians, soldiers, and sailors, who had been chasing\r\nNegroes through the \"Loop\" district for the previous two or three hours,\r\nbeating and robbing them, and destroying property where Negroes were\r\nnot found, entered one of Thompson's restaurants where Hardwick was\r\nbreakfasting. Another Negro, one King, was also in the restaurant. The\r\nmob set upon them, throwing food and dishes. Hardwick dodged into the\r\nstreet and King hid behind a dish counter, where he was wounded with a\r\nknife. Failing to catch Hardwick as he fled down Adams Street, one of\r\nthe rioters stepped to the curb and fired a revolver at him, bringing\r\nhim down. Several of the crowd robbed the corpse. At the time of the\r\ncoroner's jury hearing the only one of the mob identified was Ray\r\nFreedman, aged seventeen. He was apprehended and charged with murder,\r\nmalicious mischief, and inciting to riot, but was not indicted. Later\r\nEdward Haines was connected with the case, indicted, and on February\r\n21, 1920, sent to Pontiac.\r\n\r\n     8. Robert Williams\r\n        Race                            Negro\r\n        Date of receiving death wound   July 29\r\n        Time of receiving death wound   6:15 A.M.\r\n        Place of receiving death wound  At or near State and Van Buren\r\n\t                                  streets\r\n        Manner of wound                 Stab wound\r\n\r\nThe murder of Williams was the second riot killing in the heart of\r\nChicago's business district on the morning of July 29. Before Williams\r\ndied he said he had been assaulted by white men at State and Van Buren\r\nstreets. An eyewitness, a Negro, said he saw Williams running west on\r\nthe car track on Van Buren Street, followed by a mob of about 200 white\r\nmen. One of them, whom he positively identified as Frank Biga, stabbed\r\nthe deceased twice, but Williams continued to run for a distance after\r\nthat. A white man who saw Williams picked up at Harrison and State streets\r\nalso identified Biga as a man who all during the morning had led gangs\r\nchasing Negroes. A woman went to a policeman and pointed out Biga as the\r\nleader of riot mobs. The coroner's jury recommended that Biga be held to\r\nthe grand jury upon a charge of murder. At the time of the identification\r\nof Biga by the woman the policeman arrested him, found a broken razor\r\nin his possession, and had him booked for disorderly conduct, for which\r\nhe was fined $5 and costs in the boys' court and sent to the House of\r\nCorrection. The next day he broke out of the House of Correction and was\r\nnot again apprehended until he was implicated in the murder of a shoe\r\nmerchant, Fred Bender, on August 8, 1919. He killed Bender with a blow\r\non the head from an iron pipe. On February 18, 1920, Biga was sent to\r\nthe penitentiary for life.\r\n\r\n     9. William Dozier\r\n     Race                             Negro\r\n     Date of receiving death wound    July 31\r\n     Time of receiving death wound    7:15 A.M.\r\n     Place of receiving death wound   Stock Yards, Exchange Avenue about\r\n                                        Cook Street\r\n     Manner of wound                  External violence\r\n\r\nDozier, Negro, approached a meat curer employed in the superintendent's\r\noffice of Swift & Co. to ask if the Negroes were not going to have\r\nprotection in the Yards that morning. A white worker stepped out of the\r\ncrowd and struck at Dozier with a hammer. Dozier dodged and caught the\r\nblow on the neck. He started to run east on Exchange Avenue. As he ran\r\nhe was struck with a street broom and shovel and other missiles; near\r\nthe sheep pens a brick felled him. The meat curer above mentioned and\r\nan assistant identified one Zarka as the man who wielded the hammer.\r\nJoseph Scezak was identified as the man who used the broom. The coroner's\r\njury recommended that these two be held to the grand jury on a charge\r\nof manslaughter and also that the unknown participants be held upon the\r\nsame charge. Zarka and Scezak were indicted for murder, and on May 6,\r\n1920, a verdict of not guilty was returned as to each.\r\n\r\n               D.

It\r\n     was held that a court of equity had no jurisdiction to enjoin\r\n     such a violation of the Civil Rights Act, but left the party\r\n     to his statutory remedies of either an action for damages or\r\n     criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n     _Thorne_ v. _Alcazar Amusement Company_, 210 Ill. App. 173,\r\n     1918, was an action to recover the penalty provided by the\r\n     Civil Rights Act for refusing to permit a Negro woman to occupy\r\n     a theater seat for which she had purchased a ticket. Judgment\r\n     in favor of the plaintiff in the municipal court was reversed\r\n     in the appellate court on the ground that the municipal court\r\n     had no jurisdiction to impose penalties for criminal acts\r\n     occurring outside the city limits.\r\n\r\n     [30] School cases in Illinois are as follows: _Chase_ v.\r\n     _Stephenson_, 71 Ill. 383; _People_ v. _Board of Education\r\n     of Quincy_, 101 Ill. 308; _People_ v. _McFall and Board of\r\n     Education of Quincy_, 26 Ill.

They are not included with the column of \"Retarded\"\r\n     children because the grades of the \"Retarded\" children were\r\n     given in the board of Education records and were used in\r\n     determining the amount these children were retarded (see Table\r\n     XIV). The \"Retarded Ungraded\" children are included with the\r\n     \"Retarded\" children in determining the percentage of retarded\r\n     children.\r\n\r\n     [40] Many so-called southern \"colleges\" include elementary and\r\n     high school, as well as college work. The term is general and\r\n     does not mean necessarily an institution of the same academic\r\n     standing as a northern college.\r\n\r\n     [41] See illustration facing this page.\r\n\r\n     [42] Missing\r\n\r\n     [43] Of these 19,000 about 200 use the beaches, 4,100 the\r\n     playgrounds, 700 the recreation centers, and 14,000 the large\r\n     parks.\r\n\r\n     [44] See p. 12\r\n\r\n     [45] See _Report of Chicago Crime Commission_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n     [46] See \"Racial Contacts\"--\"Physical Equipment of Schools,\"\r\n     p. 241.\r\n\r\n     [47] _City Council Crime Committee Report_, pp. 40-41.\r\n\r\n     [48] See \"Recreation,\" p. 272.\r\n\r\n     [49] In 1910 the number of Negroes gainfully occupied was\r\n     27,317, or 61.94 per cent of the total Negro population. The\r\n     percentage gainfully occupied in 1920 would be higher because\r\n     of the large number of men without families who migrated from\r\n     the South.\r\n\r\n     [50] Census Bureau, _Negro Population in the United States,\r\n     1790 to 1915_, p. 503.\r\n\r\n     [51] _Negro Population in the United States, 1790 to 1915_,\r\n     p. 90.\r\n\r\n     [52] _Ibid._, p. 503.

They reported a large increase since\r\n     1914 but gave no definite figures.\r\n\r\n     [62] Five foundries employing a total of fifty men in 1920 have\r\n     been omitted owing to failure to report figures for preceding\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     [63] Establishments omitted owing to insufficient returns.\r\n\r\n     [64] These figures include skilled and semi-skilled in three\r\n     packing establishments reporting that Negroes were employed\r\n     under each classification but giving no separate figures.\r\n\r\n     [65] Three establishments (lamp-shade, auto-cushion\r\n     manufacturing) not included. Failed to classify the employees\r\n     but reported that they had hand sewers and machine operators,\r\n     including skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled.\r\n\r\n     [66] Figures quoted for 1910 are taken from the Thirteenth\r\n     Census, 1910, Vol. IV, Table VIII, pp. 544-47.\r\n\r\n     [67] The contrast between these high wages and the wages which\r\n     Negroes coming from the South had previously earned is shown\r\n     in the study of family histories of migrant Negroes.\r\n\r\n     [68] The importation of these girls from the British West\r\n     Indies was noticed by the Commission after its period of\r\n     investigation had ended.\r\n\r\n     [69] Includes a scattering list of industries represented by\r\n     one to three establishments--Negro labor not important factor\r\n     in these industries.\r\n\r\n     [70] Includes three paper-box manufacturing plants with ten,\r\n     twenty, and 113 Negro employees, largely women; and cooperage\r\n     plant with ninety-six Negro employees and one sausage-casing\r\n     plant with ten Negro employees. These plants reported Negro\r\n     labor \"slow,\" \"lazy,\" or \"unreliable.\"\r\n\r\n     [71] Representatives of a number of the 101 establishments\r\n     visited did not feel able to make a comparison between the\r\n     Negro and white workers.\r\n\r\n     [72] Of the eighty-seven establishments (employing five or more\r\n     Negroes) covered by the investigation but omitted from this\r\n     table, forty-two had no Negro women employees and forty-five\r\n     failed to classify Negro workers by sex.\r\n\r\n     [73] Missing\r\n\r\n     [74] One establishment failed to report total employees.\r\n\r\n     [75] F.
