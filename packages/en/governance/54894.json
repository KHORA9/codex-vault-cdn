(She unlocks the door.)\r\n\r\n                             ENTER BENNETT.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Good morning, sweet Fanny.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—A kind salutation to my noble friend.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Where’s Wyckoff?\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—I don’t know.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Will he return soon?\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—I guess not.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Then come and sit in my lap.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—I will. (She bounds to Bennett’s knees.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Now kiss me.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—There! (Smack! smack! smack! and the last on his lips.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—O! how sweet!\r\n\r\n_Fanny_ (archly)—You don’t say!\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Yes, I do.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—And so do I.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Then give me another cluster of kisses.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—I’ll give you a dozen or a hundred, if you will only _puff_ me\r\nwell, and fill the theatre every night.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Have I not _puffed_ you well, my darling?\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—W-e-l-l—y-e-s. Wyckoff says I am _increasing my popularity_\r\nevery day. And now if you will only continue to _puff_ me, my dear Mr.\r\nBennett, I will hug and kiss you, and love you ever so dearly. And do\r\nyou know that I intend to give your beautiful wife some precious jewels?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Wyckoff said you contemplated a splendid donation to my fair\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—O yes, dear Mr. Bennett, the jewels are all purchased, and your\r\ndear wife shall have them soon.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Hush! fair creature! Don’t talk so loudly. Is the door locked?\r\nI hear footsteps. Some one ascends the stairs. If you are seen in my\r\nlap, old Mordecah M. Noah will get hold of it, and put it in his Caudle\r\nLectures, which bite me terribly.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—The door is locked, and you need not be afraid, as it is only\r\nthe servant coming to bring me some wine and water, and to dust my\r\nparlor.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Well, give me one more fervent kiss, and let in the servant,\r\nand I will depart, and return soon, unless you expect Wyckoff. It won’t\r\ndo for us both to be here at the same time, you know, eh?\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—I hardly think it will, although I love you both.\r\n\r\n_Servant_—(Knocks.)\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—Busy! (Servant goes down stairs.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Which do you love best—me or Wyckoff?\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—I love you the best, dear Mr. Bennett. Most people call Wyckoff\r\nthe handsomest, but I think you are the prettiest man I ever saw. Your\r\nvoice is so sweet, and your complexion so fair, and your features so\r\nGrecian, and your smile so lovely, and your heart so kind, and your\r\nfigure so commanding, and your eyes so expressive of a large humanity.\r\nO, Mr. Bennett, I most dearly love you, and now I desire to know if you\r\nlove me, and how much? And before you tell me, there’s another luscious\r\nkiss on your fragrant lips. And now, dear friend, do tell me how much\r\nyou love your grateful and affectionate Fanny?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—O, I love you most ardently, and I have a mind to give Wyckoff\r\na touch of the Italian, and marry you, and hide ourselves in some deep\r\nmountain glen of my beloved Scotland.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—O, if you would only do all that.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—What! kill Wyckoff, and marry you, and desert my devoted wife\r\nand child?\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—To be sure. Did you not say you would?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—O Heaven! Fanny! I am very nervous. Your extraordinary\r\nfascinations will ruin me, and I must fly.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—Whither?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—To my office.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—What! Havn’t you the pluck to kill Wyckoff, and marry me, and\r\nall my jewels, and the vast possessions I have acquired through my grace\r\nand agility?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Darm it, Fanny, no more to-day. Give me a parting kiss, and I\r\nwill go, and we will resume this delightful theme to-morrow, when\r\nWyckoff is promenading Broadway, or arranging your affairs at the\r\nTheatre and the printing offices. So, good-by, my adored Fanny—farewell,\r\nmy precious solace and incomparable divinity.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—A fond adieu, my charming admirer. Come again to-morrow, or I\r\nshall die. (She cries like a female Crocodile.)\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Farewell.\r\n\r\n_Fanny_—Farewell—my benefactor. O farewell!\r\n\r\n(He goes, and Fanny leaps, and dances, and laughs, and screams, and\r\nwildly rejoices over his departure.)\r\n\r\n         _The reader must now imagine the lapse of many years._\r\n\r\n                           BENNETT’S OFFICE.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Mr. Hudson, don’t let Ross & Tousey have any more _Heralds_\r\nfor their country agents.\r\n\r\n_Hudson_—Why?\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Because I learn that they have got all my little private\r\narrangements with Fanny Elssler stereotyped, and intend to publish my\r\nconnection and black mail operations with Elssler and Wyckoff, which\r\nwill mortify me extremely, and forever degrade me in the eyes of the\r\npeople, and of my wife and children.\r\n\r\n_Hudson_—I will see that Ross & Tousey obtain no more _Heralds_.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—Give the order immediately, to expel Ross & Tousey forever\r\nfrom our establishment.\r\n\r\n_Hudson_—I will. (Rings the bell.)\r\n\r\n                      ENTER PAPER SUPERINTENDENT.\r\n\r\n_Superintendent_—What is your desire, Mr. Hudson?\r\n\r\n_Hudson_—Let Ross & Tousey have no more _Heralds_. They have offended\r\nMr. Bennett.\r\n\r\n_Superintendent_—Is it possible? I’ll see that they get no more\r\n_Heralds_. (He goes.)\r\n\r\n               (_Hudson goes to Bennett’s private room._)\r\n\r\n_Hudson_—I have given your order, and it will be instantly obeyed.\r\n\r\n_Bennett_—That will suffice. (Hudson retires.)\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Richard B. Connolly and other Conspirators against my Liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Richard B. Connolly said he would give me a clerkship in the\r\nCounty Clerk’s Office, if I would not expose his unnaturalized alienage.\r\nI declined his infamous proposition. He then got Alderman John Kelly to\r\nread a letter to the Board of Aldermen, declaring that he was born in\r\nIreland, and first landed in Philadelphia, where he got naturalized in\r\nIndependence Hall, and that he valued the frame that contained the\r\nevidences of his naturalization, more than any piece of furniture in his\r\nhouse, and invited all to call at his residence, and behold its graceful\r\nsuspension on his parlor wall. I called, and his wife assured me that\r\nher husband was absent, and that his naturalization papers were in a\r\ntrunk, and that he had got the key. Alderman John H. Briggs called, when\r\nConnolly was at home, but he was not permitted to see the evidences of\r\nhis naturalization. Other citizens, and many of Connolly’s most intimate\r\nfriends called and desired to see his naturalization papers, but he\r\ndeclined to show them. I then went to Philadelphia, and got certificates\r\nfrom the clerks of all the Courts, that Richard B. Connolly, of Ireland,\r\nwas never naturalized in the Philadelphia Courts, and I returned, and\r\npublished the results of my visit to Philadelphia in the _New York\r\nTimes_, and other journals, and also stated that Connolly strove to\r\nbribe me not to expose his alienage. At the election of County Clerk,\r\nwhich followed these events, Connolly did not vote, and when taunted\r\nwith his refusal to vote by his adversaries, he excused himself on the\r\nground that he had bet largely on several candidates, and dared not\r\nvote. This was the very small aperture through which he crawled. And\r\nthis is the scamp who is to impannel the jury by which I am soon to be\r\ntried for the alleged libel of Tiemann and Cooper and Connolly’s most\r\nsacred friend, Simeon Draper, with whom he was long a clerk, and with\r\nwhom he has been connected in schemes of plunder and political villainy\r\nfor nearly a quarter of a century. From Connolly’s notorious character\r\nas a sly and cunning and treacherous rascal, and Jury Packer, and ballot\r\nstuffer, and public robber, I have every reason to believe that he will\r\npack the jury that will try me. And he has four powerful motives for\r\npacking my jury, and sending me to Blackwell’s Island: And firstly, to\r\navenge my exposure of his perjured alienage, and secondly, to prove his\r\nfidelity to his old friend, Simeon Draper, and thirdly, to win the favor\r\nof Tiemann and Cooper, and secure their support of him as Comptroller,\r\nand fourthly, to incarcerate me while he seeks his nomination and\r\nelection as Comptroller, so that I cannot expose his perjured alienage\r\nand nefarious crimes, during his efforts to obtain an office, which will\r\nenable him to steal millions from the Treasury, and thus rob the toiling\r\nmillions of their bread and raiment and shelter from the pitiless\r\nelements, and drive many a lovely virgin, of sick and indigent parents,\r\nto the horrors of prostitution. In 1852, he was almost penniless, but\r\nnow he is worth a million of dollars, which he has stolen directly from\r\nthe pockets of the honest and laborious classes, for whom he professes\r\nexhaustless love. With the Mayor and nearly all the Executive\r\nDepartments, and Connolly, Draper, Sickles, Hart, and the _Herald_,\r\n_Times_, and _Tribune_, and other journals, and Peter Cooper, and\r\nEx-Mayor Kingsland, and other millionaires against me, it seems almost\r\nimpossible to escape a sojourn at Blackwell’s Island, but I have\r\nconfidence in God and truth and justice, and I defy all the powers of\r\nearth to vanquish my soul. And I most fervently thank the Great Disposer\r\nof Events, that if I am consigned to a felon’s cell, it will not be for\r\nrobbing the friendless multitudes, like such thieves as Tiemann, Cooper,\r\nDraper, and Connolly, who may not be incarcerated and tortured for their\r\ndeeds of villainy while living, although a terrible retribution awaits\r\nthem beyond the grave. Stephen, of old, was stoned for his virtues, and\r\nSocrates poisoned, and the Saviour crucified, and a poor, humble, and\r\nfriendless being like me, may be imprisoned, and forced to die in a\r\ndungeon, for exposing the public robbers of the present generation. But\r\nI will not murmur at the terrible ordeal through which I am about to\r\npass. For my fidelity to the people, I may lose my liberty. Be it so.\r\nAnd when the public thieves have consigned me to a lonely and dreary\r\ncell, and my frail form slowly wastes away, and I am forever gone, my\r\nabsent soul will only crave a humble mound, and the tears of the\r\nvirtuous, to bless and fertilise the pretty flowers that prance over my\r\ngrassy hillock, in the mild summer perfume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Stephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                   NEW YORK, SATURDAY, JULY 31, 1858.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN H. BRANCH’S “ALLIGATOR” CAN BE obtained at all hours, at\r\nwholesale and retail, at No. 114 Nassau Street, (Second Story), near Ann\r\nStreet, New York.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               My Trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sedgwick informs me that I will be tried on the first Monday in\r\nAugust. I shall be ready, and I dare Mayor Tiemann to meet me on that\r\nmemorable day. It grieves me to know that my witnesses will overwhelm\r\nhim with disgrace, because his wife and children will be degraded\r\nthrough all their posterity. But for Tiemann, and Peter Cooper, and\r\nEdward Cooper, I have no sympathy, because they have been recreant to\r\nthe people, in their appointment of thieves and assassins to the most\r\nlucrative and honorable offices. Daniel F. Tiemann has been a hypocrite\r\nand a public thief, since he was Alderman in 1838. Peter Cooper has been\r\na public plunderer since he was Alderman in 1828, and a heartless miser\r\nthrough all his days; and Daniel and Peter are training young Edward to\r\nimitate their pernicious example. Peter Cooper is the father of\r\nillegitimate children, who reside in the vicinity of his Glue Factory,\r\nat Bushwick, and Daniel F. Tiemann has long kept a mistress on Randall’s\r\nIsland, and committed other deeds of hell, as I will prove on the first\r\nMonday in August. Let there be no postponement of the trial, as I yearn\r\nfor a conflict, that will consign the foes of the people to undying\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         National Degeneration!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a consummate band of scamps wield the destinies of this nation.\r\nFrom President to Treasurer, and Collector, and official Sexton, all is\r\nblack-mail, fornication, ballot-stuffing, and unblushing robbery. Who\r\ncan respect a President, who will permit such a villain as James Gordon\r\nBennett to be a guest at his table, and dictate his domestic and foreign\r\nappointments, and demand the publication of the “List of Letters” in his\r\nchameleon and most infamous Journal, to the exclusion of the _New York\r\nSun_, which has the highest city circulation, and which should publish\r\nthe Letters according to the Acts of Congress. Did not Bennett first\r\nsupport George Law, and then Fremont, down to the last hour of the\r\nelection? And did he not traduce Buchanan, as no other man in America?\r\nAnd why does Buchanan kiss the rod that strove to smite him? And why\r\ndoes he permit him to visit the White House, as his most distinguished\r\nguest? Is it because he fears he will expose the motive of his intimate\r\nrelations with Daniel E. Sickles, and give some curious reminiscences of\r\nFanny White’s notorious tour in Europe, while Dan was his Private\r\nSecretary and flying Minister to Spain? Ostensibly, it was Buchanan’s\r\nfear of Bennett’s hostility to his Kansas views, but in reality, it was\r\nhis dread of Bennett’s disclosure of hellish domestic events, during\r\nFanny White’s European pilgrimage, that induced Buchanan to proffer\r\nBennett the freedom of the White House, and that forced him to unite\r\nBennett and Sickles in perpetual friendship. I can show where Bennett\r\nsquints at Dan and Fan and Buck in the _Herald_, which shook the White\r\nHouse to its deep foundation. Two famous harlots long kept Daniel E.\r\nSickles and Emanuel B. Hart, and the latter lives with a woman now, on\r\nthe principles of Turkish Free Love. Fanny White kept Sickles until he\r\nwent to board with a dancing master, whose wife he soon allures from the\r\nbed of her husband, and drives him from his own house. He then seduces\r\ntheir daughter, a mere child, who became six month’s pregnant. He now\r\nfears the law, and gets Bishop Hughes to marry him to the lovely and\r\nyouthful creature of his seduction. He then introduces Mayor Ambrose C.\r\nKingsland to his wife’s mother, with whom Kingsland has sexual\r\nintercourse. He then asks Mayor Kingsland to give him a certificate,\r\nthat he had been married six months before, to cover the pregnancy of\r\nhis wife. Kingsland hesitates, when Dan threatens to expose his sexual\r\nintercourse with his wife’s mother. Kingsland becomes alarmed and gives\r\nDan the marriage certificate, and all is tranquil. When Dan became James\r\nBuchanan’s Private Secretary, at the Court of St. James, Fanny White\r\nvisited London, and was very intimate with Buchanan, and Dan gave her\r\npassports all over Europe, as Mrs. James Gordon Bennett. Bennett\r\nascertained this, and hence the long and bitter quarrel between Dan and\r\nBennett. Dan got the Hon. John Wheeler to give Fanny White letters of\r\nintroduction to certain parties at Niagara Falls, as Mrs. James Gordon\r\nBennett. Fanny White now lives in New York, and Dan is still friendly\r\nwith her, although she is kept by another. Emanuel B. Hart was long kept\r\nby Eliza Pratt, who got tired of him, and discarded him. He subsequently\r\ntook a notorious wanton, named Louise Wallace, from a house of ill-fame,\r\nand lives with her now, and introduces her into the first circles of\r\nsociety. Sickles is now a member of Congress, and the most influential\r\nman under Buchanan in the White House, and Hart was appointed by\r\nBuchanan, Surveyor of the Port of New York, which is considered next in\r\nimportance to the office of Collector. And yet there are no earthquakes.\r\nAnd the people tamely submit to this monstrous degradation. And these\r\nrevelations may lead to a scuffle of death between Sickles, Hart, and\r\nmyself. But if I were sure that my brains were to be strewn upon the\r\npavement, I would disclose to the American people, that their public\r\nservants are thieves, and fornicators, and ballot-stuffers, and\r\nblack-mailers. Public men who will keep vile women, or (what is\r\ninfinitely more degrading,) be kept and fed and clothed by concubines,\r\nlike Hart and Sickles, should be exposed and loathed by all virtuous\r\nminds. And Buchanan should be more despised than Hart and Sickles, for\r\nhis known intimacy with them for years, and with Fanny White, and for\r\nhis appointment of Hart as Surveyor, and for chopping off the heads of a\r\nhundred worthy officials, at the instigation of such a notorious rake,\r\nand thief, and ballot-stuffer as Daniel E. Sickles. Buchanan fears\r\nSickles, Hart, Bennett, and Fanny White! God of Heaven! How the national\r\nmorals have degenerated during the present century. At a recent dinner\r\nat the White House sat the President, Bennett, Russell, Hart and\r\nSickles. The President sat beside Mrs. Dan Sickles—Bennett sat next to\r\nMrs. Judge Russell—Russell sat alone—Emanuel B. Hart sat next to his\r\nMistress, and Sickles next to Fanny White. What a mournful sacrilege!\r\nViolated shades of Washington! Jefferson! and Jackson! O Vernon! and\r\nMonticello! and the Hermitage! may thy hallowed verdure be forever green\r\nand fragrant. And paralysed be the monsters who trample thy mounds, and\r\nblight thy pretty violets. And is there an American, or a naturalized\r\nforeigner whose cheeks do not crimson at a bacchanal like this, in the\r\nsacred atmosphere of great Washington’s mausoleum? What! Shall a gang\r\nlike this be permitted to desecrate the halls and seats once occupied by\r\nthe most illustrious patriots that ever graced the earth? O, Father of\r\nHeaven! Do not abandon the honest Americans, nor the patriot pilgrims to\r\nthese happy shores, who still are grateful for Thy protection of their\r\nimmortal Fathers, and who will strive to elect men to wield their\r\ndestinies, who cherish Thee, and will legislate for the honor and\r\nwelfare and glory of their beloved country. Do not desert them, O God!\r\nis the fervent prayer of millions of noble Americans, and of all\r\nnaturalized foreigners, who truly love Thee, and the free and sunny land\r\nof their adoption.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Mayor Tiemann know what became of the Lime Kiln Man? Most horrible\r\n           disclosures! In God’s name, where are the People?\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam O. Webb, now Superintendent of Potter’s Field, who was appointed\r\nby the Ten Governors, sold and delivered last winter, five hundred\r\ncorpses to the body snatchers, and has sold about the same number for\r\nseveral winters past, for which he and others received $17 for each\r\ncorpse, forming an aggregate of $8,500 that was received each winter.\r\nThe bodies are disinterred in the night, during the favorable tides, and\r\ncarried from Potter’s Field to the Dead House, on the shore of Ward’s\r\nIsland,—sometimes in a sleigh, and sometimes in a wheelbarrow,—and\r\ndelivered to the body snatchers, awaiting their arrival at the Dead\r\nHouse. William O. Webb directs the grave diggers to give no corpses to\r\nthe body snatchers, who died of small pox, or other contagious diseases,\r\nnor badly mutilated bodies. Michael Gilmore was an Assistant Grave\r\nDigger, and is now a clerk of the Superintendent of Potter’s Field. Wm.\r\nO. Webb’s salary is $800 per annum—a house free of rent—a farm—fuel, and\r\nprovisions, from the Ten Governors—and four paupers and a servant to\r\nmanage his farm. Sometimes he has fifteen paupers to work his farm.\r\nWebb’s clerk receives $400 a year, and his wife $200, and they have a\r\nlarge house and extensive grounds, and a servant and fuel and provisions\r\nfrom the Ten Governors. Webb employs a boy, about sixteen years old, who\r\nburies the dead, and who has $300 per annum. This boy receives the dead\r\nbodies, and selects such as the Doctors desire, immediately on their\r\nreception at Potter’s Field. Sometimes an arm or a leg is dissevered,\r\nand sold to the Doctors. After the bodies are removed, the coffins are\r\nsawed and chopped, and packed in bags, and taken to Harlem, and used as\r\nfire wood. The bodies are stripped of their dead clothes, and the best\r\npart sold in the city, as apparel, and the residue as rags, which\r\nconstantly exposes the city to contagion. The Ten Governors are familiar\r\nwith these facts, and have some knowledge of what is done with the money\r\nthat is received for the dead bodies. William O. Webb has long been the\r\nwarm personal and political friend of Governor Daniel F. Tiemann, whose\r\nmutual relations have been of such a _peculiar nature_ that, although\r\nGov. Tiemann has often been apprised of Webb’s monstrous proceedings,\r\nyet he dared not advance a step towards his removal. Webb’s expenses as\r\nSuperintendent of Potter’s Field are $5,000 per annum. A respectable\r\nman, with the best security, proposed to Mayor Tiemann, when he was\r\nGovernor, to assume the management of Potter’s Field, for $1,000 per\r\nannum, without the salaries, houses, farms, paupers, and servants, fuel,\r\nand provisions that the Superintendent and Clerk, and their wives then\r\nand now receive, forming an aggregate of $5,000 per annum, exclusive of\r\nthe $8,500 received by the Superintendent and others for dead bodies.\r\nAnd yet, such were the _peculiar relations_ subsisting between Gov.\r\nTiemann and Mr. Webb, that the former dared not accept a proposition so\r\nfavorable to the Treasury of the City, for whose economical\r\ndisbursements Gov. Tiemann professes such anxious regard. One of the\r\ngrave diggers refused to sell the body snatchers any more bodies, and\r\ninformed Gov. Tiemann of his determination, who exclaimed, with much\r\nlevity: “If you interfere with their business, there will be no inquest\r\nheld over your body.” Webb sold the corpse of his wife’s uncle, whose\r\nname was Brown, a builder, and when Brown’s relatives desired his body\r\nfor respectable interment, Webb placed another corpse in the coffin, and\r\nsent it to them, which they interred as their dear relative. The Lime\r\nKiln Man was borne to Potter’s Field, and when his friends heard the sad\r\nintelligence of his death and pauper interment, they raised funds, which\r\nthey gave to Webb, with directions to exhume and respectably inter him.\r\nBut Webb could not find the Lime Kiln Man, and placed another corpse in\r\na coffin, and buried it, and when the friends of the Lime Kiln Man came\r\nto Potter’s Field, Mr. Webb led them to a grave, which he assured them\r\nwas the Lime Kiln Man’s. At my trial, on the first Monday in August, I\r\nshall summon the Doctor, and the body snatchers connected with him, and\r\nthe superintendent, clerk, grave diggers, and all others engaged in this\r\nawful sacrilege, to unmask the scoundrels connected with our public\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York is the seat of Commerce, affluence, intelligence, and\r\njournalism, and the devil has placed at the head of the Press, three\r\nsuch rogues as Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond. I have personally known\r\nthese desperate jugglers for twenty years, and if the reader is\r\nsceptical, when I brand them as unparalleled scoundrels, let him refer\r\nto the files of these editors, who fiercely denounce, and clearly prove\r\neach other to be incomparable villains, and in parallel columns, they\r\nassume to be the censors of the public morals, and anathematise rogues\r\nof every grade and country, whom they strive to allure to the embraces\r\nof the sacred virtues. The mighty destinies of our country are in the\r\ngrasp of heartless black mail editors, and Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond\r\nnever unite in matters of public good, nor in the election of\r\nmeritorious citizens to public office. And when they scream loudest for\r\nthe propagation of the public virtues, and the creation of wise public\r\nmeasures, their eyes are fastened on the devil, and his imps, and\r\novershadowing schemes of public plunder. Their opinions have not half\r\nthe force and purity of the humblest citizens, and yet, like foreign\r\ndespots, they thrust their heresies into our skulls, and in connection\r\nwith officials, as infamous as themselves, (whom they elect,) they\r\ntrample our most sacred rights, and slyly appropriate the public\r\ntreasure, and violate all laws, human and divine, and from whose\r\neditorial edicts there is no appeal. And thus the public evils of our\r\ncountry flow from such polluted sources, as the _Herald_, _Times_, and\r\n_Tribune_. If these three editors were as pure and patriotic as they\r\nprofess to be, they would unite in the advocation of honest men for\r\noffice, and discharge their thievish correspondents at Albany and\r\nWashington, (who are in collusion with official robbers, by direction of\r\ntheir employers,) and invariably oppose the election of vicious men to\r\noffice. Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond, and other editorial rogues, never\r\nadvocate the election of a man to office, without the pledge of a share\r\nof his influence and spoils, which is the real source of our public\r\nevils. They black mail on a scale of startling magnitude and boldness.\r\nThey watch, with ceaseless vigilance, for facilities to seize the pap\r\nfrom the private and public purse. They level their fleetest and most\r\nenvenomed arrows at the subordinate municipal officers, Mayors,\r\nGovernors, National Collectors, Representatives, Senators, Cabinet\r\nofficers, and the President, himself, whom they force to yield to their\r\ndemands, or they spread terror into the camps of these public vultures.\r\nBennett, Greeley, and Raymond have obtained their prodigious power,\r\nthrough the large number of fools that read their nonsense, and black\r\nmail philippics. If these idiots would cease to read their vile and\r\nselfish stuff, and patronise those editors who proclaim the truth, and\r\nstrive to promote the public welfare, such men as Bennett, Greeley, and\r\nRaymond would soon become the paupers and loafers and scamps of twenty\r\nyears ago, when they had no place to lay their wicked skulls, nor credit\r\nfor a loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Peter Cooper Institute!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn front of this sham Institute is painted, in blazing letters: “These\r\nStores, and the Story above to Let. Enquire in office, 2d story.” And\r\nPeter might have advertised a portion of the stories above the two lower\r\nstories, as he has rooms to let in every story of the building. Even\r\naround the lecture room, in the second and third stories, he has\r\nconstructed small rooms to let to any adventurer who comes along. Such\r\nwas his avarice, and so greedy was he to gouge all the area he possibly\r\ncould from earth and Heaven, that he dug as far towards China as he\r\ndared, and approached Heaven’s dome, until his architect warned him to\r\nstop, lest the whole edifice tumble into one common ruin, so feeble was\r\nthe building’s foundation. And now, Peter Cooper! I demand you to\r\ninstantly surrender your right and that of your heirs, (including Mayor\r\nTiemann and Edward Cooper,) to the building known as the Cooper\r\nInstitute. You have made a great noise, for half a dozen years, about\r\nyour extraordinary philanthropy, and you have publicly proclaimed, a\r\nthousand times, that you intended to give your “Art and Science” edifice\r\nto the city, _entirely_ for educational purposes. And you have got its\r\ntax of $8,000 reduced with this plea. And you have also got the Croton\r\nwater tax removed, although you have got a steam engine in the building.\r\nAnd yet you still hold the property, in the name of yourself and heirs,\r\nand from what I know of your penurious propensities, I could almost\r\nswear that you never meant to give it to the city. Was not the building\r\npublicly dedicated long since? And where are the three thousand pupils,\r\nwith green satchels, with whom we all expected to see the building teem?\r\nThere is more cheerfulness and utility in the deserts of Arabia, and the\r\nclassic ruins and crumbling desolations of the Ancient States, than in\r\nthe dismal and Shylock echoes of your bogus and uncomely structure. And\r\nwhy do you still clutch it to your heart, like an expiring miser, his\r\nmiserable dross? And why did you so construct the building, as to render\r\nit utterly inappropriate for students? You have told beggars, high and\r\nlow, for half a dozen years, that you could not give them a crum of\r\nbread, because you were devoting all your surplus means to the\r\nconstruction of the Cooper Institute. And now that it is erected, and\r\nyou have got all you desired, (and have toiled thirty years to achieve,)\r\nin the election of Tiemann, your son-in-law, as Mayor, through your\r\nspecious and fallacious Philanthropy, and in the appointment of Edward\r\nCooper, your own son, as Street Commissioner, by Tiemann,—after you have\r\nreached the goal of your miserly and ungodly ambition, and have got all\r\nNew York in your breeches pocket, I find you apply your fingers to your\r\ninfernal nose, and hurl defiance at the people, whom you have\r\nbamboozled, and evince a disposition to forever hold the building over\r\nwhich you have raised such a clatter for half a dozen years, and now\r\nactually advertise the stores and rooms of nearly the entire edifice,\r\nand of course, will put the rents in your yawning pockets, in the name\r\nof the President and Board of Trustees of the immortal Cooper Institute,\r\nwhich illustrious Chartered Body only comprises Peter Cooper! O Peter!\r\nPeter! you are a consummate impostor, and all the people will soon\r\nconceive you to be so, unless you instantly disgorge the property you\r\nlong promised to give them for educational purposes. And now, Peter, go\r\nto the City Hall at once, and record the Institute in the name of the\r\npeople, who will ever bless you for your noble philanthropy.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!
