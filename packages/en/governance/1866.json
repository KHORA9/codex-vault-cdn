CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site of the present city of Washington was chosen with three\r\nspecial views; firstly, that being on the Potomac it might have the\r\nfull advantage of water-carriage and a sea-port; secondly, that\r\nit might be so far removed from the seaboard as to be safe from\r\ninvasion; and, thirdly, that it might be central alike to all the\r\nStates. It was presumed when Washington was founded that these three\r\nadvantages would be secured by the selected position. As regards the\r\nfirst, the Potomac affords to the city but few of the advantages\r\nof a sea-port. Ships can come up, but not ships of large burthen.\r\nThe river seems to have dwindled since the site was chosen; and at\r\npresent it is, I think, evident that Washington can never be great in\r\nits shipping. _Statio benefida carinis_ can never be its motto. As\r\nregards the second point, singularly enough Washington is the only\r\ncity of the Union that has been in an enemy's possession since the\r\nUnited States became a nation. In the war of 1812 it fell into our\r\nhands, and we burnt it. As regards the third point, Washington, from\r\nthe lie of the land, can hardly have been said to be centrical at\r\nany time. Owing to the irregularities of the coast it is not easy of\r\naccess by railways from different sides. Baltimore would have been\r\nfar better. But as far as we can now see, and as well as we can now\r\njudge, Washington will soon be on the borders of the nation to which\r\nit belongs, instead of at its centre. I fear, therefore, that we must\r\nacknowledge that the site chosen for his country's capital by George\r\nWashington has not been fortunate.\r\n\r\nI have a strong idea, which I expressed before in speaking of the\r\ncapital of the Canadas, that no man can ordain that on such a spot\r\nshall be built a great and thriving city. No man can so ordain even\r\nthough he leave behind him, as was the case with Washington, a\r\nprestige sufficient to bind his successors to his wishes. The\r\npolitical leaders of the country have done what they could for\r\nWashington. The pride of the nation has endeavoured to sustain\r\nthe character of its chosen metropolis. There has been no rival,\r\nsoliciting favour on the strength of other charms. The country has\r\nall been agreed on the point since the father of the country first\r\ncommenced the work. Florence and Rome in Italy have each their\r\npretensions; but in the States no other city has put itself forward\r\nfor the honour of entertaining Congress. And yet Washington has been\r\na failure. It is commerce that makes great cities, and commerce has\r\nrefused to back the General's choice. New York and Philadelphia,\r\nwithout any political power, have become great among the cities of\r\nthe earth. They are beaten by none except by London and Paris. But\r\nWashington is but a ragged, unfinished collection of unbuilt broad\r\nstreets, as to the completion of which there can now, I imagine, be\r\nbut little hope.\r\n\r\nOf all places that I know it is the most ungainly and most\r\nunsatisfactory;--I fear I must also say the most presumptuous in its\r\npretensions. There is a map of Washington accurately laid down; and\r\ntaking that map with him in his journeyings a man may lose himself in\r\nthe streets, not as one loses oneself in London between Shoreditch\r\nand Russell Square, but as one does so in the deserts of the Holy\r\nLand, between Emmaus and Arimathea. In the first place no one knows\r\nwhere the places are, or is sure of their existence, and then between\r\ntheir presumed localities the country is wild, trackless, unbridged,\r\nuninhabited, and desolate. Massachusetts Avenue runs the whole length\r\nof the city, and is inserted on the maps as a full-blown street,\r\nabout four miles in length. Go there, and you will find yourself not\r\nonly out of town, away among the fields, but you will find yourself\r\nbeyond the fields, in an uncultivated, undrained wilderness. Tucking\r\nyour trousers up to your knees you will wade through the bogs, you\r\nwill lose yourself among rude hillocks, you will be out of the reach\r\nof humanity. The unfinished dome of the Capitol will loom before you\r\nin the distance, and you will think that you approach the ruins of\r\nsome western Palmyra. If you are a sportsman, you will desire to\r\nshoot snipe within sight of the President's house. There is much\r\nunsettled land within the States of America, but I think none so\r\ndesolate in its state of nature as three-fourths of the ground on\r\nwhich is supposed to stand the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington is something more than four miles long, and\r\nis something more than two miles broad. The land apportioned to it\r\nis nearly as compact as may be, and it exceeds in area the size\r\nof a parallelogram four miles long by two broad. These dimensions\r\nare adequate for a noble city, for a city to contain a million of\r\ninhabitants. It is impossible to state with accuracy the actual\r\npopulation of Washington, for it fluctuates exceedingly. The place\r\nis very full during Congress, and very empty during the recess.\r\nBy which I mean it to be understood that those streets, which\r\nare blessed with houses, are full when Congress meets. I do not\r\nthink that Congress makes much difference to Massachusetts Avenue.\r\nI believe that the city never contains as many as eighty thousand,\r\nand that its permanent residents are less than sixty thousand.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said,--was it not well to prepare for a growing city?\r\nIs it not true that London is choked by its own fatness, not having\r\nbeen endowed at its birth or during its growth, with proper means for\r\naccommodating its own increasing proportions? Was it not well to lay\r\ndown fine avenues and broad streets, so that future citizens might\r\nfind a city well prepared to their hand?\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt much in such an argument, but its correctness must\r\nbe tested by its success. When a man marries it is well that he\r\nshould make provision for a coming family. But a Benedict, who early\r\nin his career shall have carried his friends with considerable\r\nself-applause through half-a-dozen nurseries and at the end of twelve\r\nyears shall still be the father of one ricketty baby, will incur a\r\ncertain amount of ridicule. It is very well to be prepared for good\r\nfortune, but one should limit one's preparation within a reasonable\r\nscope. Two miles by one might perhaps have done for the skeleton\r\nsketch of a new city. Less than half that would contain much more\r\nthan the present population of Washington; and there are, I fear, few\r\ntowns in the Union so little likely to enjoy any speedy increase.\r\n\r\nThree avenues sweep the whole length of Washington;--Virginia Avenue,\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, and Massachusetts Avenue. But Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue is the only one known to ordinary men, and the half of that\r\nonly is so known. This avenue is the backbone of the city, and those\r\nstreets which are really inhabited cluster round that half of it\r\nwhich runs westward from the Capitol. The eastern end, running from\r\nthe front of the Capitol, is again a desert. The plan of the city is\r\nsomewhat complicated. It may truly be called \"a mighty maze, but not\r\nwithout a plan.\" The Capitol was intended to be the centre of the\r\ncity. It faces eastward, away from the Potomac,--or rather from the\r\nmain branch of the Potomac, and also unfortunately from the main body\r\nof the town. It turns its back upon the chief thoroughfare, upon the\r\nTreasury buildings, and upon the President's house; and indeed upon\r\nthe whole place. It was, I suppose, intended that the streets to the\r\neastward should be noble and populous, but hitherto they have come\r\nto nothing. The building therefore is wrong side foremost, and all\r\nmankind who enter it, senators, representatives, and judges included,\r\ngo in at the back-door. Of course it is generally known that in\r\nthe Capitol is the Chamber of the Senate, that of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and the Supreme Judicial Court of the Union. It may\r\nbe said that there are two centres in Washington, this being one and\r\nthe President's house the other. At these centres the main avenues\r\nare supposed to cross each other, which avenues are called by the\r\nnames of the respective States. At the Capitol, Pennsylvania Avenue,\r\nNew Jersey Avenue, Delaware Avenue, and Maryland Avenue converge.\r\nThey come from one extremity of the city to the square of the Capitol\r\non one side, and run out from the other side of it to the other\r\nextremity of the city. Pennsylvania Avenue, New York Avenue, Vermont\r\nAvenue, and Connecticut Avenue do the same at what is generally\r\ncalled President's Square. In theory, or on paper, this seems to be a\r\nclear and intelligible arrangement; but it does not work well. These\r\ncentre depots are large spaces, and consequently one portion of a\r\nstreet is removed a considerable distance from the other. It is as\r\nthough the same name should be given to two streets, one of which\r\nentered St. James's Park at Buckingham Gate, while the other started\r\nfrom the Park at Marlborough House. To inhabitants the matter\r\nprobably is not of much moment, as it is well known that this portion\r\nof such an avenue and that portion of such another avenue are merely\r\nmyths,--unknown lands away in the wilds. But a stranger finds himself\r\nin the position of being sent across the country knee-deep into the\r\nmud, wading through snipe grounds, looking for civilization where\r\nnone exists.\r\n\r\nAll these avenues have a slanting direction. They are so arranged\r\nthat none of them run north and south or east and west; but the\r\nstreets, so called, all run in accordance with the points of the\r\ncompass. Those from east to west are A Street, B Street, C Street,\r\nand so on,--counting them away from the Capitol on each side, so that\r\nthere are two A streets and two B streets. On the map these streets\r\nrun up to V Street, both right and left,--V Street North and V Street\r\nSouth. Those really known to mankind are E, F, G, H, I, and K Streets\r\nNorth. Then those streets which run from north to south are numbered\r\nFirst Street, Second Street, Third Street, and so on, on each front\r\nof the Capitol, running to Twenty-fourth or Twenty-fifth Street on\r\neach side. Not very many of these have any existence, or I might\r\nperhaps more properly say, any vitality in their existence.\r\n\r\nSuch is the plan of the city, that being the arrangement and those\r\nthe dimensions intended by the original architects and founders of\r\nWashington; but the inhabitants have hitherto confined themselves to\r\nPennsylvania Avenue West, and to the streets abutting from it or near\r\nto it. Whatever address a stranger may receive, however perplexing\r\nit may seem to him, he may be sure that the house indicated is near\r\nPennsylvania Avenue. If it be not, I should recommend him to pay no\r\nattention to the summons. Even in those streets with which he will\r\nbecome best acquainted, the houses are not continuous. There will be\r\na house, and then a blank; then two houses, and then a double blank.\r\nAfter that a hut or two, and then probably an excellent, roomy,\r\nhandsome family mansion. Taken altogether, Washington as a city is\r\nmost unsatisfactory, and falls more grievously short of the thing\r\nattempted than any other of the great undertakings of which I have\r\nseen anything in the States. San Jose, the capital of the republic of\r\nCosta Rica, in Central America, has been prepared and arranged as a\r\nnew city in the same way. But even San Jose comes nearer to what was\r\nintended than does Washington.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I do not believe in cities made after this fashion.\r\nCommerce, I think, must select the site of all large congregations of\r\nmankind. In some mysterious way she ascertains what she wants, and\r\nhaving acquired that, draws men in thousands round her properties.\r\nLiverpool, New York, Lyons, Glasgow, Venice, Marseilles, Hamburg,\r\nCalcutta, Chicago, and Leghorn, have all become populous, and are or\r\nhave been great, because trade found them to be convenient for its\r\npurposes. Trade seems to have ignored Washington altogether. Such\r\nbeing the case, the Legislature and the Executive of the country\r\ntogether have been unable to make of Washington anything better than\r\na straggling congregation of buildings in a wilderness. We are now\r\ntrying the same experiment at Ottawa, in Canada, having turned our\r\nback upon Montreal in dudgeon. The site of Ottawa is more interesting\r\nthan that of Washington, but I doubt whether the experiment will be\r\nmore successful. A new town for art, fashion, and politics has been\r\nbuilt at Munich, and there it seems to answer the expectation of the\r\nbuilders; but at Munich there is an old city as well, and commerce\r\nhad already got some considerable hold on the spot before the new\r\ntown was added to it.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Washington, such as exist, are all broad. Throughout\r\nthe town there are open spaces,--spaces, I mean, intended to be open\r\nby the plan laid down for the city. At the present moment it is\r\nalmost all open space. There is also a certain nobility about the\r\nproposed dimensions of the avenues and squares. Desirous of praising\r\nit in some degree, I can say that the design is grand. The thing\r\ndone, however, falls so infinitely short of that design, that nothing\r\nbut disappointment is felt. And I fear that there is no look-out\r\ninto the future which can justify a hope that the design will be\r\nfulfilled. It is therefore a melancholy place. The society into which\r\none falls there consists mostly of persons who are not permanently\r\nresident in the capital; but of those who were permanent residents I\r\nfound none who spoke of their city with affection. The men and women\r\nof Boston think that the sun shines nowhere else;--and Boston Common\r\nis very pleasant. The New Yorkers believe in Fifth Avenue with an\r\nunswerving faith; and Fifth Avenue is calculated to inspire a faith.\r\nPhiladelphia to a Philadelphian is the centre of the universe, and\r\nthe progress of Philadelphia, perhaps, justifies the partiality. The\r\nsame thing may be said of Chicago, of Buffalo, and of Baltimore. But\r\nthe same thing cannot be said in any degree of Washington. They who\r\nbelong to it turn up their noses at it. They feel that they live\r\nsurrounded by a failure. Its grand names are as yet false, and none\r\nof the efforts made have hitherto been successful. Even in winter,\r\nwhen Congress is sitting, Washington is melancholy;--but Washington\r\nin summer must surely be the saddest spot on earth.\r\n\r\nThere are six principal public buildings in Washington, as to which\r\nno expense seems to have been spared, and in the construction of\r\nwhich a certain amount of success has been obtained. In most of these\r\nthis success has been more or less marred by an independent deviation\r\nfrom recognized rules of architectural taste. These are the Capitol,\r\nthe Post-office, the Patent-office, the Treasury, the President's\r\nhouse, and the Smithsonian Institute. The five first are Grecian,\r\nand the last in Washington is called--Romanesque. Had I been left to\r\nclassify it by my own unaided lights, I should have called it bastard\r\nGothic.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol is by far the most imposing; and though there is much\r\nabout it with which I cannot but find fault, it certainly is\r\nimposing. The present building was, I think, commenced in 1815, the\r\nformer Capitol having been destroyed by the English in the war of\r\n1812-13. It was then finished according to the original plan, with a\r\nfine portico and well-proportioned pediment above it,--looking to the\r\neast. The outer flight of steps, leading up to this from the eastern\r\napproach, is good and in excellent taste. The expanse of the building\r\nto the right and left, as then arranged, was well proportioned,\r\nand, as far as we can now judge, the then existing dome was well\r\nproportioned also. As seen from the east the original building\r\nmust have been in itself very fine. The stone is beautiful, being\r\nbright almost as marble, and I do not know that there was any great\r\narchitectural defect to offend the eye. The figures in the pediment\r\nare mean. There is now in the Capitol a group apparently prepared for\r\na pediment, which is by no means mean. I was informed that they were\r\nintended for this position; but they, on the other hand, are too good\r\nfor such a place, and are also too numerous. This set of statues\r\nis by Crawford. Most of them are well known, and they are very\r\nfine. They now stand within the old chamber of the Representative\r\nHouse, and the pity is, that if elevated to such a position as that\r\nindicated, they can never be really seen. There are models of them\r\nall at West Point, and some of them I have seen at other places in\r\nmarble. The Historical Society at New York has one or two of them.\r\nIn and about the front of the Capitol there are other efforts of\r\nsculpture,--imposing in their size, and assuming, if not affecting,\r\nmuch in the attitudes chosen. Statuary at Washington runs too much on\r\ntwo subjects, which are repeated perhaps almost ad nauseam; one is\r\nthat of a stiff, steady-looking, healthy, but ugly individual, with\r\na square jaw and big jowl, which represents the great General; he\r\ndoes not prepossess the beholder, because he appears to be thoroughly\r\nill-natured. And the other represents a melancholy, weak figure\r\nwithout any hair, but often covered with feathers, and is intended\r\nto typify the red Indian. The red Indian is generally supposed to\r\nbe receiving comfort; but it is manifest that he never enjoys the\r\ncomfort ministered to him. There is a gigantic statue of Washington,\r\nby Greenough, out in the grounds in front of the building. The figure\r\nis seated and holding up one of its arms towards the city. There is\r\nabout it a kind of weighty magnificence; but it is stiff, ungainly,\r\nand altogether without life.\r\n\r\nBut the front of the original building is certainly grand. The\r\narchitect who designed it must have had skill, taste, and nobility of\r\nconception; but even this was spoilt, or rather wasted, by the fact\r\nthat the front is made to look upon nothing, and is turned from the\r\ncity. It is as though the _façade_ of the London Post-office had been\r\nmade to face the Goldsmiths' Hall. The Capitol stands upon the side\r\nof a hill, the front occupying a much higher position than the back;\r\nconsequently they who enter it from the back--and everybody does so\r\nenter it--are first called on to rise to the level of the lower floor\r\nby a stiff ascent of exterior steps, which are in no way grand or\r\nimposing, and then, having entered by a mean back-door, are instantly\r\nobliged to ascend again by another flight,--by stairs sufficiently\r\nappropriate to a back entrance, but altogether unfitted for the chief\r\napproach to such a building. It may, of course, be said that persons\r\nwho are particular in such matters should go in at the front door and\r\nnot at the back; but one must take these things as one finds them.\r\nThe entrance by which the Capitol is approached is such as I have\r\ndescribed. There are mean little brick chimneys at the left hand as\r\none walks in, attached to modern bakeries which have been constructed\r\nin the basement for the use of the soldiers; and there is on\r\nthe other hand the road by which waggons find their way to the\r\nunderground region with fuel, stationery, and other matters desired\r\nby senators and representatives,--and at present by bakers also.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the front I have spoken of it as it was originally\r\ndesigned and built. Since that period very heavy wings have been\r\nadded to the pile;--wings so heavy that they are or seem to be much\r\nlarger than the original structure itself. This, to my thinking, has\r\ndestroyed the symmetry of the whole. The wings, which in themselves\r\nare by no means devoid of beauty, are joined to the centre by\r\npassages so narrow that from exterior points of view the light can be\r\nseen through them. This robs the mass of all oneness, of all entirety\r\nas a whole, and gives a scattered straggling appearance where there\r\nshould be a look of massiveness and integrity. The dome also has been\r\nraised, a double drum having been given to it. This is unfinished\r\nand should not therefore yet be judged; but I cannot think that the\r\nincreased height will be an improvement. This again, to my eyes,\r\nappears to be straggling rather than massive. At a distance it\r\ncommands attention, and to one journeying through the desert places\r\nof the city gives that idea of Palmyra which I have before mentioned.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, and in spite of all that I have said, I have had\r\npleasure in walking backwards and forwards, and through the grounds\r\nwhich lie before the eastern front of the Capitol. The space for the\r\nview is ample, and the thing to be seen has points which are very\r\ngrand. If the Capitol were finished and all Washington were built\r\naround it, no man would say that the house in which Congress sat\r\ndisgraced the city.\r\n\r\nGoing west, but not due west, from the Capitol, Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nstretches in a right line to the Treasury Chambers. The distance is\r\nbeyond a mile, and men say, scornfully, that the two buildings have\r\nbeen put so far apart in order to save the Secretaries who sit in\r\nthe bureaux from a too rapid influx of members of Congress. This\r\nstatement I by no means indorse; but it is undoubtedly the fact that\r\nboth senators and representatives are very diligent in their calls\r\nupon gentlemen high in office. I have been present on some such\r\noccasions, and it has always seemed to me that questions of patronage\r\nhave been paramount. This reach of Pennsylvania Avenue is the quarter\r\nfor the best shops of Washington,--that is to say, the frequented\r\nside of it is so,--that side which is on your right as you leave the\r\nCapitol. Of the other side the world knows nothing. And very bad\r\nshops they are. I doubt whether there be any town in the world at all\r\nequal in importance to Washington, which is in such respects so ill\r\nprovided. The shops are bad and dear. In saying this I am guided by\r\nthe opinions of all whom I heard speak on the subject. The same thing\r\nwas told me of the hotels. Hearing that the city was very full at the\r\ntime of my visit--full to overflowing--I had obtained private rooms\r\nthrough a friend before I went there. Had I not done so, I might have\r\nlain in the streets, or have made one with three or four others in a\r\nsmall room at some third-rate inn. There had never been so great a\r\nthrong in the town. I am bound to say that my friend did well for me.\r\nI found myself put up at the house of one Wormley, a coloured man, in\r\nI Street, to whose attention I can recommend any Englishman who may\r\nchance to want quarters in Washington. He has an hotel on one side of\r\nthe street, and private lodging-houses on the other in which I found\r\nmyself located. From what I heard of the hotels I conceived myself\r\nto be greatly in luck. Willard's is the chief of these, and the\r\neverlasting crowd and throng of men with which the halls and passages\r\nof the house were always full, certainly did not seem to promise\r\neither privacy or comfort. But then there are places in which\r\nprivacy and comfort are not expected,--are hardly even desired,--and\r\nWashington is one of them.\r\n\r\nThe Post-office and the Patent-office lie a little away from\r\nPennsylvania Avenue in F Street, and are opposite to each other. The\r\nPost-office is certainly a very graceful building. It is square, and\r\nhardly can be said to have any settled front or any grand entrance.\r\nIt is not approached by steps, but stands flush on the ground,\r\nalike on each of the four sides. It is ornamented with Corinthian\r\npilasters, but is not over ornamented. It is certainly a structure\r\ncreditable to any city. The streets around it are all unfinished, and\r\nit is approached through seas of mud and sloughs of despond, which\r\nhave been contrived, as I imagine, to lessen, if possible, the\r\ncrowd of callers, and lighten in this way the overtasked officials\r\nwithin. That side by which the public in general were supposed to\r\napproach was, during my sojourn, always guarded by vast mountains of\r\nflour-barrels. Looking up at the windows of the building I perceived\r\nalso that barrels were piled within, and then I knew that the\r\nPost-office had become a provision depot for the army. The official\r\narrangements here for the public were so bad as to be absolutely\r\nbarbarous. I feel some remorse in saying this, for I was myself\r\ntreated with the utmost courtesy by gentlemen holding high positions\r\nin the office,--to which I was specially attracted by my own\r\nconnection with the Post-office in England. But I do not think that\r\nsuch courtesy should hinder me from telling what I saw that was\r\nbad,--seeing that it would not hinder me from telling what I saw that\r\nwas good. In Washington there is but one Post-office. There are no\r\niron pillars or wayside letter-boxes, as are to be found in other\r\ntowns of the Union;--no subsidiary offices at which stamps can be\r\nbought and letters posted. The distances of the city are very great,\r\nthe means of transit through the city very limited, the dirt of the\r\ncity ways unrivalled in depth and tenacity; and yet there is but one\r\nPost-office. Nor is there any established system of letter-carriers.\r\nTo those who desire it, letters are brought out and delivered by\r\ncarriers who charge a separate porterage for that service; but\r\nthe rule is that letters shall be delivered from the window. For\r\nstrangers this is of course a necessity of their position; and I\r\nfound that when once I had left instructions that my letters should\r\nbe delivered, those instructions were carefully followed. Indeed\r\nnothing could exceed the civility of the officials within;--but so\r\nalso nothing can exceed the barbarity of the arrangements without.\r\nThe purchase of stamps I found to be utterly impracticable. They\r\nwere sold at a window in a corner, at which newspapers were also\r\ndelivered, to which there was no regular ingress, and from which\r\nthere was no egress. It would generally be deeply surrounded by a\r\ncrowd of muddy soldiers, who would wait there patiently till time\r\nshould enable them to approach the window. The delivery of letters\r\nwas almost more tedious, though in that there was a method. The\r\naspirants stood in a long line, _en cue_, as we are told by Carlyle\r\nthat the bread-seekers used to approach the bakers' shops at Paris\r\nduring the Revolution. This \"cue\" would sometimes project out into\r\nthe street. The work inside was done very slowly. The clerk had no\r\nfacility, by use of a desk or otherwise, for running through the\r\nletters under the initials denominated, but turned letter by letter\r\nthrough his hand. To one questioner out of ten would a letter\r\nbe given. It no doubt may be said in excuse for this that the\r\npresence of the army round Washington caused at that period special\r\ninconvenience; and that plea should of course be taken, were it\r\nnot that a very trifling alteration in the management within would\r\nhave remedied all the inconvenience. As a building the Washington\r\nPost-office is very good; as the centre of a most complicated and\r\ndifficult department, I believe it to be well managed: but as regards\r\nthe special accommodation given by it to the city in which it stands,\r\nmuch cannot, I think, be said in its favour.\r\n\r\nOpposite to that which is, I presume, the back of the Post-office,\r\nstands the Patent-office. This also is a grand building, with a fine\r\nportico of Doric pillars at each of its three fronts. These are\r\napproached by flights of steps, more gratifying to the eye than to\r\nthe legs. The whole structure is massive and grand, and, if the\r\nstreets round it were finished, would be imposing. The utilitarian\r\nspirit of the nation has, however, done much toward marring the\r\nappearance of the building, by piercing it with windows altogether\r\nunsuited to it, both in number and size. The walls, even under the\r\nporticoes, have been so pierced, in order that the whole space might\r\nbe utilized without loss of light; and the effect is very mean. The\r\nwindows are small and without ornament,--something like a London\r\nwindow of the time of George III. The effect produced by a dozen such\r\nat the back of a noble Doric porch, looking down among the pillars,\r\nmay be imagined.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of this building the Minister of the Interior holds\r\nhis court, and of course also the Commissioners of Patents. Here is,\r\nin accordance with the name of the building, a museum of models of\r\nall patents taken out. I wandered through it, gazing with listless\r\neye, now upon this, and now upon that; but to me, in my ignorance,\r\nit was no better than a large toy-shop. When I saw an ancient\r\ndusty white hat, with some peculiar appendage to it which was\r\nunintelligible, it was no more to me than any other old white hat.\r\nBut had I been a man of science, what a tale it might have told!\r\nWandering about through the Patent-office I also found a hospital for\r\nsoldiers. A British officer was with me who pronounced it to be, in\r\nits kind, very good. At any rate it was sweet, airy, and large. In\r\nthese days the soldiers had got hold of everything.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Chambers is as yet an unfinished building. The front\r\nto the south has been completed; but that to the north has not been\r\nbuilt. Here at the north stands as yet the old Secretary of State's\r\noffice. This is to come down, and the Secretary of State is to be\r\nlocated in the new building, which will be added to the Treasury.\r\nThis edifice will probably strike strangers more forcibly than any\r\nother in the town, both from its position and from its own character.\r\nIt stands with its side to Pennsylvania Avenue, but the avenue here\r\nhas turned round, and runs due north and south, having taken a twist,\r\nso as to make way for the Treasury and for the President's house,\r\nthrough both of which it must run had it been carried straight on\r\nthroughout. These public offices stand with their side to the street,\r\nand the whole length is ornamented with an exterior row of Ionic\r\ncolumns raised high above the footway. This is perhaps the prettiest\r\nthing in the city, and when the front to the north has been\r\ncompleted, the effect will be still better. The granite monoliths\r\nwhich have been used, and which are to be used, in this building are\r\nvery massive. As one enters by the steps to the south there are two\r\nflat stones, one on each side of the ascent, the surface of each\r\nof which is about 20 feet by 18. The columns are, I think, all\r\nmonoliths. Of those which are still to be erected, and which now lie\r\nabout in the neighbouring streets, I measured one or two--one which\r\nwas still in the rough I found to be 32 feet long by 5 feet broad,\r\nand 4½ deep. These granite blocks have been brought to Washington\r\nfrom the State of Maine. The finished front of this building, looking\r\ndown to the Potomac, is very good; but to my eyes this also has been\r\nmuch injured by the rows of windows which look out from the building\r\ninto the space of the portico.\r\n\r\nThe President's house--or the White House as it is now called all the\r\nworld over--is a handsome mansion fitted for the chief officer of\r\na great Republic, and nothing more. I think I may say that we have\r\nprivate houses in London considerably larger. It is neat and pretty,\r\nand with all its immediate outside belongings calls down no adverse\r\ncriticism. It faces on to a small garden, which seems to be always\r\naccessible to the public, and opens out upon that everlasting\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, which has now made another turn. Here in front\r\nof the White House is President's Square, as it is generally called.\r\nThe technical name is, I believe, La Fayette Square. The houses round\r\nit are few in number,--not exceeding three or four on each side, but\r\nthey are among the best in Washington, and the whole place is neat\r\nand well kept. President's Square is certainly the most attractive\r\npart of the city. The garden of the square is always open, and does\r\nnot seem to suffer from any public ill-usage; by which circumstance\r\nI am again led to suggest that the gardens of our London squares\r\nmight be thrown open in the same way. In the centre of this one\r\nat Washington, immediately facing the President's house, is an\r\nequestrian statue of General Jackson. It is very bad; but that it\r\nis not nearly as bad as it might be is proved by another equestrian\r\nstatue,--of General Washington,--erected in the centre of a small\r\ngarden-plat at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue, near the bridge\r\nleading to Georgetown. Of all the statues on horseback which I ever\r\nsaw, either in marble or bronze, this is by far the worst and most\r\nridiculous. The horse is most absurd, but the man sitting on the\r\nhorse is manifestly drunk. I should think the time must come when\r\nthis figure at any rate will be removed.\r\n\r\nI did not go inside the President's house, not having had while\r\nat Washington an opportunity of paying my personal respects to Mr.\r\nLincoln. I had been told that this was to be done without trouble,\r\nbut when I inquired on the subject I found that this was not exactly\r\nthe case. I believe there are times when anybody may walk into the\r\nPresident's house without an introduction; but that, I take it, is\r\nnot considered to be the proper way of doing the work. I found that\r\nsomething like a favour would be incurred, or that some disagreeable\r\ntrouble would be given, if I made a request to be presented,--and\r\ntherefore I left Washington without seeing the great man.\r\n\r\nThe President's house is nice to look at, but it is built on marshy\r\nground, not much above the level of the Potomac, and is very\r\nunhealthy. I was told that all who live there become subject to fever\r\nand ague, and that few who now live there have escaped it altogether.\r\nThis comes of choosing the site of a new city, and decreeing that it\r\nshall be built on this or on that spot. Large cities, especially in\r\nthese latter days, do not collect themselves in unhealthy places. Men\r\ndesert such localities,--or at least do not congregate at them when\r\ntheir character is once known. But the poor President cannot desert\r\nthe White House. He must make the most of the residence which the\r\nnation has prepared for him.\r\n\r\nOf the other considerable public building of Washington, called the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, I have said that its style was bastard\r\nGothic; by this I mean that its main attributes are Gothic, but that\r\nliberties have been taken with it, which, whether they may injure its\r\nbeauty or no, certainly are subversive of architectural purity. It is\r\nbuilt of red stone, and is not ugly in itself. There is a very nice\r\nNorman porch to it, and little bits of Lombard Gothic have been well\r\ncopied from Cologne. But windows have been fitted in with stilted\r\narches, of which the stilts seem to crack and bend, so narrow are\r\nthey and so high. And then the towers with high pinnacled roofs are a\r\nmistake,--unless indeed they be needed to give to the whole structure\r\nthat name of Romanesque which it has assumed. The building is used\r\nfor museums and lectures, and was given to the city by one James\r\nSmithson, an Englishman. I cannot say that the city of Washington\r\nseems to be grateful, for all to whom I spoke on the subject hinted\r\nthat the Institution was a failure. It is to be remarked that nobody\r\nin Washington is proud of Washington, or of anything in it. If the\r\nSmithsonian Institution were at New York or at Boston, one would have\r\na different story to tell.\r\n\r\nThere has been an attempt made to raise at Washington a vast obelisk\r\nto the memory of Washington,--the first in war and first in peace,\r\nas the country is proud to call him. This obelisk is a fair type\r\nof the city. It is unfinished,--not a third of it having as yet\r\nbeen erected,--and in all human probability ever will remain so. If\r\nfinished it would be the highest monument of its kind standing on the\r\nface of the globe,--and yet, after all, what would it be even then as\r\ncompared with one of the great pyramids? Modern attempts cannot bear\r\ncomparison with those of the old world in simple vastness. But in\r\nlieu of simple vastness, the modern world aims to achieve either\r\nbeauty or utility. By the Washington monument, if completed, neither\r\nwould be achieved. An obelisk with the proportions of a needle\r\nmay be very graceful; but an obelisk which requires an expanse of\r\nflat-roofed, sprawling buildings for its base, and of which the shaft\r\nshall be as big as a cathedral tower, cannot be graceful. At present\r\nsome third portion of the shaft has been built, and there it stands.\r\nNo one has a word to say for it. No one thinks that money will ever\r\nagain be subscribed for its completion. I saw somewhere a box of\r\nplate-glass kept for contributions for this purpose, and looking in\r\nperceived that two half-dollar pieces had been given;--but both of\r\nthem were bad. I was told also that the absolute foundation of the\r\nedifice is bad;--that the ground, which is near the river and swampy,\r\nwould not bear the weight intended to be imposed on it.\r\n\r\nA sad and saddening spot was that marsh, as I wandered down on it all\r\nalone one Sunday afternoon. The ground was frozen and I could walk\r\ndry-shod, but there was not a blade of grass. Around me on all sides\r\nwere cattle in great numbers--steers and big oxen--lowing in their\r\nhunger for a meal. They were beef for the army, and never again I\r\nsuppose would it be allowed to them to fill their big maws and chew\r\nthe patient cud. There, on the brown, ugly, undrained field, within\r\neasy sight of the President's house, stood the useless, shapeless,\r\ngraceless pile of stones. It was as though I were looking on the\r\ngenius of the city. It was vast, pretentious, bold, boastful with a\r\nloud voice, already taller by many heads than other obelisks, but\r\nnevertheless still in its infancy,--ugly, unpromising, and false. The\r\nfounder of the monument had said, Here shall be the obelisk of the\r\nworld! and the founder of the city had thought of his child somewhat\r\nin the same strain. It is still possible that both city and monument\r\nshall be completed; but at the present moment nobody seems to believe\r\nin the one or in the other. For myself I have much faith in the\r\nAmerican character, but I cannot believe either in Washington city or\r\nin the Washington monument. The boast made has been too loud, and the\r\nfulfilment yet accomplished has been too small!\r\n\r\nHave I as yet said that Washington was dirty in that winter of\r\n1861-1862? Or, I should rather ask, have I made it understood that\r\nin walking about Washington one waded as deep in mud as one does in\r\nfloundering through an ordinary ploughed field in November? There\r\nwere parts of Pennsylvania Avenue which would have been considered\r\nheavy ground by most hunting-men, and through some of the remoter\r\nstreets none but light weights could have lived long. This was the\r\nstate of the town when I left it in the middle of January. On my\r\narrival in the middle of December, everything was in a cloud of\r\ndust. One walked through an atmosphere of floating mud; for the dirt\r\nwas ponderous and thick, and very palpable in its atoms. Then came\r\na severe frost and a little snow; and if one did not fall while\r\nwalking, it was very well. After that we had the thaw; and Washington\r\nassumed its normal winter condition. I must say that, during the\r\nwhole of this time, the atmosphere was to me exhilarating; but I was\r\nhardly out of the doctor's hands while I was there, and he did not\r\nsupport my theory as to the goodness of the air. \"It is poisoned by\r\nthe soldiers,\" he said, \"and everybody is ill.\" But then my doctor\r\nwas perhaps a little tinged with southern proclivities.\r\n\r\nOn the Virginian side of the Potomac stands a country-house called\r\nArlington Heights, from which there is a fine view down upon the\r\ncity. Arlington Heights is a beautiful spot,--having all the\r\nattractions of a fine park in our country. It is covered with grand\r\ntimber. The ground is varied and broken, and the private roads about\r\nsweep here into a dell and then up a brae-side, as roads should do in\r\nsuch a domain. Below it was the Potomac, and immediately on the other\r\nside stands the city of Washington. Any city seen thus is graceful;\r\nand the white stones of the big buildings when the sun gleams on\r\nthem, showing the distant rows of columns, seem to tell something of\r\ngreat endeavour and of achieved success. It is the place from whence\r\nWashington should be seen by those who wish to think well of the\r\npresent city and of its future prosperity. But is it not the case\r\nthat every city is beautiful from a distance?\r\n\r\nThe house at Arlington Heights is picturesque, but neither large\r\nnor good. It has before it a high Greek colonnade, which seems to\r\nbe almost bigger than the house itself. Had such been built in a\r\ncity,--and many such a portico does stand in cities through the\r\nStates,--it would be neither picturesque nor graceful; but here it is\r\nsurrounded by timber, and as the columns are seen through the trees,\r\nthey gratify the eye rather than offend it. The place did belong,\r\nand as I think does still belong, to the family of the Lees,--if not\r\nalready confiscated. General Lee, who is or would be the present\r\nowner, bears high command in the army of the Confederalists, and\r\nknows well by what tenure he holds, or is likely to hold, his family\r\nproperty. The family were friends of General Washington, whose seat,\r\nMount Vernon, stands about twelve miles lower down the river; and\r\nhere, no doubt, Washington often stood, looking on the site he had\r\nchosen. If his spirit could stand there now and look around upon the\r\nmasses of soldiers by which his capital is surrounded, how would it\r\naddress the city of his hopes? When he saw that every foot of the\r\nneighbouring soil was desecrated by a camp, or torn into loathsome\r\nfurrows of mud by cannon and army waggons,--that agriculture was\r\ngone, and that every effort both of North and South was concentrated\r\non the art of killing; when he saw that this was done on the very\r\nspot chosen by himself for the centre temple of an everlasting union,\r\nwhat would he then say as to that boast made on his behalf by his\r\ncountrymen that he was first in war and first in peace? Washington\r\nwas a great man, and I believe a good man. I, at any rate, will not\r\nbelittle him. I think that he had the firmness and audacity necessary\r\nfor a revolutionary leader, that he had honesty to preserve him from\r\nthe temptations of ambition and ostentation, and that he had the good\r\nsense to be guided in civil matters by men who had studied the laws\r\nof social life and the theories of free government. He was _justus\r\net tenax propositi_; and in periods that might well have dismayed\r\na smaller man, he feared neither the throne to which he opposed\r\nhimself, nor the changing voices of the fellow-citizens for whose\r\nwelfare he had fought. But sixty or seventy years will not suffice to\r\ngive to a man the fame of having been first among all men. Washington\r\ndid much, and I for one do not believe that his work will perish.\r\nBut I have always found it difficult,--I may say impossible,--to\r\nsound his praises in his own land. Let us suppose that a courteous\r\nFrenchman ventures an opinion among Englishmen that Wellington was a\r\ngreat general, would he feel disposed to go on with his eulogium when\r\nencountered on two or three sides at once with such observations as\r\nthe following:--\"I should rather calculate he was; about the first\r\nthat ever did live or ever will live. Why, he whipped your Napoleon\r\neverlasting whenever he met him. He whipped everybody out of the\r\nfield. There warn't anybody ever lived was able to stand nigh him,\r\nand there won't come any like him again. Sir, I guess our Wellington\r\nnever had his likes on your side of the water. Such men can't\r\ngrow in a down-trodden country of slaves and paupers.\" Under such\r\ncircumstances the Frenchman would probably be shut up. And when I\r\nstrove to speak of Washington I generally found myself shut up also.\r\n\r\nArlington Heights, when I was at Washington, was the head-quarters of\r\nGeneral M'Dowell, the General to whom is attributed--I believe most\r\nwrongfully--the loss of the battle of Bull's Run. The whole place was\r\nthen one camp. The fences had disappeared. The gardens were trodden\r\ninto mud. The roads had been cut to pieces, and new tracks made\r\neverywhere through the grounds. But the timber still remained. Some\r\nno doubt had fallen, but enough stood for the ample ornamentation\r\nof the place. I saw placards up, prohibiting the destruction of the\r\ntrees, and it is to be hoped that they have been spared. Very little\r\nin this way has been spared in the country all around.\r\n\r\nMount Vernon, Washington's own residence, stands close over the\r\nPotomac, above six miles below Alexandria. It will be understood that\r\nthe capital is on the eastern, or Maryland side of the river, and\r\nthat Arlington Heights, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon are in Virginia.\r\nThe river Potomac divided the two old colonies, or States as they\r\nafterwards became; but when Washington was to be built, a territory,\r\nsaid to be ten miles square, was cut out of the two States and was\r\ncalled the district of Columbia. The greater portion of this district\r\nwas taken from Maryland, and on that the city was built. It comprised\r\nthe pleasant town of Georgetown, which is now a suburb--and the only\r\nsuburb--of Washington. The portion of the district on the Virginian\r\nside included Arlington Heights, and went so far down the river as\r\nto take in the Virginian city of Alexandria. This was the extreme\r\nwestern point of the district; but since that arrangement was made,\r\nthe State of Virginia petitioned to have their portion of Columbia\r\nback again, and this petition was granted. Now it is felt that the\r\nland on both sides of the river should belong to the city, and the\r\nGovernment is anxious to get back the Virginian section. The city and\r\nthe immediate vicinity are freed from all State allegiance, and are\r\nunder the immediate rule of the United States Government,--having of\r\ncourse its own municipality; but the inhabitants have no political\r\npower, as power is counted in the States. They vote for no political\r\nofficer, not even for the President, and return no member to\r\nCongress, either as a senator or as a representative. Mount Vernon\r\nwas never within the district of Columbia.\r\n\r\nWhen I first made inquiry on the subject I was told that Mount Vernon\r\nat that time was not to be reached;--that though it was not in the\r\nhands of the rebels, neither was it in the hands of Northerners, and\r\nthat therefore strangers could not go there; but this, though it\r\nwas told to me and others by those who should have known the facts,\r\nwas not the case. I had gone down the river with a party of ladies,\r\nand we were opposite to Mount Vernon; but on that occasion we were\r\nassured we could not land. The rebels, we were told, would certainly\r\nseize the ladies, and carry them off into Secessia. On hearing which\r\nthe ladies were of course doubly anxious to be landed. But our stern\r\ncommander, for we were on a Government boat, would not listen to\r\ntheir prayers, but carried us instead on board the \"Pensacola,\" a\r\nsloop-of-war which was now lying in the river, ready to go to sea,\r\nand ready also to run the gauntlet of the rebel batteries which lined\r\nthe Virginian shore of the river for many miles down below Alexandria\r\nand Mount Vernon. A sloop-of-war in these days means a large\r\nman-of-war, the guns of which are so big that they only stand on\r\none deck, whereas a frigate would have them on two decks, and a\r\nline-of-battle ship on three. Of line-of-battle ships there will, I\r\nsuppose, soon be none, as the \"Warrior\" is only a frigate. We went\r\nover the \"Pensacola,\" and I must say she was very nice, pretty, and\r\nclean. I have always found American sailors on their men-of-war to\r\nbe clean and nice-looking,--as much so I should say as our own; but\r\nnothing can be dirtier, more untidy, or apparently more ill-preserved\r\nthan all the appurtenances of their soldiers.\r\n\r\nWe landed also on this occasion at Alexandria, and saw as melancholy\r\nand miserable a town as the mind of man can conceive. Its ordinary\r\nmale population, counting by the voters, is 1500, and of these 700\r\nwere in the southern army. The place had been made a hospital for\r\nnorthern soldiers, and no doubt the site for that purpose had been\r\nwell chosen. But let any woman imagine what would be the feelings of\r\nher life while living in a town used as a hospital for the enemies\r\nagainst whom her absent husband was then fighting! Her own man would\r\nbe away ill,--wounded, dying, for what she knew, without the comfort\r\nof any hospital attendance, without physic, with no one to comfort\r\nhim; but those she hated, with a hatred much keener than his, were\r\nclose to her hand, using some friend's house that had been forcibly\r\ntaken, crawling out into the sun under her eyes, taking the bread\r\nfrom her mouth! Life in Alexandria at this time must have been sad\r\nenough. The people were all secessionists, but the town was held by\r\nthe northern party. Through the lines, into Virginia, they could not\r\ngo at all. Up to Washington they could not go without a military\r\npass, not to be obtained without some cause given. All trade was at\r\nan end. In no town at that time was trade very flourishing; but here\r\nit was killed altogether,--except that absolutely necessary trade of\r\nbread. Who would buy boots or coats, or want new saddles, or waste\r\nmoney on books, in such days as these, in such a town as Alexandria?\r\nAnd then out of 1500 men, one-half had gone to fight the southern\r\nbattles! Among the women of Alexandria secession would have found but\r\nfew opponents.\r\n\r\nIt was here that a hot-brained young man, named Ellsworth, was killed\r\nin the early days of the rebellion. He was a colonel in the northern\r\nvolunteer army, and on entering Alexandria found a secession flag\r\nflying at the chief hotel. Instead of sending up a corporal's guard\r\nto remove it, he rushed up and pulled it down with his own hand. As\r\nhe descended, the landlord shot him dead, and one of his soldiers\r\nshot the landlord dead. It was a pity that so brave a lad, who had\r\nrisen so high, should fall so vainly; but they have made a hero of\r\nhim in America;--have inscribed his name on marble monuments, and\r\ncounted him up among their great men. In all this their mistake\r\nis very great. It is bad for a country to have no names worthy of\r\nmonumental brass; but it is worse for a country to have monumental\r\nbrasses covered with names which have never been made worthy of such\r\nhonour. Ellsworth had shown himself to be brave and foolish. Let his\r\nfolly be pardoned on the score of his courage, and there, I think,\r\nshould have been an end of it.\r\n\r\nI found afterwards that Mount Vernon was accessible, and I rode\r\nthither with some officers from the staff of General Heintzleman,\r\nwhose outside pickets were stationed beyond the old place. I\r\ncertainly should not have been well pleased had I been forced to\r\nleave the country without seeing the house in which Washington had\r\nlived and died. Till lately this place was owned and inhabited by\r\none of the family, a Washington, descended from a brother of the\r\nGeneral's; but it has now become the property of the country, under\r\nthe auspices of Mr. Everett, by whose exertions was raised the money\r\nwith which it was purchased. It is a long house, of two stories,\r\nbuilt, I think, chiefly of wood, with a verandah, or rather long\r\nportico, attached to the front, which looks upon the river. There are\r\ntwo wings, or sets of outhouses, containing the kitchen and servants'\r\nrooms, which were joined by open wooden verandahs to the main\r\nbuilding; but one of these verandahs has gone, under the influence of\r\nyears. By these a semicircular sweep is formed before the front door,\r\nwhich opens away from the river, and towards the old prim gardens,\r\nin which, we were told, General Washington used to take much delight.\r\nThere is nothing very special about the house. Indeed, as a house, it\r\nwould now be found comfortless and inconvenient. But the ground falls\r\nwell down to the river, and the timber, if not fine, is plentiful\r\nand picturesque. The chief interest of the place, however, is in the\r\ntomb of Washington and his wife. It must be understood that it was a\r\ncommon practice throughout the States to make a family burying-ground\r\nin any secluded spot on the family property. I have not unfrequently\r\ncome across these in my rambles, and in Virginia I have encountered\r\nsmall, unpretending gravestones under a shady elm, dated as lately as\r\neight or ten years back. At Mount Vernon there is now a cemetery of\r\nthe Washington family; and there, in an open vault--a vault open, but\r\nguarded by iron grating--is the great man's tomb, and by his side\r\nthe tomb of Martha his wife. As I stood there alone, with no one\r\nby to irritate me by assertions of the man's absolute supremacy, I\r\nacknowledged that I had come to the final resting-place of a great\r\nand good man,--of a man whose patriotism was, I believe, an honest\r\nfeeling, untinged by any personal ambition of a selfish nature. That\r\nhe was pre-eminently a successful man may have been due chiefly to\r\nthe excellence of his cause, and the blood and character of the\r\npeople who put him forward as their right arm in their contest;\r\nbut that he did not mar that success by arrogance, or destroy the\r\nbrightness of his own name by personal aggrandisement, is due to a\r\nnoble nature and to the calm individual excellence of the man.\r\n\r\nConsidering the circumstances and history of the place, the position\r\nof Mount Vernon, as I saw it, was very remarkable. It lay exactly\r\nbetween the lines of the two armies. The pickets of the Northern\r\narmy had been extended beyond it, not improbably with the express\r\nintention of keeping a spot so hallowed within the power of the\r\nnorthern Government. But since the war began it had been in the\r\nhands of the seceders. In fact, it stood there in the middle of the\r\nbattle-field, on the very line of division between loyalism and\r\nsecession. And this was the spot which Washington had selected as the\r\nheart and centre, and safest rallying homestead of the united nation\r\nwhich he left behind him. But Washington, when he resolved to found\r\nhis capital on the banks of the Potomac, knew nothing of the glories\r\nof the Mississippi. He did not dream of the speedy addition to his\r\nalready gathered constellations of those Western stars, of Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, Minnesota, and Iowa; nor did he dream of Texas conquered,\r\nLouisiana purchased, and Missouri and Kansas rescued from the\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nI have said that Washington was at that time,--the Christmas of\r\n1861-1862,--a melancholy place. This was partly owing to the\r\ndespondent tone in which so many Americans then spoke of their own\r\naffairs. It was not that the northern men thought that they were to\r\nbe beaten, or that the southern men feared that things were going bad\r\nwith their party across the river; but that nobody seemed to have any\r\nfaith in anybody. Maclellan had been put up as the true man--exalted\r\nperhaps too quickly, considering the limited opportunities for\r\ndistinguishing himself which fortune had thrown in his way; but now\r\nbelief in Maclellan seemed to be slipping away. One felt that it was\r\nso from day to day, though it was impossible to define how or whence\r\nthe feeling came. And then the character of the ministry fared still\r\nworse in public estimation. That Lincoln, the President, was honest,\r\nand that Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, was able, was the only\r\ngood that one heard spoken. At this time two Jonahs were specially\r\npointed out as necessary sacrifices, by whose immersion into the\r\ncomfortless ocean of private life the ship might perhaps be saved.\r\nThese were Mr. Cameron, the Secretary of War, and Mr. Welles, the\r\nSecretary of the Navy. It was said that Lincoln, when pressed to rid\r\nhis Cabinet of Cameron, had replied, that when a man was crossing a\r\nstream the moment was hardly convenient for changing his horse; but\r\nit came to that at last, that he found he must change his horse, even\r\nin the very sharpest run of the river. Better that than sit an animal\r\non whose exertions he knew that he could not trust. So Mr. Cameron\r\nwent, and Mr. Stanton became Secretary at War in his place. But Mr.\r\nCameron, though put out of the Cabinet, was to be saved from absolute\r\ndisgrace by being sent as Minister to Russia. I do not know that\r\nit would become me here to repeat the accusations made against Mr.\r\nCameron, but it had long seemed to me that the maintenance in such\r\na position, at such a time, of a gentleman who had to sustain such\r\na universal absence of public confidence, must have been most\r\ndetrimental to the army and to the Government.\r\n\r\nMen whom one met in Washington were not unhappy about the state of\r\nthings, as I had seen men unhappy in the North and in the West. They\r\nwere mainly indifferent, but with that sort of indifference which\r\narises from a break down of faith in anything. \"There was the army!\r\nYes, the army! But what an army! Nobody obeyed anybody. Nobody did\r\nanything! Nobody thought of advancing! There were, perhaps, two\r\nhundred thousand men assembled round Washington; and now the effort\r\nof supplying them with food and clothing was as much as could be\r\naccomplished! But the contractors, in the meantime, were becoming\r\nrich. And then as to the Government! Who trusted it? Who would put\r\ntheir faith in Seward and Cameron? Cameron was now gone, it was true;\r\nand in that way the whole of the Cabinet would soon be broken up. As\r\nto Congress, what could Congress do? Ask questions which no one would\r\ncare to answer, and finally get itself packed up and sent home.\" The\r\nPresident and the constitution fared no better in men's mouths. The\r\nformer did nothing,--neither harm nor good; and as for the latter, it\r\nhad broken down and shown itself to be inefficient. So men ate, and\r\ndrank, and laughed, waiting till chaos should come, secure in the\r\nbelief that the atoms into which their world would resolve itself,\r\nwould connect themselves again in some other form without trouble on\r\ntheir part.\r\n\r\nAnd at Washington I found no strong feeling against England and\r\nEnglish conduct towards America. \"We men of the world,\" a Washington\r\nman might have said, \"know very well that everybody must take care of\r\nhimself first. We are very good friends with you,--of course, and are\r\nvery glad to see you at our table whenever you come across the water;\r\nbut as for rejoicing at your joys, or expecting you to sympathize\r\nwith our sorrows, we know the world too well for that. We are\r\nsplitting into pieces, and of course that is gain to you. Take\r\nanother cigar.\" This polite, fashionable, and certainly comfortable\r\nway of looking at the matter had never been attained at New York or\r\nPhiladelphia, at Boston or Chicago. The northern provincial world\r\nof the States had declared to itself that those who were not with\r\nit were against it; that its neighbours should be either friends or\r\nfoes; that it would understand nothing of neutrality. This was often\r\nmortifying to me, but I think I liked it better on the whole than the\r\n_laisser-aller_ indifference of Washington.\r\n\r\nEverybody acknowledged that society in Washington had been almost\r\ndestroyed by the loss of the southern half of the usual sojourners in\r\nthe city. The senators and members of Government, who heretofore had\r\ncome from the southern States, had no doubt spent more money in the\r\ncapital than their northern brethren. They and their families had\r\nbeen more addicted to social pleasures. They are the descendants of\r\nthe old English Cavaliers, whereas the northern men have come from\r\nthe old English Roundheads. Or if, as may be the case, the blood\r\nof the races has now been too well mixed to allow of this being\r\nsaid with absolute truth, yet something of the manners of the old\r\nforefathers has been left. The southern gentleman is more genial,\r\nless dry,--I will not say more hospitable, but more given to enjoy\r\nhospitality than his northern brother; and this difference is quite\r\nas strong with the women as with the men. It may therefore be\r\nunderstood that secession would be very fatal to the society of\r\nWashington. It was not only that the members of Congress were not\r\nthere. As to very many of the representatives, it may be said that\r\nthey do not belong sufficiently to Washington to make a part of its\r\nsociety. It is not every representative that is, perhaps, qualified\r\nto do so. But secession had taken away from Washington those who\r\nheld property in the South--who were bound to the South by any ties,\r\nwhether political or other; who belonged to the South by blood,\r\neducation, and old habits. In very many cases--nay, in most such\r\ncases--it had been necessary that a man should select whether he\r\nwould be a friend to the South, and therefore a rebel; or else an\r\nenemy to the South, and therefore untrue to all the predilections and\r\nsympathies of his life. Here has been the hardship. For such people\r\nthere has been no neutrality possible. Ladies even have not been able\r\nto profess themselves simply anxious for peace and goodwill, and so\r\nto remain tranquil. They who are not for me are against me, has been\r\nspoken by one side and by the other. And I suppose that in all civil\r\nwar it is necessary that it should be so. I heard of various cases\r\nin which father and son had espoused different sides in order that\r\nproperty might be retained both in the North and in the South. Under\r\nsuch circumstances it may be supposed that society in Washington\r\nwould be considerably cut up. All this made the place somewhat\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the Capitol much space is at present wasted, but\r\nthis arises from the fact of great additions to the original plan\r\nhaving been made. The two chambers,--that of the Senate and of the\r\nRepresentatives, are in the two new wings, on the middle, or what we\r\ncall the first-floor. The entrance is made under a dome, to a large\r\ncircular hall, which is hung around with surely the worst pictures by\r\nwhich a nation ever sought to glorify its own deeds. There are yards\r\nof paintings at Versailles which are bad enough; but there is nothing\r\nat Versailles comparable in villany to the huge daubs which are\r\npreserved in this hall at the Capitol. It is strange that even\r\nself-laudatory patriotism should desire the perpetuation of such\r\nrubbish. When I was there the new dome was still in progress, and an\r\nugly column of woodwork, required for internal support and affording\r\na staircase to the top, stood in this hall. This of course was a\r\ntemporary and necessary evil; but even this was hung around with the\r\nvilest of portraits.\r\n\r\nFrom the hall, turning to the left, if the entrance be made at the\r\nfront door, one goes to the new Chamber of Representatives, passing\r\nthrough that which was the old chamber. This is now dedicated to the\r\nexposition of various new figures by Crawford, and to the sale of\r\ntarts and gingerbread,--of very bad tarts and gingerbread. Let that\r\nold woman look to it, or let the House dismiss her. In fact this\r\nchamber is now but a vestibule to a passage, a second hall as it\r\nwere, and thus thrown away. Changes probably will be made which will\r\nbring it into some use, or some scheme of ornamentation. From this\r\na passage runs to the Representative Chamber, passing between those\r\ntell-tale windows, which, looking to the right and left, proclaim the\r\ntenuity of the building. The windows on one side, that looking to the\r\neast or front, should, I think, be closed. The appearance, both from\r\nthe inside and from the outside, would be thus improved.\r\n\r\nThe Representative Chamber itself--which of course answers to our\r\nHouse of Commons--is a handsome, commodious room, admirably fitted\r\nfor the purposes required. It strikes one as rather low, but I doubt\r\nif it were higher whether it would be better adapted for hearing.\r\nEven at present it is not perfect in this respect as regards the\r\nlisteners in the gallery. It is a handsome, long chamber, lighted by\r\nskylights from the roof, and is amply large enough for the number to\r\nbe accommodated. The Speaker sits opposite to the chief entrance,\r\nhis desk being fixed against the opposite wall. He is thus brought\r\nnearer to the body of the men before him than is the case with our\r\nSpeaker. He sits at a marble table, and the clerks below him are also\r\naccommodated with marble. Every representative has his own arm-chair,\r\nand his own desk before it. This may be done for a house consisting\r\nof about 240 members, but could hardly be contrived with us. These\r\ndesks are arranged in a semicircular form, or in a broad horseshoe,\r\nand every member as he sits faces the Speaker. A score or so of\r\nlittle boys are always running about the floor, ministering to the\r\nmembers' wishes, carrying up petitions to the chair, bringing water\r\nto long-winded legislators, delivering and carrying out letters, and\r\nrunning with general messages. They do not seem to interrupt the\r\ncourse of business, and yet they are the liveliest little boys I\r\never saw. When a member claps his hands, indicating a desire for\r\nattendance, three or four will jockey for the honour. On the whole,\r\nI thought the little boys had a good time of it.\r\n\r\nBut not so the Speaker. It seemed to me that the amount of work\r\nfalling upon the Speaker's shoulders was cruelly heavy. His voice was\r\nalways ringing in my ears, exactly as does the voice of the croupier\r\nat a gambling-table who goes on declaring and explaining the results\r\nof the game, and who generally does so in sharp, loud, ringing\r\ntones, from which all interest in the proceeding itself seems\r\nto be excluded. It was just so with the Speaker in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The debate was always full of interruptions; but\r\non every interruption the Speaker asked the gentleman interrupted\r\nwhether he would consent to be so treated. \"The gentleman from\r\nIndiana has the floor.\" \"The gentleman from Ohio wishes to ask the\r\ngentleman from Indiana a question.\" \"The gentleman from Indiana gives\r\npermission.\" \"The gentleman from Ohio!\"--these last words being a\r\nsummons to him of Ohio to get up and ask his question. \"The gentleman\r\nfrom Pennsylvania rises to order.\" \"The gentleman from Pennsylvania\r\nis in order.\" And then the House seems always to be voting, and the\r\nSpeaker is always putting the question. \"The gentlemen who agree to\r\nthe amendment will say, Ay.\" Not a sound is heard. \"The gentlemen who\r\noppose the amendment will say, No.\" Again not a sound. \"The Ayes have\r\nit,\" says the Speaker, and then he goes on again. All this he does\r\nwith amazing rapidity, and is always at it with the same hard, quick,\r\nringing, uninterested voice. The gentleman whom I saw in the chair\r\nwas very clever, and quite up to the task. But as for dignity--!\r\nPerhaps it might be found that any great accession of dignity would\r\nimpede the celerity of the work to be done, and that a closer copy of\r\nthe British model might not on the whole increase the efficiency of\r\nthe American machine.\r\n\r\nWhen any matter of real interest occasioned a vote, the ayes and noes\r\nwould be given aloud; and then, if there were a doubt arising from\r\nthe volume of sound, the Speaker would declare that the \"ayes\" or the\r\n\"noes\" would seem to have it! And upon this a poll would be demanded.\r\nIn such cases the Speaker calls on two members, who come forth\r\nand stand fronting each other before the chair, making a gangway.\r\nThrough this the ayes walk like sheep, the tellers giving them an\r\naccelerating poke when they fail to go on with rapidity. Thus they\r\nare counted, and the noes are counted in the same way. It seemed\r\nto me that it would be very possible in a dishonest legislator to\r\nvote twice on any subject of great interest; but it may perhaps be\r\nthe case that there are no dishonest legislators in the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nAccording to a list which I obtained, the present number of members\r\nis 173, and there are 63 vacancies occasioned by secession. New\r\nYork returns 33 members, Pennsylvania 25, Ohio 21, Virginia 13,\r\nMassachusetts and Indiana 11, Tennessee and Kentucky 10, South\r\nCarolina 6, and so on, till Delaware, Kansas, and Florida return only\r\n1 each. When the constitution was framed, Pennsylvania returned 8,\r\nand New York only 6; whereas Virginia returned 10, and South Carolina\r\n5. From which may be gathered the relative rate of increase in\r\npopulation of the Free-soil States and the Slave States. All these\r\nStates return two senators each to the other House, Kansas sending\r\nas many as New York. The work in the House begins at 12 noon, and is\r\nnot often carried on late into the evening. Indeed this, I think, is\r\nnever done till towards the end of the session.\r\n\r\nThe Senate House is in the opposite wing of the building, the\r\nposition of the one house answering exactly to that of the other.\r\nIt is somewhat smaller, but is, as a matter of course, much less\r\ncrowded. There are 34 States, and therefore 68 seats and 68 desks\r\nonly are required. These also are arranged in a horse-shoe form,\r\nand face the President; but there was a sad array of empty chairs\r\nwhen I was in Washington, nineteen or twenty seats being vacant in\r\nconsequence of secession. In this house the Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States acts as President, but has by no means so hard a job\r\nof work as his brother on the other side of the way. Mr. Hannibal\r\nHamlin, from Maine, now fills this chair. I was driven, while in\r\nWashington, to observe something amounting almost to a peculiarity in\r\nthe Christian names of the gentlemen who were then administrating the\r\nGovernment of the country. Mr. Abraham Lincoln was the President, Mr.\r\nHannibal Hamlin the Vice-President, Mr. Galusha Grow the Speaker of\r\nthe Representatives, Mr. Salmon Chase the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nMr. Caleb Smith the Attorney-General, Mr. Simon Cameron the Secretary\r\nat War, and Mr. Gideon Welles the Secretary of the Navy.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate House, as in the other house, there are very commodious\r\ngalleries for strangers, running round the entire chambers, and these\r\ngalleries are open to all the world. As with all such places in the\r\nStates, a large portion of them is appropriated to ladies. But I came\r\nat last to find that the word lady signified a female or a decently\r\ndressed man. Any arrangement for classes is in America impossible;\r\nthe seats intended for gentlemen must as a matter of course be open\r\nto all men; but by giving up to the rougher sex half the amount of\r\naccommodation nominally devoted to ladies, the desirable division\r\nis to a certain extent made. I generally found that I could obtain\r\nadmittance to the ladies' gallery if my coat were decent and I had\r\ngloves with me.\r\n\r\nAll the adjuncts of both these chambers are rich and in good keeping.\r\nThe staircases are of marble, and the outside passages and lobbies\r\nare noble in size and in every way convenient. One knows well the\r\ntrouble of getting into the House of Lords and House of Commons, and\r\nthe want of comfort which attends one there; and an Englishman cannot\r\nfail to make comparisons injurious to his own country. It would not,\r\nperhaps, be possible to welcome all the world in London as is done in\r\nWashington, but there can be no good reason why the space given to\r\nthe public with us should not equal that given in Washington. But, so\r\nfar are we from sheltering the public, that we have made our House of\r\nCommons so small, that it will not even hold all its own members.\r\n\r\nI had an opportunity of being present at one of their field-days\r\nin the Senate. Slidell and Mason had just then been sent from Fort\r\nWarren across to England in the Rinaldo. And here I may as well say\r\nwhat further there is for me to say about those two heroes. I was in\r\nBoston when they were taken, and all Boston was then full of them. I\r\nwas at Washington when they were surrendered, and at Washington for\r\na time their names were the only household words in vogue. To me it\r\nhad, from the first, been a matter of certainty that England would\r\ndemand the restitution of the men. I had never attempted to argue the\r\nmatter on the legal points, but I felt, as though by instinct, that\r\nit would be so. First of all there reached us, by telegram, from Cape\r\nRace, rumours of what the press in England was saying;--rumours of a\r\nmeeting in Liverpool, and rumours of the feeling in London. And then\r\nthe papers followed, and we got our private letters. It was some days\r\nbefore we knew what was actually the demand made by Lord Palmerston's\r\ncabinet; and during this time, through the five or six days which\r\nwere thus passed, it was clear to be seen that the American feeling\r\nwas undergoing a great change--or if not the feeling, at any rate the\r\npurpose. Men now talked of surrendering these Commissioners as though\r\nit were a line of conduct which Mr. Seward might find convenient; and\r\nthen men went further, and said that Mr. Seward would find any other\r\nline of conduct very inconvenient. The newspapers, one after another,\r\ncame round. That, under all the circumstances, the States Government\r\nbehaved well in the matter no one, I think, can deny; but the\r\nnewspapers, taken as a whole, were not very consistent and, I think,\r\nnot very dignified. They had declared with throats of brass that\r\nthese men should never be surrendered to perfidious Albion; but when\r\nit came to be understood that in all probability they would be so\r\nsurrendered, they veered round without an excuse, and spoke of their\r\nsurrender as of a thing of course. And thus, in the course of about a\r\nweek, the whole current of men's minds was turned. For myself, on my\r\nfirst arrival at Washington, I felt certain that there would be war,\r\nand was preparing myself for a quick return to England; but from the\r\nmoment that the first whisper of England's message reached us, and\r\nthat I began to hear how it was received and what men said about it,\r\nI knew that I need not hurry myself. One met a minister here, and a\r\nsenator there, and anon some wise diplomatic functionary. By none of\r\nthese grave men would any secret be divulged; none of them had any\r\nsecret ready for divulging. But it was to be read in every look of\r\nthe eye, in every touch of the hand, and in every fall of the foot of\r\neach of them, that Mason and Slidell would go to England.\r\n\r\nThen we had, in all the fulness of diplomatic language, Lord\r\nRussell's demand and Mr. Seward's answer. Lord Russell's demand was\r\nworded in language so mild, was so devoid of threat, was so free\r\nfrom anger, that at the first reading it seemed to ask for nothing.\r\nIt almost disappointed by its mildness. Mr. Seward's reply, on the\r\nother hand, by its length of argumentation, by a certain sharpness of\r\ndiction to which that gentleman is addicted in his State papers, and\r\nby a tone of satisfaction inherent through it all, seemed to demand\r\nmore than he conceded. But, in truth, Lord Russell had demanded\r\neverything, and the United States Government had conceded everything.\r\n\r\nI have said that the American Government behaved well in its mode\r\nof giving the men up, and I think that so much should be allowed to\r\nthem on a review of the whole affair. That Captain Wilkes had no\r\ninstructions to seize the two men is a known fact. He did seize them\r\nand brought them into Boston harbour, to the great delight of his\r\ncountrymen. This delight I could understand, though of course I did\r\nnot share it. One of these men had been the parent of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law; the other had been great in fostering the success of\r\nfilibustering. Both of them were hot secessionists, and undoubtedly\r\nrebels. No two men on the continent were more grievous by their\r\nantecedents and present characters to all northern feeling. It is\r\nimpossible to deny that they were rebels against the Government of\r\ntheir country. That Captain Wilkes was not on this account justified\r\nin seizing them is now a matter of history, but that the people of\r\nthe loyal States should rejoice in their seizure was a matter of\r\ncourse. Wilkes was received with an ovation, which as regarded him\r\nwas ill-judged and undeserved, but which in its spirit was natural.\r\nHad the President's Government at that moment disowned the deed\r\ndone by Wilkes, and declared its intention of giving up the men\r\nunasked, the clamour raised would have been very great, and perhaps\r\nsuccessful. We were told that the American lawyers were against\r\ntheir doing so; and indeed there was such a shout of triumph that no\r\nministry in a country so democratic could have ventured to go at once\r\nagainst it, and to do so without any external pressure.\r\n\r\nThen came the one ministerial blunder. The President put forth his\r\nmessage, in which he was cunningly silent on the Slidell and Mason\r\naffair; but to his message was appended, according to custom, the\r\nreport from Mr. Welles, the Secretary of the Navy. In this report\r\napproval was expressed of the deed done by Captain Wilkes. Captain\r\nWilkes was thus in all respects indemnified, and the blame, if any,\r\nwas taken from his shoulders and put on to the shoulders of that\r\nofficer who was responsible for the Secretary's letter. It is true\r\nthat in that letter the Secretary declared that in case of any future\r\nseizure the vessel seized must be taken into port, and so declared\r\nin animadverting on the fact that Captain Wilkes had not brought the\r\n\"Trent\" into port. But, nevertheless, Secretary Welles approved of\r\nCaptain Wilkes's conduct. He allowed the reasons to be good which\r\nWilkes had put forward for leaving the ship, and in all respects\r\nindemnified the captain. Then the responsibility shifted itself to\r\nSecretary Welles; but I think it must be clear that the President, in\r\nsending forward that report, took that responsibility upon himself.\r\nThat he is not bound to send forward the reports of his Secretaries\r\nas he receives them;--that he can disapprove them and require\r\nalteration, was proved at the very time by the fact that he had in\r\nthis way condemned Secretary Cameron's report, and caused a portion\r\nof it to be omitted. Secretary Cameron had unfortunately allowed his\r\nentire report to be printed, and it appeared in a New York paper.\r\nIt contained a recommendation with reference to the slave question\r\nmost offensive to a part of the Cabinet, and to the majority of Mr.\r\nLincoln's party. This, by order of the President, was omitted in the\r\nofficial way. It was certainly a pity that Mr. Welles's paragraph\r\nrespecting the \"Trent\" was not omitted also. The President was dumb\r\non the matter, and that being so the Secretary should have been dumb\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nBut when the demand was made the States Government yielded at once,\r\nand yielded without bluster. I cannot say I much admired Mr. Seward's\r\nlong letter. It was full of smart special pleading, and savoured\r\nstrongly, as Mr. Seward's productions always do, of the personal\r\nauthor. Mr. Seward was making an effort to place a great State paper\r\non record, but the _ars celare artem_ was altogether wanting; and,\r\nif I am not mistaken, he was without the art itself. I think he left\r\nthe matter very much where he found it. The men however were to be\r\nsurrendered, and the good policy consisted in this,--that no delay\r\nwas sought, no diplomatic ambiguities were put into request. It was\r\nthe opinion of very many that some two or three months might be\r\ngained by correspondence, and that at the end of that time things\r\nmight stand on a different footing. If during that time the North\r\nshould gain any great success over the South, the States might be in\r\na position to disregard England's threats. No such game was played.\r\nThe illegality of the arrest was at once acknowledged, and the\r\nmen were given up,--with a tranquillity that certainly appeared\r\nmarvellous after all that had so lately occurred.\r\n\r\nThen came Mr. Sumner's field day. Mr. Charles Sumner is a senator\r\nfrom Massachusetts, known as a very hot abolitionist and as having\r\nbeen the victim of an attack made upon him in the Senate House by\r\nSenator Brookes. He was also at the time of which I am writing\r\nChairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which position is\r\nas near akin to that of a British minister in Parliament as can\r\nbe attained under the existing constitution of the States. It is\r\nnot similar, because such chairman is by no means bound to the\r\nGovernment; but he has ministerial relations, and is supposed to be\r\nspecially conversant with all questions relating to foreign affairs.\r\nIt was understood that Mr. Sumner did not intend to find fault either\r\nwith England or with the Government of his own country as to its\r\nmanagement of this matter; or that, at least, such fault-finding was\r\nnot his special object, but that he was desirous to put forth views\r\nwhich might lead to a final settlement of all difficulties with\r\nreference to the right of international search.\r\n\r\nOn such an occasion, a speaker gives himself very little chance of\r\nmaking a favourable impression on his immediate hearers if he reads\r\nhis speech from a written manuscript. Mr. Sumner did so on this\r\noccasion, and I must confess that I was not edified. It seemed to me\r\nthat he merely repeated, at greater length, the arguments which I had\r\nheard fifty times during the last thirty or forty days. I am told\r\nthat the discourse is considered to be logical, and that it \"reads\"\r\nwell. As regards the gist of it, or that result which Mr. Sumner\r\nthinks to be desirable, I fully agree with him, as I think will all\r\nthe civilized world before many years have passed. If international\r\nlaw be what the lawyers say it is, international law must be altered\r\nto suit the requirements of modern civilization. By those laws, as\r\nthey are construed, everything is to be done for two nations at war\r\nwith each other; but nothing is to be done for all the nations of the\r\nworld that can manage to maintain the peace. The belligerents are to\r\nbe treated with every delicacy, as we treat our heinous criminals;\r\nbut the poor neutrals are to be handled with unjust rigour, as we\r\nhandle our unfortunate witnesses in order that the murderer may, if\r\npossible, be allowed to escape. Two men living in the same street\r\nchoose to pelt each other across the way with brickbats, and the\r\nother inhabitants are denied the privileges of the footpath lest they\r\nshould interfere with the due prosecution of the quarrel! It is, I\r\nsuppose, the truth, that we English have insisted on this right of\r\nsearch with more pertinacity than any other nation. Now in this case\r\nof Slidell and Mason we have felt ourselves aggrieved, and have\r\nresisted. Luckily for us there was no doubt of the illegality of the\r\nmode of seizure in this instance; but who will say that if Captain\r\nWilkes had taken the \"Trent\" into the harbour of New York, in order\r\nthat the matter might have been adjudged there, England would have\r\nbeen satisfied? Our grievance was, that our mail-packet was stopped\r\non the seas while doing its ordinary beneficent work. And our resolve\r\nis, that our mail-packets shall not be so stopped with impunity.\r\nAs we were high-handed in old days in insisting on this right of\r\nsearch, and as we are high-handed now in resisting a right of search,\r\nit certainly behoves us to see that we be just in our modes of\r\nproceeding. Would Captain Wilkes have been right according to the\r\nexisting law if he had carried the \"Trent\" away to New York? If so,\r\nwe ought not to be content with having escaped from such a trouble\r\nmerely through a mistake on his part. Lord Russell says that the\r\n\"Trent's\" voyage was an innocent voyage. That is the fact that should\r\nbe established;--not only that the voyage was, in truth, innocent,\r\nbut that it should not be made out to be guilty by any international\r\nlaw. Of its real innocency all thinking men must feel themselves\r\nassured. But it is not only of the seizure that we complain, but of\r\nthe search also. An honest man is not to be handled by a policeman\r\nwhile on his daily work, lest by chance a stolen watch should be\r\nin his pocket. If international law did give such power to all\r\nbelligerents, international law must give it no longer. In the\r\nbeginning of these matters, as I take it, the object was when two\r\npowerful nations were at war to allow the smaller fry of nations to\r\nenjoy peace and quiet, and to avoid if possible the general scuffle.\r\nThence arose the position of a neutral. But it was clearly not fair\r\nthat any such nation, having proclaimed its neutrality, should, after\r\nthat, fetch and carry for either of the combatants to the prejudice\r\nof the other. Hence came the right of search, in order that unjust\r\nfalsehood might be prevented. But the seas were not then bridged with\r\nships as they are now bridged, and the laws as written were, perhaps,\r\nthen practical and capable of execution. Now they are impracticable\r\nand not capable of execution. It will not, however, do for us to\r\nignore them if they exist; and therefore they should be changed. It\r\nis, I think, manifest that our own pretensions as to the right of\r\nsearch must be modified after this. And now I trust I may finish my\r\nbook without again naming Messrs. Slidell and Mason.\r\n\r\nThe working of the Senate bears little or no analogy to that of our\r\nHouse of Lords. In the first place, the senator's tenure there is not\r\nhereditary, nor is it for life. They are elected, and sit for six\r\nyears. Their election is not made by the people of their States, but\r\nby the State legislature. The two Houses, for instance, of the State\r\nof Massachusetts meet together and elect by their joint vote to the\r\nvacant seat for their State. It is so arranged that an entirely new\r\nsenate is not elected every sixth year. Instead of this a third of\r\nthe number is elected every second year. It is a common thing for\r\nsenators to be re-elected, and thus to remain in the House for twelve\r\nand eighteen years. In our Parliament the House of Commons has\r\ngreater political strength and wider political action than the House\r\nof Lords; but in Congress the Senate counts for more than the House\r\nof Representatives in general opinion. Money bills must originate in\r\nthe House of Representatives, but that is, I think, the only special\r\nprivilege attaching to the public purse which the lower House enjoys\r\nover the upper. Amendments to such bills can be moved in the Senate;\r\nand all such bills must pass the Senate before they become law. I am\r\ninclined to think that individual members of the Senate work harder\r\nthan individual representatives. More is expected of them, and any\r\nprolonged absence from duty would be more remarked in the Senate than\r\nin the other House. In our Parliament this is reversed. The payment\r\nmade to members of the Senate is 3000 dollars, or £600, per annum,\r\nand to a representative, £500 per annum. To this is added certain\r\nmileage allowance for travelling backwards and forwards, between\r\ntheir own State and the Capitol. A senator, therefore, from\r\nCalifornia or Oregon has not altogether a bad place; but the halcyon\r\ndays of mileage allowances are, I believe, soon to be brought to an\r\nend. It is quite within rule that the senator of to-day should be\r\nthe representative of to-morrow. Mr. Crittenden, who was senator\r\nfrom Kentucky, is now a member of the Lower House from an electoral\r\ndistrict in that State. John Quincy Adams went into the House of\r\nRepresentatives after he had been President of the United States.\r\n\r\nDivisions in the Senate do not take place as in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The ayes and noes are called for in the same way;\r\nbut if a poll be demanded, the clerk of the House calls out the names\r\nof the different senators, and makes out lists of the votes according\r\nto the separate answers given by the members. The mode is certainly\r\nmore dignified than that pursued in the other House, where during the\r\nceremony of voting the members look very much like sheep being passed\r\ninto their pens.\r\n\r\nI heard two or three debates in the House of Representatives, and\r\nthat one especially in which, as I have said before, a chapter was\r\nread out of the book of Joshua. The manner in which the Creator's\r\nname and the authority of His Word was bandied about the house on\r\nthat occasion, did not strike me favourably. The question originally\r\nunder debate was the relative power of the civil and military\r\nauthority. Congress had desired to declare its ascendancy over\r\nmilitary matters; but the army and the Executive generally had\r\ndemurred to this,--not with an absolute denial of the rights of\r\nCongress, but with those civil and almost silent generalities with\r\nwhich a really existing Power so well knows how to treat a nominal\r\nPower. The ascendant wife seldom tells her husband in so many words\r\nthat his opinion in the house is to go for nothing; she merely\r\nresolves that such shall be the case, and acts accordingly. An\r\nobserver could not but perceive that in those days Congress was\r\ntaking upon itself the part, not exactly of an obedient husband, but\r\nof a husband vainly attempting to assert his supremacy. \"I have got\r\nto learn,\" said one gentleman after another, rising indignantly on\r\nthe floor, \"that the military authority of our generals is above that\r\nof this House.\" And then one gentleman relieved the difficulty of the\r\nposition by branching off into an eloquent discourse against slavery,\r\nand by causing a chapter to be read out of the book of Joshua.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion the gentleman's diversion seemed to have the effect\r\nof relieving the House altogether from the embarrassment of the\r\noriginal question; but it was becoming manifest, day by day, that\r\nCongress was losing its ground, and that the army was becoming\r\nindifferent to its thunders:--that the army was doing so, and\r\nalso that ministers were doing so. In the States, the President\r\nand his ministers are not in fact subject to any parliamentary\r\nresponsibility. The President may be impeached, but the member of\r\nan opposition does not always wish to have recourse to such an\r\nextreme measure as impeachment. The ministers are not in the houses,\r\nand cannot therefore personally answer questions. Different large\r\nsubjects, such as Foreign affairs, Financial affairs, and Army\r\nmatters, are referred to Standing Committees in both houses; and\r\nthese Committees have relations with the ministers. But they have no\r\nconstitutional power over the ministers; nor have they the much more\r\nvaluable privilege of badgering a minister hither and thither by\r\n_vivâ voce_ questions on every point of his administration. The\r\nminister sits safe in his office--safe there for the term of the\r\nexisting Presidency if he can keep well with the President; and\r\ntherefore, even under ordinary circumstances, does not care much for\r\nthe printed or written messages of Congress. But under circumstances\r\nso little ordinary as those of 1861-62, while Washington was\r\nsurrounded by hundreds of thousands of soldiers, Congress was\r\nabsolutely impotent. Mr. Seward could snap his fingers at Congress,\r\nand he did so. He could not snap his fingers at the army; but then he\r\ncould go with the army,--could keep the army on his side by remaining\r\non the same side with the army; and this, as it seemed, he resolved\r\nto do. It must be understood that Mr. Seward was not Prime Minister.\r\nThe President of the United States has no Prime Minister,--or\r\nhitherto has had none. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has usually\r\nstood highest in the Cabinet, and Mr. Seward, as holding that\r\nposition, was not inclined to lessen its authority. He was gradually\r\nassuming for that position the prerogatives of a Premier, and men\r\nwere beginning to talk of Mr. Seward's ministry. It may easily be\r\nunderstood that at such a time the powers of Congress would be\r\nundefined, and that ambitious members of Congress would rise and\r\nassert on the floor, with that peculiar voice of indignation so\r\ncommon in parliamentary debate, \"that they had got to learn,\" &c.,\r\n&c., &c. It seemed to me that the lesson which they had yet to learn\r\nwas then in the process of being taught to them. They were anxious\r\nto be told all about the mischance at Ball's Bluff, but nobody would\r\ntell them anything about it. They wanted to know something of that\r\nblockade on the Potomac; but such knowledge was not good for them.\r\n\"Pack them up in boxes, and send them home,\" one military gentleman\r\nsaid to me. And I began to think that something of the kind would be\r\ndone, if they made themselves troublesome. I quote here the manner in\r\nwhich their questions, respecting the affair at Ball's Bluff, were\r\nanswered by the Secretary of War. \"The Speaker laid before the House\r\na letter from the Secretary at War, in which he says that he has the\r\nhonour to acknowledge the receipt of the resolution adopted on the\r\n6th instant, to the effect that the answer of the department to the\r\nresolution passed on the second day of the session, is not responsive\r\nand satisfactory to the House, and requesting a further answer. The\r\nSecretary has now to state that measures have been taken to ascertain\r\nwho is responsible for the disastrous movement at Ball's Bluff, but\r\nthat it is not compatible with the public interest to make known\r\nthose measures at the present time.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth the days are evil for any Congress of debaters, when a great\r\narmy is in camp on every side of them. The people had called for the\r\narmy, and there it was. It was of younger birth than Congress, and\r\nhad thrown its elder brother considerably out of favour, as has been\r\ndone before by many a new-born baby. If Congress could amuse itself\r\nwith a few set speeches, and a field-day or two, such as those\r\nafforded by Mr. Sumner, it might all be very well,--provided that\r\nsuch speeches did not attack the army. Over and beyond this, let\r\nthem vote the supplies and have done with it. Was it probable that\r\nGeneral Maclellan should have time to answer questions about Ball's\r\nBluff,--and he with such a job of work on his hands? Congress could\r\nof course vote what committees of military inquiry it might please,\r\nand might ask questions without end; but we all know to what such\r\nquestions lead, when the questioner has no power to force an answer\r\nby a penalty. If it might be possible to maintain the semblance of\r\nrespect for Congress, without too much embarrassment to military\r\nsecretaries, such semblance should be maintained; but if Congress\r\nchose to make itself really disagreeable, then no semblance could be\r\nkept up any longer. That, as far as I could judge, was the position\r\nof Congress in the early months of 1862; and that, under existing\r\ncircumstances, was perhaps the only possible position that it could\r\nfill.\r\n\r\nAll this to me was very melancholy. The streets of Washington were\r\nalways full of soldiers. Mounted sentries stood at the corners of all\r\nthe streets with drawn sabres,--shivering in the cold and besmeared\r\nwith mud. A military law came out that civilians might not ride\r\nquickly through the street. Military riders galloped over one at\r\nevery turn, splashing about through the mud, and reminding one not\r\nunfrequently of John Gilpin. Why they always went so fast, destroying\r\ntheir horses' feet on the rough stones, I could never learn. But I,\r\nas a civilian, given, as Englishmen are, to trotting, and furnished\r\nfor the time with a nimble trotter, found myself harried from time\r\nto time by muddy men with sabres, who would dash after me, rattling\r\ntheir trappings, and bid me go at a slower pace. There is a building\r\nin Washington, built by private munificence and devoted, according to\r\nan inscription which it bears, \"To the Arts.\" It has been turned into\r\nan army clothing establishment. The streets of Washington, night and\r\nday, were thronged with army waggons. All through the city military\r\nhuts and military tents were to be seen, pitched out among the mud\r\nand in the desert places. Then there was the chosen locality of the\r\nteamsters and their mules and horses--a wonderful world in itself;\r\nand all within the city! Here horses and mules lived,--or died,--_sub\r\ndio_, with no slightest apology for a stable over them, eating their\r\nprovender from off the waggons to which they were fastened. Here,\r\nthere, and everywhere large houses were occupied as the head-quarters\r\nof some officer, or the bureau of some military official. At\r\nWashington and round Washington the army was everything. While this\r\nwas so, is it to be conceived that Congress should ask questions\r\nabout military matters with success?\r\n\r\nAll this, as I say, filled me with sorrow. I hate military\r\nbelongings, and am disgusted at seeing the great affairs of a nation\r\nput out of their regular course. Congress to me is respectable.\r\nParliamentary debates, be they ever so prosy,--as with us, or even\r\nso rowdy, as sometimes they have been with our cousins across the\r\nwater,--engage my sympathies. I bow inwardly before a Speaker's\r\nchair, and look upon the elected representatives of any nation as the\r\nchoice men of the age. Those muddy, clattering dragoons, sitting at\r\nthe corners of the streets with dirty woollen comforters round their\r\nears, were to me hideous in the extreme. But there at Washington, at\r\nthe period of which I am writing, I was forced to acknowledge that\r\nCongress was at a discount, and that the rough-shod generals were the\r\nmen of the day. \"Pack them up and send them in boxes to their several\r\nStates.\" It would come to that, I thought, or to something like\r\nthat unless Congress would consent to be submissive. \"I have yet to\r\nlearn--!\" said indignant members, stamping with their feet on the\r\nfloor of the house. One would have said that by that time the lesson\r\nmight almost have been understood.\r\n\r\nUp to the period of this civil war Congress has certainly worked well\r\nfor the United States. It might be easy to pick holes in it;--to show\r\nthat some members have been corrupt, others quarrelsome, and others\r\nagain impracticable. But when we look at the circumstances under\r\nwhich it has been from year to year elected,--when we remember\r\nthe position of the newly-populated States from which the members\r\nhave been sent, and the absence throughout the country of that old\r\ntraditionary class of Parliament men on whom we depend in England;\r\nwhen we think how recent has been the elevation in life of the\r\nmajority of those who are and must be elected,--it is impossible\r\nto deny them praise for intellect, patriotism, good sense, and\r\ndiligence. They began but sixty years ago, and for sixty years\r\nCongress has fully answered the purpose for which it was established.\r\nWith no antecedents of grandeur, the nation, with its Congress, has\r\nmade itself one of the five great nations of the world. And what\r\nliving English politician will say even now, with all its troubles\r\nthick upon it, that it is the smallest of the five? When I think of\r\nthis, and remember the position in Europe which an American has been\r\nable to claim for himself, I cannot but acknowledge that Congress on\r\nthe whole has been conducted with prudence, wisdom, and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe question now to be asked is this,--Have the powers of Congress\r\nbeen sufficient, or are they sufficient, for the continued\r\nmaintenance of free government in the States under the constitution?\r\nI think that the powers given by the existing constitution to\r\nCongress can no longer be held to be sufficient; and that if the\r\nUnion be maintained at all, it must be done by a closer assimilation\r\nof its congressional system to that of our Parliament. But to\r\nthat matter I must allude again, when speaking of the existing\r\nconstitution of the States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seen various essays purporting to describe the causes of this\r\ncivil war between the North and South; but they have generally been\r\nwritten with the view of vindicating either one side or the other,\r\nand have spoken rather of causes which should, according to the ideas\r\nof their writers, have produced peace, than of those which did, in\r\nthe course of events, actually produce war. This has been essentially\r\nthe case with Mr. Everett, who in his lecture at New York, on the 4th\r\nof July, 1860, recapitulated all the good things which the North has\r\ndone for the South, and who proved--if he has proved anything--that\r\nthe South should have cherished the North instead of hating it. And\r\nthis was very much the case also with Mr. Motley in his letter to\r\nthe \"London Times.\" That letter is good in its way, as is everything\r\nthat comes from Mr. Motley, but it does not tell us why the war has\r\nexisted. Why is it that eight millions of people have desired to\r\nseparate themselves from a rich and mighty empire,--from an empire\r\nwhich was apparently on its road to unprecedented success, and which\r\nhad already achieved wealth, consideration, power, and internal\r\nwell-being?\r\n\r\nOne would be led to imagine from the essays of Mr. Everett and of Mr.\r\nMotley, that slavery has had little or nothing to do with it. I must\r\nacknowledge it to be my opinion that slavery in its various bearings\r\nhas been the single and necessary cause of the war;--that slavery\r\nbeing there in the South, this war was only to be avoided by a\r\nvoluntary division,--secession voluntary both on the part of North\r\nand South;--that in the event of such voluntary secession being not\r\nasked for, or if asked for not conceded, revolution and civil war\r\nbecame necessary,--were not to be avoided by any wisdom or care on\r\nthe part of the North.\r\n\r\nThe arguments used by both the gentlemen I have named prove very\r\nclearly that South Carolina and her sister States had no right to\r\nsecede under the constitution; that is to say, that it was not open\r\nto them peaceably to take their departure, and to refuse further\r\nallegiance to the President and Congress without a breach of the\r\nlaws by which they were bound. For a certain term of years, namely,\r\nfrom 1781 to 1787, the different States endeavoured to make their\r\nway in the world, simply leagued together by certain articles\r\nof confederation. It was declared that each State retained its\r\nsovereignty, freedom, and independence; and that the said States then\r\nentered severally into a firm league of friendship with each other\r\nfor their common defence. There was no President, no Congress taking\r\nthe place of our Parliament, but simply a congress of delegates\r\nor ambassadors, two or three from each State, who were to act in\r\naccordance with the policy of their own individual States. It is\r\nwell that this should be thoroughly understood, not as bearing\r\non the question of the present war, but as showing that a loose\r\nconfederation, not subversive of the separate independence of the\r\nStates, and capable of being partially dissolved at the will of each\r\nseparate State, was tried, and was found to fail. South Carolina took\r\nupon herself to act as she might have acted had that confederation\r\nremained in force; but that confederation was an acknowledged\r\nfailure. National greatness could not be achieved under it, and\r\nindividual enterprise could not succeed under it. Then in lieu of\r\nthat, by the united consent of the thirteen States the present\r\nconstitution was drawn up and sanctioned, and to that every State\r\nbound itself in allegiance. In that constitution no power of\r\nsecession is either named or presumed to exist. The individual\r\nsovereignty of the States had, in the first instance, been thought\r\ndesirable. The young republicans hankered after the separate power\r\nand separate name which each might then have achieved; but that dream\r\nhad been found vain,--and therefore the States, at the cost of some\r\nfond wishes, agreed to seek together for national power, rather than\r\nrun the risks entailed upon separate existence. I append to this\r\nvolume the articles of confederation and the constitution of the\r\nUnited States, as they who desire to look into this matter may be\r\nanxious to examine them without reference to other volumes. The\r\nlatter alone is clear enough on the subject, but is strengthened by\r\nthe former in proving that under the latter no State could possess\r\nthe legal power of seceding.\r\n\r\nBut they who created the constitution, who framed the clauses, and\r\ngave to this terribly important work what wisdom they possessed, did\r\nnot presume to think that it could be final. The mode of altering the\r\nconstitution is arranged in the constitution. Such alterations must\r\nbe proposed either by two-thirds of both the houses of the general\r\nCongress, or by the legislatures of two-thirds of the States;\r\nand must, when so proposed, be ratified by the legislatures of\r\nthree-fourths of the States.--(Article V.) There can, I think, be no\r\ndoubt that any alteration so carried would be valid; even though that\r\nalteration should go to the extent of excluding one or any number\r\nof States from the Union. Any division so made would be made in\r\naccordance with the constitution.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina and the southern States no doubt felt that they would\r\nnot succeed in obtaining secession in this way, and therefore they\r\nsought to obtain the separation which they wanted by revolution,--by\r\nrevolution and rebellion, as Naples has lately succeeded in her\r\nattempt to change her political status; as Hungary is looking to do;\r\nas Poland has been seeking to do any time since her subjection; as\r\nthe revolted colonies of Great Britain succeeded in doing in 1776,\r\nwhereby they created this great nation which is now undergoing all\r\nthe sorrows of a civil war. The name of secession claimed by the\r\nSouth for this movement is a misnomer. If any part of a nationality\r\nor empire ever rebelled against the government established on behalf\r\nof the whole, South Carolina so rebelled when, on the 20th November,\r\n1860, she put forth her ordinance of so-called secession; and the\r\nother southern States joined in that rebellion when they followed\r\nher lead. As to that fact, there cannot, I think, much longer be any\r\ndoubt in any mind. I insist on this especially, repeating perhaps\r\nunnecessarily, opinions expressed in my first volume, because I still\r\nsee it stated by English writers that the secession ordinance of\r\nSouth Carolina should have been accepted as a political act by the\r\ngovernment of the United States. It seems to me that no government\r\ncan in this way accept an act of rebellion without declaring its own\r\nfunctions to be beyond its own power.\r\n\r\nBut what if such rebellion be justifiable, or even reasonable? what\r\nif the rebels have cause for their rebellion? For no one will now\r\ndeny that rebellion may be both reasonable and justifiable; or that\r\nevery subject in the land may be bound in duty to rebel. In such case\r\nthe government will be held to have brought about its own punishment\r\nby its own fault. But as government is a wide affair, spreading\r\nitself gradually, and growing in virtue or in vice from small\r\nbeginnings,--from seeds slow to produce their fruits,--it is\r\nmuch easier to discern the incidence of the punishment than the\r\nperpetration of the fault. Government goes astray by degrees, or sins\r\nby the absence of that wisdom which should teach rulers how to make\r\nprogress, as progress is made by those whom they rule. The fault may\r\nbe absolutely negative and have spread itself over centuries; may\r\nbe, and generally has been, attributable to dull good men;--but not\r\nthe less does the punishment come at a blow. The rebellion exists\r\nand cannot be put down,--will put down all that opposes it; but the\r\ngovernment is not the less bound to make its fight. That is the\r\npunishment that comes on governing men or on a governing people, that\r\ngovern not well or not wisely.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Motley says in the paper to which I have alluded, \"No man, on\r\neither side of the Atlantic, with Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins,\r\nwill dispute the right of a people, or of any portion of a people,\r\nto rise against oppression, to demand redress of grievances, and in\r\ncase of denial of justice to take up arms to vindicate the sacred\r\nprinciple of liberty. Few Englishmen or Americans will deny that the\r\nsource of government is the consent of the governed, or that every\r\nnation has the right to govern itself according to its will. When\r\nthe silent consent is changed to fierce remonstrance, revolution is\r\nimpending. The right of revolution is indisputable. It is written on\r\nthe whole record of our race. British and American history is made\r\nup of rebellion and revolution. Hampden, Pym, and Oliver Cromwell;\r\nWashington, Adams, and Jefferson, all were rebels.\" Then comes the\r\nquestion whether South Carolina and the Gulf States had so suffered\r\nas to make rebellion on their behalf justifiable or reasonable; or if\r\nnot, what cause had been strong enough to produce in them so strong\r\na desire for secession,--a desire which has existed for fully half\r\nthe term through which the United States has existed as a nation,\r\nand so firm a resolve to rush into rebellion with the object of\r\naccomplishing that which they deemed not to be accomplished on other\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nIt must, I think, be conceded that the Gulf States have not suffered\r\nat all by their connection with the northern States; that in lieu\r\nof any such suffering, they owe all their national greatness to the\r\nnorthern States; that they have been lifted up by the commercial\r\nenergy of the Atlantic States and by the agricultural prosperity of\r\nthe western States, to a degree of national consideration and respect\r\nthrough the world at large, which never could have belonged to them\r\nstanding alone. I will not trouble my readers with statistics which\r\nfew would care to follow, but let any man of ordinary every-day\r\nknowledge turn over in his own mind his present existing ideas of\r\nthe wealth and commerce of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago,\r\nPittsburg, and Cincinnati, and compare them with his ideas as to New\r\nOrleans, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, Richmond, and Memphis. I do\r\nnot name such towns as Baltimore and St. Louis, which stand in slave\r\nStates, but which have raised themselves to prosperity by northern\r\nhabits. If this be not sufficient, let him refer to population tables\r\nand tables of shipping and tonnage. And of those southern towns\r\nwhich I have named the commercial wealth is of northern creation.\r\nThe success of New Orleans as a city can be no more attributed to\r\nLouisianians than can that of the Havana to the men of Cuba, or of\r\nCalcutta to the natives of India. It has been a repetition of the old\r\nstory, told over and over again through every century since commerce\r\nhas flourished in the world; the tropics can produce,--but the men\r\nfrom the North shall sow and reap, and garner and enjoy. As the\r\nCreator's work has progressed, this privilege has extended itself to\r\nregions further removed and still further from southern influences.\r\nIf we look to Europe, we see that this has been so in Greece, Italy,\r\nSpain, France, and the Netherlands; in England and Scotland; in\r\nPrussia and in Russia; and the Western world shows us the same story.\r\nWhere is now the glory of the Antilles? where the riches of Mexico,\r\nand the power of Peru? They still produce sugar, guano, gold, cotton,\r\ncoffee, almost whatever we may ask them,--and will continue to do so\r\nwhile held to labour under sufficient restraint; but where are their\r\nmen, where are their books, where are their learning, their art,\r\ntheir enterprise? I say it with sad regret at the decadence of so\r\nvast a population; but I do say that the southern States of America\r\nhave not been able to keep pace with their northern brethren;--that\r\nthey have fallen behind in the race, and feeling that the struggle is\r\ntoo much for them, have therefore resolved to part.\r\n\r\nThe reasons put forward by the South for secession have been trifling\r\nalmost beyond conception. Northern tariffs have been the first,\r\nand perhaps foremost. Then there has been a plea that the national\r\nexchequer has paid certain bounties to New England fishermen,\r\nof which the South has paid its share,--getting no part of such\r\nbounty in return. There is also a complaint as to the navigation\r\nlaws,--meaning, I believe, that the laws of the States increase\r\nthe cost of coast traffic by forbidding foreign vessels to engage in\r\nthe trade, thereby increasing also the price of goods and confining\r\nthe benefit to the North, which carries on the coasting trade of\r\nthe country, and doing only injury to the South, which has none\r\nof it. Then last, but not least, comes that grievance as to the\r\nFugitive Slave Law. The law of the land as a whole,--the law of the\r\nnation,--requires the rendition from free States of all fugitive\r\nslaves. But the free States will not obey this law. They even pass\r\nState laws in opposition to it. \"Catch your own slaves,\" they say,\r\n\"and we will not hinder you; at any rate we will not hinder you\r\nofficially. Of non-official hindrance you must take your chance. But\r\nwe absolutely decline to employ our officers to catch your slaves.\"\r\nThat list comprises, as I take it, the amount of southern official\r\ngrievances. Southern people will tell you privately of others. They\r\nwill say that they cannot sleep happy in their beds, fearing lest\r\ninsurrection should be roused among their slaves. They will tell you\r\nof domestic comfort invaded by northern falsehood. They will explain\r\nto you how false has been Mrs. Beecher Stowe. Ladies will fill your\r\nears and your hearts too with tales of the daily efforts they make\r\nfor the comfort of their \"people,\" and of the ruin to those efforts\r\nwhich arises from the malice of the abolitionists. To all this you\r\nmake some answer with your tongue that is hardly true,--for in such\r\na matter courtesy forbids the plain truth. But your heart within\r\nanswers truly, \"Madam,--dear madam, your sorrow is great; but that\r\nsorrow is the necessary result of your position.\"\r\n\r\nAs to those official reasons, in what fewest words I can use I will\r\nendeavour to show that they come to nothing. The tariff--and a\r\nmonstrous tariff it then was--was the ground put forward by South\r\nCarolina for secession, when General Jackson was President, and Mr.\r\nCalhoun was the hero of the South. Calhoun bound himself and his\r\nState to take certain steps towards secession at a certain day if\r\nthat tariff were not abolished. The tariff was so absurd that Jackson\r\nand his Government were forced to abandon it,--would have abandoned\r\nit without any threat from Calhoun; but under that threat it was\r\nnecessary that Calhoun should be defied. General Jackson proposed\r\na compromise tariff, which was odious to Calhoun,--not on its own\r\nbehalf, for it yielded nearly all that was asked, but as being\r\nsubversive of his desire for secession. The President, however,\r\nnot only insisted on his compromise, but declared his purpose of\r\npreventing its passage into law unless Calhoun himself, as senator,\r\nwould vote for it. And he also declared his purpose, not, we may\r\npresume, officially, of hanging Calhoun if he took that step towards\r\nsecession which he had bound himself to take in the event of the\r\ntariff not being repealed. As a result of all this Calhoun voted for\r\nthe compromise, and secession for the time was beaten down. That was\r\nin 1832, and may be regarded as the commencement of the secession\r\nmovement. The tariff was then a convenient reason, a ground to be\r\nassigned with a colour of justice, because it was a tariff admitted\r\nto be bad. But the tariff has been modified again and again since\r\nthat; and the tariff existing when South Carolina seceded in 1860 had\r\nbeen carried by votes from South Carolina. The absurd Morrill tariff\r\ncould not have caused secession, for it was passed without a struggle\r\nin the collapse of Congress occasioned by secession.\r\n\r\nThe bounty to fishermen was given to create sailors, so that a\r\nmarine might be provided for the nation. I need hardly show that\r\nthe national benefit would accrue to the whole nation for whose\r\nprotection such sailors were needed. Such a system of bounties may\r\nbe bad, but if so it was bad for the whole nation. It did not affect\r\nSouth Carolina otherwise than it affected Illinois, Pennsylvania, or\r\neven New York.\r\n\r\nThe navigation laws may also have been bad. According to my thinking\r\nsuch protective laws are bad; but they created no special hardship\r\non the South. By any such a theory of complaint all sections of all\r\nnations have ground of complaint against any other section which\r\nreceives special protection under any law. The drinkers of beer in\r\nEngland should secede because they pay a tax, whereas the consumers\r\nof paper pay none. The navigation laws of the States are no doubt\r\ninjurious to the mercantile interests of the States. I at least have\r\nno doubt on the subject. But no one will think that secession is\r\njustified by the existence of a law of questionable expediency. Bad\r\nlaws will go by the board if properly handled by those whom they\r\npinch, as the navigation laws went by the board with us in England.\r\n\r\nAs to that Fugitive Slave Law, it should be explained that the\r\ngrievance has not arisen from the loss of slaves. I have heard it\r\nstated that South Carolina, up to the time of the secession, had\r\nnever lost a slave in this way--that is, by northern opposition to\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law; and that the total number of slaves escaping\r\nsuccessfully into the northern States, and there remaining through\r\nthe non-operation of this law, did not amount to five in the year.\r\nIt has not been a question of property but of feeling. It has been a\r\npolitical point, and the South has conceived--and probably conceived\r\ntruly--that this resolution on the part of northern States to defy\r\nthe law with reference to slaves, even though in itself it might\r\nnot be immediately injurious to southern property, was an insertion\r\nof the narrow end of the wedge. It was an action taken against\r\nslavery,--an action taken by men of the North against their\r\nfellow-countrymen in the South. Under such circumstances the sooner\r\nsuch countrymen should cease to be their fellows the better it would\r\nbe for them. That, I take it, was the argument of the South; or at\r\nany rate that was its feeling.\r\n\r\nI have said that the reasons given for secession have been trifling,\r\nand among them have so estimated this matter of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw. I mean to assert that the ground actually put forward is\r\ntrifling;--the loss, namely, of slaves to which the South has been\r\nsubjected. But the true reason pointed at in this--the conviction,\r\nnamely, that the North would not leave slavery alone, and would\r\nnot allow it to remain as a settled institution--was by no means\r\ntrifling. It has been this conviction on the part of the South, that\r\nthe North would not live in amity with slavery, would continue to\r\nfight it under this banner or under that, would still condemn it as\r\ndisgraceful to man and rebuke it as impious before God, which has\r\nproduced rebellion and civil war--and will ultimately produce that\r\ndivision for which the South is fighting, and against which the\r\nNorth is fighting; and which, when accomplished, will give the North\r\nnew wings, and will leave the South without political greatness or\r\ncommercial success.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances I cannot think that rebellion on the part\r\nof the South was justified by wrongs endured or made reasonable\r\nby the prospect of wrongs to be inflicted. It is disagreeable, that\r\nhaving to live with a wife who is always rebuking one for some\r\nspecial fault; but the outside world will not grant a divorce on that\r\naccount, especially if the outside world is well aware that the fault\r\nso rebuked is of daily occurrence. \"If you do not choose to be called\r\na drunkard by your wife,\" the outside world will say, \"it will be\r\nwell that you should cease to drink.\" Ah! but that habit of drinking\r\nwhen once acquired cannot easily be laid aside. The brain will not\r\nwork, the organs of the body will not perform their functions, the\r\nblood will not run. The drunkard must drink till he dies. All that\r\nmay be a good ground for divorce, the outside world will say; but\r\nthe plea should be put in by the sober wife, not by the intemperate\r\nhusband. But what if the husband takes himself off without any\r\ndivorce and takes with him also his wife's property, her earnings,\r\nthat on which he has lived and his children? It may be a good bargain\r\nstill for her, the outside world will say; but she, if she be a woman\r\nof spirit, will not willingly put up with such wrongs. The South\r\nhas been the husband drunk with slavery, and the North has been the\r\nill-used wife.\r\n\r\nRebellion, as I have said, is often justifiable, but it is, I think,\r\nnever justifiable on the part of a paid servant of that Government\r\nagainst which it is raised. We must at any rate feel that this is\r\ntrue of men in high places,--as regards those men to whom by reason\r\nof their offices it should specially belong to put down rebellion.\r\nHad Washington been the Governor of Virginia, had Cromwell been a\r\nminister of Charles, had Garibaldi held a marshal's baton under the\r\nEmperor of Austria or the King of Naples, those men would have been\r\ntraitors as well as rebels. Treason and rebellion may be made one\r\nunder the law, but the mind will always draw the distinction. I,\r\nif I rebel against the Crown, am not on that account necessarily a\r\ntraitor. A betrayal of trust is, I take it, necessary to treason.\r\nI am not aware that Jefferson Davis is a traitor; but that Buchanan\r\nwas a traitor admits, I think, of no doubt. Under him and with his\r\nconnivance, the rebellion was allowed to make its way. Under him and\r\nby his officers arms and ships, and men and money, were sent away\r\nfrom those points at which it was known that they would be needed\r\nif it were intended to put down the coming rebellion, and to those\r\npoints at which it was known that they would be needed if it were\r\nintended to foster the coming rebellion. But Mr. Buchanan had no\r\neager feeling in favour of secession. He was not of that stuff of\r\nwhich are made Davis and Toombs and Slidell. But treason was easier\r\nto him than loyalty. Remonstrance was made to him, pointing out the\r\nmisfortunes which his action, or want of action, would bring upon the\r\ncountry. \"Not in my time,\" he answered. \"It will not be in my time.\"\r\nSo that he might escape unscathed out of the fire, this chief ruler\r\nof a nation of thirty millions of men was content to allow treason\r\nand rebellion to work their way! I venture to say so much here as\r\nshowing how impossible it was that Mr. Lincoln's government, on its\r\ncoming into office, should have given to the South,--not what the\r\nSouth had asked, for the South had not asked,--but what the South had\r\ntaken; what the South had tried to filch. Had the South waited for\r\nsecession till Mr. Lincoln had been in his chair, I could understand\r\nthat England should sympathize with her. For myself I cannot agree to\r\nthat scuttling of the ship by the captain on the day which was to see\r\nthe transfer of his command to another officer.\r\n\r\nThe southern States were driven into rebellion by no wrongs inflicted\r\non them; but their desire for secession is not on that account matter\r\nfor astonishment. It would have been surprising had they not desired\r\nsecession. Secession of one kind, a very practical secession, had\r\nalready been forced upon them by circumstances. They had become\r\na separate people, dissevered from the North by habits, morals,\r\ninstitutions, pursuits, and every conceivable difference in their\r\nmodes of thought and action. They still spoke the same language, as\r\ndo Austria and Prussia; but beyond that tie of language they had\r\nno bond but that of a meagre political union in their Congress at\r\nWashington. Slavery, as it had been expelled from the North, and as\r\nit had come to be welcomed in the South, had raised such a wall of\r\ndifference, that true political union was out of the question. It\r\nwould be juster, perhaps, to say that those physical characteristics\r\nof the South which had induced this welcoming of slavery, and those\r\nother characteristics of the North which had induced its expulsion,\r\nwere the true causes of the difference. For years and years this\r\nhas been felt by both, and the fight has been going on. It has been\r\ncontinued for thirty years, and almost always to the detriment of\r\nthe South. In 1845 Florida and Texas were admitted into the Union as\r\nslave States. I think that no State had then been admitted, as a free\r\nState, since Michigan, in 1836. In 1846 Iowa was admitted as a free\r\nState, and from that day to this Wisconsin, California, Minnesota,\r\nOregon, and Kansas have been brought into the Union; all as free\r\nStates. The annexation of another slave State to the existing Union\r\nhad become, I imagine, impossible--unless such object were gained by\r\nthe admission of Texas. We all remember that fight about Kansas, and\r\nwhat sort of a fight it was! Kansas lies alongside of Missouri, a\r\nslave State, and is contiguous to no other State. If the free-soil\r\nparty could, in the days of Pierce and Buchanan, carry the day in\r\nKansas, it is not likely that they would be beaten on any new ground\r\nunder such a President as Lincoln. We have all heard in Europe how\r\nsouthern men have ruled in the White House, nearly from the days of\r\nWashington downwards; or if not southern men, northern men, such as\r\nPierce and Buchanan, with southern politics; and therefore we have\r\nbeen taught to think that the South has been politically the winning\r\nparty. They have, in truth, been the losing party as regards national\r\npower. But what they have so lost they have hitherto recovered by\r\npolitical address and individual statecraft. The leading men of the\r\nSouth have seen their position, and have gone to their work with the\r\nexercise of all their energies. They organized the Democrat party so\r\nas to include the leaders among the northern politicians. They never\r\nbegrudged to these assistants a full share of the good things of\r\nofficial life. They have been aided by the fanatical abolitionism of\r\nthe North by which the Republican party has been divided into two\r\nsections. It has been fashionable to be a Democrat, that is, to hold\r\nsouthern politics, and unfashionable to be a Republican, or to hold\r\nanti-southern politics. In that way the South has lived and struggled\r\non against the growing will of the population; but at last that will\r\nbecame too strong, and when Mr. Lincoln was elected, the South knew\r\nthat its day was over.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the South should have desired secession. It\r\nis not surprising that it should have prepared for it. Since the days\r\nof Mr. Calhoun its leaders have always understood its position with\r\na fair amount of political accuracy. Its only chance of political\r\nlife lay in prolonged ascendancy at Washington. The swelling\r\ncrowds of Germans, by whom the western States were being filled,\r\nenlisted themselves to a man in the ranks of abolition. What was\r\nthe acquisition of Texas against such hosts as these? An evil day\r\nwas coming on the southern politicians, and it behoved them to be\r\nprepared. As a separate nation,--a nation trusting to cotton, having\r\nin their hands, as they imagined, a monopoly of the staple of English\r\nmanufacture, with a tariff of their own, and those rabid curses on\r\nthe source of all their wealth no longer ringing in their ears, what\r\nmight they not do as a separate nation? But as a part of the Union,\r\nthey were too weak to hold their own if once their political finesse\r\nshould fail them. That day came upon them, not unexpected, in 1860,\r\nand therefore they cut the cable.\r\n\r\nAnd all this has come from slavery. It is hard enough, for how could\r\nthe South have escaped slavery? How, at least, could the South have\r\nescaped slavery any time during these last thirty years? And is it,\r\nmoreover, so certain that slavery is an unmitigated evil, opposed\r\nto God's will, and producing all the sorrows which have ever been\r\nproduced by tyranny and wrong? It is here, after all, that one comes\r\nto the difficult question. Here is the knot which the fingers of men\r\ncannot open, and which admits of no sudden cutting with the knife. I\r\nhave likened the slave-holding States to the drunken husband, and in\r\nso doing have pronounced judgment against them. As regards the state\r\nof the drunken man, his unfitness for partnership with any decent,\r\ndiligent, well-to-do wife, his ruined condition, and shattered\r\nprospects, the simile, I think, holds good. But I refrain from\r\nsaying, that as the fault was originally with the drunkard in that he\r\nbecame such, so also has the fault been with the slave States. At any\r\nrate I refrain from so saying here, on this page. That the position\r\nof a slave-owner is terribly prejudicial, not to the slave of whom I\r\ndo not here speak, but to the owner;--of so much at any rate I feel\r\nassured. That the position is therefore criminal and damnable, I am\r\nnot now disposed to take upon myself to assert.\r\n\r\nThe question of slavery in America cannot be handled fully and fairly\r\nby any one who is afraid to go back upon the subject, and take its\r\nwhole history since one man first claimed and exercised the right of\r\nforcing labour from another man. I certainly am afraid of any such\r\ntask; but I believe that there has been no period yet, since the\r\nworld's work began, when such a practice has not prevailed in a large\r\nportion, probably in the largest portion, of the world's work-fields.\r\nAs civilization has made its progress, it has been the duty and\r\ndelight, as it has also been the interest of the men at the top of\r\naffairs, not to lighten the work of the men below, but so to teach\r\nthem that they should recognize the necessity of working without\r\ncoercion. Emancipation of serfs and thralls, of bondsmen and slaves,\r\nhas always meant this,--that men having been so taught, should then\r\nwork without coercion. As men become educated and aware of the nature\r\nof the tenure on which they hold their life, they learn the fact that\r\nwork is a necessity for them, and that it is better to work without\r\ncoercion than with it. When men have learned this they are fit for\r\nemancipation, but they are hardly fit till they have learned so much.\r\n\r\nIn talking or writing of slaves, we always now think of the negro\r\nslave. Of us Englishmen it must at any rate be acknowledged that we\r\nhave done what in us lay to induce him to recognize this necessity\r\nfor labour. At any rate we acted on the presumption that he would do\r\nso, and gave him his liberty throughout all our lands at a cost which\r\nhas never yet been reckoned up in pounds, shillings, and pence. The\r\ncost never can be reckoned up, nor can the gain which we achieved in\r\npurging ourselves from the degradation and demoralization of such\r\nemployment. We come into court with clean hands, having done all that\r\nlay with us to do to put down slavery both at home and abroad. But\r\nwhen we enfranchised the negroes, we did so with the intention, at\r\nleast, that they should work as free men. Their share of the bargain\r\nin that respect they have declined to keep, wherever starvation has\r\nnot been the result of such resolve on their part; and from the\r\ndate of our emancipation, seeing the position which the negroes now\r\nhold with us, the southern States of America have learned to regard\r\nslavery as a permanent institution, and have taught themselves to\r\nregard it as a blessing, and not as a curse.\r\n\r\nNegroes were first taken over to America because the white man\r\ncould not work under the tropical heats, and because the native\r\nIndian would not work. The latter people has been, or soon will be,\r\nexterminated,--polished off the face of creation, as the Americans\r\nsay,--which fate must, I should say, in the long run attend all\r\nnon-working people. As the soil of the world is required for\r\nincreasing population, the non-working people must go. And so the\r\nIndians have gone. The negroes under compulsion did work, and work\r\nwell; and under their hands vast regions of the western tropics\r\nbecame fertile gardens. The fact that they were carried up into\r\nnorthern regions which from their nature did not require such aid,\r\nthat slavery prevailed in New York and Massachusetts, does not\r\nmilitate against my argument. The exact limits of any great movement\r\nwill not be bounded by its purpose. The heated wax which you drop\r\non your letter spreads itself beyond the necessities of your seal.\r\nThat these negroes would not have come to the western world without\r\ncompulsion, or having come, would not have worked without compulsion,\r\nis, I imagine, acknowledged by all. That they have multiplied in the\r\nwestern world and have there become a race happier, at any rate in\r\nall the circumstances of their life, than their still untamed kinsmen\r\nin Africa, must also be acknowledged. Who, then, can dare to wish\r\nthat all that has been done by the negro immigration should have\r\nremained undone?\r\n\r\nThe name of slave is odious to me. If I know myself I would not own\r\na negro though he could sweat gold on my behoof. I glory in that\r\nbold leap in the dark which England took with regard to her own West\r\nIndian slaves. But I do not see the less clearly the difficulty of\r\nthat position in which the southern States have been placed; and I\r\nwill not call them wicked, impious, and abominable, because they now\r\nhold by slavery, as other nations have held by it at some period of\r\ntheir career. It is their misfortune that they must do so now,--now,\r\nwhen so large a portion of the world has thrown off the system,\r\nspurning as base and profitless all labour that is not free. It is\r\ntheir misfortune, for henceforth they must stand alone, with small\r\nrank among the nations, whereas their brethren of the North will\r\nstill \"flame in the forehead of the morning sky.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the present constitution of the United States was written,--the\r\nmerit of which must probably be given mainly to Madison and Hamilton,\r\nMadison finding the French democratic element, and Hamilton the\r\nEnglish conservative element,--this question of slavery was\r\ndoubtless a great trouble. The word itself is not mentioned in\r\nthe constitution. It speaks not of a slave, but of a \"person held\r\nto service or labour.\" It neither sanctions nor forbids slavery.\r\nIt assumes no power in the matter of slavery; and under it, at\r\nthe present moment, all Congress voting together, with the full\r\nconsent of the legislatures of thirty-three States, could not\r\nconstitutionally put down slavery in the remaining thirty-fourth\r\nState. In fact the constitution ignored the subject.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless Washington, and Jefferson from whom Madison received\r\nhis inspiration, were opposed to slavery. I do not know that\r\nWashington ever took much action in the matter, but his expressed\r\nopinion is on record. But Jefferson did so throughout his life.\r\nBefore the declaration of independence he endeavoured to make slavery\r\nillegal in Virginia. In this he failed, but long afterwards, when\r\nthe United States was a nation, he succeeded in carrying a law by\r\nwhich the further importation of slaves into any of the States was\r\nprohibited after a certain year--1820. When this law was passed, the\r\nframers of it considered that the gradual abolition of slavery would\r\nbe secured. Up to that period the negro population in the States had\r\nnot been self-maintained. As now in Cuba, the numbers had been kept\r\nup by new importations, and it was calculated that the race, when\r\nnot recruited from Africa, would die out. That this calculation was\r\nwrong we now know, and the breeding-grounds of Virginia have been the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAt that time there were no cotton-fields. Alabama and Mississippi\r\nwere outlying territories. Louisiana had been recently purchased, but\r\nwas not yet incorporated as a State. Florida still belonged to Spain,\r\nand was all but unpopulated. Of Texas no man had yet heard. Of the\r\nslave States, Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia were alone\r\nwedded to slavery. Then the matter might have been managed. But under\r\nthe constitution as it had been framed, and with the existing powers\r\nof the separate States, there was not even then open any way by which\r\nslavery could be abolished other than by the separate action of the\r\nStates; nor has there been any such way opened since. With slavery\r\nthese southern States have grown and become fertile. The planters\r\nhave thriven, and the cotton-fields have spread themselves. And then\r\ncame emancipation in the British islands. Under such circumstances\r\nand with such a lesson, could it be expected that the southern States\r\nshould learn to love abolition?\r\n\r\nIt is vain to say that slavery has not caused secession, and that\r\nslavery has not caused the war. That, and that only, has been the\r\nreal cause of this conflict, though other small collateral issues may\r\nnow be put forward to bear the blame. Those other issues have arisen\r\nfrom this question of slavery, and are incidental to it and a part of\r\nit. Massachusetts, as we all know, is democratic in its tendencies,\r\nbut South Carolina is essentially aristocratic. This difference\r\nhas come of slavery. A slave country, which has progressed far in\r\nslavery, must be aristocratic in its nature,--aristocratic and\r\npatriarchal. A large slave-owner from Georgia may call himself a\r\ndemocrat,--may think that he reveres republican institutions, and\r\nmay talk with American horror of the thrones of Europe; but he must\r\nin his heart be an aristocrat. We, in England, are apt to speak of\r\nrepublican institutions, and of universal suffrage which is perhaps\r\nthe chief of them, as belonging equally to all the States. In South\r\nCarolina there is not and has not been any such thing. The electors\r\nfor the President there are chosen not by the people, but by the\r\nlegislature; and the votes for the legislature are limited by a high\r\nproperty qualification. A high property qualification is required for\r\na member of the House of Representatives in South Carolina;--four\r\nhundred freehold acres of land and ten negroes is one qualification.\r\nFive hundred pounds clear of debt is another qualification;--for,\r\nwhere a sum of money is thus named, it is given in English money.\r\nRussia and England are not more unlike in their political and social\r\nfeelings than are the real slave States and the real free-soil\r\nStates. The gentlemen from one and from the other side of the line\r\nhave met together on neutral ground, and have discussed political\r\nmatters without flying frequently at each other's throats, while the\r\ngreat question on which they differed was allowed to slumber. But the\r\nawakening has been coming by degrees, and now the South had felt that\r\nit was come. Old John Brown, who did his best to create a servile\r\ninsurrection at Harper's Ferry, has been canonized through the North\r\nand West, to the amazement and horror of the South. The decision in\r\nthe \"Dred Scott\" case, given by the Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, has been received with shouts of\r\nexecration through the North and West. The southern gentry have been\r\nUncle-Tommed into madness. It is no light thing to be told daily\r\nby your fellow-citizens, by your fellow-representatives, by your\r\nfellow-senators, that you are guilty of the one damning sin that\r\ncannot be forgiven. All this they could partly moderate, partly\r\nrebuke, and partly bear as long as political power remained in their\r\nhands; but they have gradually felt that that was going, and were\r\nprepared to cut the rope and run as soon as it was gone.\r\n\r\nSuch, according to my ideas, have been the causes of the war. But I\r\ncannot defend the South. As long as they could be successful in their\r\nschemes for holding the political power of the nation, they were\r\nprepared to hold by the nation. Immediately those schemes failed,\r\nthey were prepared to throw the nation overboard. In this there\r\nhas undoubtedly been treachery as well as rebellion. Had these\r\npoliticians been honest,--though the political growth of Washington\r\nhas hardly admitted of political honesty,--but had these politicians\r\nbeen even ordinarily respectable in their dishonesty, they would\r\nhave claimed secession openly before Congress, while yet their own\r\nPresident was at the White House. Congress would not have acceded.\r\nCongress itself could not have acceded under the constitution; but a\r\nway would have been found, had the southern States been persistent in\r\ntheir demand. A way, indeed, has been found; but it has lain through\r\nfire and water, through blood and ruin, through treason and theft,\r\nand the downfall of national greatness. Secession will, I think, be\r\naccomplished, and the southern Confederation of States will stand\r\nsomething higher in the world than Mexico and the republics of\r\nCentral America. Her cotton monopoly will have vanished, and her\r\nwealth will have been wasted.\r\n\r\nI think that history will agree with me in saying that the northern\r\nStates had no alternative but war. What concession could they make?\r\nCould they promise to hold their peace about slavery? And had they\r\nso promised, would the South have believed them? They might have\r\nconceded secession; that is, they might have given all that would\r\nhave been demanded. But what individual chooses to yield to such\r\ndemands; and if not an individual,--then what people will do so?\r\nBut in truth they could not have yielded all that was demanded. Had\r\nsecession been granted to South Carolina and Georgia, Virginia would\r\nhave been coerced to join those States by the nature of her property,\r\nand with Virginia Maryland would have gone, and Washington, the\r\ncapital. What may be the future line of division between the North\r\nand the South I will not pretend to say; but that line will probably\r\nbe dictated by the North. It may still be hoped that Missouri,\r\nKentucky, Virginia, and Maryland will go with the North, and be\r\nrescued from slavery. But had secession been yielded, had the\r\nprestige of success fallen to the lot of the South, those States must\r\nhave become southern.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject of slavery--for in discussing the cause of the\r\nwar, slavery is the subject that must be discussed--I cannot forbear\r\nto say a few words about the negroes of the North American States.\r\nThe republican party of the North is divided into two sections, of\r\nwhich one may be called abolitionist, and the other non-abolitionist.\r\nMr. Lincoln's government presumes itself to belong to the latter,\r\nthough its tendencies towards abolition are very strong. The\r\nabolition party is growing in strength daily. It is but a short time\r\nsince Wendell Phillips could not lecture in Boston without a guard of\r\npolice. Now, at this moment of my writing, he is a popular hero. The\r\nvery men who, five years since, were accustomed to make speeches,\r\nstrong as words could frame them, against abolition, are now turning\r\nround, and if not preaching abolition, are patting the backs of those\r\nwho do so. I heard one of Mr. Lincoln's cabinet declare old John\r\nBrown to be a hero and a martyr. All the Protestant Germans are\r\nabolitionists,--and they have become so strong a political element\r\nin the country that many now declare that no future President can be\r\nelected without their aid. The object is declared boldly. No long\r\npolitical scheme is asked for, but instant abolition is wanted;\r\nabolition to be declared while yet the war is raging. Let the slaves\r\nof all rebels be declared free; and all slave-owners in the seceding\r\nStates are rebels!\r\n\r\nOne cannot but ask what abolition means, and to what it would lead.\r\nAny ordinance of abolition now pronounced would not effect the\r\nemancipation of the slaves, but might probably effect a servile\r\ninsurrection. I will not accuse those who are preaching this crusade\r\nof any desire for so fearful a scourge on the land. They probably\r\ncalculate that an edict of abolition once given would be so much done\r\ntowards the ultimate winning of the battle. They are making their\r\nhay while their sun shines. But if they could emancipate those four\r\nmillion slaves, in what way would they then treat them? How would\r\nthey feed them? In what way would they treat the ruined owners of the\r\nslaves, and the acres of land which would lie uncultivated? Of all\r\nsubjects with which a man can be called on to deal, it is the most\r\ndifficult. But a New England abolitionist talks of it as though no\r\nmore were required than an open path for his humanitarian energies.\r\n\"I could arrange it all to-morrow morning,\" a gentleman said to me,\r\nwho is well known for his zeal in this cause!\r\n\r\nArrange it all to-morrow morning,--abolition of slavery having\r\nbecome a fact during the night! I should not envy that gentleman his\r\nmorning's work. It was bad enough with us, but what were our numbers\r\ncompared with those of the southern States? We paid a price for the\r\nslaves, but no price is to be paid in this case. The value of the\r\nproperty would probably be lowly estimated at £100 a piece for men,\r\nwomen, and children, or four hundred million pounds for the whole\r\npopulation. They form the wealth of the South; and if they were\r\nbought, what should be done with them? They are like children. Every\r\nslave-owner in the country,--every man who has had ought to do with\r\nslaves,--will tell the same story. In Maryland and Delaware are men\r\nwho hate slavery, who would be only too happy to enfranchise their\r\nslaves; but the negroes who have been slaves are not fit for freedom.\r\nIn many cases, practically, they cannot be enfranchised. Give them\r\ntheir liberty, starting them well in the world at what expense you\r\nplease, and at the end of six months they will come back upon your\r\nhands for the means of support. Everything must be done for them.\r\nThey expect food and clothes, and instruction as to every simple act\r\nof life, as do children. The negro domestic servant is handy at his\r\nown work; no servant more so; but he cannot go beyond that. He does\r\nnot comprehend the object and purport of continued industry. If he\r\nhave money he will play with it,--will amuse himself with it. If\r\nhe have none, he will amuse himself without it. His work is like a\r\nschoolboy's task; he knows it must be done, but never comprehends\r\nthat the doing of it is the very end and essence of his life. He is a\r\nchild in all things, and the extent of prudential wisdom to which he\r\never attains is to disdain emancipation, and cling to the security\r\nof his bondage. It is true enough that slavery has been a curse.\r\nWhatever may have been its effect on the negroes, it has been a\r\ndeadly curse upon the white masters.\r\n\r\nThe preaching of abolition during the war is to me either the\r\ndeadliest of sins or the vainest of follies. Its only immediate\r\nresult possible would be servile insurrection. That is so manifestly\r\natrocious,--a wish for it would be so hellish, that I do not presume\r\nthe preachers of abolition to entertain it. But if that be not meant,\r\nit must be intended that an act of emancipation should be carried\r\nthroughout the slave States,--either in their separation from the\r\nNorth, or after their subjection and consequent reunion with the\r\nNorth. As regards the States while in secession, the North cannot\r\noperate upon their slaves any more than England can operate on\r\nthe slaves of Cuba. But if a reunion is to be a precursor of\r\nemancipation, surely that reunion should be first effected. A\r\ndecision in the northern and western mind on such a subject cannot\r\nassist in obtaining that reunion,--but must militate against the\r\npracticability of such an object. This is so well understood, that\r\nMr. Lincoln and his Government do not dare to call themselves\r\nabolitionists.*\r\n\r\n  *President Lincoln has proposed a plan for the emancipation of\r\n   slaves in the border States, and for compensation to the owners.\r\n   His doing so proves that he regards present emancipation in the\r\n   Gulf States as quite out of the question. It also proves that he\r\n   looks forward to the recovery of the border States for the North,\r\n   but that he does not look forward to the recovery of the Gulf\r\n   States.\r\n\r\nAbolition, in truth, is a political cry. It is the banner of defiance\r\nopposed to secession. As the differences between the North and\r\nSouth have grown with years, and have swelled to the proportions of\r\nnational antipathy, southern nullification has amplified itself into\r\nsecession, and northern free-soil principles have burst into this\r\ngrowth of abolition. Men have not calculated the results. Charming\r\npictures are drawn for you of the negro in a state of Utopian bliss,\r\nowning his own hoe and eating his own hog; in a paradise, where\r\neverything is bought and sold, except his wife, his little ones, and\r\nhimself. But the enfranchised negro has always thrown away his hoe,\r\nhas eaten any man's hog but his own,--and has too often sold his\r\ndaughter for a dollar when any such market has been open to him.\r\n\r\nI confess that this cry of abolition has been made peculiarly\r\ndispleasing to me by the fact that the northern abolitionist is by\r\nno means willing to give even to the negro who is already free that\r\nposition in the world which alone might tend to raise him in the\r\nscale of human beings,--if anything can so raise him and make him fit\r\nfor freedom. The abolitionists hold that the negro is the white man's\r\nequal. I do not. I see, or think that I see, that the negro is the\r\nwhite man's inferior through laws of nature. That he is not mentally\r\nfit to cope with white men,--I speak of the full-blooded negro,--and\r\nthat he must fill a position simply servile. But the abolitionist\r\ndeclares him to be the white man's equal. But yet, when he has him at\r\nhis elbow, he treats him with a scorn which even the negro can hardly\r\nendure. I will give him political equality, but not social equality,\r\nsays the abolitionist. But even in this he is untrue. A black man may\r\nvote in New York, but he cannot vote under the same circumstances as\r\na white man. He is subjected to qualifications which in truth debar\r\nhim from the poll. A white man votes by manhood suffrage, providing\r\nhe has been for one year an inhabitant of his State; but a man of\r\ncolour must have been for three years a citizen of the State, and\r\nmust own a property qualification of £50 free of debt. But political\r\nequality is not what such men want, nor indeed is it social equality.\r\nIt is social tolerance and social sympathy; and these are denied to\r\nthe negro. An American abolitionist would not sit at table with a\r\nnegro. He might do so in England at the house of an English duchess;\r\nbut in his own country the proposal of such a companion would be\r\nan insult to him. He will not sit with him in a public carriage if\r\nhe can avoid it. In New York I have seen special street-cars for\r\ncoloured people. The abolitionist is struck with horror when he\r\nthinks that a man and a brother should be a slave; but when the man\r\nand the brother has been made free, he is regarded with loathing and\r\ncontempt. All this I cannot see with equanimity. There is falsehood\r\nin it from the beginning to the end. The slave as a rule is well\r\ntreated,--gets all he wants and almost all he desires. The free negro\r\nas a rule is ill treated, and does not get that consideration which\r\nalone might put him in the worldly position for which his advocate\r\ndeclares him to be fit. It is false throughout,--this preaching. The\r\nnegro is not the white man's equal by nature. But to the free negro\r\nin the northern States this inequality is increased by the white\r\nman's hardness to him.\r\n\r\nIn a former book which I wrote some few years since, I expressed an\r\nopinion as to the probable destiny of this race in the West Indies.\r\nI will not now go over that question again. I then divided the\r\ninhabitants of those islands into three classes,--the white, the\r\nblack, and the coloured, taking a nomenclature which I found there\r\nprevailing. By coloured men I alluded to mulattoes, and all those of\r\nmixed European and African blood. The word \"coloured,\" in the States,\r\nseems to apply to the whole negro race, whether full-blooded or\r\nhalf-blooded. I allude to this now because I wish to explain that, in\r\nspeaking of what I conceive to be the intellectual inferiority of the\r\nnegro race, I allude to those of pure negro descent,--or of descent\r\nso nearly pure as to make the negro element manifestly predominant.\r\nIn the West Indies, where I had more opportunity of studying the\r\nsubject, I always believed myself able to tell a negro from a\r\ncoloured man. Indeed the classes are to a great degree distinct\r\nthere, the greater portion of the retail trade of the country being\r\nin the hands of the coloured people. But in the States I have been\r\nable to make no such distinction. One sees generally neither the rich\r\nyellow of the West Indian mulatto, nor the deep oily black of the\r\nWest Indian negro. The prevailing hue is a dry, dingy brown,--almost\r\ndusty in its dryness. I have observed but little difference made\r\nbetween the negro and the half-caste,--and no difference in the\r\nactual treatment. I have never met in American society any man or\r\nwoman in whose veins there can have been presumed to be any taint of\r\nAfrican blood. In Jamaica they are daily to be found in society.\r\n\r\nEvery Englishman probably looks forward to the accomplishment of\r\nabolition of slavery at some future day. I feel as sure of it as I do\r\nof the final judgment. When or how it shall come I will not attempt\r\nto foretell. The mode which seems to promise the surest success\r\nand the least present or future inconvenience, would be an edict\r\nenfranchising all female children born after a certain date, and all\r\ntheir children. Under such an arrangement the negro population would\r\nprobably die out slowly,--very slowly. What might then be the fate of\r\nthe cotton-fields of the Gulf States, who shall dare to say? It may\r\nbe that coolies from India and from China will then have taken the\r\nplace of the negro there, as they probably will have done also in\r\nGuiana and the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TO ST. LOUIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough I had felt Washington to be disagreeable as a city, yet I was\r\nalmost sorry to leave it when the day of my departure came. I had\r\nallowed myself a month for my sojourn in the capital, and I had\r\nstayed a month to the day. Then came the trouble of packing up,\r\nthe necessity of calling on a long list of acquaintances one after\r\nanother, the feeling that bad as Washington might be, I might be\r\ngoing to places that were worse, a conviction that I should get\r\nbeyond the reach of my letters, and a sort of affection which I had\r\nacquired for my rooms. My landlord, being a coloured man, told me\r\nthat he was sorry I was going. Would I not remain? Would I come back\r\nto him? Had I been comfortable? Only for so and so or so and so, he\r\nwould have done better for me. No white American citizen, occupying\r\nthe position of landlord, would have condescended to such comfortable\r\nwords. I knew the man did not in truth want me to stay, as a lady\r\nand gentleman were waiting to go in the moment I went out; but I did\r\nnot the less value the assurance. One hungers and thirsts after such\r\ncivil words among American citizens of this class. The clerks and\r\nmanagers at hotels, the officials at railway stations, the cashiers\r\nat banks, the women in the shops;--ah! they are the worst of all. An\r\nAmerican woman who is bound by her position to serve you,--who is\r\npaid in some shape to supply your wants, whether to sell you a bit of\r\nsoap or bring you a towel in your bedroom at an hotel,--is, I think,\r\nof all human creatures, the most insolent. I certainly had a feeling\r\nof regret at parting with my coloured friend,--and some regret also\r\nas regards a few that were white.\r\n\r\nAs I drove down Pennsylvania Avenue, through the slush and mud, and\r\nsaw, perhaps for the last time, those wretchedly dirty horse sentries\r\nwho had refused to allow me to trot through the streets, I almost\r\nwished that I could see more of them. How absurd they looked, with\r\na whole kit of rattletraps strapped on their horses' backs behind\r\nthem,--blankets, coats, canteens, coils of rope, and, always at the\r\ntop of everything else, a tin pot! No doubt these things are all\r\nnecessary to a mounted sentry, or they would not have been there; but\r\nit always seemed as though the horse had been loaded gipsy-fashion,\r\nin a manner that I may perhaps best describe as higgledy-piggledy,\r\nand that there was a want of military precision in the packing. The\r\nman would have looked more graceful, and the soldier more warlike,\r\nhad the pannikin been made to assume some rigidly fixed position\r\ninstead of dangling among the ropes. The drawn sabre, too, never\r\nconsorted well with the dirty outside woollen wrapper which generally\r\nhung loose from the man's neck. Heaven knows, I did not begrudge him\r\nhis comforter in that cold weather, or even his long, uncombed shock\r\nof hair; but I think he might have been made more spruce, and I am\r\nsure that he could not have looked more uncomfortable. As I went,\r\nhowever, I felt for him a sort of affection, and wished in my heart\r\nof hearts that he might soon be enabled to return to some more\r\ncongenial employment.\r\n\r\nI went out by the Capitol, and saw that also, as I then believed,\r\nfor the last time. With all its faults it is a great building, and,\r\nthough unfinished, is effective; its very size and pretension give it\r\na certain majesty. What will be the fate of that vast pile, and of\r\nthose other costly public edifices at Washington, should the South\r\nsucceed wholly in their present enterprise? If Virginia should ever\r\nbecome a part of the southern republic, Washington cannot remain the\r\ncapital of the northern republic. In such case it would be almost\r\nbetter to let Maryland go also, so that the future destiny of that\r\nunfortunate city may not be a source of trouble, and a stumbling\r\nblock of opprobrium. Even if Virginia be saved, its position will be\r\nmost unfortunate.\r\n\r\nI fancy that the railroads in those days must have been doing a very\r\nprosperous business. From New York to Philadelphia, thence on to\r\nBaltimore, and again to Washington, I had found the cars full; so\r\nfull that sundry passengers could not find seats. Now, on my return\r\nto Baltimore, they were again crowded. The stations were all crowded.\r\nLuggage-trains were going in and out as fast as the rails could carry\r\nthem. Among the passengers almost half were soldiers. I presume that\r\nthese were men going on furlough, or on special occasions; for the\r\nregiments were of course not received by ordinary passenger trains.\r\nAbout this time a return was called for by Congress of all the moneys\r\npaid by the government, on account of the army, to the lines between\r\nNew York and Washington. Whether or no it was ever furnished I did\r\nnot hear; but it was openly stated that the colonels of regiments\r\nreceived large gratuities from certain railway companies for the\r\nregiments passing over their lines. Charges of a similar nature\r\nwere made against officers, contractors, quartermasters, paymasters,\r\ngenerals, and cabinet ministers. I am not prepared to say that any\r\nof these men had dirty hands. It was not for me to make inquiries on\r\nsuch matters. But the continuance and universality of the accusations\r\nwere dreadful. When everybody is suspected of being dishonest,\r\ndishonesty almost ceases to be regarded as disgraceful.\r\n\r\nI will allude to a charge made against one member of the Cabinet,\r\nbecause the circumstances of the case were all acknowledged and\r\nproved. This gentleman employed his wife's brother-in-law to buy\r\nships, and the agent so employed pocketed about £20,000 by the\r\ntransaction in six months. The excuse made was that this profit was\r\nin accordance with the usual practice of the ship-dealing trade, and\r\nthat it was paid by the owners who sold, and not by the Government\r\nwhich bought. But in so vast an agency the ordinary rate of profit on\r\nsuch business became an enormous sum; and the gentleman who made the\r\nplea must surely have understood that that £20,000 was in fact paid\r\nby the government. It is the purchaser, and not the seller, who in\r\nfact pays all such fees. The question is this,--Should the government\r\nhave paid so vast a sum for one man's work for six months? And if\r\nso, was it well that that sum should go into the pocket of a near\r\nrelative of the Minister whose special business it was to protect the\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nAmerican private soldiers are not pleasant fellow-travellers. They\r\nare loud and noisy, and swear quite as much as the army could\r\npossibly have sworn in Flanders. They are, moreover, very dirty; and\r\neach man, with his long, thick great-coat, takes up more space than\r\nis intended to be allotted to him. Of course I felt that if I chose\r\nto travel in a country while it had such a piece of business on its\r\nhands, I could not expect that everything should be found in exact\r\norder. The matter for wonder, perhaps, was that the ordinary affairs\r\nof life were so little disarranged, and that any travelling at all\r\nwas practicable. Nevertheless the fact remains that American private\r\nsoldiers are not agreeable fellow-travellers.\r\n\r\nIt was my present intention to go due west across the country into\r\nMissouri, skirting, as it were, the line of the war which had now\r\nextended itself from the Atlantic across into Kansas. There were at\r\nthis time three main armies,--that of the Potomac, as the army of\r\nVirginia was called, of which Maclellan held the command; that of\r\nKentucky, under General Buell, who was stationed at Louisville on\r\nthe Ohio; and the army on the Mississippi, which had been under\r\nFremont, and of which General Halleck now held the command. To these\r\nwere opposed the three rebel armies of Beauregard, in Virginia; of\r\nJohnston, on the borders of Kentucky and Tennessee; and of Price, in\r\nMissouri. There was also a fourth army in Kansas, west of Missouri,\r\nunder General Hunter; and while I was in Washington another general,\r\nsupposed by some to be the \"coming man,\" was sent down to Kansas to\r\nparticipate in General Hunter's command. This was General Jim Lane,\r\nwho resigned a seat in the Senate in order that he might undertake\r\nthis military duty. When he reached Kansas, having on his route made\r\nsundry violent abolition speeches, and proclaimed his intention\r\nof sweeping slavery out of the south-western States, he came to\r\nloggerheads with his superior officer respecting their relative\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Baltimore, I found the place knee-deep in mud and\r\nslush and half-melted snow. It was then raining hard,--raining dirt,\r\nnot water, as it sometimes does. Worse weather for soldiers out in\r\ntents could not be imagined,--nor for men who were not soldiers,\r\nbut who nevertheless were compelled to leave their houses. I only\r\nremained at Baltimore one day, and then started again, leaving there\r\nthe greater part of my baggage. I had a vague hope,--a hope which\r\nI hardly hoped to realize,--that I might be able to get through to\r\nthe South. At any rate I made myself ready for the chance by making\r\nmy travelling impediments as light as possible, and started from\r\nBaltimore, prepared to endure all the discomfort which lightness\r\nof baggage entails. My route lay over the Alleghanies by Pittsburg\r\nand Cincinnati, and my first stopping-place was at Harrisburg, the\r\npolitical capital of Pennsylvania. There is nothing special at\r\nHarrisburg to arrest any traveller; but the local legislature of\r\nthe State was then sitting, and I was desirous of seeing the Senate\r\nand Representatives of at any rate one State, during its period of\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania the General Assembly, as the joint legislature is\r\ncalled, sits every year, commencing their work early in January, and\r\ncontinuing till it be finished. The usual period of sitting seems to\r\nbe about ten weeks. In the majority of States, the legislature only\r\nsits every other year. In this State it sits every year, and the\r\nrepresentatives are elected annually. The senators are elected for\r\nthree years, a third of the body being chosen each year. The two\r\nchambers were ugly, convenient rooms, arranged very much after the\r\nfashion of the halls of Congress at Washington. Each member had his\r\nown desk, and his own chair. They were placed in the shape of a\r\nhorse-shoe, facing the chairman, before whom sat three clerks. In\r\nneither house did I hear any set speech. The voices of the Speaker\r\nand of the clerks of the houses were heard more frequently than\r\nthose of the members; and the business seemed to be done in a dull,\r\nserviceable, methodical manner, likely to be useful to the country,\r\nand very uninteresting to the gentlemen engaged. Indeed at Washington\r\nalso, in Congress, it seemed to me that there was much less of set\r\nspeeches than in our House of Commons. With us there are certain\r\nmen whom it seems impossible to put down, and by whom the time of\r\nParliament is occupied from night to night, with advantage to no one\r\nand with satisfaction to none but themselves. I do not think that the\r\nevil prevails to the same extent in America, either in Congress or in\r\nthe State legislatures. As regards Washington, this good result may\r\nbe assisted by a salutary practice which, as I was assured, prevails\r\nthere. A member gets his speech printed at the Government cost, and\r\nsends it down free by post to his constituents, without troubling\r\neither the house with hearing it, or himself with speaking it. I\r\ncannot but think that the practice might be copied with success on\r\nour side of the water.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the members of the legislature of Pennsylvania did\r\nnot impress me very favourably. I do not know why we should wish a\r\nlegislator to be neat in his dress, and comely, in some degree, in\r\nhis personal appearance. There is no good reason, perhaps, why they\r\nshould have cleaner shirts than their outside brethren, or have been\r\nmore particular in the use of soap and water, and brush and comb.\r\nBut I have an idea that if ever our own Parliament becomes dirty, it\r\nwill lose its prestige; and I cannot but think that the Parliament\r\nof Pennsylvania would gain an accession of dignity by some slightly\r\nincreased devotion to the Graces. I saw in the two houses but one\r\ngentleman, a senator, who looked like a Quaker; but even he was a\r\nvery untidy Quaker.\r\n\r\nI paid my respects to the Governor, and found him briskly employed\r\nin arranging the appointments of officers. All the regimental\r\nappointments to the volunteer regiments,--and that is practically\r\nto the whole body of the army,*--are made by the State in which the\r\nregiments are mustered. When the affair commenced, the captains and\r\nlieutenants were chosen by the men; but it was found that this would\r\nnot do. When the skeleton of a State militia only was required, such\r\nan arrangement was popular and not essentially injurious; but now\r\nthat war had become a reality, and that volunteers were required to\r\nobey discipline, some other mode of promotion was found necessary.\r\nAs far as I could understand, the appointments were in the hands of\r\nthe State Governor, who however was expected in the selection of\r\nthe superior officers to be guided by the expressed wishes of the\r\nregiment, when no objection existed to such a choice. In the present\r\ninstance the Governor's course was very thorny. Certain unfinished\r\nregiments were in the act of being amalgamated;--two perfect\r\nregiments being made up from perhaps five imperfect regiments, and\r\nso on. But though the privates had not been forthcoming to the full\r\nnumber for each expected regiment, there had been no such dearth\r\nof officers, and consequently the present operation consisted in\r\nreducing their number.\r\n\r\n  *The army at this time consisted nominally of 660,000 men, of\r\n   whom only 20,000 were regulars.\r\n\r\nNothing can be much uglier than the State House at Harrisburg, but\r\nit commands a magnificent view of one of the valleys into which the\r\nAlleghany mountains is broken. Harrisburg is immediately under the\r\nrange, probably at its finest point, and the railway running west\r\nfrom the town to Pittsburg, Cincinnati, and Chicago passes right\r\nover the chain. The line has been magnificently engineered, and the\r\nscenery is very grand. I went over the Alleghanies in mid-winter when\r\nthey were covered with snow, but even when so seen they were very\r\nfine. The view down the valley from Altoona, a point near the summit,\r\nmust in summer be excessively lovely. I stopped at Altoona one night\r\nwith the object of getting about among the hills, and making the best\r\nof the winter view; but I found it impossible to walk. The snow had\r\nbecome frozen and was like glass. I could not progress a mile in any\r\nway. With infinite labour I climbed to the top of one little hill,\r\nand when there became aware that the descent would be very much more\r\ndifficult. I did get down, but should not choose to describe the\r\nmanner in which I accomplished the descent.\r\n\r\nIn running down the mountains to Pittsburg an accident occurred which\r\nin any other country would have thrown the engine off the line, and\r\nhave reduced the carriages behind the engine to a heap of ruins. But\r\nhere it had no other effect than that of delaying us for three or\r\nfour hours. The tire of one of the heavy driving wheels flew off, and\r\nin the shock the body of the wheel itself was broken, one spoke and a\r\nportion of the circumference of the wheel was carried away, and the\r\nsteam-chamber was ripped open. Nevertheless the train was pulled up,\r\nneither the engine nor any of the carriages got off the line, and\r\nthe men in charge of the train seemed to think very lightly of the\r\nmatter. I was amused to see how little was made of the affair by\r\nany of the passengers. In England a delay of three hours would in\r\nitself produce a great amount of grumbling, or at least many signs\r\nof discomfort and temporary unhappiness. But here no one said a word.\r\nSome of the younger men got out and looked at the ruined wheel; but\r\nmost of the passengers kept their seats, chewed their tobacco, and\r\nwent to sleep. In all such matters an American is much more patient\r\nthan an Englishman. To sit quiet, without speech, and ruminate in\r\nsome contorted position of body comes to him by nature. On this\r\noccasion I did not hear a word of complaint--nor yet a word of\r\nsurprise or thankfulness that the accident had been attended with no\r\nserious result. \"I have got a furlough for ten days,\" one soldier\r\nsaid to me. \"And I have missed every connection all through from\r\nWashington here. I shall have just time to turn round and go back\r\nwhen I get home.\" But he did not seem to be in any way dissatisfied.\r\nHe had not referred to his relatives when he spoke of \"missing his\r\nconnections,\" but to his want of good fortune as regarded railway\r\ntravelling. He had reached Baltimore too late for the train on to\r\nHarrisburg, and Harrisburg too late for the train on to Pittsburg.\r\nNow he must again reach Pittsburg too late for his further journey.\r\nBut nevertheless he seemed to be well pleased with his position.\r\n\r\nPittsburg is the Merthyr-Tydvil of Pennsylvania,--or perhaps I should\r\nbetter describe it as an amalgamation of Swansea, Merthyr-Tydvil, and\r\nSouth Shields. It is without exception the blackest place which I\r\never saw. The three English towns which I have named are very dirty,\r\nbut all their combined soot and grease and dinginess do not equal\r\nthat of Pittsburg. As regards scenery it is beautifully situated,\r\nbeing at the foot of the Alleghany mountains, and at the juncture\r\nof the two rivers Monongahela and Alleghany. Here, at the town,\r\nthey come together and form the river Ohio. Nothing can be more\r\npicturesque than the site; for the spurs of the mountains come down\r\nclose round the town, and the rivers are broad and swift, and can\r\nbe seen for miles from heights which may be reached in a short walk.\r\nEven the filth and wondrous blackness of the place are picturesque\r\nwhen looked down upon from above. The tops of the churches are\r\nvisible, and some of the larger buildings may be partially traced\r\nthrough the thick, brown, settled smoke. But the city itself is\r\nburied in a dense cloud. The atmosphere was especially heavy when\r\nI was there, and the effect was probably increased by the general\r\ndarkness of the weather. The Monongahela is crossed by a fine bridge,\r\nand on the other side the ground rises at once, almost with the\r\nrapidity of a precipice; so that a commanding view is obtained down\r\nupon the town and the two rivers and the different bridges, from a\r\nheight immediately above them. I was never more in love with smoke\r\nand dirt than when I stood here and watched the darkness of night\r\nclose in upon the floating soot which hovered over the housetops of\r\nthe city. I cannot say that I saw the sun set, for there was no sun.\r\nI should say that the sun never shone at Pittsburg,--as foreigners\r\nwho visit London in November declare that the sun never shines there.\r\n\r\nWalking along the river-side I counted thirty-two steamers, all\r\nbeached upon the shore with their bows towards the land,--large\r\nboats, capable probably of carrying from one to two hundred\r\npassengers each, and about 300 tons of merchandise. On inquiry I\r\nfound that many of these were not now at work. They were resting\r\nidle, the trade down the Mississippi below St. Louis having been\r\ncut off by the war. Many of them, however, were still running,\r\nthe passage down the river being open to Wheeling in Virginia, to\r\nPortsmouth, Cincinnati and the whole of South Ohio, to Louisville\r\nin Kentucky, and to Cairo in Illinois, where the Ohio joins the\r\nMississippi. The amount of traffic carried on by these boats while\r\nthe country was at peace within itself was very great, and conclusive\r\nas to the increasing prosperity of the people. It seems that\r\neverybody travels in America, and that nothing is thought of\r\ndistance. A young man will step into a car and sit beside you, with\r\nthat easy, careless air which is common to a railway passenger\r\nin England who is passing from one station to the next; and on\r\nconversing with him you will find that he is going seven or eight\r\nhundred miles. He is supplied with fresh newspapers three or four\r\ntimes a day as he passes by the towns at which they are published; he\r\neats a large assortment of gum-drops and apples, and is quite as much\r\nat home as in his own house. On board the river boats it is the same\r\nwith him, with this exception, that when there he can get whisky when\r\nhe wants it. He knows nothing of the ennui of travelling, and never\r\nseems to long for the end of his journey, as travellers do with us.\r\nShould his boat come to grief upon the river, and lie by for a day or\r\na night, it does not in the least disconcert him. He seats himself\r\nupon three chairs, takes a bite of tobacco, thrusts his hands into\r\nhis trousers pockets and revels in an elysium of his own.\r\n\r\nI was told that the stockholders in these boats were in a bad way at\r\nthe present time. There were no dividends going. The same story was\r\nrepeated as to many and many an investment. Where the war created\r\nbusiness, as it had done on some of the main lines of railroad and\r\nin some special towns, money was passing very freely; but away from\r\nthis, ruin seemed to have fallen on the enterprise of the country.\r\nMen were not broken-hearted, nor were they even melancholy; but they\r\nwere simply ruined. That is nothing in the States, so long as the\r\nruined man has the means left to him of supplying his daily wants\r\ntill he can start himself again in life. It is almost the normal\r\ncondition of the American man in business; and therefore I am\r\ninclined to think that when this war is over, and things begin to\r\nsettle themselves into new grooves, commerce will recover herself\r\nmore quickly there than she would do among any other people. It is so\r\ncommon a thing to hear of an enterprise that has never paid a dollar\r\nof interest on the original outlay,--of hotels, canals, railroads,\r\nbanks, blocks of houses, &c., that never paid even in the happy days\r\nof peace,--that one is tempted to disregard the absence of dividends,\r\nand to believe that such a trifling accident will not act as any\r\ncheck on future speculation. In no country has pecuniary ruin been\r\nso common as in the States; but then in no country is pecuniary ruin\r\nso little ruinous. \"We are a recuperative people,\" a west-country\r\ngentleman once said to me. I doubted the propriety of his word, but\r\nI acknowledged the truth of his assertion.\r\n\r\nPittsburg and Alleghany, which latter is a town similar in its nature\r\nto Pittsburg on the other side of the river of the same name, regard\r\nthemselves as places apart; but they are in effect one and the same\r\ncity. They live under the same blanket of soot, which is woven by the\r\njoint efforts of the two places. Their united population is 135,000,\r\nof which Alleghany owns about 50,000. The industry of the towns is of\r\nthat sort which arises from a union of coal and iron in the vicinity.\r\nThe Pennsylvanian coalfields are the most prolific in the Union;\r\nand Pittsburg is therefore great, exactly as Merthyr-Tydvil and\r\nBirmingham are great. But the foundry-work at Pittsburg is more\r\nnearly allied to the heavy, rough works of the Welsh coal metropolis\r\nthan to the finish and polish of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n\"Why cannot you consume your own smoke?\" I asked a gentleman there.\r\n\"Fuel is so cheap that it would not pay,\" he answered. His idea of\r\nthe advantage of consuming smoke was confined to the question of its\r\npaying as a simple operation in itself. The consequent cleanliness\r\nand improvement in the atmosphere had not entered into his\r\ncalculations. Any such result might be a fortuitous benefit, but was\r\nnot of sufficient importance to make any effort in that direction\r\nexpedient on its own account. \"Coal was burned,\" he said, \"in the\r\nfoundries at something less than two dollars a ton; while that was\r\nthe case, it could not answer the purpose of any iron-founder to put\r\nup an apparatus for the consumption of smoke.\" I did not pursue the\r\nargument any further, as I perceived that we were looking at the\r\nmatter from two different points of view.\r\n\r\nEverything in the hotel was black; not black to the eye, for the eye\r\nteaches itself to discriminate colours even when loaded with dirt,\r\nbut black to the touch. On coming out of a tub of water my foot took\r\nan impress from the carpet exactly as it would have done had I trod\r\nbarefooted on a path laid with soot. I thought that I was turning\r\nnegro upwards, till I put my wet hand upon the carpet, and found that\r\nthe result was the same. And yet the carpet was green to the eye,--a\r\ndull, dingy green, but still green. \"You shouldn't damp your feet,\"\r\na man said to me, to whom I mentioned the catastrophe. Certainly\r\nPittsburg is the dirtiest place I ever saw, but it is, as I said\r\nbefore, very picturesque in its dirt when looked at from above the\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\nFrom Pittsburg I went on by train to Cincinnati, and was soon in the\r\nState of Ohio. I confess that I have never felt any great regard for\r\nPennsylvania. It has always had in my estimation a low character for\r\ncommercial honesty, and a certain flavour of pretentious hypocrisy.\r\nThis probably has been much owing to the acerbity and pungency of\r\nSydney Smith's witty denunciations against the drab-coloured State.\r\nIt is noted for repudiation of its own debts, and for sharpness in\r\nexaction of its own bargains. It has been always smart in banking. It\r\nhas given Buchanan as a President to the country, and Cameron as a\r\nSecretary at War to the Government! When the battle of Bull's Run was\r\nto be fought, Pennsylvanian soldiers were the men who, on that day,\r\nthrew down their arms because the three months' term for which they\r\nhad been enlisted was then expired! Pennsylvania does not in my mind\r\nstand on a par with Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Illinois,\r\nor Virginia. We are apt to connect the name of Benjamin Franklin\r\nwith Pennsylvania, but Franklin was a Boston man. Nevertheless,\r\nPennsylvania is rich and prosperous. Indeed it bears all those marks\r\nwhich Quakers generally leave behind them.\r\n\r\nI had some little personal feeling in visiting Cincinnati, because my\r\nmother had lived there for some time, and had there been concerned in\r\na commercial enterprise, by which no one, I believe, made any great\r\nsum of money. Between thirty and forty years ago she built a bazaar\r\nin Cincinnati, which I was assured by the present owner of the house,\r\nwas at the time of its erection considered to be the great building\r\nof the town. It has been sadly eclipsed now, and by no means rears\r\nits head proudly among the great blocks around it. It had become\r\na \"Physico-medical Institute\" when I was there, and was under\r\nthe dominion of a quack doctor on one side, and of a college of\r\nrights-of-women female medical professors on the other. \"I believe,\r\nsir, no man or woman ever yet made a dollar in that building; and as\r\nfor rent, I don't even expect it.\" Such was the account given of the\r\nunfortunate bazaar by the present proprietor.\r\n\r\nCincinnati has long been known as a great town,--conspicuous among\r\nall towns for the number of hogs which are there killed, salted, and\r\npacked. It is the great hog metropolis of the western States; but\r\nCincinnati has not grown with the rapidity of other towns. It has\r\nnow 170,000 inhabitants, but then it got an early start. St. Louis,\r\nwhich is west of it again, near the confluence of the Missouri and\r\nMississippi, has gone ahead of it. Cincinnati stands on the Ohio\r\nriver, separated by a ferry from Kentucky, which is a slave State.\r\nOhio itself is a free-soil State. When the time comes for arranging\r\nthe line of division, if such time shall ever come, it will be very\r\nhard to say where northern feeling ends and where southern wishes\r\ncommence. Newport and Covington, which are in Kentucky, are suburbs\r\nof Cincinnati; and yet in these places slavery is rife. The domestic\r\nservants are mostly slaves, though it is essential that those so kept\r\nshould be known as slaves who will not run away. It is understood\r\nthat a slave who escapes into Ohio will not be caught and given up by\r\nthe intervention of the Ohio police; and from Covington or Newport\r\nany slave can escape into Ohio with ease. But when that division\r\ntakes place, no river like the Ohio can form the boundary between\r\nthe divided nations. Such rivers are the highways, round which in\r\nthis country people have clustered themselves. A river here is not\r\na natural barrier, but a connecting street. It would be as well to\r\nmake a railway a division, or the centre line of a city a national\r\nboundary. Kentucky and Ohio States are joined together by the Ohio\r\nriver, with Cincinnati on one side and Louisville on the other; and\r\nI do not think that man's act can upset these ties of nature. But\r\nbetween Kentucky and Tennessee there is no such bond of union. There\r\na mathematical line has been simply drawn, a continuation of that\r\nline which divides Virginia from North Carolina, to which two latter\r\nStates Kentucky and Tennessee belonged when the thirteen original\r\nStates first formed themselves into a union. But that mathematical\r\nline has offered no peculiar advantages to population. No great towns\r\ncluster there, and no strong social interests would be dissevered\r\nshould Kentucky throw in her lot with the North, and Tennessee with\r\nthe South; but Kentucky owns a quarter of a million of slaves, and\r\nthose slaves must either be emancipated or removed before such a\r\njunction can be firmly settled.\r\n\r\nThe great business of Cincinnati is hog-killing now, as it used to\r\nbe in the old days of which I have so often heard. It seems to be an\r\nestablished fact, that in this portion of the world the porcine genus\r\nare all hogs. One never hears of a pig. With us a trade in hogs and\r\npigs is subject to some little contumely. There is a feeling, which\r\nhas perhaps never been expressed in words, but which certainly\r\nexists, that these animals are not so honourable in their bearings\r\nas sheep and oxen. It is a prejudice which by no means exists in\r\nCincinnati. There hog killing and salting and packing are very\r\nhonourable, and the great men in the trade are the merchant princes\r\nof the city. I went to see the performance, feeling it to be a duty\r\nto inspect everywhere that which I found to be of most importance;\r\nbut I will not describe it. There were a crowd of men operating,\r\nand I was told that the point of honour was to \"put through\" a hog\r\na minute. It must be understood that the animal enters upon the\r\nceremony alive, and comes out in that cleanly, disembowelled guise in\r\nwhich it may sometimes be seen hanging up previous to the operation\r\nof the pork-butcher's knife. To one special man was appointed a\r\nperformance which seemed to be specially disagreeable, so that he\r\nappeared despicable in my eyes; but when on inquiry I learned that he\r\nearned five dollars, or a pound sterling, a day, my judgment as to\r\nhis position was reversed. And after all what matters the ugly nature\r\nof such an occupation when a man is used to it?\r\n\r\nCincinnati is like all other American towns, with second, third, and\r\nfourth streets, seventh, eighth, and ninth streets, and so on. Then\r\nthe cross-streets are named chiefly from trees. Chesnut, walnut,\r\nlocust, &c. I do not know whence has come this fancy for naming\r\nstreets after trees in the States, but it is very general. The\r\ntown is well built, with good fronts to many of the houses, with\r\nlarge shops and larger stores;--of course also with an enormous\r\nhotel, which has never paid anything like a proper dividend to the\r\nspeculator who built it. It is always the same story. But these towns\r\nshame our provincial towns by their breadth and grandeur. I am afraid\r\nthat speculators with us are trammelled by an \"ignorant impatience of\r\nruin.\" I should not myself like to live in Cincinnati or in any of\r\nthese towns. They are slow, dingy, and uninteresting; but they all\r\npossess an air of substantial, civic dignity. It must however be\r\nremembered that the Americans live much more in towns than we do.\r\nAll with us that are rich and aristocratic and luxurious live in the\r\ncountry, frequenting the metropolis for only a portion of the year.\r\nBut all that are rich and aristocratic and luxurious in the States\r\nlive in the towns. Our provincial towns are not generally chosen as\r\nthe residences of our higher classes.\r\n\r\nCincinnati has 170,000 inhabitants, and there are 14,000 children\r\nat the free schools,--which is about one in twelve of the whole\r\npopulation. This number gives the average of scholars throughout\r\nthe year ended 30th June, 1861. But there are other schools in\r\nCincinnati,--parish schools and private schools, and it is stated to\r\nme that there were in all 32,000 children attending school in the\r\ncity throughout the year. The education at the State schools is very\r\ngood. Thirty-four teachers are employed, at an average salary of £92\r\neach, ranging from £260 to £60 per annum. It is in this matter of\r\neducation that the cities of the free States of America have done so\r\nmuch for the civilization and welfare of their population. This fact\r\ncannot be repeated in their praise too often. Those who have the\r\nmanagement of affairs, who are at the top of the tree, are desirous\r\nof giving to all an opportunity of raising themselves in the scale of\r\nhuman beings. I dislike universal suffrage; I dislike vote by ballot;\r\nI dislike above all things the tyranny of democracy. But I do like\r\nthe political feeling--for it is a political feeling--which induces\r\nevery educated American to lend a hand to the education of his\r\nfellow-citizens. It shows, if nothing else does so, a germ of truth\r\nin that doctrine of equality. It is a doctrine to be forgiven when\r\nhe who preaches it is in truth striving to raise others to his own\r\nlevel;--though utterly unpardonable when the preacher would pull down\r\nothers to his level.\r\n\r\nLeaving Cincinnati I again entered a slave State, namely, Kentucky.\r\nWhen the war broke out Kentucky took upon itself to say that it would\r\nbe neutral, as if neutrality in such a position could by any means\r\nhave been possible! Neutrality on the borders of secession, on\r\nthe battle-field of the coming contest, was of course impossible.\r\nTennessee, to the south, had joined the South by a regular secession\r\nordinance. Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana to the north were of course\r\ntrue to the Union. Under these circumstances it became necessary that\r\nKentucky should choose her side. With the exception of the little\r\nState of Delaware, in which from her position secesssion would have\r\nbeen impossible, Kentucky was, I think, less inclined to rebellion,\r\nmore desirous of standing by the North, than any other of the slave\r\nStates. She did all she could, however, to put off the evil day of so\r\nevil a choice. Abolition within her borders was held to be abominable\r\nas strongly as it was so held in Georgia. She had no sympathy and\r\ncould have none with the teachings and preachings of Massachusetts.\r\nBut she did not wish to belong to a Confederacy of which the northern\r\nStates were to be the declared enemy, and be the border State of the\r\nSouth under such circumstances. She did all she could for personal\r\nneutrality. She made that effort for general reconciliation of which\r\nI have spoken as the Crittenden compromise. But compromises and\r\nreconciliation were not as yet possible, and therefore it was\r\nnecessary that she should choose her part. Her Governor declared\r\nfor secession; and at first also her legislature was inclined to\r\nfollow the Governor. But no overt act of secession by the State\r\nwas committed, and at last it was decided that Kentucky should be\r\ndeclared to be loyal. It was in fact divided. Those on the southern\r\nborder joined the secessionists, whereas the greater portion of the\r\nState, containing Frankfort the capital and the would-be secessionist\r\nGovernor who lived there, joined the North. Men in fact became\r\nunionists or secessionists, not by their own conviction, but through\r\nthe necessity of their positions; and Kentucky, through the necessity\r\nof her position, became one of the scenes of civil war.\r\n\r\nI must confess that the difficulty of the position of the whole\r\ncountry seems to me to have been under-estimated in England. In\r\ncommon life it is not easy to arrange the circumstances of a divorce\r\nbetween man and wife, all whose belongings and associations have for\r\nmany years been in common. Their children, their money, their house,\r\ntheir friends, their secrets, have been joint property and have\r\nformed bonds of union. But yet such quarrels may arise, such mutual\r\nantipathy, such acerbity and even ill-usage, that all who know them\r\nadmit that a separation is needed. So it is here in the States.\r\nFree-soil and slave-soil could, while both were young and unused to\r\npower, go on together,--not without many jars and unhappy bickerings;\r\nbut they did go on together. But now they must part; and how shall\r\nthe parting be made? With which side shall go this child, and who\r\nshall remain in possession of that pleasant homestead? Putting\r\nsecession aside, there were in the United States two distinct\r\npolitical doctrines, of which the extremes were opposed to each other\r\nas pole is opposed to pole. We have no such variance of creed, no\r\nsuch radical difference as to the essential rules of life between\r\nparties in our country. We have no such cause for personal rancour\r\nin our Parliament as has existed for some years past in both Houses\r\nof Congress. These two extreme parties were the slave-owners of the\r\nSouth and the abolitionists of the North and West. Fifty years ago\r\nthe former regarded the institution of slavery as a necessity of\r\ntheir position,--generally as an evil necessity,--and generally also\r\nas a custom to be removed in the course of years. Gradually they have\r\nlearned to look upon slavery as good in itself, and to believe that\r\nit has been the source of their wealth and the strength of their\r\nposition. They have declared it to be a blessing inalienable,--that\r\nshould remain among them for ever,--as an inheritance not to be\r\ntouched, and not to be spoken of with hard words. Fifty years ago\r\nthe abolitionists of the North differed only in opinion from the\r\nslave-owners of the South in hoping for a speedier end to this stain\r\nupon the nation; and in thinking that some action should be taken\r\ntowards the final emancipation of the bondsmen. But they also have\r\nprogressed; and as the southern masters have called the institution\r\nblessed, they have called it accursed. Their numbers have increased,\r\nand with their numbers their power and their violence. In this way\r\ntwo parties have been formed who could not look on each other without\r\nhatred. An intermediate doctrine has been held by men who were nearer\r\nin their sympathies to the slave-owners than to the abolitionists;\r\nbut who were not disposed to justify slavery as a thing apart. These\r\nmen have been aware that slavery has existed in accordance with the\r\nconstitution of their country, and have been willing to attach the\r\nstain which accompanies the institution to the individual State\r\nwhich entertains it, and not to the national Government, by which\r\nthe question has been constitutionally ignored. The men who have\r\nparticipated in the Government have naturally been inclined towards\r\nthe middle doctrine; but as the two extremes have retreated further\r\nfrom each other, the power of this middle-class of politicians has\r\ndecreased. Mr. Lincoln, though he does not now declare himself an\r\nabolitionist, was elected by the abolitionists; and when, as a\r\nconsequence of that election, secession was threatened, no step which\r\nhe could have taken would have satisfied the South which had opposed\r\nhim, and been at the same time true to the North which had chosen\r\nhim. But it was possible that his Government might save Maryland,\r\nVirginia, Kentucky, and Missouri. As Radicals in England become\r\nsimple Whigs when they are admitted into public offices, so did Mr.\r\nLincoln with his government become anti-abolitionist when he entered\r\non his functions. Had he combated secession with emancipation of\r\nthe slaves, no slave State would or could have held by the Union.\r\nAbolition for a lecturer may be a telling subject. It is easy to\r\nbring down rounds of applause by tales of the wrongs of bondage. But\r\nto men in office, abolition was too stern a reality. It signified\r\nservile insurrection, absolute ruin to all southern slave-owners, and\r\nthe absolute enmity of every slave State.\r\n\r\nBut that task of steering between the two has been very difficult. I\r\nfear that the task of so steering with success is almost impossible.\r\nIn England it is thought that Mr. Lincoln might have maintained the\r\nUnion by compromising matters with the South,--or if not so, that he\r\nmight have maintained peace by yielding to the South. But no such\r\npower was in his hands. While we were blaming him for opposition to\r\nall southern terms, his own friends in the North were saying that\r\nall principle and truth was abandoned for the sake of such States as\r\nKentucky and Missouri. \"Virginia is gone; Maryland cannot go. And\r\nslavery is endured and the new virtue of Washington is made to tamper\r\nwith the evil one, in order that a show of loyalty may be preserved\r\nin one or two States which after all are not truly loyal!\" That is\r\nthe accusation made against the government by the abolitionists; and\r\nthat made by us on the other side is the reverse. I believe that\r\nMr. Lincoln had no alternative but to fight, and that he was right\r\nalso not to fight with abolition as his battle-cry. That he may be\r\nforced by his own friends into that cry, is, I fear, still possible.\r\nKentucky at any rate did not secede in bulk. She still sent her\r\nsenators to Congress, and allowed herself to be reckoned among\r\nthe stars in the American firmament. But she could not escape the\r\npresence of the war. Did she remain loyal or did she secede, that was\r\nequally her fate.\r\n\r\nThe day before I entered Kentucky a battle was fought in that State,\r\nwhich gave to the northern arms their first actual victory. It was at\r\na place called Mill Spring, near Somerset, towards the south of the\r\nState. General Zollicoffer, with a Confederate army, numbering, it\r\nwas supposed, some eight thousand men, had advanced upon a smaller\r\nFederal force, commanded by General Thomas, and had been himself\r\nkilled, while his army was cut to pieces and dispersed; the cannon\r\nof the Confederates were taken, and their camp seized and destroyed.\r\nTheir rout was complete; but in this instance again the advancing\r\nparty had been beaten, as had, I believe, been the case in all the\r\nactions hitherto fought throughout the war. Here, however, had been\r\nan actual victory, and it was not surprising that in Kentucky loyal\r\nmen should rejoice greatly, and begin to hope that the Confederates\r\nwould be beaten out of the State. Unfortunately, however, General\r\nZollicoffer's army had only been an offshoot from the main rebel army\r\nin Kentucky. Buell, commanding the Federal troops at Louisville, and\r\nSydney Johnston, the Confederate General, at Bowling Green, as yet\r\nremained opposite to each other, and the work was still to be done.\r\n\r\nI visited the little towns of Lexington and Frankfort, in Kentucky.\r\nAt the former I found in the hotel to which I went seventy-five\r\nteamsters belonging to the army. They were hanging about the great\r\nhall when I entered, and clustering round the stove in the middle\r\nof the chamber;--a dirty, rough, quaint set of men, clothed in a\r\nwonderful variety of garbs, but not disorderly or loud. The landlord\r\napologized for their presence, alleging that other accommodation\r\ncould not be found for them in the town. He received, he said, a\r\ndollar a day for feeding them, and for supplying them with a place in\r\nwhich they could lie down. It did not pay him,--but what could he do?\r\nSuch an apology from an American landlord was in itself a surprising\r\nfact. Such high functionaries are, as a rule, men inclined to tell\r\na traveller that if he does not like the guests among whom he finds\r\nhimself, he may go elsewhere. But this landlord had as yet filled the\r\nplace for not more than two or three weeks, and was unused to the\r\ndignity of his position. While I was at supper, the seventy-five\r\nteamsters were summoned into the common eating-room by a loud gong,\r\nand sat down to their meal at the public table. They were very dirty;\r\nI doubt whether I ever saw dirtier men; but they were orderly and\r\nwell-behaved, and but for their extreme dirt might have passed as the\r\nordinary occupants of a well-filled hotel in the West. Such men, in\r\nthe States, are less clumsy with their knives and forks, less astray\r\nin an unused position, more intelligent in adapting themselves to a\r\nnew life than are Englishmen of the same rank. It is always the same\r\nstory. With us there is no level of society. Men stand on a long\r\nstaircase, but the crowd congregates near the bottom, and the lower\r\nsteps are very broad. In America men stand upon a common platform,\r\nbut the platform is raised above the ground, though it does not\r\napproach in height the top of our staircase. If we take the average\r\naltitude in the two countries, we shall find that the American heads\r\nare the more elevated of the two. I conceived rather an affection for\r\nthose dirty teamsters; they answered me civilly when I spoke to them,\r\nand sat in quietness, smoking their pipes, with a dull and dirty, but\r\norderly demeanour.\r\n\r\nThe country about Lexington is called the Blue Grass Region, and\r\nboasts itself as of peculiar fecundity in the matter of pasturage.\r\nWhy the grass is called blue, and or in what way or at what period\r\nit becomes blue, I did not learn; but the country is very lovely and\r\nvery fertile. Between Lexington and Frankfort a large stock farm,\r\nextending over three thousand acres, is kept by a gentleman, who\r\nis very well known as a breeder of horses, cattle, and sheep. He\r\nhas spent much money on it, and is making for himself a Kentucky\r\nelysium. He was kind enough to entertain me for a while, and showed\r\nme something of country life in Kentucky. A farm in that part of the\r\nState depends, and must depend, chiefly on slave-labour. The slaves\r\nare a material part of the estate, and as they are regarded by the\r\nlaw as real property--being actually adstricti glebæ--an inheritor\r\nof land has no alternative but to keep them. A gentleman in Kentucky\r\ndoes not sell his slaves. To do so is considered to be low and\r\nmean, and is opposed to the aristocratic traditions of the country.\r\nA man who does so willingly, puts himself beyond the pale of\r\ngood-fellowship with his neighbours. A sale of slaves is regarded\r\nas a sign almost of bankruptcy. If a man cannot pay his debts, his\r\ncreditors can step in and sell his slaves; but he does not himself\r\nmake the sale. When a man owns more slaves than he needs, he hires\r\nthem out by the year; and when he requires more than he owns, he\r\ntakes them on hire by the year. Care is taken in such hirings not to\r\nremove a married man away from his home. The price paid for a negro's\r\nlabour at the time of my visit was about a hundred dollars, or twenty\r\npounds, for the year; but this price was then extremely low in\r\nconsequence of the war disturbances. The usual price had been about\r\nfifty or sixty per cent. above this. The man who takes the negro on\r\nhire feeds him, clothes him, provides him with a bed, and supplies\r\nhim with medical attendance. I went into some of their cottages on\r\nthe estate which I visited, and was not in the least surprised to\r\nfind them preferable in size, furniture, and all material comforts\r\nto the dwellings of most of our own agricultural labourers. Any\r\ncomparison between the material comfort of a Kentucky slave and an\r\nEnglish ditcher and delver would be preposterous. The Kentucky slave\r\nnever wants for clothing fitted to the weather. He eats meat twice\r\na day, and has three good meals; he knows no limit but his own\r\nappetite; his work is light; he has many varieties of amusement;\r\nhe has instant medical assistance at all periods of necessity for\r\nhimself, his wife, and his children. Of course he pays no rent, fears\r\nno baker, and knows no hunger. I would not have it supposed that\r\nI conceive slavery with all these comforts to be equal to freedom\r\nwithout them; nor do I conceive that the negro can be made equal to\r\nthe white man. But in discussing the condition of the negro, it is\r\nnecessary that we should understand what are the advantages of which\r\nabolition would deprive him, and in what condition he has been placed\r\nby the daily receipt of such advantages. If a negro slave wants new\r\nshoes, he asks for them, and receives them, with the undoubting\r\nsimplicity of a child. Such a state of things has its picturesquely\r\npatriarchal side; but what would be the state of such a man if he\r\nwere emancipated to-morrow?\r\n\r\nThe natural beauty of the place which I was visiting was very great.\r\nThe trees were fine and well-scattered over the large, park-like\r\npastures, and the ground was broken on every side into hills. There\r\nwas perhaps too much timber, but my friend seemed to think that that\r\nfault would find a natural remedy only too quickly. \"I do not like to\r\ncut down trees if I can help it,\" he said. After that I need not say\r\nthat my host was quite as much an Englishman as an American. To the\r\npurely American farmer a tree is simply an enemy to be trodden under\r\nfoot, and buried underground, or reduced to ashes and thrown to the\r\nwinds with what most economical despatch may be possible. If water\r\nhad been added to the landscape here it would have been perfect,\r\nregarding it as ordinary English park-scenery. But the little rivers\r\nat this place have a dirty trick of burying themselves under the\r\nground. They go down suddenly into holes, disappearing from the upper\r\nair, and then come up again at the distance of perhaps half a mile.\r\nUnfortunately their periods of seclusion are more prolonged than\r\nthose of their upper-air distance. There were three or four such\r\nascents and descents about the place.\r\n\r\nMy host was a breeder of race-horses, and had imported sires from\r\nEngland; of sheep also, and had imported famous rams; of cattle too,\r\nand was great in bulls. He was very loud in praise of Kentucky and\r\nits attractions, if only this war could be brought to an end. But I\r\ncould not obtain from him an assurance that the speculation in which\r\nhe was engaged had been profitable. Ornamental farming in England\r\nis a very pretty amusement for a wealthy man, but I fancy,--without\r\nintending any slight on Mr. Mechi,--that the amusement is expensive.\r\nI believe that the same thing may be said of it in a slave State.\r\n\r\nFrankfort is the capital of Kentucky, and is as quietly dull a little\r\ntown as I ever entered. It is on the river Kentucky, and as the\r\ngrounds about it on every side rise in wooded hills, it is a very\r\npretty place. In January it was very pretty, but in summer it must\r\nbe lovely. I was taken up to the cemetery there by a path along the\r\nriver, and am inclined to say that it is the sweetest resting-place\r\nfor the dead that I have ever visited. Daniel Boone lies there.\r\nHe was the first white man who settled in Kentucky; or rather,\r\nperhaps, the first who entered Kentucky with a view to a white man's\r\nsettlement. Such frontier men as was Daniel Boone never remained long\r\ncontented with the spots they opened. As soon as he had left his mark\r\nin that territory he went again further west over the big rivers into\r\nMissouri, and there he died. But the men of Kentucky are proud of\r\nDaniel Boone, and so they have buried him in the loveliest spot they\r\ncould select, immediately over the river. Frankfort is worth a visit,\r\nif only that this grave and graveyard may be seen. The legislature of\r\nthe State was not sitting when I was there, and the grass was growing\r\nin the streets.\r\n\r\nLouisville is the commercial city of the State, and stands on the\r\nOhio. It is another great town, like all the others, built with high\r\nstores, and great houses and stone-faced blocks. I have no doubt that\r\nall the building speculations have been failures, and that the men\r\nengaged in them were all ruined. But there, as the result of their\r\nlabour, stands a fair great city on the southern banks of the Ohio.\r\nHere General Buell held his head-quarters, but his army lay at a\r\ndistance. On my return from the West I visited one of the camps of\r\nthis army, and will speak of it as I speak of my backward journey. I\r\nhad already at this time begun to conceive an opinion that the armies\r\nin Kentucky and in Missouri would do at any rate as much for the\r\nnorthern cause as that of the Potomac, of which so much more had been\r\nheard in England.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Louisville the Ohio was flooded. It had begun to rise\r\nwhen I was at Cincinnati, and since then had gone on increasing\r\nhourly, rising inch by inch up into the towns upon its bank. I\r\nvisited two suburbs of Louisville, both of which were submerged, as\r\nto the streets and ground-floors of the houses. At Shipping Port,\r\none of these suburbs, I saw the women and children clustering in the\r\nup-stairs room, while the men were going about in punts and wherries,\r\ncollecting drift wood from the river for their winter's firing. In\r\nsome places bedding and furniture had been brought over to the high\r\nground, and the women were sitting, guarding their little property.\r\nThat village, amidst the waters, was a sad sight to see; but I heard\r\nno complaints. There was no tearing of hair and no gnashing of teeth;\r\nno bitter tears or moans of sorrow. The men who were not at work\r\nin the boats stood loafing about in clusters, looking at the still\r\nrising river; but each seemed to be personally indifferent to the\r\nmatter. When the house of an American is carried down the river, he\r\nbuilds himself another;--as he would get himself a new coat when his\r\nold coat became unserviceable. But he never laments or moans for such\r\na loss. Surely there is no other people so passive under personal\r\nmisfortune!\r\n\r\nGoing from Louisville up to St. Louis, I crossed the Ohio river and\r\npassed through parts of Indiana and of Illinois, and striking the\r\nMississippi opposite St. Louis, crossed that river also, and then\r\nentered the State of Missouri. The Ohio was, as I have said, flooded,\r\nand we went over it at night. The boat had been moored at some\r\nunaccustomed place. There was no light. The road was deep in mud up\r\nto the axle-tree, and was crowded with waggons and carts, which in\r\nthe darkness of the night seemed to have stuck there. But the man\r\ndrove his four horses through it all, and into the ferry-boat, over\r\nits side. There were three or four such omnibuses, and as many\r\nwaggons, as to each of which I predicted in my own mind some fatal\r\ncatastrophe. But they were all driven on to the boat in the dark,\r\nthe horses mixing in through each other in a chaos which would have\r\naltogether incapacitated any English coachman. And then the vessel\r\nlaboured across the flood, going sideways, and hardly keeping her\r\nown against the stream. But we did get over, and were all driven\r\nout again, up to the railway station in safety. On reaching the\r\nMississippi about the middle of the next day, we found it frozen\r\nover, or rather covered from side to side with blocks of ice which\r\nhad forced its way down the river, so that the steam ferry could not\r\nreach its proper landing. I do not think that we in England would\r\nhave attempted the feat of carrying over horses and carriages under\r\nstress of such circumstances. But it was done here. Huge plankings\r\nwere laid down over the ice, and omnibuses and waggons were driven\r\non. In getting out again, these vehicles, each with four horses, had\r\nto be twisted about, and driven in and across the vessel, and turned\r\nin spaces to look at which would have broken the heart of an English\r\ncoachman. And then with a spring they were driven up a bank as steep\r\nas a ladder! Ah me! under what mistaken illusions have I not laboured\r\nall the days of my youth, in supposing that no man could drive four\r\nhorses well but an English stage-coachman? I have seen performances\r\nin America,--and in Italy and France also, but above all in\r\nAmerica,--which would have made the hair of any English professional\r\ndriver stand on end.\r\n\r\nAnd in this way I entered St. Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMissouri is a slave State lying to the west of the Mississippi and to\r\nthe north of Arkansas. It forms a portion of the territory ceded by\r\nFrance to the United States in 1803. Indeed, it is difficult to say\r\nhow large a portion of the continent of North America is supposed to\r\nbe included in that territory. It contains the States of Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, Missouri, and Kansas, as also the present Indian territory;\r\nbut it also is said to have contained all the land lying back from\r\nthem to the Rocky Mountains, Utah, Nebraska, and Dacotah, and forms\r\nno doubt the widest dominion ever ceded by one nationality to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nMissouri lies exactly north of the old Missouri compromise line,\r\nthat is, 36 30 north. When the Missouri compromise was made it was\r\narranged that Missouri should be a slave State, but that no other\r\nState north of the 36 30 line should ever become slave soil. Kentucky\r\nand Virginia, as also of course Maryland and Delaware, four of the\r\nold slave States, were already north of that line; but the compromise\r\nwas intended to prevent the advance of slavery in the north-west. The\r\ncompromise has been since annulled, on the ground, I believe, that\r\nCongress had not constitutionally the power to declare that any soil\r\nshould be free, or that any should be slave soil. That is a question\r\nto be decided by the States themselves, as each individual State may\r\nplease. So the compromise was repealed. But slavery has not on that\r\naccount advanced. The battle has been fought in Kansas, and after a\r\nlong and terrible struggle, Kansas has come out of the fight as a\r\nfree State. Kansas is in the same parallel of latitude as Virginia,\r\nand stretches west as far as the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen the census of the population of Missouri was taken in 1860, the\r\nslaves amounted to 10 per cent. of the whole number. In the Gulf\r\nStates the slave population is about 45 per cent. of the whole. In\r\nthe three border States of Kentucky, Virginia, and Maryland, the\r\nslaves amount to 30 per cent. of the whole population. From these\r\nfigures it will be seen that Missouri, which is comparatively a new\r\nslave State, has not gone a-head with slavery as the old slave States\r\nhave done, although from its position and climate, lying as far south\r\nas Virginia, it might seem to have had the same reasons for doing so.\r\nI think there is every reason to believe that slavery will die out in\r\nMissouri. The institution is not popular with the people generally;\r\nand as white labour becomes abundant,--and before the war it was\r\nbecoming abundant,--men recognize the fact that the white man's\r\nlabour is the more profitable. The heat in this State, in midsummer,\r\nis very great, especially in the valleys of the rivers. At St. Louis,\r\non the Mississippi, it reaches commonly to 90 degrees, and very\r\nfrequently goes above that. The nights moreover are nearly as hot as\r\nthe days; but this great heat does not last for any very long period,\r\nand it seems that white men are able to work throughout the year. If\r\ncorrespondingly severe weather in winter affords any compensation to\r\nthe white man for what of heat he endures during the summer, I can\r\ntestify that such compensation is to be found in Missouri. When I was\r\nthere we were afflicted with a combination of snow, sleet, frost, and\r\nwind, with a mixture of ice and mud, that makes me regard Missouri as\r\nthe most inclement land into which I ever penetrated.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, on the Mississippi, is the great town of Missouri, and is\r\nconsidered by the Missourians to be the star of the West. It is not\r\nto be beaten in population, wealth, or natural advantages by any\r\nother city so far west; but it has not increased with such rapidity\r\nas Chicago, which is considerably to the north of it on Lake\r\nMichigan. Of the great western cities I regard Chicago as the most\r\nremarkable, seeing that St. Louis was a large town before Chicago had\r\nbeen founded.\r\n\r\nThe population of St. Louis is 170,000. Of this number only 2000 are\r\nslaves. I was told that a large proportion of the slaves of Missouri\r\nare employed near the Missouri river in breaking hemp. The growth of\r\nhemp is very profitably carried on in that valley, and the labour\r\nattached to it is one which white men do not like to encounter.\r\nSlaves are not generally employed in St. Louis for domestic service,\r\nas is done almost universally in the towns of Kentucky. This work\r\nis chiefly in the hands of Irish and Germans. Considerably above\r\none-third of the population of the whole city is made up of these two\r\nnationalities. So much is confessed; but if I were to form an opinion\r\nfrom the language I heard in the streets of the town, I should say\r\nthat nearly every man was either an Irishman or a German.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis has none of the aspects of a slave city. I cannot say that\r\nI found it an attractive place, but then I did not visit it at an\r\nattractive time. The war had disturbed everything, given a special\r\ncolour of its own to men's thoughts and words, and destroyed all\r\ninterest except that which might proceed from itself. The town is\r\nwell built, with good shops, straight streets, never-ending rows of\r\nexcellent houses, and every sign of commercial wealth and domestic\r\ncomfort,--of commercial wealth and domestic comfort in the past, for\r\nthere was no present appearance either of comfort or of wealth. The\r\nnew hotel here was to be bigger than all the hotels of all other\r\ntowns. It is built, and is an enormous pile, and would be handsome\r\nbut for a terribly ambitious Grecian doorway. It is built, as far\r\nas the walls and roof are concerned, but in all other respects is\r\nunfinished. I was told that the shares of the original stockholders\r\nwere now worth nothing. A shareholder, who so told me, seemed to\r\nregard this as the ordinary course of business.\r\n\r\nThe great glory of the town is the \"levée,\" as it is called, or the\r\nlong river beach up to which the steamers are brought with their bows\r\nto the shore. It is an esplanade looking on to the river, not built\r\nwith quays or wharves, as would be the case with us, but with a\r\nsloping bank running down to the water. In the good days of peace a\r\nhundred vessels were to be seen here, each with its double funnels.\r\nThe line of them seemed to be never ending even when I was there, but\r\nthen a very large proportion of them were lying idle. They resemble\r\nhuge wooden houses, apparently of frail architecture, floating upon\r\nthe water. Each has its double row of balconies running round it, and\r\nthe lower or ground floor is open throughout. The upper stories are\r\npropped and supported on ugly sticks and ricketty-looking beams; so\r\nthat the first appearance does not convey any great idea of security\r\nto a stranger. They are always painted white and the paint is\r\nalways very dirty. When they begin to move, they moan and groan in\r\nmelancholy tones which are subversive of all comfort; and as they\r\ncontinue on their courses they puff and bluster, and are for ever\r\nthreatening to burst and shatter themselves to pieces. There they lie\r\nin a continuous line nearly a mile in length along the levée of St.\r\nLouis, dirty, dingy, and now, alas, mute. They have ceased to groan\r\nand puff, and if this war be continued for six months longer, will\r\nbecome rotten and useless as they lie.\r\n\r\nThey boast at St. Louis that they command 46,000 miles of navigable\r\nriver water, counting the great rivers up and down from that place.\r\nThese rivers are chiefly the Mississippi, the Missouri and Ohio which\r\nfall into the Mississippi near St. Louis, the Platte and Kansas\r\nrivers--tributaries of the Missouri, the Illinois, and the Wisconsin.\r\nAll these are open to steamers, and all of them traverse regions rich\r\nin corn, in coal, in metals, or in timber. These ready-made highways\r\nof the world centre, as it were, at St. Louis, and make it the depôt\r\nof the carrying trade of all that vast country. Minnesota is 1500\r\nmiles above New Orleans, but the wheat of Minnesota can be brought\r\ndown the whole distance without change of the vessel in which it is\r\nfirst deposited. It would seem to be impossible that a country so\r\nblessed should not become rich. It must be remembered that these\r\nrivers flow through lands that have never yet been surpassed in\r\nnatural fertility. Of all countries in the world one would say that\r\nthe States of America should have been the last to curse themselves\r\nwith a war; but now the curse has fallen upon them with a double\r\nvengeance. It would seem that they could never be great in war: their\r\nvery institutions forbid it; their enormous distances forbid it; the\r\nprice of labour forbids it; and it is forbidden also by the career of\r\nindustry and expansion which has been given to them. But the curse of\r\nfighting has come upon them, and they are showing themselves to be\r\nas eager in the works of war as they have shown themselves capable\r\nin the works of peace. Men and angels must weep as they behold the\r\nthings that are being done, as they watch the ruin that has come and\r\nis still coming, as they look on commerce killed and agriculture\r\nsuspended. No sight so sad has come upon the earth in our days.\r\nThey were a great people; feeding the world, adding daily to the\r\nmechanical appliances of mankind, increasing in population beyond all\r\nmeasures of such increase hitherto known, and extending education\r\nas fast as they extended their numbers. Poverty had as yet found no\r\nplace among them, and hunger was an evil of which they had read, but\r\nwere themselves ignorant. Each man among their crowds had a right\r\nto be proud of his manhood. To read and write,--I am speaking here\r\nof the North,--was as common as to eat and drink. To work was no\r\ndisgrace, and the wages of work were plentiful. To live without work\r\nwas the lot of none. What blessing above these blessings was needed\r\nto make a people great and happy? And now a stranger visiting them\r\nwould declare that they are wallowing in a very slough of despond.\r\nThe only trade open is the trade of war. The axe of the woodsman is\r\nat rest; the plough is idle; the artificer has closed his shop. The\r\nroar of the foundry is still heard because cannon are needed, and\r\nthe river of molten iron comes out as an implement of death. The\r\nstone-cutter's hammer and the mason's trowel are never heard. The\r\ngold of the country is hiding itself as though it had returned to its\r\nmother-earth, and the infancy of a paper currency has been commenced.\r\nSick soldiers, who have never seen a battlefield, are dying by\r\nhundreds in the squalid dirt of their unaccustomed camps. Men and\r\nwomen talk of war, and of war only. Newspapers full of the war\r\nare alone read. A contract for war stores,--too often a dishonest\r\ncontract,--is the one path open for commercial enterprise. The\r\nyoung man must go to the war or he is disgraced. The war swallows\r\neverything, and as yet has failed to produce even such bitter fruits\r\nas victory or glory. Must it not be said that a curse has fallen upon\r\nthe land?\r\n\r\nAnd yet I still hope that it may ultimately be for good. Through\r\nwater and fire must a nation be cleansed of its faults. It has been\r\nso with all nations, though the phases of their trials have been\r\ndifferent. It did not seem to be well with us in Cromwell's early\r\ndays; nor was it well with us afterwards in those disgraceful years\r\nof the later Stuarts. We know how France was bathed in blood in her\r\neffort to rid herself of her painted sepulchre of an ancient throne;\r\nhow Germany was made desolate, in order that Prussia might become a\r\nnation. Ireland was poor and wretched, till her famine came. Men said\r\nit was a curse, but that curse has been her greatest blessing. And so\r\nwill it be here in the West. I could not but weep in spirit as I saw\r\nthe wretchedness around me,--the squalid misery of the soldiers, the\r\ninefficiency of their officers, the bickerings of their rulers, the\r\nnoise and threats, the dirt and ruin, the terrible dishonesty of\r\nthose who were trusted! These are things which made a man wish that\r\nhe were anywhere but there. But I do believe that God is still over\r\nall, and that everything is working for good. These things are the\r\nfire and water through which this nation must pass. The course of\r\nthis people had been too straight, and their ways had been too\r\npleasant. That which to others had been ever difficult had been made\r\neasy for them. Bread and meat had come to them as things of course,\r\nand they hardly remembered to be thankful. \"We ourselves have done\r\nit,\" they declared aloud. \"We are not as other men. We are gods upon\r\nthe earth. Whose arm shall be long enough to stay us, or whose bolt\r\nshall be strong enough to strike us?\"\r\n\r\nNow they are stricken sore, and the bolt is from their own bow. Their\r\nown hands have raised the barrier that has stayed them. They have\r\nstumbled in their running, and are lying hurt upon the ground; while\r\nthey who have heard their boastings turn upon them with ridicule, and\r\nlaugh at them in their discomforture. They are rolling in the mire,\r\nand cannot take the hand of any man to help them. Though the hand\r\nof the bystander may be stretched to them, his face is scornful and\r\nhis voice full of reproaches. Who has not known that hour of misery\r\nwhen in the sullenness of the heart all help has been refused, and\r\nmisfortune has been made welcome to do her worst? So is it now with\r\nthose once United States. The man who can see without inward tears\r\nthe self-inflicted wounds of that American people can hardly have\r\nwithin his bosom the tenderness of an Englishman's heart.\r\n\r\nBut the strong runner will rise again to his feet, even though he\r\nbe stunned by his fall. He will rise again, and will have learned\r\nsomething by his sorrow. His anger will pass away, and he will again\r\nbrace himself for his work. What great race has ever been won by any\r\nman, or by any nation, without some such fall during its course? Have\r\nwe not all declared that some check to that career was necessary?\r\nMen in their pursuit of intelligence had forgotten to be honest; in\r\nstruggling for greatness they had discarded purity. The nation has\r\nbeen great, but the statesmen of the nation have been little. Men\r\nhave hardly been ambitious to govern, but they have coveted the wages\r\nof governors. Corruption has crept into high places,--into places\r\nthat should have been high,--till of all holes and corners in the\r\nland they have become the lowest. No public man has been trusted for\r\nordinary honesty. It is not by foreign voices, by English newspapers\r\nor in French pamphlets, that the corruption of American politicians\r\nhas been exposed, but by American voices and by the American press.\r\nIt is to be heard on every side. Ministers of the cabinet, senators,\r\nrepresentatives, State legislatures, officers of the army, officials\r\nof the navy, contractors of every grade,--all who are presumed to\r\ntouch, or to have the power of touching public money, are thus\r\naccused. For years it has been so. The word politician has stunk\r\nin men's nostrils. When I first visited New York, some three years\r\nsince, I was warned not to know a man, because he was a \"politician.\"\r\nWe in England define a man of a certain class as a black-leg. How has\r\nit come about that in American ears the word politician has come to\r\nbear a similar signification?\r\n\r\nThe material growth of the States has been so quick, that the\r\npolitical growth has not been able to keep pace with it. In commerce,\r\nin education, in all municipal arrangements, in mechanical skill, and\r\nalso in professional ability, the country has stalked on with amazing\r\nrapidity; but in the art of governing, in all political management\r\nand detail, it has made no advance. The merchants of our country and\r\nof that country have for many years met on terms of perfect equality,\r\nbut it has never been so with their statesmen and our statesmen, with\r\ntheir diplomatists and our diplomatists. Lombard Street and Wall\r\nStreet can do business with each other on equal footing, but it is\r\nnot so between Downing Street and the State-office at Washington. The\r\nscience of statesmanship has yet to be learned in the States,--and\r\ncertainly the highest lesson of that science, which teaches that\r\nhonesty is the best policy.\r\n\r\nI trust that the war will have left such a lesson behind it. If it\r\ndo so, let the cost in money be what it may, that money will not\r\nhave been wasted. If the American people can learn the necessity\r\nof employing their best men for their highest work,--if they\r\ncan recognize these honest men and trust them when they are so\r\nrecognized,--then they may become as great in politics as they have\r\nbecome great in commerce and in social institutions.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, and indeed the whole State of Missouri, was at the time of\r\nmy visit under martial law. General Halleck was in command, holding\r\nhis head-quarters at St. Louis, and carrying out, at any rate as\r\nfar as the city was concerned, what orders he chose to issue. I\r\nam disposed to think that, situated as Missouri then was, martial\r\nlaw was the best law. No other law could have had force in a town\r\nsurrounded by soldiers, and in which half of the inhabitants were\r\nloyal to the existing Government, and half of them were in favour of\r\nrebellion. The necessity for such power is terrible, and the power\r\nitself in the hands of one man must be full of danger; but even that\r\nis better than anarchy. I will not accuse General Halleck of abusing\r\nhis power, seeing that it is hard to determine what is the abuse of\r\nsuch power and what its proper use. When we were at St. Louis a tax\r\nwas being gathered of £100 a head from certain men presumed to be\r\nsecessionists, and as the money was not of course very readily paid,\r\nthe furniture of these suspected secessionists was being sold by\r\nauction. No doubt such a measure was by them regarded as a great\r\nabuse. One gentleman informed me that, in addition to this, certain\r\nhouses of his had been taken by the Government at a fixed rent, and\r\nthat the payment of the rent was now refused unless he would take\r\nthe oath of allegiance. He no doubt thought that an abuse of power!\r\nBut the worst abuse of such power comes not at first, but with long\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nUp to the time however at which I was at St. Louis, martial law had\r\nchiefly been used in closing grog-shops and administering the oath of\r\nallegiance to suspected secessionists. Something also had been done\r\nin the way of raising money by selling the property of convicted\r\nsecessionists; and while I was there eight men were condemned to be\r\nshot for destroying railway bridges. \"But will they be shot?\" I asked\r\nof one of the officers. \"Oh, yes. It will be done quietly, and no one\r\nwill know anything about it. We shall get used to that kind of thing\r\npresently.\" And the inhabitants of Missouri were becoming used to\r\nmartial law. It is surprising how quickly a people can reconcile\r\nthemselves to altered circumstances, when the change comes upon them\r\nwithout the necessity of any expressed opinion on their own part.\r\nPersonal freedom has been considered as necessary to the American\r\nof the States as the air he breathes. Had any suggestion been made\r\nto him of a suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus, of a\r\ncensorship of the press, or of martial law, the American would\r\nhave declared his willingness to die on the floor of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and have proclaimed with ten million voices his\r\ninability to live under circumstances so subversive of his rights as\r\na man. And he would have thoroughly believed the truth of his own\r\nassertions. Had a chance been given of an argument on the matter, of\r\nstump speeches, and caucus meetings, these things could never have\r\nbeen done. But as it is, Americans are, I think, rather proud of the\r\nsuspension of the habeas corpus. They point with gratification to the\r\nuniformly loyal tone of the newspapers, remarking that any editor who\r\nshould dare to give even a secession squeak, would immediately find\r\nhimself shut up. And now nothing but good is spoken of martial law. I\r\nthought it a nuisance when I was prevented by soldiers from trotting\r\nmy horse down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, but I was assured\r\nby Americans that such restrictions were very serviceable in a\r\ncommunity. At St. Louis martial law was quite popular. Why should not\r\nGeneral Halleck be as well able to say what was good for the people\r\nas any law or any lawyer? He had no interest in the injury of the\r\nState, but every interest in its preservation. \"But what,\" I asked,\r\n\"would be the effect were he to tell you to put out all your fires\r\nat eight o'clock?\" \"If he were so to order, we should do it; but we\r\nknow that he will not.\" But who does know to what General Halleck or\r\nother generals may come; or how soon a curfew-bell may be ringing in\r\nAmerican towns? The winning of liberty is long and tedious, but the\r\nlosing it is a downhill easy journey.\r\n\r\nIt was here, in St. Louis, that General Fremont had held his military\r\ncourt. He was a great man here during those hundred days through\r\nwhich his command lasted. He lived in a great house, had a bodyguard,\r\nwas inaccessible as a great man should be, and fared sumptuously\r\nevery day. He fortified the city,--or rather, he began to do so.\r\nHe constructed barracks here, and instituted military prisons. The\r\nfortifications have been discontinued as useless, but the barracks\r\nand the prisons remain. In the latter there were 1200 secessionist\r\nsoldiers who had been taken in the State of Missouri. \"Why are they\r\nnot exchanged?\" I asked. \"Because they are not exactly soldiers,\"\r\nI was informed. \"The secessionists do not acknowledge them.\" \"Then\r\nwould it not be cheaper to let them go?\" \"No,\" said my informant;\r\n\"because in that case we should have to catch them again.\" And so the\r\n1200 remain in their wretched prison,--thinned from week to week and\r\nfrom day to day by prison disease and prison death.\r\n\r\nI went out twice to Benton barracks, as the camp of wooden huts was\r\ncalled, which General Fremont had erected near the fair-ground of the\r\ncity. This fair-ground, I was told, had been a pleasant place. It had\r\nbeen constructed for the recreation of the city, and for the purpose\r\nof periodical agricultural exhibitions. There is still in it a pretty\r\nornamented cottage, and in the little garden a solitary Cupid stood\r\ndismayed by the dirt and ruin around him. In the fair-green are the\r\nround buildings intended for show cattle and agricultural implements,\r\nbut now given up to cavalry horses and Parrott guns. But Benton\r\nbarracks are outside the fair-green. Here on an open space, some\r\nhalf-mile in length, two long rows of wooden sheds have been built,\r\nopposite to each other, and behind them are other sheds used for\r\nstabling and cooking-places. Those in front are divided, not into\r\nseparate huts, but into chambers capable of containing nearly two\r\nhundred men each. They were surrounded on the inside by great wooden\r\ntrays, in three tiers,--and on each tray four men were supposed to\r\nsleep. I went into one or two while the crowd of soldiers was in\r\nthem, but found it inexpedient to stay there long. The stench of\r\nthose places was foul beyond description. Never in my life before had\r\nI been in a place so horrid to the eyes and nose as Benton barracks.\r\nThe path along the front outside was deep in mud. The whole space\r\nbetween the two rows of sheds was one field of mud, so slippery that\r\nthe foot could not stand. Inside and outside every spot was deep\r\nin mud. The soldiers were mud-stained from foot to sole. These\r\nvolunteer soldiers are in their nature dirty, as must be all men\r\nbrought together in numerous bodies without special appliances for\r\ncleanliness, or control and discipline as to their personal habits.\r\nBut the dirt of the men in the Benton barracks surpassed any dirt\r\nthat I had hitherto seen. Nor could it have been otherwise with them.\r\nThey were surrounded by a sea of mud, and the foul hovels in which\r\nthey were made to sleep and live were fetid with stench and reeking\r\nwith filth. I had at this time been joined by another Englishman,\r\nand we went through this place together. When we inquired as to the\r\nhealth of the men, we heard the saddest tales,--of three hundred men\r\ngone out of one regiment, of whole companies that had perished, of\r\nhospitals crowded with fevered patients. Measles had been the great\r\nscourge of the soldiers here,--as it had also been in the army of the\r\nPotomac. I shall not soon forget my visits to Benton barracks. It may\r\nbe that our own soldiers were as badly treated in the Crimea; or that\r\nFrench soldiers were treated worse on their march into Russia. It\r\nmay be that dirt, and wretchedness, disease and listless idleness,\r\na descent from manhood to habits lower than those of the beasts,\r\nare necessary in warfare. I have sometimes thought that it is so;\r\nbut I am no military critic and will not say. This I say,--that the\r\ndegradation of men to the state in which I saw the American soldiers\r\nin Benton barracks, is disgraceful to humanity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck was at this time commanding in Missouri, and was\r\nhimself stationed at St. Louis; but his active measures against the\r\nrebels were going on to the right and to the left. On the left shore\r\nof the Mississippi, at Cairo, in Illinois, a fleet of gun-boats was\r\nbeing prepared to go down the river, and on the right an army was\r\nadvancing against Springfield, in the south-western district of\r\nMissouri, with the object of dislodging Price, the rebel guerilla\r\nleader there, and, if possible, of catching him. Price had been the\r\nopponent of poor General Lyon who was killed at Wilson's Creek, near\r\nSpringfield, and of General Fremont, who during his hundred days\r\nhad failed to drive him out of the State. This duty had now been\r\nintrusted to General Curtis, who had for some time been holding his\r\nhead-quarters at Rolla, halfway between St. Louis and Springfield.\r\nFremont had built a fort at Rolla, and it had become a military\r\nstation. Over 10,000 men had been there at one time, and now General\r\nCurtis was to advance from Rolla against Price with something\r\nabove that number of men. Many of them, however, had already gone\r\non, and others were daily being sent up from St. Louis. Under\r\nthese circumstances my friend and I, fortified with a letter of\r\nintroduction to General Curtis, resolved to go and see the army at\r\nRolla.\r\n\r\nOn our way down by the railway we encountered a young German officer,\r\nan aide-de-camp of the Federals, and under his auspices we saw Rolla\r\nto advantage. Our companions in the railway were chiefly soldiers\r\nand teamsters. The car was crowded and filled with tobacco smoke,\r\napple peel, and foul air. In these cars during the winter there\r\nis always a large lighted stove, a stove that might cook all the\r\ndinners for a French hotel, and no window is ever opened. Among our\r\nfellow-travellers there was here and there a west-country Missouri\r\nfarmer going down, under the protection of the advancing army,\r\nto look after the remains of his chattels,--wild, dark, uncouth,\r\nsavage-looking men. One such hero I specially remember, as to whom\r\nthe only natural remark would be that one would not like to meet him\r\nalone on a dark night. He was burly and big, unwashed and rough,\r\nwith a black beard, shorn some two months since. He had sharp, angry\r\neyes, and sat silent, picking his teeth with a bowie knife. I met him\r\nafterwards at the Rolla hotel, and found that he was a gentleman of\r\nproperty near Springfield. He was mild and meek as a sucking dove,\r\nasked my advice as to the state of his affairs, and merely guessed\r\nthat things had been pretty rough with him. Things had been pretty\r\nrough with him. The rebels had come upon his land. House, fences,\r\nstock, and crop were all gone. His homestead had been made a ruin,\r\nand his farm had been turned into a wilderness. Everything was gone.\r\nHe had carried his wife and children off to Illinois, and had now\r\nreturned, hoping that he might get on in the wake of the army till\r\nhe could see the debris of his property. But even he did not seem\r\ndisturbed. He did not bemoan himself or curse his fate. \"Things were\r\npretty rough,\" he said; and that was all that he did say.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when we got into Rolla. Everything had been covered with\r\nsnow, and everywhere the snow was frozen. We had heard that there\r\nwas an hotel, and that possibly we might get a bedroom there. We\r\nwere first taken to a wooden building, which we were told was the\r\nhead-quarters of the army, and in one room we found a colonel with\r\na lot of soldiers loafing about, and in another a provost-marshal\r\nattended by a newspaper correspondent. We were received with open\r\narms, and a suggestion was at once made that we were no doubt\r\npicking up news for European newspapers. \"Air you a son of the Mrs.\r\nTrollope?\" said the correspondent. \"Then, sir, you are an accession\r\nto Rolla.\" Upon which I was made to sit down, and invited to \"loaf\r\nabout\" at the head-quarters as long as I might remain at Rolla.\r\nShortly, however, there came on a violent discussion about waggons.\r\nA general had come in and wanted all the colonel's waggons, but the\r\ncolonel swore that he had none, declared how bitterly he was impeded\r\nwith sick men, and became indignant and reproachful. It was Brutus\r\nand Cassius again; and as we felt ourselves in the way, and anxious\r\nmoreover to ascertain what might be the nature of the Rolla hotel, we\r\ntook up our heavy portmanteaux--for they were heavy--and with a guide\r\nto show us the way, started off through the dark and over the hill up\r\nto our inn. I shall never forget that walk. It was up hill and down\r\nhill, with an occasional half-frozen stream across it. My friend\r\nwas impeded with an enormous cloak lined with fur, which in itself\r\nwas a burden for a coalheaver. Our guide, who was a clerk out of\r\nthe colonel's office, carried an umbrella and a small dressing-bag,\r\nbut we ourselves manfully shouldered our portmanteaux. Sydney Smith\r\ndeclared that an Englishman only wasted his time in training himself\r\nfor gymnastic aptitudes, seeing that for a shilling he could always\r\nhire a porter. Had Sydney Smith ever been at Rolla he would have\r\nwritten differently. I could tell at great length how I fell on my\r\nface in the icy snow, how my friend stuck in the frozen mud when\r\nhe essayed to jump the stream, and how our guide walked on easily\r\nin advance, encouraging us with his voice from a distance. Why is\r\nit that a stout Englishman bordering on fifty finds himself in\r\nsuch a predicament as that? No Frenchman, no Italian, no German,\r\nwould so place himself, unless under the stress of insurmountable\r\ncircumstances. No American would do so under any circumstances. As I\r\nslipped about on the ice and groaned with that terrible fardle on my\r\nback, burdened with a dozen shirts, and a suit of dress clothes, and\r\nthree pair of boots, and four or five thick volumes, and a set of\r\nmaps, and a box of cigars, and a washing-tub, I confessed to myself\r\nthat I was a fool. What was I doing in such a galley as that? Why had\r\nI brought all that useless lumber down to Rolla? Why had I come to\r\nRolla, with no certain hope even of shelter for a night? But we did\r\nreach the hotel; we did get a room between us with two bedsteads.\r\nAnd, pondering over the matter in my mind, since that evening, I have\r\nbeen inclined to think that the stout Englishman is in the right of\r\nit. No American of my age and weight will ever go through what I went\r\nthrough then; but I am not sure that he does not in his accustomed\r\ncareer go through worse things even than that. However, if I go to\r\nRolla again during the war, I will at any rate leave the books behind\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWhat a night we spent in that inn! They who know America will be\r\naware that in all hotels there is a free admixture of different\r\nclasses. The traveller in Europe may sit down to dinner with his\r\ntailor and shoemaker; but if so, his tailor and shoemaker have\r\ndressed themselves as he dresses, and are prepared to carry\r\nthemselves according to a certain standard, which in exterior does\r\nnot differ from his own. In the large Eastern cities of the States,\r\nsuch as Boston, New York, and Washington, a similar practice of life\r\nis gradually becoming prevalent. There are various hotels for various\r\nclasses, and the ordinary traveller does not find himself at the same\r\ntable with a butcher fresh from the shambles. But in the West there\r\nare no distinctions whatever. \"A man's a man for a' that\" in the\r\nWest, let the \"a' that\" comprise what it may of coarse attire and\r\nunsophisticated manners. One soon gets used to it. In that inn\r\nat Rolla was a public room, heated in the middle by a stove, and\r\nround that we soon found ourselves seated in a company of soldiers,\r\nfarmers, labourers, and teamsters. But there was among them a\r\ngeneral;--not a fighting, or would-be fighting general of the present\r\ntime, but one of the old-fashioned local generals,--men who held,\r\nor had once held, some fabulous generalship in the State militia.\r\nThere we sat, cheek by jowl with our new friends, till nearly twelve\r\no'clock, talking politics and discussing the war. The General was\r\na stanch Unionist, having, according to his own showing, suffered\r\ndreadful things from secessionist persecutors since the rebellion\r\ncommenced. As a matter of course everybody present was for the Union.\r\nIn such a place one rarely encounters any difference of opinion.\r\nThe General was very eager about the war, advocating the immediate\r\nabolition of slavery, not as a means of improving the condition\r\nof the southern slaves, but on the ground that it would ruin the\r\nsouthern masters. We all sat by, edging in a word now and then, but\r\nthe General was the talker of the evening. He was very wrathy, and\r\nswore at every other word. \"It was pretty well time,\" he said, \"to\r\ncrush out this rebellion, and by ---- it must and should be crushed\r\nout; General Jim Lane was the man to do it, and by ---- General Jim\r\nLane would do it!\" and so on. In all such conversations the time for\r\naction has always just come, and also the expected man. But the time\r\npasses by as other weeks and months have passed before it, and the\r\nnew General is found to be no more successful than his brethren. Our\r\nfriend was very angry against England. \"When we've polished off these\r\naccursed rebels, I guess we'll take a turn at you. You had your turn\r\nwhen you made us give up Mason and Slidell, and we'll have our turn\r\nby-and-by.\" But in spite of his dislike to our nation he invited us\r\nwarmly to come and see him at his home on the Missouri river. It\r\nwas, according to his showing, a new Eden,--a Paradise upon earth.\r\nHe seemed to think that we might perhaps desire to buy a location,\r\nand explained to us how readily we could make our fortunes. But he\r\nadmitted in the course of his eulogiums that it would be as much as\r\nhis life was worth for him to ride out five miles from his own house.\r\nIn the meantime the teamsters greased their boots, the soldiers\r\nsnored, those who were wet took off their shoes and stockings,\r\nhanging them to dry round the stove, and the western farmers chewed\r\ntobacco in silence and ruminated. At such a house all the guests go\r\nin to their meals together. A gong is sounded on a sudden, close\r\nbehind your ears; accustomed as you may probably be to the sound you\r\njump up from your chair in the agony of the crash, and by the time\r\nthat you have collected your thoughts the whole crowd is off in a\r\ngeneral stampede into the eating room. You may as well join them; if\r\nyou hesitate as to feeding with so rough a lot of men, you will have\r\nto sit down afterwards with the women and children of the family, and\r\nyour lot will then be worse. Among such classes in the western States\r\nthe men are always better than the women. The men are dirty and\r\ncivil, the women are dirty and uncivil.\r\n\r\nOn the following day we visited the camp, going out in an ambulance\r\nand returning on horseback. We were accompanied by the General's\r\naide-de-camp, and also, to our great gratification, by the General's\r\ndaughter. There had been a hard frost for some nights, but though\r\nthe cold was very great there was always heat enough in the middle\r\nof the day to turn the surface of the ground into glutinous mud;\r\nconsequently we had all the roughness induced by frost, but none of\r\nthe usually attendant cleanliness. Indeed, it seemed that in these\r\nparts nothing was so dirty as frost. The mud stuck like paste and\r\nencompassed everything. We heard that morning that from sixty to\r\nseventy baggage-waggons had \"broken through,\" as they called it, and\r\nstuck fast near a river in their endeavour to make their way on to\r\nLebanon. We encountered two generals of brigade, General Siegel, a\r\nGerman, and General Ashboth, an Hungarian, both of whom were waiting\r\ntill the weather should allow them to advance. They were extremely\r\ncourteous, and warmly invited us to go on with them to Lebanon and\r\nSpringfield, promising to us such accommodation as they might be able\r\nto obtain for themselves. I was much tempted to accept the offer; but\r\nI found that day after day might pass before any forward movement\r\nwas commenced, and that it might be weeks before Springfield or even\r\nLebanon could be reached. It was my wish, moreover, to see what I\r\ncould of the people, rather than to scrutinize the ways of the army.\r\nWe dined at the tent of General Ashboth, and afterwards rode his\r\nhorses through the camp back to Rolla. I was greatly taken with this\r\nHungarian gentleman. He was a tall, thin, gaunt man of fifty, a\r\npure-blooded Magyar as I was told, who had come from his own country\r\nwith Kossuth to America. His camp circumstances were not very\r\nluxurious, nor was his table very richly spread; but he received us\r\nwith the ease and courtesy of a gentleman. He showed us his sword,\r\nhis rifle, his pistols, his chargers, and daguerreotype of a friend\r\nhe had loved in his own country. They were all the treasures that he\r\ncarried with him,--over and above a chess-board and a set of chessmen\r\nwhich sorely tempted me to accompany him in his march.\r\n\r\nIn my next chapter, which will, I trust, be very short, I purport to\r\nsay a few words as to what I saw of the American army, and therefore\r\nI will not now describe the regiments which we visited. The tents\r\nwere all encompassed by snow, and the ground on which they stood was\r\na bed of mud; but yet the soldiers out here were not so wretchedly\r\nforlorn, or apparently so miserably uncomfortable, as those at Benton\r\nbarracks. I did not encounter that horrid sickly stench, nor were\r\nthe men so pale and wobegone. On the following day we returned to St.\r\nLouis, bringing back with us our friend the German aide-de-camp. I\r\nstayed two days longer in that city, and then I thought that I had\r\nseen enough of Missouri;--enough of Missouri at any rate under the\r\npresent circumstances of frost and secession. As regards the people\r\nof the West, I must say that they were not such as I expected to\r\nfind them. With the Northerns we are all more or less intimately\r\nacquainted. Those Americans whom we meet in our own country, or on\r\nthe Continent, are generally from the North, or if not so they have\r\nthat type of American manners which has become familiar to us. They\r\nare talkative, intelligent, inclined to be social, though frequently\r\nnot sympathetically social with ourselves; somewhat _soi-disant_,\r\nbut almost invariably companionable. As the traveller goes southward\r\ninto Maryland and Washington, the type is not altered to any great\r\nextent. The hard intelligence of the Yankee gives place gradually\r\nto the softer, and perhaps more polished manner of the Southern. But\r\nthe change thus experienced is not so great as is that between the\r\nAmerican of the western and the American of the Atlantic States.\r\nIn the West I found the men gloomy and silent,--I might almost say\r\nsullen. A dozen of them will sit for hours round a stove, speechless.\r\nThey chew tobacco and ruminate. They are not offended if you speak to\r\nthem, but they are not pleased. They answer with monosyllables, or,\r\nif it be practicable, with a gesture of the head. They care nothing\r\nfor the graces,--or shall I say, for the decencies of life? They are\r\nessentially a dirty people. Dirt, untidiness, and noise, seem in\r\nnowise to afflict them. Things are constantly done before your eyes,\r\nwhich should be done and might be done behind your back. No doubt we\r\ndaily come into the closest contact with matters which, if we saw\r\nall that appertains to them, would cause us to shake and shudder. In\r\nother countries we do not see all this, but in the western States we\r\ndo. I have eaten in Bedouin tents, and have been ministered to by\r\nTurks and Arabs. I have sojourned in the hotels of old Spain and of\r\nSpanish America. I have lived in Connaught, and have taken up my\r\nquarters with monks of different nations. I have, as it were, been\r\neducated to dirt, and taken out my degree in outward abominations.\r\nBut my education had not reached a point which would enable me to\r\nlive at my ease in the western States. A man or woman who can do that\r\nmay be said to have graduated in the highest honours, and to have\r\nbecome absolutely invulnerable, either through the sense of touch,\r\nor by the eye, or by the nose. Indifference to appearances is there\r\na matter of pride. A foul shirt is a flag of triumph. A craving for\r\nsoap and water is as the wail of the weak and the confession of\r\ncowardice. This indifference is carried into all their affairs, or\r\nrather this manifestation of indifference. A few pages back, I spoke\r\nof a man whose furniture had been sold to pay a heavy tax raised\r\non him specially as a secessionist; the same man had also been\r\nrefused the payment of rent due to him by the Government, unless he\r\nwould take a false oath. I may presume that he was ruined in his\r\ncircumstances by the strong hand of the northern army. But he seemed\r\nin nowise to be unhappy about his ruin. He spoke with some scorn of\r\nthe martial law in Missouri, but I felt that it was esteemed a small\r\nmatter by him that his furniture was seized and sold. No men love\r\nmoney with more eager love than these western men, but they bear\r\nthe loss of it as an Indian bears his torture at the stake. They\r\nare energetic in trade, speculating deeply whenever speculation is\r\npossible; but nevertheless they are slow in motion, loving to loaf\r\nabout. They are slow in speech, preferring to sit in silence, with\r\nthe tobacco between their teeth. They drink, but are seldom drunk\r\nto the eye; they begin at it early in the morning, and take it in a\r\nsolemn, sullen, ugly manner, standing always at a bar; swallowing\r\ntheir spirits, and saying nothing as they swallow it. They drink\r\noften, and to great excess; but they carry it off without noise,\r\nsitting down and ruminating over it with the everlasting cud within\r\ntheir jaws. I believe that a stranger might go into the West, and\r\npassing from hotel to hotel through a dozen of them, might sit\r\nfor hours at each in the large everlasting public hall, and never\r\nhave a word addressed to him. No stranger should travel in the\r\nwestern States, or indeed in any of the States, without letters of\r\nintroduction. It is the custom of the country, and they are easily\r\nprocured. Without them everything is barren; for men do not travel in\r\nthe States of America as they do in Europe, to see scenery and visit\r\nthe marvels of old cities which are open to all the world. The social\r\nand political life of the Americans must constitute the interest\r\nof the traveller, and to these he can hardly make his way without\r\nintroductions.\r\n\r\nI cannot part with the West without saying in its favour that there\r\nis a certain manliness about its men, which gives them a dignity\r\nof their own. It is shown in that very indifference of which I\r\nhave spoken. Whatever turns up the man is still there,--still\r\nunsophisticated and still unbroken. It has seemed to me that no\r\nrace of men requires less outward assistance than these pioneers of\r\ncivilization. They rarely amuse themselves. Food, newspapers, and\r\nbrandy-smashes suffice for life; and while these last, whatever\r\nmay occur, the man is still there in his manhood. The fury of the\r\nmob does not shake him, nor the stern countenance of his present\r\nmartial tyrant. Alas! I cannot stick to my text by calling him a\r\njust man. Intelligence, energy, and endurance are his virtues. Dirt,\r\ndishonesty, and morning drinks are his vices.\r\n\r\nAll native American women are intelligent. It seems to be their\r\nbirthright. In the eastern cities they have, in their upper classes,\r\nsuperadded womanly grace to this intelligence, and consequently\r\nthey are charming as companions. They are beautiful also, and, as\r\nI believe, lack nothing that a lover can desire in his love. But I\r\ncannot fancy myself much in love with a western lady, or rather with\r\na lady in the West. They are as sharp as nails, but then they are\r\nalso as hard. They know, doubtless, all that they ought to know, but\r\nthen they know so much more than they ought to know. They are tyrants\r\nto their parents, and never practise the virtue of obedience till\r\nthey have half-grown-up daughters of their own. They have faith in\r\nthe destiny of their country, if in nothing else; but they believe\r\nthat that destiny is to be worked out by the spirit and talent of the\r\nyoung women. I confess that for me Eve would have had no charms had\r\nshe not recognized Adam as her lord. I can forgive her in that she\r\ntempted him to eat the apple. Had she come from the West country she\r\nwould have ordered him to make his meal, and then I could not have\r\nforgiven her.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis should be, and still will be, a town of great wealth. To no\r\ncity can have been given more means of riches. I have spoken of the\r\nenormous mileage of water-communication of which she is the centre.\r\nThe country around her produces Indian corn, wheat, grasses, hemp,\r\nand tobacco. Coal is dug even within the boundaries of the city, and\r\niron-mines are worked at a distance from it of a hundred miles. The\r\niron is so pure, that it is broken off in solid blocks, almost free\r\nfrom alloy; and as the metal stands up on the earth's surface in the\r\nguise almost of a gigantic metal pillar, instead of lying low within\r\nits bowels, it is worked at a cheap rate, and with great certainty.\r\nNevertheless, at the present moment, the iron-works of Pilot Knob, as\r\nthe place is called, do not pay. As far as I could learn, nothing did\r\npay, except government contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCAIRO AND CAMP WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whatever period of life my days may be prolonged, I do not think\r\nthat I shall ever forget Cairo. I do not mean Grand Cairo, which is\r\nalso memorable in its way, and a place not to be forgotten,--but\r\nCairo in the State of Illinois, which by native Americans is always\r\ncalled Caaro. An idea is prevalent in the States, and I think I have\r\nheard the same broached in England, that a popular British author had\r\nCairo, State of Illinois, in his eye when under the name of Eden he\r\ndepicted a chosen, happy spot on the Mississippi river, and told us\r\nhow certain English emigrants fixed themselves in that locality, and\r\nthere made light of those little ills of life which are incident to\r\nhumanity even in the garden of the valley of the Mississippi. But I\r\ndoubt whether that author ever visited Cairo in mid-winter, and I\r\nam sure that he never visited Cairo when Cairo was the seat of an\r\nAmerican army. Had he done so, his love of truth would have forbidden\r\nhim to presume that even Mark Tapley could have enjoyed himself in\r\nsuch an Eden.\r\n\r\nI had no wish myself to go to Cairo, having heard it but\r\nindifferently spoken of by all men; but my friend with whom I was\r\ntravelling was peremptory in the matter. He had heard of gun-boats\r\nand mortar-boats, of forts built upon the river, of Columbiads,\r\nDahlgrens, and Parrotts, of all the pomps and circumstance of\r\nglorious war, and entertained an idea that Cairo was the nucleus or\r\npivot of all really strategetic movements in this terrible national\r\nstruggle. Under such circumstances I was as it were forced to go to\r\nCairo, and bore myself, under the circumstances, as much like Mark\r\nTapley as my nature would permit. I was not jolly while I was there\r\ncertainly, but I did not absolutely break down and perish in its mud.\r\n\r\nCairo is the southern terminus of the Illinois central railway. There\r\nis but one daily arrival there, namely, at half-past four in the\r\nmorning, and but one despatch, which is at half-past three in the\r\nmorning. Everything is thus done to assist that view of life which\r\nMark Tapley took when he resolved to ascertain under what possible\r\nworst circumstances of existence he could still maintain his jovial\r\ncharacter. Why anybody should ever arrive at Cairo at half-past four\r\nA.M., I cannot understand. The departure at any hour is easy of\r\ncomprehension. The place is situated exactly at the point at which\r\nthe Ohio and the Mississippi meet, and is, I should say, merely\r\nguessing on the matter, some ten or twelve feet lower than the\r\nwinter level of the two rivers. This gives it naturally a depressed\r\nappearance, which must have much aided Mark Tapley in his endeavours.\r\nWho were the founders of Cairo I have never ascertained. They are\r\nprobably buried fathoms deep in the mud, and their names will no\r\ndoubt remain a mystery to the latest ages. They were brought thither,\r\nI presume, by the apparent water privileges of the place; but the\r\nwater privileges have been too much for them, and by the excess of\r\ntheir powers have succeeded in drowning all the capital of the early\r\nCairovians, and in throwing a wet blanket of thick, moist, glutinous\r\ndirt over all their energies.\r\n\r\nThe free State of Illinois runs down far south between the slave\r\nStates of Kentucky to the east, and of Missouri to the west, and is\r\nthe most southern point of the continuous free-soil territory of the\r\nNorthern States. This point of it is a part of a district called\r\nEgypt, which is as fertile as the old country from whence it has\r\nborrowed a name; but it suffers under those afflictions which are\r\ncommon to all newly-settled lands which owe their fertility to the\r\nvicinity of great rivers. Fever and ague universally prevail. Men and\r\nwomen grow up with their lantern faces like spectres. The children\r\nare prematurely old; and the earth which is so fruitful is hideous in\r\nits fertility. Cairo and its immediate neighbourhood must, I suppose,\r\nhave been subject to yearly inundation before it was \"settled up.\"\r\nAt present it is guarded on the shores of each river by high mud\r\nbanks, built so as to protect the point of land. These are called\r\nthe levees, and do perform their duty by keeping out the body of the\r\nwaters. The shore between the banks is, I believe, never above breast\r\ndeep with the inundation; and from the circumstances of the place,\r\nand the soft, half-liquid nature of the soil, this inundation\r\ngenerally takes the shape of mud instead of water.\r\n\r\nHere, at the very point, has been built a town. Whether the town\r\nexisted during Mr. Tapley's time I have not been able to learn. At\r\nthe period of my visit, it was falling quickly into ruin; indeed I\r\nthink I may pronounce it to have been on its last legs. At that\r\nmoment a galvanic motion had been pumped into it by the war movements\r\nof General Halleck, but the true bearings of the town, as a town,\r\nwere not less plainly to be read on that account. Every street was\r\nabsolutely impassable from mud. I mean that in walking down the\r\nmiddle of any street in Cairo a moderately framed man would soon\r\nstick fast and not be able to move. The houses are generally built\r\nat considerable intervals and rarely face each other, and along one\r\nside of each street a plank boarding was laid, on which the mud had\r\naccumulated only up to one's ankles. I walked all over Cairo with\r\nbig boots, and with my trousers tucked up to my knees; but at the\r\ncrossings I found considerable danger, and occasionally had my doubts\r\nas to the possibility of progress. I was alone in my work, and saw\r\nno one else making any such attempt. A few only were moving about,\r\nand they moved in wretched carts, each drawn by two miserable,\r\nfloundering horses. These carts were always empty, but were presumed\r\nto be engaged in some way on military service. No faces looked out\r\nat the windows of the houses, no forms stood in the doorways. A few\r\nshops were open, but only in the drinking shops did I see customers.\r\nIn these silent, muddy men were sitting,--not with drink before them,\r\nas men sit with us,--but with the cud within their jaws, ruminating.\r\nTheir drinking is always done on foot. They stand silent at a bar,\r\nwith two small glasses before them. Out of one they swallow the\r\nwhisky, and from the other they take a gulp of water, as though to\r\nrinse their mouths. After that, they again sit down and ruminate. It\r\nwas thus that men enjoyed themselves at Cairo.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell what was the existing population of Cairo. I asked one\r\nresident; but he only shook his head and said that the place was\r\nabout \"played out.\" And a miserable play it must have been. I tried\r\nto walk round the point on the levees, but I found that the mud\r\nwas so deep and slippery on that which protected the town from the\r\nMississippi, that I could not move on it. On the other, which forms\r\nthe bank of the Ohio, the railway runs, and here was gathered all\r\nthe life and movement of the place. But the life was galvanic in its\r\nnature, created by a war-galvanism of which the shocks were almost\r\nneutralized by mud.\r\n\r\nAs Cairo is of all towns in America the most desolate, so is its\r\nhotel the most forlorn and wretched. Not that it lacked custom. It\r\nwas so full that no room was to be had on our first entry from the\r\nrailway cars at five A.M., and we were reduced to the necessity of\r\nwashing our hands and faces in the public wash-room. When I entered\r\nit the barber and his assistants were asleep there, and four or five\r\ncitizens from the railway were busy at the basins. There is a fixed\r\nresolution in these places that you shall be drenched with dirt and\r\ndrowned in abominations, which is overpowering to a mind less strong\r\nthan Mark Tapley's. The filth is paraded and made to go as far as\r\npossible. The stranger is spared none of the elements of nastiness.\r\nI remember how an old woman once stood over me in my youth, forcing\r\nme to swallow the gritty dregs of her terrible medicine-cup. The\r\ntreatment I received in the hotel at Cairo reminded me of that old\r\nwoman. In that room I did not dare to brush my teeth lest I should\r\ngive offence; and I saw at once that I was regarded with suspicion\r\nwhen I used my own comb instead of that provided for the public.\r\n\r\nAt length we got a room, one room for the two. I had become\r\nso depressed in spirits that I did not dare to object to this\r\narrangement. My friend could not complain much, even to me, feeling\r\nthat these miseries had been produced by his own obstinacy. \"It is a\r\nnew phase of life,\" he said. That, at any rate, was true. If nothing\r\nmore be necessary for pleasurable excitement than a new phase of\r\nlife, I would recommend all who require pleasurable excitement to\r\ngo to Cairo. They will certainly find a new phase of life. But do\r\nnot let them remain too long, or they may find something beyond a\r\nnew phase of life. Within a week of that time my friend was taking\r\nquinine, looking hollow about the eyes, and whispering to me of fever\r\nand ague. To say that there was nothing eatable or drinkable in\r\nthat hotel, would be to tell that which will be understood without\r\ntelling. My friend, however, was a cautious man, carrying with him\r\ncomfortable tin pots, hermetically sealed, from Fortnum & Mason's;\r\nand on the second day of our sojourn we were invited by two officers\r\nto join their dinner at a Cairo eating-house. We ploughed our way\r\ngallantly through the mud to a little shanty, at the door of which we\r\nwere peremptorily demanded by the landlord to scrub ourselves before\r\nwe entered with the stump of an old broom. This we did, producing on\r\nour nether persons the appearance of bread which has been carefully\r\nspread with treacle by an economic housekeeper. And the proprietor\r\nwas right, for had we not done so, the treacle would have run off\r\nthrough the whole house. But after this we fared royally. Squirrel\r\nsoup and prairie chickens regaled us. One of our new friends had\r\nladen his pockets with champagne and brandy; the other with glasses\r\nand a corkscrew; and as the bottle went round, I began to feel\r\nsomething of the spirit of Mark Tapley in my soul.\r\n\r\nBut our visit to Cairo had been made rather with reference to its\r\npresent warlike character, than with any eye to the natural beauties\r\nof the place. A large force of men had been collected there, and also\r\na fleet of gun-boats. We had come there fortified with letters to\r\ngenerals and commodores, and were prepared to go through a large\r\namount of military inspection. But the bird had flown before our\r\narrival; or rather the body and wings of the bird, leaving behind\r\nonly a draggled tail and a few of its feathers. There were only a\r\nthousand soldiers at Cairo when we were there;--that is, a thousand\r\nstationed in the Cairo sheds. Two regiments passed through the place\r\nduring the time, getting out of one steamer on to another, or passing\r\nfrom the railway into boats. One of these regiments passed before me\r\ndown the slope of the river-bank, and the men as a body seemed to\r\nbe healthy. Very many were drunk, and all were mud-clogged up to\r\ntheir shoulders and very caps. In other respects they appeared to\r\nbe in good order. It must be understood that these soldiers, the\r\nvolunteers, had never been made subject to any discipline as to\r\ncleanliness. They wore their hair long. Their hats or caps, though\r\nall made in some military form and with some military appendance,\r\nwere various and ill-assorted. They all were covered with loose,\r\nthick, blue-gray great-coats, which no doubt were warm and wholesome,\r\nbut which from their looseness and colour seemed to be peculiarly\r\nsusceptible of receiving and showing a very large amount of mud.\r\nTheir boots were always good; but each man was shod as he liked.\r\nMany wore heavy over-boots coming up the leg;--boots of excellent\r\nmanufacture, and from their cost, if for no other reason, quite out\r\nof the reach of an English soldier; boots in which a man would be\r\nnot at all unfortunate to find himself hunting; but from these, or\r\nfrom their high-lows, shoes, or whatever they might wear, the mud\r\nhad never been even scraped. These men were all warmly clothed, but\r\nclothed apparently with an endeavour to contract as much mud as might\r\nbe possible.\r\n\r\nThe generals and commodores were gone up the Ohio river and up the\r\nTennessee in an expedition with gun-boats, which turned out to be\r\nsuccessful, and of which we have all read in the daily history of\r\nthis war. They had departed the day before our arrival, and though\r\nwe still found at Cairo a squadron of gun-boats,--if gun-boats go in\r\nsquadrons,--the bulk of the army had been moved. There was left there\r\none regiment and one colonel, who kindly described to us the battles\r\nhe had fought, and gave us permission to see everything that was to\r\nbe seen. Four of these gun-boats were still lying in the Ohio, close\r\nunder the terminus of the railway with their flat, ugly noses against\r\nthe muddy bank, and we were shown over two of them. They certainly\r\nseemed to be formidable weapons for river warfare, and to have been\r\n\"got up quite irrespective of expense.\" So much, indeed, may be said\r\nfor the Americans throughout the war. They cannot be accused of\r\nparsimony. The largest of these vessels, called the \"Benton,\" had\r\ncost £36,000. These boats are made with sides sloping inwards, at an\r\nangle of 45 degrees. The iron is two-and-a-half inches thick, and\r\nit has not, I believe, been calculated that this will resist cannon\r\nshot of great weight, should it be struck in a direct line. But the\r\nangle of the sides of the boat makes it improbable that any such\r\nshot should strike them; and the iron, bedded as it is upon oak, is\r\nsupposed to be sufficient to turn a shot that does not hit it in a\r\ndirect line. The boats are also roofed in with iron, and the pilots\r\nwho steer the vessel stand encased, as it were, under an iron cupola.\r\nI imagine that these boats are well calculated for the river service,\r\nfor which they have been built. Six or seven of them had gone up the\r\nTennessee river the day before we reached Cairo, and while we were\r\nthere they succeeded in knocking down Fort Henry, and in carrying\r\noff the soldiers stationed there and the officer in command. One of\r\nthe boats, however, had been penetrated by a shot which made its\r\nway into the boiler, and the men on deck, six, I think, in number,\r\nwere scalded to death by the escaping steam. The two pilots up in\r\nthe cupola were destroyed in this terrible manner. As they were\r\naltogether closed in by the iron roof and sides, there was no escape\r\nfor the steam. The boats, however, were well made and very powerfully\r\narmed, and will, probably, succeed in driving the secessionist armies\r\naway from the great river banks. By what machinery the secessionist\r\narmies are to be followed into the interior is altogether another\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut there was also another fleet at Cairo, and we were informed that\r\nwe were just in time to see the first essay made at testing the\r\nutility of this armada. It consisted of no less than thirty-eight\r\nmortar-boats, each of which had cost £1700. These mortar-boats were\r\nbroad, flat-bottomed rafts, each constructed with a deck raised\r\nthree feet above the bottom. They were protected by high iron sides,\r\nsupposed to be proof against rifle balls, and when supplied had been\r\nfurnished each with a little boat, a rope, and four rough sweeps or\r\noars. They had no other furniture or belongings, and were to be moved\r\neither by steam tugs or by the use of the long oars which were sent\r\nwith them. It was intended that one 13-inch mortar, of enormous\r\nweight, should be put upon each, that these mortars should be fired\r\nwith twenty-three pounds of powder, and that the shell thrown should,\r\nat a distance of three miles, fall with absolute precision into any\r\ndevoted town which the rebels might hold on the river banks. The\r\ngrandeur of the idea is almost sublime. So large an amount of powder\r\nhad, I imagine, never then been used for the single charge in any\r\ninstrument of war; and when we were told that thirty-eight of them\r\nwere to play at once on a city, and that they could be used with\r\nabsolute precision, it seemed as though the fate of Sodom and\r\nGomorrah could not be worse than the fate of that city. Could any\r\ncity be safe when such implements of war were about upon the waters?\r\n\r\nBut when we came to inspect the mortar-boats, our misgivings as\r\nto any future destination for this fleet were relieved, and our\r\nadmiration was given to the smartness of the contractor who had\r\nsecured to himself the job of building them. In the first place they\r\nhad all leaked till the spaces between the bottoms and the decks were\r\nfilled with water. This space had been intended for ammunition, but\r\nnow seemed hardly to be fitted for that purpose. The officer who was\r\nabout to test them by putting a mortar into one and by firing it off\r\nwith twenty-three pounds of powder, had the water pumped out of a\r\nselected raft, and we were towed by a steam-tug from their moorings a\r\nmile up the river, down to the spot where the mortar lay ready to be\r\nlifted in by a derrick. But as we turned on the river, the tug-boat\r\nwhich had brought us down, was unable to hold us up against the force\r\nof the stream. A second tug-boat was at hand, and with one on each\r\nside we were just able, in half-an-hour, to recover the 100 yards\r\nwhich we had lost down the river. The pressure against the stream\r\nwas so great, owing partly to the weight of the raft, and partly to\r\nthe fact that its flat head buried itself in the water, that it was\r\nalmost immoveable against the stream, although the mortar was not yet\r\non it.\r\n\r\nIt soon became manifest that no trial could be made on that day,\r\nand so we were obliged to leave Cairo without having witnessed the\r\nfiring of the great gun. My belief is that very little evil to the\r\nenemy will result from those mortar-boats, and that they cannot be\r\nused with much effect. Since that time they have been used on the\r\nMississippi, but as yet we do not know with what result. Island\r\nNo. 10 has been taken, but I do not know that the mortar-boats\r\ncontributed much to that success. The enormous cost of moving them\r\nagainst the stream of the river is in itself a barrier to their use.\r\nWhen we saw them--and then they were quite new--many of the rivets\r\nwere already gone. The small boats had been stolen from some of them,\r\nand the ropes and oars from others. There they lay, thirty-eight in\r\nnumber, up against the mud-banks of the Ohio, under the boughs of the\r\nhalf-clad, melancholy forest trees, as sad a spectacle of reckless\r\nprodigality as the eye ever beheld. But the contractor who made them\r\nno doubt was a smart man.\r\n\r\nThis armada was moored on the Ohio against the low, reedy bank, a\r\nmile above the levee, where the old unchanged forest of nature came\r\ndown to the very edge of the river, and mixed itself with the shallow\r\noverflowing waters. I am wrong in saying that it lay under the boughs\r\nof the trees, for such trees do not spread themselves out with broad\r\nbranches. They stand thickly together, broken, stunted, spongy\r\nwith rot, straight and ugly, with ragged tops and shattered arms,\r\nseemingly decayed, but still ever renewing themselves with the\r\nrapid moist life of luxuriant forest vegetation. Nothing to my eyes\r\nis sadder than the monotonous desolation of such scenery. We, in\r\nEngland, when we read and speak of the primeval forests of America,\r\nare apt to form pictures in our minds of woodland glades, with\r\nspreading oaks and green mossy turf beneath,--of scenes than which\r\nnothing that God has given us is more charming. But these forests\r\nare not after that fashion; they offer no allurement to the lover,\r\nno solace to the melancholy man of thought. The ground is deep with\r\nmud, or overflown with water. The soil and the river have no defined\r\nmargins. Each tree, though full of the forms of life, has all the\r\nappearance of death. Even to the outward eye they seem to be laden\r\nwith ague, fever, sudden chills, and pestilential malaria.\r\n\r\nWhen we first visited the spot we were alone, and we walked across\r\nfrom the railway line to the place at which the boats were moored.\r\nThey lay in treble rank along the shore, and immediately above them\r\nan old steam-boat was fastened against the bank. Her back was broken,\r\nand she was given up to ruin,--placed there that she might rot\r\nquietly into her watery grave. It was mid-winter, and every tree\r\nwas covered with frozen sleet and small particles of snow which had\r\ndrizzled through the air; for the snow had not fallen in hearty,\r\nhonest flakes. The ground beneath our feet was crisp with frost, but\r\ntraitorous in its crispness; not frozen manfully so as to bear a\r\nman's weight, but ready at every point to let him through into the\r\nfat, glutinous mud below. I never saw a sadder picture, or one which\r\ndid more to awaken pity for those whose fate had fixed their abodes\r\nin such a locality. And yet there was a beauty about it too,--a\r\nmelancholy, death-like beauty. The disordered ruin and confused decay\r\nof the forest was all gemmed with particles of ice. The eye reaching\r\nthrough the thin underwood could form for itself picturesque shapes\r\nand solitary bowers of broken wood, which were bright with the opaque\r\nbrightness of the hoar-frost. The great river ran noiselessly along,\r\nrapid, but still with an apparent lethargy in its waters. The ground\r\nbeneath our feet was fertile beyond compare, but as yet fertile to\r\ndeath rather than to life. Where we then trod man had not yet come\r\nwith his axe and his plough; but the railroad was close to us, and\r\nwithin a mile of the spot thousands of dollars had been spent in\r\nraising a city which was to have been rich with the united wealth of\r\nthe rivers and the land. Hitherto fever and ague, mud and malaria,\r\nhad been too strong for man, and the dollars had been spent in vain.\r\nThe day, however, will come when this promontory between the two\r\ngreat rivers will be a fit abode for industry. Men will settle there,\r\nwandering down from the North and East, and toil sadly, and leave\r\ntheir bones among the mud. Thin, pale-faced, joyless mothers will\r\ncome there, and grow old before their time; and sickly children will\r\nbe born, struggling up with wan faces to their sad life's labour.\r\nBut the work will go on, for it is God's work; and the earth will be\r\nprepared for the people, and the fat rottenness of the still living\r\nforest will be made to give forth its riches.\r\n\r\nWe found that two days at Cairo were quite enough for us. We had\r\nseen the gun-boats and the mortar-boats, and gone through the sheds\r\nof the soldiers. The latter were bad, comfortless, damp, and cold;\r\nand certain quarters of the officers, into which we were hospitably\r\ntaken, were wretched abodes enough; but the sheds of Cairo did not\r\nstink like those of Benton barracks at St. Louis, nor had illness\r\nbeen prevalent there to the same degree. I do not know why this\r\nshould have been so, but such was the result of my observation. The\r\nlocality of Benton barracks must, from its nature, have been the more\r\nhealthy, but it had become by art the foulest place I ever visited.\r\nThroughout the army it seemed to be the fact, that the men under\r\ncanvas were more comfortable, in better spirits, and also in better\r\nhealth than those who were lodged in sheds. We had inspected the\r\nCairo army and the Cairo navy, and had also seen all that Cairo had\r\nto show us of its own. We were thoroughly disgusted with the hotel,\r\nand retired on the second night to bed, giving positive orders that\r\nwe might be called at half-past two, with reference to that terrible\r\nstart to be made at half-past three. As a matter of course we kept\r\ndozing and waking till past one, in our fear lest neglect on the part\r\nof the watcher should entail on us another day at this place; of\r\ncourse we went fast asleep about the time at which we should have\r\nroused ourselves; and of course we were called just fifteen minutes\r\nbefore the train started. Everybody knows how these things always go.\r\nAnd then the pair of us, jumping out of bed in that wretched chamber,\r\nwent through the mockery of washing and packing which always takes\r\nplace on such occasions;--a mockery indeed of washing, for there was\r\nbut one basin between us! And a mockery also of packing, for I left\r\nmy hair-brushes behind me! Cairo was avenged in that I had declined\r\nto avail myself of the privileges of free citizenship which had been\r\noffered to me in that barber's shop. And then, while we were in our\r\nagony, pulling at the straps of our portmanteaux and swearing at the\r\nfaithlessness of the boots, up came the clerk of the hotel--the great\r\nman from behind the bar--and scolded us prodigiously for our delay.\r\n\"Called! We had been called an hour ago!\" Which statement, however,\r\nwas decidedly untrue, as we remarked, not with extreme patience. \"We\r\nshould certainly be late,\" he said; \"it would take us five minutes to\r\nreach the train, and the cars would be off in four.\" Nobody who has\r\nnot experienced them can understand the agonies of such moments,--of\r\nsuch moments as regards travelling in general; but none who have not\r\nbeen at Cairo can understand the extreme agony produced by the threat\r\nof a prolonged sojourn in that city. At last we were out of the\r\nhouse, rushing through the mud, slush, and half-melted snow, along\r\nthe wooden track to the railway, laden with bags and coats, and\r\ndeafened by that melancholy, wailing sound, as though of a huge polar\r\nshe-bear in the pangs of travail upon an iceberg, which proceeds\r\nfrom an American railway-engine before it commences its work. How\r\nwe slipped and stumbled, and splashed and swore, rushing along in\r\nthe dark night, with buttons loose, and our clothes half on! And how\r\npitilessly we were treated! We gained our cars, and even succeeded in\r\nbringing with us our luggage; but we did not do so with the sympathy,\r\nbut amidst the derision of the bystanders. And then the seats were\r\nall full, and we found that there was a lower depth even in the\r\nterrible deep of a railway train in a western State. There was a\r\nsecond-class carriage, prepared, I presume, for those who esteemed\r\nthemselves too dirty for association with the aristocracy of Cairo;\r\nand into this we flung ourselves. Even this was a joy to us, for we\r\nwere being carried away from Eden. We had acknowledged ourselves to\r\nbe no fitting colleagues for Mark Tapley, and would have been glad\r\nto escape from Cairo even had we worked our way out of the place\r\nas assistant-stokers to the engine-driver. Poor Cairo! unfortunate\r\nCairo! \"It is about played out!\" said its citizen to me. But in truth\r\nthe play was commenced a little too soon. Those players have played\r\nout; but another set will yet have their innings, and make a score\r\nthat shall perhaps be talked of far and wide in the western world.\r\n\r\nWe were still bent upon army inspection, and with this purpose went\r\nback from Cairo to Louisville in Kentucky. I had passed through\r\nLouisville before, as told in my last chapter, but had not gone south\r\nfrom Louisville towards the Green River, and had seen nothing of\r\nGeneral Buell's soldiers. I should have mentioned before that when we\r\nwere at St. Louis, we asked General Halleck, the officer in command\r\nof the northern army of Missouri, whether he could allow us to pass\r\nthrough his lines to the South. This he assured us he was forbidden\r\nto do, at the same time offering us every facility in his power for\r\nsuch an expedition if we could obtain the consent of Mr. Seward,\r\nwho at that time had apparently succeeded in engrossing into his\r\nown hands, for the moment, supreme authority in all matters of\r\nGovernment. Before leaving Washington we had determined not to ask\r\nMr. Seward, having but little hope of obtaining his permission, and\r\nbeing unwilling to encounter his refusal. Before going to General\r\nHalleck we had considered the question of visiting the land of Dixie\r\nwithout permission from any of the men in authority. I ascertained\r\nthat this might easily have been done from Kentucky to Tennessee,\r\nbut that it could only be done on foot. There are very few available\r\nroads running North and South through these States. The railways came\r\nbefore roads; and even where the railways are far asunder, almost\r\nall the traffic of the country takes itself to them, preferring a\r\nlong circuitous conveyance with steam, to short distances without.\r\nConsequently such roads as there are run laterally to the railways,\r\nmeeting them at this point or that, and thus maintaining the\r\ncommunication of the country. Now the railways were of course in the\r\nhands of the armies. The few direct roads leading from North to South\r\nwere in the same condition, and the bye-roads were impassable from\r\nmud. The frontier of the North therefore, though very extended,\r\nwas not very easily to be passed, unless, as I have said before,\r\nby men on foot. For myself I confess that I was anxious to go\r\nSouth; but not to do so without my coats and trousers, or shirts\r\nand pocket-handkerchiefs. The readiest way of getting across the\r\nline,--and the way which was I believe the most frequently used,--was\r\nfrom below Baltimore in Maryland by boat across the Potomac. But in\r\nthis there was a considerable danger of being taken, and I had no\r\ndesire to become a state-prisoner in the hands of Mr. Seward under\r\ncircumstances which would have justified our Minister in asking for\r\nmy release only as a matter of favour. Therefore when at St. Louis,\r\nI gave up all hopes of seeing \"Dixie\" during my present stay in\r\nAmerica. I presume it to be generally known that Dixie is the negro's\r\nheaven, and that the southern slave States, in which it is presumed\r\nthat they have found a Paradise, have since the beginning of the war\r\nbeen so named.\r\n\r\nWe remained a few days at Louisville, and were greatly struck with\r\nthe natural beauty of the country around it. Indeed, as far as I was\r\nenabled to see, Kentucky has superior attractions as a place of rural\r\nresidence for an English gentleman, to any other State in the Union.\r\nThere is nothing of landscape there equal to the banks of the upper\r\nMississippi, or to some parts of the Hudson river. It has none of\r\nthe wild grandeur of the White Mountains of New Hampshire, nor does\r\nit break itself into valleys equal to those of the Alleghanies in\r\nPennsylvania. But all those are beauties for the tourist rather\r\nthan for the resident. In Kentucky the land lies in knolls and soft\r\nsloping hills. The trees stand apart, forming forest openings. The\r\nherbage is rich, and the soil, though not fertile like the prairies\r\nof Illinois, or the river bottoms of the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries, is good, steadfast, wholesome farming ground. It is a\r\nfine country for a resident gentleman farmer, and in its outward\r\naspect reminds me more of England in its rural aspects, than any\r\nother State which I visited. Round Louisville there are beautiful\r\nsites for houses, of which advantage in some instances has been\r\ntaken. But, nevertheless, Louisville though a well-built, handsome\r\ncity, is not now a thriving city. I liked it because the hotel was\r\nabove par, and because the country round it was good for walking;\r\nbut it has not advanced as Cincinnati and St. Louis have advanced.\r\nAnd yet its position on the Ohio is favourable, and it is well\r\ncircumstanced as regards the wants of its own State. But it is not\r\na free-soil city. Nor indeed is St. Louis; but St. Louis is tending\r\nthat way, and has but little to do with the \"domestic institution.\"\r\nAt the hotels in Cincinnati and St. Louis you are served by white\r\nmen, and are very badly served. At Louisville the ministration is by\r\nblack men, \"bound to labour.\" The difference in the comfort is very\r\ngreat. The white servants are noisy, dirty, forgetful, indifferent,\r\nand sometimes impudent. The negroes are the very reverse of all this;\r\nyou cannot hurry them; but in all other respects,--and perhaps even\r\nin that respect also,--they are good servants. This is the work for\r\nwhich they seem to have been intended. But nevertheless where they\r\nare, life and energy seem to languish, and prosperity cannot make any\r\ntrue advance. They are symbols of the luxury of the white men who\r\nemploy them, and as such are signs of decay and emblems of decreasing\r\npower. They are good labourers themselves, but their very presence\r\nmakes labour dishonourable. That Kentucky will speedily rid herself\r\nof the institution I believe firmly. When she has so done, the\r\ncommercial city of that State may perhaps go a-head again like her\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nAt this very time the Federal army was commencing that series of\r\nactive movements in Kentucky and through Tennessee which led to such\r\nimportant results, and gave to the North the first solid victories\r\nwhich they had gained since the contest began. On the 19th of January\r\none wing of General Buell's army, under General Thomas, had defeated\r\nthe secessionists near Somerset, in the south-eastern district of\r\nKentucky, under General Zollicoffer, who was there killed. But in\r\nthat action the attack was made by Zollicoffer and the secessionists.\r\nWhen we were at Louisville we heard of the success of that gun-boat\r\nexpedition up the Tennessee river by which Fort Henry was taken. Fort\r\nHenry had been built by the Confederates on the Tennessee,--exactly\r\non the confines of the States of Tennessee and Kentucky. They had\r\nalso another fort, Fort Donnelson, on the Cumberland river, which at\r\nthat point runs parallel to the Tennessee, and is there distant\r\nfrom it but a very few miles. Both these rivers run into the Ohio.\r\nNashville, which is the capital of Tennessee, is higher up on the\r\nCumberland; and it was now intended to send the gun-boats down the\r\nTennessee back into the Ohio, and thence up the Cumberland, there to\r\nattack Fort Donnelson, and afterwards to assist General Buell's army\r\nin making its way down to Nashville. The gun-boats were attached to\r\nGeneral Halleck's army, and received their directions from St. Louis.\r\nGeneral Buell's head-quarters were at Louisville, and his advanced\r\nposition was on the Green River, on the line of the railway from\r\nLouisville to Nashville. The secessionists had destroyed the railway\r\nbridge over the Green River, and were now lying at Bowling Green,\r\nbetween the Green River and Nashville. This place it was understood\r\nthat they had fortified.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this position when we got a military pass to go down\r\nby the railway to the army on the Green River,--for the railway was\r\nopen to no one without a military pass;--and we started, trusting\r\nthat Providence would supply us with rations and quarters. An officer\r\nattached to General Buell's staff, with whom however our acquaintance\r\nwas of the very slightest, had telegraphed down to say that we were\r\ncoming. I cannot say that I expected much from the message, seeing\r\nthat it simply amounted to a very thin introduction to a general\r\nofficer to whom we were strangers even by name, from a gentleman to\r\nwhom we had brought a note from another gentleman whose acquaintance\r\nwe had chanced to pick up on the road. We manifestly had no right to\r\nexpect much; but to us, expecting very little, very much was given.\r\nGeneral Johnson was the officer to whose care we were confided, he\r\nbeing a brigadier under General M'Cook, who commanded the advance.\r\nWe were met by an aide-de-camp and saddle-horses, and soon found\r\nourselves in the General's tent, or rather in a shanty formed of\r\nsolid upright wooden logs, driven into the ground with the bark still\r\non, and having the interstices filled in with clay. This was roofed\r\nwith canvas, and altogether made a very eligible military residence.\r\nThe General slept in a big box about nine feet long and four broad\r\nwhich occupied one end of the shanty, and he seemed in all his\r\nfixings to be as comfortably put up as any gentleman might be when\r\nout on such a picnic as this. We arrived in time for dinner, which\r\nwas brought in, table and all, by two negroes. The party was made up\r\nby a doctor, who carved, and two of the staff, and a very nice dinner\r\nwe had. In half-an-hour we were intimate with the whole party, and\r\nas familiar with the things around us as though we had been living\r\nin tents all our lives. Indeed I had by this time been so often in\r\nthe tents of the northern army, that I almost felt entitled to make\r\nmyself at home. It has seemed to me that an Englishman has always\r\nbeen made welcome in these camps. There has been and is at this\r\nmoment a terribly bitter feeling among Americans against England, and\r\nI have heard this expressed quite as loudly by men in the army as by\r\ncivilians; but I think I may say that this has never been brought to\r\nbear upon individual intercourse. Certainly we have said some very\r\nsharp things of them,--words which, whether true or false, whether\r\ndeserved or undeserved, must have been offensive to them. I have\r\nknown this feeling of offence to amount almost to an agony of anger.\r\nBut nevertheless I have never seen any falling off in the hospitality\r\nand courtesy generally shown by a civilized people to passing\r\nvisitors. I have argued the matter of England's course throughout\r\nthe war, till I have been hoarse with asseverating the rectitude of\r\nher conduct and her national unselfishness. I have met very strong\r\nopponents on the subject, and have been coerced into loud strains of\r\nvoice; but I never yet met one American who was personally uncivil\r\nto me as an Englishman, or who seemed to be made personally angry by\r\nmy remarks. I found no coldness in that hospitality to which as a\r\nstranger I was entitled, because of the national ill-feeling which\r\ncircumstances have engendered. And while on this subject I will\r\nremark, that when travelling I have found it expedient to let\r\nthose with whom I might chance to talk know at once that I was an\r\nEnglishman. In fault of such knowledge things would be said which\r\ncould not but be disagreeable to me; but not even from any rough\r\nwestern enthusiast in a railway carriage have I ever heard a word\r\nspoken insolently to England, after I had made my nationality known.\r\nI have learned that Wellington was beaten at Waterloo; that Lord\r\nPalmerston was so unpopular that he could not walk alone in the\r\nstreets; that the House of Commons was an acknowledged failure; that\r\nstarvation was the normal condition of the British people, and that\r\nthe Queen was a bloodthirsty tyrant. But these assertions were not\r\nmade with the intention that they should be heard by an Englishman.\r\nTo us as a nation they are at the present moment unjust almost beyond\r\nbelief; but I do not think that the feeling has ever taken the guise\r\nof personal discourtesy.\r\n\r\nWe spent two days in the camp close upon the Green River, and I do\r\nnot know that I enjoyed any days of my trip more thoroughly than I\r\ndid these. In truth for the last month, since I had left Washington,\r\nmy life had not been one of enjoyment. I had been rolling in mud\r\nand had been damp with filth. Camp Wood, as they called this\r\nmilitary settlement on the Green River, was also muddy; but we were\r\nexcellently well-mounted; the weather was very cold, but peculiarly\r\nfine, and the soldiers around us, as far as we could judge, seemed to\r\nbe better off in all respects than those we had visited at St. Louis,\r\nat Rolla, or at Cairo. They were all in tents, and seemed to be\r\nlight-spirited and happy. Their rations were excellent,--but so much\r\nmay, I think, be said of the whole northern army from Alexandria on\r\nthe Potomac to Springfield in the west of Missouri. There was very\r\nlittle illness at that time in the camp in Kentucky, and the reports\r\nmade to us led us to think that on the whole this had been the most\r\nhealthy division of the army. The men, moreover, were less muddy than\r\ntheir brethren either east or west of them,--at any rate this may be\r\nsaid of them as regards the infantry.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest charm of the place to me was the beauty of\r\nthe scenery. The Green River at this spot is as picturesque a stream\r\nas I ever remember to have seen in such a country. It lies low down\r\nbetween high banks, and curves hither and thither, never keeping a\r\nstraight line. Its banks are wooded; but not, as is so common in\r\nAmerica, by continuous, stunted, uninteresting forest, but by large\r\nsingle trees standing on small patches of meadow by the water-side,\r\nwith the high banks rising over them, with glades through them open\r\nfor the horseman. The rides here in summer must be very lovely. Even\r\nin winter they were so, and made me in love with the place in spite\r\nof that brown, dull, barren aspect which the presence of an army\r\nalways creates. I have said that the railway bridge which crossed\r\nthe Green River at this spot had been destroyed by the secessionists.\r\nThis had been done effectually as regarded the passage of trains, but\r\nonly in part as regarded the absolute fabric of the bridge. It had\r\nbeen, and still was when I saw it, a beautifully light construction,\r\nmade of iron and supported over a valley, rather than over a river,\r\non tall stone piers. One of these piers had been blown up; but when\r\nwe were there, the bridge had been repaired with beams and wooden\r\nshafts. This had just been completed, and an engine had passed over\r\nit. I must confess that it looked to me most perilously insecure; but\r\nthe eye uneducated in such mysteries is a bad judge of engineering\r\nwork. I passed with a horse backwards and forwards on it, and it did\r\nnot tumble down then; but I confess that on the first attempt I was\r\nglad enough to lead the horse by the bridle.\r\n\r\nThat bridge was certainly a beautiful fabric, and built in a most\r\nlovely spot. Immediately under it there was also a pontoon bridge.\r\nThe tents of General M'Cook's division were immediately at the\r\nnorthern end of it, and the whole place was alive with soldiers,\r\nnailing down planks, pulling up temporary rails at each side,\r\ncarrying over straw for the horses, and preparing for the general\r\nadvance of the troops. It was a glorious day. There had been heavy\r\nfrost at night; but the air was dry, and the sun though cold was\r\nbright. I do not know when I saw a prettier picture. It would perhaps\r\nhave been nothing without the loveliness of the river scenery; but\r\nthe winding of the stream at the spot, the sharp wooded hills on each\r\nside, the forest openings, and the busy, eager, strange life together\r\nfilled the place with no common interest. The officers of the army at\r\nthe spot spoke with bitterest condemnation of the vandalism of their\r\nenemy in destroying the bridge. The justice of the indignation, I\r\nventured very strongly to question. \"Surely you would have destroyed\r\ntheir bridge?\" I said. \"But they are rebels,\" was the answer. It has\r\nbeen so throughout the contest; and the same argument has been held\r\nby soldiers and by non-soldiers,--by women and by men. \"Grant that\r\nthey are rebels,\" I have answered. \"But when rebels fight they cannot\r\nbe expected to be more scrupulous in their mode of doing so than\r\ntheir enemies who are not rebels.\" The whole population of the North\r\nhas from the beginning of this war considered themselves entitled to\r\nall the privileges of belligerents; but have called their enemies\r\nGoths and Vandals for even claiming those privileges for themselves.\r\nThe same feeling was at the bottom of their animosity against\r\nEngland. Because the South was in rebellion, England should\r\nhave consented to allow the North to assume all the rights of\r\na belligerent, and should have denied all those rights to the\r\nSouth! Nobody has seemed to understand that any privilege which a\r\nbelligerent can claim must depend on the very fact of his being in\r\nencounter with some other party having the same privilege. Our press\r\nhas animadverted very strongly on the States government for the\r\napparent untruthfulness of their arguments on this matter; but I\r\nprofess that I believe that Mr. Seward and his colleagues,--and\r\nnot they only but the whole nation,--have so thoroughly deceived\r\nthemselves on this subject, have so talked and speechified themselves\r\ninto a misunderstanding of the matter, that they have taught\r\nthemselves to think that the men of the South could be entitled to\r\nno consideration from any quarter. To have rebelled against the\r\nstars and stripes seems to a northern man to be a crime putting the\r\ncriminal altogether out of all courts,--a crime which should have\r\narmed the hands of all men against him, as the hands of all men\r\nare armed at a dog that is mad, or a tiger that has escaped from\r\nits keeper. It is singular that such a people, a people that has\r\nfounded itself on rebellion, should have such a horror of rebellion;\r\nbut, as far as my observation may have enabled me to read their\r\nfeelings rightly, I do believe that it has been as sincere as it is\r\nirrational.\r\n\r\nWe were out riding early on the morning of the second day of our\r\nsojourn in the camp, and met the division of General Mitchell, a\r\ndetachment of General Buell's army, which had been in camp between\r\nthe Green River and Louisville, going forward to the bridge which was\r\nthen being prepared for their passage. This division consisted of\r\nabout 12,000 men, and the road was crowded throughout the whole day\r\nwith them and their waggons. We first passed a regiment of cavalry,\r\nwhich appeared to be endless. Their cavalry regiments are, in\r\ngeneral, more numerous than those of the infantry, and on this\r\noccasion we saw, I believe, about 1200 men pass by us. Their horses\r\nwere strong and serviceable, and the men were stout and in good\r\nhealth; but the general appearance of everything about them was\r\nrough and dirty. The American cavalry have always looked to me like\r\nbrigands. A party of them would, I think, make a better picture than\r\nan equal number of our dragoons; but if they are to be regarded in\r\nany other view than that of the picturesque, it does not seem to me\r\nthat they have been got up successfully. On this occasion they were\r\nforming themselves into a picture for my behoof, and as the picture\r\nwas, as a picture, very good, I at least have no reason to complain.\r\n\r\nWe were taken to see one German regiment, a regiment of which all\r\nthe privates were German and all the officers save one,--I think the\r\nsurgeon. We saw the men in their tents, and the food which they eat,\r\nand were disposed to think that hitherto things were going well with\r\nthem. In the evening the colonel and lieutenant-colonel, both of whom\r\nhad been in the Prussian service, if I remember rightly, came up to\r\nthe general's quarters, and we spent the evening together in smoking\r\ncigars and discussing slavery round the stove. I shall never forget\r\nthat night, or the vehement abolition enthusiasm of the two German\r\ncolonels. Our host had told us that he was a slave-owner; and as our\r\nwants were supplied by two sable ministers, I concluded that he had\r\nbrought with him a portion of his domestic institution. Under such\r\ncircumstances I myself should have avoided such a subject, having\r\nbeen taught to believe that southern gentlemen did not generally take\r\ndelight in open discussions on the subject. But had we been arguing\r\nthe question of the population of the planet Jupiter, or the final\r\npossibility of the transmutation of metals, the matter could not have\r\nbeen handled with less personal feeling. The Germans, however, spoke\r\nthe sentiments of all the Germans of the western States,--that is,\r\nof all the Protestant Germans, and to them is confined the political\r\ninfluence held by the German immigrants. They all regard slavery\r\nas an evil, holding on the matter opinions quite as strong as ours\r\nhave ever been. And they argue that as slavery is an evil, it should\r\ntherefore be abolished at once. Their opinions are as strong as ours\r\nhave ever been, and they have not had our West Indian experience.\r\nAny one desiring to understand the present political position of the\r\nStates should realize the fact of the present German influence on\r\npolitical questions. Many say that the present President was returned\r\nby German voters. In one sense this is true, for he certainly could\r\nnot have been returned without them; but for them, or for their\r\nassistance, Mr. Breckinridge would have been President, and this\r\ncivil war would not have come to pass. As abolitionists they are much\r\nmore powerful than the republicans of New England, and also more in\r\nearnest. In New England the matter is discussed politically; in the\r\ngreat western towns, where the Germans congregate by thousands, they\r\nprofess to view it philosophically. A man, as a man, is entitled to\r\nfreedom. That is their argument, and it is a very old one. When you\r\nask them what they would propose to do with 4,000,000 of enfranchised\r\nslaves and with their ruined masters,--how they would manage the\r\naffairs of those 12,000,000 of people, all whose wealth and work and\r\nvery life have hitherto been hinged and hung upon slavery, they again\r\nask you whether slavery is not in itself bad, and whether anything\r\nacknowledged to be bad should be allowed to remain.\r\n\r\nBut the American Germans are in earnest, and I am strongly of opinion\r\nthat they will so far have their way, that the country which for\r\nthe future will be their country, will exist without the taint of\r\nslavery. In the northern nationality, which will reform itself after\r\nthis war is over, there will, I think, be no slave State. That final\r\nbattle of abolition will have to be fought among a people apart; and\r\nI must fear that while it lasts their national prosperity will not be\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust that it may not be thought that in this chapter I am going\r\nto take upon myself the duties of a military critic. I am well aware\r\nthat I have no capacity for such a task, and that my opinion on such\r\nmatters would be worth nothing. But it is impossible to write of the\r\nAmerican States as they were when I visited them, and to leave that\r\nsubject of the American army untouched. It was all but impossible to\r\nremain for some months in the northern States without visiting the\r\narmy. It was impossible to join in any conversation in the States\r\nwithout talking about the army. It was impossible to make inquiry\r\nas to the present and future condition of the people without basing\r\nsuch inquiries more or less upon the doings of the army. If a\r\nstranger visit Manchester with the object of seeing what sort of\r\nplace Manchester is, he must visit the cotton mills and printing\r\nestablishments, though he may have no taste for cotton and no\r\nknowledge on the subject of calicoes. Under pressure of this kind\r\nI have gone about from one army to another, looking at the drilling\r\nof regiments, of the manoeuvres of cavalry, at the practice of\r\nartillery, and at the inner life of the camps. I do not feel that I\r\nam in any degree more fitted to take the command of a campaign than I\r\nwas before I began, or even more fitted to say who can and who cannot\r\ndo so. But I have obtained on my own mind's eye a tolerably clear\r\nimpression of the outward appearance of the northern army; I have\r\nendeavoured to learn something of the manner in which it was brought\r\ntogether, and of its cost as it now stands; and I have learned--as\r\nany man in the States may learn, without much trouble or personal\r\ninvestigation--how terrible has been the peculation of the\r\ncontractors and officers by whom that army has been supplied. Of\r\nthese things, writing of the States at this moment, I must say\r\nsomething. In what I shall say as to that matter of peculation\r\nI trust that I may be believed to have spoken without personal\r\nill-feeling or individual malice.\r\n\r\nWhile I was travelling in the States of New England and in the\r\nNorth-west, I came across various camps at which young regiments were\r\nbeing drilled and new regiments were being formed. These lay in our\r\nway as we made our journeys, and therefore we visited them; but they\r\nwere not objects of any very great interest. The men had not acquired\r\neven any pretence of soldierlike bearing. The officers for the most\r\npart had only just been selected, having hardly as yet left their\r\ncivil occupations, and anything like criticism was disarmed by the\r\nvery nature of the movement which had called the men together. I then\r\nthought, as I still think, that the men themselves were actuated\r\nby proper motives, and often by very high motives, in joining the\r\nregiments. No doubt they looked to the pay offered. It is not often\r\nthat men are able to devote themselves to patriotism without any\r\nreference to their personal circumstances. A man has got before him\r\nthe necessity of earning his bread, and very frequently the necessity\r\nof earning the bread of others besides himself. This comes before him\r\nnot only as his first duty, but as the very law of his existence.\r\nHis wages are his life, and when he proposes to himself to serve his\r\ncountry that subject of payment comes uppermost as it does when he\r\nproposes to serve any other master. But the wages given, though very\r\nhigh in comparison with those of any other army, have not been of\r\na nature to draw together from their distant homes at so short a\r\nnotice, so vast a cloud of men, had no other influence been at work.\r\nAs far as I can learn, the average rate of wages in the country since\r\nthe war began has been about 65 cents a day over and beyond the\r\nworkmen's diet. I feel convinced that I am putting this somewhat too\r\nlow, taking the average of all the markets from which the labour has\r\nbeen withdrawn. In large cities labour has been higher than this,\r\nand a considerable proportion of the army has been taken from large\r\ncities. But taking 65 cents a day as the average, labour has been\r\nworth about 17 dollars a month over and above the labourers' diet. In\r\nthe army the soldier receives 13 dollars a month, and also receives\r\nhis diet and clothes; in addition to this, in many States, 6 dollars\r\na month have been paid by the State to the wives and families of\r\nthose soldiers who have left wives and families in the States behind\r\nthem. Thus for the married men the wages given by the army have been\r\n2 dollars a month, or less than £5 a year, more than his earnings at\r\nhome, and for the unmarried man they have been 4 dollars a month, or\r\nless than £10 a year below his earnings at home. But the army also\r\ngives clothing to the extent of 3 dollars a month. This would place\r\nthe unmarried soldier, in a pecuniary point of view, worse off by one\r\ndollar a month, or £2 10_s._ a year, than he would have been at home;\r\nand would give the married man 5 dollars a month, or £12 a year more\r\nthan his ordinary wages for absenting himself from his family. I\r\ncannot think therefore that the pecuniary attractions have been very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nOur soldiers in England enlist at wages which are about one half that\r\npaid in the ordinary labour market to the class from whence they\r\ncome. But labour in England is uncertain, whereas in the States it is\r\ncertain. In England the soldier with his shilling gets better food\r\nthan the labourer with his two shillings; and the Englishman has no\r\nobjection to the rigidity of that discipline which is so distasteful\r\nto an American. Moreover, who in England ever dreamed of raising\r\n600,000 new troops in six months, out of a population of thirty\r\nmillion? But this has been done in the northern States out of a\r\npopulation of eighteen million. If England were invaded, Englishmen\r\nwould come forward in the same way, actuated, as I believe, by the\r\nsame high motives. My object here is simply to show that the American\r\nsoldiers have not been drawn together by the prospect of high wages,\r\nas has been often said since the war began.\r\n\r\nThey who inquire closely into the matter will find that hundreds and\r\nthousands have joined the army as privates, who in doing so have\r\nabandoned all their best worldly prospects, and have consented to\r\nbegin the game of life again, believing that their duty to their\r\ncountry has now required their services. The fact has been that\r\nin the different States a spirit of rivalry has been excited.\r\nIndiana has endeavoured to show that she was as forward as\r\nIllinois; Pennsylvania has been unwilling to lag behind New York;\r\nMassachusetts, who has always struggled to be foremost in peace, has\r\ndesired to boast that she was first in war also; the smaller States\r\nhave resolved to make their names heard, and those which at first\r\nwere backward in sending troops have been shamed into greater\r\nearnestness by the public voice. There has been a general feeling\r\nthroughout the people that the thing should be done;--that the\r\nrebellion must be put down, and that it must be put down by arms.\r\nYoung men have been ashamed to remain behind; and their elders,\r\nacting under that glow of patriotism which so often warms the hearts\r\nof free men, but which perhaps does not often remain there long in\r\nall its heat, have left their wives and have gone also. It may be\r\ntrue that the voice of the majority has been coercive on many;--that\r\nmen have enlisted partly because the public voice required it of\r\nthem, and not entirely through the promptings of individual spirit.\r\nSuch public voice in America is very potent; but it is not, I think,\r\ntrue that the army has been gathered together by the hope of high\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nSuch was my opinion of the men when I saw them from State to State\r\nclustering into their new regiments. They did not look like soldiers;\r\nbut I regarded them as men earnestly intent on a work which they\r\nbelieved to be right. Afterwards when I saw them in their camps,\r\namidst all the pomps and circumstances of glorious war, positively\r\nconverted into troops, armed with real rifles and doing actual\r\nmilitary service, I believed the same of them,--but cannot say that\r\nI then liked them so well. Good motives had brought them there. They\r\nwere the same men, or men of the same class that I had seen before.\r\nThey were doing just that which I knew they would have to do. But\r\nstill I found that the more I saw of them the more I lost of that\r\nrespect for them which I had once felt. I think it was their dirt\r\nthat chiefly operated upon me. Then, too, they had hitherto done\r\nnothing, and they seemed to be so terribly intent upon their rations!\r\nThe great boast of this army was that they eat meat twice a day, and\r\nthat their daily supply of bread was more than they could consume.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been two or three weeks in Washington, I went over to the\r\narmy of the Potomac and spent a few days with some of the officers.\r\nI had on previous occasions ridden about the camps, and had seen\r\na review at which General Maclellan trotted up and down the lines\r\nwith all his numerous staff at his heels. I have always believed\r\nreviews to be absurdly useless as regards the purpose for which\r\nthey are avowedly got up,--that, namely, of military inspection.\r\nAnd I believed this especially of this review. I do not believe\r\nthat any Commander-in-chief ever learns much as to the excellence\r\nor deficiencies of his troops by watching their manoeuvres on a\r\nvast open space; but I felt sure that General Maclellan had learned\r\nnothing on this occasion. If before his review he did not know\r\nwhether his men were good as soldiers, he did not possess any such\r\nknowledge after the review. If the matter may be regarded as a review\r\nof the general;--if the object was to show him off to the men, that\r\nthey might know how well he rode, and how grand he looked with his\r\nstaff of forty or fifty officers at his heels, then this review must\r\nbe considered as satisfactory. General Maclellan does ride very well.\r\nSo much I learned, and no more.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to have a pass for crossing the Potomac either\r\nfrom one side or from the other, and such a pass I procured from a\r\nfriend in the War-office, good for the whole period of my sojourn in\r\nWashington. The wording of the pass was more than ordinarily long,\r\nas it recommended me to the special courtesy of all whom I might\r\nencounter; but in this respect it was injurious to me rather than\r\notherwise, as every picket by whom I was stopped found it necessary\r\nto read it to the end. The paper was almost invariably returned to\r\nme without a word; but the musket which was not unfrequently kept\r\nextended across my horse's nose by the reader's comrade would be\r\nwithdrawn, and then I would ride on to the next barrier. It seemed\r\nto me that these passes were so numerous and were signed by so many\r\nofficers, that there could have been no risk in forging them. The\r\narmy of the Potomac into which they admitted the bearer lay in\r\nquarters which were extended over a length of twenty miles up and\r\ndown on the Virginian side of the river, and the river could be\r\ntraversed at five different places. Crowds of men and women were\r\ngoing over daily, and no doubt all the visitors who so went with\r\ninnocent purposes were provided with proper passports; but any whose\r\npurposes were not innocent, and who were not so provided, could\r\nhave passed the pickets with counterfeited orders. This, I have\r\nlittle doubt, was done daily. Washington was full of secessionists,\r\nand every movement of the Federal army was communicated to the\r\nConfederates at Richmond, at which city was now established the\r\nCongress and head-quarters of the Confederacy. But no such tidings of\r\nthe Confederate army reached those in command at Washington. There\r\nwere many circumstances in the contest which led to this result, and\r\nI do not think that General Maclellan had any power to prevent it.\r\nHis system of passes certainly did not do so.\r\n\r\nI never could learn from any one what was the true number of this\r\narmy on the Potomac. I have been informed by those who professed\r\nto know that it contained over 200,000 men, and by others who also\r\nprofessed to know, that it did not contain 100,000. To me the\r\nsoldiers seemed to be innumerable, hanging like locusts over the\r\nwhole country,--a swarm desolating everything around them. Those\r\npomps and circumstances are not glorious in my eyes. They affect me\r\nwith a melancholy which I cannot avoid. Soldiers gathered together in\r\na camp are uncouth and ugly when they are idle; and when they are at\r\nwork their work is worse than idleness. When I have seen a thousand\r\nmen together, moving their feet hither at one sound and thither at\r\nanother, throwing their muskets about awkwardly, prodding at the air\r\nwith their bayonets, trotting twenty paces here and backing ten paces\r\nthere, wheeling round in uneven lines, and looking, as they did so,\r\nmiserably conscious of the absurdity of their own performances, I\r\nhave always been inclined to think how little the world can have\r\nadvanced in civilization, while grown-up men are still forced to\r\nspend their days in such grotesque performances. Those to whom the\r\n\"pomps and circumstances\" are dear--nay, those by whom they are\r\nconsidered simply necessary--will be able to confute me by a thousand\r\narguments. I readily own myself confuted. There must be soldiers, and\r\nsoldiers must be taught. But not the less pitiful is it to see men\r\nof thirty undergoing the goose-step, and tortured by orders as to\r\nthe proper mode of handling a long instrument which is half-gun and\r\nhalf-spear. In the days of Hector and Ajax, the thing was done in a\r\nmore picturesque manner, and the songs of battle should, I think, be\r\nconfined to those ages.\r\n\r\nThe ground occupied by the divisions on the further or south-western\r\nside of the Potomac was, as I have said, about twenty miles in length\r\nand perhaps seven in breadth. Through the whole of this district the\r\nsoldiers were everywhere. The tents of the various brigades were\r\nclustered together in streets, the regiments being divided; and the\r\ndivisions, combining the brigades, lay apart at some distance from\r\neach other. But everywhere, at all points, there were some signs of\r\nmilitary life. The roads were continually thronged with waggons, and\r\ntracks were opened for horses wherever a shorter way might thus be\r\nmade available. On every side the trees were falling, or had fallen.\r\nIn some places whole woods had been felled with the express purpose\r\nof rendering the ground impracticable for troops, and firs and pines\r\nlay one over the other, still covered with their dark rough foliage,\r\nas though a mighty forest had grown there along the ground, without\r\nany power to raise itself towards the heavens. In other places the\r\ntrees had been chopped off from their trunks about a yard from the\r\nground, so that the soldier who cut it should have no trouble in\r\nstooping, and the tops had been dragged away for firewood, or for\r\nthe erection of screens against the wind. Here and there in solitary\r\nplaces there were outlying tents, looking as though each belonged to\r\nsome military recluse; and in the neighbourhood of every division was\r\nto be found a photographing-establishment upon wheels, in order that\r\nthe men might send home to their sweethearts pictures of themselves\r\nin their martial costumes.\r\n\r\nI wandered about through these camps both on foot and on horseback\r\nday after day, and every now and then I would come upon a farm-house\r\nthat was still occupied by its old inhabitants. Many of such houses\r\nhad been deserted, and were now held by the senior officers of the\r\narmy; but some of the old families remained, living in the midst of\r\nthis scene of war in a condition most forlorn. As for any tillage\r\nof their land, that under such circumstances might be pronounced as\r\nhopeless. Nor could there exist encouragement for farm-work of any\r\nkind. Fences had been taken down and burned; the ground had been\r\noverrun in every direction. The stock had of course disappeared; it\r\nhad not been stolen, but had been sold in a hurry for what under such\r\ncircumstances it might fetch. What farmer could work or have any hope\r\nfor his land in the middle of such a crowd of soldiers? But yet there\r\nwere the families. The women were in their houses, and the children\r\nplaying at their doors, and the men, with whom I sometimes spoke,\r\nwould stand around with their hands in their pockets. They knew that\r\nthey were ruined; they expected no redress. In nine cases out of ten\r\nthey were inimical in spirit to the soldiers around them. And yet it\r\nseemed that their equanimity was never disturbed. In a former chapter\r\nI have spoken of a certain general,--not a fighting general of the\r\narmy, but a local farming general,--who spoke loudly and with many\r\ncurses of the injury inflicted on him by the secessionists. With that\r\nexception, I heard no loud complaint of personal suffering. These\r\nVirginian farmers must have been deprived of everything,--of the very\r\nmeans of earning bread. They still hold by their houses, though they\r\nwere in the very thick of the war, because there they had shelter\r\nfor their families, and elsewhere they might seek it in vain. A man\r\ncannot move his wife and children if he have no place to which to\r\nmove them, even though his house be in the midst of disease, of\r\npestilence, or of battle. So it was with them then, but it seemed as\r\nthough they were already used to it.\r\n\r\nBut there was a class of inhabitants in that same country to whom\r\nfate had been even more unkind than to those whom I saw. The lines\r\nof the northern army extended perhaps seven or eight miles from the\r\nPotomac, and the lines of the Confederate army were distant some\r\nfour miles from those of their enemies. There was, therefore, an\r\nintervening space or strip of ground about four miles broad, which\r\nmight be said to be no man's land. It was no man's land as to\r\nmilitary possession, but it was still occupied by many of its old\r\ninhabitants. These people were not allowed to pass the lines either\r\nof one army or of the other; or if they did so pass they were not\r\nallowed to return to their homes. To these homes they were forced to\r\ncling, and there they remained. They had no market, no shops at which\r\nto make purchases even if they had money to buy; no customers with\r\nwhom to deal even if they had produce to sell. They had their cows,\r\nif they could keep them from the Confederate soldiers, their pigs and\r\ntheir poultry; and on them they were living--a most forlorn life. Any\r\nadvance made by either party must be over their homesteads. In the\r\nevent of battle they would be in the midst of it; and in the meantime\r\nthey could see no one, hear of nothing, go no whither beyond the\r\nlimits of that miserable strip of ground!\r\n\r\nThe earth was hard with frost when I paid my visit to the camp, and\r\nthe general appearance of things around my friend's quarters was on\r\nthat account cheerful enough. It was the mud which made things sad\r\nand wretched. When the frost came it seemed as though the army had\r\novercome one of its worst enemies. Unfortunately cold weather did not\r\nlast long. I have been told in Washington that they rarely have had\r\nso open a season. Soon after my departure that terrible enemy, the\r\nmud, came back upon them, but during my stay the ground was hard and\r\nthe weather very sharp. I slept in a tent, and managed to keep my\r\nbody warm by an enormous overstructure of blankets and coats; but I\r\ncould not keep my head warm. Throughout the night I had to go down,\r\nlike a fish beneath the water, for protection, and come up for air at\r\nintervals, half-smothered. I had a stove in my tent, but the heat of\r\nthat when lighted was more terrible than the severity of the frost.\r\n\r\nThe tents of the brigade with which I was staying had been pitched\r\nnot without an eye to appearances. They were placed in streets as it\r\nwere, each street having its name, and between them screens had been\r\nerected of fir-poles and fir-branches, so as to keep off the wind.\r\nThe outside boundaries of the nearest regiment were ornamented with\r\narches, crosses, and columns constructed in the same way; so that\r\nthe quarters of the men were reached, as it were, through gateways.\r\nThe whole thing was pretty enough, and while the ground was hard\r\nthe camp was picturesque, and a visit to it was not unpleasant. But\r\nunfortunately the ground was in its nature soft and deep, composed of\r\nred clay, and as the frost went and the wet weather came, mud became\r\nomnipotent and destroyed all prettiness. And I found that the cold\r\nweather, let it be ever so cold, was not severe upon the men. It was\r\nwet which they feared and had cause to fear, both for themselves and\r\nfor their horses. As to the horses, but few of them were protected by\r\nany shelter or covering whatsoever. Through both frost and wet they\r\nremained out, tied to the wheel of a waggon or to some temporary rack\r\nat which they were fed. In England we should imagine that any horse\r\nso treated must perish; but here the animals seemed to stand it. Many\r\nof them were miserable enough in appearance, but nevertheless they\r\ndid the work required of them. I have observed that horses throughout\r\nthe States are treated in a hardier manner than is usually the case\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which I am speaking, January, 1862, the health of\r\nthe army of the Potomac was not as good as it had been, and was\r\nbeginning to give way under the effects of the winter. Measles had\r\nbecome very prevalent, and also small-pox--though not of a virulent\r\ndescription; and men, in many instances, were sinking under fatigue.\r\nI was informed by various officers that the Irish regiments were\r\non the whole the most satisfactory. Not that they made the best\r\nsoldiers, for it was asserted that they were worse, as soldiers, than\r\nthe Americans or Germans; not that they became more easily subject to\r\nrule, for it was asserted that they were unruly;--but because they\r\nwere rarely ill. Diseases which seized the American troops on all\r\nsides seemed to spare them. The mortality was not excessive, but the\r\nmen became sick and ailing, and fell under the doctor's hands.\r\n\r\nMr. Olmstead, whose name is well known in England as a writer on the\r\nsouthern States, was at this time secretary to a Sanitary Commission\r\non the army, and published an abstract of the results of the\r\ninquiries made, on which I believe perfect reliance may be placed.\r\nThis inquiry was extended to two hundred regiments, which were\r\npresumed to be included in the army of the Potomac; but these\r\nregiments were not all located on the Virginian side of the river,\r\nand must not therefore be taken as belonging exclusively to the\r\ndivisions of which I have been speaking. Mr. Olmstead says, \"The\r\nhealth of our armies is evidently not above the average of armies in\r\nthe field. The mortality of the army of the Potomac during the summer\r\nmonths averaged 3½ per cent., and for the whole army it is stated at\r\n5 per cent.\" \"Of the camps inspected, 5 per cent.,\" he says, \"were\r\nin admirable order; 44 per cent. fairly clean and well policed. The\r\ncondition of 26 per cent. was negligent and slovenly, and of 24 per\r\ncent. decidedly bad, filthy, and dangerous.\" Thus 50 per cent. were\r\neither negligent and slovenly, or filthy and dangerous. I wonder\r\nwhat the report would have been had Camp Benton at St. Louis been\r\nsurveyed! \"In about 80 per cent. of the regiments the officers\r\nclaimed to give systematic attention to the cleanliness of the men;\r\nbut it is remarked that they rarely enforced the washing of the feet,\r\nand not always of the head and neck.\" I wish Mr. Olmstead had added\r\nthat they never enforced the cutting of the hair. No single trait has\r\nbeen so decidedly disadvantageous to the appearance of the American\r\narmy, as the long, uncombed, rough locks of hair which the men have\r\nappeared so loth to abandon. In reading the above one cannot but\r\nthink of the condition of those other twenty regiments!\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Olmstead two-thirds of the men were native-born, and\r\none-third was composed of foreigners. These foreigners are either\r\nIrish or German. Had a similar report been made of the armies in\r\nthe West, I think it would have been seen that the proportion of\r\nforeigners was still greater. The average age of the privates was\r\nsomething under twenty-five, and that of the officers thirty-four. I\r\nmay here add, from my own observation, that an officer's rank could\r\nin no degree be predicated from his age. Generals, colonels, majors,\r\ncaptains, and lieutenants, had been all appointed at the same time\r\nand without reference to age or qualification. Political influence or\r\nthe power of raising recruits had been the standard by which military\r\nrank was distributed. The old West Point officers had generally been\r\nchosen for high commands, but beyond this everything was necessarily\r\nnew. Young colonels and ancient captains abounded without any harsh\r\nfeeling as to the matter on either side. Indeed in this respect the\r\npractice of the country generally was simply carried out. Fathers and\r\nmothers in America seem to obey their sons and daughters naturally,\r\nand as they grow old become the slaves of their grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMr. Olmstead says that food was found to be universally good and\r\nabundant. On this matter Mr. Olmstead might have spoken in stronger\r\nlanguage without exaggeration. The food supplied to the American\r\narmies has been extravagantly good, and certainly has been wastefully\r\nabundant. Very much has been said of the cost of the American army,\r\nand it has been made a matter of boasting that no army so costly has\r\never been put into the field by any other nation. The assertion is,\r\nI believe, at any rate true. I have found it impossible to ascertain\r\nwhat has hitherto been expended on the army. I much doubt whether\r\neven Mr. Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, or Mr. Stanton, the\r\nSecretary-at-War, know themselves, and I do not suppose that Mr.\r\nStanton's predecessor much cared. Some approach, however, may be\r\nreached to the amount actually paid in wages and for clothes and\r\ndiet, and I give below a statement which I have seen of the actual\r\nannual sum proposed to be expended on these heads, presuming the army\r\nto consist of 500,000 men. The army is stated to contain 660,000 men,\r\nbut the former numbers given would probably be found to be nearer the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            Dollars.\r\n   Wages of privates, including\r\n     sergeants and corporals               86,640,000\r\n   Salaries of regimental officers         23,784,000\r\n   Extra wages of privates; extra pay to\r\n     mounted officers, and salary of\r\n     officers above the rank of colonel    17,000,000\r\n                                          -----------\r\n                                          127,424,000\r\n                                               or\r\n                                          £25,484,000 sterling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this must be added the cost of diet and clothing. The food of the\r\nmen, I was informed, was supplied at an average cost of 17 cents a\r\nday, which, for an army of 500,000 men, would amount to £6,200,000\r\nper annum. The clothing of the men is shown by the printed statement\r\nof their war department to amount to 3 dollars a month for a period\r\nof five years. That, at least, is the amount allowed to a private of\r\ninfantry or artillery. The cost of the cavalry uniforms and of the\r\ndress of the non-commissioned officers is something higher, but not\r\nsufficiently so to make it necessary to make special provision for\r\nthe difference in a statement so rough as this. At 3 dollars a month\r\nthe clothing of the army would amount to £3,600,000. The actual\r\nannual cost would therefore be as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Salaries and wages           £25,484,400\r\n   Diet of the soldiers           6,200,000\r\n   Clothing for the soldiers      3,600,000\r\n                                -----------\r\n                                £35,284,400\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that these figures may be trusted, unless it be with\r\nreference to that sum of $17,000,000 or £3,400,000, which is presumed\r\nto include the salaries of all general-officers with their staffs,\r\nand also the extra wages paid to soldiers in certain cases. This is\r\ngiven as an estimate, and may be over or under the mark. The sum\r\nnamed as the cost of clothing would be correct, or nearly so, if the\r\narmy remained in its present force for five years. If it so remained\r\nfor only one year the cost would be one-fifth higher. It must of\r\ncourse be remembered that the sum above named includes simply the\r\nwages, clothes, and food of the men. It does not comprise the\r\npurchase of arms, horses, ammunition, or waggons; the forage of\r\nhorses; the transport of troops, or any of those incidental expenses\r\nof warfare which are always, I presume, heavier than the absolute\r\ncost of the men, and which in this war have been probably heavier\r\nthan in any war ever waged on the face of God's earth. Nor does it\r\ninclude that terrible item of peculation as to which I will say a\r\nword or two before I finish this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe yearly total payment of the officers and soldiers of the armies\r\nis as follows. As regards the officers it must be understood that\r\nthis includes all the allowances made to them, except as regards\r\nthose on the staff. The sums named apply only to the infantry and\r\nartillery. The pay of the cavalry is about ten per cent. higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Lieutenant-General.                        £1,850\r\n     General Scott alone holds that\r\n     rank in the States' army\r\n   Major-General                               1,150\r\n   Brigadier-General                             800\r\n   *Colonel                                      530\r\n   *Lieutenant-Colonel                           475\r\n   Major                                         430\r\n   Captain                                       300\r\n   First Lieutenant                              265\r\n   Second Lieutenant                             245\r\n   First Sergeant                                 48\r\n   Sergeant                                       40\r\n   Corporal                                       34\r\n   Private                                        31\r\n\r\n   *A Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonel are attached to\r\n    each regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every grade named the pay is, I believe, higher than that given by\r\nus, or, as I imagine, by any other nation. It is, however, probable\r\nthat the extra allowances paid to some of our higher officers when\r\non duty may give to their positions for a time a higher pecuniary\r\nremuneration. It will of course be understood that there is nothing\r\nin the American army answering to our colonel of a regiment. With us\r\nthe officer so designated holds a nominal command of high dignity and\r\nemolument as a reward for past services.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of my visits to the camps of the other armies\r\nin the field, that of General Halleck, who held his head-quarters\r\nat St. Louis, in Missouri, and that of General Buell, who was at\r\nLouisville, in Kentucky. There was also a fourth army under General\r\nHunter, in Kansas, but I did not make my way as far west as that.\r\nI do not pretend to any military knowledge, and should be foolish\r\nto attempt military criticism; but as far as I could judge by\r\nappearance, I should say that the men in Buell's army were, of the\r\nthree, in the best order. They seemed to me to be cleaner than the\r\nothers, and, as far as I could learn, were in better health. Want\r\nof discipline and dirt have, no doubt, been the great faults of the\r\nregiments generally, and the latter drawback may probably be included\r\nin the former. These men have not been accustomed to act under the\r\norders of superiors, and when they entered on the service hardly\r\nrecognized the fact that they would have to do so in ought else than\r\nin their actual drill and fighting. It is impossible to conceive any\r\nclass of men to whom the necessary discipline of a soldier would come\r\nwith more difficulty than to an American citizen. The whole training\r\nof his life has been against it. He has never known respect for\r\na master, or reverence for men of a higher rank than himself. He\r\nhas probably been made to work hard for his wages,--harder than an\r\nEnglishman works,--but he has been his employer's equal. The language\r\nbetween them has been the language of equals, and their arrangement\r\nas to labour and wages has been a contract between equals. If he\r\ndid not work he would not get his money,--and perhaps not if he did.\r\nUnder these circumstances he has made his fight with the world; but\r\nthose circumstances have never taught him that special deference to\r\na superior, which is the first essential of a soldier's duty. But\r\nprobably in no respect would that difficulty be so severely felt as\r\nin all matters appertaining to personal habits. Here at any rate the\r\nman would expect to be still his own master, acting for himself and\r\nindependent of all outer control. Our English Hodge, when taken from\r\nthe plough to the camp, would, probably, submit without a murmur\r\nto soap and water and a barber's shears; he would have received\r\nnone of that education which would prompt him to rebel against such\r\nordinances; but the American citizen, who for a while expects to\r\nshake hands with his captain whenever he sees him, and is astonished\r\nwhen he learns that he must not offer him drinks, cannot at once\r\nbe brought to understand that he is to be treated like a child in\r\nthe nursery;--that he must change his shirt so often, wash himself\r\nat such and such intervals, and go through a certain process of\r\ncleansing his outward garments daily. I met while travelling a\r\nsergeant of an old regular American regiment, and he spoke of the\r\nwant of discipline among the volunteers as hopeless. But even he\r\ninstanced it chiefly by their want of cleanliness. \"They wear their\r\nshirts till they drop off their backs,\" said he; \"and what can you\r\nexpect from such men as that?\" I liked that sergeant for his zeal\r\nand intelligence, and also for his courtesy when he found that I was\r\nan Englishman; for previous to his so finding he had begun to abuse\r\nthe English roundly,--but I did not quite agree with him about the\r\nvolunteers. It is very bad that soldiers should be dirty, bad also\r\nthat they should treat their captains with familiarity and desire\r\nto exchange drinks with the majors. But even discipline is not\r\neverything; and discipline will come at last even to the American\r\nsoldiers, distasteful as it may be, when the necessity for it is made\r\napparent. But these volunteers have great military virtues. They are\r\nintelligent, zealous in their cause, handy with arms, willing enough\r\nto work at all military duties, and personally brave. On the other\r\nhand they are sickly, and there has been a considerable amount of\r\ndrunkenness among them. No man who has looked to the subject can, I\r\nthink, doubt that a native American has a lower physical development\r\nthan an Irishman, a German, or an Englishman. They become old sooner,\r\nand die at an earlier age. As to that matter of drink, I do not think\r\nthat much need be said against them. English soldiers get drunk when\r\nthey have the means of doing so, and American soldiers would not get\r\ndrunk if the means were taken away from them. A little drunkenness\r\ngoes a long way in a camp, and ten drunkards will give a bad name to\r\na company of a hundred. Let any man travel with twenty men of whom\r\nfour are tipsy, and on leaving them he will tell you that every man\r\nof them was a drunkard.\r\n\r\nI have said that these men are brave, and I have no doubt that they\r\nare so. How should it be otherwise with men of such a race? But it\r\nmust be remembered that there are two kinds of courage, one of which\r\nis very common and the other very uncommon. Of the latter description\r\nof courage it cannot be expected that much should be found among the\r\nprivates of any army, and perhaps not very many examples among the\r\nofficers. It is a courage self-sustained, based on a knowledge of the\r\nright and on a life-long calculation that any results coming from\r\nadherence to the right will be preferable to any that can be produced\r\nby a departure from it. This is the courage which will enable a man\r\nto stand his ground in battle or elsewhere, though broken worlds\r\nshould fall around him. The other courage, which is mainly an affair\r\nof the heart or blood and not of the brain, always requires some\r\noutward support. The man who finds himself prominent in danger bears\r\nhimself gallantly, because the eyes of many will see him; whether\r\nas an old man he leads an army, or as a young man goes on a forlorn\r\nhope, or as a private carries his officer on his back out of the\r\nfire, he is sustained by the love of praise. And the men who are not\r\nindividually prominent in danger, who stand their ground shoulder\r\nto shoulder, bear themselves gallantly also, each trusting in the\r\ncombined strength of his comrades. When such combined strength has\r\nbeen acquired, that useful courage is engendered which we may rather\r\ncall confidence, and which of all courage is the most serviceable in\r\nthe army. At the battle of Bull's Run the army of the North became\r\npanic-stricken and fled. From this fact many have been led to believe\r\nthat the American soldiers would not fight well, and that they could\r\nnot be brought to stand their ground under fire. This I think has\r\nbeen an unfair conclusion. In the first place the history of the\r\nbattle of Bull's Run has yet to be written; as yet the history of\r\nthe flight only has been given to us. As far as I can learn, the\r\nnorthern soldiers did at first fight well;--so well, that the army of\r\nthe South believed itself to be beaten. But a panic was created--at\r\nfirst, as it seems, among the teamsters and waggons. A cry was\r\nraised, and a rush was made by hundreds of drivers with their carts\r\nand horses; and then men who had never seen war before, who had not\r\nyet had three months' drilling as soldiers, to whom the turmoil of\r\nthat day must have seemed as though hell were opening upon them,\r\njoined themselves to the general clamour, and fled to Washington,\r\nbelieving that all was lost. But at the same time the regiments of\r\nthe enemy were going through the same farce in the other direction!\r\nIt was a battle between troops who knew nothing of battles; of\r\nsoldiers who were not yet soldiers. That individual high-minded\r\ncourage, which would have given to each individual recruit the\r\nself-sustained power against a panic, which is to be looked for in a\r\ngeneral, was not to be looked for in them. Of the other courage of\r\nwhich I have spoken, there was as much as the circumstances of the\r\nbattle would allow.\r\n\r\nOn subsequent occasions the men have fought well. We should, I think,\r\nadmit that they have fought very well when we consider how short has\r\nbeen their practice at such work. At Somerset, at Fort Henry, at Fort\r\nDonnelson, at Corinth, the men behaved with courage, standing well\r\nto their arms, though at each place the slaughter among them was\r\ngreat. They have always gone well into fire, and have generally\r\nborne themselves well under fire. I am convinced that we in England\r\ncan make no greater mistake than to suppose that the Americans as\r\nsoldiers are deficient in courage.\r\n\r\nBut now I must come to a matter in which a terrible deficiency has\r\nbeen shown, not by the soldiers, but by those whose duty it has been\r\nto provide for the soldiers. It is impossible to speak of the army\r\nof the North and to leave untouched that hideous subject of army\r\ncontracts. And I think myself the more specially bound to allude to\r\nit because I feel that the iniquities which have prevailed, prove\r\nwith terrible earnestness the demoralizing power of that dishonesty\r\namong men in high places, which is the one great evil of the American\r\nStates. It is there that the deficiency exists, which must be\r\nsupplied before the public men of the nation can take a high rank\r\namong other public men. There is the gangrene, which must be cut out\r\nbefore the government, as a government, can be great. To make money\r\nis the one thing needful, and men have been anxious to meddle with\r\nthe affairs of government, because there might money be made with\r\nthe greatest ease. \"Make money,\" the Roman satirist said; \"make it\r\nhonestly if you can, but at any rate make money.\" That first counsel\r\nwould be considered futile and altogether vain by those who have\r\nlately dealt with the public wants of the American States.\r\n\r\nThis is bad in a most fatal degree, not mainly because men in high\r\nplaces have been dishonest, or because the government has been badly\r\nserved by its own paid officers. That men in high places should be\r\ndishonest, and that the people should be cheated by their rulers is\r\nvery bad. But there is worse than this. The thing becomes so common,\r\nand so notorious, that the American world at large is taught to\r\nbelieve that dishonesty is in itself good. \"It behoves a man to be\r\nsmart, sir!\" Till the opposite doctrine to that be learned; till men\r\nin America,--ay, and in Europe, Asia, and Africa,--can learn that\r\nit specially behoves a man not to be smart, they will have learned\r\nlittle of their duty towards God, and nothing of their duty towards\r\ntheir neighbour.\r\n\r\nIn the instances of fraud against the States' government to which I\r\nam about to allude, I shall take all my facts from the report made\r\nto the House of Representatives at Washington by a Committee of that\r\nHouse in December, 1861. \"Mr. Washbourne, from the Select Committee\r\nto inquire into the Contracts of the Government, made the following\r\nReport.\" That is the heading of the pamphlet. The Committee was known\r\nas the Van Wyck Committee, a gentleman of that name having acted as\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nThe Committee first went to New York, and began their inquiries with\r\nreference to the purchase of a steam-boat called the \"Catiline.\"\r\nIn this case a certain Captain Comstock had been designated from\r\nWashington as the agent to be trusted in the charter or purchase\r\nof the vessel. He agreed on behalf of the Government to hire that\r\nspecial boat for £2000 a month for three months, having given\r\ninformation to friends of his on the matter, which enabled them to\r\npurchase it out-and-out for less than £4000. These friends were\r\nnot connected with shipping matters, but were lawyers and hotel\r\nproprietors. The Committee conclude \"that the vessel was chartered to\r\nthe Government at an unconscionable price; and that Captain Comstock,\r\nby whom this was effected, while enjoying _the peculiar confidence of\r\nthe Government_, was acting for and in concert with the parties who\r\nchartered the vessel, and was in fact their agent.\" But the report\r\ndoes not explain why Captain Comstock was selected for this work by\r\nauthority from Washington, nor does it recommend that he be punished.\r\nIt does not appear that Captain Comstock had ever been in the regular\r\nservice of the Government, but that he had been master of a steamer.\r\n\r\nIn the next place one Starbuck is employed to buy ships. As a\r\ngovernment agent he buys two for £1300, and sells them to the\r\ngovernment for £2900. The vessels themselves, when delivered at the\r\nNavy Yard, were found to be totally unfit for the service for which\r\nthey had been purchased. But why was Starbuck employed, when, as\r\nappears over and over again in the report, New York was full of paid\r\ngovernment servants ready and fit to do the work? Starbuck was merely\r\nan agent, and who will believe that he was allowed to pocket the\r\nwhole difference of £1600? The greater part of the plunder was,\r\nhowever, in this case refunded.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the case of Mr. George D. Morgan, brother-in-law\r\nof Mr. Welles, the Secretary of the Navy. I have spoken of this\r\ngentleman before, and of his singular prosperity. He amassed a large\r\nfortune in five months, as a government agent for the purchase of\r\nvessels, he having been a wholesale grocer by trade. This gentleman\r\nhad had no experience whatsoever with reference to ships. It is shown\r\nby the evidence that he had none of the requisite knowledge, and that\r\nthere were special servants of the government in New York at that\r\ntime, sent there specially for such services as these, who were in\r\nevery way trustworthy, and who had the requisite knowledge. Yet\r\nMr. Morgan was placed in this position by his brother-in-law the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, and in that capacity made about £20,000 in\r\nfive months, all of which was paid by the government, as is well\r\nshown to have been the fact in the report before me. One result of\r\nsuch a mode of agency is given;--one other result, I mean, besides\r\nthe £20,000 put into the pocket of the brother of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy. A ship called the \"Stars and Stripes\" was bought by Mr.\r\nMorgan for £11,000, which had been built some months before for\r\n£7000. This vessel was bought from a company which was blessed with a\r\nPresident. The President made the bargain with the government agent,\r\nbut insisted on keeping back from his own company £2000 out of the\r\n£11,000 for expenses incident to the purchase. The company did not\r\nlike being mulcted of its prey, and growled heavily; but their\r\nPresident declared that such bargains were not got at Washington\r\nfor nothing. Members of Congress had to be paid to assist in such\r\nthings. At least he could not reduce his little private bill for such\r\nassistance below £1600. He had, he said, positively paid out so much\r\nto those venal Members of Congress, and had made nothing for himself\r\nto compensate him for his own exertions. When this President came\r\nto be examined, he admitted that he had really made no payments to\r\nMembers of Congress. His own capacity had been so great that no such\r\nassistance had been found necessary. But he justified his charge on\r\nthe ground that the sum taken by him was no more than the company\r\nmight have expected him to lay out on Members of Congress, or on\r\nex-Members who are specially mentioned, had he not himself carried\r\non the business with such consummate discretion! It seems to me that\r\nthe Members or ex-Members of Congress were shamefully robbed in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe report deals manfully with Mr. Morgan, showing that for five\r\nmonths' work,--which work he did not do and did not know how to\r\ndo,--he received as large a sum as the President's salary for the\r\nwhole Presidential term of four years. So much better is it to be an\r\nagent of government than simply an officer! And the Committee adds,\r\nthat they \"do not find in this transaction the less to censure in the\r\nfact that this arrangement between the Secretary of the Navy and Mr.\r\nMorgan was one between brothers-in-law.\" After that who will believe\r\nthat Mr. Morgan had the whole of that £20,000 for himself? And yet\r\nMr. Welles still remains Secretary of the Navy, and has justified the\r\nwhole transaction in an explanation admitting everything, and which\r\nis considered by his friends to be an able State paper. \"It behoves a\r\nman to be smart, sir.\" Mr. Morgan and Secretary Welles will no doubt\r\nbe considered by their own party to have done their duty well as\r\nhigh trading public functionaries. The faults of Mr. Morgan and of\r\nSecretary Welles are nothing to us in England; but the light in which\r\nsuch faults may be regarded by the American people is much to us.\r\n\r\nI will now go on to the case of a Mr. Cummings. Mr. Cummings, it\r\nappears, had been for many years the editor of a newspaper in\r\nPhiladelphia, and had been an intimate political friend and ally of\r\nMr. Cameron. Now at the time of which I am writing, April, 1861, Mr.\r\nCameron was Secretary-at-War, and could be very useful to an old\r\npolitical ally living in his own State. The upshot of the present\r\ncase will teach us to think well of Mr. Cameron's gratitude.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1861, stores were wanted for the army at Washington, and\r\nMr. Cameron gave an order to his old friend Cummings to expend\r\n2,000,000 dollars, pretty much according to his fancy, in buying\r\nstores. Governor Morgan, the Governor of New York State and a\r\nrelative of our other friend Morgan, was joined with Mr. Cummings\r\nin this commission, Mr. Cameron no doubt having felt himself bound\r\nto give the friends of his colleague at the Navy a chance. Governor\r\nMorgan at once made over his right to his relative; but better things\r\nsoon came in Mr. Morgan's way, and he relinquished his share in this\r\npartnership at an early date. In this transaction he did not himself\r\nhandle above 25,000 dollars. Then the whole job fell into the hands\r\nof Mr. Cameron's old political friend.\r\n\r\nThe 2,000,000 of dollars, or £400,000, were paid into the hands of\r\ncertain government treasurers at New York, but they had orders to\r\nhonour the draft of the political friend of the Secretary-at-War, and\r\nconsequently £50,000 was immediately withdrawn by Mr. Cummings, and\r\nwith this he went to work. It is shown that he knew nothing of the\r\nbusiness; that he employed a clerk from Albany whom he did not know,\r\nand confided to this clerk the duty of buying such stores as were\r\nbought; that this clerk was recommended to him by Mr. Weed, the\r\neditor of a newspaper at Albany, who is known in the States as the\r\nspecial political friend of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State; and\r\nthat in this way he spent £32,000. He bought linen pantaloons and\r\nstraw hats to the amount of £4200, because he thought the soldiers\r\nlooked hot in the warm weather; but he afterwards learned that they\r\nwere of no use. He bought groceries of a hardware dealer named\r\nDavidson, at Albany, that town whence came Mr. Weed's clerk. He did\r\nnot know what was Davidson's trade, nor did he know exactly what he\r\nwas going to buy; but Davidson proposed to sell him something which\r\nMr. Cummings believed to be some kind of provisions, and he bought\r\nit. He did not know for how much,--whether over £2000 or not. He\r\nnever saw the articles and had no knowledge of their quality. It was\r\nout of the question that he should have such knowledge, as he naïvely\r\nremarks. His clerk Humphreys saw the articles. He presumed they\r\nwere brought from Albany, but did not know. He afterwards bought a\r\nship,--or two or three ships. He inspected one ship \"by a mere casual\r\nvisit:\" that is to say, he did not examine her boilers; he did not\r\nknow her tonnage, but he took the word of the seller for everything.\r\nHe could not state the terms of the charter, or give the substance of\r\nit. He had had no former experience in buying or chartering ships. He\r\nalso bought 75,000 pair of shoes at only 25 cents, or one shilling a\r\npair, more than their proper price. He bought them of a Mr. Hall, who\r\ndeclares that he paid Mr. Cummings nothing for the job, but regarded\r\nit as a return for certain previous favours conferred by him on Mr.\r\nCummings in the occasional loans of £100 or £200.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the examination it appears that Mr. Cummings still held\r\nin his hand a slight balance of £28,000, of which he had forgotten\r\nto make mention in the body of his own evidence. \"This item seems to\r\nhave been overlooked by him in his testimony,\" says the report. And\r\nwhen the report was made nothing had yet been learned of the destiny\r\nof this small balance.\r\n\r\nThen the report gives a list of the army supplies miscellaneously\r\npurchased by Mr. Cummings:--280 dozen pints of ale at 9_s._ 6_d._\r\na dozen; a lot of codfish and herrings; 200 boxes of cheeses and\r\na large assortment of butter; some tongues; straw hats and linen\r\n\"pants;\" 23 barrels of pickles; 25 casks of Scotch ale, price not\r\nstated; a lot of London porter, price not stated; and some Hall\r\ncarbines of which I must say a word more further on. It should be\r\nremembered that no requisition had come from the army for any of\r\nthe articles named; that the purchase of herrings and straw hats\r\nwas dictated solely by the discretion of Cummings and his man\r\nHumphreys,--or, as is more probable, by the fact that some other\r\nperson had such articles by him for sale; and that the government\r\nhad its own established officers for the supply of things properly\r\nordered by military requisition. These very same articles also were\r\napparently procured, in the first place, as a private speculation,\r\nand were made over to the government on the failure of that\r\nspeculation. \"Some of the above articles,\" says the report, \"were\r\nshipped by the 'Catiline,' which were probably loaded on private\r\naccount, and not being able to obtain a clearance was in some way,\r\nthrough Mr. Cummings, transferred over to the government,--_Scotch\r\nale, London porter, selected herrings_, and all.\" The italics as well\r\nas the words are taken from the report.\r\n\r\nThis was the confidential political friend of the Secretary-at-War,\r\nby whom he was intrusted with £400,000 of public money! £28,000\r\nhad not been accounted for when the report was made, and the\r\narmy supplies were bought after the fashion above named. That\r\nSecretary-at-War, Mr. Cameron, has since left the Cabinet; but he has\r\nnot been turned out in disgrace; he has been nominated as minister to\r\nRussia, and the world has been told that there was some difference\r\nof opinion between him and his colleagues respecting slavery! Mr.\r\nCameron in some speech or paper declared on his leaving the Cabinet\r\nthat he had not intended to remain long as Secretary-at-War. This\r\nassertion, I should think, must have been true.\r\n\r\nAnd now about the Hall carbines, as to which the gentlemen on this\r\nCommittee tell their tale with an evident delight in the richness of\r\nits incidents which at once puts all their readers in accord with\r\nthem. There were altogether some five thousand of these, all of which\r\nthe government sold to a Mr. Eastman in June, 1861, for 14_s._ each,\r\nas perfectly useless, and afterwards bought in August for £4 8_s._\r\neach, about 4_s._ a carbine having been expended in their repair in\r\nthe mean time. But as regards 790 of these now famous weapons, it\r\nmust be explained they had been sold by the government as perfectly\r\nuseless, and at a nominal price, previously to this second sale made\r\nby the government to Mr. Eastman. They had been so sold, and then,\r\nin April, 1861, they had been bought again for the government by the\r\nindefatigable Cummings for £3 each. Then they were again sold as\r\nuseless for 14_s._ each to Eastman, and instantly rebought on behalf\r\nof the government for £4 8_s._ each! Useless for war purposes they\r\nmay have been, but as articles of commerce it must be confessed that\r\nthey were very serviceable.\r\n\r\nThis last purchase was made by a man named Stevens on behalf of\r\nGeneral Fremont, who at that time commanded the army of the United\r\nStates in Missouri. Stevens had been employed by General Fremont as\r\nan agent on the behalf of government, as is shown with clearness\r\nin the report, and on hearing of these muskets telegraphed to the\r\nGeneral at once. \"I have 5000 Hall's rifled cast-steel muskets,\r\nbreech-loading, new, at 22 dollars.\" General Fremont telegraphed\r\nback instantly, \"I will take the whole 5000 carbines ... I will pay\r\nall extra charges . . .\" And so the purchase was made. The muskets,\r\nit seems, were not absolutely useless even as weapons of war.\r\n\"Considering the emergency of the times,\" a competent witness\r\nconsidered them to be worth \"10 or 12 dollars.\" The government had\r\nbeen as much cheated in selling them as it had in buying them. But\r\nthe nature of the latter transaction is shown by the facts that\r\nStevens was employed, though irresponsibly employed, as a government\r\nagent by General Fremont; that he bought the muskets in that\r\ncharacter himself, making on the transaction £1 18_s._ on each\r\nmusket; and that the same man afterwards appeared as an aide-de-camp\r\non General Fremont's staff. General Fremont had no authority himself\r\nto make such a purchase, and when the money was paid for the first\r\ninstalment of the arms, it was so paid by the special order of\r\nGeneral Fremont himself out of moneys intended to be applied to\r\nother purposes. The money was actually paid to a gentleman known at\r\nFremont's head-quarters as his special friend, and was then paid in\r\nthat irregular way because this friend desired that that special\r\nbill should receive immediate payment. After that who can believe\r\nthat Stevens was himself allowed to pocket the whole amount of the\r\nplunder?\r\n\r\nThere is a nice little story of a clergyman in New York who sold\r\nfor £40 and certain further contingencies, the right to furnish 200\r\ncavalry horses; but I should make this too long if I told all the\r\nnice little stories. As the frauds at St. Louis were, if not in fact\r\nthe most monstrous, at any rate the most monstrous which have as\r\nyet been brought to the light, I cannot finish this account without\r\nexplaining something of what was going on at that western Paradise in\r\nthose halcyon days of General Fremont.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont, soon after reaching St. Louis, undertook to build\r\nten forts for the protection of that city. These forts have since\r\nbeen pronounced as useless, and the whole measure has been treated\r\nwith derision by officers of his own army. But the judgment displayed\r\nin the matter is a military question with which I do not presume to\r\nmeddle. Even if a general be wrong in such a matter, his character as\r\na man is not disgraced by such error. But the manner of building them\r\nwas the affair with which Mr. Van Wyck's committee had to deal. It\r\nseems that five of the forts, the five largest, were made under the\r\norders of a certain Major Kappner at a cost of £12,000, and that the\r\nother five could have been built at least for the same sum. Major\r\nKappner seems to have been a good and honest public servant, and\r\ntherefore quite unfit for the superintendence of such work at St.\r\nLouis. The other five smaller forts were also in progress, the works\r\non them having been continued from 1st September to 25th September,\r\n1861; but on the 25th September General Fremont himself gave special\r\norders that a contract should be made with a man named Beard, a\r\nCalifornian, who had followed him from California to St. Louis. This\r\ncontract is dated the 25th of September. But nevertheless the work\r\nspecified in that contract was done previous to that date, and most\r\nof the money paid was paid previous to that date. The contract did\r\nnot specify any lump sum, but agreed that the work should be paid for\r\nby the yard and by the square foot. No less a sum was paid to Beard\r\nfor this work--the cormorant Beard, as the report calls him--than\r\n£24,200, the last payment only, amounting to £4000, having been made\r\nsubsequent to the date of the contract. £20,200 was paid to Beard\r\nbefore the date of the contract! The amounts were paid at five times,\r\nand the last four payments were made on the personal order of General\r\nFremont. This Beard was under no bond, and none of the officers of\r\nthe government knew anything of the terms under which he was working.\r\nOn the 14th of October General Fremont was ordered to discontinue\r\nthese works, and to abstain from making any further payments on their\r\naccount. But, disobeying this order, he directed his Quartermaster to\r\npay a further sum of £4000 to Beard out of the first sums he should\r\nreceive from Washington, he then being out of money. This however\r\nwas not paid. \"It must be understood,\" says the report, \"that every\r\ndollar ordered to be paid by General Fremont on account of these\r\nworks was diverted from a fund specially appropriated for another\r\npurpose.\" And then again, \"The money appropriated by Congress to\r\nsubsist and clothe and transport our armies was then, in utter\r\ncontempt of all law and of the army regulations, as well as in\r\ndefiance of superior authority, ordered to be diverted from its\r\nlawful purpose and turned over to the cormorant Beard. While he had\r\nreceived 170,000 dollars (£24,200) from the Government, it will be\r\nseen from the testimony of Major Kappner that there had only been\r\npaid to the honest German labourers, who did the work on the first\r\nfive forts built under his directions, the sum of 15,500 dollars\r\n(£3100), leaving from 40,000 to 50,000 dollars (£8000 to £10,000)\r\nstill due; and while these labourers, whose families were clamouring\r\nfor bread, were besieging the Quartermaster's department for their\r\npay, this infamous contractor Beard is found following up the army\r\nand in the confidence of the Major-General, who gives him orders for\r\nlarge purchases, which could only have been legally made through the\r\nQuartermaster's department.\" After that who will believe that all\r\nthe money went into Beard's pocket? Why should General Fremont have\r\ncommitted every conceivable breach of order against his government,\r\nmerely with the view of favouring such a man as Beard?\r\n\r\nThe collusion of the Quartermaster M'Instry with fraudulent knaves\r\nin the purchase of horses is then proved. M'Instry was at this time\r\nFremont's Quartermaster at St. Louis. I cannot go through all these.\r\nA man of the name of Jim Neil comes out in beautiful pre-eminence. No\r\ndealer in horses could get to the Quartermaster except through Jim\r\nNeil, or some such go-between. The Quartermaster contracted with\r\nNeil and Neil with the owners of horses; Neil at the time being\r\nalso military inspector of horses for the Quartermaster. He bought\r\nhorses as cavalry horses for £24 or less, and passed them himself\r\nas artillery horses for £30. In other cases the military inspectors\r\nwere paid by the sellers to pass horses. All this was done under\r\nQuartermaster M'Instry, who would himself deal with none but such as\r\nNeil. In one instance, one Elleard got a contract from M'Instry, the\r\nprofit of which was £8000. But there was a man named Brady. Now Brady\r\nwas a friend of M'Instry's, who, scenting the carrion afar off, had\r\ncome from Detroit, in Michigan, to St. Louis. M'Instry himself had\r\nalso come from Detroit. In this case Elleard was simply directed by\r\nM'Instry to share his profits with Brady, and consequently paid to\r\nBrady £4000, although Brady gave to the business neither capital nor\r\nlabour. He simply took the £4000 as the Quartermaster's friend. This\r\nElleard, it seems, also gave a carriage and horses to Mrs. Fremont.\r\nIndeed Elleard seems to have been a civil and generous fellow. Then\r\nthere is a man named Thompson, whose case is very amusing. Of him\r\nthe Committee thus speaks:--\"It must be said that Thompson was not\r\nforgetful of the obligations of gratitude, for, after he got through\r\nwith the contract, he presented the son of Major M'Instry with a\r\nriding pony. That was the only mark of respect,\" to use his own\r\nwords, \"that he showed to the family of Major M'Instry.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont himself desired that a contract should be made with\r\none Augustus Sacchi for a thousand Canadian horses. It turned out\r\nthat Sacchi was \"nobody: a man of straw living in a garret in New\r\nYork whom nobody knew, a man who was brought out there\"--to St.\r\nLouis--\"as a good person through whom to work.\" \"It will hardly be\r\nbelieved,\" says the report, \"that the name of this same man Sacchi\r\nappears in the newspapers as being on the staff of General Fremont,\r\nat Springfield, with the rank of captain.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know that any good would result from my pursuing further the\r\ndetails of this wonderful report. The remaining portion of it refers\r\nsolely to the command held by General Fremont in Missouri, and adds\r\nproof upon proof of the gross robberies inflicted upon the government\r\nof the States by the very persons set in high authority to protect\r\nthe government. We learn how all utensils for the camp, kettles,\r\nblankets, shoes, mess-pans, &c., were supplied by one firm, without\r\na contract, at an enormous price, and of a quality so bad as to be\r\nalmost useless, because the Quartermaster was under obligations to\r\nthe partners. We learn that one partner in that firm gave £40 towards\r\na service of plate for the Quartermaster, and £60 towards a carriage\r\nfor Mrs. Fremont. We learn how futile were the efforts of any honest\r\ntradesman to supply good shoes to soldiers who were shoeless, and\r\nthe history of one special pair of shoes which was thrust under the\r\nnose of the Quartermaster is very amusing. We learn that a certain\r\npaymaster properly refused to settle an account for matters with\r\nwhich he had no concern, and that General Fremont at once sent down\r\nsoldiers to arrest him unless he made the illegal payment. In October\r\n£1000 was expended in ice, all which ice was wasted. Regiments were\r\nsent hither and thither with no military purpose, merely because\r\ncertain officers, calling themselves generals, desired to make up\r\nbrigades for themselves. Indeed every description of fraud was\r\nperpetrated, and this was done not through the negligence of those in\r\nhigh command, but by their connivance and often with their express\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that the conduct of General Fremont during the days\r\nof his command in Missouri is not a matter of much moment to us\r\nin England; that it has been properly handled by the Committee of\r\nRepresentatives appointed by the American Congress to inquire into\r\nthe matter; and that after the publication of such a report by them,\r\nit is ungenerous in a writer from another nation to speak upon the\r\nsubject. This would be so if the inquiries made by that Committee\r\nand their report had resulted in any general condemnation of the men\r\nwhose misdeeds and peculations have been exposed. This, however, is\r\nby no means the case. Those who were heretofore opposed to General\r\nFremont on political principles are opposed to him still; but those\r\nwho heretofore supported him are ready to support him again.* He has\r\nnot been placed beyond the pale of public favour by the record which\r\nhas been made of his public misdeeds. He is decried by the democrats\r\nbecause he is a republican, and by the anti-abolitionists because\r\nhe is an abolitionist; but he is not decried because he has shown\r\nhimself to be dishonest in the service of his government. He was\r\ndismissed from his command in the West, but men on his side of the\r\nquestion declare that he was so dismissed because his political\r\nopponents had prevailed. Now, at the moment that I am writing this,\r\nmen are saying that the President must give him another command.\r\nHe is still a major-general in the army of the States, and is as\r\nprobable a candidate as any other that I could name for the next\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\n  *Since this was written General Fremont has been restored to high\r\n   military command, and now holds equal rank and equal authority\r\n   with Maclellan and Halleck. In fact, the charges made against him\r\n   by the Committee of the House of Representatives have not been\r\n   allowed to stand in his way. He is politically popular with a\r\n   large section of the nation, and therefore it has been thought\r\n   well to promote him to high place. Whether he be fit for such\r\n   place, either as regards capability or integrity, seems to be\r\n   considered of no moment.\r\n\r\nThe same argument must be used with reference to the other gentlemen\r\nnamed. Mr. Welles is still a Cabinet Minister and Secretary for\r\nthe Navy. It has been found impossible to keep Mr. Cameron in the\r\nCabinet, but he was named as the Minister of the States government to\r\nRussia after the publication of the Van Wyck report, when the result\r\nof his old political friendship with Mr. Alexander Cummings was\r\nwell known to the President who appointed him and to the Senate who\r\nsanctioned his appointment. The individual corruption of any one\r\nman--of any ten men--is not much. It should not be insisted on loudly\r\nby any foreigner in making up a balance-sheet of the virtues and\r\nvices of the good and bad qualities of any nation. But the light in\r\nwhich such corruption is viewed by the people whom it most nearly\r\nconcerns is very much. I am far from saying that democracy has failed\r\nin America. Democracy there has done great things for a numerous\r\npeople, and will yet, as I think, be successful. But that doctrine as\r\nto the necessity of smartness must be eschewed before a verdict in\r\nfavour of American democracy can be pronounced. \"It behoves a man to\r\nbe smart, sir.\" In those words are contained the curse under which\r\nthe States' government has been suffering for the last thirty years.\r\nLet us hope that the people will find a mode of ridding themselves of\r\nthat curse. I, for one, believe that they will do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBACK TO BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Louisville we returned to Cincinnati, in making which journey\r\nwe were taken to a place called Seymour in Indiana, at which spot we\r\nwere to \"make connection\" with the train running on the Mississippi\r\nand Ohio line from St. Louis to Cincinnati. We did make the\r\nconnection, but were called upon to remain four hours at Seymour\r\nin consequence of some accident on the line. In the same way, when\r\ngoing eastwards from Cincinnati to Baltimore a few days later, I was\r\ndetained another four hours at a place called Crossline, in Ohio. On\r\nboth occasions I spent my time in realizing, as far as that might\r\nbe possible, the sort of life which men lead who settle themselves\r\nat such localities. Both these towns,--for they call themselves\r\ntowns,--had been created by the railways. Indeed this has been the\r\ncase with almost every place at which a few hundred inhabitants have\r\nbeen drawn together in the western States. With the exception of such\r\ncities as Chicago, St. Louis, and Cincinnati, settlers can hardly\r\nbe said to have chosen their own localities. These have been chosen\r\nfor them by the originators of the different lines of railway. And\r\nthere is nothing in Europe in any way like to these western railway\r\nsettlements. In the first place the line of the rails runs through\r\nthe main street of the town, and forms not unfrequently the only\r\nroad. At Seymour I could find no way of getting away from the rails\r\nunless I went into the fields. At Crossline, which is a larger place,\r\nI did find a street in which there was no railroad, but it was\r\ndeserted, and manifestly out of favour with the inhabitants. As there\r\nwere railway junctions at both these posts, there were of course\r\ncross-streets, and the houses extended themselves from the centre\r\nthus made along the lines, houses being added to houses at short\r\nintervals as new comers settled themselves down. The panting and\r\ngroaning, and whistling of engines is continual; for at such places\r\nfreight trains are always kept waiting for passenger trains, and the\r\nslower freight trains for those which are called fast. This is the\r\nlife of the town; and indeed as the whole place is dependent on the\r\nrailway, so is the railway held in favour and beloved. The noise\r\nof the engines is not disliked, nor are its puffings and groanings\r\nheld to be unmusical. With us a locomotive steam-engine is still,\r\nas it were, a beast of prey, against which one has to be on one's\r\nguard,--in respect to which one specially warns the children. But\r\nthere, in the western States, it has been taken to the bosoms of them\r\nall as a domestic animal; no one fears it, and the little children\r\nrun about almost among its wheels. It is petted and made much of on\r\nall sides,--and, as far as I know, it seldom bites or tears. I have\r\nnot heard of children being destroyed wholesale in the streets, or of\r\ndrunken men becoming frequent sacrifices. But had I been consulted\r\nbeforehand as to the natural effects of such an arrangement, I should\r\nhave said that no child could have been reared in such a town, and\r\nthat any continuance of population under such circumstances must have\r\nbeen impracticable.\r\n\r\nSuch places, however, do thrive and prosper with a prosperity\r\nespecially their own, and the boys and girls increase and multiply in\r\nspite of all dangers. With us in England, it is difficult to realize\r\nthe importance which is attached to a railway in the States, and\r\nthe results which a railway creates. We have roads everywhere, and\r\nour country had been cultivated throughout, with more or less care,\r\nbefore our system of railways had been commenced; but in America,\r\nespecially in the North, the railways have been the precursors of\r\ncultivation. They have been carried hither and thither, through\r\nprimeval forests and over prairies, with small hope of other traffic\r\nthan that which they themselves would make by their own influences.\r\nThe people settling on their edges have had the very best of all\r\nroads at their service; but they have had no other roads. The face of\r\nthe country between one settlement and another is still in many cases\r\nutterly unknown; but there is the connecting road by which produce\r\nis carried away, and new comers are brought in. The town that is\r\ndistant a hundred miles by the rail is so near that its inhabitants\r\nare neighbours; but a settlement twenty miles distant across the\r\nuncleared country is unknown, unvisited, and probably unheard of\r\nby the women and children. Under such circumstances the railway is\r\neverything. It is the first necessity of life, and gives the only\r\nhope of wealth. It is the backbone of existence from whence spring,\r\nand by which are protected, all the vital organs and functions of\r\nthe community. It is the right arm of civilization for the people,\r\nand the discoverer of the fertility of the land. It is all in all\r\nto those people, and to those regions. It has supplied the wants of\r\nfrontier life with all the substantial comfort of the cities, and\r\ncarried education, progress, and social habits into the wilderness.\r\nTo the eye of the stranger such places as Seymour and Crossline are\r\ndesolate and dreary. There is nothing of beauty in them, given either\r\nby nature or by art. The railway itself is ugly, and its numerous\r\nsidings and branches form a mass of iron road which is bewildering\r\nand, according to my ideas, in itself disagreeable. The wooden houses\r\nopen down upon the line, and have no gardens to relieve them. A\r\nforeigner, when first surveying such a spot, will certainly record\r\nwithin himself a verdict against it; but in doing so he probably\r\ncommits the error of judging it by a wrong standard. He should\r\ncompare it with the new settlements which men have opened up in spots\r\nwhere no railway has assisted them, and not with old towns in which\r\nwealth has long been congregated. The traveller may see what is the\r\nplace with the railway; then let him consider how it might have\r\nthriven without the railway.\r\n\r\nI confess that I became tired of my sojourn at both the places I\r\nhave named. At each I think that I saw every house in the place,\r\nalthough my visit to Seymour was made in the night; and at both I\r\nwas lamentably at a loss for something to do. At Crossline I was all\r\nalone, and began to feel that the hours which I knew must pass before\r\nthe missing train could come, would never make away with themselves.\r\nThere were many others stationed there as I was, but to them had been\r\ngiven a capability for loafing which niggardly Nature has denied\r\nto me. An American has the power of seating himself in the close\r\nvicinity of a hot stove and feeding in silence on his own thoughts\r\nby the hour together. It may be that he will smoke; but after a\r\nwhile his cigar will come to an end. He sits on, however, certainly\r\npatient, and apparently contented. It may be that he chews, but if\r\nso, he does it with motionless jaws, and so slow a mastication of\r\nthe pabulum on which he feeds, that his employment in this respect\r\nonly disturbs the absolute quiet of the circle when, at certain long,\r\ndistant intervals, he deposits the secretion of his tobacco in an\r\nornamental utensil which may probably be placed in the furthest\r\ncorner of the hall. But during all this time he is happy. It does not\r\nfret him to sit there and think and do nothing. He is by no means an\r\nidle man,--probably one much given to commercial enterprise. Idle men\r\nout there in the West we may say there are none. How should any idle\r\nman live in such a country? All who were sitting hour after hour in\r\nthat circle round the stove of the Crossline Hotel hall,--sitting\r\nthere hour after hour in silence, as I could not sit,--were men\r\nwho earned their bread by labour. They were farmers, mechanics,\r\nstorekeepers; there was a lawyer or two, and one clergyman.\r\nSufficient conversation took place at first to indicate the\r\nprofessions of many of them. One may conclude that there could not be\r\nplace there for an idle man. But they all of them had a capacity for\r\na prolonged state of doing nothing, which is to me unintelligible,\r\nand which is very much to be envied. They are patient as cows, which\r\nfrom hour to hour lie on the grass chewing their cud. An Englishman,\r\nif he be kept waiting by a train in some forlorn station in which\r\nhe can find no employment, curses his fate and all that has led to\r\nhis present misfortune with an energy which tells the story of his\r\ndeep and thorough misery. Such, I confess, is my state of existence\r\nunder such circumstances. But a western American gives himself up\r\nto \"loafing,\" and is quite happy. He balances himself on the back\r\nlegs of an arm-chair, and remains so, without speaking, drinking, or\r\nsmoking for an hour at a stretch; and while he is doing so he looks\r\nas though he had all that he desired. I believe that he is happy, and\r\nthat he has all that he wants for such an occasion;--an arm-chair in\r\nwhich to sit, and a stove on which he can put his feet, and by which\r\nhe can make himself warm.\r\n\r\nSuch was not the phase of character which I had expected to find\r\namong the people of the West. Of all virtues, patience would have\r\nbeen the last which I should have thought of attributing to them. I\r\nshould have expected to see them angry when robbed of their time, and\r\nirritable under the stress of such grievances as railway delays; but\r\nthey are never irritable under such circumstances as I have attempted\r\nto describe, nor, indeed, are they a people prone to irritation under\r\nany grievances. Even in political matters they are long-enduring, and\r\ndo not form themselves into mobs for the expression of hot opinion.\r\nWe in England thought that masses of the people would rise in anger\r\nif Mr. Lincoln's government should consent to give up Slidell and\r\nMason; but the people bore it without any rising. The habeas corpus\r\nhas been suspended, the liberty of the press has been destroyed for a\r\ntime, the telegraph wires have been taken up by the government into\r\ntheir own hands; but nevertheless the people have said nothing. There\r\nhas been no rising of a mob, and not even an expression of an adverse\r\nopinion. The people require to be allowed to vote periodically, and\r\nhaving acquired that privilege permit other matters to go by the\r\nboard. In this respect we have, I think, in some degree misunderstood\r\ntheir character. They have all been taught to reverence the nature\r\nof that form of government under which they live, but they are not\r\nspecially addicted to hot political fermentation. They have learned\r\nto understand that democratic institutions have given them liberty,\r\nand on that subject they entertain a strong conviction which is\r\nuniversal. But they have not habitually interested themselves deeply\r\nin the doings of their legislators or of their government. On the\r\nsubject of slavery there have been and are different opinions, held\r\nwith great tenacity and maintained occasionally with violence; but on\r\nother subjects of daily policy the American people have not, I think,\r\nbeen eager politicians. Leading men in public life have been much\r\nless trammelled by popular will than among us. Indeed with us the\r\nmost conspicuous of our statesmen and legislators do not lead, but\r\nare led. In the States the noted politicians of the day have been\r\nthe leaders, and not unfrequently the coercers of opinion. Seeing\r\nthis, I claim for England a broader freedom in political matters than\r\nthe States have as yet achieved. In speaking of the American form of\r\ngovernment, I will endeavour to explain more clearly the ideas which\r\nI have come to hold on this matter.\r\n\r\nI survived my delay at Seymour, after which I passed again through\r\nCincinnati, and then survived my subsequent delay at Crossline. As\r\nto Cincinnati, I must put on record the result of a country walk\r\nwhich I took there,--or rather on which I was taken by my friend. He\r\nprofessed to know the beauties of the neighbourhood, and to be well\r\nacquainted with all that was attractive in its vicinity. Cincinnati\r\nis built on the Ohio, and is closely surrounded by picturesque hills\r\nwhich overhang the suburbs of the city. Over these I was taken,\r\nploughing my way through a depth of mud which cannot be understood\r\nby any ordinary Englishman. But the depth of mud was not the only\r\nimpediment, nor the worst which we encountered. As we began to\r\nascend from the level of the outskirts of the town we were greeted\r\nby a rising flavour in the air, which soon grew into a strong\r\nodour, and at last developed itself into a stench that surpassed in\r\noffensiveness anything that my nose had ever hitherto suffered. When\r\nwe were at the worst we hardly knew whether to descend or to proceed.\r\nIt had so increased in virulence, that at one time I felt sure that\r\nit arose from some matter buried in the ground beneath my feet. But\r\nmy friend, who declared himself to be quite at home in Cincinnati\r\nmatters, and to understand the details of the great Cincinnati\r\ntrade, declared against this opinion of mine. Hogs, he said, were\r\nat the bottom of it. It was the odour of hogs going up to the Ohio\r\nheavens;--of hogs in a state of transit from hoggish nature to\r\nclothes-brushes, saddles, sausages, and lard. He spoke with an\r\nauthority that constrained belief; but I can never forgive him in\r\nthat he took me over those hills, knowing all that he professed to\r\nknow. Let the visitors to Cincinnati keep themselves within the city,\r\nand not wander forth among the mountains. It is well that the odour\r\nof hogs should ascend to heaven and not hang heavy over the streets;\r\nbut it is not well to intercept that odour in its ascent. My friend\r\nbecame ill with fever, and had to betake himself to the care of\r\nnursing friends; so that I parted company with him at Cincinnati. I\r\ndid not tell him that his illness was deserved as well as natural,\r\nbut such was my feeling on the matter. I myself happily escaped the\r\nevil consequences which his imprudence might have entailed on me.\r\n\r\nI passed again through Pittsburg, and over the Alleghany mountains by\r\nAltoona, and down to Baltimore,--back into civilization, secession,\r\nconversation, and gastronomy. I never had secessionist sympathies\r\nand never expressed them. I always believed in the North as a\r\npeople,--discrediting, however, to the utmost the existing northern\r\nGovernment, or, as I should more properly say, the existing northern\r\nCabinet; but nevertheless, with such feelings and such belief, I\r\nfound myself very happy at Baltimore. Putting aside Boston, which\r\nmust, I think, be generally preferred by Englishmen to any other\r\ncity in the States, I should choose Baltimore as my residence if I\r\nwere called upon to live in America. I am not led to this opinion,\r\nif I know myself, solely by the canvas-back ducks; and as to the\r\nterrapins, I throw them to the winds. The madeira, which is still\r\nkept there with a reverence which I should call superstitious were\r\nit not that its free circulation among outside worshippers prohibits\r\nthe just use of such a word, may have something to do with it; as may\r\nalso the beauty of the women,--to some small extent. Trifles do bear\r\nupon our happiness in a manner that we do not ourselves understand,\r\nand of which we are unconscious. But there was an English look about\r\nthe streets and houses which I think had as much to do with it as\r\neither the wine, the women, or the ducks; and it seemed to me as\r\nthough the manners of the people of Maryland were more English than\r\nthose of other Americans. I do not say that they were on this account\r\nbetter. My English hat is, I am well aware, less graceful, and I\r\nbelieve less comfortable, than a Turkish fez and turban; nevertheless\r\nI prefer my English hat. New York I regard as the most thoroughly\r\nAmerican of all American cities. It is by no means the one in which I\r\nshould find myself the happiest, but I do not on that account condemn\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have said that in returning to Baltimore I found myself among\r\nsecessionists. In so saying, I intend to speak of a certain set\r\nwhose influence depends perhaps more on their wealth, position, and\r\neducation than on their numbers. I do not think that the population\r\nof the city was then in favour of secession, even if it had ever been\r\nso. I believe that the mob of Baltimore is probably the roughest mob\r\nin the States,--is more akin to a Paris mob, and I may, perhaps, also\r\nsay to a Manchester mob, than that of any other American city. There\r\nare more roughs in Baltimore than elsewhere, and the roughs there are\r\nrougher. In those early days of secession, when the troops were being\r\nfirst hurried down from New England for the protection of Washington,\r\nthis mob was vehemently opposed to its progress. Men had been taught\r\nto think that the rights of the State of Maryland were being invaded\r\nby the passage of the soldiers; and they also were undoubtedly imbued\r\nwith a strong prepossession for the southern cause. The two ideas\r\nhad then gone together. But the mob of Baltimore had ceased to\r\nbe secessionists within twelve months of their first exploit. In\r\nApril, 1861, they had refused to allow Massachusetts soldiers to\r\npass through the town on their way to Washington; and in February,\r\n1862, they were nailing Union flags on the door-posts of those who\r\nrefused to display such banners as signs of triumph at the northern\r\nvictories!\r\n\r\nThat Maryland can ever go with the South, even in the event of the\r\nSouth succeeding in secession, no Marylander can believe. It is\r\nnot pretended that there is any struggle now going on with such\r\nan object. No such result has been expected, certainly since the\r\npossession of Washington was secured to the North by the army of the\r\nPotomac. By few, I believe, was such a result expected even when\r\nWashington was insecure. And yet the feeling for secession among a\r\ncertain class in Baltimore is as strong now as ever it was. And it is\r\nequally strong in certain districts of the State,--in those districts\r\nwhich are most akin to Virginia in their habits, modes of thought,\r\nand ties of friendship. These men, and these women also, pray for\r\nthe South if they be pious, give their money to the South if they be\r\ngenerous, work for the South if they be industrious, fight for the\r\nSouth if they be young, and talk for the South morning, noon, and\r\nnight in spite of General Dix and his columbiads on Federal Hill. It\r\nis in vain to say that such men and women have no strong feeling on\r\nthe matter, and that they are praying, working, fighting, and talking\r\nunder dictation. Their hearts are in it. And judging from them, even\r\nthough there were no other evidence from which to judge, I have no\r\ndoubt that a similar feeling is strong through all the seceding\r\nStates. On this subject the North, I think, deceives itself in\r\nsupposing that the southern rebellion has been carried on without any\r\nstrong feeling on the part of the southern people. Whether the mob\r\nof Charleston be like the mob of Baltimore I cannot tell; but I have\r\nno doubt as to the gentry of Charleston and the gentry of Baltimore\r\nbeing in accord on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn what way, then, when the question has been settled by the force of\r\narms, will these classes find themselves obliged to act? In Virginia\r\nand Maryland they comprise, as a rule, the highest and best educated\r\nof the people. As to parts of Kentucky the same thing may be said,\r\nand probably as to the whole of Tennessee. It must be remembered that\r\nthis is not as though certain aristocratic families in a few English\r\ncounties should find themselves divided off from the politics and\r\nnational aspirations of their countrymen,--as was the case long since\r\nwith reference to the Roman Catholic adherents of the Stuarts, and\r\nas has been the case since then in a lesser degree with the firmest\r\nof the old Tories who had allowed themselves to be deceived by Sir\r\nRobert Peel. In each of these cases the minority of dissentients was\r\nso small that the nation suffered nothing, though individuals were\r\nall but robbed of their nationality. But as regards America it must\r\nbe remembered that each State has in itself a governing power, and\r\nis in fact a separate people. Each has its own legislature, and must\r\nhave its own line of politics.\r\n\r\nThe secessionists of Maryland and of Virginia may consent to live in\r\nobscurity; but if this be so, who is to rule in those States? From\r\nwhence are to come the senators and the members of Congress; the\r\ngovernors and attorney-generals? From whence is to come the national\r\nspirit of the two States, and the salt that shall preserve their\r\npolitical life? I have never believed that these States would succeed\r\nin secession. I have always felt that they would be held within the\r\nUnion, whatever might be their own wishes. But I think that they\r\nwill be so held in a manner and after a fashion that will render any\r\npolitical vitality almost impossible till a new generation shall\r\nhave sprung up. In the meantime life goes on pleasantly enough in\r\nBaltimore, and ladies meet together, knitting stockings and sewing\r\nshirts for the southern soldiers, while the gentlemen talk southern\r\npolitics and drink the health of the (southern) President in\r\nambiguous terms, as our Cavaliers used to drink the health of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nDuring my second visit to Baltimore I went over to Washington for a\r\nday or two, and found the capital still under the empire of King Mud.\r\nHow the elite of a nation--for the inhabitants of Washington consider\r\nthemselves to be the elite--can consent to live in such a state of\r\nthraldom, a foreigner cannot understand. Were I to say that it was\r\nintended to be typical of the condition of the government, I might\r\nbe considered cynical; but undoubtedly the sloughs of despond which\r\nwere deepest in their despondency were to be found in localities\r\nwhich gave an appearance of truth to such a surmise. The Secretary\r\nof State's office in which Mr. Seward was still reigning, though\r\nwith diminished glory, was divided from the Head-Quarters of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, which are immediately opposite to it, by an\r\nopaque river which admitted of no transit. These buildings stand at\r\nthe corner of President Square, and it had been long understood that\r\nany close intercourse between them had not been considered desirable\r\nby the occupants of the military side of the causeway. But the\r\nSecretary of State's office was altogether unapproachable without a\r\nlong circuit and begrimed legs. The Secretary-at-War's department\r\nwas, if possible, in a worse condition. This is situated on the other\r\nside of the President's house, and the mud lay, if possible, thicker\r\nin this quarter than it did round Mr. Seward's chambers. The passage\r\nover Pennsylvania Avenue, immediately in front of the War Office, was\r\na thing not to be attempted in those days. Mr. Cameron, it is true,\r\nhad gone, and Mr. Stanton was installed; but the labour of cleansing\r\nthe interior of that establishment had hitherto allowed no time for a\r\nglance at the exterior dirt, and Mr. Stanton should, perhaps, be held\r\nas excused. That the Navy Office should be buried in mud, and quite\r\ndebarred from approach, was to be expected. The space immediately in\r\nfront of Mr. Lincoln's own residence was still kept fairly clean,\r\nand I am happy to be able to give testimony to this effect. Long may\r\nit remain so. I could not, however, but think that an energetic and\r\ncareful President would have seen to the removal of the dirt from\r\nhis own immediate neighbourhood. It was something that his own shoes\r\nshould remain unpolluted; but the foul mud always clinging to the\r\nboots and leggings of those by whom he was daily surrounded must,\r\nI should think, have been offensive to him. The entrance to the\r\nTreasury was difficult to achieve by those who had not learned by\r\npractice the ways of the place; but I must confess that a tolerably\r\nclear passage was maintained on that side which led immediately\r\ndown to the halls of Congress. Up at the Capitol the mud was again\r\ntriumphant in the front of the building; this however was not of\r\ngreat importance, as the legislative chambers of the States are\r\nalways reached by the back-door. I, on this occasion, attempted to\r\nleave the building by the grand entrance, but I soon became entangled\r\namong rivers of mud and mazes of shifting sand. With difficulty I\r\nrecovered my steps, and finding my way back to the building was\r\nforced to content myself by an exit among the crowd of senators and\r\nrepresentatives who were thronging down the back-stairs.\r\n\r\nOf dirt of all kinds it behoves Washington and those concerned in\r\nWashington to make themselves free. It is the Augean stables through\r\nwhich some American Hercules must turn a purifying river before\r\nthe American people can justly boast either of their capital or of\r\ntheir government. As to the material mud, enough has been said. The\r\npresence of the army perhaps caused it, and the excessive quantity\r\nof rain which had fallen may also be taken as a fair plea. But what\r\nexcuse shall we find for that other dirt? It also had been caused by\r\nthe presence of the army, and by that long-continued down-pouring of\r\ncontracts which had fallen like Danaë's golden shower into the laps\r\nof those who understood how to avail themselves of such heavenly\r\nwaters. The leaders of the rebellion are hated in the North. The\r\nnames of Jefferson Davis, of Cobb, Tombes, and Floyd are mentioned\r\nwith execration by the very children. This has sprung from a true\r\nand noble feeling; from a patriotic love of national greatness and a\r\nhatred of those who, for small party purposes, have been willing to\r\nlessen the name of the United States. I have reverenced the feeling\r\neven when I have not shared it. But, in addition to this, the names\r\nof those also should be execrated who have robbed their country when\r\npretending to serve it; who have taken its wages in the days of its\r\ngreat struggle, and at the same time have filched from its coffers;\r\nwho have undertaken the task of steering the ship through the storm\r\nin order that their hands might be deep in the meal-tub and the\r\nbread-basket, and that they might stuff their own sacks with the\r\nship's provisions. These are the men who must be loathed by the\r\nnation,--whose fate must be held up as a warning to others before\r\ngood can come! Northern men and women talk of hanging Davis and his\r\naccomplices. I myself trust that there will be no hanging when the\r\nwar is over. I believe there will be none, for the Americans are not\r\na blood-thirsty people. But if punishment of any kind be meted out,\r\nthe men of the North should understand that they have worse offenders\r\namong them than Davis and Floyd.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which I am now speaking, there had come a change\r\nover the spirit of Mr. Lincoln's cabinet. Mr. Seward was still his\r\nSecretary of State, but he was, as far as outside observers could\r\njudge, no longer his Prime Minister. In the early days of the war,\r\nand up to the departure of Mr. Cameron from out of the cabinet, Mr.\r\nSeward had been the Minister of the nation. In his despatches he\r\ntalks ever of We or of I. In every word of his official writings, of\r\nwhich a large volume has been published, he shows plainly that he\r\nintends to be considered as the man of the day,--as the hero who is\r\nto bring the States through their difficulties. Mr. Lincoln may be\r\nKing, but Mr. Seward is Mayor of the Palace and carries the King in\r\nhis pocket. From the depth of his own wisdom he undertakes to teach\r\nhis ministers in all parts of the world, not only their duties, but\r\ntheir proper aspiration. He is equally kind to foreign statesmen,\r\nand sends to them messages as though from an altitude which no\r\nEuropean politician had ever reached. At home he has affected the\r\nPrime Minister in everything, dropping the We and using the I in a\r\nmanner that has hardly made up by its audacity for its deficiency\r\nin discretion. It is of course known everywhere that he had run Mr.\r\nLincoln very hard for the position of republican candidate for the\r\nPresidency. Mr. Lincoln beat him, and Mr. Seward is well aware that\r\nin the States a man has never a second chance for the Presidential\r\nchair. Hence has arisen his ambition to make for himself a new place\r\nin the annals of American politics. Hitherto there has been no Prime\r\nMinister known in the Government of the United States. Mr. Seward has\r\nattempted a revolution in that matter, and has essayed to fill the\r\nsituation. For awhile it almost seemed that he was successful. He\r\ninterfered with the army, and his interferences were endured. He took\r\nupon himself the business of the police, and arrested men at his own\r\nwill and pleasure. The habeas corpus was in his hand, and his name\r\nwas current through the States as a covering authority for every\r\noutrage on the old laws. Sufficient craft, or perhaps cleverness,\r\nhe possessed to organize a position which should give him a power\r\ngreater than the power of the President; but he had not the genius\r\nwhich would enable him to hold it. He made foolish prophecies about\r\nthe war, and talked of the triumphs which he would win. He wrote\r\nstate papers on matters which he did not understand, and gave himself\r\nthe airs of diplomatic learning while he showed himself to be sadly\r\nignorant of the very rudiments of diplomacy. He tried to joke as Lord\r\nPalmerston jokes, and nobody liked his joking. He was greedy after\r\nthe little appanages of power, taking from others who loved them as\r\nwell as he did, privileges with which he might have dispensed. And\r\nthen, lastly, he was successful in nothing. He had given himself\r\nout as the commander of the Commander-in-Chief; but then under his\r\ncommand nothing got itself done. For a month or two some men had\r\nreally believed in Mr. Seward. The policemen of the country had\r\ncome to have an absolute trust in him, and the underlings of the\r\npublic offices were beginning to think that he might be a great man.\r\nBut then, as is ever the case with such men, there came suddenly a\r\ndownfall. Mr. Cameron went from the cabinet, and everybody knew that\r\nMr. Seward would be no longer commander of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\nHis prime ministership was gone from him, and he sank down into the\r\ncomparatively humble position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. His\r\nlettres de cachet no longer ran. His passport system was repealed.\r\nHis prisoners were released. And though it is too much to say that\r\nwrits of habeas corpus were no longer suspended, the effect and very\r\nmeaning of the suspension were at once altered. When I first left\r\nWashington Mr. Seward was the only minister of the cabinet whose name\r\nwas ever mentioned with reference to any great political measure.\r\nWhen I returned to Washington Mr. Stanton was Mr. Lincoln's leading\r\nminister, and, as Secretary-at-War, had practically the management of\r\nthe army and of the internal police.\r\n\r\nI have spoken here of Mr. Seward by name, and in my preceding\r\nparagraphs I have alluded with some asperity to the dishonesty of\r\ncertain men who had obtained political power under Mr. Lincoln and\r\nused it for their own dishonest purposes. I trust that I may not be\r\nunderstood as bringing any such charges against Mr. Seward. That\r\nsuch dishonesty has been frightfully prevalent all men know who knew\r\nanything of Washington during the year 1861. In a former chapter I\r\nhave alluded to this more at length, stating circumstances and in\r\nsome cases giving the names of the persons charged with offences.\r\nWhenever I have done so, I have based my statements on the Van Wyck\r\nReport, and the evidence therein given. This is the published report\r\nof a Committee appointed by the House of Representatives; and as it\r\nhas been before the world for some months without refutation, I think\r\nthat I have a right to presume it to be true.* On no less authority\r\nthan this would I consider myself justified in bringing any such\r\ncharge. Of Mr. Seward's incompetency I have heard very much among\r\nAmerican politicians; much also of his ambition. With worse offences\r\nthan these I have not heard him charged.\r\n\r\n  *I ought perhaps to state that General Fremont has published an\r\n   answer to the charges preferred against him. That answer refers\r\n   chiefly to matters of military capacity or incapacity, as to\r\n   which I have expressed no opinion. General Fremont does allude\r\n   to the accusations made against him regarding the building of\r\n   the forts;--but in doing so he seems to me rather to admit than\r\n   to deny the facts as stated by the Committee.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which I am writing, February, 1862, the long list of\r\nmilitary successes which attended the northern army through the late\r\nwinter and early spring had commenced. Fort Henry, on the Tennessee\r\nriver, had first been taken, and after that, Fort Donnelson on the\r\nCumberland river, also in the State of Tennessee. Price had been\r\ndriven out of Missouri into Arkansas by General Curtis, acting under\r\nGeneral Halleck's orders. The chief body of the Confederate army in\r\nthe West had abandoned the fortified position which they had long\r\nheld at Bowling Green, in the south-western district of Kentucky.\r\nRoanoke Island, on the coast of North Carolina, had been taken by\r\nGeneral Burnside's expedition, and a belief had begun to manifest\r\nitself in Washington that the army of the Potomac was really about\r\nto advance. It is impossible to explain in what way the renewed\r\nconfidence of the northern party showed itself, or how one learned\r\nthat the hopes of the secessionists were waxing dim; but it was so;\r\nand even a stranger became aware of the general feeling as clearly as\r\nthough it were a defined and established fact. In the early part of\r\nthe winter, when I reached Washington, the feeling ran all the other\r\nway. Northern men did not say that they were despondent; they did not\r\nwith spoken words express diffidence as to their success; but their\r\nlooks betrayed diffidence, and the moderation of their self-assurance\r\nalmost amounted to despondency. In the capital the parties were\r\nvery much divided. The old inhabitants were either secessionists or\r\ninfluenced by \"secession proclivities,\" as the word went; but the men\r\nof the government and of the two houses of Congress were, with a few\r\nexceptions, of course northern. It should be understood that these\r\nparties were at variance with each other on almost every point as to\r\nwhich men can disagree. In our civil war it may be presumed that all\r\nEnglishmen were at any rate anxious for England. They desired and\r\nfought for different modes of government; but each party was equally\r\nEnglish in its ambition. In the States there is the hatred of a\r\ndifferent nationality added to the rancour of different politics.\r\nThe Southerners desire to be a people of themselves,--to divide\r\nthemselves by every possible mark of division from New England; to\r\nbe as little akin to New York as they are to London,--or if possible\r\nless so. Their habits, they say, are different; their education,\r\ntheir beliefs, their propensities, their very virtues and vices\r\nare not the education, or the beliefs, or the propensities, or the\r\nvirtues and vices of the North. The bond that ties them to the\r\nNorth is to them a Mezentian marriage, and they hate their northern\r\nspouses with a Mezentian hatred. They would be anything sooner than\r\ncitizens of the United States. They see to what Mexico has come,\r\nand the republics of Central America; but the prospect of even that\r\ndegradation is less bitter to them than a share in the glory of the\r\nstars and stripes. Better, with them, to reign in hell than serve in\r\nheaven! It is not only in politics that they will be beaten, if they\r\nbe beaten,--as one party with us may be beaten by another; but they\r\nwill be beaten as we should be beaten if France annexed us, and\r\ndirected that we should live under French rule. Let an Englishman\r\ndigest and realize that idea, and he will comprehend the feelings\r\nof a southern gentleman as he contemplates the probability that his\r\nState will be brought back into the Union. And the northern feeling\r\nis as strong. The northern man has founded his national ambition on\r\nthe territorial greatness of his nation. He has panted for new lands,\r\nand for still extended boundaries. The western world has opened her\r\narms to him, and has seemed to welcome him as her only lord. British\r\nAmerica has tempted him towards the north, and Mexico has been as a\r\nprey to him on the south. He has made maps of his empire, including\r\nall the continent, and has preached the Monroe doctrine as though it\r\nhad been decreed by the gods. He has told the world of his increasing\r\nmillions, and has never yet known his store to diminish. He has pawed\r\nin the valley, and rejoiced in his strength. He has said among the\r\ntrumpets, Ha, ha! He has boasted aloud in his pride, and called on\r\nall men to look at his glory. And now shall he be divided and shorn?\r\nShall he be hemmed in from his ocean and shut off from his rivers?\r\nShall he have a hook run into his nostrils, and a thorn driven into\r\nhis jaw? Shall men say that his day is over, when he has hardly yet\r\ntasted the full cup of his success? Has his young life been a dream,\r\nand not a truth? Shall he never reach that giant manhood which the\r\ngrowth of his boyish years has promised him? If the South goes from\r\nhim, he will be divided, shorn, and hemmed in. The hook will have\r\npierced his nose, and the thorn will fester in his jaw. Men will\r\ntaunt him with his former boastings, and he will awake to find\r\nhimself but a mortal among mortals.\r\n\r\nSuch is the light in which the struggle is regarded by the two\r\nparties, and such the hopes and feelings which have been engendered.\r\nIt may therefore be surmised with what amount of neighbourly love\r\nsecessionist and northern neighbours regarded each other in such\r\ntowns as Baltimore and Washington. Of course there was hatred of\r\nthe deepest dye; of course there were muttered curses, or curses\r\nwhich sometimes were not simply muttered. Of course there were\r\nwretchedness, heart-burnings, and fearful divisions in families.\r\nThat, perhaps, was the worst of all. The daughter's husband would be\r\nin the northern ranks, while the son was fighting in the South; or\r\ntwo sons would hold equal rank in the two armies, sometimes sending\r\nto each other frightful threats of personal vengeance. Old friends\r\nwould meet each other in the street, passing without speaking; or,\r\nworse still, would utter words of insult for which payment is to be\r\ndemanded when a southern gentleman may again be allowed to quarrel in\r\nhis own defence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet society went on. Women still smiled, and men were happy to\r\nwhom such smiles were given. Cakes and ale were going and ginger\r\nwas still hot in the mouth. When many were together no words of\r\nunhappiness were heard. It was at those small meetings of two or\r\nthree that women would weep instead of smiling, and that men would\r\nrun their hands through their hair and sit in silence, thinking of\r\ntheir ruined hopes and divided children.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of southern hopes and northern fears, and have\r\nendeavoured to explain the feelings of each party. For myself I think\r\nthat the Southerners have been wrong in their hopes, and that those\r\nof the North have been wrong in their fears. It is not better to rule\r\nin hell than serve in heaven. Of course a southern gentleman will not\r\nadmit the premises which are here by me taken for granted. The hell\r\nto which I allude is, the sad position of a low and debased nation.\r\nSuch, I think, will be the fate of the Gulf States, if they succeed\r\nin obtaining secession,--of a low and debased nation, or, worse\r\nstill, of many low and debased nations. They will have lost their\r\ncotton monopoly by the competition created during the period of the\r\nwar, and will have no material of greatness on which either to found\r\nthemselves or to flourish. That they had much to bear when linked\r\nwith the North, much to endure on account of that slavery from which\r\nit was all but impossible that they should disentangle themselves,\r\nmay probably be true. But so have all political parties among all\r\nfree nations much to bear from political opponents, and yet other\r\nfree nations do not go to pieces. Had it been possible that the\r\nslave-owners and slave properties should have been scattered in parts\r\nthrough all the States and not congregated in the South, the slave\r\nparty would have maintained itself as other parties do; but in such\r\ncase, as a matter of course, it would not have thought of secession.\r\nIt has been the close vicinity of slave-owners to each other,\r\nthe fact that their lands have been coterminous, that theirs was\r\nespecially a cotton district, which has tempted them to secession.\r\nThey have been tempted to secession, and will, as I think, still\r\nachieve it in those Gulf States,--much to their misfortune.\r\n\r\nAnd the fears of the North are, I think, equally wrong. That they\r\nwill be deceived as to that Monroe doctrine is no doubt more than\r\nprobable. That ambition for an entire continent under one rule will\r\nnot, I should say, be gratified. But not on that account need the\r\nnation be less great, or its civilization less extensive. That hook\r\nin its nose and that thorn in its jaw will, after all, be but a hook\r\nof the imagination and an ideal thorn. Do not all great men suffer\r\nsuch ere their greatness be established and acknowledged? There is\r\nscope enough for all that manhood can do between the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific, even though those hot, swampy cotton-fields be taken away;\r\neven though the snows of the British provinces be denied to them. And\r\nas for those rivers and that sea-board, the Americans of the North\r\nwill have lost much of their old energy and usual force of will, if\r\nany southern Confederacy be allowed to deny their right of way or to\r\nstop their commercial enterprises. I believe that the South will be\r\nbadly off without the North; but I feel certain that the North will\r\nnever miss the South when once the wounds to her pride have been\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nFrom Washington I journeyed back to Boston through the cities which\r\nI had visited in coming thither, and stayed again on my route for a\r\nfew days at Baltimore, at Philadelphia, and at New York. At each town\r\nthere were those whom I now regarded almost as old friends, and as\r\nthe time of my departure drew near I felt a sorrow that I was not to\r\nbe allowed to stay longer. As the general result of my sojourn in the\r\ncountry, I must declare that I was always happy and comfortable in\r\nthe eastern cities, and generally unhappy and uncomfortable in the\r\nWest. I had previously been inclined to think that I should like the\r\nroughness of the West, and that in the East I should encounter an\r\narrogance which would have kept me always on the verge of hot water;\r\nbut in both these surmises I found myself to have been wrong. And I\r\nthink that most English travellers would come to the same conclusion.\r\nThe western people do not mean to be harsh or uncivil, but they do\r\nnot make themselves pleasant. In all the eastern cities,--I speak of\r\nthe eastern cities north of Washington,--a society may be found which\r\nmust be esteemed as agreeable by Englishmen who like clever genial\r\nmen, and who love clever pretty women.\r\n\r\nI was forced to pass twice again over the road between New York and\r\nBoston, as the packet by which I intended to leave America was fixed\r\nto sail from the former port. I had promised myself, and had promised\r\nothers, that I would spend in Boston the last week of my sojourn in\r\nthe States, and this was a promise which I was by no means inclined\r\nto break. If there be a gratification in this world which has\r\nno alloy, it is that of going to an assured welcome. The belief\r\nthat men's arms and hearts are open to receive one,--and the arms\r\nand hearts of women, too, as far as they allow themselves to\r\nopen them,--is the salt of the earth, the sole remedy against\r\nsea-sickness, the only cure for the tedium of railways, the one\r\npreservative amidst all the miseries and fatigue of travel. These\r\nmatters are private, and should hardly be told of in a book; but in\r\nwriting of the States, I should not do justice to my own convictions\r\nof the country if I did not say how pleasantly social intercourse\r\nthere will ripen into friendship, and how full of love that\r\nfriendship may become. I became enamoured of Boston at last. Beacon\r\nStreet was very pleasant to me, and the view over Boston Common was\r\ndear to my eyes. Even the State House, with its great yellow-painted\r\ndome, became sightly; and the sunset over the western waters that\r\nencompass the city beats all other sunsets that I have seen.\r\n\r\nDuring my last week there the world of Boston was moving itself on\r\nsleighs. There was not a wheel to be seen in the town. The omnibuses\r\nand public carriages had been dismounted from their axles and put\r\nthemselves upon snow runners, and the private world had taken out its\r\nwinter carriages, and wrapped itself up in buffalo robes. Men now\r\nspoke of the coming thaw as of a misfortune which must come, but\r\nwhich a kind Providence might perhaps postpone,--as we all, in short,\r\nspeak of death. In the morning the snow would have been hardened by\r\nthe night's frost, and men would look happy and contented. By an hour\r\nafter noon the streets would be all wet, and the ground would be\r\nslushy and men would look gloomy and speak of speedy dissolution.\r\nThere were those who would always prophesy that the next day would\r\nsee the snow converted into one dull, dingy river. Such I regarded as\r\nseers of tribulation, and endeavoured with all my mind to disbelieve\r\ntheir interpretations of the signs. That sleighing was excellent fun.\r\nFor myself I must own that I hardly saw the best of it at Boston, for\r\nthe coming of the end was already at hand when I arrived there, and\r\nthe fresh beauty of the hard snow was gone. Moreover when I essayed\r\nto show my prowess with a pair of horses on the established course\r\nfor such equipages, the beasts ran away, knowing that I was not\r\npractised in the use of snow chariots, and brought me to grief and\r\nshame. There was a lady with me on the sleigh whom, for a while, I\r\nfelt that I was doomed to consign to a snowy grave,--whom I would\r\nwillingly have overturned into a drift of snow, so as to avoid worse\r\nconsequences, had I only known how to do so. But Providence, even\r\nthough without curbs and assisted only by simple snaffles, did at\r\nlast prevail; and I brought the sleigh, horses, and lady alive back\r\nto Boston, whether with or without permanent injury I have never yet\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nAt last the day of tribulation came, and the snow was picked up and\r\ncarted out of Boston. Gangs of men, standing shoulder to shoulder,\r\nwere at work along the chief streets, picking, shovelling, and\r\ndisposing of the dirty blocks. Even then the snow seemed to be nearly\r\na foot thick; but it was dirty, rough, half-melted in some places,\r\nthough hard as stone in others. The labour and cost of cleansing the\r\ncity in this way must be very great. The people were at it as I left,\r\nand I felt that the day of tribulation had in truth come.\r\n\r\nFarewell to thee, thou western Athens! When I have forgotten thee my\r\nright hand shall have forgotten its cunning, and my heart forgotten\r\nits pulses. Let us look at the list of names with which Boston has\r\nhonoured itself in our days, and then ask what other town of the same\r\nsize has done more. Prescott, Bancroft, Motley, Longfellow, Lowell,\r\nEmerson, Dana, Agassiz, Holmes, Hawthorne! Who is there among us\r\nin England who has not been the better for these men? Who does not\r\nowe to some of them a debt of gratitude? In whose ears is not their\r\nnames familiar? It is a bright galaxy and far extended, for so small\r\na city. What city has done better than this? All these men, save\r\none, are now alive and in the full possession of their powers. What\r\nother town of the same size has done as well in the same short space\r\nof time? It may be that this is the Augustan æra of Boston,--its\r\nElizabethan time. If so, I am thankful that my steps have wandered\r\nthither at such a period.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Boston I had the sad privilege of attending the\r\nfuneral of President Felton, the head of Harvard College. A few\r\nmonths before I had seen him a strong man, apparently in perfect\r\nhealth and in the pride of life. When I reached Boston, I heard of\r\nhis death. He also was an accomplished scholar, and as a Grecian\r\nhas left few behind him who were his equals. At his installation as\r\nPresident, four ex-Presidents of Harvard College assisted. Whether\r\nthey were all present at his funeral I do not know, but I do know\r\nthat they were all still living. These are Mr. Quincy, who is now\r\nover ninety; Mr. Sparks; Mr. Everett, the well-known orator; and Mr.\r\nWalker. They all reside in Boston or its neighbourhood, and will\r\nprobably all assist at the installation of another President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, I presume, universally known that the citizens of the\r\nWestern American colonies of Great Britain which revolted, declared\r\nthemselves to be free from British dominion by an Act which they\r\ncalled the Declaration of Independence. This was done on the 4th of\r\nJuly, 1776, and was signed by delegates from the thirteen colonies,\r\nor States as they then called themselves. These delegates in this\r\ndocument declare themselves to be the representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in general Congress assembled. The opening\r\nand close of this declaration have in them much that is grand\r\nand striking; the greater part of it, however, is given up to\r\nenumerating, in paragraph after paragraph, the sins committed by\r\nGeorge III. against the colonies. Poor George III.! There is no one\r\nnow to say a good word for him; but of all those who have spoken ill\r\nof him, this declaration is the loudest in its censure.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, on the 15th November, 1777, were drawn up\r\nthe Articles of Confederation between the States, by which it was\r\nthen intended that a sufficient bond and compact should be made for\r\ntheir future joint existence and preservation. A reference to this\r\ndocument, which, together with the Declaration of Independence and\r\nthe subsequently framed Constitution of the United States, is given\r\nin the Appendix, will show how slight was the then intended bond of\r\nunion between the States. The second article declares that each State\r\nretains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence. The third article\r\navows that \"the said States hereby severally enter into a firm league\r\nof friendship with each other for their common defence, the security\r\nof their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding\r\nthemselves to assist each other against all force offered to, or\r\nattacks made upon, them, or any of them, on account of religion,\r\nsovereignty, trade, or any other pretext whatever.\" And the third\r\narticle, \"the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship,\"\r\ndeclares that the free citizens of one State shall be free citizens\r\nof another. From this it is, I think, manifest that no idea of one\r\nunited nation had at that time been received and adopted by the\r\ncitizens of the States. The articles then go on to define the way\r\nin which Congress shall assemble and what shall be its powers. This\r\nCongress was to exercise the authority of a national Government\r\nrather than perform the work of a national Parliament. It was\r\nintended to be executive rather than legislative. It was to consist\r\nof delegates, the very number of which within certain limits was to\r\nbe left to the option of the individual States, and to this Congress\r\nwas to be confided certain duties and privileges, which could not\r\nbe performed or exercised separately by the Governments of the\r\nindividual States. One special article, the eleventh, enjoins that\r\n\"Canada, acceding to the Confederation, and joining in the measures\r\nof the United States, shall be admitted into and entitled to all\r\nthe advantages of this Union; but no other colony shall be admitted\r\ninto the same unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.\" I\r\nmention this to show how strong was the expectation at that time that\r\nCanada also would revolt from England. Up to this day few Americans\r\ncan understand why Canada has declined to join her lot to them.\r\n\r\nBut the compact between the different States made by the Articles of\r\nConfederation, and the mode of national procedure therein enjoined,\r\nwere found to be inefficient for the wants of a people who to be\r\ngreat must be united in fact as well as in name. The theory of the\r\nmost democratic among the Americans of that day was in favour of\r\nself-government carried to an extreme. Self-government was the Utopia\r\nwhich they had determined to realize, and they were unwilling to\r\ndiminish the reality of the self-government of the individual States\r\nby any centralization of power in one head, or in one Parliament, or\r\nin one set of ministers for the nation. For ten years, from 1777 to\r\n1787, the attempt was made; but then it was found that a stronger\r\nbond of nationality was indispensable, if any national greatness\r\nwas to be regarded as desirable. Indeed, all manner of failure had\r\nattended the mode of national action ordained by the Articles of\r\nConfederation. I am not attempting to write a history of the United\r\nStates, and will not therefore trouble my readers with historic\r\ndetails, which are not of value unless put forward with historic\r\nweight. The fact of the failure is however admitted, and the present\r\nwritten constitution of the United States, which is the splendid\r\nresult of that failure, was \"Done in Convention by the unanimous\r\nconsent of the States present.\"* Twelve States were present,--Rhode\r\nIsland apparently having had no representative on the occasion,--on\r\nthe 17th September, 1787, and in the twelfth year of the Independence\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n  *It must not, however, be supposed that by this \"doing in\r\n   convention,\" the constitution became an accepted fact. It simply\r\n   amounted to the adoption of a proposal of the constitution.\r\n   The constitution itself was formally adopted by the people in\r\n   conventions held in their separate State capitals. It was agreed\r\n   to by the people in 1788, and came into operation in 1789.\r\n\r\nI call the result splendid, seeing that under this constitution so\r\nwritten a nation has existed for three quarters of a century and\r\nhas grown in numbers, power, and wealth till it has made itself the\r\npolitical equal of the other greatest nations of the earth. And it\r\ncannot be said that it has so grown in spite of the constitution, or\r\nby ignoring the constitution. Hitherto the laws there laid down for\r\nthe national guidance have been found adequate for the great purpose\r\nassigned to them, and have done all that which the framers of them\r\nhoped that they might effect. We all know what has been the fate of\r\nthe constitutions which were written throughout the French revolution\r\nfor the use of France. We all, here in England, have the same\r\nludicrous conception of Utopian theories of government framed by\r\nphilosophical individuals who imagine that they have learned from\r\nbooks a perfect system of managing nations. To produce such theories\r\nis especially the part of a Frenchman; to disbelieve in them is\r\nespecially the part of an Englishman. But in the States a system of\r\ngovernment has been produced, under a written constitution, in which\r\nno Englishman can disbelieve, and which every Frenchman must envy.\r\nIt has done its work. The people have been free, well-educated,\r\nand politically great. Those among us who are most inclined at the\r\npresent moment to declare that the institutions of the United States\r\nhave failed, can at any rate only declare that they have failed in\r\ntheir finality; that they have shown themselves to be insufficient to\r\ncarry on the nation in its advancing strides through all times. They\r\ncannot deny that an amount of success and prosperity, much greater\r\nthan the nation even expected for itself, has been achieved under\r\nthis constitution and in connection with it. If it be so they cannot\r\ndisbelieve in it. Let those who now say that it is insufficient,\r\nconsider what their prophecies regarding it would have been had they\r\nbeen called on to express their opinions concerning it when it was\r\nproposed in 1787. If the future as it has since come forth had then\r\nbeen foretold for it, would not such a prophecy have been a prophecy\r\nof success? That constitution is now at the period of its hardest\r\ntrial, and at this moment one may hardly dare to speak of it with\r\ntriumph; but looking at the nation even in its present position, I\r\nthink I am justified in saying that its constitution is one in which\r\nno Englishman can disbelieve. When I also say that it is one which\r\nevery Frenchman must envy, perhaps I am improperly presuming that\r\nFrenchmen could not look at it with Englishmen's eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen the constitution came to be written, a man had arisen in the\r\nStates who was peculiarly suited for the work in hand; he was one\r\nof those men to whom the world owes much, and of whom the world in\r\ngeneral knows but little. This was Alexander Hamilton, who alone on\r\nthe part of the great State of New York signed the constitution of\r\nthe United States. The other States sent two, three, four, or more\r\ndelegates; New York sent Hamilton alone; but in sending him New York\r\nsent more to the constitution than all the other States together. I\r\nshould be hardly saying too much for Hamilton if I were to declare\r\nthat all those parts of the constitution emanated from him in which\r\npermanent political strength has abided. And yet his name has not\r\nbeen spread abroad widely in men's mouths. Of Jefferson, Franklin,\r\nand Madison, we have all heard; our children speak of them and they\r\nare household words in the nursery of history. Of Hamilton however it\r\nmay, I believe, be said that he was greater than any of those.\r\n\r\nWithout going with minuteness into the early contests of democracy\r\nin the United States, I think I may say that there soon arose two\r\nparties, each probably equally anxious in the cause of freedom,\r\none of which was conspicuous for its French predilections, and the\r\nother for its English aptitudes. It was the period of the French\r\nrevolution,--the time when the French revolution had in it as yet\r\nsomething of promise, and had not utterly disgraced itself. To many\r\nin America the French theory of democracy not unnaturally endeared\r\nitself, and foremost among these was Thomas Jefferson. He was the\r\nfather of those politicians in the States who have since taken the\r\nname of democrats, and in accordance with whose theory it has come to\r\npass that everything has been referred to the universal suffrage of\r\nthe people. James Madison, who succeeded Jefferson as President, was\r\na pupil in this school, as indeed have been most of the Presidents of\r\nthe United States. At the head of the other party, from which through\r\nvarious denominations have sprung those who now call themselves\r\nrepublicans, was Alexander Hamilton. I believe I may say that all the\r\npolitical sympathies of George Washington were with the same school.\r\nWashington, however, was rather a man of feeling and of action, than\r\nof theoretical policy or speculative opinion. When the constitution\r\nwas written, Jefferson was in France, having been sent thither as\r\nminister from the United States, and he therefore was debarred from\r\nconcerning himself personally in the matter. His views, however,\r\nwere represented by Madison, and it is now generally understood that\r\nthe Constitution, as it stands, is the joint work of Madison and\r\nHamilton.* The democratic bias, of which it necessarily contains\r\nmuch, and without which it could not have obtained the consent of\r\nthe people, was furnished by Madison; but the conservative elements,\r\nof which it possesses much more than superficial observers of the\r\nAmerican form of government are wont to believe, came from Hamilton.\r\n\r\n  *It should, perhaps, be explained that the views of Madison\r\n   were originally not opposed to those of Hamilton. Madison,\r\n   however, gradually adopted the policy of Jefferson,--his policy\r\n   rather than his philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe very preamble of the constitution at once declares that the\r\npeople of the different States do hereby join themselves together\r\nwith the view of forming themselves into one nation. \"We, the\r\npeople of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union,\r\nestablish justice, ensure domestic tranquillity, provide for the\r\ncommon defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings\r\nof liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish\r\nthis constitution for the United States of America.\" Here a great\r\nstep was made towards centralization,--towards one national\r\ngovernment and the binding together of the States into one nation.\r\nBut from that time down to the present, the contest has been going\r\non, sometimes openly and sometimes only within the minds of men,\r\nbetween the still alleged sovereignty of the individual States and\r\nthe acknowledged sovereignty of the central Congress and central\r\nGovernment. The disciples of Jefferson,--even though they have\r\nnot known themselves to be his disciples,--have been carrying on\r\nthat fight for State rights which has ended in secession; and the\r\ndisciples of Hamilton,--certainly not knowing themselves to be his\r\ndisciples,--have been making that stand for central government, and\r\nfor the one acknowledged republic, which is now at work in opposing\r\nsecession, and which, even though secession should to some extent\r\nbe accomplished, will, we may hope, nevertheless, and not the less\r\non account of such secession, conquer and put down the spirit of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe political contest of parties which is being waged now, and which\r\nhas been waged throughout the history of the United States, has\r\nbeen pursued on one side in support of that idea of an undivided\r\nnationality of which I have spoken,--of a nationality in which the\r\ninterests of a part should be esteemed as the interests of the whole;\r\nand on the other side it has been pursued in opposition to that idea.\r\nI will not here go into the interminable question of slavery,--though\r\nit is on that question that the southern or democratic States have\r\nmost loudly declared their own sovereign rights and their aversion to\r\nnational interference. Were I to do so I should fail in my present\r\nobject of explaining the nature of the constitution of the United\r\nStates. But I protest against any argument which shall be used to\r\nshow that the constitution has failed because it has allowed slavery\r\nto produce the present division among the States. I myself think that\r\nthe Southern or Gulf States will go. I will not pretend to draw the\r\nexact line, or to say how many of them are doomed; but I believe that\r\nSouth Carolina with Georgia, and perhaps five or six others, will be\r\nextruded from the Union. But their very extrusion will be a political\r\nsuccess, and will, in fact, amount to a virtual acknowledgment in\r\nthe body of the Union of the truth of that system for which the\r\nconservative republican party has contended. If the North obtain\r\nthe power of settling that question of boundary, the abandonment of\r\nthose southern States will be a success, even though the privilege of\r\nretaining them be the very point for which the North is now in arms.\r\n\r\nThe first clause of the constitution declares that all the\r\nlegislative powers granted by the constitution shall be vested\r\nin a Congress, which shall consist of a Senate and of a House of\r\nRepresentatives. The House of Representatives is to be rechosen every\r\ntwo years, and shall be elected by the people, such persons in each\r\nState having votes for the national Congress as have votes for the\r\nlegislature of their own States. If therefore South Carolina should\r\nchoose--as she has chosen--to declare that the electors of her own\r\nlegislature shall possess a property qualification, the electors\r\nof members of Congress from South Carolina must also have that\r\nqualification. In Massachusetts universal suffrage now prevails,\r\nalthough it is not long since a low property qualification prevailed\r\neven in Massachusetts. It therefore follows that members of the House\r\nof Representatives in Congress need by no means be all chosen on the\r\nsame principle. As a fact, universal suffrage* and vote by ballot,\r\nthat is by open voting papers, prevail in the States, but they do not\r\nso prevail by virtue of any enactment of the constitution. The laws\r\nof the States, however, require that the voter shall have been a\r\nresident in the State for some period, and generally either deny\r\nthe right of voting to negroes, or so hamper that privilege that\r\npractically it amounts to the same thing.\r\n\r\n  *Perhaps the better word would have been manhood suffrage;\r\n   and even that word should be taken with certain restrictions.\r\n   Aliens, minors, convicts, and men who pay no taxes cannot vote.\r\n   In some States none can vote unless they can read and write.\r\n   In some there is a property qualification. In all there are\r\n   special restrictions against negroes. There is in none an\r\n   absolutely universal suffrage. But I keep the name as it best\r\n   expresses to us in England the system of franchise which has\r\n   practically come to prevail in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senate of the United States is composed of two senators from each\r\nState. These senators are chosen for six years, and are elected in a\r\nmanner which shows the conservative tendency of the constitution with\r\nmore signification than perhaps any other rule which it contains.\r\nThis branch of Congress, which, as I shall presently endeavour to\r\nshow, is by far the more influential of the two, is not in any way\r\nelected by the people. \"The Senate of the United States shall be\r\ncomposed of two senators from each State, _chosen by the legislature\r\nthereof_, for six years, and each senator shall have one voice.\"\r\nThe Senate sent to Congress is therefore elected by the State\r\nlegislatures. Each State legislature has two Houses; and the senators\r\nsent from that State to Congress are either chosen by vote of the\r\ntwo Houses voting together--which is, I believe, the mode adopted\r\nin most States, or are voted for in the two Houses separately--in\r\nwhich cases, when different candidates have been nominated, the\r\ntwo Houses confer by committees and settle the matter between them.\r\nThe conservative purpose of the constitution is here sufficiently\r\nevident. The intention has been to take the election of the senators\r\naway from the people, and to confide it to that body in each State\r\nwhich may be regarded as containing its best trusted citizens. It\r\nremoves the senators far away from the democratic element, and\r\nrenders them liable to the necessity of no popular canvas. Nor am I\r\naware that the constitution has failed in keeping the ground which it\r\nintended to hold in this matter. On some points its selected rocks\r\nand chosen standing ground have slipped from beneath its feet, owing\r\nto the weakness of words in defining and making solid the intended\r\nprohibitions against democracy. The wording of the constitution has\r\nbeen regarded by the people as sacred; but the people has considered\r\nitself justified in opposing the spirit as long as it revered the\r\nletter of the constitution. And this was natural. For the letter\r\nof the constitution can be read by all men; but its spirit can be\r\nunderstood comparatively but by few. As regards the election of the\r\nsenators, I believe that it has been fairly made by the legislatures\r\nof the different States. I have not heard it alleged that members\r\nof the State legislatures have been frequently constrained by\r\nthe outside popular voice to send this or that man as senator to\r\nWashington. It was clearly not the intention of those who wrote the\r\nconstitution that they should be so constrained. But the Senators\r\nthemselves in Washington have submitted to restraint. On subjects in\r\nwhich the people are directly interested they submit to instructions\r\nfrom the legislatures which have sent them as to the side on which\r\nthey shall vote, and justify themselves in voting against their\r\nconvictions by the fact that they have received such instructions.\r\nSuch a practice, even with the members of a House which has been\r\ndirectly returned by popular election, is, I think, false to the\r\nintention of the system. It has clearly been intended that confidence\r\nshould be put in the chosen candidate for the term of his duty,\r\nand that the electors are to be bound in the expression of their\r\nopinion by his sagacity and patriotism for that term. A member of\r\na representative House so chosen, who votes at the bidding of his\r\nconstituency in opposition to his convictions, is manifestly false to\r\nhis charge, and may be presumed to be thus false in deference to his\r\nown personal interests, and with a view to his own future standing\r\nwith his constituents. Pledges before election may be fair, because\r\na pledge given is after all but the answer to a question asked. A\r\nvoter may reasonably desire to know a candidate's opinion on any\r\nmatter of political interest before he votes for or against him.\r\nThe representative when returned should be free from the necessity\r\nof further pledges. But if this be true with a House elected by\r\npopular suffrage, how much more than true must it be with a chamber\r\ncollected together as the Senate of the United States is collected!\r\nNevertheless it is the fact that many senators, especially those\r\nwho have been sent to the House as democrats, do allow the State\r\nlegislatures to dictate to them their votes, and that they do hold\r\nthemselves absolved from the personal responsibility of their\r\nvotes by such dictation. This is one place in which the rock which\r\nwas thought to have been firm has slipped away, and the sands of\r\ndemocracy have made their way through. But with reference to this it\r\nis always in the power of the Senate to recover its own ground, and\r\nre-establish its own dignity; to the people in this matter the words\r\nof the constitution give no authority, and all that is necessary for\r\nthe recovery of the old practice is a more conservative tendency\r\nthroughout the country generally. That there is such a conservative\r\ntendency no one can doubt; the fear is whether it may not work too\r\nquickly and go too far.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of these instructions given to senators at Washington,\r\nI should explain that such instructions are not given by all States,\r\nnor are they obeyed by all senators. Occasionally they are made in\r\nthe form of requests, the word \"instruct\" being purposely laid aside.\r\nRequests of the same kind are also made to representatives, who, as\r\nthey are not returned by the State legislatures, are not considered\r\nto be subject to such instructions. The form used is as follows: \"We\r\ninstruct our senators and request our representatives,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe senators are elected for six years, but the same Senate does not\r\nsit entire throughout that term. The whole chamber is divided into\r\nthree equal portions or classes, and a portion goes out at the end of\r\nevery second year; so that a third of the Senate comes in afresh with\r\nevery new House of Representatives. The Vice-President of the United\r\nStates, who is elected with the President, and who is not a senator\r\nby election from any State, is the ex-officio President of the\r\nSenate. Should the President of the United States vacate his seat\r\nby death or otherwise, the Vice-President becomes President of the\r\nUnited States; and in such case the Senate elects its own President\r\npro tempore.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Senate, I must point out a matter to which the\r\nconstitution does not allude, but which is of the gravest moment in\r\nthe political fabric of the nation. Each State sends two senators\r\nto Congress. These two are sent altogether independently of the\r\npopulation which they represent, or of the number of members which\r\nthe same State supplies to the Lower House. When the constitution\r\nwas framed, Delaware was to send one member to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, and Pennsylvania eight; nevertheless, each of these\r\nStates sent two senators. It would seem strange that a young people,\r\ncommencing business as a nation on a basis intended to be democratic,\r\nshould consent to a system so directly at variance with the theory of\r\npopular representation. It reminds one of the old days when Yorkshire\r\nreturned two members, and Rutlandshire two also. And the discrepancy\r\nhas greatly increased as young States have been added to the Union,\r\nwhile the old States have increased in population. New York, with a\r\npopulation of about 4,000,000, and with thirty-three members in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, sends two senators to Congress. The new\r\nState of Oregon, with a population of 50,000 or 60,000, and with one\r\nmember in the House of Representatives, sends also two senators to\r\nCongress. But though it would seem that in such a distribution of\r\nlegislative power, the young nation was determined to preserve some\r\nof the old fantastic traditions of the mother-country which it had\r\njust repudiated; the fact, I believe, is that this system, apparently\r\nso opposed to all democratic tendencies, was produced and specially\r\ninsisted upon by democracy itself. Where would be the State\r\nsovereignty and individual existence of Rhode Island and Delaware,\r\nunless they could maintain, in at least one House of Congress, their\r\nState equality with that of all other States in the Union? In those\r\nearly days, when the constitution was being framed, there was nothing\r\nto force the small States into a Union with those whose populations\r\npreponderated. Each State was sovereign in its municipal system,\r\nhaving preserved the boundaries of the old colony, together with the\r\nliberties and laws given to it under its old colonial charter. A\r\nunion might be, and no doubt was, desirable; but it was to be a union\r\nof sovereign States, each retaining equal privileges in that union,\r\nand not a fusion of the different populations into one homogeneous\r\nwhole. No State was willing to abandon its own individuality, and\r\nleast of all were the small States willing to do so. It was therefore\r\nordained that the House of Representatives should represent the\r\npeople, and that the Senate should represent the States.\r\n\r\nFrom that day to the present time the arrangement of which I am\r\nspeaking has enabled the democratic or southern party to contend\r\nat a great advantage with the republicans of the North. When the\r\nconstitution was founded, the seven northern States--I call those\r\nnorthern which are now free-soil States, and those southern in which\r\nthe institution of slavery now prevails--the seven northern States\r\nwere held to be entitled by their population to send thirty-five\r\nmembers to the House of Representatives, and they sent fourteen\r\nmembers to the Senate. The six southern States were entitled to\r\nthirty members in the Lower House, and to twelve senators. Thus the\r\nproportion was about equal for the North and South. But now,--or\r\nrather in 1860, when secession commenced,--the northern States,\r\nowing to the increase of population in the North, sent one hundred\r\nand fifty representatives to Congress, having nineteen States and\r\nthirty-eight senators; whereas the South, with fifteen States and\r\nthirty senators, was entitled by its population to only ninety\r\nrepresentatives, although by a special rule in its favour, which\r\nI will presently explain, it was in fact allowed a greater number\r\nof representatives in proportion to its population than the North.\r\nHad an equal balance been preserved, the South, with its ninety\r\nrepresentatives in the Lower House, would have but twenty-three\r\nsenators, instead of thirty, in the Upper.* But these numbers\r\nindicate to us the recovery of political influence in the North,\r\nrather than the pride of the power of the South; for the South,\r\nin its palmy days, had much more in its favour than I have above\r\ndescribed as its position in 1860. Kansas had then just become a\r\nfree-soil State, after a terrible struggle, and shortly previous\r\nto that Oregon and Minnesota, also free States, had been added to\r\nthe Union. Up to that date the slave States sent thirty senators to\r\nCongress, and the free States only thirty-two. In addition to this\r\nwhen Texas was annexed and converted into a State, a clause was\r\ninserted into the Act giving authority for the future subdivision\r\nof that State into four different States as its population should\r\nincrease, thereby enabling the South to add senators to its own party\r\nfrom time to time, as the northern States might increase in number.\r\n\r\n  *It is worthy of note that the new northern and western States\r\n   have been brought into the Union by natural increase and the\r\n   spread of population. But this has not been so with the new\r\n   southern States. Louisiana and Florida were purchased, and Texas\r\n   was--annexed.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must explain, in order that the nature of the contest may\r\nbe understood, that the senators from the South maintained themselves\r\never in a compact body, voting together, true to each other,\r\ndisciplined as a party, understanding the necessity of yielding in\r\nsmall things in order that their general line of policy might be\r\nmaintained. But there was no such system, no such observance of\r\npolitical tactics among the senators of the North. Indeed, they\r\nappear to have had no general line of politics, having been divided\r\namong themselves on various matters. Many had strong southern\r\ntendencies, and many more were willing to obtain official power by\r\nthe help of southern votes. There was no great bond of union among\r\nthem, as slavery was among the senators from the South. And thus,\r\nfrom these causes, the power of the Senate and the power of the\r\nGovernment fell into the hands of the southern party.\r\n\r\nI am aware that in going into these matters here I am departing\r\nsomewhat from the subject of which this chapter is intended to treat;\r\nbut I do not know that I could explain in any shorter way the manner\r\nin which those rules of the constitution have worked by which the\r\ncomposition of the Senate is fixed. That State basis, as opposed to a\r\nbasis of population in the Upper House of Congress, has been the one\r\ngreat political weapon, both of offence and defence, in the hands of\r\nthe democratic party. And yet I am not prepared to deny that great\r\nwisdom was shown in the framing of the constitution of the Senate. It\r\nwas the object of none of the politicians then at work to create a\r\ncode of rules for the entire governance of a single nation such as\r\nis England or France. Nor, had any American politician of the time\r\nso desired, would he have had reasonable hope of success. A federal\r\nunion of separate sovereign States was the necessity, as it was also\r\nthe desire, of all those who were concerned in the American policy of\r\nthe day; and I think it may be understood and maintained that no such\r\nfederal union would have been just, or could have been accepted by\r\nthe smaller States, which did not in some direct way recognize their\r\nequality with the larger States. It is moreover to be observed, that\r\nin this, as in all matters, the claims of the minority were treated\r\nwith indulgence. No ordinance of the constitution is made in a\r\nniggardly spirit. It would seem as though they who met together to\r\ndo the work had been actuated by no desire for selfish preponderance\r\nor individual influence. No ambition to bind close by words which\r\nshall be exacting as well as exact is apparent. A very broad power of\r\ninterpretation is left to those who were to be the future\r\ninterpreters of the written document.\r\n\r\nIt is declared that \"Representation and direct taxes shall be\r\napportioned among the several States which may be included within\r\nthis Union according to their respective numbers,\" thereby meaning\r\nthat representation and taxation in the several States shall be\r\nadjusted according to the population. This clause ordains that\r\nthroughout all the States a certain amount of population shall\r\nreturn a member to the Lower House of Congress,--say one member to\r\n100,000 persons, as is I believe about the present proportion,--and\r\nthat direct taxation shall be levied according to the number of\r\nrepresentatives. If New York return thirty-three members and Kansas\r\none, on New York shall be levied, for the purposes of the United\r\nStates' revenue, thirty-three times as much direct taxation as on\r\nKansas. This matter of direct taxation was not then, nor has it been\r\nsince, matter of much moment. No direct taxation has hitherto been\r\nlevied in the United States for national purposes. But the time has\r\nnow come when this proviso will be a terrible stumbling-block in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nBut before we go into that matter of taxation, I must explain how the\r\nSouth was again favoured with reference to its representation. As a\r\nmatter of course no slaves, or even negroes--no men of colour--were\r\nto vote in the southern States. Therefore, one would say, that\r\nin counting up the people with reference to the number of the\r\nrepresentatives, the coloured population should be ignored\r\naltogether. But it was claimed on behalf of the South that their\r\nproperty in slaves should be represented, and in compliance with this\r\nclaim, although no slave can vote or in any way demand the services\r\nof a representative, the coloured people are reckoned among the\r\npopulation. When the numbers of the free persons are counted, to this\r\nnumber is added \"three-fifths of all other persons.\" Five slaves are\r\nthus supposed to represent three white persons. From the wording,\r\none would be led to suppose that there was some other category into\r\nwhich a man might be put besides that of free or slave! But it may\r\nbe observed, that on this subject of slavery the framers of the\r\nconstitution were tender-mouthed. They never speak of slavery or\r\nof a slave. It is necessary that the subject should be mentioned,\r\nand therefore we hear first of persons other than free, and then of\r\npersons bound to labour!\r\n\r\nSuch were the rules laid down for the formation of Congress, and the\r\nletter of those rules has, I think, been strictly observed. I have\r\nnot thought it necessary to give all the clauses, but I believe I\r\nhave stated those which are essential to a general understanding of\r\nthe basis upon which Congress is founded. A reference to the Appendix\r\nwill show all those which I have omitted.\r\n\r\nThe constitution ordains that members of both the Houses shall be\r\npaid for their time, but it does not decree the amount. \"The senators\r\nand representatives shall receive a compensation for their services,\r\nto be ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United\r\nStates.\" In the remarks which I have made as to the present Congress\r\nI have spoken of the amount now allowed. The understanding, I\r\nbelieve, is that the pay shall be enough for the modest support of\r\na man who is supposed to have raised himself above the heads of the\r\ncrowd. Much may be said in favour of this payment of legislators,\r\nbut very much may also be said against it. There was a time when our\r\nmembers of the House of Commons were entitled to payment for their\r\nservices, and when, at any rate, some of them took the money. It\r\nmay be that with a new nation such an arrangement was absolutely\r\nnecessary. Men whom the people could trust, and who would have been\r\nable to give up their time without payment, would not have probably\r\nbeen found in a new community. The choice of senators and of\r\nrepresentatives would have been so limited that the legislative power\r\nwould have fallen into the hands of a few rich men. Indeed it may be\r\nsaid that such payment was absolutely necessary in the early days\r\nof the life of the Union. But no one, I think, will deny that the\r\ntone of both Houses would be raised by the gratuitous service of the\r\nlegislators. It is well known that politicians find their way into\r\nthe Senate and into the Chamber of Representatives solely with a\r\nview to the loaves and fishes. The very word \"politician\" is foul\r\nand unsavoury throughout the States, and means rather a political\r\nblackleg than a political patriot. It is useless to blink this matter\r\nin speaking of the politics and policy of the United States. The\r\ncorruption of the venial politicians of the nation stinks aloud in\r\nthe nostrils of all men. It behoves the country to look to this.\r\nIt is time now that she should do so. The people of the nation are\r\neducated and clever. The women are bright and beautiful. Her charity\r\nis profuse; her philanthropy is eager and true; her national ambition\r\nis noble and honest,--honest in the cause of civilization. But she\r\nhas soiled herself with political corruption, and has disgraced the\r\ncause of republican government by the dirt of those whom she has\r\nplaced in her high places. Let her look to it now. She is nobly\r\nambitious of reputation throughout the earth; she desires to be\r\ncalled good as well as great; to be regarded not only as powerful,\r\nbut also as beneficent. She is creating an army; she is forging\r\ncannon and preparing to build impregnable ships of war. But all these\r\nwill fail to satisfy her pride, unless she can cleanse herself from\r\nthat corruption by which her political democracy has debased itself.\r\nA politician should be a man worthy of all honour, in that he loves\r\nhis country; and not one worthy of all contempt, in that he robs his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI must not be understood as saying that every senator and\r\nrepresentative who takes his pay is wrong in taking it. Indeed, I\r\nhave already expressed an opinion that such payments were at first\r\nnecessary, and I by no means now say that the necessity has as yet\r\ndisappeared. In the minds of thorough democrats it will be considered\r\nmuch that the poorest man of the people should be enabled to go into\r\nthe legislature, if such poorest man be worthy of that honour. I am\r\nnot a thorough democrat, and consider that more would be gained by\r\nobtaining in the legislature that education, demeanour, and freedom\r\nfrom political temptation which easy circumstances produce. I am not,\r\nhowever, on this account inclined to quarrel with the democrats,--not\r\non that account if they can so manage their affairs that their poor\r\nand popular politicians shall be fairly honest men. But I am a\r\nthorough republican, regarding our own English form of government\r\nas the most purely republican that I know, and as such I have a\r\nclose and warm sympathy with those trans-Atlantic anti-monarchical\r\nrepublicans who are endeavouring to prove to the world that they have\r\nat length founded a political Utopia. I for one do not grudge them\r\nall the good they can do, all the honour they can win. But I grieve\r\nover the evil name which now taints them, and which has accompanied\r\nthat wider spread of democracy which the last twenty years has\r\nproduced. This longing for universal suffrage in all things--in\r\nvoting for the President, in voting for judges, in voting for the\r\nrepresentatives, in dictating to senators, has come up since the days\r\nof President Jackson, and with it has come corruption and unclean\r\nhands. Democracy must look to it, or the world at large will declare\r\nher to have failed.\r\n\r\nOne would say that at any rate the Senate might be filled with unpaid\r\nservants of the public. Each State might surely find two men who\r\ncould afford to attend to the public weal of their country without\r\nclaiming a compensation for their time. In England we find no\r\ndifficulty in being so served. Those cities among us in which the\r\ndemocratic element most strongly abounds, can procure representatives\r\nto their mind--even though the honour of filling the position is not\r\nonly not remunerative, but is very costly. I cannot but think that\r\nthe Senate of the United States would stand higher in the public\r\nestimation of its own country if it were an unpaid body of men.\r\n\r\nIt is enjoined that no person holding any office under the United\r\nStates shall be a member of either House during his continuance in\r\noffice. At first sight such a rule as this appears to be good in\r\nits nature; but a comparison of the practice of the United States'\r\nGovernment with that of our own makes me think that this embargo\r\non members of the legislative bodies is a mistake. It prohibits\r\nthe President's ministers from a seat in either House, and thereby\r\nrelieves them from the weight of that responsibility to which our\r\nministers are subjected. It is quite true that the United States'\r\nministers cannot be responsible as are our ministers, seeing that\r\nthe President himself is responsible and that the Queen is not so.\r\nIndeed, according to the theory of the American constitution, the\r\nPresident has no ministers. The constitution speaks only of the\r\nprincipal officers of the executive departments. \"He,\" the President,\r\n\"may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each\r\nof the executive departments.\" But in practice he has his cabinet,\r\nand the irresponsibility of that cabinet would practically cease\r\nif the members of it were subjected to the questionings of the two\r\nHouses. With us the rule which prohibits servants of the State from\r\ngoing into Parliament is, like many of our constitutional rules, hard\r\nto be defined, and yet perfectly understood. It may perhaps be said,\r\nwith the nearest approach to a correct definition, that permanent\r\nservants of the State may not go into Parliament, and that those may\r\ndo so whose services are political, depending for the duration of\r\ntheir term on the duration of the existing ministry. But even this\r\nwould not be exact, seeing that the Master of the Rolls and the\r\nofficers of the army and navy can sit in Parliament. The absence\r\nof the President's ministers from Congress certainly occasions\r\nmuch confusion, or rather prohibits a more thorough political\r\nunderstanding between the executive and the legislative than now\r\nexists. In speaking of the Government of the United States in the\r\nnext chapter, I shall be constrained to allude again to this\r\nsubject.*\r\n\r\n  *It will be alleged by Americans that the introduction into\r\n   Congress of the President's ministers would alter all the\r\n   existing relations of the President and of Congress, and would\r\n   at once produce that Parliamentary form of Government which\r\n   England possesses, and which the States have chosen to avoid.\r\n   Such a change would elevate Congress, and depress the President.\r\n   No doubt this is true. Such elevation, however, and such\r\n   depression seem to me to be the two things needed.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the House of Representatives are solely legislative.\r\nThose of the Senate are legislative and executive--as with us those\r\nof the Upper House are legislative and judicial. The House of\r\nRepresentatives is always open to the public. The Senate is so open\r\nwhen it is engaged on legislative work; but it is closed to the\r\npublic when engaged in executive session. No treaties can be made by\r\nthe President, and no appointments to high offices confirmed without\r\nthe consent of the Senate; and this consent must be given--as regards\r\nthe confirmation of treaties--by two-thirds of the members present.\r\nThis law gives to the Senate the power of debating with closed\r\ndoors upon the nature of all treaties, and upon the conduct of the\r\nGovernment as evinced in the nomination of the officers of State.\r\nIt also gives to the Senate a considerable control over the foreign\r\nrelations of the Government. I believe that this power is often used,\r\nand that by it the influence of the Senate is raised much above\r\nthat of the Lower House. This influence is increased again by the\r\nadvantage of that superior statecraft and political knowledge which\r\nthe six years of the senator gives him over the two years of the\r\nrepresentative. The tried representative, moreover, very frequently\r\nblossoms into a senator; but a senator does not frequently fade into\r\na representative. Such occasionally is the case, and it is not even\r\nunconstitutional for an ex-President to re-appear in either House.\r\nMr. Benton, after thirty years' service in the Senate, sat in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. Mr. Crittenden, who was returned as senator\r\nby Kentucky, I think seven times, now sits in the Lower House; and\r\nJohn Quincy Adams appeared as a representative from Massachusetts\r\nafter he had filled the Presidential chair.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, the Senate of the United States is not debarred from\r\nan interference with money bills, as the House of Lords is debarred\r\nwith us. \"All bills for raising revenue,\" says the seventh section\r\nof the first article of the constitution, \"shall originate with the\r\nHouse of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with\r\namendments as on other bills.\" By this the Senate is enabled to have\r\nan authority in the money matters of the nation almost equal to that\r\nheld by the Lower House,--an authority quite sufficient to preserve\r\nto it the full influence of its other powers. With us the House\r\nof Commons is altogether in the ascendant, because it holds and\r\njealously keeps to itself the exclusive command of the public purse.\r\n\r\nCongress can levy custom duties in the United States, and always has\r\ndone so; hitherto the national revenue has been exclusively raised\r\nfrom custom duties. It cannot levy duties on imports. It can levy\r\nexcise duties, and is now doing so; hitherto it has not done so. It\r\ncan levy direct taxes, such as an income-tax and a property-tax; it\r\nhitherto has not done so, but now must do so. It must do so, I think\r\nI am justified in saying; but its power of doing this is so hampered\r\nby constitutional enactment, that it would seem that the constitution\r\nas regards this heading must be altered before any scheme can be\r\narranged by which a moderately just income-tax can be levied and\r\ncollected. This difficulty I have already mentioned, but perhaps it\r\nwill be well that I should endeavour to make the subject more plain.\r\nIt is specially declared, \"That all duties, imposts, and excises\r\nshall be uniform throughout the United States.\" And again, \"That no\r\ncapitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion\r\nto the census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken.\" And\r\nagain, in the words before quoted, \"Representatives and direct taxes\r\nshall be apportioned among the several States which shall be included\r\nin this Union, according to their respective numbers.\" By these\r\nrepeated rules it has been intended to decree that the separate\r\nStates shall bear direct taxation according to their population and\r\nthe consequent number of their representatives; and this intention\r\nhas been made so clear, that no direct taxation can be levied in\r\nopposition to it without an evident breach of the constitution. To\r\nexplain the way in which this will work, I will name the two States\r\nof Rhode Island and Iowa as opposed to each other, and the two States\r\nof Massachusetts and Indiana as opposed to each other. Rhode Island\r\nand Massachusetts are wealthy Atlantic States, containing, as regards\r\nenterprise and commercial success, the cream of the population of the\r\nUnited States. Comparing them in the ratio of population, I believe\r\nthat they are richer than any other States. They return between them\r\nthirteen representatives, Rhode Island sending two and Massachusetts\r\neleven. Iowa and Indiana also send thirteen representatives, Iowa\r\nsending two, and being thus equal to Rhode Island; Indiana sending\r\neleven and being thus equal to Massachusetts. Iowa and Indiana are\r\nwestern States; and though I am not prepared to say that they are\r\nthe poorest States of the Union, I can assert that they are exactly\r\nopposite in their circumstances to Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\r\nThe two Atlantic States of New England are old established, rich,\r\nand commercial. The two western States I have named are full of\r\nnew immigrants, are comparatively poor, and are agricultural.\r\nNevertheless any direct taxation levied on those in the East and\r\non those in the West must be equal in its weight. Iowa must pay as\r\nmuch as Rhode Island; Indiana must pay as much as Massachusetts.\r\nBut Rhode Island and Massachusetts could pay without the sacrifice\r\nof any comfort to its people, without any sensible suffering, an\r\namount of direct taxation which would crush the States of Iowa and\r\nIndiana,--which indeed no tax-gatherer could collect out of those\r\nStates. Rhode Island and Massachusetts could with their ready money\r\nbuy Iowa and Indiana; and yet the income-tax to be collected from\r\nthe poor States is to be the same in amount as that collected from\r\nthe rich States. Within each individual State the total amount of\r\nincome-tax or of other direct taxation to be levied from that State\r\nmay be apportioned as the State may think fit; but an income-tax of\r\ntwo per cent. on Rhode Island would probably produce more than an\r\nincome-tax of ten per cent. in Iowa; whereas Rhode Island could pay\r\nan income-tax of ten per cent. easier than could Iowa one of two per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIt would in fact appear that the constitution as at present framed is\r\nfatal to all direct taxation. Any law for the collection of direct\r\ntaxation levied under the constitution would produce internecine\r\nquarrel between the western States and those which border on the\r\nAtlantic. The western States would not submit to the taxation. The\r\ndifficulty which one here feels is that which always attends an\r\nattempt at finality in political arrangements. One would be inclined\r\nto say at once that the law should be altered, and that as the money\r\nrequired is for the purposes of the Union and for State purposes,\r\nsuch a change should be made as would enable Congress to levy an\r\nincome-tax on the general income of the nation. But Congress cannot\r\ngo beyond the constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the constitution is not final, and that it contains\r\nan express article ordaining the manner in which it may be amended.\r\nAnd perhaps I may as well explain here the manner in which this can\r\nbe done, although by doing so, I am departing from the order in which\r\nthe constitution is written. It is not final, and amendments have\r\nbeen made to it. But the making of such amendments is an operation\r\nso ponderous and troublesome, that the difficulty attached to any\r\nsuch change envelops the constitution with many of the troubles of\r\nfinality. With us there is nothing beyond an act of parliament. An\r\nact of parliament with us cannot be unconstitutional. But no such\r\npower has been confided to Congress, or to Congress and the President\r\ntogether. No amendment of the constitution can be made without\r\nthe sanction of the State legislatures. Congress may propose any\r\namendments, as to the expediency of which two-thirds of both Houses\r\nshall be agreed; but before such amendments can be accepted they must\r\nbe ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States, or\r\nby conventions in three-fourths of the States, \"as the one or the\r\nother mode of ratification may be proposed by Congress.\" Or Congress,\r\ninstead of proposing the amendments, may, on an application from the\r\nlegislatures of two-thirds of the different States, call a convention\r\nfor the proposing of them. In which latter case the ratification by\r\nthe different States must be made after the same fashion as that\r\nrequired in the former case. I do not know that I have succeeded\r\nin making clearly intelligible the circumstances under which the\r\nconstitution can be amended; but I think I may have succeeded in\r\nexplaining that those circumstances are difficult and tedious. In a\r\nmatter of taxation why should States agree to an alteration proposed\r\nwith the very object of increasing their proportion of the national\r\nburden? But unless such States will agree,--unless Rhode Island,\r\nMassachusetts, and New York will consent to put their own necks into\r\nthe yoke,--direct taxation cannot be levied on them in a manner\r\navailable for national purposes. I do believe that Rhode Island and\r\nMassachusetts at present possess a patriotism sufficient for such an\r\nact. But the mode of doing the work will create disagreement, or at\r\nany rate, tedious delay and difficulty. How shall the constitution be\r\nconstitutionally amended while one-third of the States are in revolt?\r\n\r\nIn the eighth section of its first article the Constitution gives\r\na list of the duties which Congress shall perform,--of things, in\r\nshort, which it shall do, or shall have power to do:--To raise taxes;\r\nto regulate commerce and the naturalization of citizens; to coin\r\nmoney and protect it when coined; to establish postal communication;\r\nto make laws for defence of patents and copyrights; to constitute\r\nnational courts of law inferior to the Supreme Court; to punish\r\npiracies; to declare war; to raise, pay for, and govern armies,\r\nnavies, and militia; and to exercise exclusive legislation in a\r\ncertain district which shall contain the seat of Government of the\r\nUnited States, and which is therefore to be regarded as belonging to\r\nthe nation at large, and not to any particular State. This district\r\nis now called the district of Columbia. It is situated on the Potomac\r\nand contains the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nThen the ninth section of the same article declares what Congress\r\nshall not do. Certain immigration shall not be prohibited; _the\r\nprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended_,\r\nexcept under certain circumstances; no ex post facto law shall be\r\npassed; no direct tax shall be laid unless in proportion to the\r\ncensus; no tax shall be laid on exports; no money shall be drawn from\r\nthe treasury but by legal appropriation; no title of nobility shall\r\nbe granted.\r\n\r\nThe above are lists or catalogues of the powers which Congress has,\r\nand of the powers which Congress has not; of what Congress may do,\r\nand of what Congress may not do; and having given them thus seriatim,\r\nI may here perhaps be best enabled to say a few words as to the\r\nsuspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the\r\nUnited States. It is generally known that this privilege has been\r\nsuspended during the existence of the present rebellion very many\r\ntimes; that this has been done by the executive, and not by Congress;\r\nand that it is maintained by the executive, and by those who defend\r\nthe conduct of the now acting executive of the United States, that\r\nthe power of suspending the writ has been given by the constitution\r\nto the President, and not to Congress. I confess that I cannot\r\nunderstand how any man, familiar either with the wording or with the\r\nspirit of the constitution should hold such an argument. To me it\r\nappears manifest that the executive, in suspending the privilege of\r\nthe writ without the authority of Congress, has committed a breach\r\nof the constitution. Were the case one referring to our British\r\nconstitution, a plain man, knowing little of Parliamentary usage,\r\nand nothing of law lore, would probably feel some hesitation in\r\nexpressing any decided opinion on such a subject, seeing that our\r\nconstitution is unwritten. But the intention has been that every\r\ncitizen of the United States should know and understand the rules\r\nunder which he is to live,--and he that runs may read.\r\n\r\nAs this matter has been argued by Mr. Horace Binney, a lawyer of\r\nPhiladelphia, much trusted, of very great and of deserved eminence\r\nthroughout the States, in a pamphlet in which he defends the\r\nsuspension of the privilege of the writ by the President, I will take\r\nthe position of the question as summed up by him in his last page,\r\nand compare it with that clause in the constitution by which the\r\nsuspension of the privilege under certain circumstances is decreed;\r\nand to enable me to do this I will, in the first place, quote the\r\nwords of the clause in question:--\r\n\r\n\"The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended\r\nunless when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may\r\nrequire it.\" It is the second clause of that section which states\r\nwhat Congress shall not do.\r\n\r\nMr. Binney argues as follows:--\"The conclusion of the whole matter\r\nis this: that the constitution itself is the law of the privilege,\r\nand of the exception to it; that the exception is expressed in the\r\nconstitution, and that the constitution gives effect to the act of\r\nsuspension when the conditions occur; that the conditions consist of\r\ntwo matters of fact,--one a naked matter of fact, and the other a\r\nmatter-of-fact conclusion from facts, that is to say, rebellion and\r\nthe public danger, or the requirement of public safety.\" By these\r\nwords Mr. Binney intends to imply that the constitution itself gave\r\nthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and itself prescribes the\r\ntaking away of that privilege under certain circumstances. But this\r\nis not so. The constitution does not prescribe the suspension of the\r\nprivilege of the writ under any circumstances. It says that it shall\r\nnot be suspended except under certain circumstances. Mr. Binney's\r\nargument, if I understand it, then goes on as follows. As the\r\nconstitution prescribes the circumstances under which the privilege\r\nof the writ shall be suspended, the one circumstance being the naked\r\nmatter-of-fact rebellion, and the other circumstance the public\r\nsafety supposed to have been endangered by such rebellion,--which Mr.\r\nBinney calls a matter-of-fact conclusion from facts, the constitution\r\nmust be presumed itself to suspend the privilege of the writ. Whether\r\nthe President or Congress be the agent of the constitution in this\r\nsuspension is not matter of moment. Either can only be an agent,\r\nand as Congress cannot act executively, whereas the President must\r\nultimately be charged with the executive administration of the\r\norder for that suspension, which has in fact been issued by the\r\nconstitution itself, therefore the power of exercising the suspension\r\nof the writ may properly be presumed to be in the hands of the\r\nPresident, and not to be in the hands of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf I follow Mr. Binney's argument, it amounts to so much. But it\r\nseems to me that Mr. Binney is wrong in his premises, and wrong in\r\nhis conclusion. The article of the constitution in question does not\r\ndefine the conditions under which the privilege of the writ shall\r\nbe suspended. It simply states that this privilege shall never be\r\nsuspended, except under certain conditions. It shall not be suspended\r\nunless when the public safety may require such suspension on account\r\nof rebellion or invasion. Rebellion or invasion is not necessarily to\r\nproduce such suspension. There is indeed no naked matter of fact to\r\nguide either President or Congress in the matter, and therefore I say\r\nthat Mr. Binney is wrong in his premises. Rebellion or invasion might\r\noccur twenty times over, and might even endanger the public safety,\r\nwithout justifying the suspension of the privilege of the writ\r\nunder the constitution. I say also that Mr. Binney is wrong in his\r\nconclusion. The public safety must require the suspension before the\r\nsuspension can be justified, and such requirement must be a matter\r\nfor judgment, and for the exercise of discretion. Whether or no there\r\nshall be any suspension is a matter for deliberation,--not one simply\r\nfor executive action, as though it were already ordered. There is no\r\nmatter-of-fact conclusion from facts. Should invasion or rebellion\r\noccur, and should the public safety, in consequence of such rebellion\r\nor invasion, require the suspension of the privilege of the writ,\r\nthen, and only then, may the privilege be suspended. But to whom\r\nis the power, or rather the duty, of exercising this discretion\r\ndelegated? Mr. Binney says that \"there is no express delegation of\r\nthe power in the constitution.\" I maintain that Mr. Binney is again\r\nwrong, and that the constitution does expressly delegate the power,\r\nnot to the President, but to Congress. This is done so clearly, to my\r\nmind, that I cannot understand the misunderstanding which has existed\r\nin the States upon the subject. The first article of the constitution\r\ntreats \"of the legislature.\" The second article treats \"of the\r\nexecutive.\" The third treats \"of the judiciary.\" After that there\r\nare certain \"miscellaneous articles,\" so called. The eighth section\r\nof the first article gives, as I have said before, a list of things\r\nwhich the legislature or Congress shall do. The ninth section gives\r\na list of things which the legislature or Congress shall not do. The\r\nsecond item in this list is the prohibition of any suspension of\r\nthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, except under certain\r\ncircumstances. This prohibition is therefore expressly placed upon\r\nCongress, and this prohibition contains the only authority under\r\nwhich the privilege can be constitutionally suspended. Then comes the\r\narticle on the executive, which defines the powers that the President\r\nshall exercise. In that article there is no word referring to the\r\nsuspension of the privilege of the writ. He that runs may read.\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, that Mr. Lincoln's Government has committed a\r\nbreach of the constitution in taking upon itself to suspend the\r\nprivilege;--a breach against the letter of the constitution. It has\r\nassumed a power which the constitution has not given it,--which,\r\nindeed, the constitution, by placing it in the hands of another body,\r\nhas manifestly declined to put into the hands of the executive;\r\nand it has also committed a breach against the spirit of the\r\nconstitution. The chief purport of the constitution is to guard the\r\nliberties of the people, and to confide to a deliberative body the\r\nconsideration of all circumstances by which those liberties may be\r\naffected. The President shall command the army; but Congress shall\r\nraise and support the army. Congress shall declare war. Congress\r\nshall coin money. Congress, by one of its bodies, shall sanction\r\ntreaties. Congress shall establish such law courts as are not\r\nestablished by the constitution. Under no circumstances is the\r\nPresident to decree what shall be done. But he is to do those things\r\nwhich the constitution has decreed or which Congress shall decree.\r\nIt is monstrous to suppose that power over the privilege of the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus would, among such a people, and under such a\r\nconstitution, be given without limit to the chief officer, the only\r\ncondition being that there should be some rebellion. Such rebellion\r\nmight be in Utah territory; or some trouble in the uttermost bounds\r\nof Texas would suffice. Any invasion, such as an inroad by the\r\nsavages of Old Mexico upon New Mexico, would justify an arbitrary\r\nPresident in robbing all the people of all the States of their\r\nliberties! A squabble on the borders of Canada would put such a power\r\ninto the hands of the President for four years; or the presence of an\r\nEnglish frigate in the St. Juan channel might be held to do so. I say\r\nthat such a theory is monstrous.\r\n\r\nAnd the effect of this breach of the constitution at the present day\r\nhas been very disastrous. It has taught those who have not been close\r\nobservers of the American struggle to believe that, after all, the\r\nAmericans are indifferent as to their liberties. Such pranks have\r\nbeen played before high heaven by men utterly unfitted for the use\r\nof great power, as have scared all the nations. Mr. Lincoln, the\r\nPresident by whom this unconstitutional act has been done, apparently\r\ndelegated his assumed authority to his minister, Mr. Seward. Mr.\r\nSeward has revelled in the privilege of unrestrained arrests, and has\r\nlocked men up with reason and without. He has instituted passports\r\nand surveillance; and placed himself at the head of an omnipresent\r\npolice system with all the gusto of a Fouché, though luckily without\r\na Fouché's craft or cunning. The time will probably come when Mr.\r\nSeward must pay for this,--not with his life or liberty, but with\r\nhis reputation and political name. But in the mean time his lettres\r\nde cachet have run everywhere through the States. The pranks which\r\nhe played were absurd, and the arrests which he made were grievous.\r\nAfter a while, when it became manifest that Mr. Seward had not found\r\na way to success, when it was seen that he had inaugurated no great\r\nmode of putting down rebellion, he apparently lost his power in the\r\ncabinet. The arrests ceased, the passports were discontinued, and the\r\nprison-doors were gradually opened. Mr. Seward was deposed, not from\r\nthe cabinet, but from the premiership of the cabinet. The suspension\r\nof the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus was not countermanded,\r\nbut the operation of the suspension was allowed to become less\r\nand less onerous; and now, in April, 1862, within a year of the\r\ncommencement of the suspension, it has, I think, nearly died out.\r\nThe object in hand now is rather that of getting rid of political\r\nprisoners, than of taking others.\r\n\r\nThis assumption by the government of an unconstitutional power has,\r\nas I have said, taught many lookers-on to think that the Americans\r\nare indifferent to their liberties. I myself do not believe that\r\nsuch a conclusion would be just. During the present crisis the\r\nstrong feeling of the people--that feeling which for the moment has\r\nbeen dominant--has been one in favour of the government as against\r\nrebellion. There has been a passionate resolution to support the\r\nnationality of the nation. Men have felt that they must make\r\nindividual sacrifices, and that such sacrifices must include a\r\ntemporary suspension of some of their constitutional rights. But I\r\nthink that this temporary suspension is already regarded with jealous\r\neyes;--with an increasing jealousy which will have created a reaction\r\nagainst such policy as that which Mr. Seward has attempted, long\r\nbefore the close of Mr. Lincoln's Presidency. I know that it is wrong\r\nin a writer to commit himself to prophecies, but I find it impossible\r\nto write upon this subject without doing so. As I must express a\r\nsurmise on this subject, I venture to prophesy that the Americans\r\nof the States will soon show that they are not indifferent to the\r\nsuspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. On that\r\nmatter of the illegality of the suspension by the President I feel\r\nin my own mind that there is no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the constitution treats of the executive, and\r\nis very short. It places the whole executive power in the hands of\r\nthe President, and explains with more detail the mode in which the\r\nPresident shall be chosen, than the manner after which the duties\r\nshall be performed. The first section states that the executive\r\nshall be vested in a President, who shall hold his office for four\r\nyears. With him shall be chosen a Vice-President. I may here explain\r\nthat the Vice-President, as such, has no power either political or\r\nadministrative. He is, ex officio, the speaker of the Senate; and\r\nshould the President die, or be by other cause rendered unable to\r\nact as President, the Vice-President becomes President either for\r\nthe remainder of the Presidential term or for the period of the\r\nPresident's temporary absence. Twice since the constitution was\r\nwritten, the President has died and the Vice-President has taken\r\nhis place. No President has vacated his position, even for a period,\r\nthrough any cause other than death.\r\n\r\nThen come the rules under which the President and Vice-President\r\nshall be elected,--with reference to which there has been an\r\namendment of the constitution subsequent to the fourth presidential\r\nelection. This was found to be necessary by the circumstances of the\r\ncontest between John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Aaron Burr. It was\r\nthen found that the complications in the method of election created\r\nby the original clause were all but unendurable, and the constitution\r\nwas amended.\r\n\r\nI will not describe in detail the present mode of election, as the\r\ndoing so would be tedious and unnecessary. Two facts I wish, however,\r\nto make specially noticeable and clear. The first is, that the\r\nPresident of the United States is now chosen by universal suffrage;\r\nand the second is, that the constitution expressly intended that the\r\nPresident should not be chosen by universal suffrage, but by a body\r\nof men who should enjoy the confidence and fairly represent the will\r\nof the people. The framers of the constitution intended so to write\r\nthe words, that the people themselves should have no more immediate\r\nconcern in the nomination of the President than in that of the\r\nSenate. They intended to provide that the election should be made in\r\na manner which may be described as thoroughly conservative. Those\r\nwords, however, have been inefficient for their purpose. They have\r\nnot been violated. But the spirit has been violated, while the words\r\nhave been held sacred,--and the Presidential elections are now\r\nconducted on the widest principles of universal suffrage. They are\r\nessentially democratic.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement, as written in the constitution, is that each State\r\nshall appoint a body of electors equal in number to the senators and\r\nrepresentatives sent by that State to Congress, and that thus a body\r\nor college of electors shall be formed equal in number to the two\r\njoint Houses of Congress, by which the President shall be elected. No\r\nmember of Congress, however, can be appointed an elector. Thus New\r\nYork, with thirty-three representatives in the Lower House, would\r\nname thirty-five electors; and Rhode Island, with two members in the\r\nLower House, would name four electors;--in each case two being added\r\nfor the two senators.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be doubted whether this theory of an election by\r\nelectors has ever been truly carried out. It was probably the case\r\neven at the election of the first Presidents after Washington, that\r\nthe electors were pledged in some informal way as to the candidate\r\nfor whom they should vote; but the very idea of an election by\r\nelectors has been abandoned since the Presidency of General Jackson.\r\nAccording to the theory of the constitution the privilege and the\r\nduty of selecting a best man as President was to be delegated to\r\ncertain best men chosen for that purpose. This was the intention of\r\nthose who framed the constitution. It may, as I have said, be doubted\r\nwhether this theory has ever availed for action; but since the days\r\nof Jackson it has been absolutely abandoned. The intention was\r\nsufficiently conservative. The electors to whom was to be confided\r\nthis great trust, were to be chosen in their own States as each State\r\nmight think fit. The use of universal suffrage for this purpose was\r\nneither enjoined nor forbidden in the separate States,--was neither\r\ntreated as desirable or undesirable by the constitution. Each State\r\nwas left to judge how it would elect its own electors. But the\r\nPresident himself was to be chosen by those electors and not by the\r\npeople at large. The intention is sufficiently conservative, but the\r\nintention is not carried out.\r\n\r\nThe electors are still chosen by the different States in conformity\r\nwith the bidding of the constitution. The constitution is exactly\r\nfollowed in all its biddings, as far as the wording of it is\r\nconcerned; but the whole spirit of the document has been evaded in\r\nthe favour of democracy, and universal suffrage in the Presidential\r\nelections has been adopted. The electors are still chosen, it is\r\ntrue; but they are only chosen as the mouthpiece of the people's\r\nchoice, and not as the mind by which that choice shall be made. We\r\nhave all heard of Americans voting for a ticket,--for the democratic\r\nticket, or the republican ticket. All political voting in the States\r\nis now managed by tickets. As regards these Presidential elections,\r\neach party decides on a candidate. Even this primary decision is\r\na matter of voting among the party itself. When Mr. Lincoln was\r\nnominated as its candidate by the republican party, the names of no\r\nless than thirteen candidates were submitted to the delegates who\r\nwere sent to a convention at Chicago, assembled for the purpose of\r\nfixing upon a candidate. At that convention, Mr. Lincoln was chosen\r\nas the republican candidate; and in that convention was in fact\r\nfought the battle which was won in Mr. Lincoln's favour, although\r\nthat convention was what we may call a private arrangement, wholly\r\nirrespective of any constitutional enactment. Mr. Lincoln was then\r\nproclaimed as the republican candidate, and all republicans were held\r\nas bound to support him. When the time came for the constitutional\r\nelection of the electors, certain names were got together in each\r\nState as representing the republican interest. These names formed\r\nthe republican ticket, and any man voting for them voted in fact\r\nfor Lincoln. There were three other parties, each represented by a\r\ncandidate, and each had its own ticket in the different States. It\r\nis not to be supposed that the supporters of Mr. Lincoln were very\r\nanxious about their ticket in Alabama, or those of Mr. Breckinridge\r\nas to theirs in Massachusetts. In Alabama, a democratic slave-ticket\r\nwould of course prevail. In Massachusetts, a republican free-soil\r\nticket would do so. But it may, I think, be seen that in this way\r\nthe electors have in reality ceased to have any weight in the\r\nelections,--have in very truth ceased to have the exercise of any\r\nwill whatever. They are mere names, and no more. Stat nominis umbra.\r\nThe election of the President is made by universal suffrage, and not\r\nby a college of electors. The words as they are written are still\r\nobeyed; but the constitution in fact has been violated, for the\r\nspirit of it has been changed in its very essence.\r\n\r\nThe President must have been born a citizen of the United States.\r\nThis is not necessary for the holder of any other office or for a\r\nsenator or representative; he must be thirty-four years old at the\r\ntime of his election.\r\n\r\nHis executive power is almost unbounded. He is much more powerful\r\nthan any minister can be with us, and is subject to a much lighter\r\nresponsibility. He may be impeached by the House of Representatives\r\nbefore the Senate, but that impeachment only goes to the removal\r\nfrom office and permanent disqualification for office. But in these\r\ndays, as we all practically understand, responsibility does not mean\r\nthe fear of any great punishment, but the necessity of accounting\r\nfrom day to day for public actions. A leading statesman has but\r\nslight dread of the axe, but is in hourly fear of his opponent's\r\nquestions. The President of the United States is subject to no such\r\nquestionings; and as he does not even require a majority in either\r\nHouse for the maintenance of his authority, his responsibility sits\r\nupon him very slightly. Seeing that Mr. Buchanan has escaped any\r\npunishment for maladministration, no President need fear the anger\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe President is Commander-in-chief of the army and of the navy. He\r\ncan grant pardons,--as regards all offences committed against the\r\nUnited States. He has no power to pardon an offence committed against\r\nthe laws of any State, and as to which the culprit has been tried\r\nbefore the tribunals of that State. He can make treaties; but such\r\ntreaties are not valid till they have been confirmed by two-thirds\r\nof the senators present in executive session. He appoints all\r\nambassadors and other public officers,--but subject to the\r\nconfirmation of the Senate. He can convene either or both Houses of\r\nCongress at irregular times, and under certain circumstances can\r\nadjourn them. His executive power is in fact almost unlimited; and\r\nthis power is solely in his own hands, as the constitution knows\r\nnothing of the President's ministers. According to the constitution\r\nthese officers are merely the heads of his bureaux. An Englishman,\r\nhowever, in considering the executive power of the President, and\r\nin making any comparison between that and the executive power of\r\nany officer or officers attached to the Crown in England, should\r\nalways bear in mind that the President's power, and even authority,\r\nis confined to the Federal Government, and that he has none\r\nwith reference to the individual States. Religion, education, the\r\nadministration of the general laws which concern every man and\r\nwoman, and the real de facto Government which comes home to every\r\nhouse;--these things are not in any way subject to the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nHis legislative power is also great. He has a veto upon all acts of\r\nCongress. This veto is by no means a dead letter, as is the veto\r\nof the Crown with us; but it is not absolute. The President, if he\r\nrefuses his sanction to a bill sent up to him from Congress, returns\r\nit to that House in which it originated, with his objections in\r\nwriting. If, after that, such bill shall again pass through both the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives, receiving in each House the\r\napprovals of two-thirds of those present, then such bill becomes law\r\nwithout the President's sanction. Unless this be done the President's\r\nveto stops the bill. This veto has been frequently used, but no bill\r\nhas yet been passed in opposition to it.\r\n\r\nThe third article of the constitution treats of the judiciary of the\r\nUnited States, but as I purpose to write a chapter devoted to the law\r\ncourts and lawyers of the States, I need not here describe at length\r\nthe enactments of the constitution on this head. It is ordained that\r\nall criminal trials, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\r\njury.\r\n\r\nThere are after this certain miscellaneous articles, some of which\r\nbelong to the constitution as it stood at first, and others of which\r\nhave been since added as amendments. A citizen of one State is to\r\nbe a citizen of every State. Criminals from one State shall not\r\nbe free from pursuit in other States. Then comes a very material\r\nenactment:--\"No person held to service or labour in one State, under\r\nthe laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any\r\nlaw or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labour;\r\nbut shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service\r\nor labour may be due.\" In speaking of a person held to labour the\r\nconstitution intends to speak of a slave, and the article amounts to\r\na fugitive slave law. If a slave run away out of South Carolina and\r\nfind his way into Massachusetts, Massachusetts shall deliver him up\r\nwhen called upon to do so by South Carolina. The words certainly are\r\nclear enough. But Massachusetts strongly objects to the delivery\r\nof such men when so desired. Such men she has delivered up, with\r\nmany groanings and much inward perturbation of spirit. But it is\r\nunderstood, not in Massachusetts only, but in the free-soil States\r\ngenerally, that fugitive slaves shall not be delivered up by the\r\nordinary action of the laws. There is a feeling strong as that which\r\nwe entertain with reference to the rendition of slaves from Canada.\r\nWith such a clause in the constitution as that, it is hardly too much\r\nto say that no free-soil State will consent to constitutional action.\r\nWere it expunged from the constitution, no slave State would consent\r\nto live under it. It is a point as to which the advocates of slavery\r\nand the enemies of slavery cannot be brought to act in union. But on\r\nthis head I have already said what little I have to say.\r\n\r\nNew States may be admitted by Congress, but the bounds of no old\r\nState shall be altered without the consent of such State. Congress\r\nshall have power to rule and dispose of the territories and property\r\nof the United States. The United States guarantee every State a\r\nrepublican form of Government; but the constitution does not define\r\nthat form of Government. An ordinary citizen of the United States,\r\nif asked, would probably say that it included that description of\r\nfranchise which I have called universal suffrage. Such, however, was\r\nnot the meaning of those who framed the constitution. The ordinary\r\ncitizen would probably also say that it excluded the use of a king,\r\nthough he would, I imagine, be able to give no good reason for saying\r\nso. I take a republican government to be that in which the care of\r\nthe people is in the hands of the people. They may use an elected\r\nPresident, an hereditary king, or a chief magistrate called by any\r\nother name. But the magistrate, whatever be his name, must be the\r\nservant of the people and not their lord. He must act for them and at\r\ntheir bidding,--not they at his. If he do so, he is the chief officer\r\nof a republic;--as is our Queen with us.\r\n\r\nThe United States' constitution also guarantees to each State\r\nprotection against invasion, and, if necessary, against domestic\r\nviolence,--meaning, I presume, internal violence. The words domestic\r\nviolence might seem to refer solely to slave insurrections; but such\r\nis not the meaning of the words. The free State of New York would be\r\nentitled to the assistance of the Federal Government in putting down\r\ninternal violence, if unable to quell such violence by her own power.\r\n\r\nThis constitution, and the laws of the United States made in\r\npursuance of it, are to be held as the supreme law of the land.\r\nThe judges of every State are to be bound thereby, let the laws\r\nor separate constitution of such State say what they will to the\r\ncontrary. Senators and others are to be bound by oath to support\r\nthe constitution; but no religious test shall be required as a\r\nqualification to any office.\r\n\r\nIn the amendments to the constitution, it is enacted that Congress\r\nshall make no law as to the establishment of any religion, or\r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; and also that it shall not\r\nabridge the freedom of speech, or of the press, or of petition.--The\r\nGovernment, however, as is well known, has taken upon itself to\r\nabridge the freedom of the press.--The right of the people to bear\r\narms shall not be infringed. Then follow various clauses intended\r\nfor the security of the people in reference to the administration of\r\nthe laws. They shall not be troubled by unreasonable searches. They\r\nshall not be made to answer for great offences except by indictment\r\nof a grand jury. They shall not be put twice in jeopardy for the\r\nsame offence. They shall not be compelled to give evidence against\r\nthemselves. Private property shall not be taken for public use\r\nwithout compensation. Accused persons in criminal proceedings shall\r\nbe entitled to speedy and public trial. They shall be confronted with\r\nthe witnesses against them, and shall have assistance of counsel.\r\nSuits in which the value controverted is above 20 dollars (£4) shall\r\nbe tried before juries. Excessive bail shall not be required, nor\r\ncruel and unusual punishments inflicted. In all which enactments\r\nwe see, I think, a close resemblance to those which have been\r\ntime-honoured among ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe remaining amendments apply to the mode in which the President and\r\nVice-President shall be elected, and of them I have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThe constitution is signed by Washington as President,--as President\r\nand Deputy from Virginia. It is signed by deputies from all the\r\nother States, except Rhode Island. Among the signatures is that of\r\nAlexander Hamilton, from New York; of Franklin, heading a crowd in\r\nPennsylvania, in the capital of which State the convention was held;\r\nand that of James Madison, the future President, from Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this chapter I have spoken of the splendid\r\nresults attained by those who drew up the constitution; and then, as\r\nthough in opposition to the praise thus given to their work, I have\r\ninsisted throughout the chapter both on the insufficiency of the\r\nconstitution and on the breaches to which it has been subjected.\r\nI have declared my opinion that it is inefficient for some of its\r\nrequired purposes, and have said that, whether inefficient or\r\nefficient, it has been broken and in some degree abandoned. I\r\nmaintain, however, that in this I have not contradicted myself. A\r\nboy, who declares his purpose of learning the Æneid by heart, will\r\nbe held as being successful if at the end of the given period he can\r\nrepeat eleven books out of the twelve. Nevertheless the reporter, in\r\nsumming up the achievement, is bound to declare that that other book\r\nhas not been learned. Under this constitution of which I have been\r\nspeaking, the American people have achieved much material success\r\nand great political power. As a people they have been happy and\r\nprosperous. Their freedom has been secured to them, and for a\r\nperiod of seventy-five years they have lived and prospered without\r\nsubjection to any form of tyranny. This in itself is much, and\r\nshould, I think, be held as a preparation for greater things to\r\nfollow. Such, I think, should be our opinion, although the nation\r\nis at the present burdened by so heavy a load of troubles. That any\r\nwritten constitution should serve its purposes and maintain its\r\nauthority in a nation for a dozen years is in itself much for its\r\nframers. Where are now the constitutions which were written for\r\nFrance? But this constitution has so wound itself into the affections\r\nof the people, has become a mark for such reverence and love, has,\r\nafter a trial of three quarters of a century, so recommended itself\r\nto the judgment of men, that the difficulty consists in touching\r\nit, not in keeping it. Eighteen or twenty millions of people who\r\nhave lived under it,--in what way do they regard it? Is not that\r\nthe best evidence that can be had respecting it? Is it to them an old\r\nwoman's story, a useless parchment, a thing of old words at which\r\nall must now smile? Heaven mend them, if they reverence it more, as\r\nI fear they do, than they reverence their Bible. For them, after\r\nseventy-five years of trial, it has almost the weight of inspiration.\r\nIn this respect,--with reference to this worship of the work of their\r\nforefathers, they may be in error. But that very error goes far to\r\nprove the excellence of the code. When a man has walked for six\r\nmonths over stony ways in the same boots, he will be believed when he\r\nsays that his boots are good boots. No assertion to the contrary from\r\nany bystander will receive credence, even though it be shown that a\r\nstitch or two has come undone, and that some required purpose has not\r\neffectually been carried out. The boots have carried the man over his\r\nstony roads for six months, and they must be good boots. And so I say\r\nthat the constitution must be a good constitution.\r\n\r\nAs to that positive breach of the constitution which has, as I\r\nmaintain, been committed by the present Government, although I have\r\nbeen at some trouble to prove it, I must own that I do not think\r\nvery much of it. It is to be lamented, but the evil admits, I think,\r\nof easy repair. It has happened at a period of unwonted difficulty,\r\nwhen the minds of men were intent rather on the support of that\r\nnationality which guarantees their liberties, than on the enjoyment\r\nof those liberties themselves, and the fault may be pardoned if it\r\nbe acknowledged. But it is essential that it should be acknowledged.\r\nIn such a matter as that there should at any rate be no doubt. Now,\r\nin this very year of the rebellion, it may be well that no clamour\r\nagainst Government should arise from the people, and thus add to\r\nthe difficulties of the nation. But it will be bad, indeed, for the\r\nnation if such a fault shall have been committed by this Government\r\nand shall be allowed to pass unacknowledged, unrebuked,--as though\r\nit were a virtue and no fault. I cannot but think that the time will\r\nsoon come in which Mr. Seward's reading of the constitution and Mr.\r\nLincoln's assumption of illegal power under that reading will receive\r\na different construction in the States than that put upon it by Mr.\r\nBinney.\r\n\r\nBut I have admitted that the constitution itself is not perfect.\r\nIt seems to me that it requires to be amended on two separate\r\npoints;--especially on two; and I cannot but acknowledge that there\r\nwould be great difficulty in making such amendments. That matter\r\nof direct taxation is the first. As to that I shall speak again in\r\nreferring to the financial position of the country. I think, however,\r\nthat it must be admitted, in any discussion held on the constitution\r\nof the United States, that the theory of taxation as there laid down\r\nwill not suffice for the wants of a great nation. If the States are\r\nto maintain their ground as a great national power, they must agree\r\namong themselves to bear the cost of such greatness. While a custom\r\nduty was sufficient for the public wants of the United States, this\r\nfault in the constitution was not felt. But now that standing armies\r\nhave been inaugurated, that iron-clad ships are held as desirable,\r\nthat a great national debt has been founded, custom duties will\r\nsuffice no longer, nor will excise duties suffice. Direct taxation\r\nmust be levied, and such taxation cannot be fairly levied without a\r\nchange in the constitution. But such a change may be made in direct\r\naccordance with the spirit of the constitution, and the necessity for\r\nsuch an alteration cannot be held as proving any inefficiency in the\r\noriginal document for the purposes originally required.\r\n\r\nAs regards the other point which seems to me to require amendment,\r\nI must acknowledge that I am about to express simply my own opinion.\r\nShould Americans read what I write, they may probably say that I\r\nam recommending them to adopt the blunders made by the English in\r\ntheir practice of government. Englishmen, on the other hand, may\r\nnot improbably conceive that a system which works well here under a\r\nmonarchy, would absolutely fail under a presidency of four years'\r\nduration. Nevertheless I will venture to suggest that the government\r\nof the United States would be improved in all respects, if the\r\ngentlemen forming the President's cabinet were admitted to seats\r\nin Congress. At present they are virtually irresponsible. They are\r\nconstitutionally little more than head clerks. This was all very well\r\nwhile the Government of the United States was as yet a small thing;\r\nbut now it is no longer a small thing. The President himself cannot\r\ndo all, nor can he be, in truth, responsible for all. A cabinet, such\r\nas is our cabinet, is necessary to him. Such a cabinet does exist,\r\nand the members of it take upon themselves the honours which are\r\ngiven to our cabinet ministers. But they are exempted from all that\r\nparliamentary contact which, in fact, gives to our cabinet ministers\r\ntheir adroitness, their responsibility, and their position in the\r\ncountry. On this subject also I must say another word or two further\r\non.\r\n\r\nBut how am I to excuse the constitution on those points as to which\r\nit has, as I have said, fallen through,--in respect to which it has\r\nshown itself to be inefficient by the weakness of its own words?\r\nSeeing that all the executive power is intrusted to the President, it\r\nis especially necessary that the choice of the President should be\r\nguarded by constitutional enactments;--that the President should be\r\nchosen in such a manner as may seem best to the concentrated wisdom\r\nof the country. The President is placed in his seat for four years.\r\nFor that term he is irremovable. He acts without any majority in\r\neither of the legislative Houses. He must state reasons for his\r\nconduct, but he is not responsible for those reasons. His own\r\njudgment is his sole guide. No desire of the people can turn him out;\r\nnor need he fear any clamour from the press. If an officer so high in\r\npower be needed, at any rate the choice of such an officer should be\r\nmade with the greatest care. The constitution has decreed how such\r\ncare should be exercised, but the constitution has not been able to\r\nmaintain its own decree. The constituted electors of the President\r\nhave become a mere name; and that officer is chosen by popular\r\nelection, in opposition to the intention of those who framed the\r\nconstitution. The effect of this may be seen in the characters of the\r\nmen so chosen. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, the two Adamses, and\r\nJackson were the owners of names that have become known in history.\r\nThey were men who have left their marks behind them. Those in Europe\r\nwho have read of anything, have read of them. Americans, whether as\r\nrepublicans they admire Washington and the Adamses, or as democrats\r\nhold by Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson, do not at any rate blush for\r\ntheir old Presidents. But who has heard of Polk, of Pierce, and of\r\nBuchanan? What American is proud of them? In the old days the name\r\nof a future President might be surmised. He would probably be a man\r\nhonoured in the nation; but who now can make a guess as to the next\r\nPresident? In one respect a guess may be made with some safety. The\r\nnext President will be a man whose name has as yet offended no one by\r\nits prominence. But one requisite is essential for a President; he\r\nmust be a man whom none as yet have delighted to honour.\r\n\r\nThis has come of universal suffrage; and seeing that it has come in\r\nspite of the constitution, and not by the constitution, it is very\r\nbad. Nor in saying this am I speaking my own conviction so much\r\nas that of all educated Americans with whom I have discussed the\r\nsubject. At the present moment universal suffrage is not popular.\r\nThose who are the highest among the people certainly do not love\r\nit. I doubt whether the masses of the people have ever craved it.\r\nIt has been introduced into the Presidential elections by men called\r\npoliticians--by men who have made it a matter of trade to dabble\r\nin state affairs, and who have gradually learned to see how the\r\nconstitutional law, with reference to the Presidential electors,\r\ncould be set aside without any positive breach of the constitution.*\r\n\r\n  *On this matter one of the best, and best informed Americans that\r\n   I have known told me that he differed from me. \"It introduced\r\n   itself,\" said he. \"It was the result of social and political\r\n   forces. Election of the President by popular choice became a\r\n   necessity.\" The meaning of this is, that in regard to their\r\n   Presidential elections the United States drifted into universal\r\n   suffrage. I do not know that his theory is one more comfortable\r\n   for his country than my own.\r\n\r\nWhether or no any backward step can now be taken,--whether these\r\nelections can again be put into the hands of men fit to exercise a\r\nchoice in such a matter,--may well be doubted. Facilis descensus\r\nAverni. But the recovery of the downward steps is very difficult. On\r\nthat subject, however, I hardly venture here to give an opinion. I\r\nonly declare what has been done, and express my belief that it has\r\nnot been done in conformity with the wishes of the people,--as it\r\ncertainly has not been done in conformity with the intention of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nIn another matter a departure has been made from the conservative\r\nspirit of the constitution. This departure is equally grave with the\r\nother, but it is one which certainly does admit of correction. I\r\nallude to the present position assumed by many of the senators, and\r\nto the instructions given to them by the State legislatures, as to\r\nthe votes which they shall give in the Senate. An obedience on their\r\npart to such instructions is equal in its effects to the introduction\r\nof universal suffrage into the elections. It makes them hang upon the\r\npeople, divests them of their personal responsibility, takes away\r\nall those advantages given to them by a six years' certain tenure of\r\noffice, and annuls the safety secured by a conservative method of\r\nelection. Here again I must declare my opinion that this democratic\r\npractice has crept into the Senate without any expressed wish of\r\nthe people. In all such matters the people of the nation has been\r\nstrangely undemonstrative. It has been done as part of a system which\r\nhas been used for transferring the political power of the nation\r\nto a body of trading politicians who have become known and felt as\r\na mass, and not known and felt as individuals. I find it difficult\r\nto describe the present political position of the States in this\r\nrespect. The millions of the people are eager for the constitution,\r\nare proud of their power as a nation, and are ambitious of national\r\ngreatness. But they are not, as I think, especially desirous of\r\nretaining political influences in their own hands. At many of the\r\nelections it is difficult to induce them to vote. They have among\r\nthem a half-knowledge that politics is a trade in the hands of the\r\nlawyers, and that they are the capital by which those political\r\ntradesmen carry on their business. These politicians are all lawyers.\r\nPolitics and law go together as naturally as the possession of land\r\nand the exercise of magisterial powers do with us. It may be well\r\nthat it should be so, as the lawyers are the best educated men of the\r\ncountry, and need not necessarily be the most dishonest. Political\r\npower has come into their hands, and it is for their purposes and by\r\ntheir influences that the spread of democracy has been encouraged.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Senate, the recovery of their old dignity and former\r\nposition is within their own power. No amendment of the constitution\r\nis needed here, nor has the weakness come from any insufficiency of\r\nthe constitution. The Senate can assume to itself to-morrow its own\r\nglories, and can, by doing so, become the saviours of the honour and\r\nglory of the nation. It is to the Senate that we must look for that\r\nconservative element which may protect the United States from the\r\nviolence of demagogues on one side and from the despotism of military\r\npower on the other. The Senate, and the Senate only, can keep the\r\nPresident in check. The Senate also has a power over the Lower House\r\nwith reference to the disposal of money, which deprives the House\r\nof Representatives of that exclusive authority which belongs to our\r\nHouse of Commons. It is not simply that the House of Representatives\r\ncannot do what is done by the House of Commons. There is more than\r\nthis. To the Senate, in the minds of all Americans, belongs that\r\nsuperior prestige, that acknowledged possession of the greater\r\npower and fuller scope for action, which is with us as clearly the\r\npossession of the House of Commons. The United States' Senate can be\r\nconservative, and can be so by virtue of the constitution. The love\r\nof the constitution in the hearts of all Americans is so strong that\r\nthe exercise of such power by the Senate would strengthen rather than\r\nendanger its position. I could wish that the senators would abandon\r\ntheir money payments, but I do not imagine that that will be done\r\nexactly in these days.\r\n\r\nI have now endeavoured to describe the strength of the constitution\r\nof the United States, and to explain its weakness. The great question\r\nis at this moment being solved, whether or no that constitution will\r\nstill be found equal to its requirements. It has hitherto been the\r\nmainspring in the government of the people. They have trusted with\r\nalmost childlike confidence to the wisdom of their founders, and\r\nhave said to their rulers,--\"There; in those words, you must find\r\nthe extent and the limit of your powers. It is written down for\r\nyou, so that he who runs may read.\" That writing down, as it were,\r\nat a single sitting, of a sufficient code of instructions for the\r\ngovernors of a great nation, had not hitherto in the world's history\r\nbeen found to answer. In this instance it has, at any rate, answered\r\nbetter than in any other, probably because the words so written\r\ncontained in them less pretence of finality in political wisdom than\r\nother written constitutions have assumed. A young tree must bend, or\r\nthe winds will certainly break it. For myself I can honestly express\r\nmy hope that no storm may destroy this tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the American constitution I have said so much of the\r\nAmerican form of government that but little more is left to me to say\r\nunder that heading. Nevertheless, I should hardly go through the work\r\nwhich I have laid out for myself if I did not endeavour to explain\r\nmore continuously, and perhaps more graphically, than I found myself\r\nable to do in the last chapter, the system on which public affairs\r\nare managed in the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must beg my readers again to bear in mind how moderate is\r\nthe amount of governing which has fallen to the lot of the government\r\nof the United States; how moderate, as compared with the amount which\r\nhas to be done by the Queen's officers of state for Great Britain, or\r\nby the Emperor, with such assistance as he may please to accept from\r\nhis officers of state, for France. That this is so must be attributed\r\nto more than one cause; but the chief cause is undoubtedly to be\r\nfound in the very nature of a federal government. The States are\r\nindividually sovereign, and govern themselves as to all internal\r\nmatters. All the judges in England are appointed by the Crown; but in\r\nthe United States only a small proportion of the judges are nominated\r\nby the President. The greater number are servants of the different\r\nStates. The execution of the ordinary laws for the protection of men\r\nand property does not fall on the government of the United States,\r\nbut on the executives of the individual States,--unless in some\r\nspecial matters, which will be defined in the next chapter. Trade,\r\neducation, roads, religion, the passing of new measures for the\r\ninternal or domestic comfort of the people,--all these things are\r\nmore or less matters of care to our government. In the States they\r\nare matters of care to the governments of each individual State, but\r\nare not so to the central government at Washington.\r\n\r\nBut there are other causes which operate in the same direction, and\r\nwhich have hitherto enabled the Presidents of the United States, with\r\ntheir ministers, to maintain their positions without much knowledge\r\nof statecraft, or the necessity for that education in state matters\r\nwhich is so essential to our public men. In the first place, the\r\nUnited States have hitherto kept their hands out of foreign politics.\r\nIf they have not done so altogether, they have so greatly abstained\r\nfrom meddling in them that none of that thorough knowledge of the\r\naffairs of other nations has been necessary to them which is so\r\nessential with us, and which seems to be regarded as the one thing\r\nneeded in the cabinets of other European nations. This has been a\r\ngreat blessing to the United States, but it has not been an unmixed\r\nblessing. It has been a blessing because the absence of such care has\r\nsaved the country from trouble and from expense. But such a state of\r\nthings was too good to last; and the blessing has not been unmixed,\r\nseeing that now, when that absence of concern in foreign matters\r\nhas been no longer possible, the knowledge necessary for taking a\r\ndignified part in foreign discussions has been found wanting. Mr.\r\nSeward is now the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the States, and it\r\nis hardly too much to say that he has made himself a laughing-stock\r\namong the diplomatists of Europe, by the mixture of his ignorance and\r\nhis arrogance. His reports to his own ministers during the single\r\nyear of his office, as published by himself apparently with great\r\nsatisfaction, are a monument not so much of his incapacity as of his\r\nwant of training for such work. We all know his long state papers\r\non the \"Trent\" affair. What are we to think of a statesman who\r\nacknowledges the action of his country's servant to have been wrong,\r\nand in the same breath declares that he would have held by that\r\nwrong, had the material welfare of his country been thereby improved?\r\nThe United States have now created a great army and a great debt.\r\nThey will soon also have created a great navy. Affairs of other\r\nnations will press upon them, and they will press against the affairs\r\nof other nations. In this way statecraft will become necessary to\r\nthem; and by degrees their ministers will become habile, graceful,\r\nadroit;--and perhaps crafty, as are the ministers of other nations.\r\n\r\nAnd, moreover, the United States have had no outlying colonies or\r\ndependencies, such as an India and Canada are to us, as Cuba is and\r\nMexico was to Spain, and as were the provinces of the Roman empire.\r\nTerritories she has had, but by the peculiar beneficence of her\r\npolitical arrangements, these territories have assumed the guise\r\nof sovereign States, and been admitted into federal partnership on\r\nequal terms, with a rapidity which has hardly left to the central\r\nGovernment the reality of any dominion of its own. We are inclined to\r\nsuppose that these new States have been allowed to assume their equal\r\nprivileges and State rights because they have been contiguous to\r\nthe old States--as though it were merely an extension of frontier.\r\nBut this has not been so. California and Oregon have been very much\r\nfurther from Washington than the Canadas are from London. Indeed they\r\nare still further, and I hardly know whether they can be brought much\r\nnearer than Canada is to us, even with the assistance of railways.\r\nBut nevertheless California and Oregon were admitted as States,\r\nthe former as quickly and the latter much more quickly than its\r\npopulation would seem to justify Congress in doing, according to\r\nthe received ratio of population. A preference in this way has been\r\nalways given by the United States to a young population over one that\r\nwas older. Oregon with its 60,000 inhabitants has one representative.\r\nNew York with 4,000,000 inhabitants has thirty-three. But in order\r\nto be equal with Oregon, New York should have sixty-six. In this way\r\nthe outlying populations have been encouraged to take upon themselves\r\ntheir own governance, and the governing power of the President and\r\nhis cabinet has been kept within moderate limits.\r\n\r\nBut not the less is the position of the President very dominant in\r\nthe eyes of us Englishmen by reason of the authority with which he\r\nis endowed. It is not that the scope of his power is great, but that\r\nhe is so nearly irresponsible in the exercise of that power. We know\r\nthat he can be impeached by the representatives and expelled from\r\nhis office by the verdict of the Senate; but this, in fact, does\r\nnot amount to much. Responsibility of this nature is doubtless very\r\nnecessary, and prevents ebullitions of tyranny such as those in which\r\na Sultan or an Emperor may indulge; but it is not that responsibility\r\nwhich especially recommends itself to the minds of free men. So much\r\nof responsibility they take as a matter of course, as they do the\r\nair which they breathe. It would be nothing to us to know that Lord\r\nPalmerston could be impeached for robbing the Treasury, or Lord\r\nRussell punished for selling us to Austria. It is well that such laws\r\nshould exist, but we do not in the least suspect those noble lords\r\nof such treachery. We are anxious to know, not in what way they may\r\nbe impeached and beheaded for great crimes, but by what method they\r\nmay be kept constantly straight in small matters. That they are true\r\nand honest is a matter of course. But they must be obedient also,\r\ndiscreet, capable, and above all things of one mind with the public.\r\nLet them be that; or if not they, then with as little delay as may\r\nbe, some others in their place. That with us is the meaning of\r\nministerial responsibility. To that responsibility all the cabinet is\r\nsubject. But in the Government of the United States there is no such\r\nresponsibility. The President is placed at the head of the executive\r\nfor four years, and while he there remains no man can question\r\nhim. It is not that the scope of his power is great. Our own Prime\r\nMinister is doubtless more powerful,--has a wider authority. But it\r\nis that within the scope of his power the President is free from all\r\ncheck. There are no reins, constitutional or unconstitutional, by\r\nwhich he can be restrained. He can absolutely repudiate a majority\r\nof both Houses, and refuse the passage of any act of Congress even\r\nthough supported by those majorities. He can retain the services of\r\nministers distasteful to the whole country. He can place his own\r\nmyrmidons at the head of the army and navy,--or can himself take the\r\ncommand immediately on his own shoulders. All this he can do, and\r\nthere is no one that can question him.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary that I should point out the fundamental\r\ndifference between our King or Queen, and the President of the United\r\nStates. Our Sovereign, we all know, is not responsible. Such is the\r\nnature of our constitution. But there is not on that account any\r\nanalogy between the irresponsibility of the Queen and that of the\r\nPresident. The Queen can do no wrong; but therefore, in all matters\r\nof policy and governance, she must be ruled by advice. For that\r\nadvice her ministers are responsible; and no act of policy or\r\ngovernance can be done in England as to which responsibility does\r\nnot immediately settle on the shoulders appointed to bear it. But\r\nthis is not so in the States. The President is nominally responsible.\r\nBut from that every-day working responsibility, which is to us so\r\ninvaluable, the President is in fact free.\r\n\r\nI will give an instance of this. Now, at this very moment of my\r\nwriting, news has reached us that President Lincoln has relieved\r\nGeneral Maclellan from the command of the whole army, that he has\r\ngiven separate commands to two other generals,--to General Halleck,\r\nnamely, and alas! to General Fremont, and that he has altogether\r\naltered the whole organization of the military command as it\r\npreviously existed. This he did not only during war, but with\r\nreference to a special battle, for the special fighting of which he,\r\nas ex-officio Commander-in-Chief of the forces, had given orders. I\r\ndo not hereby intend to criticise this act of the President's, or to\r\npoint out that that has been done which had better have been left\r\nundone. The President, in a strategetical point of view, may have\r\nbeen,--very probably has been, quite right. I, at any rate, cannot\r\nsay that he has been wrong. But then neither can anybody else say\r\nso with any power of making himself heard. Of this action of the\r\nPresident's, so terribly great in its importance to the nation, no\r\none has the power of expressing any opinion to which the President\r\nis bound to listen. For four years he has this sway, and at the end\r\nof four years he becomes so powerless that it is not then worth the\r\nwhile of any demagogue in a fourth-rate town to occupy his voice with\r\nthat President's name. The anger of the country as to the things done\r\nboth by Pierce and Buchanan is very bitter. But who wastes a thought\r\nupon either of these men? A past President in the United States is of\r\nless consideration than a past Mayor in an English borough. Whatever\r\nevil he may have done during his office, when out of office he is not\r\nworth the powder which would be expended in an attack.\r\n\r\nBut the President has his ministers as our Queen has hers. In one\r\nsense he has such ministers. He has high state servants who under\r\nhim take the control of the various departments, and exercise among\r\nthem a certain degree of patronage and executive power. But they are\r\nthe President's ministers, and not the ministers of the people. Till\r\nlately there has been no chief minister among them, nor am I prepared\r\nto say that there is any such chief at present. According to the\r\nexisting theory of the government these gentlemen have simply been\r\nthe confidential servants of the commonwealth under the President,\r\nand have been attached each to his own department without concerted\r\npolitical alliance among themselves, without any acknowledged chief\r\nbelow the President, and without any combined responsibility even\r\nto the President. If one minister was in fault--let us say the\r\nPostmaster-General,--he alone was in fault, and it did not fall to\r\nthe lot of any other minister either to defend him, or to declare\r\nthat his conduct was indefensible. Each owed his duty and his defence\r\nto the President alone; and each might be removed alone, without\r\nexplanation given by the President to the others. I imagine that the\r\nlate practice of the President's cabinet has in some degree departed\r\nfrom this theory; but if so, the departure has sprung from individual\r\nambition rather than from any preconcerted plan. Some one place in\r\nthe cabinet has seemed to give to some one man an opportunity of\r\nmaking himself pre-eminent, and of this opportunity advantage has\r\nbeen taken. I am not now intending to allude to any individual, but\r\nam endeavouring to indicate the way in which a ministerial cabinet,\r\nafter the fashion of our British cabinet, is struggling to get itself\r\ncreated. No doubt the position of Foreign Secretary has for some time\r\npast been considered as the most influential under the President.\r\nThis has been so much the case that many have not hesitated to call\r\nthe Secretary of State the chief minister. At the present moment,\r\nMay, 1862, the gentleman who is at the head of the war department\r\nhas, I think, in his own hands greater power than any of his\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nIt will probably come to pass before long that one special minister\r\nwill be the avowed leader of the cabinet, and that he will be\r\nrecognized as the chief servant of the State under the President. Our\r\nown cabinet, which now-a-days seems with us to be an institution as\r\nfixed as Parliament and as necessary as the throne, has grown by\r\ndegrees into its present shape, and is not, in truth, nearly so old\r\nas many of us suppose it to be. It shaped itself, I imagine, into its\r\npresent form, and even into its present joint responsibility, during\r\nthe reign of George III. It must be remembered that even with us\r\nthere is no such thing as a constitutional Prime Minister, and that\r\nour Prime Minister is not placed above the other ministers in any\r\nmanner that is palpable to the senses. He is paid no more than the\r\nothers; he has no superior title; he does not take the highest rank\r\namong them; he never talks of his subordinates, but always of his\r\ncolleagues; he has a title of his own, that of First Lord of the\r\nTreasury, but it implies no headship in the cabinet. That he is the\r\nhead of all political power in the nation, the Atlas who has to bear\r\nthe globe, the god in whose hands rest the thunderbolts and the\r\nshowers, all men do know. No man's position is more assured to him.\r\nBut the bounds of that position are written in no book, are defined\r\nby no law, have settled themselves not in accordance with the\r\nrecorded wisdom of any great men, but as expediency and the fitness\r\nof political things in Great Britain have seemed from time to time to\r\nrequire. This drifting of great matters into their proper places is\r\nnot as closely in accordance with the idiosyncrasies of the American\r\npeople as it is with our own. They would prefer to define by words,\r\nas the French do, what shall be the exact position of every public\r\nservant connected with their Government; or rather of every public\r\nservant with whom the people shall be held as having any concern.\r\nBut nevertheless, I think it will come to pass that a cabinet will\r\ngradually form itself at Washington as it has done at London, and\r\nthat of that cabinet there will be some recognized and ostensible\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nBut a Prime Minister in the United States can never take the place\r\nthere which is taken here by our Premier. Over our Premier there is\r\nno one politically superior. The highest political responsibility of\r\nthe nation rests on him. In the States this must always rest on the\r\nPresident, and any minister, whatever may be his name or assumed\r\nposition, can only be responsible through the President. And it is\r\nhere especially that the working of the United States system of\r\nGovernment seems to me deficient,--appears as though it wanted\r\nsomething to make it perfect and round at all points. Our ministers\r\nretire from their offices, as do the Presidents; and indeed the\r\nministerial term of office with us, though of course not fixed, is\r\nin truth much shorter than the Presidential term of four years. But\r\nour ministers do not, in fact, ever go out. At one time they take one\r\nposition, with pay, patronage, and power; and at another time another\r\nposition, without these good things; but in either position they are\r\nacting as public men, and are, in truth, responsible for what they\r\nsay and do. But the President, on whom it is presumed that the whole\r\nof the responsibility of the United States Government rests, goes out\r\nat a certain day, and of him no more is heard. There is no future\r\nbefore him to urge him on to constancy; no hope of other things\r\nbeyond, of greater honours and a wider fame, to keep him wakeful in\r\nhis country's cause. He has already enrolled his name on the list of\r\nhis country's rulers, and received what reward his country can give\r\nhim. Conscience, duty, patriotism may make him true to his place.\r\nTrue to his place, in a certain degree, they will make him. But\r\nambition and hope of things still to come are the moving motives in\r\nthe minds of most men. Few men can allow their energies to expand\r\nto their fullest extent in the cold atmosphere of duty alone. The\r\nPresident of the States must feel that he has reached the top of the\r\nladder, and that he soon will have done with life. As he goes out he\r\nis a dead man. And what can be expected from one who is counting the\r\nlast lingering hours of his existence? \"It will not be in my time,\"\r\nMr. Buchanan is reported to have said, when a friend spoke to him\r\nwith warning voice of the coming rebellion. \"It will not be in my\r\ntime.\" In the old days, before democracy had prevailed in upsetting\r\nthat system of Presidential election which the constitution had\r\nintended to fix as permanent, the Presidents were generally\r\nre-elected for a second term. Of the seven first Presidents five\r\nwere sent back to the White House for a second period of four years.\r\nBut this has never been done since the days of General Jackson; nor\r\nwill it be done, unless a stronger conservative reaction takes place\r\nthan the country even as yet seems to promise. As things have lately\r\nordered themselves, it may almost be said that no man in the Union\r\nwould be so improbable a candidate for the Presidency as the outgoing\r\nPresident. And it has been only natural that it should be so. Looking\r\nat the men themselves who have lately been chosen, the fault has not\r\nconsisted in their non-reelection, but in their original selection.\r\nThere has been no desire for great men; no search after a man of such\r\na nature, that when tried the people should be anxious to keep him.\r\n\"It will not be in my time,\" says the expiring President. And so,\r\nwithout dismay, he sees the empire of his country slide away from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA President, with the possibility of re-election before him, would\r\nbe as a minister who goes out, knowing that he may possibly come\r\nin again before the session is over,--and perhaps believing that\r\nthe chances of his doing so are in his favour. Under the existing\r\npolitical phase of things in the United States, no President has any\r\nsuch prospect;--but the ministers of the President have that chance.\r\nIt is no uncommon thing at present for a minister under one President\r\nto reappear as a minister under another; but a statesman has no\r\nassurance that he will do so because he has shown ministerial\r\ncapacity. We know intimately the names of all our possible\r\nministers,--too intimately as some of us think,--and would be taken\r\nmuch by surprise if a gentleman without an official reputation were\r\nplaced at the head of a high office. If something of this feeling\r\nprevailed as to the President's cabinet, if there were some assurance\r\nthat competent statesmen would be appointed as Secretaries of State,\r\na certain amount of national responsibility would by degrees attach\r\nitself to them, and the President's shoulders would, to that amount,\r\nbe lightened. As it is, the President pretends to bear a burden\r\nwhich, if really borne, would indicate the possession of Herculean\r\nshoulders. But, in fact, the burden at present is borne by no one.\r\nThe government of the United States is not in truth responsible\r\neither to the people or to Congress.\r\n\r\nBut these ministers, if it be desired that they shall have weight\r\nin the country, should sit in Congress either as senators or as\r\nrepresentatives. That they cannot so sit without an amendment of the\r\nconstitution I have explained in the previous chapter; and any such\r\namendment cannot be very readily made. Without such seats they cannot\r\nreally share the responsibility of the President, or be in any degree\r\namenable to public opinion for the advice which they give in their\r\npublic functions. It will be said that the constitution has expressly\r\nintended that they should not be responsible, and such, no doubt, has\r\nbeen the case. But the constitution, good as it is, cannot be taken\r\nas perfect. The government has become greater than seems to have been\r\ncontemplated when that code was drawn up. It has spread itself as it\r\nwere over a wider surface, and has extended to matters which it was\r\nnot then necessary to touch. That theory of governing by the means\r\nof little men was very well while the government itself was small.\r\nA President and his clerks may have sufficed when there were from\r\nthirteen to eighteen States; while there were no territories, or none\r\nat least that required government; while the population was still\r\nbelow five millions; while a standing army was an evil not known and\r\nnot feared; while foreign politics was a troublesome embroglio in\r\nwhich it was quite unnecessary that the United States should take a\r\npart. Now there are thirty-four States. The territories populated by\r\nAmerican citizens stretch from the States on the Atlantic to those on\r\nthe Pacific. There is a population of thirty million souls. At the\r\npresent moment the United States are employing more soldiers than any\r\nother nation, and have acknowledged the necessity of maintaining a\r\nlarge army even when the present troubles shall be over. In addition\r\nto this the United States have occasion for the use of statecraft\r\nwith all the great kingdoms of Europe. That theory of ruling by\r\nlittle men will not do much longer. It will be well that they should\r\nbring forth their big men and put them in the place of rulers.\r\n\r\nThe President has at present seven ministers. They are the Secretary\r\nof State, who is supposed to have the direction of Foreign Affairs;\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, who answers to our Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer; the Secretaries of the Army and of the Navy; the Minister\r\nof the Interior; the Attorney-General; and the Postmaster-General.\r\nIf these officers were allowed to hold seats in one House or in the\r\nother,--or rather if the President were enjoined to place in these\r\noffices men who were known as members of Congress, not only would the\r\nposition of the President's ministers be enhanced and their weight\r\nincreased, but the position also of Congress would be enhanced\r\nand the weight of Congress would be increased. I may, perhaps,\r\nbest exemplify this by suggesting what would be the effect on\r\nour Parliament by withdrawing from it the men who at the present\r\nmoment,--or at any moment,--form the Queen's cabinet. I will not say\r\nthat by adding to Congress the men who usually form the President's\r\ncabinet, a weight would be given equal to that which the withdrawal\r\nof the British cabinet would take from the British Parliament. I\r\ncannot pay that compliment to the President's choice of servants. But\r\nthe relationship between Congress and the President's ministers would\r\ngradually come to resemble that which exists between Parliament and\r\nthe Queen's ministers. The Secretaries of State and of the Treasury\r\nwould after a while obtain that honour of leading the Houses which is\r\nexercised by our high political officers, and the dignity added to\r\nthe positions would make the places worthy of the acceptance of great\r\nmen. It is hardly so at present. The career of one of the President's\r\nministers is not a very high career as things now stand; nor is the\r\nman supposed to have achieved much who has achieved that position. I\r\nthink it would be otherwise if the ministers were the leaders of the\r\nlegislative Houses. To Congress itself would be given the power of\r\nquestioning and ultimately of controlling these ministers. The power\r\nof the President would no doubt be diminished as that of Congress\r\nwould be increased. But an alteration in that direction is in itself\r\ndesirable. It is the fault of the present system of government in the\r\nUnited States that the President has too much of power and weight,\r\nwhile the Congress of the nation lacks power and weight. As matters\r\nnow stand, Congress has not that dignity of position which it should\r\nhold; and it is without it because it is not endowed with that\r\ncontrol over the officers of the government which our Parliament is\r\nenabled to exercise.\r\n\r\nThe want of this close connection with Congress and the President's\r\nministers has been so much felt, that it has been found necessary\r\nto create a medium of communication. This has been done by a system\r\nwhich has now become a recognized part of the machinery of the\r\ngovernment, but which is, I believe, founded on no regularly\r\norganized authority. At any rate no provision is made for it in the\r\nconstitution; nor, as far as I am aware, has it been established by\r\nany special enactment or written rule. Nevertheless, I believe I\r\nam justified in saying that it has become a recognized link in the\r\nsystem of government adopted by the United States. In each House\r\nstanding committees are named, to which are delegated the special\r\nconsideration of certain affairs of state. There are, for instance,\r\ncommittees of foreign affairs, of finance, the judiciary committee,\r\nand others of a similar nature. To these committees are referred all\r\nquestions which come before the House bearing on the special subject\r\nto which each is devoted. Questions of taxation are referred to the\r\nfinance committee before they are discussed in the House; and the\r\nHouse, when it goes into such discussion, has before it the report of\r\nthe committee. In this way very much of the work of the legislature\r\nis done by branches of each House, and by selected men whose time and\r\nintellects are devoted to special subjects. It is easy to see that\r\nmuch time and useless debate may be thus saved, and I am disposed\r\nto believe that this system of committees has worked efficiently\r\nand beneficially. The mode of selection of the members has been\r\nso contrived as to give to each political party that amount of\r\npreponderance in each committee which such party holds in the House.\r\nIf the democrats have in the Senate a majority, it would be within\r\ntheir power to vote none but democrats into the committee on finance;\r\nbut this would be manifestly unjust to the republican party, and the\r\ninjustice would itself frustrate the object of the party in power;\r\ntherefore the democrats simply vote to themselves a majority in each\r\ncommittee, keeping to themselves as great a preponderance in the\r\ncommittee as they have in the whole House, and arranging also that\r\nthe chairman of the committee shall belong to their own party. By\r\nthese committees the chief legislative measures of the country are\r\noriginated and inaugurated,--as they are with us by the ministers of\r\nthe Crown, and the chairman of each committee is supposed to have\r\na certain amicable relation with that minister who presides over\r\nthe office with which his committee is connected. Mr. Sumner is at\r\npresent chairman of the committee on foreign affairs, and he is\r\npresumed to be in connection with Mr. Seward, who, as Secretary of\r\nState, has the management of the foreign relations of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that this supposed connection between the\r\ncommittees and the ministers is only a makeshift, showing by its\r\nexistence the absolute necessity of close communication between the\r\nexecutive and the legislative, but showing also by its imperfections\r\nthe great want of some better method of communication. In the first\r\nplace the chairman of the committee is in no way bound to hold any\r\ncommunication with the minister. He is simply a senator, and as such\r\nhas no ministerial duties, and can have none. He holds no appointment\r\nunder the President, and has no palpable connection with the\r\nexecutive. And then it is quite as likely that he may be opposed in\r\npolitics to the minister as that he may agree with him. If the two\r\nbe opposed to each other on general politics, it may be presumed\r\nthat they cannot act together in union on one special subject.\r\nNor, whether they act in union or do not so act, can either have\r\nany authority over the other. The minister is not responsible to\r\nCongress, nor is the chairman of the committee in any way bound\r\nto support the minister. It is presumed that the chairman must\r\nknow the minister's secrets, but the chairman may be bound by party\r\nconsiderations to use those secrets against the minister.\r\n\r\nThe system of committees appears to me to be good as regards the work\r\nof legislation. It seems well adapted to effect economy of time and\r\nthe application of special men to special services. But I am driven\r\nto think that that connection between the chairmen of the committees\r\nand the ministers, which I have attempted to describe, is an\r\narrangement very imperfect in itself, but plainly indicating the\r\nnecessity of some such close relation between the executive and the\r\nlegislature of the United States as does exist in the political\r\nsystem of Great Britain. With us the Queen's minister has a greater\r\nweight in Parliament than the President's minister could hold in\r\nCongress, because the Queen is bound to employ a minister in whom the\r\nParliament has confidence. As soon as such confidence ceases, the\r\nminister ceases to be minister. As the Crown has no politics of its\r\nown, it is simply necessary that the minister of the day should hold\r\nthe politics of the people as testified by their representatives. The\r\nmachinery of the President's Government cannot be made to work after\r\nthis fashion. The President himself is a political officer, and the\r\ncountry is bound to bear with his politics for four years, whatever\r\nthose politics may be. The ministry which he selects on coming to\r\nhis seat will probably represent a majority in Congress, seeing that\r\nthe same suffrages which have elected the President will also have\r\nelected the Congress. But there exists no necessity on the part of\r\nthe President to employ ministers who shall carry with them the\r\nsupport of Congress. If, however, the ministers sat in Congress,--if\r\nit were required of each minister that he should have a seat either\r\nin one House or in the other,--the President would, I think, find\r\nhimself constrained to change a ministry in which Congress should\r\ndecline to confide. It might not be so at first, but there would be a\r\ntendency in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe governing powers do not rest exclusively with the President, or\r\nwith the President and his ministers; they are shared in a certain\r\ndegree with the Senate, which sits from time to time in executive\r\nSession, laying aside at such periods its legislative character. It\r\nis this executive authority which lends so great a dignity to the\r\nSenate, gives it the privilege of preponderating over the other\r\nHouse, and makes it the political safeguard of the nation. The\r\nquestions of government as to which the Senate is empowered to\r\ninterfere are soon told. All treaties made by the President must be\r\nsanctioned by the Senate; and all appointments made by the President\r\nmust be confirmed by the Senate. The list is short, and one is\r\ndisposed to think, when first hearing it, that the thing itself does\r\nnot amount to much. But it does amount to very much; it enables the\r\nSenate to fetter the President, if the Senate should be so inclined,\r\nboth as regards foreign politics and home politics. A Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs at Washington may write what despatches he\r\npleases without reference to the Senate; but the Senate interferes\r\nbefore those despatches can have resulted in any fact which may\r\nbe detrimental to the nation. It is not only that the Senate is\r\nresponsible for such treaties as are made, but that the President\r\nis deterred from the making of treaties for which the Senate would\r\ndecline to make itself responsible. Even though no treaty should\r\never be refused its sanction by the Senate, the protecting power of\r\nthe Senate in that matter would not on that account have been less\r\nnecessary or less efficacious. Though the bars with which we protect\r\nour house may never have been tried by a thief, we do not therefore\r\nbelieve that our house would have been safe if such bars had\r\nbeen known to be wanting. And then, as to that matter of state\r\nappointments, is it not the fact that all governing powers consist in\r\nthe selection of the agents by whom the action of Government shall\r\nbe carried on? It must come to this, I imagine, when the argument\r\nis pushed home. The power of the most powerful man depends only\r\non the extent of his authority over his agents. According to the\r\nconstitution of the United States, the President can select no agent\r\neither at home or abroad, for purposes either of peace or war, or\r\nto the employment of whom the Senate does not agree with him. Such\r\na rule as this should save the nation from the use of disreputable\r\nagents as public servants. It might, perhaps, have done more towards\r\nsuch salvation than it has as yet effected;--and it may well be hoped\r\nthat it will do more in future.\r\n\r\nSuch are the executive powers of the Senate; and it is, I think,\r\nremarkable that the Senate has always used these powers with extreme\r\nmoderation. It has never shown a factious inclination to hinder\r\nGovernment by unnecessary interference, or a disposition to clip\r\nthe President's wings by putting itself altogether at variance with\r\nhim. I am not quite sure whether some fault may not have lain on the\r\nother side; whether the Senate may not have been somewhat slack in\r\nexercising the protective privileges given to it by the constitution.\r\nAnd here I cannot but remark how great is the deference paid to all\r\ngovernors and edicts of Government throughout the United States.\r\nOne would have been disposed to think that such a feeling would be\r\nstronger in an old country such as Great Britain than in a young\r\ncountry such as the States. But I think that it is not so. There\r\nis less disposition to question the action of government either at\r\nWashington or at New York, than there is in London. Men in America\r\nseem to be content when they have voted in their governors, and to\r\nfeel that for them all political action is over until the time shall\r\ncome for voting for others. And this feeling, which seems to prevail\r\namong the people, prevails also in both Houses of Congress. Bitter\r\ndenunciations against the President's policy or the President's\r\nministers are seldom heard. Speeches are not often made with the\r\nobject of impeding the action of Government. That so small and so\r\ngrave a body as the Senate should abstain from factious opposition to\r\nthe Government when employed on executive functions was perhaps to\r\nbe expected. It is of course well that it should be so. I confess,\r\nhowever, that it has appeared to me that the Senate has not used the\r\npower placed in its hands as freely as the constitution has intended.\r\nBut I look at the matter as an Englishman, and as an Englishman I\r\ncan endure no government action which is not immediately subject to\r\nParliamentary control.\r\n\r\nSuch are the governing powers of the United States. I think it will\r\nbe seen that they are much more limited in their scope of action than\r\nwith us; but within that scope of action much more independent and\r\nself-sufficient. And, in addition to this, those who exercise power\r\nin the United States are not only free from immediate responsibility,\r\nbut are not made subject to the hope or fear of future judgment.\r\nSuccess will bring no award, and failure no punishment. I am not\r\naware that any political delinquency has ever yet brought down\r\nretribution on the head of the offender in the United States, or\r\nthat any great deed has been held as entitling the doer of it to his\r\ncountry's gratitude. Titles of nobility they have none; pensions they\r\nnever give; and political disgrace is unknown. The line of politics\r\nwould seem to be cold and unalluring. It is cold;--and would be\r\nunalluring, were it not that as a profession it is profitable. In\r\nmuch of this I expect that a change will gradually take place. The\r\ntheory has been that public affairs should be in the hands of little\r\nmen. The theory was intelligible while the public affairs were small;\r\nbut they are small no longer, and that theory, I fancy, will have\r\nto alter itself. Great men are needed for the government, and in\r\norder to produce great men a career of greatness must be opened to\r\nthem. I can see no reason why the career and the men should not be\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE LAW COURTS AND LAWYERS OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not propose to make any attempt to explain in detail the\r\npractices and rules of the American Courts of Law. No one but a\r\nlawyer should trust himself with such a task, and no lawyer would be\r\nenabled to do so in the few pages which I shall here devote to the\r\nsubject. My present object is to explain, as far as I may be able to\r\ndo so, the existing political position of the country. As this must\r\ndepend more or less upon the power vested in the hands of the judges,\r\nand upon the tenure by which those judges hold their offices, I shall\r\nendeavour to describe the circumstances of the position in which the\r\nAmerican judges are placed; the mode in which they are appointed; the\r\ndifference which exists between the national judges and the State\r\njudges; and the extent to which they are or are not held in high\r\nesteem by the general public whom they serve.\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, be acknowledged that this last matter is one of\r\nalmost paramount importance to the welfare of a country. At home in\r\nEngland we do not realize the importance to us in a political as\r\nwell as social view of the dignity and purity of our judges, because\r\nwe take from them all that dignity and purity can give as a matter\r\nof course. The honesty of our bench is to us almost as the honesty\r\nof heaven. No one dreams that it can be questioned or become\r\nquestionable, and therefore there are but few who are thankful for\r\nits blessings. Few Englishmen care to know much about their own\r\ncourts of law, or are even aware that the judges are the protectors\r\nof their liberties and property. There are the men, honoured on\r\nall sides, trusted by every one, removed above temptation, holding\r\npositions which are coveted by all lawyers. That it is so is enough\r\nfor us; and as the good thence derived comes to us so easily, we\r\nforget to remember that we might possibly be without it. The law\r\ncourts of the States have much in their simplicity and the general\r\nintelligence of their arrangements to recommend them. In all ordinary\r\ncauses justice is done with economy, with expedition, and I believe\r\nwith precision. But they strike an Englishman at once as being\r\ndeficient in splendour and dignity, as wanting that reverence which\r\nwe think should be paid to words falling from the bench, and as being\r\nin danger as to that purity, without which a judge becomes a curse\r\namong a people, a chief of thieves, and an arch-minister of the Evil\r\nOne. I say as being in danger;--not that I mean to hint that such\r\nwant of purity has been shown, or that I wish it to be believed that\r\njudges with itching palms do sit upon the American bench; but because\r\nthe present political tendency of the State arrangements threatens\r\nto produce such danger. We in England trust implicitly in our\r\njudges,--not because they are Englishmen, but because they are\r\nEnglishmen carefully selected for their high positions. We should\r\nsoon distrust them if they were elected by universal suffrage from\r\nall the barristers and attorneys practising in the different courts;\r\nand so elected only for a period of years, as is the case with\r\nreference to many of the State judges in America. Such a mode of\r\nappointment would, in our estimation, at once rob them of their\r\nprestige. And our distrust would not be diminished if the pay\r\naccorded to the work were so small that no lawyer in good practice\r\ncould afford to accept the situation. When we look at a judge in\r\ncourt, venerable beneath his wig and adorned with his ermine, we do\r\nnot admit to ourselves that that high officer is honest because he\r\nis placed above temptation by the magnitude of his salary. We do not\r\nsuspect that he, as an individual, would accept bribes and favour\r\nsuitors if he were in want of money. But, still, we know as a fact\r\nthat an honest man, like any other good article, must be paid for at\r\na high price. Judges and bishops expect those rewards which all men\r\nwin who rise to the highest steps on the ladder of their profession.\r\nAnd the better they are paid, within measure, the better they will be\r\nas judges and bishops. Now, the judges in America are not well paid,\r\nand the best lawyers cannot afford to sit upon the bench.\r\n\r\nWith us the practice of the law and the judicature of our law courts\r\nare divided. We have Chancery barristers and Common Law barristers;\r\nand we have Chancery Courts and Courts of Common Law. In the States\r\nthere is no such division. It prevails neither in the national or\r\nfederal courts of the United States, nor in the courts of any of the\r\nseparate States. The code of laws used by the Americans is taken\r\nalmost entirely from our English laws,--or rather, I should say, the\r\nfederal code used by the nation is so taken, and also the various\r\ncodes of the different States,--as each State takes whatever laws it\r\nmay think fit to adopt. Even the precedents of our courts are held as\r\nprecedents in the American courts, unless they chance to jar against\r\nother decisions given specially in their own courts with reference to\r\ncases of their own. In this respect the founders of the American law\r\nproceedings have shown a conservation bias and a predilection for\r\nEnglish written and traditional law, which are much at variance with\r\nthat general democratic passion for change by which we generally\r\npresume the Americans to have been actuated at their revolution. But\r\nthough they have kept our laws, and still respect our reading of\r\nthose laws, they have greatly altered and simplified our practice.\r\nWhether a double set of courts for Law and Equity are or are not\r\nexpedient, either in the one country or in the other, I do not\r\npretend to know. It is, however, the fact that there is no such\r\ndivision in the States.\r\n\r\nMoreover there is no division in the legal profession. With us\r\nwe have barristers and attorneys. In the States the same man is\r\nboth barrister and attorney; and, which is perhaps in effect more\r\nstartling, every lawyer is presumed to undertake law cases of every\r\ndescription. The same man makes your will, sells your property,\r\nbrings an action for you of trespass against your neighbour,\r\ndefends you when you are accused of murder, recovers for you\r\ntwo-and-sixpence, and pleads for you in an argument of three days'\r\nlength when you claim to be the sole heir to your grandfather's\r\nenormous property. I need not describe how terribly distinct with\r\nus is the difference between an attorney and a barrister, or how\r\nmuch further than the poles asunder is the future Lord Chancellor,\r\npleading before the Lords Justices at Lincoln's Inn, from the\r\ngentleman who at the Old Bailey is endeavouring to secure the\r\npersonal liberty of the ruffian who a week or two since walked off\r\nwith all your silver spoons. In the States no such differences are\r\nknown. A lawyer there is a lawyer, and is supposed to do for any\r\nclient any work that a lawyer may be called on to perform. But though\r\nthis is the theory, and as regards any difference between attorney\r\nand barrister is altogether the fact, the assumed practice is not,\r\nand cannot be maintained as regards the various branches of a\r\nlawyer's work. When the population was smaller, and the law cases\r\nwere less complicated, the theory and the practice were no doubt\r\nalike. As great cities have grown up, and properties large in amount\r\nhave come under litigation, certain lawyers have found it expedient\r\nand practicable to devote themselves to special branches of their\r\nprofession. But this, even up to the present time, has not been done\r\nopenly as it were, or with any declaration made by a man as to his\r\nown branch of his calling. I believe that no such declaration on his\r\npart would be in accordance with the rules of the profession. He\r\ntakes a partner, however, and thus attains his object;--or more than\r\none partner, and then the business of the house is divided among them\r\naccording to their individual specialities. One will plead in court,\r\nanother will give chamber-counsel, and a third will take that lower\r\nbusiness which must be done, but which first-rate men hardly like to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be perceived that law in this way will be made\r\ncheaper to the litigant. Whether or no that may be an unadulterated\r\nadvantage, I have my doubts. I fancy that the united professional\r\nincomes of all the lawyers in the States would exceed in amount those\r\nmade in England. In America every man of note seems to be a lawyer,\r\nand I am told that any lawyer who will work may make a sure income.\r\nIf it be so, it would seem that Americans per head pay as much or\r\nmore for their law as men do in England. It may be answered that they\r\nget more law for their money. That may be possible, and even yet\r\nthey may not be gainers. I have been inclined to think that there\r\nis an unnecessarily slow and expensive ceremonial among us in the\r\nemployment of barristers through a third party; it has seemed that\r\nthe man of learning, on whose efforts the litigant really depends, is\r\ndivided off from his client and employer by an unfair barrier, used\r\nonly to enhance his own dignity and give an unnecessary grandeur\r\nto his position. I still think that the fault with us lies in this\r\ndirection. But I feel that I am less inclined to demand an immediate\r\nalteration in our practice than I was before I had seen any of the\r\nAmerican courts of law.\r\n\r\nIt should be generally understood that lawyers are the leading men in\r\nthe States, and that the governance of the country has been almost\r\nentirely in their hands ever since the political life of the nation\r\nbecame full and strong. All public business of importance falls\r\nnaturally into their hands, as with us it falls into the hands of men\r\nof settled wealth and landed property. Indeed, the fact on which I\r\ninsist is much more clear and defined in the States than it is with\r\nus. In England the lawyers also obtain no inconsiderable share of\r\npolitical and municipal power. The latter is perhaps more in the\r\nhands of merchants and men in trade than of any other class; and even\r\nthe highest seats of political greatness are more open with us to the\r\nworld at large than they seem to be in the States to any that are not\r\nlawyers. Since the days of Washington every President of the United\r\nStates has, I think, been a lawyer, excepting General Taylor. Other\r\nPresidents have been generals, but then they have also been lawyers.\r\nGeneral Jackson was a successful lawyer. Almost all the leading\r\npoliticians of the present day are lawyers. Seward, Cameron, Welles,\r\nStanton, Chase, Sumner, Crittenden, Harris, Fessenden, are all\r\nlawyers. Webster, Clay, Calhoun, and Cass were lawyers. Hamilton and\r\nJay were lawyers. Any man with an ambition to enter upon public life\r\nbecomes a lawyer as a matter of course. It seems as though a study\r\nand practice of the law were necessary ingredients in a man's\r\npreparation for political life. I have no doubt that a very large\r\nproportion of both Houses of legislature would be found to consist of\r\nlawyers. I do not remember that I know of the circumstance of more\r\nthan one senator who is not a lawyer. Lawyers form the ruling class\r\nin America as the landowners do with us. With us that ruling class is\r\nthe wealthiest class; but this is not so in the States. It might be\r\nwished that it were so.\r\n\r\nThe great and ever-present difference between the national or federal\r\naffairs of the United States government, and the affairs of the\r\ngovernment of each individual State should be borne in mind at all\r\ntimes by those who desire to understand the political position of the\r\nStates. Till this be realized no one can have any correct idea of the\r\nbearings of politics in that country. As a matter of course we in\r\nEngland have been inclined to regard the Government and Congress of\r\nWashington as paramount throughout the States, in the same way that\r\nthe Government of Downing Street and the Parliament of Westminster\r\nare paramount through the British isles. Such a mistake is natural;\r\nbut not the less would it be a fatal bar to any correct understanding\r\nof the constitution of the United States. The national and State\r\ngovernments are independent of each other, and so also are the\r\nnational and State tribunals. Each of these separate tribunals has\r\nits own judicature, its own judges, its own courts, and its own\r\nfunctions. Nor can the supreme tribunal at Washington exercise any\r\nauthority over the proceedings of the Courts in the different States,\r\nor influence the decisions of their judges. For not only are the\r\nnational judges and the State judges independent of each other; but\r\nthe laws in accordance with which they are bound to act, may be\r\nessentially different. The two tribunals, those of the nation and\r\nof the State, are independent and final in their several spheres.\r\nOn a matter of State jurisprudence no appeal lies from the supreme\r\ntribunal of New York or Massachusetts to the supreme tribunal of the\r\nnation at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe national tribunals are of two classes. First, there is the\r\nSupreme Court specially ordained by the constitution. And then there\r\nare such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time see fit to\r\nestablish. Congress has no power to abolish the Supreme Court, or to\r\nerect another tribunal superior to it. This court sits at Washington,\r\nand is a final court of appeal from the inferior national courts\r\nof the federal empire. A system of inferior courts, inaugurated by\r\nCongress, has existed for about sixty years. Each State for purposes\r\nof national jurisprudence is constituted as a district; some few\r\nlarge States, such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, being\r\ndivided into two districts. Each district has one district court\r\npresided over by one judge. National causes in general, both civil\r\nand criminal, are commenced in these district courts, and those\r\ninvolving only small amounts are ended there. Above these district\r\ncourts are the national circuit courts, the districts or States\r\nhaving been grouped into circuits as the counties are grouped with\r\nus. To each of these circuits is assigned one of the judges of the\r\nSupreme Court of Washington, who is the ex-officio judge of that\r\ncircuit, and who therefore travels as do our Common Law judges. In\r\neach district he sits with the judge of that district, and they two\r\ntogether form the circuit court. Appeals from the district court\r\nlie to the circuit court in cases over a certain amount, and also\r\nin certain criminal cases. It follows therefore that appeals lie\r\nfrom one judge to the same judge when sitting with another,--an\r\narrangement which would seem to be fraught with some inconvenience.\r\nCertain causes, both civil and criminal, are commenced in the circuit\r\ncourts. From the circuit courts the appeal lies to the Supreme Court\r\nat Washington; but such appeal beyond the circuit court is not\r\nallowed in cases which are of small magnitude or which do not involve\r\nprinciples of importance. If there be a division of opinion in the\r\ncircuit court the case goes to the Supreme Court;--from whence it\r\nmight be inferred that all cases brought from the district court to\r\nthe circuit court would be sent on to the Supreme Court, unless the\r\ncircuit judge agreed with the district judge; for the district judge\r\nhaving given his judgment in the inferior court, would probably\r\nadhere to it in the superior court. No appeal lies to the Supreme\r\nCourt at Washington in criminal cases.\r\n\r\nAll questions that concern more than one State, or that are litigated\r\nbetween citizens of different States, or which are international in\r\ntheir bearing, come before the national judges. All cases in which\r\nforeigners are concerned, or the rights of foreigners, are brought\r\nor may be brought into the national courts. So also are all causes\r\naffecting the Union itself, or which are governed by the laws of\r\nCongress and not by the laws of any individual State. All questions\r\nof Admiralty law and maritime jurisdiction, and cases affecting\r\nambassadors or consuls, are there tried. Matters relating to the\r\nPost-office, to the Customs, the collection of national taxes, to\r\npatents, to the army and navy, and to the mint, are tried in the\r\nnational courts. The theory is that the national tribunals shall\r\nexpound and administer the national laws and treaties, protect\r\nnational offices and national rights; and that foreigners and\r\ncitizens of other States shall not be required to submit to the\r\ndecisions of the State tribunals;--in fact, that national tribunals\r\nshall take cognizance of all matters as to which the general\r\ngovernment of the nation is responsible. In most of such cases the\r\nnational tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction. In others it is\r\noptional with the plaintiff to select his tribunal. It is then\r\noptional with the defendant, if brought into a State court, to\r\nremain there or to remove his cause into the national tribunal. The\r\nprinciple is, that either at the beginning, or ultimately, such\r\nquestions shall or may be decided by the national tribunals. If in\r\nany suit properly cognizable in a State court the decision should\r\nturn on a clause in the constitution, or on a law of the United\r\nStates, or on the act of a national offence, or on the validity of\r\na national act, an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates and to its officers. The object has been to give to the\r\nnational tribunals of the nation full cognizance of its own laws,\r\ntreaties, and congressional acts.\r\n\r\nThe judges of all the national tribunals, of whatever grade or rank,\r\nhold their offices for life, and are removable only on impeachment.\r\nThey are not even removable on an address of Congress; thus holding\r\non a firmer tenure even than our own judges, who may, I believe, be\r\nmoved on an address by Parliament. The judges in America are not\r\nentitled to any pension or retiring allowances; and as there is not,\r\nas regards the judges of the national courts, any proviso that they\r\nshall cease to sit after a certain age, they are, in fact, immoveable\r\nwhatever may be their infirmities. Their position in this respect\r\nis not good, seeing that their salaries will hardly admit of their\r\nmaking adequate provision for the evening of life. The salary of\r\nthe Chief Justice of the United States is only £1300 per annum. All\r\njudges of the national courts of whatever rank are appointed by the\r\nPresident, but their appointments must be confirmed by the Senate.\r\nThis proviso, however, gives to the Senate practically but little\r\npower, and is rarely used in opposition to the will of the President.\r\nIf the President name one candidate, who on political grounds is\r\ndistasteful to a majority of the Senate, it is not probable that a\r\nsecond nomination made by him will be more satisfactory. This seems\r\nnow to be understood, and the nomination of the cabinet ministers\r\nand of the judges, as made by the President, are seldom set aside or\r\ninterfered with by the Senate, unless on grounds of purely personal\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nThe position of the national judges as to their appointments and mode\r\nof tenure is very different from that of the State judges, to whom in\r\na few lines I shall more specially allude. This should, I think, be\r\nspecially noticed by Englishmen when criticising the doings of the\r\nAmerican courts. I have observed statements made to the effect that\r\ndecisions given by American judges as to international or maritime\r\naffairs affecting English interests could not be trusted, because\r\nthe judges so giving them would have been elected by popular vote,\r\nand would be dependent on the popular voice for reappointment. This\r\nis not so. Judges are appointed by popular vote in very many of\r\nthe States. But all matters affecting shipping, and all questions\r\ntouching foreigners are tried in the national courts before judges\r\nwho have been appointed for life. I should not myself have had any\r\nfear with reference to the ultimate decision in the affair of Slidell\r\nand Mason had the \"Trent\" been carried into New York. I would,\r\nhowever, by no means say so much had the cause been one for trial\r\nbefore the tribunals of the State of New York.\r\n\r\nI have been told that we in England have occasionally fallen into\r\nthe error of attributing to the Supreme Court at Washington a quasi\r\npolitical power which it does not possess. This court can give no\r\nopinion to any department of the Government, nor can it decide upon\r\nor influence any subject that has not come before it as a regularly\r\nlitigated case in law. Though especially founded by the constitution,\r\nit has no peculiar power under the constitution, and stands in no\r\npeculiar relation either to that or to Acts of Congress. It has no\r\nother power to decide on the constitutional legality of an act of\r\nCongress or an act of a State legislature or of a public officer than\r\nevery court, State and national, high and low, possesses and is bound\r\nto exercise. It is simply the national court of last appeal.\r\n\r\nIn the different States such tribunals have been established as each\r\nState by its constitution and legislation has seen fit to adopt. The\r\nStates are entirely free on this point. The usual course is to have\r\none Supreme Court, sometimes called by that name, sometimes the\r\nCourt of Appeals, and sometimes the Court of Errors. Then they have\r\nsuch especial courts as their convenience may dictate. The State\r\njurisprudence includes all causes not expressly or by necessary\r\nimplication secured to the national courts. The tribunals of the\r\nStates have exclusive control over domestic relations, religion,\r\neducation, the tenure and descent of land, the inheritance of\r\nproperty, police regulations, municipal economy, and all matters\r\nof internal trade. In this category of course come the relations\r\nof husband and wife, parent and child, master and servant, owner\r\nand slave, guardian and ward, tradesman and apprentice. So also\r\ndo all police and criminal regulations not external in their\r\ncharacter,--highways, railroads, canals, schools, colleges, the\r\nrelief of paupers, and those thousand other affairs of the world\r\nby which men are daily surrounded in their own homes and their own\r\ndistricts. As to such subjects Congress can make no law, and over\r\nthem Congress and the national tribunals have no jurisdiction.\r\nCongress cannot say that a man shall be hung for murder in New York;\r\nnor if a man be condemned to be hung in New York can the President\r\npardon him. The legislature of New York must say whether or no\r\nhanging shall be the punishment adjudged to murder in that State;\r\nand the Governor of the State of New York must pronounce the man's\r\npardon,--if it be that he is to be pardoned. But Congress must decide\r\nwhether or no a man shall be hung for murder committed on the high\r\nseas, or in the national forts or arsenals; and in such a case it is\r\nfor the President to give or to refuse the pardon.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the States are appointed as the constitution or the\r\nlaws of each State may direct in that matter. The appointments, I\r\nthink, in all the old States were formerly vested in the Governor. In\r\nsome States such is still the case. In some, if I am not mistaken,\r\nthe nomination is now made, directly, by the legislature. But in\r\nmost of the States the power of appointing has been claimed by the\r\npeople, and the judges are voted in by popular election, just as the\r\nPresident of the Union and the Governors of the different States\r\nare voted in. There has for some years been a growing tendency in\r\nthis direction, and the people in most of the States have claimed\r\nthe power;--or rather the power has been given to the people by\r\npoliticians who have wished to get into their hands in this way the\r\npatronage of the courts. But now, at the present moment, there is\r\narising a strong feeling of the inexpediency of appointing judges in\r\nsuch a manner. An antidemocratic bias is taking possession of men's\r\nminds, causing a reaction against that tendency to universal suffrage\r\nin everything which prevailed before the war began. As to this matter\r\nof the mode of appointing judges, I have heard but one opinion\r\nexpressed; and I am inclined to think that a change will be made in\r\none State after another, as the constitutions of the different States\r\nare revised. Such revisions take place generally at periods of about\r\ntwenty-five years' duration. If, therefore, it be acknowledged that\r\nthe system be bad, the error can be soon corrected.\r\n\r\nNor is this mode of appointment the only evil that has been adopted\r\nin the State judicatures. The judges in most of the States are not\r\nappointed for life, nor even during good behaviour. They enter their\r\nplaces for a certain term of years, varying from fifteen down, I\r\nbelieve, to seven. I do not know whether any are appointed for a term\r\nof less than seven years. When they go out they have no pensions; and\r\nas a lawyer who has been on the bench for seven years can hardly\r\nrecall his practice, and find himself at once in receipt of his old\r\nprofessional income, it may easily be imagined how great will be\r\nthe judge's anxiety to retain his position on the bench. This he\r\ncan do only by the universal suffrages of the people, by political\r\npopularity, and a general standing of that nature which enables a man\r\nto come forth as the favourite candidate of the lower orders. This\r\nmay or may not be well when the place sought for is one of political\r\npower,--when the duties required are political in all their bearings.\r\nBut no one can think it well when the place sought for is a judge's\r\nseat on the bench;--when the duties required are solely judicial.\r\nWhatever hitherto may have been the conduct of the judges in the\r\ncourts of the different States, whether or no impurity has yet crept\r\nin, and the sanctity of justice has yet been outraged, no one can\r\ndoubt the tendency of such an arrangement. At present even a few\r\nvisits to the courts constituted in this manner will convince an\r\nobserver that the judges on the bench are rather inferior than\r\nsuperior to the lawyers who practise before them. The manner of\r\naddress, the tone of voice, the lack of dignity in the judge, and the\r\nassumption by the lawyer before him of a higher authority than his,\r\nall tell this tale. And then the judges in these courts are not paid\r\nat a rate which will secure the services of the best men. They vary\r\nin the different States, running from about £600 to about £1000 per\r\nannum. But a successful lawyer practising in the courts in which\r\nthese judges sit, not unfrequently earns £3000 a year. A professional\r\nincome of £2000 a year is not considered very high. When the\r\ndifferent conditions of the bench are considered, when it is\r\nremembered that the judge may lose his place after a short term of\r\nyears, and that during that short term of years he receives a payment\r\nmuch less than that earned by his successful professional brethren,\r\nit can hardly be expected that first-rate judges should be found. The\r\nresult is seen daily in society. You meet Judge This and Judge That,\r\nnot knowing whether they are ex-judges or in-judges; but you soon\r\nlearn that your friends do not hold any very high social position on\r\naccount of their forensic dignity.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, but just to add that in Massachusetts, which I cannot\r\nbut regard as in many respects the noblest of the States, the judges\r\nare appointed by the Governor, and are appointed for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIAL POSITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Americans are proud of much that they have done in this war, and\r\nindeed much has been done which may justify pride; but of nothing are\r\nthey so proud as of the noble dimensions and quick growth of their\r\nGovernment debt. That Mr. Secretary Chase, the American Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, participates in this feeling I will not venture to\r\nsay; but if he do not, he is well nigh the only man in the States\r\nwho does not do so. The amount of expenditure has been a subject of\r\nalmost national pride, and the two million of dollars a day which has\r\nbeen roughly put down as the average cost of the war, has always been\r\nmentioned by northern men in a tone of triumph. This feeling is, I\r\nthink, intelligible; and although we cannot allude to it without a\r\ncertain amount of inward sarcasm,--a little gentle laughing in the\r\nsleeve, at the nature of this national joy, I am not prepared to say\r\nthat it is altogether ridiculous. If the country be found able and\r\nwilling to pay the bill, this triumph in the amount of the cost will\r\nhereafter be regarded as having been anything but ridiculous. In\r\nprivate life an individual will occasionally be known to lavish his\r\nwhole fortune on the accomplishment of an object which he conceives\r\nto be necessary to his honour. If the object be in itself good, and\r\nif the money be really paid, we do not laugh at such a man for the\r\nsacrifices which he makes.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I think that the object of the northern States in this\r\nwar has been good. I think that they could not have avoided the\r\nwar without dishonour, and that it was incumbent on them to make\r\nthemselves the arbiters of the future position of the South, whether\r\nthat future position shall or shall not be one of secession. This\r\nthey could only do by fighting. Had they acceded to secession\r\nwithout a civil war, they would have been regarded throughout Europe\r\nas having shown themselves inferior to the South, and would for\r\nmany years to come have lost that prestige which their spirit and\r\nenergy had undoubtedly won for them; and in their own country such\r\nsubmission on their part would have practically given to the South\r\nthe power of drawing the line of division between the two new\r\ncountries. That line, so drawn, would have given Virginia, Maryland,\r\nKentucky, and Missouri to the southern Republic. The great effect of\r\nthe war to the North will be, that the northern men will draw the\r\nline of secession, if any such line be drawn. I still think that such\r\nline will ultimately be drawn, and that the southern States will be\r\nallowed to secede. But if it be so, Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri will not be found among these seceding States; and the line\r\nmay not improbably be driven south of North Carolina and Tennessee.\r\nIf this can be so, the object of the war will, I think, hereafter\r\nbe admitted to have been good. Whatever may be the cost in money of\r\njoining the States which I have named to a free-soil northern people,\r\ninstead of allowing them to be buried in that dismal swamp, which\r\na confederacy of southern slave States will produce, that cost can\r\nhardly be too much. At the present moment there exists in England a\r\nstrong sympathy with the South, produced partly by the unreasonable\r\nvituperation with which the North treated our Government at the\r\nbeginning of the war, and by the capture of Mason and Slidell; partly\r\nalso by that feeling of good-will which a looker-on at a combat\r\nalways has for the weaker side. But, although this sympathy does\r\nundoubtedly exist, I do not imagine that many Englishmen are of\r\nopinion that a confederacy of southern slave States will ever offer\r\nto the general civilization of the world very many attractions. It\r\ncannot be thought that the South will equal the North in riches, in\r\nenergy, in education, or general well-being. Such has not been our\r\nexperience of any slave country; such has not been our experience of\r\nany tropical country; and such especially has not been our experience\r\nof the southern States of the North American Union. I am no\r\nabolitionist; but to me it seems impossible that any Englishman\r\nshould really advocate the cause of slavery against the cause of\r\nfree soil. There are the slaves, and I know that they cannot be\r\nabolished,--neither they nor their chains; but, for myself, I will\r\nnot willingly join my lot with theirs. I do not wish to have dealings\r\nwith the African negro either as a free man or as a slave, if I can\r\navoid them, believing that his employment by me in either capacity\r\nwould lead to my own degradation.* Such, I think, are the feelings of\r\nEnglishmen generally on this matter. And if such be the case, will it\r\nnot be acknowledged that the northern men have done well to fight for\r\na line which shall add five or six States to that Union which will in\r\ntruth be a union of free men, rather than to that Confederacy which,\r\neven if successful, must owe its success to slavery?\r\n\r\n  *In saying this I fear that I shall be misunderstood, let me\r\n   use what foot-note or other mode of protestation I may to guard\r\n   myself. In thus speaking of the African negro, I do not venture to\r\n   despise the work of God's hands. That He has made the negro, for\r\n   His own good purposes, as He has the Esquimaux, I am aware. And I\r\n   am aware that it is my duty, as it is the duty of us all, to see\r\n   that no injury be done to him, and, if possible, to assist him in\r\n   his condition. When I declare that I desire no dealings with the\r\n   negro, I speak of him in the position in which I now find him,\r\n   either as a free servant or a slave. In either position he impedes\r\n   the civilization and the progress of the white man.\r\n\r\nIn considering this matter it must be remembered that the five\r\nor six States of which we are speaking are at present slave\r\nStates, but that, with the exception of Virginia,--of part only of\r\nVirginia,--they are not wedded to slavery. But even in Virginia,\r\ngreat as has been the gain which has accrued to that unhappy State\r\nfrom the breeding of slaves for the southern market,--even in\r\nVirginia slavery would soon die out if she were divided from the\r\nSouth, and joined to the North. In those other States, in Maryland,\r\nin Kentucky, and in Missouri there is no desire to perpetuate the\r\ninstitution. They have been slave States, and as such have resented\r\nthe rabid abolition of certain northern orators. Had it not been for\r\nthose orators, and their oratory, the soil of Kentucky would now have\r\nbeen free. Those five or six States are now slave States; but a line\r\nof secession drawn south of them will be the line which cuts off\r\nslavery from the North. If those States belong to the North when\r\nsecession shall be accomplished, they will belong to it as free\r\nStates; but if they belong to the South, they will belong to the\r\nSouth as slave States. If they belong to the North, they will become\r\nrich as the North is, and will share in the education of the North.\r\nIf they belong to the South they will become poor as the South\r\nis, and will share in the ignorance of the South. If we presume\r\nthat secession will be accomplished,--and I for one am of that\r\nopinion,--has it not been well that a war should be waged with\r\nsuch an object as this? If those five or six States can be gained,\r\nstretching east and west from the Atlantic to the centre of the\r\ncontinent, hundreds of miles beyond the Mississippi, and north and\r\nsouth over four degrees of latitude,--if that extent of continent can\r\nbe added to the free soil of the northern territory, will not the\r\ncontest that has done this have been worth any money that can have\r\nbeen spent on it?\r\n\r\nSo much as to the object to be gained by the money spent on the war!\r\nAnd I think that in estimating the nature of the financial position\r\nwhich the war has produced, it was necessary that we should consider\r\nthe value of the object which has been in dispute. The object I\r\nmaintain has been good. Then comes the question whether or no the\r\nbill will be fairly paid;--whether they who have spent the money will\r\nset about that disagreeable task of settling the account with a true\r\npurpose and an honest energy. And this question splits itself into\r\ntwo parts. Will the Americans honestly wish to pay the bill; and if\r\nthey do so wish, will they have the power to pay it? Again that last\r\nquestion must be once more divided. Will they have the power to pay,\r\nas regards the actual possession of the means, and if possessing\r\nthem, will they have the power of access to those means?\r\n\r\nThe nation has obtained for itself an evil name for repudiation. We\r\nall know that Pennsylvania behaved badly about her money affairs,\r\nalthough she did at last pay her debts. We all know that Mississippi\r\nhas behaved very badly about her money affairs, and has never paid\r\nher debts, nor does she intend to pay them. And, which is worse than\r\nthis, for it applies to the nation generally and not to individual\r\nStates, we all know that it was made a matter of boast in the States\r\nthat in the event of a war with England the enormous amount of\r\nproperty held by Englishmen in the States should be confiscated.\r\nThat boast was especially made in the mercantile city of New York;\r\nand when the matter was discussed it seemed as though no American\r\nrealized the iniquity of such a threat. It was not apparently\r\nunderstood that such a confiscation on account of a war would be an\r\nact of national robbery justified simply by the fact that the power\r\nof committing it would be in the hands of the robbers. Confiscation\r\nof so large an amount of wealth would be a smart thing, and men did\r\nnot seem to perceive that any disgrace would attach to it in the eyes\r\nof the world at large. I am very anxious not to speak harsh words of\r\nthe Americans; but when questions arise as to pecuniary arrangements\r\nI find myself forced to acknowledge that great precaution is at any\r\nrate necessary.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, I am not sure that we shall be fair if we allow\r\nourselves to argue as to the national purpose in this matter from\r\nsuch individual instances of dishonesty as those which I have\r\nmentioned. I do not think it is to be presumed that the United States\r\nas a nation will repudiate its debts because two separate States may\r\nhave been guilty of repudiation. Nor am I disposed to judge of the\r\nhonesty of the people generally from the dishonest threatenings of\r\nNew York, made at a moment in which a war with England was considered\r\nimminent. I do believe that the nation, as a nation, will be as ready\r\nto pay for the war as it has been ready to carry on the war. That\r\n\"ignorant impatience of taxation,\" to which it is supposed that we\r\nBritons are very subject, has not been a complaint rife among the\r\nAmericans generally. We, in England, are inclined to believe that\r\nhitherto they have known nothing of the merits and demerits of\r\ntaxation, and have felt none of its annoyances, because their entire\r\nnational expenditure has been defrayed by light Custom duties; but\r\nthe levies made in the separate States for State purposes, or chiefly\r\nfor municipal purposes, have been very heavy. They are, however,\r\ncollected easily, and, as far as I am aware, without any display of\r\nignorant impatience. Indeed, an American is rarely impatient of any\r\nordained law. Whether he be told to do this, or to pay for that, or\r\nto abstain from the other, he does do and pay and abstain without\r\ngrumbling, provided that he has had a hand in voting for those\r\nwho made the law and for those who carry out the law. The people\r\ngenerally have, I think, recognized the fact that they will have to\r\nput their necks beneath the yoke, as the peoples of other nations\r\nhave put theirs, and support the weight of a great national debt.\r\nWhen the time comes for the struggle,--for the first uphill heaving\r\nagainst the terrible load which they will henceforth have to drag\r\nwith them in their career, I think it will be found that they are not\r\nill-inclined to put their shoulders to the work.\r\n\r\nThen as to their power of paying the bill! We are told that the\r\nwealth of a nation consists in its labour, and that that nation is\r\nthe most wealthy which can turn out of hand the greatest amount of\r\nwork. If this be so the American States must form a very wealthy\r\nnation, and as such be able to support a very heavy burden. No one,\r\nI presume, doubts that that nation which works the most, or works\r\nrather to the best effect, is the richest. On this account England is\r\nricher than other countries, and is able to bear, almost without the\r\nsign of an effort, a burden which would crush any other land. But\r\nof this wealth the States own almost as much as Great Britain owns.\r\nThe population of the northern States is industrious, ambitious of\r\nwealth, and capable of work as is our population. It possesses, or is\r\npossessed by, that restless longing for labour which creates wealth\r\nalmost unconsciously. Whether this man be rich or be a bankrupt,\r\nwhether the bankers of that city fail or make their millions, the\r\ncreative energies of the American people will not become dull.\r\nIdleness is impossible to them, and therefore poverty is impossible.\r\nIndustry and intellect together will always produce wealth; and\r\nneither industry nor intellect is ever wanting to an American. They\r\nare the two gifts with which the fairy has endowed him. When she\r\nshall have added honesty as a third, the tax-gatherer can desire no\r\nbetter country in which to exercise his calling.\r\n\r\nI cannot myself think that all the millions that are being spent\r\nwould weigh upon the country with much oppression, if the weight were\r\nonce properly placed upon the muscles that will have to bear it. The\r\ndifficulty will be in the placing of the weight. It has, I know,\r\nbeen argued that the circumstances under which our national debt\r\nhas extended itself to its present magnificent dimensions cannot be\r\nquoted as parallel to those of the present American debt, because we,\r\nwhile we were creating the debt, were taxing ourselves very heavily,\r\nwhereas the Americans have gone a-head with the creation of their\r\ndebt before they have levied a shilling on themselves towards the\r\npayment of those expenses for which the debt has been encountered.\r\nBut this argument, even if it were true in its gist, goes no way\r\ntowards proving that the Americans will be unable to pay. The\r\npopulation of the present free-soil States is above eighteen\r\nmillions; that of the States which will probably belong to the Union\r\nif secession be accomplished is about twenty-two millions. At a time\r\nwhen our debt had amounted to six hundred millions sterling, we\r\nhad no population such as that to bear the burden. It may be said\r\nthat we had more amassed wealth than they have. But I take it that\r\nthe amassed wealth of any country can go but a very little way in\r\ndefraying the wants or in paying the debts of a people. We again come\r\nback to the old maxim, that the labour of a country is its wealth;\r\nand that a country will be rich or poor in accordance with the\r\nintellectual industry of its people.\r\n\r\nBut the argument drawn from that comparison between our own conduct\r\nwhen we were creating our debt, and the conduct of the Americans\r\nwhile they have been creating their debt,--during the twelve months\r\nfrom April 1, 1861, to March 31, 1862, let us say,--is hardly a fair\r\nargument. We, at any rate, knew how to tax ourselves,--if only the\r\ntaxes might be forthcoming. We were already well used to the work;\r\nand a minister with a willing House of Commons had all his material\r\nready to his hand. It has not been so in the United States. The\r\ndifficulty has not been with the people who should pay the taxes, but\r\nwith the minister and the Congress which did not know how to levy\r\nthem. Certainly not as yet have those who are now criticising the\r\ndoings on the other side of the water, a right to say that the\r\nAmerican people are unwilling to make personal sacrifices for the\r\ncarrying out of this war. No sign has as yet been shown of an\r\nunwillingness on the part of the people to be taxed. But wherever\r\na sign could be given, it has been given on the other side. The\r\nseparate States have taxed themselves very heavily for the support\r\nof the families of the absent soldiers. The extra allowances made\r\nto maimed men, amounting generally to twenty-four shillings a month,\r\nhave been paid by the States themselves, and have been paid almost\r\nwith too much alacrity.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that the Americans will show no unwillingness to pay\r\nthe amount of taxation which must be exacted from them; and I also\r\nthink that as regards their actual means they will have the power\r\nto pay it. But as regards their power of obtaining access to those\r\nmeans, I must confess that I see many difficulties in their way.\r\nIn the first place they have no financier,--no man who by natural\r\naptitude and by long continued contact with great questions of\r\nfinance, has enabled himself to handle the money affairs of a nation\r\nwith a master's hand. In saying this I do not intend to impute any\r\nblame to Mr. Chase, the present Secretary at the Treasury. Of his\r\nability to do the work properly, had he received the proper training,\r\nI am not able to judge. It is not that Mr. Chase is incapable. He may\r\nbe capable or incapable. But it is that he has not had the education\r\nof a national financier, and that he has no one at his elbow to help\r\nhim who has had that advantage.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are again brought to that general absence of state craft\r\nwhich has been the result of the American system of government. I am\r\nnot aware that our Chancellors of the Exchequer have in late years\r\nalways been great masters of finance; but they have at any rate been\r\namong money men and money matters, and have had financiers at their\r\nelbows if they have not deserved the name themselves. The very fact\r\nthat a Chancellor of the Exchequer sits in the House of Commons and\r\nis forced in that House to answer all questions on the subject of\r\nfinance, renders it impossible that he should be ignorant of the\r\nrudiments of the science. If you put a white cap on a man's head and\r\nplace him in a kitchen, he will soon learn to be a cook. But he will\r\nnever be made a cook by standing in the dining-room and seeing the\r\ndishes as they are brought up. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is our\r\ncook; and the House of Commons, not the Treasury chambers, is his\r\nkitchen. Let the Secretary of the United States Treasury sit in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. He would learn more there by contest with\r\nopposing members than he can do by any amount of study in his own\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nBut the House of Representatives itself has not as yet learned its\r\nown lesson with reference to taxation. When I say that the United\r\nStates are in want of a financier, I do not mean that the deficiency\r\nrests entirely with Mr. Chase. This necessity for taxation, and for\r\ntaxation at so tremendous a rate, has come suddenly, and has found\r\nthe representatives of the people unprepared for such work. To us, as\r\nI conceive, the science of taxation, in which we certainly ought to\r\nbe great, has come gradually. We have learned by slow lessons what\r\ntaxes will be productive, under what circumstances they will be most\r\nproductive, and at what point they will be made unproductive by their\r\nown weight. We have learned what taxes may be levied so as to afford\r\nfunds themselves, without injuring the proceeds of other taxes, and\r\nwe know what taxes should be eschewed as being specially oppressive\r\nto the general industry and injurious to the well-being of the\r\nnation. This has come of much practice, and even we, with all our\r\nexperience, have even got something to learn. But the public men\r\nin the States who are now devoting themselves to this matter of\r\ntaxing the people have, as yet, no such experience. That they\r\nhave inclination enough for the work is, I think, sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated by the national tax bill, the wording of which is now\r\nbefore me, and which will have been passed into law before this\r\nvolume can be published. It contains a list of every taxable article\r\non the earth or under the earth. A more sweeping catalogue of\r\ntaxation was probably never put forth. The Americans, it has been\r\nsaid by some of us, have shown no disposition to tax themselves for\r\nthis war; but before the war has as yet been well twelve months in\r\noperation, a bill has come out with a list of taxation so oppressive,\r\nthat it must, as regards many of its items, act against itself and\r\ncut its own throat. It will produce terrible fraud in its evasion,\r\nand create an army of excise officers who will be as locusts over\r\nthe face of the country. Taxes are to be laid on articles which I\r\nshould have said that universal consent had declared to be unfit for\r\ntaxation. Salt, soap, candles, oil, and other burning fluids, gas,\r\npins, paper, ink, and leather, are to be taxed. It was at first\r\nproposed that wheat-flour should be taxed, but that item has, I\r\nbelieve, been struck out of the bill in its passage through the\r\nHouse. All articles manufactured of cotton, wool, silk, worsted,\r\nflax, hemp, jute, india-rubber, gutta percha, wood (?), glass,\r\npottery wares, leather, paper, iron, steel, lead, tin, copper, zinc,\r\nbrass, gold and silver, horn, ivory, bone, bristles, wholly or in\r\npart, or of other materials, are to be taxed;--provided always that\r\nbooks, magazines, pamphlets, newspapers, and reviews shall not be\r\nregarded as manufactures. It will be said that the amount of taxation\r\nto be levied on the immense number of manufactured articles which\r\nmust be included in this list will be light,--the tax itself being\r\nonly 3 per cent. ad valorem. But with reference to every article,\r\nthere will be the necessity of collecting this 3 per cent.! As\r\nregards each article that is manufactured, some government official\r\nmust interfere to appraise its value and to levy the tax. Who shall\r\ndeclare the value of a barrel of wooden nutmegs; or how shall\r\nthe Excise-officer get his tax from every cobbler's stall in the\r\ncountry? And then tradesmen are to pay licences for their trades,--a\r\nconfectioner £2, a tallow-chandler £2, a horsedealer £2. Every man\r\nwhose business it is to sell horses shall be a horsedealer. True. But\r\nwho shall say whether or no it be a man's business to sell horses?\r\nAn apothecary £2, a photographer £2, a pedlar £4, £3, £2, or £1,\r\naccording to his mode of travelling. But if the gross receipts of any\r\nof the confectioners, tallow-chandlers, horsedealers, apothecaries,\r\nphotographers, pedlars, or the like do not exceed £200 a year, then\r\nsuch tradesmen shall not be required to pay for any licence at all.\r\nSurely such a proviso can only have been inserted with the express\r\nview of creating fraud and ill blood! But the greatest audacity has,\r\nI think, been shown in the levying of personal taxes,--such taxes\r\nas have been held to be peculiarly disagreeable among us, and have\r\nspecially brought down upon us the contempt of lightly-taxed people,\r\nwho, like the Americans, have known nothing of domestic interference.\r\nCarriages are to be taxed,--as they are with us. Pianos also are to\r\nbe taxed, and plate. It is not signified by this clause that such\r\narticles shall pay a tax, once for all, while in the maker's hands,\r\nwhich tax would no doubt fall on the future owner of such piano or\r\nplate; in such case the owner would pay, but would pay without any\r\npersonal contact with the tax-gatherer. But every owner of a piano or\r\nof plate is to pay annually according to the value of the articles\r\nhe owns. But perhaps the most audacious of all the proposed taxes\r\nis that on watches. Every owner of a watch is to pay 4_s._ a year\r\nfor a gold watch and 2_s._ a year for a silver watch! The American\r\ntax-gatherers will not like to be cheated. They will be very keen in\r\nsearching for watches. But who can say whether they or the carriers\r\nof watches will have the best of it in such a hunt. The tax-gatherers\r\nwill be as hounds ever at work on a cold scent. They will now be\r\nhot and angry, and then dull and disheartened. But the carriers of\r\nwatches who do not choose to pay will generally, one may predict, be\r\nable to make their points good.\r\n\r\nWith such a tax bill,--which I believe came into action on the 1st of\r\nMay, 1862,--the Americans are not fairly open to the charge of being\r\nunwilling to tax themselves. They have avoided none of the irritating\r\nannoyances of taxation, as also they have not avoided, or attempted\r\nto lighten for themselves, the dead weight of the burden. The dead\r\nweight they are right to endure without flinching; but their mode of\r\nlaying it on their own backs justifies me, I think, in saying that\r\nthey do not yet know how to obtain access to their own means. But\r\nthis bill applies simply to matters of excise. As I have said before,\r\nCongress, which has hitherto supported the government by custom\r\nduties, has also the power of levying excise duties, and now, in its\r\nfirst session since the commencement of the war, has begun to use\r\nthat power without much hesitation or bashfulness. As regards their\r\ntaxes levied at the Custom House, the government of the United States\r\nhas always been inclined to high duties, with the view of protecting\r\nthe internal trade and manufactures of the country. The amount\r\nrequired for national expenses was easily obtained, and these duties\r\nwere not regulated, as I think, so much with a view to the amount\r\nwhich might be collected, as to that of the effect which the tax\r\nmight have in fostering native industry. That, if I understand it,\r\nwas the meaning of Mr. Morrill's bill, which was passed immediately\r\non the secession of the southern members of Congress, and which\r\ninstantly enhanced the price of all foreign manufactured goods in the\r\nStates. But now the desire for protection, simply as protection, has\r\nbeen swallowed up in the acknowledged necessity for revenue; and the\r\nonly object to be recognized in the arrangement of the custom duties\r\nis the collection of the greatest number of dollars. This is fair\r\nenough. If the country can at such a crisis raise a better revenue\r\nby claiming a shilling a pound on coffee than it can by claiming\r\nsixpence, the shilling may be wisely claimed, even though many may\r\nthus be prohibited from the use of coffee. But then comes the great\r\nquestion, What duty will really give the greatest product? At what\r\nrate shall we tax coffee so as to get at the people's money? If it be\r\nso taxed that people won't use it, the tax cuts its own throat. There\r\nis some point at which the tax will be most productive; and also\r\nthere is a point up to which the tax will not operate to the serious\r\ninjury of the trade. Without the knowledge which should indicate\r\nthese points, a Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his myrmidons,\r\nwould be groping in the dark. As far as we can yet see, there is not\r\nmuch of such knowledge either in the Treasury Chambers or the House\r\nof Representatives at Washington.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest difficulty which the States will feel in obtaining\r\naccess to their own means of taxation, is that which is created by\r\nthe constitution itself, and to which I alluded when speaking of\r\nthe taxing powers which the constitution had given to Congress, and\r\nthose which it had denied to Congress. As to custom duties and excise\r\nduties, Congress can do what it pleases, as can the House of Commons.\r\nBut Congress cannot levy direct taxation according to its own\r\njudgment. In those matters of customs and excise, Congress and the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury will probably make many blunders; but\r\nhaving the power they will blunder through, and the money will be\r\ncollected. But direct taxation, in an available shape, is beyond the\r\npower of Congress under the existing rule of the constitution. No\r\nincome-tax, for instance, can be laid on the general incomes of the\r\nUnited States, that shall be universal throughout the States. An\r\nincome-tax can be levied, but it must be levied in proportion to the\r\nrepresentation. It is as though our Chancellor of the Exchequer, in\r\ncollecting an income-tax, were obliged to demand the same amount of\r\ncontribution from the town of Chester as from the town of Liverpool,\r\nbecause both Chester and Liverpool return two Members to Parliament.\r\nIn fitting his tax to the capacity of Chester, he would be forced to\r\nallow Liverpool to escape unscathed. No skill in money matters on\r\nthe part of the Treasury Secretary, and no aptness for finance on\r\nthe part of the Committee on Ways and Means, can avail here. The\r\nconstitution must apparently be altered before any serviceable resort\r\ncan be had to direct taxation. And yet, at such an emergency as\r\nthat now existing, direct taxation would probably give more ready\r\nassistance than can be afforded either by the Customs or the Excise.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated to me that this difficulty in the way of direct\r\ntaxation can be overcome without any change in the constitution.\r\nCongress could only levy from Rhode Island the same amount of\r\nincome-tax that it might levy from Iowa; but it will be competent to\r\nthe legislature of Rhode Island itself to levy what income-tax it may\r\nplease on itself; and to devote the proceeds to national or federal\r\npurposes. Rhode Island may do so; and so may Massachusetts, New\r\nYork, Connecticut, and the other rich Atlantic States. They may\r\ntax themselves according to their riches, while Iowa, Illinois,\r\nWisconsin, and such-like States are taxing themselves according to\r\ntheir poverty. I cannot myself think that it would be well to trust\r\nto the generosity of the separate States for the finances needed by\r\nthe national Government. We should not willingly trust to Yorkshire\r\nor Sussex to give us their contributions to the national income,\r\nespecially if Yorkshire and Sussex had small Houses of Commons of\r\ntheir own, in which that question of giving might be debated. It may\r\nbe very well for Rhode Island or New York to be patriotic! But what\r\nshall be done with any State that declines to evince such patriotism?\r\nThe legislatures of the different States may be invited to impose a\r\ntax of 5 per cent. on all incomes in each State; but what will be\r\ndone if Pennsylvania, for instance, should decline, or Illinois\r\nshould hesitate? What if the legislature of Massachusetts should\r\noffer 6 per cent., or that of New Jersey decide that 4 per cent.\r\nwas sufficient? For a while the arrangement might possibly be made\r\nto answer the desired purpose. During the first ebullition of high\r\nfeeling, the different States concerned might possibly vote the\r\namount of taxes required for federal purposes. I fear it would not be\r\nso, but we may allow that the chance is on the card. But it is not\r\nconceivable that such an arrangement should be continued when, after\r\na year or two, men came to talk over the war with calmer feelings\r\nand a more critical judgment. The State legislatures would become\r\ninquisitive, opinionative, and probably factious. They would be\r\nunwilling to act in so great a matter under the dictation of the\r\nfederal Congress; and by degrees one, and then another, would decline\r\nto give its aid to the central government. However broadly the\r\nacknowledgment may have been made, that the levying of direct taxes\r\nwas necessary for the nation, each State would be tempted to argue\r\nthat a wrong mode and a wrong rate of levying had been adopted, and\r\nwords would be forthcoming instead of money. A resort to such a mode\r\nof taxation would be a bad security for government Stock.\r\n\r\nAll matters of taxation, moreover, should be free from any taint\r\nof generosity. A man who should attempt to lessen the burdens of\r\nhis country by gifts of money to its Exchequer would be laying his\r\ncountry under an obligation, for which his country would not thank\r\nhim. The gifts here would be from States, and not from individuals;\r\nbut the principle would be the same. I cannot imagine that the United\r\nStates' Government would be willing to owe its revenue to the good\r\nwill of different States, or its want of revenue to their caprice. If\r\nunder such an arrangement the western States were to decline to vote\r\nthe quota of income-tax or property-tax to which the eastern States\r\nhad agreed,--and in all probability they would decline,--they would\r\nin fact be seceding. They would thus secede from the burdens of their\r\ngeneral country; but in such event no one could accuse such States of\r\nunconstitutional secession.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to ascertain with precision what is the present amount\r\nof debt due by the United States; nor probably has any tolerably\r\naccurate guess been yet given of the amount to which it may be\r\nextended during the present war. A statement made in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, by Mr. Spaulding, a member of the Committee of Ways\r\nand Means, on the 29th of January last, may perhaps be taken as\r\ngiving as trustworthy information as any that can be obtained. I have\r\nchanged Mr. Spaulding's figures from dollars into pounds, that they\r\nmay be more readily understood by English readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n   There was Due up to July 1,1861         £18,173,566\r\n       \"     Added in July and August        5,379,357\r\n       \"     Borrowed in August             10,000,000\r\n       \"     Borrowed in October            10,000,000\r\n       \"     Borrowed in November           10,000,000\r\n       \"     Amount of Treasury Demand\r\n               Notes issued                  7,800,000\r\n                                           -----------\r\n                                           £61,352,923\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the amount of the debt due up to January 15th, 1862. Mr.\r\nSpaulding then calculates that the sum required to carry on the\r\nGovernment up to July 1st, 1862, will be £68,647,077. And that a\r\nfurther sum of £110,000,000 will be wanted on or before the 1st\r\nof July, 1863. Thus the debt at that latter date would stand as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Amount of Debt up to January, 1862     £61,352,923\r\n   Added by July 1st, 1862                 68,647,077\r\n   Again added by July 1st, 1863          110,000,000\r\n                                         ------------\r\n                                         £240,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of these items may no doubt be taken as accurate. The\r\nsecond has probably been founded on facts which leave little doubt\r\nas to its substantial truth. The third, which professes to give the\r\nproposed expense of the war for the forthcoming year, viz. from 1st\r\nJuly, 1862, to 30th June, 1863, must necessarily have been obtained\r\nby a very loose estimate. No one can say what may be the condition of\r\nthe country during the next year,--whether the war may then be raging\r\nthroughout the southern States, or whether the war may not have\r\nceased altogether. The North knows little or nothing of the capacity\r\nof the South. How little it knows may be surmised from the fact that\r\nthe whole southern army of Virginia retreated from their position at\r\nManassas before the northern generals knew that they were moving; and\r\nthat when they were gone no word whatever was left of their numbers.\r\nI do not believe that the northern Government is even yet able to\r\nmake any probable conjecture as to the number of troops which the\r\nsouthern confederacy is maintaining, and if this be so, they can\r\ncertainly make no trustworthy estimates as to their own expenses for\r\nthe ensuing year.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and forty millions is, however, the sum named by a\r\ngentleman presumed to be conversant with the matter, as the amount\r\nof debt which may be expected by midsummer, 1863; and if the war\r\nbe continued till then, it will probably be found that he has not\r\nexceeded the mark. It is right, however, to state that Mr. Chase in\r\nhis estimate does not rate the figures so high. He has given it as\r\nhis opinion that the debt will be about one hundred and four millions\r\nin July, 1862, and one hundred and eighty millions in July, 1863. As\r\nto the first amount, with reference to which a tolerably accurate\r\ncalculation may probably be made, I am inclined to prefer the\r\nestimate as given by the member of the committee; and as to the\r\nother, which hardly, as I think, admits of any calculation, his\r\ncalculation is at any rate as good as that made in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nBut it is the immediate want of funds, and not the prospective debt\r\nof the country, which is now doing the damage. In this opinion Mr.\r\nChase will probably agree with me; but readers on this side of the\r\nwater will receive what I say with a smile. Such a state of affairs\r\nis certainly one that has not uncommonly been reached by financiers;\r\nit has also often been experienced by gentlemen in the management of\r\ntheir private affairs. It has been common in Ireland, and in London\r\nhas created the wealth of the pawnbrokers. In the States at the\r\npresent time the government is very much in this condition. The\r\nprospective wealth of the country is almost unbounded, but there is\r\ngreat difficulty in persuading any pawnbroker to advance money on the\r\npledge. In February last Mr. Chase was driven to obtain the sanction\r\nof the legislature for paying the national creditors by bills drawn\r\nat twelve months' date, and bearing 6 per cent. interest. It is the\r\nold story of the tailor who calls with his little account, and draws\r\non his insolvent debtor at ninety days. If the insolvent debtor be\r\nnot utterly gone as regards solvency he will take up the bill when\r\ndue, even though he may not be able to pay a simple debt. But then,\r\nif he be utterly insolvent, he can do neither the one nor the other!\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, when he asked for permission to\r\naccept these bills,--or to issue these certificates, as he calls\r\nthem,--acknowledged to pressing debts of over five millions sterling\r\nwhich he could not pay; and to further debts of eight millions\r\nwhich he could not pay, but which he termed floating;--debts, if\r\nI understand him, which were not as yet quite pressing. Now I\r\nimagine that to be a lamentable condition for any Chancellor of an\r\nExchequer,--especially as a confession is at the same time made\r\nthat no advantageous borrowing is to be done under the existing\r\ncircumstances. When a Chancellor of the Exchequer confesses that he\r\ncannot borrow on advantageous terms, the terms within his reach must\r\nbe very bad indeed. This position is indeed a sad one, and at any\r\nrate justifies me in stating that the immediate want of funds is\r\nseverely felt.\r\n\r\nBut the very arguments which have been used to prove that the country\r\nwill be ultimately crushed by the debt, are those which I should use\r\nto prove that it will not be crushed. A comparison has more than once\r\nbeen made between the manner in which our debt was made, and that in\r\nwhich the debt of the United States is now being created; and the\r\ngreat point raised in our favour is, that while we were borrowing\r\nmoney we were also taxing ourselves, and that we raised as much by\r\ntaxes as we did by loans. But it is too early in the day to deny to\r\nthe Americans the credit which we thus take to ourselves. We were a\r\ntax-paying nation when we commenced those wars which made our great\r\nloans necessary, and only went on in that practice which was habitual\r\nto us. I do not think that the Americans could have taxed themselves\r\nwith greater alacrity than they have shown. Let us wait, at any rate,\r\ntill they shall have had time for the operation, before we blame\r\nthem for not making it. It is then argued that we in England did not\r\nborrow nearly so fast as they have borrowed in the States. That is\r\ntrue. But it must be remembered that the dimensions and proportions\r\nof wars now are infinitely greater than they were when we began to\r\nborrow. Does any one imagine that we would not have borrowed faster,\r\nif by faster borrowing we could have closed the war more speedily?\r\nThings go faster now than they did then. Borrowing for the sake of a\r\nwar may be a bad thing to do,--as also it may be a good thing; but if\r\nit be done at all, it should be so done as to bring the war to the\r\nend with what greatest despatch may be possible.\r\n\r\nThe only fair comparison, as it seems to me, which can be drawn\r\nbetween the two countries with reference to their debts, and the\r\ncondition of each under its debt, should be made to depend on the\r\namount of the debt and probable ability of the country to bear that\r\nburden. The amount of the debt must be calculated by the interest\r\npayable on it, rather than by the figures representing the actual sum\r\ndue. If we debit the United States Government with seven per cent.\r\non all the money borrowed by them, and presume that amount to have\r\nreached in July, 1863, the sum named by Mr. Spaulding, they will then\r\nhave loaded themselves with an annual charge of £16,800,000 sterling.\r\nIt will have been an immense achievement to have accomplished in so\r\nshort a time, but it will by no means equal the annual sum with which\r\nwe are charged. And, moreover, the comparison will have been made in\r\na manner that is hardly fair to the Americans. We pay our creditors\r\nthree per cent. now that we have arranged our affairs, and have\r\nsettled down into the respectable position of an old gentleman whose\r\nestates, though deeply mortgaged, are not over-mortgaged. But we did\r\nnot get our money at three per cent. while our wars were on hand, and\r\nthere yet existed some doubt as to the manner in which they might be\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nThis attempt, however, at guessing what may be the probable amount of\r\nthe debt at the close of the war is absolutely futile. No one can as\r\nyet conjecture when the war may be over, or what collateral expenses\r\nmay attend its close. It may be the case that the government in\r\nfixing some boundary between the future United States and the future\r\nsouthern Confederacy, will be called on to advance a very large sum\r\nof money as compensation for slaves who shall have been liberated\r\nin the border States, or have been swept down south into the cotton\r\nregions with the retreating hordes of the southern army. The total\r\nof the bill cannot be reckoned up while the work is still unfinished.\r\nBut, after all, that question as to the amount of the bill is not\r\nto us the question of the greatest interest. Whether the debt\r\nshall amount to two, or three, or even to four hundred millions\r\nsterling,--whether it remain fixed at its present modest dimensions,\r\nor swell itself out to the magnificent proportions of our British\r\ndebt,--will the resources of the country enable it to bear such\r\na burden? Will it be found that the Americans share with us that\r\nelastic power of endurance which has enabled us to bear a weight that\r\nwould have ruined any other people of the same number? Have they the\r\nthews and muscles, the energy and endurance, the power of carrying\r\nwhich we possess? They have got our blood in their veins, and have\r\nthese qualities gone with the blood? It is of little avail either\r\nto us or to the truth that we can show some difference between our\r\nposition and their position which may seem to be in our favour. They,\r\ndoubtless, could show other points of difference on the other side.\r\nWith us, in the early years of this century, it was a contest for\r\nlife and death, in which we could not stop to count the cost,--in\r\nwhich we believed that we were fighting for all that we cared to call\r\nour own, and in which we were resolved that we would not be beaten,\r\nas long as we had a man to fight and a guinea to spend. Fighting in\r\nthis mind we won. Had we fought in any other mind, I think I may say\r\nthat we should not have won. To the Americans of the northern States\r\nthis also is a contest for life and death. I will not here stay to\r\nargue whether this need have been so. I think they are right; but\r\nthis at least must be accorded to them--that having gone into this\r\nmatter of civil war, it behoves them to finish it with credit to\r\nthemselves. There are many Englishmen who think that we were wrong to\r\nundertake the French war; but there is, I take it, no Englishman who\r\nthinks that we ought to have allowed ourselves to be beaten when we\r\nhad undertaken it. To the Americans it is now a contest of life and\r\ndeath. They also cannot stop to count the cost. They also will go on\r\nas long as they have a dollar to spend or a man to fight.\r\n\r\nIt appears that we were paying fourteen millions a year interest on\r\nour national debt in the year 1796. I take this statement from an\r\narticle in \"The Times,\" in which the question of the finances of the\r\nUnited States is handled. But our population in 1796 was only sixteen\r\nmillions. I estimate the population of the northern section of the\r\nUnited States, as the States will be after the war, at twenty-two\r\nmillions. In the article alluded to these northern Americans are now\r\nstated to be twenty millions. If then we, in 1796, could pay fourteen\r\nmillions a year with a population of sixteen millions, the United\r\nStates, with a population of twenty or twenty-two millions, will be\r\nable to pay the sixteen or seventeen millions sterling of interest\r\nwhich will become due from them,--if their circumstances of payment\r\nare as good as were ours. They can do that and more than that if\r\nthey have the same means per man as we had. And as the means per man\r\nresolves itself at last into the labour per man, it may be said that\r\nthey can pay what we could pay, if they can and will work as hard as\r\nwe could and did work. That which did not crush us will not crush\r\nthem, if their future energy be equal to our past energy.\r\n\r\nAnd on this question of energy I think that there is no need for\r\ndoubt. Taking man for man and million for million, the Americans are\r\nequal to the English in intellect and industry. They create wealth at\r\nany rate as fast as we have done. They develop their resources, and\r\nopen out the currents of trade, with an energy equal to our own. They\r\nare always at work, improving, utilizing, and creating. Austria, as I\r\ntake it, is succumbing to monetary difficulties, not because she has\r\nbeen extravagant, but because she has been slow at progress;--because\r\nit has been the work of her rulers to repress rather than encourage\r\nthe energies of her people; because she does not improve, utilize,\r\nand create. England has mastered her monetary difficulties because\r\nthe genius of her government and her people has been exactly opposite\r\nto the genius of Austria. And the States of America will master\r\ntheir money difficulties, because they are born of England, and are\r\nnot born of Austria. What! Shall our eldest child become bankrupt\r\nin its first trade difficulty; be utterly ruined by its first\r\nlittle commercial embarrassment? The child bears much too strong a\r\nresemblance to its parent for me to think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE POST-OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny Englishman or Frenchman residing in the American States\r\ncannot fail to be struck with the inferiority of the Post-office\r\narrangements in that country to those by which they are accommodated\r\nin their own country. I have not been a resident in the States, and\r\nas a traveller might probably have passed the subject without special\r\nremark, were it not that the service of the Post-office has been my\r\nown profession for many years. I could therefore hardly fail to\r\nobserve things which to another man would have been of no material\r\nmoment. At first I was inclined to lean heavily in my judgment upon\r\nthe deficiencies of a department which must be of primary importance\r\nto a commercial nation. It seemed that among a people so intelligent,\r\nand so quick in all enterprises of trade, a well arranged Post-office\r\nwould have been held to be absolutely necessary, and that all\r\ndifficulties would have been made to succumb in their efforts to\r\nput that establishment, if no other, upon a proper footing. But\r\nas I looked into the matter, and in becoming acquainted with\r\nthe circumstances of the Post-office learned the extent of the\r\ndifficulties absolutely existing, I began to think that a very great\r\ndeal had been done, and that the fault, as to that which had been\r\nleft undone, rested, not with the Post-office officials, but was\r\nattributable partly to political causes altogether outside the\r\nPost-office, and partly,--perhaps chiefly,--to the nature of the\r\ncountry itself.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, undoubtedly true that the amount of accommodation\r\ngiven by the Post-office of the States is small,--as compared with\r\nthat afforded in some other countries, and that that accommodation\r\nis lessened by delays and uncertainty. The point which first struck\r\nme was the inconvenient hours at which mails were brought in and\r\ndespatched. Here, in England, it is the object of our Post-office to\r\ncarry the bulk of our letters at night; to deliver them as early as\r\npossible in the morning, and to collect them and take them away for\r\ndespatch as late as may be in the day;--so that the merchant may\r\nreceive his letters before the beginning of his day's business, and\r\ndespatch them after its close. The bulk of our letters is handled in\r\nthis manner, and the advantage of such an arrangement is manifest.\r\nBut it seemed that in the States no such practice prevailed. Letters\r\narrived at any hour in the day miscellaneously, and were despatched\r\nat any hour, and I found that the postmaster at one town could never\r\ntell me with certainty when letters would arrive at another. If the\r\ntowns were distant, I would be told that the conveyance might take\r\nabout two or three days; if they were near, that my letter would get\r\nto hand \"some time to-morrow.\" I ascertained, moreover, by painful\r\nexperience that the whole of a mail would not always go forward by\r\nthe first despatch. As regarded myself this had reference chiefly to\r\nEnglish letters and newspapers.--\"Only a part of the mail has come,\"\r\nthe clerk would tell me. With us the owners of that part which did\r\nnot \"come,\" would consider themselves greatly aggrieved and make\r\nloud complaint. But, in the States, complaints made against official\r\ndepartments are held to be of little moment.\r\n\r\nLetters also in the States are subject to great delays by\r\nirregularities on railways. One train does not hit the town of its\r\ndestination before another train, to which it is nominally fitted,\r\nhas been started on its journey. The mail trains are not bound to\r\nwait; and thus, in the large cities, far distant from New York,\r\ngreat irregularity prevails. It is, I think, owing to this,--at any\r\nrate partly to this,--that the system of telegraphing has become so\r\nprevalent. It is natural that this should be so between towns which\r\nare in the due course of post perhaps forty-eight hours asunder; but\r\nthe uncertainty of the post increases the habit, to the profit, of\r\ncourse, of the companies which own the wires,--but to the manifest\r\nloss of the Post-office.\r\n\r\nBut the deficiency which struck me most forcibly in the American\r\nPost-office, was the absence of any recognized official delivery of\r\nletters. The United States Post-office does not assume to itself\r\nthe duty of taking letters to the houses of those for whom they are\r\nintended, but holds itself as having completed the work for which\r\nthe original postage has been paid, when it has brought them to the\r\nwindow of the Post-office of the town to which they are addressed.\r\nIt is true that in most large towns,--though by no means in all,--a\r\nseparate arrangement is made by which a delivery is afforded to those\r\nwho are willing to pay a further sum for that further service; but\r\nthe recognized official mode of delivery is from the office window.\r\nThe merchants and persons in trade have boxes at the windows, for\r\nwhich they pay. Other old-established inhabitants in towns, and\r\npersons in receipt of a considerable correspondence, receive their\r\nletters by the subsidiary carriers and pay for them separately. But\r\nthe poorer classes of the community, those persons among which it\r\nis of such paramount importance to increase the blessing of letter\r\nwriting, obtain their letters from the Post-office windows.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases the practice acts to the prejudice of the\r\ndepartment. In order to escape the tax on delivery, which varies\r\nfrom two cents to one cent a letter, all men in trade, and many who\r\nare not in trade, hold office boxes; consequently immense space is\r\nrequired. The space given at Chicago, both to the public without and\r\nto the officials within, for such delivery, is more than four times\r\nthat required at Liverpool for the same purpose. But Liverpool is\r\nthree times the size of Chicago. The corps of clerks required for the\r\nwindow delivery is very great, and the whole affair is cumbrous in\r\nthe extreme. The letters at most offices are given out through little\r\nwindows, to which the inquirer is obliged to stoop. There he finds\r\nhimself opposite to a pane of glass with a little hole; and when the\r\nclerk within shakes his head at him, he rarely believes but what his\r\nletters are there if he could only reach them. But in the second\r\ncase, the tax on the delivery, which is intended simply to pay the\r\nwages of the men who take them out, is paid with a bad grace; it robs\r\nthe letter of its charm, and forces it to present itself in the\r\nguise of a burden. It makes that disagreeable which for its own sake\r\nthe Post-office should strive in every way to make agreeable. This\r\npractice, moreover, operates as a direct prevention to a class of\r\ncorrespondence, which furnishes in England a large proportion of the\r\nrevenue of the Post-office. Mercantile houses in our large cities\r\nsend out thousands of trade circulars, paying postage on them; but\r\nsuch circulars would not be received, either in England or elsewhere,\r\nif a demand for postage were made on their delivery. Who does not\r\nreceive these circulars in our country by the dozen, consigning them\r\ngenerally to the waste-paper basket, after a most cursory inspection?\r\nAs regards the sender, the transaction seems to us often to be very\r\nvain; but the Post-office gets its penny. So also would the American\r\nPost-office get its three cents.\r\n\r\nBut the main objection in my eyes to the American Post-office system\r\nis this,--that it is not brought nearer to the poorer classes.\r\nEverybody writes or can write in America, and therefore the\r\ncorrespondence of their millions should be, million for million, at\r\nany rate equal to ours. But it is not so: and this, I think, comes\r\nfrom the fact that communication by Post-office is not made easy to\r\nthe people generally. Such communication is not found to be easy by\r\na man who has to attend at a Post-office window on the chance of\r\nreceiving a letter. When no arrangement more comfortable than that\r\nis provided, the Post-office will be used for the necessities of\r\nletter-writing, but will not be esteemed as a luxury. And thus not\r\nonly do the people lose a comfort which they might enjoy, but the\r\nPost-office also loses that revenue which it might make.\r\n\r\nI have said that the correspondence circulating in the United States\r\nis less than that of the United Kingdom. In making any comparison\r\nbetween them I am obliged to arrive at facts, or rather at the\r\nprobabilities of facts, in a somewhat circuitous mode, as the\r\nAmericans have kept no account of the number of letters which pass\r\nthrough their post-offices in a year. We can, however, make an\r\nestimate which, if incorrect, shall not at any rate be incorrect\r\nagainst them. The gross postal revenue of the United States, for the\r\nyear ended 30th June, 1861, was in round figures £1,700,000. This was\r\nthe amount actually earned, exclusive of a sum of £140,000 paid to\r\nthe Post-office by the government for the carriage of what is called\r\nin that country free mail matter; otherwise, books, letters, and\r\nparcels franked by members of Congress. The gross postal revenue\r\nof the United Kingdom was in the last year, in round figures,\r\n£3,358,000, exclusive of a sum of £179,000 claimed as earned for\r\ncarrying official postage, and also exclusive of £127,866, that\r\nbeing the amount of money order commission which in this country is\r\nconsidered a part of the Post-office revenue. In the United States\r\nthere is at present no money order office. In the United Kingdom\r\nthe sum of £3,358,000 was earned by the conveyance and delivery of\r\n\r\n\r\n   593 millions of letters,\r\n    73 millions of newspapers,\r\n    12 millions of books.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat number of each was conveyed through the post in the United\r\nStates we have no means of knowing; but presuming the average rate\r\nof postage on each letter in the States to be the same as it is in\r\nEngland, and presuming also that letters, newspapers, and books\r\ncirculated in the same proportion there as they do with us, the sum\r\nabove named of £1,700,000 will have been earned by carrying about 300\r\nmillions of letters. But the average rate of postage in the States\r\nis, in fact, higher than it is in England. The ordinary single rate\r\nof postage there is three cents or three half-pence, whereas with us\r\nit is a penny; and if three half-pence might be taken as the average\r\nrate in the United States, the number of letters would be reduced\r\nfrom 300 to 200 millions a year. There is however a class of letters\r\nwhich in the States are passed through the Post-office at the rate of\r\none halfpenny a letter, whereas there is no rate of postage with us\r\nless than a penny. Taking these halfpenny letters into consideration,\r\nI am disposed to regard the average rate of American postage at\r\nabout five farthings, which would give the number of letters at 250\r\nmillions. We shall at any rate be safe in saying that the number is\r\nconsiderably less than 300 millions, and that it does not amount to\r\nhalf the number circulated with us. But the difference between our\r\npopulation and their population is not great. The population of the\r\nStates during the year in question was about 27 millions, exclusive\r\nof slaves, and that of the British isles was about 29 millions. No\r\ndoubt, in the year named, the correspondence of the States had been\r\nsomewhat disturbed by the rebellion; but that disturbance, up to\r\nthe end of June, 1861, had been very trifling. The division of\r\nthe southern from the northern States, as far as the Post-office\r\nwas concerned, did not take place till the end of May, 1861; and\r\ntherefore but one month in the year was affected by the actual\r\nsecession of the South. The gross postal revenue of the States which\r\nhave seceded was, for the year prior to secession, twelve hundred\r\nthousand five hundred dollars, and for that one month of June\r\nit would therefore have been a little over one hundred thousand\r\ndollars, or £20,000. That sum may therefore be presumed to have\r\nbeen abstracted by secession from the gross annual revenue of the\r\nPost-office. Trade, also, was no doubt injured by the disturbance\r\nin the country, and the circulation of letters was, as a matter\r\nof course, to some degree affected by this injury; but it seems\r\nthat the gross revenue of 1861 was less than that of 1860 by only\r\none thirty-sixth. I think, therefore, that we may say, making all\r\nallowance that can be fairly made, that the number of letters\r\ncirculating in the United Kingdom is more than double that which\r\ncirculates, or ever has circulated, in the United States.\r\n\r\nThat this is so, I attribute not to any difference in the people\r\nof the two countries,--not to an aptitude for letter writing\r\namong us which is wanting with the Americans,--but to the greater\r\nconvenience and wider accommodation of our own Post-office. As I\r\nhave before stated, and will presently endeavour to show, this wider\r\naccommodation is not altogether the result of better management on\r\nour part. Our circumstances as regards the Post-office have had in\r\nthem less of difficulties than theirs. But it has arisen in great\r\npart from better management; and in nothing is their deficiency so\r\nconspicuous as in the absence of a free delivery for their letters.\r\n\r\nIn order that the advantages of the Post-office should reach all\r\npersons, the delivery of letters should extend not only to towns,\r\nbut to the country also. In France all letters are delivered free.\r\nHowever remote may be the position of a house or cottage, it is not\r\ntoo remote for the postman. With us all letters are not delivered;\r\nbut the exceptions refer to distant solitary houses and to localities\r\nwhich are almost without correspondence. But in the United States\r\nthere is no free delivery, and there is no delivery at all except in\r\nthe large cities. In small towns, in villages, even in the suburbs\r\nof the largest cities, no such accommodation is given. Whatever may\r\nbe the distance, people expecting letters must send for them to the\r\nPost-office;--and they who do not expect them, leave their letters\r\nuncalled for. Brother Jonathan goes out to fish in these especial\r\nwaters with a very large net. The little fish, which are profitable,\r\nslip through; but the big fish, which are by no means profitable, are\r\ncaught,--often at an expense greater than their value.\r\n\r\nThere are other smaller sins upon which I could put my finger,--and\r\nwould do so were I writing an official report upon the subject of\r\nthe American Post-office. In lieu of doing so, I will endeavour\r\nto explain how much the States' office has done in this matter of\r\naffording Post-office accommodation,--and how great have been the\r\ndifficulties in the way of Post-office reformers in that country.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, when we compare ourselves to them, we must\r\nremember that we live in a tea-cup, and they in a washing-tub. As\r\ncompared with them we inhabit towns which are close to each other.\r\nOur distances, as compared with theirs, are nothing. From London to\r\nLiverpool the line of railway traverses about two hundred miles, but\r\nthe mail train which conveys the bags for Liverpool, carries the\r\ncorrespondence of probably four or five millions of persons. The\r\nmail train from New York to Buffalo passes over about four hundred\r\nmiles, and on its route serves not one million. A comparison of this\r\nkind might be made with the same effect between any of our great\r\ninternal mail routes and any of theirs. Consequently, the expense of\r\nconveyance to them is, per letter, very much greater than with us,\r\nand the American Post-office is as a matter of necessity driven to\r\nan economy in the use of railways for the Post-office service, which\r\nwe are not called on to practise. From New York to Chicago is nearly\r\n1000 miles. From New York to St. Louis is over 1600. I need not say\r\nthat in England we know nothing of such distances, and that therefore\r\nour task has been comparatively easy. Nevertheless the States have\r\nfollowed in our track, and have taken advantage of Sir Rowland Hill's\r\nwise audacity in the reduction of postage with greater quickness than\r\nany other nation but our own. Through all the States letters pass for\r\nthree cents over a distance less than 3000 miles. For distances above\r\n3000 miles the rate is ten cents or five-pence. This increased rate\r\nhas special reference to the mails for California, which are carried\r\ndaily across the whole continent at a cost to the States Government\r\nof two hundred thousand pounds a year.\r\n\r\nWith us the chief mail trains are legally under the management of the\r\nPostmaster-General. He fixes the hours at which they shall start and\r\narrive, being of course bound by certain stipulations as to pace. He\r\ncan demand trains to run over any line at any hour, and can in this\r\nway secure the punctuality of mail transportation. Of course such\r\ninterference on the part of a government official in the working of\r\na railway is attended with a very heavy expense to the Government.\r\nThough the British Post-office can demand the use of trains at any\r\nhour, and as regards those trains can make the despatch of mails\r\nparamount to all other matters, the British Post-office cannot\r\nfix the price to be paid for such work. This is generally done by\r\narbitration, and of course for such services the payment is very\r\nhigh. No such practice prevails in the States. The Government has no\r\npower of using the mail lines as they are used by our Post-office,\r\nnor could the expense of such a practice be borne or nearly borne by\r\nthe proceeds of letters in the States. Consequently the Post-office\r\nis put on a par with ordinary customers, and such trains are used\r\nfor mail matter as the directors of each line may see fit to use for\r\nother matter. Hence it occurs that no offence against the Post-office\r\nis committed when the connection between different mail trains\r\nis broken. The Post-office takes the best it can get, paying as\r\nother customers pay, and grumbling as other customers grumble when\r\nthe service rendered falls short of that which has been promised.\r\n\r\nIt may, I think, easily be seen that any system such as ours,\r\ncarried across so large a country, would go on increasing in cost\r\nat an enormous ratio. The greater the distance, the greater is the\r\ndifficulty in securing the proper fitting of fast-running trains.\r\nAnd moreover, it must be remembered that the American lines have\r\nbeen got up on a very different footing from ours, at an expense per\r\nmile of probably less than a fifth of that laid out on our railways.\r\nSingle lines of rail are common, even between great towns with large\r\ntraffic. At the present moment--May, 1862--the only railway running\r\ninto Washington, that namely from Baltimore, is a single line over\r\nthe greater distance. The whole thing is necessarily worked at a\r\ncheaper rate than with us; not because the people are poorer, but\r\nbecause the distances are greater. As this is the case throughout\r\nthe whole railway system of the country, it cannot be expected that\r\nsuch despatch and punctuality should be achieved in America as are\r\nachieved here, in England, or in France. As population and wealth\r\nincrease, it will come. In the mean time that which has been already\r\ndone over the extent of the vast North American continent is\r\nvery wonderful. I think, therefore, that complaint should not\r\nbe made against the Washington Post-office, either on account\r\nof the inconvenience of the hours, or on the head of occasional\r\nirregularity. So much has been done in reducing the rate to three\r\ncents, and in giving a daily mail throughout the States, that the\r\ndepartment should be praised for energy, and not blamed for apathy.\r\n\r\nIn the year ended 30th June, 1861, the gross revenue of the\r\nPost-office of the States was, as I have stated, £1,700,000. In\r\nthe same year its expenditure was in round figures £2,720,000.\r\nConsequently there was an actual loss, to be made up out of general\r\ntaxation, amounting to £1,020,000. In the accounts of the American\r\nofficers this is lessened by £140,000, that sum having been\r\narbitrarily fixed by the Government as the amount earned by the\r\nPost-office in carrying free mail matter. We have a similar system in\r\ncomputing the value of the service rendered by our Post-office to the\r\nGovernment in carrying government despatches; but with us the amount\r\nnamed as the compensation depends on the actual weight carried. If\r\nthe matter so carried be carried solely on the Government service,\r\nas is I believe the case with us, any such claim on behalf of the\r\nPost-office is apparently unnecessary. The Crown works for the Crown,\r\nas the right hand works for the left. The Post-office pays no rates\r\nor taxes, contributes nothing to the poor, runs its mails on turnpike\r\nroads free of toll, and gives receipts on unstamped paper. With us\r\nno payment is in truth made, though the Post-office in its accounts\r\npresumes itself to have received the money. But in the States the\r\nsum named is handed over by the State Treasury to the Post-office\r\nTreasury. Any such statement of credit does not in effect alter the\r\nreal fact, that over a million sterling is required as a subsidy by\r\nthe American Post-office, in order that it may be enabled to pay its\r\nway. In estimating the expenditure of the office the department at\r\nWashington debits itself with the sums paid for the ocean transit of\r\nits mails, amounting to something over £150,000. We also now do the\r\nsame, with the much greater sum paid by us for such service, which\r\nnow amounts to £949,228, or nearly a million sterling. Till lately\r\nthis was not paid out of the Post-office moneys, and the Post-office\r\nrevenue was not debited with the amount.\r\n\r\nOur gross Post-office revenue is, as I have said, £3,358,250. As\r\nbefore explained, this is exclusive of the amount earned by the\r\nmoney order department, which, though managed by the authorities of\r\nthe Post-office, cannot be called a part of the Post-office; and\r\nexclusive also of the official postage, which is, in fact, never\r\nreceived. The expenditure of our British Post-office, inclusive of\r\nthe sum paid for the ocean mail service, is £3,064,527. We therefore\r\nmake a net profit of £293,723 out of the Post-office, as compared\r\nwith a loss of £1,020,000, on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest difficulty with which the American\r\nPost-office is burdened, is that \"free mail matter\" to which I have\r\nalluded, for carrying which, the Post-office claims to earn £140,000,\r\nand for the carriage of which, it might as fairly claim to earn\r\n£1,350,000, or half the amount of its total expenditure, for I was\r\ninformed by a gentleman whose knowledge on the subject could not be\r\ndoubted, that the free mail matter so carried, equalled in bulk and\r\nweight all that other matter which was not carried free. To such an\r\nextent has the privilege of franking been carried in the States! All\r\nmembers of both Houses frank what they please,--for in effect the\r\nprivilege is stretched to that extent. All Presidents of the Union,\r\npast and present, can frank, as, also, all Vice-Presidents, past and\r\npresent; and there is a special act, enabling the widow of President\r\nPolk to frank! Why it is that widows of other Presidents do not\r\nagitate on the matter, I cannot understand. And all the Secretaries\r\nof State can frank; and ever so many other public officers. There is\r\nno limit in number to the letters so franked, and the nuisance has\r\nextended itself to so huge a size, that members of Congress in giving\r\nfranks, cannot write the franks themselves. It is illegal for them\r\nto depute to others the privilege of signing their names for this\r\npurpose, but it is known at the Post-office that it is done. But even\r\nthis is not the worst of it. Members of the House of Representatives\r\nhave the power of sending through the post all those huge books\r\nwhich, with them as with us, grow out of Parliamentary debates and\r\nworkings of Committees. This, under certain stipulations, is the\r\ncase also in England; but in England, luckily, no one values them.\r\nIn America, however, it is not so. A voter considers himself to be\r\nnoticed if he gets a book. He likes to have the book bound, and the\r\nbigger the book may be, the more the compliment is relished. Hence it\r\ncomes to pass that an enormous quantity of useless matter is printed\r\nand bound, only that it may be sent down to constituents and make a\r\nshow on the parlour shelves of constituents' wives. The Post-office\r\ngroans and becomes insolvent, and the country pays for the paper, the\r\nprinting, and the binding. While the public expenses of the nation\r\nwere very small, there was, perhaps, no reason why voters should not\r\nthus be indulged; but now the matter is different, and it would be\r\nwell that the conveyance by post of these Congressional libraries\r\nshould be brought to an end. I was also assured that members very\r\nfrequently obtain permission for the printing of a speech which has\r\nnever been delivered,--and which never will be delivered,--in order\r\nthat copies may be circulated among their constituents. There is in\r\nsuch an arrangement an ingenuity which is peculiarly American in its\r\nnature. Everybody concerned is no doubt cheated by the system. The\r\nconstituents are cheated; the public, which pays, is cheated; and the\r\nPost-office is cheated. But the House is spared the hearing of the\r\nspeech, and the result on the whole is perhaps beneficial.\r\n\r\nWe also, within the memory of many of us, had a franking privilege,\r\nwhich was peculiarly objectionable inasmuch as it operated towards\r\ngiving a free transmission of their letters by post to the rich,\r\nwhile no such privilege was within reach of the poor. But with us it\r\nnever stretched itself to such an extent as it has now achieved in\r\nthe States. The number of letters for members was limited. The whole\r\naddress was written by the franking member himself, and not much\r\nwas sent in this way that was bulky. I am disposed to think that\r\nall government and Congressional jobs in the States bear the same\r\nproportion to government and Parliamentary jobs which have been\r\nin vogue among us. There has been an unblushing audacity in the\r\npublic dishonesty,--what I may perhaps call the State dishonesty,--at\r\nWashington, which I think was hardly ever equalled in London.\r\nBribery, I know, was disgracefully current in the days of Walpole, of\r\nNewcastle, and even of Castlereagh;--so current, that no Englishman\r\nhas a right to hold up his own past government as a model of purity.\r\nBut the corruption with us did blush and endeavour to hide itself.\r\nIt was disgraceful to be bribed, if not so to offer bribes. But at\r\nWashington corruption has been so common that I can hardly understand\r\nhow any honest man can have held up his head in the vicinity of the\r\nCapitol, or of the State office.\r\n\r\nBut the country has, I think, become tired of this. Hitherto it\r\nhas been too busy about its more important concerns, in extending\r\ncommerce, in making railways, in providing education for its youth,\r\nto think very much of what was being done at Washington. While the\r\ntaxes were light and property was secure, while increasing population\r\ngave daily increasing strength to the nation, the people as a body\r\nwere content with that theory of being governed by their little men.\r\nThey gave a bad name to politicians, and allowed politics, as they\r\nsay, \"to slide.\" But all this will be altered now. The tremendous\r\nexpenditure of the last twelve months has allowed dishonesty of so\r\nvast a grasp to make its ravages in the public pockets, that the evil\r\nwill work its own cure. Taxes will be very high, and the people will\r\nrecognize the necessity of having honest men to look after them. The\r\nnation can no longer afford to be indifferent about its Government,\r\nand will require to know where its money goes, and why it goes. This\r\nfranking privilege is already doomed, if not already dead. When I was\r\nin Washington a Bill was passed through the Lower House by which it\r\nwould be abolished altogether. When I left America its fate in the\r\nSenate was still doubtful, and I was told by many that that Bill\r\nwould not be allowed to become law without sundry alterations. But,\r\nnevertheless, I regard the franking privilege as doomed, and offer to\r\nthe Washington Post-office officials my best congratulations on their\r\ncoming deliverance.\r\n\r\nThe Post-office in the States is also burdened by another terrible\r\npolitical evil, which in itself is so heavy, that one would at first\r\nsight declare it to be enough to prevent anything like efficiency.\r\nThe whole of its staff is removeable every fourth year,--that is\r\nto say, on the election of every new President. And a very large\r\nproportion of its staff is thus removed periodically to make way\r\nfor those for whom a new President is bound to provide, by reason\r\nof their services in sending him to the White House. They have\r\nserved him and he thus repays them by this use of his patronage in\r\ntheir favour. At four hundred and thirty-four Post-offices in the\r\nStates,--those being the offices to which the highest salaries are\r\nattached,--the President has this power, and exercises it as a\r\nmatter of course. He has the same power with reference, I believe,\r\nto all the appointments held in the Post-office at Washington.\r\nThis practice applies by no means to the Post-office only. All the\r\ngovernment clerks,--clerks employed by the central government at\r\nWashington,--are subject to the same rule. And the rule has also been\r\nadopted in the various States with reference to State offices.\r\n\r\nTo a stranger this practice seems so manifestly absurd, that he can\r\nhardly conceive it possible that a government service should be\r\nconducted on such terms. He cannot, in the first place, believe that\r\nmen of sufficient standing before the world could be found to accept\r\noffice under such circumstances; and is led to surmise that men of\r\ninsufficient standing must be employed, and that there are other\r\nallurements to the office beyond the very moderate salaries which\r\nare allowed. He cannot, moreover, understand how the duties can\r\nbe conducted, seeing that men must be called on to resign their\r\nplaces as soon as they have learned to make themselves useful. And,\r\nfinally, he is lost in amazement as he contemplates this barefaced\r\nprostitution of the public employ to the vilest purposes of political\r\nmanoeuvring. With us also patronage has been used for political\r\npurposes, and to some small extent is still so used. We have not yet\r\nsufficiently recognized the fact, that in selecting a public servant\r\nnothing should be regarded but the advantage of the service in which\r\nhe is to be employed. But we never, in the lowest times of our\r\npolitical corruption, ventured to throw over the question of service\r\naltogether, and to declare publicly, that the one and only result to\r\nbe obtained by Government employment was political support. In the\r\nStates political corruption has become so much a matter of course,\r\nthat no American seems to be struck with the fact that the whole\r\nsystem is a system of robbery.\r\n\r\nFrom sheer necessity some of the old hands are kept on when these\r\nchanges are made. Were this not done the work would come absolutely\r\nto a dead lock. But it may be imagined how difficult it must be for\r\nmen to carry through any improvements in a great department, when\r\nthey have entered an office under such a system, and are liable to\r\nbe expelled under the same. It is greatly to the praise of those who\r\nhave been allowed to grow old in the service that so much has been\r\ndone. No men, however, are more apt at such work than Americans,\r\nor more able to exert themselves at their posts. They are not\r\nidle. Independently of any question of remuneration, they are not\r\nindifferent to the well-being of the work they have in hand. They are\r\ngood public servants, unless corruption come in their way.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking on the subject of patronage, I cannot but allude\r\nto two appointments which had been made by political interest,\r\nand with the circumstances of which I became acquainted. In both\r\ninstances a good place had been given to a gentleman by the incoming\r\nPresident,--not in return for political support, but from motives of\r\nprivate friendship,--either his own friendship or that of some mutual\r\nfriend. In both instances I heard the selection spoken of with the\r\nwarmest praise, as though a noble act had been done in the nomination\r\nof a private friend instead of a political partisan. And yet in each\r\ncase a man was appointed who knew nothing of his work; who, from\r\nage and circumstances, was not likely to become acquainted with\r\nhis work; who, by his appointment, kept out of the place those who\r\ndid understand the work, and had earned a right to promotion by\r\nso understanding it. Two worthy gentlemen,--for they were both\r\nworthy,--were pensioned on the government for a term of years under\r\na false pretence. That this should have been done is not perhaps\r\nremarkable; but it did seem remarkable to me that everybody regarded\r\nsuch appointments as a good deed--as a deed so exceptionably good as\r\nto be worthy of great praise. I do not allude to these selections on\r\naccount of the political vice shown by the Presidents in making them,\r\nbut on account of the political virtue;--in order that the nature\r\nof political virtue in the States may be understood. It had never\r\noccurred to any one to whom I spoke on the subject, that a President\r\nin bestowing such places was bound to look for efficient work in\r\nreturn for the public money which was to be paid.\r\n\r\nBefore I end this chapter I must insert a few details respecting the\r\nPost-office of the States, which, though they may not be specially\r\ninteresting to the general reader, will give some idea of the extent\r\nof the department. The total number of post-offices in the States on\r\n30th June, 1861, was 28,586. With us the number in England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland, at the same period was about 11,400. The population\r\nserved may be regarded as nearly the same. Our lowest salary is £3\r\nper annum. In the States the remuneration is often much lower. It\r\nconsists of a commission on the letters, and is sometimes less than\r\nten shillings a year. The difficulty of obtaining persons to hold\r\nthese offices, and the amount of work which must thereby be thrown on\r\nwhat is called the \"appointment branch,\" may be judged by the fact\r\nthat 9235 of these offices were filled up by new nominations during\r\nthe last year. When the patronage is of such a nature it is difficult\r\nto say which give most trouble, the places which nobody wishes to\r\nhave, or those which everybody wishes to have.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of postage on European letters, _i.e._, letters\r\npassing between the States and Europe, in the last year as to which\r\naccounts were kept between Washington and the European post-offices,\r\nwas £275,000. Of this over £150,000 was on letters for the United\r\nKingdom; and £130,000 was on letters carried by the Cunard packets.\r\n\r\nAccording to the accounts kept by the Washington office, the letters\r\npassing from the States to Europe and from Europe to the States are\r\nvery nearly equal in number, about 101 going to Europe for every 100\r\nreceived from Europe. But the number of newspapers sent from the\r\nStates is more than double the number received in the States from\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOn 30th June, 1861, mails were carried through the then loyal States\r\nof the Union over 140,400 miles daily. Up to 31st May preceding, at\r\nwhich time the Government mails were running all through the United\r\nStates, 96,000 miles were covered in those States which had then\r\nvirtually seceded, and which in the following month were taken out\r\nfrom the Post-office accounts,--making a total of 236,400 miles\r\ndaily. Of this mileage something less than one third is effected by\r\nrailways, at an average cost of about sixpence a mile. Our total\r\nmileage per day is 151,000 miles, of which 43,823 are done by\r\nrailway, at a cost of about sevenpence-halfpenny per mile.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could learn the servants of the Post-office are less\r\nliberally paid in the States than with us,--excepting as regards two\r\nclasses. The first of these is that class which is paid by weekly\r\nwages,--such as letter-carriers and porters. Their remuneration is\r\nof course ruled by the rate of ordinary wages in the country; and\r\nas ordinary wages are higher in the States than with us, such men\r\nare paid accordingly. The other class is that of postmasters at\r\nsecond-rate towns. They receive the same compensation as those at the\r\nlargest towns;--unless indeed there be other compensation than those\r\nwritten in the books at Washington. A postmaster is paid a certain\r\ncommission on letters, till it amounts to £400 per annum: all above\r\nthat going back to the Government. So also out of the fees paid for\r\nboxes at the window he receives any amount forthcoming, not exceeding\r\n£400 a year; making in all a maximum of £800. The postmaster of New\r\nYork can get no more. But any moderately large town will give as\r\nmuch, and in this way an amount of patronage is provided which in a\r\npolitical view is really valuable.\r\n\r\nBut with all this the people have made their way, because they have\r\nbeen intelligent, industrious, and in earnest. And as the people have\r\nmade their way, so has the Post-office. The number of its offices,\r\nthe mileage it covers, its extraordinary cheapness, the rapidity with\r\nwhich it has been developed, are all proofs of great things done;\r\nand it is by no means standing still even in these evil days of war.\r\nImprovements are even now on foot, copied in a great measure from\r\nourselves. Hitherto the American office has not taken upon itself\r\nthe task of returning to their writers undelivered and undeliverable\r\nletters. This it is now going to do. It is, as I have said, shaking\r\noff from itself that terrible incubus the franking privilege. And\r\nthe expediency of introducing a money-order office into the States,\r\nconnected with the Post-office as it is with us, is even now under\r\nconsideration. Such an accommodation is much needed in the country;\r\nbut I doubt whether the present moment, looking at the fiscal state\r\nof the country, is well adapted for establishing it.\r\n\r\nI was much struck by the great extravagance in small things\r\nmanifested by the Post-office through the States, and have reason\r\nto believe that the same remark would be equally true with regard\r\nto other public establishments. They use needless forms without\r\nend,--making millions of entries which no one is ever expected to\r\nregard. Their expenditure in stationery might, I think, be reduced\r\nby one half, and the labour might be saved which is now wasted in\r\nthe abuse of that useless stationery. Their mail-bags are made\r\nin a costly manner, and are often large beyond all proportion or\r\nnecessity. I could greatly lengthen this list if I were addressing\r\nmyself solely to Post-office people; but as I am not doing so, I will\r\nclose these semi-official remarks with an assurance to my colleagues\r\nin Post-office work on the other side of the water that I greatly\r\nrespect what they have done, and trust that before long they may have\r\nrenewed opportunities for the prosecution of their good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HOTELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it impossible to resist the subject of inns. As I have gone on\r\nwith my journey, I have gone on with my book, and have spoken here\r\nand there of American hotels as I have encountered them. But in the\r\nStates the hotels are so large an institution, having so much closer\r\nand wider a bearing on social life than they do in any other country,\r\nthat I feel myself bound to treat them in a separate chapter as a\r\ngreat national feature in themselves. They are quite as much thought\r\nof in the nation as the legislature, or judicature, or literature of\r\nthe country; and any falling off in them, or any improvement in the\r\naccommodation given, would strike the community as forcibly as a\r\nchange in the constitution, or an alteration in the franchise.\r\n\r\nMoreover I consider myself as qualified to write a chapter on\r\nhotels;--not only on the hotels of America but on hotels generally.\r\nI have myself been much too frequently a sojourner at hotels. I think\r\nI know what an hotel should be, and what it should not be; and am\r\nalmost inclined to believe, in my pride, that I could myself fill the\r\nposition of a landlord with some chance of social success, though\r\nprobably with none of satisfactory pecuniary results.\r\n\r\nOf all hotels known to me, I am inclined to think that the Swiss\r\nare the best. The things wanted at an hotel are, I fancy, mainly\r\nas follows:--a clean bedroom with a good and clean bed,--and with\r\nit also plenty of water. Good food, well dressed and served at\r\nconvenient hours, which hours should on occasions be allowed to\r\nstretch themselves. Wines that shall be drinkable. Quick attendance.\r\nBills that shall not be absolutely extortionate, smiling faces,\r\nand an absence of foul smells. There are many who desire more than\r\nthis;--who expect exquisite cookery, choice wines, subservient\r\ndomestics, distinguished consideration, and the strictest economy.\r\nBut they are uneducated travellers who are going through the\r\napprenticeship of their hotel lives;--who may probably never become\r\nfree of the travellers' guild, or learn to distinguish that which\r\nthey may fairly hope to attain from that which they can never\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nTaking them as a whole I think that the Swiss hotels are the best.\r\nThey are perhaps a little close in the matter of cold water, but\r\neven as to this, they generally give way to pressure. The pressure,\r\nhowever, must not be violent, but gentle rather, and well continued.\r\nTheir bedrooms are excellent. Their cookery is good, and to the\r\noutward senses is cleanly. The people are civil. The whole work of\r\nthe house is carried on upon fixed rules which tend to the comfort of\r\nthe establishment. They are not cheap, and not always quite honest.\r\nBut the exorbitance or dishonesty of their charges rarely exceeds a\r\ncertain reasonable scale, and hardly ever demands the bitter misery\r\nof a remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe inns of the Tyrol are, I think, the cheapest I have known,\r\naffording the traveller what he requires for half the price, or less\r\nthan half, that demanded in Switzerland. But the other half is taken\r\nout in stench and nastiness. As tourists scatter themselves more\r\nprofusely, the prices of the Tyrol will no doubt rise. Let us hope\r\nthat increased prices will bring with them besoms, scrubbing-brushes,\r\nand other much needed articles of cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe inns of the north of Italy are very good, and indeed, the Italian\r\ninns throughout, as far as I know them, are much better than the name\r\nthey bear. The Italians are a civil, kindly people, and do for you,\r\nat any rate, the best they can. Perhaps the unwary traveller may\r\nbe cheated. Ignorant of the language, he may be called on to pay\r\nmore than the man who speaks it, and who can bargain in the Italian\r\nfashion as to price. It has often been my lot, I doubt not, to be\r\nso cheated. But then I have been cheated with a grace that has been\r\nworth all the money. The ordinary prices of Italian inns are by no\r\nmeans high.\r\n\r\nI have seldom thoroughly liked the inns of Germany which I have\r\nknown. They are not clean, and water is very scarce. Smiles too are\r\ngenerally wanting, and I have usually fancied myself to be regarded\r\nas a piece of goods out of which so much profit was to be made.\r\n\r\nThe dearest hotels I know are the French;--and certainly not the\r\nbest. In the provinces they are by no means so cleanly as those of\r\nItaly. Their wines are generally abominable, and their cookery often\r\ndisgusting. In Paris grand dinners may no doubt be had, and luxuries\r\nof every description,--except the luxury of comfort. Cotton-velvet\r\nsofas and ormolu clocks stand in the place of convenient furniture,\r\nand logs of wood, at a franc a log, fail to impart to you the heat\r\nwhich the freezing cold of a Paris winter demands. They used to make\r\ngood coffee in Paris, but even that is a thing of the past. I fancy\r\nthat they import their brandy from England, and manufacture their own\r\ncigars. French wines you may get good at a Paris hotel; but you would\r\ndrink them as good and much cheaper if you bought them in London and\r\ntook them with you.\r\n\r\nThe worst hotels I know are in the Havana. Of course I do not speak\r\nhere of chance mountain huts, or small far-off roadside hostels in\r\nwhich the traveller may find himself from time to time. All such\r\nare to be counted apart, and must be judged on their merits, by the\r\ncircumstances which surround them. But with reference to places of\r\nwide resort, nothing can beat the hotels of the Havana in filth,\r\ndiscomfort, habits of abomination, and absence of everything which\r\nthe traveller desires. All the world does not go to the Havana,\r\nand the subject is not, therefore, one of general interest. But in\r\nspeaking of hotels at large, so much I find myself bound to say.\r\n\r\nIn all the countries to which I have alluded the guests of the house\r\nare expected to sit down together at one table. Conversation is at\r\nany rate possible, and there is the show if not the reality of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAnd now one word as to English inns. I do not think that we\r\nEnglishmen have any great right to be proud of them. The worst about\r\nthem is that they deteriorate from year to year instead of becoming\r\nbetter. We used to hear much of the comfort of the old English\r\nwayside inn, but the old English wayside inn has gone. The railway\r\nhotel has taken its place, and the railway hotel is too frequently\r\ngloomy, desolate, comfortless, and almost suicidal. In England too,\r\nsince the old days are gone, there are wanting the landlord's bow,\r\nand the kindly smile of his stout wife. Who now knows the landlord of\r\nan inn, or cares to inquire whether or no there be a landlady? The\r\nold welcome is wanting, and the cheery warm air which used to atone\r\nfor the bad port and tough beef has passed away;--while the port is\r\nstill bad and the beef too often tough.\r\n\r\nIn England, and only in England, as I believe, is maintained in hotel\r\nlife the theory of solitary existence. The sojourner at an English\r\ninn,--unless he be a commercial traveller, and, as such, a member of\r\na universal, peripatetic tradesman's club,--lives alone. He has his\r\nbreakfast alone, his dinner alone, his pint of wine alone, and his\r\ncup of tea alone. It is not considered practicable that two strangers\r\nshould sit at the same table, or cut from the same dish. Consequently\r\nhis dinner is cooked for him separately, and the hotel keeper can\r\nhardly afford to give him a good dinner. He has two modes of life\r\nfrom which to choose. He either lives in a public room,--called\r\na coffee-room,--and there occupies during his comfortless meal a\r\nseparate small table too frequently removed from fire and light,\r\nthough generally exposed to draughts; or else he indulges in the\r\nluxury of a private sitting-room, and endeavours to find solace on\r\nan old horse-hair sofa, at the cost of seven shillings a day. His\r\nbedroom is not so arranged that he can use it as a sitting-room.\r\nUnder either phase of life he can rarely find himself comfortable,\r\nand therefore he lives as little at an hotel as the circumstances\r\nof his business or of his pleasure will allow. I do not think that\r\nany of the requisites of a good inn are habitually to be found\r\nin perfection at our Kings' Heads and White Horses, though the\r\nfalling-off is not so lamentably distressing as it sometimes is in\r\nother countries. The bedrooms are dingy rather than dirty. Extra\r\npayment to servants will generally produce a tub of cold water. The\r\nfood is never good, but it is usually eatable, and you may have it\r\nwhen you please. The wines are almost always bad, but the traveller\r\ncan fall back upon beer. The attendance is good, provided always that\r\nthe payment for it is liberal. The cost is generally too high, and\r\nunfortunately grows larger and larger from year to year. Smiling\r\nfaces are out of the question unless specially paid for; and as\r\nto that matter of foul smells there is often room for improvement.\r\nAn English inn to a solitary traveller without employment is an\r\nembodiment of dreary desolation. The excuse to be made for this is\r\nthat English men and women do not live much at inns in their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe American inn differs from all those of which I have made mention,\r\nand is altogether an institution apart, and a thing of itself. Hotels\r\nin America are very much larger and more numerous than in other\r\ncountries. They are to be found in all towns, and I may almost say\r\nin all villages. In England and on the Continent we find them on the\r\nrecognized routes of travel and in towns of commercial or social\r\nimportance. On unfrequented roads and in villages there is usually\r\nsome small house of public entertainment in which the unexpected\r\ntraveller may obtain food and shelter, and in which the expected boon\r\ncompanions of the neighbourhood smoke their nightly pipes, and drink\r\ntheir nightly tipple. But in the States of America the first sign\r\nof an incipient settlement is an hotel five stories high, with an\r\noffice, a bar, a cloak-room, three gentlemen's parlours, two ladies'\r\nparlours, a ladies' entrance, and two hundred bedrooms.\r\n\r\nThese, of course, are all built with a view to profit, and it may be\r\npresumed that in each case the originators of the speculation enter\r\ninto some calculation as to their expected guests. Whence are to come\r\nthe sleepers in those two hundred bedrooms, and who is to pay for the\r\ngaudy sofas and numerous lounging chairs of the ladies' parlours? In\r\nall other countries the expectation would extend itself simply to\r\ntravellers;--to travellers or to strangers sojourning in the land.\r\nBut this is by no means the case as to these speculations in America.\r\nWhen the new hotel rises up in the wilderness, it is presumed that\r\npeople will come there with the express object of inhabiting it. The\r\nhotel itself will create a population,--as the railways do. With us\r\nrailways run to the towns; but in the States the towns run to the\r\nrailways. It is the same thing with the hotels.\r\n\r\nHousekeeping is not popular with young married people in America, and\r\nthere are various reasons why this should be so. Men there are not\r\nfixed in their employment as they are with us. If a young Benedict\r\ncannot get along as a lawyer at Salem, perhaps he may thrive as a\r\nshoemaker at Thermopylæ. Jefferson B. Johnson fails in the lumber\r\nline at Eleutheria, but hearing of an opening for a Baptist preacher\r\nat Big Mud Creek moves himself off with his wife and three children\r\nat a week's notice. Aminadab Wiggs takes an engagement as a clerk\r\nat a steam-boat office on the Pongowonga river, but he goes to his\r\nemployment with an inward conviction that six months will see him\r\nearning his bread elsewhere. Under such circumstances even a large\r\nwardrobe is a nuisance, and a collection of furniture would be as\r\nappropriate as a drove of elephants. Then, again, young men and women\r\nmarry without any means already collected on which to commence their\r\nlife. They are content to look forward and to hope that such means\r\nwill come. In so doing they are guilty of no imprudence. It is\r\nthe way of the country; and, if the man be useful for anything,\r\nemployment will certainly come to him. But he must live on the fruits\r\nof that employment, and can only pay his way from week to week and\r\nfrom day to day. And as a third reason I think I may allege that\r\nthe mode of life found in these hotels is liked by the people who\r\nfrequent them. It is to their taste. They are happy, or at any rate\r\ncontented, at these hotels, and do not wish for household cares. As\r\nto the two first reasons which I have given I can agree as to the\r\nnecessity of the case, and quite concur as to the expediency of\r\nmarriage under such circumstances. But as to that matter of taste,\r\nI cannot concur at all. Anything more forlorn than a young married\r\nwoman at an American hotel, it is impossible to conceive.\r\n\r\nSuch are the guests expected for those two hundred bedrooms. The\r\nchance travellers are but chance additions to these, and are not\r\ngenerally the main stay of the house. As a matter of course the\r\naccommodation for travellers which these hotels afford increases\r\nand creates travelling. Men come because they know they will be fed\r\nand bedded at a moderate cost, and in an easy way, suited to their\r\ntastes. With us, and throughout Europe, inquiry is made before an\r\nunaccustomed journey is commenced, on that serious question of\r\nwayside food and shelter. But in the States no such question is\r\nneeded. A big hotel is a matter of course, and therefore men travel.\r\nEverybody travels in the States. The railways and the hotels have\r\nbetween them so churned up the people that an untravelled man or\r\nwoman is a rare animal. We are apt to suppose that travellers make\r\nroads, and that guests create hotels; but the cause and effect run\r\nexactly in the other way. I am almost disposed to think that we\r\nshould become cannibals if gentlemen's legs and ladies' arms were\r\nhung up for sale in purveyors' shops.\r\n\r\nAfter this fashion and with these intentions hotels are built. Size\r\nand an imposing exterior are the first requisitions. Everything about\r\nthem must be on a large scale. A commanding exterior, and a certain\r\ninterior dignity of demeanour is more essential than comfort or\r\ncivility. Whatever an hotel may be it must not be \"mean.\" In the\r\nAmerican vernacular the word \"mean\" is very significant. A mean white\r\nin the South is a man who owns no slaves. Men are often mean, but\r\nactions are seldom so called. A man feels mean when the bluster is\r\ntaken out of him. A mean hotel, conducted in a quiet unostentatious\r\nmanner, in which the only endeavour made had reference to the comfort\r\nof a few guests, would find no favour in the States. These hotels\r\nare not called by the name of any sign, as with us in our provinces.\r\nThere are no \"Presidents' Heads\" or \"General Scotts.\" Nor by the name\r\nof the landlord, or of some former landlord, as with us in London,\r\nand in many cities of the Continent. Nor are they called from some\r\ncountry or city which may have been presumed at some time to have\r\nhad special patronage for the establishment. In the nomenclature of\r\nAmerican hotels the speciality of American hero-worship is shown,\r\nas in the nomenclature of their children. Every inn is a house,\r\nand these houses are generally named after some hero, little known\r\nprobably in the world at large, but highly estimated in that locality\r\nat the moment of the christening.\r\n\r\nThey are always built on a plan which to a European seems to be most\r\nunnecessarily extravagant in space. It is not unfrequently the case\r\nthat the greater portion of the ground-floor is occupied by rooms and\r\nhalls which make no return to the house whatever. The visitor enters\r\na great hall by the front door, and almost invariably finds it full\r\nof men who are idling about, sitting round on stationary seats,\r\ntalking in a listless manner, and getting through their time as\r\nthough the place were a public lounging room. And so it is. The\r\nchances are that not half the crowd are guests at the hotel. I will\r\nnow follow the visitor as he makes his way up to the office. Every\r\nhotel has an office. To call this place the bar, as I have done too\r\nfrequently, is a lamentable error. The bar is held in a separate room\r\nappropriated solely to drinking. To the office, which is in fact a\r\nlong open counter, the guest walks up, and there inscribes his name\r\nin a book. This inscription was to me a moment of misery which I\r\ncould never go through with equanimity. As the name is written, and\r\nas the request for accommodation is made, half a dozen loungers look\r\nover your name and listen to what you say. They listen attentively,\r\nand spell your name carefully, but the great man behind the bar does\r\nnot seem to listen or to heed you. Your destiny is never imparted\r\nto you on the instant. If your wife or any other woman be with you,\r\n(the word \"lady\" is made so absolutely distasteful in American hotels\r\nthat I cannot bring myself to use it in writing of them) she has been\r\ncarried off to a lady's waiting room, and there remains in august\r\nwretchedness till the great man at the bar shall have decided on her\r\nfate. I have never been quite able to fathom the mystery of these\r\ndelays. I think they must have originated in the necessity of waiting\r\nto see what might be the influx of travellers at the moment, and then\r\nhave become exaggerated and brought to their present normal state by\r\nthe gratified feeling of almost divine power with which for the time\r\nit invests that despotic arbiter. I have found it always the same,\r\nthough arriving with no crowd, by a conveyance of my own, when no\r\nother expectant guests were following me. The great man has listened\r\nto my request in silence, with an imperturbable face, and has usually\r\ncontinued his conversation with some loafing friend, who at the time\r\nis probably scrutinizing my name in the book. I have often suffered\r\nin patience; but patience is not specially the badge of my tribe,\r\nand I have sometimes spoken out rather freely. If I may presume\r\nto give advice to my travelling countrymen how to act under such\r\ncircumstances I should recommend to them freedom of speech rather\r\nthan patience. The great man when freely addressed generally opens\r\nhis eyes, and selects the key of your room without further delay. I\r\nam inclined to think that the selection will not be made in any way\r\nto your detriment by reason of that freedom of speech. The lady in\r\nthe ballad who spoke out her own mind to Lord Bateman was sent to her\r\nhome honourably in a coach and three. Had she held her tongue we are\r\njustified in presuming that she would have been returned on a pillion\r\nbehind a servant.\r\n\r\nI have been greatly annoyed by that silence on the part of the hotel\r\nclerk. I have repeatedly asked for room, and received no syllable\r\nin return. I have persisted in my request, and the clerk has nodded\r\nhis head at me. Until a traveller is known, these gentlemen are\r\nsingularly sparing of speech,--especially in the West. The same\r\neconomy of words runs down from the great man at the office all\r\nthrough the servants of the establishment. It arises, I believe,\r\nentirely from that want of courtesy which democratic institutions\r\ncreate. The man whom you address has to make a battle against the\r\nstate of subservience, presumed to be indicated by his position, and\r\nhe does so by declaring his indifference to the person on whose wants\r\nhe is paid to attend. I have been honoured on one or two occasions by\r\nthe subsequent intimacy of these great men at the hotel offices, and\r\nhave then found them ready enough at conversation.\r\n\r\nThat necessity of making your request for rooms before a public\r\naudience is not in itself agreeable, and sometimes entails a\r\nconversation which might be more comfortably made in private. \"What\r\ndo you mean by a dressing-room, and why do you want one?\" Now that\r\nis a question which an Englishman feels awkward at answering before\r\nfive-and-twenty Americans, with open mouths and eager eyes; but\r\nit has to be answered. When I left England, I was assured that\r\nI should not find any need for a separate sitting-room, seeing\r\nthat drawing-rooms more or less sumptuous were prepared for the\r\naccommodation of \"ladies.\" At first we attempted to follow the advice\r\ngiven to us, but we broke down. A man and his wife travelling from\r\ntown to town, and making no sojourn on his way, may eat and sleep\r\nat an hotel without a private parlour. But an Englishwoman cannot\r\nlive in comfort for a week, or even, in comfort, for a day, at any\r\nof these houses, without a sitting-room for herself. The ladies'\r\ndrawing-room is a desolate wilderness. The American women themselves\r\ndo not use it. It is generally empty, or occupied by some forlorn\r\nspinster, eliciting harsh sounds from the wretched piano which it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nThe price at these hotels throughout the Union is nearly always the\r\nsame, viz., two and a half dollars a day, for which a bedroom is\r\ngiven, and as many meals as the guest can contrive to eat. This\r\nis the price for chance guests. The cost to monthly boarders is,\r\nI believe, not more than the half of this. Ten shillings a day,\r\ntherefore, covers everything that is absolutely necessary, servants\r\nincluded. And this must be said in praise of these inns: that the\r\ntraveller can compute his expenses accurately, and can absolutely\r\nbring them within that daily sum of ten shillings. This includes\r\na great deal of eating, a great deal of attendance, the use of\r\nreading-rooms and smoking-rooms--which, however, always seem to\r\nbe open to the public as well as to the guests,--and a bedroom\r\nwith accommodation which is at any rate as good as the average\r\naccommodation of hotels in Europe. In the large Eastern towns baths\r\nare attached to many of the rooms. I always carry my own, and have\r\nnever failed in getting water. It must be acknowledged that the price\r\nis very low. It is so low that I believe it affords, as a rule, no\r\nprofit whatsoever. The profit is made upon extra charges, and they\r\nare higher than in any other country that I have visited. They are so\r\nhigh that I consider travelling in America, for an Englishman with\r\nhis wife or family, to be more expensive than travelling in any part\r\nof Europe. First in the list of extras comes that matter of the\r\nsitting-room, and by that for a man and his wife the whole first\r\nexpense is at once doubled. The ordinary charge is five dollars, or\r\none pound a day! A guest intending to stay for two or three weeks\r\nat an hotel, or perhaps for one week, may, by agreement, have this\r\ncharge reduced. At one inn I stayed a fortnight, and having made no\r\nsuch agreement was charged the full sum. I felt myself stirred up to\r\ncomplain, and did in that case remonstrate. I was asked how much I\r\nwished to have returned,--for the bill had been paid,--and the sum I\r\nsuggested was at once handed to me. But even with such reduction the\r\nprice is very high, and at once makes the American hotel expensive.\r\nWine also at these houses is very costly, and very bad. The usual\r\nprice is two dollars, or eight shillings, a bottle. The people of the\r\ncountry rarely drink wine at dinner in the hotels. When they do so,\r\nthey drink champagne; but their normal drinking is done separately,\r\nat the bar, chiefly before dinner, and at a cheap rate. \"A drink,\"\r\nlet it be what it may, invariably costs a dime, or fivepence. But\r\nif you must have a glass of sherry with your dinner, it costs two\r\ndollars; for sherry does not grow into pint bottles in the States.\r\nBut the guest who remains for two days can have his wine kept for\r\nhim. Washing also is an expensive luxury. The price of this is\r\ninvariable, being always fourpence for everything washed. A cambric\r\nhandkerchief or muslin dress all come out at the same price. For\r\nthose who are cunning in the matter this may do very well; but\r\nfor men and women whose cuffs and collars are numerous it becomes\r\nexpensive. The craft of those who are cunning is shown, I think, in\r\nlittle internal washings, by which the cambric handkerchiefs are kept\r\nout of the list, while the muslin dresses are placed upon it. I am\r\nled to this surmise by the energetic measures taken by the hotel\r\nkeepers to prevent such domestic washings, and by the denunciations\r\nwhich in every hotel are pasted up in every room against the\r\npractice. I could not at first understand why I was always warned\r\nagainst washing my own clothes in my own bedroom, and told that no\r\nforeign laundress could on any account be admitted into the house.\r\nThe injunctions given on this head are almost frantic in their\r\nenergy, and therefore I conceive that hotel keepers find themselves\r\nexposed to much suffering in the matter. At these hotels they wash\r\nwith great rapidity, sending you back your clothes in four or five\r\nhours if you desire it.\r\n\r\nAnother very stringent order is placed before the face of all\r\nvisitors at American hotels, desiring them on no account to leave\r\nvaluable property in their rooms. I presume that there must have been\r\nsome difficulty in this matter in bygone years, for in every State a\r\nlaw has been passed declaring that hotel keepers shall not be held\r\nresponsible for money or jewels stolen out of rooms in their houses,\r\nprovided that they are furnished with safes for keeping such money,\r\nand give due caution to their guests on the subject. The due caution\r\nis always given, but I have seldom myself taken any notice of it. I\r\nhave always left my portmanteau open, and have kept my money usually\r\nin a travelling desk in my room. But I never to my knowledge lost\r\nanything. The world, I think, gives itself credit for more thieves\r\nthan it possesses. As to the female servants at American inns, they\r\nare generally all that is disagreeable. They are uncivil, impudent,\r\ndirty, slow,--provoking to a degree. But I believe that they keep\r\ntheir hands from picking and stealing.\r\n\r\nI never yet made a single comfortable meal at an American hotel, or\r\nrose from my breakfast or dinner with that feeling of satisfaction\r\nwhich should, I think, be felt at such moments in a civilized land in\r\nwhich cookery prevails as an art. I have had enough, and have been\r\nhealthy and am thankful. But that thankfulness is altogether a matter\r\napart, and does not bear upon the question. If need be I can eat food\r\nthat is disagreeable to my palate, and make no complaint. But I hold\r\nit to be compatible with the principles of an advanced Christianity\r\nto prefer food that is palatable. I never could get any of that\r\nkind at an American hotel. All meal-times at such houses were to me\r\nperiods of disagreeable duty; and at this moment, as I write these\r\nlines at the hotel in which I am still staying, I pine for an English\r\nleg of mutton. But I do not wish it to be supposed that the fault\r\nof which I complain,--for it is a grievous fault,--is incidental to\r\nAmerica as a nation. I have stayed in private houses, and have daily\r\nsat down to dinners quite as good as any my own kitchen could afford\r\nme. Their dinner parties are generally well done, and as a people\r\nthey are by no means indifferent to the nature of their comestibles.\r\nIt is of the hotels that I speak, and of them I again say that\r\neating in them is a disagreeable task,--a painful labour. It is as a\r\nschoolboy's lesson, or the six hours' confinement of a clerk at his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nThe mode of eating is as follows. Certain feeding hours are named,\r\nwhich generally include nearly all the day. Breakfast from six till\r\nten. Dinner from one till five. Tea from six till nine. Supper from\r\nnine till twelve. When the guest presents himself at any of these\r\nhours he is marshalled to a seat, and a bill is put into his hand\r\ncontaining the names of all the eatables then offered for his choice.\r\nThe list is incredibly and most unnecessarily long. Then it is that\r\nyou will see care written on the face of the American hotel liver,\r\nas he studies the programme of the coming performance. With men this\r\npasses off unnoticed, but with young girls the appearance of the\r\nthing is not attractive. The anxious study, the elaborate reading\r\nof the daily book, and then the choice proclaimed with clear\r\narticulation. \"Boiled mutton and caper sauce, roast duck, hashed\r\nvenison, mashed potatoes, poached eggs and spinach, stewed tomatoes.\r\nYes; and waiter,--some squash.\" There is no false delicacy in the\r\nvoice by which this order is given, no desire for a gentle whisper.\r\nThe dinner is ordered with the firm determination of an American\r\nheroine, and in some five minutes' time all the little dishes appear\r\nat once, and the lady is surrounded by her banquet.\r\n\r\nHow I did learn to hate those little dishes and their greasy\r\ncontents! At a London eating-house things are often not very nice,\r\nbut your meat is put on a plate and comes before you in an edible\r\nshape. At these hotels it is brought to you in horrid little oval\r\ndishes, and swims in grease. Gravy is not an institution at American\r\nhotels, but grease has taken its place. It is palpable, undisguised\r\ngrease, floating in rivers,--not grease caused by accidental bad\r\ncookery, but grease on purpose. A beef-steak is not a beef-steak\r\nunless a quarter of a pound of butter be added to it. Those horrid\r\nlittle dishes! If one thinks of it how could they have been made to\r\ncontain Christian food? Every article in that long list is liable\r\nto the call of any number of guests for four hours. Under such\r\ncircumstances how can food be made eatable? Your roast mutton is\r\nbrought to you raw;--if you object to that you are supplied with meat\r\nthat has been four times brought before the public. At hotels on the\r\ncontinent of Europe different dinners are cooked at different hours,\r\nbut here the same dinner is kept always going. The house breakfast\r\nis maintained on a similar footing. Huge boilers of tea and coffee\r\nare stewed down and kept hot. To me those meals were odious. It is\r\nof course open to any one to have separate dinners and separate\r\nbreakfasts in his own room; but by this little is gained and much\r\nis lost. He or she who is so exclusive pays twice over for such\r\nmeals,--as they are charged as extras on the bill; and, after all,\r\nreceives the advantage of no exclusive cooking. Particles from the\r\npublic dinners are brought to the private room, and the same odious\r\nlittle dishes make their appearance.\r\n\r\nBut the most striking peculiarity of the American hotels is in their\r\npublic rooms. Of the ladies' drawing-room I have spoken. There\r\nare two and sometimes three in one hotel, and they are generally\r\nfurnished at any rate expensively. It seems to me that the space\r\nand the furniture are almost thrown away. At watering places, and\r\nsea-side summer hotels they are, I presume, used; but at ordinary\r\nhotels they are empty deserts. The intention is good, for they are\r\nestablished with the view of giving to ladies at hotels the comforts\r\nof ordinary domestic life; but they fail in their effect. Ladies will\r\nnot make themselves happy in any room, or with ever so much gilded\r\nfurniture, unless some means of happiness be provided for them. Into\r\nthese rooms no book is ever brought, no needle-work is introduced;\r\nfrom them no clatter of many tongues is ever heard. On a marble table\r\nin the middle of the room always stands a large pitcher of iced\r\nwater, and from this a cold, damp, uninviting air is spread through\r\nthe atmosphere of the ladies' drawing-room.\r\n\r\nBelow, on the ground floor, there is, in the first place, the huge\r\nentrance hall, at the back of which, behind a bar, the great man of\r\nthe place keeps the keys and holds his court. There are generally\r\nseats around it, in which smokers sit,--or men not smoking but\r\nruminating. Opening off from this are reading rooms, smoking rooms,\r\nshaving rooms, drinking rooms, parlours for gentlemen in which\r\nsmoking is prohibited, and which are generally as desolate as the\r\nladies' sitting-rooms above. In those other more congenial chambers\r\nis always gathered together a crowd, apparently belonging in no way\r\nto the hotel. It would seem that a great portion of an American\r\ninn is as open to the public as an Exchange, or as the wayside of\r\nthe street. In the West, during the early months of this war, the\r\ntraveller would always see many soldiers among the crowd,--not\r\nonly officers, but privates. They sit in public seats, silent but\r\napparently contented, sometimes for an hour together. All Americans\r\nare given to gatherings such as these. It is the much-loved\r\ninstitution to which the name of \"loafing\" has been given.\r\n\r\nI do not like the mode of life which prevails in the American\r\nhotels. I have come across exceptions, and know one or two that are\r\ncomfortable,--always excepting that matter of eating and drinking.\r\nBut taking them as a whole I do not like their mode of life. I feel,\r\nhowever, bound to add that the hotels of Canada, which are kept,\r\nI think, always after the same fashion, are infinitely worse than\r\nthose of the United States. I do not like the American hotels; but\r\nI must say in their favour that they afford an immense amount of\r\naccommodation. The traveller is rarely told that an hotel is full, so\r\nthat travelling in America is without one of those great perils to\r\nwhich it is subject in Europe. It must also be acknowledged that for\r\nthe ordinary purposes of a traveller they are very cheap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the literature of any country we are, I think, too\r\nmuch inclined to regard the question as one appertaining exclusively\r\nto the writers of books,--not acknowledging, as we should do, that\r\nthe literary character of a people will depend much more upon what\r\nit reads than what it writes. If we can suppose any people to have\r\nan intimate acquaintance with the best literary efforts of other\r\ncountries, we should hardly be correct in saying that such a people\r\nhad no literary history of their own because it had itself produced\r\nnothing in literature. And, with reference to those countries which\r\nhave been most fertile in the production of good books, I doubt\r\nwhether their literary histories would not have more to tell of those\r\nages in which much has been read than of those in which much has been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThe United States have been by no means barren in the production\r\nof literature. The truth is so far from this that their literary\r\ntriumphs are perhaps those which of all their triumphs are the most\r\nhonourable to them, and which, considering their position as a young\r\nnation, are the most permanently satisfactory. But though they\r\nhave done much in writing, they have done much more in reading. As\r\nproducers they are more than respectable, but as consumers they are\r\nthe most conspicuous people on the earth. It is impossible to speak\r\nof the subject of literature in America without thinking of the\r\nreaders rather than of the writers. In this matter their position is\r\ndifferent from that of any other great people, seeing that they share\r\nthe advantages of our language. An American will perhaps consider\r\nhimself to be as little like an Englishman as he is like a Frenchman.\r\nBut he reads Shakespeare through the medium of his own vernacular,\r\nand has to undergo the penance of a foreign tongue before he can\r\nunderstand Molière. He separates himself from England in politics and\r\nperhaps in affection; but he cannot separate himself from England in\r\nmental culture. It may be suggested that an Englishman has the same\r\nadvantages as regards America; and it is true that he is obtaining\r\nmuch of such advantage. Irving, Prescott, and Longfellow are the same\r\nto England as though she herself had produced them. But the balance\r\nof advantage must be greatly in favour of America. We have given her\r\nthe work of four hundred years, and have received back in return the\r\nwork of fifty.\r\n\r\nAnd of this advantage the Americans have not been slow to avail\r\nthemselves. As consumers of literature they are certainly the most\r\nconspicuous people on the earth. Where an English publisher contents\r\nhimself with thousands of copies an American publisher deals with\r\nten thousands. The sale of a new book, which in numbers would amount\r\nto a considerable success with us, would with them be a lamentable\r\nfailure. This of course is accounted for, as regards the author\r\nand the publisher, by the difference of price at which the book is\r\nproduced. One thousand in England will give perhaps as good a return\r\nas the ten thousand in America. But as regards the readers there can\r\nbe no such equalization. The thousand copies cannot spread themselves\r\nas do the ten thousand. The one book at a guinea cannot multiply\r\nitself, let Mr. Mudie do what he will, as do the ten books at a\r\ndollar. Ultimately there remain the ten books against the one; and\r\nif there be not the ten readers against the one, there are five,\r\nor four, or three. Everybody in the States has books about his\r\nhouse. \"And so has everybody in England,\" will say my English\r\nreader, mindful of the libraries, or book-rooms, or book-crowded\r\ndrawing-rooms of his friends and acquaintances. But has my English\r\nreader who so replies examined the libraries of many English cabmen,\r\nof ticket porters, of warehousemen, and of agricultural labourers?\r\nI cannot take upon myself to say that I have done so with any close\r\nsearch in the States. But when it has been in my power I have done\r\nso, and I have always found books in such houses as I have entered.\r\nThe amount of printed matter which is poured forth in streams from\r\nthe printing-presses of the great American publishers is, however, a\r\nbetter proof of the truth of what I say than anything that I can have\r\nseen myself.\r\n\r\nBut of what class are the books that are so read? There are many\r\nwho think that reading in itself is not good unless the matter\r\nread be excellent. I do not myself quite agree with this, thinking\r\nthat almost any reading is better than none; but I will of course\r\nadmit that good matter is better than bad matter. The bulk of the\r\nliterature consumed in the States is no doubt composed of novels,--as\r\nit is also, now-a-days, in this country. Whether or no an unlimited\r\nsupply of novels for young people is or is not advantageous, I will\r\nnot here pretend to say. The general opinion with ourselves I take it\r\nis, that novels are bad reading if they be bad of their kind. Novels\r\nthat are not bad are now-a-days accepted generally as indispensable\r\nto our households. Whatever may be the weakness of the American\r\nliterary taste in this respect, it is, I think, a weakness which we\r\nshare. There are more novel readers among them than with us, but\r\nonly, I think, in the proportion that there are more readers.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation in saying, that works by English authors are\r\nmore popular in the States than those written by themselves; and,\r\namong English authors of the present day, they by no means confine\r\nthemselves to the novelists. The English names of whom I heard\r\nmost during my sojourn in the States were perhaps those of Dickens,\r\nTennyson, Buckle, Tom Hughes, Martin Tupper, and Thackeray. As the\r\nowners of all these names are still living, I am not going to take\r\nupon myself the delicate task of criticising the American taste.\r\nI may not perhaps coincide with them in every respect. But if I be\r\nright as to the names which I have given, such a selection shows that\r\nthey do get beyond novels. I have little doubt but that many more\r\ncopies of Dickens's novels have been sold during the last three\r\nyears, than of the works either of Tennyson or of Buckle; but such\r\nalso has been the case in England. It will probably be admitted\r\nthat one copy of the \"Civilization\" should be held as being equal\r\nto five-and-twenty of \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" and that a single \"In\r\nMemoriam\" may fairly weigh down half-a-dozen \"Pickwicks.\" Men and\r\nwomen after their day's work are not always up to the \"Civilization.\"\r\nAs a rule they are generally up to \"Proverbial Philosophy,\" and this,\r\nperhaps, may have had something to do with the great popularity of\r\nthat very popular work.\r\n\r\nI would not have it supposed that American readers despise their own\r\nauthors. The Americans are very proud of having a literature of their\r\nown. Among the literary names which they honour, there are none, I\r\nthink, more honourable than those of Cooper and Irving. They like to\r\nknow that their modern historians are acknowledged as great authors,\r\nand as regards their own poets will sometimes demand your admiration\r\nfor strains with which you hardly find yourself to be familiar. But\r\nEnglish books are, I think, the better loved;--even the English books\r\nof the present day. And even beyond this,--with those who choose\r\nto indulge in the costly luxuries of literature,--books printed in\r\nEngland are more popular than those which are printed in their own\r\ncountry; and yet the manner in which the American publishers put\r\nout their work is very good. The book sold there at a dollar, or a\r\ndollar and a quarter, quite equals our ordinary five shilling volume.\r\nNevertheless English books are preferred,--almost as strongly as are\r\nFrench bonnets. Of books absolutely printed and produced in England\r\nthe supply in the States is of course small. They must necessarily be\r\ncostly, and as regards new books, are always subjected to the rivalry\r\nof a cheaper American copy. But of the reprinted works of English\r\nauthors the supply is unlimited, and the sale very great. Almost\r\neverything is reprinted; certainly everything which can be said to\r\nattain any home popularity. I do not know how far English authors\r\nmay be aware of the fact; but it is undoubtedly a fact that their\r\ninfluence as authors is greater on the other side of the Atlantic\r\nthan on this. It is there that they have their most numerous school\r\nof pupils. It is there that they are recognized as teachers by\r\nhundreds of thousands. It is of those thirty millions that they\r\nshould think, at any rate in part, when they discuss within their\r\nown hearts that question which all authors do discuss, whether that\r\nwhich they write shall in itself be good or bad,--be true or false.\r\nA writer in England may not, perhaps, think very much of this with\r\nreference to some trifle of which his English publisher proposes to\r\nsell some seven or eight hundred copies. But he begins to feel that\r\nhe should have thought of it when he learns that twenty or thirty\r\nthousand copies of the same have been scattered through the length\r\nand breadth of the United States. The English author should feel that\r\nhe writes for the widest circle of readers ever yet obtained by the\r\nliterature of any country. He provides not only for his own country\r\nand for the States, but for the readers who are rising by millions\r\nin the British colonies. Canada is supplied chiefly from the presses\r\nof Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, but she is supplied with\r\nthe works of the mother country. India, as I take it, gets all her\r\nbooks direct from London, as do the West Indies. Whether or no the\r\nAustralian colonies have as yet learned to reprint our books I do not\r\nknow, but I presume that they cannot do so as cheaply as they can\r\nimport them. London with us, and the three cities which I have named\r\non the other side of the Atlantic, are the places at which this\r\nliterature is manufactured; but the demand in the western hemisphere\r\nis becoming more brisk than that which the old world creates. There\r\nis, I have no doubt, more literary matter printed in London than in\r\nall America put together. A greater extent of letter-press is put up\r\nin London than in the three publishing cities of the States. But the\r\nnumber of copies issued by the American publishers is so much greater\r\nthan those which ours put forth, that the greater bulk of literature\r\nis with them. If this be so, the demand with them is of course\r\ngreater than it is with us.\r\n\r\nI have spoken here of the privilege which an English author enjoys\r\nby reason of the ever widening circle of readers to whom he writes.\r\nI speak of the privilege of an English author as distinguished from\r\nthat of an American author. I profess my belief that in the United\r\nStates an English author has an advantage over one of that country\r\nmerely in the fact of his being English, as a French milliner has\r\nundoubtedly an advantage in her nationality let her merits or\r\ndemerits as a milliner be what they may. I think that English books\r\nare better liked because they are English. But I do not know that\r\nthere is any feeling with us either for or against an author because\r\nhe is American. I believe that Longfellow stands in our judgment\r\nexactly where he would have stood had he been a tutor at a college in\r\nOxford instead of a Professor at Cambridge in Massachusetts. Prescott\r\nis read among us as an historian without any reference as to his\r\nnationality, and by many, as I take it, in absolute ignorance of\r\nhis nationality. Hawthorne, the novelist, is quite as well known in\r\nEngland as he is in his own country. But I do not know that to either\r\nof these three is awarded any favour or is denied any justice because\r\nhe is an American. Washington Irving published many of his works in\r\nthis country, receiving very large sums for them from Mr. Murray, and\r\nI fancy that in dealing with his publisher he found neither advantage\r\nnor disadvantage in his nationality;--that is, of course, advantage\r\nor disadvantage in reference to the light in which his works would be\r\nregarded. It must be admitted that there is no jealousy in the States\r\nagainst English authors. I think that there is a feeling in their\r\nfavour, but no one can at any rate allege that there is a feeling\r\nagainst them. I think I may also assert on the part of my own country\r\nthat there is no jealousy here against American authors. As regards\r\nthe tastes of the people, the works of each country flow freely\r\nthrough the other. That is as it should be. But when we come to the\r\nmode of supply, things are not exactly as they should be; and I do\r\nnot believe that any one will contradict me when I say that the fault\r\nis with the Americans.\r\n\r\nI presume that all my readers know the meaning of the word copyright.\r\nA man's copyright, or right in his copy, is that amount of legal\r\npossession in the production of his brains which has been secured to\r\nhim by the laws of his own country and by the laws of others. Unless\r\nan author were secured by such laws, his writings would be of but\r\nlittle pecuniary value to him, as the right of printing and selling\r\nthem would be open to all the world. In England and in America, and\r\nas I conceive in all countries possessing a literature, there is such\r\na law securing to authors and to their heirs for a term of years the\r\nexclusive right over their own productions. That this should be so\r\nin England as regards English authors is so much a matter of course,\r\nthat the copyright of an author would seem to be as naturally his\r\nown as a gentleman's deposit at his bank or his little investment in\r\nthe three per cents. The right of an author to the value of his own\r\nproductions in other countries than his own is not so much a matter\r\nof course; but nevertheless, if such productions have any value in\r\nother countries, that value should belong to him. This has been felt\r\nto be the case between England and France, and treaties have been\r\nmade securing his own property to the author in each country. The\r\nfact that the languages of England and France are different makes the\r\nmatter one of comparatively small moment. But it has been found to be\r\nfor the honour and profit of the two countries, that there should be\r\nsuch a law, and an international copyright does exist. But if such\r\nan arrangement be needed between two such countries as France and\r\nEngland,--between two countries which do not speak the same language\r\nor share the same literature,--how much more necessary must it be\r\nbetween England and the United States? The literature of the one\r\ncountry is the literature of the other. The poem that is popular\r\nin London will certainly be popular in New York. The novel that is\r\neffective among American ladies will be equally so with those of\r\nEngland. There can be no doubt as to the importance of having a\r\nlaw of copyright between the two countries. The only question can\r\nbe as to the expediency and the justice. At present there is no\r\ninternational copyright between England and the United States, and\r\nthere is none because the States have declined to sanction any such\r\nlaw. It is known by all who are concerned in the matter on either\r\nside of the water that as far as Great Britain is concerned such a\r\nlaw would meet with no impediment.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is to be presumed that the legislators of the States\r\nthink it expedient and just to dispense with any such law. I have\r\nsaid that there can be no doubt as to the importance of the question,\r\nseeing that the price of English literature in the States must be\r\nmost materially affected by it. Without such a law the Americans are\r\nenabled to import English literature without paying for it. It is\r\nopen to any American publisher to reprint any work from an English\r\ncopy, and to sell his reprints without any permission obtained from\r\nthe English author or from the English publisher. The absolute\r\nmaterial which the American publisher sells, he takes, or can take,\r\nfor nothing. The paper, ink, and composition he supplies in the\r\nordinary way of business; but of the very matter which he professes\r\nto sell,--of the book which is the object of his trade, he is enabled\r\nto possess himself for nothing. If you, my reader, be a popular\r\nauthor, an American publisher will take the choicest work of your\r\nbrain and make dollars out of it, selling thousands of copies of it\r\nin his country, whereas you can, perhaps, only sell hundreds of it\r\nin your own; and will either give you nothing for that he takes,--or\r\nelse will explain to you that he need give you nothing, and that in\r\npaying you anything he subjects himself to the danger of seeing the\r\nproperty which he has bought taken again from him by other persons.\r\nIf this be so that question whether or no there shall be a law\r\nof international copyright between the two countries cannot be\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\nBut it may be inexpedient that there shall be such a law. It may be\r\nconsidered well, that as the influx of English books into America\r\nis much greater than the out-flux of American books back to England,\r\nthe right of obtaining such books for nothing should be reserved,\r\nalthough the country in doing so robs its own authors of the\r\nadvantage which should accrue to them from the English market. It\r\nmight perhaps be thought anything but smart to surrender such an\r\nadvantage by the passing of an international copyright bill. There\r\nare not many trades in which the tradesman can get the chief of his\r\ngoods for nothing; and it may be thought, that the advantage arising\r\nto the States from such an arrangement of circumstances should not\r\nbe abandoned. But how then about the justice? It would seem that\r\nthe less said upon that subject the better. I have heard no one say\r\nthat an author's property in his own works should not, in accordance\r\nwith justice, be insured to him in the one country as well as in the\r\nother. I have seen no defence of the present position of affairs,\r\non the score of justice. The price of books would be enhanced by an\r\ninternational copyright law, and it is well that books should be\r\ncheap. That is the only argument used. So would mutton be cheap, if\r\nit could be taken out of a butcher's shop for nothing!\r\n\r\nBut I absolutely deny the expediency of the present position of the\r\nmatter, looking simply to the material advantage of the American\r\npeople in the matter, and throwing aside altogether that question\r\nof justice. I must here, however, explain that I bring no charge\r\nwhatsoever against the American publishers. The English author is\r\na victim in their hands, but it is by no means their fault that he\r\nis so. As a rule, they are willing to pay for the works of popular\r\nEnglish writers, but in arranging as to what payments they can make,\r\nthey must of course bear in mind the fact that they have no exclusive\r\nright whatsoever in the things which they purchase. It is natural,\r\nalso, that they should bear in mind when making their purchases,\r\nand arranging their prices, that they can have the very thing they\r\nare buying without any payment at all, if the price asked do not\r\nsuit them. It is not of the publishers that I complain, or of any\r\nadvantage which they take; but of the legislators of the country, and\r\nof the advantage which accrues, or is thought by them to accrue to\r\nthe American people from the absence of an international copyright\r\nlaw. It is mean on their part to take such advantage if it existed;\r\nand it is foolish in them to suppose that any such advantage can\r\naccrue. The absence of any law of copyright no doubt gives to the\r\nAmerican publisher the power of reprinting the works of English\r\nauthors without paying for them,--seeing that the English author is\r\nundefended. But the American publisher who brings out such a reprint\r\nis equally undefended in his property. When he shall have produced\r\nhis book, his rival in the next street may immediately reprint it\r\nfrom him, and destroy the value of his property by underselling him.\r\nIt is probable that the first American publisher will have made some\r\npayment to the English author for the privilege of publishing the\r\nbook honestly,--of publishing it without recurrence to piracy,--and\r\nin arranging his price with his customers he will be, of course,\r\nobliged to debit the book with the amount so paid. If the author\r\nreceive ten cents a copy on every copy sold, the publisher must add\r\nthat ten cents to the price he charges for it. But he cannot do this\r\nwith security, because the book can be immediately reprinted, and\r\nsold without any such addition to the price. The only security which\r\nthe American publisher has against the injury which may be so done to\r\nhim, is the power of doing other injury in return. The men who stand\r\nhigh in the trade, and who are powerful because of the largeness of\r\ntheir dealings, can in a certain measure secure themselves in this\r\nway. Such a firm would have the power of crushing a small tradesman\r\nwho should interfere with him. But if the large firm commits any\r\nsuch act of injustice, the little men in the trade have no power of\r\nsetting themselves right by counter injustice. I need hardly point\r\nout what must be the effect of such a state of things upon the whole\r\npublishing trade; nor need I say more to prove that some law which\r\nshall regulate property in foreign copyrights would be as expedient\r\nwith reference to America, as it would be just towards England. But\r\nthe wrong done by America to herself does not rest here. It is true\r\nthat more English books are read in the States than American books\r\nin England, but it is equally true that the literature of America is\r\ndaily gaining readers among us. That injury to which English authors\r\nare subjected from the want of protection in the States, American\r\nauthors suffer from the want of protection here. One can hardly\r\nbelieve that the legislators of the States would willingly place the\r\nbrightest of their own fellow countrymen in this position, because in\r\nthe event of a copyright bill being passed, the balance of advantage\r\nwould seem to accrue to England!\r\n\r\nOf the literature of the United States, speaking of literature in its\r\nordinary sense, I do not know that I need say much more. I regard\r\nthe literature of a country as its highest produce, believing it to\r\nbe more powerful in its general effect, and more beneficial in its\r\nresults, than either statesmanship, professional ability, religious\r\nteaching, or commerce. And in no part of its national career have\r\nthe United States been so successful as in this. I need hardly\r\nexplain that I should commit a monstrous injustice were I to make a\r\ncomparison in this matter between England and America. Literature is\r\nthe child of leisure and wealth. It is the produce of minds which by\r\na happy combination of circumstances have been enabled to dispense\r\nwith the ordinary cares of the world. It can hardly be expected to\r\ncome from a young country, or from a new and still struggling people.\r\nLooking around at our own magnificent colonies I hardly remember\r\na considerable name which they have produced, except that of my\r\nexcellent old friend, Sam Slick. Nothing, therefore, I think, shows\r\nthe settled greatness of the people of the States more significantly\r\nthan their firm establishment of a national literature. This\r\nliterature runs over all subjects. American authors have excelled in\r\npoetry, in science, in history, in metaphysics, in law, in theology,\r\nand in fiction. They have attempted all, and failed in none. What\r\nEnglishman has devoted a room to books, and devoted no portion of\r\nthat room to the productions of America?\r\n\r\nBut I must say a word of literature in which I shall not speak of it\r\nin its ordinary sense, and shall yet speak of it in that sense which\r\nof all perhaps, in the present day, should be considered the most\r\nordinary. I mean the every-day periodical literature of the press.\r\nMost of those who can read, it is to be hoped, read books; but all\r\nwho can read do read newspapers. Newspapers in this country are so\r\ngeneral that men cannot well live without them; but to men, and to\r\nwomen also, in the United States they may be said to be the one chief\r\nnecessary of life. And yet in the whole length and breadth of the\r\nUnited States there is not published a single newspaper which seems\r\nto me to be worthy of praise.\r\n\r\nA really good newspaper,--one excellent at all points,--would indeed\r\nbe a triumph of honesty and of art! Not only is such a publication\r\nmuch to be desired in America, but it is still to be desired in\r\nGreat Britain also. I used, in my younger days, to think of such\r\na newspaper as a possible publication, and in a certain degree I\r\nthen looked for it. Now I expect it only in my dreams. It should be\r\npowerful without tyranny, popular without triumph, political without\r\nparty passion, critical without personal feeling, right in its\r\nstatements and just in its judgments, but right and just without\r\npride. It should be all but omniscient, but not conscious of its\r\nomniscience; it should be moral, but not strait-laced; it should be\r\nwell-assured, but yet modest; though never humble, it should be free\r\nfrom boasting. Above all these things it should be readable; and\r\nabove that again it should be true. I used to think that such a\r\nnewspaper might be produced, but I now sadly acknowledge to myself\r\nthe fact that humanity is not capable of any work so divine.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the States generally may not only be said to have\r\nreached none of the virtues here named, but to have fallen into\r\nall the opposite vices. In the first place they are never true. In\r\nrequiring truth from a newspaper the public should not be anxious to\r\nstrain at gnats. A statement setting forth that a certain gooseberry\r\nwas five inches in circumference, whereas in truth its girth was only\r\ntwo and a half, would give me no offence. Nor would I be offended at\r\nbeing told that Lord Derby was appointed to the premiership, while in\r\ntruth the Queen had only sent for his lordship, having as yet come to\r\nno definite arrangement. The demand for truth which may reasonably be\r\nmade upon a newspaper amounts to this,--that nothing should be stated\r\nnot believed to be true, and that nothing should be stated as to\r\nwhich the truth is important, without adequate ground for such\r\nbelief. If a newspaper accuse me of swindling, it is not sufficient\r\nthat the writer believe me to be a swindler. He should have ample\r\nand sufficient ground for such belief;--otherwise in making such a\r\nstatement he will write falsely. In our private life we all recognize\r\nthe fact that this is so. It is understood that a man is not a\r\nwhit the less a slanderer because he believes the slander which\r\nhe promulgates. But it seems to me that this is not sufficiently\r\nrecognized by many who write for the public press. Evil things are\r\nsaid, and are probably believed by the writers; they are said with\r\nthat special skill for which newspaper writers have in our days\r\nbecome so conspicuous, defying alike redress by law or redress by\r\nargument; but they are too often said falsely. The words are not\r\nmeasured when they are written, and they are allowed to go forth\r\nwithout any sufficient inquiry into their truth. But if there be any\r\nground for such complaint here in England, that ground is multiplied\r\nten times--twenty times--in the States. This is not only shown in\r\nthe abuse of individuals, in abuse which is as violent as it is\r\nperpetual, but in the treatment of every subject which is handled.\r\nAll idea of truth has been thrown overboard. It seems to be admitted\r\nthat the only object is to produce a sensation, and that it is\r\nadmitted by both writer and reader that sensation and veracity are\r\nincompatible. Falsehood has become so much a matter of course with\r\nAmerican newspapers that it has almost ceased to be falsehood. Nobody\r\nthinks me a liar because I deny that I am at home when I am in my\r\nstudy. The nature of the arrangement is generally understood. So also\r\nis it with the American newspapers.\r\n\r\nBut American newspapers are also unreadable. It is very bad that\r\nthey should be false, but it is very surprising that they should\r\nbe dull. Looking at the general intelligence of the people, one\r\nwould have thought that a readable newspaper, put out with all\r\npleasant appurtenances of clear type, good paper, and good internal\r\narrangement, would have been a thing specially within their reach.\r\nBut they have failed in every detail. Though their papers are always\r\nloaded with sensation headings, there are seldom sensation paragraphs\r\nto follow. The paragraphs do not fit the headings. Either they cannot\r\nbe found, or if found they seem to have escaped from their proper\r\ncolumn to some distant and remote portion of the sheet. One is led to\r\npresume that no American editor has any plan in the composition of\r\nhis newspaper. I never know whether I have as yet got to the very\r\nheart's core of the daily journal, or whether I am still to go on\r\nsearching for that heart's core. Alas, it too often happens that\r\nthere is no heart's core! The whole thing seems to have been put\r\nout at hap-hazard. And then the very writing is in itself below\r\nmediocrity;--as though a power of expression in properly arranged\r\nlanguage was not required by a newspaper editor, either as regards\r\nhimself or as regards his subordinates. One is driven to suppose that\r\nthe writers for the daily press are not chosen with any view to such\r\ncapability. A man ambitious of being on the staff of an American\r\nnewspaper should be capable of much work, should be satisfied with\r\nsmall pay, should be indifferent to the world's good usage, should\r\nbe rough, ready, and of long sufferance; but, above all, he should\r\nbe smart. The type of almost all American newspapers is wretched--I\r\nthink I may say of all;--so wretched that that alone forbids one to\r\nhope for pleasure in reading them. They are ill-written, ill-printed,\r\nill-arranged, and in fact are not readable. They are bought, glanced\r\nat, and thrown away.\r\n\r\nThey are full of boastings,--not boastings simply as to their\r\ncountry, their town, or their party,--but of boastings as to\r\nthemselves. And yet they possess no self-assurance. It is always\r\nevident that they neither trust themselves, nor expect to be trusted.\r\nThey have made no approach to that omniscience which constitutes the\r\ngreat marvel of our own daily press; but finding it necessary to\r\nwrite as though they possessed it, they fall into blunders which\r\nare almost as marvellous. Justice and right judgment are out of\r\nthe question with them. A political party end is always in view,\r\nand political party warfare in America admits of any weapons. No\r\nnewspaper in America is really powerful or popular; and yet they are\r\ntyrannical and overbearing. The \"New York Herald\" has, I believe, the\r\nlargest sale of any daily newspaper; but it is absolutely without\r\npolitical power, and in these times of war has truckled to the\r\nGovernment more basely than any other paper. It has an enormous sale,\r\nbut so far is it from having achieved popularity, that no man on any\r\nside ever speaks a good word for it. All American newspapers deal in\r\npolitics as a matter of course; but their politics have ever regard\r\nto men and never to measures. Vituperation is their natural political\r\nweapon; but since the President's ministers have assumed the power\r\nof stopping newspapers which are offensive to them, they have shown\r\nthat they can descend to a course of eulogy which is even below\r\nvituperation.\r\n\r\nI shall be accused of using very strong language against the\r\nnewspaper press of America. I can only say that I do not know how to\r\nmake that language too strong. Of course there are newspapers as to\r\nwhich the editors and writers may justly feel that my remarks, if\r\napplied to them, are unmerited. In writing on such a subject, I can\r\nonly deal with the whole as a whole. During my stay in the country,\r\nI did my best to make myself acquainted with the nature of its\r\nnewspapers, knowing in how great a degree its population depends on\r\nthem for its daily store of information. Newspapers in the States of\r\nAmerica have a much wider, or rather closer circulation, than they\r\ndo with us. Every man and almost every woman sees a newspaper daily.\r\nThey are very cheap, and are brought to every man's hand without\r\ntrouble to himself, at every turn that he takes in his day's work. It\r\nwould be much for the advantage of the country, that they should be\r\ngood of their kind; but, if I am able to form a correct judgment on\r\nthe matter, they are not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the earlier chapters of this volume,--now some seven or\r\neight chapters past,--I brought myself on my travels back to Boston.\r\nIt was not that my way homewards lay by that route, seeing that my\r\nfate required me to sail from New York; but I could not leave the\r\ncountry without revisiting my friends in Massachusetts. I have told\r\nhow I was there in the sleighing time, and how pleasant were the\r\nmingled slush and frost of the snowy winter. In the morning the\r\nstreets would be hard and crisp, and the stranger would surely fall\r\nif he were not prepared to walk on glaciers. In the afternoon he\r\nwould be wading through rivers,--and if properly armed at all points\r\nwith india-rubber, would enjoy the rivers as he waded. But the air\r\nwould be always kindly, and the east wind there, if it was east as\r\nI was told, had none of that power of dominion which makes us all so\r\nsubmissive to its behests in London. For myself, I believe that the\r\nreal east wind blows only in London.\r\n\r\nAnd when the snow went in Boston I went with it. The evening before\r\nI left I watched them as they carted away the dirty uncouth blocks\r\nwhich had been broken up with pickaxes in Washington Street, and was\r\nmelancholy as I reflected that I too should no longer be known in the\r\nstreets. My weeks in Boston had not been very many, but nevertheless\r\nthere were haunts there which I knew as though my feet had trodden\r\nthem for years. There were houses to which I could have gone with\r\nmy eyes blindfold; doors of which the latches were familiar to my\r\nhands; faces which I knew so well that they had ceased to put on\r\nfor me the fictitious smiles of courtesy. Faces, houses, doors, and\r\nhaunts, where are they now? For me they are as though they had never\r\nbeen. They are among the things which one would fain remember as\r\none remembers a dream. Look back on it as a vision and it is all\r\npleasant. But if you realize your vision and believe your dream to be\r\na fact, all your pleasure is obliterated by regret.\r\n\r\nI know that I shall never again be at Boston, and that I have said\r\nthat about the Americans which would make me unwelcome as a guest if\r\nI were there. It is in this that my regret consists;--for this reason\r\nthat I would wish to remember so many social hours as though they had\r\nbeen passed in sleep. They who will expect blessings from me, will\r\nsay among themselves that I have cursed them. As I read the pages\r\nwhich I have written I feel that words which I intended for blessings\r\nwhen I prepared to utter them have gone nigh to turn themselves into\r\ncurses.\r\n\r\nI have ever admired the United States as a nation. I have loved their\r\nliberty, their prowess, their intelligence, and their progress. I\r\nhave sympathized with a people who themselves have had no sympathy\r\nwith passive security and inaction. I have felt confidence in them,\r\nand have known, as it were, that their industry must enable them to\r\nsucceed as a people, while their freedom would insure to them success\r\nas a nation. With these convictions I went among them wishing to\r\nwrite of them good words,--words which might be pleasant for them to\r\nread, while they might assist perhaps in producing a true impression\r\nof them here at home. But among my good words there are so many which\r\nare bitter, that I fear I shall have failed in my object as regards\r\nthem. And it seems to me, as I read once more my own pages, that in\r\nsaying evil things of my friends, I have used language stronger than\r\nI intended; whereas I have omitted to express myself with emphasis\r\nwhen I have attempted to say good things. Why need I have told of the\r\nmud of Washington, or have exposed the nakedness of Cairo? Why did\r\nI speak with such eager enmity of those poor women in the New York\r\ncars, who never injured me, now that I think of it? Ladies of New\r\nYork, as I write this, the words which were written among you, are\r\nprinted and cannot be expunged; but I tender to you my apologies from\r\nmy home in England. And as to that Van Wyck committee! Might I not\r\nhave left those contractors to be dealt with by their own Congress,\r\nseeing that that Congress committee was by no means inclined to spare\r\nthem? I might have kept my pages free from gall, and have sent my\r\nsheets to the press unhurt by the conviction that I was hurting those\r\nwho had dealt kindly by me! But what then? Was any people ever truly\r\nserved by eulogy; or an honest cause furthered by undue praise?\r\n\r\nO my friends with thin skins,--and here I protest that a thick skin\r\nis a fault not to be forgiven in a man or a nation, whereas a thin\r\nskin is in itself a merit, if only the wearer of it will be the\r\nmaster and not the slave of his skin,--O, my friends with thin skins,\r\nye whom I call my cousins and love as brethren, will ye not forgive\r\nme these harsh words that I have spoken? They have been spoken in\r\nlove,--with a true love, a brotherly love, a love that has never been\r\nabsent from the heart while the brain was coining them. I had my task\r\nto do, and I could not take the pleasant and ignore the painful. It\r\nmay perhaps be that as a friend I had better not have written either\r\ngood or bad. But no! To say that would indeed be to speak calumny of\r\nyour country. A man may write of you truly, and yet write that which\r\nyou would read with pleasure;--only that your skins are so thin!\r\nThe streets of Washington are muddy and her ways are desolate. The\r\nnakedness of Cairo is very naked. And those ladies of New York--is\r\nit not to be confessed that they are somewhat imperious in their\r\ndemands? As for the Van Wyck committee, have I not repeated the tale\r\nwhich you have told yourselves? And is it not well that such tales\r\nshould be told?\r\n\r\nAnd yet ye will not forgive me; because your skins are thin, and\r\nbecause the praise of others is the breath of your nostrils.\r\n\r\nI do not know that an American as an individual is more thin-skinned\r\nthan an Englishman; but as the representative of a nation it may\r\nalmost be said of him that he has no skin at all. Any touch comes\r\nat once upon the net-work of his nerves and puts in operation all\r\nhis organs of feeling with the violence of a blow. And for this\r\npeculiarity he has been made the mark of much ridicule. It shows\r\nitself in two ways; either by extreme displeasure when anything is\r\nsaid disrespectful of his country; or by the strong eulogy with which\r\nhe is accustomed to speak of his own institutions and of those of his\r\ncountrymen whom at the moment he may chance to hold in high esteem.\r\nThe manner in which this is done is often ridiculous. \"Sir, what\r\ndo you think of our Mr. Jefferson Brick? Mr. Jefferson Brick,\r\nsir, is one of our most remarkable men.\" And again. \"Do you like\r\nour institutions, sir? Do you find that philanthropy, religion,\r\nphilosophy, and the social virtues are cultivated on a scale\r\ncommensurate with the unequalled liberty and political advancement of\r\nthe nation?\" There is something absurd in such a mode of address when\r\nit is repeated often. But hero-worship and love of country are not\r\nabsurd; and do not these addresses show capacity for hero-worship\r\nand an aptitude for the love of country? Jefferson Brick may not be\r\na hero; but a capacity for such worship is something. Indeed the\r\ncapacity is everything, for the need of a hero will at last produce\r\nthe hero needed. And it is the same with that love of country.\r\nA people that are proud of their country will see that there is\r\nsomething in their country to justify their pride. Do we not all of\r\nus feel assured by the intense nationality of an American that he\r\nwill not desert his nation in the hour of her need? I feel that\r\nassurance respecting them; and at those moments in which I am moved\r\nto laughter by the absurdities of their addresses, I feel it the\r\nstrongest.\r\n\r\nI left Boston with the snow, and returning to New York found that\r\nthe streets there were dry and that the winter was nearly over. As\r\nI had passed through New York to Boston the streets had been by no\r\nmeans dry. The snow had lain in small mountains over which the\r\nomnibuses made their way down Broadway, till at the bottom of that\r\nthoroughfare, between Trinity Church and Bowling Green, alp became\r\npiled upon alp, and all traffic was full of danger. The accursed love\r\nof gain still took men to Wall Street, but they had to fight their\r\nway thither through physical difficulties which must have made even\r\nthe state of the money market a matter almost of indifference to\r\nthem. They do not seem to me to manage the winter in New York so well\r\nas they do in Boston. But now, on my last return thither, the alps\r\nwere gone, the roads were clear, and one could travel through the\r\ncity with no other impediment than those of treading on women's\r\ndresses if one walked, or having to look after women's band-boxes and\r\npay their fares and take their change, if one used the omnibuses.\r\n\r\nAnd now had come the end of my adventures, and as I set my foot\r\nonce more upon the deck of the Cunard steamer I felt that my work\r\nwas done. Whether it were done ill or well, or whether indeed any\r\napproach to the doing of it had been attained, all had been done that\r\nI could accomplish. No further opportunity remained to me of seeing,\r\nhearing, or of speaking. I had come out thither, having resolved to\r\nlearn a little that I might if possible teach that little to others;\r\nand now the lesson was learned, or must remain unlearned. But in\r\ncarrying out my resolution I had gradually risen in my ambition, and\r\nhad mounted from one stage of inquiry to another, till at last I had\r\nfound myself burdened with the task of ascertaining whether or no the\r\nAmericans were doing their work as a nation well or ill; and now, if\r\never, I must be prepared to put forth the result of my inquiry. As I\r\nwalked up and down the deck of the steamboat I confess I felt that I\r\nhad been somewhat arrogant.\r\n\r\nI had been a few days over six months in the States, and I was\r\nengaged in writing a book of such a nature that a man might well\r\nengage himself for six years, or perhaps for sixty, in obtaining the\r\nmaterials for it. There was nothing in the form of government, or\r\nlegislature, or manners of the people, as to which I had not taken\r\nupon myself to say something. I was professing to understand their\r\nstrength and their weakness; and was daring to censure their faults\r\nand to eulogize their virtues. \"Who is he,\" an American would say,\r\n\"that he comes and judges us? His judgment is nothing.\" \"Who is he,\"\r\nan Englishman would say, \"that he comes and teaches us? His teaching\r\nis of no value.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this I have but a small plea to make. I have done\r\nmy best. I have nothing \"extenuated, and have set down nought in\r\nmalice.\" I do feel that my volumes have blown themselves out into\r\nproportions greater than I had intended;--greater not in mass of\r\npages, but in the matter handled. I am frequently addressing my own\r\nmuse, who I am well aware is not Clio, and asking her whither she\r\nis wending. \"Cease, thou wrong-headed one, to meddle with these\r\nmysteries.\" I appeal to her frequently, but ever in vain. One cannot\r\ndrive one's muse, nor yet always lead her. Of the various women with\r\nwhich a man is blessed, his muse is by no means the least difficult\r\nto manage.\r\n\r\nBut again I put in my slight plea. In doing as I have done, I have\r\nat least done my best. I have endeavoured to judge without prejudice,\r\nand to hear with honest ears, and to see with honest eyes. The\r\nsubject, moreover, on which I have written, is one which, though\r\ngreat, is so universal in its bearings, that it may be said to admit\r\nof being handled without impropriety by the unlearned as well as the\r\nlearned;--by those who have grown gray in the study of constitutional\r\nlore, and by those who have simply looked on at the government of men\r\nas we all look on at those matters which daily surround us. There are\r\nmatters as to which a man should never take a pen in hand unless he\r\nhas given to them much labour. The botanist must have learned to\r\ntrace the herbs and flowers before he can presume to tell us how God\r\nhas formed them. But the death of Hector is a fit subject for a boy's\r\nverses though Homer also sang of it. I feel that there is scope for a\r\nbook on the United States' form of government as it was founded, and\r\nas it has since framed itself, which might do honour to the life-long\r\nstudies of some one of those great constitutional pundits whom we\r\nhave among us; but, nevertheless, the plain words of a man who is no\r\npundit need not disgrace the subject, if they be honestly written,\r\nand if he who writes them has in his heart an honest love of liberty.\r\nSuch were my thoughts as I walked the deck of the Cunard steamer.\r\nThen I descended to my cabin, settled my luggage, and prepared\r\nfor the continuance of my work. It was fourteen days from that\r\ntime before I reached London, but the fourteen days to me were not\r\nunpleasant. The demon of sea-sickness usually spares me, and if I can\r\nfind on board one or two who are equally fortunate--who can eat with\r\nme, drink with me, and talk with me--I do not know that a passage\r\nacross the Atlantic is by any means a terrible evil.\r\n\r\nIn finishing these volumes after the fashion in which they have been\r\nwritten throughout, I feel that I am bound to express a final opinion\r\non two or three points, and that if I have not enabled myself to\r\ndo so, I have travelled through the country in vain. I am bound by\r\nthe very nature of my undertaking to say whether, according to such\r\nview as I have enabled myself to take of them, the Americans have\r\nsucceeded as a nation politically and socially; and in doing this I\r\nought to be able to explain how far slavery has interfered with such\r\nsuccess. I am bound also, writing at the present moment, to express\r\nsome opinion as to the result of this war, and to declare whether the\r\nNorth or the South may be expected to be victorious,--explaining in\r\nsome rough way what may be the results of such victory, and how such\r\nresults will affect the question of slavery. And I shall leave my\r\ntask unfinished if I do not say what may be the possible chances of\r\nfuture quarrel between England and the States. That there has been\r\nand is much hot blood and angry feeling no man doubts; but such angry\r\nfeeling has existed among many nations without any probability of\r\nwar. In this case, with reference to this ill-will that has certainly\r\nestablished itself between us and that other people, is there any\r\nneed that it should be satisfied by war and allayed by blood?\r\n\r\nNo one, I think, can doubt that the founders of the great American\r\nCommonwealth made an error in omitting to provide some means for the\r\ngradual extinction of slavery throughout the States. That error did\r\nnot consist in any liking for slavery. There was no feeling in favour\r\nof slavery on the part of those who made themselves prominent at the\r\npolitical birth of the nation. I think I shall be justified in saying\r\nthat at that time the opinion that slavery is itself a good thing,\r\nthat it is an institution of divine origin and fit to be perpetuated\r\namong men as in itself excellent, had not found that favour in the\r\nsouthern States in which it is now held. Jefferson, who has been\r\nregarded as the leader of the southern or democratic party, has\r\nleft ample testimony that he regarded slavery as an evil. It is, I\r\nthink, true that he gave such testimony much more freely when he was\r\nspeaking or writing as a private individual than he ever allowed\r\nhimself to do when his words were armed with the weight of public\r\nauthority. But it is clear that, on the whole, he was opposed to\r\nslavery, and I think there can be little doubt that he and his party\r\nlooked forward to a natural death for that evil. Calculation was made\r\nthat slavery when not recruited afresh from Africa could not maintain\r\nits numbers, and that gradually the negro population would become\r\nextinct. This was the error made. It was easier to look forward\r\nto such a result and hope for such an end of the difficulty, than\r\nto extinguish slavery by a great political movement, which must\r\ndoubtless have been difficult and costly. The northern States got\r\nrid of slavery by the operation of their separate legislatures, some\r\nat one date and some at others. The slaves were less numerous in\r\nthe North than in the South, and the feeling adverse to slaves was\r\nstronger in the North than in the South. Mason and Dixon's line,\r\nwhich now separates slave soil from free soil, merely indicates the\r\nposition in the country at which the balance turned. Maryland and\r\nVirginia were not inclined to make great immediate sacrifices for the\r\nmanumission of their slaves; but the gentlemen of those States did\r\nnot think that slavery was a divine institution, destined to flourish\r\nfor ever as a blessing in their land.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of slavery was, I think, a political mistake;--a\r\npolitical mistake, not because slavery is politically wrong, but\r\nbecause the politicians of the day made erroneous calculations as\r\nto the probability of its termination. So the income tax may be a\r\npolitical blunder with us;--not because it is in itself a bad tax,\r\nbut because those who imposed it conceived that they were imposing it\r\nfor a year or two, whereas, now, men do not expect to see the end of\r\nit. The maintenance of slavery was a political mistake; and I cannot\r\nthink that the Americans in any way lessen the weight of their own\r\nerror by protesting, as they occasionally do, that slavery was a\r\nlegacy made over to them from England. They might as well say, that\r\ntravelling in carts without springs, at the rate of three miles an\r\nhour, was a legacy made over to them by England. On that matter of\r\ntravelling they have not been contented with the old habits left\r\nto them, but have gone ahead and made railroads. In creating those\r\nrailways the merit is due to them; and so also is the demerit of\r\nmaintaining those slaves.\r\n\r\nThat demerit and that mistake have doubtless brought upon the\r\nAmericans the grievances of their present position; and will, as I\r\nthink, so far be accompanied by ultimate punishment that they will\r\nbe the immediate means of causing the first disintegration of their\r\nnation. I will leave it to the Americans themselves to say, whether\r\nsuch disintegration must necessarily imply that they have failed in\r\ntheir political undertaking. The most loyal citizens of the northern\r\nStates would have declared a month or two since,--and for aught\r\nI know would declare now,--that any disintegration of the States\r\nimplied absolute failure. One stripe erased from the banner, one star\r\nlost from the firmament, would entail upon them all the disgrace\r\nof national defeat! It had been their boast that they would always\r\nadvance, never retreat. They had looked forward to add ever State\r\nupon State, and territory to territory, till the whole continent\r\nshould be bound together in the same union. To go back from that now,\r\nto fall into pieces and be divided, to become smaller in the eyes\r\nof the nations,--to be absolutely halfed, as some would say of such\r\ndivision, would be national disgrace, and would amount to political\r\nfailure. \"Let us fight for the whole,\" such men said, and probably do\r\nsay. \"To lose anything is to lose all!\"\r\n\r\nBut the citizens of the States who speak and think thus, though they\r\nmay be the most loyal, are perhaps not politically the most wise. And\r\nI am inclined to think that that defiant claim of every star, that\r\nresolve to possess every stripe upon the banner, had become somewhat\r\nless general when I was leaving the country than I had found it to be\r\nat the time of my arrival there. While things were going badly with\r\nthe North,--while there was no tale of any battle to be told except\r\nof those at Bull's Run and Springfield, no northern man would admit\r\na hint that secession might ultimately prevail in Georgia or Alabama.\r\nBut the rebels had been driven out of Missouri when I was leaving\r\nthe States, they had retreated altogether from Kentucky, having\r\nbeen beaten in one engagement there, and from a great portion of\r\nTennessee, having been twice beaten in that State. The coast of North\r\nCarolina, and many points of the southern coast, were in the hands of\r\nthe northern army, while the army of the South was retreating from\r\nall points into the centre of their country. Whatever may have been\r\nthe strategetical merits or demerits of the northern generals, it\r\nis at any rate certain that their apparent successes were greedily\r\nwelcomed by the people, and created an idea that things were going\r\nwell with the cause. And, as all this took place, it seemed to me\r\nthat I heard less about the necessary integrity of the old flag.\r\nWhile as yet they were altogether unsuccessful, they were minded to\r\nmake no surrender. But with their successes came the feeling, that in\r\ntaking much they might perhaps allow themselves to yield something.\r\nThis was clearly indicated by the message sent to Congress by the\r\nPresident in February, 1862, in which he suggested that Congress\r\nshould make arrangements for the purchase of the slaves in the border\r\nStates; so that in the event of secession--accomplished secession--in\r\nthe gulf States, the course of those border States might be made\r\nclear for them. They might hesitate as to going willingly with the\r\nNorth, while possessing slaves,--as to setting themselves peaceably\r\ndown as a small slave adjunct to a vast free soil nation, seeing that\r\ntheir property would always be in peril. Under such circumstances\r\na slave adjunct to the free soil nation would not long be possible.\r\nBut if it could be shown to them that in the event of their adhering\r\nto the North, compensation would be forthcoming, then, indeed,\r\nthe difficulty in arranging an advantageous line between the two\r\nfuture nations might be considerably modified. This message of the\r\nPresident's was intended to signify, that secession on favourable\r\nterms might be regarded by the North as not undesirable. Moderate men\r\nwere beginning to whisper that, after all, the gulf States were no\r\nsource either of national wealth or of national honour. Had there not\r\nbeen enough at Washington of cotton lords and cotton laws? When I\r\nhave suggested that no senator from Georgia would ever again sit in\r\nthe United States senate, American gentlemen have received my remark\r\nwith a slight demur, and have then proceeded to argue the case. Six\r\nmonths before they would have declaimed against me and not have\r\nargued.\r\n\r\nI will leave it to Americans themselves to say whether that\r\ndisintegration of the States, should it ever be realized, will imply\r\nthat they have failed in their political undertaking. If they do not\r\nprotest that it argues failure, their feelings will not be hurt by\r\nany such protestations on the part of others. I have said that the\r\nblunder made by the founders of the nation with regard to slavery\r\nhas brought with it this secession as its punishment. But such\r\npunishments come generally upon nations as great mercies. Ireland's\r\nfamine was the punishment of her imprudence and idleness, but it has\r\ngiven to her prosperity and progress. And indeed, to speak with more\r\nlogical correctness, the famine was no punishment to Ireland, nor\r\nwill secession be a punishment to the northern States. In the long\r\nresult step will have gone on after step, and effect will have\r\nfollowed cause, till the American people will at last acknowledge,\r\nthat all these matters have been arranged for their advantage and\r\npromotion. It may be that a nation now and then goes to the wall, and\r\nthat things go from bad to worse with a large people. It has been so\r\nwith various nations and with many people since history was first\r\nwritten. But when it has been so, the people thus punished have been\r\nidle and bad. They have not only done evil in their generation, but\r\nhave done more evil than good, and have contributed their power to\r\nthe injury rather than to the improvement of mankind. It may be that\r\nthis or that national fault may produce or seem to produce some\r\nconsequent calamity. But the balance of good or evil things which\r\nfall to a people's share will indicate with certainty their average\r\nconduct as a nation. The one will be the certain consequence of the\r\nother. If it be that the Americans of the northern States have done\r\nwell in their time, that they have assisted in the progress of the\r\nworld, and made things better for mankind rather than worse, then\r\nthey will come out of this trouble without eventual injury. That\r\nwhich came in the guise of punishment for a special fault, will be a\r\npart of the reward resulting from good conduct in the general. And as\r\nto this matter of slavery, in which I think that they have blundered\r\nboth politically and morally,--has it not been found impossible\r\nhitherto for them to cleanse their hands of that taint? But that\r\nwhich they could not do for themselves the course of events is doing\r\nfor them. If secession establish herself, though it be only secession\r\nof the gulf States, the people of the United States will soon be free\r\nfrom slavery.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the success or want of success of any political\r\ninstitutions or of any form of government, we should be guided, I\r\nthink, by the general results, and not by any abstract rules as to\r\nthe right or wrong of those institutions or of that form. It might\r\nbe easy for a German lawyer to show that our system of trial by jury\r\nis open to the gravest objections, and that it sins against common\r\nsense. But if that system gives us substantial justice, and protects\r\nus from the tyranny of men in office, the German lawyer will not\r\nsucceed in making us believe that it is a bad system. When looking\r\ninto the matter of the schools at Boston, I observed to one of\r\nthe committee of management that the statements with which I was\r\nsupplied, though they told me how many of the children went to\r\nschool, did not tell me how long they remained at school. The\r\ngentleman replied that that information was to be obtained from the\r\nresult of the schooling of the population generally. Every boy and\r\ngirl around us could read and write, and could enjoy reading and\r\nwriting. There was therefore evidence to show that they remained at\r\nschool sufficiently long for the required purposes. It was fair that\r\nI should judge of the system from the results. Here in England, we\r\ngenerally object to much that the Americans have adopted into their\r\nform of government, and think that many of their political theories\r\nare wrong. We do not like universal suffrage. We do not like a\r\nperiodical change in the first magistrate; and we like quite as\r\nlittle a periodical permanence in the political officers immediately\r\nunder the chief magistrate. We are, in short, wedded to our own forms\r\nand therefore opposed by judgment to forms differing from our own.\r\nBut I think we all acknowledge that the United States, burdened as\r\nthey are with these political evils,--as we think them, have grown in\r\nstrength and material prosperity with a celerity of growth hitherto\r\nunknown among nations. We may dislike Americans personally, we may\r\nfind ourselves uncomfortable when there, and unable to sympathize\r\nwith them when away; we may believe them to be ambitious, unjust,\r\nself-idolatrous, or irreligious. But, unless we throw our judgment\r\naltogether overboard, we cannot believe them to be a weak people, a\r\npoor people, a people with low spirits or a people with idle hands.\r\nTo what is it that the government of a country should chiefly look?\r\nWhat special advantages do we expect from our own government? Is it\r\nnot that we should be safe at home and respected abroad;--that laws\r\nshould be maintained, but that they should be so maintained that\r\nthey should not be oppressive? There are, doubtless, countries in\r\nwhich the government professes to do much more than this for its\r\npeople,--countries in which the government is paternal; in which it\r\nregulates the religion of the people, and professes to enforce on all\r\nthe national children respect for the governors, teachers, spiritual\r\npastors, and masters. But that is not our idea of a government.\r\nThat is not what we desire to see established among ourselves or\r\nestablished among others. Safety from foreign foes, respect from\r\nforeign foes and friends, security under the law and security from\r\nthe law,--this is what we expect from our government; and if I add to\r\nthis that we expect to have these good things provided at a fairly\r\nmoderate cost, I think I have exhausted the list of our requirements.\r\n\r\nAnd if the Americans with their form of government have done for\r\nthemselves all that we expect our government to do for us; if they\r\nhave with some fair approach to general excellence obtained respect\r\nabroad and security at home from foreign foes; if they have made\r\nlife, liberty, and property safe under their laws, and have also so\r\nwritten and executed their laws as to secure their people from legal\r\noppression,--I maintain that they are entitled to a verdict in their\r\nfavour, let us object as we may to universal suffrage, to four years'\r\nPresidents, and four years' presidential cabinets. What, after all,\r\nmatters the theory or the system, whether it be King or President,\r\nuniversal suffrage or ten-pound voter, so long as the people be free\r\nand prosperous? King and President, suffrage by poll and suffrage by\r\nproperty, are but the means. If the end be there, if the thing has\r\nbeen done, King and President, open suffrage and close suffrage may\r\nalike be declared to have been successful. The Americans have been\r\nin existence as a nation for seventy-five years, and have achieved\r\nan amount of foreign respect during that period greater than any\r\nother nation ever obtained in double the time. And this has been\r\ngiven to them, not in deference to the statesman-like craft of\r\ntheir diplomatic and other officers, but on grounds the very\r\nopposite of those. It has been given to them because they form a\r\nnumerous, wealthy, brave, and self-asserting nation. It is, I think,\r\nunnecessary to prove that such foreign respect has been given to\r\nthem: but were it necessary, nothing would prove it more strongly\r\nthan the regard which has been universally paid by European\r\ngovernments to the blockade placed during this war on the southern\r\nports by the government of the United States. Had the United States\r\nbeen placed by general consent in any class of nations below the\r\nfirst, England, France, and perhaps Russia would have taken the\r\nmatter into their own hands, and have settled for the States, either\r\nunited or disunited, at any rate that question of the blockade. And\r\nthe Americans have been safe at home from foreign foes; so safe,\r\nthat no other strong people but ourselves have enjoyed anything\r\napproaching to their security since their foundation. Nor has our\r\nsecurity been equal to theirs if we are to count our nationality\r\nas extending beyond the British Isles. Then as to security under\r\ntheir laws and from their laws! Those laws and the system of their\r\nmanagement have been taken almost entirely from us, and have so been\r\nadministered that life and property have been safe, and the subject\r\nalso has been free from oppression. I think that this may be taken\r\nfor granted, seeing that they who have been most opposed to American\r\nforms of government, have never asserted the reverse. I may be told\r\nof a man being lynched in one State, or tarred and feathered in\r\nanother, or of a duel in a third being \"fought at sight.\" So I may be\r\ntold also of men garotted in London, and of tithe proctors buried in\r\na bog without their ears in Ireland. Neither will seventy years of\r\ncontinuance nor will seven hundred secure such an observance of laws\r\nas will prevent temporary ebullition of popular feeling, or save a\r\npeople from the chance disgrace of occasional outrage. Taking the\r\ngeneral, life and limb and property have been as safe in the States\r\nas in other civilized countries with which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nAs to their personal liberty under their laws, I know it will be said\r\nthat they have surrendered all claim to any such precious possession\r\nby the facility with which they have now surrendered the privilege of\r\nthe writ of habeas corpus. It has been taken from them, as I have\r\nendeavoured to show, illegally, and they have submitted to the loss\r\nand to the illegality without a murmur! But in such a matter I do\r\nnot think it fair to judge them by their conduct in such a moment as\r\nthe present. That this is the very moment in which to judge of the\r\nefficiency of their institutions generally, of the aptitude of those\r\ninstitutions for the security of the nation, I readily acknowledge.\r\nBut when a ship is at sea in a storm, riding out all that the winds\r\nand waves can do to her, one does not condemn her because a yard-arm\r\ngives way, nor even though the mainmast should go by the board. If\r\nshe can make her port, saving life and cargo, she is a good ship, let\r\nher losses in spars and rigging be what they may. In this affair of\r\nthe habeas corpus we will wait a while before we come to any final\r\njudgment. If it be that the people, when the war is over, shall\r\nconsent to live under a military or other dictatorship,--that they\r\nshall quietly continue their course as a nation without recovery\r\nof their rights of freedom, then we shall have to say that their\r\ninstitutions were not founded in a soil of sufficient depth, and that\r\nthey gave way before the first high wind that blew on them. I myself\r\ndo not expect such a result.\r\n\r\nI think we must admit that the Americans have received from their\r\ngovernment, or rather from their system of policy, that aid and\r\nfurtherance which they required from it; and, moreover, such aid and\r\nfurtherance as we expect from our system of government. We must admit\r\nthat they have been great, and free, and prosperous, as we also have\r\nbecome. And we must admit, also, that in some matters they have gone\r\nforward in advance of us. They have educated their people, as we\r\nhave not educated ours. They have given to their millions a personal\r\nrespect, and a standing above the abjectness of poverty, which with\r\nus are much less general than with them. These things, I grant, have\r\nnot come of their government, and have not been produced by their\r\nwritten constitution. They are the happy results of their happy\r\ncircumstances. But so, also, those evil attributes which we sometimes\r\nassign to them are not the creatures of their government, or of their\r\nconstitution. We acknowledge them to be well educated, intelligent,\r\nphilanthropic, and industrious; but we say that they are ambitious,\r\nunjust, self-idolatrous, and irreligious. If so, let us at any rate\r\nbalance the virtues against the vices. As to their ambition, it is a\r\nvice that leans so to virtue's side, that it hardly needs an apology.\r\nAs to their injustice, or rather dishonesty, I have said what I have\r\nto say on that matter. I am not going to flinch from the accusation\r\nI have brought, though I am aware that in bringing it I have thrown\r\naway any hope that I might have had of carrying with me the good will\r\nof the Americans for my book. The love of money,--or rather of making\r\nmoney,--carried to an extreme, has lessened that instinctive respect\r\nfor the rights of meum and tuum which all men feel more or less, and\r\nwhich, when encouraged within the human breast, finds its result in\r\nperfect honesty. Other nations, of which I will not now stop to name\r\neven one, have had their periods of natural dishonesty. It may be\r\nthat others are even now to be placed in the same category. But it\r\nis a fault which industry and intelligence combined will after a\r\nwhile serve to lessen and to banish. The industrious man desires to\r\nkeep the fruit of his own industry, and the intelligent man will\r\nultimately be able to do so. That the Americans are self-idolaters is\r\nperhaps true,--with a difference. An American desires you to worship\r\nhis country, or his brother; but he does not often, by any of the\r\nusual signs of conceit, call upon you to worship himself. As an\r\nAmerican, treating of America, he is self-idolatrous; but that\r\nis a self-idolatry which I can endure. Then, as to his want of\r\nreligion--and it is a very sad want--I can only say of him, that\r\nI, as an Englishman, do not feel myself justified in flinging the\r\nfirst stone at him. In that matter of religion, as in the matter of\r\neducation, the American, I think, stands on a level higher than ours.\r\nThere is not in the States so absolute an ignorance of religion as\r\nis to be found in some of our manufacturing and mining districts,\r\nand also, alas! in some of our agricultural districts; but also, I\r\nthink, there is less of respect and veneration for God's word among\r\ntheir educated classes, than there is with us; and, perhaps, also\r\nless knowledge as to God's word. The general religious level is, I\r\nthink, higher with them; but there is with us, if I am right in my\r\nsupposition, a higher eminence in religion, as there is also a deeper\r\ndepth of ungodliness.\r\n\r\nI think then that we are bound to acknowledge that the Americans\r\nhave succeeded as a nation, politically and socially. When I speak\r\nof social success, I do not mean to say that their manners are\r\ncorrect according to this or that standard. I will not say that they\r\nare correct, or are not correct. In that matter of manners I have\r\nfound that those, with whom it seemed to me natural that I should\r\nassociate, were very pleasant according to my standard. I do not\r\nknow that I am a good critic on such a subject, or that I have ever\r\nthought much of it with the view of criticising. I have been happy\r\nand comfortable with them, and for me that has been sufficient. In\r\nspeaking of social success I allude to their success in private\r\nlife as distinguished from that which they have achieved in public\r\nlife;--to their successes in commerce, in mechanics, in the comforts\r\nand luxuries of life, in medicine and all that leads to the solace of\r\naffliction, in literature, and I may add also, considering the youth\r\nof the nation, in the arts. We are, I think, bound to acknowledge\r\nthat they have succeeded. And if they have succeeded, it is vain for\r\nus to say that a system is wrong which has, at any rate, admitted of\r\nsuch success. That which was wanted from some form of government, has\r\nbeen obtained with much more than average excellence; and therefore\r\nthe form adopted has approved itself as good. You may explain to a\r\nfarmer's wife with indisputable logic, that her churn is a bad churn;\r\nbut as long as she turns out butter in greater quantity, in better\r\nquality, and with more profit than her neighbours, you will hardly\r\ninduce her to change it. It may be that with some other churn she\r\nmight have done even better; but, under such circumstances, she will\r\nhave a right to think well of the churn she uses.\r\n\r\nThe American constitution is now, I think, at the crisis of its\r\nseverest trial. I conceive it to be by no means perfect, even for\r\nthe wants of the people who use it; and I have already endeavoured\r\nto explain what changes it seems to need. And it has had this\r\ndefect,--that it has permitted a falling away from its intended\r\nmodes of action, while its letter has been kept sacred. As I have\r\nendeavoured to show, universal suffrage and democratic action in the\r\nSenate were not intended by the framers of the constitution. In this\r\nrespect, the constitution has, as it were, fallen through, and it is\r\nneeded that its very beams should be re-strengthened. There are also\r\nother matters as to which it seems that some change is indispensable.\r\nSo much I have admitted. But, not the less, judging of it by the\r\nentirety of the work that it has done, I think that we are bound to\r\nown that it has been successful.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with regard to this tedious war, of which from day to day we\r\nare still, in this month of May, 1862, hearing details which teach us\r\nto think that it can hardly as yet be near its end;--to what may we\r\nrationally look as its result? Of one thing I myself feel tolerably\r\ncertain,--that its result will not be nothing, as some among us\r\nhave seemed to suppose may be probable. I cannot believe that all\r\nthis energy on the part of the North will be of no avail, more\r\nthan I suppose that southern perseverance will be of no avail.\r\nThere are those among us who say that as secession will at last be\r\naccomplished, the North should have yielded to the South at once, and\r\nthat nothing will be gained by their great expenditure of life and\r\ntreasure. I can by no means bring myself to agree with these. I also\r\nlook to the establishment of secession. Seeing how essential and\r\nthorough are the points of variance between the North and the South,\r\nhow unlike the one people is to the other, and how necessary it is\r\nthat their policies should be different; seeing how deep are their\r\nantipathies, and how fixed is each side in the belief of its own\r\nrectitude and in the belief also of the other's political baseness,\r\nI cannot believe that the really southern States will ever again be\r\njoined in amicable union with those of the North. They, the States of\r\nthe Gulf, may be utterly subjugated, and the North may hold over them\r\nmilitary power. Georgia and her sisters may for a while belong to\r\nthe Union, as one conquered country belongs to another. But I do not\r\nthink that they will ever act with the Union;--and, as I imagine,\r\nthe Union before long will agree to a separation. I do not mean\r\nto prophesy that the result will be thus accomplished. It may be\r\nthat the South will effect their own independence before they lay\r\ndown their arms. I think, however, that we may look forward to such\r\nindependence, whether it be achieved in that way, or in this, or in\r\nsome other.\r\n\r\nBut not on that account will the war have been of no avail to the\r\nNorth. I think it must be already evident to all those who have\r\nlooked into the matter that had the North yielded to the first call\r\nmade by the South for secession all the slave States must have gone.\r\nMaryland would have gone, carrying Delaware in its arms; and if\r\nMaryland, all south of Maryland. If Maryland had gone, the capital\r\nwould have gone. If the Government had resolved to yield, Virginia to\r\nthe east would assuredly have gone, and I think there can be no doubt\r\nthat Missouri, to the west, would have gone also. The feeling for\r\nthe Union in Kentucky was very strong, but I do not think that even\r\nKentucky could have saved itself. To have yielded to the southern\r\ndemands would have been to have yielded everything. But no man now\r\nbelieves, let the contest go as it will, that Maryland and Delaware\r\nwill go with the South. The secessionists of Baltimore do not think\r\nso, nor the gentlemen and ladies of Washington, whose whole hearts\r\nare in the southern cause. No man thinks that Maryland will go; and\r\nfew, I believe, imagine that either Missouri or Kentucky will be\r\ndivided from the North. I will not pretend what may be the exact\r\nline, but I myself feel confident that it will run south both of\r\nVirginia and of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIf the North do conquer the South, and so arrange their matters that\r\nthe southern States shall again become members of the Union, it will\r\nbe admitted that they have done all that they sought to do. If they\r\ndo not do this;--if instead of doing this, which would be all that\r\nthey desire, they were in truth to do nothing;--to win finally not\r\none foot of ground from the South,--a supposition which I regard as\r\nimpossible;--I think that we should still admit after a while that\r\nthey had done their duty in endeavouring to maintain the integrity of\r\nthe empire. But if, as a third and more probable alternative, they\r\nsucceed in rescuing from the South and from slavery four or five of\r\nthe finest States of the old Union,--a vast portion of the continent,\r\nto be beaten by none other in salubrity, fertility, beauty, and\r\npolitical importance,--will it not then be admitted that the war has\r\ndone some good, and that the life and treasure have not been spent in\r\nvain?\r\n\r\nThat is the termination of the contest to which I look forward. I\r\nthink that there will be secession, but that the terms of secession\r\nwill be dictated by the North, not by the South; and among these\r\nterms I expect to see an escape from slavery for those border States\r\nto which I have alluded. In that proposition which, in February\r\nlast (1862), was made by the President, and which has since been\r\nsanctioned by the Senate, I think we may see the first step towards\r\nthis measure. It may probably be the case that many of the slaves\r\nwill be driven south; that as the owners of those slaves are driven\r\nfrom their holdings in Virginia they will take their slaves with\r\nthem, or send them before them. The manumission, when it reaches\r\nVirginia, will not probably enfranchise the half million of slaves\r\nwho, in 1860, were counted among its population. But as to that I\r\nconfess myself to be comparatively careless. It is not the concern\r\nwhich I have now at heart. For myself, I shall feel satisfied if that\r\nmanumission shall reach the million of whites by whom Virginia is\r\npopulated; or if not that million in its integrity then that other\r\nmillion by which its rich soil would soon be tenanted. There are\r\nnow about four millions of white men and women inhabiting the slave\r\nStates which I have described, and I think it will be acknowledged\r\nthat the northern States will have done something with their armies\r\nif they succeed in rescuing those four millions from the stain and\r\nevil of slavery.\r\n\r\nThere is a third question which I have asked myself, and to which I\r\nhave undertaken to give some answer. When this war be over between\r\nthe northern and southern States will there come upon us Englishmen\r\na necessity of fighting with the Americans? If there do come such\r\nnecessity, arising out of our conduct to the States during the period\r\nof their civil war, it will indeed be hard upon us, as a nation,\r\nseeing the struggle that we have made to be just in our dealings\r\ntowards the States generally, whether they be North or South. To\r\nbe just in such a period, and under such circumstances, is very\r\ndifficult. In that contest between Sardinia and Austria it was all\r\nbut impossible to be just to the Italians without being unjust to\r\nthe Emperor of Austria. To have been strictly just at the moment\r\none should have begun by confessing the injustice of so much that\r\nhad gone before! But in this American contest such justice, though\r\ndifficult, was easier. Affairs of trade rather than of treaties\r\nchiefly interfered; and these affairs, by a total disregard of our\r\nown pecuniary interests, could be so managed that justice might be\r\ndone. This I think was effected. It may be, of course, that I am\r\nprejudiced on the side of my own nation; but striving to judge of\r\nthe matter as best I may without prejudice, I cannot see that we,\r\nas a nation, have in aught offended against the strictest justice\r\nin our dealings with America during this contest. But justice has\r\nnot sufficed. I do not know that our bitterest foes in the northern\r\nStates have accused us of acting unjustly. It is not justice which\r\nthey have looked for at our hands, and looked for in vain;--not\r\njustice, but generosity! We have not, as they say, sympathized with\r\nthem in their trouble! It seems to me that such a complaint is\r\nunworthy of them as a nation, as a people, or as individuals. In such\r\na matter generosity is another name for injustice,--as it too often\r\nis in all matters. A generous sympathy with the North would have been\r\nan ostensible and crashing enmity to the South. We could not have\r\nsympathized with the North without condemning the South, and telling\r\nto the world that the South were our enemies. In ordering his own\r\nhousehold a man should not want generosity or sympathy from the\r\noutside; and if not a man, then certainly not a nation. Generosity\r\nbetween nations must in its very nature be wrong. One nation may be\r\njust to another, courteous to another, even considerate to another\r\nwith propriety. But no nation can be generous to another without\r\ninjustice either to some third nation, or to itself.\r\n\r\nBut though no accusation of unfairness has, as far as I am aware,\r\never been made by the government of Washington against the government\r\nof London, there can be no doubt that a very strong feeling of\r\nantipathy to England has sprung up in America during this war, and\r\nthat it is even yet so intense in its bitterness, that were the North\r\nto become speedily victorious in their present contest very many\r\nAmericans would be anxious to turn their arms at once against Canada.\r\nAnd I fear that that fight between the Monitor and the Merrimac has\r\nstrengthened this wish by giving to the Americans an unwarranted\r\nconfidence in their capability of defending themselves against any\r\ninjury from British shipping. It may be said by them, and probably\r\nwould be said by many of them, that this feeling of enmity had not\r\nbeen engendered by any idea of national injustice on our side;--that\r\nit might reasonably exist, though no suspicion of such injustice had\r\narisen in the minds of any. They would argue that the hatred on their\r\npart had been engendered by scorn on ours,--by scorn and ill words\r\nheaped upon them in their distress.\r\n\r\nThey would say that slander, scorn, and uncharitable judgments create\r\ndeeper feuds than do robbery and violence, and produce deeper enmity\r\nand worse rancour. \"It is because we have been scorned by England,\r\nthat we hate England. We have been told from week to week, and from\r\nday to day, that we were fools, cowards, knaves, and madmen. We have\r\nbeen treated with disrespect, and that disrespect we will avenge.\" It\r\nis thus that they speak of England, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe opinion so expressed is very general. It is not my purpose here\r\nto say whether in this respect England has given cause of offence\r\nto the States, or whether either country has given cause of offence\r\nto the other. On both sides have many hard words been spoken, and\r\non both sides also have good words been spoken. It is unfortunately\r\nthe case that hard words are pregnant, and as such they are read,\r\ndigested, and remembered; while good words are generally so dull that\r\nnobody reads them willingly, and when read they are forgotten. For\r\nmany years there have been hard words bandied backwards and forwards\r\nbetween England and the United States, showing mutual jealousies and\r\na disposition on the part of each nation to spare no fault committed\r\nby the other. This has grown of rivalry between the two, and in fact\r\nproves the respect which each has for the other's power and wealth.\r\nI will not now pretend to say with which side has been the chiefest\r\nblame, if there has been chiefest blame on either side. But I do say\r\nthat it is monstrous in any people or in any person to suppose that\r\nsuch bickerings can afford a proper ground for war. I am not about to\r\ndilate on the horrors of war. Horrid as war may be, and full of evil,\r\nit is not so horrid to a nation, nor so full of evil, as national\r\ninsult unavenged, or as national injury unredressed. A blow taken by\r\na nation and taken without atonement is an acknowledgment of national\r\ninferiority than which any war is preferable. Neither England nor the\r\nStates are inclined to take such blows. But such a blow, before it\r\ncan be regarded as a national insult, as a wrong done by one nation\r\non another, must be inflicted by the political entity of the one on\r\nthe political entity of the other. No angry clamours of the press,\r\nno declamations of orators, no voices from the people, no studied\r\ncriticisms from the learned few or unstudied censures from society\r\nat large, can have any fair weight on such a question or do aught\r\ntowards justifying a national quarrel. They cannot form a casus\r\nbelli. Those two Latin words, which we all understand, explain this\r\nwith the utmost accuracy. Were it not so, the peace of the world\r\nwould indeed rest upon sand. Causes of national difference will\r\narise,--for governments will be unjust as are individuals. And\r\ncauses of difference will arise because governments are too blind\r\nto distinguish the just from the unjust. But in such cases the\r\ngovernment acts on some ground which it declares. It either shows or\r\npretends to show some casus belli. But in this matter of threatened\r\nwar between the States and England it is declared openly that such\r\nwar is to take place because the English have abused the Americans,\r\nand because, consequently, the Americans hate the English. There\r\nseems to exist an impression that no other ostensible ground for\r\nfighting need be shown, although such an event as that of war between\r\nthe two nations would, as all men acknowledge, be terrible in\r\nits results. \"Your newspapers insulted us when we were in our\r\ndifficulties. Your writers said evil things of us. Your legislators\r\nspoke of us with scorn. You exacted from us a disagreeable duty of\r\nretribution just when the performance of such a duty was most odious\r\nto us. You have shown symptoms of joy at our sorrow. And, therefore,\r\nas soon as our hands are at liberty, we will fight you.\" I have\r\nknown schoolboys to argue in that way, and the arguments have been\r\nintelligible. But I cannot understand that any government should\r\nadmit such an argument.\r\n\r\nNor will the American government willingly admit it. According to\r\nexisting theories of government the armies of nations are but the\r\ntools of the governing powers. If at the close of the present civil\r\nwar the American government,--the old civil government consisting of\r\nthe President with such checks as Congress constitutionally has over\r\nhim,--shall really hold the power to which it pretends, I do not fear\r\nthat there will be any war. No President, and I think no Congress,\r\nwill desire such a war. Nor will the people clamour for it, even\r\nshould the idea of such a war be popular. The people of America are\r\nnot clamorous against their government. If there be such a war it\r\nwill be because the army shall have then become more powerful than\r\nthe Government. If the President can hold his own the people will\r\nsupport him in his desire for peace. But if the President do not hold\r\nhis own;--if some General with two or three hundred thousand men at\r\nhis back shall then have the upper hand in the nation,--it is too\r\nprobable that the people may back him. The old game will be played\r\nagain that has so often been played in the history of nations, and\r\nsome wretched military aspirant will go forth to flood Canada with\r\nblood, in order that the feathers of his cap may flaunt in men's eyes\r\nand that he may be talked of for some years to come as one of the\r\ngreat curses let loose by the Almighty on mankind.\r\n\r\nI must confess that there is danger of this. To us the danger is very\r\ngreat. It cannot be good for us to send ships laden outside with\r\niron shields instead of inside with soft goods and hardware to those\r\nthickly thronged American ports. It cannot be good for us to have\r\nto throw millions into those harbours instead of taking millions\r\nout from them. It cannot be good for us to export thousands upon\r\nthousands of soldiers to Canada of whom only hundreds would return.\r\nThe whole turmoil, cost, and paraphernalia of such a course would be\r\ninjurious to us in the extreme, and the loss of our commerce would\r\nbe nearly ruinous. But the injury of such a war to us would be as\r\nnothing to the injury which it would inflict upon the States. To them\r\nfor many years it would be absolutely ruinous. It would entail not\r\nonly all those losses which such a war must bring with it; but that\r\ngreater loss which would arise to the nation from the fact of its\r\nhaving been powerless to prevent it. Such a war would prove that it\r\nhad lost the freedom for which it had struggled, and which for so\r\nmany years it has enjoyed. For the sake of that people as well as\r\nfor our own,--and for their sakes rather than for our own,--let us,\r\nas far as may be, abstain from words which are needlessly injurious.\r\nThey have done much that is great and noble, even since this war\r\nhas begun, and we have been slow to acknowledge it. They have made\r\nsacrifices for the sake of their country which we have ridiculed.\r\nThey have struggled to maintain a good cause, and we have disbelieved\r\nin their earnestness. They have been anxious to abide by their\r\nconstitution, which to them has been as it were a second gospel, and\r\nwe have spoken of that constitution as though it had been a thing of\r\nmere words in which life had never existed. This has been done while\r\ntheir hands were very full and their back heavily laden. Such words\r\ncoming from us, or from parties among us, cannot justify those\r\nthreats of war which we hear spoken; but that they should make the\r\nhearts of men sore and their thoughts bitter against us can hardly be\r\nmatter of surprise.\r\n\r\nAs to the result of any such war between us and them, it would depend\r\nmainly, I think, on the feelings of the Canadians. Neither could\r\nthey annex Canada without the good-will of the Canadians, nor could\r\nwe keep Canada without that good-will. At present the feeling in\r\nCanada against the northern States is so strong and so universal that\r\nEngland has little to fear on that head.\r\n\r\nI have now done my task, and may take leave of my readers on either\r\nside of the water with a hearty hope that the existing war between\r\nthe North and South may soon be over, and that none other may follow\r\non its heels to exercise that new-fledged military skill which\r\nthe existing quarrel will have produced on the other side of the\r\nAtlantic. I have written my book in obscure language if I have not\r\nshown that to me social successes and commercial prosperity are much\r\ndearer than any greatness that can be won by arms. The Americans had\r\nfondly thought that they were to be exempt from the curse of war,--at\r\nany rate from the bitterness of the curse. But the days for such\r\nexemption have not come as yet. While we are hurrying on to make\r\ntwelve-inch shield-plates for our men-of-war, we can hardly dare\r\nto think of the days when the sword shall be turned into the\r\nploughshare. May it not be thought well for us if, with such work\r\non our hands, any scraps of iron shall be left to us with which to\r\npursue the purposes of peace? But at least let us not have war with\r\nthese children of our own. If we must fight, let us fight the French,\r\n\"for King George upon the throne.\" The doing so will be disagreeable,\r\nbut it will not be antipathetic to the nature of an Englishman. For\r\nmy part, when an American tells me that he wants to fight with me,\r\nI regard his offence as compared with that of a Frenchman under the\r\nsame circumstances, as I would compare the offence of a parricide\r\nor a fratricide with that of a mere common-place murderer. Such a\r\nwar would be plus quam civile bellum. Which of us two could take a\r\nthrashing from the other and afterwards go about our business with\r\ncontentment?\r\n\r\nOn our return to Liverpool, we stayed for a few hours at Queenstown,\r\ntaking in coal, and the passengers landed that they might stretch\r\ntheir legs and look about them. I also went ashore at the dear old\r\nplace which I had known well in other days, when the people were not\r\ntoo grand to call it Cove, and were contented to run down from Cork\r\nin river steamers, before the Passage railway was built. I spent a\r\npleasant summer there once in those times;--God be with the good\r\nold days! And now I went ashore at Queenstown, happy to feel that\r\nI should be again in a British isle, and happy also to know that I\r\nwas once more in Ireland. And when the people came around me as they\r\ndid, I seemed to know every face and to be familiar with every voice.\r\nIt has been my fate to have so close an intimacy with Ireland, that\r\nwhen I meet an Irishman abroad, I always recognize in him more of a\r\nkinsman than I do in an Englishman. I never ask an Englishman from\r\nwhat county he comes, or what was his town. To Irishmen I usually put\r\nsuch questions, and I am generally familiar with the old haunts which\r\nthey name. I was happy therefore to feel myself again in Ireland, and\r\nto walk round from Queenstown to the river at Passage by the old way\r\nthat had once been familiar to my feet.\r\n\r\nOr rather I should have been happy if I had not found myself\r\ninstantly disgraced by the importunities of my friends! A legion of\r\nwomen surrounded me, imploring alms, begging my honour to bestow my\r\ncharity on them for the love of the Virgin, using the most holy names\r\nin their adjurations for halfpence, clinging to me with that half\r\njoking, half lachrymose air of importunity which an Irish beggar has\r\nassumed as peculiarly her own. There were men too, who begged as well\r\nas women. And the women were sturdy and fat, and, not knowing me as\r\nwell as I knew them, seemed resolved that their importunities should\r\nbe successful. After all, I had an old world liking for them in their\r\nrags. They were endeared to me by certain memories and associations\r\nwhich I cannot define. But then what would those Americans think of\r\nthem;--of them and of the country which produced them? That was the\r\nreflection which troubled me. A legion of women in rags clamorous for\r\nbread, protesting to heaven that they are starving, importunate with\r\nvoices and with hands, surrounding the stranger when he puts his foot\r\non the soil so that he cannot escape, does not afford to the cynical\r\nAmerican who then first visits us,--and they all are cynical when\r\nthey visit us,--a bad opportunity for his sarcasm. He can at any rate\r\nboast that he sees nothing of that at home. I myself am fond of Irish\r\nbeggars. It is an acquired taste,--which comes upon one as does that\r\nfor smoked whisky, or Limerick tobacco. But I certainly did wish that\r\nthere were not so many of them at Queenstown.\r\n\r\nI tell all this here not to the disgrace of Ireland;--not for the\r\ntriumph of America. The Irishman or American who thinks rightly on\r\nthe subject will know that the state of each country has arisen from\r\nits opportunities. Beggary does not prevail in new countries, and but\r\nfew old countries have managed to exist without it. As to Ireland we\r\nmay rejoice to say that there is less of it now than there was twenty\r\nyears since. Things are mending there. But though such excuses may\r\nbe truly made,--although an Englishman when he sees this squalor and\r\npoverty on the quays at Queenstown, consoles himself with reflecting\r\nthat the evil has been unavoidable, but will perhaps soon be\r\navoided,--nevertheless he cannot but remember that there is no such\r\nsqualor and no such poverty in the land from which he has returned.\r\nI claim no credit for the new country. I impute no blame to the old\r\ncountry. But there is the fact. The Irishman when he expatriates\r\nhimself to one of those American States loses much of that\r\naffectionate, confiding, master-worshipping nature which makes him so\r\ngood a fellow when at home. But he becomes more of a man. He assumes\r\na dignity which he never has known before. He learns to regard his\r\nlabour as his own property. That which he earns he takes without\r\nthanks, but he desires to take no more than he earns. To me\r\npersonally he has perhaps become less pleasant than he was. But to\r\nhimself--! It seems to me that such a man must feel himself half a\r\ngod, if he has the power of comparing what he is with what he was.\r\n\r\nIt is right that all this should be acknowledged by us. When we speak\r\nof America and of her institutions we should remember that she has\r\ngiven to our increasing population rights and privileges which we\r\ncould not give;--which as an old country we probably can never give.\r\nThat self-asserting, obtrusive independence which so often wounds us,\r\nis, if viewed aright, but an outward sign of those good things which\r\na new country has produced for its people. Men and women do not beg\r\nin the States;--they do not offend you with tattered rags; they do\r\nnot complain to heaven of starvation; they do not crouch to the\r\nground for halfpence. If poor, they are not abject in their poverty.\r\nThey read and write. They walk like human beings made in God's form.\r\nThey know that they are men and women, owing it to themselves and\r\nto the world that they should earn their bread by their labour, but\r\nfeeling that when earned it is their own. If this be so,--if it be\r\nacknowledged that it is so,--should not such knowledge in itself\r\nbe sufficient testimony of the success of the country and of her\r\ninstitutions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one\r\npeople to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with\r\nanother, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate\r\nand equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God\r\nentitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires\r\nthat they should declare the causes which impel them to the\r\nseparation.\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created\r\nequal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are\r\ninstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent\r\nof the governed; and that, whenever any form of government becomes\r\ndestructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or\r\nabolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundations\r\non such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to\r\nthem shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\r\nPrudence, indeed, will dictate that governments, long established,\r\nshould not be changed for light and transient causes; and,\r\naccordingly, all experience hath shown, that mankind are more\r\ndisposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right\r\nthemselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But,\r\nwhen a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably\r\nthe same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute\r\ndespotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such\r\ngovernment, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such\r\nhas been the patient sufferance of the colonies, and such is now the\r\nnecessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of\r\ngovernment. The history of the present king of Great Britain is a\r\nhistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having, in direct\r\nobject, the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States.\r\nTo prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\r\n\r\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary\r\nfor the public good.\r\n\r\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing\r\nimportance, unless suspended in their operations till his assent\r\nshould be obtained; and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected\r\nto attend to them.\r\n\r\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large\r\ndistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right\r\nof representation in the legislature--a right inestimable to them,\r\nand formidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\nuncomfortable, and distant from the repository of their public\r\nrecords, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with\r\nhis measures.\r\n\r\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with\r\nmanly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nHe has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause\r\nothers to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable\r\nof annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their\r\nexercise; the State remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the\r\ndangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for\r\nthat purpose, obstructing the laws of naturalization of foreigners,\r\nrefusing to pass others to encourage their migration thither, and\r\nraising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.\r\n\r\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his\r\nassent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.\r\n\r\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of\r\ntheir offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of\r\nofficers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.\r\n\r\nHe has kept among us, in time of peace, standing armies, without the\r\nconsent of our legislatures.\r\n\r\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior\r\nto, the civil power.\r\n\r\nHe has combined, with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign\r\nto our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his\r\nassent to their acts of pretended legislation.\r\n\r\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us.\r\n\r\nFor protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders\r\nwhich they should commit on the inhabitants of these States.\r\n\r\nFor cutting off our trade with all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nFor imposing taxes on us without our consent\r\n\r\nFor depriving us, in many cases, of the benefit of trial by jury.\r\n\r\nFor transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offences.\r\n\r\nFor abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighbouring\r\nprovince, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging\r\nits boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit\r\ninstrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nFor taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and\r\naltering, fundamentally, the forms of our governments.\r\n\r\nFor suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves\r\ninvested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHe has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his\r\nprotection and waging war against us.\r\n\r\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and\r\ndestroyed the lives of our people.\r\n\r\nHe is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries\r\nto complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already\r\nbegun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled\r\nin the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a\r\ncivilized nation.\r\n\r\nHe has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high\r\nseas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners\r\nof their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.\r\n\r\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured\r\nto bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian\r\nsavages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished\r\ndestruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress\r\nin the most humble terms. Our repeated petitions have been answered\r\nonly by repeated injuries. A prince, whose character is thus marked\r\nby every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of\r\na free people.\r\n\r\nNor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren.\r\nWe have warned them, from time to time, of the attempts by their\r\nlegislature, to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have\r\nreminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement\r\nhere. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and\r\nwe have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow\r\nthese usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections\r\nand correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice\r\nand of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity\r\nwhich denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of\r\nmankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America,\r\nin General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the\r\nworld for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by\r\nthe authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish\r\nand declare that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to\r\nbe, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all\r\nallegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection\r\nbetween them and the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be,\r\ntotally dissolved; and that, as free and independent States, they\r\nhave full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances,\r\nestablish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which\r\nindependent States may of right do. And, for the support of this\r\ndeclaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine\r\nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes,\r\nand our sacred honour.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing declaration was, by order of Congress, engrossed, and\r\nsigned by the following members:\r\n\r\nJOHN HANCOCK.\r\n\r\n_New Hampshire._\r\n\r\nJosiah Bartlett,\r\nWilliam Whipple,\r\nMatthew Thornton.\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts Bay._\r\n\r\nSamuel Adams,\r\nJohn Adams,\r\nRobert Treat Paine,\r\nElbridge Gerry.\r\n\r\n_Rhode Island._\r\n\r\nStephen Hopkins,\r\nWilliam Ellery.\r\n\r\n_Connecticut._\r\n\r\nRoger Sherman,\r\nSamuel Huntington,\r\nWilliam Williams,\r\nOliver Wolcott.\r\n\r\n_New York._\r\n\r\nWilliam Floyd,\r\nPhilip Livingston,\r\nFrancis Lewis,\r\nLewis Morris.\r\n\r\n_New Jersey._\r\n\r\nRichard Stockton,\r\nJohn Witherspoon,\r\nFrancis Hopkinson,\r\nJohn Hart,\r\nAbraham Clark.\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._\r\n\r\nRobert Morris,\r\nBenjamin Rush,\r\nBenjamin Franklin,\r\nJohn Morton,\r\nGeorge Clymer,\r\nJames Smith,\r\nGeorge Taylor,\r\nJames Wilson,\r\nGeorge Ross.\r\n\r\n_Delaware._\r\n\r\nCæsar Rodney,\r\nGeorge Read,\r\nThomas M'Kean.\r\n\r\n_Maryland._\r\n\r\nSamuel Chase,\r\nWilliam Paca,\r\nThomas Stone,\r\nCharles Carroll, of Carrollton.\r\n\r\n_Virginia._\r\n\r\nGeorge Wythie,\r\nRichard Henry Lee,\r\nThomas Jefferson,\r\nBenjamin Harrison,\r\nThomas Nelson, Jr.\r\nFrancis Lightfoot Lee,\r\nCarter Braxton.\r\n\r\n_North Carolina._\r\n\r\nWilliam Hooper,\r\nJoseph Hewes,\r\nJohn Penn.\r\n\r\n_South Carolina._\r\n\r\nEdward Rutledge,\r\nThomas Heyward, Jr.\r\nThomas Lynch, Jr.\r\nArthur Middleton.\r\n\r\n_Georgia._\r\n\r\nButton Gwinnett,\r\nLyman Hall,\r\nGeorge Walton.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 _July_, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME.\r\n\r\n_We, the undersigned, delegates of the States, affixed to our names,\r\nsend greeting:_\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the delegates of the United States of America, in Congress\r\nassembled did, on the fifteenth day of November, in the year of\r\nour Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven, and in\r\nthe second year of the independence of America, agree to certain\r\narticles of confederation and perpetual union between the States\r\nof New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence\r\nPlantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, in the words following, viz:\r\n\r\n   Articles of confederation and perpetual union between the States\r\n   of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence\r\n   Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\n   Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\n   Georgia.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 1.

By the electoral returns they had an even number\r\n   of votes. In the House of Representatives, Burr, by intrigue,\r\n   got up a party to vote for him for President; and the House was\r\n   so divided that there was a tie. A contest was carried on for\r\n   several days, and so warmly, that even sick members were brought\r\n   to the House on their beds. Finally one of Burr's adherents\r\n   withdrew, and Jefferson was elected by one majority--which was\r\n   the occasion of this twelfth article.",
