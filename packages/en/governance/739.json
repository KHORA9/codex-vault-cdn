Adam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Henry Clay, \"On the Seminole War,\"\r\n  U.S. House of Representatives\r\n  19 January 1819.\r\n\r\n  Henry Clay, \"On the Expunging Resolutions,\"\r\n  U.S. Senate\r\n  16 January 1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1\r\n\r\n  Henry Clay, \"On the Expunging Resolutions,\"\r\n  U.S. Senate,\r\n  16 January 1837\r\n\r\nMr. President:\r\n\r\nWHAT patriotic purpose is to be accomplished by this Expunging\r\nresolution?  What new honor or fresh laurels will it win for our common\r\ncountry?  Is the power of the Senate so vast that it ought to be\r\ncircumscribed, and that of the President so restricted that it ought to\r\nbe extended?  What power has the Senate?  None, separately.  It can\r\nonly act jointly with the other House, or jointly with the Executive.\r\nAnd although the theory of the Constitution supposes, when consulted by\r\nhim, it may freely give an affirmative or negative response, according\r\nto the practice, as it now exists, it has lost the faculty of\r\npronouncing the negative monosyllable.  When the Senate expresses its\r\ndeliberate judgment, in the form of resolution, that resolution has no\r\ncompulsory force, but appeals only to the dispassionate intelligence,\r\nthe calm reason, and the sober judgment, of the community.  The Senate\r\nhas no army, no navy, no patronage, no lucrative offices, no glittering\r\nhonors, to bestow.  Around us there is no swarm of greedy expectants,\r\nrendering us homage, anticipating our wishes, and ready to execute our\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nHow is it with the President?  Is he powerless?  He is felt from one\r\nextremity to the other of this vast Republic.  By means of principles\r\nwhich he has introduced, and innovations which he has made in our\r\ninstitutions, alas! but too much countenanced by Congress and a\r\nconfiding people, he exercises, uncontrolled, the power of the State.\r\nIn one hand he holds the purse, and in the other brandishes the sword\r\nof the country.  Myriads of dependants and partisans, scattered over\r\nthe land, are ever ready to sing hosannas to him, and to laud to the\r\nskies whatever he does.  He has swept over the government, during the\r\nlast eight years, like a tropical tornado.  Every department exhibits\r\ntraces of the ravages of the storm.  Take as one example the Bank of\r\nthe United States.  No institution could have been more popular with\r\nthe people, with Congress, and with State Legislatures.  None ever\r\nbetter fulfilled the great purposes of its establishment.  But it\r\nunfortunately incurred the displeasure of the President; he spoke, and\r\nthe bank lies prostrate.  And those who were loudest in its praise are\r\nnow loudest in its condemnation. What object of his ambition is\r\nunsatisfied?  When disabled from age any longer to hold the sceptre of\r\npower, he designates his successor, and transmits it to his favorite!\r\nWhat more does he want?  Must we blot, deface, and mutilate the records\r\nof the country, to punish the presumptuousness of expressing an opinion\r\ncontrary to his own?  What patriotic purpose is to be accomplished by\r\nthis Expunging resolution?  Can you make that not to be which has been?\r\nCan you eradicate from memory and from history the fact that in March,\r\n1834, a majority of the Senate of the United States passed the\r\nresolution which excites your enmity?  Is it your vain and wicked\r\nobject to arrogate to yourselves that power of annihilating the past\r\nwhich has been denied to Omnipotence itself?  Do you intend to thrust\r\nyour hands into our hearts, and to pluck out the deeply rooted\r\nconvictions which are there?  Or is it your design merely to stigmatize\r\nus?  You cannot stigmatize us.\r\n\r\n     \"Ne'er yet did base dishonor blur our name.\"\r\n\r\nStanding securely upon our conscious rectitude, and bearing aloft the\r\nshield of the Constitution of our country, your puny efforts are\r\nimpotent; and we defy all your power.  Put the majority of 1834 in one\r\nscale, and that by which this Expunging resolution is to be carried in\r\nthe other, and let truth and justice, in heaven above and on earth\r\nbelow, and liberty and patriotism, decide the preponderance.\r\n\r\nWhat patriotic purpose is to be accomplished by the Expunging\r\nresolution?  Is it to appease the wrath and to heal the wounded pride\r\nof the Chief Magistrate?  If he be really the hero that his friends\r\nrepresent him, he must despise all mean condescension,  all grovelling\r\nsycophancy, all self-degradation and self-abasement.  He would reject,\r\nwith scorn and contempt, as unworthy of his fame, your black scratches\r\nand your baby lines in the fair records of his country.  Black lines!\r\nBlack lines!  Sir, I hope the Secretary of the Senate will preserve the\r\npen with which he may inscribe them, and present it to that Senator of\r\nthe majority whom he may select, as a proud trophy, to be transmitted\r\nto his descendants.  And hereafter, when we shall lose the forms of our\r\nfree institutions, all that now remain to us, some future American\r\nmonarch, in gratitude to those by whose means he has been enabled, upon\r\nthe ruins of civil liberty, to erect a throne, and to commemorate\r\nespecially this Expunging resolution, may institute a new order of\r\nknighthood, and confer on it the appropriate name of \"the Knights of\r\nthe Black Lines.\"\r\n\r\nBut why should I detain the Senate, or needlessly waste my breath in\r\nfruitless exertions?  The decree has gone forth.  It is one of urgency,\r\ntoo.  The deed is to be done--that foul deed which, like the blood,\r\nstaining the hands of the guilty Macbeth, all ocean's  waters will\r\nnever wash out.  Proceed, then, to the noble work which lies before\r\nyou, and, like other  skilful executioners, do it quickly.  And when\r\nyou have perpetrated it, go home to the people, and tell them what\r\nglorious honors you have achieved for our common country.  Tell them\r\nthat you have extinguished one of the brightest and purest lights that\r\never burned at the altar of civil liberty.  Tell them that you have\r\nsilenced one of the noblest batteries that ever thundered in defence of\r\nthe Constitution, and bravely spiked the cannon.  Tell them that,\r\nhenceforward, no matter what daring or outrageous act any president may\r\nperform, you have forever hermetically sealed the mouth of the Senate.\r\nTell them that he may fearlessly assume what powers he pleases, snatch\r\nfrom its lawful custody the public purse, command a military detachment\r\nto enter the halls of the Capitol, overawe Congress, trample down the\r\nConstitution, and raze every bulwark of freedom; but that the Senate\r\nmust stand mute, in silent submission, and not dare to raise its\r\nopposing voice.  Tell them that it must wait until a House of\r\nRepresentatives, humbled and subdued like itself, and a majority of it\r\ncomposed of the partisans of the President, shall prefer articles of\r\nimpeachment.  Tell them, finally, that you have restored the glorious\r\ndoctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance.  And, if the people\r\ndo not pour out their indignation and imprecations, I have yet to learn\r\nthe character of American freemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\n\r\n  Henry Clay, \"On the Seminole War,\"\r\n  U.S. House of Representatives,\r\n  19 January 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\nIF MY recollection does not deceive me, Bonaparte had passed the Rhine\r\nand the Alps, had conquered Italy, the Netherlands, Holland, Hanover,\r\nLubec, and Hamburg, and extended his empire as far as Altona, on the\r\nside of Denmark.  A few days' march would have carried him through\r\nHolstein, over the two Belts, through Funen, and into the island of\r\nZealand.  What, then, was the conduct of England?  It was my lot to\r\nfall into conversation with an intelligent Englishman on this subject.\r\n\"We knew (said he) that we were fighting for our existence.  It was\r\nabsolutely necessary that we should preserve the command of the seas.\r\nIf the fleet of Denmark fell into the enemy's hands, combined with his\r\nother fleets, that command might be rendered doubtful.  Denmark had\r\nonly a nominal independence.  She was, in truth, subject to his sway.\r\nWe said to her, Give us your fleet; it will otherwise be taken\r\npossession of by your secret and our open enemy.  We will preserve it\r\nand restore it to you whenever the danger shall be over.  Denmark\r\nrefused.  Copenhagen was bombarded, and gallantly defended, but the\r\nfleet was seized.\"  Everywhere the conduct of England was censured; and\r\nthe name even of the negotiator who was employed by her, who was\r\nsubsequently the minister near this government, was scarcely ever\r\npronounced here without coupling with it an epithet indicating his\r\nparticipation in the disgraceful transaction.  And yet we are going to\r\nsanction acts of violence, committed by ourselves, which but too much\r\nresemble it!  What an important difference, too, between the relative\r\ncondition of England and of this country!  She, perhaps, was struggling\r\nfor her existence.  She was combating, single-handed, the most enormous\r\nmilitary power that the world has ever known.  With whom were we\r\ncontending?  With a few half-starved, half-clothed, wretched Indians\r\nand fugitive slaves.  And while carrying on this inglorious war,\r\ninglorious as regards the laurels or renown won in it, we violate\r\nneutral rights, which the government had solemnly pledged itself to\r\nrespect, upon the principle of convenience, or upon the light\r\npresumption that, by possibility, a post might be taken by this\r\nmiserable combination of Indians and slaves....\r\n\r\nI will not trespass much longer upon the time of the committee; but I\r\ntrust I shall be indulged with some few reflections upon the danger of\r\npermitting the conduct on which it has been my painful duty to\r\nanimadvert, to pass without the solemn expression of the disapprobation\r\nof this House.  Recall to your recollection the free nations which have\r\ngone before us.  Where are they now?\r\n\r\n\"Gone glimmering through the dream of  things that were, A schoolboy's\r\ntale, the wonder of an hour.\"\r\n\r\nAnd how have they lost their liberties?  If we could transport\r\nourselves back to the ages when Greece and Rome flourished in their\r\ngreatest prosperity, and, mingling in the throng, should ask a Grecian\r\nif he did not fear that some daring military chieftain, covered with\r\nglory, some Philip or Alexander, would one day overthrow the liberties\r\nof his country, the confident and indignant Grecian would exclaim, No!\r\nno! we have nothing to fear from our heroes; our liberties will be\r\neternal.  If a Roman citizen had been asked if he did not fear that the\r\nconqueror of Gaul might establish a throne upon the ruins of public\r\nliberty, he would have instantly repelled the unjust insinuation.  Yet\r\nGreece fell; Caesar passed the Rubicon, and the patriotic arm even of\r\nBrutus could not preserve the liberties of his devoted country!  The\r\ncelebrated Madame de Stael, in her last and perhaps her best work, has\r\nsaid, that in the very year, almost the very month, when the president\r\nof the Directory declared that monarchy would never more show its\r\nfrightful head in France, Bonaparte, with his grenadiers, entered the\r\npalace of St. Cloud, and, dispersing with the bayonet the deputies of\r\nthe people deliberating on the affairs of the State, laid the\r\nfoundation of that vast fabric of despotism which overshadowed all\r\nEurope.  I hope not to be misunderstood; I am far from intimating that\r\nGeneral Jackson cherishes any designs inimical to the liberties of the\r\ncountry.  I believe his intentions to be pure and patriotic.  I thank\r\nGod that he would not, but I thank him still more that he could not if\r\nhe would, overturn the liberties of the Republic.  But precedents, if\r\nbad, are fraught with the most dangerous consequences.  Man has been\r\ndescribed, by some of those who have treated of his nature, as a bundle\r\nof habits.  The definition is much truer when applied to governments.\r\nPrecedents are their habits.  There is one important difference between\r\nthe formation of habits by an individual and by governments.  He\r\ncontracts only after frequent repetition.  A single instance fixes the\r\nhabit and determines the direction of governments.  Against the\r\nalarming doctrine of unlimited discretion in our military commanders\r\nwhen applied even to prisoners of war, I must enter my protest.  It\r\nbegins upon them; it will end on us.  I hope our happy form of\r\ngovernment is to be perpetual.  But, if it is to be preserved, it must\r\nbe by the practice of virtue, by justice, by moderation, by\r\nmagnanimity, by greatness of soul, by keeping a watchful and steady eye\r\non the Executive; and, above all, by holding to a strict accountability\r\nthe military branch of the public force.\r\n\r\nWe are fighting a great moral battle for the benefit not only of our\r\ncountry, but of all mankind.  The eyes of the whole world are in fixed\r\nattention upon us.  One, and the larger portion of it, is gazing with\r\ncontempt, with jealousy, and with envy; the other portion, with hope,\r\nwith confidence, and with affection.  Everywhere the black cloud of\r\nlegitimacy is suspended over the world, save only one bright spot,\r\nwhich breaks out from the political hemisphere of the West, to\r\nenlighten and animate and gladden the human heart.  Obscure that by the\r\ndownfall of liberty here, and all mankind are enshrouded in a pall of\r\nuniversal darkness.   To you, Mr. Chairman, belongs the high privilege\r\nof transmitting, unimpaired, to posterity the fair character and\r\nliberty of our country.  Do you expect to execute this high trust by\r\ntrampling, or suffering to be trampled down, law, justice, the\r\nConstitution, and the rights of the people?  by exhibiting examples of\r\ninhumanity and cruelty and ambition?  When the minions of despotism\r\nheard, in Europe, of the seizure of Pensacola, how did they chuckle,\r\nand chide the admirers of our institutions, tauntingly pointing to the\r\ndemonstration of a spirit of injustice and aggrandizement made by our\r\ncountry, in the midst of an amicable negotiation!  Behold, said they,\r\nthe conduct of those who are constantly reproaching kings!  You saw how\r\nthose admirers were astounded and hung their heads.  You saw, too, when\r\nthat illustrious man, who presides over us, adopted his pacific,\r\nmoderate, and just course, how they once more lifted up their heads\r\nwith exultation and delight beaming in their countenances.  And you saw\r\nhow those minions themselves were finally compelled to unite in the\r\ngeneral praises bestowed upon our government.  Beware how you forfeit\r\nthis exalted character.  Beware how you give a fatal sanction, in this\r\ninfant period of our Republic, scarcely yet twoscore years old, to\r\nmilitary insubordination.  Remember that Greece had her Alexander, Rome\r\nher Caesar, England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte, and that if we\r\nwould escape the rock on which they split we must avoid their errors.\r\n\r\nHow different has been the treatment of General Jackson and that\r\nmodest, but heroic young man, a native of one of the smallest States in\r\nthe Union, who achieved for his country, on Lake Erie, one of the most\r\nglorious victories of the late war.  In a moment of passion he forgot\r\nhimself and offered an act of violence which was repented of as soon as\r\nperpetrated.  He was tried, and suffered the judgment to be pronounced\r\nby his peers.  Public justice was thought not even then to be\r\nsatisfied.  The press and Congress took up the subject.  My honorable\r\nfriend from Virginia, Mr. Johnson, the faithful and consistent sentinel\r\nof the law and of the Constitution, disapproved in that instance, as he\r\ndoes in this, and moved an inquiry.  The public mind remained agitated\r\nand unappeased until the recent atonement, so honorably made by the\r\ngallant commodore.  And is there to be a distinction between the\r\nofficers of the two branches of the public service?  Are former\r\nservices, however eminent, to preclude even inquiry into recent\r\nmisconduct?  Is there to be no limit, no prudential bounds to the\r\nnational gratitude?  I am not disposed to censure the President for not\r\nordering a court of inquiry, or a general court-martial.  Perhaps,\r\nimpelled by a sense of gratitude, he determined, by anticipation, to\r\nextend to the general that pardon which he had the undoubted right to\r\ngrant after sentence.  Let us not shrink from our duty.  Let us assert\r\nour constitutional powers, and vindicate the instrument from military\r\nviolation.\r\n\r\nI hope gentlemen will deliberately survey the awful isthmus on which we\r\nstand.  They may bear down all opposition; they may even vote the\r\ngeneral the public thanks; they may carry him triumphantly through this\r\nHouse.  But, if they do, in my humble judgment, it will be a triumph of\r\nthe principle of insubordination, a triumph of the military over the\r\ncivil authority, a triumph over the powers of this House, a triumph\r\nover the Constitution of the land.  And I pray most devoutly to Heaven\r\nthat it may not prove, in its ultimate effects and consequences, a\r\ntriumph over the liberties of the people.",
