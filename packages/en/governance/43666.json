In\r\naccordance with this policy he has gone through his country from end\r\nto end and into foreign lands, everywhere announcing his policies and\r\nhis views on every possible subject of interest or controversy. Up to\r\n1905 he had made upward of five hundred and seventy speeches, and since\r\nthat time has made almost as many more. It was manifestly impossible\r\nto give all of these speeches, and it was also thought unfair to give\r\nmerely extracts which might fail to represent the spirit of the entire\r\npronouncement. They are all printed, therefore, in the completest\r\nform available. Particular speeches have often been reported to the\r\npress in widely differing versions. In all cases only those speeches\r\nare here presented which have received official or semiofficial\r\nsanction. The text followed for pronouncements made before 1913,\r\nwith the one exception of the _Daily Telegraph_ interview, October\r\n29, 1908, has always been that of the recognized and standard edition\r\nin four volumes, edited by J. Penzler and published in the Reclam\r\n_Universal-Bibliothek_. Now and then only portions of certain addresses\r\nappear to have been reported, and on a few occasions parts of speeches\r\nare given directly and other parts are merely summarized. In all such\r\ncases the speech is translated from the form sanctioned in the official\r\nversion. In no case has any change been made. Where significant\r\ndifferences exist in the versions of addresses as given officially and\r\nunofficially, the official version is in every instance printed first.\r\nIt has been the aim to present faithfully the language and spirit of\r\nthe speaker, and his phraseology and emphasis have been reproduced as\r\nclosely as was at all consistent with fair English usage. The speeches\r\nhave been chosen to represent in due proportion his many interests,\r\nand range therefore from agriculture and art to Biblical criticism,\r\nnational and international politics.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has, of course, not given titles to his speeches, and\r\nthe headings have been assigned by the compiler. It has been his\r\naim to explain the circumstances under which each address was\r\ndelivered and to make plain the references to events embodied therein.\r\nQuestions which have had a continuous interest, or which have had\r\nsome lasting effect on Germany's policy, such as the attitude toward\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, the Social Democratic party, the retirement of\r\nBismarck, the development of the navy, the Morocco question, have\r\nbeen treated at greater length on the first fitting occasion. For\r\nthe introductions, therefore, the compiler assumes responsibility.\r\nIn preparing them he has had recourse to many incidental sources\r\nof information, and in many cases the true inwardness of certain\r\nsituations is still as much a matter of controversy as the causes\r\nof the present war. For his facts generally, he has followed where\r\npossible, besides such incidental and contemporary sources, Bruno\r\nGebhardt's \"Handbuch der Deutschen Geschichte\" (1913), the \"Cambridge\r\nModern History--The Latest Age,\" volume XII (1910), and the volumes of\r\nthe \"Statesman's Yearbook.\" In addition, for information concerning\r\nthe internal development of Germany he has consulted and drawn\r\nupon the literature of this subject which has appeared in the last\r\ndecade, but is more particularly indebted to Doctor Paul Liman's\r\n\"Der Kaiser,\" Dawson's \"The Evolution of Modern Germany,\" Barker's\r\n\"Modern Germany,\" Price Collier's \"Germany and the Germans,\" Forbes's\r\n\"William of Germany,\" Gibbons's \"The New Map of Europe,\" and the\r\n\"_Reichsgesetzblatt_.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Emperor has spoken upon almost every phase of German political\r\nlife, with the editorial introductions which aim to set forth briefly\r\nthe occasion and causes of each address, it is hoped that altogether\r\nthe volume will offer a fairly accurate picture of the trend of German\r\naffairs for the last twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nFor help in the preparation of this volume, the writer is much indebted\r\nto his wife, whose assistance has amounted to collaboration.\r\n\r\n  PRINCETON, N.

168\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE HOHENZOLLERN TRADITION\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest Renan, the author of that once heretical \"Life of Jesus,\" was\r\nby temperament unenthusiastic and had further schooled himself to look\r\nupon all human events with high unconcern. The great sceptic had been\r\nborn in 1823; he was therefore sixty-five at the time of the accession\r\nof William II, and his declining health, in Horatian phrase, refused\r\nto allow him to enter upon any long hope. In looking forward to his\r\ninevitable end one thing, he said, afflicted him. He regretted only\r\nthat he was not to see, in its later and more decisive phases, the\r\nunfolding of the multiform personality of the new German Emperor. To\r\nhim it was an intellectual puzzle, more intricate and more interesting\r\nthan any he had encountered in the many cycles of the history of the\r\nHebrews or in the complicated schisms of the church. In the early years\r\nof his reign the youthful Emperor was regarded with much interest and\r\nsome concern by his contemporaries generally. He was the chameleon\r\namong the royal figures of Europe. One day he receives the Czar at\r\nBerlin and proclaims peace to the world. A few weeks later he visits\r\nthe Sultan at Constantinople, and shortly thereafter he announces to\r\nhis loyal Brandenburgers that he will lead them on to greater things.\r\nWhat did he mean? Now he is a soldier, jesting with his officers; and,\r\nwith the rising of another sun, in workman's garb, with the axe upon\r\nhis shoulder, he goes forth as woodman or laborer on his own estates.\r\nAt home he was regarded as Benjamin Constant regarded Madame de Staël.\r\nHe was the \"_bel orage_,\" the beautiful storm which had come upon\r\nEurope in the dull and piping times of peace of the last decades of\r\nthe nineteenth century. He cleared the air of Continental politics\r\nin the years of late Victorianism. He was a dilettante of dangerous\r\nactivities, as Renan had been of antiquated heresies and harmless,\r\noutworn systems, and to him Fate seemed to have given the future as a\r\ntoy. Such, at least, was the view of the famous Portuguese poet Eça de\r\nQueiroz, who cast his horoscope in 1891.\r\n\r\nA quarter century of peace had removed much apprehension. After the\r\ndismissal of Bismarck he had shaped his own policy and gone his own\r\nway. To his great advisers he had seemed to say: \"_Ôte-toi que je\r\nm'y mette._\" Yet his career had ceased to disquiet, and the youthful\r\nexuberance had given way to mature and conscientious labor. With\r\nunshakable confidence in himself and with a determined application he\r\nwas making Germany the greatest state in Europe. To those who, unlike\r\nRenan, did not have the misfortune to have been born too soon to be his\r\nlater contemporaries, the riddle _seemed_ to be solving itself to the\r\ngreater good of humanity. The Emperor's army, so he tells us himself,\r\nis invincible. Never has Germany been defeated so long as she was\r\nunited, and God, who has taken such infinite pains with us, will never\r\nleave us \"in the lurch.\" By means of this powerful, unconquerable army,\r\nat whose side he had now set one of the greatest fleets on the seas, he\r\nhad, so he told us, laid firm and sure the foundations of peace.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly \"the abyss is opened, ... the sword is thrust into his\r\nhand,\" and reluctantly and with a heavy heart he goes forth to do\r\nbattle. Like a shuttle he flits from frontier to frontier, now planning\r\nan invasion of England, now supervising the readministration of Belgian\r\nindustries, and now directing a battle in Poland. Surely such a\r\ndestiny, so immense a power, has been granted to no man. It may be he\r\nis the great predestined victim; it may be that Time is preparing for\r\nhim a final and well-earned European triumph.\r\n\r\nWhat shall be the end, and where lies the responsibility? No ethical\r\nor political problem of our time forces itself upon us with greater\r\ninsistence. His utterances may help to make the question if not the\r\nanswer clear. Looking forward dispassionately twenty-three years ago\r\nthat Portuguese student prophesied that this could not last, that there\r\nwould be war; and in the light of later events that prophecy about \"the\r\nallied armies\" has been recently recalled. It was in these words that\r\nhe closed his brilliant study of the youthful Emperor and King:\r\n\r\n\"William II runs the awful danger of being cast down Gemoniæ. He boldly\r\ntakes upon himself responsibilities which in all nations are divided\r\namong various bodies of the state--he alone judges, he alone executes,\r\nbecause to him alone it is (not to his ministers, to his council, or\r\nto his parliament) that God, the God of the Hohenzollerns, imparts\r\nhis transcendental inspiration. He must therefore be infallible and\r\ninvincible. At the first disaster--whether it be inflicted by his\r\nburghers or by his people in the streets of Berlin, or by allied armies\r\non the plains of Europe--Germany will at once conclude that his\r\nmuch-vaunted alliance with God was the trick of a wily despot.\r\n\r\n\"Then will there not be stones enough from Lorraine to Pomerania to\r\nstone this counterfeit Moses. William II is in very truth casting\r\nagainst fate those terrible 'iron dice' to which the now-forgotten\r\nBismarck once alluded. If he win he may have within and without the\r\nfrontiers altars such as were raised to Augustus; should he lose,\r\nexile, the traditional exile, in England awaits him--a degraded exile,\r\nthe exile with which he so sternly threatens those who deny his\r\ninfallibility.\r\n\r\n\"M. Renan is therefore quite right: there is nothing more attractive\r\nat this period of the century than to witness the final development\r\nof William II. In the course of years (may God make them slow and\r\nlengthy!) this youth, ardent, pleasing, fertile in imagination, of\r\nsincere, perhaps heroic, soul, may be sitting in calm majesty in his\r\nBerlin Schloss presiding over the destinies of Europe--or he may be in\r\nthe Hôtel Métropole in London sadly unpacking from his exile's handbag\r\nthe battered double crown of Prussia and Germany.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis drama of a life is twenty-three years nearer its climax than it\r\nwas when Renan bade the world good night. With a certain finality of\r\npathos a Greek poet whom Renan loved, thinking doubtless of his unhappy\r\ncountrymen who had fallen in the long wars between Athens and Sparta,\r\nhad said: \"They that have died are not sick, nor do they possess\r\nany evil things.\" If this be true, quite possibly, then, the world\r\nwas kinder to this aged Frenchman than he shall ever know. For the\r\ndisasters which were to follow the rising star of the Emperor, which he\r\nregarded so curiously, were to be far greater than he had ever dreamed.\r\nIt may be, therefore, that it is he and not some of his younger\r\ncountrymen who are to be congratulated on the bournes which marked the\r\ntime of his coming and his passing.\r\n\r\nThe question of the responsibility of the Emperor and the limits of his\r\npower is one which perhaps only time can decide. Undeniably Germany\r\nhas a written Constitution. But that Constitution is of comparatively\r\nrecent date (April 16, 1871). It is not looked upon, as is the American\r\nConstitution, as the source of Germany's political life. It is the\r\nempire and not the Constitution that is holy. Struggles for personal\r\nliberty find little place in the history of Prussia. They have no\r\nCromwell, no Washington, no Robespierre, and, significantly too, they\r\nhave had in times past no Ravaillac and no Guiteau. There, still,\r\na certain majesty doth hedge about a king. The old idea of fealty,\r\nof _deutsche Treue_, which led the retainers of Teutonic chiefs or\r\nrulers to submit uncomplainingly to every abuse and all oppression and\r\nto follow their lords into misfortune and into exile, though it has\r\ndoubtless waned, nevertheless retains some vestiges of its traditional\r\nforce even to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, in 1878, by a curious coincidence, two attempts were\r\nmade upon the life of Emperor William I (one by Hödel, an irresponsible\r\nperson of diseased mind and body, who had been dismissed from the\r\nSocial Democratic party; and another by Nobiling, who was not a Social\r\nDemocrat), Bismarck immediately and easily seized this occasion to\r\ncrush Social Democracy and increase the imperial power. He dissolved\r\nthe Reichstag, and in one month the law-courts inflicted no less\r\nthan five hundred years of imprisonment for _lèse-majesté_. Within\r\neight months the authorities dissolved two hundred and twenty-two\r\nworkingmen's unions, suppressed one hundred and twenty-seven periodical\r\nand two hundred and seventy-eight other publications, and innumerable\r\n_bona-fide_ co-operative societies were compelled by the police to\r\nclose their doors without trial and with no possibility of appeal. With\r\nequal despatch numerous Social Democrats were expelled from Germany\r\non a few days' notice. This traditional attitude toward the Social\r\nDemocrat, who from our standpoint is the German radical and liberal,\r\nappears again in the present Emperor when he declares (May 14, 1889)\r\nthat every Social Democrat is synonymous with enemy of the country. How\r\nSocial Democracy has grown in spite of the Emperor's attempt to check\r\nit will be evident from a consideration of the following figures, in\r\nwhich the forty political parties are grouped into their four larger\r\ndivisions:\r\n\r\n  +----------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  |                |   1871  |   1881  |   1893  |   1907  |   1912  |\r\n  +----------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n  | Right, or      |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |   Conservative |  895,000|1,210,000|1,806,000|2,151,000|1,149,916|\r\n  | Liberal        |1,884,000|1,948,000|2,102,000|3,078,000|3,227,846|\r\n  | Clerical       |  973,000|1,618,000|1,920,000|2,779,000|2,012,990|\r\n  | Social         |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n  |   Democrats    |  124,000|  312,000|1,787,000|3,259,000|4,238,919|\r\n  +----------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nIn spite of this representation in the Reichstag, the power of the\r\nGerman political parties is slight. The power lies far more with the\r\nEmperor and the Bundesrat. According to Article II of the Constitution,\r\nthe Emperor represents the empire internationally and can declare\r\nwar if defensive (in German eyes the present is a defensive war),\r\ncan make peace as well as enter into treaties with other nations,\r\nand appoint and receive ambassadors. When treaties are related\r\nto matters regulated by imperial legislation, and when war is not\r\nmerely defensive, the Emperor must have the consent of the Bundesrat,\r\nin which, together with the Reichstag, are vested the legislative\r\nfunctions of the empire. But _de facto_, and through her power of veto,\r\nPrussia controls the Bundesrat, and as King of Prussia the Emperor\r\ncontrols Prussia.\r\n\r\nThat, even so, the Constitution is not the real and final source of\r\npolitical power, but a convenient political instrument, which in the\r\nmind of so great an authority as Bismarck might still easily be changed\r\nwithout consulting the people, we may gather from the fact that the\r\nGreat Chancellor frequently debated the question of limiting the\r\nsuffrage. \"The blind Hödhur[1] [the German elector] does not know how\r\nto manipulate in his coarse hands the Nuremberg toy [the Reichstag]\r\nwhich I gave him, and through his voting he is ruining the Fatherland.\"\r\nAccording to Hohenlohe, Bismarck considered setting aside the Reichstag\r\nand returning to the old Bundestag.\r\n\r\n[1] In Norse mythology Hödhur was the powerful blind god who slew\r\n    Balder.\r\n\r\nThe late Price Collier, an enthusiastic admirer of Germany, is\r\ntherefore quite justified in saying: \"This Reichstag is really only\r\nnominally a portion of the governing body. It has the right to\r\nrefuse a bill presented by the government, but if it does so it may\r\nbe summarily dismissed, as has happened several times, and another\r\nelection usually provides a more amenable body.\" And if the following\r\njudgment seems somewhat downright, it is none the less substantially\r\ntrue:\r\n\r\n\"The fact that the members of the Reichstag are not in the saddle but\r\nare used unwillingly and often contemptuously as a necessary and often\r\nstubborn and unruly pack-animal by the Kaiser-appointed ministers, the\r\nfact that they are pricked forward or induced to move by a tempting\r\nfeed held just beyond the nose has something to do, no doubt, with the\r\nlack of unanimity which exists. The diverse elements debate with one\r\nanother and waste their energy in rebukes and recriminations which\r\nlead nowhere and result in nothing. I have listened to many debates in\r\nthe Reichstag where the one aim of the speeches seemed to be merely\r\nto unburden the soul of the speaker. He had no plan, no proposal,\r\nno solution, merely a confession to make. After forty-odd years the\r\nGermans, in many ways the most cultivated nation in the world, are\r\nstill without real representative government.\"\r\n\r\nHistory, to be sure, may be read in many ways, but from one standpoint\r\nit is perfectly possible to regard the framing of the present\r\nConstitution and the building up of the present German Empire not as\r\nthe last stage in the attempt to give freedom and self-government to\r\nthe German people, but to guarantee and maintain the supremacy of\r\nPrussia. Whether or not this is a possible view, it is, in any case,\r\none occasionally to be found implied in the speeches of the Emperor,\r\nand it came to open expression in the statement of William I that\r\nthe empire was merely a \"greater Prussia.\" So, too, when a few years\r\nago Alsace-Lorraine proved itself recalcitrant to the wishes of its\r\nimperial master, he threatened that he would make of it a \"Prussian\r\nprovince.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[2] On this occasion a Socialist orator declared in the Reichstag: \"We\r\n    salute the imperial words as the confession, full of weight and\r\n    coming from a competent source, that annexation to Prussia is the\r\n    heaviest punishment that one can threaten to impose upon a people\r\n    for its resistance against Germany. It is a punishment like hard\r\n    labor in the penitentiary, with loss of civil rights.\"\r\n\r\nIt need, therefore, not appear as startling as would otherwise be the\r\ncase if on occasions which to us would seem peculiarly appropriate\r\n(as, for instance, the famous Königsberg speech, August 25, 1910) the\r\nEmperor makes no mention whatever of the Constitution. The sources\r\nof his power and the sanction for his authority he finds not in this\r\ninstrument but in the history of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nTo understand the personality and the speeches of the Emperor it is,\r\ntherefore, necessary to recall that he is also King of Prussia and\r\nthat the foundation of his ancestors' rule was laid in the province of\r\nBrandenburg, of which they became some centuries ago the margraves and\r\nelectors. In 1300 Prussia was a wilderness inhabited by savages who\r\nwere ruthlessly massacred by the Teutonic knights. It was looked upon\r\nas lying outside the German Empire. Through the knights the country\r\nwas converted to Christianity, and the reduced native population was\r\nlargely augmented by immigration from other German states.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Emperor is not slow to accept traditions with regard to\r\nhis house, he never mentions the old shoot in the genealogical tree of\r\nan elector which carries us back to one of the fugitives who fled from\r\nTroy with Æneas. For our purposes, it was not until 1273 that a count\r\nof Hohenzollern first came into prominence, when, after a fortunate\r\nmarriage, he became burgrave of Nuremberg and prince of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire. With the exception of Frederick William II, they have been\r\na thrifty race. A little more than a century later there appears in\r\nhistory that one of the Emperor's ancestors to whom he frequently\r\nrefers as the founder of his house and that one who began to acquire\r\nfor it divine right.\r\n\r\nFrederick VI of Hohenzollern had already come into prominence through\r\nthe fact that he had cast in his lot with King Sigismund of Hungary.\r\nThe services which he rendered the King, however valuable, were not\r\naltogether disinterested, and it is said that he largely increased his\r\nfortune thereby. He seems not to have been content with mere promises,\r\nand it is a matter of record that Sigismund pledged to him certain\r\ndistricts in Hungary as security for 40,000 gulden. As Frederick was to\r\nlay the foundation for the greatness of the house of Hohenzollern and\r\nas Emperor William is fond of repeating that he came to Brandenburg in\r\nobedience to a summons from on high, this chapter in the history of the\r\nEmperor's house is particularly significant and interesting.\r\n\r\nFor some time previously Brandenburg had been unfortunate in its rulers\r\nand had frequently changed hands. In 1373 it had been sold for 500,000\r\ngulden to Emperor Charles IV, who turned it over to his son Wenceslaus.\r\nIn 1378 it passed to Wenceslaus' half brother, the Sigismund mentioned\r\nabove. Sigismund was in financial difficulty. A few years later,\r\ntherefore, he pledged the mark of Brandenburg to his cousins Jobst and\r\nProcop of Moravia as security for a loan of 500,000 gulden. Sigismund\r\ndefaulted payment in 1393, so that the margraviate passed to them. In\r\n1410 Sigismund eagerly desired to be elected Emperor of Germany. He\r\nentrusted the management of what might quite properly be called his\r\n\"campaign\" to Frederick of Hohenzollern. Jobst of Moravia, who, as\r\nwe have seen, now had claims to Brandenburg was a rival candidate.\r\nSigismund, without deigning to make repayment, coolly declared that\r\nthe transaction with Jobst concerning Brandenburg was null and void\r\nand instructed Frederick to cast the vote for the mark. To this vote\r\nFrederick clearly (if anything in these complicated proceedings is\r\nclear) had no right. He none the less managed the campaign and in a\r\n\"snap\" election cast the vote of Brandenburg with assurance. This at\r\nleast was the view of other electors, and this high-handed performance\r\ndid not meet with their approval. They called a rival council and\r\nelected Jobst to the imperial dignity. For both Sigismund and Frederick\r\nit was \"fortunate\" (we take the word from the Prussian historian\r\nEberty) that Jobst died shortly after. It is perhaps unfortunate that\r\nit should have been suspected ever since that he died of poison.\r\n\r\nSigismund himself seems to have been somewhat doubtful about the\r\nvalidity of that election which Frederick had compassed and after the\r\ndeath of Jobst had himself re-elected and was finally acknowledged as\r\nEmperor. If the times were bad, Sigismund and Jobst were no better\r\nthan their times. It was this same Sigismund who, after having granted\r\na safe conduct to the great reformer John Huss, allowed him to be\r\njudicially murdered, a proceeding which made even Charles V blush for\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of electing Sigismund, Frederick had incurred\r\nconsiderable expense, amounting to some hundred thousand gulden. It\r\nis perhaps again fortunate for all concerned and for the honor of\r\nthe venal empire that no bill of particulars specifying the uses of\r\nthis fund is now available, if any was ever rendered. That Frederick,\r\nhowever, had not served Sigismund \"_pour l'amour de Dieu_\" is plain\r\nfrom the fact that he again took security for his advances. This time\r\nhe was given the unhappy mark of Brandenburg which, as we have seen,\r\nhad belonged to Jobst by virtue of a mortgage which Sigismund had never\r\ntaken the trouble to discharge.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the law of God is at all similar to the law recognized by\r\nmen, Sigismund had no right to give and the ancestor of William II no\r\nlegal right to accept that province. The right by which Frederick came\r\ninto possession of this first state of the later German Empire was,\r\nconsequently, a right quite different from rights generally recognized.\r\nThis, therefore, must be that \"divine right\" which William II is so\r\nfond of proclaiming. At its best, the document of June 7, 1411, which\r\ngave the Hohenzollerns their first claim to their first province was\r\nin reality a mortgage to a piece of property of doubtful title, and\r\nif the rather florid style of that document seems to bring in the\r\nbusiness transaction as something quite incidental, it is altogether\r\nsimilar to the forms in which other mortgages were couched in those\r\ndays. That this was so is further evidenced by the fact that the\r\nBrandenburg cities looked upon Frederick as the holder of a mortgage\r\nand did homage to him \"_zu seinem Gelde_\"--\"for his money\"; that is,\r\nthey recognized that they were bound to him only until he should be\r\npaid. The nobles did not do homage to him at all. After \"the rain of\r\nmargraves\" of the previous decades, it is not strange that they should\r\nhave been slow to recognize their latest overlord. Emperor William II\r\nis, therefore, quite right when he describes the mark of May, 1412, as\r\ndevastated, unruly, and altogether unpromising. It could hardly have\r\nbeen otherwise. Before Frederick was invested with Brandenburg (and he\r\nwas formally invested only after a further payment of 400,000 gulden),\r\nin 1417, his princely possessions included merely partial claims to\r\nsmaller districts like Ansbach and Bayreuth, which he shared with his\r\nbrother John. In spite of Frederick of Hohenzollern's devotion to the\r\ncause of religion, the Shakespearean motto, \"Thrift, thrift, Horatio,\"\r\nmay be taken to explain satisfactorily his conduct in this regard. That\r\nthe nobles would be unruly he must have expected. His own activities\r\nand his acceptance of the mark had helped to make them so. Frederick's\r\nlater service consisted in dispelling a confusion which he had helped\r\nto create.\r\n\r\nIn these larger transactions the first great Hohenzollern does not seem\r\nto have been given to listening to the still small voice. Incidentally,\r\nhe was later to turn against Sigismund. The assumption, therefore,\r\nthat he left his southern home for the mark out of heed for a divine\r\ncall, as Emperor William in his speech of February 3, 1899, tells us\r\nthat he did, is historically, like Laplace's God, a useless hypothesis.\r\nSelf-interest, for which he seems to have had a fairly keen sense,\r\nwould have impelled him to do no less. Yet it is upon the _faits et\r\ngestes_ of Frederick of Hohenzollern that Emperor William II bases his\r\nclaims to rule Germany by divine right.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the mortgage was not discharged, and Frederick had\r\nbeen formally invested with the margraviate and electorship in 1417.\r\nHe lifted the mark out of the deplorable condition in which he found\r\nit, compelled obedience, and during the period of his rule--he died\r\nin 1440--its lot was much improved and the power of the house of\r\nHohenzollern much strengthened. History must give him credit for his\r\nability and his difficult achievement if not for his motives.\r\n\r\nIn the process of establishing himself, his rule, like that of his\r\nsuccessors was the rule of the sword and his policy the _Machtpolitik_,\r\nor policy of force. In spite of her comparative poverty, therefore,\r\nPrussia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries maintained an army\r\nlarger than that of Austria or France. The connection between the ruler\r\nand the army in a state which was founded and maintained by force of\r\narms was, therefore, and remains in modern Prussia so close that the\r\nEmperor is from the standpoint of tradition justified in repeating\r\nthat \"the only pillar on which the empire rests is the army.\" It was\r\nliterally _ein Volk in Waffen_, a people in arms. The first really\r\noutstanding ruler of the province was the Great Elector (1620-88), who\r\nhas always been cited by William II as his model and of whom he speaks\r\nwith a respect that amounts to veneration.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Berlin and, after passing part of his youth in the\r\nNetherlands, became ruler of Brandenburg and Prussia in 1640, before\r\nthe close of the Thirty Years' War. He restored the prestige of the\r\narmy and centralized the government and, we are informed by recognized\r\nauthorities, by a clever but unscrupulous use of his intermediate\r\nposition between Sweden and Poland, procured his recognition as an\r\nindependent Duke of Prussia by both powers and eventually succeeded in\r\ncrushing the stubborn and protracted opposition which was offered to\r\nhis authority by the estates of the duchy. His success in organizing\r\nthe army was proved by his great victory over the Swedes at Fehrbellin,\r\n1675.\r\n\r\nFrom childhood the Emperor has worshipped the Great Elector as his\r\nfavorite hero. In their policies there is a striking similarity, for\r\nthe elector was the first to recognize the importance of sea power and\r\nis praised by William II for having founded the Prussian navy and for\r\nhaving encouraged commerce. He built the first great German canal,\r\nfrom the Oder to the Spree (another lead which the present Emperor\r\nwas to follow), and he inaugurated the colonial policy by founding\r\na settlement on the west African coast. This, likewise, was to be\r\nrevived by the present Emperor, for it was allowed to lapse even under\r\nFrederick the Great, who considered a \"village on the frontier\" a much\r\ngreater asset than a state oversea. The aim of the Great Elector was\r\nto make himself an absolute ruler, as he regarded this best for the\r\ninternal and external welfare of the state. But he raised Brandenburg\r\nand Prussia to a high place and laid the basis of their later power.\r\n\r\nUnder these lords and their followers the progress of Prussia was\r\namazingly rapid. In 1650, when London and Paris were cities of a\r\nlittle more or less than half a million inhabitants and Amsterdam\r\ncounted 300,000, Berlin was a village of 10,000. The population of\r\nPrussia itself, which, to be sure, had been more than doubled in size,\r\nincreased from 1,500,000 in 1688 to 19,000,000 in 1865. It was in the\r\ntime of Frederick the Great, however, that her power as a state was\r\nfirst firmly established. His military genius (he is usually said\r\nto have originated \"the oblique order\" of battle) and his policy of\r\ndissimulation here stood him in good stead. He sowed discord among\r\nhis neighbors and awaited the favorable opportunity to attack even on\r\nvery slight pretexts and in the case of Silesia without the formality\r\nof a declaration of war. Like William II, he was a patron of the arts\r\nand sciences and invited noted littérateurs and scientists, especially\r\nFrenchmen, to his court. The scientist Maupertuis and Voltaire were\r\nhis protégés, and the exiled Rousseau for a time found refuge in his\r\ndomains. He himself wrote in French. It is probably because of his\r\nFrench sympathies and the fact that he was, in this regard, not a\r\n_kerndeutscher Mann_ that William II rarely speaks of him personally\r\nand mentions usually only his services to his country.\r\n\r\nFrederick died in 1786. He had raised Prussia to the position of a\r\nfirst-rate power and, in Disraeli's phrase, left it \"regarded if not\r\nrespected.\" His successor, Frederick William II, is remembered mostly\r\nbecause of the scandalous character of his life, and he showed none\r\nof the characteristics of the energetic Hohenzollerns. A contemporary\r\nsays of him: \"He bears the greatest resemblance to an Asiatic prince,\r\nwho, living within his harem with his slaves of both sexes, leaves\r\nthe business of the state to his viziers. The wall, twelve feet in\r\nheight, by which the new garden at Potsdam is enclosed, reminds one of\r\nthe enclosure of a seraglio.\" He was succeeded by his son, Frederick\r\nWilliam III, in 1797. This conscientious but ill-starred ruler was to\r\nbe rendered famous through his misfortunes in the time of Napoleon and\r\nhas been overshadowed somewhat in history by his beautiful, devoted,\r\nand heroic wife Louise. They stand closer to modern history than is\r\ngenerally realized. The present Emperor often mentions them for their\r\nheroism and the brave part they played in the War of Liberation and\r\nin freeing their country from the incubus of the Napoleonic Empire.\r\nThey were the parents of Emperor William I, the illustrious grandfather\r\nof the present sovereign. If, then, Emperor William II frequently\r\ntakes occasion to recall the memory of 1813 it should be remembered\r\nthat in his own family these events were very near to him, since his\r\ngrandfather had spent his childhood in those years of humiliation and\r\nhad served in the allied armies in the time of Napoleon. The man who\r\nwas to become Emperor William I had been born as the second son of\r\nFrederick William III in 1797. He was to be preceded on the throne by\r\nhis elder brother, Frederick William IV, who, like the present Emperor\r\nand like Frederick the Great, was an accomplished lover of the arts,\r\nbut who lacked the strength to guide his country with a sure hand\r\nthrough the troubled years of the forties. He became afflicted in his\r\nlast years with hopeless mental disease, and his brother, after having\r\nserved as regent, became King of Prussia as William I in 1861.\r\n\r\nThe idea of uniting Germany into a single empire had already been\r\nseriously agitated in the time of Frederick William IV, but it\r\nwas under his brother, largely through the tireless activity and\r\nwonderfully successful diplomacy of Bismarck, that this great aim was\r\nto be achieved in the lifetime of the present Emperor. It was in\r\nthe chapel at Königsberg that William I arranged for and held his\r\ncoronation. He cannot be said to have been crowned; for although his\r\nbrother had granted Prussia a constitution William himself raised the\r\ncrown from the altar, set it on his own head, and announced in a loud\r\nvoice: \"I receive this crown from God's hand and from none other.\"\r\n\r\nIt was such a legacy that the present Emperor inherited when, after\r\nthe few months' reign of his father, he succeeded to the imperial\r\noffice; and it is this legacy and this tradition which, in fairness\r\nto the Emperor, we must remember in reading such seemingly strange\r\npronouncements as his own address at Königsberg in 1910.\r\n\r\nThe later events in German history and the subsequent policies of the\r\nempire are touched upon in such detail that further preamble is hardly\r\nnecessary. That the Emperor has everywhere energetically taken the lead\r\nis undoubted. That he should be held responsible in general for German\r\ndiplomacy is implied in his position. That he has urged and directed\r\nthe movement in nearly every field of endeavor is plain from the varied\r\ncharacter of his addresses. No one can doubt after reading him that\r\nhe desired peace, in the sense that he preferred peace to war. The\r\nquestion that will undoubtedly interest the reader most is the problem\r\nof the consistency of his various policies; whether, for instance, the\r\nexaggerated worship of the army, the devout desire for peace, and the\r\ninsistent imperialism of his later years can be brought into harmony;\r\nwhether they can be reduced to any common denominator. However that may\r\nbe, that he has been one of the most devoted and conscientious servants\r\nof the German cause as he sees it cannot possibly be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARIES\r\n\r\nJUNE 15, 1888--OCTOBER 30, 1889\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OFFICIAL ACT OF THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\nSCHLOSS FRIEDRICHSKRON, JUNE 15, 1888\r\n\r\n    The aged Emperor William I, grandfather of William II, departed\r\n    this life March 9, 1888. He was succeeded by his son, Frederick\r\n    III, who, after a reign of only a few months, died on June 15 of\r\n    the same year. The present Emperor, who was born on January 27,\r\n    1859, was, therefore, twenty-nine at the time of his accession to\r\n    the throne. It is characteristic that his first official act should\r\n    have been an order to the army.\r\n\r\n    The close connection between the army and the Prussian Kings is a\r\n    tradition which William II sedulously maintained. In later speeches\r\n    he will frequently give evidence of this desire on his part and\r\n    will quote characteristic sayings of his ancestors to the effect\r\n    that the army is the \"_rocher de bronze_,\" that it is \"the only\r\n    pillar on which the empire rests.\" He will repeat to the army\r\n    officers that phrase of his grandfather: \"These are the gentlemen\r\n    upon whom I can rely.\"\r\n\r\n    If the extraordinary versatility of William II is one of his most\r\n    striking qualities, a reading of his speeches will convince us\r\n    that it is none the less true that he is first and foremost a\r\n    soldier. By far the great majority of his speeches are on military\r\n    occasions, and it is the martial triumphs of his ancestors that he\r\n    is most fond of commemorating. He seems to be most at home with\r\n    his officers, and although at one time or another differences have\r\n    arisen between him and every party or caste in the empire, even\r\n    including the Prussian nobility, this close relationship with the\r\n    army has never been clouded by even a momentary estrangement.\r\n    More than any other one subject, army reviews have provided the\r\n    occasion for his speeches. If but a few of these are given here\r\n    it is because his sentiments in this regard have suffered no\r\n    change and these addresses are largely repetitions of his sense\r\n    of satisfaction and the expression of his good-will. That he\r\n    intended to be the virtual leader of his own host is perhaps best\r\n    indicated by the fact that Von Moltke (who was, to be sure, an old\r\n    man) resigned six weeks after his accession to the throne. The\r\n    present war has proved his capacity in this regard, and the army\r\n    has certainly lost nothing in efficiency and has probably gained\r\n    somewhat in confidence since he took over the direction from his\r\n    ancestors and their advisers. The present order was issued on\r\n    the very day of his father's death. On that same date a somewhat\r\n    similar proclamation was addressed to the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE EMPEROR IN THE YEAR OF HIS CORONATION, 1888\r\n    [Age 29]]\r\n\r\n\r\nEven ere you, my troops, had put aside the external signs of mourning\r\nfor your Emperor and King, William I, who lives ever in your hearts,\r\nyou are called upon to suffer another heavy blow through the death this\r\nmorning, at five minutes past eleven, of my dear and deeply beloved\r\nfather, his Majesty, the Emperor and King, Frederick III.\r\n\r\nIt is in these serious days of mourning that God's will places me at\r\nthe head of the army, and it is from a heart stirred deeply, indeed,\r\nthat I address my first words to my troops.\r\n\r\nI enter with implicit confidence, however, upon this duty to which God\r\nhas called me; for I know what a sense for honor and duty has been\r\nimplanted in the army by my glorious ancestors, and I know to what\r\ndegree this sense has ever and at all times displayed itself.\r\n\r\nThe absolutely inviolable dependence upon the war lord [_Kriegsherr_]\r\nis, in the army, the inheritance which descends from father to\r\nson, from generation to generation. I would direct your gaze to my\r\ngrandfather, who stands before the eyes of all of you, the glorious war\r\nlord, worthy of all honor--a spectacle more beautiful than any other\r\nand one which speaks most tellingly to our hearts; I would direct your\r\ngaze to my dear father, who even as Crown Prince won for himself a\r\ndistinguished place in the annals of the army, and to a long succession\r\nof famous ancestors whose names are resplendent in history and whose\r\nhearts beat warmly for the army.\r\n\r\nSo are we bound together--I and the army--so are we born for one\r\nanother, and so shall we hold together indissolubly, whether, as God\r\nwills, we are to have peace or storm.\r\n\r\nYou are now about to swear to me the oath of fidelity and obedience,\r\nand I vow that I shall ever be mindful of the fact that the eyes of my\r\nforefathers look down upon me from that other world and that I one day\r\nshall have to render up to them an account of the fame and the honor of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\n                                                      WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n  CASTLE FRIEDRICHSKRON, June 15, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY PEOPLE\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, JUNE 18, 1888\r\n\r\n    Three days after his pronouncements to the army and navy Emperor\r\n    William II issued the following proclamation to his people. In\r\n    temperament the son was quite unlike his father. The wife of\r\n    Frederick I and the mother of the present Emperor was an English\r\n    princess, Victoria (daughter of Queen Victoria), and through her\r\n    Frederick is generally said to have been influenced by the more\r\n    liberal English tradition. Critics of William II have occasionally\r\n    annoyed him by repeating, justly or unjustly, that his father\r\n    regarded certain elements in his character with disapproval.\r\n    However that may be, it is true that the people regarded Frederick\r\n    in a different light from that in which they have come to regard\r\n    his son. In reading the speeches of William II one is conscious\r\n    of the fact that he is speaking from a certain eminence, that the\r\n    Emperor never forgets that he enjoys the advantage of position.\r\n    He has, therefore, put between himself and his people a certain\r\n    distance which did not exist in the case of his father. The father\r\n    treated his subjects as if he were one of them, and it is this fact\r\n    that led them fondly to call him \"_Unser Fritz_.\" However great the\r\n    respect which they feel for the son, none of his subjects would\r\n    think of bestowing any such title on William II, and, even if they\r\n    did, it is doubtful whether he would feel in any way complimented\r\n    thereby. He is in this respect more like his ancestor Frederick the\r\n    Great than like his father or grandfather, and it is a striking\r\n    fact that in all his speeches he never once mentions this somewhat\r\n    familiar title, of which his father was proud.\r\n\r\nGod has again hung about us the pall of deepest mourning. Hardly had\r\nthe grave closed upon my ever-memorable grandfather, than his Majesty,\r\nmy dearly beloved father, was called from this earthly sojourn to\r\neverlasting peace. The heroic energy, born of Christian humility, with\r\nwhich, unmindful of his sufferings, he accomplished his royal duties\r\nseemed to leave room for the hope that he would be spared still longer\r\nto the Fatherland. God has willed it otherwise. To the royal sufferer\r\nwhose heart was moved by all that was great and beautiful, only a few\r\nmonths were allotted in which he might display upon the throne the\r\nnoble qualities of heart and soul which have won for him the love of\r\nhis people. The virtues which adorned him and the victories which he\r\ngained on fields of battle will be gratefully remembered as long as\r\nGerman hearts beat, and undying fame will illumine his knightly figure\r\nin the history of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nCalled to the throne of my fathers, I have taken over the government,\r\nlooking to the King of all kings, and have vowed to God, following the\r\nexample of my father, to be a righteous and gentle prince, to foster\r\npiety and the fear of God, to maintain peace, to further the welfare of\r\nthe country, to be a help to the poor and oppressed, and to be to the\r\nrighteous man a true protector.\r\n\r\nIf I pray God for strength to fulfil these royal duties which He has\r\nlaid upon me, I am buoyed up by that faith in the Prussian people\r\nwhich a consideration of our past history confirms in me. In good\r\nand in evil days Prussia's people have ever stood faithfully to their\r\nkings. I, too, count upon this fidelity, which has ever been preserved\r\ninviolable toward my fathers in all times of trial and danger; for\r\nI am conscious that I reciprocate it whole-heartedly, as a faithful\r\nprince of a faithful people, and that we are both equally strong in our\r\ndevotion to a common Fatherland. From this consciousness of the mutual\r\nlove which binds me to my people, I derive the confidence that God\r\nwill give me wisdom and strength to exercise my kingly office for the\r\nwelfare of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\n                                                      WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n  POTSDAM, June 18, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DECLARATION OF POLICY\r\n\r\nBERLIN, JUNE 25, 1888\r\n\r\n    After the death of Frederick III the Reichstag was summoned to\r\n    meet in extraordinary session. Most of the affiliated sovereigns\r\n    of the German states assembled to pay homage to the youthful\r\n    Emperor. On this occasion he made from the throne a declaration\r\n    of policy which is interesting as showing his ideas before he was\r\n    subjected to the pressure of events. Before he had succeeded to\r\n    the throne it had been generally reported, possibly because of\r\n    his known fondness for the army, that he was by nature bellicose.\r\n    This report seriously distressed the new sovereign, and he began\r\n    his reign with declarations, which have often been renewed since,\r\n    that he would work for peace. He likewise outlines his foreign\r\n    policy and expresses the hope that he may further develop friendly\r\n    relations with Russia. In this he was to achieve but little\r\n    success, and a few years later the agreement which bound Russia\r\n    to observe neutrality in case Germany were involved in war was\r\n    allowed to lapse, much to the disgust of Bismarck, who at that time\r\n    had been superseded by Caprivi. Frederick the Great had warned\r\n    his successors that in the future, in case Prussia wished to wage\r\n    any war, she would first have to assure herself of the neutrality\r\n    of Russia. Bismarck had followed this policy and had established\r\n    it on the basis of an agreement. As the relationship to Russia\r\n    was to be of particular consequence, it will be interesting to\r\n    have before us an article which appeared October 26, 1896, in the\r\n    _Hamburger Nachrichten_, recognized as expressing the views of the\r\n    great Chancellor. It announces that already in Bismarck's time\r\n    the wire between Berlin and St. Petersburg was cut and takes up\r\n    certain events of the year 1890. \"Up to this time,\" we are told,\r\n    \"both empires were fully agreed that in case one of them should be\r\n    attacked the other would preserve a benevolent neutrality. After\r\n    the departure of Bismarck this agreement was not renewed, and if we\r\n    are correctly informed about events in Berlin, it was not Russia,\r\n    piqued at the change in chancellors, but Count Caprivi who declined\r\n    to continue this mutual assurance, while Russia was prepared to do\r\n    so.\"\r\n\r\n    Emperor William's announcement with regard to his personal\r\n    friendship and the interests of the realm may be taken as heralding\r\n    a new era in German foreign policy. He inaugurated what has been\r\n    called \"personal diplomacy,\" and felt that it was possible to\r\n    arrange the relationships between states by personally visiting\r\n    and conferring with other sovereigns. Shortly after his accession,\r\n    therefore, he set out on a tour of the European capitals. Bismarck,\r\n    who planned his foreign relations on the basis of race psychology\r\n    and possible future clashes of interests, opposed this strenuously.\r\n    The visit to St. Petersburg (19th to 24th of July, 1888) gave rise\r\n    to certain unpleasant scenes and was only returned by the Czar\r\n    in a very perfunctory manner fifteen months later (October 11,\r\n    1889). The effect of the friendly attentions shown the Czar on this\r\n    occasion was doubtless weakened by the fact that, less than three\r\n    weeks later, Emperor William felt called upon to visit the Sultan,\r\n    by whom he was most enthusiastically received in Constantinople.\r\n    Even though the Emperor was most sincere in his desire to preserve\r\n    friendship with Russia, events were to prove that his method of\r\n    cultivating diplomatic relations was far less successful than\r\n    Bismarck's way of working in silence and waiting for events.\r\n\r\n    With regard to the internal administration of the realm, the\r\n    problem that seemed most pressing to William II was the rapid\r\n    growth of the Social Democratic party. This problem had already\r\n    engaged the attention of William I and of Bismarck, who recognized\r\n    its gravity. But here, too, the Emperor and Chancellor were\r\n    to disagree. The former felt that he could easily master the\r\n    situation, as may be seen from his remark to Bismarck: \"Leave the\r\n    Social Democrats to me.\" He was doubtless sincerely concerned for\r\n    the welfare of the laborer and recognized in it one of the sources\r\n    of the prosperity of the state. His policy was to be patriarchal\r\n    and, bluntly put in Shakespearian phrase, amounted to giving them\r\n    medicine to make them love him. But if, to change the metaphor, he\r\n    offered them his hand in a velvet glove, they were, as may be seen\r\n    from his speech, soon to discover that it was a hand of iron.\r\n\r\nHONORED GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI greet you with deep sorrow in my heart, and I know that you grieve\r\nwith me. The recent memory of my late father's sufferings, the\r\nastounding fact that three months after the death of his Majesty,\r\nEmperor William I, I am called upon to mount the throne, arouses the\r\nsame feeling in the hearts of all Germans, and our grief has found a\r\nsympathetic response in all countries of the world. Under the weight of\r\nthis sorrow, I pray God to give me strength to fulfil the high office\r\nto which His will has called me.\r\n\r\nAs I follow this command I have before my eyes the example which\r\nEmperor William bequeathed to his successors when, after serious wars,\r\nhe ruled with a love of peace. This same example the reign of my late\r\nfather strove to maintain in so far as he was not thwarted in his aims\r\nby his illness and death.\r\n\r\nI have called you together, Honored Gentlemen, in order in your\r\npresence to announce to the German people that I am determined, as\r\nEmperor and as King, to follow in that same path by which my late\r\ngrandfather won for himself the trust of his allies, the love of the\r\nGerman people, and the kindly recognition of foreign countries. It lies\r\nwith God whether I shall be successful in this or not; but earnestly\r\nshall I strive to that end.\r\n\r\nThe most important tasks of the German Emperor lie in the province of\r\nestablishing military and political safety for the realm from without\r\nand in supervising the execution of the laws of the empire within. The\r\nConstitution of the empire forms the highest of these laws. To guard\r\nand defend it and all those rights which it secures to both of the\r\nlegislative bodies[3] of the nation and to every German citizen, as\r\nwell as those which it secures to the Emperor and to each of the states\r\nof the union, and to the reigning princes, is the most important right\r\nand duty of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[3] Bundesrat and Reichstag.\r\n\r\nWith regard to legislation in the realm, according to the Constitution\r\nI am called upon to act more in my capacity as King of Prussia than\r\nin that as the German Emperor; but in both it will be my aim to carry\r\nout the work of imperial legislation in the same spirit in which my\r\nlate grandfather began it. Especially do I take to heart in its fullest\r\napplication the message published by him on November 17, 1881,[4] and\r\nshall proceed in that spirit to bring it about that the legislation for\r\nthe working population shall make more secure the protection which,\r\nin accordance with the principles of Christian ethics, it can afford\r\nthe weak and oppressed in the struggle for existence. I hope it may\r\nbe possible in this way more nearly to eliminate unhealthy social\r\ndistinctions, and I cherish the hope that in fostering our internal\r\nwelfare I shall receive the harmonious support of all true subjects of\r\nthe realm, without division of party.\r\n\r\n[4] As this message of Emperor William I was practically the beginning\r\n    of labor legislation in Germany and is several times referred\r\n    to, its significant portion is given below. Emperor William I\r\n    had already failed in his policy of crushing Socialism through\r\n    drastic measures of repression. He was now to initiate a policy of\r\n    attempting to kill it with kindness. In spite of certain admirable\r\n    provisions, this too was to fail. The Social Democrats had learned\r\n    from bitter experience that they did not enjoy the good-will of\r\n    either the grandfather or the grandson, and for this reason the\r\n    projects of social legislation were looked upon with suspicion and\r\n    accepted without enthusiasm. The awkward and compromising nature of\r\n    the Emperor's position is evident in the preamble.\r\n\r\n    \"Already in February of this year we expressed the conviction\r\n    that the healing of social grievances was not to be sought\r\n    exclusively in the repression of Social Democratic excesses, but\r\n    also in the direct advancement of the welfare of the laborer.\r\n    We hold it to be our royal duty to impress this matter upon the\r\n    Reichstag, and we would look back with greater satisfaction upon\r\n    all the achievements with which God has blessed our reign if we\r\n    could carry away with us the conviction that we had left to the\r\n    Fatherland new and lasting pledges of internal peace and to those\r\n    in need of help greater security and provisions for support,\r\n    upon which they may make rightful claim. In our attempts to this\r\n    end we are sure of the support of all the affiliated governments\r\n    and count upon the support of the Reichstag without distinction\r\n    of parties. To this end a draft of a bill for the protection of\r\n    laborers against accidents, which was presented by the affiliated\r\n    governments in the previous session, will be reformulated in view\r\n    of the discussions held in the Reichstag and will be offered for\r\n    further consideration. As a supplement to it, a project will be\r\n    brought forward which proposes a similar organization of the funds\r\n    for laboring men's sick insurance. But those, too, who on account\r\n    of age or infirmity are no longer able to work have just claim\r\n    upon the community for a higher degree of governmental protection\r\n    than it has previously been possible to accord them. To find the\r\n    proper ways and means for making such provision is one of the most\r\n    difficult but one of the highest tasks of any society which is\r\n    based upon the foundations of a Christian national life. By calling\r\n    upon the sources of this strong national life and organizing it\r\n    into incorporated associations under state protection we hope to\r\n    bring about the solution of problems which the state alone could\r\n    not solve with the same success. But even in this way the goal\r\n    cannot be reached without the employment of important means.\"\r\n\r\nI hold it, however, likewise my duty to see to it that our political\r\nand social development proceeds according to law and to meet with\r\nfirmness any attempt which aims at undermining the order of the state.\r\n\r\nIn foreign politics I am determined to keep peace with every one in\r\nso far as in me lies. My love for the German army and my position in\r\nit will never lead me into the temptation of robbing the country of\r\nthe benefits of peace, unless some attack upon the empire, or her\r\nallies, forces war upon us. The army is to make our peace secure; yet\r\nif that should, nevertheless, be threatened, the army will be able to\r\nre-establish it with honor. And it will be able to do so by reason\r\nof the strength which it has received from the last army bill, which\r\nyou voted unanimously. To make use of that force to wage a war of\r\naggression lies far from my thoughts. Germany needs no new martial\r\nglory nor any conquest of whatever sort after she has, once for all,\r\nestablished her right to exist as a single and independent nation.\r\n\r\nOur alliance with Austria-Hungary is publicly known; I hold fast to\r\nthis in German faith not only because it is concluded but because I\r\nperceive in this defensive alliance a basis for European balance of\r\npower as well as a legacy from German history. The public opinion of\r\nthe entire German people supports this alliance, and it is founded\r\nupon the European law of nations, as it prevailed undisputed until\r\n1866. Similar historical relations, and the fact that we have similar\r\nnational needs to-day, ally us with Italy. Both nations wish to\r\nhold fast to the blessings of peace in order to devote themselves\r\nundisturbed to the strengthening of their newly acquired unity, to the\r\ndevelopment of their national institutions, and to the furtherance of\r\ntheir prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo my great satisfaction, our existing agreements with Austria-Hungary\r\nand Italy permit me to foster carefully my personal friendship for\r\nthe Russian Emperor and the friendly relations which have existed for\r\na hundred years with the neighboring Russian Empire, a course which\r\naccords with my own feelings as well as with the interests of Germany.\r\n\r\nI stand as ready to serve the Fatherland in the conscientious promotion\r\nof peace as in the care for our army and rejoice in the traditional\r\nrelations with foreign powers through which my efforts in the former\r\ndirection are being furthered.\r\n\r\nTrusting in God and in the ability of our people to defend themselves,\r\nI entertain the hope that for an appreciable time we may be allowed to\r\npreserve and strengthen through peaceful labor what my two predecessors\r\non the throne had acquired through their efforts on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE REICHSTAG\r\n\r\nBERLIN, NOVEMBER 22, 1888\r\n\r\n    The first months of the Emperor's reign were devoted largely\r\n    to visiting the heads of the confederated German states and in\r\n    cultivating the acquaintance of foreign rulers. His main purpose,\r\n    as he tells us on a later occasion, was to combat the idea that it\r\n    was his intention to enter upon a career of war.\r\n\r\n    The workingman's insurance act, which has been referred to, was\r\n    one of the most important legislative provisions ever made in the\r\n    interests of labor. The cost of this insurance was distributed\r\n    between the employer, the employed, and the state. In spite of its\r\n    undoubted benefits, it had failed to disarm the Social Democrats,\r\n    and the party had continued to increase. They complained that\r\n    the proportion of the cost borne by them was too great, and, as\r\n    they had been previously and were soon again to be treated as\r\n    enemies, they were inclined to look upon it as a bribe. By his\r\n    \"social-political\" legislation the Emperor meant to forestall the\r\n    Socialist programme. When this well-intentioned movement failed to\r\n    dissolve the party, which continued to increase, he was not slow to\r\n    show his resentment.\r\n\r\nHONORED GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nWhen I greeted you for the first time, at the beginning of my reign,\r\nyou stood with me under the weight of the severe visitations which my\r\nhouse and the empire have experienced in the course of the present\r\nyear. The sorrow over this loss will never be wholly extinguished\r\nduring the lifetime of the present generation, but it cannot hinder me\r\nfrom following in the footsteps of my late ancestors and completely\r\nfulfilling the demands of duty with manly vigor and fidelity.\r\n\r\nBuoyed up by this sense of duty and assuming that this exists in you to\r\nthe same degree, I give you my greeting and bid you welcome as we again\r\ntake up our common labors.\r\n\r\nMy travels have carried me into different parts of the empire, and\r\neverywhere I have found evidences, both on the part of my exalted\r\ncolleagues and of the people, that the princes and the population\r\nof Germany are, with absolute trust, devoted to the empire and its\r\ninstitutions and find the pledge of safety in their union. From such\r\ntestimony you have doubtless come to the conclusion, no less satisfying\r\nto you than to me, that the organic union which now binds the empire\r\ntogether has taken deep and firm rooting in the people at large. I\r\ntherefore feel the need of gratefully expressing on this occasion the\r\npleasure which it gives me.\r\n\r\nIt fills me with great satisfaction that, after difficult and laborious\r\nnegotiations, the inclusion of the free Hanseatic cities, Hamburg and\r\nBremen, into the customs union of the empire has now been realized.\r\nI see in this the blessed fruit of our combined efforts. May the\r\nexpectations which we count upon from this extension of the empire's\r\ncustoms districts be realized in fullest measure, both for the empire\r\nand for these two most important seacoast towns!\r\n\r\nThe government of the Swiss Federation has suggested a revision of the\r\ncommercial treaty between Germany and Switzerland. Filled with the\r\ndesire of confirming the existing friendly relations between the two\r\ncountries and of extending them also into the realm of their commercial\r\npolicies, I stand ready to meet their proposal. The negotiations have\r\nbeen conducted through the offices of representatives from the states\r\nbordering upon Switzerland, and their result consists in a further\r\nagreement through which the treaty regulations for reciprocal trade\r\nwill be extended and the exchange of industrial products will be made\r\neasier. After its successful acceptance by the Bundesrat the agreement\r\nwill be presented to you with the proposal, in order that you may\r\nbestow upon it your constitutional sanction.\r\n\r\nThe budget for the next fiscal year will be laid before you without\r\ndelay. The draft gives proof of the satisfactory condition of the\r\nimperial finances. As a result of the reforms instituted in the\r\nlast few years, with your co-operation, in the way of tariffs and\r\ninternal revenues, surplus receipts may be expected, and upon this\r\nbasis we shall not only be provided with a new means of fulfilling\r\nthe inevitable obligations of the empire but it may be possible for\r\nour constituent states to expect an increase of means for their own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nI greet with joy the signs of a revival of economic activity in various\r\nfields. Even though the pressure which bears upon the farmer is not\r\nyet relieved, nevertheless, as I look forward to the possibility which\r\nhas lately appeared of a greater utilization of certain agricultural\r\nproducts, I hope that an amelioration also of this most powerful branch\r\nof our industrial work will be brought about.\r\n\r\nThe bill which has already been announced on the regulation of the\r\nindustrial and agricultural societies will be laid before you for your\r\ndecision. It is to be hoped that the enfranchising of associations with\r\nlimited liability which the bill proposes will prove itself beneficial\r\nin increasing agricultural credit.\r\n\r\nCertain shortcomings which have appeared in connection with the\r\ninsurance against sickness call for legal remedy. The necessary\r\npreliminary investigations for this have so far progressed as to make\r\nit possible, in all probability, to lay before you in the course of\r\nthis session an adequate presentation of the case.\r\n\r\nAs a precious legacy from my grandfather, I have taken over the problem\r\nof carrying out the social-political legislation begun by him. I do not\r\nallow myself to be carried away by the hope that through legal measures\r\nthe exigencies of our time and human misery can be abolished from\r\nthe world. I judge it to be a duty, however, of the executive power\r\nto strive with all its faculties toward the mitigation of existing\r\nindustrial grievances and through organized measures to emphasize\r\nthe fact that love of our neighbor, which has its foundations in\r\nChristianity itself, should be a recognized duty of the entire state.\r\nThe difficulties which stand in the way of the state's assisting in\r\nthe universal insurance of all workers against the dangers of age and\r\nsickness are great; but, with God's help, they are not insurmountable.\r\nAs the result of extensive investigations a bill will be presented to\r\nyou which reveals a possible means of attaining this end.\r\n\r\nOur settlements in Africa have imposed upon the German Empire the duty\r\nof converting that part of the world to a Christian civilization. The\r\nfriendly government of England and her Parliament has known for a\r\nhundred years that the fulfilment of this obligation must begin with\r\ncombating the hunting of slaves and the trade in negroes. I have,\r\ntherefore, sought and concluded an understanding with England, whose\r\nmeaning and aim you shall learn. On it depend further negotiations with\r\nother friendly and interested governments and further proposals for the\r\nReichstag.\r\n\r\nOur relations with all foreign governments are peaceful, and my efforts\r\nare continually directed toward cementing this peace. Our treaties\r\nwith Austria and Italy have no other aim. It is incompatible with my\r\nChristian faith and with the duties which as Emperor I have assumed\r\ntoward the people needlessly to bring upon Germany the sorrows of a\r\nwar, even of a victorious one. In this conviction I have looked upon\r\nit as my duty soon after I ascended the throne to greet not only my\r\naffiliated rulers within the realm but also the friendly neighboring\r\nsovereigns. I have sought to find an understanding with them concerning\r\nthe fulfilment of this trust which God has placed upon us, of\r\npreserving, so far as in us lies, the peace and welfare of our people.\r\nThe confidence with which I and my policies have been received at all\r\nthe courts which I have visited leads me to hope that, with God's help,\r\nI and my allies and my friends will succeed in preserving the peace of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND THE STRIKING MINERS\r\n\r\nBERLIN, MAY 14, 1889\r\n\r\n    The Emperor's change of attitude toward the Socialists is evident\r\n    from his conduct in the conflict which had arisen in the Rhenish\r\n    and Westphalian coal districts between the miners and their\r\n    employers. He personally received delegations from both sides. The\r\n    miners' delegation consisted of Schröder (spokesman), Siegel, and\r\n    Bunte. In answer to Schröder's speech, the Emperor announced:\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that every subject, when he presents a wish or\r\na petition, has the ear of his Emperor. Of this I have given evidence\r\nin that I have invited the deputation to come here and to set forth\r\ntheir wishes in person. You have, however, placed yourselves in the\r\nwrong, because your agitation is unlawful for no other reason than the\r\nfact that the fourteen days of warning have not yet expired, after\r\nwhich the workers would have been legally justified in ceasing work.\r\nIn consequence of this you are guilty of breaking a contract. It is\r\nself-evident that this breach of contract has angered and injured the\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nFurther, there are workers who do not wish to strike and who, either\r\nthrough force or by means of threats, are hindered from continuing\r\ntheir work. Also, certain of the workers have seized upon organs of\r\nthe authorities and upon property which did not belong to them and\r\nhave even, in individual cases, offered resistance to the military\r\nforce called to protect them. Finally, you wish that work should be\r\ngenerally resumed again only when your combined demands shall have\r\nbeen fulfilled at all the mines.\r\n\r\nAs for the demands themselves, I shall, through my government,\r\ncarefully examine them and have the results of the investigation\r\ndelivered to you through the appointed authorities. Should, however,\r\nthere occur transgressions against the public order and peace, or\r\nshould the agitation ally itself with the Social Democrats, then I\r\nshould not be in a position to reconcile your wishes with my good-will\r\nas ruler. For, to me, every Social Democrat is synonymous with an enemy\r\nof the realm and of the Fatherland. Should I, therefore, discover that\r\nSocial-Democratic tendencies become involved in the agitation and\r\ninstigate unlawful opposition, I will step in sternly and ruthlessly\r\nand bring to bear all the power that I possess--and it is great.\r\n\r\nNow go to your homes, think over what I have said, and seek to\r\ninfluence your comrades to reflection. Above all, however, you must\r\nnot, under any circumstances, hinder your comrades who wish to return\r\nto their work.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT OF THE KING OF ITALY\r\n\r\nBERLIN, MAY 22, 1889\r\n\r\n    At the time of the great spring review of this year, King Humbert\r\n    came to Berlin to return the Emperor's visit. A state banquet was\r\n    held, at which the Emperor proposed the following toast to the King\r\n    of Italy:\r\n\r\nMay it please your Majesty to accept from me and my people our\r\nheartiest thanks for the proof of the friendship which your Majesty has\r\ngiven me by this visit!\r\n\r\nMy troops, likewise, are filled with grateful pride that they have been\r\nable to conduct themselves with honor in the eyes of your Majesty, an\r\nexperienced soldier.\r\n\r\nFull of the happy remembrance of the army manoeuvres at Rome, I raise\r\nmy glass and drink to the health of your Majesty and of her Majesty,\r\nthe Queen; to the health of your brave troops as well as to the\r\nunchanging friendship with the house of Savoy, whose motto, \"_Sempre\r\navanti, Savoja_,\" has led to the unification of the kingdom of Italy.\r\nLong live his Majesty, King Humbert!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH FLEET AND THE GERMAN ARMY\r\n\r\nSANDOWN BAY, AUGUST 5, 1889\r\n\r\n    On this date the Emperor was created admiral of the English fleet\r\n    by Queen Victoria. On the same day he was present at a regatta on\r\n    Sandown Bay, where he replied as follows to a toast offered by the\r\n    Prince of Wales:\r\n\r\nI prize most highly the honor which has been shown me by the Queen in\r\nappointing me admiral of the English fleet. I sincerely rejoice to have\r\nseen the manoeuvres of the fleet, which I consider the finest in the\r\nworld. Germany possesses an army which answers to her needs, and if the\r\nBritish nation possesses a fleet sufficient for the needs of England,\r\nthis in itself will be considered by Europe in general as a weighty\r\nfactor in the maintenance of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH ARMY\r\n\r\nALDERSHOT, AUGUST 7, 1889\r\n\r\n    On his mother's side, who was a princess royal of England, the\r\n    Emperor was a grandson of Queen Victoria, to whom he paid frequent\r\n    visits and whom he held in high regard. William II began his\r\n    reign with cordial feelings toward his island neighbors. If the\r\n    friendship between the two nations was never particularly close,\r\n    the estrangement of modern times may be said to have begun in\r\n    colonial and commercial rivalries in the last decades of the\r\n    nineteenth century and to have been sharpened by events in China\r\n    and especially by the Boer War. The situation became more acute\r\n    after the Morocco incident, in 1904-5, and when on that occasion\r\n    England sided with France she was by a large portion of the German\r\n    people definitely aligned with their enemies. The present toast,\r\n    which was reported in this form in the _Kreuzzeitung_ of August 9,\r\n    1889, was received with no protest or denial. The Emperor had been\r\n    present at the manoeuvres of 29,000 English troops at Aldershot,\r\n    under General Sir Evelyn Wood. The toast was offered in the camp\r\n    tent of the Duke of Cambridge, in response to one by that officer.\r\n\r\nIt gives me particular satisfaction to have appointed the Duke of\r\nCambridge, the commander-in-chief of the English army, as a member of\r\nthe 28th Regiment, since this same regiment had as chief at one time\r\nour comrade at Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe friendship with the English, which had been sealed in blood, my\r\nhonored grandfather maintained to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nThe British army fills me with the greatest admiration. If ever the\r\npossibility of counting upon volunteers is doubted, I shall be in a\r\nposition to give testimony to their capacity.\r\n\r\nAt Malplaquet and at Waterloo the Prussian and British blood was shed\r\nin a common cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CZAR AT BERLIN\r\n\r\nBERLIN, OCTOBER 11, 1889\r\n\r\n    On the occasion of Alexander III's visit to Berlin the Emperor\r\n    offered the following toast at the banquet in the White Room of the\r\n    Royal Palace. It may be \"considering too curiously to consider\r\n    so,\" but to many there will seem to be something matter-of-fact in\r\n    the Czar's reply, which is printed below. This friendship between\r\n    the rulers of the two neighboring countries was, however, outwardly\r\n    preserved up to the time of the present war, as is evident to\r\n    those who will consult the telegrams exchanged between William and\r\n    Nicolas on the eve of the outbreak.\r\n\r\nI drink to the health of my honored friend, his Majesty, the Emperor of\r\nRussia, and to the continuation of the friendship which has existed for\r\nmore than one hundred years between our houses and which, as a legacy\r\nreceived from my ancestors, I am determined to foster.\r\n\r\n    The Czar replied in French, as follows:\r\n\r\n_Je remercie Votre Majesté de Vos bonnes paroles et je partage\r\nentièrement les sentiments que Vous venez d'exprimer. A la santé de Sa\r\nMajesté, l'Empereur et Roi--Hourra!_\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOARD AN ENGLISH FLAG-SHIP\r\n\r\nTHE PIRÆUS, OCTOBER 30, 1889\r\n\r\n    On visits to his English relatives the Emperor had, as a lad, made\r\n    occasional sojourns in Great Britain, and that romantic temperament\r\n    of which he was to give indications even in much later years was\r\n    much impressed by the sight of English ships. He recalls the memory\r\n    on many occasions. As will be plain later, he early conceived the\r\n    idea and realized the necessity of a powerful fleet. As this is his\r\n    first reference to the navy in the present volume it is interesting\r\n    to note the attitude of humble discipleship which in the mid-years\r\n    of the next decade is to give way to quite another conception.\r\n\r\nI am proud of the rank which Queen Victoria has bestowed upon me. It\r\nmight be supposed that my interest in the British navy dated from my\r\nappointment as admiral; that, however, is not so. From my earliest\r\nyouth, when as a boy I ran about on the wharves at Portsmouth, I was\r\nmuch interested in British ships. My inspection of the ships to-day\r\nhas afforded me great satisfaction, and I congratulate you on their\r\nappearance. Nelson's famous watchword is no longer necessary. They all\r\ndo their duty, and we as a young sea power follow England in order to\r\nlearn from the English navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAFTER BISMARCK\r\n\r\nMAY 6, 1890--JUNE 21, 1895\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE REICHSTAG\r\n\r\nBERLIN, MAY 6, 1890\r\n\r\n    This address to the Reichstag is of particular importance. The\r\n    Emperor had now visited most of the sovereigns of Europe and felt\r\n    that he had established himself. He was here definitely outlining\r\n    a policy which he himself had framed. In that period when the\r\n    Emperor was still Prince William, Bismarck had said: \"In him there\r\n    is something of Frederick the Great, and he is also able to become\r\n    as despotic as Frederick the Great. What a blessing that we have\r\n    a parliamentary government!\" He had likewise prophesied that the\r\n    Emperor would be his own chancellor, and he had discovered in\r\n    his own case that the prophecy was a true one. In the spring of\r\n    this year, after numerous misunderstandings, Bismarck had himself\r\n    been forced into retirement, and henceforth his name will be\r\n    mentioned but rarely. One of the points on which they had disagreed\r\n    was precisely this project for labor legislation, which was,\r\n    unfortunately, not destined to fulfil the hopes entertained by\r\n    William II. A number of the projects here laid down were carried\r\n    out only partially and others not at all. So, for instance, in this\r\n    same year the Emperor had issued the following decree:\r\n\r\n    \"For the fostering of peace between employers and laborers\r\n    legal regulations are contemplated regarding the forms in which\r\n    the laborers shall, through representatives who possess their\r\n    confidence, participate in the regulation of matters of common\r\n    concern and the protection of their interests in negotiations\r\n    with employers and with the organs of my government. By such\r\n    institutions the laborers are to be enabled to give free and\r\n    peaceful expression to their wishes and complaints, and the\r\n    state authorities are to be given the opportunity of continually\r\n    acquainting themselves with the conditions of the workers and of\r\n    cultivating contact with the latter.\"\r\n\r\n    As late as 1905 it had not been carried into execution, though\r\n    chambers of labor have since been established which partially carry\r\n    out this end.\r\n\r\n    The industrial courts of which the Emperor speaks have been far\r\n    from successful in arbitration disputes. They are established in\r\n    all cities of over 20,000 inhabitants and consist of equal numbers\r\n    of employers and employees. Dawson holds that unwillingness to\r\n    mediate lies with the employers. During the year 1905, 406 courts\r\n    acted as boards of conciliation on 350 occasions, all told, and\r\n    in only 128 cases were they successful. Part of the failure lies\r\n    in the fact that no wage agreements existed. Of 219 \"aggressive\"\r\n    strikes in Berlin in 1905, organized by the \"free\" trades\r\n    federations, 55 were for the introduction of wage agreements.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor's disappointment at the failure of his policy to check\r\n    the growing disaffection of the laboring classes will later be\r\n    evident.\r\n\r\n    It is significant that in this address, though measures for the\r\n    army are strongly urged, there is as yet no mention of the navy.\r\n\r\nHONORED GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nSince you have been chosen in the recent elections to work in common\r\nwith the allied governments, I bid you welcome at this the opening of\r\nthe eighth legislative session of the Reichstag. I earnestly hope that\r\nyou may succeed in finding a satisfactory solution for the important\r\nproblems of legislation which here confront you. A number of these\r\nproblems are of so pressing a nature that it did not seem possible to\r\ndefer longer the summoning of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nI consider as most important among them the further enlargement of the\r\nbill concerning the protection of the laborer. The strikes which have\r\noccurred in different parts of the country during the past year have\r\ngiven me occasion to bring about an investigation of the question as\r\nto whether our present legislation has, to the fullest extent, taken\r\ncognizance of those wishes of the working people which are really just\r\nand reasonable and within the state's power of regulation. The question\r\nof first importance concerns the guarantee of Sunday as a day of rest\r\nfor the laboring man, as well as the limitation of woman and child\r\nlabor in accordance with consideration for humanity and with regard\r\nto the natural laws of development. The governments of the affiliated\r\nstates are convinced that the proposals in this connection made by the\r\nlast Reichstag can, according to their present content, be given legal\r\neffectiveness without harm to other interests. In this connection,\r\nhowever, numerous other provisions have shown themselves unsatisfactory\r\nand capable of improvement. To this category belong especially the\r\nlegal provisions for the protection of the laborer against danger\r\nto his life, health, and morals, as well as the laws concerning the\r\nannouncement of regulations of labor. The prescriptions concerning\r\nthe working men's books need amplification with the aim of insuring\r\nthe respect due the older men against the increasing impertinence of\r\nthe younger laborers. The consequent changes demanded and the further\r\nexpansion of the trade regulations find their expression in a bill\r\nwhich you will shortly receive.\r\n\r\nA further proposal endeavors to secure the better regulation of the\r\nindustrial arbitration courts and, likewise, an organization of these\r\nwhich shall make it possible to use them as mediators in cases of\r\ndispute between employers and employees over the terms on which labor\r\nshall be continued or resumed.\r\n\r\nI trust that your willing co-operation will secure an agreement of\r\nthe law-making bodies concerning the reform laid before you and\r\nthereby take a step forward toward the solution of our relations to\r\nthe laboring class. The more the laboring population recognizes the\r\nserious earnestness with which the government is striving to render\r\ntheir status satisfactory, so much the more will they be conscious of\r\nthe dangers which must arise from their insistence upon extravagant\r\nand impossible demands. In the proper provision for the laborer lies\r\nthe most effective means of increasing the strength which I and my\r\nassociated rulers are called upon and willing to use in opposing with\r\nunyielding determination any attempt to shake the provisions of the law.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the case of this reform there can be question only\r\nof such measures as are feasible without endangering the Fatherland's\r\nindustrial activity and with it the most important vital interests of\r\nthe laborer himself. Our industry forms only one department in the\r\neconomic work of all the peoples who take part in the competition in\r\nthe market of the world. With this in mind, I have sought to bring\r\nabout an interchange of opinions on the matter, among the states\r\nof Europe where similar economic conditions prevail, as to how far\r\na general recognition of the legislative problems relative to the\r\nsafety of the working man can be established and brought to pass. I\r\nam compelled to gratefully acknowledge that these suggestions have\r\nfound favor in all states concerned and especially in those where the\r\nsame idea was already being agitated and was approaching execution.\r\nThe course of the international conference which met here fills me\r\nwith especial satisfaction. Its conclusions are the expression of a\r\ngeneral attitude with regard to this most important province of our\r\ncontemporary civilization. The principles there laid down will, I have\r\nno doubt, prove a rich field which, with God's help, shall blossom to\r\nthe blessing of the workers of all countries and which will also bear\r\nfruit in drawing all nations together.\r\n\r\nThe continued preservation of peace is ever the goal of my efforts.\r\nI dare express the conviction that I have succeeded in securing the\r\nconfidence of all foreign governments in the good faith of this policy\r\nof mine. Like myself and my esteemed affiliated rulers, the German\r\npeople recognize that it is the problem of the empire to preserve peace\r\nby cultivating the alliances already concluded for our defense, and\r\nthe friendly relations now existing with all foreign powers, in order\r\nto further prosperity and civilization. For the accomplishment of this\r\ntask, however, we need an armed force compatible with our position in\r\nthe heart of Europe. Every postponement of matters pertaining to the\r\narmy endangers the political balance of power and with it the success\r\nof our policy directed toward maintaining peace.\r\n\r\nSince the basis of our army organization was decided upon for a\r\ndefinite period the military organization of our neighbors has been\r\nbroadened and perfected to an unforeseen degree. Indeed, we, too,\r\nhave neglected nothing in our attempt to strengthen our forces, in\r\nso far as this was possible within the limits prescribed by the law.\r\nNevertheless, what we could do within these limits was so little that\r\nwe cannot postpone a consideration of the whole question without danger\r\nto ourselves. An increase of the present peace strength and an increase\r\nof the bodies of troops--especially for the field-artillery--must not\r\nbe longer deferred. A bill will be laid before you according to which\r\nthe necessary measures for strengthening the army will go into effect\r\non the 1st of October of this year.\r\n\r\nThe plan which has been instituted in West Africa toward the\r\nsuppression of the slave-trade and for the protection of the German\r\ninterests has, during the last months, made progress, thanks to the\r\nself-sacrificing activity of our officers and officials who are\r\nstationed there. The complete restoration of peace in those districts\r\nmay be expected very shortly. The expense thus incurred will be covered\r\nby an additional grant.\r\n\r\nThe budget for the current fiscal year already needs a corresponding\r\nenlargement on account of the plans referred to. Furthermore, the\r\nincrease of salary for a part of the officials of the realm, which has\r\nlong been projected and which has become ever more pressing, can no\r\nlonger be delayed. The supplementary budget which is to be submitted\r\nto you will give you an opportunity to prove your friendly interest in\r\nsatisfying this need.\r\n\r\nIf the labors hereby imposed upon you come to a successful issue, new\r\nand sound guarantees for the inner welfare of the Fatherland will then\r\nhave been won. May it be granted to us through common effort to achieve\r\nthis end!\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE NINTH ARMY CORPS\r\n\r\nFLENSBURG, SEPTEMBER 4, 1890\r\n\r\n    The review of the Ninth Army Corps took place in the presence of\r\n    the Empress, Princes Henry and Albert, of Archduke Karl Stephen\r\n    of Austria, and Count Moltke at Flensburg. It will be remembered\r\n    that in 1864 Bismarck succeeded in enlisting Austria to aid\r\n    Prussia in a war upon Denmark, which was at that time deprived of\r\n    Schleswig-Holstein, the harbor of Kiel, and more than 1,000,000\r\n    inhabitants. One of the battles of the war to which the Emperor\r\n    refers was fought in this district. The address was made at the\r\n    banquet following the review.\r\n\r\nMy opinion of to-day's performance of the Ninth Army Corps under the\r\ncommand of your Excellency [General von Leszczynski] I have already\r\nexpressed to you and your officers.\r\n\r\nWhoever, like myself, has for any length of time stood at the front\r\nor partly at the front and partly as spectator has been present at\r\nmany imperial manoeuvres knows what such a parade means to an army\r\ncorps. I know very well what arduous preliminary labor is involved, the\r\nagitation, the attention, the exertion of the troops. I know very well\r\nhow each individual officer, high or low, every soldier, rejoices in\r\nand yet with a certain solicitude looks forward to the moment when he\r\nshall parade before his war lord.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Kriegsherr.\r\n\r\nI know from my own experience when I was still a captain what\r\nsatisfaction I felt when my adjutant could call to me that the Emperor\r\nhad nodded as the company passed by him. This is true to-day,\r\nlikewise, in the case of every officer.\r\n\r\nI repeat to you my hearty thanks and express to you my congratulation\r\nfor the magnificent parade. This army corps which you have marshalled\r\nbefore me has a bearing and discipline which I must demand\r\nunconditionally from every army corps. I do not doubt for a moment\r\nthat the work done in preparing for a review will prove useful in the\r\npreparation for battle.\r\n\r\nWe stand here upon historic ground, on which our armies, united with\r\nthose of Austria, jointly won a bloody victory.\r\n\r\nI raise my glass and drink to the Ninth Army Corps in the expectation\r\nthat here and hereafter, in war as in peace, it will maintain its\r\nfamous traditions. Long live the Ninth Army Corps!\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS WITH AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY\r\n\r\nBERLIN, NOVEMBER 11, 1890\r\n\r\n    The following address shows the Emperor in one of the little-known\r\n    phases of his amazingly versatile career. It exhibits, likewise,\r\n    his command of detailed knowledge in a field where we should least\r\n    expect it and his solicitude for the welfare of faithful subjects.\r\n    Besides his interest in the sea, he has also for many years been\r\n    much interested in agriculture; and his estate in East Prussia\r\n    has been in a sense an experiment station. He prides himself on\r\n    being a pioneer and in personally supervising his domain and is\r\n    occasionally pleased to call himself a farmer. He attended the\r\n    meetings of the Prussian Agricultural Commission and at one of the\r\n    sessions took part in the discussion on the means of safeguarding\r\n    the life of the laborers.\r\n\r\nTwo points have occurred to me which I would like to ask you to\r\nconsider. It is worthy of note that during my reign there have\r\nbeen brought to my attention many striking cases in which laboring\r\nwomen have been killed through accidents with machinery. I receive\r\nregularly from the Minister of Justice tabulated lists of requests[6]\r\nfor pardon, and it seems to me that there is among them a striking\r\nnumber of cases of women farmhands who have met with accidents in\r\ntending machines. As has already been said, I am not granting these\r\npardons as freely as formerly. It is to be noted, furthermore, that a\r\ngreat difference prevails in the adjudication of the cases in which\r\npenalties may be inflicted and in the penalties themselves. I next\r\ninquired why these women workers--it was especially girls working with\r\nthe thrashing-machines--were killed, and it usually appeared that\r\nthe girls were caught by their dresses in the transmission pulleys\r\nand so became entangled in them. Then I asked if there were no means\r\nof protection there. Yes, indeed, they said, according to the police\r\nregulations the pulleys must have a cover or a box must be put over\r\nthem, but in each of these cases this had not been attended to. There\r\nalso appeared here, on the one side, a certain indifference either on\r\nthe part of the owner or of the person who was conducting the work\r\nconcerning the life of the women in his employ and, on the other\r\nside, an indifference on the part of the women themselves, who had\r\nbecome accustomed to working near the moving parts of the machines\r\nand to stepping over the pulleys, and finally the accident happened.\r\nTherefore, may I ask you that in using the word \"machines\" these\r\nprovisions regarding power transmission be not forgotten. Many of\r\nthe machines stand in one place and the apparatus for transmission\r\nis in another place or in the yard, and that is a chief cause of the\r\naccidents. For every one passes through the yard, and especially if\r\nthere are children playing there, all too easily some misfortune may\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n[6] From employers, of course.\r\n\r\nLet me, therefore, remark, concerning what one of the preceding\r\nspeakers has said, that I myself have come to the same conclusion as\r\nProfessor Schmoller. I believe that it is not sufficient that the\r\nstate should lay upon the worker the obligation to be careful and that\r\nit should give him directions how to conduct himself with regard to the\r\nmachines. This cannot be carried out.\r\n\r\nI am much more of the opinion that, if such is your desire and if it is\r\nplain that harm has resulted from the fact that the workers move about\r\ntoo carelessly, it is much better that the obligation should be put\r\nupon the owner or upon the person commissioned to conduct the machines\r\nand that he be required to watch over the employees more carefully.\r\nIf the owner cannot burden himself with it then he should have such\r\nofficials as would have sufficient influence with the worker to make\r\nhim be careful. We must not forget what, for the most part, such a\r\nworker is like and what he knows of machinery. Frequently he knows only\r\nthat it cuts or that it is otherwise dangerous. A certain grip is shown\r\nhim--he must do it like this--but the rest he does not understand and\r\nregards with indifference. Consequently regulations which concern only\r\nor more particularly the laborer would not help, for the people would\r\nnot understand their aim and when the regulation caused them annoyance\r\nor trouble would fail to consider it and thus render themselves liable\r\nto accident.\r\n\r\nI believe, therefore, that it is most important in the question of\r\nthe conduct of agricultural machinery that we should work toward\r\nproper supervision over the laborer by the employer. When this happens\r\naccidents will begin to diminish.\r\n\r\nIt has interested me very much to learn here that it is not the\r\nmachines but altogether different circumstances which cause most of\r\nthe accidents in agricultural operations and that particularly in\r\nall provinces where horses are employed accidents are frequent. I am\r\ntherefore pleased that this phase of the question of protecting against\r\naccident has also come up here and that the gentlemen are now engaged\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nFor the rest it has been a great pleasure to me to take part in these\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE-LORRAINE\r\n\r\nBERLIN, MARCH 14, 1891\r\n\r\n    On this occasion a deputation from Alsace-Lorraine presented a\r\n    protest against the continuance of the _Passzwang_, a rule which\r\n    made it impossible to leave Alsace-Lorraine except under very\r\n    special circumstances and on receiving a pass from the imperial\r\n    agent. The rule was particularly obnoxious, and the strictness with\r\n    which it had been enforced was much resented, even by subjects\r\n    favorably disposed to the empire. It was, however, merely one\r\n    of many grievances. Since the time of the Franco-Prussian War,\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine had been governed like a conquered province--by\r\n    a governor appointed by, and responsible to, the Emperor alone.\r\n    Up to this time the policy had been one of repression, save for\r\n    a very brief period. It is possible that the Emperor might have\r\n    been inclined to give them some relief had it not been for the\r\n    unfortunate result of the visit of his mother to Paris. After a\r\n    visit in London, the Empress Frederick, in February, 1891 (it\r\n    is supposed on the advice of her son), visited Paris and, while\r\n    there, was to ask certain of the French artists to exhibit at\r\n    the Berlin exhibition. It had evidently been assumed that the\r\n    time had come for a _rapprochement_. The Empress descended at\r\n    the German embassy very quietly and had received promises from\r\n    several artists, when her presence in Paris became known to the\r\n    League of French Patriots and to the germanophobe Déroulède, who\r\n    immediately started a violent agitation and demonstrations against\r\n    Germany. The artists withdrew their promises under the pressure\r\n    of outraged patriotic opinion, and the situation became so tense\r\n    that the Empress was forced to depart very hastily in a manner\r\n    that suggested flight. The incident tended to make bad feeling\r\n    on both sides and reacted unfavorably upon the attitude of the\r\n    empire toward the former French provinces. The difficulties of\r\n    circulation were increased, and the regulations about passes were\r\n    made particularly trying. These difficulties were removed in 1899,\r\n    but the provinces continued to protest, as they were not given\r\n    equal rights with the other German states and have not enjoyed them\r\n    up to the present. In May, 1911, a new so-called constitution was\r\n    given to Alsace-Lorraine. The executive power is exercised by the\r\n    Emperor in the name of the empire; the province has three votes\r\n    in the Bundesrat, which are so restricted that they give very\r\n    little satisfaction to Alsace-Lorraine and are so far under the\r\n    control of Prussia that they give considerable dissatisfaction to\r\n    other German states. The Emperor appoints officials, including the\r\n    _Statthalter_, or governor, and the delegates are instructed by the\r\n    _Statthalter_ and must vote according to instructions. The votes\r\n    do not count in any vote concerning the imperial Constitution.\r\n    There was much protest because the new constitution did not grant\r\n    the provinces sufficient independence. The previous Provincial\r\n    Assembly (_Landesausschuss_) had been summarily closed on the\r\n    9th of May, 1911. Affairs were but little improved under the new\r\n    arrangement, and the Emperor came to Strasburg in great anger, May\r\n    13, 1912, and made the following threatening address: \"If this\r\n    keeps up I shall knock your constitution to bits. Up to the present\r\n    you have known me from my good side, but you can perhaps learn to\r\n    know me from the other side also. If things do not change, we will\r\n    make of Alsace-Lorraine a Prussian province.\" This speech of the\r\n    Emperor's is not printed officially, but it was made the subject\r\n    of an interpellation in the Reichstag on May 17, 1912, and the\r\n    burgomaster of Strasburg admitted that the sense of the imperial\r\n    utterance was properly given. With regard to Alsace-Lorraine, the\r\n    Emperor has tried both kindness and severity. The Zabern incident\r\n    proved that in neither of these policies had he succeeded in\r\n    winning either the love or the subjection of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n    The following is the estimate of Dr. H. A. Gibbons on the situation\r\n    in Alsace-Lorraine immediately before the outbreak of the European\r\n    War:\r\n\r\n    \"One could easily fill many pages with illustrations of senseless\r\n    persecutions, most of them of the pettiest character, but some more\r\n    serious in nature, which Alsace and Lorraine have had to endure\r\n    since the granting of the constitution. Newspapers, illustrated\r\n    journals, clubs, and organizations of all kinds have been annoyed\r\n    constantly by police interference. Their editors, artists, and\r\n    managers have been brought frequently into court. Zislin and Hansi,\r\n    celebrated caricaturists, have found themselves provoked to bolder\r\n    and bolder defiances by successive condemnations and have endured\r\n    imprisonment as well as fines. Hansi was sentenced to a year's\r\n    imprisonment by the High Court of Leipsic only a month before\r\n    the present war broke out and chose exile rather than a Prussian\r\n    fortress.\r\n\r\n    \"The greatest effort during the past few years has been made in the\r\n    schools to influence the minds of the growing generation against\r\n    the '_souvenir de France_,' and to impress upon the Alsacians what\r\n    good fortune had come to them to be born German citizens.\r\n\r\n    \"Among the boys, the influence of this teaching has been such\r\n    that over twenty-two thousand fled from home during the period of\r\n    1900-13 to enlist in the Foreign Legion of the French Army. The\r\n    campaign of the German newspapers in Alsace-Lorraine and, in fact,\r\n    throughout Germany was redoubled in 1911. Parents were warned of\r\n    the horrible treatment accorded to the poor boys who were misguided\r\n    enough to throw away their citizenship and go to be killed in\r\n    Africa under the French flag. The result of this campaign was that\r\n    the Foreign Legion received a larger number of Alsacians in 1912\r\n    than had enlisted during a single year since 1871!\r\n\r\n    \"Among the girls, the German educational system flattered itself\r\n    that it could completely change the sentiments of a child,\r\n    especially in the boarding-schools. Last year the Empress of\r\n    Germany visited a girls' school near Metz which is one of the best\r\n    German schools in the _Reichsland_. As she was leaving she told\r\n    the children that she wanted to give them something. What did they\r\n    want? The answer was not sweets or cake but that they might be\r\n    taught a _little_ French!\r\n\r\n    \"The former French provinces have been flooded with garrisons\r\n    and have been treated just as they were forty years ago. The\r\n    insufferable spirit of militarism and the arrogance of the\r\n    Prussian officers in Alsacian towns have served to turn against\r\n    the empire many thousands whom another policy might have won; for\r\n    it must be remembered that by no means _all_ the inhabitants of\r\n    the _Reichsland_ have been by birth and by home training French\r\n    sympathizers. Instead of crushing out the '_souvenir de France_,'\r\n    the Prussian civil and military officials have caused it to be born\r\n    in many a soul which was by nature German.\r\n\r\n    \"The Prussian has never understood how to win the confidence of\r\n    others. There has been no Rome in his political vision. As for\r\n    conceptions of toleration, of kindness, and of love, they are\r\n    non-existent in Prussian officialdom.\"\r\n\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction that the committee of the provinces\r\nhas turned to me in an important question concerning the interests of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine. I see in this fact a valuable proof of the increasing\r\nunderstanding which my good-will and my interest in the development of\r\nyour home country has begotten in the minds of its representatives.\r\nI am also pleased to accept this assurance that the people of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, satisfied for the time being with the existing\r\npolitical relations, spurn every interference by foreign elements and\r\nlook to the empire alone for the protection of their interests.\r\n\r\nWhile I offer you my thanks for this expression of loyal sentiment, I\r\nregret that for the present I cannot fulfil your wishes. I must confine\r\nmyself in this matter to expressing the hope that in a not too distant\r\nfuture our relations may make possible the alleviation of conditions on\r\nthe western boundary. This hope will be the sooner realized the more\r\nthe people of Alsace-Lorraine are convinced of the inviolability of the\r\nunion which binds them to Germany and the more decidedly they exhibit\r\ntheir resolution to remain forever faithful and immovable in their\r\nloyalty to me and to the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEARING IN THE RECRUITS\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, NOVEMBER 23, 1891\r\n\r\n    Every year the Emperor is present at the swearing in of the\r\n    recruits to the guard and to the navy. He has made innumerable\r\n    speeches on such occasions. The present somewhat striking\r\n    pronouncement was delivered at a time when his feeling toward the\r\n    Socialists, who had been guilty of no particular outrage, still\r\n    ran very high. Tolstoi saw in it the worst excesses of militarism\r\n    and issued shortly after the following criticism of the Emperor's\r\n    attitude:\r\n\r\n    \"This man expresses what all wise men know but carefully conceal.\r\n    He says frankly that men who serve in the army serve him and his\r\n    advantage and must be prepared for his advantage to kill their\r\n    brothers and fathers.\r\n\r\n    \"He expresses frankly, and with the coarsest of words, all the\r\n    horror of the crime for which the men who enter into military\r\n    service are prepared, all that abyss of degradation which they\r\n    reach when they promise obedience. Like a bold hypnotizer, he\r\n    tests the degree of the hypnotized man's sleep: he puts the glowing\r\n    iron to his body, the body sizzles and smokes, but the hypnotized\r\n    man does not awake.\r\n\r\n    \"This miserable, ill man, who has lost his mind from the exercise\r\n    of power, with these words offends everything which can be holy for\r\n    a man of our time, and men--Christians, liberals, cultured men of\r\n    our time, all of them are not only not provoked by this insult but\r\n    do not even notice it.\"\r\n\r\n    It is possible that such criticism and the resentment aroused in\r\n    the minds of the law-abiding Socialists led him later to tone down\r\n    his utterances, though on one subsequent occasion, again with the\r\n    Socialists in mind, he made a somewhat similar address (March 28,\r\n    1901).\r\n\r\n\r\nRECRUITS TO THE REGIMENT OF MY GUARD:\r\n\r\nYou are brought together here from all parts of the empire to fulfil\r\nyour military duty, and in this holy place have just sworn fealty to\r\nyour Emperor to your last breath. You are still too young to understand\r\nall this. You will, however, little by little, be made familiar with\r\nits significance. Do not imagine it too difficult, and trust in God;\r\noccasionally also say the Lord's Prayer--that has frequently given many\r\na warrior fresh courage.\r\n\r\nChildren of my guard, to-day you have become incorporated into my\r\narmy; you now stand under my command and have the privilege of\r\nwearing my uniform. Wear it honorably. Think of the famous history of\r\nyour Fatherland; remember that the German army must be armed against\r\nthe internal as well as the external foe. More and more unbelief and\r\ndiscontent raise their heads in the Fatherland, and it may come to\r\npass that you will have to shoot down or stab your own relatives and\r\nbrothers. Then seal your loyalty with your heart's blood! And now go to\r\nyour homes and fulfil your duties.\r\n\r\n    --(According to the _Breslauer Lokalanzeiger_ of December 8.)\r\n\r\n    According to the _Neisser Zeitung_, the second paragraph ran as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\nRecruits! You have now before the consecrated servant of the Lord\r\nand before His altar, sworn fealty to me. You are still too young to\r\nunderstand the true meaning of what has just been said; but be diligent\r\nnow and follow the directions and instructions given you. You have\r\nsworn loyalty to me; that means, children of my guard, that you are\r\nnow my soldiers, you have given yourselves up to me, body and soul;\r\nthere is for you but one enemy, and that is my enemy. In view of the\r\npresent Socialistic agitations it may come to pass that I shall command\r\nyou to shoot your own relatives, brothers, yes, parents--which God\r\nforbid--but even then you must follow my command without a murmur.\r\n\r\n    Entirely similar, but shorter, is a clipping from the Berlin paper\r\n    _Das Volk_, according to the account of one who heard the speech.\r\n\r\nYou have sworn to me the oath of loyalty; that means, from now on you\r\nknow only one command, and that is my most high command; you have only\r\none enemy, and that is my enemy! And so I may sometime--which God\r\nforbid--have to bid you to shoot upon your own relatives, yes, brothers\r\nand parents--then remember your oath!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR'S FIRST ARMY BILL\r\n\r\nBERLIN, JULY 4, 1893\r\n\r\n    The opposition between the Reichstag and the government reached\r\n    a climax when the session which opened in 1886 was dissolved in\r\n    January, 1887, because it refused to vote for the bill fixing\r\n    the army status for the ensuing seven years. The next Reichstag,\r\n    elected in February, voted the bill. In spite of the fact that\r\n    the new arrangement was to have been effective until March, 1894,\r\n    as early as the session of 1890 changes were introduced which\r\n    fixed the peace footing at 468,983 men, exclusive of the one-year\r\n    volunteers. In November, 1892, a new army bill was presented,\r\n    to run for six years, fixing the peace footing at 492,068. All\r\n    infantrymen were to serve two years. In the debates of 1887 it\r\n    was announced that Russia was an ally of Germany. The failure to\r\n    renew the neutrality agreement with that power and the growing\r\n    _rapprochement_ between France and Russia seems to have been most\r\n    in the Emperor's mind in calling for an increase. The increased\r\n    appropriation of 1887 was covered by a tax on spirits, sugar, and\r\n    grain. The new increase was to be met by indirect taxes, mostly on\r\n    beer and brandy. When the Reichstag refused to vote the bill as it\r\n    stood, it was dissolved and a new one called. The new Reichstag,\r\n    which is here addressed, accepted the bill on July 15. As much of\r\n    the opposition had been due to the fear of the less-favored classes\r\n    that the increased cost would fall heavily on them through indirect\r\n    taxes, the Chancellor assured the representatives (as the Emperor\r\n    here indicates) that there would be no tax on beer or brandy nor\r\n    any other necessities of life.\r\n\r\nSince you have been called to work in common with the confederated\r\ngovernments, it is my desire at the beginning of your deliberations to\r\ngreet you and bid you welcome.\r\n\r\nThe draft of the bill concerning the peace footing of the German army,\r\nthrough which a strengthening of our available force would have been\r\nachieved, was presented to the last Reichstag. To my great regret the\r\nproject did not meet with the approval of the representatives of the\r\npeople. The conviction, unanimously shared by my corulers, that in\r\nthe face of the development of the military arrangements of the other\r\npowers this government could no longer put off such a shaping of its\r\nmilitary status as should guarantee its safety and its future led to\r\nthe decision to dissolve the Reichstag and, by the calling of new\r\nrepresentatives to attain the end recognized as necessary. Since the\r\nproposal of this law the political situation of Europe has undergone no\r\nchange. To my great satisfaction, the relations of the empire to the\r\nforeign states are altogether and everywhere friendly and free from\r\nany cloud. The organized military force of Germany, however, compares\r\nstill more unfavorably with that of our neighbors than it did last\r\nyear. Since her geographical position and her historical development\r\nimpose upon Germany the duty of taking thought for a proportionately\r\nlarge standing army, the further development of our defensive strength,\r\ntherefore, with regard to the progress of other countries becomes a\r\npressing necessity. In order to satisfy the duties constitutionally\r\nlaid upon me, it seemed to me incontrovertible that I should exercise\r\nevery existing means at my command toward the restoration of a\r\nsufficient and effective defense of the honor of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThere will, therefore, be laid before you without delay a new bill\r\nconcerning the peace footing of the army. In it the wishes which\r\nwere strongly expressed during the discussion of the former bill are\r\ntaken account of, and, in accordance with this, demands made upon the\r\npersonal capacity and upon the people's ability to pay taxes have, in\r\nso far as this could be done without endangering the end sought, been\r\nlessened.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the realm demands, especially in looking forward to the\r\nimpending expiration of the seven-year arrangement next spring, that\r\nthe bill should be decided upon with all possible despatch, in order\r\nthat this year's recruiting can be undertaken on the new basis. A delay\r\nin carrying out this proposal would be felt for more than twenty years,\r\nto the detriment of our defensive strength.\r\n\r\nTo make it possible for you to give your undivided attention to the\r\ndiscussion of the bill, the confederated governments will refrain from\r\nburdening the session with other important matters.\r\n\r\nI and my honored corulers are still of the opinion that the means\r\nnecessary for the reorganization of our military equipment can be\r\nraised properly, and without overburdening the people, in the manner\r\nbrought forward last autumn in the draft of the proposed taxation\r\nbill. Nevertheless, the question of making good the deficit is still\r\nthe object of continued discussions. I expect that a proposal will be\r\nset before you by the beginning of the next winter session in which is\r\nexpressed, even more strongly than in the former bill, the principle\r\nthat the providing of the necessary means must be carried out with the\r\nutmost regard for the individual's ability to pay and with as little\r\ndraft as possible upon our power of levying taxes. Until the expiration\r\nof the present official year the contributions from the various states\r\nmay be drawn upon to cover the excess.\r\n\r\nHonored Sirs, we have succeeded in the difficult task of welding the\r\nGerman race into a strong union. The nation honors those who have given\r\ntheir possessions and their blood for this work and who have brought\r\nthe Fatherland to political and industrial prosperity--a prosperity\r\nwhich is the pride and the pleasure of their contemporaries and which,\r\nif they build in the same spirit as their fathers, will guarantee to\r\nthe generations to come the greatness and the happiness of the empire.\r\nTo protect the glorious acquisitions with which God has blessed us in\r\nour struggle for independence is our most sacred duty. We can, however,\r\nonly fulfil such a duty toward the Fatherland by making ourselves\r\nsufficiently strong in military power to defend ourselves, so that we\r\nmay remain a reliable guarantor of the peace of Europe. I trust that\r\nyour patriotic, self-sacrificing assistance in the pursuance of this\r\naim will not fail me and my honored corulers.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor followed the formal address from the throne with the\r\n    following:\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, go forth. May our ancient God look down upon you\r\nand bestow upon you His blessing to the end that you may bring to\r\nsuccessful issue an honorable work for the welfare of our Fatherland!\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN METZ\r\n\r\nMETZ, SEPTEMBER 3, 1893\r\n\r\n    On the 3d of September the Emperor, accompanied by the Crown Prince\r\n    of Italy, paid a visit to Metz. To Burgomaster Halm's speech of\r\n    welcome the Emperor replied as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is with a heart deeply stirred that I enter the city of Metz, and if\r\nI could not come last year, as I wished,[7] I see, nevertheless, that\r\nthe reason for my remaining away has been rightly understood.\r\n\r\n[7] The Emperor came to Metz ordinarily to review the Eighth and\r\n    Sixteenth Army Corps. Because of the cholera scare, the imperial\r\n    manoeuvres had not taken place in the previous year, 1892. The\r\n    Emperor, who was anxious to conciliate his subjects, had taken up a\r\n    domain in Urville.\r\n\r\nI rejoice to see the monument to my late grandfather at length finished\r\nand to be able to allow my troops to pass before it. Metz and my army\r\ncorps are a corner-stone in the military might of Germany, destined to\r\nprotect the peace of Germany--yes, of all Europe--and it is my firm\r\npurpose to maintain this peace.\r\n\r\nI thank the city of Metz for its festive welcome, and I pray you\r\nthat my thanks be made known to the citizens through an official\r\nannouncement. If I have removed my headquarters to Urville it is\r\nbecause as a landholder in Lorraine I could not do otherwise, since\r\nmy subjects in this province wish to have me there. In token of my\r\nimperial favor I extend to the burgomaster a golden chain of office\r\nwhich the burgomasters of Metz shall be entitled to wear from this time\r\nforth. It gives me especial pleasure, however, to be able to bestow\r\nthis chain upon the present burgomaster.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION OF FLAGS\r\n\r\nBERLIN, OCTOBER 18, 1894\r\n\r\n    Through a reorganization of the army which was to be made effective\r\n    in the next legislative session, a large number of partial bodies\r\n    of troops were created which were later to be increased to bring\r\n    up the peace footing of the army from 538 whole and 173 half\r\n    battalions to 624 whole battalions. Every two of these constitute\r\n    a regiment and every two regiments a brigade. On the anniversary\r\n    of the battle of Leipzig the Emperor, in the presence of a large\r\n    number of princes, including the young King of Servia, turned\r\n    over flags to these troops. His statement that the only pillar\r\n    upon which the empire rested was the army was strongly resented\r\n    by many of his loyal subjects of the empire who happened to be\r\n    merely peaceful merchants or farmers or laborers. The Emperor was\r\n    doubtless provoked into making the statement from the fact that\r\n    some of his legislative policies had met with determined opposition\r\n    on the part of representatives of the people. This he has always\r\n    regarded as disloyalty and as boding disaster to the empire. Since\r\n    the army's tradition for loyalty to the imperial war lord renders\r\n    opposition here impossible, he saw in it the only salvation of the\r\n    state.\r\n\r\nIn order that they may serve as a shining symbol of glory for the\r\ntroops, we have had the blessing of Heaven called down upon the ensigns\r\nwhich I have bestowed upon every fourth battalion of my regiments, and\r\nI now turn them over to the regimental commanders and to the regiments\r\nthemselves. This inspiring day is one whose memories move the world\r\nand which marks an epoch in our German history. I first salute the\r\nmausoleum of him[8] whose birthday was once wont to fill the entire\r\nGerman Fatherland with jubilation, the mausoleum of him to whom it was\r\ngranted to win glorious victories under the eyes of the great, heroic\r\nEmperor, his father, and to cover the flags which were consecrated\r\nin 1861 with glory. They were nailed to their staffs in the rooms\r\nin which the history of Brandenburg and Prussia is immortalized in\r\npaintings. The monuments of the rulers and of the generals who created\r\nthe glory of Prussia have looked down upon them. These flags have now\r\nbeen brought before the monument of the Prussian King who focussed\r\nthe eyes of the world upon them in years of fierce conflict and whose\r\nlast breath was a wish of blessing for his army. In the year 1861,\r\nwhen my grandfather undertook the reorganization of his arms, he was\r\nmisunderstood by many and attacked by even more; nevertheless, the\r\nfuture gave him his splendid justification. Just as at that time, so\r\nnow, too, distrust and discord are rife among the people. The only\r\npillar on which the empire rested was the army. So is it to-day! The\r\nflags which are assembled here are destined for entire bodies of\r\ntroops, and I hope that the half battalions to which they are to-day\r\ndelivered will soon stand as entire battalions in the army of the\r\nFatherland.\r\n\r\n[8] Emperor Frederick III.\r\n\r\nBut you, gentlemen, now take over these ensigns and with them the\r\nobligation of maintaining the tradition of devotion, of discipline\r\nunto death, of unconditional obedience toward the war lord against\r\nall inward and outward enemies. Even as heretofore, may the blessing\r\nof the Most High rest upon our army, and may the watchful eyes of our\r\nancestors look down upon and protect Prussia's army and her flags! With\r\nGod for King and Fatherland!\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY RECRUITS\r\n\r\nKIEL, DECEMBER 3, 1894\r\n\r\n    It is part of the Emperor's duty to administer the oath every\r\n    year to the recruits for the navy as well as to the recruits for\r\n    the guard. He is inclined to talk to them usually in very simple\r\n    language, as here, for instance. Indeed, though they are usually\r\n    twenty years of age, he often addresses them as the \"children of my\r\n    guard.\"\r\n\r\nThe oath is holy, and holy is the place in which you swear it. The\r\naltar and the crucifix bear witness to this; it means that we Germans\r\nare Christians, that we at all times first give the glory to God in\r\nevery affair that we undertake, especially in the highest--that of\r\nstrengthening the defense of the Fatherland. You wear the uniform of\r\nthe Emperor; you are thereby preferred over other men, and take your\r\nrank equally with your comrades of the army and navy; you receive\r\na special place and assume obligations. By many you will be envied\r\nbecause of the uniform which you wear; hold it in honor, and do not\r\nbesmirch it; this you will accomplish best when you think of your\r\noath--you especially, you people of the sea, who so often have the\r\nopportunity in your various journeyings upon the water to learn to know\r\nthe almighty power of God!\r\n\r\nWherein lies the secret of the fact that we have often overcome our\r\nadversary with lesser numbers? In discipline. What is discipline?\r\nSingle-hearted co-operation, single-hearted obedience. That our ancient\r\nforebears already clung to this ideal a single example will show: On\r\none occasion they were marching to war against the Romans. They had\r\nclimbed over the mountain and found themselves suddenly face to face\r\nwith the huge masses of the army. Then they realized what a difficult\r\nmoment was before them. They first prayed, giving God the glory, and\r\nthen, bound together with chains, side by side, they fell upon the\r\nenemies and conquered them. To-day we no longer need the actual chains;\r\nwe have a powerful religion and our oath. Remain true to it, and think\r\nof it, whether you are within the country or without. Hold your colors\r\nhigh, the black, white, and red which here stand before you, and think\r\nof your oath, think of your Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTENING OF A CRUISER\r\n\r\nKIEL, MARCH 26, 1895\r\n\r\n    The Emperor, as will be plain, took much satisfaction in the\r\n    development of his navy and was to make innumerable addresses on\r\n    these occasions. The present is a fair type of a number of the\r\n    shorter speeches. Very soon they were to become occasions in which\r\n    he was to broach the idea of the greater navy. The present address\r\n    will serve to illustrate the spirit he was hoping to instil into\r\n    this branch of the service.\r\n\r\nAs a testimony to the industry of the Fatherland, after the diligent\r\nlabors of the imperial dockyards, this vessel now stands before us\r\nready to be given over to its element. Thou shalt now be enrolled in\r\nthe German navy. Thou shalt serve in the protection of the Fatherland\r\nto bring defiance and annihilation to the enemy. The names of the\r\nships which belong to the same class are taken from the old Germanic\r\nsagas. Therefore thou also shalt hark back to the ancient time of our\r\nancestors, to the powerful divinity who was worshipped and feared by\r\nall our German seafaring forefathers and whose mighty realm stretched\r\nfrom the north even unto the south pole, in whose province the northern\r\nbattles were fought, and whence death and destruction were brought\r\ninto the land of the enemy. Thou shalt bear the name of this great and\r\nmighty god. Mayst thou prove thyself worthy of it! So do I christen\r\nthee with the name of _Ægir_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIT TO BISMARCK\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICHSRUH, MARCH 26, 1895\r\n\r\n    Historians of modern Germany have discussed and explained in\r\n    various ways the causes of the retirement of Bismarck, the \"Iron\r\n    Chancellor.\" From the moment he became \"Minister President and\r\n    Minister of Foreign Affairs,\" in 1862, his hand was the hand that\r\n    guided German policy, and his was the genius that presided over\r\n    and shaped the unification of Germany and the building of the\r\n    empire. It has been truly said that the biography of Bismarck is\r\n    the history of German union. He had been born in Brandenburg and\r\n    spent his life in the service of the Prussian Kings. It was he who\r\n    in the dark days preceding the victories of the sixties had given\r\n    William I heart and had prevented him from giving up his task. It\r\n    was, therefore, a great shock to the German world to learn that,\r\n    two years after the accession of William II, the great founder of\r\n    German unity had been forced into retirement. There had been rumors\r\n    of previous disagreements. The German Chancellor is responsible\r\n    not to the Reichstag but solely to the Emperor; he takes the\r\n    responsibility of shaping the imperial policy. It was said that\r\n    Bismarck resented certain interference with his authority in his\r\n    own cabinet. It is certain that he looked with disfavor on the\r\n    Emperor's policy with regard to labor legislation. With regard to\r\n    the attitude toward Russia there was likewise disagreement, and\r\n    Bismarck opposed the Emperor's visit to Constantinople. But aside\r\n    from these questions of policy, there were deep psychological\r\n    incompatibilities. Crabbed age and romantic youth could not live\r\n    together. Furthermore, the Emperor wished to take the credit for\r\n    initiating and carrying through his own policies. He was not\r\n    content to be a shadow king. Bismarck, after nearly forty years of\r\n    service, was not willing to be a puppet chancellor. He insisted\r\n    on the form of cabinet government decreed in 1852. The Emperor's\r\n    disposition of mind may be gathered from the following extracts\r\n    from a speech delivered shortly before Bismarck's retirement, and\r\n    it should be remembered that at this time Bismarck was far from\r\n    being an enthusiastic supporter of certain measures then taking\r\n    shape in the mind of William II. On the 5th of March, 1890, the\r\n    Emperor announced to the Brandenburgers: \"All those who wish to\r\n    help me in this work I bid heartily welcome, whoever they may be;\r\n    but all those (whoever they may be) who oppose me in this work I\r\n    shall smash to pieces\" (_zerschmettern_). Bismarck was forced to\r\n    offer his resignation two weeks later. Besides his ducal title, he\r\n    was given the honorary title of general of cavalry, with the rank\r\n    of field-marshal. Because of his opposition, he was treated in the\r\n    following years with extreme coolness and occasionally as an enemy.\r\n    The German ambassador at Vienna was instructed from Berlin, on\r\n    the occasion of the marriage of Bismarck's son, not to accept an\r\n    invitation to the wedding. Foreign ambassadors were informed that\r\n    for the Emperor there were two Bismarcks: the former responsible\r\n    servant and the present irresponsible subject. The honors given him\r\n    were not generally honors due a great ex-chancellor, but honors\r\n    due a military officer. \"Living,\" said Bismarck, \"they give me the\r\n    honors of the dead.\" On this, his eightieth birthday, the Reichstag\r\n    voted down the proposal that they send him their congratulations.\r\n    The Emperor, with an exclusively military suite, however, paid him\r\n    this visit and presented him with a sword engraved with his arms\r\n    and with the arms of the conquered provinces, Alsace-Lorraine. In\r\n    all probability, Bismarck felt the lack of mention of his services\r\n    as Chancellor; his entirely diplomatic reply printed below would\r\n    seem to indicate this.\r\n\r\nYOUR HIGHNESS:\r\n\r\nOur whole Fatherland decks itself out to celebrate your birthday.\r\nThis day belongs to the army. Its first duty is to do honor to its\r\ncomrades, to its old officers, whose efficiency made it possible for\r\nit to carry through the mighty deeds which found their reward in the\r\ncrowning of a regenerated Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe military host which stands gathered here is a symbol of the whole\r\narmy, especially this regiment which has the honor of calling your\r\nHighness its commander, and especially that standard which reminds us\r\nof the fame of Brandenburg and Prussia, which dates from the time of\r\nthe Great Elector and is consecrated by the blood shed at Mars-la-Tour.\r\nYour Highness will see in spirit, behind this gathering of troops, the\r\ncollected army of the entire German race in battle array to celebrate\r\nthis day with us.\r\n\r\nIn sight of this host, I come now to present to your Highness my gift.\r\nI could find no better token than a sword, this noblest weapon of the\r\nGermans; a symbol of that instrument which your Highness with my late\r\ngrandfather helped to shape, to sharpen, and also to wield; the symbol\r\nof that great, powerful period of building whose mortar was blood and\r\niron; that weapon which is never dismayed and which, when necessary,\r\nin the hands of kings and princes will defend against internal foes\r\nthat unity of the Fatherland which it had once conquered from the\r\nfoes without. May your Highness be good enough to notice the linking\r\nof your arms with those of Alsace-Lorraine here engraved and feel\r\nagain all that history which found its conclusion in the events of\r\ntwenty-five years ago!\r\n\r\nBut we comrades call out: His Highness, Prince Bismarck, Duke of\r\nLauenburg--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n    Bismarck replied with more pith:\r\n\r\nYour Majesty will allow me to lay my humblest thanks at your feet. My\r\nmilitary position with regard to your Majesty does not permit me to\r\nfurther express my feelings to your Majesty. I thank your Majesty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE EMPEROR WILLIAM CANAL\r\n\r\nKIEL, JUNE 21, 1895\r\n\r\n    In furthering Germany's economic and industrial development, the\r\n    building of canals has served an important function in reducing\r\n    the cost of transportation and in making possible competition with\r\n    other nations. Although the Emperor William Canal was an idea of\r\n    Bismarck's, his name is not here mentioned. Emperor William II\r\n    has taken a very lively interest in this development of inland\r\n    waterways and has rendered a great service to the industrial\r\n    development of his country in this regard.\r\n\r\nIn memory of Emperor William the Great, I baptize the canal \"Emperor\r\nWilliam Canal.\"\r\n\r\n    The Emperor then accompanied his three hammer strokes with the\r\n    following words: \"In the name of the Triune God, to the honor of\r\n    Emperor William, to the blessing of Germany, and to the welfare of\r\n    the people!\"\r\n\r\n    He proposed this toast at the banquet:\r\n\r\nI behold with pleasure and with pride this brilliant and festive\r\ngathering, and in the name of my honored colleagues I bid you all, the\r\nguests of the empire, most heartily welcome. We wish to express our\r\ninmost thanks for the interest you have taken in the completion of a\r\nwork which, begun in peace and accomplished in peace, is to-day given\r\nover to general trade.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in our own day that the idea first existed of joining\r\nthe North and Baltic Seas by a great canal; far back in the Middle Ages\r\nwe find drafts and plans for the working out of this undertaking. In\r\nthe past century the Eider Canal was built, which, while it affords a\r\nwonderful example of the ability of that day, still, as it was intended\r\nonly for the passage of the smaller craft, could not satisfy the\r\nincreased demands of the present day. It remained for the newly founded\r\nGerman Empire to find a satisfactory solution for this great problem.\r\n\r\nIt was my immortal grandfather, his Majesty, Emperor William the\r\nGreat, who, thoroughly appreciating the significance of the canal for\r\nincreasing the national welfare and strengthening our defense, devoted\r\nhis unflagging interest to the plan for the building of an effective\r\nwaterway between the North and the Baltic Seas and for overcoming the\r\nmany obstacles which stood in the way of its accomplishment. Joyfully\r\nand confidently the affiliated rulers of the empire, as well as the\r\nReichstag, followed the imperial initiative, and for eight years the\r\nwork was industriously carried on which, as it approached completion,\r\naroused in ever-increasing measure the public interest. What technic on\r\nthe basis of its great development has been able to accomplish, what\r\nwas possible through pride and joy in the work, what finally could be\r\ndone in promoting the welfare of the numberless workers engaged in the\r\ntask, in accordance with the principles of the humane social politics\r\nof the empire, has been accomplished in this undertaking. Therefore the\r\nFatherland dare rejoice with me and my noble colleagues in the success\r\nof this enterprise.\r\n\r\nHowever, we have worked not only for our own interests. In accordance\r\nwith the great cultural mission of the German people, we open the locks\r\nof the canal to the peaceful trading of the nations with each other,\r\nand it will give us great satisfaction if its increasing use shall\r\nprove not only that the intentions by which we were led are understood\r\nbut that they are becoming fruitful in increasing the welfare of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe interest in our celebration on the part of the powers whose\r\nrepresentatives we see among us, and whose magnificent ships we have\r\nto-day admired, I greet with greater joy the more I have the right to\r\nsee in it the complete justification of our efforts directed toward\r\nthe righteous maintenance of peace. Germany will also place the work\r\ninaugurated to-day in the service of peace and will consider herself\r\nfortunate if the Emperor William Canal strengthens and promotes in this\r\nservice for all time our friendly relations with the other powers.\r\n\r\nI empty my glass to the friendly sovereigns and powers. Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\nHurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF WORLD POLITICS\r\n\r\nJUNE 16, 1896--MARCH 22, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF WORLD POLITICS\r\n\r\nBERLIN, JUNE 16, 1896\r\n\r\n    It is difficult to fix any definite date at which any new movement\r\n    in politics may be said to have begun. Toward the close of the\r\n    year 1894 there appear unmistakable signs of a new dispensation.\r\n    In this year Caprivi, Bismarck's successor as Chancellor, retired\r\n    in favor of Prince Hohenlohe. The latter appears in his new office\r\n    for the first time in the session of the Reichstag which opened\r\n    December 5, 1894. In that session the insufficient protection of\r\n    Germans residing in foreign lands was repeatedly insisted upon, and\r\n    the colonizing spirit and the agitation for a very considerable\r\n    increase in the navy began to make themselves felt. The building\r\n    of three new cruisers was authorized, but the plan to erect a\r\n    dry dock at Kiel was rejected. The year 1895 was to be crowded\r\n    with festivals celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversaries of\r\n    the victories of the Franco-Prussian War, and there resulted a\r\n    consequent impetus to what might be called nascent imperialism.\r\n    This was further stimulated by outward events. In 1895 France,\r\n    Germany, and Russia intervened between Japan and China, then at\r\n    war. In 1897 Germany seized and then leased Kiaochow from China\r\n    for ninety-nine years and intervened in the war between Greece and\r\n    Turkey on behalf of the Turks. She began, therefore, to take a more\r\n    prominent part in world politics and definitely entered upon her\r\n    policy of expansion. The German people felt that this was rendered\r\n    necessary by the fact that Germany had become a great industrial\r\n    and exporting nation, whose interests demanded insistence on the\r\n    \"open-door\" policy. Her rapidly increasing population (the annual\r\n    increase was between 800,000 and 900,000) also, we are told, made\r\n    necessary the creation of new colonies to take care of surplus\r\n    population and to provide sustenance for those at home who were\r\n    being drawn off into industrial pursuits.\r\n\r\n    It should be remembered in this connection, however, that\r\n    emigration from Germany is very far from being on the increase. It\r\n    has diminished astonishingly since 1880. In the decade from 1880\r\n    to 1890 the annual emigration averaged about 135,000, and in 1881\r\n    it reached its highest point, 220,000. In the decade from 1900 to\r\n    1910 it never in any one year ran over 37,000 and averaged about\r\n    27,000--in other words, it had declined, in spite of the increase\r\n    in population and in the number of colonies, to one fifth of its\r\n    former proportions. The figures have only a relative significance.\r\n    The annual emigration from Belgium, for instance, which has little\r\n    more than one tenth the population of Germany, was considerably\r\n    higher, averaging 35,000 annually for the years from 1906 to 1910.\r\n    The annual emigration from the United Kingdom to places outside\r\n    of Europe in the same period was approximately 532,000 annually.\r\n    As, therefore, German emigration has in the last quarter century\r\n    steadily declined, it may be safely inferred that the problem of\r\n    finding colonies for her surplus population is not now, at least, a\r\n    more pressing one for Germany than it was twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\n    A conscientious American student of contemporary politics has said\r\n    quite justly that \"the most vital and burning problem in the world\r\n    to-day\" is the problem of Germany's _Weltpolitik_. It is not the\r\n    purpose of this volume to enter into questions of controversy.\r\n    He who wishes, however, to understand Germany's position and\r\n    the Emperor's position toward the world to-day must consider\r\n    carefully not only the problem itself but some of its practical\r\n    implications. In one of his bursts of enthusiasm the Emperor will\r\n    tell us later[9] that this policy implies that no question in the\r\n    world--no question of international politics, in other words--is to\r\n    be decided without Germany. This would mean, strictly interpreted,\r\n    that no transfer or change of status in colonial possessions--Cuba\r\n    or the Philippines, for instance--no international canal, like\r\n    Panama, could be made without her sanction. And there are those in\r\n    Germany, like Doctor Liman, who believe that this doctrine should\r\n    have been more rigidly maintained than had hitherto been the case.\r\n    _A priori_, Germany is, of course, as much entitled to the right\r\n    to pursue such a policy as any other power. Ethically, however--if\r\n    ethics have any place in the discussion--it must be the result\r\n    which justifies such a policy: not the results merely to the nation\r\n    pursuing the policy but the results also to the nation or tribe at\r\n    whose expense the policy is pursued. In the utilitarian phrase, it\r\n    must redound to the greater good of the greater number.\r\n\r\n    [9] \"Germany's greatness makes it impossible for her to do without\r\n        the ocean--but the ocean also proves that even in the distance,\r\n        and on its farther side, without Germany and the German Emperor\r\n        no great decision dare henceforth be taken.\" (July 3, 1900.)\r\n\r\n    A dispassionate consideration of Prussia's treatment of her\r\n    dependencies must convince any except the most partisan that her\r\n    efforts here have been far less successful than those of most other\r\n    nations, if they are not to be qualified as utter and absolute\r\n    failures. Chancellor Caprivi had said quite justly that the worst\r\n    blow an enemy could give him would be to force more territories in\r\n    Africa upon him. Nevertheless, Germany has since Caprivi's time\r\n    and at imminent risk of war acquired further African possessions.\r\n    The attempt to colonize Africa, begun, as we have seen, by the\r\n    Great Elector, was Germany's first venture in this field. Yet at no\r\n    time did the Germans seem to get on well with the blacks. In the\r\n    Emperor's speeches to the Reichstag he has spoken of his desire\r\n    to introduce Christian customs and Christian morality among the\r\n    negroes. Yet his attempts here were hardly successful. The Herreros\r\n    in Southwest Africa revolted and massacred German colonists,\r\n    sparing the Boers and English who had come before the German\r\n    occupation. Doctor Gibbons tells us that the suppression of this\r\n    rebellion took more than a year and cost Germany an appalling sum\r\n    of money and many lives. But it cost the natives more. Two thirds\r\n    of the nation of the Herreros were massacred, and, while only six\r\n    or seven thousand were in arms, the German official report states\r\n    that forty thousand were killed. The Germans confiscated all the\r\n    lands of the natives. In 1906, after twenty-one years of German\r\n    rule, there were in Southwest Africa sixteen thousand prisoners of\r\n    war out of a total native population of thirty-one thousand. All\r\n    the natives lived in concentration camps and were forced to work\r\n    for the government. It may be conceded that Germany's problem here\r\n    was a difficult one; it must also be recognized that her policy had\r\n    been neither of advantage to the natives nor to Germany herself.\r\n\r\n    In other cases, where the problem would seem to have been simpler,\r\n    the results have likewise been disastrous. It is not our purpose\r\n    to give the reasons but to state the facts. After one hundred\r\n    and twenty-five years of incorporation into Prussia the Poles\r\n    of East Prussia have in large part not been amalgamated and are\r\n    still the victims of discriminatory legislation. In judging such a\r\n    policy it is not merely a question as to whether Alsace-Lorraine,\r\n    for instance, did or did not once belong to Germany. Morally it\r\n    is difficult to concede to any nation the right to govern any\r\n    population which it makes permanently unhappy. After forty-four\r\n    years the problem of Alsace-Lorraine seemed to be very little\r\n    nearer a solution than it was at its inception. It is a mistake\r\n    to believe that the discontent was due principally to the fact\r\n    that the inhabitants must transfer their allegiance from France to\r\n    Germany. The discontent was due to the empire's refusal to give the\r\n    population rights and status compatible with their self-respect\r\n    as enlightened subjects of a twentieth-century government. Men of\r\n    German as well as of French descent, and even German emigrants who\r\n    were induced to settle in the province since 1870, took part in the\r\n    opposition. In a recent haphazard list of the \"real leaders\" of\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine, we find the following six names: Wetterlé, Preiss,\r\n    Blumenthal, Weber, Bucher, and Theodor. Of these the last five,\r\n    at least, are wholly or in part of German descent. Yet the most\r\n    serious demonstration in Metz since its annexation took place in\r\n    June, 1910. On July 25 of that same year, for the first time since\r\n    the University of Strasburg had been re-established by the Germans,\r\n    a professor was hissed out of his lecture-room; and, as we have\r\n    seen, in spite of an energetic propaganda by German newspapers, in\r\n    1912 more Alsacians enlisted in the French Foreign Legion than in\r\n    any single year since 1871. The situation in that province has been\r\n    already discussed in connection with the Emperor's speech of March\r\n    14, 1891. Quite evidently, the problem there was hardly on the\r\n    way to successful solution in August, 1914. Of course, Germany's\r\n    success in colonizing is not the only question to be considered\r\n    with regard to her _Weltpolitik_. It is, however, an essential\r\n    factor.\r\n\r\n    As will be evident from subsequent addresses, it was the Emperor\r\n    who everywhere gave the initial impulse. Whether or not he involved\r\n    himself in contradictions here, the student must decide. To\r\n    certain of his subjects he appeared to be doing so, and it was\r\n    for this reason that one of his hostile critics, Doctor Liman,\r\n    tells us in bitterness that German politics of the last twenty\r\n    years is \"a fantastic mixture of tearful longing for peace and\r\n    an inflated desire for prestige.\" (\"Der Kaiser,\" p. 317.) The\r\n    present empire had been proclaimed on the 18th of January, 1871,\r\n    and the anniversary marked the crowning celebration of the year.\r\n    In his speech the Emperor announces that \"The German Empire has\r\n    become a world-empire.\" This may be said to provide the key to his\r\n    subsequent policy and to mark the dawning of a new era. The address\r\n    was delivered at a dinner held in the Royal Palace.\r\n\r\nThe present day, like the entire year in all its festivities, is\r\na day of grateful retrospect. It is a continued high festival of\r\ngratitude for and in commemoration of the great departed Emperor. A\r\nblessing rests upon the present day, and over it hovers the spirit\r\nof him who lies in Charlottenburg,[10] and of him who sleeps in the\r\nFriedenskirche.[11] What our fathers had hoped and what German youth\r\nin her dreams had sung and desired it was granted to them, the two\r\nEmperors, to achieve; working with the princes, it was granted to them\r\nto reconquer and re-establish the German Empire. We are privileged\r\ngratefully to enjoy its advantages; we have a right to rejoice on\r\nthe present day. Nevertheless, it is our earnest duty to maintain\r\nwhat the great lords have won for us. The German Empire has become a\r\nworld-empire. Everywhere in distant quarters of the earth thousands of\r\nour countrymen are living. German guardians, German science, German\r\nindustry are going across the sea. The value of what Germany has upon\r\nthe seas amounts to thousands of millions. It is your earnest duty,\r\ngentlemen, to help to bind this greater German Empire firmly to our\r\nancestral home. The vow which I made you to-day can become truth only\r\nif you are animated by a united patriotic spirit and grant me your\r\nfullest support. It is my wish that, standing in closest union, you\r\nhelp me to do my duty not only to my countrymen in a narrower sense\r\nbut also to the many thousands of countrymen in foreign lands. This\r\nmeans that I may be able to protect them if I must. It is with this\r\nwish, and deeply conscious of the injunction which is issued to us\r\nall--\"What you have inherited from your fathers, conquer it in order\r\nthat you may possess it\"--that I raise my glass to our beloved German\r\nFatherland and call out: Long live the German Empire!--once again, may\r\nit live!--and a third time, long live the Empire!\r\n\r\n[10] Emperor William I.\r\n\r\n[11] Emperor Frederick III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE RECRUITS FOR THE NAVY\r\n\r\nWILHELMSHAVEN, FEBRUARY 21, 1896\r\n\r\n    On the occasion of administering the oath to the naval recruits at\r\n    Wilhelmshaven the Emperor delivered the following address:\r\n\r\nIn the sight of God and of His servants you have sworn to me the oath\r\nof allegiance, and I expect from you that you will become good and\r\nsturdy sailors. Keep to what you have sworn, for \"one man, one word.\"\r\nThe soldiers of the army frequently have the occasion to show what\r\nthey have learned and what they are capable of under the eyes of their\r\nsuperiors. This is not true in the navy, for many of you will be for\r\nyears in foreign waters. But you must not think that on that account my\r\neyes have been turned away from you.\r\n\r\nIn relation to other navies our own navy is still small, is in the\r\nbudding stage; but through our discipline we must become strong and\r\nby it compensate for all that we lack in material strength. What is\r\ndiscipline? Nothing but the unconditional subjection of our own will\r\nto a higher will. Even if every one intends to do good, he must none\r\nthe less subordinate his intention to the good of the whole. Only\r\nby holding together can we create a firm body that will be able to\r\naccomplish something complete and great.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOAST TO THE RUSSIAN EMPEROR AND EMPRESS\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG, AUGUST 8, 1897\r\n\r\n    The visit which the Czar had paid Emperor William at Breslau\r\n    the year before (September 5, 1896) had led to unfortunate\r\n    consequences. The Czar, in his answer to the wishes of the Emperor\r\n    that the two empires might draw more closely together, had\r\n    announced, according to the official report, that he was animated\r\n    by the same traditional sentiments as his Majesty, Emperor William\r\n    II. Certain important papers printed a reading which made it appear\r\n    that the Czar had said that he shared the same feelings which had\r\n    moved his father (who was notoriously anti-German). The State\r\n    Secretary, Von Marschall, was drawn into an ugly suit as a result.\r\n    It was stated that the Foreign Office was involved. Although this\r\n    was not true, it left a decidedly bad impression, and several\r\n    officials resigned.\r\n\r\n    On the occasion of the visit of the German Emperor and Empress to\r\n    St. Petersburg they were greeted by a most friendly address of\r\n    welcome from the Czar, and Emperor William II was made an admiral\r\n    of the Russian fleet. On this occasion he offered the following\r\n    toast to the Russian Emperor and Empress:\r\n\r\nIn the name of her Majesty, the Empress, and in my own, I thank your\r\nMajesty warmly for the hearty and magnificent reception which you have\r\ngiven us and for the gracious words with which your Majesty has so\r\nlovingly bid us welcome. At the same time, with deep feeling I would\r\nlike to lay at the feet of your Majesty my grateful acknowledgment\r\nfor the renewed and unexpected distinction which your Majesty has\r\nconferred upon me in giving me a place in your glorious fleet. This\r\nis a particular honor, which I appreciate at its full significance\r\nand which is also a distinction conferred very particularly upon my\r\nnavy. In my appointment as a Russian admiral I see not only an honor\r\nconferred upon my person but also a new evidence for the perpetuation\r\nof the close relationship, traditional and unshakable, which exists\r\nbetween our two empires. The unalterable decision of your Majesty to\r\npreserve now and hereafter peace for your people finds in me also a\r\njoyful echo, and wandering together in the same way we two shall strive\r\nin concert, under the blessing of this peace, to guide the cultural\r\ndevelopment of our peoples. My whole people is behind me, I know, as\r\nI confidently lay this renewed pledge in the hands of your Majesty--I\r\nshall bestow upon your Majesty my most powerful support and stand at\r\nyour side with all my heart in this great work of preserving the peace\r\nfor the nations and in directing my strength against any one who might\r\nattempt to disturb or break this peace. I drink to the health of their\r\nMajesties, the Emperor and the Empress! [These last words the Emperor\r\nspoke in Russian.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY TRADITION\r\n\r\nCOBLENTZ, AUGUST 30, 1897\r\n\r\n    On this date the Emperor reviewed the great parade of the Eighth\r\n    Army Corps, under the leadership of the commanding general, the\r\n    Grand Duke of Baden. At the dinner after the review the Emperor\r\n    offered the following toast. The address illustrates what Doctor\r\n    Liman calls the romanticism of the Emperor. He is easily impressed\r\n    by his surroundings and speaks with particular animation and fervor\r\n    on the occasions (and they are frequent) in which the memories of\r\n    his ancestors are brought back to him:\r\n\r\nA review in the Rhine country, what an entrancing and what a beautiful\r\npicture! But a review on the shores of the River Rhine itself, and in\r\nsight of the old historic city of Coblentz--how this appeals to our\r\nhearts! The sight of the soldierly sons of the Rhine country, under the\r\ncommand of your Royal Highness, has moved me to deep joy. But it moves\r\nme with deep sadness, likewise, for the place on which we stand and the\r\ncity in which we tarry is a witness to a great time and reminds us of\r\ngreat names and figures.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, do not wish to forget that the time[12] which Emperor\r\nWilliam the Great spent in Coblentz was of deepest significance,\r\nespecially for us in the army. Here the work which he was called upon\r\nto carry through came to maturity; here it was granted him in quiet\r\nretirement to work out the organization of his army, which was often\r\nattacked with animosity and often misunderstood but which has so\r\nmagnificently justified itself. His nation under arms has proved in\r\nthree victorious wars that he was right.\r\n\r\n[12] 1850-7.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us turn from our glance into the past to the present day.\r\nThe splendid corps which I took from the hands of a general [Vogel von\r\nFalckenstein] whose name spelled bravery, whose conduct, chivalry,\r\nand whose life, fidelity on the battle-field and in peace, I have now\r\ngiven over to you, the grandson of the great Emperor, the son[13]\r\nof the lofty Princess who would not be deprived of the pleasure of\r\nappearing here to-day and, in the spirit of her great departed mother,\r\nof celebrating and tarrying for a while with us in memories.\r\n\r\n[13] The hereditary Grand Duke of Baden at this time was Frederick\r\n     William, born July 9, 1857, son of the Grand Duke Frederick I and\r\n     the Grand Duchess Louise-Marie, Princess of Prussia. The Grand\r\n     Duchess Louise-Marie was the daughter of Emperor William I. The\r\n     hereditary Grand Duke, who since the death of his father, in 1907,\r\n     has been reigning Grand Duke of Baden, is therefore a grandson\r\n     of William I and first cousin of the present Emperor, which will\r\n     explain the somewhat unusual familiarity of the Emperor's address.\r\n\r\nThe corps has been honored by the fact that his Royal Highness, the\r\nDuke of Cambridge, who was for a long time the highest in command of\r\nthe brave British army, has decided to appear here and to lead before\r\nme his gallant historic regiment. I express my hearty thanks to your\r\nRoyal Highness. The corps, is indeed, highly fortunate in this. We\r\nare privileged to greet in the noble person of your Royal Highness an\r\nassociate, a contemporary of our departed great Emperor, about whom\r\nI know particularly that he always spoke with deepest respect and\r\ngreatest friendship of your Royal Highness, and that he always praised\r\nyour Royal Highness's military achievements.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fritz [turning to his Royal Highness, the hereditary Grand\r\nDuke], to-day's parade does you and the corps great honor in every\r\nrespect, and we can say with a clear conscience that the sons of the\r\nRhineland who have marched by to-day will do their duty as completely,\r\nand that they are as well trained and as brave as they were in the time\r\nof the great Emperor. _It is our duty to maintain, in all its parts,\r\nthe army, the work of the great Emperor, against every influence and to\r\ndefend it against every opposition from without_, and I hope that every\r\ngeneral will be as faithful and as upright as you are, and that he will\r\nstrive to achieve this aim in his field with as good results as you\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nWith this hope I raise my glass and drink to the health of the Eighth\r\nArmy Corps and its commanding general. The Eighth Army Corps! Hurrah!\r\nHurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAST TO THE ITALIAN KING AND QUEEN\r\n\r\nHOMBURG, SEPTEMBER 4, 1897\r\n\r\n    On this day the Emperor reviewed the Eleventh Army Corps, which was\r\n    under the command of General von Wittich, in the presence of the\r\n    Empress and of the King and Queen of Italy. At the banquet which\r\n    followed in the Castle of Homburg, the Emperor offered this toast:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WITTICH:\r\n\r\nI am happy to be able to express to you before our royal and princely\r\nguests and to the whole army corps my heartiest congratulations on\r\nthis day. I am pleased to be able to say that the present day in its\r\nachievements does not suffer in the least by comparison with the day\r\nwhen, many years ago,[14] the corps defiled before my late grandfather,\r\nmy dear father, and the late Grand Duke. I thank his Royal Highness,\r\nthe Grand Duke, for the splendid division which he has led, and I am\r\npleased to see him at the head of the magnificent troops which have\r\ndone such great things under his father.\r\n\r\n[14] September 25, 1883.\r\n\r\nA great honor has been conferred upon the corps through the fact\r\nthat riding at the head of one of his regiments [13th Hessian Hussar\r\nRegiment] his Majesty, King Humbert of Italy, has led it before us.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty! My army thanks your Majesty whole-heartedly for the great\r\nhonor which has been conferred upon it. Not only my army but also the\r\nwhole German Fatherland greets in the person of your Majesty the lofty\r\nprince, the close friend of my departed father, the faithful ally,\r\nwhose coming here shows again to us and to the world that the bond of\r\nthe triple alliance stands firm and inviolate, the triple alliance\r\nwhich was founded in the interest of peace and which, as time goes on,\r\nstrikes deeper and firmer root in the consciousness of the peoples, in\r\norder finally to bring forth greater fruit.\r\n\r\nIn deepest gratitude I bid the great Queen welcome in the name of\r\nmy people. We rejoice that she has not disdained to come here,\r\nleaving behind her her repose and her activities dedicated to art and\r\nliterature, and that she should have graced with her fair presence this\r\ncamp of our soldiers. Her Majesty is particularly dear and precious to\r\nus Germans, because she is like the image of the great constellation to\r\nwhich her people and Fatherland look up with confidence; because the\r\nartist, the wise man, the musician, and the student always have free\r\naccess to her, and because under the protection of her Majesty so many\r\na German can fulfil his life devoted to learning and so many an invalid\r\ncan go in search of his health to the beautiful sunny south.\r\n\r\nWith a whole heart I bid you both welcome, and call out with my\r\nEleventh Corps: Their Majesties, the King and Queen of Italy!--Hurrah!\r\nHurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT A DEDICATION OF FLAGS\r\n\r\nBERLIN, OCTOBER 18, 1897\r\n\r\n    On this occasion sixty-three new flags were dedicated to the newly\r\n    formed regiments of the guard, of the First to the Eleventh and of\r\n    the Fifteenth to the Seventeenth Army Corps. The Emperor and people\r\n    celebrate this anniversary of the battle of Leipzig, 1813, with\r\n    particularly patriotic demonstrations, and he almost invariably\r\n    makes it the occasion for a military address. After the religious\r\n    ceremony the Emperor addressed the following words to his troops:\r\n\r\nThe flags which have just now been consecrated before the altar of\r\nGod and which have received His blessing I now turn over to the new\r\nregiments which spring from their old and proved predecessors in\r\naccordance with the custom of our army, which forever renews itself and\r\nits youth out of the ranks of its older and proved regiments. I do this\r\nin a hallowed place, before the statue of the great King and before\r\nthe windows of the great Emperor. If the site is holy, so too is the\r\nday. It is the anniversary of the great victory after which the German\r\npeople for the first time dared look forward in prospect to the dawn of\r\ncoming union and the future greatness which was conditioned thereby.\r\nThe day on which, for everlasting memory, the October fires leap from\r\nGermany's hills is the birthday of the heroic first German Crown Prince\r\nand of the second German Emperor.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] Frederick III.\r\n\r\nOut of the old and proved regiments which he led to battle and victory\r\nthe shoots have been taken for these new ones to which I now turn over\r\ntheir field insignia. May Almighty God, who has ever been so faithful\r\nand well intentioned to our Prussia and to the whole German Fatherland,\r\nhelp always to maintain the vows of the thousands of German youths who\r\nshall stream from the circles of the people to these new flags and who\r\nbefore them shall swear their oath of allegiance!\r\n\r\nI hope that in these regiments the qualities of the great Emperor will\r\nlive on--the absolutely unselfish devotion to the whole, the unreserved\r\nsacrifice of one's own capacity, bodily as well as spiritual, for\r\nthe honor of the army and for the safety of the beloved Fatherland.\r\nThen, I am convinced, will the foundations remain firm and intact in\r\nthese new regiments, the foundations upon which the discipline of our\r\narmy rests--bravery, sense of honor, and absolute and unconditional\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nThis is my wish for the new regiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nON ADMINISTERING THE OATH TO THE RECRUITS\r\n\r\nBERLIN, NOVEMBER 18, 1897\r\n\r\n    After the administering of the oath to the recruits of the\r\n    garrisons of Berlin, Charlottenburg, and Spandau by the\r\n    representatives of the Evangelical and the Catholic churches, the\r\n    Emperor took the occasion to deliver the following admonition:\r\n\r\nTo-day I greet you as soldiers of my army, as grenadiers of my guard.\r\nWith the oath to the flag you have sworn allegiance as German men,\r\nand even before the altar of God, under the open skies, and upon His\r\ncrucifix, as good Christians must. He who is not a good Christian is\r\nnot a brave man and no Prussian soldier; and he cannot fulfil under any\r\ncircumstances what is demanded of a soldier in the Prussian army.\r\n\r\nYour duty is not easy; it demands of you self-control and\r\nself-abnegation, the two highest qualities of a Christian, and in\r\naddition unconditional obedience and subordination to the will of those\r\nwho are appointed above you.\r\n\r\nBut you have examples before you out of the history of the German army.\r\nThousands before your time have sworn their oath and kept it. And\r\nbecause they did keep it our Fatherland has become great and our army\r\nvictorious and unconquerable. Because they kept their oath, their flags\r\nstand before you, garlanded with honor and covered with the tokens of\r\nglory, and wherever they are shown, heads are uncovered and regiments\r\npresent arms.\r\n\r\nIn the time of your service temptation will surely draw near to many of\r\nyou. If it does approach, either with regard to your personal conduct\r\nor with regard to your relationship as a soldier, turn it from you with\r\nthe thought of the past of your regiments; turn it from you with the\r\nthought of your uniform, which is the uniform of your King. Whoever\r\noffends against the uniform of the King lays himself open to the most\r\ngrievous punishments. Wear your uniform in such wise that you will\r\ncompel respect from the world and from those who oppose you.\r\n\r\nMy glorious ancestors look down upon you from the vaulted heavens. The\r\nmonuments of the Kings look down upon you and, above all, the statue of\r\nthe great Emperor. When you are discharging your service remember the\r\ngrievous times through which our Fatherland had to pass; remember them\r\nwhen your labor seems heavy and bitter. Stand firm in your inviolable\r\nfaith and trust in God who never forsakes us. Then will my army and\r\nespecially my guard be equal to its task in all times, whether in peace\r\nor war.\r\n\r\nIt is now your task to stand faithfully by me and to defend our highest\r\npossessions, whether against enemies from without or from within, and\r\nto obey when I command and never to forsake me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE SITUATION AND THE MAILED FIST\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 15, 1897\r\n\r\n    In accordance with her general colonial policy, Germany had for\r\n    some time been attempting to obtain a footing in China. Already\r\n    in 1895 the German consul-general had arranged an agreement with\r\n    the Chinese authorities which was to allow the establishing of\r\n    a base at Hangchow. German explorers had examined the coast and\r\n    had noticed the favorable situation of the harbor of Kiaochow.\r\n    In November, 1897, two German Catholic missionaries were\r\n    murdered. Admiral Diedrichs, who is remembered in America for\r\n    his interference with Admiral Dewey at Manila Bay, resolved upon\r\n    immediate action, steamed into the harbor of Kiaochow and took\r\n    possession of the island of Tsingtao. He announced the occupation\r\n    of the bay and of all the islands and dependencies on November\r\n    15. An indemnity of 200,000 _taels_ was demanded, as well as the\r\n    repayment of the expenses of the occupation, a ninety-nine year\r\n    lease of the captive territory, and the cession of all mining\r\n    rights and railway privileges. All this was granted, and Germany\r\n    made good use of her privileges. At the outbreak of the European\r\n    war the country had been developed and reclaimed to such a degree\r\n    that Tsingtao with its buildings and forts looked like a bit of\r\n    Prussia set into the Chinese coast.\r\n\r\n    Through her occupation of this rich province and through the\r\n    fact that Germany thus established a naval base opposite Japan's\r\n    coast, she incurred the ill will of Japan. This ill will was\r\n    later to be increased through Germany's conduct with regard to\r\n    commerce regulations. At the time of the occupation Germany\r\n    declared that Tsingtao was to be a port open to all the world.\r\n    Subsequent regulations which she had made amounted to very serious\r\n    discrimination against the commerce of other nations, especially\r\n    that of the Japanese, which had already attained considerable\r\n    importance. A plan was evolved in 1906 according to which Chinese\r\n    customs duties were allowed to be collected in the colony in return\r\n    for an annual consideration, which amounted to twenty per cent of\r\n    the entire customs duties of the Tsingtao district. In this way,\r\n    what she allowed China to collect from German merchants she forced\r\n    China to pay back to her. Other merchants were, of course, likewise\r\n    forced to pay the duties, and Germany received a considerable\r\n    percentage of the toll. The discrimination, if not obvious, was\r\n    very real, and the feeling of the Japanese distinctly hostile.\r\n\r\n    Prince Henry was sent out to take command of the increased East\r\n    Asiatic Squadron on December 16, 1897, and took command in the\r\n    following March. On the eve of his departure a great farewell\r\n    dinner was given him in the Royal Palace at Kiel. The Emperor spoke\r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HENRY:\r\n\r\nAs I rode into Kiel to-day I thought of the many times on which I had\r\nvisited this city joyfully at your side and on my ships, either to be\r\npresent at the sports or at some one of our military undertakings. On\r\nmy arrival in the city to-day an earnest and deep feeling moved me,\r\nfor I am perfectly conscious of the task which I have set before you\r\nand of the responsibility which I bear. But I am likewise conscious\r\nof the fact that it is my duty to build up and carry farther what my\r\npredecessors have bequeathed to me.\r\n\r\nThe journey which you are to undertake and the task which you are to\r\naccomplish indicate nothing new in themselves; it is merely the logical\r\nconsequence of what my departed grandfather and his great Chancellor\r\ninaugurated politically and what our glorious father won with his sword\r\non the field of battle. It is nothing more than the first expression of\r\nthe newly united and newly arisen German Empire in its tasks beyond the\r\nseas. The empire has developed so astonishingly through the extension\r\nof its commercial interests that it is my duty to follow up the new\r\nGerman Hansa and to give it the protection which it has a right to\r\nexpect from the empire and the Emperor.\r\n\r\nOur German brothers of the church who have gone out to their quiet\r\nwork and have not spared risking their lives in order to spread and\r\nmake a home for our religion on foreign soil have placed themselves\r\nunder my protection, and it is now a question of providing support\r\nand safety for these brothers who have been so often insulted and\r\noppressed. For that reason the undertaking which I intrust to you and\r\nwhich you must fulfil in company with your comrades and the ships\r\nwhich are already out there is really one of protection and not one\r\nof defiance. Under the protecting banner of our German flag of war\r\nwe expect that the rights which we are justified in demanding will\r\nbe guaranteed to our commerce, to the German merchant, and to German\r\nships--the same right which is vouchsafed by strangers to all other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nOur commerce is not new; in old times the Hanseatic League was one\r\nof the most powerful enterprises which the world has ever seen, and\r\nthe German cities were able to build a fleet such as the sea's broad\r\nback had never carried in earlier days, but finally it came to naught\r\nbecause the one condition was lacking, namely that of an Emperor's\r\nprotection. Now things have changed; the first condition, the German\r\nEmpire, has been created; the second condition, German commerce,\r\nflourishes and develops, and it can only develop properly and securely\r\nif it feels itself safe under the power of the empire. Imperial power\r\nmeans sea power, and sea power and imperial power are so interdependent\r\nthat the one cannot exist without the other.\r\n\r\nAs a token of this imperial sea power the squadron which has been\r\nstrengthened by your division must now take its place, with all the\r\ncomrades of the foreign fleet out there in close relationship and\r\non good terms of friendship, but for the purpose of protecting our\r\nparticular interests against every one who might be tempted to intrude\r\nupon the right of the Germans. That is your task and your mission.\r\n\r\nMake it clear to every European there, to the German merchant, and,\r\nabove all things, to the foreigner in whose country we are or with\r\nwhom we have to deal, that the German _Michel_[16] has set his shield,\r\ndecorated with the imperial eagle, firmly upon the ground. Whoever\r\nasks him for protection will always receive it. And may our countrymen\r\nout there cherish the firm conviction, whether they are priests or\r\nmerchants or whatever profession they follow, that the protection\r\nof the German Empire as exemplified in the Emperor's ships will\r\ncontinuously be granted them! But if any one should undertake to insult\r\nus in our rights or to wish to harm us, then drive in with the mailed\r\nfist and, as God wills, bind about your young brow the laurels which no\r\none in the entire German Empire will begrudge you!\r\n\r\n[16] The German _Michel_ is the proverbial representative of the German\r\n     character, as Uncle Sam is of the American or John Bull of the\r\n     English. He is usually pictured as a simple, good-natured fellow.\r\n\r\nIn the firm conviction that you, following good examples--and, God\r\nbe praised, examples are not wanting in our house--will carry out my\r\nthoughts and wishes, I raise my glass and drink it to your health, with\r\nthe wish for a good voyage, for a happy issue to your task, and for\r\na joyous return. Long live his Royal Highness, Prince Henry! Hurrah!\r\nHurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE REGIMENTS OF THE BODY-GUARD\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, JUNE 16, 1898\r\n\r\n    On the day of the tenth anniversary of his coming to the throne\r\n    the Emperor assembled the regiments of the guard in the gardens of\r\n    Potsdam and made them the following address:\r\n\r\nThe most important heritage which my noble grandfather and father left\r\nme is the army, and I received it with pride and joy. To it I addressed\r\nmy first decree when I mounted the throne. As I enter into the next\r\ndecade of my reign I again address it in these words: You who are\r\nnow assembled here constitute the 1st Infantry Regiment of the guard,\r\nin which I grew up; the Regiment of the Gardes du Corps, the most\r\ndistinguished regiment of the cavalry body-guard of the Prussian Kings;\r\nthe Hussar Regiment of the Body-Guard, which I have always commanded;\r\nand the Cadet Corps of the Infantry Battalion, which represents the\r\nentire army and which in Potsdam enjoys the honor of providing the\r\nguard for the King and his house.\r\n\r\nPerhaps never did an army suffer such severe loss as in the year 1888.\r\nNever has an army lost in the course of a single year two such powerful\r\nleaders crowned with laurel and honor, who were at the same time its\r\nwar lords.[17] I look back gratefully upon the years which have passed\r\nsince that time.\r\n\r\n[17] It is interesting to note that the Emperor here himself explicitly\r\n     makes the distinction between commander of an army, _Heerführer_,\r\n     and war lord, _Kriegsherr_, a title which can only be bestowed\r\n     upon the Emperor.\r\n\r\nSeldom has so difficult a task fallen to the lot of a successor who\r\nin a brief period had been forced to see both his grandfather and his\r\nfather carried away by death. The crown was weighed down with heavy\r\ncares. Every one lacked confidence in me; everywhere I was falsely\r\njudged. One alone believed in me, one alone had faith--that was the\r\narmy. And leaning upon her, trusting upon our old guard, I took up my\r\nheavy charge, knowing well that the army was the main support of my\r\ncountry, the main support of the Prussian throne, to which the decision\r\nof God had called me. I therefore turn to you first to-day and express\r\nto you my congratulations and my gratitude, and in these expressions I\r\ninclude likewise with you all your brothers in the army. I am of the\r\nfirm conviction that, through the self-sacrificing devotion of the\r\nofficers and men in their faithful work of peace, the army during the\r\nlast ten years has been maintained in the same condition in which I\r\nreceived it from my departed predecessors.\r\n\r\nIn the next ten years, faithfully bound together, let us seek further\r\nthe unconditional fulfilment of our duty in old and unremitting labor,\r\nand may the main supports of our army remain forever intact! They are\r\ncourage, sense of honor, and unconditional, iron, blind obedience.\r\n\r\nThat is my wish which I to-day address to you and with you to the\r\nentire army.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DEATH OF PRINCE BISMARCK\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICHSRUH, AUGUST 2, 1898\r\n\r\n    After the founding of the German Empire Prince Bismarck, who\r\n    initiated and carried through many of the policies which brought\r\n    great prosperity to the German people, was looked upon with much\r\n    favor and enjoyed great popularity. Emperor William II, as has\r\n    been noted, dismissed him from his post as Imperial Chancellor in\r\n    the second year of his reign. His attitude toward Bismarck has\r\n    already been discussed (March 26, 1895). In most of his speeches\r\n    which recount the progress of the empire the Emperor is strangely\r\n    silent about this great figure in German history. When Bismarck\r\n    died, however (July 30, 1898), the Emperor immediately interrupted\r\n    his journey into the north and returned on the second of August to\r\n    pay his respects at the bier of the first Imperial Chancellor in\r\n    Friedrichsruh. On the same day he issued the following statement\r\n    which appeared that evening in the special edition of the\r\n    _Reichsanzeiger_.\r\n\r\n    It is noticeable that on this occasion the Emperor speaks of\r\n    his grandfather as \"William the Great.\" His tendency to set\r\n    his ancestors upon lofty pedestals and to praise them somewhat\r\n    extravagantly finds expression in many of the speeches. He was\r\n    very desirous of having his grandfather called by this title, and\r\n    here as everywhere took the initiative. His lead, however, was not\r\n    generally followed. When the city of Hamburg erected a monument\r\n    to William I the pedestal was left without an inscription. This\r\n    has been explained by the fact that they were unwilling to say,\r\n    \"William the Great,\" and afraid to say merely, \"William I.\"\r\n\r\nWith my lofty peers and with the whole German people I stand in\r\nmourning at the bier of the first Chancellor of the German Empire,\r\nPrince Otto von Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg. We who were witnesses of\r\nhis masterly work, who looked upon him as the master of statecraft,\r\nas the fearless champion in war as in peace, as the most devoted\r\nson of his Fatherland and most faithful servant of his Emperor, are\r\ndeeply shaken by the demise of the man in whom the Lord God created\r\nthe implement with which to carry into effect the deathless idea of\r\nGermany's union and greatness.\r\n\r\nAt this moment it is not fitting to recount all the deeds which the\r\ngreat departed accomplished, all the cares which he bore for the\r\nEmperor and the empire, all the successes which he won. They are too\r\npowerful and manifold, and only history can and will engrave them upon\r\nher brass tablets.\r\n\r\nBut I feel constrained to make some expression before the world of the\r\nwhole-hearted grief and grateful reverence which to-day fill the entire\r\nnation and, in the name of the nation, to make a vow that what he, the\r\ngreat Chancellor, built up under Emperor William the Great I shall\r\nmaintain and develop and, if need be, defend with our possessions and\r\nour blood.\r\n\r\nIn this may the Lord God help us!\r\n\r\nI commission you to bring to public attention this, my decree.\r\n\r\n                                                     WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\n  To the Imperial Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: \"OUR FUTURE LIES UPON THE WATER\"\r\n    THE EMPEROR ON SHIPBOARD IN THE AUTUMN OF 1898]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OUR FUTURE LIES UPON THE WATER\"\r\n\r\nSTETTIN, SEPTEMBER 23, 1898\r\n\r\n    A previous address shows that in the mind of the Emperor the idea\r\n    of world-empire carried with it the idea of naval supremacy. In\r\n    this period he was increasingly interested in the industrial and\r\n    especially the naval and maritime expansion of Germany. A number of\r\n    his speeches take up this subject; so, for instance, he was present\r\n    at the opening of the new harbor at Stettin and delivered this\r\n    address:\r\n\r\nWith full heart I congratulate you on your completed work. You began\r\nwith a fresh spirit of daring. You were able to begin it, thanks to the\r\ninterest of my departed grandfather, the great Emperor, who built the\r\niron girdle around the city. After the moment when this iron mantle\r\nfell you could take a larger and wider point of view. You did not delay\r\nbut carried it out with real Pomeranian recklessness and obstinacy. You\r\nhave succeeded, and I am pleased that the old Pomeranian spirit has\r\nagain come to life in you and has driven you from the land upon the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOur future lies upon the water, and I am deeply convinced that this\r\nwork which you, Herr Burgomaster, have carried out with foresight\r\nand care and energy will always be linked with your name, even after\r\ncenturies, by the grateful citizens of the city of Stettin and that\r\nyour work will always be recognized.\r\n\r\nBut I, as lord of the land and King, express my thanks to you that you\r\nhave brought the city of Stettin to such a flourishing position. I hope\r\nand expect, yes, I might say, I demand, that she shall go on developing\r\nat this same rate, not divided by party strife and with her glance\r\nfixed upon the great whole, in order that she may come to a state of\r\ndevelopment such as has never yet been achieved. That is my wish!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY TO THE HOLY LAND\r\n\r\nBETHLEHEM, OCTOBER 30, 1898\r\n\r\n    On the 12th of October, 1898, the Emperor and Empress set out on\r\n    their journey to the Holy Land, accompanied by many representatives\r\n    of the church. In Venice they visited the Italian King and Queen\r\n    and passed on by way of Messina and Constantinople. They reached\r\n    Jerusalem on October 29. During his stay at Constantinople the\r\n    Emperor obtained the rights to a piece of land, the _Dormitio\r\n    Sanctæ Virginis_, and turned it over to the German Catholics in\r\n    Jerusalem. On November 4 they began their return journey via\r\n    Damascus. Though the dedication of the Church of Our Redeemer\r\n    constituted the ostensible object of the visit, the Emperor had\r\n    also other purposes in mind. He took the occasion to announce that\r\n    he would protect the interests of all Germans of whatever faith.\r\n    This is the more significant when we remember that up to this time\r\n    the French had always been allowed to assume the duty of protecting\r\n    the Catholics there. The Emperor likewise had in mind increasing\r\n    his prestige in the East. One of the outward indications of the\r\n    growing friendliness between Turkey and Germany which was then\r\n    strengthened may be found in the fact that the building of the\r\n    Anatolian railway was intrusted to a German company, to which was\r\n    also granted a concession for a harbor and permission to extend the\r\n    line through Bagdad to Bassora.\r\n\r\n    It will be noted that the approach to Jerusalem aroused a very\r\n    unfavorable impression in the Emperor. Nevertheless, he had\r\n    somewhat unusual preparations made for his entrance. The old\r\n    walls of the sacred city were breached in order to allow him to\r\n    make his entry in imperial state. In pursuance of his policy as\r\n    a world-emperor he attempted during his visit, as we have seen,\r\n    both by his acts and by his speeches, to conciliate all sects and\r\n    creeds; the Catholics through the grant of land, which likewise\r\n    pleased the Centre or Catholic party at home; the Evangelicals\r\n    through the dedication of a church; and the Moslems incidentally\r\n    and through his speech nine days later at Damascus, in the course\r\n    of which he said: \"May the Sultan and may the three hundred\r\n    million Mohammedans who are scattered over the face of the earth\r\n    and who recognize him as their caliph be assured of the fact\r\n    that at all times the German Emperor will be their friend!\" This\r\n    friendship of the Emperor for the Sultan was not to be clouded by\r\n    the Armenian massacres, nor did the assassinations in Asia Minor\r\n    evoke any protest. Indeed, we are told by a well-known foreign\r\n    correspondent that \"five days after the great massacre of August,\r\n    1896, in Constantinople, when Turkish soldiers shot down their\r\n    fellow citizens under the eyes of the Sultan and of the foreign\r\n    ambassadors, William II sent to Abdul-Hamid for his birthday a\r\n    family photograph of himself with the Empress and his children.\" At\r\n    Damascus, he likewise laid a wreath upon the tomb of Saladin.\r\n\r\n    After the service in the Evangelical Church at Bethlehem the\r\n    Emperor gathered about him the Evangelical ministers and made them\r\n    this address, which was reported by E. Bosse, who at that time was\r\n    the Prussian _Kultusminister_.\r\n\r\nIf I am to give you the impressions of these last days, then I must\r\ntell you that, above all, I am very much disappointed. I did not wish\r\nto say that here, but after I had heard that the same thing had\r\nhappened to others also, and among them to my court chaplain, for\r\ninstance, I no longer wish to hide this from you. It may, indeed,\r\nbe that the very unfavorable approach to the city of Jerusalem has\r\ncontributed to this impression, but when one sees such conditions in\r\nthe holy places and sees how things happen there it cuts one to the\r\nquick.\r\n\r\nThat the emanation of the love of the Creator took place here where\r\nwe are now standing is a fact of extraordinary import, and yet how\r\nlittle does it correspond to what we have seen! I am, therefore, doubly\r\npleased to have received my first elevating impression in the Holy\r\nLand at this service among you. The particular example of Jerusalem\r\nwarns us insistently that we must suppress as far as possible the\r\nslight deviations in our sects, and that the Evangelical Church and the\r\nEvangelical creed must put forward a firmly united front here in the\r\nEast. Otherwise we can accomplish nothing. We can only work through\r\nexample, through the practice and proof that the gospel is a gospel of\r\nlove in all quarters of the heavens and that it bears other fruits.\r\n\r\nOnly the life of Christians can make any impression upon the\r\nMohammedans. No one can criticise them if they have little respect for\r\nthe Christian name. Our churches divide against each other. Indeed,\r\nthey must be restrained from quarrelling through the external power of\r\narms. In the political world, under all possible pretexts we take away\r\nfrom them [the Mohammedans] one piece of territory after another, for\r\nwhich we have no justification, so that our influence has been much\r\nweakened and we have fallen to a very low level.\r\n\r\nAnd now it is our turn! The German Empire and the German name have now\r\nwon a consideration in the entire Ottoman Empire such as has never\r\nexisted before. It is, therefore, for us to show what the Christian\r\nreligion really is, that the practice of Christian love even toward the\r\nMohammedan, not through dogmas and attempts at conversion but merely\r\nthrough example, is our plain duty. The Mohammedan is a very zealous\r\nbeliever, so that preaching alone will not suffice. But our culture,\r\nour institutions, the life which we live before them, the manner of our\r\nconduct toward them, and the proof that we are united among ourselves,\r\nthese alone will have effect.\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of examination which we must pass for our Protestant\r\nfaith and our creed. Through this we must give them proof of what\r\nChristianity is. In this way we may inspire in them an interest for\r\nour religion and for the Christian creed. See to it that this remains\r\nso!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION OF THE CHURCH OF OUR REDEEMER\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM, OCTOBER 31, 1898\r\n\r\n    The Church of Our Redeemer at Jerusalem was dedicated in the\r\n    presence of the Emperor by the general superintendent and head\r\n    court chaplain, Doctor Dryander, of Berlin. The church had been\r\n    planned by King Frederick William IV. After the dedication there\r\n    was a special church service, and after the prayer by the general\r\n    superintendent the Emperor offered the following address:\r\n\r\nGod has been gracious enough to allow us to dedicate in this city,\r\nwhich is holy to all Christians, and in this place, which is\r\nconsecrated by labors of true love, a house of worship which we\r\nhave built to honor the Saviour of the world. Through the building\r\nand dedication of the Church of Our Redeemer there has now come to\r\nsuccessful issue a plan which my blessed predecessors cherished for\r\nmore than half a century and sought to carry out as the protectors of\r\nthe work of love which was founded here in Evangelical interests.\r\n\r\nThrough the saving power of the love which serves, all hearts should\r\nnow here be brought to the consideration of those things in which alone\r\nthe troubled human spirit may find salvation, rest, and peace here and\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nAll Evangelical Christians, even far beyond Germany's borders, are\r\nfollowing our service here with closest interest and sympathy. The\r\ndelegates of the Evangelical congregation and many who share the\r\nEvangelical faith from all parts of the world have come with us to this\r\nplace in order to be personal witnesses to the completion of this work\r\nof faith and love through which the name of our great Lord and Saviour\r\nis to be glorified and the kingdom of God upon earth to be advanced.\r\n\r\nJerusalem, the lofty city on which our feet are standing, calls to mind\r\nmemories of the great act of redemption of our Lord and Saviour. She\r\nshows us the common labor which unites all Christians, regardless of\r\nconfessions and nations, in the apostolic faith.\r\n\r\nThe power which renewed the world through the gospel which originated\r\nhere drives us to follow Him; it warns us to look up in faith to Him\r\nwho died for us upon the cross. It warns us to be patient Christians\r\nand to carry out the doctrine of unselfish love of our neighbor in\r\nregard to all men. It promises us also that if we hold firm to the\r\ntrue teaching of the gospel even the gates of hell shall not prevail\r\nagainst our dear Evangelical Church.\r\n\r\nIt was in Jerusalem that was born the Light of the World, in whose\r\nsplendor our German people has grown great and powerful. What the\r\nGermanic peoples have become they have become under the protection of\r\nthe cross upon Golgotha and through the practice of self-sacrificing\r\nlove of their neighbors. Just as two thousand years ago, so to-day that\r\ncall, \"Peace upon earth,\" which voices the earnest hopes of us all,\r\nshould go forth to all the world.\r\n\r\nNot splendor, not might, not glory, not honor, not earthly goods it\r\nis that we seek here. We pant, beseech, and strive only for the one\r\nhighest good, the salvation of our souls, and as I now on this solemn\r\nday here repeat the vow of my ancestors who are resting in God, \"I and\r\nmy house, we will serve the Lord,\" so I ask you all to make the same\r\nvow. Let every one seek according to his position and his calling to\r\nbring it about that all those who bear the name of the crucified Lord\r\nwill live their lives under the sign of His holy name to a victory over\r\nall the dark powers which are begotten in sin and selfishness.\r\n\r\nMay God grant that rich streams of blessing may flow back from here\r\ninto united Christendom, and that on the throne as in the hut, that\r\nat home as abroad, trust in God, love of our fellows, patience in\r\naffliction, and thorough labor may remain the brightest jewels of the\r\nGerman people, and that the spirit of peace may permeate and hallow the\r\nEvangelical Church more and more.\r\n\r\nHe, the God of grace, will hear our prayers; that is our expectation.\r\nHe alone is the strong and safe retreat upon which we build.\r\n\r\n        \"Did we in our own strength confide,\r\n          Our striving would be losing;\r\n        Were not the right man on our side,\r\n          The man of God's own choosing.\r\n        Dost ask who that may be?\r\n        Christ Jesus, it is He;\r\n        Lord Sabaoth His name,\r\n        From age to age the same,\r\n          And He must win the battle.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[18] Luther's \"Ein' Feste Burg,\" translated by F. H. Hedge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY DIVINE RIGHT\r\n\r\nBRANDENBURG, FEBRUARY 3, 1899\r\n\r\n    There is a particular whole-heartedness noticeable in all of the\r\n    Emperor's speeches to his hereditary subjects, the Brandenburgers.\r\n    He seemed to take them most fully into his confidence and expect\r\n    from them a higher degree of loyalty and understanding. For them\r\n    he felt a particular kinship. His personal pretensions are,\r\n    therefore, set forth in these speeches and in those to the\r\n    Prussians, as for instance in his Königsberg speech (August 25,\r\n    1910) with less reserve than usual, if we may speak of reserve in\r\n    one who shows but little and who is unusually frank and personal\r\n    in his statements. It is for this reason that these speeches have\r\n    occasionally been severely criticised by his South German subjects,\r\n    as for instance by Doctor Liman in his \"Der Kaiser.\" This address\r\n    was delivered by the Emperor at a banquet which was given by Doctor\r\n    von Achenbach, _Oberpräsident_ of Brandenburg Province and Minister\r\n    of State, to the members of the Provincial Assembly. The wording\r\n    is taken from the \"_Reichsanzeiger_.\" The historical facts here\r\n    referred to will be found in chapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY HONORED PRESIDENT AND DEAR MEN OF BRANDENBURG:\r\n\r\nThe speech which we have just heard has laid before us in small compass\r\nand in patriotic spirit, embellished with poetic flights, the deeds of\r\nmy house and the history of our people. I think that I speak from the\r\nheart of all of you when I say that there were two circumstances which\r\nmade it possible for my ancestors and my house to discharge their tasks\r\nin this way. The first and prime circumstance was the fact that, above\r\nall other princes, and even in a time when perhaps such thoughts and\r\nfeelings were not yet current, they felt and discharged the personal\r\nresponsibility of the ruler toward Heaven. The second circumstance is\r\nthe fact that they had behind them the people of the mark. Let us look\r\nback to the time when Frederick I had been named Elector and when he\r\nexchanged his magnificent Frankish home country for the mark, which at\r\nthat time was in a condition which we can hardly picture to ourselves\r\neven from the description of historians. We can only understand this\r\nexchange on the assumption that the ruler felt within himself the\r\ncall to journey to this land, which had been intrusted to him by the\r\nimperial protection in order here to bring about a better-ordered\r\ncondition, not only for the Emperor's sake or for his own sake, but he\r\nwas convinced that the task had been given him from above.\r\n\r\nThe same conviction we shall find in all of my ancestors. Their great\r\nbattles without and the development and the making of laws within\r\nthe country have always been dictated by the thought that they were\r\nresponsible for the people given over to them and for the country which\r\nhad been intrusted to them.\r\n\r\nYour President has been kind enough to mention our journey to Palestine\r\nand the acts which I accomplished there. I dare say that many different\r\nimpressions of a lofty nature forced themselves upon me, and they were\r\npartly religious, partly historical, and partly drawn from modern life,\r\nbut aside from the celebration in our church (October 31, 1898), the\r\nloftiest and the deepest was the consciousness that I was standing on\r\nthe Mount of Olives, that I was treading upon the very place where the\r\ngreatest battle which was ever fought out upon the earth, the battle\r\nfor the salvation of mankind, had been fought out by our Saviour. This\r\nfact moved me, as it were, on that same day to renew my oath to the\r\nflag above that I would leave nothing untried in order to unite my\r\npeople and to push aside whatever might be able to divide it.\r\n\r\nBut as I was tarrying in the far country, and in different places where\r\nwe Germans feel so keenly the lack of dear woods and beautiful waters,\r\nI remembered the lakes of the mark with their dark, clear waves, and\r\nthe woods of oak and of fir, and I thought to myself that, although in\r\nEurope they sometimes looked down upon us, we are none the less much\r\nbetter off in Brandenburg than in foreign countries. And when I think\r\nof the tree and of the use we make of it and our love for the woods I\r\nam reminded of an incident that is very interesting for us as we begin\r\nto develop the empire.\r\n\r\nIt was after the great and noble achievements of the year 1870-1. The\r\ntroops had returned home; the tumult and the enthusiasm had subsided,\r\nand the old work of founding and developing our newly conquered\r\nFatherland was now to begin. There, for the first time, the three\r\npaladins of the great old Emperor, the great General,[19] the powerful\r\nChancellor,[20] and the faithful Minister of War,[21] were sitting\r\ntogether at their common meal. After they had emptied the first glass\r\nto the Lord of the Land and to the Fatherland, the Chancellor spoke and\r\nturning to his two colleagues said: \"We have now achieved everything\r\nfor which we have striven, suffered, and fought. We have reached the\r\nhighest point of which we had ever dreamed. What can there now be,\r\nafter what we have lived through, which shall interest or elevate or\r\ninspire us?\" There was a pause and then the old master of battles said\r\nsuddenly, \"We can watch the tree grow,\" and a deep silence fell upon\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n[19] Moltke.\r\n\r\n[20] Bismarck.\r\n\r\n[21] Roon.\r\n\r\nYes, gentlemen! The tree which we watch growing and for which we must\r\ncare is the German imperial oak. A healthy growth is in store for it\r\nbecause it stands under the protection of the people of the mark in\r\nwhose land it is rooted. It has lived through many a storm and has\r\noften been threatened, but the stalk and the shoot which are sunk in\r\nthe sands of the mark will, God willing, endure to all eternity!\r\n\r\nI can merely vow once again to-day to do everything for it that is in\r\nmy power! And even the journey to hallowed shrines and places will help\r\nme in this, and I shall be better able, therefore, to protect this\r\ntree and to watch and foster it, cutting back like a good gardener\r\nthe branches which are superfluous, and keeping watch upon and\r\nexterminating the animals which would gnaw at its roots. I hope that\r\nI may then see this picture. The tree will have developed gloriously\r\nand before it the German _Michel_ will be standing, his hand upon his\r\nsword, and looking out into the distance in order to protect it. That\r\npeace stands firm which stands under the shield and under the sword of\r\nthe German _Michel_.\r\n\r\nIt is a magnificent thing to begin with the idea of bringing peace to\r\nall the nations; but an error is likely to slip into our calculations.\r\nSo long as there is unregenerate sin in humanity, so long there will\r\nbe war and hatred, envy and discord, and one man will try to take\r\nadvantage of another. But the rules which govern men govern nations\r\nalso. Therefore we must see to it that we Germans, at least, stand\r\ntogether like a firm block. Far beyond the seas[22] and here in Europe,\r\nmay every wave that threatens peace break upon this \"_rocher de\r\nbronze_\" of the German people! But it is the mark and its inhabitants\r\nfirst of all which are called upon to help me in this, and as I assume\r\nthat it is not hard for you to follow the black and white banner and\r\nyour red one,[23] so I hope that I shall be understood by you when I say\r\nthat I intend to look for aid to the mark now and hereafter, and that I\r\ncount upon its loyal support!\r\n\r\n[22] The Spanish-American War was ended by treaty December 10, 1898.\r\n\r\n[23] The flag of Brandenburg is a red griffin on a white field.\r\n\r\nTherefore I raise my glass and call out: Long live Brandenburg and the\r\ninhabitants of the mark. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAGUE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nWIESBADEN, MAY 18, 1899\r\n\r\n    On the Czar's birthday the Emperor was present at the banquet given\r\n    in Wiesbaden, to which the Russian Ambassador, Count Osten-Sacken,\r\n    had been invited. The Emperor proposed the following toast. On the\r\n    same day the peace conference at The Hague had been opened and the\r\n    Russian delegate De Staal had been elected its president. At the\r\n    end of August, 1898, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs had\r\n    issued the following communication to all the representatives of\r\n    the powers in St. Petersburg. \"The maintenance of universal peace\r\n    and a possible reduction of the armaments which burden all nations\r\n    in the present state of civilization is an ideal for all the world\r\n    toward which all governments must be directed.\" The Czar believed\r\n    that a conference might achieve this object, and he suggested that\r\n    they might regulate the reduction of armaments all around and\r\n    eliminate many of the horrors of war through the establishment of\r\n    certain humane principles. The programme was presented by Russia on\r\n    January 11, 1899, and the conference was called on her invitation\r\n    for May 18 of that year.\r\n\r\nEvery year I offer my toast to the health of his Majesty, the Emperor\r\nof Russia, with deep feeling. To-day I add to it my heartiest good\r\nwishes for the success of the conference which owes its inception to\r\nhis Majesty's initiative.\r\n\r\nMy honored Baron, my wish includes the hope that the two tried and\r\nexperienced statesmen, his Excellency Baron de Staal and Count Münster,\r\nmay succeed in their efforts and that they may conduct the conference\r\non the old, established tradition which unites my house to that of\r\nhis Majesty and the German people to the Russian; and by doing so, in\r\naccordance with the exactly similar orders which the Emperor and I have\r\nissued, that the conference may result to the entire satisfaction of\r\nhis Majesty.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, the Emperor Nicholas! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSING OF LABORERS\r\n\r\nEARLY JUNE, 1899\r\n\r\n    Kadinen is one of the Emperor's many farming estates and is\r\n    situated in the neighborhood of Elbing, in East Prussia. It was\r\n    here that he expressed the following sentiment:\r\n\r\nMany things must be changed at Kadinen; especially the housing of the\r\nlaborers must be changed. Here in the east this seems still to be a\r\nparticular evil. The fine cattle stable in Kadinen is a veritable\r\npalace compared to the homes of the laborers. We must see to it that\r\nthe pigsties are not better than the laborers' houses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH HEROISM AT ST. PRIVAT\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE-FIELD OF ST. PRIVAT, AUGUST 18, 1899\r\n\r\n    The following noble address of the Emperor's was delivered at the\r\n    dedication of the monument to the soldiers of the 1st Regiment of\r\n    the Guard, who fell in the battle of St. Privat (August 18, 1870).\r\n    In it he speaks of the splendid heroism of the French troops who\r\n    were fighting for their Emperor. It should be remembered that the\r\n    monument was erected in the provinces which had been conquered\r\n    from France by Germany. At this time the Emperor had adopted a\r\n    conciliatory attitude toward the inhabitants of these provinces.\r\n    (See speech of March 14, 1891.) If, therefore, it may seem\r\n    ungracious, it is nevertheless merely just to call attention to\r\n    the fact that when he later (March 28, 1901) presented a painting\r\n    of the battle of St. Privat to the Alexander Regiment of the Guard\r\n    in Berlin he did not mention French heroism and speaks a different\r\n    language.\r\n\r\nSerious and solemn memories surround this day and make our hearts beat\r\nhigh. My 1st Infantry Regiment of the Guard is represented here by\r\nmy company of the Body-Guard, by its glorious flags, and by many old\r\ncomrades who once fought and bled in this place. They are to-day to\r\nunveil this monument to their fallen comrades. This ceremony will take\r\nplace in the presence of my youngest regiment,[24] and the troops of the\r\nFourteenth Army Corps, which represent the entire German army.\r\n\r\n[24] Infantry Regiment No. 145, garrisoned at Metz.\r\n\r\nIt has been almost the only regiment which up to the present has not\r\nbeen represented by a monument in this place, where so much blood was\r\nshed, and yet it had full claim to be thus commemorated. Through its\r\nhistory it is closely associated with my house, and it is called upon\r\nto train its Princes and Kings, and may therefore be properly regarded\r\nas a family and a house regiment. Nevertheless, my imperial grandfather\r\ndid not hesitate a moment to hazard these troops, which were so dear\r\nto him, for the good of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nHistory teaches us how the regiment fought and bled and respected its\r\noath to the flag and how its conduct, its sufferings, and its losses\r\nwon the praise and the tears of the great Emperor.\r\n\r\nWith me as its oldest comrade the regiment now erects this shaft to the\r\nmemory of the heroes that rest beneath the green sod. The form of the\r\nmonument differs from that which is usually found on battle-fields.\r\nThe archangel in armor, peacefully at rest, is leaning upon his sword,\r\nwhich is decorated with the proud motto of the regiment, \"_Semper\r\ntalis_.\"[25] I therefore wish that a general significance should be\r\nattached to this figure. It stands upon this bloody field as the\r\nguardian of all the brave soldiers, both the French and our own, who\r\nfell here. For bravely and heroically the French soldiers sank to their\r\nhonored graves, fighting for their Emperor and their Fatherland. And\r\nif our flags touch each other as they are lowered before the bronze\r\nmonument and sadly rustle over the graves of our dear comrades, may\r\nthey also wave over the graves of our opponents and whisper to them\r\nthat in reverent sorrow we remember the brave dead!\r\n\r\n[25] By an unfortunate error Penzler prints the motto as \"_Semper\r\n     talio_\"--\"Retaliation forever.\" The reading has been changed, as\r\n     the motto of the regiment is in reality \"_Semper talis_\"--\"Ever\r\n     the same.\"\r\n\r\nLet us look up to the Lord of Hosts and thank Him for the guidance\r\ngraciously given to our great Emperor. Let us picture to ourselves\r\nto-day that the souls of all those who once opposed each other in\r\nfierce conflict upon this field are now gathered about the throne of\r\nthe Supreme Judge and that, united in the everlasting peace of God,\r\nthey now look down upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE GREATER NAVY\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the speeches which follow will be found to bear upon the\r\nquestion of increasing the navy, and from this time forth, for various\r\nreasons, that idea will be uppermost in the Emperor's mind. His\r\nstatement that he had, from the first, strongly urged an increase in\r\nthe navy must be accepted with certain reserves. Such increases as were\r\nsuggested were slight as compared to the programmes now to be urged,\r\nand his speeches of that time give little evidence of any particular\r\ninsistence or disappointment at his failure in this regard. He really\r\nbegins to preach the need of the greater navy insistently in the last\r\nyears of the century, and his present statement, \"Bitterly do we need\r\na powerful German fleet,\" is his sharpest pronouncement up to this\r\ntime. It takes on an added significance if we remember that it was made\r\nnine days after the Boer ultimatum which began the Boer War had been\r\ndespatched. In this connection it is well to read the telegram sent to\r\nPresident Krüger, printed with the _Daily Telegraph_ interview (October\r\n28, 1908).\r\n\r\nWilliam II had in 1889 divided the admiralty and appointed a naval\r\nofficer to act as head of the organization and development of the\r\nfleet. It was only in the late nineties, however, after the appointment\r\nof Admiral Tirpitz, that this work began to go forward with leaps and\r\nbounds. That German sentiment was quick to follow the lead of the\r\nEmperor is shown by the immense enthusiasm which has made the German\r\nNavy League (organized in 1898) so great a success. In 1907 it already\r\ncounted a million paying members, and its journal, _Die Flotte_, had a\r\ncirculation of over 370,000 copies, which is about as large as that of\r\nnearly all other important German monthlies combined.[26] Shortly after\r\nthe disaster of Spion Kop Admiral Tirpitz spoke thus: \"We do not know\r\nwhat adversary we may have to face. We must therefore arm ourselves\r\nwith a view to meeting the most dangerous naval conflict possible.\"\r\nThe preamble to the German navy bill of 1900 reads: \"Germany must have\r\na fleet of such strength that a war against the mightiest power would\r\ninvolve risks threatening the supremacy of that power.\" Emperor William\r\nprotests, and there is no reason for doubting his sincerity, that this\r\npolicy of increasing the navy was not primarily directed at England. It\r\nwas necessary to protect Germany's commerce and increase her prestige.\r\nOn this point his famous interview given to the _Daily Telegraph_ is\r\ninteresting. Undoubtedly, however, this rapid increase in the navy,\r\nwhich began with the navy bill of 1900 and which happened to coincide\r\nwith the events of the Boer War, did much to heighten the ill feeling\r\nwhich had already begun to spring up between England and Germany. The\r\nidea of increasing the navy met with more general support among the\r\npeople than any other policy of the Emperor's, though it called for\r\nvery decided increases in taxation. How keen was the Emperor's personal\r\ninterest in the matter we may judge from the fact that in 1897 he sent\r\nto all the members of the Reichstag and innumerable other officials a\r\nmemorandum comparing the naval strength of Germany, France, Russia,\r\nAmerica, and Japan. The appropriation bill of that year calling for\r\n240,000,000 marks was voted with a slight reduction. The sense that the\r\nstruggle for naval supremacy with England was impending made necessary\r\nimmensely larger appropriations in the bill of 1900.\r\n\r\n[26] These are the figures given by J. Ellis Barker in \"Modern Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BITTERLY WE NEED A POWERFUL GERMAN FLEET\"\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, OCTOBER 18, 1899\r\n\r\n    The _Kaiser Karl der Grosse_ was launched in Hamburg on the 18th\r\n    of October, 1899. It will be noticed that the Emperor is always\r\n    careful to observe the anniversaries that commemorate the military\r\n    prowess, the birthdays, and the achievements of the members of his\r\n    house. The present date is again an anniversary of the battle of\r\n    Leipzig, 1813. In the evening the Emperor spoke as follows at the\r\n    banquet in the Rathaus:\r\n\r\nIt is with particular pleasure that I find myself among you again on\r\nthis historic anniversary. It always gives me new strength and vigor\r\nwhen I feel around me the dashing spray and bubbling life of one of\r\nthe cities of the Hanseatic League. It was a solemn act that we have\r\njust witnessed when we gave over to its element a new portion of the\r\nfloating defense of the Fatherland. Every one who was present must have\r\nbeen impressed with the thought that the proud ship would soon be able\r\nto take up its calling. We feel its lack, and bitterly do we need a\r\npowerful German fleet.\r\n\r\nIts name reminds us of the first glorious days of the old empire and\r\nof its mighty protector. The first beginnings of Hamburg date from\r\nthat time, even though it was merely the point of departure for the\r\nmissions in the service of the powerful Emperor. Now our Fatherland\r\nhas been newly united through Emperor William the Great and is in a\r\nposition to take up its glorious outward development. And right here\r\nin this great emporium of trade we feel the sense of power and energy\r\nwhich the German people are capable of putting into their enterprises\r\nthrough the fact that they are bound together and united. But here,\r\ntoo, we can most readily understand how necessary it is that we should\r\nhave powerful support and that we can no longer continue without\r\nincreasing our fighting strength upon the seas.\r\n\r\nBut this feeling penetrates all too slowly into the German Fatherland,\r\nwhich unfortunately wastes its strength in fruitless party strife.\r\nI have had to watch with deep concern how slow is the progress of\r\ninterest in, and political comprehension of, the great world problems\r\namong the German people.\r\n\r\nIf we look about us we can see how in the last few years the face of\r\nall the world has been changed. Old world empires are disappearing\r\nand new ones are arising. Nations have appeared among the peoples and\r\nare taking their place in the competition--nations which previously\r\nthe layman had scarcely noticed. Events which change the whole field\r\nof international relationships and the whole field of our national\r\neconomy, and which formerly were accomplished only in the course of\r\ncenturies, now take place in a few months. Through this fact the tasks\r\nof the German Empire and the German people have grown greatly in extent\r\nand demand from me and my government extraordinary and serious efforts.\r\nThey can be crowned with success only if the Germans stand behind us\r\nfirmly united and give up their party divisions. But our people must\r\nmake up their minds to make sacrifices. Above all things, it must give\r\nup the attempt to find the highest by dividing itself more and more\r\nsharply into parties. It must cease to put the party above the good of\r\nthe nation. It must put a check upon its old hereditary failing to make\r\neverything the occasion of unrestrained criticism, and it must realize\r\nthe boundaries which its own vital interests draw for it. For it is\r\nprecisely these old political sins which are now being visited upon\r\nour interests on the sea and upon our fleet. I insistently requested\r\nand warned that it must be strengthened in the first eight years of\r\nmy reign, and if these requests had not been continually refused, and\r\nrefused in ways which heaped scorn and ridicule upon me, we would have\r\nbeen able to advance our growing trade and our oversea interests far\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nBut my hopes that the German will choose the manlier way have not yet\r\ndisappeared, for in him love of the Fatherland is great and powerful.\r\nThe October fires which to-day he lights upon the hills and by which he\r\ncelebrates the noble figure of the Emperor[27] who was born on this day\r\nbear eloquent witness to this fact.\r\n\r\n[27] Frederick III.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, Emperor Frederick with his great father and his great\r\npaladins did help to build a wonderful edifice and left it to us as the\r\nGerman Empire. It stands before us in glory, as it had been yearned\r\nfor by our fathers and celebrated by our poets! Let us no longer,\r\ntherefore, as heretofore, dispute uselessly as to how the particular\r\nrooms, halls, and apartments of this building are to look or how they\r\nare to be furnished; but may the people, burning like these October\r\nfires with an ideal enthusiasm, strive to follow its ideal second\r\nEmperor, and above all things let it rejoice in the beautiful edifice\r\nand help to protect it. Let it be proud of its greatness. Let it be\r\nconscious of its inner worth. Let it watch every foreign state in\r\nits development. Let it make the sacrifices which our position as a\r\nworld-power demands. Let it give up the spirit of party and stand\r\nunited and firm behind its princes and its Emperor--then only will the\r\nGerman people help the Hanseatic cities in carrying out their great\r\nwork for the benefit of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThat is my wish to-day, and to it and the health of Hamburg I raise my\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW CENTURY\r\n\r\nBERLIN, JANUARY 1, 1900\r\n\r\n    The military New Year's celebration took place near the armory, and\r\n    the standards of the entire Berlin garrison were for this purpose\r\n    brought from the Royal Palace. The Empress and her younger children\r\n    watched the celebration from the windows of the armory.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the new century sees our army, that is our people\r\nunder arms, gathered about its standards and kneeling before the Lord\r\nof Hosts. And, indeed, if any one has particular cause for bowing down\r\nto-day before God it is our army.\r\n\r\nA glance at our flags will explain the reason, for they embody our\r\nhistory. At the beginning of the last century what was the position of\r\nour army? The glorious army of Frederick the Great had become ossified\r\nand was interested only in petty and insignificant details; it was led\r\nby generals feeble with age and no longer capable of conducting active\r\ncampaigns; its corps of officers had lost the habit of invigorating\r\nlabor; through a life of luxury and comfort and foolish exaltation of\r\nself it had fallen asleep upon its laurels. In one word, the army was\r\nnot only no longer capable of carrying out its task, but had forgotten\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of Heaven was grievous, for it was suddenly visited\r\nupon our entire people. Cast down into the dust, Frederick's glory\r\nvanished, and the army's standards were broken. In the seven long years\r\nof grievous slavery God taught our people to take thought, and under\r\nthe pressure of the foot of an insolent conqueror developed the idea of\r\nuniversal military service, the idea that the greatest honor lies in\r\ndedicating our services in arms and in sacrificing our blood and our\r\npossessions for the Fatherland. My great-grandfather gave the idea form\r\nand life, and new laurels crowned the newly established army and her\r\nrecent flags.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of universal military service reached its full\r\nsignificance only under our great departed Emperor. In spite of\r\nopposition and lack of comprehension he quietly went to work at the\r\nreorganization, and at the re-establishment of our army. Victorious\r\ncampaigns, nevertheless, gave his work an altogether unexpected\r\nsanction. His spirit filled the ranks of his army, even as his trust\r\nin God carried them on to unheard-of victories. With this, his own\r\ncreation, he brought the Germanic peoples together again and gave us\r\nthe German unity for which we had prayed. We owe it to him that, thanks\r\nto this honor, the German Empire commands respect again and takes up\r\nits appointed place in the council of the nations.\r\n\r\nIt is for you, gentlemen, to cherish and exemplify in the new century\r\nthe old qualities through which our forefathers gave greatness to the\r\narmy. This means that you must make few demands in daily life,[28] that\r\nyou must practise simplicity and give yourselves up unconditionally\r\nto the royal service, that you must in ceaseless labor offer all the\r\npowers of body and soul to the building up and development of our\r\ntroops, and, just as my grandfather labored for his land forces,\r\nso, undeterred, I shall carry through to its completion the work of\r\nreorganizing my navy in order that it may stand justified at the side\r\nof my army and that through it the German Empire may also be in a\r\nposition to win outwardly the place which she has not yet attained.\r\n\r\n[28] \"To the Americans the pay of the German troops, officers and men,\r\n     is ludicrously small. It is evident that men do not undertake\r\n     to fit themselves to be officers, and do not struggle through\r\n     frequent and severe examinations to remain officers, for the pay\r\n     they receive. A lieutenant receives for the first three years $300\r\n     a year, from the fourth to the sixth year $425, from the seventh\r\n     to the ninth year $550, and after the twelfth year $600 a year.\r\n     A captain receives from the first to the fourth year $850, from\r\n     the fifth to the eighth year $1,150, and the ninth year and after\r\n     $1,275 a year. Of one hundred officers who join, only an average\r\n     of eight ever attain to the command of a regiment. In Bavaria and\r\n     Würtemberg promotion is quicker by from one to three years than\r\n     in Prussia. In Prussia promotion to _Oberleutnant_ averages 10\r\n     years, to captain or _Rittmeister_ 15 years, to major 25 years,\r\n     to colonel 33 years, and to general 37 years. It would not be\r\n     altogether inhuman if these gentlemen occasionally drank a toast\r\n     to war and pestilence.\"--PRICE COLLIER, \"Germany and the Germans.\"\r\n\r\nWhen both are united I hope to be in a position, firmly trusting in the\r\nleadership of God, to carry into effect the saying of Frederick William\r\nI: \"If one wishes to decide anything in the world, it cannot be done\r\nwith the pen unless the pen is supported by the force of the sword.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BOUNDARY POSTS\r\n\r\nBERLIN, FEBRUARY 13, 1900\r\n\r\n    On the occasion of the return of Prince Henry from the Orient,\r\n    whither he had been sent at the time of the troubles in Kiaochow,\r\n    the Emperor greeted him at a dinner held in the Royal Palace in\r\n    Berlin. The question of the imperial foreign policy, as during all\r\n    this period, is evidently here uppermost in the Emperor's mind.\r\n\r\nYOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, MY DEAR BROTHER:\r\n\r\nI bid you a hearty welcome to our Fatherland and our capital! Two years\r\nago I sent you forth to carry out your task in the far East, and could\r\nonly hope that God would give you His protection and bring the work to\r\na successful issue. The joyous and enthusiastic reception which all\r\nclasses in my home city, Berlin, give you is a testimony to the loving\r\ninterest which our entire people have in the completion of the task\r\nwhich you had set yourself.\r\n\r\nBut this reception has a still deeper significance. It is an\r\nunambiguous indication which proves how deeply the people have come to\r\nunderstand the need of strengthening our sea power. The German people\r\nis of one mind with its princes and its Emperor in the feeling that in\r\nits powerful development it must set up a new boundary post and create\r\na great fleet which will correspond to its needs.\r\n\r\nJust as Emperor William the Great created the weapon by whose help we\r\nbecame again black, white, and red, so the German people is now lending\r\nits efforts to forging the weapon through which, God willing and in all\r\neternity, both here and in foreign countries, it will remain black,\r\nwhite, and red.\r\n\r\nOn your return you find a little lad[29] in the arms of your faithful\r\nwife. As sponsor for the growth of our young fleet may you see him grow\r\nup to full maturity under the protection of God! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n[29] Prince Henry, born January 9, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEAPORTS AND CANNON\r\n\r\nLÜBECK, JUNE 16, 1900\r\n\r\n    The opening of the Elbe-Trave Canal took place at Lübeck in the\r\n    presence of the Emperor. He again took up the question of the\r\n    development of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nOn this day I congratulate the city of Lübeck most heartily. First\r\nof all I offer my heartiest thanks for the wonderful reception which\r\nyou prepared for me. I have seen in the attitude and the faces of the\r\ncitizens how joyously their hearts are moved to-day; for they know\r\nthat I, too, take a lively interest in all that now moves them. May\r\nthe canal which they have carried through with their irresistible\r\nHanseatic activity not fall short in any way of their expectations, and\r\nI am convinced that it will not do so. You see, as you look upon the\r\ncompleted work, how significant it is that a united German Empire now\r\nexists. Its past glories Lübeck owed to the German Emperors, and its\r\npresent glory it owes to the German Empire, so I hope that everywhere\r\nin the empire and among the people the conviction may grow that through\r\nthe re-establishment and strengthening of the German Empire we are\r\nnow called upon to carry through those old tasks which could not be\r\naccomplished formerly and which were rendered impossible through the\r\nunfortunate lack of union of our ancestors.\r\n\r\nI hope that in the future, under my protection, Lübeck may continue to\r\ndevelop. I could not express this hope with the same satisfaction if\r\nI did not now stand before you joyously buoyed up by the hope that we\r\nto-day have the prospect of at last possessing a German fleet.\r\n\r\nAn Emperor can only undertake to protect a seaport when he is in a\r\nposition with his cannon to protect her flag, even in the farthermost\r\ncorners of the world, whether it be that of Lübeck, or of Hamburg, or\r\nof Bremen, or of Prussia.\r\n\r\nMay it be granted us to maintain peace outwardly through our fleet,\r\nand may we succeed through the building of the necessary canals within\r\nto simplify the problem of transportation! A blessing will certainly\r\nalways rest upon our waterways.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OCEAN KNOCKS AT OUR DOOR\r\n\r\nKIEL, JULY 3, 1900\r\n\r\n    The ship of the line \"Wittelsbach\" was launched on this day. As\r\n    the house of Wittelsbach is the reigning house of Bavaria, Prince\r\n    Rupprecht of Bavaria was present at the christening and gave the\r\n    boat its name. A banquet took place in the evening at the officers'\r\n    casino. The Emperor replied to Prince Rupprecht as follows:\r\n\r\nI thank your Royal Highness for the friendly words which you have been\r\ngood enough to address to me.\r\n\r\nAt the christening of this new ship your Royal Highness has mentioned\r\nthe support which the house of Wittelsbach has given to the German\r\nEmperors. I would like to call attention in this connection to an\r\nepisode in the early history of our houses.\r\n\r\nOn the fields before Rome it was granted to one of the ancestors\r\nof your Royal Highness in company with one of mine to be made the\r\nrecipient of a very unusual distinction. Mounted upon their horses\r\nand clad in armor, in sight of the hostile squadron of knights,\r\nthey received the accolade from Emperor Henry VII. The incident is\r\nimmortalized in a picture upon my yacht _Hohenzollern_.\r\n\r\nThe descendants of those princes gave each other assistance at\r\nMühldorf,[30] where the Hohenzoller won the battle for Emperor Ludwig\r\nof Bavaria. Just as at that time the houses of Wittelsbach and of\r\nHohenzollern fought side by side for the good of the empire, so now,\r\ntoo, and in the future they will work together.\r\n\r\n[30] Battle fought in 1322 between two competitors for the empire,\r\n     Louis V and Frederick the Fair.\r\n\r\nYour Royal Highness has had the opportunity to be present during these\r\ndays when we came to weighty conclusions and to be the witness of\r\nhistorical moments which mark a new point in the history of our people.\r\nYour Royal Highness has been able to convince himself how powerfully\r\nthe wave beat of the ocean knocks at the door of our people and forces\r\nit to demand its place in the world as a great nation; drives it on, in\r\nshort, to world politics.\r\n\r\nGermany's greatness makes it impossible for her to do without the\r\nocean--but the ocean also proves that even in the distance, and on its\r\nfarther side, without Germany and the German Emperor no great decision\r\ndare henceforth be taken.[31]\r\n\r\n[31] See the introduction to chapter IV, \"The Beginning of World\r\n     Politics.\"\r\n\r\nI do not believe that thirty years ago our German people, under the\r\nleadership of their princes, bled and conquered in order that they\r\nmight be shoved aside when great decisions are to be made in foreign\r\npolitics. If that could happen the idea that the German people are to\r\nbe considered as a world-power would be dead and done for, and it is\r\nnot my will that this should happen. To this end it is only my duty\r\nand my finest privilege to use the proper and, if need be, the most\r\ndrastic means without fear of consequences. I am convinced that in this\r\ncourse I have the German princes and the German people firmly behind me.\r\n\r\nIt is of great significance that precisely at this time, when Bavarians\r\nand Würtembergers, Saxons and Prussians are going into the far East in\r\norder to re-establish the honor of the German flag, your Royal Highness\r\nshould have accepted the honor of the _à la suite_ position to the\r\nnaval battalion. Just as the house of Wittelsbach took up arms in 1870\r\nto fight for Germany's honor, for her union, and her imperial dignity,\r\nso I hope that the empire may always be assured of the support of this\r\nnoble race.\r\n\r\nAs a representative of this noble house I greet your Royal Highness\r\nwith the wish that the close connection which the _à la suite_ position\r\nto my navy now gives you will always maintain your Royal Highness's\r\ninterest for our fleet.\r\n\r\nI drink to the health of his Royal Highness, Prince Rupprecht of\r\nBavaria. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN THE WAY FOR CULTURE\r\n\r\nBREMEN, JULY 27, 1900\r\n\r\n    Events in China touched upon in the speech delivered on December\r\n    15, 1897, had finally brought about the Pekin crisis. Baron von\r\n    Ketteler, the German Minister, had been shot down in the streets on\r\n    June 20.\r\n\r\n    The following is one of five speeches which the Emperor delivered\r\n    on the occasion of the departure of the German troops for China.\r\n    This particular one was delivered to the troops at Bremen in the\r\n    presence of the Empress, Princes Eitel Friedrich and Adelbert,\r\n    Chancellor Hohenlohe, Secretary of State von Bülow, Minister\r\n    of War von Gossler, and Lieutenant-General von Bessel. Various\r\n    versions of this speech exist and in many of them the harshness of\r\n    the Emperor's expression has been toned down. We give first the\r\n    version which was printed in the _Reichsanzeiger_, the official\r\n    journal, and which seems to have been somewhat edited. In order\r\n    that the reader may realize more fully the impression conveyed by\r\n    the Emperor's farewell address to his troops, we print under it\r\n    the account which a volunteer of the 1st East Asiatic Regiment of\r\n    infantry sent home to his family.\r\n\r\nGreat tasks oversea have fallen to the lot of the newly arisen German\r\nEmpire, tasks far greater than many of my countrymen have expected. The\r\ncharacter of the German Empire makes it a duty for it to protect its\r\ncitizens no matter how far they may have penetrated into foreign lands.\r\nThe new German Empire is in a position to discharge the task which\r\nthe old Roman Empire of the German Nation could not discharge. The\r\ninstrument which makes this possible for us is our army.\r\n\r\nIn thirty years of faithful and peaceful labor it has been developed\r\naccording to the principles of my late grandfather. You too have\r\nreceived your training according to these principles, and are now\r\ncalled upon to give proof before the enemy whether or not you have\r\nobserved them well. Your comrades of the navy have undergone this\r\ntrial; they have shown you that the principles of our training are\r\ngood, and I am proud of the praise which has come from the mouths of\r\nforeign leaders, in recognition of the service which your comrades out\r\nthere have given. It is now for you to do likewise.\r\n\r\nA great task is waiting for you. You are to right the grievous wrong\r\nwhich has been done. The Chinese have overthrown the law of nations;\r\nin a way which has never been heard of in the history of the world,\r\nthey have scorned the duties of hospitality and the sanctity of the\r\nAmbassador. This is the more revolutionary, as this crime was committed\r\nby a nation which is proud of its very ancient culture. Preserve the\r\nold Prussian thoroughness; show yourselves as Christians in joyfully\r\nbearing your trials; may honor and glory follow your flags and weapons!\r\nGive the world an example of manliness and discipline.\r\n\r\nYou know very well that you are to fight against a cunning, brave,\r\nwell-armed, and terrible enemy. If you come to grips with him, be\r\nassured quarter will not be given, no prisoners will be taken. Use your\r\nweapons in such a way that for a thousand years no Chinese shall dare\r\nto look upon a German askance. Show your manliness.\r\n\r\nThe blessing of God be with you! The prayers of an entire people and my\r\nwishes accompany you, every one. Open the way for culture once for all!\r\n\r\nAnd now take up your journey! Adieu, comrades!\r\n\r\n    We here subjoin the account of this speech as given in the letter\r\n    of a volunteer in the 1st East Asiatic Regiment of infantry:\r\n\r\nAfter the Emperor had gone down the front and had greeted separately\r\nevery battalion, every division or squadron, he pictured the present\r\nsituation in eloquent words and called attention to the fact that no\r\ncrime which so cried to Heaven had been recorded in the history of the\r\nworld, but he also set in their proper light the difficulties of the\r\ntask which we had set for ourselves and emphasized the fact that we\r\nhad before us an opponent equal in equipment and fame but ten times\r\nsuperior in numbers. But, and his words ran about as follows, \"you will\r\nand must defeat him with the help of God and, indeed, in such a way\r\nthat the Chinese in thousands of years will not presume to raise his\r\nhand against a German\"; and his voice became deeply moved and powerful\r\nas he spoke the following words: \"On the strength of the oath to the\r\nflag which you have sworn to me I demand that you give no pardon, that\r\nno prisoners be taken, for you shall be the avengers of the abomination\r\nwhich has been committed in this present time.\" Then followed certain\r\nwords of farewell, and the speech of the Emperor which for me and for\r\nmany others will be unforgettably closed with the phrase, \"Adieu,\r\ncomrades.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE EMPEROR IN 1900]\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIS ROMANUS SUM\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL LIMES MUSEUM, SAALBURG, OCTOBER 11, 1900\r\n\r\n    _Limes_ was the Latin name for the boundary wall extending for\r\n    about 300 miles from the Rhine to the Danube and separating the\r\n    Roman Empire from the free Germanic peoples. At Saalburg, in the\r\n    Taunus Mountains, there stood on the _Limes_ an old Roman citadel\r\n    which was excavated and restored. The Romanized ceremony at the\r\n    laying of the corner-stone of the Imperial Limes Museum struck\r\n    certain German critics as somewhat theatrical. The guards had been\r\n    drilled to clash their swords on their shields after the manner of\r\n    the Pretorian guards, the rector of the school offered his homage\r\n    in Latin verses, and boys whose hair had been dressed in Roman\r\n    fashion swung their censers. The Emperor's historical references\r\n    here about the relation of Germany to Rome are somewhat one-sided.\r\n    It may be recalled, in connection with the Emperor's remarks about\r\n    Augustus and his salutary influence on Germany, that in the Forest\r\n    of Teutoburg there is a great monument to commemorate the fact that\r\n    the united German tribes, struggling victoriously against this\r\n    \"Roman culture which fell so fruitfully upon Germany especially,\"\r\n    there annihilated the forces of the general of Augustus, Quintilius\r\n    Varus.\r\n\r\nMy first thought to-day goes back in solemn gratitude to my father of\r\neverlasting memory, Emperor Frederick III. It is to his creative will\r\nand to his activity that Saalburg owes its restoration.\r\n\r\nJust as in the far east of the monarchy at his bidding the powerful\r\nstronghold, which once had implanted German culture into the east,\r\nrearose and is now nearing completion, so, too, here in the beautiful\r\nTaunus Mountains the old Roman citadel has arisen again like a phoenix\r\nfrom its ashes. It is a testimony to the Roman power, a link in the\r\ngreat chain which the legions of Rome built about the powerful empire\r\nwhich, at the bidding of the Roman Emperor Cæsar Augustus alone, forced\r\nits way upon the world and opened the whole world to that Roman\r\nculture which fell so fruitfully upon Germany especially.\r\n\r\nWith the first blow of my hammer I therefore dedicate this stone to\r\nthe memory of Emperor Frederick III; with the second I dedicate it to\r\nGerman youth, to the generations now growing up who may learn here\r\nin this restored museum what a world-empire means; with the third\r\nI dedicate it to our German Fatherland, to which I hope it will be\r\ngranted, through the harmonious co-operation of princes and peoples, of\r\nits armies and its citizens, to become in the future as closely united,\r\nas powerful, and as authoritative as once the Roman world-empire was,\r\nand that, just as in old times they said, \"_Civis romanus sum_,\"\r\nhereafter, at some time in the future, they will say: \"I am a German\r\ncitizen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCABINET ORDER TO THE PRUSSIAN ARMY\r\n\r\nJANUARY, 1901\r\n\r\n    The relationship of the army to the Prussian Kings here referred to\r\n    is treated in chapter I.\r\n\r\nTO MY ARMY:\r\n\r\nTo-day, at the celebration which commemorates the two-hundredth\r\nanniversary of our taking over of the royal power of Prussia, my\r\nthoughts are directed first of all to my army. In Prussia the King and\r\nthe army belong indissolubly together. This close personal relationship\r\nbetween me and every single one of my officers and soldiers rests upon\r\na tradition that dates back 200 years. The spirit which from the time\r\nof Frederick the Great has been fostered in the army by all the Kings,\r\nthe spirit of honor, of fidelity to duty, of obedience, of courage,\r\nof chivalry has made the army what it is and what it ought to be, the\r\nsharp, reliable weapon in the hand of her Kings for the protection and\r\nthe blessing of the Fatherland's greatness.\r\n\r\nTo serve the Fatherland at the head of the army, that is my will and\r\nthat also was the foremost wish of all my predecessors. It is to their\r\ncare that the army owes its power and the consideration which it\r\nenjoys. For 200 years she has proven true the sentence of the great\r\nKing: \"The world does not rest upon the shoulders of Atlas any more\r\nsecurely than the Prussian state upon the shoulders of the army!\" It\r\nhas sealed with its blood its love and gratitude for its Kings!\r\n\r\nFor all this I thank the army deeply. I thank it for the devotion which\r\nit has unselfishly shown me and my house year in and year out, in its\r\nunceasing service for the Fatherland. So long as this spirit binds the\r\narmy to its Kings, so long we need fear no storms; and Prussia's eagle\r\nwill proudly pursue its lofty and undeflected flight for the good of\r\nPrussia, for the good of Germany! May God grant us this!\r\n\r\n                                                      WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\n  BERLIN ROYAL PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION OF THE BARRACKS OF THE ALEXANDER REGIMENT\r\n\r\nMARCH 28, 1901\r\n\r\n    On the 6th of March the Emperor had been struck in the face by a\r\n    piece of iron hurled at him by an irresponsible youth, Weiland, in\r\n    the streets of Bremen. It was doubtless this incident coupled with\r\n    the increasing strength of the Social Democrats that made him think\r\n    of the possibility of an uprising and deliver the following address\r\n    to the population of Berlin. The Social Democrats and many others\r\n    resented his suggesting the possibility of turning the troops\r\n    upon the citizens. We give first Penzler's more or less official\r\n    account of the speech as it appeared in the _Kreuzzeitung_. If the\r\n    extract which we quote from Doctor Liman's work \"Der Kaiser\" may be\r\n    considered at all authentic, the speech seems to have been somewhat\r\n    edited before publication.\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER REGIMENT:\r\n\r\nTo-day a new period in your history begins. May the spirit of the\r\nmemories which you leave behind you in the old barracks live on in\r\nyour new home. They are memories of beautiful days of peace and of\r\nfierce days of conflict. Like a firm bulwark, your new barracks stand\r\nin the neighborhood of the palace, which it is primarily your duty to\r\nbe ever ready to defend. The Emperor Alexander Regiment is called upon\r\nin a sense to stand ready as body-guard by night and by day and, if\r\nnecessary, to risk its life and its blood for the King and his house;\r\nand if ever again (the Emperor here called to mind the faithful bearing\r\nof the Alexander Regiment at the time of the revolts against the King\r\nin 1848) a time like this should reappear in this city, a time of\r\nuprising against the King, then I am convinced the Alexander Regiment\r\nwill be able energetically to force back into bounds any impertinence\r\nand rebelliousness against its royal master.[32]\r\n\r\n[32] This last sentence reads as follows in Doctor Liman's work:\r\n     \"But if the city should ever again presume to rise up against\r\n     its master then will the regiment repress with the bayonet the\r\n     impertinence of the people toward their King.\" Doctor Liman states\r\n     that it was currently reported that this sentiment had been\r\n     expressed in phrases which were even more objectionable to the\r\n     citizens who were standing outside the circle of soldiers.\r\n\r\nI hope that a brilliant and beautiful existence may be in store for\r\nthe regiment in its new home, and that such an existence will be\r\nreserved for it in the future. May it cherish above all things its\r\nmemories of its earlier leaders and its enduring relationships to\r\nthem. These memories can only be fostered through courage, fidelity,\r\nand unconditional obedience. And if this old spirit lives on in the\r\nregiment then must its acts always win for it the satisfaction of its\r\nroyal master.\r\n\r\n    (After the banquet in the officers' mess the Emperor turned over to\r\n    them a large painting of the Alexander Regiment on the evening of\r\n    the battle of St. Privat. The official report gives the Emperor's\r\n    speech partly in his own words and partly in summary.)\r\n\r\nHe was convinced that the officers had brought the old spirit into\r\ntheir new quarters, and that they would continue to foster it. He, too,\r\non his side, wished to contribute something to the decoration of their\r\nnew home, and to this end had chosen an episode out of the victorious\r\nhistory of the regiment, and in doing so he wished to carry out a wish\r\nof the officers.\r\n\r\n\"In most of the pictures based upon the martial history of Prussia the\r\nPrussian troops are represented in victorious advance when, under their\r\npowerful shock, they are overthrowing the enemy. I thought it fitting\r\nfor once to have the Prussian toughness and endurance on the defensive\r\nrepresented in the battle of a smaller body against an overwhelmingly\r\nsuperior force. The picture represents how a small number from the\r\nAlexander Regiment defended themselves with heroic spirit against an\r\nentire brigade and finally victoriously repulsed it. My grandfather\r\nexpressed to the body-guard as a whole his gratitude for its brave\r\nconduct in the face of the enemy and for all its heroic deeds. I am\r\nfirmly convinced that the officers of the Alexander Regiment will\r\nalways be mindful of its task, seeing that it educates soldiers for\r\nthe one moment when it is a question of sealing with their life-blood\r\ntheir fidelity toward King and Fatherland. This consciousness gives\r\nme the certainty that we shall conquer everywhere, even though we be\r\nsurrounded by enemies on all sides; for there lives a powerful ally,\r\nthe old, good God[33] in heaven, who, ever since the time of the Great\r\nElector and of the great King, has always been on our side.\"\r\n\r\n[33] _Der alte, gute Gott._\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE STUDENTS AT BONN\r\n\r\nAPRIL 24, 1901\r\n\r\n    Emperor William had himself been a student at Bonn. On this day the\r\n    Crown Prince was matriculated at that university and in the evening\r\n    the students held a _Festkommers_, a kind of banquet of the student\r\n    societies, at which the Emperor appeared with the Crown Prince\r\n    and his brother-inlay, Prince Adolph von Schaumburg-Lippe. After\r\n    singing two student songs, the student leader of the _Kommers_,\r\n    \"Studiosus\" von Alvensleben, greeted the Emperor with a speech\r\n    of welcome. In this friendly gathering the Emperor took occasion\r\n    to discuss the history of the empire and especially the reasons\r\n    for the failure of the older empire because of its cosmopolitan\r\n    character. The new empire must be based upon a recognition of the\r\n    characteristic German traits and will be possible only through the\r\n    whole-hearted support of the constituent states of the realm.\r\n\r\nI do not need to emphasize or even to mention to you, my dear young\r\ncomrades, what emotions thrill my heart at finding myself again among\r\nstudents in beautiful Bonn. There unrolls before my mind's eye the\r\nglimmering picture of sunshine and happy contentment with which the\r\nperiod of my own sojourn here was filled. It was the joy of living, joy\r\nin people old and young, and, above all things, joy in the development\r\nof the young German Empire!\r\n\r\nIt is therefore my wish at this moment, when I place my dear son among\r\nyou, that he, too, may have as happy a time as a student as was once\r\nvouchsafed to me. And, indeed, how could it be otherwise? For Bonn,\r\nthe lovely city, is so accustomed to the presence of young men full of\r\nlife and seems by nature to have been designed to no other end. Here\r\nthe Crown Prince will find memories of his glorious grandfather who\r\ncould not forget Bonn--his kindly eyes brightened whenever the name of\r\nthe city which had become so dear to him was mentioned--memories of\r\nhis great-grandfather, the noble prince consort, the companion of that\r\nnow sanctified royal lady,[34] who always strove to maintain a peaceful\r\nand friendly relationship between her people and ours, which are both\r\nof German stock--memories of many another noble German prince who here\r\nprepared himself for his later career.\r\n\r\n[34] Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nBut even more than that--Bonn is situated on the Rhine; it is here\r\nthat our grapes are gathered; our legends cluster about it, and every\r\ncastle, every city, speaks to us of our past. The magic of Father Rhine\r\nwill certainly exercise its power upon the Crown Prince likewise. And\r\nwhen you joyfully pass the cup and sing a new song, then I hope that\r\nyour spirits may rise and enjoy the beautiful moments as becomes happy\r\nGerman youths! But may the source from which you draw your joys be as\r\nclear and pure as the golden juice of the grape, may it be deep and\r\nconstant as Father Rhine! If we look about us in the joyous Rhineland,\r\nour history rises up before us in very palpable form. You may well\r\nrejoice that you are young Germans, as you travel through the stretch\r\nfrom Aix to Mainz, that is, from Charlemagne to the time of Germany's\r\nsplendor under Barbarossa.\r\n\r\nBut why did all this glory come to naught? Why did the German Empire\r\ndwindle away? Because the old empire was not founded upon a strictly\r\nnational basis. The universality idea of the old Roman Empire of the\r\nGerman Nation did not admit of any development in the spirit of German\r\nnationality. The life of a nation depends upon its frontiers, upon\r\nthe personality of its people, and upon its racial traits. And so the\r\nglory of Barbarossa had to fail, and the old imperial structure had to\r\nfall, because through its idea of universality it hindered the process\r\nof crystallization which might have made it a rounded and completed\r\nnation; for the smaller units crystallized into the form of powerful\r\nprincipalities and laid the foundation for new states. But through\r\nthis process their rulers unfortunately came into conflict with the\r\nempire and the Emperor, who dreamed of universal dominion, and internal\r\npeace was lost to the ever weakening empire. Unfortunately, at the\r\nhead of this chapter in the development of our German people we must\r\nwrite the telling words of Tacitus, that great student of Germany:\r\n\"_Propter invidiam_.\" The princes were envious of the power of the\r\nEmperors, just as once they were envious of the power of Arminius in\r\nspite of his victory. The nobility was envious of the cities which had\r\nbecome wealthy, and the peasant was envious of the noble. What unhappy\r\nconsequences and what grievous woes our dear and beautiful Germany had\r\nto suffer \"_propter invidiam_\"! The shores of Father Rhine can tell you\r\nlong stories about this. But finally God allowed one to accomplish what\r\nbefore had been impossible. Aix and Mainz are for us historic memories;\r\nthe longing to be brought together into a single nation remained in\r\nthe German breast, and Emperor William the Great, in union with his\r\nfaithful servants, achieved it. So cast your eyes from Coblentz to the\r\nGerman Eck and from Rüdesheim to the Niederwald! The pictures teach and\r\nprove to you that you are now Germans in a German land, citizens of a\r\ndefinitely bounded German nation. You are here to prepare yourselves to\r\ncontribute to her future welfare and development. In its proud flower\r\nthe empire stands before you. May you be filled with joy and grateful\r\nhappiness, and may you be thrilled with the firm and manly resolve, as\r\nGermans, to give your service to Germany, to support, strengthen, and\r\nelevate her! The future waits for you and will need your strength;\r\nit does not expect that you will waste it in idle cosmopolitan dreams\r\nor enlist it in the service of selfish party tendencies, but that you\r\nwill devote it to strengthening the national idea and our own ideals.\r\nPowerful, indeed, are the intellectual heroes which the Germanic stock,\r\nthrough the grace of God, has produced, from the time of Boniface\r\nand Walter von der Vogelweide to Goethe and Schiller; and they have\r\nbecome a light and blessing to all humanity. Their influence was\r\nexerted universally, and yet they were strictly Germans, set apart by\r\nthemselves; that is, personalities, men. We need them to-day more than\r\never. May you strive to become such as they were!\r\n\r\nBut how is this to be possible, and who is to help you? Only one, our\r\nLord and Saviour, whose name we all bear and who has borne our sins and\r\nredeemed us, has provided us with an example, and labored as we are to\r\nlabor. He has implanted moral earnestness in you so that the springs of\r\nyour activity may remain pure and that your aims may be lofty! The love\r\nof father and mother, of the ancestral home and Fatherland, is rooted\r\nin the love for Him. Then will you be provided with a charm against\r\ntemptations of every sort, above all against pride and envy, and you\r\ncan sing and say: \"We Germans fear God, nothing else in this world.\"\r\nThen will we stand firm and spread culture through the world, and I\r\nshall close my eyes in peace if I see such generations growing up and\r\ngathered about my son. Then \"_Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles!_\"\r\nWith this prospect in mind I call out: Long live the University of Bonn!\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLACE IN THE SUN\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, JUNE 18, 1901\r\n\r\n    From his childhood the Emperor has been fond of the sea. Most\r\n    of his vacations have been taken aboard his famous yacht\r\n    _Hohenzollern_, and almost every year he has been an enthusiastic\r\n    spectator, and occasionally participant, in the regattas on the\r\n    Elbe. On this occasion the steam-yacht _Prinzessin Victoria\r\n    Luise_ was placed at his disposition by the directors of the\r\n    Hamburg-American Line. He is using his famous phrase, \"a place in\r\n    the sun\" with reference to the happy outcome of events in China,\r\n    for on May 27 of this year China had finally accepted the terms\r\n    of the powers. Of the 90,000 men sent by the powers, Germany had\r\n    furnished 22,000, and the general direction of the expedition had\r\n    been intrusted to the German general Von Waldersee. Ballin, of the\r\n    Hamburg-American Line, had acquired 3,000 feet of water-front and\r\n    had leased for twenty-five years most of the landings of a Chinese\r\n    navigation company. The Emperor's speech was delivered in reply to\r\n    one by Burgomaster Mönckeberg of Hamburg.\r\n\r\nI offer my heartiest thanks for the eloquent address of your\r\nMagnificence. I express to you and all comrades on the water the\r\npleasure which I feel that I should once more be allowed to appear\r\namong you and take part in the races of the North German Regatta\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nHis Magnificence, in his short and pregnant speech, gave us as good and\r\nbeautiful a picture as possible of the development of our Fatherland\r\nduring recent years in the field of water sports and of our relations\r\nto foreign countries. It will be my sole task for the future to see\r\nto it that the seeds which have been sown may develop in peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that we have no such fleet as we should have, we\r\nhave conquered for ourselves a place in the sun. It will now be my task\r\nto see to it that this place in the sun shall remain our undisputed\r\npossession, in order that the sun's rays may fall fruitfully upon our\r\nactivity and trade in foreign parts, that our industry and agriculture\r\nmay develop within the state and our sailing sports upon the water,\r\nfor our future lies upon the water. The more Germans go out upon the\r\nwaters, whether it be in the races of regattas, whether it be in\r\njourneys across the ocean, or in the service of the battle-flag, so\r\nmuch the better will it be for us. For when the German has once learned\r\nto direct his glance upon what is distant and great, the pettiness\r\nwhich surrounds him in daily life on all sides will disappear. Whoever\r\nwishes to have this larger and freer outlook can find no better place\r\nthan one of the Hanseatic cities. What we have learned out of the\r\nprevious history of our development amounts really to what I already\r\npointed out when I sent my brother to the East Asiatic station (Dec.\r\n15, 1897). We have merely drawn the logical conclusions from the\r\nwork which was left us by Emperor William the Great, my memorable\r\ngrandfather, and the great man whose monument we have recently\r\nunveiled.[35] These consequences lie in the fact that we are now making\r\nour efforts to do what, in the old time, the Hanseatic cities could\r\nnot accomplish, because they lacked the vivifying and protecting power\r\nof the empire. May it be the function of my Hansa during many years of\r\npeace to protect and advance commerce and trade!\r\n\r\n[35] Bismarck.\r\n\r\nIn the events which have taken place in China I see the indication that\r\nEuropean peace is assured for many years to come; for the achievements\r\nof the particular contingents have brought about a mutual respect and\r\nfeeling of comradeship that can only serve the furtherance of peace.\r\nBut in this period of peace I hope that our Hanseatic cities will\r\nflourish. Our new Hansa will open new paths and create and conquer new\r\nmarkets for them.\r\n\r\nAs head of the empire I therefore rejoice over every citizen, whether\r\nfrom Hamburg, Bremen, or Lübeck, who goes forth with this large outlook\r\nand seeks new points where we can drive in the nail on which to hang\r\nour armor. Therefore, I believe that I express the feeling of all your\r\nhearts when I recognize gratefully that the director of this company\r\nwho has placed at our disposal the wonderful ship which bears my\r\ndaughter's name has gone forth as a courageous servant of the Hansa, in\r\norder to make for us friendly conquests whose fruits will be gathered\r\nby our descendants.\r\n\r\nIn the joyful hope that this enterprising Hanseatic spirit may be\r\nspread even further, I raise my glass and ask all of those who are my\r\ncomrades upon the water to join with me in a cheer for sailing and the\r\nHanseatic spirit!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ELECTOR\r\n\r\nKIEL, JUNE 20, 1901\r\n\r\n    Because of his activity in founding the Brandenburg fleet, a\r\n    monument was erected to the Great Elector at Kiel. His history has\r\n    been touched upon in chapter I. In connection with the services\r\n    of the Dutch admirals it is interesting to note that one of the\r\n    Emperor's heroes was the God-fearing Dutch admiral De Ruyter,\r\n    who always offered prayers before battle. The Emperor once laid\r\n    a wreath upon his grave, and to-day on board the battle-ships\r\n    the Dutch prayer before going into action is often read by the\r\n    chaplains of the navy.\r\n\r\n    What extraordinary progress has been made in naval matters\r\n    under the Emperor we may judge when we remember that before the\r\n    Franco-Prussian War there were in Germany no construction bureaus\r\n    and no wharves in which cruisers could be built. The first armored\r\n    cruisers, _König Wilhelm_, _Kronprinz_, _Friedrich Karl_, were\r\n    bought from England and France. In thirty years Germany has here\r\n    achieved not only complete independence but something approaching\r\n    very nearly to supremacy. His service in this field has been\r\n    generally recognized. A German critic not usually favorable to the\r\n    Emperor speaks thus: \"Perhaps nowhere in the development of our\r\n    political life does the personal activity of the Emperor stand out\r\n    so strongly as in the building up of the German fleet. From the\r\n    beginning he has displayed so much energy and perseverance, in\r\n    this respect, and has so emphatically carried his will into effect\r\n    that history will certainly credit him with a great and unique\r\n    service.\"\r\n\r\n    At the unveiling of the monument to the Great Elector, the founder\r\n    of the German navy, the Emperor spoke as follows:\r\n\r\nDowntrodden fields, desolate plains, razed villages, disease, poverty,\r\nand misery; these were the conditions in the sandy mark when the\r\nyoung Elector in his earliest youth was called to the throne by the\r\nsudden death of his father. Truly, no enviable heritage; a task that\r\ncalled for a man who was mature, experienced, and conversant with all\r\nbranches, and one which, even so, might have proved too difficult.\r\n\r\nUndismayed, the young man entered upon his mission, and with wonderful\r\nability he succeeded in discharging it. With an iron energy, keeping\r\nthe goal which he had once set for himself ever before his eyes,\r\nallowing nothing to turn him aside, the Elector raised up and\r\nstrengthened his country, put his people in a position to defend\r\nthemselves, freed his borders of enemies, and soon acquired for himself\r\nsuch a position that the contemporary world, and even his enemies, gave\r\nhim while still living that title, \"The Great,\" which in other cases a\r\ngrateful people only bestows after an arduous life of service upon a\r\ndeparted ruler.\r\n\r\nAnd this youth who grew up to powerful manhood, who had directed his\r\ncountry in this work, was the first prince who called our attention to\r\nthe sea; he was the founder of the Brandenburg fleet.\r\n\r\nIf the German fleet, then, sets up a monument to him, and if her\r\nofficers and crews educate themselves and learn steadfastness of\r\npurpose by looking at his statue, they are merely discharging their\r\nhonorable duty. God had so disposed that the Elector should pass his\r\nyouth in the Netherlands and learn to foster and appreciate labor,\r\nindustry, foreign relationships, and the advantages of trade. He\r\ncarried over into his own country what he had acquired among that\r\nindustrious and simple folk of seafarers who come from German stock. At\r\nthat time it was, indeed, a most important decision, and one which at\r\nfirst his subjects and contemporaries could hardly understand.\r\n\r\nUnder his powerful will and protection, and in the hands of tried\r\nNetherlanders, the Admiral Raule and his brother, the Brandenburg fleet\r\nflourished. Only after the death of the Elector did his creation fall\r\nto decay. They were not destined to harvest the fruits of their labor.\r\nHis successors in power had first to establish through battles their\r\nrights, in order to have a voice in the world and to be allowed to\r\nrule, undisturbed and in peace, the people within their borders. As a\r\nresult, our eyes were turned from the sea again in order that after\r\ncenturies of fierce conflict the mark and Prussia might finally be\r\nwelded together.\r\n\r\nThus, through the guidance of God and through the labors of the\r\nsuccessors of the Great Elector, the power of his house was founded\r\non that firm foundation and with the corner-stone which he had laid.\r\nIt was this princely power that made it possible for the house of\r\nHohenzollern to take up the German imperial dignity. They founded that\r\ndynastic power which the German Emperor must have in order to be in a\r\nposition to care for and protect powerfully the welfare of the empire\r\neverywhere and to force its opponents to respect its flag.\r\n\r\nHis monument now stands before the academy. That younger generation to\r\nwhom the future belongs, which is to cultivate the seeds that we have\r\nsown and to reap the harvest of our labors, may now direct its gaze\r\ntoward this prince and be edified by his example.\r\n\r\nHe was God-fearing and stern, inflexibly stern toward himself and\r\ntoward others; he trusted firmly in God and allowed God to direct him,\r\nundismayed by any reverse or by any disappointment; as a Christian, he\r\nlooked upon these merely as trials sent him from on high. In this way\r\nthe Great Elector lived his life, and this is the example which we are\r\nto follow. The motto which made it possible for him never to lose his\r\nhope and courage, in spite of all vexations, in spite of all reverses\r\nand all grievous experiences and trials, was the red thread which ran\r\nthrough his life and which is expressed in his phrase: \"_Domine, fac me\r\nscire viam, quam ambulem._\"\r\n\r\nMay this be true also of the officers and crews of my navy! So long\r\nas we work on this basis we can overcome, undismayed, every grievous\r\nphase in the development of the navy and of our Fatherland which God's\r\nprovidence may have in store for us. Let that be the way that you shall\r\ngo! Let that be the foundation on which my navy is built up! This will\r\nenable you to conquer in battle and to endure all vexations until the\r\nsun again breaks forth from the clouds.\r\n\r\nI therefore turn over this new monument to the navy. May she protect,\r\ncherish, and honor it, so that in the future she may develop characters\r\nwhich are like his who now stands before her! Let the monument be\r\nunveiled!\r\n\r\n\r\nENTRANCE OF PRINCE EITEL FRIEDRICH INTO THE ARMY\r\n\r\nJULY 7, 1901\r\n\r\n    The second son of the Emperor took up his service in the 1st\r\n    Infantry Regiment of the Guard on the completion of his eighteenth\r\n    year. On this occasion, in the presence of many princes, officers\r\n    of the army, and military attachés, the Emperor turned over his son\r\n    to the regiment with the following words:\r\n\r\nMy second son, Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia, having applied\r\nhimself eagerly to his studies, has now, according to the verdict of\r\nhis superiors, passed his examination with a \"good.\" His childish\r\nyears lie behind him, and to-day he takes up the tasks of life for\r\nwhich he has prepared himself--his foremost task the defense of the\r\nFatherland--his noblest weapon the sword, his noblest uniform the\r\nPrussian soldier's uniform, the uniform of my 1st Infantry Regiment of\r\nthe Guard.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which the Prince has shown in the course of his youthful\r\ndevelopment, as well as his oath, are a pledge to me that he will be\r\na thoroughgoing officer and a faithful servant of his Fatherland.\r\nParticularly gifted for the military life, with a quick eye for detail,\r\nthe Prince, as soon as he has passed his examination as an officer,\r\nwill in the ranks of the regiment devote himself actively to the\r\nservice for which he longs.\r\n\r\nAlthough still very youthful, he should, nevertheless, be an example\r\nof earnestness, an example in observing all military rules, an example\r\nabove all as an officer and man. I can think of nothing more beautiful\r\nthan this, that he may be an earnest officer who turns an experienced\r\neye upon life, unbending as iron in everything which constitutes the\r\nchivalry of the officer's position, stern with himself and maintaining\r\nin strictest self-control the traditions of his house and of this great\r\nregiment. May he go his way untroubled by voices from without, with his\r\neye firmly fixed upon his goal, and responsible only to his God and to\r\nhis father!\r\n\r\nBut the regiment in which I have now enrolled my second son gives me\r\nthe assurance that the young Prince will grow up in an environment,\r\nwhere from all sides the glorious traditions of Prussian history in\r\ngood and evil days will be brought before him. The grenadiers of this\r\nregiment will be fully conscious of the honor which is bestowed upon\r\nthem through the fact that once more a young Hohenzollern takes his\r\nplace under her flag.\r\n\r\nMy son, I wish you happiness of this day. Up to the present you have\r\ngiven me joy, and from this time forth I hope that you will experience\r\njoy in the life and the work which lies before you. Step into the ranks\r\nand draw your sword!\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUE ART\r\n\r\nBERLIN, DECEMBER 18, 1901\r\n\r\n    The family of the Hohenzollerns has possessed undoubted genius\r\n    in many lines. Frederick the Great and the Emperor's great-uncle\r\n    Frederick William IV were particularly gifted on the artistic\r\n    side. The present Emperor, whose versatility is amazing, has taken\r\n    a particular interest in things literary and artistic, and has\r\n    himself occasionally assumed the rôle of creative artist. The\r\n    symbolic picture, representing the coming of the \"Yellow Peril,\"\r\n    which he is said to have painted for the Czar, caused much comment,\r\n    mostly unfavorable.[36] He has, however, assumed a prominent if not\r\n    a decisive rôle in directing sculpture, painting, and drama in his\r\n    capital. Just as he has directed modifications in battle-ships,\r\n    so also he has directed modifications in public buildings. As he\r\n    is in a position to distribute rewards, his advice is frequently\r\n    accepted without question. The following anecdote, told by a\r\n    prominent German architect and recounted by a recent writer, may\r\n    serve as an illustration: Drawings for a new church in Berlin were\r\n    submitted to the Emperor for assent or correction. His Majesty,\r\n    intending to make a marginal remark, with regard to the cross on\r\n    the top of the steeple, put a letter for reference above the cross\r\n    and drew a straight line from the letter down to the cross. Having\r\n    changed his mind, he drew an X vigorously through the letter. When\r\n    the architect received his plans again he studied carefully all\r\n    the Emperor's corrections, but mistook the cancelled letter for a\r\n    star. Knowing better than to ask questions, he built the church\r\n    and put a big star on a huge iron pole above the top of the cross.\r\n    This strange excrescence was in existence a few years ago and is\r\n    probably still visible.\r\n\r\n    [36] \"Emperor William, one of the most comical persons of our\r\n         time, orator, poet, musician, dramatic writer, and artist,\r\n         and, above all, patriot, has lately painted a picture\r\n         representing all the nations of Europe with swords, standing\r\n         at the seashore and, at the indication of Archangel Michael,\r\n         looking at the sitting figures of Buddha and Confucius in the\r\n         distance. According to William's intention, this should mean\r\n         that the nations of Europe ought to unite in order to defend\r\n         themselves against the peril which is proceeding from there.\r\n         He is quite right from his coarse, pagan, patriotic point of\r\n         view, which is eighteen hundred years behind the times. The\r\n         European nations, forgetting Christ, have in the name of their\r\n         patriotism more and more irritated these peaceful nations and\r\n         have taught them patriotism and war, and have now irritated\r\n         them so much that, indeed, if Japan and China will as fully\r\n         forget the teachings of Buddha and of Confucius as we have\r\n         forgotten the teachings of Christ, they will soon learn the\r\n         art of killing people (they learn these things quickly, as\r\n         Japan has proved), and, being fearless, agile, strong, and\r\n         populous, they will inevitably very soon make of the countries\r\n         of Europe, if Europe does not invent something stronger than\r\n         guns and Edison's inventions, what the countries of Europe\r\n         are making of Africa. 'The disciple is not above his master:\r\n         but every one that is perfect shall be as his master' (Luke\r\n         6:40).\"--TOLSTOI.\r\n\r\n    It is a curious fact that for all the Emperor's insistence upon\r\n    what might be called nationalism, in artistic matters at least,\r\n    in poetry, sculpture, and the drama, he has very little sympathy\r\n    with the modern German tendencies. Klinger and Stuck, Ludwig von\r\n    Hofmann and Thoma have found no favor, and no attention was paid to\r\n    Böcklin. His literary preferences will become more evident after a\r\n    reading of his talk with Ganghofer (November 12, 1906).\r\n\r\n    In the matter of sculpture, the achievement in which the Emperor\r\n    takes most pride is undoubtedly the famous Siegesallee in Berlin.\r\n    It consists of a number of monumental, heroic figures taken from\r\n    the history of his house. The avenue, the general scheme, and the\r\n    arrangement of many of the figures were planned by him, and the\r\n    figures were chosen in consultation with his historiographer. The\r\n    style is supposedly classic; there are many incidental animal\r\n    figures, and a sphinx and the sibyl help to represent Bismarck. The\r\n    attempt to make heroic and classic certain of the fairly mediocre\r\n    representatives of his line, like Albrecht, Otto and John, Joachim,\r\n    Frederick, and George William, seems to have been too difficult\r\n    a task even for that Berlin school of sculpture, which the\r\n    Emperor feels would bear comparison with that of the Renaissance.\r\n    Notwithstanding his own efforts to awaken art \"from the cold sleep\r\n    of unculture,\" it is perhaps significant that powerful, independent\r\n    personalities, Michelangelos in sculpture and Bismarcks in\r\n    politics, do not seem to thrive under the Emperor's protection.\r\n\r\nThis eighteenth day of December has a certain significance in the\r\nhistory of our art here in Berlin, from the fact that that revered\r\nprotector of the Muses, my late father, and my mother, who was so\r\ngifted in the arts, dedicated on that day, fifteen years ago, the\r\nAnthropological Museum. This was in a way the last great closing act\r\nwhich my father accomplished in this direction, and I look upon it as a\r\nspecial piece of good fortune that it is on precisely this day of the\r\nyear that the works for the Siegesallee could be completed.\r\n\r\nI seize with joy the opportunity to express to you all, first, my\r\ncongratulations and, secondly, my thanks for the way and manner\r\nin which you have helped me to carry out my original plan. The\r\naccomplishment of the programme for the Siegesallee has required a\r\nnumber of years, and it was the able historiographer of my house,\r\nProfessor Doctor Koser, who put me in a position to assign to the\r\ngentlemen the tasks which it was possible for them to carry out.\r\n\r\nOnce we had found the historical basis, it was possible to go ahead;\r\nand after the choice of the princes was decided upon, then the most\r\ncompetent men in the way of historical research were found to help the\r\ngentlemen in their work. In this way the groups were conceived, and,\r\nconditioned to a certain degree by history, they gradually took form.\r\n\r\nAfter this part of the work was done, then, naturally, came the\r\nhardest question of all: Would it be possible, as I hoped, to find\r\nenough artists in Berlin who would be in a position to give themselves\r\nentirely to the execution of this programme?\r\n\r\nI had in mind when I approached the solution of this problem, if I\r\nwere successful, to show to the world what I considered to be the most\r\nadvantageous method of solving an artistic question of this character.\r\nThe best way to go about it, I believe, consists not in the appointment\r\nof commissions, not in the establishment of all possible kinds of prize\r\ncontests and competitions, but in following the old established method\r\nwhich they used in classical times and also later in the Middle Ages.\r\nIn this way, the direct intercourse between the employer and the artist\r\noffers a security for the favorable shaping of the work and for the\r\nsuccessful accomplishment of the task.\r\n\r\nI am especially indebted in this particular to Professor Rheinhold\r\nBegas in that, when I went to him with these thoughts, he made it clear\r\nto me without further ceremony that there was absolutely no doubt but\r\nthat there were enough artists of all kinds in Berlin to carry out\r\nsuch an idea without difficulty. With his help and on the basis of\r\nfriendships formed in the circle of sculptors here through visits to\r\nexhibitions and studios I did, indeed, succeed in getting together\r\na staff with which to proceed in carrying out this task--a staff the\r\ngreater part of which I see gathered about me here to-day.\r\n\r\nI believe that you will not deny that I have made the execution of the\r\nprogramme developed by me as easy as possible for you. I have placed\r\nthe task before you and limited it in a general way, but for the rest\r\nI have given you absolute freedom, not only freedom in the combination\r\nand composition but precisely that freedom to put into it a certain\r\namount of yourselves--a thing that every artist must do in order to put\r\nhis own stamp upon his work; for every work of art contains within it a\r\nkernel of the artist's own character. I believe that this experiment,\r\nif I may call it so, through which the Siegesallee was completed, dare\r\nbe looked upon as a success.\r\n\r\nAlthough interviews have been necessary between me and the artists\r\nwho were carrying out the work in order to settle every doubt and to\r\nanswer every question, no difficulties of a more serious nature have\r\nshown themselves. I believe, therefore, that from this point of view\r\nwe can look back upon the Siegesallee with general satisfaction. You\r\nhave individually solved your problems as you saw fit, and I, on my\r\nside, have the feeling that I have allowed you the fullest measure of\r\nfreedom and time--a thing I hold to be necessary for the artist. I have\r\nnever gone into details and have contented myself with giving merely\r\nthe direction, the impulse.\r\n\r\nBut it fills me with pride and joy to-day when I think that Berlin\r\nstands before the whole world with a body of artists who are capable\r\nof carrying out such a magnificent work. It proves that the Berlin\r\nschool of sculpture stands at a height such as could hardly have been\r\nsurpassed even in the time of the Renaissance. And I think every one\r\nof you will agree, without jealousy, that the effective example of\r\nRheinhold Begas and his conception, based upon his knowledge of the\r\nantique, has been a guide to many of you in the working out of this\r\ngreat task.\r\n\r\nHere, also, we could draw a parallel between the great achievements in\r\nthe art of the Middle Ages and of the Italians; since in that time,\r\nalso, the sovereign and art-loving prince who offered the commissions\r\nto the artists at the same time found the masters, about whom a crowd\r\nof young disciples gathered, so that a certain school was in this way\r\ndeveloped which was able to accomplish remarkable things.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, the Pergamon Museum has also been opened on this same\r\nday, in Berlin. I regard that, too, as a very important portion of\r\nour art history and as a good omen and a happy coincidence. A more\r\nmagnificent collection cannot be imagined than the abundance of beauty\r\nwhich is displayed in these rooms before the eyes of the astonished\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nBut how does art stand in the world to-day? It takes its examples and\r\ncreates out of the great sources of Mother Nature; and Nature, in spite\r\nof her great, apparently boundless, limitless freedom, acts according\r\nto everlasting laws which the Creator has set for Himself and which\r\ncan never be infringed upon or overstepped without endangering the\r\ndevelopment of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in art. And in looking upon the magnificent remains\r\nfrom the old classic period we experience the same feeling. Here, too,\r\nan eternal, unchanging law rules; the law of beauty and harmony--of\r\næsthetics. This law was expressed by the ancients in so surprising and\r\npowerful a manner and in so complete a form that we, for all our modern\r\nperceptions and our power of accomplishment, are proud if it can be\r\nsaid of some very especially good piece of work: \"That is almost as\r\ngood as if it had been done 1900 years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Almost!\" Under this impression I shall ask you to take this injunction\r\nto heart. Sculpture has for the most part remained free from the\r\nso-called modern tendencies and influences; it still stands high\r\nand sublime. Keep it so; do not let yourselves be led astray by the\r\njudgment of men and by all sorts of windy doctrines to give up these\r\ngreat principles upon which it is based.\r\n\r\nAn art which oversteps the laws and boundaries which I have indicated\r\nis no longer art; it is factory work, it is trade; and that no art dare\r\nbecome. Through the much-misused word \"freedom\" and under her flag\r\none often falls into indefiniteness, boundlessness, conceit. However,\r\nhe who cuts loose from the law of beauty and from the feeling for\r\næsthetics and harmony which, whether he can express it or not, every\r\nman feels in his heart; he who thinks the chief thing is to turn his\r\nthoughts in a certain direction toward a definite solution of more\r\ntechnical problems, sins against the very sources of his art.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, art must help to educate the people; it must also give the\r\nlower classes, after their cramping exertions, the opportunity to right\r\nthemselves again through ideals. To us, the German people, great ideals\r\nare a lasting possession, while with other peoples they have been more\r\nor less lost. It is now the German people whose special province it\r\nis to protect these great ideas, to foster them, to set them forth;\r\nand to these ideas belongs the duty of giving to those classes who\r\ntire themselves out through labor the opportunity to raise themselves\r\nthrough beautiful things and to work themselves out of and above their\r\nordinary circles of thought.\r\n\r\nIf, however, art, as often happens nowadays, does nothing more than to\r\nmake misery even more hideous than it already is, then it sins against\r\nthe German people. The fostering of the ideal is the greatest work\r\nof culture; and if we wish to be and to remain a pattern in this for\r\nother peoples, then we must all work together; and if culture is to\r\naccomplish its full task, then it must penetrate through to the very\r\nlowest strata of the people. That it can only do if art lends a hand,\r\nif it raises up instead of drawing down into the gutter.\r\n\r\nAs ruler, I often feel very bitter that art, through her masters,\r\nshould not be energetic enough to make a stand against such tendencies.\r\nI do not doubt for a moment but that many an earnest but misguided\r\ncharacter, perhaps filled with the best intentions, is to be found\r\namong the devotees of this tendency. The real artist needs no\r\nadvertising, no press, no connections. I do not believe that your great\r\nexamples in the realm of science, either in ancient Greece or in Italy\r\nor in the time of the Renaissance, used any such methods as are now\r\noften practised through the press to bring their ideas especially into\r\nthe foreground. They worked as God directed them; for the rest they\r\nallowed the world to criticise.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the way an honorable, sincere artist must act. Art which\r\nstoops to advertising is no longer art, were it praised to the skies.\r\nEvery one, be he never so simple, has a feeling for that which is\r\nbeautiful or ugly, and it is to foster this feeling further among\r\nthe people that I have need of all of you; and that you should have\r\naccomplished such a piece of work in the Siegesallee, I, therefore,\r\nthank you particularly.\r\n\r\nI may now confide something to you. The impression which the\r\nSiegesallee makes upon foreigners is quite overwhelming; everywhere\r\nan immense respect for German sculpture is noticeable. May you remain\r\nstanding upon these heights; may also my children and my grandchildren,\r\nif they shall one day be granted to me, keep the same masters by their\r\nside! Then, I am convinced, our people will be in a position to love\r\nthe beautiful and to hold high the ideal.\r\n\r\nI raise my glass and drink to the health of all of you; and, once more,\r\nmy heartiest thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONUMENT TO GENERAL VON ROSENBERG\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20, 1902\r\n\r\n    A monument was erected to the famous cavalry general Von Rosenberg,\r\n    in Hanover. After the unveiling of the monument the Emperor\r\n    responded to Count von Waldersee's toast as follows:\r\n\r\nTo-day I greet all the cavalry of the German army. Even from his grave\r\nthe general's personality has issued so magic and so powerful an appeal\r\nthat it has called the horsemen together from all quarters of the\r\nGerman Empire and from the contingents of my affiliated rulers, so that\r\nto-day for the first time our German cavalry is gathered together in a\r\nsingle great cohort.\r\n\r\nWe wish to draw a lesson from this day. As the general recognized only\r\nhis service and the call of duty, may we do likewise! The highest\r\nreward that can come to an officer through his service in life is to\r\nfill his position to his own complete satisfaction. Looking back over\r\nthe life of General von Rosenberg, we can compose a proverb which\r\nshould apply to us also, now and for all time: \"Know your aim, and then\r\nexert every effort.\" Let that be the standard for our cavalry!\r\n\r\nSo may we also create for ourselves from this simple monument a symbol\r\nand an example. A block of granite from the mark bears the features of\r\nthe general inlaid in bronze; so may we hedge and protect that piece of\r\ngranite of our army which we call the cavalry and allow it to harden,\r\nso that he who bites upon it may lose his teeth![37]\r\n\r\n[37] A phrase of Frederick the Great which Count Bülow had used in the\r\n     Reichstag January 8, 1902, in speaking of the English Colonial\r\n     Secretary Chamberlain's attack on the German army.\r\n\r\nWith this wish I raise my glass and drink to the memory of the general,\r\nto the German cavalry, and to its most conspicuous representative, the\r\nGeneral Field-Marshal, Count von Waldersee. Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ORDER CHANGETH\r\n\r\nAIX, JUNE 19, 1902\r\n\r\n    The Emperor, accepting an invitation from the city, came to Aix\r\n    with the Empress and the Crown Prince. It was here that Charlemagne\r\n    was probably born and here that he died. The present Rathaus was\r\n    built upon the ruins of his palace, and it was in the so-called\r\n    Coronation Room that the Emperor delivered his address.\r\n\r\nIn the name of her Majesty, the Empress, and in my name I thank you\r\nparticularly for the indescribably patriotic and enthusiastic reception\r\nwhich has been prepared for us by all classes of the city of Aix. I\r\nearnestly desired to visit the city of Aix, and I thank you for the\r\nopportunity which you have given me through your invitation.\r\n\r\nWho would not be deeply moved on such historic ground as that of Aix\r\nby the breath and murmur of the past and of the present? Who would not\r\nthink of the providential guidance of Heaven as he looks back over the\r\nhistory of the centuries which our Fatherland has lived through in its\r\nconnection with Aix?\r\n\r\nAix is the cradle of German imperialism, for it was here that\r\nCharlemagne erected his throne, and the city of Aix shone in his\r\nreflected glory. So important, so imposing was the figure of this\r\ngreat German prince that from Rome the dignity of the Roman Cæsars was\r\nbestowed upon him, and he was chosen to enter into the inheritance\r\nof the _Imperium Romanum_--certainly a splendid recognition of the\r\ncapability of our German stock as it appeared for the first time\r\nin history. For the Roman sceptre had fallen from the hands of the\r\nCæsars and their successors. Crumbling and decayed, the Roman edifice\r\nwas tottering to its fall, and only the appearance of the victorious\r\nGermans with their virtuous dispositions made it possible to point a\r\nnew and as yet untrodden road for the history of the world. It goes\r\nwithout saying that the mighty Charles, the great King of the Franks,\r\ndrew upon himself the gaze of Rome which looked to him as to its\r\nbulwark and protector.\r\n\r\nBut the task of combining the office of Roman Emperor with the dignity\r\nand burden of the German King was too severe. What he was able to\r\naccomplish through his powerful personality Fate denied to his\r\nfollowers; and through their desire for a world-empire, the Emperors\r\nof the later generations lost sight of the German people and country.\r\nThey turned toward the south in order to maintain the world-empire, and\r\nin so doing forgot the Germans. So gradually our German country and\r\npeople perished.\r\n\r\nJust as the blossoming aloe gathers up all the strength of the plant\r\nfor this task and, striving upward, develops flower on flower and\r\nfascinates the eye of the astonished beholder, while the plant itself\r\nwithers and its roots shrivel away, so it was with the Roman Empire of\r\nthe German Nation.\r\n\r\nAnother empire has now arisen. The German people are now blessed with\r\nanother Emperor, whom they had themselves gone out to seek. Sword in\r\nhand, on the field of battle, the crown was won, and the flag of the\r\nempire flutters high in the breeze once more. With the same enthusiasm\r\nand love with which the German people held to the imperial idea has\r\nthe new empire entered into being; but the tasks are now different.\r\nLimited from without by the boundaries of our country, it became our\r\nduty to steel ourselves from within in preparation for the duties which\r\nwere then laid upon our people and which could not be discharged in the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\nAnd so we see the empire, although still young, growing strong within\r\nitself from year to year, while confidence in it is becoming more and\r\nmore secure on every side. The powerful German army, however, affords\r\na support to the peace of Europe. In keeping with the character of\r\nthe Germans, we limit ourselves from without in order to remain free\r\nwithin. Far away over the sea our speech is spreading, and far away\r\nflows the stream of our knowledge and research. There is no work in the\r\nrealm of later research which is not written in our language, and no\r\nthought is born of science which is not first utilized by us in order\r\nlater to be taken over by other nations. And this is that world-empire\r\nwhich the German spirit strives for. If we, then, wish to discharge\r\nadequately our further great responsibilities, we dare not forget that\r\nthe foundation on which the empire was built is based upon simplicity\r\nand the fear of God as well as the lofty moral conceptions of our\r\nancestors. Heavily, indeed, was the hand of our God laid upon us at the\r\nbeginning of the previous century, and mighty was the arm of Providence\r\nwhich shaped the steel and welded it in the furnace of misery until the\r\nweapon was finished.\r\n\r\nAnd so I expect of you all that, whether churchmen or laymen, you will\r\nhelp me to maintain religion among the people. We must work together in\r\norder to preserve the moral foundations and the healthy strength of the\r\nGerman stock. But that can only be done if we preserve its religion,\r\nand this is true equally of Catholics and Protestants.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, the more pleased to-day, to bring to the leaders of\r\nthe church who are here represented a bit of news of which I am proud\r\nto be the bearer. Beside me stands General von Loë, a faithful servant\r\nof his Kings. He was sent to Rome to the jubilee of the Holy Father,\r\nand when he delivered to him my gift and my congratulations and in\r\nprivate conversation had explained how things stood in our German\r\ncountry the Holy Father answered him that he was happy to be able to\r\nsay that he had always thought highly of the piety of the Germans and\r\nof the German army; he said he could even go further and commissioned\r\nGeneral von Loë to report the following to his Emperor: The German\r\nEmpire is the only[38] country in Europe in which training, order, and\r\ndiscipline rule, in which respect for authority and reverence for\r\nthe church exist, and in which every Catholic can live freely and\r\nundisturbed in his faith, and for this he thanked the German Emperor.\r\n\r\n[38] The word \"only\" has not received official sanction, but is printed\r\n     by Penzler.\r\n\r\nThis, gentlemen, justifies me in saying that both our churches,\r\nstanding side by side, must forever have before their eyes the idea of\r\nstrengthening and preserving the fear of God and respect for religion.\r\nThe fact that we are modern men and that we work in this or that field\r\nmakes no difference. Whoever does not base his life upon religion is\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is fitting on this day and in this place not merely to speak\r\nbut also to make a pledge, I hereby express my vow that I set myself\r\nand my house, the entire empire, the entire people, and my army,\r\nsymbolically represented by this baton, under the cross and under the\r\nprotection of Him of whom the great apostle said, \"Neither is there\r\nsalvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given\r\namong men whereby we must be saved,\" and who has said of Himself:\r\n\"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.\"\r\n\r\nI drink to the health of the city of Aix in the firm conviction that\r\nthe words which I have spoken will here fall upon good ground, just as\r\nI am assured from what I have seen among both the older and younger\r\ncitizens of this city that our house and our throne will in the future\r\nlikewise find firm support within their walls. Long live the city of\r\nAix!\r\n\r\n\r\nALFRED KRUPP AND THE SOCIALISTS\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 26, 1902\r\n\r\n    The present speech and the one which follows it, to the working\r\n    men in Breslau, may conveniently be taken together, as they both\r\n    concern the Emperor's attitude toward the Socialists. Of all\r\n    his policies, his attempt to destroy this political party has\r\n    been least successful. It had increased from 763,000 in 1887 to\r\n    4,250,000 in 1912, when it numbered more than twice as many voters\r\n    as its nearest competitor, the Centre party, 1,996,000. The Emperor\r\n    had tried to introduce repeatedly subversion acts which would have\r\n    made for the persecution of this the largest political party in his\r\n    empire. When, on October 13, 1895, a manufacturer was murdered in\r\n    Mülhausen by a workman who had been repeatedly convicted of theft,\r\n    William II telegraphed to his widow: \"Another sacrifice to the\r\n    revolutionary movement engendered by the Socialists.\" This hostile\r\n    attitude was unavailing and aroused the criticism of the greatest\r\n    German historian, Mommsen:\r\n\r\n    \"It is unfortunately true that at the present time the Social\r\n    Democracy is the only great party which has any claim to political\r\n    respect. It is not necessary to refer to talent. Everybody in\r\n    Germany knows that with brains like those of Bebel it would be\r\n    possible to furnish forth a dozen noblemen from east of the Elbe in\r\n    a fashion that would make them shine among their peers.\r\n\r\n    \"The devotion, the self-sacrificing spirit of the Social\r\n    Democratic masses, impresses even those who are far from sharing\r\n    their aims. Our Liberals might well take a lesson from the\r\n    discipline of the party.\" And again, only about a week after this\r\n    speech of the Emperor's Mommsen wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"There must be an end of the superstition, as false as it is\r\n    perfidious, that the nation is divided into parties of law and\r\n    order on the one hand and a party of revolution on the other, and\r\n    that it is the prime political duty of citizens belonging to the\r\n    former category to shun the labor party as if it were in quarantine\r\n    for the plague and to combat it as the enemy of the state.\"\r\n\r\n    The Emperor has had many friends among the leaders in the\r\n    industrial world. Alfred Krupp had stood in close relation to his\r\n    sovereign and had been one of the founders and prime movers in\r\n    the German Navy League, which, more than anything else, had made\r\n    possible the realization of the imperial naval policy. The Emperor\r\n    is altogether mistaken in ascribing the stories circulated about\r\n    Krupp to the malignity of Social Democratic editors. Very ugly\r\n    rumors, whether true or false, had long before this time circulated\r\n    about this industrial leader; they could have been heard in other\r\n    countries of Europe, especially in Italy, and most particularly in\r\n    Tiberius's island of Capri, where he is said to have had a villa.\r\n\r\n    The address was delivered in the waiting-room of the station at\r\n    Essen on the day of Krupp's funeral.\r\n\r\nI feel the need of expressing to you how deeply my heart is moved by\r\nthe death of this man. Her Majesty, the Empress and Queen, wishes me\r\nto express to you her grief also, and she has already expressed it in\r\nwriting to Frau Krupp. I have often, with my wife, been a guest in the\r\nKrupp house and have felt the charm of his lovable personality. Our\r\nrelations have become so well established in the course of the years\r\nthat I dare call myself a friend of the deceased and of his house.\r\nOn this account I have not wished to deny myself the privilege of\r\nappearing here to-day at his funeral, and I hold it to be my duty to\r\nstand at the side of the widow and daughters of my friend.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar circumstances which accompanied the sad event also make it\r\nincumbent upon me to be here as the head of the German Empire, to hold\r\nthe shield of the German Emperor over the house and the memory of this\r\nman. Whoever knew the deceased intimately knows with what a sensitive\r\nand delicate nature he was endowed and that this was the one vulnerable\r\npoint through which to deal him a death-blow. He was the victim of his\r\nunimpeachable integrity.\r\n\r\nAn event has occurred within the German countries so degrading and low\r\nthat it has aroused all hearts and must bring the blush of shame to\r\nthe cheeks of every German patriot, because of the disgrace brought\r\nupon our entire people. The honor of a man, German to the core, who\r\nlived only for others, who had in his mind only the welfare of the\r\nFatherland, but above all that of his employees, has been assailed.\r\n\r\nThis deed, with its consequences, is nothing less than murder; for\r\nthere is no difference between him who mixes a poisonous drink and\r\noffers it to another and him who from the safe ambush of his editor's\r\noffice destroys the honorable name of a fellow man with the poisoned\r\narrows of his slanders and kills him through the torment of soul caused\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nWho was it that began this shameful attack upon our friend? Men who up\r\nto the present have been counted as Germans, but who are now unworthy\r\nof this name, who sprang from the classes of the German working people,\r\nwho have such a tremendous amount to thank Krupp for and of whom\r\nthousands in the streets with tearful faces waved a last farewell to\r\nthe bier of their benefactor.\r\n\r\nYou, Krupp's workmen, have ever held faithfully to your employer and\r\nhave clung to him; gratitude is not wiped out of your hearts. With\r\npride I have seen everywhere abroad the name of the Fatherland honored\r\nthrough the work of your hands. Men who wish to be the leaders of the\r\nGerman workmen have robbed you of your dear master. It remains for you\r\nto shield and protect him and to preserve his memory from disgrace.\r\n\r\nI trust, therefore, that you will find the proper means of making it\r\nclear to the body of German working men that it is important hereafter\r\nto make it impossible for good and honorable working men to have any\r\ncommunity of interest or close relationship with the perpetrators of\r\nthis shameful deed; for it is the honor of the working man that has\r\nbeen besmirched. Whoever will sit at the same table with these people\r\ndeliberately lays himself open to a charge of moral participation in\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\nI have sufficient confidence in the German laborers to believe that\r\nthey are conscious of the extreme seriousness of the present moment\r\nand that, as German men, they will find a solution for this difficult\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORKING MAN ONCE MORE\r\n\r\nBRESLAU, DECEMBER 5, 1902\r\n\r\nThat the working men of Breslau have decided to come to me, their King\r\nand father, fills me with the greatest satisfaction, for two reasons.\r\nIn the first place, you have not disappointed the expectations which I\r\nexpressed in Essen; in the second, you have helped thereby to maintain\r\nfree from reproach the memory of my late friend Krupp.\r\n\r\nFrom my heart I thank the spokesman for his cordial, patriotic words.\r\nYou show thereby that an honorable attitude and a dependence upon the\r\nKing and the Fatherland are taking firm root among you. Your condition\r\nhas indeed become the object of my deepest interest and consideration,\r\nfor I observed with pride in foreign lands how the German working man\r\nwas considered above all others, and with justice. Your hearts may\r\nexult and you may well rejoice in your work and your condition.\r\n\r\nLed by the remarkable message[39] of the great Emperor William I, I have\r\nimproved the social legislation so that a good and secure condition of\r\nexistence has been created for the working men through old age, and\r\nthis has been accomplished often at great sacrifice to the employer.\r\nAnd our Germany is the only country in which legislation relating to\r\nthe welfare of the working classes has developed to any great degree.\r\n\r\n[39] See footnote to \"First Declaration of Polity,\" June 25, 1888.\r\n\r\nOn the ground of the great concern which your King has for your\r\ncondition I am justified in giving you also a word of warning. For\r\nyears you and your brothers have allowed yourselves to be deluded by\r\nthe agitators of the Socialists into thinking that if you do not belong\r\nto this party and acknowledge it no one pays any attention to you and\r\nthat you will not be in a position to obtain a hearing for your just\r\ninterests in the amelioration of your condition.\r\n\r\nThis is a gross lie and a serious error. Instead of representing you\r\ndirectly, the agitators seek to stir you up against your employers,\r\nagainst the other classes, against the throne, and against the church,\r\nand have in this way taken advantage of you, terrorized you, and\r\nflattered you in order to strengthen their own power. And to what end\r\nis this power used? Not for furthering your welfare, but for sowing\r\nhatred between the classes and for disseminating cowardly slanders that\r\nrespect nothing as sacred; and finally they have outraged the Almighty\r\nHimself.\r\n\r\nAs honor-loving men you cannot and dare not have anything more to do\r\nwith such people, and you must no longer be led by them. No! Send us\r\nas representatives your friends and comrades from your own ranks, the\r\nsimple, plain man from the shop who has your confidence. Such a man\r\nstands for your interests and your wishes, and we will gladly welcome\r\nhim as the representative of the German working classes, not as a\r\nSocial Democrat. With such representatives of the working classes, no\r\nmatter how many there may be, we will gladly work together for the good\r\nof the people and of the country.\r\n\r\nIn this way your future will be well cared for, especially since it\r\nnaturally and closely depends upon loyalty to the King, upon respect\r\nfor law and for the state, for the honor of one's fellow men and\r\nbrothers, true to the proverb: \"Fear God, love your brothers, and honor\r\nthe King.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOLARSHIP AND RELIGION\r\n\r\nBERLIN, FEBRUARY 15, 1903\r\n\r\n    As a result of a lecture before the Oriental Society of Berlin, a\r\n    very serious controversy arose in religious circles in Germany. The\r\n    Emperor gave his opinion in the following open letter, which was\r\n    printed in the _Grenzboten_. It is said that this very significant\r\n    letter shows the influence of the court chaplain, Doctor Dryander.\r\n    Certain of the ideas are, however, thoroughly characteristic of the\r\n    Emperor.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOLLMANN:\r\n\r\nMy telegram to you must have removed the doubts which you still\r\nentertained regarding the conclusion of the lecture. It was perfectly\r\nclearly understood by the audience and therefore had to stand as it\r\ndoes; but I am very pleased that through your inquiry the matter of\r\nthis second lecture was again taken up, and I am glad to take this\r\noccasion, after reading through the section again, to present my\r\nposition in a clear light.\r\n\r\nDuring an evening meeting among ourselves Professor Delitzsch had the\r\nopportunity, with her Majesty, the Empress, and General Superintendent\r\nDryander, to confer and discuss thoroughly for several hours, during\r\nwhich I remained a passive listener. He, unfortunately, departed from\r\nthe standpoint of the thoroughgoing historian and Assyriologist and\r\npenetrated into the region of theological and religious conclusions and\r\nhypotheses, which were hazy and bold. When, however, he came to the\r\nNew Testament it soon became evident that I could not agree with him\r\nin the ideas which he developed concerning the person of the Redeemer,\r\nand I was compelled to state my own standpoint, which was diametrically\r\nopposed to his. He does not recognize the divinity of Christ and\r\ntherefore concludes in regard to the Old Testament that it does not\r\nrefer to Him as the Messiah. Here the Assyriologist and investigating\r\nhistorian ceases and the theologian with all his lights and shades\r\nsteps in. In this province I can only advise him to go very carefully,\r\nstep by step, and in any case to ventilate his theories only in\r\ntheological publications and in the circles of his colleagues and to\r\nspare us laymen and especially the Oriental Society, before whose forum\r\nall this is out of place. We excavate and read whatever we find and\r\npublish it for the advancement of knowledge and history, but not in\r\norder to help justify or combat the religious hypotheses of any one of\r\nmany learned men.\r\n\r\nIn Delitzsch's case the theologian has run away with the historian,\r\nand the latter serves merely as a point of departure for the former.\r\nI think it unfortunate that Delitzsch should not have stuck to his\r\noriginal programme, which he developed in former years, namely, on\r\nthe basis of the discoveries of our society, to ascertain through\r\nscientifically approved translations of the Scriptures how far these\r\noffer an illustration of the chronicle of the people of Israel;\r\nthat is, enlightenment as to historical events, customs, and uses,\r\ntraditions, politics, legislation, etc.; in other words, how far the\r\nundeniably highly developed Babylonian culture came into contact with\r\nthe Israelites, could work upon them, yes, even impress its stamp upon\r\nthem, and thereby accomplish, from a purely human point of view, a\r\nsort of rehabilitation for the Babylonians, who were, according to the\r\nOld Testament at least, a very crude, shameful, and one-sided people.\r\nThat was his original intention, at least as I understood it, and a\r\nprovince very fruitful and interesting to us all, the investigation,\r\nexplanation, and exposition of which must have interested us laymen to\r\nthe highest degree and would have demanded our deepest gratitude. But\r\nhe should have stuck to this. Unfortunately, however, in his zeal he\r\nhas overshot the mark. As was to be expected, the excavations brought\r\nto light communications which bear in a religious way upon the Old\r\nTestament. He should have collated this material and pointed out and\r\nexplained coincidences, when such occurred, but he should have left it\r\nto the listener to draw for himself all purely religious conclusions.\r\nIn this way his discourse would have commanded the interest and\r\ngood-will of the lay public. That, unfortunately, he has not done.\r\nPretending that he could explain it all on historical and purely human\r\ngrounds, he has attacked the question of revelation in a very polemical\r\nmanner and more or less denied it. That was a serious mistake, because\r\nhe touched many of his hearers in what was deepest and most sacred to\r\nthem. And whether he was right or wrong--that for the moment is all\r\none, since we are concerned not with a purely scientific gathering\r\nof theologians but with laymen of all kinds and conditions--he has\r\noverturned and rudely shaken many favorite conceptions and images\r\nwith which these people connect sacred and cherished ideas and has\r\nruthlessly shaken the foundation of their belief, if he has not swept\r\nit away altogether, a thing which only a mighty genius dare be bold\r\nenough to undertake and which the study of Assyriology alone does\r\nnot justify. Goethe also once treated this subject and pointed out\r\nespecially that one must be careful before a great, general public to\r\nbreak down only \"_Terminologiepagoden_\" [the pagodas of terminology].\r\nThe excellent professor, in his zeal, has overlooked the principle that\r\nit is very necessary to distinguish between what is and what is not\r\nfitting to the place, the public, etc. As a theological specialist he\r\ncan, through the avenue of special publications, express for his circle\r\nof colleagues his theses, hypotheses, and theories as well as his\r\nconvictions, which it would not do to express in a popular lecture or\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nI would like now to come back once more to my own personal standpoint\r\nin regard to the doctrine or view of revelation, as I have often\r\nexplained it to you, my dear Hollmann, and to other gentlemen. I\r\ndistinguish between two different kinds of revelation: one a continuous\r\nand in a manner historical revelation; the other a purely religious\r\none, preparing for the later appearance of the Messiah.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let me say, there is not the slightest doubt in my\r\nmind but that God reveals Himself, always and permanently, through the\r\nhuman race which He created. He has \"blown the breath of His nostrils\"\r\ninto man; that is, He has given him a piece of Himself--a soul. With\r\nfatherly love and interest He follows the development of mankind; in\r\norder to lead and advance it further, He \"reveals\" Himself in this or\r\nthat great sage or priest or king, be he heathen, Jew, or Christian.\r\nHammurabi was one, so were Moses, Abraham, Homer, Charlemagne,\r\nLuther, Shakespeare, Goethe, Kant, Emperor William the Great. These\r\nHe has sought out and made worthy, through His grace, to accomplish\r\naccording to His will splendid and imperishable deeds for their people\r\nin the spiritual as well as in the physical world. How often has my\r\ngrandfather expressly said that he was only an instrument in the hand\r\nof the Lord. The works of great spirits are given to the people by God\r\nin order that they may imitate them and feel their way further through\r\nthe intricacies of the unexplored regions of this life. Certainly God\r\nhas \"revealed\" Himself in different ways at different times, according\r\nto the condition and culture of the people, and still does so to-day.\r\nFor, as we are overcome by the greatness and power of the magnificent\r\nnature of creation and are astounded to see in it the revealed\r\ngreatness of God, so, just as surely, do we thankfully recognize in\r\nevery really great and splendid thing which a man or a god does the\r\nsplendor of the revelation of God. He works directly upon and among us!\r\n\r\nThe second kind of revelation, the more religious, is that which\r\nrelates to the coming of our Lord. From the time of Abraham on it\r\nis introduced slowly but prophetically--the coming of the All-wise,\r\nthe All-knowing; for mankind would otherwise have been lost. And now\r\nbegins the most wonderful phenomenon of all, the revelation of God.\r\nThe seed of Abraham and the people who developed from it regard as the\r\nmost sacred thing in the world a rigorous belief in a single God. They\r\nmust cherish it--. Separated during the Egyptian exile, the scattered\r\nportions, welded together a second time by Moses, strove ever to hold\r\nfast to their belief in a single God. It was the direct working of God\r\nupon these people which allowed them to rise again. And so it continues\r\nfurther down the centuries until the Messiah, who was announced and\r\nforetold by the prophets and psalmists, finally appears. The greatest\r\nrevelation of God in the world! For He appeared in the person of His\r\nSon; Christ is God; God in human form. He redeemed us, He inspires\r\nus, He draws us on to follow Him, we feel His fire burning within us,\r\nHis pity strengthens us, His dissatisfaction destroys us, but His\r\nintercession saves us. Sure of victory, building only upon His Word, we\r\ngo through work, scorn, sorrow, misery, and death, for we have in Him\r\nthe revealed Word of God and He never deceives.\r\n\r\nThat is the way I look at these questions. The Word of God has,\r\nthrough Luther, become everything, especially for us Evangelicals;\r\nand as a good theologian Delitzsch should not have forgotten that our\r\ngreat Luther taught us to sing and to believe: \"Ye shall let the Word\r\nstand!\" For me it goes without saying that the Old Testament contains\r\na great number of extracts which are of purely human origin and not\r\n\"the revealed Word of God.\" There are purely historical descriptions\r\nof events of all kinds which took place in the life of the people of\r\nIsrael in the realm of political, religious, moral, and spiritual\r\nmatters. So, for instance, the giving of the law on Mount Sinai may be\r\nlooked upon as inspired by God in only a symbolical sense; for Moses\r\nwas compelled to have recourse to some means of giving new force to\r\nold and well-known portions of the law (which were probably derived\r\nfrom the Codex of Hammurabi). Otherwise he might not have been able\r\nto unite and weld together a people whose organization had become lax\r\nand incapable of resistance. Here the historian can perhaps construe\r\nfrom the sense and the run of the words some relation to the laws of\r\nHammurabi, the friend of Abraham, which would perhaps be perfectly\r\nlogical; that would, however, in no way detract from the fact that God\r\ninspired Moses to do it and in so far revealed Himself to the people of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, therefore, our good professor ought hereafter to avoid\r\nhandling and bringing forward religion, as such, in his addresses to\r\nour society. On the other hand, he may continue unmolested to bring\r\nforward whatever connections there may be between the religion,\r\ncustoms, etc., of the Babylonians, etc., and the Old Testament. From\r\nwhich I derive the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n(a) I believe in one God, and one only.\r\n\r\n(b) In order to teach this we need a form, especially for our children.\r\n\r\n(c) This form has been up to the present time the Old Testament in its\r\npresent state. Through investigation, inscriptions, and excavations,\r\nthis form will certainly change materially; that does not matter, and\r\neven the fact that much will be lost from the nimbus of the chosen\r\npeople does not matter. The kernel and the content remain ever the\r\nsame: God and His work!\r\n\r\nReligion was never the result of science but the outpouring of the\r\nheart and being of man in his intercourse with God.\r\n\r\nWith heartiest thanks and many greetings,\r\n\r\n                                         Your true friend,\r\n\r\n                                      (Signed) WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\nP. S. You may make the fullest use of these lines; whoever wants to may\r\nread them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT AND HIS ARMY\r\n\r\nDÖBERITZ, MAY 29, 1903\r\n\r\n    After conducting the manoeuvres of the guard the Emperor dedicated\r\n    the obelisk to Frederick the Great. The character and achievements\r\n    of Frederick have been summarized in chapter I.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty years ago, on these same fields, his Majesty,\r\nFrederick II, who even in his lifetime was called \"the Great,\" gathered\r\ntogether a considerable part of his army in order to train and steel\r\nit for the mighty struggles which he foresaw in spirit through his\r\nprophetic vision. So important was this preparation for him that he did\r\nnot hesitate to trust his columns to the direction of his experienced\r\nfield-marshals. Here the great soldier King, working restlessly,\r\nnot overlooking details in his interest for the greater concerns of\r\nhistory, trained his regiments for the difficult tasks of the Seven\r\nYears' War, which was soon to set in, and created that inner bond\r\nbetween himself and his soldiers which inspired them to the greatest\r\ndeeds of daring, while he infused his spirit into his generals and\r\nso laid the foundation for the unmatched results which found their\r\ncrowning achievement in the victorious overthrow of a world in arms\r\nunited against him. Let these achievements be unforgotten; unforgotten\r\nthe names of the heroes of that great time.\r\n\r\nFrederick's enemies derisively called his little army the \"_Potsdamer\r\nWachtparade_\" [the \"Potsdam Guard's Parade\"]! Well, he showed them what\r\nhe could do at the head of it! And in later times likewise the \"Potsdam\r\nGuard's Parade\" fittingly showed the way to every one who tried to\r\ncultivate too close an acquaintance with it. This obelisk of northern\r\ngranite is erected in memory of that time. A memorial to \"Fredericus\r\nRex, the King and Hero,\" to be emulated by us all in working with\r\nunabated strength to the end that we may be ready to strike in any\r\nemergency. When in a moment the curtain shall fall, when the flags\r\nand standards dip in greeting, swords are lowered, and presented\r\nbayonets glisten--all this is done in honor not only of this block of\r\nstone but of him, the great King, his generals and field-marshals;\r\nof his great successor, William the Great, and his paladins, who now,\r\nassembled around the Great Ally above, look down upon us; and in honor\r\nof Prussia's glorious martial history and tradition. Attention, present\r\narms!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF GERMANY\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, JUNE 20, 1903\r\n\r\n    The equestrian statue of Emperor William I was dedicated in\r\n    Hamburg, June 20, 1903. The Emperor's interest in glorifying and\r\n    occasionally even in sanctifying his ancestors is frequently\r\n    noticeable. He has tried to assure to his grandfather the title\r\n    of William the Great, and the Emperor's friend Ballin, of the\r\n    Hamburg-American Line, has given this title as well as that of\r\n    Imperator to the well-known transatlantic steamers. It is perhaps\r\n    significant that Bismarck is not mentioned. The pedestal of this\r\n    monument was left blank. As has been noted, rumor has it that the\r\n    citizens of Hamburg were unwilling to bestow this title and feared\r\n    to offend with the simpler \"William I.\"\r\n\r\nIt has often been my task to express my thanks to great cities and\r\ntheir enthusiastic citizens; never have I found it so difficult to find\r\nthe correct, pertinent, and adequate expression for what I feel and\r\nwhat I have seen and experienced.\r\n\r\nIf, first of all, I may speak as grandson of the great Emperor, whose\r\nbronze likeness the city of Hamburg has just unveiled, I would like\r\nto give utterance to the gratitude which so stirs my heart, that the\r\ncitizens of Hamburg have been able in such a brilliant, handsome, and\r\nnoble manner to show their feeling for Germany and their gratitude to\r\nthe old hero. As his grandson, this has pleased me greatly and has\r\nstirred me deeply.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I cannot forbear to emphasize the truly overwhelming\r\nreception which was accorded me here by great and small, young and old,\r\nhigh and low. The many thousand faces which lighted toward me to-day\r\ngave evidence that the greeting came from the heart and from feelings\r\nwhich were deeply moved, and I beg the senate and the citizens to\r\naccept my heartiest, sincerest, and warmest thanks and to communicate\r\nthem to the city.\r\n\r\nIndeed, for the younger generation which stood with us about the bronze\r\nportrait to-day the great Emperor is already a historical personage,\r\nand the events which weave themselves about his person and the time in\r\nwhich he worked are already described in history.\r\n\r\nI believe that I am not presuming if I prophesy that some time in\r\nfuture centuries the awe-inspiring figure of my grandfather will stand\r\nforth before the German people, surrounded by at least as many legends\r\nand as powerful and as conspicuous for all time as once the figure of\r\nthe Emperor Barbarossa was. Truly, the younger generation is accustomed\r\nto look upon what we call the empire, together with what it has brought\r\nus, without thinking what it has cost to arrive at this point.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe we recognize the hand of Providence when we look upon\r\nthat awe-inspiring figure which stands yonder in its peaceful attitude\r\nbefore the Rathaus, with its earnestness and its silent tranquillity\r\nof old age. It was precisely, this man whom Providence sought out to\r\naccomplish this hardest of all tasks--the uniting of the German races.\r\nFor no one could resist the charm of the personality, the simple\r\nmodesty, the winning lovableness of the lofty ruler; and so it was\r\npermitted to him, surrounded by his powerful paladins who were devoted\r\nto him and who worked with him, to smooth the way and reconcile the\r\ndifferences; while he kept ever before his eyes the goal, the union of\r\nthe Fatherland. During a long time of peace, in quiet work his thoughts\r\nripened and the plans of the already gray-haired man were ready when\r\nthe mighty task came to him of once more reviving the empire. I hope\r\nthat the youth of Hamburg, when they pass this monument, will never\r\nforget the time of preparation through which this noble ruler lived.\r\n\r\nWith justice you speak of the time of Emperor William as great and\r\npowerful--powerful in its impulses, mighty in its flaming enthusiasm.\r\nGentlemen, I think that our time is also great. The tasks which were\r\nassigned to the great Emperor have been accomplished; yet when things\r\nfor a while seem dark and the tasks which are assigned us seem too\r\nhard we must not forget what that noble ruler endured. Let us not\r\nforget that he lived through and remembered Jena and Tilsit, and that,\r\nnevertheless, he never despaired of the future of the Fatherland. From\r\nTilsit we travelled to Versailles!\r\n\r\nAnd even so is it destined to be in the future; there remain tasks for\r\nour time also. The great Emperor with his great aides has laid the\r\nbasis, the corner-stone of the building; it is for us to build upon\r\nit! Therefore it is my opinion and firm conviction that a great future\r\nawaits us also, if we are but determined to make it so. Tasks are\r\nassigned to us, and, whether they are light or heavy, we must face them\r\nas well as we are able and enlist all our strength. Then we shall be\r\nable to accomplish them and I am convinced that now as then the German\r\nEmpire and the German people will never lack the right sort of men.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I turn to-day to that place where formerly from the\r\ndepths of my heart I issued an earnest appeal to the German people;\r\nand I repeat again to-day: \"May it remain true to its ideals and to\r\nitself!\" Then, as the block of granite yonder bears the great Emperor,\r\nso will the German people, true to their traditions, bear upon their\r\nhearts and discharge with their strength the new tasks and undertakings\r\nwhich come to them. May they enter with decision upon the work which\r\nHeaven assigns them without asking whether it be easy or difficult,\r\nwithout worrying as to how they shall accomplish it, provided only they\r\nare going forward!\r\n\r\nRaise your eyes! Lift up your heads! Look to the heights, bend your\r\nknee before the Great Ally, who has never forsaken the Germans,\r\nand who, if he has at times allowed them to be sorely tried and\r\ndiscouraged, has again raised them from the dust. Put your hand on\r\nyour heart, direct your gaze into the distance, and from time to time\r\ngive a backward glance for memory to the old Emperor and his time,\r\nand I am convinced that, as Hamburg is progressing in the world, so\r\nwill our Fatherland progress along the road of enlightenment, the road\r\nof improvement, the road of practical Christianity: a blessing for\r\nmankind, a bulwark of peace, the wonder of all countries!\r\n\r\nI give this as my firm hope and conviction, and to this wish I empty my\r\nglass: Long life to the city of Hamburg!--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REASONS FOR JAPAN'S VICTORY\r\n\r\nMARCH 9, 1905\r\n\r\n    It will have been noted that the Emperor usually addresses his\r\n    recruits in very simple language. On the occasion of administering\r\n    the oath to the naval recruits at Wilhelmshaven, he was concerned\r\n    about explaining to them the reasons for the Japanese victory, for\r\n    he had repeatedly told them that only a good Christian can be a\r\n    good soldier.\r\n\r\n    The speech was reported through a letter of one of the recruits.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor spoke, among other things, of the heroic deeds of the\r\nJapanese and explained that they had sprung from the Japanese love\r\nof country and children, which had begotten a splendid manliness in\r\nthe army and navy. He said that we must not conclude, however, from\r\nthe Japanese victories--the victories of a heathen over a Christian\r\npeople--that Buddha was superior to our Lord Christ. If Russia was\r\nbeaten, it was due for the most part, according to his opinion, to the\r\nfact that Christianity in Russia was in a pretty bad way; and then,\r\ntoo, there were many Christian virtues among the Japanese. A good\r\nChristian is synonymous with a good soldier!\r\n\r\nBut Christianity is poorly off among the Germans also, and he--the\r\nEmperor--doubted whether we Germans in case of a war would have any\r\nspecial right to pray God for victory, to wrest it from Him in prayer\r\nas Jacob did in his struggle with the angel. The Japanese were the\r\nscourge of God just as once Attila and Napoleon were.\r\n\r\nAnd so we must take care lest God should have to chastise us with such\r\na scourge, etc. The Emperor spoke very earnestly but very impressively\r\nand simply, so that he could be understood by every one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALT OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\nBREMEN, MARCH 22, 1905\r\n\r\n    The following address was delivered at the Rathaus in Bremen on the\r\n    occasion of the dedication of the monument to Emperor Frederick\r\n    III. The Emperor here presents his views on the mission of Germany\r\n    in much the same spirit in which it is expounded in a number of\r\n    his addresses of this time. He has become increasingly conscious\r\n    of her \"manifest destiny\" in the decade which had passed after the\r\n    celebrations of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Franco-Prussian\r\n    War. Germany had entered upon a period of great prosperity and had\r\n    begun to possess the sense of latent power. The Emperor gives us\r\n    here the purely historical reasons which have led him to refrain\r\n    from pretensions to world-dominion. It is significant that his\r\n    next address will be delivered at Morocco. The question naturally\r\n    arises, what hopes or aspirations were in the minds of the audience\r\n    before whom the Emperor made this _gran rifiuto_. It was in a time\r\n    of insistent agitation by the Navy League and the Colonial party.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY HONORED BURGOMASTER:\r\n\r\nWill you allow me first, with a heart deeply moved, to perform the duty\r\nof a son and thank you sincerely for having transmitted to me the wish\r\nof your countrymen that I should participate in this festive day and be\r\npresent at the unveiling of the unique and splendid statue which the\r\nfree Hanseatic city of Bremen has erected to my father?\r\n\r\nI can assure you that it stirred me deeply to-day as my eye wandered\r\nover the masses of people to think that the former Prussian Crown\r\nPrince, subsequently the first Crown Prince of the German Empire, and,\r\nfinally, second Hohenzollern Emperor, should be fêted in a free German\r\ncity just as though this were his home. It is a proof that his figure,\r\nas well as that of his great and illustrious father, has become a\r\ncommon possession of the entire German people.\r\n\r\nI sincerely thank the city of Bremen that it has honored my father\r\nand his memory in such a magnificent manner. You have created a work\r\nof art, the like of which is not often seen in German lands. And I am\r\nconvinced that in later generations his powerful personality, which\r\nwill have become surrounded by the glamour of legend, will through this\r\nstatue be brought nearer to the hearts of the people. And I am sure\r\nthat the generations of Bremen which are to follow, from father to son,\r\nwill never forget the second Emperor, whose noble Siegfried figure led\r\nthe German army to victory and whom we have to thank for our unity.\r\n\r\nAnd so, now, beautiful statues of both my father and my grandfather\r\nstand in this loyal German city and furnish mile-stones for the history\r\nof our Fatherland as well as for the city of Bremen.\r\n\r\nTruly, the historical retrospect which you have been good enough to\r\npresent us shows magnificently the leadership of God and the grace\r\nwhich Providence has bestowed upon our people and our country. The\r\nportion of time which is represented by both of these two noble leaders\r\nwho stand here in bronze has, like a foundation-stone, been firmly laid\r\nin history. It remains for later times and their generations to build\r\nupon the foundation which these great rulers have set down.\r\n\r\nYou have had the goodness to express the thoughts which stirred you\r\nupon a former occasion in this same place. They correspond entirely\r\nto what I myself thought at that time. When, as a lad, I stood before\r\nthe model of the Brommy[40] ship, I bitterly felt the disgrace which\r\nour fleet and our flag had been forced to suffer. And perhaps, since\r\non my mother's side a bit of sea blood flowed into my veins, this was\r\nthe thing which was to give me my cue for the manner in which I would\r\nenvisage the tasks which henceforth were to confront the empire.\r\n\r\n[40] Bromme (called also Brommy) was a German seaman who served in\r\n     the Greek navy and who was later placed in charge of the Naval\r\n     Commission by the German National Assembly in 1848. He organized\r\n     the first modern German fleet and as admiral drove off the three\r\n     Danish ships blockading the Weser. This navy was considered merely\r\n     a passing necessity, and in 1853 Bromme was retired, after the\r\n     little fleet had been sold at auction.\r\n\r\nI swore to the colors when I came to the throne, after the mighty time\r\nof my grandfather, that, so far as in me lay, the bayonet and cannon\r\nwould have to rest, but that bayonet and cannon, however, would have\r\nto be kept sharp and effective in order that jealousy and envy from\r\nwithout should not disturb us in the development of our garden and\r\nour beautiful house. I have made a vow, as a result of what I have\r\nlearned from history, never to strive for an empty world-dominion. For\r\nwhat has become of the so-called world-empires? Alexander the Great,\r\nNapoleon I--all the great warriors--have swum in blood and have left\r\nsubjugated peoples behind them who at the first opportunity have risen\r\nup again and brought the empire to ruin.\r\n\r\nThe world-empire of which I have dreamed shall consist in this, that\r\nthe newly created German Empire shall first of all enjoy on all sides\r\nthe most absolute confidence as a quiet, honorable, and peaceful\r\nneighbor; and that, if in the future they shall read in history of a\r\nGerman world-empire or of a Hohenzollern world-ruler, it shall not\r\nbe founded upon acquisitions won with the sword but upon the mutual\r\ntrust of the nations who are striving for the same goals. To express\r\nit briefly, as a great poet has said: \"Limited outwardly, but with no\r\nlimits upon inward development.\"\r\n\r\nYou have mentioned the ships which here hang memorially from the\r\nceiling of this beautiful old hall. The time in which I grew up was, in\r\nspite of the great war, not a great and glorious one for the seafaring\r\npart of our nation. I, too, have here drawn the logical conclusions\r\nfrom what my ancestors have done. In a military way much had been done\r\nwithin, as was necessary; now the equipment of the navy had to be\r\nbrought forward.\r\n\r\nI thank God that I do not have to make a desperate appeal here in this\r\ntown hall as I once did in Hamburg.[41] The fleet is built and is on\r\nthe seas; we have material for crews. The eagerness and the spirit are\r\nthe same as those which filled the officers of the Prussian army at\r\nHohenfriedberg, at Königgrätz, and at Sedan; and every German war-ship\r\nwhich leaves the slips is one more guarantee for peace on land. We are\r\ncorrespondingly more powerful as allies, and our opponents will be\r\ncorrespondingly less willing to offer us any aggression.\r\n\r\n[41] The appeal referred to is the speech delivered at Hamburg on\r\n     October 18, 1899, with its famous \"Bitterly do we need a powerful\r\n     fleet.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, as I scanned the citizens of Bremen, I saw the old and the\r\nyoung standing next each other--the old with their medals and their\r\ncrosses, comrades in battle and in deeds under both the great leaders\r\nwhose statues stand in this city, and before them stand the youth who\r\nshall grow up to the new empire and its tasks.\r\n\r\nWhat will these tasks be? To develop steadily; to shun strife, hate,\r\ndivision, and jealousy; to rejoice in the German Fatherland as it is\r\nand not to strive after the impossible; to hold fast to the conviction\r\nthat our God would never have taken such great pains with our German\r\nFatherland and its people if he had not been preparing us for something\r\nstill greater.\r\n\r\nWe are the salt of the earth, but we must also be worthy to be so.\r\nTherefore must our youth learn to give up and deny themselves what\r\nis not good for them, to put far from them the things which have\r\nslipped in from foreign peoples, and to preserve their morals, good\r\nconduct, reverence, and religion. Then some day may we write over\r\nthe German people the motto on the helmet of the 1st Regiment of my\r\nguard: \"_Semper talis_\"--\"Ever the Same.\" Then we shall be looked upon\r\nfrom all sides with respect and in a measure with love as a safe and\r\ntrustworthy people and can stand with our hand on our sword-hilt and\r\nwith our shield grounded before us and say: \"_Tamen_, come what will.\"\r\n\r\nI am sure that my words will fall upon good ground here in Bremen.\r\nEarnestly I hope that the golden peace which up to the present with\r\nGod's help we have maintained we may preserve still further and that\r\nunder this peace Bremen may grow green, may bloom, and prosper. That is\r\nmy innermost wish. Long life to Bremen--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nON THE EVE OF MOROCCO\r\n\r\nMARCH 31, 1905--NOVEMBER 17, 1906\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOROCCO QUESTION\r\n\r\nTANGIER, MARCH 31, 1905\r\n\r\n    On the 8th of April, 1904, an _entente_ which had settled all\r\n    outstanding questions between France and Great Britain and gave\r\n    to Great Britain a free hand in Egypt and to France a free hand\r\n    in Morocco was formally signed in London. The German Government\r\n    officially declared that the settlement between France and Great\r\n    Britain concerned only these two countries; but the Pan-German\r\n    Society, the Colonial Society, and the Navy League began so\r\n    insistent an agitation that the government changed its attitude\r\n    and the Emperor here declares in no uncertain terms that what\r\n    Germany undertakes in Morocco will be done exclusively with the\r\n    \"_sovereign_ Sultan.\" Germany was evidently picking a quarrel with\r\n    France over Morocco, with or without warrant, as the case may\r\n    be, and was trying to ascertain, it is generally believed, the\r\n    closeness of the relationship between France and Great Britain.\r\n    The large commercial interests of which the Emperor speaks were\r\n    fairly negligible; though he doubtless had the right to protect it,\r\n    Germany's yearly trade there did not amount to as much as that of\r\n    an ordinary department store or of a fairly successful merchant.\r\n    For the previous eight years it averaged less than half a million\r\n    dollars annually. Her course here has usually been regarded as\r\n    unnecessarily belligerent.\r\n\r\n    True to his policy of personal diplomacy, the Emperor suddenly\r\n    appeared at Tangier and while there made his speech to the German\r\n    colony.\r\n\r\n    The whole question was taken up at the conference of Algeciras\r\n    in 1906. Although the policy of \"the open door,\" which protected\r\n    Germany's commercial interests was guaranteed, the very general\r\n    storm of protest in Germany, especially on the part of the war\r\n    party and Navy League, showed that she had entered the contest with\r\n    more serious intentions. World policy by aggressive interference\r\n    had already been initiated when, in the Spanish-American War,\r\n    the German Admiral Diedrichs started to hamper the operations of\r\n    the American fleet at Manila. Morocco was looked upon by some,\r\n    Doctor Liman, for instance, as a second defeat. In the Algeciras\r\n    conference Italy sided with France and England. Italy had been\r\n    continuing as a member of the Triple Alliance partly through fear\r\n    that the French would annex Tripoli, which Italy desired. England\r\n    and France had now privately agreed to give Italy a free hand. She\r\n    sided with them and it was evident that her vital interests in the\r\n    Triple Alliance had been considerably lessened. As England and\r\n    Russia were also settling all their Eastern points of difference,\r\n    Germany began to be conscious of her isolation, which had been\r\n    largely a result of her attitude and unfortunate diplomacy.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to make the acquaintance of the pioneers of Germany in\r\nMorocco and to be able to tell them that they have done their duty.\r\n\r\nGermany has great commercial interests here. I shall advance and\r\nprotect our commerce, which shows a satisfying increase, and for that\r\nreason shall insist upon equal rights with all powers, which is only\r\npossible through the sovereignty of the Sultan and the independence of\r\nthe country. For Germany both of these must be unquestioned, and I am,\r\ntherefore, ready to intervene for them at all times.\r\n\r\nI hope that my visit in Tangier declares this plainly and emphatically\r\nand that it will call forth the conviction that what Germany undertakes\r\nin Morocco will be negotiated exclusively with the sovereign Sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ALLY\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 8, 1906\r\n\r\n    On this date the Emperor and his four sons dedicated a monument\r\n    to Frederick the Great on the site of his famous bivouac at\r\n    Bunzelwitz. In the evening he addressed a banquet in Breslau, in\r\n    which he took up especially the services of the Silesians to the\r\n    crown. He particularly recalls the support they gave Frederick\r\n    William III in 1813, at the lowest ebb of that King's fortunes.\r\n    Divisions of patriotic volunteers, \"free corps,\" were organized\r\n    in the province, who, not being Prussians, could not serve in the\r\n    Prussian line. The best known of these was that of Lützow, to which\r\n    the poet Theodor Körner belonged. It is from one of his most famous\r\n    war-songs that the quotation in the Emperor's speech is taken. The\r\n    manner in which he speaks of the coronation of his grandfather\r\n    \"by the will of Heaven\" and with no mention of the Constitution,\r\n    is to be found in several of his speeches, notably the address at\r\n    Königsberg (August 25, 1910). Most of these speeches were made in\r\n    his hereditary provinces, Prussia, Silesia, and Brandenburg, and\r\n    aroused considerable protest in other parts of Germany.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nWith a heart deeply moved, I take the opportunity to-day to speak as\r\nsovereign Duke of Silesia to my Silesians, for the impressions which\r\nhave been showered upon me during the short time that I have been among\r\nyou are of so powerful and compelling a nature that words fail me to\r\nexpress them or to find the proper form for the thanks which I would\r\nlike to communicate to my people of Silesia. I do not refer only to\r\nyesterday's demonstrations, which surpassed, if that were possible,\r\nthe jubilations on the day of my entrance. And I do not mean only those\r\non the part of the old soldiers in black uniforms with their military\r\ndecorations on their breasts, who can say, \"We have been present at\r\nthe time when history was made,\" and who dare pride themselves on\r\nhaving been fellows in arms of the great Emperor and his noble son, my\r\nfather, whose heart, as is known to all of you, beat high for Silesia,\r\nbut I mean to-day, on my journey through the green Silesian country to\r\nBunzelwitz, Schweidnitz, and Rogau and back--everywhere I have found\r\nthe same warmth, the same glowing, burning enthusiasm. It is the old\r\nSilesian loyalty which breaks forth and which proves the appreciation\r\non the part of the people for what the house of Hohenzollern has done\r\nfor them. This loyalty is rooted in ground specially consecrated\r\nby history. For who will deny that the province of Silesia, almost\r\nmore than any other, stands in closest union with the history of\r\nour Fatherland and of our house? And, especially, how could any one\r\nspeak of the development of Silesia without first thinking of the one\r\npowerful figure of whom the grenadiers sang from the Rhine to the\r\nOder: \"Fredericus Rex, our King and leader\"? Wherever we look over\r\nthe plains of Silesia rise the memories of him, of the incomparable\r\nbattles through which he made Prussia a world-power, and also of the\r\nsplendid work of peace in which he sought to raise and strengthen the\r\nsorely oppressed country. And again in later times it was precisely to\r\nSilesia that it was reserved to send a new ray of hope to that sorely\r\ntried Hohenzollern King, Frederick William III, when he encountered the\r\nardent enthusiasm of the first volunteers in Breslau, when the first\r\nraising of troops took place here, and when the \"wild, dashing Lützow\r\nhunters\" started in their career against the enemy at the Zobten. And\r\nso it has been ever since. The sons of Silesia have fought whenever it\r\nwas a question of coming forward and sacrificing their blood for the\r\nFatherland. And so it may be very well said that the history of our\r\nhouse is indissolubly bound up with that of Silesia, one of her most\r\nbeautiful provinces. And when we glance back over this great history we\r\ncan characterize it with the phrase which my great departed grandfather\r\nused when, after fierce conflicts, through the will of Heaven the\r\nimperial crown was set upon his brow: \"God was with us, and His be the\r\nhonor!\" And when I stop to think how the flags of the veterans passed\r\nme with proud bearing I believe that we can apply this to the present\r\nand thank God that He has disposed everything for the good and profit\r\nof this province and of our house; above all, for the fact that it has\r\nbeen granted us to carry out our work in peace. But if God was with\r\nus we ought earnestly to ask the question whether we were worthy of\r\nHis help. Has every one among us also done his part by offering up his\r\nthought, his health, and strength to carry on and develop the legacy\r\nwhich was bequeathed to us by the past? If every one with his hand\r\nupon his heart asks himself this question sincerely, many a man will\r\nfind it difficult to answer. And then, gentlemen, let us draw a lesson\r\nfrom the personality of the great King and decide where it was that we\r\nhave failed in the work, where we have allowed our spirits to flag,\r\nand where dark thoughts and fears have bewildered our minds. Away with\r\nthem! And just as the great King was never left in the lurch by the\r\nold Ally, so our Fatherland and this beautiful province will always be\r\nnear His heart. And so out of the beautiful circle of memories and of\r\ngolden loyalty which I have here encountered, let us coin a new vow:\r\nfrom this time on, through offering up our strength of soul and body,\r\nwe will devote ourselves to the task of urging our country forward,\r\nof working for our people; and every one, according to his position,\r\nwhether high or low, will do this; and the various creeds will unite\r\nto check unbelief; and above all things, for the future, we shall keep\r\nour vision clear and never despair of ourselves or of our people.\r\nThe world belongs to the living, and the living are right. I cannot\r\nendure pessimists, and whoever does not take part in the work let him\r\ndepart and, if he likes, seek out a better country. But I expect from\r\nmy Silesians that they to-day will unite in the decision to be ever\r\nmindful of their great aims and examples, that they will follow their\r\nDuke, especially in his work of peace for his people. In this hope,\r\nI empty my glass to the health of the province of Silesia and of all\r\nfaithful Silesians.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTIMISM AND LITERATURE\r\n\r\nMÜNICH, NOVEMBER 12, 1906\r\n\r\n    One of the men of letters whom the Emperor has been particularly\r\n    delighted to honor and in whom he sees one of the glories of German\r\n    literature is Doctor Ludwig Ganghofer, who is certainly not more\r\n    than an able writer of the second rank. After a performance in the\r\n    _Hoftheater_ in Münich the Emperor expressed the desire to see him,\r\n    and the following conversation took place which was reported in a\r\n    confusing combination of direct and indirect quotation.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor said that he had recently read the \"Hohen Schein\" and\r\nspoke at some length about it, going over the content and thought of\r\nthe book. From the way in which he spoke about it one could see how\r\nintensely he was occupied with one thing in particular.\r\n\r\nWhat pleased him especially in the book was the optimistic tone which\r\npervaded it, the preaching which stimulated belief in life, and the\r\nmanner of accepting the misfortunes of existence, as well as the\r\ntrust in the future and trust in humanity. \"This,\" said the Emperor,\r\n\"makes such an impression upon me because I am an optimist through and\r\nthrough and will allow nothing to prevent me from remaining one to the\r\nend of my days.\" He spoke of himself as a man full of his work and\r\none who believed in his tasks. He said further: \"I will go forward.\r\nI would greatly rejoice if men would understand me and would support\r\nme in my desires.\" In this connection he spoke of the difficulty\r\nevery one encountered in his work on account of distrust. He again\r\nrecalled a passage from Ganghofer's \"Schweigen im Walde\" which had also\r\nespecially appealed to him because it had expressed his own point of\r\nview concerning life. The passage runs: \"He who distrusts, commits a\r\nwrong against another and harms himself. It is our duty to believe that\r\nevery man is good so long as he does not give proof to the contrary.\"\r\n\"On this basis,\" said the Emperor, \"I have always accepted every man\r\nwith whom I had anything to do. One may sometimes meet with unpleasant\r\nexperiences, but on that account he dare not give up. One must always\r\ngo on again with new trust in humanity and in life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then directed the conversation to a tablet which he had\r\nhad made and which contained, besides the above-mentioned quotation,\r\ncertain aphorisms of a like tenor from Ganghofer's novels.\r\n\r\nThese quotations appealed to him so strongly because they expressed\r\nentirely his attitude toward life. With a good bit of optimism and a\r\nbright and trustful outlook a man will go much further, not only in\r\nhis own personal life but in his vocation also, than he will if he\r\nlooks upon all things with a pessimistic eye; and even in politics\r\nthe case is the same. The German people certainly have a future, and\r\nthere is one word, \"_Reichsverdrossenheit_\" [sullenness toward imperial\r\ndestiny], which always offends him as often as he hears it. \"What have\r\nwe to do with sullenness? Rather work and look forward. I work--yes,\r\nnot unwillingly--and I believe that I progress.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with this word, the Emperor described the way in which\r\nhe worked every day and told how the difficulty of the many duties\r\nand tasks which stormed in upon him often made him very weary. It\r\nwas at such times that the need overcame him to get out of harness\r\nand see another part of the world, to become acquainted with other\r\nmen who stimulated him again. Thus, his journeys to the north always\r\ninvigorated him both mentally and physically.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor described earnestly and vividly how such a journey\r\ngradually rested and refreshed him. In the first days there was of\r\ncourse an abundance of work. Telegrams and letters came even to the\r\nboat, and he and those about him could not leave work for long. Then it\r\nbecame gradually more restful and solitary until eventually he found\r\ncomplete rest and could give himself up to the glories of nature.\r\nHe then gave lively descriptions of his journeys, of the special\r\nbeauties of the fjords, and of his impression of the midnight sun. He\r\nspoke especially of his pleasure at the simplicity and the cordiality\r\nof the people, who responded to him so naturally. Everything that\r\noppressed him was cast aside for a few weeks--and yet the pleasures\r\nwhich he received were begrudged him by many people. He knew that he\r\nhad always been called the \"travelling Emperor,\" but he had always\r\ntaken it lightly and had not allowed his pleasure to be spoiled by it.\r\nWe discover friends in travelling, even in our own home. He believed\r\nthat the feeling of interdependence was strengthened in that way and\r\nadded that there were many Germans who did not know how beautiful\r\ntheir own land was and how much there was to be seen in it. He always\r\nrejoiced when he had learned to know a new portion of Germany. The\r\nsouth especially seemed to him beautiful, and he was very much drawn\r\nto it by the manner of life there. He always remembered, he said, with\r\nparticular pleasure a journey which he had made many years before to\r\nBerchtesgaden and the beautiful days which he had been allowed to\r\nspend in the hills behind it with his uncle, the Duke of Coburg. If\r\nonly travelling were not accompanied by so many inconveniences! It was\r\nalways necessary to take along so many paraphernalia. Often he longed\r\nto seat himself in an automobile and go whizzing off for a few days,\r\nto return satisfied and ready to work again. And such refreshment was\r\nnecessary in a serious calling like his own--doubly necessary because\r\nhe had to fight so much misunderstanding; it was a thankless situation,\r\nbecause no one ever gave him credit for being independent. If he\r\nsucceeded in anything, then all the world asked: \"Who advised him?\"\r\nIf he was unsuccessful, then they said: \"He did not understand it.\"\r\n\"What in the cases of other princes is accepted as self-evident becomes\r\nin mine a matter of debate. And, nevertheless, the one answer is:\r\n'Because I wish the good of the German Empire and of the German people.'\r\n\r\n\"Many times also I meet with pleasant experiences--and most often on\r\nthese very journeys which are made such a reproach to me.\" So the days\r\nin Münich would remain an untroubled joy to him which he would never\r\nforget. The warmth and heartiness in the behavior of the population\r\nas well as the beautiful picture, gay with color, of the city in its\r\nartistic decorations had completely charmed him.\r\n\r\nThe conversation then turned upon several questions of literature and\r\npolitics. The Emperor also related some anecdotes concerning his own\r\nfamily, and here the intimacy with which he spoke was particularly\r\nagreeable. He said merely, \"my wife\" and \"my _Buben_\" [boys]. In a\r\nparticularly sincere manner the Emperor spoke of our regents, whose\r\nenergy and self-sacrifice in such trying days he lauded, and expressed\r\nthe wish that the Great Prince might preserve us all for a long time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF LABOR LEGISLATION\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 17, 1906\r\n\r\n    The policy of introducing legislation in the interest of the\r\n    laboring classes may be said to have been inaugurated by Emperor\r\n    William I in 1881. If one of its aims was to alleviate the\r\n    condition of this class and to promote the welfare of Germany\r\n    generally, another and perhaps its most important aim in Bismarck's\r\n    eyes was to stem the growth of the Social Democratic party and\r\n    bring about a greater sense of solidarity within the empire. In\r\n    this latter aim of \"taking the wind out of the sails\" of the\r\n    Social Democratic party it had not proved successful at the time\r\n    of the accession of William II. He began his reign with the idea\r\n    of making still further concessions and on this point broke\r\n    with Bismarck. When these again failed to conciliate the Social\r\n    Democrats, he took measures to legislate against them. He declared,\r\n    as we have seen, on one occasion: \"For me, every Social Democrat\r\n    is synonymous with enemy of the nation and of the Fatherland.\"\r\n    (May 14, 1889.) The fact that the party has continued to increase\r\n    has always been a thorn in his side, and his attitude has been\r\n    more or less contradictory with regard to the working classes; so\r\n    that occasionally, as here, he seems to attempt to threaten and\r\n    conciliate at the same time.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago to-day the late Emperor and King, William the\r\nGreat, made his memorable announcement, and I welcome the opportunity\r\nof calling to mind with reverent gratitude this work of peace through\r\nwhich my noble ancestor inaugurated new lines of legislation for\r\nthe protection of the economically weak. In obedience to his lofty\r\nwill, with the hearty approval of the allied governments and the\r\nintelligent co-operation of the Reichstag, we succeeded in so advancing\r\nthe difficult and multifarious development of the state's labor\r\nlegislation, in the domain of sick, accident, and disability insurance,\r\nthat those deserving help in their day of need now possess a regularly\r\nconstituted legal claim. Thanks to the comprehensive acts of the\r\nrealm and of the employers as well as to their own contributions, the\r\nlaborers have hereby attained a much higher degree of security with\r\nregard to their means of livelihood and the support of their families.\r\nBut the great and fruitful ideas in the imperial message have not\r\nonly inaugurated this condition in our own Fatherland but have served\r\nas an epoch-making example far beyond her borders. Unfortunately,\r\nthrough lasting opposition in the very quarter which believes that it\r\nhas a right to represent the interests of labor the fulfilment of the\r\nhighest aims of the imperial message is being checked and delayed.\r\nNevertheless, I believe that a recognition of what has been done and a\r\ngrowing realization of the limits of the economically possible will in\r\nall circles of the German people bring about its final triumph. Then\r\nthe hope of Emperor William that the laboring man's insurance would be\r\na lasting pledge of internal peace for the Fatherland will have been\r\nfulfilled. With this in mind, it is my firm will that legislation in\r\nthe domain of social and political provisions should not cease, but\r\nthat it should be carried out toward the fulfilling of the highest\r\nChristian duty with regard to the protection and the welfare of the\r\nweak and needy. But the task proposed by the spirit of the imperial\r\nmessage and its lofty framer cannot be carried out through merely legal\r\nacts and provisions. I gladly recognize to-day that in the German\r\npeople there has never been a lack of men and women who willingly and\r\njoyfully gave up their strength in loving service for the good of\r\ntheir neighbor; and to all of those who devote themselves in unselfish\r\nsacrifice to the great social work of our time I express my imperial\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nI commission you to bring this decree to general notice.\r\n\r\nIssued to the Imperial Chancellor, Donaueschingen, November 17, 1906.\r\n\r\n                                                    WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS OF 1907\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 5, 1907--OCTOBER 18, 1911\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIALISM VERSUS SOCIAL DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nBERLIN, FEBRUARY 5, 1907\r\n\r\n    A number of scandals in army and colonial administration had been\r\n    exposed in 1906. It will be remembered that for years back the\r\n    Emperor had been insisting on union between the various religious\r\n    creeds. This was perhaps due in part to a spirit of toleration,\r\n    but to a larger extent it was due to the fact that the Centre\r\n    party (Catholic) had for a number of years been in control. The\r\n    Reichstag of 1906 was dissolved, ostensibly over the government's\r\n    quarrel with the Centre party over the comparatively paltry sum of\r\n    $2,000,000 demanded for the Southwest African colony. In reality\r\n    the causes probably lay deeper. The late Reichstag had voted an\r\n    insufficient sum for the navy and was beginning to object to the\r\n    increasing taxes on the necessities of life. The Navy League was\r\n    demanding a doubling of the German fleet. The government seemed to\r\n    wish to undertake a more rapid policy of expansion. Mr. Barker\r\n    is authority for the statement that leaders of the imperialistic\r\n    agitation had gone so far as to recommend that if the Reichstag\r\n    did not vote the credits necessary for doubling the fleet, a _coup\r\n    d'état_ should be effected by the government and that it should\r\n    levy the taxes and govern in case of necessity against the will of\r\n    the Reichstag or without the Reichstag. The expansionist policy was\r\n    strongly advocated by the Colonial party and the Navy League and\r\n    was championed by the Chancellor. As the Social Democrats opposed\r\n    increases in taxation, they were likewise now specially under the\r\n    ban of official disapproval. There are usually about forty parties\r\n    in the Reichstag. The issue was, therefore, clearly drawn between\r\n    a policy of imperialism and a stronger insistence on world-policy,\r\n    on the one hand, and Social Democracy and the opposition on the\r\n    other. The Emperor and the Chancellor, particularly the latter,\r\n    threw themselves vigorously into the campaign, and in spite\r\n    of the support of the Centre party the Social Democrats lost\r\n    thirty-six representatives and their representation was reduced to\r\n    forty-three. Although the Social Democrats have to a certain point\r\n    supported the policy of commercial expansion, their defeat here may\r\n    be looked upon as the unconditioned triumph of imperialism.\r\n\r\n    On the night of February 5, when it was announced that the Social\r\n    Democrats had been defeated, a crowd gathered about the palace, and\r\n    when the Emperor returned at about midnight from the meeting of the\r\n    Electrical Society, where he had delivered an address, he stepped\r\n    out on his balcony and made the following speech to the crowd:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nWith my whole heart I thank you for the beautiful demonstration of\r\nhomage which you have shown me. It arises from the feeling that you are\r\nproud to have done your duty toward the Fatherland; in the phrase of\r\nour Chancellor, you are able to ride, and you will ride down everything\r\nthat opposes us if all conditions and creeds stand together in firm\r\nunion. Do not allow this hour of celebration to end like a passing\r\nwave of patriotic enthusiasm, but stand firmly to the path on which\r\nyou have started. I close with the words of the great poet Kleist in\r\nhis \"Prince von Homburg\" when old Kottwitz speaks to the Great Elector\r\nsomewhat as follows: \"What do we care for the rules according to which\r\nthe enemy fights if he is beaten in the fighting? We have now learned\r\nthe art of conquering him and are filled with the desire to practise it\r\nfurther.\"[42]\r\n\r\n[42] The exact passage runs as follows, though the lines are separated\r\n     in the play and do not occur in this order:\r\n\r\n          \"What, I pray you, do you care for the rule\r\n          According to which the enemy fights, if only\r\n          He goes down before you with all his flags?\r\n          The rule that conquers him is the highest rule.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  ACT V, SCENE 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY OF FAITH\r\n\r\nMÜNSTER, AUGUST 31, 1907\r\n\r\n    The following address of a general character, which represents the\r\n    Emperor's faith in God and in Germany, was delivered at a banquet\r\n    in the Westphalian Provincial Museum. It is somewhat similar in its\r\n    general attitude to the one delivered about a month later at the\r\n    unveiling of the national monument at Memel.\r\n\r\nI wish to express to the representatives of the province whom I have\r\ngathered about me to-day my warmest thanks for the way in which I have\r\neverywhere been received in this beautiful country of Westphalia.\r\nI would also like to repeat to you in the name of her Majesty, the\r\nEmpress and Queen, how disconsolate she is that it was unfortunately\r\nnot possible for her to celebrate the Westphalian days with you and to\r\ncome into personal contact with the Westphalian people.\r\n\r\nThe province of Westphalia offers an attractive picture of a state in\r\nwhich it has been proved possible to reconcile historical, religious,\r\nand industrial differences through love and loyalty for a common\r\nFatherland. The province is made up of several districts, of which\r\nmany have for a long time belonged to the crown of Prussia, while\r\nmany others have been but recently acquired. They, however, vie with\r\none another in their loyalty to our house. As I make no difference\r\nbetween old and new districts, so I also make no difference between\r\nthe adherents to the Catholic and the Protestant creeds. Let them both\r\nstand upon the foundation of Christianity and they are both bound to\r\nbe true citizens and obedient subjects. All the children of my country\r\nstand equally near to my heart, which is devoted to the Fatherland. In\r\nits industrial relations the province also offers a highly edifying\r\nexample. It shows that the great branches of industry do not need to\r\nharm each other and that the welfare of the one works for the good of\r\nthe others also. The farmer diligently cultivates his red Westphalian\r\nsoil, holding fast to the traditions which have come down to him\r\nfrom ages past; a sturdy character, with unyielding energy and lofty\r\npurpose, of loyal nature, a firm foundation for our state. Therefore,\r\nthe protection of agriculture lies especially near my thoughts. Your\r\ncitizen brings his cities ever nearer to perfection; there are works\r\nfor the benefit of the public--museums and collections, hospitals and\r\nchurches. And deep in your mountains lie hidden the treasures which,\r\nmined by the diligent hands of the brave mountain people, give to\r\nindustry the opportunity to develop itself--that industry, the pride of\r\nthe nation, wonderful in its progress, the envy of all the world. May\r\nit be permitted to gather together further treasures for our national\r\nwealth and to increase abroad the good reputation of the thoroughness\r\nand excellence of German work.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I am mindful also of those laborers who, in these\r\nvast industrial undertakings, tend the great blast-furnaces and of\r\nthose who, far from the daylight, accomplish their work with steady\r\nhands in the leads of the mines. Consideration for them, for their\r\nprosperity and their welfare I have taken over as a precious heritage\r\nfrom my late grandfather, and it is my wish and my will, in the\r\nprovince of such social regulations, to hold fast to the principles\r\nlaid down in the memorable message of Emperor William the Great.\r\n\r\nThe lovely picture of unity which the province of Westphalia presents\r\nto the observer I would gladly see made general over our entire\r\nFatherland. I believe that for such a unity of all our citizens, of\r\nall our conditions, only one means is possible, and that is religion.\r\nNot, indeed, understood in the sense of strict theological doctrine,\r\nbut in the broader sense, practical for daily life. I must here go back\r\nto my own experience. In the long period of my reign--it is now the\r\ntwentieth year since I came to the throne--I have had to do with many\r\nmen and I have had to endure much from them; many times unconsciously,\r\nand unfortunately many times consciously, they have hurt me grievously.\r\nAnd if at such moments I have been in danger of losing my temper and\r\nthoughts of revenge have arisen, I have asked myself what were the\r\nmeans best fitted to temper anger and increase moderation. The only\r\none which I have found is to say to myself: \"All men are like you,\r\nand, although they do you harm, they bear a soul born in the realms\r\nof light above, to which we all wish to return, and through their\r\nsouls they have a part of the Creator within them.\" Whoever thinks\r\nin this way will judge his fellow men mildly. If this idea of mutual\r\nforbearance could only be spread among the German people, then the\r\nfirst condition for a complete unity would be established. This can\r\nonly be accomplished if we tend toward one central ideal--the person of\r\nour Redeemer, the Man who called us brothers, who lived as an example\r\nfor all of us--the most personal of all personalities. He still wanders\r\namong the people, and we are all conscious of Him in our hearts. In\r\nlooking up to Him our people must find their union, and they must build\r\nfirmly upon His words, concerning which He Himself has said: \"Heaven\r\nand earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.\" If they\r\ndo that, then they will succeed. To such co-operation I should like\r\nto-day to invite especially the men of Westphalia. For, as I have\r\nbefore explained, in their province they have understood how to present\r\nthat charming spectacle of differences reconciled. They will also\r\nunderstand me first and best. In this spirit let old and new districts,\r\ncitizens, farmers, and laborers hold together and unitedly work\r\ntogether through loyalty and love for the Fatherland. Then the German\r\npeople will be the rock of granite upon which our Lord God can build\r\nand complete his work of culture in the world. Then will the words of\r\nthe poet be fulfilled when he says: \"In contact with German life, the\r\nworld will grow well again.\" To whosoever is ready to offer me his\r\nhand on this I shall be most grateful and I will accept it joyfully,\r\nno matter who or of what condition he may be. I believed that I would\r\nbe most quickly understood by the Westphalians, and therefore I have\r\nturned to them.\r\n\r\nI now raise my glass with the wish that God's blessing may rest upon\r\nthe red Westphalian earth and upon all its people, that I may be\r\npermitted still longer to maintain peace in order that they may follow\r\ntheir calling undisturbed. God bless Westphalia! The province of\r\nWestphalia--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH JOURNALISTS\r\n\r\nLONDON, NOVEMBER 16, 1907\r\n\r\n    In November and December, 1907, the Emperor paid a visit to\r\n    England. On this occasion the degree of Doctor of Civil Law was\r\n    conferred upon him by Oxford University. Ever since the Morocco\r\n    incident, in 1905, the feeling between the two countries had been\r\n    somewhat strained and newspapers on both sides of the channel had\r\n    helped to foment discontent. To a group of English journalists who\r\n    had visited Germany during the summer the Emperor gave an audience\r\n    and addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate your greeting. It gives me pleasure to think that\r\nyour visit to Germany during the past summer has been so fruitful and\r\nthat you are satisfied with the welcome accorded you by my countrymen.\r\nThe power which you possess is great and extremely beneficial when it\r\nis used as a means for strengthening the feeling of friendship among\r\nthe peoples. Your address shows that this task lies near to your\r\nhearts. I thank you, therefore, for your appearance here to-day. I\r\nrejoice to have seen you and hope that you will exert your influence\r\nto foster between our two nations the friendly feelings which are so\r\nnecessary to the peace of Europe. We belong to the same race and have\r\nthe same religion. These are bonds which should be strong enough to\r\npreserve harmony and friendship between us.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSACE-LORRAINE\r\n\r\nSTRASBURG, AUGUST 30, 1908\r\n\r\n    The Emperor delivered the following address at a banquet after the\r\n    imperial manoeuvres in Alsace-Lorraine. The general situation in\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine has been discussed in connection with the address\r\n    to the delegates of the _Landesausschuss_ on March 14, 1891.\r\n\r\nI bid you, gentlemen, heartily welcome and express to you the warmest\r\nthanks of the Empress and myself for the beautiful reception through\r\nwhich, here as in Metz, the people of Alsace-Lorraine have given\r\nso telling an expression of their love and loyalty. My heart also\r\nbids me thank you once more for the restoration of the old castle of\r\nHohkönigsburg, especially the people of Lorraine for their patriotic\r\nattitude and the donation of the charming Lorraine Room in the castle.\r\nFor more than thirty-seven years you have now been able to follow\r\nyour different callings in peace, and beautiful Alsace-Lorraine,\r\nkeeping pace with the unexpected development of the German Empire,\r\nhas in this time blossomed forth most joyously. As inhabitants of\r\nthis border-land, you naturally have the greatest interest in the\r\nfurther maintenance of peace, and I rejoice to be able to express to\r\nyou my innermost conviction that the peace of Europe is in no danger.\r\nIt rests upon too firm a foundation to be easily disturbed through\r\ninstigations and slanders aroused in certain quarters by jealousy and\r\nenvy. A solid security of the first rank is afforded by the consciences\r\nof the princes and statesmen of Europe who know themselves responsible\r\nto God and feel for the life and prosperity of the people intrusted to\r\ntheir charge. On the other hand, it is the wish and will of the people\r\nthemselves to make themselves useful in the further development of\r\nthe magnificent acquisitions of their progressive civilization and to\r\nmeasure their strength in peaceful competition. And, finally, peace\r\nwill be secured and protected also through our forces on water and\r\non land--through the German people in arms! Proud of the unequalled\r\ndiscipline and love of honor of her armies, Germany is determined,\r\nwithout threatening others, to carry these to still greater heights and\r\nso to expand as to further her own interests without either favoring\r\nor doing harm to any one. With God's help and under the protection of\r\nthe German eagle, you can therefore follow still further your peaceful\r\ncallings and garner the fruits of your industry. May the blessing of\r\nGod rest upon your work at all times! Long life to the German province\r\nAlsace-Lorraine!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"DAILY TELEGRAPH\" INTERVIEW\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 28, 1908\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the most startling incident in the Emperor's reign and the\r\n    most extraordinary evidence of what may be called his \"personal\r\n    diplomacy\" policy was brought out by the publication of an\r\n    interview in the _Daily Telegraph_ of London. German sympathies\r\n    before and during the Boer War had been strongly pro-Boer. On the\r\n    third of January, 1896, the Emperor had telegraphed to President\r\n    Krüger: \"I beg to express to you my sincere congratulations that,\r\n    without help from foreign powers, you have succeeded with your\r\n    own people and by your own strength in driving out the armed\r\n    bands which attempted to disturb the peace of your country and in\r\n    re-establishing order and in defending the independence of your\r\n    people from attacks from outside.\"\r\n\r\n    The German people had, therefore, assumed that the Emperor shared\r\n    their friendliness toward the Boers and that the government was\r\n    observing a policy of neutrality at least. When they learned\r\n    that his General Staff had been called upon, and that he had\r\n    prepared a plan of campaign against the Boers, a universal shout\r\n    of protest was raised. The publication of this interview, which\r\n    was designed to conciliate England, had a contrary effect upon\r\n    Holland, and the feeling that their ruler was held down by no\r\n    sense of responsibility was borne in forcibly upon the people.\r\n    The matter was made the subject of innumerable controversies,\r\n    debates in the Reichstag, and investigations. It was originally\r\n    announced that the interview had been given to an English diplomat\r\n    who had retired to private life. It was discovered that such was\r\n    not the case. It had been granted to an English journalist who\r\n    had written certain flattering articles about the Emperor. As for\r\n    the text, it was admitted that it was substantially authentic; it\r\n    had been shown to and had practically received the _visé_ of the\r\n    German Foreign Office. The Emperor's Chancellor, however, had not\r\n    seen the interview and under the storm of criticism offered his\r\n    resignation. This the Emperor did not accept, and the Chancellor\r\n    attempted to defend the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Emperor\r\n    withdrew and for a time, like Achilles, pondered in his tent. Even\r\n    the Chancellor had to admit the Emperor's indiscretion and to\r\n    inform his sovereign that it would be impossible to carry out any\r\n    consistent foreign policy if the Emperor did not observe a proper\r\n    reserve in his public and private utterances.\r\n\r\n    Any number of projects were presented in the November debates\r\n    of the Reichstag for changing the Constitution, to bring\r\n    about co-operation between the Reichstag and the Emperor in\r\n    the appointment and dismissal of Chancellors and declarations\r\n    of war, and for introducing a law to bring about ministerial\r\n    responsibility. Nothing came of these, however, and we shall see\r\n    from the Königsberg speech (August 25, 1910) that the chastening\r\n    which the Emperor had received on this occasion had no particularly\r\n    lasting effect. Although both the interview and the telegram are\r\n    undoubtedly authentic (the interview was published in official\r\n    government organs in Germany, like the _Norddeutsche Allgemeine\r\n    Zeitung_, and by the Wolff Bureau), they are not included in any\r\n    official collection of the Emperor's utterances, and Penzler, of\r\n    course, does not print them with the speeches. The interview as\r\n    here given is taken from the account of the London _Times_, of\r\n    October 29, 1908.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, who is stated to have spoken with \"impulsive and unusual\r\nfrankness,\" began by declaring that \"Englishmen, in giving the rein\r\nto suspicions unworthy of a great nation,\" were \"mad as March hares.\"\r\n\"What more can I do,\" he asked, \"than I have done? I declared with all\r\nthe emphasis at my command, in my speech at Guildhall, that my heart is\r\nset upon peace and that it is one of my dearest wishes to live on the\r\nbest of terms with England.\r\n\r\n\"My task is not of the easiest. The prevailing sentiment among large\r\nsections of the middle and lower classes of my own people is not\r\nfriendly to England. I am, therefore, so to speak, in a minority in my\r\nown land, but it is a minority of the best elements, just as it is in\r\nEngland with respect to Germany. That is another reason why I resent\r\nyour refusal to accept my pledged word that I am the friend of England.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer reminded his Majesty that \"not England alone, but the whole\r\nof Europe, had viewed with disapproval the recent action of Germany in\r\nallowing the German consul to return from Tangier to Fez.\" His Majesty\r\nreplied, \"with a gesture of impatience,\" that German subjects in Fez\r\nwere \"crying for help and protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not send him? Are those who charge Germany with having\r\nstolen a march on the other powers aware that the French consular\r\nrepresentative had already been in Fez for several months when Doctor\r\nVassel set out?\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then reverted to \"the subject uppermost in his mind--his\r\nproved friendship for England.\" It was commonly believed in England, he\r\nsaid, that during the South African War Germany had been consistently\r\nhostile to her. German opinion, he admitted, was hostile--\"bitterly\r\nhostile\"; but not so official Germany. In fact, while other European\r\npeoples had received and fêted the Boer delegates who came to solicit\r\nEuropean intervention, he alone had refused to receive them at Berlin,\r\n\"where the German people would have crowned them with flowers.\" His\r\nMajesty continued:\r\n\r\n\"Again, when the struggle was at its height, the German Government\r\nwas invited by the governments of France and Russia to join with them\r\nin calling upon England to put an end to the war. The moment had\r\ncome, they said, not only to save the Boer republics, but also to\r\nhumiliate England to the dust. What was my reply? I said that so far\r\nfrom Germany joining in any concerted European action to put pressure\r\nupon England and bring about her downfall, Germany would always keep\r\naloof from politics that could bring her into complications with a sea\r\npower like England. Posterity will one day read the exact terms of the\r\ntelegram--now in the archives of Windsor Castle--in which I informed\r\nthe sovereign of England of the answer I had returned to the powers\r\nwhich then sought to compass her fall. Englishmen who now insult me by\r\ndoubting my word should know what were my actions in the hour of their\r\nadversity.\"\r\n\r\nThese were not the only proofs which his Majesty had given of sympathy\r\nwith the British cause:\r\n\r\n\"Just at the time of your Black Week, in the December of 1899, when\r\ndisasters followed one another in rapid succession, I received a letter\r\nfrom Queen Victoria, my revered grandmother, written in sorrow and\r\naffliction, and bearing manifest traces of the anxieties which were\r\npreying upon her mind and health. I at once returned a sympathetic\r\nreply. Nay, I did more. I bade one of my officers procure for me as\r\nexact an account as he could obtain of the number of combatants in\r\nSouth Africa on both sides, and of the actual position of the opposing\r\nforces. With the figures before me, I worked out what I considered to\r\nbe the best plan of campaign under the circumstances, and submitted\r\nit to my General Staff for their criticism. Then I despatched it to\r\nEngland, and that document, likewise, is among the state papers at\r\nWindsor Castle, awaiting the serenely impartial verdict of history.\r\nAnd, as a matter of curious coincidence, let me add that the plan which\r\nI formulated ran very much on the same lines as that which was actually\r\nadopted by Lord Roberts and carried by him into successful operation.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, his Majesty dwelt upon the importance to Germany of a\r\npowerful fleet. Germany must be able to protect her growing commerce\r\nand manifold interests \"in even the most distant seas.\" \"Germany,\"\r\nhe went on, \"looks ahead. She must be prepared for any eventualities\r\nin the far East. Who can foresee what may take place in the Pacific\r\nin the days to come?\" Looking to the accomplished rise of Japan and\r\nthe possible national awakening of China, he urged that \"only those\r\npowers which have great navies will be listened to with respect when\r\nthe future of the Pacific comes to be solved,\" and that even England\r\nherself may welcome the existence of a German fleet \"when they speak\r\ntogether on the same side in the great debates of the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND COUNT ZEPPELIN\r\n\r\nMANZELL, NOVEMBER 10, 1908\r\n\r\n    With Prince Fürstenberg the Emperor journeyed from Donaueschingen\r\n    to Manzell in order to be present at a flight of the dirigible\r\n    Z-1. Count Zeppelin received the Emperor and conducted him in a\r\n    motor-boat to the dirigible hangar. Prince Fürstenberg, Admiral\r\n    von Müller, and General von Plessen ascended with the count. The\r\n    Emperor did not make the flight. After the landing of the airship\r\n    he bestowed upon Count Zeppelin the order of the Black Eagle with\r\n    the following words:\r\n\r\nIn my name and in the name of our entire German people I heartily\r\ncongratulate your Excellency on this magnificent work which you have so\r\nwonderfully displayed before me to-day. Our Fatherland can be proud to\r\npossess such a son--the greatest German of the twentieth century--who\r\nthrough his invention has brought us to a new point in the development\r\nof the human race. It is not too much to say that we have to-day lived\r\nthrough one of the greatest moments in the evolution of human culture.\r\nI thank God, with all Germans, that he has considered our people worthy\r\nto name you one of us. Might it be permitted to us all, as it has been\r\nto you, to be able to say with pride in the evening of our life, that\r\nwe had been successful in serving our dear Fatherland so fruitfully!\r\nAs a token of my admiring recognition, which certainly all your guests\r\ngathered here share with the entire German people, I bestow upon you\r\nherewith my high Order of the Black Eagle. [Then followed the investing\r\nby his Majesty and the head marshal, Prince Fürstenberg.] Now allow me,\r\nmy dear count, to bestow unofficially upon you the accolade! [Embraces\r\nhim three times.] His Excellency, Count Zeppelin, the Conqueror of the\r\nAir--Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nREGATTA AT HAMBURG\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, JUNE 22, 1909\r\n\r\n    The Emperor, as an enthusiastic yachtsman, has made it a point\r\n    to be present, as we have seen, at nearly all of the Hamburg\r\n    regattas. As he was this year to visit the Czar in the furtherance\r\n    of his \"personal diplomacy,\" he had already been forced to decline\r\n    their invitation; but finding it possible to attend at the last\r\n    moment, he made all possible speed to arrive at Hamburg, where his\r\n    recently constructed yacht _Meteor_ was to make her first start.\r\n    The banquet, at which the Emperor spoke, took place on board the\r\n    Hamburg-American Liner _Deutschland_.\r\n\r\nYOUR MAGNIFICENCE:\r\n\r\nI pray you accept my most cordial and heartfelt thanks for this\r\nfriendly greeting in the midst of men so well known and sympathetic\r\nto me. It was, indeed, a severe struggle of conscience for me, placed\r\nbetween my duty and my pleasure, to have to give up eventually the\r\npleasure of being the guest of Hamburg. But it goes without saying\r\nthat, as compared with the welfare of the realm, personal wishes must\r\nbe silent, and with a heavy heart I decided, therefore, to send word\r\nthat it would not be possible for me to be your guest and take part\r\nin the series of sports. Happily, however, things arranged themselves\r\nfavorably. That ship which you all know, delivered to me by Vulcan, my\r\nyacht _Hohenzollern_, has again competed with her ancient and renowned\r\nreputation. We hurried and flew through the Baltic, and what the yacht\r\ncould not accomplish the railroad took care of; and so it was possible\r\nfor me to arrive in time for the splendid arrangements for the Hamburg\r\nracing day and, while responding to the wishes of M. S.,[43] at the\r\nsame time to enter again that circle of men and women whom I prize\r\nso highly. It is my duty on the present day to express my deepest\r\ngratitude to the city of Hamburg for her warm and hearty reception,\r\nwhich seems to increase from year to year, if that be possible. I must\r\nalso express my appreciation of the hospitality extended to me in the\r\nhouse of your Magnificence, and also for the beautiful boat which I\r\nhave received from the hands of a Hamburg master of his craft. We have,\r\ntherefore, at last before us the proof for which I have been striving\r\nfor years--that, just as in the building of war-ships and of liners,\r\nso too, in yacht construction, we now stand upon our own feet. It is a\r\nworthy vessel, built with German hands, out of German materials, and\r\nmanned from stem to stern by German men. I hope that before the year is\r\nout she will clip the waves and show herself to advantage in foreign\r\nports. We follow sport here, and not politics; but your Magnificence\r\nhas been good enough to touch upon points which now deeply move all\r\nGerman hearts. I still hope that the sense of collective responsibility\r\nwill, in the hearts of the representatives of our people, be stronger\r\nthan party feeling, for I assume that no one among you wishes to take\r\nupon his shoulders the responsibility of thwarting a reform which is\r\nabsolutely necessary to the Fatherland's internal and external welfare.\r\n[Bravo!] You have followed with interest my journey to the Finnish\r\ncoast, where I was so warmly and hospitably received by his Majesty,\r\nthe Emperor of All the Russias, and by his people. I am pleased to\r\nbe in a position to give you, as representatives of the commercial\r\nand business world, the following interpretation of the significance\r\nof that visit, since you are particularly interested in the peaceful\r\nshaping of the future. His Majesty, the Emperor, and myself have\r\nagreed that our meeting is to be looked upon as an important pledge\r\nof peace. As monarchs we consider ourselves responsible to God for\r\nthe weal and woe of our people, whom we wish to advance as far as\r\npossible along peaceful paths and bring to fullest fruition. All\r\npeoples need peace in order that under its protection they may devote\r\ntheir undisturbed attention to the great cultural problems of their\r\neconomic and commercial development. For this reason we shall strive\r\nas far as lies in our power to work, with the help of God, for the\r\nfurtherance and maintenance of peace. Naturally, in such a time,\r\nsport also can be developed to the fullest degree. I therefore empty\r\nmy glass to the hospitable city of Hamburg and to my colleagues who\r\nare here assembled. Three hurrahs for the city of Hamburg and the\r\nHamburg-American Line! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n[43] Max Schinckel, president of the Racing Club, who had invited the\r\n     Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF THE FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS\r\n\r\nKARLSRUHE, SEPTEMBER 11, 1909\r\n\r\n    The following address was delivered at Karlsruhe by the Emperor\r\n    after his return from Austria in 1909.\r\n\r\nI extend to you my heartiest thanks for the friendly words of welcome\r\nwhich in the name of the citizens of Karlsruhe you have offered me. I\r\nhave so often stopped here at Karlsruhe that I am no longer a stranger\r\namong you. With you I have lived through joyful and sorrowful days.\r\nOn the present day, as you have said, I am here to inspect this\r\nportion of our army. We Germans are a people who rejoice in weapons\r\nand who lightly and joyfully wear our uniforms, because we know that\r\nit preserves the peace for us in which alone our work can prosper.\r\nThe review from which I have just returned showed me the soldierly\r\nsons of Baden, who, commanded by their distinguished sovereign, have\r\ngiven me the deepest satisfaction. As long as there are wars our army\r\nconstitutes the \"_rocher de bronze_\" upon which peace is based. Our\r\narmy serves to protect it and to maintain the position in the world\r\nwhich is rightfully ours. For this purpose also such strenuous days of\r\neffort are devoted to its development. I am convinced that, if need\r\narises, with the help of God and under His protection, it will give\r\na fitting account of itself. I ask you, Herr Burgomaster, to be the\r\ninterpreter of my thanks and of those of her Majesty, the Empress, for\r\nthe splendid and hearty reception which the citizens of Karlsruhe have\r\noffered us.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPEROR BY DIVINE RIGHT\r\n\r\nKÖNIGSBERG, AUGUST 25, 1910\r\n\r\n    It was at Königsberg that the coronation of the Emperor's\r\n    grandfather took place, or rather, it was here that William I\r\n    crowned himself King of Prussia. This express disclaimer of any\r\n    responsibility to the people may be found in several speeches, but\r\n    nowhere was the _ex me mea nata corona_ attitude more forcibly\r\n    expressed than on this occasion. Ordinarily there had been no\r\n    coronations in Prussia, as they were considered a useless expense.\r\n    As the predecessor of Emperor William I had granted the people a\r\n    constitution, William I was evidently going to insist upon his\r\n    prerogative and did so by taking the crown unto himself and making\r\n    his famous statement. His conduct and that of his predecessors has\r\n    been discussed in chapter I.\r\n\r\nMy heart bids me express to the men of this province the pleasure\r\nwhich her Majesty and I feel on finding ourselves again within the\r\nborders of this beautiful country and on having been received with such\r\nenthusiasm by the citizens of our loyal city and of the province. The\r\nsentiment that finds expression now in Königsberg proves that it is\r\nan entirely unique bond which joins the city and the province to our\r\nhouse. And, in fact, if one looks back upon the history of the country\r\nand of the house it becomes evident that great and important portions\r\nare common to both. Here it was that the Great Elector, by his own\r\nright, created himself the sovereign Duke in Prussia; here his son set\r\nthe King's crown upon his head; and the sovereign house of Brandenburg\r\nthus became one of the European powers. Frederick William I established\r\nhere his authority as \"_rocher de bronze_\"; under Frederick the Great,\r\nthe province shared in the joys and sorrows of his reign. Then came\r\nthe difficult time of trial. The great soldier Emperor of the French\r\nresided here, and after the power of Prussia had been shattered he let\r\nboth the city and the country feel his merciless hand. Here, however,\r\nthe thoughts of raising up and freeing the Fatherland were first put\r\ninto action. After Tauroggen,[44] when the old, unyielding York stirred\r\nup the people with his flaming speeches, came the courageous decision\r\nof the Prussian Diet to begin the work of liberation. And here my\r\ngrandfather, again, by his own right, set the Prussian crown upon his\r\nhead, once more distinctly emphasizing the fact that it was accorded\r\nhim by the will of God alone and not by parliament or by any assemblage\r\nof the people or by popular vote, and that he thus looked upon himself\r\nas the chosen instrument of Heaven and as such performed his duties as\r\nregent and sovereign. And adorned with this crown, forty years ago,\r\nhe rode forth to battle to win the Emperor's crown also. Truly it\r\nwas a long way to the time of the famous telegram of the Emperor to\r\nmy late grandmother: \"What a change through the providence of God!\"\r\nThis picture would, however, be incomplete if I did not mention one\r\nfigure which especially in that year had occupied and gripped anew\r\nthe Prussians and, I may truly say, the whole German people. It is\r\nnot possible to think of the time of our collapse and our revival,\r\nwithout remembering the figure of Queen Louise. The people of the\r\ncity of Königsberg and the province of East Prussia likewise saw this\r\nangel in human form wandering among them and they were influenced by\r\nher and helped her to bear her grievous ills. The noble Queen has been\r\ndescribed by many as going about among her subjects, and our people\r\nhold her in grateful remembrance. But I think that one thing cannot be\r\nsufficiently emphasized, and that is that in the general shattering of\r\nour Fatherland, when even the statesmen and leaders of the army gave\r\nup everything as lost, the Queen was the only one who never for one\r\nmoment doubted for the future of the Fatherland. Through her example,\r\nthrough her letters, through her conversation, and through the bringing\r\nup of her children she showed the people the way in which to find\r\nthemselves again. She showed them the way back to religion and with\r\nit to a recognition of and a confidence in themselves. She encouraged\r\nour people in the thought of rallying about the King again and of\r\nwinning back our freedom. And after she--a noble martyr--had faded\r\naway and enthusiasm flamed forth in the land again and old and young\r\nseized their weapons to drive the intruder from the country, then,\r\nin spirit, she marched before the colors and inspired the warriors\r\nwith courage that the great work could be accomplished. What does the\r\nnoble figure of Queen Louise teach us? It teaches us that, as she once\r\nimbued her sons with the one thought of restoring the country's honor\r\nand of defending the Fatherland, so we men should cultivate all warlike\r\nvirtues. As in the time of the liberation young and old rallied to\r\nthe standard and gave everything they had--when even women and girls\r\ndid not spare their hair--so we must ever be prepared and keep our\r\nequipment intact, in view of the fact that the neighboring powers have\r\nmade such astounding progress. For only upon our preparedness does our\r\npeace rest. And what shall our wives learn from the Queen? They will\r\nlearn that the chief duty of German women lies not in the province of\r\nmeetings and club life, not in reaching out after imaginary rights so\r\nthat they may do as men do, but in the quiet work in the house and in\r\nthe family. They are to educate the younger generation, especially in\r\nobedience and in respect toward their elders. They are to make clear\r\nto their children and to their children's children that it is not a\r\nquestion to-day of living their own life at the expense of others or\r\nof achieving their own aims at the expense of the Fatherland, but that\r\nthey must singly and solely keep the Fatherland before their eyes and\r\nsingly and solely devote all their powers and their thoughts to the\r\ngood of the Fatherland. That is the lesson which has been bequeathed\r\nto us by this noble figure whom the Fatherland and the citizens of\r\nthis city have so beautifully described on her simple monument as \"the\r\ngood genius of the Prussian people.\" I cherish the hope that all of\r\nthe people of East Prussia who have gathered here will understand me\r\nand that, as they return again to their work and their occupation,\r\nthey will think of these things. We must co-operate for the good of\r\nthe Fatherland, no matter who and where we are. And for me, too, the\r\nconduct of this vanished Queen will be an example, as it was for\r\nmy grandfather. Looking upon myself as the instrument of the Lord,\r\nwithout regard for daily opinions and intentions, I go my way, which is\r\ndevoted solely and alone to the welfare and peaceful development of the\r\nFatherland. But in this work I need the co-operation of every one in\r\nthe country and to this co-operation I would like to invite you also. I\r\nempty my glass in the hope that this attitude may ever prevail in the\r\nprovince of East Prussia and that it may lend me its assistance in my\r\nlabors. Long live the province of East Prussia!--Long may she prosper!\r\n\r\n[44] In 1812 Prussia was ostensibly an ally of France. It was due to\r\n     General York, the commander of the Prussian Auxiliaries, rather\r\n     than to the Emperor's somewhat pusillanimous ancestor, King\r\n     Frederick William, that Prussia was liberated from the rule of\r\n     Napoleon. York commanded the Prussian troops who were to serve\r\n     as auxiliaries to Napoleon. On December 30, 1812, he, on his\r\n     own authority, concluded the convention of Tauroggen with the\r\n     Russians by which he broke with the French and declared his corps\r\n     neutral. The vacillating Prussian King, in spite of his country's\r\n     humiliation, was too solicitous about maintaining his throne to\r\n     dare venture upon any really decisive action. It was popular\r\n     pressure far more than the King's (or even the Queen's) initiative\r\n     which brought about the national uprising against foreign\r\n     domination.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERLIN\r\n\r\nBERLIN, OCTOBER 11, 1910\r\n\r\n    The active interest which the Emperor has always taken in higher\r\n    education in Germany is evident in the following address. If he\r\n    has given it a powerful organization he has taken from it by\r\n    unconscious processes a large measure of its earlier freedom. The\r\n    professorial caste has always been highly influential. During the\r\n    Emperor's reign it has been pressed into his service. Its present\r\n    system of organization and its connection with the government\r\n    puts the Emperor, or at least the minister appointed by him,\r\n    in a position to distribute rewards. It is said that there are\r\n    practically no Social Democrats teaching in higher institutions of\r\n    learning.\r\n\r\n    In the early years of its foundation the university of Berlin\r\n    rendered immense services to the patriotic cause, especially\r\n    through the work of Fichte and Schleiermacher.\r\n\r\nTo my loyal Frederick-William University, I offer greeting and\r\ncongratulations on this its hundredth anniversary!\r\n\r\nFrom the day of its founding its fortunes have been intimately bound\r\nup with those of the Prussian-German Fatherland. When my ancestor King\r\nFrederick William III called it into existence a hundred years ago, he\r\ndid so in order to compensate the state with spiritual powers for what\r\nshe had lost in physical power. Thus the University of Berlin was born\r\nout of the same creative genius from which sprung the regeneration of\r\nPrussia. And this spirit, which raised up Prussian Germany and which\r\nlived in Fichte, Schleiermacher, Savigny, and their friends, made\r\nthe university even in a few years the centre of the spiritual and\r\nintellectual life of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nTruly, the University of Berlin was still far from being a _universitas\r\nlitterarum_ in the sense of William von Humboldt, but it has come ever\r\nnearer and nearer to this ideal. A stronghold of wisdom, she has won,\r\nfar beyond the boundaries of Prussia and Germany, an international\r\nsignificance. Through the exchange of teachers and students these\r\nrelations are visible externally. Through the activity which it shares\r\nin common with the rest of the universities of the country it now forms\r\nthe \"general institute of learning\" which was intended at its founding.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Humboldt's plan, which comprised besides the university\r\nthe totality of intellectual institutions, has not yet come to complete\r\nrealization, and these hours of consecration seem to me especially\r\nfitted for preparing the way for the completion of what appeared to\r\nhim as the goal.\r\n\r\nHis great educational plan demanded, besides the academies of learning\r\nand the university, independent institutes for research as an integral\r\npart of the general educational organization. The founding of such\r\ninstitutions has not kept pace in Prussia with the development of\r\nthe universities, and this defect, especially in our natural-science\r\nequipment, is becoming more and more noticeable as a result of\r\nthe powerful forging ahead of the sciences. We need institutions\r\nwhich reach out beyond the limits of the universities, institutions\r\nuntrammelled by aims of instruction, yet in close touch with the\r\nacademy and the university, which shall serve entirely for research.\r\n\r\nTo call such research institutes into being as soon as possible seems\r\nto me a sacred duty of the present, and I hold it as my task, as father\r\nof my country, to bespeak the general interest for this undertaking.\r\nThis high aim requires great expense and can be accomplished only if\r\nall circles interested in the progress of the sciences and in the\r\nwelfare of the Fatherland are ready to co-operate in this significant\r\ntask and to make sacrifices for it. I should like, therefore, to-day\r\nto lay upon the conscience and place before the eyes of every one the\r\nnew aim with the impressive warning: \"_Tua res agitur._\" I hope and\r\nfirmly trust that this work will succeed; indeed, although the plans\r\nhave been disclosed only to a limited circle, from various parts of the\r\ncountry I have already received enthusiastic expressions of support and\r\nvery considerable means; between nine and ten million [marks] have been\r\nplaced at my disposal. I feel the need of expressing here in this place\r\nmy warmest thanks to these unselfish donors.\r\n\r\nBut to secure lasting support for this undertaking, it is my wish,\r\nunder my protection and my name, to found a society which shall set for\r\nitself the task of erecting and maintaining institutions for research.\r\nTo this society I will gladly turn over the money given me for that\r\npurpose. To see to it that the institutions so founded shall not lack\r\nhelp from the state will be the care of my reign.[45]\r\n\r\n[45] On the Emperor's initiative, the Emperor William Society for the\r\n     furthering of the sciences was founded. It has already called into\r\n     being two scientific institutes, the Emperor William Institute for\r\n     Chemistry and the Emperor William Institute for Physical Chemistry\r\n     and Electrical Chemistry. They were dedicated by the Emperor,\r\n     October 23, 1912.\r\n\r\nSo may to-day be not only an occasion of jubilation for the University\r\nof Berlin, but may it also signify a further step in the development of\r\nGerman spiritual life!\r\n\r\nAnd still one wish more I give to the university on its way into a new\r\ncentury. May she, in loyal remembrance of the time of her founding,\r\npreserve her Prussian-German character! Learning is, indeed, the common\r\nproperty of the whole cultural world, and her acquisitions to-day\r\nhalt at no boundaries. And yet--as every nation must preserve its own\r\nmanner of life if it would emphasize its independent existence and its\r\nvalue for the whole--may the _alma mater Berolinensis_ remain forever\r\nconscious that she is a German university. As formerly, so may she be\r\nfor all time the seat of German manners and of German art! And may\r\nevery one who has the honor to investigate, to teach, and to study\r\nwithin her walls devote himself to his task, filled with the sense for\r\ntruth and for thoroughness with the earnestness and the love for all\r\nwork which Goethe prized as the ornament of our people.\r\n\r\nMay the university further exercise her splendid privilege of fostering\r\ntrue knowledge, which, as Humboldt has so well said, comes from man's\r\ninner being to be planted again in his inner being, which creates and\r\nreshapes character. Let her do this with that noble freedom which\r\nsets laws unto itself and with that sense of exaltation which comes\r\nfrom being the administrator of a treasure which belongs to the\r\nwhole of humanity. \"_Communis hominum thesaurus situs est in magnis\r\nveritatibus._\"[46] But all truth is God's, and His spirit rests upon\r\nevery work which is grounded in and strives toward the truth. May this\r\nspirit of truth live also in you students; may it be found in all the\r\nworkings of my dear institution of learning! Then will her age be like\r\nher youth; she shall remain a city upon the hill, to which the peoples\r\nmake pilgrimage, and an ornament and treasure of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\n[46] This phrase is taken from Leibnitz's dedication of the\r\n     _Miscellanea Berolinensia_ to King Frederick I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR IN BRUSSELS\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 27, 1910\r\n\r\n    The Emperor and Empress, accompanied by the Princess Victoria\r\n    Luise, came to Brussels in order to repay the visit which the King\r\n    and Queen of Belgium had made to Potsdam in May, 1910. At the time\r\n    of the visit of King Albert to Berlin the Emperor did not take part\r\n    in the festivities, as he was suffering from a wound in the hand.\r\n    The honors were done by the Crown Prince. The Emperor's speech at\r\n    the banquet at the Royal Palace in Brussels calls for no comment.\r\n\r\nThe sincere words of friendship which your Majesty, in the name of her\r\nMajesty, the Queen, has just addressed to us, the Empress, my daughter,\r\nand me, as they sprang from warm hearts are welcomed by warm hearts.\r\nWe remember with greatest pleasure the visit which your Majesties made\r\nto us last spring at Potsdam, and it was a welcome duty of gratitude\r\nto return it as soon as possible. The brilliant reception prepared for\r\nus by your Majesties and the Belgian people in this splendid capital\r\nhas stirred us to the depths and inspires us to heartier thanks in that\r\nwe see in it an expression of the close bond which unites not only our\r\nfamilies but our peoples. It is with friendliest sympathy that I and\r\nall Germany follow the astounding results which have accrued to the\r\nuntiring energy of the Belgian people in all departments of trade and\r\nindustry, the crowning display of which we have seen in the brilliantly\r\nsuccessful World Exposition of this year. Belgian commerce embraces the\r\nwhole circle of the earth, and it is in the peaceful work of culture\r\nthat Germans and Belgians everywhere meet. Their cultivation of the\r\nmore spiritual arts fills us with similar wonder when we behold to what\r\na conspicuous place the poets and artists of Belgium have attained.\r\nMay the trustful and friendly feelings, to which in recent times the\r\nrelations of our governments bore such pleasing evidence, be ever more\r\nclosely preserved! From your Majesty's reign may happiness and blessing\r\nstream forth upon your house and upon your people! It is with this\r\nwish, which comes from the very depths of my heart, that I propose\r\nlong life to your Majesties, the King and Queen of the Belgians!\r\n\r\n\r\nALCOHOL AND THE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nCASSEL, AUGUST 19, 1911\r\n\r\n    The Emperor had been a student at the Friedrichs Gymnasium in\r\n    Cassel, and in 1875 his parents had presented a flag to the school,\r\n    which had now to be replaced. In turning over the new flag to the\r\n    first man in the upper class, the Emperor took occasion to give the\r\n    students certain advice, particularly with regard to the use of\r\n    alcoholic beverages. His attitude here marks a decided innovation\r\n    in Germany, and if his address is compared with the one delivered\r\n    at Bonn (April 24, 1901), it will be seen how keenly aware he is of\r\n    the changing tendencies of the times.\r\n\r\nI have decided to have a new flag woven for the upper class instead of\r\nthe one which my parents bestowed when I was a student and which has\r\nfallen a victim to time. The high school has asked to have the old one\r\nback again; I will have it mended so that it may be hung. I wish you to\r\nremember, through it, that from your walls and your studies a German\r\nEmperor has gone forth.\r\n\r\nYou have been busy with the studies of antiquity. Do not lay too much\r\nstress upon the incidents of their political life; for these relations\r\nhave so changed that they cannot be applied to the present. You may\r\nwell rejoice in many of the great figures and characters of antiquity,\r\nbut Greek culture has one special trait which no other nation has\r\nshown. The harmony which our own time so sadly lacks, the Greek people\r\nshowed in art, in life, in their motions, in their dress, yes, even in\r\ntheir systems of philosophy, and in the handling of their problems. I\r\nespecially advise you to read what Chamberlain so trenchantly says on\r\nthis point in the Introduction to his \"Foundations of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, above all, strive to know the history of your Fatherland.\r\nLearn to know the misery of our people in the later years of the\r\nMiddle Ages, in the struggles between church and state and between the\r\nprinces, in the strife of creeds during the Thirty Years' War, when\r\nour people were trodden down and brought into the service of foreign\r\npeoples and dynasties with whom its interests had nothing in common,\r\nuntil the final great downfall in the time of Napoleon. The year 1870\r\nfirst brought us a united German state again. And if you enter upon\r\na political career, keep your eye upon the field as a whole, and do\r\nnot be disturbed by parties. For these shove their interests before\r\nthose of the Fatherland and often draw a curtain between you and it.\r\nAnd if your political efforts threaten to bewilder you, I advise you\r\nto withdraw from them for a time--travel or go on a walking tour--and\r\nlet Nature have her way. Then when you return you will have a clearer\r\nvision of the real relations. If at any time the waves overwhelm you,\r\nif the many phenomena of modern art and literature bewilder and depress\r\nyou, you can always turn to these ideals of antiquity as a means of\r\nrecovering your balance.\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to enter the university. Therefore I would like to\r\ngive you one more counsel, which you must not take lightly, for it is\r\nto me a very serious matter. Alcohol is a great danger to our people,\r\nwhich, believe me, gives me great anxiety. I have led the government\r\nnow during twenty-three years, and through the reports which pass\r\nthrough my hands I know how many crimes have been committed through\r\nalcohol. Direct your gaze for a moment to a neighboring land. The\r\nAmericans are far ahead of us in this. At their universities there they\r\ndo great things, as you may convince yourselves, since so many students\r\ncome to us from there. There, at the reunions and at the great academic\r\ngatherings--for instance, at the inauguration of a president--no wine\r\nis seen on the whole table; and they get along very well without it. If\r\nyou enter the university, steel your body through sport and through\r\nfencing--a thing I would blame in no one--or through rowing; but do\r\nnot seek to make a record for yourself by seeing who can gulp down the\r\ngreatest number of intoxicating drinks. Those are customs which come\r\nto us from another time. If you will take this attitude in the corps\r\nand societies, I shall be grateful to you. We have other tasks now than\r\nthey had in former years and must strengthen our knowledge of national\r\neconomy and finances. For it is worth Germany's while to protect her\r\nposition in the world, especially in the world market. Therefore we\r\nmust all hold fast together.\r\n\r\nI herewith turn the flag over to you. The _primus omnium_, so I\r\nunderstand, will carry it and will consider it an honor that he is the\r\nfirst one to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, AUGUST 27, 1911\r\n\r\n    After a religious service for the army, the Emperor and Empress\r\n    visited the race-course at Grossborstel. The relations between\r\n    Germany and England were becoming strained. At the time of the\r\n    uprising in Morocco on the twenty-first of May, 1911, the French\r\n    general Moinier took measures, so he said, to protect Europeans\r\n    in Morocco and later besieged certain native cities. Germany,\r\n    pursuing her world-policy, immediately sent the gunboat _Panther_\r\n    and later the cruiser _Berlin_ to the harbor of Agadir, and assumed\r\n    a threatening attitude, as she had done at Tangier and as Admiral\r\n    Diedrichs had done at Manila. When the English made it plain that\r\n    they would support France, in accordance with the _entente_ reached\r\n    in 1904, with regard to Morocco and Egypt, feeling between the two\r\n    nations became tense and has remained so. The Emperor here, while\r\n    insisting upon the place in the sun, is at the same time insisting\r\n    on friendly competition. (See the discussion of the speech of March\r\n    31, 1905.)\r\n\r\nYOUR MAGNIFICENCE:\r\n\r\nAs often as her Majesty and I have the happy opportunity of coming to\r\nHamburg, it becomes our duty to express our gratitude for the joyful\r\nreception and warm, heartfelt greeting which is accorded us by all\r\nclasses of the Hamburg citizens. We have felt this again to-day and are\r\nconstrained to express anew our thanks for the welcome on the part of\r\nthe city. It is an index of how close the relations have become between\r\nthe citizens of Hamburg and our house. As the highest commander of my\r\narmy, I would at the same time like to express the joy I take in the\r\nfact that the Hanseatic cities are now about to express again their\r\nlively interest and their love and fondness for the regiments which\r\nbear their names. To me it is a proof that the relationship between\r\nthe garrisons and their cities is a deep and a close one, and that they\r\nare proud to give some outward recognition for the service which their\r\nsons have rendered in the past and for the zeal which they showed in\r\ntheir work of peace.\r\n\r\nWhen, yesterday, the city of Hamburg enthusiastically greeted a portion\r\nof that army which has so long maintained peace, she did a very proper\r\nthing, for she understands that under the protection of peace she can\r\ndevote herself to her labors. She is a world city and is situated on\r\none of the greatest rivers of our Fatherland, and the breath of the sea\r\nand the wave beat of the tides come to her wharves. Just as for the\r\nhuman body, it is necessary for a nation to breathe in order to live.\r\nThe breath of the body politic gives it life and strength. This breath\r\nis commerce. Long ago the far-sighted Great Elector coined the phrase:\r\n\"Trade and navigation are the two main pillars of my state.\"\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-three years since I mounted the throne it has been a\r\npleasure to me to follow the progress which the Hanseatic cities and\r\nespecially Hamburg have achieved in their restless advance. If I do\r\neverything that I can on my side to help the Hanseatic cities, it is a\r\nduty that I gladly discharge.\r\n\r\nBut we need not wonder that the great increase of trade in our\r\nnewly united Fatherland has disquieted many people in the world. I,\r\nnevertheless, believe that in the domain of commerce competition is\r\nhealthful; it is necessary in order to spur on states and nations to\r\nnew achievement. Indeed, it is the same thing with sports, as we have\r\nseen to-day at the magnificent race-course, where before the eyes of\r\nthousands of Hamburg's men and so many of her beautiful women the\r\nofficers of my army rode in competition. There we see one rider who in\r\nthought has already won first prize, and on the right and on the left\r\nthe next two work up to him and it becomes an earnest contest between\r\nthe three. Then he who up to this point was at the head reaches for his\r\nwhip, not in order to strike his two rival riders but his own horse,\r\nand he gives him the spur. In the same way competition between nations\r\ncan be fought out in peace.\r\n\r\nThe powerfully developing German fleet of war, which is distinguished\r\nby its cult of manliness and discipline, has in the last decades been\r\ncreated by the German people as a protection to trade and navigation.\r\nIt represents the will of the German people to count for something\r\nupon the seas. This growing young fleet is particularly proud of the\r\ninterest of Hamburg's citizens. If, then, I have correctly interpreted\r\nthis expression of your enthusiasm, I believe that I dare assume that\r\nit is your purpose to further strengthen our fleet in order that we\r\nmay be certain that no one will dare challenge the \"place in the sun\"\r\nwhich should be rightfully ours. I, therefore, raise my glass to the\r\nhealth of the Hanseatic cities, and especially to Hamburg, the greatest\r\nof them all! The gentlemen know what I think about Hamburg and how I\r\nfeel myself bound to her. And at the risk of repeating myself I say it\r\nagain: the citizens of Hamburg and I understand each other! The city of\r\nHamburg--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL GLORIES\r\n\r\nAIX, OCTOBER 18, 1911\r\n\r\n    The special fondness of the Emperor for Aix is indicated in the\r\n    address of June 19, 1902. With his assistance the cathedral had\r\n    been restored in this year, and a marble tablet had been set\r\n    up in his honor. If the Emperor's father was concerned about\r\n    restoring the splendor of the crown, it is also true that he was\r\n    by nature one of the most liberal of the Hohenzollerns. The book\r\n    which Frederick I gave his son to read was in all probability the\r\n    magnificent volume, \"Die Reichskleinodien\" by Doctor Fr. Bock,\r\n    published in Vienna in 1864.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURGOMASTER:\r\n\r\nYou have strengthened with your friendly words of greeting the deep\r\nimpression which I received to-day as I found myself within your walls.\r\nI thank you, the city magistrates and the citizens, most heartily\r\nfor this memorable day. I do not see how the eightieth birthday\r\nof my father, who was all too soon taken from us, could have been\r\ncelebrated more beautifully than through the solemn unveiling of the\r\nmagnificent equestrian statue dedicated to his memory, which we owe\r\nto the unselfish reverence of the citizens of Aix for the favorite of\r\nthe German people. I congratulate the city on this new monument, which\r\nwill serve as a bond and a joy for generations yet unborn. It will\r\nindicate that, in spite of all the frictions and political, social,\r\nand religious differences of our time, a firm bond of love and trust,\r\nnevertheless, surrounds and binds together the prince and the people.\r\n\r\nIf ever a prince deserved a monument here in Aix it was my late\r\nfather. From my childhood I had occasion to observe with what interest\r\nhe devoted himself to the study of the German Emperors and of their\r\ntraditions and how deeply he was impressed by the power of their\r\nposition and the splendor of the old German imperial crown. When as a\r\nlad I played in his room and had earned some reward through my good\r\nbehavior, he allowed me to turn the leaves of a magnificent volume in\r\nwhich were represented the jewels, insignia, robes, and weapons of the\r\nEmperors, and finally, in brilliant colors, the crown itself. How his\r\neyes glistened when he told stories of the coronations at Aix with\r\ntheir ceremonies and banquets, of Charlemagne, of Barbarossa, and their\r\ngreatness! He always closed by saying: \"That must all come again, the\r\npower of the empire must rise, and the glitter of the Emperor's crown\r\nmust shine forth once more. Barbarossa must be freed from the tower\r\nagain!\" And it was granted him by Providence to play a large part in\r\nthe accomplishment of this great work. On the bloody field of battle he\r\nhelped his honored father to win the Emperor's crown and the unity of\r\nthe German people.\r\n\r\nEducated by my father for the high position which was one day to be\r\nmine, I grew up in wonder and in reverence for the Emperor's crown,\r\nwhich, with its burden and its responsibility, I have taken over from\r\nhim. It is a sacred jewel from which, under God's protection, many\r\nblessings have gone forth upon the Fatherland and which has proved\r\nitself a shield for the national honor. All Germans can look up to\r\nit with trust, and it will show itself the stronger the more it is\r\nsurrounded and supported by loyal affection and earnest co-operation.\r\n\r\nAs my forefathers bestowed their special favor upon Aix, so with me\r\nit has always been a pleasure to be able to show her my interest and\r\ngood wishes, within whose walls here, in the extreme western part\r\nof the empire, German culture and German manners have found a place\r\nfortified by a famous past and traditions many hundred years old. May\r\nthe city in the future also, with her salutary springs and beautiful\r\nwooded hills, with her manifold industries and her far-reaching\r\ncommerce, grow, flourish, and prosper! May the citizens, through\r\nloyalty to God, King, and Fatherland, pursue their work and enjoy the\r\nfruits of their industry in peace! The old imperial city and her loyal\r\ncitizens--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nLAST MONTHS OF PEACE\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 7, 1912--JUNE 23, 1914\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE REICHSTAG\r\n\r\nBERLIN, FEBRUARY 7, 1912\r\n\r\n    As a result of the Morocco crisis and the increasing imminence of\r\n    international difficulties, the war footing of the German army\r\n    had been increased to 3,860,000 men. The navy had been steadily\r\n    extended, and projects for further increases in both army and navy\r\n    were to be introduced at this session of the Reichstag and to\r\n    be granted. The question of taxation was becoming more and more\r\n    serious. In view of the project for increased armament and higher\r\n    taxation, Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg had earnestly urged all\r\n    parties to unite against the Social Democrats. His efforts were\r\n    not nearly so successful as had been those of Bülow in 1907. One\r\n    hundred and ten Social Democrats were returned. It is perhaps\r\n    significant that at this session the Reichstag voted a bill\r\n    creating a German oil company, which was to conduct its operations\r\n    under the supervision of the government and thus render Germany\r\n    more independent of foreign countries in this regard.\r\n\r\nHONORED SIRS:\r\n\r\nIn the name of the affiliated governments, I bid the newly elected\r\nReichstag welcome!\r\n\r\nTo maintain the solid framework of the empire and the order of the\r\nstate undisturbed, to increase the welfare of the people in all classes\r\nand conditions, to protect and raise the strength and credit of the\r\nnation is the aim of all my efforts. In this I find myself in accord\r\nwith my honored colleagues, and I cherish the conviction that you, as\r\nthe chosen representatives of the nation, will exert your best powers\r\nin this common work.\r\n\r\nFor a generation past questions of social regulation have occupied\r\na prominent place in the legislation of the realm. Even at the last\r\nsession of the previous Reichstag the benefits of insurance were\r\nextended to a large portion of the population. The same social spirit\r\nwith which the work has previously gone forward must prevail even\r\nfurther. For development does not stand still.\r\n\r\nThe finances of the realm have attained a firm position. On the basis\r\nof definitely calculated contributions from the states, we have\r\nsucceeded in establishing a balance in the imperial economy, and by\r\nthe help of the surplus which resulted we have relieved the excess of\r\nthe budget. By holding fast to the rigorous policies in vogue up to\r\nthe present, the empire will within a short time arrive at a complete\r\nrestoration of its finances.\r\n\r\nIt fills me with satisfaction when I think to what a point the free\r\nspirit of enterprise has attained in industry and crafts, in trade,\r\nand in commerce, and how, through the increasing perfection of its\r\ntechnic, agriculture has gradually blossomed forth again. In view of\r\nthis gratifying progress, the affiliated governments will henceforth\r\nnot neglect to strengthen the foundation of our customs policy by means\r\nof alterations and the addition of new trading regulations.\r\n\r\nA project which will be shortly put before you is to serve for the\r\nstrengthening of the German interests in foreign countries. It\r\nregulates dependence upon the empire and the state in such a way that\r\nit will be easier for natives of Germany in foreign parts to remain\r\ncitizens of the empire, or, in case they have lost their imperial\r\nrights, to recover them again.[47]\r\n\r\n[47] This project resulted in a law promulgated by the Emperor July 22,\r\n     1913. It has been made the subject of considerable hostile comment\r\n     in foreign countries, as it would seem under certain conditions,\r\n     not definitely fixed, to permit a German subject to divide his\r\n     allegiance.\r\n\r\n     Article 17 of this law asserts that (German) citizenship is\r\n     lost through the acquiring of citizenship in a foreign country.\r\n     It, however, refers to Article 25, which makes the following\r\n     conditions:\r\n\r\n     Art. 25, Sec. 2. Citizenship [German] shall not be lost by him\r\n     who, before acquiring citizenship in a foreign country, shall,\r\n     on his request, have received the written permission to retain\r\n     [German] citizenship from the proper authority in his home\r\n     state. The German consul is to be consulted before granting this\r\n     permission.\r\n\r\n     Art. 25, Sec. 3. The Imperial Chancellor, on a vote of the\r\n     Bundesrat, can decree that the permission specified in Section 2,\r\n     shall not be granted to persons who wish to acquire citizenship in\r\n     a specified foreign state.\r\n\r\n     On the face of it, this decree would seem to be open to the\r\n     interpretation that it lies within the power of the German\r\n     Bundesrat to allow a man who has ostensibly acquired citizenship\r\n     in a foreign country to be counted as a German citizen.\r\n\r\nThe success of our work of peace at home and overseas depends upon\r\nthe empire's remaining powerful enough to stand for and protect its\r\nnational honor, its possessions, and its rightful interests in the\r\nworld at all times. On this account it is my continual duty and care\r\nto maintain and strengthen by land and by sea the armies of the German\r\npeople, which does not lack young men capable of bearing arms. Bills to\r\nthis end are in preparation and will be laid before you together with\r\nproposals which will provide for the increased expenditure. If, Honored\r\nSirs, you help to carry out this great project you will be doing the\r\nFatherland a great service.\r\n\r\nWe have given a new proof of our willingness to settle international\r\npoints of dispute amicably wherever this can be done in accordance with\r\nthe dignity and the interests of Germany, through the conclusion of\r\nour agreements with France. In addition to strengthening our alliances\r\nwith the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the kingdom of Italy, my policy\r\nis directed toward the maintenance of friendly relationships with all\r\npowers on the basis of mutual respect and good-will.\r\n\r\nI trust the healthy power of the German people, and, counting upon the\r\nsupport of a gracious God, I look out hopefully over the struggles of\r\nthe day toward the future of the empire. Therefore, at the beginning of\r\na new legislative session, I offer you, Honored Sirs, my greeting in\r\nthe hope that your activities will be exerted for the benefit of the\r\npeople and the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRANDENBURG ONCE AGAIN\r\n\r\nMAY 30, 1912\r\n\r\n    The indications of particular good-will which the Emperor had\r\n    always exhibited for the Brandenburgers and the marks of special\r\n    favor which he had seemed to accord to them have occasionally\r\n    aroused a certain suspicion, not to say ill will, in the minds of\r\n    some of his South German subjects. In his hereditary provinces,\r\n    Brandenburg and Prussia, it will be noticed that the Emperor had\r\n    always expressed himself most freely with regard to his personal\r\n    pretensions that he ruled by divine right alone. The two speeches\r\n    which have been most criticised in this respect are the ones\r\n    delivered at Breslau (February 3, 1899) and Königsberg (August 25,\r\n    1910). They served, unfortunately, to accentuate the differences\r\n    which existed between the subjects in various parts of the empire\r\n    and to remind them that they had a Prussian Emperor. If certain\r\n    portions of his audiences here acquiesced in these pretensions of\r\n    their hereditary ruler and were somewhat proud of the particular\r\n    confidence he vouchsafed to them, critics, and even conservative\r\n    critics, referred to these ideas of \"_Gottesgnadentum_,\"\r\n    grace-of-Godism, with touches of what was at least irony. After\r\n    the unfortunate crisis following the _Daily Telegraph_ interview\r\n    Chancellor von Bülow had felt constrained to request the Emperor\r\n    \"henceforward to observe, even in private interviews, that reserve\r\n    which is indispensable both to the interests of a consistent policy\r\n    and to the authority of the crown.\" As we have seen, in spite\r\n    of the Emperor's seeming acceptance of this necessity, it had\r\n    not modified to any particular extent the tenor of his speech at\r\n    Königsberg in 1910. It may be that by this time (1912) he had taken\r\n    the admonition to heart, for it will be noticed that, though we\r\n    have the customary reference to Frederick of Hohenzollern and the\r\n    glorification of his ancestors, and also the marks of special favor\r\n    and trust in the Brandenburgers, we miss any mention of the theory\r\n    of divine right.\r\n\r\n    La Fontaine has said that it is difficult to please every one and\r\n    his father. The Emperor must have felt this when he learned that\r\n    certain of his subjects, nevertheless, resented that closing part\r\n    of his speech which would seem to imply that the Franco-Prussian\r\n    War was a sort of family affair through which the grateful\r\n    Brandenburgers decided to present the imperial crown to their\r\n    beloved overlord. Through such an interpretation the position and\r\n    interests of Bavaria, for instance, became for Bavarians somewhat\r\n    too incidental. If, then, foreign critics have drawn a distinction\r\n    between Prussia and Germany, the distinction has, therefore, a\r\n    certain warrant, since it seems to be made by the Emperor himself.\r\n    The heir to the Bavarian crown took occasion to object in one of\r\n    his speeches to the conception that the affiliated sovereigns are\r\n    \"vassals of the Emperor.\" That he should have gone so far would\r\n    indicate that, in his mind at least, there was a disposition to\r\n    make them so. He was even more emphatic in a speech delivered in\r\n    May, 1900, before the Association for the Furtherance of Inland\r\n    Navigation in Bavaria. \"I do not see,\" he said, \"why we, if we\r\n    belong to the German Empire should not enjoy precisely the same\r\n    rights and privileges as North Germany, for the German Empire was\r\n    welded together just as much through Bavarian blood as through\r\n    the blood of any other German stock; and for that reason we do\r\n    not wish to be regarded as minor brothers, but as brothers with\r\n    full rights and privileges.\" So, too, it is said that the King\r\n    of Würtemberg left the Emperor's side in anger and withdrew from\r\n    the army manoeuvres in 1894. It will be plain to any one who\r\n    reads the Emperor's speeches that very few of them are made in\r\n    South Germany. Münich, Leipzig, and Stuttgart have been visited\r\n    by him less frequently than certain foreign capitals. This is due\r\n    in part, no doubt, to the fact that the reigning sovereigns of\r\n    these capitals do not wish to see a greater at their side. But it\r\n    is likewise true that in most of these districts the Emperor's\r\n    reception at the hands of the populace would be far less warm\r\n    than that accorded to him at Breslau and Berlin; for, if the\r\n    Emperor is warranted in expecting a particular loyalty from his\r\n    Prussians and Brandenburgers, so, too, are the hereditary rulers of\r\n    Bavaria, Saxony, and Würtemberg warranted in expecting a particular\r\n    recognition at home, which must necessarily be deducted from the\r\n    possible tribute which can be paid the Emperor, who is likewise a\r\n    rival King and King of a province which has not always enjoyed the\r\n    favorable consideration of South Germans.\r\n\r\n    It was on this day, May 30, five hundred years before that the\r\n    Burgrave Frederick VI of Hohenzollern, the later Elector Frederick\r\n    I, entered the fortified place of Brandenburg, on the Havel. In\r\n    commemoration of this fact, a fountain and an equestrian statue\r\n    of the Elector by Professor Manzel were dedicated. The church of\r\n    St. Catherine had likewise been restored and was rededicated on\r\n    this day. After the unveiling, the Emperor proceeded to the old\r\n    town hall, where he inscribed his name in the city's Golden Book,\r\n    and after he had accepted the drink of honor offered him by the\r\n    burgomaster, he delivered the following address:\r\n\r\nI am deeply grateful to the city of Brandenburg for having thought\r\nof inviting me to its celebration. It has been a celebration whose\r\nimportance extends far beyond the walls of Brandenburg, and I rejoice\r\nthat the Brandenburgers should have wished to have their Elector and\r\nMargrave with them, just as it goes without saying that the Elector\r\nis pleased when he can tarry among his Brandenburgers. The changes of\r\nhistory which have swept over the German Fatherland have called forth\r\nand laid tasks upon many a dynasty, and finally it was the dynasty of\r\nmy ancestors who first succeeded after many difficulties in laying the\r\ncorner-stone for the great work and at last in building up the work\r\nitself--the establishment of German unity on a Brandenburger basis and\r\nunder the leadership of Prussia. We must not forget that it must have\r\nbeen a difficult decision for the ruler of the land in those days and\r\nthe later Elector to undertake the task of coming into this country and\r\nof bringing it back again to a flourishing condition. For he came from\r\nthe sunny south, which had progressed in culture and whose knighthood\r\nat that time was also in its fullest flower of cultural development.\r\nWe have already learned from reliable lips what a frightful situation\r\nexisted at that time in the unhappy mark. And if he was successful in\r\nre-establishing order little by little and in sowing the seeds for new\r\nflowers, nevertheless the mark had to pass through many grievous storms\r\nand became the arena of foreign powers and foreign lords. But at last\r\nthe Great Elector and the great King drove away the foreigners once\r\nfor all and won for the people of the mark and of Prussia the right\r\nto live for themselves without having to see the products of their\r\nindustry and labor fall a prey to the caprices of strangers. And when\r\nat last, through the help of God, the Prussian edifice was completed\r\nand my grandfather, in the long period of peace, had sharpened the\r\nsword which he must needs have in order to achieve German union, then\r\nfor a second time, on a grander scale, the same work was accomplished\r\nwhich had previously been accomplished for the mark. And he succeeded\r\nin finally forbidding the strangers to trample upon our fields and to\r\ndestroy our labor for the mere sake of following their own interests.\r\nThe German Empire and the German crown rest upon a Brandenburg basis\r\nand a Prussian foundation. On that account we wish on this day to\r\nremember the people of the mark and of Brandenburg and not least the\r\nBrandenburgers who in 1870 risked their lives and all that was near and\r\ndear to them in order to win the imperial crown for the old master. As\r\nlong as a Hohenzollern lives and as long as there are Brandenburgers\r\nboth of them will remember Constantine Alvensleben, Vionville, and the\r\nThird Corps.[48] This was the old Brandenburger loyalty which had been\r\npreserved through all the centuries, and I hope that this loyalty may\r\nbe the possession of the coming generations of the city of Brandenburg.\r\nAnd I drink this cup in the hope that this loyalty may never be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\n[48] Constantine Alvensleben, commander of the Third (Brandenburg) Army\r\n     Corps, played an important part in the battle of Vionville, on the\r\n     16th of August, 1870. He checked the French army operating from\r\n     Metz and held it until the arrival of reinforcements.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAULING DOWN THE FLAG\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, JUNE 18, 1912\r\n\r\n    As usual, the Emperor was present at the meeting of the North\r\n    German Regatta Association. Since 1897 he had been absent but\r\n    once. Certain references in his address here doubtless refer\r\n    back to the outcome of events at Agadir. It is difficult to tell\r\n    whether or not he is on the defensive. Whatever his qualities or\r\n    defects, it cannot properly be said that he has often or indeed\r\n    ever publicly weakened in a position which he had once taken. He\r\n    has, however, occasionally shifted his ground. Criticism, instead\r\n    of giving him pause, has usually had the effect of angering him\r\n    and of immediately drawing his fire upon his critics. So, in\r\n    regard to the criticism of his agrarian policy on the part of the\r\n    Prussian land-owning nobility, he replied that \"opposition on the\r\n    part of the Prussian nobility is monstrous\" [_ein Unding_]. As the\r\n    opposition had been directed solely against certain policies and\r\n    not against him personally, his statement implies that he expected\r\n    the Prussian nobility to support him in all of his positions. He\r\n    expected personal loyalty. As some of his opponents were members of\r\n    the Prussian Landtag, it is difficult to see what would become of\r\n    the idea of representative government in case the representatives\r\n    of the people waived their opinions and those of their constituents\r\n    in his favor. Some of the sharpest criticism which the Emperor\r\n    incurred was that which followed the incidents at Tangier in 1905\r\n    and at Agadir in 1911. In both cases what may be called the war\r\n    party showed great resentment, and certain of the criticisms made\r\n    by them seem to indicate that war, to them, was a consummation\r\n    devoutly to be wished, and the failure to make war at these\r\n    opportunities was looked upon as a defeat. The Emperor seems here\r\n    to be insisting upon the fact that the flag has not been dishonored.\r\n\r\nYour Magnificence will certainly allow me to thank you for the address,\r\nwhich glowed with flaming patriotism and which was delivered with such\r\na sweep of oratory that, I am convinced, it carried away all those\r\nhere assembled. We saw from the sketch which your Magnificence has\r\ngiven us how in all centuries the history of our empire and of our\r\npeople, although in general attached to the Continent, nevertheless\r\nalways stood in close relationship with the water and the sea and that\r\nit has always been more or less influenced by it. But as you have\r\nshown, we formerly failed in gathering together our strength. The\r\nflourishing of the Hansa, interesting and beautiful, and for a time\r\npowerful as it was, had to pass away, because it lacked the support\r\nof the imperial power. Through the founding of the empire under my\r\ngrandfather all things were changed, and now the German merchant can go\r\nhis way peacefully, not under a foreign but under his own flag; he can\r\nexercise all his capacities and be sure that, when it is necessary, the\r\nprotection of the empire will stand behind him. That is only possible\r\nwhen all our powers are united under our German flag. But, as you all\r\nknow, gentlemen, the flag must wave in honor; and it dare not lightly\r\nspread its folds to the wind nor be lightly set up where we are not\r\nsure of being able to defend it. You will understand why I have acted\r\nwith this reserve in extending the reach of the German flag where many\r\nperhaps would have desired and longed to see it. I have allowed myself\r\nto be guided by an old Hanseatic proverb which stands in significant\r\nletters over the town hall at Lübeck: \"The little flag is easily tied\r\nto the staff, but it is difficult to haul it down with honor.\" Now,\r\ngentlemen, I believe that I can say without fear of contradiction that\r\nup to the present no one has ever dared offer an indignity to our flag\r\nso long as I have been reigning. I will promise and hold to it that\r\nwherever you go ahead there my flag shall follow you. That is true in\r\ngreat as in little things. Every man binds his flag to the staff in the\r\nmorning and hopes to conquer. Not every one is successful. In spite of\r\nthat, we rejoice that on this day of the Elbe regatta not only German\r\nbut also many boats of related and friendly peoples are present and\r\nmake the scene a picturesque one. Therefore we rejoice, and again I\r\nwhole-heartedly express the hope that sailing and water sport on the\r\nElbe and on the Baltic, on the inland lakes as on the sea, may grow and\r\nprosper. We, however, who have gathered here under the flag of Hamburg,\r\non the beautiful ship of the Hamburg-American Line, raise our glasses\r\nand drink to the health of the city of Hamburg and all seamen here\r\nassembled. The city of Hamburg--Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENT TO A ZEPPELIN\r\n\r\nBONN, OCTOBER 17, 1913\r\n\r\n    Nineteen hundred and thirteen was a jubilee year in the history\r\n    both of Germany and in the Emperor's reign. In the first place,\r\n    it was the one-hundredth anniversary of the famous battle of the\r\n    nations at Leipzig, which marked the turning of the tide in the\r\n    fortunes of Napoleon. On innumerable occasions the Emperor, in\r\n    the speeches already printed, has referred to this crisis in\r\n    the affairs of Germany; he was, curiously enough, not to make\r\n    the address on this famous occasion, for the celebration was\r\n    to take place at Leipzig and the addresses were made by Doctor\r\n    Clemens and by the King of Saxony. The journals noted that during\r\n    the address of Doctor Clemens the Emperor, who was present,\r\n    showed no enthusiasm and looked bored. The joyous occasion had\r\n    been clouded by the unfortunate accident to the naval Zeppelin\r\n    L-2 on the previous day. As the Emperor had succeeded to the\r\n    throne on the fifteenth of June, 1888, the year marked also the\r\n    completion of twenty-five years of his reign, and the week of\r\n    June 15 had been one of continual celebration and many speeches.\r\n    He issued innumerable pardons and conferred many titles and\r\n    decorations, among them the title of general on his Chancellor,\r\n    Von Bethmann-Hollweg. His many speeches were, however, for the\r\n    most part, merely acceptances of congratulations and, aside from\r\n    the renewed expression of his hope to maintain peace, are not\r\n    particularly significant to the student. The sense of increased\r\n    tension is evident everywhere and seems to have reacted upon\r\n    him, as he does not express himself with his former enthusiasm.\r\n    He repeats his old themes, the necessity of disregarding party\r\n    divisions and in particular the need of holding fast to religious\r\n    ideals and of moral regeneration.\r\n\r\n    On the seventeenth of October, 1913, on the eve of the great\r\n    national celebration, the naval Zeppelin L-2, shortly after\r\n    starting on a flight from Johannisthal to Hamburg, met with a\r\n    most distressing accident. An explosion occurred, the balloon\r\n    caught fire and burst, and the gondola fell with its crew. The\r\n    twenty-seven officers and men were killed. From Bonn the Emperor\r\n    issued the following statement. The text, as well as that of the\r\n    speech of June 23, 1914, is taken from the _Berliner Tageblatt_.\r\n\r\nAgain fate has laid a heavy hand upon my navy. The dirigible L-2 was\r\ndestroyed by an explosion, and nearly thirty brave men, among them many\r\nof the ablest in developing this new species of warcraft, lost their\r\nlives. Their death in the service of the Fatherland will be honorably\r\nremembered by me and the entire German people. Our very deepest\r\nsympathy goes out to their relatives. But grief over what has happened\r\nwill only spur us on to renewed efforts to develop this so important\r\naerial weapon into a reliable engine of war.\r\n\r\n                                                    WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE GERMANS FEAR GOD, NOTHING ELSE\r\n\r\nHAMBURG, JUNE 23, 1914\r\n\r\n    The following speech is, we believe, the last one delivered by the\r\n    Emperor before the murder of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand (June\r\n    28), which precipitated the war. True to his custom, the Emperor is\r\n    again at Hamburg at the regatta which usually marks the beginning\r\n    of his summer holiday. This year his yacht _Meteor_ was to win\r\n    the Hamburg prize. The banquet at which he ordinarily delivered\r\n    his address was to be held on board the _Victoria Luise_, and the\r\n    president of the association, Doctor Schröder, who made the address\r\n    preceding the Emperor's, alluded to the disaster to the Z-1 and\r\n    the destruction of that boat off Heligoland. He followed it with a\r\n    discussion of Germany's progress in naval and aerial development.\r\n    The Emperor answers with his usual compliments to Hamburg. His\r\n    naval policy and his policy of expansion had profited the seaport\r\n    towns particularly, and he was always a welcome guest. In the year\r\n    of his jubilee, 1913, the Hamburg-American Line had done him the\r\n    honor to name one of their boats the _Imperator_, and this year\r\n    they had launched the great thirty-thousand-ton _Bismarck_. If\r\n    his speech on this occasion shows nothing particularly new, one\r\n    thing at least is interesting from the change which he introduces\r\n    in Bismarck's famous statement. The Emperor himself has quoted it\r\n    previously (April 24, 1901): \"We Germans fear God, nothing else in\r\n    the world.\" Here it seems to have in it a little more of defiance\r\n    and possibly of challenge: \"We Germans fear God and absolutely\r\n    nobody and nothing else in the world.\"\r\n\r\nMay your Magnificence allow me to express my thanks for your friendly\r\nwords and for the picture of the past progress of important phases of\r\nour national development! I would like to include in my expression of\r\nthanks a heartfelt appreciation of the delightful reception which this\r\nyear, as in other years, was accorded me by the population of the city\r\nof Hamburg. It was noticeable in the oldest citizen and in the youngest\r\nchild. I have been able to see how the hearty and close relationship\r\nbetween Hamburg citizens and myself has gradually become traditional,\r\nfor it passes on from generation to generation. Your Magnificence,\r\nhas spoken of the sources which provide us with the material for the\r\nFatherland's activity on the seas and has cited some brilliant examples\r\nin this line. Although I, too, have noted with pleasure how sport has\r\ndeveloped greatly, I would, nevertheless, like to call attention to the\r\nfact that in one respect I believe our nation is following the right\r\npath. We are right in attempting to bring the mass to a higher level\r\nof development rather than to scoop out isolated great performances\r\nfrom a generally lowered average. The water sports which we foster and\r\nwhich have again brought us together here, have also seen a new yacht\r\nappear under my flag, and it has been successful in winning the Hamburg\r\nstate prize, for which honor I am joyously grateful. The yacht is the\r\ncreation of a German Hanseatic shipbuilder and was built by experienced\r\nhands at the well-known wharves of Mr. Krupp, on the water-front.\r\nThis, too, is an indication of the development of our technical skill,\r\nwhich was possible only in the long period of peace which was granted\r\nus after the stirring years of military prowess. It is a symbol of\r\npeace which the merchant, the banker, the ship-owner needs in order\r\nto develop, and which they have used each in his own calling to\r\nsuch magnificent effect. I am sure I represent the feelings of all\r\nthose assembled here on this beautiful and well-known ship of the\r\nHamburg-American Line when I thank that line particularly for the great\r\nday they recently prepared for us. As another symbol of the long period\r\nof peace, a few days ago the _Bismarck_ left its stocks. It is the\r\ngreatest vessel now afloat. We all of us know very well that this was\r\nno ordinary launching, both because of the size of the ship and because\r\nof the impression and attitude of the spectators. The Hamburg-American\r\nLine, through the building of this vessel, gave us the occasion for\r\na great national festival at the moment when the thirty thousand\r\ntons glided down into the water. It was as if all the dross had been\r\ntaken out of the lives of those of us who were present, and even from\r\nthe lives of all other Germans, as we may judge from the expressions\r\nwhich come to us from all parts of the country. Envy, pettiness, daily\r\nconflicts disappeared. All hearts beat higher and remembered the great\r\ntime and the great men who wrought in it and thought of the Great\r\nEmperor and of his Iron Chancellor. It is for us to administer further\r\nthe legacy that has come down to us. Just as in our individual efforts\r\nand in our sports we summon up and exert all our powers to reach our\r\ngoal, so too we must do the same for our Fatherland. We must be in\r\na position to take to heart and to exemplify practically one of the\r\nfinest utterances coined by the Iron Chancellor. We must so live and\r\nact that we shall at all times say with him: \"We Germans fear God and\r\nabsolutely nobody and nothing else in the world.\" With this feeling I\r\nraise my glass and ask you to drink with me to the city of Hamburg, the\r\nRegatta Association, and the Hamburg-American Line--Hurrah! Hurrah!\r\nHurrah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAT THE OUTBREAK OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAs there is no official edition of the Emperor's recent addresses, the\r\nfollowing five speeches and decrees are taken from the _Frankfurter\r\nZeitung_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCING THE SWORD INTO HIS HAND\r\n\r\nBERLIN, JULY 31, 1914\r\n\r\n    On the 31st of July the Emperor made the following address from the\r\n    balcony of the Royal Palace in Berlin:\r\n\r\nA grievous situation has come upon Germany. Envious nations on all\r\nsides are forcing us to justified defense. They are forcing the sword\r\ninto my hand. If my attempts are not successful in bringing our\r\nopponents to their senses and in keeping peace at the eleventh hour,\r\nI hope that with God's help we may so use the sword that we may be\r\nable to sheathe it again with honor. Enormous sacrifices in life and\r\nproperty would be demanded from the German people by a war; but we\r\nwould show the enemy what it means to attack Germany. And now I bid\r\nyou go to the church, bow down before God and ask His help for our\r\nbrave army.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN END OF PARTIES\r\n\r\nBERLIN, AUGUST 1, 1914\r\n\r\n    After the order of mobilization, the Emperor made the following\r\n    brief speech from the window of the Royal Palace:\r\n\r\nIf we must have war, all parties cease. We are only German brothers. In\r\ntimes of peace this or that party has attacked me; I forgive them now\r\nwith all my heart. If our neighbors are not satisfied to leave us in\r\npeace, then we hope and pray that our good German sword will come out\r\nof the struggle victorious.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE REICHSTAG\r\n\r\nBERLIN, AUGUST 4, 1914\r\n\r\n    The Emperor opened the special session of the Reichstag with the\r\n    following address:\r\n\r\nHONORED GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\nAt a time big with consequences I have assembled the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the German people about me. For nearly half a\r\ncentury we have been allowed to follow the ways of peace. The attempts\r\nto attribute to Germany warlike intentions and to hedge in her\r\nposition in the world have often sorely tried the patience of my\r\npeople. Undeterred, my government has pursued the development of our\r\nmoral, spiritual, and economic strength as its highest aim, with all\r\nfrankness, even under provocative circumstances! The world has been\r\nwitness that during the last years, under all pressure and confusion,\r\nwe have stood in the first rank in saving the nations of Europe from\r\na war between the great powers. The most serious dangers to which the\r\nevents in the Balkans had given rise seemed to have been overcome--then\r\nsuddenly an abyss was opened through the murder of my friend the\r\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand. My lofty ally, the Emperor and King Franz\r\nJoseph, was forced to take up arms to defend the security of his empire\r\nagainst dangerous machinations from a neighboring state. The Russian\r\nempire stepped in the way of the allied monarchy following out her\r\njust interests. Not only our duty as ally calls us to the side of\r\nAustria-Hungary, but it is our great task to protect our own position\r\nand the old community of culture between the two empires against the\r\nattack of hostile forces. With a heavy heart I have had to mobilize\r\nthe army against a neighbor with whom it had fought side by side on\r\nmany a battle-field. With unfeigned sorrow I saw broken a friendship\r\nwhich had been faithfully preserved by Germany. The imperial Russian\r\nGovernment, yielding to the pressure of an insatiable nationalism,\r\nhas taken sides for a state which through its sanctioning of criminal\r\nattacks has brought about the evils of this war. That France, too,\r\nshould have taken sides with our enemy could not surprise us; too often\r\nhave our attempts to come to friendlier relationships with the French\r\nRepublic failed because of her old hopes and old resentments.\r\n\r\nHonored Gentlemen, what human insight and power could do to equip a\r\npeople for these uttermost decisions has been done with your patriotic\r\nassistance. The hostility which has been making itself felt in the\r\neast and in the west for a long time past has now broken out in bright\r\nflame. The present situation is not the result of passing conflicts of\r\ninterests or of diplomatic conjunctions; it is the result of an ill\r\nwill which has been active for many years against the power and the\r\nprosperity of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nNo lust of conquest drives us on; we are inspired by the unalterable\r\nwill to protect the place in which God has set us for ourselves and all\r\ncoming generations. From the documents which have been submitted to\r\nyou, you will see how my government and especially my Chancellor have\r\nendeavored even to the last moment to stave off the inevitable. In a\r\ndefensive war that has been forced upon us, with a clear conscience\r\nand a clean hand we take up the sword. I issue my call to the peoples\r\nand stocks of the German Empire, that with their united strength they\r\nmay stand like brothers with our allies in order to defend what we\r\nhave created through the works of peace. Following the example of\r\nour fathers, staunch and true, earnest and knightly, humble before\r\nGod, but with the joy of battle in the face of the enemy, we trust in\r\nthe Almighty to strengthen our defense and guide us to good issue.\r\nHonored Gentlemen, the German people gathered about their princes and\r\nleaders are to-day looking to you. Come to your decisions quickly and\r\nunanimously. Such is my most earnest wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ARMY AND NAVY\r\n\r\nBERLIN, AUGUST 6, 1914\r\n\r\n    On this date the following statement was issued to the army and\r\n    navy:\r\n\r\nAfter forty-three years of peace, I call all the available forces to\r\narms. We must defend our most sacred possessions, the Fatherland, and\r\nour own hearths, against ruthless attack. Enemies round about us! That\r\nis the characteristic of the situation. We must expect a great conflict\r\nand to make great sacrifices. I have confidence that the old warlike\r\nspirit still lives in the German people, that powerful warlike spirit\r\nwhich attacks the enemy wherever found and at whatever cost and which\r\nhas always been the fear and terror of our enemies. I have confidence\r\nin you, you German soldiers. In every one of you there lives the eager,\r\nunconquerable will to triumph. Every one of you knows how to die like\r\na hero if need be. Think of our great and glorious past. Remember that\r\nyou are Germans. God help us.\r\n\r\n                                        (Signed) WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\n  BERLIN, August 6, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION TO THE GERMAN PEOPLE\r\n\r\nBERLIN, AUGUST 6, 1914\r\n\r\n    The following proclamation was issued on the evening of this date:\r\n\r\nTO THE GERMAN PEOPLE:\r\n\r\nSince the founding of the empire, for forty-three years it has been the\r\nearnest aim of my ancestors and myself to maintain peace with the world\r\nand to further our powerful advance in peace. But our opponents envy\r\nus the fruit of our labors. In the consciousness of our responsibility\r\nand our strength, we must endure overt and covert hostility from east\r\nand west and from across the sea. But now they wish to humble us. They\r\ndemand that with folded arms we should watch our enemies prepare\r\nthemselves for an underhand attack. They do not wish to allow us in\r\nloyal determination to stand by our ally, who is fighting for his\r\nposition as a great power and with whose humiliation our own power and\r\nhonor will also be lost. So the sword must decide! The enemy surprises\r\nus while we are entirely at peace. Therefore, to arms! Any wavering,\r\nany hesitation would be treachery to the Fatherland. We must fight for\r\nthe existence or non-existence of our empire, which our fathers lately\r\nfounded for themselves; for the existence or non-existence of German\r\npower and German life. We shall fight to the last breath of man and\r\nhorse, and we shall continue this conflict against a world of enemies.\r\nGermany has never yet been conquered as long as she was united. Go\r\nforward with God, who will be with us as He was with our fathers.\r\n\r\n                                          (Signed) WILLIAM, I. R.\r\n\r\n  BERLIN, August 6, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\nObvious printer errors have been fixed.\r\n\r\nVariations in spelling have been retained except in clear cases of\r\ntypographical error (see list below).\r\n\r\n  Page xiv - Tangiers changed to Tangier\r\n\r\n  Page 167 - unforgetable changed to unforgettably",
