Chevalier was sent to this country in 1834, under the patronage of\r\nThiers, then Minister of the Interior, in France, to inspect our public\r\nworks. But attracted by the novel spectacle presented by society in\r\nthe United States, he extended the time of his stay and the sphere of\r\nhis observations amongst us, and spent two years in visiting nearly\r\nall parts of the Union, and studying the workings of our social and\r\npolitical machinery. His letters give the results of his observations,\r\nthe impressions made on his mind, his speculations in regard to the\r\nfuture destiny of our institutions, rather than a detailed narrative\r\nof facts and events, which, however, is introduced when necessary\r\nfor illustration or proof. The translator is not, of course, to be\r\nconsidered responsible for all the opinions and statements of the\r\noriginal; but it will be found, in his judgment, that M. Chevalier has\r\nstudied with diligence and sagacity, drawn his conclusions with caution\r\nand discrimination, and stated his views in a clear, forcible, and\r\ninteresting manner. He seems to be perfectly free from any narrowness\r\nor prejudice, ready to recognise whatever is good or of good tendency,\r\nwhether in character, manners, modes of life, political and social\r\ninstitutions, habits, or opinions, without regard to mere personal\r\nlikes and dislikes; and to be equally frank in condemning, whenever\r\nhe perceives, in our practices, a violation of our own principles, or\r\nof those of an enlightened philosophy. He tells many home truths to\r\nall parties and classes. Some passages of the letters and many of the\r\nnotes, which have no particular interest in this country, have been\r\nomitted. M. Chevalier's work has been very favourably received in his\r\nown country, where it has passed through several editions.\r\n\r\n                                               T. G.

That form of civilization which has prevailed among the European\r\nnations, has moved, in its march over the globe, from east to west.\r\nFrom its cradles in the depths of old Asia and Upper Egypt, it\r\nadvanced, by successive stages, to the shores of the Atlantic, along\r\nwhich it spread itself from the southern point of Spain to the northern\r\nextremity of the British Isles and the Scandinavian peninsula. It\r\nseemed to have here reached its goal when Christopher Columbus showed\r\nit the way to the New World. At each stage it has taken up a new faith,\r\nnew manners, new laws, new customs, a different language, dress, and\r\nfood, different modes of life, public and private. The great questions\r\ntouching the relation of man to God, to his fellows, and to the\r\nuniverse, and domestic, social, and political order, which had all been\r\nsolved at the beginning of the halt, were, after a while, brought again\r\ninto discussion, and then civilization, starting again on her march,\r\nhas moved onward toward the west, to give them a new solution.\r\n\r\nThis stream, setting from the east toward the west, is formed by the\r\njunction of two others flowing from the two great Bible races of Japhet\r\nand Shem; which, coming from the north and the south, meet and mingle\r\ntogether, and are replenished from their respective sources, during\r\neach period of our civilization, through all the episodes, which\r\nobstruct and chequer this majestic pilgrimage. By turns, each of these\r\nforces, whose combined action constitutes the motive power that carries\r\nmankind forward in its course, has been overborne by the other. Thence\r\nit is, that our civilization, instead of advancing in a straight line\r\nfrom east to west, has swerved in its march, either from the north\r\ntoward the south, or from the south toward the north, taking a winding\r\nand devious course, and gathering up, by turns, purer drops from the\r\nblood of Shem or of Japhet. There has been, however, this difference\r\nbetween the North and the South; that the South has most often acted\r\nupon the North by sending to it the germs of civilization, without\r\noverrunning it with a new race; while the North has awakened the\r\nslumbering civilization of the South by pouring over it swarms of hardy\r\nbarbarians, _audax Japeti genus_. Thus is fulfilled the great prophecy\r\nconcerning Japhet, that \"_he shall dwell in the tents of Shem_.\"\r\n\r\n2. Independent of our civilization and distinct from it, there is\r\nanother in the furthest East, whose centre is China, and whose outposts\r\nare Japan, and which embraces its hundreds of millions of men. It\r\nmoves in a direction contrary to our own, from west to east, and its\r\nlocomotive powers are slight; we might compare the respective speed\r\nof these two civilizations to the two great revolutions of the globe,\r\nthe annual revolution in its orbit, and that which gives rise to the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes. This oriental civilization, like that of\r\nthe west, has repeatedly regenerated itself by a new mixture of the\r\nman of the North with the man of the South. The race of Japhet, which\r\ngave us our Barbarians, and, before the Barbarians, had given us the\r\nPelasgians, Scythians, Celts, and Thracians, and has since given us the\r\nTurks and Sclavonians, has also furnished the East with its Mongols\r\nand Manchus. The family of Genghis Khan, which conquered the East, also\r\npushed its victorious hordes, at the same time, to the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern civilization, less active and less easily set in motion\r\nthan the Western, probably because it has not enough of the blood of\r\nShem, and has too much of that of the inferior races, has not risen to\r\nthe same degree of improvement with its sister. But we must do it the\r\njustice to confess, that to it belongs the honor of several capital\r\ninventions and discoveries, such as the mariners' compass, printing,\r\nand gunpowder, on which we pride ourselves; and we must moreover\r\nacknowledge that it has solved the problem, to keep under one law, for\r\nan indefinite number of ages, a population greater than that of all\r\nEurope. The Roman empire, whose population was less than that of China,\r\nstood whole only three hundred years. The spiritual authority of the\r\nPope extended over less territory than that of the Roman empire, and\r\nwas absolutely acknowledged only from Charlemagne to Luther.\r\n\r\n3. The two civilizations, thus gathered together at the two extremities\r\nof the old continent, and turning their backs upon each other, were\r\nseparated by an immense space before the western had fixed itself in\r\nAmerica; now, more than half the intervening distance is passed; Mexico\r\nand South America are covered with offsets from the latter, on the side\r\nwhich looks toward Asia, as well as on that which fronts us: the United\r\nStates cannot long delay to extend themselves from sea to sea; the\r\nIslands of the South Sea are beginning to be peopled by Europeans. From\r\nthis point of view, it is clear that America, placed between the two\r\ncivilizations, is reserved for high destinies, and that the progress of\r\npopulation in the New World is a matter of the deepest interest to the\r\nwhole human race.\r\n\r\nThe connecting of the two civilizations is certainly the broadest\r\nsubject that can occupy the human mind; it is, in the eyes of the\r\nfriend of man, an event of all others most big with hope. It embraces,\r\npolitically, the association of all peoples, the balance of the world,\r\nof which the balance of Europe is only a part; in religion, the whole\r\nlaw of the human family, the true _catholicism_: morally, the most\r\nharmonious reciprocal action of the two opposite natures, which divide\r\neach race, each sex, each people, and each family, and which are\r\ntypified in the Bible by Cain and Abel; intellectually, the complete\r\nencyclopædia and the universal language; industrially, a definite plan\r\nfor developing the resources of the globe. In our time this question\r\nis no longer merely speculative; it is now something more than merely\r\nfood for the dreams of philosophers; it should be the subject of the\r\nmeditations of statesmen.\r\n\r\nSince the age of Louis XIV., the merchants, who are the pioneers of\r\nstate policy, have striven with a constantly increasing ardor, to\r\nopen relations with China, because they have felt the importance of a\r\nregular system of exchanges between Europe and a mass of two hundred\r\nmillion of producers and consumers. The emancipation of North America,\r\nand quite lately the abolition of the English East India Company's\r\nmonopoly, have given to the efforts of commerce an irresistible force;\r\nbefore this power, the laws which close up the celestial empire are\r\nnothing. China is encircled, on the south, by the English and their\r\ntributaries; on the north, by the Cossacks, the van-guard of Russia;\r\nBritish and American fleets prowl along her coasts; the sleepy\r\nSpaniards of Mexico and the Philippines think of the days of the\r\ngalleons, and keep their half-opened eyes fixed upon her. The human\r\nrace has just come into possession of new means of communication, which\r\nshorten distance in an unexpected degree. The two civilizations will\r\nsoon reach each other and mingle together; it will be the greatest\r\nevent in the history of man.\r\n\r\n4. Before the art of navigation was brought to perfection, before\r\nChristopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama, Europe had had communications\r\nwith China through the medium of the Arabs, independently of the\r\ncaravans which traversed Central Asia. The Arabs, conquerors and\r\nmissionaries placed between the two civilizations, had spread\r\nthemselves by turns toward the East and the West. That people, so\r\nactive by starts, has been to the East the messenger of the West, and\r\nto the West, the courier and factor of the East. Unhappily since the\r\nWestern civilization has shone with the greatest brilliancy in Europe,\r\nArabia has flung out but feeble gleams of light; since Providence has\r\nfilled us with a devouring activity, the Arabians are fallen into a\r\ndeep lethargy; on that side, therefore, the intercourse, which was\r\nnever complete nor speedy, has almost ceased. But if, as some suppose,\r\nthe Arab race is about to rouse itself from its long stupor, at the\r\nvoice and by the aid of Europe, the latter will then have a powerful\r\nally in its efforts to seize and hold Asia, or to transmit to her\r\nthe means of working out her own restoration, and this illustrious\r\nrace will thus contribute essentially to the marriage of the two\r\ncivilizations.\r\n\r\n5. Our civilization, in its march westward, has sometimes turned back\r\ntowards the East; thus it has had its Argonauts, its Agamemnons,\r\nand its Alexanders, and more lately its heroes of the crusades and\r\nits Portuguese captains. These partial movements were but temporary\r\ninterruptions of its solemn march toward the West; they were merely\r\ncountercurrents, resembling the eddies which always exist in the\r\ncurrents of rivers. Until our own time, Europe has founded no durable\r\nand important establishment in Asia; in proportion as our civilization\r\nadvanced westwards, the countries which it left behind escaped from its\r\ninfluence, and the distance between it and the oriental civilization,\r\nbecame greater. Alexander is the only person of whom China could feel\r\nany fear, and he passed away like the lightning flash. The Parthians,\r\nthe Saracens, or the Turks, were the impregnable bulwarks of eastern\r\nAsia. The mission of Europe was, above all things, to reach and settle\r\na new hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAt present, the incontestible superiority of the western nations in\r\nwealth, in mechanical skill, in means of transportation, in government,\r\nin the art of war, enables them to make their way across the Old\r\nWorld toward the remotest recesses of Asia. The nations whom we are\r\naccustomed to call oriental, but who are only inhabitants of the\r\n_Lesser East_, have ceased to be formidable adversaries to Europe; they\r\ndelivered up their swords, at Heliopolis, Navarino, and Adrianople. The\r\ncolonization of America is now at length completed from Hudson's Bay to\r\nCape Horn, but Europe can and ought to move towards the East as well\r\nas towards the West; the isthmus of Suez has as good a chance as the\r\nisthmus of Panama, to become the route of western civilization to the\r\n_Greater East_.\r\n\r\n6. Our European civilization has a twofold source, the Romans and\r\nthe Teutonic nations. Setting aside for the present Russia, who is a\r\nnew comer, and who already, however, equals the most powerful of the\r\nelder states, it is subdivided into two families, each of which is\r\nmarked by its strong likeness to one of the mother nations, which have\r\ncontributed to give birth to both. Thus there is the Latin Europe,\r\nand the Teutonic Europe; the former comprises the south, the latter\r\nthe people of the north; the former is Roman Catholic, the latter\r\nProtestant; the one speaks Teutonic languages, and the other, idioms,\r\nin which Latin is predominant. These two branches, Latin and German,\r\nre-appear in the New World; South America, like southern Europe, is\r\nRoman Catholic and Latin; North America belongs to the Protestant\r\nAnglo-Saxon population.\r\n\r\nIn the great enterprise of bringing together European and Asiatic\r\ncivilization, the Teutonic and Latin nations may both find a field of\r\naction; both occupy in Europe and America, by land and sea, admirable\r\noutposts and excellent positions round that imperturbable Asia, into\r\nwhich it is their object to force their way. But, during the last age,\r\nthe superiority which formerly belonged to the Latin family, has passed\r\ninto the hands of the Teutonic race, owing partly to the energy of\r\nEngland in the Old World, and that of her sons in the New, and partly\r\nto the loosening of the old religious and moral ties among the Latin\r\nnations. The Sclavonic race, which has lately shown itself, and which\r\nnow forms a third group of nations in Europe, seems ready to contest\r\nwith the Latin race even the possession of the second rank; it is only\r\nthe Russians and Anglo-Saxons that interest themselves about Further\r\nAsia, and press upon its frontiers by land and by sea. The people of\r\nthe Latin stock must not, however, stand idle in the coming struggle,\r\nor the case will go against them by default; an excellent opportunity\r\nis now offered to regain their lost rank.\r\n\r\n7. In our three-headed Europe, Teutonic, Latin, and Sclavonic, two\r\nnations, France and Austria, present themselves under less distinct\r\nfeatures, and with less exclusive characters than the others. France\r\nshares in the Teutonic and Latin natures; in religion, she is Catholic\r\nin feeling, but Protestant out of caprice; she unites the nervous\r\nunderstanding of the Germans with the elegant taste of the southern\r\nnations. Austria, by the education and origin of the people of her\r\ndifferent states, is half Sclavonic, half Teutonic, and she is\r\nconnected with the Latin family by her religion. France and Austria\r\nare, then, the natural mediums of communication, the one between the\r\nGermans and Latins, and the other between the Germans and Sclavonians;\r\nAustria is chiefly Teutonic, as France is essentially Latin. From this\r\nmixed character of France and Austria, we may conclude, that whenever\r\nthe balance of Europe, or the harmonious combination of all European\r\nnations in one common object, shall become subjects of discussion,\r\nboth will exercise a decisive influence, and their hearty co-operation\r\nin a common cause will make them irresistible. Austria has a more\r\ncentral position than France; she has a greater number of points of\r\ncontact with the different types of western civilization; but France\r\ncombines the invaluable advantages of a more homogeneous constitution,\r\nand a more flexible temperament; she has a physiognomy more strongly\r\nmarked, a mission more clearly defined, and above all, she has more of\r\nthe social spirit. She is at the head of the Latin group; she is its\r\nprotectress.\r\n\r\n8. In the events which seem about to dawn upon us, France may, then,\r\ntake a most important share; she is the depositary of the destinies\r\nof all the Latin nations of both continents. She alone can save the\r\nwhole family from being swallowed up by a double flood of Sclavonians\r\nand Germans. To her it belongs to rouse them from the lethargy into\r\nwhich they are plunged in both hemispheres, to raise them to the level\r\nof other nations, and to enable them again to take a stand in the\r\nworld; she also is called upon, perhaps more than any other power, to\r\nencourage the new spirit, which seems to be re-animating the Arabians,\r\nand through them to shake the East. Thus the political theatre, seen\r\nfrom a French point of view, shows, in a distant back-ground, the\r\nmeeting of the Oriental and the Western civilizations, in which we\r\nare called upon to act as mediators, and in the fore-ground, the\r\neducation, by France, of all the Latin nations, and of many of the Arab\r\ntribes living around the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThere may be a difference of opinion as to the time when these\r\nrevolutions, which are to agitate the depths of Asia, will take place;\r\nI am one of those who think it not far off. I can easily conceive,\r\nalso, that some persons should wish to lessen the circle of French\r\ninfluence, and confine it to the southern countries of Europe; although\r\nto me France seems called upon to exercise a benevolent and wholesome\r\ncare over the people of South America, who are not yet fit to take care\r\nof themselves, and although the old traditions of the crusades, the\r\nconquest of Algiers, and the recollection of the expedition into Egypt,\r\nseem to promise us one of the first parts in the drama which will be\r\nacted on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nAs for the European nations of the Latin family, no one, I suppose, can\r\nhave any doubts concerning our supremacy over them, or concerning our\r\nduties, both to them and to ourselves, in relation to them. We have\r\nbeen notoriously the head of the family since the time of Louis XIV.,\r\nand we can neither shrink from the burdens, nor from the privileges\r\nof our situation. Our superiority is acknowledged by all its members,\r\nour protection has been accepted by all, whenever it has been offered\r\nwithout selfish views. Happy would it have been for France, if, content\r\nwith this high prerogative, her princes, and above all he who has added\r\nnew lustre to the name of Emperor, had not been obstinately bent on the\r\nunnatural purpose of extending their authority over the members of the\r\nTeutonic family!\r\n\r\n9. Since the weight has been thrown into the Saxon scale, since the\r\nEnglish race has overborne France and Spain in Asia, in America, and\r\nin Europe, new institutions, new rules of government, new ideas, new\r\nmodes of action, in social, political, and individual life, have\r\nsprung up among the English, and more especially among their successors\r\nin the New World; everything connected with labor and the condition\r\nof the greater number of working men, has been carried to a degree\r\nof perfection before unheard of. It seems as if, by the aid of these\r\nimprovements, the superiority of the Anglo-Saxons over the Latin\r\nfamily, must go on constantly increasing. The French, of all the Latin\r\nnations, are most favorably placed, and the only one well placed, to\r\navail themselves of these improvements by adapting them to their own\r\nexigencies. We are full of energy; never has our mind been more fairly\r\nthrown open; never were our hearts more ready to throb for noble\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nBut we must set ourselves at work without delay; we must do this,\r\nsetting aside all considerations of general policy, and of the contact,\r\nwhether more or less remote, of the two civilizations. It is a matter\r\nof the last necessity in regard to ourselves, even supposing that we\r\nhave not to transmit to the southern nations of Europe, of whom we are\r\nthe eldest, and to the inhabitants of the Levant, those improvements\r\nwhich their situation demands, and which they are ready to receive at\r\nour hands; our own welfare, our own existence is at stake. How, and\r\nunder what form shall we be able to make the innovations of the English\r\nrace our own? This difficult and complicated question has been the\r\nchief object of my attention during my residence in the New World; I\r\ndo not claim the honor of having even partially solved it. But I shall\r\nfeel satisfied, if the thoughts suggested to me by the sight of an\r\norder of things so unlike our own, falling under the eyes of one more\r\nfar-sighted than myself, shall put him in the way of its solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD FROM LONDON TO PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         LONDON, Nov. 1, 1833.\r\n\r\nWhile railroads are talked of at Paris, they are made here. That\r\nfrom London to Birmingham is already begun; it will be 112 miles in\r\nlength, and all the stock, to the amount of 12,000,000 dollars, has\r\nbeen taken up by subscription; this road will be continued by another\r\nof nearly the same length, from Birmingham to Liverpool, and in five\r\nyears Liverpool and London will be only eight hours apart. Whilst\r\nthe English capitalists are executing these great undertakings, the\r\nParisian capitalists look on, but do not stir; they do not even form\r\nprojects. Not one of them seems to have seriously considered, that even\r\nin the present state of things, there is more than twice the number of\r\ntravellers between Paris and Versailles, than between Liverpool and\r\nManchester, although the railroad between the last named places has\r\nbeen opened three years. In London, therefore, they count little upon\r\nthe aid of French capitalists in the construction of a railroad from\r\nthat city to Paris; they desire it, they would be glad to be able to\r\ngo from one capital to the other in fifteen hours, and at trifling\r\nexpense; all classes are delighted with the idea of such a thing. But\r\nthey feel that such a work is neither expedient nor feasible, without\r\nthe joint action of both nations; and as they dare not hope for the\r\nco-operation of France, little is said about it as a serious affair.\r\n\r\nAmong all the acquisitions, which, since the end of the last century,\r\nhave enriched the domain of science, none has opened a wider field than\r\nVolta's discoveries relative to the motion of electricity, and its\r\ndevelopment by contact. The phenomena resulting from the two poles\r\nof the Voltaic battery offer an inexhaustible mine to the physical\r\nphilosopher; there is no fact in science more general in its nature,\r\nfor if any two bodies whatsoever touch each other, they form at once,\r\nby their mutual action and reaction, a Voltaic pile of greater or less\r\nenergy. This physical fact has its counterpart in the moral order of\r\nthings; if you bring together two men who have hitherto been separated\r\nfrom each other, in however slight a degree they may have any striking\r\nquality, their friction will certainly produce a spark. If instead of\r\ntwo men, the two poles of your battery are two nations, the result\r\nis greater in the proportion of a nation to an individual. If these\r\ntwo nations are England and France, that is to say, the two most\r\nenlightened and most powerful people in the world, this sort of Voltaic\r\nphenomenon then acquires a prodigious intensity; it involves nothing\r\nless than the safety of an old or the creation of a new civilization.\r\n\r\nThe predominant qualities, good or bad, of France and England, may be\r\narranged in a series of parallels, the corresponding terms in each\r\nof which will be complements of each other. England is pre-eminent\r\nin affairs, and the qualities which belong to them, coolness,\r\neconomy, precision, method, perseverance; taste and genius for the\r\nfine arts, with the enthusiasm, the recklessness, the caprice, the\r\nirregular habits, the wastefulness, at least in time and words, which\r\ncharacterise the artist, have fallen to the lot of France. On one\r\nside, is reason, cautious and sober, but sure-footed, good sense,\r\ncreeping along the ground; on the other, imagination with her brilliant\r\naudacity, but also with her ignorance of things and method, her starts\r\nand trips. Here, an admirable energy in struggling against nature\r\nand metamorphosing the physical features of the globe; there, an\r\nunequalled intellectual activity, and the gift of warming the heart of\r\nmankind with its fires. In England, treasures of industry and heaps\r\nof gold; in France, treasures of thought, wells of science, torrents\r\nof inspiration. In proud Albion, staid, but cheerless manners, reserve\r\npushed to a chilling excess; in our fair France, easiness of manners\r\ncarried to licentiousness, the old Gaulish gaiety, often savoring\r\nsomewhat of the camp, a something of the free and easy bordering on the\r\npromiscuous (_un sans-façon expansif qui frise la promiscuité_). On\r\nboth sides a large dose of pride; among our neighbors, a calculating,\r\nambitious pride; the pride of the statesman and the merchant, which\r\nfeeds only on power and wealth; which for the country desires\r\nconquests, vast colonies, all the Gibraltars and St. Helenas, eagle's\r\nnests by which all seas and all shores are commanded; and which for\r\noneself pants for riches, an aristocratic park, a seat in the House\r\nof Lords, a tomb in Westminster Abbey. Amongst us, a vain-glorious\r\npride, which longs for the unreal, for ideal pleasures; a thirst after\r\napplause for self, after glory for our country; a pride, which, for\r\nFrance, would be satisfied with the admiration of the world, for self,\r\nwith castles in the air, a riband, an epaulet, a line of Béranger as a\r\nfuneral oration; the pride of the actor on the stage, of the knight in\r\nthe lists. On the north of the Channel, prevail religion and positive\r\nfaith; on the south, scepticism, mingled with enthusiasm. There a\r\ndeep sentiment of order and respect for rank, combined with a haughty\r\nfeeling of the dignity of man; here, a people eager for equality,\r\nexcitable, restless, turbulent, yet docile, often even to weakness,\r\nconfiding, even to credulity, easily cajoled by its flatterers,\r\nsubmitting to be trampled under foot like a carcase, during the period\r\nof its lethargy, and at times given over to the most courtier-like\r\nobsequiousness. Among the English the reverence for tradition, among\r\nthe French the passion for novelty, predominates; among the former\r\nrespect for the law, and obedience to man, on condition that his\r\nsupreme rule shall be the law; among the latter, the worship of great\r\nmen, and submission to the laws if they are defended by the sword of\r\nCæsar. On one side the ruler of the seas, on the other the arbiter of\r\nthe continent, rousing the world at their pleasure, the one by its\r\nlever of gold, the other by the sound of its voice alone. Surely from\r\nthe reciprocal influences of two nations thus constituted and thus\r\nsituated on the globe, the most important effects should result, not\r\nonly on the general cause of civilization, but on their own mutual\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThe industrial development is not, indeed, the development of the whole\r\nman, but since the beginning of the nineteenth century, no people can\r\nbe allowed to reckon itself in the first rank of nations, if it is not\r\nadvanced in the industrial career, if it cannot labor and produce. No\r\npeople will be powerful that is not rich, and there is now no other way\r\nof growing rich but by work. In regard to production and labor, we have\r\nmuch to learn from England, and it is a lesson which is to be learned\r\nby the eyes rather than by the ears, by observation better than by\r\nreading. If, then, there were a railroad between London and Paris, the\r\nFrench, who have now little knowledge of business, would go to London,\r\nwhere the instinct of method is in the blood, to learn. Our speculators\r\nwould go to see how simply, promptly, and plainly great enterprises are\r\ncarried on; our shop-keepers and buyers have to learn from England that\r\nto overcharge and to haggle have no connexion with buying and selling\r\nadvantageously; our capitalists and merchants, that there can be no\r\ndurable commercial prosperity nor security for capital, where there\r\nis no system of credit; they would see the operations of the Bank of\r\nEngland with its branches and the private banks, and perhaps they might\r\nbe incited to bring home, with the needful modification, institutions\r\nand practices so profitable at once to the share holders and to\r\nthe public. They would here imbibe the spirit of association, which\r\nin London sweats at every pore.[A] All of us might here see in what\r\nconsists and how is realised, that comfort, that care of the person, so\r\nessential to the peace and quiet of one's life, and Paris might perhaps\r\nbe led to free itself from the filth of centuries, which formerly\r\ngave it its name, and against which eighteen hundred years later,\r\nVoltaire, whom the ancient monarchy and the faith of our fathers could\r\nnot withstand, warred in vain. As we are full of self-love, we should\r\nreturn from England ashamed of the wretched state of our agriculture,\r\nour roads, and our elementary schools, humbled at the insignificance of\r\nour foreign commerce, and solicitous to vie with our neighbors. I need\r\nnot stop to point out what the English might come to seek among us,\r\nthey are already converts in this matter, they swarm in Paris, while\r\nit would be easy to count up the Frenchmen who have been in London.\r\nWithout saying what the English would get in Paris, I may affirm that\r\nthey would leave plenty of sovereigns there. To Paris, the city of\r\npleasures, the terrestrial paradise of strangers, the railroad would be\r\na gold mine, and the English, getting familiar with France, would find\r\nprofitable investments for their capital among us, which would give\r\nlife and energy to useful enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe railroad from London to Paris would be a commercial enterprise of\r\nthe first importance; it would also be a political instrument, a strong\r\nbond of union between England and France. But it is more especially as\r\na means of education, that it should be most highly recommended, for\r\nthere is no fear that the other points of view will be overlooked. The\r\nindustrial arts, I said before, are learned chiefly through the eyes;\r\nthis is particularly true in regard to the operatives, for in them,\r\nowing to their manner of life, the world of sensation prevails over\r\nthe world of ideas. Now the progress of the mechanical arts depends\r\nnot less on the workmen than on the foremen and superintendents of\r\nthe works; it would be expedient, therefore, to send a certain number\r\nof picked operatives to pass a suitable time in England, just as the\r\nBoard of Public Works (_Ponts et Chaussées_) is now in the habit of\r\nsending a few engineers thither. The railroad, by reducing the expense\r\nand trouble of the journey, would probably furnish an opportunity of\r\ndespatching companies of artisans selected from among those most worthy\r\nof the privilege. According to the plan of a merchant of Lyons, a\r\nvery sensible man, this might be done on a large scale and at little\r\nexpense; and he further proposed a system of reciprocity, by which\r\nEnglish workmen should be employed in France and French operatives in\r\nEngland. It is not impossible that this project may one day be made the\r\nbasis of a new law, designed to further the views of our excellent law\r\nof primary education; but the railroad between London and Paris must\r\nfirst be constructed.\r\n\r\nOf the small number of Frenchmen who have visited England,[B] very\r\nfew have been led by motives of business. Most have undertaken the\r\nvoyage from vague feelings of curiosity, or merely for pleasure; and\r\nthe objects of their notice have been the picturesque, the poetical.\r\nThey have visited the Gothic ruins of the monasteries and castles,\r\nthe cave of Fingal, and the lakes of Scotland, admired the costume of\r\nthe Highlanders, the horses and jockeys of the great lords, and the\r\nblooming complexion of the women. They have walked through one or two\r\nparks, visited the hot-houses where all the plants of the world are\r\ncollected, braving, behind the glass, the cloudy sky of Great Britain.\r\nThey have been through the dockyards and military arsenals, when\r\nthey could get leave, under the escort of a sergeant, seen the young\r\nbeauties of Almacks and the old curiosities of the Tower, and travelled\r\nover England, just as they would make the tour of Italy or Switzerland.\r\nIf the subject of industry has occupied their attention a moment, it\r\nis only in reference to the fashion of some opera decoration. They\r\nhave, to be sure, stood amazed at the thousands of vessels whose masts\r\nstretch out of sight along the Thames or in the docks;[C] they have\r\nbeen delighted with the extent of the great manufacturing towns, the\r\nmagnitude of the manufactories, and the height of their chimneys, with\r\nthe magical brilliancy of the gas-lights, with the daring bridges of\r\nstone or iron, and with the fantastical appearance of the forge-fires\r\nin the night. But they have never asked, how came England to have\r\nsuch a vast number of ships, how has she multiplied and extended her\r\nmanufactures to such an amazing degree, and how created these towns,\r\nso simple in their architecture, but so fastidiously neat in their\r\nspacious streets; they have not thought to ask the causes of all this\r\nwealth and prosperity.\r\n\r\nYet he who expects to return satisfied from England should visit her\r\nas the Queen of industry; he should see the city rather than Regent's\r\nPark, the East India House rather than Windsor Castle, seek out the\r\nBank before St. Paul's, the Clearing House before Somerset House,\r\ntake more interest in the docks and Commercial House, than in the\r\narmor preserved in the Tower. He should go to the warehouses, the\r\ncounting-houses, the workshops, in pursuit of the genius of Great\r\nBritain. He must tear himself from the magnificent hospitality of\r\nthe English country seats, and give up his time to the mines and the\r\nforges, which furnish industry with its daily bread, its coal and iron.\r\n(Notes 1 and 2 at the end of the volume.) He must mingle with the stout\r\nand active workmen, quite as much as with the more refined society in\r\nthe saloons of the nobility. For myself, I have found nothing in London\r\nwhich has struck me as more original, and given me greater pleasure,\r\nthan a shop in Old Change, whose ware-rooms contain twenty times as\r\nmany goods as the largest warehouse in Paris, and whose business\r\ntransactions amount to two millions sterling a year, and the great\r\nbrewery of Barclay, Perkins & Co. near London Bridge, the order and\r\narrangement of which are still more striking than its vast extent.\r\n\r\nAs I stood in this brewery, on a floor on which, distributed in\r\ndifferent rooms, there were ninetynine vats, some of them holding\r\n500,000 or 600,000 bottles, I thought of the famous Heidelberg tun\r\nwhich I had seen some years ago. It is the only object in a tolerable\r\nstate of preservation in the delicious chateau of the Palatine\r\ncounts, and it is faithfully visited by all travellers who go to see\r\nthat fine ruin, perhaps the finest relic of the feudal times. What a\r\ndifference now between the old chateau of Heidelberg with its tun, and\r\nthe colossal establishment of the English brewer with its regiment of\r\ntuns! The old castle crumbles to pieces; the rich Gothic sculptures are\r\nwearing away. In vain has a French artist (and, strange coincidence!\r\nthat artist himself another relic of the feudal age, an _émigré_, who\r\nwith a praiseworthy zeal has been for a long time the self-constituted\r\nguardian of this fine old monument,) in vain has he urged the\r\ngovernment of Baden, to whom the castle belongs, to take some measures\r\nfor its preservation. Each year some new dilapidation is caused by the\r\nfrosts of winter and the storms of autumn; the old chateau will soon\r\nbecome a shapeless mass, the very stones will probably be sold, and\r\nnothing will remain, but the drawings of M. de Graimbert, to show what\r\nit has been. The Knights' Hall is stripped of its roof--the arches,\r\nwhich support the superb terrace whence the eye wanders over the lovely\r\nvale of the Neckar and its beautiful heights,--those arches, rent by\r\nthe powder of Louvois,--will some day sink. Meanwhile, the brewery\r\nis enriched one day with a new building, and the next, with a new\r\nsteam-engine; and in case of any damage by fire, as recently happened,\r\nthe loss is immediately repaired; in the place of the building\r\ndestroyed by the flames, rises one more splendid, in which the free use\r\nof iron will be a protection against new ravages.\r\n\r\nThe statues of the Palatine electors are overthrown in their niches;\r\nno son of their vassals will set them up again; but at the brewery\r\neverything is in perfect order; each tool hangs on its nail, each\r\nkettle is kept well-rubbed and bright. The stables of the noble prince\r\nare a heap of ruins; in the stables of the brewer, rivalling those\r\nof Chantilly, where the great Condé entertained kings, one hundred\r\nand fifty horses, fit steeds for Goliath, are objects of as careful\r\nattention, as those, perhaps, which surrounded the persons of the first\r\nElectors and their gallant knights. The old tun has been empty for a\r\ncentury and a half; the curious may enter it, and take its measure;\r\nonce only has M. de Graimbert seen it spout wine; it was in 1813,\r\nin honour of the emperor Alexander and his allies, the sovereigns\r\nof Austria and Prussia. Even then it was only a pious fraud, the old\r\ntun was not full, the wine flowed from a base barrel which had been\r\nstuck in it the night before. The ninetynine vats of Barclay, Perkins\r\n& Co. are always full of beer; that which is daily drawn off, and\r\nsent all over the United Kingdom and North America, and finds its way\r\neven to the East Indies, would fill the classical tun of the Palatine\r\nCasimir.[D] The secret of this contrast may easily be explained; the\r\ngreat feudal tun could only be filled by the produce of the feudal\r\nimpositions, whilst the vats of the brewery are filled by the voluntary\r\nco-operation of three hundred men, sure of gathering daily the fruits\r\nof their industry; the Heidelberg tun was emptied only to administer\r\nto the pleasures of the prince or his favorites, while the vats of the\r\nbrewer quench the thirst of a numerous population, which works hard,\r\nreceives good pay, and pays its providers well.\r\n\r\nThe silence and desolation of the old castle, contrasted with the\r\nbustle and prosperity of the English brewery, are a striking emblem of\r\nthe feudal system compared with the modern power of peace and creative\r\nindustry. All nations, in proportion as they have the power to change\r\nthe warlike qualities of the feudal age into the useful qualities of\r\nthe labourer, or as they want the capacity thus to re-cast themselves,\r\nmay read their own destiny, either in the state of the flourishing\r\nmanufactory, or in that of the deserted and crumbling castle. Happy the\r\npeople, who, like France and England, have had strength to shake off\r\nthe past, and who, in the quiet enjoyment of their liberties, have only\r\nto concern themselves about the future! Woe to that people, which will\r\nnot, or cannot, tear itself away from the past! That people is worn\r\nout; it will die of consumption, and will leave behind nothing but\r\nruins, poetical, perhaps, but still none the less ruins, that is, death\r\nand desolation: unless indeed a new blood be infused into its veins, or\r\nin other words, unless it be conquered like unhappy Poland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Thus the London merchants dispense with the care, trouble,\r\nand expense of a money-chest on their own premises, and all money\r\noperations are transacted by a small number of bankers at the _Clearing\r\nHouse_. The amount of these transactions often rises to fifteen\r\nmillions sterling [a day], independently of those which are not\r\nstrictly commercial, and of those of the retailers, which do not pass\r\nthrough the hands of bankers. See _Babbage's Economy of Machinery_.\r\n\r\n[B] The whole number of passengers to and from Calais, through which\r\nmost of the travellers between England and France pass, is only about\r\nforty thousand yearly. This is not more than the number passing between\r\nHavre and New York.\r\n\r\n[C] It is estimated that 25,000 vessels enter the port of London yearly.\r\n\r\n[D] 50,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL AND THE RAILROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      LIVERPOOL, NOV. 7, 1833.\r\n\r\nI have just come back from Manchester by the railroad, which is a fine\r\npiece of work; I know of nothing that gives a higher idea of the power\r\nof man. There are impressions which one cannot describe; such is that\r\nof being hurried along at the rate of half a mile a minute, or thirty\r\nmiles an hour (the speed of the train as we started from Manchester,)\r\nwithout being the least incommoded, and with the most complete feeling\r\nof security, for only one accident has happened since the opening\r\nof the road, and that was owing to the imprudence of the individual\r\nwho perished. You pass over and under roads, rivers, and canals; you\r\ncross other railroads, and a great number of other roads, without any\r\ntrouble or confusion. The great forethought and spirit of order which\r\nin England they suck in with their mothers' milk, preside in every\r\npart, and make it impossible that the trains should fall foul of each\r\nother, or that the cars should run down unlucky travellers, or the\r\nfarmers' wagons; all along the route are gates, which open and shut at\r\nthe precise moment of time, and watchmen on the look out. How many\r\npersons in France would be benefitted by this short trip, did it serve\r\nonly as a lesson of order and forecast! And then the Mount Olive cut is\r\nas well worth seeing as Roland's Breach; the Wapping tunnel will bear\r\na comparison with the caves of Campan; the dike across Chat Moss seems\r\nto me as full of interest as the remains of the most famous Roman ways,\r\nnot excepting even the Appian itself; and there is a column, which,\r\nthough only a chimney for a steam-engine, is not, perhaps, less perfect\r\nin its proportions than Pompey's Pillar. Many tourists, even persons\r\nwho have not been made weary of sight-seeing in Switzerland and Italy,\r\nwould find Chester Bridge, which is not, indeed, on the road, but is\r\nnevertheless very near it, quite as worthy of a visit as the Devil's\r\nBridge; not to mention that the burning cinders which the engine\r\nstrews along the route, might suggest to the traveller, without any\r\ngreat stretch of fancy, the idea of being transported in a fiery car,\r\ncertainly the most poetical of all vehicles.\r\n\r\nThose who doubt the policy of introducing railroads into France, and\r\nthink it prudent to wait for more light, cite, among other arguments,\r\nthe experiments continually making in England to apply locomotive\r\nengines to common roads, the success of which, they think, would save\r\nthe expense of rails. There is no doubt that railroads, like every\r\nother new invention, are susceptible of improvement; but they will\r\nalways be expensive, and while other nations keep up such _schools_\r\nas the Manchester and Liverpool railroad, and we stand looking on\r\nwith folded arms, we shall soon find ourselves, by excess of caution,\r\nfallen behind all Europe in manufactures and commerce. As for the\r\nsteam-engines of Gurney, Dance, or anybody else, there is no hope\r\nthat they will enable us to save the expense of rails. I think it,\r\nindeed, very probable that engines may be made to take the place of\r\nhorses on roads kept in such a state as the English highways; but\r\nupon any road whatsoever, and whatever motive power is employed,\r\nengines or horses, in order to reach a great speed, from twentyfive\r\nto thirty miles an hour, for instance, it is absolutely necessary to\r\ncut through hills, and to fill up or bridge over the valleys, just\r\nas is done for railroads. Besides this great speed forbids the free\r\ncirculation of vehicles, and makes it necessary to avoid the level\r\nof the frequented routes, and to pass over or under them by means of\r\ntunnels or bridges. None of the inconveniences, or liabilities of\r\nrailroads would be avoided by this system; the expense would be almost\r\nthe same, for the most costly portion of the work in railroads is the\r\ncuts and embankments, the bridges and viaducts; the iron required for\r\nthe rails forms less than one-third of the expenditure. The expenses\r\nof superintending the routes would be the same. Besides, the road\r\nonce graded, there would be a great gain in laying rails, that is,\r\nin making a complete railroad, however little might be the amount of\r\ntransportation; for on a Macadamised road the force of friction is\r\nten times that on iron rails, so that the use of these new locomotive\r\ncarriages can never supply the place of railways.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of these views is proved by what is now doing in\r\nEngland; while the new steam carriages are getting ready for regular\r\nservice, railroad companies are already at work or are organizing\r\nin all quarters. Two works are now in progress which will connect\r\nLiverpool with London, by way of Birmingham; the whole length will\r\nbe one hundred and ninety-five miles. Although a trial of the new\r\ncarriages is making on the Birmingham road, shares in the railroad\r\nbetween that town and London are at a high premium. Another company\r\nis preparing to construct a railroad from London to Bath and Bristol,\r\na distance of one hundred and fifteen miles; companies are also\r\nformed for connecting London with Southampton, on the Havre route to\r\nParis, and with Brighton, on the Dieppe route; other shorter works\r\nare projected. It is not that the experiments of Gurney and Dance are\r\nunknown or slighted; on the contrary, their importance is fully felt;\r\nthe newspapers are full of them, and they even excite some enthusiasm.\r\nIn this country, where it is a settled maxim that the labourer is\r\nworthy of his hire, I saw vessels all along the road which had been\r\ngratuitously brought and filled by the inhabitants for the use of one\r\nof these steam-carriages; unluckily the carriage did not arrive when it\r\nwas expected; it had got out of order, as it too often does.\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool and Manchester railroad owes its brilliant success to the\r\nsubstantial and permanent nature of the interest which binds together\r\nthe two towns. It would be impossible to realize a more complete\r\ndivision of labor; Manchester, with the country twenty miles round\r\nit, is nothing but a workshop; Liverpool manufactures nothing, but\r\nmerely sells what her neighbours produce. Liverpool is not, whatever\r\nthe guide book may say, another Venice, rising from the waves; it\r\nis a counting-house, and nothing but a counting-house, though on a\r\nvast scale, and under the most perfect regulations, of any in the\r\nworld. The business is all done in a space smaller than the _Place du\r\nCarrousel_, where are the handsome Exchange, the Town House, and all\r\nthe banking houses, &c. At four or five o'clock each one shuts up his\r\ncell (for the offices deserve this name), and retires to his house or\r\nhis country seat, for many of the residences are on the other side of\r\nthe Mersey. Liverpool and Manchester are surrounded by a double and\r\nthree fold series of canals; the Duke of Bridgewater's canal, the Leeds\r\nand Liverpool, the Sankey, Leigh, Bolton and Bury, Mersey and Irwell\r\ncanals, without taking into account the rivers Irwell, Mersey, and\r\nWeaver, which though small, form fine bays at their mouths, and are\r\nmore easily and regularly navigable than our great rivers, while the\r\nnavigation is carried on with a promptitude and despatch wholly unknown\r\nin France. Since the peace these two towns have enjoyed such a high\r\ndegree of prosperity, that ten years ago these means of communication,\r\nwith the addition of a fine road, were found to be insufficient. The\r\ncounting-house and the manufactory wished to be nearer to each other;\r\naccordingly, on the 10th of May, 1824, a memorial, signed by one\r\nhundred and fifty merchants, declared the necessity of new routes; and\r\na railroad was decided on. The work was begun in June, 1826, and the\r\nroad was opened in due form, on the 15th of September, 1830. A tunnel\r\nis now constructing, one mile and a quarter in length, which will carry\r\nthe railroad into the heart of the town, and will cost about 800,000\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe chief article of English commerce, that in which it has no rival,\r\nand which opens all the ports of the world to English vessels, is\r\ncottons of all descriptions. The value of the produce and manufactures\r\nannually exported from the United Kingdom, during the last ten years,\r\nhas averaged 190 millions of dollars.[E] That of cottons alone has\r\nranged from 80 to 90 millions, and the greater part is made in\r\nManchester and the vicinity.[F] This single fact would sufficiently\r\nexplain the commercial importance of Liverpool; add to this that\r\nLiverpool is in the neighbourhood of the founderies and forges of\r\nStaffordshire and Shropshire, and the manufactories of Birmingham\r\nand Sheffield; that the diminished width of the island, in the 53d\r\ndegree of latitude, enables her to reach out her hands at once to the\r\neastern and western coasts; that she is the centre of the business\r\nbetween England and Ireland; that she approaches, at the same time,\r\nScotland and Wales; that she is the head quarters of steam navigation\r\nin England, and it will be seen at a glance that Liverpool is the seat\r\nof a prodigious commerce, inferior only to that of London. Eleven\r\nthousand vessels measuring 1,400,000 tons, enter her nine docks every\r\nyear; two-fifths of the whole exports of England are shipped hence, and\r\nmore than one-fifth of the British customs duty, or nearly 20,000,000\r\ndollars (equal to the total sum of the French customs), are collected\r\nhere. Since the modification of the East India Company's charter, the\r\nLiverpool merchants flatter themselves with the hope of securing a\r\ngreat part of the India trade, which has hitherto been monopolized by\r\nLondon; they aspire to rival the commerce of the capital, and it must\r\nbe confessed that they are taking the right road to success.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the history of Liverpool, Manchester, or any other English\r\ntown, we are struck with a fact which is full of good omen for France;\r\nit is this, that a people never engages heartily and successfully in\r\ncommerce and manufactures, until it feels itself safe from civil or\r\nreligious despotism; but once assured on that point, it moves rapidly\r\nand right forward in its industrial career. So long as England was\r\nrestrained in her franchises or her faith, she was possessed with one\r\nidea, how to throw off the yoke; once freed from this care, she has\r\nachieved in the different branches of industry what no nation has ever\r\ndone before. In the beginning of the last century, not long after the\r\nexpulsion of the Stuarts, when Liverpool had only 5,000 inhabitants,\r\nwith no commerce but a feeble coasting trade, some of her merchants\r\nconceived the idea of competing with Bristol, which then monopolized\r\nthe West Indian trade. Bristol exported to America the products of\r\nthe fisheries in the German Ocean, and some fustians and checks\r\nmanufactured in Germany, and the Liverpool adventurers took cargoes\r\nof Scotch stuffs; but the attempt was unsuccessful, the Scotch goods\r\nwere of inferior quality. Manchester then relieved them from this\r\ndifficulty; there were already some manufacturers in that place, who\r\nimitated and surpassed the German articles, and thus provided, the\r\nmerchants of Liverpool were able to sustain a competition with those of\r\nBristol. The smuggling trade with the Spanish colonies, and the slave\r\ntrade, undertaken in competition with Bristol, continued to enrich\r\nLiverpool and consequently Manchester. In 1764, when Bristol fitted\r\nout 32 ships for Africa and 74 for America, Liverpool ran 105 to the\r\nformer and 141 to the latter; in the same year 1589 vessels entered\r\nthe port of Liverpool, while only 675 arrived at Bristol. At present\r\nBristol is a second-rate mart compared with Liverpool; not that the\r\nformer has declined; on the contrary, it is a wealthy city, with a\r\ntrade tenfold what it was a hundred years ago. But in the midst of the\r\ngeneral progress, Liverpool has advanced at high speed. It now contains\r\n180,000 inhabitants, or, including the suburbs, 225,000, without\r\nreckoning the floating population of strangers and sailors. During\r\nthe siege of Calais, when Edward III. collected all the strength of\r\nEngland, this town found it difficult to furnish one vessel, carrying\r\nsix men; in 1829, it owned 806 vessels of 161,780 tons burthen, manned\r\nby 9,091 sailors. (See Note 4, at the end of the volume.) During the\r\nwars of the French Revolution, Liverpool was able to bear her share\r\nof the burdens of the country, and to spend 170,000 dollars annually\r\nin works of public utility and in embellishing the town. In 1797 she\r\nvolunteered to raise a troop of horse and eight companies of foot at\r\nher own charge; in 1798 she raised a regiment of volunteers and the\r\nsum of 80,000 dollars, and in 1803, when Napoleon threatened England\r\nwith invasion, two regiments of infantry and 600 artillerists. In the\r\nsame period a host of useful and charitable institutions were founded\r\nby subscription, and the Exchange was built at the cost of 600,000\r\ndollars. All this is the work of one century; hardly had James II.\r\nreached Saint Germain, when the first dock in Liverpool was opened;\r\nwithin thirty years the Mersey and Irwell were canalled. It was the\r\nsame throughout England. We must not exaggerate and abuse historical\r\nparallels, but, unless we shut our eyes, it is impossible not to\r\nperceive a striking analogy between the state of England after the\r\nfall of the Stuarts, and that of France since 1830. With both people\r\nthere is a feeling of profound security in regard to their liberties,\r\na deep conviction that they have gained a decisive victory, and that\r\nthey have nothing to fear from the encroachments of the civil power\r\nor of a religious corporation; the same wish to see political reforms\r\ngives rise to substantial and palpable improvement in the condition of\r\nthe people, and the same disposition on the part of the government to\r\nenlighten and realize the popular will.\r\n\r\nThe old dynasties of England and France fell in consequence of their\r\nefforts to give political power to the clergy, rather than from any\r\nattempt to restore the feudal system with its brutality and its\r\nrapacity; for the deposed princes themselves were neither rapacious nor\r\nviolent. The English revolution, however, was far from giving birth to\r\nirreligion; Liverpool,--which is, so to speak, of to-day, which bears\r\nthe stamp, not of England as she was in the sixteenth or the fourteenth\r\ncentury, but of England as she was in the eighteenth century, as she\r\nis in our own time,--Liverpool is a proof of this. There is no town\r\nin France which numbers as many churches as Liverpool, where there\r\nare thirty-seven of the establishment, in addition to forty-three\r\ndissenters' chapels and meeting houses, Presbyterian, Baptist,\r\nMethodist, Unitarian, Quaker, Jewish, and Roman Catholic; the last\r\nhave here five chapels. Most of these have been built since 1750, and\r\nnearly one half since 1800; I have a list under my eye, and the dates\r\nare 1803, 1810, 1813, 1814, 1815, 1815, 1815, 1816, 1821, 1826, 1826,\r\n1827, 1827, 1830, 1831. Are we to believe that this analogy will hold\r\ngood on our own soil, and that as she grows rich by industry, France\r\nwill return to the religious sentiment? I wish it, I hope it; we are\r\nalready past the time when atheism was fashionable in France; it will\r\nnot, however, be under the flag of the Anglican church, or of any other\r\nprotestant sect that France will rally; she must have a more imposing\r\nand pompous worship.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] The annual exports of France are little more than half this sum.\r\n(See Note 3, at the end of the volume.)\r\n\r\n[F] The population of Lancashire, in which are situated Liverpool\r\nand Manchester, increased, between 1801 and 1831, from 672,731 to\r\n1,336,854, that is, it doubled. The increase of population in the rest\r\nof the United Kingdom was only fifty per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nWAR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES UPON THE BANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    NEW YORK, JANUARY 1, 1834.\r\n\r\nThis country is now in the crisis of a high industrial fever, which\r\nhas assumed a political character, and is of a very serious nature;\r\nfor the industrial interest, in this country, is the most important.\r\nLast year, when the dispute between the Northern and Southern States,\r\nrelative to the tariff was settled, (see Note 5, at the end of the\r\nvolume,) the wise and prudent thanked God, that the danger, which\r\nhad threatened their country, had been averted; there seemed to them\r\nnothing further to obstruct its triumphant career of conquests over\r\nnature, with an ever accelerated rapidity and increased success. A\r\nseries of causes, to appearance of slight moment, has changed these\r\nhopes into fears. Some trifling circumstances revived the old quarrel\r\nbetween the democratic party, to which the President belongs, and the\r\nBank of the United States, and both sides grew warm. (See Note 6, at\r\nthe end of the volume.) President Jackson, a man of good intentions\r\nand ardent patriotism, but too hasty towards those who venture to\r\ncontradict him, declared a deadly war against the Bank, and pushed it\r\nwith all the energy and fury, in the same cut-and-thrust style, that\r\nhe had the war against the Indians and English twenty years before.\r\nHe set his veto to the bill that had passed both houses of Congress,\r\nrenewing the Bank charter, which was about to expire in three years.\r\nNot satisfied with this blow, he withdrew from the hands of the Bank\r\nthe public money, which, by the provisions of its charter, had been\r\ndeposited in them, and which gave it the means of very materially\r\nextending its operations; for the excess of the deposits over the\r\nexigencies of the government amount to not less than ten millions. The\r\nBank, which had paid to the government a bonus of 1,500,000 dollars\r\nfor the privilege of being the depository of the public funds, cried\r\nout loudly against this measure, and with good reason, for no one\r\ndenies, that no institution in the union is better able to meet all\r\nits liabilities. It has reduced its discounts, first, because the\r\nremoval of the public deposits has diminished the amount of specie in\r\nits vaults, and also, as it declares, whether right or wrong, because\r\nits very existence being threatened by the President's veto, it is\r\nprudent to restrain the sphere of its operations, and to prepare in\r\ntime for the final settlement of its concerns. As this institution\r\ntakes the lead in the financial world, the other banks, even those to\r\nwhich the public deposits have been transferred, have been obliged, in\r\ntheir turn, to restrict their operations. Not only are they afraid to\r\nextend their discounts in proportion to the amount of these deposits,\r\nbut they are obliged to contract them, because they find themselves,\r\nas objects of the favour of government in this respect, in a state of\r\nhostility with the Bank of the United States, and it is necessary to be\r\non their guard in the presence of so formidable an adversary. Thus are\r\nthe sources of credit suddenly dried up. Now credit is the life-blood\r\nof the prosperity of the United States; without credit, the populous\r\ntowns which are springing up on all sides, as if by magic, the opulent\r\nStates, which, far away from the Atlantic and beyond the Alleghanies,\r\nstretch along the Ohio and the Mississippi, would become a solitary\r\nwilderness, savage forests or pathless swamps. The city of New York\r\nalone has twenty banks, the annual average discounts of which, during\r\nthe last eight years, have amounted to one hundred millions. At Paris,\r\nwhere the transactions are certainly more extensive than in New York,\r\nthe discounts of the Bank of France, in 1831, amounted to 223 million\r\nfrancs, and in 1832 to 151 millions.[G] The amount of the discounts\r\nof the Philadelphia banks, in 1831, was 150 millions. A general shock\r\nto credit, however transient, is here more terrible than the most\r\nfrightful earthquake.\r\n\r\nIf I did not fear to lengthen out this letter beyond measure, I would\r\ngive some details concerning the struggle between the two parties,\r\nconcerning their tactics and their measures in Congress and out of it,\r\nconcerning Mr Clay's speeches and General Jackson's home thrusts. But I\r\nthink it more important at present, to call your attention to the part\r\nwhich the Bank of the United States has played since its establishment,\r\nand to the causes which stirred up against it that mass of hatred\r\nand distrust, from which General Jackson derives confidence in his\r\nmeasures. For it is not merely his own dislike that he gratifies;\r\nfrom the last elections, which in almost all the States are based on\r\nuniversal suffrage, it is plain that the numerical majority of the\r\npopulation is, at this moment, opposed to the Bank.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had already used and abused systems of credit while under\r\nthe English rule. As soon as they had achieved their independence,\r\nthey became bolder in their enterprises, more sanguine, or, if you\r\nplease, more rash in their speculations. They stood in great need of\r\ncredit; the number of banks was multiplied, and many abuses crept in.\r\nThe State legislatures made no difficulty in granting bank-charters\r\nto whoever asked for them, and in this respect they have not changed\r\ntheir practice. If they imposed some restraints, they had no means of\r\nascertaining or securing their strict observance. The banks, therefore,\r\noften issued an amount of bills wholly disproportionate to their\r\nreal capital, not merely twice or thrice, but ten times the value\r\nof their specie and other means. The originators of the bank often\r\nchose themselves directors, and discounted no paper but their own, or\r\nrather they lent to themselves the whole circulation of the bank, on\r\nthe bare deposit of the bank shares. This was an ingenious process to\r\nenable whoever pleased to coin current money, without ingots of gold\r\nor silver. The mismanagement of these banking companies has sometimes\r\nbeen such, that instances have occurred where the officers of the\r\nbank have, on their own authority, opened a credit for themselves,\r\nand generally admitted their friends to share in the privilege. Thus\r\nit was discovered, that the cashier of the City Bank in Baltimore had\r\nlent himself 166,548 dollars, and had made loans to one of his friends\r\nto the amount of 185,382 dollars; all the other officers had taken the\r\nsame liberty, with the exception of one clerk and the porter.\r\n\r\nThe banks abusing the privilege of issuing bills, that is to say of\r\nmaking loans, individuals abused the privilege of borrowing; hence\r\nmad speculations, and consequently losses by the lender and borrower.\r\nThe banks cloaked theirs by new issues of paper, individuals theirs\r\nby new loans; but there were many failures of speculators, and some\r\nof banks. The latter excited the public indignation without reforming\r\nany one. The honest and moderate working classes, the farmers[H]\r\nand mechanics, who found that in the end they were the dupes of the\r\nspeculators, since by the depreciation of the paper money, which they\r\nhad taken as so much specie, they came in for a share of the loss,\r\nbut had no part in the gain, that is, in the dividends, conceived a\r\nviolent hatred against the banking system. To this particular cause\r\nof dislike, was added that aversion which may be found in Europe and\r\neverywhere else, felt by persons of methodical habits, gaining little\r\nby hard labour, but gaining regularly, against those who are impatient\r\nto make their fortune, and to make it at all events, and who waste\r\nwhat they make in the most unbounded luxury and by the most foolish\r\nenterprises, in less time than they have been in acquiring it. Then\r\nthere was the natural jealousy of simplicity against cunning, of slow\r\nand heavy minds against the shrewd penetration of others. There was\r\nalso that suspicious distrust of all new influences, and all power that\r\naims to strike its roots deep, a distrust, which is essential to the\r\nAmerican, and which is the source, explanation, and safeguard of his\r\nrepublican institutions. In short, in 1811, when the old Bank of the\r\nUnited States, which was on a much smaller scale than the present Bank,\r\npetitioned Congress for a renewal of its charter, an appeal was made to\r\nthe farmers and mechanics, and, as at the present day, the hobgoblin of\r\n_a new aristocracy, and the worst of all, an aristocracy of money_, was\r\nsummoned up; the petition was not granted.\r\n\r\nSoon after, in 1812, war broke out between England and the United\r\nStates. The natural effect of war is to diminish confidence, to\r\nmake the merchants timid, speculators cautious. Most of the banks,\r\nhaving been managed with little prudence in better times, were soon\r\nunable to meet the call for specie by the public; they solicited and\r\nobtained from their respective legislatures leave to suspend specie\r\npayments. Their bills had a forced circulation. At the peace of 1815\r\nthe banks were not able to resume specie payments, and the system of\r\ninconvertible paper money was persevered in. Imagine then two hundred\r\nand forty-six classes of paper money,[I] circulating side by side,\r\nhaving all degrees of value, according to the good or bad credit of the\r\nbank which issued them, at 20 per cent., 30 per cent., or 50 per cent.\r\ndiscount. Gold and silver had entirely disappeared; there was no longer\r\nany standard of price and value; the amount of bills in circulation\r\nhad become prodigious.[J] To the bills of the banks was added a great\r\namount of individual obligations of still less value, issued by private\r\npersons as suited their wants, and which circulated more or less freely\r\nin the neighbourhood. It was a frightful scene of confusion, a Babel,\r\nwhere all business became impracticable from the utter impossibility of\r\nthe parties understanding each other.\r\n\r\nIt was now felt that, to restore order in the bosom of this chaos,\r\nthere was needed a regulating power, capable of commanding confidence,\r\nwith ample funds to enable it to pay out specie freely, and whose\r\npresence and, in case of necessity, whose authority, should serve to\r\nrecall the local banks to their duty. In 1816, the present Bank of the\r\nUnited States was, therefore, chartered by Congress for a term of 20\r\nyears, with a capital of 35 millions, and it went into operation on the\r\n1st of January, 1817. The seat of the mother-bank is Philadelphia, and\r\nit has 25 branches scattered over the Union. By its interference and\r\nassistance specie payments were resumed by the New York, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore, Richmond, Norfolk Banks on the 20th February, 1817, and\r\nin course of time all the other Banks followed the example. This\r\nresumption of specie payments was, first for the banks and then for\r\nindividuals, the signal, the occasion, the rule of a general settling\r\nup of old accounts. As there had been much prodigality, unsuccessful\r\nspeculations, and dead loss, accumulated through a period of 20 years,\r\nthere was now a complete breaking up; many banks failed or suspended\r\ntheir operations, and from 1811 to 1830, 165 banks were reduced to one\r\nor the other of these alternatives. This state of things lasted three\r\nyears; they were three years of crisis, three years of suffering for\r\nindustry, that is, for the people of the United States; for this people\r\nis identified with its commerce. The trials of this period have left a\r\ndeep and lasting impression. Hatred of speculators and of the Banking\r\nsystem has taken root in the hearts of the mass of the people, and now\r\nsprings up in hostility to the Bank of the United States, which, in the\r\neyes of the multitude, is the representative of the system, although\r\nit is itself innocent of the mischief, and can alone prevent its\r\nrecurrence.\r\n\r\nThe antipathy of the greatest number against the banks has then a\r\nreasonable cause, but it is not, therefore, any the less blind and\r\nunjust. They see nothing but abuses, and shut their eyes against the\r\nadvantages. The great extension of credit, which resulted from the\r\ngreat number of banks, and from the absence of all restraint on their\r\nproceedings, has been beneficial to all classes, to the farmers and\r\nmechanics not less than to the merchants. The banks have served the\r\nAmericans as a lever to transfer to their soil, to the general profit,\r\nthe agriculture and manufactures of Europe, and to cover their country\r\nwith roads, canals, factories, schools, churches, and, in a word, with\r\nevery thing that goes to make up civilization. Without the banks, the\r\ncultivator could not have had the first advances, nor the implements\r\nnecessary for the cultivation of his farm, and if the credit system has\r\ngiven facilities for stock-jobbing to speculators, it has also enabled\r\nhim, although indirectly, to buy at the rate of one, two, or three\r\ndollars an acre, and to cultivate lands, which are now, in his hands,\r\nworth tenfold or a hundred fold their first cost. The mechanics who\r\nattack the banking system, forget that they owe to it that growth of\r\nmanufacturing industry, which has raised their wages from one dollar\r\nto two dollars a day. They forget that it furnishes the means by which\r\nmany of their number raise themselves to competence or wealth; for in\r\nthis country every enterprising man, of a respectable character, is\r\nsure of obtaining credit, and thenceforth his fortune depends upon his\r\nown exertions.[K]\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1819, commerce revived, the financial system of the\r\nUnited States seemed settled on a sure basis. Since that time, some\r\nshocks have been felt, as in 1822, and in 1825, the latter the reaction\r\nof the great English crisis, but in both cases the storm soon passed\r\naway. The root of the evil was struck on the day that the Bank of the\r\nUnited States went into operation. This great establishment, which\r\ncommitted some errors at first and paid the penalty, has for a long\r\ntime been conducted with the most consummate prudence. Most of the\r\nleading commercial men, that is to say, most of the talents, of the\r\ncountry are attached to it as directors, and its foreign correspondents\r\nor associates are the houses whose credit is most firmly established,\r\nsuch as the Barings of London, and the Hottinguers of Paris. It\r\nexercises the necessary control over all the local banks, obliges them\r\nto restrain their emissions by calling upon them for specie, or by\r\nrefusing to receive their bills when the issues are excessive. It was\r\nby its agency that the currency of the United States was established\r\non so large a basis, that, in 1831, the banks were able, without any\r\neffort, to discount the amount of 800,000,000 dollars, in the principal\r\ncities of the Union, or 1,100,000,000 for the whole country.\r\n\r\nNow, this state of prosperity seems to be coming to an end. Here, in\r\nNew York, the banks have ceased to discount, and on good paper, for two\r\nor three months, 15, 18, and 24 per cent. per annum have been paid, the\r\nusual rate of the Bank of the United States, and of most of the local\r\nbanks, being 6 per cent. At Philadelphia, 18 per cent. per annum has\r\nbeen given on excellent paper at short dates. At Baltimore, merchants\r\nof great wealth have been obliged to stop payment. Nobody buys;\r\nnobody can sell. Orders for foreign goods are held back; and as every\r\nbody here is engaged in business, this state of things threatens all\r\ninterests, is the subject of all conversations, of all writing, and of\r\nall thoughts. God grant that the sight of the impending danger may calm\r\nthe passions, and that the good sense of the community may banish empty\r\nprejudices and false fears! God grant that both parties may forget\r\ntheir mutual animosities in their anxiety for the common welfare! This\r\nshould be our prayer, not only for the sake of the destinies of this\r\ngreat nation, but also because our silk manufacturers and the owners of\r\nour vineyards, will pay a part of the expenses of the campaign against\r\nthe banks in general, which the radical party is about to open, by a\r\nmortal contest, with the Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[G] The maximum of the discounts of the Bank of France was in 1810,\r\nwhen it amounted to 710 million francs. In 1813, they were 640\r\nmillions, in 1826, 689 millions; at these two periods the Bank made a\r\ngreat effort to sustain commerce. It had less courage in the crisis of\r\n1831-32.\r\n\r\n[H] The Americans have retained the English word _farmer_, which\r\nproperly signifies one who cultivates a hired soil, _fermier_, although\r\namong them the cultivators are proprietors.\r\n\r\n[I] The number of banks at that time.\r\n\r\n[J] There was more paper in circulation in 1816 than in 1834, when the\r\nextent and value of business were very much greater.\r\n\r\n[K] The mechanics and farmers have no credit open at the banks, but\r\nthe traders from whom they buy their tools, implements, raw material,\r\nand provisions, having that advantage, are able to deal with them\r\non favourable terms; the farmer and mechanic are thus benefitted\r\nindirectly, if not immediately, by the banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY--THE BANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    NEW YORK, JANUARY 11, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe financial crisis brought on by the quarrel between the President\r\nand the Bank, has not become more serious; there is a great scarcity\r\nof money, that is, a great diminution of credit, but the failures\r\nare not yet numerous or considerable. The last arrivals from Europe\r\nhave brought us the news that several of the trades in Paris and at\r\nLyons have refused to work. What is taking place here in regard to the\r\nBank, is analogous to what is passing in France among the tailors,\r\nbakers, and carpenters, and what occurs daily in England among the\r\nmanufacturing operatives. In Europe, and particularly in France, it\r\nis the rising of a democracy or rather a radicalism, which is yet in\r\nembryo, and which, if it please God, will never come to maturity. In\r\nAmerica, it is the despotic humour of a full grown democracy, passing\r\nmore and more into radicalism, the longer it rules without a rival and\r\nwithout a counterpoise.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me improbable that the journeymen carpenters, tailors,\r\nand bakers of Paris, should ever give the law to their masters. Among\r\nus, the middling class (_bourgeoisie_) is beginning to feel that it\r\nis its duty to improve the condition of the working class. It has the\r\nauthority, but it is conscious that the people has the physical force.\r\nThe people has counted its own ranks and those of the _bourgeoisie_,\r\nbut it feels that it is not enough to have the number; it sees that it\r\nhas nothing to expect from violence, and that it can back its friends\r\nonly by improved habits of order and morality. On both sides their\r\nreciprocal rights are mutually acknowledged; each fears and respects\r\nthe other. Here, on the contrary, it is perfectly natural that the\r\ndemocracy should rule the capitalists, merchants, and manufacturers;\r\nit possesses at once the physical force and the political power; the\r\nmiddling and upper classes inspire it neither with fear nor with\r\nrespect. The equilibrium is gone; there is no guarantee against the\r\npopular caprice in the United States, but the good sense of the people;\r\nit must be allowed that this good sense is quite extraordinary, but\r\nit is not infallible. A popular despotism is as easily deluded by\r\nflatterers, as any other despotism.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States is at this time experiencing the truth of\r\nthis observation. I have already alluded to some of the crying abuses\r\nwhich have excited a violent hatred against the banks in general,\r\nalthough without the aid of the banks it would have been impossible\r\nfor the United States to have increased in population, wealth, and\r\nterritory as they have done. These abuses were and are the acts of\r\nthe local banks, and not of the Mammoth Bank. On the contrary, the\r\nlatter, by the control which it exercises over the local banks for\r\nits own security, checks and limits these abuses, if it does not\r\ncompletely prevent them. The legislatures of the different States have\r\nbeen repeatedly called to deliberate on the question of abolishing\r\nall banks and breaking up the banking system; but they have generally\r\nthought, and justly, that the remedy would be worse than the disease.\r\nThey have attempted to cure the disorder by restrictive provisions in\r\nthe charter of new banks. The State of of New York, in 1829, embraced\r\nthe whole subject in the Safety-Fund Act, which established a mutual\r\nsupervision of the banks over each other, under the direction of the\r\nBank Commissioners, and creates at their common expense a safety fund,\r\ndesigned to indemnify the public in case of the failure of any one\r\nof the banks. But these measures of repression or prevention have\r\ngenerally proved inefficacious, either from a defect in the means of\r\ncoercion possessed by the government, or from a reluctance to use the\r\npowers conferred by the laws.\r\n\r\nIn their report of the 31st of January, 1833, the New York Bank\r\nCommissioners urgently call the attention of the legislature to the\r\nserious dangers which may result from these institutions as they are\r\nnow organized, particularly in the country, and to their excessive\r\nissues in proportion to the small quantity of specie in their vaults.\r\nWith two millions in specie, the banks of the State had, at that time,\r\na circulation of above twelve millions. But this report itself proves,\r\nthat the commissioners did not dare to fulfil the duties imposed on\r\nthem by the Safety-Fund act; they had the authority to shut up the\r\noffending banks. Their warnings have not prevented the legislature from\r\nchartering new banks by the dozen. This year it will have to act on 105\r\npetitions for charters, that is, eighteen more than the actual number\r\nof banks in the State. To be sure in the present instance, the _let\r\nalone_ principle will probably be violated, for the Governor's Message\r\nof January 7, 1834, urges the two houses to arrest the flood. This Bank\r\nmania, as Jefferson called it, is created by the profits of banking,\r\nwhich is, and more especially was, before the institution of the Bank\r\nof the United States, the best kind of speculation, exactly in the\r\nratio of the abuses attending it.[L]\r\n\r\nIn the local banks, especially in the country banks, the chief aim\r\nof the president and directors is, at all events, come what may, to\r\nmake the semi-annual dividend as large as possible. By extending their\r\noperations excessively, they may, if they lose the public confidence,\r\nbe driven to a failure; but in the United States the prospect of such a\r\ndisaster is much less terrible to the greater number of merchants, and\r\neven to the smaller companies, than it is in Europe. (See _Note_ 7, at\r\nthe end of the volume.) When a bank fails, there is, indeed, a great\r\noutcry, because the number of victims is large, and the loss extends to\r\nall classes; for most of the bills being of the denomination of five\r\ndollars and under, they are very generally distributed in the hands\r\nof the labourers, as well as of the wealthier classes. But just in\r\nproportion to the distribution of the loss over the greater number of\r\npersons, is the quickness with which the clamor ceases. The president,\r\nthe cashier, the directors, and others principally interested, readily\r\nfind means to recover from the blow, by obtaining credit elsewhere, and\r\nthe whole affair is at an end.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States, on the contrary, directed by men of\r\nlarge fortune and established reputation, connected in business with\r\nthe principal houses in Europe, charged with a vast responsibility,\r\nsubject to the supervision of the Federal government, which names five\r\nof the directors out of twentyfive, and officiously watched by an army\r\nof journalists, is interested and obliged to follow another course.\r\nNot that it has not committed some errors; but it paid dear for them,\r\nand has never repeated them. Neither are its rules and regulations\r\nperfect; the experience of twenty years will doubtless suggest some\r\nmodifications. But even its adversaries admit that it has been\r\nadmirably managed. They pretended, at first, that the public money was\r\nnot safe in its vaults, but they are at present ashamed to insist upon\r\nthis point, as the investigation made by the House of Representatives\r\nproved the absurdity of the charge. The accusations now brought against\r\nit are of a political character.\r\n\r\nPolitically considered, indeed, the existence of an institution\r\nso powerful as the Bank of the United States may present some\r\ninconveniences. The fundamental maxim of the Federal and State\r\nconstitutions is, that the supreme authority is null and void; there is\r\nno government here in the true sense of the word; that is, no directing\r\npower. Each one is his own master; it is self-government in all its\r\npurity. This anomalous and monstrous development of the individual\r\nprinciple is no evil here, it is even a great good at present; it\r\nis the present stage in the progress of the United States, because\r\nself-government is the only form of government to which the American\r\ncharacter, as it is, can accommodate itself. If individuality had not\r\nfree elbow-room here, this people would fall short of its destiny,\r\nwhich is to extend its conquests rapidly over an immense territory,\r\nfor the good of the whole human race, to substitute, in the shortest\r\ntime possible, civilization for the solitude of the primitive forests,\r\nover a surface ten times greater than all France, of as great average\r\nfertility as that country, and capable, therefore, of accommodating 350\r\nmillions of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations it is clear, that any power whatsoever, if\r\npossessed of great influence, and exercising it over a great space,\r\nwould be inconsistent with the political system of the country; for\r\nthis reason the Federal and State governments are in a permanent state\r\nof eclipse. And it is furthermore evident, that the Bank, which is met\r\nat every turn as an agent in all transactions, which governs credit,\r\nregulates the currency, animates or checks at will the activity of\r\ncommerce by narrowing or widening the channels of circulation, the\r\nBank, which by its numerous branches is, like the fabled polypus,\r\neverywhere present, the Bank with its funds, its centralisation,\r\nits trusty creatures, is certainly an anomaly, which may become big\r\nwith danger. One might, from an abstract, theoretical point of view,\r\nimagine cases, in which this financial colossus, seated in the heart\r\nof a country absorbed in business, would press with a crushing weight\r\non the liberties of the people. If it were possible that a new Monk\r\nshould wish to restore the English rule, or that a new Bonaparte, the\r\nsaviour of the republic in another Marengo, should attempt to make\r\nhimself dictator, it would also be possible that a conspiracy between\r\nthe Bank and this Monk, or this Napoleon, might overthrow the liberties\r\nof America. But such an event, possible to be sure in theory, (for in\r\ntheory nothing is impossible,) is, at present, wholly impracticable\r\nin fact. Yet there are honest and enlightened men, on whom this\r\ntheoretical danger makes more impression, than the necessity of a\r\nregulator amidst the chaos of 500 banks, or of an agent, which, by\r\ncontrolling the currency, should be in financial affairs, what the vast\r\nrivers of the country are in the system of internal communication. They\r\nfear more, for this land of industry, from the imperceptible tyranny of\r\nthe Bank, than from a system in which there would be no check on the\r\ncupidity of the local banks, and in which they might renew, with their\r\npaper money, if not the _assignats_ of France, of the Continental money\r\nof the Revolution, at least the commercial anarchy which followed the\r\nwar of 1812.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for the United States, it is not on this high ground of\r\nforesight, that President Jackson and his friends take their stand in\r\ntheir attack on the Bank. They do not say, that it is possible that\r\nit may some time, under a new state of things, become an instrument\r\nof oppression; they pretend that it is so already. According to them,\r\nit tends to nothing less than the subjugation of the country to its\r\nrule. In his last annual message, and in an official paper read to the\r\ncabinet on the 18th of September, 1833, the President accuses the Bank:\r\n1. With having intrigued to bring up the question of the renewal of its\r\ncharter in Congress during the session of 1831-32, in order to reduce\r\nhim to the alternative of giving his sanction to the bill, or losing\r\nthe votes of the friends of the Bank in the approaching election,\r\nif he refused it. He forgets that he had himself, in his message at\r\nthe opening of that session, recommended to Congress to settle the\r\nbusiness. 2. Of having meddled with politics in opposing his election\r\nin 1832, and of having, with this purpose, enlarged its loans and\r\ndiscounts twenty-eight and a half millions. The Bank replies that the\r\nstatement is incorrect; that its books show, that its available means\r\nhaving been augmented, between January and May, 1831, ten millions,\r\nand the requisitions of commerce having increased, it had judged\r\nit expedient to extend its credits seventeen and a half millions,\r\nso that the actual extension of its operations was only four and a\r\nhalf millions. 3. Of having attempted to corrupt the public press,\r\neither by printing a great number of pamphlets, or by gaining over the\r\nnewspapers. The Bank answers to this charge, that it has a perfect\r\nright to defend itself by the press, against the continual attacks upon\r\nit to which the press gives currency, that it may certainly be allowed\r\nto reprint the speeches delivered in its favor in Congress, or essays\r\nin which questions of banking are luminously treated, such as that\r\nby the celebrated Mr Gallatin, who was twelve years Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and afterward minister to France. As to the vague imputation\r\nof attempting to corrupt a press, which pours forth such a number of\r\njournals as the press of the United States, (see _Note_ 8, at the end\r\nof the volume,) it does not deserve a serious answer.\r\n\r\nIf a European government, from motives of this character, on facts thus\r\ndestitute of proof, should attempt to destroy an institution essential\r\nto the prosperity of the country, the cry of despotism would be raised\r\non all sides. If the state were itself interested in the institution\r\nto the amount of one fifth of its capital (7 millions of dollars),\r\nmany persons would charge such an attempt not only with violence, but\r\nwith folly. In the United States the numerical majority, which is the\r\nmajority of electors, applauded General Jackson's campaign against the\r\nBank almost as enthusiastically as his campaign at New Orleans. The\r\nmilitary success of General Jackson, his honesty, his iron firmness,\r\nhave given him an astonishing popularity. The Bank, on the contrary,\r\nin spite of its daily services, (see _Note_ 9, at the end of the\r\nvolume,) is unpopular; it is so on account of the popular hatred of\r\nthe Banking System, on account of that jealousy, which, in a land of\r\nperfect equality and suspicious democracy, follows in the steps of\r\nwealth and pomp; it is so because its extensive privileges shock all\r\nrepublican feelings. In the United States, in spite of the general\r\nhabits and laws of equality, there is a sort of aristocracy founded\r\non knowledge or on commercial distinction. This aristocracy, somewhat\r\nprone to entertain a contempt for the vulgar multitude, causes a strong\r\nreaction against itself in the popular mind, and as it supports the\r\nBank by its influence and its writings, this is enough, of itself, to\r\nset the pure democracy against the institution. Add to this, that the\r\nBank, irritated by the hostile demonstrations of the administration,\r\nhas sometimes answered it by angry acts of reprisal, not grave in\r\nthemselves, but unfortunate in their consequences, and of which its\r\nadversaries have adroitly availed themselves to excite the popular\r\npassions. Although the Bank has the majority of the Senate in its\r\nfavor, the chances are now against it. Unless the multitude, which now\r\nshouts HURRAH FOR JACKSON! without reflection, shall be led, between\r\nthis and March, 1836, when its charter expires, to reflect seriously on\r\nthe matter, it will disappear, until a new experience shall again prove\r\nthat it is impossible to get along without it.\r\n\r\nThus, at the very moment when the English Reform ministry is renewing\r\nthe charter and confirming the privileges of the Bank of England,\r\nwith the approbation of all Europe, here a compact mass, in which,\r\nindeed, the enlightened do not form the majority, but in which,\r\nnotwithstanding, some are included, deals the death-blow to a similar\r\ninstitution, tried and proved by long services. Thus, while one of the\r\ngreatest, perhaps, in an economical point of view, the very greatest\r\nof the benefits which France could receive, would be the establishment\r\nof a system of banks, connected with each other as the twenty branches\r\nof the Bank of the United States are with the mother bank, America\r\nis about to witness, if not the death, at least the suspension of\r\nan institution, that has been fruitful of so much good, without the\r\nslightest immediate loss of popularity by those who are doing the work\r\nof destruction. So goes the world in the United States. The history of\r\nthis affair shows that the political springs are here wholly different\r\nfrom those that operate in Europe, and that nevertheless, intrigue and\r\npetty hate have free course here as well as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[L] The dividends of the Bank of North America were, in 1792, 15 per\r\ncent.; in 1793, 13 1-2; from 1794 to 1799 inclusive, 12 per cent.;\r\nfrom 1804 to 1810, 9 per cent. Those of the old Bank of the United\r\nStates varied from 7 5-8 to 10 per cent. Those of the Pennsylvania\r\nBank, from 1792 to 1810, from 8 to 10. The Bank of the United States\r\nregularly divides 7 per cent. to the share-holders. In the city of New\r\nYork the average dividends of the banks in 1832, was 6.14 per cent.;\r\nof the country banks 9 per cent. It must not be forgotten that the\r\nlegal rate of interest is higher in the United States than in Europe;\r\nit is 6 per cent. in Pennsylvania, 7 in New York, from 8 to 9 in the\r\nSouthern States, and 10 in Louisiana. In the Western States there is no\r\nregulation of interest by law, but the ordinary rate is very high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT OF PARTIES.--BANK QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    PHILADELPHIA, JAN. 5, 1834.\r\n\r\nOf all the cities of the Union, the peaceful Philadelphia is the most\r\ndisturbed by the Bank question, because it is the seat of the mother\r\nbank. The State of Pennsylvania also, of all the States, suffers the\r\nmost from the financial crisis, because it is the most deeply in\r\ndebt, and is obliged to borrow more, either to finish its canals and\r\nrailroads, or to pay the interest on its existing debt. Conceive of\r\nthe situation of a State, whose population amounts to only 1,500,000\r\nsouls, loaded with a debt of twenty and a half millions, whose ordinary\r\nexpenditures are less than 600,000 dollars, but which must raise one\r\nmillion to pay interest already accrued, and nearly two millions and\r\na half, for the next summer, under penalty of seeing her great works,\r\nexecuted at an enormous expense, go to ruin, and who knows not whither\r\nto turn. This is not all; some old loans must be reimbursed next\r\nMay, or in three months, and, to crown the whole, the capitalists who\r\ncontracted last year for a loan of three millions, to be employed on\r\nthe public works, are, in consequence of the present crisis, unable\r\nto fulfil their contracts. The local banks, which are bound by their\r\ncharters to lend the State at the rate of 5 per cent., rather stand\r\nin need of assistance themselves. To these public embarrassments is\r\nadded the private distress, and thus this country, which Cobbett,\r\nwho always shows talent, and occasionally gleams of good sense,\r\ndubs the _Anti-Malthusian_, exhibits for the present the spectacle\r\nof a superabundance of labourers. In the manufacturing districts of\r\nPennsylvania, many of the operatives are without work.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the rest of the country is not, in general, any more\r\nfavorable. I am very ready to believe that the Anti-Jackson newspapers,\r\nfor so they call themselves, exaggerate the distress; but making\r\nall due allowance for rhetorical flourishes, it is still undeniable\r\nthat there is much distress, especially among the commercial class.\r\nBare figures are more eloquent than the best advocates of the Bank,\r\nand it is a notorious fact, that excellent paper has been discounted\r\nat the rate of 18 per cent. per annum, and at even higher rates, in\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. The price currents and the\r\nstate of the stock-market, show a general fall in prices of 15, 20,\r\n30, and even 40 per cent. Thus far the efforts of the President to\r\nfell the hydra of the moneyed aristocracy, the Mammoth, the Monster,\r\nhave had no other effect than to blast credit and the commercial\r\nprosperity of the country; for the Bank has been administered with so\r\nmuch ability, especially since the presidency of Mr Biddle, one of\r\nthe most distinguished men in the country, that notwithstanding the\r\nabrupt removal of the public deposits, notwithstanding the unexpected\r\nand unfair assaults upon some of the branches, particularly that of\r\nSavannah[M], it is beyond comparison the most solvent and safe of all\r\nthe financial institutions in the Union. At this critical moment it\r\nhas as much specie (ten millions) as all the other 500 banks taken\r\ntogether, and I know from good authority, that many Jackson men (this\r\nis the epithet adopted by themselves), have been very glad to be\r\nsprinkled with a few drops of the _venom_ of this dangerous _reptile_.\r\n\r\nIf what is now taking place in this country were to occur in any\r\nEuropean monarchy, those persons who insist upon all nations having a\r\ngovernment cast in the republican mould, whatever may be the condition\r\nof their territory and population, their wealth and knowledge, their\r\ncharacter and manners, would not fail to make it the text of their\r\nharangues against monarchical governments; holding up to view the\r\npicture of an unparallelled commercial prosperity, checked of a sudden\r\nby the caprice of the sovereign, they would prove that such is one of\r\nthe unavoidable consequences of an opposition between the interest of\r\nthe ruler and the welfare of the nation; they would demonstrate by\r\ngeometrical syllogisms, that it is the essence of monarchy to place\r\nauthority in the hands of the weak and the foolish, who, to gratify\r\ntheir personal malice, would not hesitate to hazard the happiness of\r\nmillions. They would raise the cry of secret influence, of intrigue,\r\nwhich, according to them, is one of the attributes of monarchies.\r\nUnluckily for this theory, it is belied by facts under my own eyes,\r\nin the most thorough and flourishing republic that has ever existed.\r\nThe selfishness of royalty, or more correctly speaking of courts, has\r\nhitherto begot much mischief and will continue to do so in future; but\r\nit has met with its match in the bosom of republics, and above all\r\nunder a system of _absolute_ equality, which distributes political\r\npower in _absolutely_ equal quantities to the intelligent and the\r\nignorant, to the most eminent merchant and author, and the brutal\r\nand drunken peasant of Ireland, who is but just enrolled in the list\r\nof citizens. An _absolute_ people, as well as an _absolute_ king,\r\nmay reject for a time the lessons of experience and the councils of\r\nwisdom; a people as well as a king, may have its courtiers. A people on\r\nthe throne, whose authority is limited by no checks, may blindly and\r\nrecklessly espouse the quarrels of the minions of the day; let those\r\nwho doubt it come here and see it. Ignorance of the true interests\r\nof the country is not the exclusive prerogative of monarchies. The\r\nofficial papers of the Federal Executive in the affair of the Bank,\r\nso far as concerns a knowledge of the principles of government and\r\nthe springs of the public welfare, are on a level with the measures\r\nof the government of Spain or Rome. And yet this Executive is the\r\ncreature of the popular choice in the largest sense. It is not merely\r\nin monarchies, that a dancer is to be seen in the post that belongs\r\nto a mathematician. The camarilla! Never have I heard it so much\r\ntalked about, as since I have been in this country. It is here called\r\nthe _Kitchen Cabinet_, and admitting a fourth of what is said by\r\nthe opposition to be true, it is difficult not to believe that its\r\ninfluence upon public affairs is greater than that of the ministerial\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Bank. Congress met on the 3d of December; and most\r\nof the State Legislatures are now in session. Every where, and above\r\nall in Congress, the great, not to say the only question agitated, is\r\nthat of the Bank. The subject of the discussions is the removal of the\r\npublic deposits, which the President has withdrawn from the Bank after\r\na military fashion, having previously, in the same spirit, removed from\r\noffice the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Duane, who, although opposed\r\nto the Bank, considered the President's course illegal and rash.\r\nThus far, the manifestations of public opinion and the deliberative\r\nassemblies are extremely various and discordant. In New Jersey, a small\r\nand unimportant State, the Assembly has adopted, by a large majority,\r\nresolutions approving the acts of the administration, and instructing\r\nits delegates in Congress to support the President; notwithstanding\r\nwhich, Mr Southard, one of the Senators from that State, has made an\r\nexcellent speech on the other side of the question. The Assembly of New\r\nYork, the first State in wealth and population, has adopted similar\r\nresolutions by a vote of 118 to 9. Some persons to be sure, assert that\r\nthis is because New York would like to have the Mother Bank.[N] The\r\nyouthful State of Ohio, whose growth borders on the miraculous (it now\r\ncontains eleven hundred thousand inhabitants, although but 50 years\r\nago it had not six thousand), Ohio, the Benjamin of the democracy, has\r\nstrongly expressed the same wishes. The little State of Maine has done\r\nthe same. The administration party lately had a brilliant opportunity\r\nof displaying its sympathies and its hatred. The 8th of January, the\r\nanniversary of the battle of New Orleans, was celebrated by innumerable\r\npublic dinners, at each of which numerous toasts were drank. President\r\nJackson was the hero, and the Bank was the scape-goat, of the day. It\r\nwould be impossible to imagine the flood of accusations, insults, and\r\nthreats, which was poured upon it, mingled with jests in the taste of\r\nthe country upon Mr Biddle; thus, at one of these dinners, the Bank was\r\ntoasted, as being _governed by Young Nick according to the principles\r\nof Old Nick_.\r\n\r\nBut the population of New England, particularly that of Massachusetts,\r\nis opposed to the administration. In Virginia the same opinions seems\r\nto prevail, and it is the same with several of the old Southern States.\r\nThe merchants and manufacturers of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,\r\nBoston, and a hundred other places, have held meetings and adopted\r\nresolutions, strongly censuring the conduct of the government towards\r\nthe Bank, and accusing it of having caused the present crisis. Most of\r\nthe Philadelphia Banks have petitioned in favor of the Bank. Several\r\nBanks at Boston and in Virginia have refused to take the public money\r\nin deposit; those of Charleston have been unanimous in this measure.\r\nThe majority of persons of intelligence, experience, and moderation,\r\nand most of the merchants and manufacturers, are in favour of the Bank.\r\nThe country, particularly in the Middle and Western States, and the\r\noperatives in the towns, go for General Jackson.\r\n\r\nIn Congress the majority of the Senate is friendly to the Bank, and\r\nthe majority of the House is on the side of the Administration. The\r\nsuperiority in debate belongs to the defenders of the Bank. In the\r\nSenate, the three greatest statesmen in the country, Messrs Clay,\r\nWebster, and Calhoun, are on this side of the question, and the\r\nspeeches of Messrs Clay and Calhoun have made a strong impression. In\r\nthe House Mr Binney, of Philadelphia, and Mr McDuffie have pleaded\r\nthe same cause with ability. On the other side there has been more\r\nhighflown declamation than reasoning. I have been struck with the\r\nresemblance between most of the speeches and newspaper essays directed\r\nagainst the Bank, and our republican tirades of 1791 and 1792. There\r\nare the same declamatory tone, the same swollen style, the same appeal\r\nto the popular passions, with this difference, that the allegations\r\nmade here are vague, empty, and indefinite, while with us fifty years\r\nago the grievances were real. Most generally the pictures presented\r\nin these declamations, are fantastical delineations of the moneyed\r\naristocracy overrunning the country with seduction, corruption, and\r\nslavery in its train; or of Mr Biddle aiming at the crown. Amidst\r\nthis swarm of speeches and essays, one hardly ever meets with any\r\nindications of serious study or a tolerable knowledge of the subject;\r\nbut I have been struck with the speech of Mr Cambreleng, who has\r\nput forth some prudent suggestions as to the reforms required in\r\nthe present system of banking. For it must be confessed, that this\r\nanimosity of the President and the body of the people against the Bank\r\nof the United States, blind and unreasonable as it is, is founded on\r\na real necessity, namely, that of a complete reorganization of the\r\nbanking system. When Congress renewed the charter of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States without modification, in 1832, it committed an error.\r\nIt should have seized this opportunity to place the currency of the\r\ncountry on a more solid basis; and if General Jackson had abode by\r\nthe terms of his veto message, in which he declared that he was not\r\nopposed in principle to the establishment of a National Bank, but that\r\nthe present Bank could not be retained without some modification, he\r\nmight have become the benefactor of his country. He would not, indeed,\r\nhave received Cobbett's congratulations, but he would have obtained\r\nthe approbation of all statesmen and men of sense in the Old and the\r\nNew World. However, whatever his friends may say, as the President did\r\nnot foresee the distress, which has befallen American commerce, and as\r\nnobody can doubt his patriotism, we need need not yet despair of seeing\r\nhim adopt this wise course.\r\n\r\nThe present crisis abundantly proves the wretched condition of the\r\ncurrency, for the original cause of it was quite slight; it was merely\r\nthe transfer from the vaults of one bank to those of another of ten\r\nmillions, an inconsiderable sum relatively to the amount of the\r\nbusiness of the country. If the local banks, in spite of the control\r\nexercised by the Bank of the United States, had not previously passed\r\nall bounds, they would have been able, when the Bank of the United\r\nStates was obliged to contract its discounts by the withdrawing of the\r\npublic money, to have enlarged their own in the same proportion, since\r\nthose same funds were transferred to their vaults. But the framework of\r\nthese banks is so badly put together, that it shakes at the slightest\r\nbreath. The slight motion in the political and commercial atmosphere\r\ncaused by the President's blow at the Bank, in removing the public\r\ndeposits, was enough to make them totter. They are like a colossus with\r\nclay feet, which should have feet of gold, or in other words, specie in\r\ntheir vaults.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of metals, of which we have an excess in France, is\r\nhere extremely small. In many States, among others New York, there\r\nis an enormous quantity of bills of one, two, and three dollars. In\r\nSouth Carolina there are 25 cent, and even 12 1-2 cent bills. In\r\nPennsylvania, Virginia, and some other States, there are none of less\r\nthan five dollars. The Bank of the United States emits none of less\r\nthan that sum; but this minimum is too low. Most political economists,\r\nand particularly the English, lay it down as an axiom, that the most\r\nperfect money is paper; this is true, if we suppose a nation in which\r\nany disturbance of industry, in consequence or apprehension of war,\r\nfrom foolish speculations, from glut or panic, is impossible. In such a\r\nland of cockayne, such a terrestrial paradise, an unshaken confidence\r\nwould prevail in all transactions, and consolidate all interests. The\r\nmetals would only serve to strike medals and to preserve inscriptions\r\nintended to commemorate this ineffable bliss. Paper would there be on a\r\npar with gold, and even higher, as some English writers have maintained\r\nit should be. I do not know if there will ever be a nation in such a\r\nstate of heavenly happiness; but I doubt it, because in the world of\r\nfinance, as well as in the world of passion, I consider the Tender\r\nRiver a fable, and pastorals a sport of fancy; but it is very evident\r\nthat no such people exists now, or will for some time to come. Now in\r\nthe United States, the present banking system, like that of England\r\nfrom 1797 to 1821, or even 1825, is founded on this theory of the most\r\nperfect money. It is provided, indeed, that the banks shall pay gold\r\nfor their paper on demand; but by the side of this clause, which tends\r\nto keep a certain quantity of the metals in the country, is inserted\r\nanother, which neutralises it; it is the power of emitting bills in any\r\nnumber, and of the sum of 1, 2, 3, or 5 dollars. In prosperous times,\r\nthe emission of paper is abundant, indefinite; as the necessity of a\r\nmetallic standard ceases to be felt, in proportion to the confidence\r\nwhich prevails, the metals disappear before the excess of paper; there\r\nis scarcely any left in the country. Since I have been in the United\r\nStates, I have not seen a piece of gold except in the mint. No sooner\r\nis it struck off, than the gold is exported to Europe and melted down.\r\nWhen a crisis comes on, the demand for the precious metals increases\r\nrapidly, because every one attaches more value to a positive standard\r\nthan to paper, and the later the application of the remedy for the\r\nscarcity of metals, the longer does the crisis last, and the more\r\nserious does it become.\r\n\r\nIn a new country, where capital cannot, of course, be abundant,\r\nfor capital of all kinds, whether of articles of food or precious\r\nmetals, is the accumulated produce of labour, it is natural, that the\r\nproportion of paper money should equal and surpass that of metallic\r\nmoney. The existence of paper money is even a great benefit to any\r\ncountry. In France we have the enormous sum of 600 million dollars in\r\nspecie; (see _Note_ 10, at the end of the volume); in the United States\r\n40 millions are sufficient for all the transactions of a commerce\r\nnearly as extensive as our own. In England the amount of specie at\r\npresent does not exceed 220 millions, mostly in gold. Bank notes in\r\ncirculation, which constitute the rest of the currency, amount at this\r\ntime, in the United States, to 100 million, that is, two and a half\r\ntimes the amount of specie; in England to about the same as the specie,\r\nwhich gives for the whole circulation of\r\n\r\n  The United States,    140 millions--\r\n  Of England,           440 millions.\r\n\r\nIf we had in France the industrial habits of the English and\r\nAnglo-Americans, 200 millions of circulating medium, half in paper\r\nand half in specie, would probably be sufficient for our operations;\r\nbut considering our commercial inferiority, suppose that we should\r\nrequire 300 millions, of which two thirds should be metallic, and one\r\nthird paper, it would follow that we might advantageously employ 400\r\nmillions, which are now unproductive in the form of specie, and which\r\nadd nothing to our pleasures, our comfort, or our industrial capacity.\r\nBut if we might expect great benefit from banks of circulation and the\r\npaper which they would issue, it is evident that the Americans, in the\r\npresent stage of their wealth, and considering their actual capital,\r\nwould find their advantage in putting some check upon themselves in\r\nthis matter. It might then be proper to raise the minimum of bills of\r\nthe Bank of the United States to 10, 15, or 20 dollars, as in England\r\nthere is no paper less than the five pound note. The National Bank, if\r\nit were powerful enough, would keep the local banks in check, and for\r\nthis reason it is expedient to increase the capital. There would then\r\nbe specie enough in the country for all purposes less than the paper\r\nminimum, and in case of any disturbance, the currency would be less\r\nreadily deranged.\r\n\r\nNor is this the only point in which the charter of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States requires modification; its relations with the Federal\r\ngovernment, as well as with the State governments, need to be modified;\r\nand some projects worthy of consideration, in this view, have been\r\nbroached. It would also, probably, be expedient, as Mr Cambreleng has\r\nremarked, to change the rules and regulations relating to private\r\nand public deposits, and to provide that in future they should bear\r\ninterest as they do in the Scotch banks. If this system were adopted\r\nby all the American banks, they would gain in solidity, and they would\r\nembrace the interest of all classes, and become provident institutions\r\nfor the general good; while at present, their direct profits, the\r\ndividends, fall exclusively to the share-holders, who belong to the\r\nwealthier classes; a fact which contributes not a little to their\r\nunpopularity. Finally, it would be proper to consider to what degree\r\nthe immediate advantages of credit might be extended to mechanics and\r\nfarmers. In this respect the banks are yet absolutely aristocratical\r\ninstitutions, the Americans having preserved in banking almost all the\r\nusages of their ancestors, the English. The American banks are now\r\nchiefly devoted to the use of speculators and merchants.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of so many contradictions, it is difficult to foresee what\r\nwill be the issue of the struggle. The friends of the Administration\r\nmaintain that President Jackson and Vice President Van Buren are not\r\nonly opposed to the Bank as it is, but to any National Bank, and that\r\nthey will never yield. The Globe, the avowed organ of the President,\r\nhas told Mr Clay, that unless he _can find a Brutus_ (to assassinate\r\nGeneral Jackson,) the Bank will neither have the deposits nor a new\r\ncharter. We may doubt, however, whether the President's mind is so\r\ndecisively made up, and after all a majority of both houses can set at\r\nnought the _veto_. As to the Vice President, whom his opponents call\r\nthe cunning Van Buren, as he aspires to succeed the President, many\r\npersons declare that his object is to gain the vote of the powerful\r\nState of New York, by transferring thither the seat of the Mother Bank,\r\nbut that he is too enlightened seriously to wish the destruction of an\r\ninstitution fraught with so much good to the country.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it would be surprising if the present crisis\r\nwere not followed, sooner or later, by a reaction in favour of the\r\nBank of the United States with suitable modifications, or of another\r\nNational Bank, which, as Mr Webster observed, would amount to the same\r\nthing, if the share-holders of the present Bank are not sacrificed.\r\nThe jealous democracy of this country has this advantage over other\r\ndemocracies, that in the main it has much good sense; the recollection\r\nof old sufferings caused by the abuses of the banking system, and a\r\njealousy of all pretensions to superiority, have led it to give ear to\r\nmuch noisy declamation about the aristocracy of money, particularly\r\nwhen it has been mixed up with flattery of itself. It may have been\r\nled astray for a moment, when its own prerogatives were the subject of\r\ndiscussion, as those sovereigns who assert the divine right of kings,\r\ntake fire in respect to theirs. Proud of its gigantic labours, it may\r\nhave been tempted to believe, that to it everything was possible and\r\neasy, that it had only to frown to cause the Bank to crumble into the\r\ndust at its feet, without being itself shaken by the shock. But facts,\r\npositive, inexorable facts now bear witness that it was mistaken, that\r\nit has trusted too much to its powers and its star, that the agency\r\nof the Bank of the United States is indispensable. The influence of\r\nfacts has spread step by step even to the country people, who no longer\r\nfind buyers of their produce. The argument is palpable and effectual;\r\npassion cannot long blind men of sense to such facts, for men of sense\r\nare those who do not give themselves up implicitly to abstractions, and\r\nwho admit that every theory which is point blank against fact, is false\r\nor incomplete. This is the reason why good sense is worth to the full\r\nas much in politics, as talents.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to observe here, that all the political difficulties\r\nin which the United States have become involved, and which have\r\nthreatened the existence of the Union itself, have been settled\r\nby means of what are here called compromises, and in France\r\n_justes-milieux_. Thus was ended the serious dispute on the Missouri\r\nquestion, which had well nigh set the Union in a flame. It was made a\r\nquestion whether Missouri should be received into the Confederacy with\r\na constitution sanctioning the institution of slavery. After a long\r\nand ineffectual debate, Mr Clay moved that Missouri should be admitted\r\nunconditionally, but that, at the same time, it should be declared\r\nthat in future no new State lying north of 36° 30´ of latitude, should\r\nbe admitted into the Union with this institution; this proposition\r\nwas received with general favour, and the admission of Missouri was\r\ncarried. In the next session, however, a new quarrel arose between\r\nthe North and the South, more violent and bitter than the former, in\r\nrelation to an article in the constitution of Missouri, prohibiting\r\nany free man of colour from entering the State. Another compromise,\r\nproposed by Mr Clay, finally settled the whole question in 1821, after\r\nit had kept the country in a flame for three years. In 1833, another\r\ncompromise was made in respect to the tariff, the honour of which also\r\nbelongs to Mr Clay. This question will sooner or later be settled in\r\nthe same manner; the Union cannot do without a National Bank, and it\r\nwill have one.\r\n\r\nThere are some lucky persons who succeed in everything, and there are\r\nsome lucky nations with whom everything turns out well, even those\r\nevents which seemed about to bury them in ruins. The United States\r\nis one of these privileged communities. When Villeroi came back to\r\nVersailles, after his defeat, Louis XIV. said to him, \"Marshal, nobody\r\nis lucky at our time of life.\" Charles V. also, as he grew old, said\r\nthat fortune was like a woman, and preferred young men to old ones.\r\nLouis and Charles were right so far as this, that when a man, young or\r\nold, has finished his mission, foresight, ability, and perseverance\r\nprofit him little; he fails in whatever he undertakes, whilst he who\r\nhas a mission yet to fulfil, takes new strength from the most violent\r\nblows. This is true of nations as well as of individuals. The American\r\npeople is a young people, which has a mission to perform; nothing less\r\nthan to redeem a world from savage forests, panthers, and bears. It\r\nmoves with mighty strides towards its object, for it has not, like\r\nthe nations of Europe, the burden of a heavy past on its shoulders.\r\nIt may be checked in its career for a time by the present crisis, but\r\nit will come out of it safe and sound, and more healthy than when it\r\nentered it. It will come out with increased resources, with a reformed\r\nbanking system, and according to all appearances, even with an improved\r\nNational Bank. May the nations of Europe not have to wait long for\r\ninstitutions, which have so powerfully assisted England and America in\r\ntheir progress!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] The Savannah branch had out only 500,000 dollars in bills. The\r\ncollector of the port accumulated them, as they were received for\r\ncustoms duties, and one day a broker presented himself at the counter\r\nwith 380,000 dollars in bills, for which he demanded specie; but the\r\ndisappearance of the bills of the branch from circulation had not been\r\nunnoticed, and funds had been provided for any exigency. Payment was,\r\ntherefore, instantly made, and the broker, not knowing what to do with\r\nso much specie, was obliged to request the cashier to receive it in\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n[N] New York is the chief seat of commerce, but Philadelphia is more\r\ncentral, and is, besides, the city of American capitalists. The removal\r\nto New York would also require the transference of the mint and some\r\nother public offices to that city, at great expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE STRUGGLE.--NEW POWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      BALTIMORE, MARCH 1, 1834.\r\n\r\nFailures begin to be frequent in the United States, particularly in New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania; the great commercial and manufacturing houses\r\nare shaking. Meanwhile the Senators and Representatives in Congress\r\nare making speeches on the crisis, its causes, and consequences. Three\r\nmonths have already been taken up in discussing the question, whether\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury had or had not the right to withdraw the\r\npublic deposits from the vaults of the Bank, without that institution\r\nhaving given any just cause of complaint, and merely because it was\r\nstrongly suspected of aristocratical tendencies. The resolutions which\r\nhave given rise to these debates, have been referred by the Senate to\r\nthe Committee on Finance, and by the House to the Committee of Ways\r\nand Means. Debates will rise on the reports of these committees, on\r\npetitions and memorials, and incidental matters, and, I am told, will\r\nlast two or three months longer. This slowness is at first glance\r\ndifficult to be understood, among a people, which, above all things,\r\nstrives to save time, and which is so much given to haste and despatch,\r\nthat its most suitable emblem would be a locomotive engine or a\r\nsteamboat, just as the Centaurs were anciently confounded with their\r\nhorses. From all the large towns of the North, committees appointed\r\nby great public meetings, bring to Washington memorials signed by\r\nthousands, calling for prompt and efficient measures to put an end to\r\nthe crisis. On the other hand, the partisans of the Administration\r\nfind fault with the prolixity of the legislators. The calmness, or\r\nrather phlegm, which the Americans have inherited from their English\r\nancestors, is kept undisturbed in both houses of Congress, and the\r\nsolemn debate goes on. One speaker for example, Mr Benton, occupied\r\nfour sessions, four whole days, with his speech, which led Mr Calhoun\r\nto observe, that the Senator from Missouri took up more time in\r\nexpressing his opinion on a single fact, than the French people had\r\ndone in achieving a revolution. But these interminable delays ought not\r\nto be too lightly condemned, and for myself I only shrug my shoulders,\r\nwhen I hear some impatient individuals asserting that Congress would be\r\nmore expeditious, were it not for the eight dollars a day which they\r\nreceive during the session. This delay may seem irreconcileable with\r\none of the distinctive traits of the American character, but in reality\r\nis imperiously demanded by the form and spirit of the government, by\r\nthe institutions and political habits of the country.\r\n\r\nThe general discussion in Congress has no other object than to open\r\na full and free public inquest, which enables each and all to make\r\nup an opinion. It gives rise to a discussion of the question by the\r\ninnumerable journals in the United States (where there are 1200\r\npolitical newspapers), by the twentyfour legislatures, each composed of\r\ntwo houses, and by the public meetings in the cities and towns. It is\r\nan animated exchange of arguments of every calibre and every degree,\r\nof contradictory resolutions, mixed up with applauses and hisses, of\r\nexaggerated eulogies and brutal invectives. A stranger, who finds\r\nhimself suddenly thrown into the midst of this hubbub, is confounded\r\nand stupefied; he seems to himself to be present in the primeval or the\r\nfinal chaos, or at least at the general breaking up of the Union. But\r\nafter a certain time some gleams of light break forth from these thick\r\nclouds, from the bosom of this confusion,--gleams, which the good\r\nsense of the people hails with joy, and which light up the Congress.\r\nWe see here the realization of the _Forum_ on an immense scale, the\r\n_Forum_ with its tumult, its cries, its pasquinades, but also with\r\nits sure instincts, and its flashes of native and untaught genius. It\r\nis a spectacle, in its details, occasionally prosaic and repulsive,\r\nbut, as a whole, imposing as the troubled ocean. In a country like\r\nthis, it is impossible to avoid these delays; first, because it takes\r\na long time to interchange words between the frontiers of Canada and\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, and secondly, because nothing is so dangerous as\r\nprecipitation in a _Forum_, whether it only covers the narrow space\r\nbetween the _Rostra_ and the Tarpeian Rock, or extends from Lake\r\nChamplain to the mouth of the Mississippi, and from the Illinois to the\r\nCape of Florida. Unfortunately the session in the _Forum_ lasts longer\r\nthan usual this time. The demagogues have set the popular passions\r\nin violent agitation; the sovereign people has allowed itself to be\r\nmagnetised by its flatterers, and it will require some time to be able\r\nto shake off the trance. The healing beam, which will fix the gaze of\r\nthe multitude and dissipate the charm that envelopes them, has not yet\r\nbroke forth from the East, or from the West; meanwhile the merchants\r\nand manufacturers, who are stretched upon the coals, writhe in vain;\r\nthere is no answer to their cries.\r\n\r\nThe Bank, meantime, disappears from sight and keeps silence; it\r\ncontinues to attend to its own business, and prudently confines itself\r\nto that alone. Its best policy is to avoid as much as possible making\r\nitself the subject of common talk. The demagogues have raised such a\r\ncry of monopoly and aristocracy, that the people have come to believe\r\nthe Bank a colossus of aristocracy, a prop of monopoly. These words\r\n_monopoly_ and _aristocracy_ are here, what the word _Jesuits_ was in\r\nFrance a few years ago; if the enemies of any institution can write\r\non its back this kind of _abracadabra_, it is pointed at, hooted\r\nat, and hissed at by the multitude. Such is the magic power of these\r\nwords, that speculators employ them on all occasions as charms to draw\r\ncustomers. For example, at the head of the advertisements of steamboats\r\nyou read in staring characters: NO MONOPOLY!!! It is pitiful to say\r\nthat the Bank of the United States has a monopoly, when there are no\r\nless than five hundred other banks in the country; by this course of\r\nreasoning one might convict the sun of enjoying a monopoly of light.\r\nAnd yet the multitude has believed it, and believes it still. Now the\r\nbest policy for those against whom such a storm of unpopularity is\r\nraised, is to run for port, as the sailors do in a gale of wind. The\r\nBank has twice attempted to strike a blow, by taking advantage of the\r\nmistakes of its enemies, and both times the stroke has recoiled on\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe first time, the subject of dispute was a draft on the French\r\ngovernment, which was sold to the Bank last year by the Federal\r\ngovernment, and which France refused to pay; the draft was, therefore,\r\nprotested, and then paid by the correspondent of the Bank in Paris in\r\nhonour of the endorser. In this affair the Executive of the United\r\nStates committed two faults: 1. It was an act of indiscretion to draw\r\non the French government, before the Chambers had made the necessary\r\nappropriation for paying the stipulated indemnity; 2. Instead of\r\ndrawing on the French government by a bill of exchange, and selling\r\nthe bill to the Bank, without knowing whether it would be accepted,\r\nthe Executive would have conducted itself with more propriety towards\r\nFrance, towards the Bank, and towards itself, if it had authorized\r\nthe Bank to receive the moneys paid by the French government, in the\r\ncapacity of its agent or attorney. By the commercial practice of all\r\ncountries, and of this in particular, the Bank had a right to damages,\r\nand it put in its claim. Its object in taking this step, was much\r\nmore to expose the errors of the Executive, than to pocket the sum of\r\n50,000 or 80,000 dollars. But its adversaries immediately raised the\r\ncry, that the Bank was not contented with exacting enormous sums from\r\nthe sweat of the people to the profit of the stockholders, (observe\r\nthat the dividends of the Bank are moderate, compared with those of\r\nother banking companies in the country, and that the Federal government\r\nis itself the largest share-holder); but that it was now attempting,\r\nby petty chicanery, to extort a portion of the public revenue, and to\r\nbury the _people's money in Biddle's pockets_. To this reasoning, and\r\nit passes for demonstration, the multitude answered by imprecations\r\nagainst monopoly and the moneyed aristocracy, and by renewed shouts of\r\nHURRAH FOR JACKSON!\r\n\r\nA few days since we witnessed another episode of this kind. The Bank\r\nis charged, by act of Congress, with the duty of paying the pensions\r\nof the old soldiers of the revolution. It performs the service\r\ngratuitously, and it is notoriously a troublesome one. It has received\r\nseveral sums of money for this object, and at this moment has about\r\n500,000 dollars in its vaults, intended for the next payments. The\r\nAdministration, desirous of transferring this agency from the Bank,\r\nhas demanded the funds, books, and papers connected with it. The Bank\r\nreplied, that it has been made the depository of this trust by act\r\nof Congress, and that it cannot, ought not, and will not surrender\r\nit, unless in obedience to an act of Congress. The Bank was right;\r\nthe refusal was founded in justice; but mark the consequences. Its\r\nadversaries express the greatest sympathy for these illustrious\r\nrelics of the revolution, whom the arrogance of the Bank, as they\r\nsay, is about to plunge, at the close of their career, into the most\r\ndreadful misery; they pour forth the most pathetic lamentations over\r\nthese glorious defenders of the country, whom a _money-corporation_\r\nis about to strip of the provision made for their declining years by\r\nthe nation's gratitude. You may imagine all the noisy arguments and\r\npatriotic harangues, that can be delivered on this text. On the 4th\r\nof February, the President sent a message to Congress in the same\r\nstrain. All this is mere declamation, of the most common-place and\r\nthe most hypocritical kind; for who will prevent the deliverers of\r\nAmerica from duly receiving their pensions, except those who shall\r\nrefuse them drafts on the Bank, which the Bank would pay at once? But\r\na people under fascination is not influenced by reason, and it is at\r\nthis moment believed by the multitude that the Bank has determined to\r\nkill the noble veterans of Independence by hunger. Once more, then,\r\nanathemas against monopoly, hatred to the moneyed aristocracy! HURRAH\r\nFOR JACKSON! JACKSON FOREVER!\r\n\r\nWhenever, therefore, the Bank has allowed itself to be drawn into a\r\nconflict, which is the enemy's country, it is pronounced to be in the\r\nwrong, though it were ten times right. On the contrary, when it has\r\nkept to its discounts and credits, it has always been able, without\r\nopening its mouth, to belie the charges of its enemies, who not only\r\nimpute to it the atrocious crime of being suspected of aristocracy and\r\nmonopoly, but attribute to it now the public distress, of which they\r\ndenied the existence a few months ago, and of which they are themselves\r\nthe authors. Very lately the Bank came to the relief of several\r\nlocal banks, which were in danger of failing, and a few days since\r\nit opened its coffers liberally to Allen & Co., one of the principal\r\nhouses in the country, who, although having a capital much beyond the\r\namount of their debts, were obliged, by the pressure of the times, to\r\nsuspend payments; the failure of that house, which has no less than\r\n24 branches, would have involved hundreds of others. This is the only\r\nway in which the Bank should assume the offensive; such acts, without\r\na word of comment, would secure it the favour and the support of all\r\nimpartial and enlightened men, and the gratitude of the commercial\r\ninterest, much more completely than the most eloquent protests against\r\nthe measures of this or that secretary, or the most ingenious and able\r\ndefence of itself.\r\n\r\nI am more and more convinced that the United States will reap advantage\r\nfrom this crisis; sooner or later the reform of the banking system must\r\nresult from it. Very probably, the National Bank, if it is maintained,\r\nand the local banks, will hereafter be less absolutely separated from\r\nthe Federal and State governments; that is to say, that the Federal\r\nand local governments will assume the control of the Banks, and\r\nconsequently the banks will become a part of the governments. In this\r\nway many of the abuses of the banking system will be reformed, and the\r\nlegitimate and just influence of the banks will be strengthened. It\r\nwould be easy to cite numerous facts, which go to prove the tendency\r\ntowards this result; thus in some of the States, the Legislatures\r\nhave established, or are occupied in establishing banks, in which the\r\nState is a share-holder to the amount of one half or two fifths of\r\nthe capital, appoints a certain number of the directors, and reserves\r\nto itself an important control over the operations. There are some\r\nStates, as for example, Illinois, in which every other kind of bank is\r\nexpressly forbidden by the constitution.\r\n\r\nRepublican publicists acknowledge only three classes of powers,\r\nthe executive, legislative, and judicial; but it will soon be seen\r\nin the United States, that there is also a financial power, or at\r\nleast the banks will form a branch of government quite as efficient\r\nas either of the others. The Bank of the United States is more\r\nessential to the prosperity of the country than the Executive, as now\r\norganized. The latter, conducts a little diplomatic intercourse,\r\nwell or ill, with the European powers, nominates and removes some\r\nunimportant functionaries, manoeuvres an army of 6,000 men in the\r\nwestern wilderness, adds now and then some sticks of timber to the\r\ndozen ships of war that are on the stocks at Portsmouth, Boston, New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, Washington, Norfolk, and Pensacola. All this\r\nmight actually cease to be done without endangering the safety of\r\nthe country, and without seriously wounding its prosperity, that is,\r\nits industry. But take from the country its institutions for the\r\nmaintenance of credit, or only that which controls and regulates all\r\nthe others, the Bank of the United States, and you plunge it into a\r\ncommercial anarchy which would finally result in political anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe word politics cannot have the same meaning in the United States\r\nas in Europe. The United States, are not engaged, like the nations of\r\nEurope, in territorial combinations and the preservation of the balance\r\nof a continent, nor are they entangled in treaties of Westphalia or\r\nVienna. They are free from all those difficulties, which in Europe\r\narise from a difference of origin or religion, or from the conflict\r\nbetween rival pretensions, between old interests and new interests.\r\nThey have no neighbour, which excites their suspicions. The policy of\r\nthe United States consists in the extension of their commerce, and the\r\noccupation by agriculture of the vast domain, which nature has given\r\nthem; in these points is involved the great mass of their general\r\nand individual interests; these are the objects which inflame their\r\npolitical and individual passions. As the Banks are the soul of their\r\ncommerce, their rising manufactures, and even their agriculture, it is\r\nevident that the success of their _politics_ is intimately and directly\r\nconnected with the right organization of their banking system. The\r\nreal government of the country, that is to say, the control of its\r\nessential interests, is as much in the banks as in any body or power\r\nestablished by the constitution. The time is come when this fact should\r\nbe recognised and sanctioned. As among a military people the office of\r\nmarshal or lord-high-constable is the first in the kingdom, so among a\r\npeople which has nothing to do with war, and has only to employ itself\r\nwith its industry, that of President of the central bank, for example,\r\nought to be a public charge, _political_, in the sense adapted to the\r\ncondition and wants of that people,--and one of the first rank in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, it may be said, that what is now passing\r\nin the United States, is a struggle in which the combatants are, on\r\nthe one side, the military interest and the law, which have hitherto\r\ndivided between them the control of public affairs, and on the other,\r\nthe financial interest, which now claims its share in them; the two\r\nfirst have coalesced against the last, and have succeeded for a time\r\nin raising the multitude against it, but they will fail in the long\r\nrun, since the multitude has more to gain from it than from them. It\r\nis said, that, when the committee of the New York merchants went to\r\nWashington to present a petition with 10,000 names in favour of the\r\nBank, the President observed to them, that they declared the grievances\r\nof the brokers, capitalists, and merchants of Wall Street and Pearl\r\nStreet, but that Wall Street and Pearl Street were not the people. I\r\ndo not know whether the story is true or not, but I know that such an\r\nanswer would express the opinion of the dominant party. There is a\r\nschool here, which attempts to eliminate the wealthy classes from the\r\npeople, and which is just the reverse of the old school of European\r\nTories, which reduces the people to the higher classes, and excludes\r\nfrom that rank the greater number of the nation. And nothing can be\r\nmore unjust, for in order to measure the real importance of the men of\r\nPearl Street and Wall Street, it is only necessary to consider what New\r\nYork would be without them.\r\n\r\nIn fifty years the population of New York has increased tenfold, its\r\nwealth probably an hundred fold; its animating influences have been\r\nfelt for hundreds of miles around. This unparalleled growth is not\r\nthe work of lawyers and military men; the merit belongs chiefly to\r\nthe industry, the capital, the intelligence, and the enterprise of\r\nthat, numerically speaking, insignificant minority of Wall Street\r\nand Pearl Street. It is very easy to cant about the aristocracy of\r\ndollars, and those filthy metals which men call gold and silver. And\r\nyet have not those vile metals ceased to be vile, when they are the\r\nfruit of the industry and enterprise of those who possess them? If\r\nthere is a country in the world where it is preposterous to prate about\r\nthe aristocracy of dollars, and about the filthy metals, it is this.\r\nFor here, more than any where else, every body has some employment;\r\nwhoever has capital is engaged in turning it to profit, and can neither\r\nincrease nor even keep it without great activity and vigilance. A man's\r\nwealth is, therefore, very generally in the ratio of his importance,\r\nand even of his agricultural, manufacturing, or commercial capacity.\r\nThe merchants are not without their faults; they are disposed to weigh\r\neverything in their doubloon-scales, and a people governed entirely by\r\nmerchants would certainly be to be pitied. But a people governed by\r\nlawyers or by soldiers would be no happier and no freer. The policy of\r\nthe Hamburg Senate in basely giving up unhappy political fugitives to\r\nthe English executioner, deserves the contempt of every man of honour;\r\nbut would the rule of Russian or even of Napoleon's bayonets, or the\r\nbabbling anarchy of the Directory, be less loathsome to those whose\r\nheart beats with the love of liberty or with feelings of individual and\r\nnational honour?\r\n\r\nThe revolutions of ages, which change religion, manners, and customs,\r\nmodify also the nature of the powers that regulate society. Providence\r\nhumbles the mighty, when they obstinately shut their eyes to the new\r\nspirit of the age, and raises up the lowly, whom this new spirit fires.\r\nFour thousand years ago, it was one of the most important dignities\r\nin Egypt to have the charge of embalming the sacred birds or of\r\nspreading the litter of the bull Apis. In the Eastern empire the post\r\nof _protovestiary_ was one of the first in the state, and not to go so\r\nfar back, it was the ambition of many in France, hardly four years ago,\r\nto become _gentilhomme de la chambre_, as the _groom of the stole_,\r\nor, in other words, the _servant in charge of the wardrobe_, is now\r\none of the grand dignitaries of England. Nobody now-a-days embalms\r\nsacred birds, nobody spreads the litter of Apis. No one intrigues\r\nfor the post of protovestiary or gentleman of the chamber, and from\r\npresent appearances, I do not think that even the dignity of Groom of\r\nthe Stole, will long be an object of ambition in England. There are no\r\nlonger lord-high-constables, or great vassals, or knights-errant, or\r\npeers of France in the old sense of the word. The French aristocracy,\r\nso brilliant fifty years ago, has fallen like corn before the reaper.\r\nThe mansions of the old heroes have become factories; the convents have\r\nbeen changed into spinning-works; I have seen Gothic naves in the best\r\nstyle of art transformed into workshops or granaries, and our brave\r\ntroops have become peaceable labourers on the military roads.\r\n\r\nBoards of petty clerks, whom the Castellans had employed to record\r\ntheir sovereign decrees, became in France _parlements_, which braved\r\nthe kings and assumed to be guardians of the laws of the realm. At\r\npresent the forge masters of Burgundy and the Nivernais, the distillers\r\nof Montpelier, the clothiers of Sedan and Elbeuf, have taken the place\r\nof the _parlements_. German princes, who can boast of their fifty\r\nquarters, dance attendance in the imperial, royal, or ministerial\r\nantechambers, while their Majesties or their Excellencies are\r\nconversing familiarly with some banker who has no patent of nobility,\r\nand who even disdains to oblige his royal friends by accepting one. The\r\nEast India Company, a company of merchants if ever there was one, has\r\nmore subjects than the emperors of Russia and Austria together. If in\r\nthe Old World, where the old interests had marked every corner of the\r\nland with their stamp, the old interests, the military and the law, are\r\nthus obliged to come to terms with the new interest of industry, with\r\nthe power of money, how can it be possible, that, in the New World,\r\nwhere the past has never taken deep root, where all thoughts are turned\r\ntoward business and wealth, this same power will not force its way into\r\nthe political scene, in spite of the opposition of its adversaries and\r\nits envious rivals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RICHMOND, (VA.) MARCH 15, 1834.\r\n\r\nThree thousand years ago the kings of the earth were happy; happy\r\nas a king; but the old proverb is now become a falsehood. Then no\r\nConstantinople was coveted; the citadels of Antwerp and Ancona were\r\nnot built. No one troubled himself about the Rhenish frontier; the\r\nnatural and simple Herodotus told marvellous tales, like those of the\r\n_Arabian Nights_, about the country watered by the Rhine. The banks\r\nof the Danube were trackless morasses; Vienna was not yet, nor of\r\ncourse the Treaty of Vienna. Peace reigned between the sovereigns, or\r\nat least their contests were real together academical, philosophical,\r\nand literary. The good king Nectanebus, an enlightened prince, a\r\npatron of the arts, played charades with his neighbours, the mighty\r\nmonarchs of Asia; he guessed all their riddles without their being\r\nable to solve his in turn; his glory was unmatched, his people rolled\r\nin prosperity. The condition of men of letters and science was, to\r\nbe sure, somewhat of the meanest; grammarians and philosophers were\r\nsometimes dragged to market with halters on their necks, to be sold\r\nlike cattle, a treatment to which none but negroes are now subject.\r\nBut if they were men of genius, their good star threw them into the\r\nhands of the best of masters, such as Xanthus, the most patient and\r\nkind of men, or good natured princes, like Nectanebus, who knew how to\r\nappreciate true merit. Æsop having become the property of this good\r\nking, soon got to be his counsellor, friend, and confidant, revised\r\nhis charades and riddles, and suggested new ones to the king in such\r\na modest way, that Nectanebus really believed himself the author of\r\nthem. One day Nectanebus, by his advice, proposed to his rival monarchs\r\nthis difficult problem; How would you build a city in the air? After\r\nthey had puzzled their brains without success, Nectanebus prepared to\r\ngive a solution of the question in the presence of the ambassadors\r\nof the Asiatic sovereigns solemnly convoked; Æsop put some little\r\nboys in baskets, which were carried up into the air by eagles trained\r\nfor the purpose, and the boys began to cry out to the astonished\r\nambassadors; \"Give us stone and mortar, and we will build you a city.\"\r\nThis old story has often occurred to my mind since I have been in the\r\nUnited States, and I have often said to myself, if Æsop's boys had\r\nbeen Americans, instead of having been subjects of king Nectanebus,\r\nthey would, have demanded materials, not for building a city, but\r\nfor constructing a railroad. In fact there is a perfect mania in this\r\ncountry on the subject of railroads.\r\n\r\nWhile at Liverpool, I went aboard the Pacific to engage a berth, and\r\nCapt. Waite, a very worthy man, who believes in God with all his heart,\r\nand is not any the less on that account a very skilful commander, and\r\na most intrepid sailor, offered me the latest American newspapers.\r\nThe first I opened happened to be the _Railroad Journal_. Soon after\r\nsailing I fell sea-sick, and had scarcely a moment's relief till my\r\narrival at New York; of all my recollections of the voyage, the most\r\ndistinct is that of having heard the word railroad occurring once\r\nevery ten minutes, in the conversation of the passengers. At New York,\r\nI went to visit the docks for building and repairing vessels; after\r\nhaving examined the dry dock and two or three other docks, my guide,\r\nhimself an enthusiast on the subject of railroads, carried me to the\r\nrailroad-dock, where the ships are moved along a railway. In Virginia,\r\nI found railroads at the bottom of the coal mines, which is not,\r\nindeed, new to a European. At Philadelphia I visited the excellent\r\npenitentiary, where everything was so neat, quiet, and comfortable,\r\n(if that word may be applied to a prison), in comparison with the\r\nabominable prisons in France, which are noisy, filthy, unhealthy, cold\r\nin winter, and damp in summer. The warden, Mr Wood, who manages the\r\ninstitution with great vigilance and philanthropy, after having shown\r\nme the prisoners' cells, the yards in which they take the air, the\r\nkitchen where the cooking is done by steam, and allowed me to visit one\r\nof the convicts, a poor fellow from Alsace, said to me, just as I was\r\ntaking my leave; \"But you have not seen everything yet, I must show you\r\nmy railroad;\" and in fact there was a railroad in the prison, for the\r\ncart in which food was brought to the prisoners.\r\n\r\nSome days ago I happened to be in the little city of Petersburg, which\r\nstands at the falls of the Appomattox, and near which there is an\r\nexcellent railroad. A merchant of the city took me to a manufactory\r\nof tobacco, in which some peculiar processes were employed. In these\r\nworks was manufactured that sort of tobacco which most Americans chew,\r\nand will chew for some time to come, in spite of the severe, but in\r\nthis matter just, censures of English travellers, unless the fashion\r\nof vetoes should spread in the United States, and the women should\r\nset theirs on the use of tobacco, with as unyielding a resolution, as\r\nthe President has shown towards the Bank. After having wandered about\r\nthe workshops amidst the poor little slaves by whom they are filled,\r\nI was stopping to look at some of these blacks, who appeared to me\r\nalmost white, and who had not more than one eighth of African blood in\r\ntheir veins, when my companion said to me, \"As you are interested in\r\nrailroads, you must see the one belonging to the works.\" Accordingly\r\nwe went to the room where the tobacco is packed in kegs, and subjected\r\nto a powerful pressure. The apparatus for pressing is a very peculiar\r\ncontrivance, which I will not now stop to describe, but of which the\r\nmost important part is a moveable railroad, suspended from the ceiling.\r\nThus the Americans have railroads in the water, in the bowels of the\r\nearth, and in the air. The benefits of the invention are so palpable to\r\ntheir practical good sense, that they endeavour to make an application\r\nof it everywhere and to everything, right or wrong, and when they\r\ncannot construct a real, profitable railroad across the country from\r\nriver to river, from city to city, or from State to State, they get one\r\nup, at least, as a plaything, or until they can accomplish something\r\nbetter, under the form of a machine.\r\n\r\nThe distance from Boston to New Orleans is 1600 miles, or twice the\r\ndistance from Havre to Marseilles. It is highly probable, that within\r\na few years this immense line will be covered by a series of railroads\r\nstretching from bay to bay, from river to river, and offering to the\r\never-impatient Americans the service of their rapid cars at the points\r\nwhere the steamboats leave their passengers. This is not a castle\r\nin the air, like so many of those grand schemes which are projected\r\namidst the fogs of the Seine, the Loire, and the Garonne; it is already\r\nhalf completed. The railroad from Boston to Providence is in active\r\nprogress; the work goes on _à l'Américaine_, that is to say, rapidly.\r\nFrom New York to Philadelphia, there will soon be not only one open to\r\ntravel, but two in competition with each other, the one on the right,\r\nthe other on the left bank of the Delaware; the passage between the two\r\ncities will be made in seven hours, five hours on the railroad, and\r\ntwo in the steamboat, in the beautiful Hudson and the magnificent Bay\r\nof New York, which the Americans, who are not afflicted with modesty,\r\ncompare with the Bay of Naples. From Philadelphia, travellers go to\r\nBaltimore by the Delaware and Chesapeake, and by the Newcastle and\r\nFrenchtown railroad, in eight hours; from Baltimore to Washington, a\r\nrailroad has been resolved upon, a company chartered, the shares taken,\r\nand the work begun, all within the space of a few months. Between\r\nWashington and Blakely, in North Carolina, 60 miles of railroad are\r\ncompleted, from Blakely northwards. A company has just been chartered\r\nto complete the remaining space, that is, from Richmond to the Potomac,\r\na distance of 70 miles, and the Potomac bears you to the Federal city\r\nby Mt. Vernon, a delightful spot, the patrimony of George Washington,\r\nwhere he passed his honoured old age, where his body now reposes in\r\na modest tomb. Between Washington and Blakely, those who prefer the\r\nsteamboats, may take another route; by descending the Chesapeake to\r\nNorfolk, they will find another railroad, 70 miles in length, of which\r\ntwo thirds are now finished, and which carries them to Blakely, and\r\neven beyond. Blakely is a new town, which you will not find on any map,\r\nborn of yesterday; it is the eldest, and as yet the only daughter of\r\nthe Petersburg and Blakely railroad. From Blakely to Charleston the\r\ndistance is great, but the Americans are enterprising, and there is no\r\nregion in the world in which railroads can be constructed so easily and\r\nso cheaply; the surface has been graded by nature, and the vast forests\r\nwhich cover it, will furnish the wood of which the railroad will be\r\nmade; for here most of these works have a wooden superstructure. From\r\nCharleston, a railroad 137 miles in length, as yet the longest in the\r\nworld, extends to Augusta, whence to Montgomery, Alabama, there is a\r\nlong interval to be supplied. From this last town steamboats descend\r\nthe River Alabama to Mobile, and those who do not wish to pay their\r\nrespects to the Gulf of Mexico, on their way to New Orleans, will soon\r\nfind a railroad which will spare them the necessity of offering this\r\nact of homage to the memory of the great Cortez.[O]\r\n\r\nWithin ten years this whole line will be completed, and traversed by\r\nlocomotive engines, provided the present crisis terminates promptly\r\nand happily, as I hope it will. Ten years is a long time in these\r\ndays, and a plan, whose execution requires ten years, seems like a\r\nromance or a dream. But in respect to railroads, the Americans have\r\nalready something to show. Pennsylvania, which by the last census,\r\nin 1830, contained only 1,348,000 inhabitants, has 325 miles of\r\nrailroads actually completed, or which will be so within the year,\r\nwithout reckoning 76 miles which the capitalists of Philadelphia have\r\nconstructed in the little States of New Jersey and Delaware. The total\r\nlength of all the railroads in France is 95 miles, that is, a little\r\nmore than what the citizens of Philadelphia, in their liberality,\r\nhave given to their poor neighbours. In the State of New York, whose\r\npopulation is the most adventurous and the most successful in their\r\nspeculations, there are at present only four or five short railroads,\r\nbut if the sixth part of those which are projected and authorized by\r\nthe Legislature, are executed, New York will not be behind Pennsylvania\r\nin this respect. The merchants of Baltimore, which at the time of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence contained 6,000 inhabitants, and which now\r\nnumbers 100,000, have taken it into their heads to make a railroad\r\nbetween their city and the Ohio, a distance of above 300 miles. They\r\nhave begun it with great spirit, and have now finished about one third\r\nof the whole road. In almost every section east of the Ohio and the\r\nMississippi, there are railroads projected, in progress, or completed,\r\nand on most of them locomotive steam-engines are employed. There are\r\nsome in the Alleghanies, whose inclined planes are really terrific,\r\nfrom their great inclination; these were originally designed only\r\nfor the transportation of goods, but passenger-cars have been set up\r\non them, at the risk of breaking the necks of travellers. There are\r\nhere works well constructed and ill constructed; there are some that\r\nhave cost dear, (from 40,000 to 50,000 dollars a mile,) and others\r\nthat have cost little, (from 10,000 to 15,000 dollars a mile). New\r\nOrleans has one, a very modest one to be sure, it being only five\r\nmiles long, but it will soon have others, and after all, it is before\r\nold Orleans, for the latter has yet to wait till its capitalists,\r\nseized with some violent fit of patriotism, shall be ready to make the\r\nsacrifice of devoting some ten or twelve per cent. of their capital\r\nto the construction of a railroad thence to Paris. Virginia, whose\r\npopulation is nearly the same with that of the Department of the North,\r\nand which is inferior in wealth, already has 75 miles of railroad\r\nfully completed, and 110 in progress, exclusive of those begun this\r\nyear. The Department of the North, where it would be quite as easy to\r\nconstruct them, and where they would be more productive, has not a\r\nfoot completed, or in progress, and hardly a foot projected. Observe,\r\nmoreover, that I here speak of railroads alone, the rage for which is\r\nquite new in America, while that for canals is of very old date (for\r\nin this country fifteen years is an age), and has achieved wonders.\r\nThere are States which contain 500, 800, or 1,000 miles of canals. We\r\nin France are of all people the boldest in theory and speculation, and\r\nwe have made the world tremble by our political experiments; but during\r\nthe last twenty years we have shown ourselves the most timid of nations\r\nin respect to physical improvements.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[O] For observations on these statements see _Letter_ XXI., and _the\r\nNotes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BANKS.--THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    WASHINGTON, APRIL 10, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe drama which has been passing in the United States since the opening\r\nof the session, has now reached the end of the first act. The two\r\nHouses have had under consideration the subject of the removal of the\r\npublic deposits from the Bank of the United States to the local banks,\r\nby the Executive, and both of them have come to a decision. The Senate\r\nhas declared, by a majority of 28 to 18, that the reasons alleged\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury in justification of the measure,\r\nwere neither satisfactory nor sufficient, and, by a majority of 26\r\nto 20, that the conduct of the President in this matter was neither\r\nconformable to the constitution nor to the laws. This is the first\r\ninstance, since the adoption of the Federal constitution, of a censure\r\nof the chief magistrate of the nation by the Senate. The House has\r\nresolved, on its part, that the charter of the Bank ought not to be\r\nrenewed, that the public deposits ought not to be restored to it, and\r\nthat they should remain in the safe-keeping of the local banks. The\r\nfirst resolve passed by a vote of 132 to 92; the majority for the two\r\nothers was much less, 118 to 103, and 117 to 105. It has been resolved,\r\nby a large majority, 171 to 42, that the conduct of the Bank should\r\nbe made a subject of investigation, but this majority includes many\r\nfriends of the Bank.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Bank will not be the object of this\r\ncampaign; the more vigourously it is defended, the more hateful it\r\nbecomes to the democracy. Those who feel an interest in their country\r\nand its institutions, ought to make an effort to turn the debate toward\r\nsome other point, for both sides have become heated and exasperated\r\nin the struggle, and already violence has been threatened. The most\r\nbrilliant services have been forgotten, the purest characters trampled\r\nunder foot. The Globe, the avowed organ of the administration, pours\r\nforth the vilest slanders on men, such as Messrs Clay, Calhoun, and\r\nWebster, of whom any country in the world would be proud. It repeated,\r\nand unhappily it reiterates still, that the votes of, the Senate have\r\nbeen bought by the Bank. On the other hand, General Jackson, to whom\r\nit is impossible to deny the possession of eminent qualities, has\r\nbeen himself exposed to the vilest indignities; the gray hairs of\r\nthat brave old man have been insulted in the most scandalous manner.\r\nAttempts have even been made to throw ridicule on his victory at New\r\nOrleans, the most brilliant affair in the American annals, as if his\r\nglory were not the common property of the country. Some hot heads have\r\neven talked of recurring to violence; commerce and enterprise have\r\nbeen struck numb; for want of means, the great works of Pennsylvania\r\nhave been in danger of being brought to a stand. But at present there\r\nappears to be a general wish to bring back a calm; the failure of a\r\ncertain number of individuals, and especially that of some banks, have\r\nproved a signal of alarm, which has recalled every one to a sense\r\nof the common danger, the general ruin that threatened the country.\r\nThere has been a failure of a bank in Florida, of one in New Jersey,\r\nand of two in Maryland, one of which, that of the Bank of Maryland in\r\nBaltimore, has caused a great sensation. The leading men of all parties\r\nhave set themselves in earnest to search out some means of bringing the\r\ncommercial crisis to an end. There is room to hope, therefore, that\r\nthe debate will lose its bitterness, and at the same time will take a\r\nwider range; instead of quarrelling about the particular question of\r\nthe Bank, it were to be wished that the higher questions of political\r\neconomy should be discussed, such as that of a mixed currency, in which\r\nthere should be the proper mixture of paper and the metals necessary\r\nto give it stability, without keeping, as is the case in Europe, a\r\nlarge unproductive capital in the shape of specie; and that of a system\r\nof institutions of credit, banks of loan and discount, of deposit\r\nand exchange, powerful enough to serve as a spring and a stay to the\r\nindustry of the country, and yet so balanced in respect to each other\r\nand the powers of the government, as not to be dangerous to the public\r\nliberties. A very able speech of Mr Calhoun's has already drawn the\r\ngeneral attention to the subject of financial reform, and one of the\r\nsenators friendly to the administration, Mr Benton, has embodied some\r\nof Mr Calhoun's ideas in the shape of a bill.\r\n\r\nIt is now universally agreed, that to obtain a solid and stable\r\ncurrency, it is necessary to keep a certain quantity of gold and\r\nsilver in the country; it is seen that while there are paper dollars,\r\nthe silver dollars will disappear, that ten-dollar notes necessarily\r\nexpel the eagles, and that half-eagles will not stay where there\r\nare five-dollar bills. It is, therefore, proposed to abolish the\r\nissue of notes of less than ten or even twenty dollars, but all that\r\nCongress can do without the aid of a National Bank, is to prohibit\r\nthe reception, by the collectors of the customs, of the bills of\r\nany bank which has in circulation notes of less than ten or twenty\r\ndollars; for Congress has no direct power over the local banks. This\r\nmeasure, however, would be insufficient; for the amount of money paid\r\nfor customs bears a very small proportion to the whole circulation\r\nof the country, and consequently would not affect the circulation in\r\ndistricts remote from the sea coast. The Administration does not deny\r\nthe necessity of a police for controlling and regulating the banks;\r\nit seems disposed to effect it by means of some of the local banks,\r\nwhich should act under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nand to which should be granted certain privileges, such as that of\r\nbeing the depositories of the public money without paying interest.\r\nBut this plan has some disadvantages; it would invest the Secretary,\r\nthat is the President, with a great discretionary power, which is\r\nwholly at war with the political maxims of American government. It is\r\na received truth in the United States, that the sword and the purse\r\nought not to be in the same hands. Beside it is doubtful whether this\r\ncontrol would be sufficiently powerful and sufficiently enlightened,\r\nand finally it would be difficult by means of this chain of local banks\r\nto answer one of the most pressing wants of the country, facility of\r\nexchange; because they are, and must be as slightly connected with each\r\nother, as the sovereign States from which they hold their charters.\r\nTo exterminate small bank-notes the surest agent would be a National\r\nBank, and Congress has the power to establish one. This power, which is\r\ndisputed because all its powers are disputed, would not be contested,\r\nif it were stipulated that the Bank should obtain the consent of each\r\nState, before establishing a branch within its limits. It would then\r\nbe sufficient that the Bank should not receive the bills of any other\r\nbank, which issued notes of less than 10 or 20 dollars, or which\r\nreceived the bills of other banks, that issued notes less than the\r\nsame minimum. In fine, a National Bank is an admirable instrument of\r\nexchange, and the most influential friends of the Administration are\r\nconvinced of the necessity of an institution of the sort. I cannot\r\nbelieve that the President, and especially the Vice-President, are\r\nreally as much opposed to one, as they have the air of being. As it\r\nis possible to conceive of a combination of circumstances, which may\r\nreconcile its existence with the interests and views of Mr Van Buren\r\n(such would be, for instance, the creation of a Bank of which the seat\r\nshould be New York, instead of Philadelphia), it may be hoped that\r\nsooner or later, under one form or another, Mr Van Buren may yield to\r\nthe necessity of the case. It is true that out of hatred to the present\r\nBank, the prejudices of the multitude have been excited against the\r\nestablishment of any bank at all, and it is much more easy to rouse the\r\npopular passions than to control them when once let loose; this kind\r\nof game has resulted in the self-murder of many a man's popularity.\r\nBut in this matter the voice of the public interest and of individual\r\ninterest will speak so loud, that it would be astonishing if it did not\r\nmake itself heard by a people, so much more sensible and reflecting\r\nthan most of the European people. There is, then, in short, still some\r\nchance for a Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal features, in which both parties seem to\r\nme to be at present tacitly agreed. The capital of the Bank to be about\r\n50 millions. The shares of the present Bank, representing a capital of\r\n35 millions, to be exchanged at par for shares in the new bank; the\r\nrest of the capital to be subscribed by the individual States, thus\r\ngiving the Bank a more truly national character: The rate of discount\r\nto be reduced from 6 to 5 per cent.; Mr Forsyth, a Senator friendly to\r\nthe administration, has demanded this modification: The laws relative\r\nto public and private deposits to be changed in conformity with the\r\npropositions of Mr Cambreleng: The seat of the mother bank to be\r\ntransferred to New York: The operations of the Bank to be subjected to\r\nmore strict regulations than those of the old Bank have been: The Bank\r\nto be required to keep on hand a larger amount of reserved profits, or\r\nsome other provision borrowed from the bank of England to be adopted,\r\nin order to give more security to the institution.\r\n\r\nIt would not, probably, be impossible to unite a majority of the two\r\nHouses in favour of a plan which should embrace these features. But\r\nthere is another subject about which little is said, and upon which\r\nno one has yet publicly declared himself, although there are many\r\nwho have thought much about it, and it will not be easy to reconcile\r\nopinions upon it. How shall the Bank be governed? What relation shall\r\nthere be between the administration of the Bank, and the Federal and\r\nState governments? How and by whom shall the President of the Bank be\r\nchosen? This subject, about which there is a total silence, appears\r\nto me to be of so vital importance, that I am convinced that what has\r\noccurred in the United States during the last six months, would never\r\nhave taken place, if the nomination of the President of the Bank had\r\nbeen lodged with the President of the United States. In Europe and\r\nparticularly in France, the government of the banks is more or less\r\nin the hands and under the control of the king and the ministers. In\r\nAmerica, conformably with the principles of self-government, the Bank,\r\nlike all the other industrial and financial institutions, has, up to\r\nthis time, governed itself. The Federal government, owning one fifth of\r\nthe shares, names one fifth of the directors; its powers stop there.\r\nThe American axiom, which forbids the union of the sword and the purse\r\nin the same hand, is opposed to the exercise of a controlling influence\r\nover the choice of the President of the Bank by the President of the\r\nUnited States; and yet I am persuaded that the democratic party will\r\nnot be willing to hear of a Bank, in the government of which it could\r\nnot interfere.\r\n\r\nThe upper classes (_bourgeoisie_) are not here what they are in Europe;\r\nwhile in Europe they rule, here they are ruled. Democracy takes its\r\nrevenge in America for the unjust contempt with which it has been\r\nso long treated in Europe. Now it is to these upper classes, that\r\nthe private share-holders of the Bank belong; it is the merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, and capitalists, who will always derive the most direct\r\nbenefit from a National Bank, although all classes must indirectly\r\nderive great advantages from it. From the time when the upper\r\nclasses sanctioned a completely universal suffrage, without making\r\nany exception in favour of natural superiority, whether industrial\r\nor scientific, from the day when they consented that number should\r\nbe every thing, and knowledge and capital nothing, they have signed\r\ntheir own abdication. It is too late to agitate the questions, whether\r\nthis is absolutely a good or an evil, or whether it is well, in the\r\nagricultural States, with a scattered population, such as Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and Illinois, and bad in large and populous cities, the\r\nseats of a vast commerce, such as Philadelphia and New York. This is\r\na matter already settled past recall; when the sword is surrendered,\r\nthe vanquished must submit to take the law from the victor. In case,\r\nthen, of the creation of a new National Bank, the share-holders must\r\nconsent to receive their head, either from the President and Senate,\r\nas other public functionaries are appointed, or from the House of\r\nRepresentatives alone, or from some other similar source. If in a new\r\nor a somewhat modified Bank, the Federal and local governments should\r\nbe stockholders to a large amount, this participation of the President\r\nor the House of Representatives, or of special delegates chosen by the\r\nStates, in the government of the Bank, would appear altogether natural,\r\neven in the eyes of the most exclusive partisans of self government.\r\nIt remains to be seen, whether in this case, the Bank would not be\r\nmore likely to become the instrument of party, a _den of intrigue and\r\ncorruption, a golden calf_, a _monster_, as it is so often unjustly\r\ncalled, than in the present state of things.\r\n\r\nIf this quarrel should be terminated by a compromise, we may expect\r\nthat it will be effected on the basis above stated. The upper classes\r\nwill, perhaps, consider the conditions as hard, but they should beware\r\nof rejecting them. It would be a great gain to them to obtain, under\r\nany form, a decisive sanction of a National Bank, connected with the\r\ngovernment, and therefore incorporated with the interests of the\r\ncountry. Not only are numbers at present against the Bank, and numbers\r\ngive the law here, but the Opposition is not so well organised as the\r\ndemocratic party. The Opposition has, indeed, three leaders, who do not\r\nalways agree; the views of Mr Calhoun of South Carolina do not coincide\r\nwith those of Messrs Clay and Webster on the subjects of the tariff\r\nand States' rights; and Mr Clay, the son of the west, and Mr Webster,\r\nwho comes from Boston, the focus of Federalism, differ on several\r\nconstitutional questions. The democratic party, on the contrary, is\r\nbetter disciplined; the two heads, General Jackson and Mr Van Buren,\r\npresent a formidable union of qualities and faculties. The old General\r\nis firm, prompt, bold, energetic; Mr Van Buren, who sets up for the\r\nAmerican Talleyrand, is mild, conciliating, prudent, and sagacious;\r\nhis adversaries call him the little magician. While the pretensions\r\nof Messrs Clay, Calhoun, and Webster are scarcely to be reconciled\r\nwith each other, and neither of them is willing to be second, Mr Van\r\nBuren is ready to serve under General Jackson for the purpose of\r\nbecoming his successor in the elections of 1836. Every kingdom divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand. But, if no compromise can be made, if the\r\ndemocracy is too untractable, and the upper classes persist in claiming\r\nmore than their position authorises them to do, if the feelings, kept\r\nin a state of excitement, become exasperated on both sides, and the\r\ncontest be too much prolonged, the most frightful consequences may\r\nensue; even the Union may be endangered.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war of Independence, the American Confederacy\r\noccupied only a narrow strip along the Atlantic. Since that time the\r\nwave of an active, enterprising, and rapidly increasing population, has\r\nrolled over the Alleghanies, the Ohio, the Mississippi, more recently\r\nover the Missouri, the Red River, the Arkansas, and I know not how far.\r\nToward the South it is already sweeping over the Sabine, and covering\r\nTexas, while toward the West, it has topped the Rocky Mountains, and\r\nis approaching the Pacific shore. Instead of thirteen States, there\r\nare twentyfour, and the number will soon be increased to twentysix. By\r\nthe side of the old Atlantic strip, two other vast tracts with a more\r\nfertile soil, have yielded up their riches to civilised man; one, at\r\nthe west, comprises the great triangle lying between the Ohio, the\r\nMississippi, and the lakes, and the other at the south, includes the\r\nfertile regions of Florida and Louisiana, which, under the French and\r\nSpanish rule, were a solitary wilderness. The geographical centre of\r\nthe Union fifty years ago was on the banks of the Potomac, on the spot\r\nwhere the city of Washington--that paper capital--now stands; it is now\r\nat Cincinnati, and will soon be near St Louis. In proportion as the\r\nterritory of the Confederacy has been extended, the Federal bond has\r\nbeen weakened. It was nearly snapped asunder during the Nullification\r\ncrisis, occasioned by the resistance of South Carolina to the tariff\r\nadopted under the influence of New England, in order to protect her\r\ngrowing manufactures. If Congress had not satisfied the demands of\r\nSouth Carolina, Virginia would have made common cause with the latter,\r\nand her example would have carried the whole South. The patriotic\r\neloquence of Mr Webster, the moderation of Mr Clay and his prodigies of\r\nparliamentary strategy, the efforts of Mr Livingston, then Secretary\r\nof State, the firm, and, at the same time, conciliatory conduct of\r\nthe President, who, for the first time, heard a bold defiance with\r\npatience, and the calm attitude of the Northern States, prevented for\r\nthe moment a general dissolution of the Union; but the germ of mischief\r\nremains; the charm is broken; the ear has become familiar with the\r\nominous word SEPARATION. A habit has grown up of thinking, and even of\r\ndeclaring, whenever the interests of the North and the South jar, that\r\nthe cure-all will be a dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina keeps her militia organised, and exacts from the State\r\nofficers a special oath of allegiance. Georgia and Alabama contest\r\nthe validity of treaties concluded between the Federal government and\r\nthe Cherokee and Creek nations. (See _Note_ 11.) Most of the States\r\nseek to extend the limits of their individual sovereignty. The\r\ndoctrine of State rights has even insinuated itself into the bosom\r\nof orthodox Philadelphia, for I see by the journals, that a States'\r\nrights dinner is announced there. These symptoms may become full of\r\ndanger in a moment of universal excitement. When the passions are at\r\nthe helm, there is no pause in the course. What, for instance, would\r\nbe the event, if Nullification should find an echo in the same States\r\nof the North, where it has lately been so firmly rejected? It is they\r\nthat have the most direct interest in the establishment of a National\r\nBank; it is they that suffer most from the financial combinations of\r\nGeneral Jackson, and from the objections of Southern statesmen against\r\nthe constitutionality of a bank. Although no allusion is made to this\r\ndanger, it is evident that the solicitude of many persons has been\r\naroused by it, and it is fortunate that it is so, for a more general\r\ndisposition to conciliatory measures is the consequence.\r\n\r\nThe principle of separation is engaged in a deadly conflict with the\r\nspirit of centralisation or consolidation; hardly was the constitution\r\nsigned, when twelve additional articles or Amendments were immediately\r\nadopted, almost all of which contained restrictions on the powers and\r\nattributes of the Federal government. At the same time the authority of\r\nCongress to charter a Bank, and give it powers within the territories\r\nof the States, was contested; on this point, however, the principle of\r\nunion was victorious, and the Bank was established. Next, the right\r\nof engaging in Internal Improvements was denied to Congress, which,\r\nafter a long struggle, has been compelled to resign its claims; General\r\nJackson willed it, and it was done. The National Road, which extends\r\nfrom Washington to the western wilderness, and for which appropriations\r\nhave been annually voted, each professing to be the last, shows what\r\nthe Federal government could do and wished to do. Even the uniform\r\nsystem of weights and measures, seems to be on the point of being\r\nbroken up, in spite of the express provisions of the constitution.\r\nPennsylvania has undertaken, nobody knows why, to establish regulations\r\non this point contrary to the general usage.[P] The public debt is now\r\npaid; that is one Federal tie the less. The Bank, assailed afresh,\r\nis on the point of falling; that is an immense loss to the Federal\r\nprinciple. The Supreme Court of the United States, one of the bulwarks\r\nof the Union, is assaulted. The vast domain of the West, (see _Note_\r\n12,) the national property, seems in danger of being given up to\r\nindividual States, for this disposition is one of the favorite topics\r\nof the democratic party.\r\n\r\nBut if centralisation comes off the worse in Federal politics, it\r\nhas the better within the States. The principal States are engaged\r\nin constructing vast systems of internal communication; they are\r\nestablishing for themselves financial systems, and many of them\r\nare about to set up great banks, which shall exercise within their\r\nrespective limits the salutary influence possessed by the Bank of\r\nthe United States throughout the whole Union. Thus each State, as\r\nit detaches itself from the Federal Union, organises more fully its\r\nown powers, and binds more firmly together its imperfectly combined\r\nelements. But, on the other hand, industry and the spirit of enterprise\r\nrestore to the Union the strength, of which political jealousy and\r\nparty quarrels tend to deprive it. There is not a family at the\r\nNorth, that has not a son or a brother in the South; the community of\r\ninterests daily grows stronger; commerce is a centripetal force; along\r\nthe whole Atlantic coast there is only one mart, New York; there is\r\nonly one of importance on the Gulf of Mexico, New Orleans; and the\r\nrelations of New York and New Orleans make these two cities, instead\r\nof rivals, mutual supports. The railroads and the steamboats spread\r\nover the country the meshes of a net not easily broken; great distances\r\nvanish; before long it will be easy to go from Boston to New Orleans\r\nin eight days, less time than is generally required to go from Brest\r\nto Marseilles. When we reflect on the extent of the Roman empire for\r\nages, we cannot doubt the possibility of maintaining a certain degree\r\nof unity on the American territory, immeasurably vast as it appears to\r\nan eye accustomed to the divisions of the map of Europe. The Romans\r\nhad not attained that degree of perfection in the means of intercourse\r\nwhich we possess; not only had they no knowledge of steamboats and\r\nrailroads, and the telegraph, but they had few highways, and were\r\nunacquainted with the use of carriages hung on springs. The progress\r\nof commercial and financial arts, makes it more easy to manage the\r\nfinancial concerns of the universe now, than it was to administer\r\nthose of a province in the time of Cæsar. I cannot, therefore, make up\r\nmy mind to believe, that the Union will be broken up into fragments,\r\ndriven in different directions and dashing one against another.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is very possible, that the Union will not continue long on\r\nits present footing. Are the relations established between the States\r\nby the constitution of 1789, the most perfect that can be devised\r\nnow? Ought not the unforeseen formation of the two great groups of\r\nthe West and the Southwest be followed by some modification of those\r\nrelations? Would not the subdivision of the general confederacy into\r\nthree subordinate confederacies, conformable to the three great\r\nterritorial divisions, the North, the South, and the West, with a more\r\nintimate union between the members of each group, have the effect of\r\nsatisfying the advocates of State rights, without endangering the\r\nprinciple of union? Would not this arrangement be the means of giving\r\nmore elasticity to the Union? Could not the existence of three partial\r\nconfederacies be reconciled with that of a central authority, invested\r\nwith the undisputed powers of the present Federal government, one army,\r\none navy, one diplomatic representation abroad, one common right of\r\ncitizenship, one Supreme Court, and, as far as possible, one system of\r\ncustoms, and one Bank? These are questions, which it will, perhaps,\r\nbe worth while to examine some day, and even at no distant day. But\r\nit would be desirable, that they should be approached and discussed\r\nwith calmness. If they should be unexpectedly raised in a period of\r\nirritation and bad feelings, they would be the signal of a deplorable\r\ncatastrophe. Union gives strength; North America, once parcelled out\r\ninto hostile fragments, would be of no more weight in the balance of\r\nthe world, than the feeble republics of South America.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[P] An act has been passed by the Pennsylvania legislature, providing\r\nthat 2,000 pounds shall make a ton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PHILADELPHIA, APRIL 24, 1834.\r\n\r\nWhich is the first people in the world? There is no nation which does\r\nnot make pretensions to this superiority. Who in France has not sung in\r\nthe words of Béranger, \"Queen of the world, oh my country! oh France!\"\r\nin the full conviction, that the French nation was predestined to be\r\nforever at the head of the human race, to eclipse all others, in peace\r\nand in war? For myself, before I had crossed the frontier, I believed\r\nmost implicitly, that we were not only the most generous and chivalric\r\nof people, the most intellectual and ingenious, the first in the fine\r\narts, the most amiable and brilliant; but also that we were the most\r\nenlightened, the first in political and industrial arts, the most\r\ninventive and the most practical, in short, the pattern-nation, perfect\r\nand unrivalled. Notwithstanding the rains and fogs of Paris, I supposed\r\nour climate the mildest and the most serene in the world; in spite of\r\nthe Landes and Champagne, I considered it undeniable, that our soil\r\nwas the most fertile, our scenery the most picturesque, in the world.\r\nTrusting to the reports of our exhibitions of industrial skill, I was\r\nready to swear that we had left our neighbours of England a hundred\r\nleagues behind, and that their manufacturers, to avoid being reduced to\r\nbeggary by our competition, would soon be obliged to come over to learn\r\nhow to smelt and refine iron, how to spin cotton, how to manufacture\r\nsteel, how to manage the most gigantic establishments in the most\r\neconomical manner, how to despatch mountains of merchandise beyond sea\r\nmost expeditiously.\r\n\r\nAfter having crossed the frontier one gradually lowers these\r\nmagnificent pretensions; patriotism becomes purer and stronger. In\r\nvisiting foreign parts one sees what is wanting to the prosperity and\r\nglory of his country, and how it might be possible to add some jewels\r\nto her crown. Thus it does not require long observation to see, that\r\nif England might borrow much from us, we have not less to receive from\r\nher. The English are not only more skilful manufacturers and better\r\nmerchants than we are, but they possess in a higher degree than we\r\ndo, those qualities which enable men, after having conceived grand\r\nprojects, to carry them into execution. The English have that practical\r\nsagacity and that unbending perseverance, by which our Titan-like\r\nbattles of the Revolution and the Empire, our impetuous and devoted\r\nenthusiasm, our unparalleled victories, our unmatched triumphs, were\r\nreduced to treaties of Vienna, that is to say, were made to result in\r\nour own humiliation, and in the enthronement of Great Britain on the\r\napex of the European pyramid. The English have less of the gift of\r\nspeech, but more capacity for action, than we have. And it is owing to\r\nthis, that they have found means to extend their colonial possessions,\r\nwhile all other nations were losing theirs; what they lost in the West,\r\nthey have supplied in the East tenfold. They possess that political\r\nsense, to which they owe the peaceful settlement, during the last\r\nthree years, of questions, that seemed destined to shake the granite\r\nfoundations of their island and bury it in the sea. They have achieved\r\ntheir Reform; they have abolished the monopoly of the East India\r\nCompany; they have reconstructed the Bank; they have abolished slavery.\r\nDuring this period, we have been revolving about questions of secondary\r\nimportance, without being able to make a decision; we do not know how\r\nto go to work with monopolies, which, in comparison with the colossal\r\nprivileges of the East India Company, are grains of sand; we, who have\r\ngiven to the world the most conclusive arguments in favour of liberty\r\nof commerce!\r\n\r\nIf in Paris, we consider ourselves, in all, and for all, and forever,\r\nthe pattern-people, at London, the opinion is not less exclusively and\r\ndecidedly in favour of the English. In London, the duke of Wellington\r\nis called the conqueror of Napoleon, which, indeed, is true to the\r\nletter, but is nevertheless perfectly ridiculous, although Lord\r\nWellington is certainly an extraordinary man. I have seen Englishmen\r\npettishly shake their head, when they were told that the sky of England\r\nwas foggy; with a little malice, one might drive them to maintain, that\r\nthey need not envy the climate of Italy, and that even the atmosphere\r\nof Manchester, where the sight of the sun is a rarity, has charms,\r\nin spite of the slanders of its detractors, even for those who have\r\nbreathed the air of Naples. At Madrid, that heroic people, which seems\r\nto be awaking at last from its long lethargy, has not lost the habit of\r\nbelieving in the supremacy of Spain, and there, they dream that they\r\nare yet in the glorious days of Charles V., when the sun never sat on\r\nthe Spanish dominions. And we can pardon this in the noble Castilians;\r\nbut I verily believe, also, that Don Pedro and Don Miguel, those\r\ninterminable pretenders, have each an official journal which tells them\r\ndaily, that the breathless universe has its eyes fixed on their ragged\r\narmies, and that the destinies of the world are settled at Santarem and\r\nSetubal. At Constantinople, in the capital of an empire which exists\r\nonly because the other European powers cannot agree in the division\r\nof the spoils, they call us Christian dogs. In Rome the people still\r\ncall themselves Romans, and this ridiculous misnomer really makes the\r\nTrans-Tiberine populace believe, that military glory is yet the lot of\r\nthe country, and that the _Romans_ will soon resume the character of\r\nlords of the world, magnanimously raising the humble and crushing the\r\npride of the powerful (_Parcere subjectis_, &c.)! In Vienna, on the\r\ncontrary, everybody thinks that Rome is no longer in Rome, but that it\r\nis, of right and in fact, in the archducal capital, that the emperor\r\nis heir by lineal descent to Augustus and Trajan. The devise of an\r\nearly prince of the house of Austria (A. E. I. O. U.),[Q] attests that\r\nthis pretension is almost as old as the house of Hapsburg. In Prussia,\r\nmeanwhile, the young nobles, proud of having studied at the great\r\nuniversities of Jena and Berlin, and of having worn the sword in an\r\narmy which was once the great Frederic's, affect an utter disdain for\r\nthe Austrians. Elated by the rapid extension of their country, which\r\nhas not, however, yet reached its full growth, the Prussians look upon\r\ntheir sandy land as the cradle of a new civilisation. It seems as if\r\nthe waters of the Spree had some miraculous qualities, and that whoever\r\nhas not tasted them, has but four senses instead of five. At St.\r\nPetersburg and Moscow, no one doubts, that the sword of the emperor,\r\nthrown into the scales of the world's destinies, would at once overbear\r\nthe opposite balance. Perhaps we of Western Europe have done our part\r\nin filling the Russians with these high notions of the influence of\r\nthe Czar. Thus in Europe, each nation arrogates to itself the first\r\nrank, and I do not see why the Americans should be more modest than the\r\npeople on the other side of the Atlantic. The miracles which they have\r\naccomplished in fifty years give them a right to be proud, and they,\r\nalso, in their turn, are persuaded that they are the first people in\r\nthe world, and they boast loudly of their preëminence.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, there is no chosen people, on whom superiority is entailed\r\nfor ages. The Jewish nation, in which this notion of predestination\r\nseemed to be most deeply rooted, has for centuries afforded the most\r\nmelancholy refutation of the doctrine. Since the age of Richelieu and\r\nthe Revolution of 1688, that is, since Spain has fallen asleep, France\r\nand England have been at the head of civilisation, and have divided the\r\nsupremacy between themselves; the one ruling by the theoretical, the\r\nother by the practical; the one giving the tone in politics, the other\r\nin taste, the arts, and manners. But what were France and England three\r\ncenturies ago, in the time of Charles V., when the generals of that\r\nemperor and king slew Bayard at Rebecque, made Francis I. prisoner at\r\nPavia, and the Pope in Rome, whilst four thousand miles further west,\r\nCortez was conquering for him the proud empire of Montezuma? Prussia,\r\nwho now divides with Austria the dominion of Germany, and who is worthy\r\nof that dignity, who is the youthful, the aspiring, the ambitious\r\nGermany, full of the future, as Austria is the patriarchal, sober,\r\nprudent, conservative Germany, clinging to the past and the old,--what\r\nwas Prussia three generations ago? What shall we all be, French,\r\nEnglish, Prussians, and Austrians three centuries hence, or perhaps one\r\nhundred years hence? Who can say that some northern blast, finding us\r\ndivided, and enfeebled by our divisions, will not have laid low those\r\nwho are now so high and haughty? Who knows if the vigourous race which\r\nis now bursting forth from this virgin soil, will not then have passed\r\nus in their turn, as we have outstripped our predecessors? Who can\r\nforetell, whether the two gigantic figures that are now rising above\r\nthe horizon, the one in the East with one foot on Moscow and one just\r\nready to fall on Constantinople, the other in the West, as yet half\r\nhidden by the vast forests of the New World, whose huge limbs stretch\r\nfrom the mouths of the St. Lawrence to those of the Mississippi: who\r\ncan foresee, whether these youthful Titans, who are watching each other\r\nacross the Atlantic, and already touch hands on the Pacific, will not\r\nsoon divide the empire of the world?\r\n\r\nCivilisation is a treasure, to which each generation adds something in\r\ntransmitting it to its heirs, and which passes from hand to hand, from\r\npeople to people, from country to country. Setting out from Asia it\r\nwas four thousand years in reaching the borders of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nWo to the nations, that having become depositaries of the treasure,\r\ninstead of keeping it with watchful care and labouring to increase\r\nit, lay it down by the road-side, and waste their time and strength\r\nin foolish quarrels; for they will soon be robbed of their trust! The\r\nAmericans are the most enterprising of men, and the most aspiring of\r\npeople; if we continue to be swallowed up in our barren disputes, they\r\nare the people to snatch from us at unawares the precious charge of\r\nthe destinies of our race, and to place themselves at the head of its\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nEach people has its qualities, which are developed by education, which\r\nat certain moments shine with peculiar brilliancy, like a beacon light\r\ntowards which the eyes of mankind are directed, and by which its march\r\nis guided, and which always command the esteem or love or respect of\r\nothers. The people of the United States most undeniably have theirs.\r\nNo people is so peculiarly fitted by its intrinsic character, as\r\nwell as by the circumstances of the territory and the condition of\r\nthe population, for democratic institutions. The Americans possess,\r\ntherefore, in the highest degree, the better features of democracy,\r\nand they have also its inseparable defects; but if there is something\r\nin them to blame, there is still more to praise. There is much here\r\nfor a European to learn, who should come to seek, not subjects\r\nfor fault-finding, satire, and sarcasm (which have become vulgar\r\ncommon-places, since the small coin of Voltaire and Byron has passed\r\nthrough so many hands), but positive facts, which might be imitated in\r\nour old countries, with the necessary modifications required by the\r\ndifference between our circumstances and the condition of America.\r\nAlmost all English travellers in this country have seen a great deal\r\nthat was bad and scarcely any thing good; the portrait they have drawn\r\nof America and the Americans, is a caricature, which, like all good\r\ncaricatures, has some resemblance to the original. The Americans have a\r\nright to deny the jurisdiction of the tribunal, for they have a right\r\nto be tried by their peers, and it does not belong to the most complete\r\naristocracy in Europe, the English aristocracy, to sit in judgment on a\r\ndemocracy. Yet all the English travellers in America have belonged to\r\nthe aristocracy by their connexions or their opinions, or were aspiring\r\nto it, or aped its habits and judgments, that they might seem to belong\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nA Yorkshire farmer or a Birmingham mechanic would certainly pass a very\r\ndifferent judgment; they would probably be as exclusively disposed to\r\npraise, as the most disdainful tourists have been to blame. And the\r\nfarmers and mechanics count for something in the numbers of the English\r\npopulation and in the elements of the British prosperity. Suppose an\r\nOhio or Illinois farmer, after having sold his flour and salt pork\r\nto advantage, should enact the nabob six months in England, and on\r\nhis return should describe, with the rude eloquence of the West, the\r\ndistress of the British operatives, the corn laws, the poor rates, the\r\nfrightful condition of the Irish peasantry, the impressment of sailors,\r\nthe sale of military offices, and to complete his picture of manners,\r\nshould add a boxing match, a scene of the guests at a dinner rolling\r\ndead-drunk under the table, and of the sale of a wife by her husband in\r\nopen market; if he should give such a picture to his countrymen as a\r\npolitical and moral portrait of England, the English would shrug their\r\nshoulders, and with reason. Yet his story would be founded on facts,\r\nand could not be said to be actually false in any particular. Now such\r\na story would be an exact counterpart of most of the representations of\r\nAmerica by English travellers. Do not to others what you would not have\r\nothers do to you.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing in the United States that strikes a stranger on\r\nstepping ashore, and is of a character to silence his sentiments\r\nof national pride, particularly if he is an Englishman; it is the\r\nappearance of general ease in the condition of the people of this\r\ncountry. While European communities are more or less cankered with the\r\nsore of pauperism, for which their ablest statesmen have as yet been\r\nable to find no healing balm, there are here no paupers, at least not\r\nin the Northern and Western States, which have protected themselves\r\nfrom the leprosy of slavery. If a few individuals are seen, they are\r\nonly an imperceptible minority of dissolute or improvident persons,\r\ncommonly people of colour, or some newly landed emigrants, who have\r\nnot been able to adopt industrious habits. Nothing is more easy than\r\nto live and to live well by labour. Objects of the first necessity,\r\nbread, meat, sugar, tea, coffee, fuel, are in general cheaper here than\r\nin France, and wages are double or triple. I happened, a few days ago,\r\nto be on the line of a railroad in process of construction, where they\r\nwere throwing up some embankments. This sort of labour, which merely\r\nrequires force, without skill, is commonly done in the United States\r\nby Irish new-comers, who have no resource but their arm, no quality\r\nbut muscular strength. These Irish labourers are fed and lodged, and\r\nhear their bill of fare; three meals a day, and at each meal plenty\r\nof meat and wheat bread; coffee and sugar at two meals, and butter[R]\r\nonce a day; in the course of the day, from six to eight glasses of\r\nwhiskey are given them according to the state of the weather. Beside\r\nwhich they receive in money 40 cents a day under the most unfavourable\r\ncircumstances, often from 60 to 75 cents. In France the same labour is\r\nworth about 24 cents a day the labourers finding themselves.\r\n\r\nThis positive and undeniable fact of the general ease, is connected\r\nwith another, which gives it a singular importance in the eyes of a\r\nEuropean, who is the friend of progressive reforms, and the enemy\r\nof violence; the prevalence of radicalism in politics. The term\r\n_democrat_, which elsewhere would fill even the republicans with\r\nterror, is here greeted with acclamations, and the name of _Democratic_\r\nis zealously claimed by every party as its exclusive property. But this\r\nis the only kind of property which is called in question; it is true\r\nthat material property rapidly disappears in this country, unless it is\r\npreserved by the most constant vigilance, and renewed with untiring\r\nindustry. But as long as it exists, it is the object of profound\r\nrespect, which, I must confess, has rather surprised me. I should have\r\nexpected that the social theory would have borrowed some notions from\r\nthe predominant political theory; but there are those in Europe, who\r\nare not there considered the boldest speculators on this subject, who\r\nhere would be looked upon as the most audacious innovators. From this\r\nsimple statement, it seems natural to infer, that valuable lessons are\r\nto be learned here by those who seek to solve the great question that\r\nnow agitates Europe, the amelioration of the greatest number. It would\r\nbe interesting to inquire into the causes of this state of things,\r\nand to examine whether, with certain modifications, it could not be\r\ntransferred to Europe, and particularly to France.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Q] _Austriæ est imperare orbi universo_; the empire of the world\r\nbelongs to Austria.\r\n\r\n[R] Butter is dearer in the United States than in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE YANKEE AND THE VIRGINIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      CHARLESTON, MAY 28, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe great flood of civilisation, which has poured over the vast\r\nregions of the West, in the south and the north, from the great lakes\r\nto the Cape of Florida, has flowed on with a wonderful power and an\r\nadmirable regularity. Emigration has taken place, along the whole\r\nline of march, from east to west. The inhabitants of New England,[S]\r\nafter having first spread themselves over their original territory,\r\nand founded the States of Maine and Vermont, have thrown themselves\r\ninto the State of New York; thence, keeping as much as possible along\r\nthe northern frontier of the United States, they have extended all\r\nalong the coasts of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and overrun the vast\r\ndelta comprised between the Ohio and the Upper Mississippi, which\r\nnow contains the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and the\r\nTerritory of Michigan. The New York and Pennsylvania emigrants have\r\nspread themselves comparatively little beyond the limits of their own\r\nterritory, which are very extensive, and were thinly peopled in 1783.\r\nThey have, however, furnished a small contingent to the great army of\r\nemigration from New England, and have helped to occupy the vast tract\r\nabove-mentioned. Virginia, after having settled her western part with\r\nher own sons, has given birth to Kentucky, and then, acting the same\r\npart in the south as New England in the north, has sent forth to the\r\nGulf of Mexico those numerous swarms that have invaded the southwest.\r\nNorth Carolina has taken part in this task, and has beside a child of\r\nher own in Tennessee. Georgia and South Carolina have contributed to\r\ncreate Alabama and Mississippi, and Tennessee and Kentucky have in turn\r\nfurnished offsets for Missouri and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThus the States in which there are no slaves, have brought forth\r\na family of truly democratic republics, that is to say, with an\r\nessentially farming population, holding no slaves, and, excepting the\r\nvine, cultivating all the productions of temperate Europe. These young\r\nStates are founded on equality and the subdivision of property, for\r\nmost of the farms do not exceed 80 to 160 acres. The Southern States,\r\non the other hand, have created aristocratical republics, based on\r\nslavery and the accumulation of property in a few hands, still more\r\nexclusively agricultural than the north-western States, and chiefly\r\noccupied in cultivating cotton, a precious commodity, which now\r\nfurnishes for exportation, inclusive of what is consumed in the North,\r\nan annual value of 40 or 50 million dollars.[T] Thus amongst all the\r\ncolumns of emigration, two particularly attract attention, and form of\r\nthemselves the main body of the army, the others are only auxiliaries;\r\nthese two great masses are the New England and the Virginia columns.\r\n\r\nThat part of Virginia which was most peopled during the war of\r\nIndependence has a low and nearly level surface, and a sandy, and in\r\ngeneral, very poor soil. Along the rivers there are tracts formerly\r\nproductive, but even these have been exhausted by the cultivation of\r\ntobacco. The proprietors of these estates must have been early led to\r\nthink of quitting their plantations for the fertile lands of Kentucky,\r\nthen occupied, or rather overrun, by warlike savages, of whom they were\r\nthe favourite hunting-ground. Some bold and hardy pioneers, at the\r\nhead of whom was Boon, first ventured across the mountains with their\r\nrifles, and bravely sustained a bloody contest with the Indians. After\r\nmany desperate fights, in which more than one unknown hero fell under\r\nthe bullet or the tomahawk of some red-skinned Hector, after numerous\r\nassaults, in which more than one matron enacted the part of our Jeanne\r\nHachette,[U] after many alarms and much suffering, the genius of\r\ncivilisation carried it. At the call of the pioneers, roused by the\r\nfame of their exploits, the planters of the coast set out on their\r\npilgrimage; arriving with their slaves, they cleared and cultivated\r\nlarge tracts, in the midst of which they led a patriarchal life,\r\nsurrounded by their servants and flocks, following with ardour the\r\nchase of wild beasts, and sometimes of Indians, and too often spending\r\nthe proceeds of their crop in betting on the speed of their horses, of\r\nwhich they are very proud, and whose pedigree is better known to them\r\nthan their own. More lately, when the demand for cotton had increased,\r\nin consequence of the improvements in machinery, and the steamboat had\r\nopened the way into the heart of the Mississippi Valley, they have\r\nremoved southwards, always taking their slaves with them; a prospect of\r\nfuture wealth and prosperity was thus opened for the south.\r\n\r\nThe industrious sons of New England likewise bade farewell to the\r\nrocky and ungrateful soil of their birthplace; loading a wagon with a\r\nplough, a bed, a barrel of salt meat, the indispensable supply of tea\r\nand molasses, a Bible and a wife, and with his axe on his shoulder, the\r\nYankee sets out for the West, without a servant, without an assistant,\r\noften without a companion, to build himself a log hut, six hundred\r\nmiles from his father's roof, and clear away a spot for a farm in the\r\nmidst of the boundless forest. The first of these wanderers went from\r\nConnecticut, _the land of steady habits_, of Puritans among Puritans.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian and the Yankee have planted themselves in the wilderness,\r\neach in a manner conformable to his nature and condition. The part they\r\nhave taken in founding the new States of the West, explains the fact so\r\noften mentioned of fifty or sixty members of Congress being natives of\r\nVirginia or Connecticut. In this conquest over nature, Europe has not\r\nremained an idle spectator; she has sent forth vigourous labourers, who\r\nhave co-operated with the sons of New England, for slavery drives them\r\nfrom the men of the South. Many Irish and Scotch, a number of Germans,\r\nSwiss, and some French, are now settled in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nand Illinois. The traveller who descends the Ohio, passes on the way\r\nGallipolis, a French settlement, Vevay, a Swiss village, and Marietta,\r\nso called in honour of Marie Antoinette.[V] The terminations in _burg_\r\nare scattered amongst Indian names, Jacksonvilles, Washingtons, and\r\nColumbias. But the co-operation of Europeans does not deprive the\r\nYankees of the principal share in the honour of the work; they began\r\nit, they have borne and still bear the burden and heat of the day. In\r\ncomparison with them, the European has been only the eleventh-hour-man,\r\nthe apprentice, the hireling. The fusion of the European with the\r\nYankee takes place but slowly, even on the new soil of the West; for\r\nthe Yankee is not a man of promiscuous society; he believes that Adam's\r\noldest son was a Yankee. Enough, however, of foreign blood has been\r\nmingled with the Yankee blood to modify the primitive character of the\r\nNew England race, and to form a third American type, that of the West,\r\nwhose features are not yet sharply defined, but are daily assuming more\r\ndistinctness; this type is characterised by its athletic forms and\r\nambitious pretensions, and seems destined ultimately to become superior\r\nto the others.\r\n\r\nThe Yankee and the Virginian are very unlike each other; they have\r\nno great love for each other, and are often at variance. They are\r\nthe same men who cut each other's throats in England, under the name\r\nof Roundheads and Cavaliers. In England, they patched up a peace by\r\nthe interposition of a third dynasty, which was neither Stuart nor\r\nCromwell. In America, where there was no power to mediate between\r\nthem, they would have devoured each other as they did in England, had\r\nnot Providence thrown them wide apart, one party at the south, the\r\nother at the north, leaving between them the territory now occupied by\r\nthe _justes-milieux_ States of New York and Pennsylvania, with their\r\nsatellites, New Jersey and Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian of pure race is frank, hearty, open, cordial in his\r\nmanners, noble in his sentiments, elevated in his notions, he is a\r\nworthy descendant of the English gentleman. Surrounded, from infancy,\r\nby his slaves, who relieve him from all personal exertion, he is rather\r\nindisposed to activity, and is even indolent. He is generous and\r\nprofuse; around him, but rather in the new States than in impoverished\r\nVirginia, abundance reigns. When the cotton crop has been good and the\r\nprice is high, he invites everybody, excepting only the slaves that\r\ncultivate his fields, to partake in his wealth, without much thought\r\nof next year's produce. To him, the practice of hospitality is at once\r\na duty, a pleasure, and a happiness. Like the Eastern patriarchs or\r\nHomer's heroes, he spits an ox to regale the guest whom Providence\r\nsends him and an old friend recommends to his attention, and to moisten\r\nthis solid repast, he offers Madeira, of which he is as proud as of his\r\nhorses, which has been twice to the East Indies, and has been ripening\r\nfull twenty years. He loves the institutions of his country, yet he\r\nshows with pride his family plate, the arms on which, half effaced by\r\ntime, attest his descent from the first colonists, and prove that his\r\nancestors were of a good family in England. When his mind has been\r\ncultivated by study, and a tour in Europe has polished his manners and\r\nrefined his imagination, there is no place in the world in which he\r\nwould not appear to advantage, no destiny too high for him to reach;\r\nhe is one of those, whom a man is glad to have as a companion, and\r\ndesires as a friend. Ardent and warm-hearted, he is of the block from\r\nwhich great orators are made. He is better able to command men, than to\r\nconquer nature and subdue the soil. When he has a certain degree of the\r\nspirit of method, and, I will not say of will, (for he has enough of\r\nthat), but of that active perseverance so common among his brethren of\r\nthe North, he has all the qualities needful to form a great statesman.\r\n\r\nThe Yankee, on the contrary, is reserved, cautious, distrustful; he is\r\nthoughtful and pensive, but equable; his manners are without grace,\r\nmodest but dignified, cold, and often unprepossessing; he is narrow\r\nin his ideas, but practical, and possessing the idea of the proper,\r\nhe never rises to the grand. He has nothing chivalric about him, and\r\nyet he is adventurous, and he loves a roving life. His imagination is\r\nactive and original, producing, however, not poetry, but drollery.\r\nThe Yankee is the laborious ant; he is industrious and sober, frugal,\r\nand, on the sterile soil of New England, niggardly; transplanted to\r\nthe promised land in the West, he continues moderate in his habits,\r\nbut less inclined to count the cents. In New England he has a large\r\nshare of prudence, but once thrown into the midst of the treasures of\r\nthe West, he becomes a speculator, a gambler even, although he has\r\na great horror of cards, dice, and all games of hazard and even of\r\nskill, except the innocent game at bowls. He is crafty, sly, always\r\ncalculating, boasting even of the tricks which he plays upon the\r\ncareless or trusting buyer, because he looks upon them as marks of his\r\nsuperior sagacity, and well provided with mental reservations to lull\r\nhis conscience. With all his nice subtleties, he is, nevertheless,\r\nexpeditious in business, because he knows the value of time. His house\r\nis a sanctuary, which he does not open to the profane; he is little\r\ngiven to hospitality, or rather he displays it only on rare occasions,\r\nand then he does so on a great scale. He is a ready speaker, and a\r\nclose reasoner, but not a brilliant orator. For a statesman, he wants\r\nthat greatness of mind and soul which enables a man to enter into\r\nand love another's nature, and leads him naturally to consult his\r\nneighbour's good, in consulting his own. He is individualism incarnate;\r\nin him the spirit of locality and division is carried to the utmost.[W]\r\nBut if he is not a great statesman, he is an able administrator, an\r\nunrivalled man of business. If he is not suited to command men, he has\r\nno equal in acting upon things, in combining, arranging, and giving\r\nthem a value. There are nowhere merchants of more consummate ability\r\nthan those of Boston.\r\n\r\nBut it is particularly as the colonist of the wilderness, that the\r\nYankee is admirable; fatigue has no hold on him. He has not, like the\r\nSpaniard, the capacity to bear hunger and thirst, but he has the much\r\nsuperior faculty of finding, at all times and in all places, something\r\nto eat and to drink, and of being always able to contrive a shelter\r\nfrom the cold, first for his wife and children, and afterward for\r\nhimself. He grapples with nature in close fight, and more unyielding\r\nthan she, subdues her at last, obliging her to surrender at discretion,\r\nto yield whatever he wills, and to take the shape he chooses. Like\r\nHercules, he conquers the hydra of the pestilential morass, and chains\r\nthe rivers; more daring than Hercules, he extends his dominion not only\r\nover the land, but over the sea; he is the best sailor in the world,\r\nthe ocean is his tributary, and enriches him with the oil of her whales\r\nand with all her lesser fry. More wise than the hero of the twelve\r\nlabours, he knows no Omphale that is able to seduce, no Dejanira,\r\nwhose poisoned gifts can balk his searching glance. In this respect\r\nhe is rather a Ulysses, who has his Penelope, counts upon her faith,\r\nand remains steadfastly true to her. He does not even need to stop his\r\nears, when he passes near the Sirens, for in him the tenderest passions\r\nare deadened by religious austerity and devotion to his business. Like\r\nUlysses in another point, he has a bag full of shifts; overtaken at\r\nnight by a storm in the woods, in a half hour, with no other resource\r\nthan his knife, he will have made a shelter for himself and his horse.\r\nIn winter, caught in one of those snow-storms, which are unknown among\r\nus, he will construct a sled in the twinkling of an eye, and keep on\r\nhis way, like an Indian, by watching the bark of the trees. Thus to\r\nthe genius of business, by means of which he turns to profit whatever\r\nthe earth yields him, he joins the genius of industry, which makes her\r\nprolific, and that of mechanical skill, which fashions her produce to\r\nhis wants. He is incomparable as a pioneer, unequalled as a settler of\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe Yankee has set his mark on the United States during the last\r\nhalf century. He has been eclipsed by Virginia in the counsels of\r\nthe nation;[X] but he has in turn had the upper hand throughout the\r\ncountry, and eclipsed her on her own soil; for in order to arouse\r\nthe Virginian from his southern indolence, it has been necessary\r\nthat the Yankee should come to set him an example of activity and\r\nenterprise at his own door. But for the Yankee, the vast cotton\r\nplantations of the South would still be an uncultivated waste. It\r\nwas a Yankee, Ely Whitney, who, toward the end of the last century,\r\ninvented the cotton-gin, which has made the fortune of the South. To\r\ngive a speculation success in the South, some Yankee must have come a\r\nthousand miles to suggest the idea to the natives, and carry off the\r\nprofit before their eyes. New England has given only two Presidents to\r\nthe Union, both popular on the eve of their election, both unpopular\r\non the morrow, both rejected at the end of their first term, while\r\nall the others have been natives of Virginia or South Carolina, and\r\nhave been rechosen for a second term. But then what a revenge has she\r\ntaken in business matters, at the North and the South, in the East as\r\nwell as the West! Here the Yankee is a true Marquis of Carabas. At\r\nBaltimore as well as at Boston, in New Orleans as well as at Salem, in\r\nNew York as well as at Portland, if a merchant is mentioned who has\r\nmade and kept a large fortune by sagacity and forecast, you will find\r\nthat he is a Yankee. If you pass a plantation in the South in better\r\norder than the others, with finer avenues, with the negroes' cabins\r\nbetter arranged and more comfortable, you will be told, \"Oh! that is\r\na Yankee's; he is a _smart man_!\" In a village in Missouri, by the\r\nside of a house with broken windows, dirty in its outward appearance,\r\naround the door of which a parcel of ragged children are quarrelling\r\nand fighting, you may see another, freshly painted, surrounded by\r\na simple, but neat and nicely white-washed fence, with a dozen of\r\ncarefully trimmed trees about it, and through the windows in a small\r\nroom shining with cleanliness, you may espy some nicely combed little\r\nboys, and some young girls dressed in almost the last Paris fashion.\r\nBoth houses belong to farmers, but one of them is from North Carolina,\r\nand the other from New England. On the western rivers, you will hear\r\na boat mentioned which never meets with an accident, and in which all\r\ntravellers and merchants are eager to take their passage; the master is\r\na Yankee. Along side of the _levée_ at New Orleans, you may be struck\r\nwith the fine appearance of a ship, which all the passers-by stop to\r\nadmire; the master is also a Yankee.\r\n\r\nThe preëminence of the Yankee in the colonisation of the country, has\r\nmade him the arbiter of manners and customs. It is from him that the\r\ncountry has taken a general hue of austere severity, that is religious\r\nand even bigoted; it is through him that all sorts of amusements, which\r\namong us are considered as innocent relaxations, are here proscribed\r\nas immoral pleasures. It is he that has introduced the Prison Reform,\r\nmultiplied schools, founded Temperance Societies (See _Note_ 13).\r\nIt is through his agency, with his money, that the Missionaries are\r\nendeavouring silently to found colonies in the South Seas, for the\r\nbenefit of the Union. If we wished to form a single type, representing\r\nthe American character of the present moment as a single whole, it\r\nwould be necessary to take at least three-fourths of the Yankee race,\r\nand to mix with it hardly one fourth of the Virginian. The physical\r\nlabour of colonisation is now nearly brought to an end; the physical\r\nbasis of society is laid. On this base it becomes necessary to raise a\r\nsocial structure of yet unknown form, but which, I am fully convinced,\r\nwill be on a new plan, for all the materials are new; and besides,\r\nneither humanity nor Providence ever repeats itself. Which of the two\r\nraces is best suited to execute this new task? I cannot tell; but it\r\nseems to me that the Virginian is now about to take his turn, and that\r\nin the phase which the United States are now on the point of entering,\r\nthe social qualities of the Virginian will obtain the superiority, that\r\nnaturally belonged to the laborious Yankee in the period of settling\r\nthe forest. In a word, I believe, that, if the Union lasts, and the\r\nWest continues to form a united mass from the falls of Niagara to New\r\nOrleans, this third type of the west, which is now forming and already\r\naspires to rule over the others, will take a great deal from the\r\nVirginian and very little from the Yankee.\r\n\r\nIt is no small advantage to a people to combine within itself two\r\ntypes with different characteristics, when they unite harmoniously\r\nin composing a common national character. A people of which all the\r\nindividual members are referrible to a single type, is among nations\r\nwhat an unmarried man is among individuals; it is a sort of hermit, its\r\nlife is monotonous; the strongest and sweetest feelings of human nature\r\nare dormant in it; it continues stationary; there is nothing to spur\r\nit forward. Such was ancient Egypt. A people consisting of two types,\r\non the contrary, when neither has an oppressive superiority over the\r\nother, enjoys a complete existence; its life is a perpetual interchange\r\nof ideas and sensations, like that of a married pair. It has the\r\npower of reproducing and regenerating itself. Each of the two natures\r\nalternately acts and reposes itself, without ever being inactive. By\r\nturns each gains the superiority and yields to the other; and thus\r\naccording to circumstances, different qualities come into play. The two\r\nnatures mutually support and relieve each other, they stimulate each\r\nother, and through this wholesome rivalry, the nation that combines\r\nthem in itself, reaches high destinies.\r\n\r\nHistory shows that the progress of humanity has been constantly\r\npromoted by the reciprocal action and reaction of two natures, or two\r\nraces, sometimes friends, oftener enemies or rivals. The most general\r\nfact in the history of our civilisation is the struggle between the\r\nEast and the West, from the expedition of the Argonauts and the war of\r\nTroy, to the battle of Lepanto and the siege of Vienna by the Turks.\r\nIn this great drama, it was not merely to shed rivers of blood, that\r\nProvidence has dashed against each other Europeans and Asiatics, Greeks\r\nand Persians, Romans, Carthaginians, and Parthians, Saracens and\r\nFranks, Venitians, Turks, and Poles; blows have not been the only thing\r\nexchanged between Europe and the Orient. If you wish to know what the\r\nWest has gained from contact with the East, even when they met sword in\r\nhand, look around you; most of the fruit trees that enrich your fields,\r\nthe vine which gladdens the heart, the silk and cotton that adorn your\r\nhouses and your persons, these are the spoils of your Eastern wars;\r\nsugar and coffee, the cultivation of which has changed the political\r\nbalance of the world, were brought into Europe from the East, the\r\none by yourselves, the other by the Arabs, when they made themselves\r\nmasters of Spain. The mariner's compass, which has given a new\r\ncontinent to civilisation, and established the dominion of man over the\r\nbefore unconquered deep, was the gift of the East. Your arts and your\r\nsciences are of Oriental origin; the secrets of Algebra were stolen\r\nfrom the Moors of Spain by a monk; your system of numeration, the basis\r\nof all your financial improvements, bears the name of the Arabs; your\r\nchivalry was brought from Asia by the Crusaders. Christianity, the\r\nmother of modern Europe, would not have existed in the West, had not\r\nthe Roman legions conquered Judea which contained its germ, had not\r\nthe Roman empire contained the school of Alexandria in which that germ\r\ncould put forth, and had not the Rome of the Cæsars been raised as a\r\npedestal for the successors of St. Peter, from which they might rule\r\nover the East and the West.\r\n\r\nBehold the Roman people; its noble career was a continual succession of\r\nwars, followed by as many incorporations of the conquered, alliances,\r\nreal marriages, which; always give it a new vigour. It begins with\r\nthe double figure of Romulus and Remus; then follow the Romans and\r\nSabines, then Rome and Alba, next Rome and the Latins, and next Rome\r\nand Carthage. It might be called a young sultan, who carries off a\r\ncaptive at the point of the sword, and makes her his favourite until he\r\ngrows tired of her, or until he finds another more worthy of his love.\r\nIt goes on in this way, changing, and daily rising in the successive\r\nsubjects of its choice, until it meets with Greece, which becomes not\r\nan object of a passing caprice, but a favorite sultana. This Union\r\nof the Greek and Roman natures gave its splendour to imperial Rome,\r\nand rest to the world. Its destiny once entwined with that of Greece,\r\nthe Roman people paused to enjoy; and with this purpose, substituted\r\nthe rule of the Cæsars for the republican constitution, and Greek\r\nrhetoricians and players, and emperors, voluptuous like the disciples\r\nof Epicurus, or philosophers, like Pericles, for the stern and severe\r\naristocracy of earlier days. What is the history of Greece, but a\r\ncontinual oscillation between the austere Lacedæmon and the brilliant\r\nAthens, between the country of Lycurgus and Leonidas, and that of\r\nSolon, Aspasia, and Alcibiades. United, they acquired an indomitable\r\nenergy, and supported the shock of all Asia. Unfortunately they had too\r\nlittle feeling of a common nationality, and too much of local jealousy;\r\nalmost perpetually divided, they never completely extended their sway\r\nover Greece itself, and when the Greek race was about to reach its\r\nzenith, neither was destined to lead it thither, but Providence raised\r\nup a man in the North, before whom _the earth was silent_.\r\n\r\nWhilst a nation comprises an indefinite number of types mixed together\r\nwithout order and without rank, it resembles a body not yet in a state\r\nof consistency; it has no definable character, no fixed destination;\r\nit is incapable of achieving any thing great. Thus from the time of\r\nthe war of the old German electors against the Holy Empire, and of the\r\ntreaty of Westphalia, which sanctioned their independence and broke\r\nin pieces the former unity of the nation, Germany continued under an\r\neclipse, until the period of the rise of the house of Brandenburg from\r\nthe midst of the anarchy of the little German States, when a rival was\r\ngiven to the house of Austria and a strong dualism established. Dualism\r\nis not, however, the only mode in which a society can be constituted,\r\nat once solid and elastic. When a third type, whose superiority is\r\nadmitted by the others, or which partakes sufficiently of the nature of\r\neach to serve as a bond and a mediator between them, exists, the social\r\norganisation is then in a high degree vigourous; for then, the harmony\r\nbetween the two primitive types has ceased to be an abstraction, it has\r\nbecome a substance. In some cases this third personage of the drama\r\nbecomes so indispensable to the action, that it must be supplied at any\r\nrate, and its great prerogatives devolve on a transient actor; thus\r\nin Greece, Thebes played this part during a short period. Sometimes\r\nit has been filled by an aristocracy, which has served as a check to\r\nboth parties in turn; an aristocracy worthy of the name is eminently\r\nqualified for this task, because it combines the two natures in itself,\r\nfeels the reaction of their passions influencing itself, and has the\r\nenergy necessary either to curb or spur them on, as the exigency\r\nof the case requires. There is no country in which dualism is more\r\nadmirably developed than in the United States; each of the two natures\r\nhas an open field, each a distinct career of industry; each possesses\r\nin the highest degree the qualities necessary for its peculiar\r\nposition. Considered in respect to a triple type, the United States are\r\nnot less favorably situated; the young giant that is growing up in the\r\nWest, seems destined to fulfil the prophecy _the last shall be first_,\r\nand bind together the North and the South in his vigourous gripe.\r\n\r\nIn France we have two distinct types, that of the North and that of\r\nthe South; but instead of employing the principle of centralisation as\r\na means of developing the nature of both, and giving them a free and\r\nharmonious action, we have endeavoured to confound them in a narrow\r\nand sterile unity. We have especially thwarted the most reasonable\r\nand legitimate wishes of the South, which has been overborne and\r\ncrushed by the North. It takes its revenge, indeed, in furnishing us\r\nwith most of our statesmen, very much as Ireland has the privilege of\r\ngiving _premiers_ to England; but like Irish ministers in England,\r\nour Southern statesmen, ungrateful sons of a neglected mother, govern\r\nwholly in the interest of the North, as if France contained towns only,\r\nand had no rural population, as if we were chiefly a manufacturing, and\r\nbut partially an agricultural people, and, what is worse, as if we were\r\na school of philosophers, and not a nation longing for religious faith\r\nand political love.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[S] The name of Yankee was first applied in derision, but the New\r\nEnglanders, thinking that they have ennobled it, have adopted it.\r\n\r\n[T] Exports of cotton from the United States.

Of seven presidents four have been from Virginia. Many of the\r\nmembers of Congress are natives of New England, and particularly of\r\nConnecticut, but they are generally laborious, second-rate men, rather\r\nthan men of influence and superior abilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.\r\n\r\nLOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         LOWELL, JUNE 12, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe municipal elections which took place in New York two months ago,\r\nand the legislative elections in Virginia, which occupied the whole\r\nmonth of April, have revealed to the Opposition its whole strength.\r\nTheir success was unexpected, particularly in New York; I say success,\r\nalthough the newly elected mayor belongs to the administration party,\r\nbecause the Opposition has the majority in both houses of the common\r\ncouncil, the board of aldermen, and the board of assistants, who\r\ngovern in reality. Since that time, the Opposition has continued to\r\ngain ground. There are some able statesmen in the Senate, who are\r\nalso skilful parliamentary tacticians; they knew that by irritating\r\nthe President they might force him to commit some act of imprudence,\r\nand this motive was not without its weight in the adoption by the\r\nSenate of resolutions censuring his conduct in regard to the Bank.\r\nThe old General felt this censure very sensibly, and replied to it\r\nby a protest, which his best friends consider a mistake, and which\r\nthe Senate refused to have entered on its journal. It is a matter of\r\nsurprise that Mr Van Buren, whose sagacity all admit, did not interpose\r\nhis influence to prevent the sending of this message. One of the\r\nfundamental maxims of American politics is, that the sword and purse\r\nshould not be united in the same hands; that is, that the President,\r\nto whom the constitution has entrusted the military force of the\r\nRepublic, should not also be the keeper of the public money. This is\r\nhere a universally received, undisputed maxim; and the President's\r\nprotest clashes with this doctrine. It became necessary, therefore, to\r\nfollow up the protest by an explanatory message, which the Opposition\r\ncalls a recantation, and which in truth is one. This retractation\r\nor explanation has not, however, destroyed the effect of the first\r\nmessage, and the consequence has been a hesitation in the democratic\r\nranks. The Virginia elections, which were then going on, show that they\r\nwere influenced by it, and some other elections of less importance have\r\nturned out unfavorably to the Administration.\r\n\r\nIn Albany, the head-quarters of Mr Van Buren's friends, the\r\nOpposition has carried the municipal elections. The partisans of\r\nthe Administration have, as if in sport, added fault to fault. A\r\ncommittee of the House of Representatives, appointed to examine into\r\nthe doings of the Bank, of which the majority were Jackson men, as the\r\nadministration has the upper hand in that body, committed a series of\r\nblunders: there was a paper war between the committee and the directors\r\nof the Bank, in which the former were completely unhorsed, and had\r\nno better resource than the brutal idea of ordering the President\r\nand directors to be taken into custody by the sergeant-at-arms. Such\r\na proposition was revolting to every body; the majority lately so\r\ncompact, already exhibits symptoms of disaffection, and several recent\r\nvotes show that the Opposition is gaining ground. One might say that\r\nthe prudent, those, to use the words of the great master of diplomacy,\r\n_whose watches go faster than those of their neighbours_, are getting\r\nready to desert. Out of the legislative houses, the Opposition is\r\norganising energetically for the general elections, which are to take\r\nplace next autumn; it is making preparations in the spirit with which\r\nthey are made, when one feels sure of victory, and is determined that\r\nit shall be a decisive one. In New York, for example, the common\r\ncouncil have removed all the Jackson men from municipal offices; all\r\nhave made way for the opponents of the Administration. The mayor will\r\nhave an Anti-Jackson secretary, because that officer is chosen by the\r\ncommon council. These removals are harsh measures, but the friends\r\nof the Administration have no right to complain, for they have set\r\nthe example on a larger scale, by removing hundreds of custom-house\r\nofficers and postmasters. Without pretending to justify these violent\r\nacts, it should be considered that something more is involved than\r\nmerely the removing of an adversary to make way for a friend. The\r\nOpposition wish that the inspectors of streets should be Anti-Jackson\r\nmen, because the scavengers, who are in their employ, have a vote; just\r\nas the Administration insists upon all the postmasters being Jackson\r\nmen, because in the country they have a certain influence.\r\n\r\nIt is less than a year since General Jackson visited the great towns\r\nof the North. He was received with acclamations such as neither\r\nAmerica had ever before witnessed. Washington never excited half\r\nthe enthusiasm; neither Bolivar, Pizarro, nor the great Cortez was\r\never saluted with such pompous epithets. It was an apotheosis. It\r\nis not yet a year since, and already abuse has succeeded to the\r\nmost extravagant praise. A few days ago, I was grieved to read some\r\nunbecoming pleasantries upon the old General's scars. What will be held\r\nsacred, if honourable wounds, all received in front, fighting for one's\r\ncountry, are to become a subject of low jests? The war of the President\r\non the Bank was certainly unjust and disastrous to the country; the\r\nmeasures taken in his name against that institution, were impolitic and\r\nunauthorised by law; the violent passion and imperious temper displayed\r\nby him in the affair, make a strange figure in the seat, that had been\r\noccupied by sages like Washington and his successors. All this is\r\ntrue; but when we look back on fifty years of public services, we are\r\nfilled with grief and indignation to think, that at the end of so long\r\na career, outrage and ingratitude will be, perhaps, his only reward.\r\nCan he have been raised so high, only that his fall should be greater?\r\nIs he destined to furnish another proof of the instability of popular\r\nfavour in every age and all countries? But instead of dwelling on these\r\nunpleasant reflections, I will rather describe the scene now exhibited\r\nliterally under my windows.\r\n\r\nThe town of Lowell dates its origin eleven years ago, and it now\r\ncontains 15,000 inhabitants, inclusive of the suburb of Belvedere.\r\nTwelve years ago it was a barren waste, in which the silence was\r\ninterrupted only by the murmur of the little river of Concord, and the\r\nnoisy dashings of the clear waters of the Merrimac, against the granite\r\nblocks that suddenly obstruct their course. At present, it is a pile of\r\nhuge factories, each five, six, or seven stories high, and capped with\r\na little white belfry, which strongly contrasts with the red masonry\r\nof the building, and is distinctly projected on the dark hills in the\r\nhorizon. By the side of these larger structures rise numerous little\r\nwooden houses, painted white, with green blinds, very neat, very snug,\r\nvery nicely carpeted, and with a few small trees around them, or brick\r\nhouses in the English style, that is to say, simple, but tasteful\r\nwithout and comfortable within; on one side, fancy-goods shops and\r\nmilliners' rooms without number, for the women[Y] are the majority in\r\nLowell, and vast hotels in the American style, very much like barracks\r\n(the only barracks in Lowell); on another, canals, water-wheels,\r\nwaterfalls, bridges, banks, schools, and libraries, for in Lowell\r\nreading is the only recreation,[Z] and there are no less than seven\r\njournals printed here. All around are churches and meeting-houses\r\nof every sect, Episcopalian, Baptist, Congregationalist, Methodist,\r\nUniversalist, Unitarian, &c., and there is also a Roman Catholic\r\nchapel. Here are all the edifices of a flourishing town in the Old\r\nWorld, except the prisons, hospitals, and theatres; everywhere is heard\r\nthe noise of hammers, of spindles, of bells calling the hands to their\r\nwork, or dismissing them from their tasks, of coaches and six arriving\r\nor starting off, of the blowing of rocks to make a mill-race or to\r\nlevel a road; it is the peaceful hum of an industrious population,\r\nwhose movements are regulated like clockwork; a population not native\r\nto the town, and one half of which at least will die elsewhere,\r\nafter having aided in founding three or four other towns; for the\r\nfull-blooded American has this in common with the Tartar, that he is\r\n_encamped_, not established, on the soil he treads upon.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts and the adjoining small States of New England contain\r\nseveral manufacturing towns similar to Lowell, but none of them on\r\nso large a scale. An American, well acquainted with the character of\r\nhis countrymen, gave me the following account of the origin of these\r\ntowns, and of Lowell in particular. \"In 1812,\" said he, \"the United\r\nStates declared war against Great Britain to defend the honour of their\r\ninsulted flag. Boston and the rest of New England opposed the war,\r\nand thus drew upon themselves the reproaches of their brethren of the\r\nMiddle and Southern States. The fact, is, they were quite as sensitive\r\nas the rest of their countrymen to any insult offered their flag by the\r\nmistress of the ocean; the patriotism of the New Englanders is above\r\nsuspicion; they began the war of Independence, and they supported the\r\nprincipal burden of that war. They were, likewise, resolved to have\r\nsatisfaction for the outrages committed by England, for it was they\r\nwho had the greater number of seamen impressed by the English;[AA] but\r\nthey did not wish to have recourse to the cannon's mouth. A commercial\r\npeople, they had much to lose and nothing to gain by a maritime war;\r\na clear-sighted race, they saw that the chance of war was on the side\r\nthat could muster the largest armies and the most numerous navy; in\r\na word, war appeared to them to be a barbarous, old-fashioned means,\r\nunworthy of their inventive wit. The Yankees never do anything like\r\nother people, but they always have some contrivance in store, that\r\nnobody else would have ever thought of. After a careful examination,\r\nthe Yankee said to himself, the best mode of warfare against the\r\nEnglish will be to attack the sources of their wealth; now what is the\r\nprincipal source of the wealth of Great Britain? Its manufactures.\r\nAmong its manufactures which are the most productive? Why the cotton.\r\nWell then, we will set up spinning works and manufactories of cottons;\r\nthis will be our war on Great Britain. Ten or twelve years were passed\r\nin making experiments, in preliminary preparations and attempts to form\r\na class of operatives, and to make machinery. In 1823, the Merrimack\r\ncorporation began operations at Lowell, where the River Merrimack has a\r\nfall of 32 feet, creating a vast motive power, and has been followed by\r\nthe Hamilton, Appleton, Lowell, Suffolk, Tremont, Lawrence, and other\r\ncompanies in succession.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Lowell. Its name is derived from that of a Boston merchant, who\r\nwas one of the first promoters of the cotton-manufacture in the United\r\nStates. It is not like one of our European towns that was built by some\r\ndemi-god, a son of Jupiter, or by some hero of the Trojan war or by the\r\ngenius of an Alexander or a Cæsar, or by some saint, attracting crowds\r\nby his miracles, or by the whim of some great sovereign, like Louis\r\nXIV. or Frederic, or by an edict of Peter the Great. It was neither a\r\npious foundation, nor an asylum for fugitives, nor a military post;\r\nbut it is one of the speculations of the merchants of Boston. The same\r\nspirit of enterprise, which a year ago suggested the idea of sending\r\na cargo of ice from Boston to Calcutta round Cape Horn, to cool the\r\ndrink of Lord William Bentinck and the nabobs of the India company,\r\nhas led them to build up a town here, wholly at their own expense,\r\nwith all the buildings required by the wants of a civilised community,\r\nin order to be able to manufacture white cottons and calicoes; and\r\nthey have succeeded, as they always succeed in their speculations. The\r\nsemi-annual dividends of the manufacturing companies in Lowell, are\r\ngenerally from 5 to 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe cotton manufacture in America, which dates only from the last\r\nwar with England, is rapidly extending, although the modifications\r\nof the tariff, required by the attitude of South Carolina last year,\r\nhave somewhat tended to check the manufacturing spirit. Boston seems\r\ndestined, like Liverpool, to have its Lancashire behind it. As\r\nwater-courses abound in New England, according to the nature of all\r\nprimary regions, steam-engines may be dispensed with for a long time to\r\ncome. This part of the country is very unproductive, and it required\r\nall the perseverance and obstinacy, even, of the Puritans to introduce\r\ninto it the comforts of life. It is rugged, rocky, mountainous, and\r\nbleak, consisting in fact of the first ridges of the Alleghanies,\r\nwhich extend hence to the Gulf of Mexico, continually receding from\r\nthe Atlantic as they stretch southwards. The inhabitants have an\r\nextraordinary mechanical genius, they are patient, attentive, and\r\ninventive, and they must succeed in manufactures; or rather they have\r\nalready succeeded, and Lowell is a miniature Manchester. About 30,000\r\nbales of cotton, or one sixth of the whole domestic consumption (see\r\n_Note 14_), are consumed in Lowell, besides which there are several\r\nmanufactories of broadcloths, cassimeres, and carpets. To strengthen\r\nthe resemblance between their city and Liverpool, the Boston merchants\r\ndetermined to construct a railroad from Boston to Lowell, the length of\r\nwhich is 26 miles; there was already a canal, as there is one between\r\nLiverpool and Manchester, but this has been found insufficient, as it\r\nwas at Liverpool and Manchester. They would not permit this road to be\r\nconstructed in the usual hasty and provisional manner of the American\r\nworks, but they determined to have something Roman, and their engineers\r\nhave given it to them, and have certainly made the most solid railroad\r\nin the world. They have only left out the beautiful masonry, the arches\r\nof hewn stone, the columns, and all the monumental architecture, which\r\nmakes the Liverpool and Manchester railroad one of the wonders of\r\nmodern times; these magnificent ornaments yield no dividends. Yet the\r\nBoston and Lowell railroad in its Roman or Cyclopean simplicity, will\r\ncost 56,000 dollars a mile.\r\n\r\nIn travelling through the neighbourhood of Manchester, one is struck\r\nwith wonder at the sight of the great spinning works; in looking at\r\nthose huge white buildings by moon-light, projecting themselves on\r\nthe dark back ground above the plain, those hundreds of windows from\r\nwhich stream the brilliant rays of gas-lights, those lofty chimneys,\r\nhigher than the highest obelisks, one is tempted to think them palaces,\r\nabodes of pleasure and joy. Alas! the delusive splendours! alas! the\r\nwhited sepulchres! All this fairy illusion vanishes, when one crosses\r\ntheir door-sill, sees the haggard looks and ragged clothes of the crowd\r\nthat fills these vast structures, beholds those poor children whom\r\nParliament vainly strives to protect against their fathers, who are\r\nincessantly begetting new competitors, and against the lash of their\r\noverseers. On arriving at Lowell, the first impression of pleasure\r\ncaused by the sight of the town, new and fresh like an opera scene,\r\nfades away before the melancholy reflection, will this become like\r\nLancashire? Does this brilliant glare hide the misery and suffering of\r\noperatives, and those degrading vices, engendered by poverty in the\r\nmanufacturing towns, drunkenness and prostitution, popular sedition\r\nhanging over the heads of the rich by a frail thread, which an ordinary\r\naccident, and slight imprudence, or a breath of the bad passions, would\r\nsnap asunder? This question I hasten to answer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Y] The female population of Lowell, between the ages of 15 and 25\r\nyears, corresponds to a total population of from 50,000 to 60,000 souls.\r\n\r\n[Z] The rigid spirit of Puritanism has been carried to its utmost in\r\nLowell, owing to the great number of young girls collected together in\r\nthe factories. In 1836, a man was fined by the municipal authorities\r\nfor exercising the trade of _common fiddler_; he was treated as if\r\nhe had outraged the public morals, the magistrates fearing that the\r\npleasures of the dance might tend to corruption of manners.\r\n\r\n[AA] New England comprises but one sixth part of the whole population\r\nof the Union, but she owns one half of the shipping of the country, or\r\n700,000 tons out of a little more than fourteen hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FACTORY GIRLS OF LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         BOSTON, JUNE 22, 1834.\r\n\r\nWar, the last argument of kings and people, war, in which they put\r\nforth their strength with pride, is not, however, the greatest\r\nexhibition of human power. A field of battle may excite terror or a\r\nfeverish enthusiasm, pity or horror; but human strength applied to\r\ncreate is more imposing, than human strength employed in slaughter\r\nand destruction. The pyramids or the colossal temples of Thebes, the\r\nColiseum or Saint Peter's of Rome, reveal a higher grandeur than a\r\nfield of battle covered with desolation and death, were it strown with\r\nthree hundred thousand bodies, as in those two great fights in which\r\nour fathers, under Meroveus and Charles Martel, presented a barrier\r\nto the career of the barbarians, and saved the Western world from the\r\nencroachments of the East. The power of man, like that of God, is\r\nnot less visible in small things than in great. There is nothing in\r\nthe physical order of things of which our race has a better right to\r\nboast, than of the mechanical inventions, by means of which man holds\r\nin check the irregular vigour, or brings forth the hidden energies, of\r\nnature. By the aid of mechanical contrivances, this poor weak creature,\r\nreaching out his hands over the immensity of nature, takes possession\r\nof the rivers, of the winds of heaven, of the tides of the ocean. By\r\nthem, he drags forth from the secret bowels of the earth their hidden\r\nstores of fuel and of metals, and masters the subterranean waters,\r\nwhich there dispute his dominion. By them, he turns each drop of water\r\ninto a reservoir of steam,[AB] that is, into a magazine of power, and\r\nthus he changes the globe, in comparison with which he seems an atom,\r\ninto a laborious, untiring, submissive slave, performing the heaviest\r\ntasks under the eye of its master. Is there any thing which gives a\r\nhigher idea of the power of man, than the steam-engine under the form\r\nin which it is applied to produce motion on railroads? It is more\r\nthan a machine, it is almost a living being; it moves, it runs like\r\na courser at the top of his speed; more than this, it breathes; the\r\nsteam which issues at regular periods from the pipes, and is condensed\r\ninto a white cloud, resembles the quick breathing of a racehorse. A\r\nsteam-engine has a complete respiratory apparatus, which acts like our\r\nown by expansion and compression; it wants only a system of circulation\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while in Virginia, I was looking at a distant locomotive\r\nengine, approaching along the Petersburg and Roanoke railroad, one of\r\nthe fine works of which Mr Robinson, the engineer, yet a young man,\r\nhas executed so many in Virginia and Pennsylvania. The engine came on\r\nat its usual rate of speed, through a narrow clearing cut for the road\r\nin one of the primitive forests, formerly the domain of the great king\r\nPowhatan and his copper-coloured warriors.[AC] The chimney threw out\r\nthousands of sparks from its wide, funnel-shaped top; although yet at a\r\ndistance, the noise of the quick breathing of the pipes was distinctly\r\nheard. In the darkness, in so wild a place, in the bosom of a vast\r\nwilderness and the midst of a profound silence, it was necessary either\r\nto be acquainted with mechanics, or to be imbued with the incredulity\r\nof the age, not to believe this flying, panting, flaming machine, a\r\nwinged dragon vomiting forth fire. A short time since some Brahmins,\r\nthe fathers of ancient science, seeing a steamboat stem the current of\r\nthe sacred Ganges, really believed that it was some strange animal,\r\nrecently discovered by the English in some distant region.\r\n\r\nIn our modern societies the improvements of machinery have given us\r\nmanufactures, which promise to be a source of inexhaustible prosperity\r\nand well-being to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe English manufactories alone yield about eight hundred million yards\r\nof cotton stuffs annually, or about one yard for each inhabitant of\r\nthe globe. If it were required to produce this amount of cloth without\r\nmachinery, by, the fingers alone, it is probable that each of us would\r\nhardly be able to card, spin, and weave his yard a year, so that the\r\nwhole time of the whole human race would be occupied by a task, which,\r\nby the aid of machinery, is accomplished by five hundred thousand\r\narms in Great Britain. From this fact we may conclude, that when the\r\nmanufacturing system shall be well regulated and completely organised,\r\na moderate amount of labour by a small part of the human race, will be\r\nsufficient to produce all the physical comforts for the whole. There\r\ncan be no doubt, that it will be so, some day or another; but this\r\nbeautiful order of things is yet remote. The manufacturing system is\r\na novelty, it is expanding and maturing itself, (see _Note 15_), and\r\nas it ripens, it certainly will improve; the staunchest pessimists\r\ncannot deny this, yet we should expose ourselves to the most cruel\r\ndisappointments, if we imagined that the progress of improvement can\r\nbe otherwise than slow, step by step. There are seven-leagued boots in\r\nfairy-tales, but none in history. Meanwhile the manufacturing system\r\ntemporarily involves the most disastrous consequences, which it would\r\nbe useless to enumerate here. Who has not sounded its depths with\r\nterror? Who has not wept over it? It is the canker of England, a canker\r\nso inveterate, that one is sometimes tempted to think, that all the\r\nability displayed of late years by the British statesmen in attempts at\r\ndomestic reform, will prove a dead loss.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the manufacturing system into a new country,\r\nunder the empire of very different circumstances, is an event worthy\r\nof the closest attention. No sooner was I recovered from the sort of\r\ngiddiness with which I was seized at the sight of this extemporaneous\r\ntown, hardly had I taken time to touch it, to make sure that it was\r\nnot a pasteboard town, like those which Potemkin erected for Catherine\r\nalong the _road to Byzantium_, when I set myself to inquire, how far\r\nthe creation of manufactures in this country, had given rise to the\r\nsame dangers in regard to the welfare and morals of the working class,\r\nand in regard to the security of the rich and of public order, as in\r\nEurope; and through the polite attention of the agents of the two\r\nprincipal companies (the Merrimack and the Lawrence), I was able to\r\nsatisfy my curiosity. The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand\r\npersons in Lowell; of this number nearly five thousand are young women\r\nfrom 17 to 24 years of age, the daughters of farmers from the different\r\nNew England States, and particularly from Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\r\nand Vermont; they are here remote from their families, and under their\r\nown control. On seeing them pass through the streets in the morning\r\nand evening and at their meal-hours, neatly dressed; on finding their\r\nscarfs, and shawls, and green silk hoods which they wear as a shelter\r\nfrom the sun and dust (for Lowell is not yet paved), hanging up in the\r\nfactories amidst the flowers and shrubs, which they cultivate, I said\r\nto myself, this, then, is not like Manchester; and when I was informed\r\nof the rate of their wages, I understood that it was not at all like\r\nManchester. The following are the average weekly wages paid by the\r\nMerrimack corporation last May.\r\n\r\n                                   {  3.00 Dolls.\r\n  For picking and carding,         {  3.10\r\n                                   {  2.78\r\n  For spinning,                       3.00\r\n                                   {  3.10\r\n  For weaving,                     {  3.12\r\n                                             { 3.45 Dolls.\r\n  For warping and sizing,                    { 4.00\r\n  In the cloth-room (measuring and folding),   3.12\r\n\r\nThese numbers are averages; the wages of the more skilful hands\r\namounting to five, and sometimes nearly six dollars. Note that last\r\nMarch, in consequence of the crisis occasioned by the President's\r\nquarrel with the Bank, there was a general reduction of from 30 to 40\r\ncents a week. You know how much smaller are the wages of women than\r\nof men;[AD] there are few women in Europe, out of a few great cities,\r\nwho can earn more than 20 cents a day or one dollar a week. It must\r\nalso be remembered, that, in the United States the necessaries of life\r\nare not only much cheaper than in England, but even than in France, so\r\nthat a great many of these girls can save a dollar or a dollar and a\r\nhalf a week. After spending four years in the factories, they may have\r\na little fortune of 250 or 300 dollars, when they often quit work and\r\nmarry.[AE]\r\n\r\nIn France, it would be difficult to conceive of a state of things, in\r\nwhich young girls, generally pretty, should be separated from their\r\nfamilies, and thrown together, at a distance of 50 or 100 miles from\r\nhome, in a town in which their parents could have no person to advise\r\nand watch over them. It is a fact, however, with the exception of\r\na very small number of cases, which only prove the rule, that this\r\nstate of things has yet had no bad effects in Lowell. The manners of\r\nthe English race are totally different from those of us French; all\r\ntheir habits and all their notions wholly unlike ours. The Protestant\r\neducation, much more than our Catholic discipline, draws round each\r\nindividual a line over which it is difficult to step. The consequence\r\nis more coldness in the domestic relations, a more or less complete\r\nabsence of a full and free expression of the stronger feelings of the\r\nsoul, but, in turn, every one is obliged and accustomed to show more\r\nrespect for the feelings of others. What amongst us would pass for a\r\nyouthful imprudence or a pretty trick, is severely frowned upon by\r\nthe English and Americans, and particularly by the Americans of New\r\nEngland, who are, as has been said, double-distilled English. Nobody\r\nin this country, then, is surprised to see the daughters of rural\r\nproprietors, after having received a tolerable education, quit their\r\nnative village and their parents, take up their residence 50 or 100\r\nmiles off, in a town where they have no acquaintance, and pass two or\r\nthree years in this state of isolation and independence; they are under\r\nthe safeguard of the public faith. All this presupposes an extreme\r\nreserve of manners, a vigilant, inexorable, and rigid public opinion,\r\nand it must be acknowledged, that, under this rigourous system, there\r\nis a sombre hue, an air of listlessness, thrown over society; but, when\r\none reflects on the dangers to which the opposite system exposes the\r\ndaughters of the poor, who have no guardian to warn and protect them,\r\nwhen one counts its victims, however slight may be his sympathies with\r\nthe people, it is difficult to deny, that the Anglo-American prudery,\r\nall things considered, is fully worth our ease and freedom of manners,\r\nwhatever may be their attractions.[AF]\r\n\r\nThe manufacturing companies exercise the most careful supervision\r\nover these girls. I have already said, that, twelve years ago, Lowell\r\ndid not exist; when, therefore, the manufactories were set up, it\r\nalso became necessary to provide lodgings for the operatives, and\r\neach company has built for this purpose a number of houses within its\r\nown limits, to be used exclusively as boarding-houses for them. Here\r\nthey are under the care of the mistress of the house, who is paid by\r\nthe company at the rate of one dollar and a quarter a week for each\r\nboarder, that sum being stopped out of the weekly wages of the girls.\r\nThese housekeepers, who are generally widows, are each responsible for\r\nthe conduct of her boarders, and they are themselves subject to the\r\ncontrol and supervision of the company, in the management of their\r\nlittle communities. Each company has its rules and regulations, which\r\nare not merely paper-laws, but which are carried into execution with\r\nall that spirit of vigilant perseverance that characterises the Yankee.\r\nI will give you a short summary of one of these codes, for they seem to\r\nme to throw great light on some of the most striking peculiarities of\r\nthis country. I will take those of the Lawrence company, which is the\r\nmost recently formed; they are a revised and corrected edition of the\r\nrules and regulations, of the other companies. They bear date May 21,\r\n1833. Article first of the general rules is as follows: \"All persons\r\nemployed by the Company must devote themselves assiduously to their\r\nduty during working-hours. They must be capable of doing the work which\r\nthey undertake, or use all their efforts to this effect. They must on\r\nall occasions, both in their words and in their actions, show that\r\nthey are penetrated by a laudable love of temperance and virtue, and\r\nanimated by a sense of their moral and social obligations. The Agent\r\nof the Company shall endeavour to set to all a good example in this\r\nrespect. Every individual who shall be notoriously dissolute, idle,\r\ndishonest, or intemperate, who shall be in the practice of absenting\r\nhimself from divine service, or shall violate the Sabbath, or shall\r\nbe addicted to gaming, shall be dismissed from the service of the\r\nCompany. _Art. 2._ \"All ardent spirits are banished from the Company's\r\ngrounds, except when prescribed by a physician. All games of hazard and\r\ncards are prohibited within their limits and in the boarding-houses.\r\nThe articles following from 3 to 13, determine the duties of the\r\nagent, assistant agent, foremen, watch and firemen. Article thirteenth\r\ndirects, that every female employed by the Company shall live in one\r\nof the Company's boarding-houses, attend regularly at divine service,\r\nand rigidly observe the rules of the Sabbath. Article fourteenth\r\nand last, contains an appeal to the operatives, on the necessity of\r\nsubordination, and on the compatibility of obedience with civil and\r\nreligious liberty. There is, besides, a special rule relative to\r\nboarding-houses; it recounts, that the Company has built those houses\r\nand lets them at a low price, wholly for the good of the hands,[AG] and\r\nthat the Company, therefore, imposes certain duties on the persons who\r\nhire them. It makes them responsible for the neatness and comfortable\r\ncondition of the houses, the punctuality and good quality of the\r\nmeals, good order and harmony among the boarders; it requires that\r\nthe keepers of the houses shall receive no persons as boarders, who\r\nare not employed in the Company's works, and it obliges them to give\r\nan account of the behaviour of the girls. It also prescribes that the\r\ndoors shall be shut at ten, and repeats the injunction of attendance at\r\ndivine worship.\r\n\r\nThese regulations, which amongst us would excite a thousand objections\r\nand would be in fact impracticable, are here regarded as the most\r\nsimple and natural thing in the world; they are enforced without\r\nopposition or difficulty. Thus in regard to Sunday, for instance,\r\nwhich with us is a holiday, a day of amusement and gaiety, it is here\r\na day of retirement, meditation, silence, and prayer.[AH] This is one\r\nof the features in which the French type most strongly contrasts with\r\nthe Anglo-American. In a moral and religious point of view, there\r\nprevail among us a laxity and a toleration, which form a counterpart\r\nto the American _let-alone_ principle in political matters; whilst the\r\nprinciple of political authority, which has always been established in\r\ngreat vigour among us, under all forms of government, monarchy, empire,\r\nor republic, corresponds to the austere reserve of American manners, to\r\ntheir rigid habits of life, and to the religious severity which exists\r\nhere by the side of the great multiplicity of sects. So true is it,\r\nthat both order and liberty are essential to human nature, and that it\r\nis impossible to establish a society on one of these principles alone!\r\nIf you abandon a portion of the social institutions exclusively to the\r\nspirit of liberty, be assured that the principle of order will take no\r\nless exclusive possession of some other portion. Yield up to liberty\r\nthe whole field of politics, and you are compelled to give religion\r\nand manners wholly up to order. Leave manners and religion to liberty,\r\nand you find yourself obliged to strengthen the principle of order in\r\npolitics, under pain of suffering society itself to fall into ruins.\r\nSuch are the general laws of equilibrium which govern the nations and\r\nthe universe of worlds.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, then, the rules of the companies have been observed.\r\nLowell, with its steeple-crowned factories, resembles a Spanish town\r\nwith its convents; but with this difference, that in Lowell, you\r\nmeet no rags nor Madonnas, and that the nuns of Lowell, instead of\r\nworking _sacred hearts_, spin and weave cotton. Lowell is not amusing,\r\nbut it is neat, decent, peaceable, and sage. Will it always be so?\r\nWill it be so long? It would be rash to affirm it; hitherto the\r\nlife of manufacturing operatives has proved little favorable to the\r\npreservation of severe morals. So it has been in France, as well as\r\nin England; in Germany and Switzerland, as well as in France. But as\r\nthere is a close connexion between morality and competence, it may be\r\nconsidered very probable, that while the wages shall continue to be\r\nhigh at Lowell, the influences of a good education, a sense of duty,\r\nand the fear of public opinion, will be sufficient to maintain good\r\nmorals. Will wages, then, continue to be what they are? There are some\r\ncauses which must tend to reduce them; the rates of the duties which\r\nprotect American industry are progressively decreasing; on the 1st of\r\nJuly, 1842, they will be reduced to a maximum of 20 per cent. But,\r\non the other hand, the processes become more perfect, the labourers\r\ngrow more skilful, the capitalists are realising their outlays, and\r\nconsequently will no longer expect to divide 10 or 12 per cent. A\r\ncertain diminution of wages is very possible, even after that of last\r\nMarch, because labour is paid in the Lowell factories, better than\r\nit is in the surrounding country; but there must be limits to this\r\ndiminution. In Europe, work is often wanting for the hands; here, on\r\nthe other side, hands are wanting for the work. While the Americans\r\nhave the vast domain in the West, a common fund, from which, by\r\nindustry, each may draw for himself and by himself, an ample heritage,\r\nan extreme fall of wages is not to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn America as in Europe, competition among the head-workmen tends to\r\nreduce their wages; but the tendency is not increased in America, as in\r\nEurope, by the competition among the labourers, that is by an excess of\r\nhands wanting employ, for the West stands open as a refuge to all who\r\nare unemployed. In Europe, a coalition of workmen can only signify one\r\nof these two things; raise our wages or we shall die of hunger with our\r\nwives and children, which is an absurdity; or raise our wages, if you\r\ndo not, we shall take up arms, which is a civil war; in Europe, there\r\nis no other possible construction to be put upon it. But in America,\r\non the contrary, such a coalition means, raise our wages, or we go to\r\nthe West. Every coalition which does not amount to this in the minds of\r\nthe associates, is merely the whim of the moment, an affair of little\r\nimportance. This is the reason why coalitions, which in Europe are\r\noften able to shake the firmest fabric, present no real danger to the\r\npublic peace in this country, where authority is disarmed. This is the\r\nreason why European countries, burdened with an excess of population,\r\nneed for their safety and welfare a West, into which each may overflow\r\nafter its own manner. This also is the reason why France is right in\r\nkeeping Algiers.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AB] In passing into steam, water expands to one thousand seven hundred\r\ntimes its volume.\r\n\r\n[AC] This railroad was constructed for 60 miles through a vast forest\r\nof oak and pine, the few houses now found along the line having been\r\nerected since the execution of the work.\r\n\r\n[AD] The wages of a mere labourer in the factories at Lowell are from 5\r\nto 6 dollars a week; of a man who has a trade, as a smith, dyer, 8 to\r\n10 dollars, of the engravers of patterns on the printing cylinders, 17\r\nor 18 dollars.\r\n\r\n[AE] Out of one thousand females in the Lawrence mills, only eleven are\r\nmarried women, and nineteen widows.\r\n\r\n[AF] Mr H. C. Carey, in his _Essay on Wages_ (p. 89), quotes the\r\nfollowing letter from the director of one of the factories in Lowell.\r\n\"There have been in our establishment only three cases of illicit\r\nconnexions, and in all three instances the parties were married\r\nimmediately, several months before the birth of the child, so that in\r\nfact we have had no case of actual bastardy.\" Mr Carey adds, that he\r\nwas informed that there had been no such case at Dover, where there\r\nis a very large manufactory. Although I do not believe that such an\r\nexemplary degree of purity prevails in all the manufacturing districts,\r\nyet I am convinced that the morale of the manufacturing operatives are\r\nin harmony with those of the rest of the population.\r\n\r\n[AG] The company gets only 4 per cent. on the capital invested in\r\nthe boarding-houses, while the average rate of dividends on the\r\nmanufacturing stock is from 5 to 6 per cent. semi-annually.\r\n\r\n[AH] In the United States, the theatres are generally closed on Sunday,\r\nout of respect for the rules of the _Sabbath_; the only exception\r\nto this custom is among the French population of Louisiana. In New\r\nEngland, religious scruples on this point are carried farther than\r\nelsewhere; thus in Boston, a by-law of the city prescribes the shutting\r\nup of the theatres on Saturday evening, because, according to some\r\nprecisians, the _Sabbath_ begins at sunset on that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BANK.--SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ELMINGTON, (VA.) AUG. 24, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe elections of members of the House of Representatives will take\r\nplace in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, the principal States in\r\nthe Union, next October and November. Although the members then\r\nreturned will not take their seats until the session which begins\r\nin December, 1835, yet great importance is attached to the results\r\nof these elections, even in respect to the approaching session of\r\nCongress. On both sides preparations are making with the greatest\r\nactivity; both parties have chosen their text. As the harangues against\r\nan aristocracy of money have aroused the prejudices of the labouring\r\nclasses, who form the majority of electors, against the Bank, the\r\nwatchword of the Opposition is no longer ostensibly the Bank. But it\r\nsays to the electors, referring to the late acts of the President\r\ndirected against the Bank, and the doctrines which on this occasion\r\nhe has put forth in his messages; \"The executive power is guilty of\r\ngross usurpation; hasten to the rescue of the constitution from its\r\nmonstrous encroachments. It is no longer a question about the bank; but\r\nour liberties, bought by the blood of our fathers, are at stake, and\r\nan audacious soldier, surrounded by a train of servile place-men, has\r\ndared to trifle with our dearest rights.\" This is certainly the best\r\nground for the Opposition to take; for General Jackson, in the affair\r\nof the Bank, as in most other circumstances of his life, has cared\r\nlittle for forms. He has gone straight forward to his object, without\r\nstopping to consider where he was placing his foot.\r\n\r\nThe Administration party, which well knows how unpopular the Bank\r\nis with the multitude, since this unpopularity is chiefly its own\r\nwork, talks Bank and nothing but Bank. \"The Opposition,\" they say,\r\n\"is mocking you, when it calls upon you to save the Constitution and\r\nthe laws. What do they care for the Constitution and the laws? It is\r\nthe Bank that they wish to save. Down with the Bank! General Jackson,\r\n_the Hero of two Wars_, who pushed back the English bayonets from the\r\nUnion at the peril of his life, wishes to free the soil of the country\r\nfrom this prop of tyranny and corruption. The Bank is nothing but\r\nEnglish influence which seeks to enslave you. It is now to be seen,\r\nwhether you will be freemen or worshippers of the Golden Calf. In\r\nspite of the hypocritical protestations of the parasites of the Bank,\r\nremember, at the polls, that the question, the only question, the whole\r\nquestion, is Bank or no Bank.\" At bottom, what the Administration party\r\nsays, is true; the Opposition do not give up the cause of the Bank.\r\nThe question, which is at issue, and which is to be settled by the\r\nelections, is, in fact, the question of the Bank.\r\n\r\nBut whose fault is it, if the Opposition has a rightful cause to call\r\nthe citizens to the defence of the Constitution? Besides, the leaders\r\nof the Democratic party felt that their policy, which consisted in\r\nsetting up the local banks in opposition to to the National Bank, would\r\nnecessarily fail, and that the financial and commercial interests of\r\nthe country, comprising the local banks themselves, must, in the long\r\nrun, rally round the Bank of the United States. The abuse which they\r\nhad heaped upon the latter, would, therefore, fall directly upon the\r\nlocal banks. It was impossible that the democratic multitude, which\r\nhad much more just grounds of complaint against the local banks, than\r\nagainst the Bank of the United States, by which nobody had ever lost a\r\ndollar, should not perceive this. Accordingly, after having hesitated\r\na long time, the heads of the party seem ready to take the bold stand\r\nof openly denouncing all banks. Bank-bills, they say, are nothing but\r\nwretched rag-money; the eulogies of the metals, gold and silver, are\r\nnow become the order of the day. Gold is called _Jackson money_; the\r\nUnited States mint has been actively employed in striking gold coins,\r\nhalf-eagles and quarter-eagles. The principal journals of the Jackson\r\nparty pay the daily wages of their journeymen printers in gold; the\r\nwarm friends of the Administration affect to carry gold pieces in\r\ntheir pockets, and as paper only is generally used here in business\r\ntransactions, even of the most trifling amount, you may be certain\r\nthat a man who is seen with gold in his hands, is a Jackson-man. The\r\nPresident lately made a visit to his seat in Tennessee, and paid his\r\nexpenses all along the road in gold, and the Globe, his official organ,\r\ntook care to inform the public of it. At a dinner, given in honour of\r\nhim, by the citizens of Nashville, he proposed this toast: \"_Gold and\r\nsilver, the only currency recognised by the constitution!_\"\r\n\r\nThis apotheosis of gold and silver, abstractly considered, is all\r\nvery well; hitherto the metals have made too small a proportion of\r\nthe currency of the United States; gold, particularly, was never\r\nmet with. At its last session Congress removed one of the obstacles\r\nto gold remaining in the country and taking the place of small bank\r\nnotes, by raising its legal value. How far this act will effect its\r\nobject of keeping a certain quantity of gold in the country, I know\r\nnot; but I am persuaded, that the only prompt and effectual means of\r\nsweeping away the small bills, will be a National Bank. The prudent and\r\nexperienced men of the party will certainly resist a formal declaration\r\nof war against all banks; but it is hardly to be avoided, that in the\r\ndemocratic party, the most rash and the most violent should give the\r\nlaw to the men of moderation and experience. In this event, Mr Van\r\nBuren will have need of all his address to preserve discipline in the\r\nranks. He is too well acquainted with the commercial situation of the\r\nUnited States, to allow himself to dwell one moment on such a project\r\nas the destruction of the banks. His creed is the overthrow of the Bank\r\nof the United States, not because it is a bank, but because, in his\r\nview, its existence is contrary to the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the Opposition have already given it success in some\r\npartial and unimportant elections, but even if they should have the\r\nmajority in the next Congress, it would be but an incomplete victory,\r\nfor the Bank would not be preserved. Many persons who have joined the\r\nOpposition because its watchword was the Constitution and the laws,\r\nwould have kept aloof, had they seen the name of the Bank joined with\r\nthem, so rooted is the jealousy of this useful institution. Admitting,\r\nthen, that the Opposition triumphs in the coming elections, it will be\r\nnecessary to set some new springs in motion in order to save the Bank.\r\nIt is easy to refer at present to one on which the friends of the Bank\r\nwill not fail to rely.\r\n\r\nThe Union, homogeneous as it is in regard to language and general\r\ncharacter, is subdivided, as I have already said, into three groups,\r\ndaily becoming more and more strongly marked. North of the Potomac, the\r\nStates are poor in soil, but enriched by commerce[AI] and manufactures;\r\nthere are the great commercial towns, Boston, New York, Philadelphia,\r\nand Baltimore, and the secondary ports of Salem, Portland, New Bedford,\r\nNantucket, and Providence; there, also, are almost all the manufactures\r\nof the Union. These States do not admit slavery, with the exception\r\nof Maryland, where the slaves are on the decrease, and the Lilliputian\r\nState of Delaware, where slavery has, in fact, almost disappeared.\r\nSouth of the Potomac, between the Atlantic and the Mississippi, are the\r\nslave-holding States, wholly agricultural, and the only part of the\r\ncountry in which cultivation is conducted on a great scale, producing\r\ncotton, rice, sugar, and tobacco, without mechanical industry, and\r\nhaving but little commerce, except the coasting trade, the foreign\r\ntrade being in the hands of the North. In the West, reaching from the\r\ngreat lakes southwards, and lying on the Ohio and the Mississippi, is\r\na tract of the highest fertility, in which, since the peace of 1783,\r\nhave grown up the new States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, besides\r\nMichigan, which is now on the point of becoming a State. These are also\r\nagricultural States, producing corn and cattle of all kinds, yielding\r\nwhiskey and salted provisions, cultivated by free hands, and in which\r\nproperty is so far subdivided, that each family has its own farm.\r\n\r\nOf these three groups, the North is most interested in the existence of\r\na Central Bank; it is there, also, that the financial machinery of the\r\nUnion is most thoroughly understood, and it is most fully perceived,\r\nthat such a Bank is one of its most indispensable wheels. But the North\r\nalone, even with the support of some commercial towns in the South and\r\nWest, such as New Orleans and Cincinnati, does not make up a majority,\r\nand in the North itself, in the rural districts back of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, a jealousy of the commerce of the cities prevails,\r\nwhich is worse than injustice, for it is ingratitude, and which\r\ndisplays itself by a blind hostility to the Bank. In a word, although\r\nthe question of a National Bank is considered almost a question of\r\nexistence by the great commercial capitals of the North, without whose\r\nenterprise that region would be still little better than a wilderness,\r\nyet the North is far from being unanimous in favour of such an\r\ninstitution, and were it so, would not alone be able to save it. The\r\nNorth, then, must seek allies in the South or the West; there are some\r\nsymptoms of the increase of the Opposition in the West, but this is\r\nonly because the question of the Bank has been temporarily left out of\r\nview. The West does not favour the Bank nor the banks. The hatred of\r\nthese eminently democratic States to the banking system is formally\r\nproclaimed in the constitutions of Indiana and Illinois, by which banks\r\nare expressly prohibited, unless the State think proper to establish\r\none itself, with its own funds; a measure which each has already made\r\npreparations to adopt. It is to the South, then, that the North must\r\nlook for help.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the South and the North are very different from\r\neach other in many points (See _Letter X._), and in a certain degree\r\nthere are the same analogies and the same contrasts between the North\r\nand the South, as between England and France.[AJ] The South, like,\r\nFrance, is most distinguished for the brilliant qualities; the North,\r\nlike England, for the solid; great ideas have their origin rather\r\nin the South; good execution belongs rather to the North. The North\r\nis gifted with the English perseverance, at once the pledge and the\r\ncondition of success; the South, like us, is easily moved, but easily\r\ndiscouraged; all ardour at the outset, but disconcerted by a check from\r\nany unforeseen obstacle. It was a matter of general surprise through\r\nthe Union last year, that the South Carolinians had completed, and\r\ncompleted in a good style of execution, a railroad from Charleston to\r\nAugusta; the distance is equal to that from Havre to Paris. From the\r\nintermixture of northern with southern men in Congress, we find in that\r\nbody a spirit of calculation and a practical good sense combined with\r\na lively imagination and large views; the well balanced combination\r\nof these opposite qualities explains the union of boldness and wisdom\r\nwhich generally characterises the acts of that body. Until recently,\r\nwhen the West has suddenly loomed up, and taken its stand by the\r\nside of these two rivals, the domestic politics of the United States\r\nhave consisted in maintaining the balance between the North and the\r\nSouth.[AK]\r\n\r\nThere are important differences in the political views of the North\r\nand the South. The North has more respect for the Federal bond, and\r\nis disposed to tighten rather than to relax it. The South has the\r\nopposite tendency. The South is opposed to the tariff, to the system\r\nof internal improvements by the Federal government, to whatever tends\r\nto enlarge the influence of the Federal authority. \"The lighter is\r\nthe Federal yoke,\" says the South, \"the more easily it will be borne,\r\nthe less cause there will be to fear, that any of the members of the\r\nconfederation will be tempted to shake it off.\" \"By relaxing too much\r\nthe Federal bond,\" says the North, \"you destroy it. If you go on\r\nthus, even for a short time, the Union will be dissolved indeed, and\r\nwill exist only in name; the slightest accident will then be enough to\r\nabolish even the name.\" In all these quarrels, however, even in that of\r\nNullification, when a part of the South threatened to break the Federal\r\ncompact, they have hitherto come to an understanding. Concessions have\r\nbeen made by both sides, but more often by the North than by the South,\r\nand as they have so long continued to preserve a Union, there is room\r\nto hope, that they will still be able to live together for a long time\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nThe general leaning of the South to an interpretation of the\r\nconstitution most favourable to the sovereignty of the States, has\r\nled many of the southern politicians to maintain the doctrine of the\r\nunconstitutionality of the Bank; although in opposition to a formal\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States, the chief-justice\r\nof which, Judge Marshall, is more revered throughout the Union, than\r\nany other southern man, and even more so in the South than elsewhere.\r\nThe Constitution, say the States' rights puritans, does not give\r\nCongress power to establish a Bank of the United States. On the other\r\nside, if they are ticklish as to what they call the encroachments of\r\none branch of the national government, the Congress, they are not less\r\nso as to those of which the Opposition accuses another branch, that\r\nis, the President. Thus at the same moment that they combat the Bank,\r\nthey combat the President also, on account of his measures against\r\nthe Bank. This third party is numerous in Virginia. Now allowing\r\nthe conclusions of the States' right party relative to the Bank to\r\nbe founded on a strict interpretation of the law, they are none the\r\nless inadmissible in practice. And as it is impossible in the United\r\nStates to give currency to the maxim, _push the colonies rather than\r\nprinciple_, the North entertains the hope that the States' rights\r\nparty, after the example of some of its leaders, such as Mr Calhoun\r\nand Mr McDuffie, will relax a little of the rigour of their theories.\r\nThe Administration, on the other hand, is doing its utmost to preserve\r\nthe theoretical notions of Virginia on the Bank question in all\r\ntheir original purity on their native soil, and Mr Van Buren, who is\r\nfar-sighted, lately sent the following toast to a 4th of July dinner in\r\nthat State: \"_Unqualified war on the Bank of the United States_.\"\r\n\r\nThe North, fortunately for itself, has a means of acting upon the\r\nSouth, by slavery. This requires some explanation. At the time of the\r\ndeclaration of Independence (1776), slavery existed in all the States.\r\nDuring the war of the Revolution, Pennsylvania, in 1780, adopted a\r\nplan which soon exterminated it within her limits; Massachusetts, in\r\n1781, proclaimed slavery to be incompatible with the laws already\r\nexisting; the other States of New England, and finally New York, and\r\nthe other States north of the Potomac, with the exception of Delaware\r\nand Maryland, adopted measures similar to those of Pennsylvania.[AL]\r\nThis was an easy matter for these States, their slaves not forming more\r\nthan one twentieth or one fifteenth of the whole population. But it was\r\na very different affair in the South, where the proportion of slaves\r\nwas six or seven times greater, and where all the rural labour and\r\nmenial services were performed by slaves; the institution of slavery\r\nwas, therefore, permitted to stand, in the South. The acquisition of\r\nLouisiana and Florida has enlarged the number of slave States, and\r\nby an oversight, which will one day be bitterly rued, slavery has\r\nbeen authorised in some of the new States, such as Missouri, where\r\nit would be easy to do without the blacks.[AM] In 1790, there were\r\n660,000 slaves[AN] distributed in six States, one Territory, and the\r\nFederal District; in 1830 there were 2,000,000, in twelve States, two\r\nTerritories, and the Federal District. The white population of the\r\nslave section, in 1790, was 1,250,000, or as 190 to 100; in 1830, it\r\nwas 3,760,000, or as 186 to 100. The proportional increase of the slave\r\npopulation would appear still greater if we added the free blacks, and\r\nstruck out the States of Delaware and Maryland. In 1830, the number of\r\nslaves in Louisiana and South Carolina was greater than that of the\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\nIn our days, slavery is a scourge to all the countries in which it\r\nexists; of this the people of the United States, in the South as\r\nwell as in the North, are convinced; but how to put an end to it?\r\nThe bloody experiment of St. Domingo and its fatal consequences to\r\nthe majority of the blacks themselves, offer no encouragement to\r\nimmediate emancipation. The great experiment just making by the English\r\ngovernment in its colonies,[AO] is not yet advanced enough to afford\r\nany light. Besides, the English colonies contain only about one third\r\nof the number of slaves now in the United States. And supposing the\r\nslaves once emancipated, what shall be done with them? This question\r\nis the most embarrassing of all, to one who is acquainted with the\r\nwretched condition of the free blacks in the United States. (See _Note\r\n16_.) On the other hand, the difficulties increase with the progress of\r\ntime, and the Southern States are, or think they are, obliged to adopt\r\nmeasures in regard to the black population, which may be defended by\r\nthe plea of necessity, but which are nevertheless excessively harsh.[AP]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the precautions against an insurrection of the blacks,\r\nthe solicitude of the Southern States continually increases; from the\r\nfirst of this month the blacks in the English West Indies, which are\r\nwithin three days' sail of the United States, are partially free.\r\nBetween those islands and the southern and northern ports, there\r\nis an active commerce, and the communication is frequent. Finally,\r\nreligious proselytism, which has carried the measure of emancipation\r\nin England, has its organs in the United States. There are not wanting\r\nphilanthropists in Boston, Philadelphia, and Ohio, who are always ready\r\nto facilitate the escape of runaway slaves. Last winter, while I was\r\nat Richmond, 40 or 50 slaves disappeared, and there is no doubt that\r\nthe fanatics of Philadelphia or New England furnished them the means\r\nof flight. The question of slavery, then, is, of all others, the most\r\ndeeply interesting and alarming to the Southern States. Whenever it\r\nhas been raised, even indirectly and secondarily, they have vehemently\r\nremonstrated; the moment it is touched, their voice is heard; this is\r\ntheir weak side; here the North has a hold upon them.\r\n\r\nIn regard to slavery, the Northern States have never departed from the\r\npolicy of concession. This conduct of the North may even appear like\r\nculpable connivance, to Europeans not aware that the most precious\r\ntreasure of North America, that is to say, the Union, has been at\r\nstake. The Northern States have written in their laws all that the\r\nSouth has demanded; they have granted to the southern master the\r\nright to claim his runaway slave before their own courts, so that the\r\nrepublican soil of the North does not enjoy the privilege which belongs\r\nto some of the monarchical countries of Europe, that of giving liberty\r\nto whoever sets his foot upon it. The North has permitted slavery to be\r\nmaintained in the Federal District, in Washington, at the foot of the\r\nCapitol steps. The North, seeing the South in a flame on the Missouri\r\nquestion, stifled its just repugnance to her admission. The North,\r\nwhich has an interest in the recognition of Hayti, has yielded that\r\npoint, because the South declares that it would be an encouragement to\r\nthe slaves to revolt. Thus to maintain harmony in the Union, the North\r\nhas pushed its concessions even to silencing its religious feelings,\r\nits principles of liberty, its commercial interests. As the Union\r\npromotes the good of all, all ought to be ready to make sacrifices to\r\npreserve it, and it would be just, that the South should renounce its\r\ntheories about the constitutionality of a National Bank, theories which\r\nare belied by long practice, and which have been formally condemned by\r\njudges, of whom the South itself is proud.\r\n\r\nSome months ago the public clamour imposed silence on the Abolition\r\nSocieties in the North, whose object is the abolition of slavery in the\r\nSouth. The newspapers contain details of the devastation and pillage\r\ncommitted by a handful of people on the poor, inoffensive blacks,\r\nduring three consecutive nights of July, in New York, and during the\r\nsame number in Philadelphia, about a week ago. Far be it from me to\r\naccuse the Opposition, which has the majority in these two cities, of\r\nhaving been an accomplice of these wretches! Yet I believe I state a\r\nfact when I say, that those terrible riots, in which houses, schools,\r\nand churches were plundered and pulled down every evening by the dozen,\r\nand in which peaceable persons of colour were robbed and personally\r\nabused, would have been more promptly repressed, had not the North,\r\nabove all things else, been eager to punish the Abolitionists, and\r\nto show to the South that it had nothing in common with them. The\r\nNorth, in a word, has given and continues to give to the South every\r\nconceivable guarantee on the subject of slavery. The South, which may\r\none day need, not merely the passive forbearance, but the active aid of\r\nthe North against insurrection, should consider if the North exacts too\r\nmuch in return, in asking toleration for an institution indispensable\r\nto the North, and from which the South itself has received nothing but\r\nfavours.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AI] In 1833, out of 108 millions the ports of the north imported 96\r\nmillion dollars. Deducting the imports of New Orleans, those of all\r\nthe Southern States were only of the value of 2,700,000 dollars. The\r\nexports of the South are much greater than its imports.\r\n\r\n[AJ] I asked a fellow countryman, established at Richmond, whose\r\npatriotism had not been cooled by a long absence from France, why he\r\npreferred Richmond to the northern cities, which, in some respects, are\r\nmore favourable to business; \"Because,\" he replied, \"the Virginians are\r\nthe French of America.\"\r\n\r\n[AK] It has always been endeavoured to balance the number of\r\nnon-slave-holding States, as much as possible, by an equal number\r\nof slave States; by this means, the Senate would be exactly divided\r\nbetween the two interests. In 1789, six of the thirteen States admitted\r\nslavery; in 1792, there were 16 States, equally divided between the\r\ntwo systems; in 1802, out of 17 States, nine did not admit slavery,\r\nbut in 1812, the admission of Louisiana restored the balance. From\r\n1816 to 1819, four States were admitted, Alabama and Mississippi,\r\nslave-holding, Indiana and Illinois, non-slave-holding. In 1820,\r\nMaine, without slaves, and in 1821 Missouri with slaves, followed. In\r\n1836 Michigan at the north, and Arkansas at the south, were received\r\ninto the Union, and next will come the turn of the slave-holding\r\nFlorida, and the non-slave-holding Wisconsin. It should be observed\r\nthat Delaware, in which slavery is allowed by law, may be considered a\r\nnon-slave-holding State, and is often reckoned so. The President has\r\ngenerally been from the South.\r\n\r\n[AL] They consisted in declaring all persons born after a certain\r\nperiod free, the children of a slave to remain in the service of her\r\nowner during a certain number of years.\r\n\r\n[AM] At the time of its admission into the Union, Missouri contained\r\nonly ten or eleven thousand slaves, which might have been easily sold\r\nin the neighbouring slave-holding States.\r\n\r\n[AN] Deducting those in the Northern States.\r\n\r\n[AO] The indemnity allowed to the owners amounts to about 125 dollars\r\na head, which for 2,500,000, the present number in the United States,\r\nwould amount to about 312 millions.\r\n\r\n[AP] Some are surprised, that the slave and the free black are more\r\nseverely dealt with by the laws of the Southern States, than by those\r\nof a colony belonging to an absolute monarchy, Cuba for instance, and\r\nthat, for example, it should be prohibited, under pain of fine and\r\nimprisonment, to teach them to read or write. The contrary would be\r\nmuch more surprising. In a country where there is perfect liberty for\r\nthe free class, it would be impossible to sustain slavery unless by the\r\nseverest legislation. If the slave should read in your constitutions\r\nand bills of right, \"that all men are born free and equal,\" how can\r\nit be that he would not be in a standing conspiracy against you? It\r\nis just to observe that, in the United States, the slaves, though\r\nintellectually and morally degraded, are humanely treated in a physical\r\npoint of view. They are less severely tasked, better fed, and better\r\ntaken care of, than most of the peasants of Europe. Their rapid\r\nincrease attests their easy condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       NEW YORK, NOV. 11, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe autumnal elections have taken place in most of the States, and\r\nhave resulted favourably to the democratic party and the President.\r\nLast April the mayor of New York, who is a Jackson man, was chosen by\r\nthe small majority of 181 votes out of 35,147, and the Opposition\r\nprevailed in the Common Council. The majority in favour of General\r\nJackson is now 2,400; several causes have contributed to produce this\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Bank, whose cause is closely connected with that of the\r\nOpposition, sounds more and more odious to the ears of the multitude;\r\nthis is unjust, but it is, nevertheless, true, and some of the late\r\nmeasures of the Bank have redoubled the animosity of the democratical\r\nparty towards it. It refused to show its books to the committee of\r\ninquiry appointed by the House of Representatives, unless in the\r\npresence of the officers of the Bank, and its enemies have persuaded\r\nthe multitude, that the _Monster_ dared not reveal the secrets of\r\nits den to the representatives of the people.[AQ] The Bank persists,\r\nconformably to the custom of merchants, in demanding damages on account\r\nof the protest by the French government of the bill of exchange sold to\r\nthe Bank by the Administration, and has withheld the dividends due the\r\nUnited States on their stock. The purpose is merely, say the officers\r\nof the Bank, to bring the question of damages before the proper\r\ntribunal. But the democratic party takes this act as the text for its\r\ntirades against the Bank. \"Behold it,\" they say, \"setting itself above\r\nthe laws, taking the execution of justice into its own hands, and under\r\nfalse pretences, laying hold of the public money.\" In both these cases\r\nit is quite possible that the right was wholly on the side of the Bank,\r\nbut appearances are against it, and nothing can be more injurious to\r\nit in a country governed by universal suffrage. Many of its friends,\r\nadmitting that the course of the Bank has been strictly legal, would\r\nhave preferred that a more prudent policy had been adopted, both for\r\nthe interest of the Bank itself and of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe silence of the principal speakers in Congress, who are almost\r\nall in the ranks of the Opposition, has no less contributed to\r\nswell its losses since the close of the session. The friends of the\r\nAdministration in Congress, and more especially in the Senate, were\r\nbeaten in debate, they felt it themselves, and their whole appearance\r\nwas a formal confession of defeat; the whole party was disconcerted by\r\nthis hesitation and embarrassment of the leaders. Since the 30th of\r\nJune, the party, generals and soldiers, has had time to rally; they\r\nhave restored their ranks beyond the reach of the fire of Messrs Clay,\r\nCalhoun, and Webster, and they have gained a victory, which four months\r\nago they could not have hoped for. The revival of business in the\r\ncountry has also turned to the disadvantage of the Opposition. During\r\nthe April elections in New York, the community was just recovering from\r\na crisis, all classes had suffered and were still suffering. It was\r\ndifficult to deny, that the distress had been caused by the President's\r\nattack on the Bank, in what he himself called an experiment. Commerce\r\nis now active again, the autumn business has been good, and every\r\nthing encourages the expectation of a not less favourable state of\r\nthe spring-trade. General Jackson's experiment seems then to have\r\nsucceeded; and a great number of persons who belong to the democratic\r\nparty as their natural element, and who had quitted it in the spring,\r\nhave very naturally fallen back into its ranks.\r\n\r\nBut it is proper to explain the real extent of this victory of the\r\nAdministration; the Opposition has not actually been driven from its\r\nformer positions, but the Jackson party has maintained the greater\r\nnumber of those it before occupied, and has particularly stood firm\r\nin Pennsylvania and New York. In a word, to judge by the elections\r\nthat have already taken place, the House of Representatives in the\r\nsession that begins at the close of 1835, will be, like the present\r\nHouse, composed of a majority of Jackson men. The Opposition, however,\r\nhas gained rather than lost. It has carried the State of Maryland by\r\na considerable majority, and has even gained the democratic State of\r\nOhio, upon which it hardly calculated; ten Representatives out of\r\nnineteen from that State, belong to the Opposition, and although the\r\nGovernor is of the Jackson party, the majority of the State legislature\r\nis Anti-Jackson, an important circumstance because the legislatures\r\nelect the Senators in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe elections in Pennsylvania, where the Opposition has lost two\r\nrepresentatives, have surprised no one, but those in New York have\r\ndisappointed all calculations. I know that some well-informed Jackson\r\nmen, who had formed correct anticipations in regard to former\r\nelections, did not expect a majority of more than three or four\r\nhundred in the city, and, as I have before observed, they had one of\r\n2,400. The Opposition thought itself able to contest the possession\r\nof the State, and relied upon carrying the city. It is certainly\r\nextraordinary, that the commercial interest should be beaten in the\r\nfirst commercial city in the New World, and such a result does no\r\nhonour to the system which has caused it. The unexpected triumph of the\r\nOpposition in Ohio had redoubled their confidence in New York; they had\r\ncelebrated with great display the junction of the young giant of the\r\nWest with the Anti-Jackson forces. One of the magnificent steamboats\r\nbelonging to the New York and Albany line, and called the Ohio, had\r\nbeen sent up the river with cannon, and the roar of its guns had been\r\nmingled with the shout of the towns and villages on the Hudson. The\r\nlittle frigate Constitution, the palladium of the opposition in New\r\nYork,[AR] had been publicly paraded before the eyes of the multitude.\r\nA packet-boat had been sent up the canal from Albany, and made the new\r\nand flourishing towns, which at once give to and take from that great\r\nartery of the State, life, activity, and wealth, to resound with salvos\r\nof artillery in honor of Ohio. But now the cannon of the Opposition is\r\nsilent, and that of Tammany Hall only is heard. The little frigate,\r\nwhich during the elections was hung up before the head-quarters of\r\nthe Opposition, no longer displays the coloured lights with which her\r\nrigging was then illuminated. The streets of New York, which do not\r\nindeed require it, receive no additional light, except from the Jackson\r\nprocessions, which parade them nightly by torch-light.\r\n\r\nThe New York elections are not only important in their results, but\r\nalso on account of the order which prevailed while they were going on.\r\nDuring the last six months, the spirit of anarchy had raised its head\r\nin the United States in such a manner as to inspire serious alarm,\r\neven among those not prone to be timid. You know what happened in\r\nNew York during the April elections; several months later, in July,\r\nthe city became the theatre of a series of outrages against the poor\r\nblacks, which were repeated several nights. In August the same excesses\r\nware committed in Philadelphia, under the same pretext, and with no\r\nless audacity and perseverance: then came the brutal assault on the\r\nconvent in Charlestown, when the retreat of peaceful nuns devoted to\r\nthe education of young girls was attacked, plundered, and burnt down,\r\nwithout the Selectmen of the town having the power or the courage to\r\nmake head against the rioters, and without the well-disposed citizens,\r\ntaken by surprise by this act of savage intolerance, venturing to\r\ninterfere. (See _Note 17_). Hardly a month since, there was also\r\nan incendiary conflagration at Philadelphia on the evening of the\r\nelection; six houses were burnt, and the firemen were driven off\r\nby the rioters, as at Charlestown, by main force. The same evening,\r\nan event of a more grave character occurred; several muskets were\r\ndischarged by some of the Opposition whom the mob had assailed with\r\nstones, several persons were wounded, and one or two killed. A week\r\nbefore, during the preparatory elections, an obscure and peaceable\r\nindividual was killed by a stab with a dagger.\r\n\r\nA repetition of these scenes of disorder was feared in New York; but\r\nnothing of the sort occurred. Nearly 36,000 voters exercised their\r\nright of suffrage without any disturbance, although both parties were\r\nhighly excited. The merit of this wise conduct is wholly due to the\r\npeople; the Common Council had, indeed, taken extraordinary measures\r\nfor the preservation of the peace, but what is here considered\r\nextraordinary, hardly comes up to the ordinary police in Europe. If\r\nthe multitude in the United States abstain from acts of violence, it\r\nis because they choose to do so; if they preserve order, it is because\r\nthey love order. Three hundred constables more or less, in a city of\r\n260,000 souls, like New York, could do nothing. Some persons, however,\r\nattribute this moderation of the democracy wholly to its confidence\r\nin success, and insist, that, if there had been any symptoms of the\r\nelections going the other way, the streets would have been thronged, as\r\nin April, by bodies of men armed with clubs.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Bank has been decided by these elections. In fifteen\r\nmonths its charter expires, and the Bank will die, to be revived ere\r\nlong under a new form, when a new series of commercial disasters, shall\r\nhave proved to the conviction of the most incredulous, that they cannot\r\nget along without it. It is worthy of note, that it falls by the hands\r\nof the two States that owe it the most, New York and Pennsylvania.\r\nThe blindness of Pennsylvania in particular is inexplicable. Who\r\nwould expect this stupid fury in drying up the sources of its own\r\nprosperity? For without the Philadelphia capital, the interior\r\ndistricts of the State would yet be a wilderness; its one thousand\r\nmiles of canals and railroads, its innumerable bridges, the finest\r\nwooden structures in the world, its numerous roads, its manufactures\r\nand mines which now enrich it, would not exist. Some persons assert,\r\nthat Pennsylvania, which begins with perhaps the most enlightened\r\nand refined city in the United States, ends with a rural population\r\nof German origin, the most ignorant and stupid in North America. The\r\nconduct of the Pennsylvanians in regard to the Bank is not calculated\r\nto change the opinion of these severe judges.[AS] As for the New York\r\nelectors, it may be supposed, that, if the seat of the Mother Bank\r\nwere in their capital, the votes of the town and the State would have\r\nresulted very differently.\r\n\r\nThe only chance left for the Bank is, that the portion of the South\r\nwhich is under the influence of Virginia, should condescend to lend\r\nit a helping hand. Such an act of generous compassion on the part of\r\nthe South is not probable, but it is not absolutely impossible. I\r\nhave often been present at discussions between men of the South and\r\nthe North, in which the latter have said to the former: \"Without us\r\nyou would be at the mercy of your slaves; it is our union with you\r\nwhich will prevent them from rising and cutting your throats.\" The\r\nSoutherners answered: \"We will take it upon ourselves to keep down our\r\nslaves; we shall have no need of your help against any attempts at\r\ninsurrection for a long time to come. All we ask of you is, not to stir\r\nthem up to revolt. But as for you, why you are yourselves overwhelmed\r\nby a flood of ultra-democracy. Your workmen give you the law. Before\r\nlong you will be glad to get the aid of the South to restore the\r\nbalance which your universal suffrage has destroyed.\" The South has now\r\na fine opportunity to exercise in the North this moderating power of\r\nwhich it boasts the possession.\r\n\r\nFrederic the Great, having gained a victory over the Imperialists just\r\nafter the battle of Fontenoy, wrote to Louis XV.: \"I have just paid the\r\ndraft which your majesty drew on me at Fontenoy.\" General Jackson has\r\nhonoured the bill drawn on him by the New York electors more promptly.\r\nA circular has been directed by the Secretary of the Treasury to the\r\nreceivers of the public money, prohibiting the reception of certain\r\ndrafts on the branch banks. These drafts were issued, merely because it\r\nwas physically impossible for the president and cashier of the Mother\r\nBank to sign five and ten dollar notes, fast enough to supply the place\r\nof those that were worn out or torn in the course of circulation. They\r\nhave the same form with the Bank-notes, and pass like them, although\r\nthe charter of the Bank makes no mention of them. This act of the\r\nAdministration will, however, do no injury to the Bank; for if it is\r\nobliged to withdraw all these drafts, amounting to seven millions, from\r\ncirculation, there is nothing to prevent its issuing bills to the same\r\namount. The Bank is prepared for every event; the amount of its bills\r\nin circulation comprising the drafts on the branches, does not exceed\r\n17 millions, and its means in specie, or other property that can be\r\nrealised at a moment's warning, exceed 20 millions. It will merely be\r\nnecessary for the president, Mr Biddle, and the cashier, Mr Jaudon,\r\nwho were already crowded with business, to devote three or four hours\r\na day to signing bills; for the branch drafts were only designed to\r\nrelieve them from this duty. The order of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\namounts, therefore, merely to a task inflicted on those gentlemen.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, there is at present a reaction against\r\nthe aristocracy of money. Whilst here the eternal chorus of NO\r\nBANK! DOWN WITH THE BANK! NO RAG-MONEY! is forever displayed on the\r\nliberty-poles and the flags of the democracy, amongst us the bankers\r\nare denounced from the national tribune by our most able speakers.\r\nDo those who hope that industry will soon raise itself to political\r\ninfluence and dignity, deceive themselves then? Or are not rather the\r\nindustrial classes themselves, and particularly those who are at their\r\nhead, the financial class, yet unconscious of their future destiny,\r\nand too slow to shake off the bad habits which they contracted when\r\nthe sword was law, and work was the lot of slaves and serfs? Do not\r\nthese Princes of Industry pay too little regard to those lofty and\r\nnoble sentiments which are well worth letters of nobility, and without\r\nwhich no supremacy could ever be sustained? To engage in public affairs\r\nwith dignity, the hands must be clean, the public good must be prized\r\nabove the money bags; and yet, such is the state of commercial dealings\r\nin our day, that, without inheriting a double share of generosity\r\nand patriotism, it is difficult to escape from them without becoming\r\ncontaminated and callous. How many honorable men are there not in the\r\nindustrial ranks, who groan over the customs to which they are obliged\r\nto conform, over the examples which they are obliged to imitate? The\r\nBank of the United States must pay the penalty of the vices, which\r\neven in our day degrade commerce, but which are henceforth to belong\r\nonly to history. It is punished for the sins of others, for this great\r\ninstitution has not itself deserved the reproach of cupidity; the\r\nservices it has rendered to the country are immense; those which it has\r\nrendered itself, that is to say, its profits, have been moderate.\r\n\r\nI must, however, do America the justice to observe, that, although\r\nthe desire to make money is universal, yet in the principal and older\r\ncommercial centres, there is more honesty and less illiberality than\r\namongst us. American selfishness is less contracted than ours; it does\r\nnot stoop to petty meannesses; it operates on a more liberal scale.\r\nThere are certainly wild speculators, blind and desperate gamblers here\r\nalso: but the objects of their schemes are almost always enterprises\r\nof public utility. The spirit of speculation in the United States\r\nhas strown this vast country with useful works, canals, railroads,\r\nturnpike-roads, with manufactories, farms, villages, and towns; amongst\r\nus it has been more rash, wild, and foolish, and much less productive\r\nin useful results. It is with us mere stock-jobbing, without any good\r\ninfluence on the prosperity of the country; it is a game in which the\r\ndice are loaded, in which the credulous lose the earnings of years in\r\na fever-fit of a moment. Its only results are ruin and despair, and if\r\nit contributes to people any thing, it is the cells of the mad-house.\r\nThese are sad truths, but truths which it may be useful to utter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AQ] The reason given for this refusal was the indiscreet use by a\r\nformer committee of inquiry, of notes made during a similar examination.\r\n\r\n[AR] This is a miniature frigate that takes its name from a favorite\r\nship in the American navy, which covered herself with glory in the last\r\nwar under the command of Hull, Bainbridge, and Stewart.\r\n\r\n[AS] The able Correa, for some time Portuguese minister to the United\r\nStates, used to say, that this State reminded him of the Sphinx, _which\r\nhad the head of an angel, and the body of a beast_. This saying is\r\noften quoted in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.\r\n\r\nPITTSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PITTSBURG, NOVEMBER 24, 1834.\r\n\r\nSeventy-six years ago this day, a handful of Frenchmen sorrowfully\r\nevacuated a fort, which stood on the point of land where the Alleghany\r\nand Monongahela mingle their waters to form the Ohio. The French, with\r\ntheir faithful allies the Indians, had made a vigourous resistance;\r\nthey had defeated the expedition sent against them in 1754, and\r\ncompelled Washington, then a lieutenant-colonel in the Virginia\r\nmilitia, to surrender Fort Necessity. They had routed the troops of\r\nthe boastful Braddock, and spread terror, of which the memory is not\r\nyet effaced, through the English colonies. But the destiny of France\r\nwas then in the hands of him, who of all her kings will be most\r\nseverely judged by the tribunal of history. Under that most dissolute\r\nand selfish prince, France, sacrificed to the paltry intrigues of the\r\nbed-chamber, humbled at home, could not triumph abroad. The French\r\nwere, therefore, obliged to abandon Fort Duquesne; on that day,\r\nNovember 24, 1758, one of the most magnificent schemes ever projected,\r\nwas annihilated.\r\n\r\nFrance had then possession of Canada and Louisiana; we were then\r\nmasters of the two finest rivers, the two largest and richest\r\nbasins of North America, that of the St. Lawrence and that of the\r\nMississippi.[AT] Between these two basins nature has raised no barrier,\r\nso that in the rainy seasons, canoes can pass from Lake Michigan into\r\nthe bed of the Illinois, and continue their course thence without any\r\nobstruction to the Gulf of Mexico. The plan of our heroic pioneers,\r\npriests, sailors, and soldiers, had been to found the empire of New\r\nFrance in this great valley. It is beyond a doubt, that this idea\r\nhad attracted the attention of Louis XIV., and that its execution\r\nwas already begun by the erection of a chain of posts, the sites\r\nof which were admirably chosen. There is no country in the world\r\nwhich comprises such an amount of so highly fertile land; none which\r\noffers natural routes of communication comparable to the net-work of\r\nnavigable rivers and streams spread over this great region. There is\r\nnone more healthy, for with the exception of a few points or tracts\r\nsubject to autumnal fevers, but which rapidly lose this character\r\nwhen brought under cultivation, there are only two infected spots,\r\nNew Orleans and Natchez, in which the yellow fever occasionally makes\r\nits appearance, during a few months in the year. The sums swallowed\r\nup by one of the foolish wars of Louis XV., would probably have been\r\namply sufficient to accomplish this noble project. But the enterprise,\r\nalthough pushed forward by the local agents with admirable zeal and\r\nsagacity, encountered only indifference from the ministers at home, the\r\ngreat point of whose policy was to know, who was to be the favourite\r\nmistress of his Most Christian Majesty on the morrow. The capture of\r\nFort Duquesne was soon followed by the conquest of all Canada by the\r\nEnglish; and in 1763, by the treaty of Paris (these treaties of Paris\r\nnever bode us any good), France, exhibiting an example of that complete\r\nsubmission and flat despair, of which our annals exhibit so many\r\ninstances, and the English so few, ceded the basin of the St. Lawrence\r\nand the left bank of the Mississippi to England, with one hand, and the\r\nright bank of that great river to Spain, with the other.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass, that the empire of New France, like so many other\r\nmagnificent schemes conceived in our country, existed only on paper,\r\nor in the visions of youthful officers, full of sagacity and boldness,\r\nand intrepid missionaries, heroes alike without a name, whose memory is\r\nhonoured only in the wigwam of some poor exiled Sachem. Fort Duquesne\r\nis now become Pittsburg; in vain did I piously search for some relics\r\nof the French fortress; there is no longer a stone, a brick, on the\r\nOhio, to attest that France bore sway here.[AU]\r\n\r\nPittsburg is at present essentially pacific; if cannon and balls are\r\nseen here, it is because a trading people make it a rule to supply the\r\nmarket with whatever is wanted. The cannon are new, fresh from the\r\nmould, and equally at the disposition of the Sultan Mahmoud, or the\r\nEmperor of Morocco, or the government of the States, whichever will pay\r\nfor them. Pittsburg is a manufacturing town, which will one day become\r\nthe Birmingham of America; one of its suburbs has already received that\r\nname. It is surrounded, like Birmingham and Manchester, with a dense,\r\nblack smoke, which, bursting forth in volumes from the founderies,\r\nforges, glass-houses, and the chimneys of all the manufactories and\r\nhouses, falls in flakes of soot upon the dwellings and persons of the\r\ninhabitants; it is, therefore, the dirtiest town in the United States.\r\nPittsburg is far from being as populous as Birmingham, but it exhibits\r\nproportionally a greater activity. Nowhere in the world is everybody so\r\nregularly and continually busy as in Pittsburg; I do not believe there\r\nis on the face of the earth, including the United States, where in\r\ngeneral very little time is given to pleasure, a single town in which\r\nthe idea of amusement so seldom enters the heads of the inhabitants.\r\nPittsburg is, therefore, one of the least amusing cities in the\r\nworld; there is no interruption of business for six days in the week,\r\nexcept during the three meals, the longest of which occupies hardly\r\nten minutes, and Sunday in the United States, instead of being, as\r\nwith us, a day of recreation and gaiety, is, according to the English\r\ncustom, carried to a greater degree of rigour by the Anglo-Americans,\r\nconsecrated to prayer, meditation, and retirement. By means of this\r\nenergetic assiduity in work, which is common to all ages and classes,\r\nand by the aid of numerous steam-engines which labour like humble\r\nslaves, the inhabitants of Pittsburg create an amount of products,\r\naltogether disproportioned to their number. The nature, bulk, and\r\nweight of the articles make this disproportion more striking; for,\r\nwhether it be that American art, yet a novice, cannot give the finish\r\nrequired for articles of luxury and ornament, or that the Americans\r\nhave the good sense to discern at a glance, that the manufacture of\r\nobjects of the first necessity or of essential use, is more profitable\r\nthan that of the trinkets with which civilisation seeks to adorn\r\nherself wherever there is wealth, and even where there is none, only\r\nthe ruder and coarser kinds of work are done in Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nAlthough Pittsburg is at this moment the first manufacturing town in\r\nthe Union, it is yet far from what it is destined one day to become.\r\nIt stands in the midst of an extensive coal-formation, the beds of\r\nwhich are very easily worked. The district east of Pittsburg furnishes\r\nmuch pig-iron, which is brought hither to be converted into malleable\r\niron, or into all kinds of machines, tools, and utensils. Pittsburg\r\nhas then coal and iron within reach; that is to say, power, and the\r\nlever by which the power is to be applied. The vent for its wares is\r\nstill more vast than its means, for the whole basin of the Mississippi,\r\nwith all its lateral valleys, which on our continent would be basins\r\nof the first class, lies open to it. The population, which improves in\r\nits condition, as rapidly as it increases in numbers,[AV] creates an\r\nindefinite demand for the engines and machines, hollow-ware, nails,\r\nhorse-shoes, glass, tools and implements, pottery, and stuffs of\r\nPittsburg. It needs axes to fell the primitive forests, saws to convert\r\nthe trees into boards, plough-shares and spades to turn up the soil\r\nonce cleared. It requires steam-engines for the fleet of steamers,\r\nwhich throng the western waters. It must have nails, hinges, latches,\r\nand other kinds of hardware for houses; it must have white lead to\r\npaint them, glass to light them; and all these new households must have\r\nfurniture and bed linen, for here every one makes himself comfortable.\r\n\r\nThus Pittsburg is beginning to be what Birmingham and St Etienne are,\r\nand what several places in the departments of the Aveyron and Gard will\r\nbecome, when we become more enterprising, and use the proper exertions\r\nto develop all the resources now buried in the bowels of our _belle\r\nFrance_, for so it is called everywhere abroad. Pittsburg is beside and\r\nmust be a commercial city, a great mart. Standing at the head of steam\r\nnavigation on the Ohio, it is, directly or indirectly, that is through\r\nthe medium of the more central cities of Cincinnati and Louisville,\r\nthe natural _entrepôt_ between the upper and lower country, the North\r\nand the South. Pennsylvania has spared no pains to secure and extend\r\nthe advantages resulting from this situation. It has made Pittsburg\r\none of the pivots of its great system of internal improvements, which\r\nwas undertaken with such boldness, and has been pursued with such\r\nperseverance. Pittsburg is connected with Philadelphia by a line of\r\nrailroads and canals nearly four hundred miles in length, and the\r\nnumerous branches of the Pennsylvania Canal give it a communication\r\nwith all the most important points in the State. A direct communication\r\nwith Lake Erie is, indeed, wanting, but it will soon have a double\r\nand triple one. A railroad, 300 miles in length is projected between\r\nBaltimore and the Ohio, and one third of the distance is already\r\ncompleted; the legislature of Pennsylvania have made it a condition\r\nthat the western terminus of this work shall be at Pittsburg. A canal,\r\nfor which the plans and drawings were furnished by General Bernard, is\r\nto connect Chesapeake Bay by the way of Washington with the Ohio, and\r\nthe same condition in favour of Pittsburg has been prescribed in this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nPittsburg is one of the few American towns, which owe their birth\r\nto war; it was at first one of the chain of French forts, and was\r\nafterward occupied by the English as a frontier post against the\r\nsavages. In 1781, Pittsburg consisted of a few houses under the\r\nprotection of the cannon of Fort Pitt. The origin of Cincinnati was\r\nsimilar; both commenced with a fortress, but more fortunate than some\r\nof our great commercial towns, such as Havre, which is stifled in the\r\nembrace of its fortifications, Pittsburg and Cincinnati have caused all\r\ntraces of their original destination to disappear. Of Fort Pitt, which\r\nthe English constructed just above the site of Fort Duquesne, nothing\r\nremains but a small magazine which has been converted into a dwelling\r\nhouse; another trace of the martial epoch (which here forms the\r\nmythological ages), is the name of Redoubt Alley, which is taken from\r\na battery once erected there, to sweep the Monongahela. At Cincinnati,\r\nFort Washington has been razed, and on its site now stands a bazaar\r\nbuilt by Mrs Trollope. Not one of the least singular changes that have\r\ntaken place in America within a half century, is the difference between\r\nthe old mode of founding a town, and the manner in which they are at\r\npresent made to rise out of the ground.\r\n\r\nSome weeks ago I visited the anthracite coal district in Pennsylvania\r\n(see _Note 18_); the Anthracite, the most convenient kind of fuel, is\r\nat present in general use all along the Atlantic coast from Washington\r\nto Boston, and its introduction has made a revolution in household\r\nmatters. Six or seven years since, when the demand for it was suddenly\r\nvery much increased, the district which contains the coal-beds became\r\nthe subject of speculation, at first prudently conducted, but finally\r\ngrowing wild and extravagant. The speculators vied with each other\r\nin tracing out town-plots; I have seen detailed plans, with straight\r\nstreets and fine public squares scrupulously reserved, of cities which\r\ndo not actually consist of a single street, of towns which hardly\r\ncontain three houses. This frenzy gave birth, however, to one town of\r\n3,000 inhabitants, Pottsville, to ten or twelve railroads, great and\r\nsmall, to several canals, basins, and mining explorations, that have\r\nproved pretty successful. As for the great cities, several of them\r\nhave really become flourishing villages, although the dreams of their\r\nfounders have not proved true.\r\n\r\nIn this anthracite region, in the manufacturing districts of the North\r\nEast, along the New York canals, and in all parts of the West, a\r\ntraveller often has an opportunity of seeing the process of building\r\ntowns. First rises a huge hotel with a wooden colonnade, a real\r\nbarrack, in which all the movements, rising, breakfasting, dining, and\r\nsupping, are regulated by the sound of a bell with military precision,\r\nuniformity, and rapidity, the landlord being, as a matter of course,\r\na general or, at least, a colonel of the militia. The bar-room is\r\nat once the exchange, where hundreds of bargains are made under the\r\ninfluence of a glass of whiskey or gin, and the club-room, which\r\nresounds with political debate, and is the theatre of preparations for\r\ncivil and military elections. At about the same time a post-office is\r\nestablished; at first the landlord commonly exercising the functions of\r\npostmaster. As soon as there are any dwelling-houses built, a church\r\nor meeting-house is erected at the charge of the rising community;\r\nthen follow a school-house and a printing press with a newspaper, and\r\nsoon after appears a bank, to complete the threefold representation of\r\nreligion, learning, and industry.\r\n\r\nA European of continental Europe, in whose mind the existence of a\r\nbank is intimately associated with that of a great capital, is very\r\nmuch surprised even for the hundredth time, at finding one of these\r\ninstitutions in spots yet in an intermediate state between a village\r\nand the primitive forest inhabited by bears and rattle-snakes. On the\r\nbanks of the Schuylkill, which has lately been canalled, and which,\r\nflowing from the coal-region, empties itself into the Delaware near\r\nPhiladelphia, may be seen the beginnings of a town, built during the\r\ntime of the mining speculations, at the head of navigation. Port\r\nCarbon, for that is its name, consists of about thirty houses standing\r\non the declivity of a valley, and disposed according to the plan of the\r\nembryo city. Such was the haste in which the houses were built, that\r\nthere was no time to remove the stumps of the trees that covered the\r\nspot; the standing trees were partially burnt and then felled with the\r\naxe, and their long, charred trunks still cumber the ground. Some of\r\nthem have been converted into piles for supporting the railroads that\r\nbring down the coal to the boats; the blackened stumps, four or five\r\nfeet high, are still standing, and you make your way from one house\r\nto another by leaping over the prostrate trunks and winding round the\r\nstanding stumps. In the midst of this strange scene, appears a large\r\nbuilding with the words, OFFICE OF DEPOSIT AND DISCOUNT. SCHUYLKILL\r\nBANK. The existence of a bank amidst the stumps of Port Carbon,\r\nsurprised me as much as the universal neatness and elegance of the\r\npeaceful Philadelphia, or the vast fleet which is constantly receiving\r\nand discharging at the quays of New York, the products of all parts of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nI return to the triple emblem of the church, the school with the\r\nprinting-press, and the bank. A society which is formed by accretion\r\naround such a nucleus, must differ more and more from the present\r\nEuropean society, which was formed chiefly under the auspices of\r\nwar, and by a succession of conquests, following one upon another.\r\nAmerican society, taking for its point of departure labour, based\r\nupon a condition of general ease on one side, and on a system of\r\ncommon elementary education on the other, and moving forward with\r\nthe religious principle for its lode-star, seems destined to reach\r\na degree of prosperity, power, and happiness, much superior to what\r\nwe have attained with our semi-feudal organisation, and our fixed\r\nantipathy against all moral rule and all authority. It presents,\r\ndoubtless, especially in the newer States, many imperfections, and it\r\nwill have to submit to various modifications; this is the lot of all\r\nunfinished works, even when God himself is the maker. But a few errors\r\nand follies are of little import in the eyes of those whose thoughts\r\nare occupied with the great interests of the future rather than with\r\nthe paltry troubles of the present hour. Of little moment are the\r\ndisgust and disappointment that a European of delicate nerves may have\r\nto encounter, if, for the purpose of killing time, he ventures upon\r\na western steamboat, or into a western tavern; so much the worse for\r\nhim, if he has fallen into a country where there is no place for an\r\nidle tourist, seeking only for amusement! Let the foreigner smile at\r\nthe simplicity and extravagance of national vanity. That patriotic\r\npride, rendered excusable by brilliant success, will be moderated; the\r\nerrors and the follies are daily correcting themselves; the unavoidable\r\nrudeness of the backwoodsman will be softened, as soon as there are no\r\nmore forests to fell, no more swamps to drain, no more wild beasts to\r\ndestroy. The evil will pass away, and is passing away; the good remains\r\nand grows and spreads, like a grain of mustard.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AT] The valley of the Mississippi with a small part of that of the\r\nSt. Lawrence belonging to the United States, is six times larger than\r\nall France.

Had such a paper come from any former President,--from\r\nWashington to John Quincy Adams,--it would have been looked upon as\r\nan expression of the sentiments of a majority of the American people.\r\nNeither of them would have been willing thus to commit the United\r\nStates, without being sure that the national will really required it.\r\nTheir rule of action would have been to let themselves be pushed on\r\nby the nation, rather than to draw it after them, or to go beyond it;\r\nand this, in fact, is more conformable to notions of self-government.\r\nThey would have had the question profoundly discussed by the cabinet,\r\nnot only orally, but in writing, as Washington did at the time of the\r\nestablishment of the first bank in 1791. They would have consulted\r\nindividually some of the leading statesmen of the country of all\r\nparties and all interests. They would have listened patiently to the\r\nrepresentations of those upon whom the heavy burden of war would have\r\nmost directly fallen, the merchants of Boston, New York, Philadelphia,\r\nBaltimore, Charleston, New Orleans, and other large ports; and finally,\r\nafter having weighed all objections, measured all difficulties, if\r\nthey had been convinced that the interest and honour of their country\r\nabsolutely required the appeal to the last argument, they would have\r\nreluctantly addressed the challenge to their oldest ally and friend, to\r\nthe firmest stay of liberty and improvement in the Old World.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson has changed all this; the rules of conduct and the\r\npolicy of his administration are no longer those adopted by the\r\nwisdom of his predecessors. Some may maintain that this change is\r\nfor the better; on this point, the future, and no distant future,\r\nwill decide; but the fact of a change is undeniable. General Jackson\r\npossesses in the highest degree the qualities necessary for conducting\r\na partisan warfare. Bold, indefatigable, vigilant, quick-sighted, with\r\nan iron will and a frame of adamant, devoted to his friends, harsh\r\nand terrible to his enemies, making light of obstacles, passionately\r\nfond of danger, his campaigns against the Creeks and Seminoles were\r\nmarked by the most brilliant success, and his resistance to the English\r\narmy under Packenham, at New Orleans, was heroic. By these exploits\r\nand the enthusiasm which military services excite in all countries,\r\nGeneral Jackson found himself the most popular man in the Union, when\r\nthe founders of the national independence disappeared, and naturally\r\nbecame the candidate for the presidential chair. Objections were made\r\nto his unbending temper, the impatience of contradiction which he had\r\nshown throughout his whole career, his obstinacy in following his own\r\nimpulses, in spite of the provisions of the laws, and his disposition\r\nto use the sword of Alexander, rather than to conform himself to the\r\ndelays of constitutional forms. His natural propensities, strengthened\r\nby the habits of military command, and by the peculiarities of that\r\nkind of warfare in which he had been engaged, must, it was urged, have\r\nbecome ungovernable; and it would be impossible for him to acquire that\r\nmoderation, which is necessary in the exercise of civil authority. It\r\nwas predicted that in politics, as in war, he would be zealous for his\r\nfriends, implacable towards his adversaries, violent against whoever\r\nshould attempt to check his course; that, instead of being above\r\nparty-quarrels, he would come down into the arena in person. His arrest\r\nof a judge in New Orleans, the execution of the militia men, and of the\r\ntwo Englishmen, Arbuthnot and Ambristier, his invasion and conquest\r\nof Florida in time of peace, his anger and threats when Congress was\r\ndeliberating upon charges founded on these summary acts, were all dwelt\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nBut his chivalric character, his lofty integrity, and ardent\r\npatriotism, seemed sufficient guarantees for his conduct, and from\r\nreasons of domestic policy, which it would take too much time to\r\nexplain, many enlightened men, who had at first treated the idea of\r\nsupporting him for the presidency with ridicule, gave into the plan,\r\ntrusting that they should be able to exercise a salutary influence over\r\nhim. His fiery temper seemed in fact to be calmed by his elevation; the\r\nrecollection of his professions, which, at the moment they were made,\r\nwere made in good faith, was yet fresh; he had conscientiously resolved\r\nto observe the principles consecrated by Washington, Jefferson, and\r\nand the other patriarchs of America, to keep himself scrupulously\r\nwithin the narrow limits of prerogative, as he had traced them or\r\nallowed them to be traced out for him; to follow the current of public\r\nopinion, without seeking to bar its course or divert it from its\r\nregular channels; to be moderate, patient, and calm. During his first\r\nterm, he continued pretty faithful to his resolution, to his professed\r\nprinciples, and to the advice of those who raised him to his seat. But\r\nthis state of constraint was insupportable to him; it is too late to\r\nreform at the age of sixty years.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is not all temperaments, or, I should rather say, the\r\ndistinctive qualities of all men, that can adapt themselves to that\r\nhigh sphere of serenity, in which he who governs others should move.\r\nSuch a conformity was even more difficult for General Jackson than\r\nfor any other man; the turbulence and impetuosity of youth had not\r\nbeen tempered in him either by age or by the fatigues of war. And in a\r\ncountry where universal suffrage prevails, political disputes are of a\r\ncharacter to exhaust the patience of an angel. Step by step, then, the\r\nstormy propensities of the Tennessee planter were seen returning. The\r\ncharacter of the bold, daring, restless, obstinate, fiery, indomitable\r\npartisan chief, of the conqueror of the Creeks and Seminoles, gradually\r\nbroke through the veil of reserve, caution, gravity, and universal\r\ngood-will which had covered it, and tore in pieces the constitutional\r\nmantle in which his friends had taken so much pains to wrap him.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1832, South Carolina furnished a natural occasion for\r\ngiving the rein to his warlike propensities, which had now been curbed\r\nfor four years. That State had, on its own individual authority,\r\ndeclared the tariff act of Congress null and void, and had armed\r\nits militia to sustain its nullification Ordinance. The President\r\nimmediately began preparations for war, retaining, however, the\r\nlanguage of moderation, and obtained an act of Congress (the Force\r\nBill) authorising him to employ all means to maintain the laws of the\r\nUnited States; when this storm was laid (see _Note 5_), General Jackson\r\nwas proclaimed the saviour of the Constitution; and perhaps sufficient\r\ncare was not taken to prevent a very natural mistake of an old soldier,\r\nand to make him sensible that the congratulations of a grateful people\r\nwere addressed less to his warlike attitude, than to the pacific\r\nmeasures taken under his auspices. In the heat of debate and the shout\r\nof acclamation that followed the restoration of order, the old military\r\nleaven began to ferment in the President's heart, and without a pause,\r\nhe rushed into a vigourous campaign against the Bank. This was a war\r\nalmost without provocation, certainly without a just cause, and for\r\nsome time it appeared that the General would be worsted. But he held\r\nhis own, and neither bent nor broke. In this affair he was the same\r\nOLD HICKORY that the Indians had found always and everywhere on their\r\ntrail, whom they could neither tire nor surprise, and upon whom they\r\ncould get no hold, either by force or fraud. The last elections of\r\nRepresentatives assure him the victory, and the Bank is condemned to\r\nthe fate of the Creeks and Seminoles, of Mr Clay and Mr Calhoun, of the\r\nSpanish government of Florida, and of the English General Packenham\r\n(see _Note 19_.)\r\n\r\nThe intoxication of success seems to have restored all the fire of\r\nhis youth, and at an age when other men look only towards repose, he\r\nrequires new perils and new fatigues. Last winter, Mr Clay declared in\r\nthe Senate, that, if phrenology were a true science, President Jackson\r\nmust certainly have the bump of combativeness, for his life had been\r\nnothing but the perpetual exercise of that appetite; at fourteen years\r\nof age, against the English, then against his neighbours the first\r\nsettlers of Tennessee, not a very tractable race, and who handled the\r\nknife, the sword, the pistol, and the rifle, with as much promptness as\r\nhimself; next against the Indians, the English, the Indians again, and\r\nthe inoffensive Spaniards; then against Mr Clay, Mr Calhoun, and South\r\nCarolina, and finally, for want of other adversaries, he was engaged\r\nin a bout with the Bank. The General seems, in fact, to be possessed\r\nwith the demon of war; for no sooner had he put his foot on the throat\r\nof the Bank, than he required a new enemy, and finding in America none\r\nbut vanquished adversaries, or objects unworthy of his anger, he flings\r\ndown the glove to France. Thus far the defiance thrown out to France\r\nis merely the expression of General Jackson's humour. But, unluckily,\r\nthis act of an individual emanates from a man who is President of\r\nthe United States until the 4th of March, 1837, and who is even more\r\npertinacious in his enmities than in his friendships. Unluckily too,\r\nthe defiance has been inserted in a solemn document, which is looked\r\nupon in Europe as the faithful exhibition of the sentiments of the\r\nAmerican people. And finally, the man who has set the United States in\r\nthis posture, has just made an experiment which shows the degree to\r\nwhich he can lead the people to espouse his personal quarrels.\r\n\r\nHis tactics in politics, as well as in war, is to throw himself forward\r\nwith the cry of, _comrades, follow me!_ and this bold stroke has\r\nsucceeded admirably in the case of the Bank. If he had recommended to\r\nCongress to withdraw the public deposits from that institution, he\r\nwould certainly have failed; Congress would have declared against it.\r\nHe, therefore, boldly took the first step himself, and ordered the\r\nremoval, in opposition to the advice of the majority of his cabinet,\r\ntwo months before the meeting of Congress, without the slightest\r\npossible pretence of the urgency of the measure. _I will take the\r\nresponsibility_, he said. The Secretary of the Treasury refused to\r\nexecute the order, because he considered it a fatal abuse of power, and\r\nhe was dismissed. The majority of the House of Representatives, and in\r\nthe last elections, of the people, have sanctioned those dictatorial\r\nacts. General Jackson has, indeed, lost most of his friends in the\r\nenlightened classes and among the merchants, but he cares little for\r\nindividuals, however distinguished; by virtue of universal suffrage, it\r\nis numbers that rule here.\r\n\r\nWill the bold policy by which he carried the multitude against the\r\nBank, be as successful now that he attempts to edge them on against\r\nFrance? It may be compared to one of those feats of strength, in which\r\none may succeed the first and even the second time, but will break his\r\nback the third. General Jackson may be considered to possess that sort\r\nof popularity which is irresistible for a short time; but the duration\r\nand solidity of which are in the inverse ratio of its intensity and\r\nbrilliancy; this, however, is a mere conjecture. One thing is certain,\r\nthat the General has the majority in the House of Representatives,\r\nand from what is known of the composition of the next Congress, there\r\nis every appearance that he will keep it during the term of his\r\nPresidency; whilst the Opposition, which now has the majority in the\r\nSenate, may lose it after the present session. Besides, it is not plain\r\nto me, that the Opposition will be unanimous in censuring the measures\r\nof General Jackson in regard to France. The opponents of General\r\nJackson, as well as his friends, are obliged to court their common\r\nsovereign, the people. Now in all countries the multitude are very far\r\nfrom being cosmopolites; their patriotism is more lively and warm, but\r\nit is also more brutal, more unjust, and more arrogant, than that of\r\nthe higher classes. In France, they cry with enthusiasm, _Our country\r\nbefore all things!_ Here the word is, _Our country, right or wrong!_\r\nwhich is the perfection of national selfishness.\r\n\r\nAs General Jackson is not, however, a madman or a fool, it is difficult\r\nto imagine, that he wishes the United States to pass at once from a\r\nclose friendship to a state of hostility with France. If he thinks\r\nthat France has exceeded all reasonable bounds of delay, that she has\r\nexhausted all the patience she had a right to expect from an old ally,\r\nfrom a nation whose independence was bought with our blood and our\r\ntreasure, why is he not content with proposing measures of commercial\r\nrestriction? A duty upon our goods would also be a means of paying\r\nthe twentyfive millions. He knows, that, if France has more to lose\r\nthan the United States in a war of tariffs, the United States, whose\r\ncommerce and navigation are much more extensive than ours, have more\r\nto lose in a war of cannon, of which the sea would naturally be the\r\ntheatre. But which class in the United States will suffer most by a\r\nwar? The commercial, certainly. Who own the vessels and the goods? Oh!\r\nthe merchants and ship-owners who vote against the General and his\r\nfriends, his adversaries whom he detests and despises; the traders\r\nof Boston, who beheaded his statue on the bows of the Constitution\r\nfrigate; those of New York, who have had caricature medals struck at\r\nBirmingham, holding up his government to hatred and contempt; the\r\ncapitalists of Philadelphia, friends of Mr Biddle and admirers of Mr\r\nClay. General Jackson troubles himself very little about the interest\r\nof such fellows as these.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, an increase of the customs duties, whatever should\r\nbe the motive of it, would be particularly hurtful to the Southern\r\nStates, and would be very unwelcome to them. As it is the South that\r\nproduces cotton, the principal article of export from the United States\r\nto France, the reprisals which the French government would not fail to\r\nmake, would fall chiefly upon the South. Now the democratic party at\r\npresent needs the support of the South, and is courting Virginia in\r\nparticular, the most influential of the Southern States. The success\r\nof the plans of the democratic party, that is to say, the election of\r\nMr Van Buren to the presidency, depends much upon the attitude taken\r\nby Virginia, not in 1836, the year of the election, but the present\r\nyear, not tomorrow but to-day. Public opinion is yet undecided in\r\nVirginia; it is desirable, at any price, to prevent it from leaning in\r\nany degree to the side of the Opposition, and it is well understood\r\nthat Virginia will not consent to laying any especial burdens on the\r\nSouth. The Virginia legislature is now in session, and one of its\r\nfirst acts will be the choice of a Senator in Congress. If Mr Leigh,\r\nthe present Senator, is chosen, then it will be committed in favour of\r\nthe Opposition, and perhaps lost to the democratic party. The loss of\r\nthe legislature may involve that of the State; the loss of Virginia\r\nmay involve that of the South. Considerations of this kind have much\r\nmore weight here than would be imagined in Europe. In the midst of the\r\nchanging institutions of this country, politicians live only from hand\r\nto mouth.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that European governments are clogged in their\r\nforeign policy by domestic difficulties. General Jackson would have\r\nbeen more cautious, if he had not thought that such is the position of\r\nthe French government at this moment. But be assured, that he also has\r\nhis domestic embarrassments, which affect his measures. This is more\r\npeculiarly the case with him than with any other President, because he\r\nis more a man of party, more entangled in party meshes, than any of his\r\npredecessors. Congressional intrigues and sectional interests create\r\nthe same difficulties here, particularly for an administration like\r\nhis, which amongst us result from an ill-balanced population, and the\r\nburden of the past. The French government may be confident of this, and\r\nought to act conformably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC OPINION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LOUISVILLE, DECEMBER 22, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe first impression produced in the United States by General Jackson's\r\nMessage, was astonishment, as the tone was wholly unexpected to every\r\none. In Europe, I suppose that it will have excited more than surprise,\r\nand it will be a matter of wonder, how a measure so rash and reckless\r\ncould have emanated from a government, which, from its origin, has\r\nbeen characterised by address and prudence. I have already attempted\r\nto give an explanation of this mystery, and I have stated, that this\r\n_quasi_ declaration of war was altogether an individual affair of\r\nGeneral Jackson, that in this, as in every thing else, he has acted\r\nfrom his own impulse. The enlightened statesmen, who surrounded him\r\nin the beginning of his government, and whose wise counsels repressed\r\nhis ardour, no longer have any influence. One after another has been\r\nseparated from him, and several, such as Mr Calhoun, who, during his\r\nfirst term, was Vice-President, are now become his irreconcileable\r\nenemies. His position, as the head of the democratic party, obliges\r\nhim, therefore, to supply some fuel for the furious passions, which the\r\nlate contests had kindled.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to judge of the reception of a document of this\r\ncharacter in this country, by what would take place under similar\r\ncircumstances in Europe. Public opinion has not the same arbiters here\r\nas in European societies; what is called public opinion in Europe, is\r\nthe generally current opinion among the middling and higher classes,\r\nthat of the merchants, manufacturers, men of letters, and statesmen,\r\nof those who, having inherited a competency, devote their time to\r\nstudy, the fine arts, and, unfortunately too often, to idleness. These\r\nare the persons, who govern public opinion in Europe, who have seats\r\nin the chambers, fill public offices, and manage or direct the most\r\npowerful organs of the press. They are the polite and cultivated,\r\nwho are accustomed to self-control, more inclined to scepticism than\r\nfanaticism, and on their guard against the impulses of enthusiasm;\r\nto whose feelings all violence is repugnant, all rudeness and all\r\nbrutality offensive; who cherish moderation often even to excess, and\r\nprefer compromises and half-measures. Among persons like these, General\r\nJackson's message would have met with universal condemnation, or rather\r\nif General Jackson had derived his ideas from such a medium, he would\r\nnever have dictated such a message.\r\n\r\nThe minority, which in Europe decides public opinion, and by this means\r\nis sovereign, is here deposed, and having been successively driven\r\nfrom post to post, has come to influence opinion only in a few saloons\r\nin the large cities, and to be itself under as strict guardianship as\r\nminors, women, and idiots. Until the accession of General Jackson,\r\nit had, however, exercised some influence over all the Presidents,\r\nwho were generally scholars, and all of whom, aside from their party\r\nconnections, were attached to it by family and social relations, and\r\nby their habits of life. Up to the present time, this class had also\r\npreserved some influence over the two houses; but it has now completely\r\nbroken with the President, or rather the President has broken with it;\r\nit has no longer any credit, except with one of the Houses, because\r\nthe Senate still consists of men whom it may claim as belonging to it\r\nby their superior intelligence, education, and property. The democracy\r\ndoes not fail, therefore, to stigmatise the Senate as an aristocratic\r\nbody, and to call it the House of Lords. The mass, which in Europe\r\nbears the pack and receives the law, has here put the pack on the back\r\nof the enlightened and cultivated class, which among us on the other\r\nhand, has the upper hand. The farmer and the mechanic are the lords of\r\nthe New World; public opinion is _their_ opinion; the public will is\r\n_their_ will; the President is _their_ choice, _their_ agent, _their_\r\nservant. If it is true that the depositaries of power in Europe have\r\nbeen too much disposed to use it in promoting their own interests,\r\nwithout consulting the wishes and the welfare of the mass beneath them,\r\nit is no less true that the classes which wield the sceptre in America\r\nare equally tainted with selfishness, and that they take less pains to\r\ndisguise it. In a word, North America is Europe with its head down and\r\nits feet up. European society, in London and Paris as well as at St.\r\nPetersburg, in the Swiss republic as well as in the Austrian empire, is\r\naristocratical in this sense, that, even after all the great changes\r\nof the last fifty years, it is still founded more or less absolutely\r\non the principle of inequality or a difference of ranks. American\r\nsociety is essentially and radically a democracy, not in name merely\r\nbut in deed. In the United States the democratic spirit is infused into\r\nall the national habits, and all the customs of society; it besets\r\nand startles at every step the foreigner, who, before landing in the\r\ncountry, had no suspicion to what a degree every nerve and fibre had\r\nbeen steeped in aristocracy by a European education. It has effaced all\r\ndistinctions, except that of colour; for here a shade in the hue of the\r\nskin separates men more widely than in any other country in the world.\r\nIt pervades all places, one only excepted, and that the very one which\r\nin Catholic Europe is consecrated to equality, the church; here all\r\nwhites are equal, every where, except in the presence of Him, in whose\r\neyes, the distinctions of this world are vanity and nothingness.[AW]\r\nStrange inconsistency! Or rather solemn protest, attesting that the\r\nprinciple of rank is firmly seated in the human heart by the side of\r\nthe principle of equality, that it must have its place in all countries\r\nand under all circumstances!\r\n\r\nDemocracy everywhere has no soft words, no suppleness of forms; it has\r\nlittle address, little of management; it is apt to confound moderation\r\nwith weakness, violence with heroism. Little used to self-control, it\r\ngives itself unreservedly to its friends, and sets them up as idols to\r\nwhom it burns incense; it utters its indignation and its suspicions\r\nagainst those of whom it thinks that it has cause for complaint,\r\nrudely, and in a tone of anger and menace. It is intolerant towards\r\nforeign nations; the American democracy in particular, bred up in the\r\nbelief that the nations of Europe groan ignobly under the yoke of\r\nabsolute despots, looks upon them with a mixture of pity and contempt.\r\nWhen it throws a glance beyond the Atlantic, it affects the superior\r\nair of a freeman looking upon a herd of slaves. Its pride kindles at\r\nthe idea of humbling the monarchical principle in the person of the\r\n\"tyrants who tread Europe under foot.\"\r\n\r\nIt may, then, be expected, that public opinion here will approve the\r\nMessage, both as to its manner and matter, that it will consider it\r\nfull of moderation and propriety. It is probable, that most of the\r\nmen and the journals of the Opposition will fear to censure it openly\r\nand boldly. Not that the Jackson men themselves are unanimous in its\r\nfavour; but that the speakers and writers of the Opposition consider\r\nthemselves and are, bound to pay homage to the sovereign people,\r\nthat they are all obliged to court the multitude, which is not very\r\nmanageable in regard to points of national dignity and vanity. A\r\ncertain number of journals and of political men have expressed their\r\nviews as to the occasion and the consequences of a declaration of war\r\nwith independence, and have been able to reconcile their patriotism\r\nwith a lofty courtesy toward the oldest and the most faithful ally of\r\nAmerica; but these are exceptions to the general rule. Some of the\r\nbest informed and most influential of the Opposition journals have,\r\nto the general astonishment, suddenly turned right-about-face, and\r\nwelcomed the part of the Message relative to France with acclamations.\r\nThus they appear more democratic than the democracy, furious upon a\r\npoint of honour, ready to sacrifice every thing in order to obtain\r\nredress for an outrage, to which, after twenty years, they have now\r\nfirst become sensible. He, who yesterday was a peaceful and reasonable\r\nwriter, is to-day a thunderbolt of war, can talk of nothing but the\r\nviolated national dignity, thinks only of blowing up the flame. The\r\ncause of this sudden change is this; if the United States were at\r\nwar, they would spend a great deal of money, and a Bank then would be\r\nindispensable to the Federal government. Now _a_ Bank and _the_ Bank\r\nis at bottom all one. This is what is called policy, cleverness, but\r\nit remains to be seen if the democratic party will be the dupe of such\r\narts, and if those who are most interested in the existence of the\r\nBank, that is, the merchants of New York, Boston, and New Orleans, and\r\neven those of Philadelphia, wish to have a Bank at any price.\r\n\r\nHappily for the peace of the world, the majority of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States consists of men eminent for their experience, their\r\nability, and their patriotism, who judge the interests of their country\r\non grounds of high policy, and who, among other questions, will not\r\nfail to consider this; whether it would not be the worst of all means\r\nof securing the liberty of the seas, an object which they have at\r\nheart, for the French and American navies to destroy each other. They\r\ndo not hesitate, when circumstances require it, to take a stand above\r\nthe demands of an ephemeral popularity, and to meet the difficulties\r\nface to face. A handful of firm and eloquent men in this illustrious\r\nassembly, was sufficient last winter to sustain the shock of the\r\npopular masses, and to check and bear them back. The Senate has only to\r\ncontinue equal to itself, to deserve well of its country and of mankind.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AW] In Roman Catholic countries, the churches, vast structures, are\r\nopen to all without distinction; each takes his seat where he pleases;\r\nall ranks are confounded. In the United States the churches are very\r\nnumerous and very small, being built by joint-stock companies. They\r\nare appropriated to the exclusive use of the proprietors, with the\r\nexception of one free-seat for the poor, each one's share of property\r\nbeing designated by an enclosed space or a pew. The whole floor of the\r\nchurch is thus occupied by pews, and the gallery is generally divided\r\nin the same manner, though a part of the latter is generally open and\r\nfree to all. Each pew is sold and transferred like any other property;\r\nthe price varies according to the town, the sect, or the situation.\r\nThe proprietors pay an annual tax for the support of public worship,\r\nlighting, and warming the church, and the minister's salary, the amount\r\nof the tax being proportioned to the value of the pew. Sometimes the\r\nchurch itself owns the pews, and the rent covers the expenses of the\r\npublic worship. According to this system, the place occupied by the\r\nworshippers depends on their wealth, or, at least, on the price they\r\nare able or willing to pay for their pews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MEMPHIS, (TENN.), JAN. 1, 1835.\r\n\r\nCincinnati has been made famous by Mrs Trollope, whose aristocratic\r\nfeelings were offended by the pork-trade, which is here carried on\r\non a great scale. From her accounts many persons have thought that\r\nevery body in Cincinnati was a pork merchant, and the city a mere\r\nslaughter-house. The fact is that Cincinnati is a large and beautiful\r\ntown, charmingly situated in one of those bends which the Ohio makes,\r\nas if unwilling to leave the spot. The hills which border the _Belle\r\nRivière_ (Beautiful River, the French name of the Ohio) through its\r\nwhole course, seem here to have receded from the river bank, in order\r\nto form a lofty plain, to which they serve as walls, whenever the Ohio\r\ndoes not serve as a foss, and on which man might build a town above\r\nthe reach of the terrible floods of the river. Geologists, who have\r\nno faith in the favours of the fabled Oreads, will merely attribute\r\nthis table-land to the washing away of the mountains, in the diluvian\r\nperiod, by the River Licking, now a modest little stream, which,\r\ndescending from the highlands of Kentucky, empties itself into the Ohio\r\nopposite Cincinnati. However this may be, there is not, in the whole\r\ncourse of the river, a single spot which offers such attractions to the\r\nfounders of a town.\r\n\r\nThe architectural appearance of Cincinnati is very nearly the same with\r\nthat of the new quarters of the English towns. The houses are generally\r\nof brick, most commonly three stories high, with the windows shining\r\nwith cleanliness, calculated each for a single family, and regularly\r\nplaced along well paved and spacious streets, sixty feet in width.\r\nHere and there the prevailing uniformity is interrupted by some more\r\nimposing edifice, and there are some houses of hewn stone in very good\r\ntaste, real palaces in miniature, with neat porticoes, inhabited by the\r\naristocratical portion of Mrs Trollope's hog-merchants, and several\r\nvery pretty mansions surrounded with gardens and terraces. Then there\r\nare the common school-houses, where girls and boys together learn\r\nreading, writing, cyphering, and geography, under the simultaneous\r\ndirection of a master and mistress.[AX] In another direction you see a\r\nsmall, plain church, without sculpture or paintings, without coloured\r\nglass or gothic arches, but snug, well carpeted, and well-warmed by\r\nstoves. In Cincinnati, as everywhere else in the United States, there\r\nis a great number of churches; each sect has its own, from Anglican\r\nEpiscopalianism, which enlists under its banner the wealth of the\r\ncountry, to the Baptist and Methodist sects, the religion of the\r\nlabourers and negroes. On another side, stands a huge hotel, which\r\nfrom its exterior you would take for a royal residence, but in which,\r\nas I can testify, you will not experience a princely hospitality; or a\r\nmuseum, which is merely a private speculation, as all American museums\r\nare, and which consists of some few crystals, some mammoth-bones, which\r\nare very abundant in the United States, an Egyptian mummy, some Indian\r\nweapons and dresses, and a half-dozen wax-figures, representing, for\r\ninstance, Washington, General Jackson, and the Indian Chiefs, Black\r\nHawk and Tecumseh, a figure of Napoleon afoot or on horseback, a French\r\ncuirass from Waterloo, a collection of portraits of distinguished\r\nAmericans, comprising Lafayette and some of the leading men of the\r\ntown, another of stuffed birds, snakes preserved in spirits, and\r\nparticularly a large living snake, a boa constrictor, or an anaconda.\r\nOne of these museums in Cincinnati is remarkable for its collection of\r\nIndian antiquities, derived from the huge caves of Kentucky, or from\r\nthe numerous mounds on the banks of the Ohio, of which there were\r\nseveral on the site of Cincinnati.[AY]\r\n\r\nAs for the banks they are modestly lodged at Cincinnati, but a plan of\r\na handsome edifice, worthy of their high fortune, and sufficient to\r\naccommodate them all, is at present under consideration. The founderies\r\nfor casting steam-engines, the yards for building steamboats, the\r\nnoisy, unwholesome, or unpleasant workshops, are in the adjoining\r\nvillage of Fulton, in Covington or Newport on the Kentucky bank of the\r\nriver, or in the country. As to the enormous slaughter of hogs, about\r\n150,000 annually, and the preparation of the lard, which follows, the\r\ntown is not in the least incommoded by it; the whole process takes\r\nplace on the banks of a little stream called Deer Creek, which has\r\nreceived the nickname of the Bloody Run, from the colour of its waters\r\nduring the season of the massacre, or near the basins of the great\r\ncanal, which extends from Cincinnati towards the Maumee of Lake Erie.\r\nCincinnati has, however, no squares planted with trees in the English\r\ntaste, no parks nor walks, no fountains, although it would be very\r\neasy to have them. It is necessary to wait for the ornamental, until\r\nthe taste for it prevails among the inhabitants; at present the useful\r\noccupies all thoughts. Besides, all improvements require an increase of\r\ntaxes, and in the United States it is not easy to persuade the people\r\nto submit to this. (See _Note 20_.) Cincinnati also stands in need of\r\nsome public provision for lighting the streets, which this repugnance\r\nto taxes has hitherto prevented.\r\n\r\nCincinnati has had water-works, for supplying the inhabitants with\r\nwater, for about 20 years; for an annual rate, which amounts to about\r\n8 or 12 dollars for a family, each has a quantity amply sufficient\r\nfor all its wants. A steam-engine on the banks of the river raises\r\nthe water to a reservoir on one of the hills near the city, 300 feet\r\nhigh, whence it is conducted in iron pipes in every direction. The\r\nheight of the reservoir is such that the water rises to the top of\r\nevery house, and fire-plugs are placed at intervals along the streets\r\nto supply the engines in case of fire. Several of the new towns in\r\nthe United States have water-works, and Philadelphia, among the older\r\ncities, has an admirable system of works, which, owing to a series of\r\nunsuccessful experiments, have cost a large sum.[AZ] At this moment,\r\na plan for supplying Boston with water is under discussion, which\r\nwill cost several millions, because the water must be brought from a\r\ndistance. New York is also engaged in a similar work, the expense of\r\nwhich will be about five millions. The Cincinnati water-works have\r\nnot cost much above 150,000 dollars, although they have been several\r\ntimes completely reconstructed. It is generally thought in the United\r\nStates, that the water-works ought to be owned by the towns, but those\r\nin Cincinnati belong to a company, and the water-rate is, therefore,\r\nhigher than in Philadelphia and Pittsburg. The city has three times\r\nbeen in negotiation for the purchase of the works, and has always\r\ndeclined buying on advantageous terms; the first time the establishment\r\nwas offered for 35,000 dollars, and the second time for 80,000; the\r\nthird time, 125,000 dollars were demanded, and 300,000 or 400,000 will\r\nfinally be paid for it. In this case, as in regard to lighting the\r\nstreets, the principal cause of the refusal of the city to buy was the\r\nunwillingness to lay new taxes.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Cincinnati as it is approached from the water, is\r\nimposing, and it is still more so when it is viewed from one of the\r\nneighbouring hills. The eye takes in the windings of the Ohio and\r\nthe course of the Licking, which enters the former at right angles,\r\nthe steamboats that fill the port, the basin of the Miami canal,\r\nwith the warehouses that line it and the locks that connect it with\r\nthe river, the white-washed spinning works of Newport and Covington\r\nwith their tall chimneys, the Federal arsenal, above which floats the\r\nstarry banner, and the numerous wooden spires that crown the churches.\r\nOn all sides the view is terminated by ranges of hills, forming an\r\namphitheatre yet covered with the vigourous growth of the primitive\r\nforest. This rich verdure is here and there interrupted by country\r\nhouses surrounded by colonnades, which are furnished by the forest.\r\nThe population which occupies this amphitheatre, lives in the midst of\r\nplenty; it is industrious, sober, frugal, thirsting after knowledge,\r\nand if, with a very few exceptions, it is entirely a stranger to the\r\ndelicate pleasures and elegant manners of the refined society of our\r\nEuropean capitals, it is equally ignorant of its vices, dissipation,\r\nand follies.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance one does not perceive any difference between the\r\nright and left bank of the river; from a distance, the prosperity of\r\nCincinnati seems to extend to the opposite shore. This is an illusion;\r\non the right bank, that is, in Ohio, there are none but freemen;\r\nslavery exists on the other side. You may descend the river hundreds of\r\nmiles, with slavery on the left and liberty on the right, although it\r\nis the same soil, and equally capable of being cultivated by the white\r\nman. When you enter the Mississippi you have slavery on both sides of\r\nyou. A blind carelessness, or rather a fatal weakness in the rulers,\r\nand a deplorable selfishness in the people, have allowed this plague\r\nto become fixed in a country where there was no need of tolerating its\r\nexistence. Who can tell when and how, and through what sufferings, it\r\nwill be possible to eradicate it?\r\n\r\nI met with one incident in Cincinnati, which I shall long remember.\r\nI had observed at the hotel table a man of about the medium height,\r\nstout and muscular, and of about the age of sixty years, yet with the\r\nactive step and lively air of youth. I had been struck with his open\r\nand cheerful expression, the amenity of his manners, and a certain\r\nair of command, which appeared through his plain dress. \"That is,\"\r\nsaid my friend, \"General Harrison, clerk of the Cincinnati Court of\r\nCommon Pleas\"--\"What! General Harrison of the Tippecanoe and the\r\nThames?\" \"The same; the ex-general, the conqueror of Tecumseh and\r\nProctor; the avenger of our disasters on the Raisin and at Detroit;\r\nthe ex-governor of the Territory of Indiana, the ex-senator in\r\nCongress, the ex-minister of the United States to one of the South\r\nAmerican republics. He has grown old in the service of his country,\r\nhe has passed twenty years of his life in those fierce wars with the\r\nIndians, in which there was less glory to be won, but more dangers to\r\nbe encountered, than at Rivoli and Austerlitz. He is now poor, with\r\na numerous family, neglected by the Federal government, although yet\r\nvigourous, because he has the independence to think for himself. As\r\nthe Opposition is in the majority here, his friends have bethought\r\nthemselves of coming to his relief by removing the clerk of the court\r\nof Common Pleas, who was a Jackson man, and giving him the place, which\r\nis a lucrative one, as a sort of retiring pension. His friends in the\r\nEast talk of making him President of the United States. Meanwhile we\r\nhave made him clerk of an inferior court.\" After a pause my informant\r\nadded, \"At this wretched table you may see another candidate for the\r\npresidency, who seems to have a better chance than General Harrison; it\r\nis Mr McLean, now one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nExamples of this abandonment of men, whose career has been in the\r\nhighest degree honourable, are not rare in the United States. I had\r\nalready seen the illustrious Gallatin at New York, who, after having\r\ngrown old in the service of the republic, after having been for forty\r\nyears a legislator, a member of the cabinet, a minister abroad,\r\nafter having taken an active part in every wise and good measure of\r\nthe Federal government, was dismissed without any provision, and\r\nwould have terminated his laborious career in poverty, had not his\r\nfriends offered him the place of president of one of the banks in\r\nNew York. The distress of President Jefferson in his old age is well\r\nknown, and that he was reduced to the necessity of asking permission\r\nof the Virginia legislature to dispose of his estate by lottery;\r\nwhile President Monroe, still more destitute, after having spent his\r\npatrimony in the service of the State, was constrained to implore the\r\ncompassion of Congress; and these are the men to whom their country\r\nowes the invaluable acquisitions of Louisiana and Florida. The system\r\nof retiring pensions is unknown in the United States. No provision is\r\nmade for the old age of eminent men who accept the highest offices in\r\nthe State, although it is impossible for them to lay up anything out of\r\ntheir comparatively moderate salaries, and several of them have seen\r\ntheir fortunes disappear with their health in the public service. The\r\npublic functionaries are treated like menial servants; the system of\r\ndomestic life is such in the United States, that every American, in\r\nprivate life, treats the humblest of his white domestics with more\r\nrespect, than most of them show, in public life, to officers of the\r\nhighest rank. On every occasion and in a thousand forms, the latter\r\nare reminded, that they are nothing but dust, and that a frown of the\r\npeople can annihilate them.\r\n\r\nThis treatment of their public officers by the Americans is the\r\nmathematical consequence of the principle of popular sovereignty;\r\nbut I consider it as consistent neither with reason nor justice. If\r\nit is true, that nations have an imprescriptible right to regulate\r\nthe conduct of the depositaries of power conformably to their own\r\ninterests, it is equally true, that men of superior abilities and worth\r\nhave a natural and sacred right to be invested with high powers and\r\nfunctions. If it is criminal to sport with the welfare of the mass, it\r\nis no less so to trample under foot the wise and good. And if those\r\nwhom talents and zeal for the public good call to important posts, are\r\nrepulsed by the prospect of ingratitude and contempt, to what hands\r\nshall the care of the commonwealth be confided? What will then be the\r\nfate of the sovereign people? There is no less despotism in a people,\r\nwho, impatient of all superiority, repays the services of illustrious\r\ncitizens only with neglect, and capriciously throws them aside, like so\r\nmuch garbage, than in an Asiatic prince, who reduces all to the same\r\nlevel of servitude, treats all with the same insolence and brutality,\r\nand considers virtue and genius overpaid by the honour of being\r\npermitted to kneel on the steps of his throne.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the prevailing ideas on the subject of offices\r\nand officers, no sort of provision has been made for the protection\r\nof the latter. They are removeable without any kind of pretence or\r\nformality, without being informed of the ground of their removal, and\r\nwithout any reason being given to the public. In this way a terrible\r\nrod of tyranny hangs over them, although under the mild and moderate\r\nadministration of former Presidents little use was made of it; but,\r\nsince the accession of General Jackson, a regular system of removal\r\nfrom office has been sanctioned, and office has become the reward of\r\nparty-services; it has been publicly declared, that the _spoils of\r\nvictory belong to the conquerors_. President Jackson has filled all\r\nthe custom-houses and post offices with his creatures, and this policy\r\nhas gained over some States, counties, and towns; at every change of\r\nopinion, the State changes its executive officers; the legislators\r\nchange their secretaries, printers, and even their messengers; the\r\ncourts, their clerks; the towns, their treasurers, their inspectors of\r\nmarkets, weights and measures, and even their scavengers and watchmen.\r\nMen in office now understand, that the preservation of their places and\r\nthe bread of their families are hazarded at every municipal, State,\r\nor Federal election, according as they hold of the town, State, or\r\ngeneral government. Formerly they took no part in election manoeuvres,\r\nthe Presidents having expressly forbidden the officers of the Federal\r\ngovernment to meddle with them; at present, they are the most active\r\nagents in them. The President has now at his command an army of 60,000\r\nvoters,[BA] dependent on his will, whose interests are bound up in\r\nhis, and who are his forlorn hope. So true is it that extremes meet,\r\nand that, by pushing to excess a single principle, however true, we\r\nshall come to conclusions, which, practically speaking, amount to the\r\noverthrow of the principle itself. Thus by drawing out too fine the\r\nprinciple of the popular sovereignty, we may come nearer and nearer\r\nto tyranny and the oppression of the people. Is not this a proof that\r\nlogic is not always reason, and that truth is often, if not always,\r\nto be found in the harmonious combinations of seemingly contradictory\r\nprinciples?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[AX] According to the official report of the Trustees and visitors of\r\nthe common schools, dated July 30, 1833, there were then in Cincinnati\r\n6,000 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years, exclusive of 230\r\nchildren of colour for whom there is a separate school. About 2,300\r\nchildren attended the common schools and 1,700 private schools. The\r\nnumber of common schools is 18, under the care of 12 masters and 5\r\nassistants, 6 mistresses and 7 assistant mistresses. The masters\r\nreceive 400 dollars a year, and the assistants 250; the school\r\nmistresses 216, and the assistants 168. These salaries are thought to\r\nbe too low.\r\n\r\n[AY] This museum has one show which I never saw anywhere else; it is a\r\nrepresentation of the Infernal Regions, to which the young Cincinnati\r\ngirls resort in quest of that excitement which a comfortable and\r\npeaceful, but cold and monotonous manner of life denies them. This\r\nstrange spectacle seems to afford a delicious agitation to their\r\nnerves, and is the principal source of revenue to the museum.\r\n\r\n[AZ] The water used in Philadelphia is supplied by the Schuylkill,\r\na fall in which is made to drive the pumps, by which the reservoirs\r\nare filled. The Fairmount works are arranged and ornamented with much\r\ntaste, and at very little expense; the ornamental part, strictly\r\nspeaking, merely consists of some lawns, wooden balustrades, and two\r\nwretched statues; yet the effect is very elegant.\r\n\r\n[BA] In a report on executive patronage lately made to the Senate by Mr\r\nCalhoun, the following statement of the number of persons employed by\r\nthe Federal government is given:\r\n\r\n  Administrative and financial agents  12,144  Naval affairs  6,499\r\n  Military Service and Indian affairs   9,643  Post Office   31,917\r\n                                                             ------\r\n                                            Total            60,203\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NATCHEZ, (MISS.) JAN. 4, 1835.\r\n\r\nCincinnati contains about 40,000 inhabitants, inclusive of the\r\nadjoining villages; although founded 40 years ago, its rapid growth\r\ndates only about 30 years back. It seems to be the rendezvous of all\r\nnations; the Germans and Irish are very numerous, and there are some\r\nAlsacians; I have often heard the harsh accents of the Rhenish French\r\nin the streets. But the bulk of the population, which gives its tone\r\nto all the rest, is of New England origin. What makes the progress of\r\nCincinnati more surprising is, that the city is the daughter of its own\r\nworks. Other towns, which have sprung up in the United States in the\r\nsame rapid manner, have been built on shares, so to speak. Lowell, for\r\nexample, is an enterprise of Boston merchants, who, after having raised\r\nthe necessary funds, have collected workmen and told them, \"Build us a\r\ntown.\" Cincinnati has been gradually extended and embellished, almost\r\nwholly without foreign aid, by its inhabitants, who have for the most\r\npart arrived on the spot poor. The founders of Cincinnati brought with\r\nthem nothing but sharp-sighted, wakeful, untiring industry, the only\r\npatrimony which they inherited from their New England fathers, and the\r\nother inhabitants have scrupulously followed their example and adopted\r\ntheir habits. They seem to have chosen Franklin for their patron-saint,\r\nand to have adopted Poor Richard's maxims as a fifth gospel.\r\n\r\nI have said that Cincinnati was admirably situated; this is true in\r\nrespect of its geographical position, but, if you follow the courses\r\nof the rivers on the map, and consider the natural resources of the\r\ndistrict, you will find that there are several points on the long line\r\nof the rivers of the West as advantageously placed, both for trade and\r\nmanufactures, and that there are some which are even more favoured\r\nin these respects. Pittsburg, which has within reach both coal and\r\niron, that is to say, the daily bread of industry, which stands at\r\nthe head of the Ohio, at the starting point of steam-navigation, at\r\nthe confluence of the Monongahela and the Alleghany, coming the one\r\nfrom the south and the other from the north; Pittsburg, which is near\r\nthe great chain of lakes, appears as the pivot of a vast system of\r\nroads, railroads, and canals, several of which are already completed.\r\nPittsburg was marked out by nature at once for a great manufacturing\r\ncentre and a great mart of trade. Louisville, built at the falls of the\r\nOhio, at the head of navigation for the largest class of boats, is a\r\nnatural medium between the commerce of the upper Ohio and that of the\r\nMississippi and its tributaries. In respect to manufacturing resources,\r\nLouisville is as well provided as Cincinnati, and the latter, setting\r\naside its enchanting situation, seemed destined merely to become the\r\nmarket of the fertile strip between the Great and Little Miami.\r\n\r\nBut the power of men, when they agree in willing anything and in\r\nwilling it perseveringly, is sufficient to overbear and conquer that\r\nof nature. In spite of the superior advantages of Louisville as an\r\n_entrepôt_, in spite of the manufacturing resources of Pittsburg,\r\nCincinnati is able to maintain a population twice that of Louisville\r\nand half as large again as that of Pittsburg in a state of competence,\r\nwhich equals, if it does not surpass, the average condition of that\r\nof each of the others. The inhabitants of Cincinnati have fixed this\r\nprosperity among them, by one of those instinctive views with which\r\nthe sons of New England are inspired by their eminently practical and\r\ncalculating genius. A half-word, they say, is enough for the wise, but\r\ncleverer than the wisest, the Yankees understand each other without\r\nspeaking, and by a tacit consent direct their common efforts toward the\r\nsame point. To work Boston fashion means, in the United States, to do\r\nanything with perfect precision and without words. The object which the\r\nCincinnatians have had in view, almost from the origin of their city,\r\nhas been nothing less than to make it the capital, or great interior\r\nmart of the West. The indirect, means which they have employed, have\r\nbeen to secure the manufacture of certain articles, which, though\r\nof little value separately considered, form an important aggregate\r\nwhen taken together, and getting the start of their neighbours, with\r\nthat spirit of diligence that characterises the Yankees, they have\r\naccordingly distributed the manufacture of these articles among\r\nthemselves. This plan has succeeded.\r\n\r\nThus with the exception of the pork trade, one is surprised not to\r\nsee any branch of industry carried on on the great scale of the\r\nmanufacturing towns of England and France. The Cincinnatians make\r\na variety of household furniture and utensils, agricultural and\r\nmechanical implements and machines, wooden clocks, and a thousand\r\nobjects of daily use and consumption, soap, candles, paper, leather,\r\n&c., for which there is an indefinite demand throughout the flourishing\r\nand rapidly growing States of the West, and also in the new States of\r\nthe Southwest, which are wholly devoted to agriculture, and in which,\r\non account of the existence of slavery, manufactures cannot be carried\r\non. Most of these articles are of ordinary quality; the furniture,\r\nfor instance, is rarely such as would be approved by Parisian taste,\r\nbut it is cheap and neat, just what is wanted in a new country,\r\nwhere, with the exception of a part of the South, there is a general\r\nease and but little wealth, and where plenty and comfort are more\r\ngenerally known than the little luxuries of a more refined society.\r\nThe prosperity of Cincinnati, therefore, rests upon the sure basis of\r\nthe prosperity of the West, upon the supply of articles of the first\r\nnecessity to the bulk of the community; a much more solid foundation\r\nthan the caprice of fashion, upon which, nevertheless, the branches\r\nof industry most in favour with us, depend. The intellectual also\r\nreceives a share of attention; in the first place, there is a large\r\ntype-foundery in Cincinnati, which supplies the demand of the whole\r\nWest, and of that army of newspapers that is printed in it. According\r\nto the usual English or American mode of proceeding, the place of human\r\nlabour is supplied as much as possible by machinery, and I have seen\r\nseveral little contrivances here, that are not probably to be found\r\nin the establishments of the Royal Press or of the Didots. Then the\r\nprinting-presses are numerous, and they issue nothing but publications\r\nin general demand, such as school-books, and religious books, and\r\nnewspapers. By means of this variety of manufactures, which, taken\r\nseparately appear of little consequence, Cincinnati has taken a stand,\r\nfrom which it will be very difficult to remove her, for, in this\r\nmatter, priority of occupation is no trifling advantage. The country\r\ntrader, who keeps an assortment of everything vendible, is sure to\r\nfind almost everything he wants in Cincinnati, and he, therefore, goes\r\nthither in preference to any other place in order to lay in his stock\r\nof goods. Cincinnati is thus in fact the great central mart of the\r\nWest; a great quantity and variety of produce and manufactured articles\r\nfind a vent here, notwithstanding the natural superiority of several\r\nother sites, either in regard to the extent of water-communication or\r\nmineral resources.\r\n\r\nM. Fourrier has characterised the spirit of the 19th century by the\r\nterm _industrial feudalism_. The human race, according to some, has\r\nthrown off one yoke only to bear another, less burdensome perhaps, but\r\nalso less noble. The warlike lords of the Middle Ages have passed away\r\nbut the industrial lords have come to take their place, the princes\r\nof manufactures, banks, and commerce. These new masters will embitter\r\nthe life of the poor with less distress and privation, but they will\r\nalso shed less glory upon it. They will increase the body's pittance,\r\nbut diminish the soul's. At the sight of the great manufactories of\r\nEngland and some of those of the European continent, of those which are\r\nmultiplying so rapidly in New England, in that wonderful creation the\r\ncity of Lowell, one is tempted to think that the industrial feudalism\r\nis already established in the former, and is creeping beneath the\r\ndemocratic institutions, like the snake under the grass, in the latter.\r\nThose who do not believe that the human race can go backward, and\r\nwho prefer to rock themselves in the cradle of hope, rather than to\r\nyield to flat despair, while they admit the existence of this tendency\r\nof the age, console themselves by the contemplation of its other\r\ncharacteristic features, at the head of which they place the general\r\nspirit of emancipation, which breaks down all obstacles in its way. If\r\nin England, for instance, there are, in the factories, a thousand germs\r\nof despotism, there are, in the working classes, a thousand germs of\r\nresistance, in the population a thousand germs of liberalism; there are\r\nTrades' Unions, there are radicals: neither of these opposite forces\r\nalone will decide the destinies of the future. From their opposing\r\nimpulses will result a single force, different from both, yet partaking\r\nof both. The force of emancipation will make what to some seems about\r\nto become feudalism, simply patronage.\r\n\r\nPatronage has not finished its career upon the earth; it will endure\r\nwhile Providence shall continue to cast men in different moulds; it\r\nwill subsist for the good of the weak and the poor, and for that of\r\nthe class of men, so numerous in southern Europe, for example, who\r\nrequire the support of somebody more powerful than themselves. But\r\nit will be modified in character, growing successively less and less\r\nviolent, and more and more mild. The inferior has been a slave, a serf,\r\na paid freeman; he may in time become an associate or partner without\r\nceasing to be an inferior. However this may be, there is no germ of\r\nindustrial feudalism in Cincinnati, there are no great factories or\r\nworkshops. Mechanical industry is subdivided there, pretty much as the\r\nsoil is amongst us; each head of a family, with his sons and some newly\r\narrived emigrants as assistants and servants, has his domain in this\r\ngreat field. Cincinnati is, therefore, as republican in its industrial\r\norganisation, as in its political. This subdivision of manufactures has\r\nhitherto been attended with no inconvenience, because in the vast West,\r\nwhose growth is visible to the eye, the production cannot at present\r\nkeep pace with the consumption. But how will it be in a century, or\r\nperhaps in fifty years? Will not the condition of mechanical industry\r\nundergo some great change, or rather will not the whole of this vast\r\nregion undergo a complete change of character and condition, which will\r\ninvolve a reorganisation of the industrial system?\r\n\r\nThe moral aspect of Cincinnati is delightful in the eyes of him who\r\nprefers work to every thing else, and with whom work can take the\r\nplace of every thing else. But whoever has a taste for pleasure and\r\ndisplay, whoever needs occasional relaxation from business, in gaiety\r\nand amusement, would find this beautiful city, with its picturesque\r\nenvirons, an insupportable residence. It would be still more so for\r\na man of leisure, desirous of devoting a large part of his time to\r\nthe cultivation of the fine arts and the rest to pleasure. For such\r\na man, indeed, it would not be possible to live here; he would find\r\nhimself denounced from political considerations, because men of leisure\r\nare looked upon in the United States as so many steppingstones to\r\naristocracy, and anathematised by religion, for the various sects,\r\nhowever much they may differ on other points, all agree in condemning\r\npleasure, luxury, gallantry, the fine arts themselves. Now the United\r\nStates are not like some countries in Europe, particularly France,\r\nwhere religion and the pulpit can be braved with impunity. Hemmed in\r\nby the laborious habits of the country, by political notions, and by\r\nreligion, a man must either resign himself to the same mode of life\r\nwith the mass, or seek a soil less unfriendly to his tastes in the\r\ngreat cities of New York, Philadelphia, or New Orleans, or even in\r\nEurope. There is, therefore, no such thing in Cincinnati as a class\r\nof men of leisure, living without any regular profession on their\r\npatrimony, or on the wealth acquired by their own enterprise in early\r\nlife, although there are many persons of opulence, having one hundred\r\nthousand dollars and upwards. I met a young man there, the future heir\r\nof a large fortune, who, after having been educated at West Point and\r\nreceived a commission, had retired from the service in order to live\r\nat home. Wearied out with his solitary leisure, burdened with the\r\nweight of his own person, he could find no other relief than to open a\r\nfancy-goods shop.\r\n\r\nEvery where in the United States where there are no slaves, and out\r\nof the large towns of the sea-coast, a strict watch is kept up in\r\nregard to persons of leisure, obliging those who might be seduced\r\nby a taste for this kind of life to fall into the ranks and work,\r\nat least until age makes repose necessary. Public opinion is on the\r\nlookout to banish any habits of dissipation, however innocent, that\r\nmight get a footing in society, and make a life of leisure tolerable.\r\nReligious and philanthropical societies, instituted under various\r\nnames, take upon themselves the task of enforcing the decrees of public\r\nopinion; like vigilant sentinels, they compel a rigid observance of\r\nthe austerities, or if you choose the _ennuis_, of Sunday, labour\r\nto suppress intemperance and gaming, the spirit of which, if once\r\ndiffused among a people so wholly devoted to money-making, might lead\r\nto the most fatal consequences. These societies and committees pursue\r\ntheir task with a more than British perseverance, and sometimes with\r\na puritanical fanaticism. When Mr John Quincy Adams became President,\r\nhe had a billiard-table placed in the President's House, and such is\r\nhere the real or affected abhorrence of every thing called a game,\r\nthat this billiard-table was actually one of the arguments against\r\nthe re-election of Mr Adams. \"It is a scandal, the abomination of\r\ndesolation,\" was the general cry. Mr Adams, whose private character is\r\nabove suspicion, was, if we must believe the Opposition journals of\r\nthe day, a teacher of immorality, because he had a billiard-table in\r\nhis house, and General Jackson has doubtless caused that scandalous\r\npiece of furniture to be broken up and burnt, since he has become\r\nmaster of the White House. Any where else this rigour would be called\r\nintolerance, inquisition; here it is submitted to without a murmur,\r\nand few persons are really annoyed by it, or show that they are. The\r\nAmerican can support a constant and unrelaxing devotion to labour;\r\nhe does not feel the need of amusement and recreation. The silence\r\nand retirement of his Sunday seem to be a more effectual relaxation\r\nfor him, than the noisy gaiety of our festivals; one might even say\r\nthat he was destitute of the sense of pleasure. All his faculties and\r\nenergies are admirably and vigourously combined for production; he\r\nwants those without which pleasure is not enjoyment, and amusement is\r\nbut a painful effort; and, between these two kinds of work, he would of\r\ncourse prefer that which is gainful, to that which is expensive.\r\n\r\nSuch a social organisation is the very best for a pioneer people.\r\nWithout this devotion to business, without this constant direction\r\nof the energies of the mind to useful enterprises, without this\r\nindifference to pleasure, without those political and religious\r\nnotions which imperiously repress all passions but those whose objects\r\nare business, production, and gain, can any one suppose that the\r\nAmericans would ever have achieved their great industrial conquests?\r\nWith any other less exclusive system, they would yet, perhaps, be\r\nmeditating the passage over the Alleghanies. Instead of having that\r\ngreat domain of the West, immense in its extent and resources, already\r\ncleared and cultivated, furrowed with roads and dotted over with\r\nfarms, they would probably be still confined to the sandy strip that\r\nborders the Atlantic. It must be allowed that this ardent and entire\r\ndevotion to business gives the nation a strange aspect in the eyes of\r\na European: And this explains the fact that the Americans have found\r\nso little favour with most foreigners who have visited their country.\r\nBut, in return, they are sure of the gratitude of that innumerable\r\nposterity for whom they are preparing with such energy and sagacity\r\nan abode of plenty, a land of promise. This posterity, it is said,\r\nwill change the habits of their fathers, will adopt new tastes, and\r\neven new institutions. So be it! It is of little consequence whether\r\nthe Americans of the 20th or 21st century, shall retain the national\r\ncharacter, customs, and laws of the Americans of the 19th. But the\r\nmore interesting consideration is, whether the Americans of our day\r\ndo not fulfil, as perfectly as human nature is capable of doing, the\r\nmission which Providence has entrusted to them, that of acting as a\r\nnation of pioneers and subduers of the forest; and if they do not\r\ndeserve to be excused, like all nations and individuals, for having the\r\ndefects inherent in their good qualities. The question thus stated will\r\nbe easily answered by every one who sets any value on the interests and\r\nwelfare of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.\r\n\r\nWESTERN STEAMBOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     NEW ORLEANS, JAN. 8, 1835.\r\n\r\nOne of the points in which modern society differs most from the\r\nancient, is, certainly, the facility of travelling. Formerly it was\r\npossible only for a patrician to travel; it was necessary to be rich\r\neven to travel like a philosopher. Merchants moved in caravans,\r\npaying tribute to the Bedoweens of the desert, to the Tartars of the\r\nsteppes, to the chieftains perched, like eagles, in castles built\r\nin the mountain passes. Instead of the English stage-coach, or the\r\npost-chaise, rattling at high speed over the paved road, they had the\r\nold Asiatic litter or palanquin, still preserved in Spanish America, or\r\nthe camel, the ship of the desert, or four bullocks yoked to the slow\r\nwagon, or for the common citizens or the iron warriors, the horse; and\r\ninstead of those sumptuous steam-packets, genuine floating palaces, the\r\nsmall and frail bark, pursued by robbers on the rivers and by pirates\r\nby sea, the sight of which extorted from the Epicurean Horace the\r\nexclamation of terror,\r\n\r\n    Illi robur et æs triplex--Circa pectus erat.\r\n\r\nThe roads were then rough and narrow paths, rendered dangerous by the\r\nviolence of men, or by the monsters of the forest, or by precipices. A\r\nlong train of luggage, provisions, servants, and guards, was necessary,\r\nand from time to time the traveller reposed himself with some\r\nhereditary friend of his family, for there were then no comfortable\r\nhotels, in which he can now procure all he needs for money, and command\r\nthe attentive services of officious attendants. If there were any place\r\nof shelter, it was some filthy den, like the caravanserais of the East,\r\nwretched, naked, and comfortless, where he found nothing but water and\r\na roof, or like the inns of Spain and South America, which are a happy\r\nmean between a caravanserai and a stable. The great bulk of mankind,\r\nslaves in fact and in name, were then attached to the glebe, chained to\r\nthe soil by the difficulty of locomotion.\r\n\r\nTo improve the means of communication, then, is to promote a real,\r\npositive, and practical liberty; it is to extend to all the members\r\nof the human family the power of traversing and turning to account\r\nthe globe, which has been given to them as their patrimony; it is to\r\nincrease the rights and privileges of the greatest number, as truly\r\nand as amply as could be done by electoral laws; I go further, it is\r\nto establish equality and democracy. The effect of the most perfect\r\nsystem of transportation is to reduce the distance not only between\r\ndifferent places, but between different classes. Where the rich and\r\nthe great travel only with a pompous retinue, while the poor man, who\r\ngoes to the next village, drags himself singly along in mud and sand,\r\nover rocks and through thickets, the word equality is a mockery and\r\na falsehood, and aristocracy stares you in the face. In India and\r\nChina, in the Mahometan countries, in half-Arabian Spain and her former\r\nAmerican colonies, it matters little whether the government is called\r\nrepublic, empire, or limited monarchy; the peasant and the labourer\r\ncannot there persuade himself that he is the equal of the soldier, the\r\nbrahmin, the mandarin, the pacha, or the noble, whose retinue runs over\r\nhim, or covers him with mud. Spite of himself, he is filled with awe\r\nat its approach, and servilely bends before it as it passes him. In\r\nGreat Britain, on the contrary, in spite of the wealth and the great\r\nprivileges of the nobility, the mechanic and the labourer, who can go\r\nto the office and get a ticket for the railroad cars, if they have a\r\nfew shillings in their pockets, and who have the right, if they will\r\npay for it, of sitting in the same vehicle, on the same seat with the\r\nbaronet or the peer and duke, feel their dignity as men, and touch, as\r\nit were, the fact, that there is not an impassable gulf between them\r\nand the nobility.\r\n\r\nThese considerations would make me slow to believe in the tyrannical\r\nprojects of a government which should devote itself zealously to the\r\ntask of opening roads through the country, and diminishing the time and\r\nexpense of transportation. Is it not true that ideas, as well as goods,\r\ncirculate along the great highways, the canals, and the rivers, and\r\nthat every travelling clerk is more or less a missionary? Those who are\r\npossessed with the retrograde spirit, are fully convinced of this fact;\r\nthey favour no projects of internal improvement; they fear an engineer\r\nalmost as much as they do a publisher of Voltaire. As it is undeniable\r\nthat one of the first railroads in Europe was constructed in the\r\nAustrian empire, as the imperial government has opened many fine roads\r\nfrom one end of its possessions to the other, and as it is encouraging\r\nthe introduction of steamboats on the Danube, I may venture to conclude\r\nthat Von Metternich deserves a better reputation than he enjoys, on\r\nthis side the Rhine. You know, on the other hand, that during the short\r\nministry of M. de Labourdonnaye, in 1829, the surveys and plans of\r\nvarious roads in Vendée disappeared from the archives, and have never\r\nsince been found. Only a few months ago, in Puebla, one of the free and\r\nsovereign States of the Mexican confederacy, which, however, enjoys a\r\nvery high reputation for ignorance and bigotry, the representatives\r\nof the people, animated with a holy wrath against those ruthless\r\nunbelievers (mostly foreigners), who have pushed the sacrilegious\r\nspirit of innovation so far as to set up a line of stage-coaches\r\nbetween Vera Cruz and Mexico, and to repair the great road between the\r\ntwo cities, imposed an annual tax of 135,000 dollars upon them, and\r\nprohibited their taking any tolls within the limits of the State.\r\n\r\nThere is a region where, by simply perfecting the means of\r\nwater-transportation, a revolution has been produced, the consequences\r\nof which on the balance of power in the New World are incalculable.\r\nIt is the great Valley of the Mississippi, which had, indeed, been\r\nconquered from the wild beasts and Red Skins previous to the invention\r\nof Fulton, but which, without the labours of his genius, would never\r\nhave been covered with rich and populous States. After the conquest\r\nof Canada had put an end to the brilliant but sterile exploits of the\r\nFrench on the Ohio and the Mississippi, the Anglo-Americans, then\r\nsubjects of the king of Great Britain, began to spread themselves over\r\nthe Valley. The first settlers seated themselves in Kentucky, and\r\noccupied the soil for agricultural purposes. In a short time they had\r\neffaced from its surface the slight traces, which the French, almost\r\nexclusively engaged in hunting, had left of their passage. Instead\r\nof the little and restless, but indolent race produced by a cross of\r\nFrench with Indian blood, the new comers, avoiding all mixture with\r\nthe natives, produced a laborious and energetic population, which,\r\non this fertile soil, and like its natural productions, acquired\r\nthose gigantic proportions, which characterise the West-Virginian,\r\nthe Kentuckian, and the Tennesseean, no less than the trees of their\r\nforests. Without ever laying aside their rifles, which forty years ago\r\nwere carried to divine service in Cincinnati itself, they cleared and\r\nbrought under the plough, the fertile tracts, which were converted into\r\nfine farms for themselves and their rapidly multiplying families. They\r\nhad to pass days of terrour and distress, and in many an encounter with\r\nthe Indians, from whom they conquered the wilderness, more than one\r\nhusband, and more than one father, fell under the balls of the Red men,\r\nwere dragged into the most wretched captivity, or underwent the horrid\r\ntorments of the stake. The name of Blue Licks still sounds in the ears\r\nof Kentucky, like that of Waterloo in ours. Before the decisive victory\r\nof the Fallen Timber, gained by General Wayne, two American armies,\r\nunder the command of Generals Harmer and Saint Clair, were successively\r\ndefeated with great slaughter. The story of this long struggle between\r\nthe whites and the Red men is still repeated in the bar-rooms of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, although the formidable Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet,\r\nhad not yet been conquered by General Harrison, the American had\r\nextended his undisputed empire over the most fertile districts of the\r\nWest. Here and there villages had been built; and the forest every\r\nwhere showed _clearings_, in the midst of which stood the log-house of\r\nsome squatter or some more legal proprietor. On the left bank of the\r\nOhio, Kentucky and Tennessee had been erected into States, and Western\r\nVirginia had been settled. A current of emigration had transported\r\nthe industrious sons of New England upon the right bank of the river,\r\nand by their energy the State of Ohio had been founded, and already\r\ncontained nearly 250,000 inhabitants. Indiana and Illinois, then\r\nmere Territories, gave fair promise of the future. The treaty of 1803\r\nhad added to the Union our Louisiana, in which one State and several\r\nTerritories, with a total population of 160,000 souls had already been\r\norganised. The whole West, at that time, had a population of nearly a\r\nmillion and a half: Pittsburg and Cincinnati were considerable towns.\r\nThe West had, then, made a rapid progress, but separated as it was from\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico by the circuitous windings and the gloomy swamps of\r\nthe Mississippi, from the eastern cities by the seven or eight ridges\r\nthat form the Alleghany Mountains, destitute of outlets and markets,\r\nits further progress seemed to be arrested. The embryo could grow but\r\nslowly and painfully, for want of the proper channels through which the\r\nsources of life might circulate.\r\n\r\nAt present, routes of communication have been made or are making from\r\nall sides, connecting the rivers of the West with the Eastern coast, on\r\nwhich stand the great marts, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,\r\nRichmond, and Charleston. At that time, there was not one which was\r\npracticable through the whole year, and there was not capital enough to\r\nundertake one. All the commerce of the West was carried on by the Ohio\r\nand the Mississippi, which is, indeed, still, and, probably, always\r\nwill be, the most economical route for bulky objects. The western\r\nboatmen descended the rivers with their corn and salt-meat in flat\r\nboats, like the Seine coal-boats; the goods of Europe and the produce\r\nof the Antilles, were slowly transported up the rivers by the aid of\r\nthe oar and the sail, the voyage consuming at the least one hundred\r\ndays, and sometimes two hundred. One hundred days is nearly the length\r\nof a voyage from New York by the Cape of Good Hope to Canton; in the\r\nsame space of time France was twice conquered, once by the allies\r\nand once by Napoleon. The commerce of the West, was, therefore,\r\nnecessarily very limited, and the inhabitants, separated from the rest\r\nof the world, had all the rudeness of the forest. It was in this period\r\nand this state of manners, that the popular saying, which describes\r\nthe Kentuckian as half horse, half alligator, had its origin. The\r\nnumber of boats, which made the voyage up and down once a year, did not\r\nexceed ten, measuring on an average about 100 tons; other small boats,\r\naveraging about 30 tons measurement, carried on the trade between\r\ndifferent points on the rivers, beside which there were numerous flat\r\nboats, which did not make a return voyage. Freight from New Orleans to\r\nLouisville or Cincinnati was six, seven, and even nine cents a pound.\r\nAt present the passage from Louisville to New Orleans is made in about\r\n8 or 9 days, and the return voyage in 10 or 12, and freight is often\r\nless than half a cent a pound from the latter to the former.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, the first steamboat in the West, built by Fulton, started\r\nfrom Pittsburg for New Orleans; it bore the name of the latter city.\r\nBut such are the difficulties in the navigation of the Ohio and\r\nMississippi, and such was the imperfection of the first boats, that\r\nit was nearly six years before a steamboat ascended from New Orleans,\r\nand then not to Pittsburg, but to Louisville, 600 miles below it. The\r\nfirst voyage was made in twentyfive days, and it caused a great stir in\r\nthe West; a public dinner was given to Captain Shreve, who had solved\r\nthe problem. Then and not before, was the revolution completed in the\r\ncondition of the West, and the hundred-day boats were supplanted. In\r\n1818, the number of steamboats was 20, making an aggregate of 3,642\r\ntons; in 1819 the whole number that had been built was 40, of which\r\n33 were still running; in 1821, there were 72 in actual service. In\r\nthat year the Car of Commerce, Captain Pierce, made the passage from\r\nNew Orleans to Shawneetown, a little below Louisville, in 10 days.\r\nIn 1835, after fourteen years of trials and experiments, the proper\r\nproportion between the machinery and the boats was finally settled\r\n(See _Note_ 21). In 1827, the Tecumseh ascended from New Orleans to\r\nLouisville in eight days and two hours. In 1829, the number of boats\r\nwas 200, with a total tonnage of 35,000 tons; in 1832, there were 220\r\nboats making an aggregate of 40,000 tons, and at present there are\r\n240, measuring 64,000 tons. According to statements made to me by\r\nexperienced and well-informed persons, the whole amount of merchandise\r\nannually transported by them between New Orleans and the upper country,\r\nis at least 140,000 tons. The trade between the basins of the Ohio,\r\nthe Tennessee, and the Upper Mississippi, not included in this amount,\r\nforms another considerable mass. To have an idea of the whole extent\r\nof the commerce on the western waters, we must also add from 160,000\r\nto 180,000 tons of provisions and various objects, which go down in\r\nflat-boats. This amount is, indeed, enormous, and yet it is probably\r\nbut a trifle compared with what will be transported on the rivers of\r\nthe West in 20 years from this time; for on the Erie canal, which,\r\ncompared with the Mississippi is a line of but secondary importance,\r\nand at a single point, Utica, 420,000 tons passed in a period of seven\r\nmonths and a half.\r\n\r\nSuch is the influence of routes of communication on which cheapness\r\nis combined with dispatch.[BB] In Mexico, where nature has done so\r\nmuch, and where, in return, man has done so little, in those countries\r\nwhere natural resources are, perhaps, tenfold greater than those of\r\nthe United States, but where man is a hundred fold less active and\r\nindustrious, transportation is effected wholly on the backs of mules or\r\nmen, even in the plain country. The annual amount of the transportation\r\nfrom Vera Cruz, the principal port, to Mexico, the capital of the\r\ncountry, does not, therefore, amount to 6,000 tons, and the descending\r\nfreight is much less. The western steamboats look very much like the\r\nVigier baths on the Seine; they are huge houses of two stories.[BC]\r\nTwo large chimneys of columnar form vomit forth torrents of smoke\r\nand thousands of sparks; from a third a whitish cloud breaks forth\r\nwith a loud noise; this is the steam-pipe. In the interior they have\r\nthat coquettish air that characterises American vessels in general;\r\nthe cabins are showily furnished, and make a very pretty appearance.\r\nThe little green blinds and the snugly fitted windows, pleasingly\r\ncontrasting with the white walls, would have made Jean-Jacques sigh\r\nwith envy.\r\n\r\nThe more ordinary capacity is from 200 to 300 tons, but many of them\r\nmeasure from 500 to 600; their length varies from 100 to 150 feet.\r\nNotwithstanding their dimensions and the elegance with which they are\r\nfitted up, they cost but little, the largest boats being built for\r\nabout 40,000 dollars, including their engines and furniture.[BD] A\r\nvery nice boat 100 feet long, of the legal measurement of 100 tons but\r\ncarrying 150, only costs from 7,000 to 8,000 dollars. It is estimated\r\nthat the large boats cost about 100 dollars a ton, legal measurement,\r\nand the small ones, 80 dollars. But if these elegant craft cost\r\nlittle, they do not last long; whatever care is taken in the choice\r\nof materials and for the preservation of the boat, it is rare that\r\nthey wear more than four or five years. An old captain, lately giving\r\nme an account of a boat about the construction of which he had taken\r\ngreat pains, told me, with a deep sigh, that \"she died at three years.\"\r\nThe magnificent vegetation of the West, those thrifty, tall, straight\r\ntrees, by the side of which our European oaks would appear like dwarfs,\r\ngrowing rapidly on the thick layer of soil deposited by the great\r\nrivers of the West in the diluvian period of geologists, last just in\r\nproportion to the time occupied by their growth. And in this case, as\r\nin regard to human glory and the splendour of empires, the rule holds\r\ngood, that time respects only what he has himself founded.\r\n\r\nThe number of passengers which these boats carry, is very considerable;\r\nthey are almost always crowded, although there are some which have\r\ntwo hundred beds. I have myself been in one of these boats which\r\ncould accommodate only 30 cabin passengers, with 72. A river voyage\r\nwas formerly equivalent to an Argonautic expedition, at present it\r\nis one of the easiest things in the world. The rate of fare is low;\r\nyou go from Pittsburg to New Orleans for 50 dollars, all found, and\r\nfrom Louisville to New Orleans for 25 dollars. It is still lower for\r\nthe boatmen, who run down the river in flat boats and return by the\r\nsteamers; there are sometimes 500 or 600 of them in a separate part of\r\nthe boat, where they have a shelter, a berth, and fire, and pay from\r\n4 to 6 dollars for the passage from New Orleans to Louisville; they\r\nare, however, obliged to help take in wood. The rapidity with which\r\nthese men return, has contributed not a little to the extension of the\r\ncommerce of the West; they can now make three or four trips a year\r\ninstead of one, an important consideration in a country where there is\r\na deficiency of hands. On the downward voyage, their place is occupied\r\nby horses and cattle, which are sent to the South for sale, and by\r\nslaves, human cattle destined to enrich the soil of the South with\r\ntheir sweat, to supply the loss of hands on the sugar plantations of\r\nLouisiana, or to make the fortune of some cotton planters. Virginia is\r\nthe principal seat of this traffic, \"the native land of Washington,\r\nJefferson and Madison, having become,\" as one of her sons sorrowfully\r\nobserved to me, \"the Guinea of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nExcellent as these boats are, great as is the service they render\r\nAmerica, when the first feeling of curiosity is once satisfied, a long\r\nconfinement in one of them has little that is attractive for a person\r\nof a cultivated mind and refined manners. There are few Europeans\r\nof the polished classes of society, and even few Americans of the\r\nhigher class in the Eastern cities, who, on escaping from one of these\r\nfloating barracks, would not feel disposed, under the first impulse\r\nof ill humour, to attest the correctness of Mrs Trollope's views of\r\nwestern society. There is in the West a real equality, not merely an\r\nequality to talk about, an equality on paper; everybody that has on a\r\ndecent coat is a gentleman; every gentleman is as good as any other,\r\nand does not conceive that he should incommode himself to oblige his\r\nequal. He is occupied entirely with himself, and cares nothing for\r\nothers; he expects no attention from his neighbour, and does not\r\nsuspect that his neighbour can desire any from him. In this rudeness,\r\nhowever, there is not a grain of malice; there is on the contrary an\r\nappearance of good humour that disarms you. The man of the West is\r\nrude, but not sullen or quarrelsome. He is sensitive, proud of himself,\r\nproud of his country, and he is so to excess, but without silliness or\r\naffectation. Remove the veil of vanity in which he wraps himself, and\r\nyou will find him ready to oblige you and even generous. He is a great\r\ncalculator, and yet he is not cold, and he is capable of enthusiasm.\r\nHe loves money passionately, yet he is not avaricious; he is often\r\nprodigal. He is rough because he has not had time to soften his voice,\r\nand cultivate the graces of manner. But if he appears ill-bred, it is\r\nnot from choice, for he aspires to be considered a man of breeding; but\r\nhe has been obliged to occupy himself much more with the cultivation\r\nof the earth, than of himself. It is perfectly natural that the first\r\ngeneration in the West should bear the impress of the severe labours it\r\nhas so energetically and perseveringly pursued. If these reflections,\r\nhowever, are consoling for the future, they cannot give to a life\r\naboard the Ohio and Mississippi steamboats any charms for him who sets\r\nvalue on amiable and engaging manners.\r\n\r\nBesides, the voyage on the Mississippi is more dangerous than a passage\r\nacross the ocean; I do not mean merely from the United States to\r\nEurope, but from Europe to China. In the former, you are exposed to the\r\nrisk of explosions, and of fire, and in ascending, to that of running\r\nagainst snags and planters. Then there is the danger of your boat\r\nfalling afoul of another, running in an opposite direction, in a fog,\r\nto say nothing of the inconvenience of getting aground on sand-bars.\r\nAdd to these things the monotonous aspect of the country on the river,\r\nthe solitude of its flat and muddy banks, the filthy appearance of its\r\nyellow and turbid waters, the strange habits of most of the travellers\r\ncrowded into the same cage with yourself, and you may conceive, that,\r\nin course of time, such a situation becomes extremely unpleasant. The\r\nLouisiana planters, therefore, who go North in the hot season in search\r\nof a fresher and purer air than that of New Orleans, make their annual\r\nmigrations by sea, aboard the fine packet-ships, which run regularly\r\nbetween that city and New York. Explosions of the boilers are frequent,\r\neither on account of the ignorance and want of skill of the engineers,\r\nor on account of the defective nature of the boilers themselves, and\r\nthey are always attended with serious injury, because the boats are so\r\nmuch crowded with passengers. A few days ago, sixty persons were killed\r\nand wounded aboard a single boat, but these accidents do not occur in\r\nwell managed boats, in which no unseasonable economy has been practised\r\nin the purchase of the machinery and the wages of the engineers.[BE]\r\nSome law containing provisions similar to those in force in France, is\r\nrequired here, but in order to be practicable, it should be made to\r\napply to the whole Valley, which would only be the case with an act of\r\nCongress. Public opinion, however, would not permit Congress to meddle\r\nwith the matter, and the cry of Federal encroachment on State rights\r\nwould be raised at once. One State only, Louisiana, has passed a law\r\non the subject, but it is very defective, and I do not suppose that\r\nit is enforced. Preventive measures are what is wanted, inspection of\r\nthe machinery and licensing of competent engineers, while the law of\r\nLouisiana only provides for the punishment of the captain on board\r\nwhose boat an accident happens, with a special penalty in case he\r\nshould be engaged in any game of hazard, at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nThere have been many accidents by fire in the steamers, and many\r\npersons have perished in this way, although the river is not very\r\nwide. The Brandywine was burnt near Memphis, in 1832, and every\r\nsoul on board, to the number of 110, was lost. The Americans show a\r\nsingular indifference in regard to fires, not only in the steamboats,\r\nbut also in their houses; they smoke without the least concern in the\r\nmidst of the half open cotton-bales, with which a boat is loaded,\r\nthey ship gunpowder with no more precaution than if it were so much\r\nmaize or salt pork, and leave objects packed up in straw right in the\r\ntorrent of sparks that issue from the chimneys. The accidents caused\r\nby the trunks of trees in the bed of the river, called logs, snags,\r\nsawyers, or planters, according to their position, have been very\r\nnumerous; attempts have been made to prevent this class of disasters,\r\nby strengthening the bows, and by bulk-heads which double the hull in\r\nthat part. The Federal government has two snag-boats, constructed with\r\ngreat ingenuity, which are employed in removing these obstructions\r\nfrom the rivers, but the bordering States, whose taxes are very light,\r\nhave contributed nothing towards these objects. The machinery of the\r\nHeliopolis and Archimedes, contrived by Captain Shreve, has done much\r\ntoward clearing the channel, but there is still much to be done.\r\n\r\nThe chances of accident might be diminished in various ways, by\r\nwell-directed measures, and at a moderate expense. The character of\r\nthe river is now well understood, and there are many engineers in the\r\nUnited States, who can manage the Great Father of Waters. Unluckily\r\nthe Federal government, which does not know what to do with its money,\r\n(for it has now on hand a surplus of eleven millions,) is checked\r\nby a doctrine with which, one cannot tell why, the democratic party\r\nhave become possessed, and which forbids the general government from\r\nengaging in public works within the limits of the individual States.\r\nThus, although the whole Union is interested in the improvement of\r\nthe navigation of the western rivers, the Federal government does not\r\nventure to undertake it with energy and on a liberal scale. General\r\nJackson's predecessor, Mr Adams, was a warm friend to the action of\r\nthe government in internal improvements. He thought, like Mr Clay and\r\nother men of superior abilities, that the progress of the young States\r\nof the West would be very much accelerated, to the advantage of the\r\nwhole Union, if the central government would undertake to execute,\r\nin whole or in part, a system of public works of general interest.\r\nBut one of the watchwords of the opponents of Mr Adams was, _No\r\nInternal Improvements!_ and the very States which would have been most\r\nimmediately benefited by it, rallied to this cry. So utterly can party\r\nspirit blind the most clear-sighted of men!\r\n\r\nIf accidents of so serious a nature succeeded each other with such\r\nfrequency in Europe, there would be a general outcry. The police and\r\nthe legislative power would vie with each other in their efforts to\r\nput a stop to them. Steamboats would become the terror of travellers,\r\nthe public would abandon them, and they would be left deserted on the\r\nrivers. The effect would be the same, in a degree, around the large\r\neastern cities, because society there is beginning to be regularly\r\norganised, and a man's life counts for something. In the West, the\r\nflood of emigrants, descending from the Alleghanies, rolls swelling and\r\neddying over the plains, sweeping before it the Indian, the buffalo,\r\nand the bear. At its approach the gigantic forests bow themselves\r\nbefore it, as the dry glass of the prairies disappears before the\r\nflames. It is for civilisation, what the hosts of Genghis Khan and\r\nAttila were for barbarism; it is an invading army, and its law is the\r\nlaw of armies. The mass is everything, the individual nothing. Wo to\r\nhim who trips and falls! he is trampled down and crushed under foot.\r\nWo to him who finds himself on the edge of a precipice! The impatient\r\ncrowd, eager to push forward, throngs him, forces him over, and he is\r\nat once forgotten, without even a half-suppressed sigh for his funeral\r\noration. _Help yourself!_ is the watchword. The life of the genuine\r\nAmerican is the soldier's life; like the soldier he is encamped, and\r\nthat, in a flying camp, here to-day, fifteen hundred miles off in a\r\nmonth. It is a life of vigilance and strong excitement; as in a camp,\r\nquarrels are settled in the west, summarily and on the spot, by a duel\r\nfought with rifles, or knives, or with pistols at arm's length. It is\r\na life of sudden vicissitudes, of successes and reverses; destitute\r\nto-day, rich tomorrow, and poor the day after, the individual is\r\nblown about with every wind of speculation, but the country goes on\r\nincreasing in wealth and resources. Like the soldier, the American of\r\nthe West takes for his motto, _Victory or death!_ But to him, victory\r\nis to make money, to get the dollars, to make a fortune out of nothing,\r\nto buy _lots_ at Chicago, Cleveland, or St. Louis, and sell them a\r\nyear afterward at an advance of 1000 per cent.; to carry cotton to New\r\nOrleans when it is worth 20 cents a pound. So much the worse for the\r\nconquered; so much the worse for those who perish in the steamboats!\r\nThe essential point is not to save some individuals or even some\r\nhundreds; but, in respect to steamers, that they should be numerous;\r\nstaunch or not, well commanded or not, it matters little, if they move\r\nat a rapid rate, and are navigated at little expense. The circulation\r\nof steamboats is as necessary to the West, as that of the blood is to\r\nthe human system. The West will beware of checking and fettering it by\r\nregulations and restrictions of any sort. The time is not yet come, but\r\nit will come hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere are certain feelings in the human heart that must show themselves\r\nin some form or another, and if repressed in one point, will break out\r\nin another. Respect for the depositaries of authority, which until\r\nthe time of our revolution, had so firmly cemented European society\r\ntogether, has constantly been on the wane on this side of the Atlantic,\r\nand in the West is totally obscured. There the authorities, for so\r\nthey are called, have as little power as pay; there are governors\r\nwho govern nothing, judges who are very liable to be brought to\r\njudgment themselves. The chief magistrate is pompously styled in the\r\nconstitutions of these new States commander-in-chief of the army and\r\nnavy of the State. Pure mockery! for it is at the same time provided,\r\nexcept in time of war; and even in time of peace, he has hardly the\r\npower of appointing a corporal. Yet the feeling of discipline and\r\nobedience subsists, and it is instinctively transferred to those men\r\nwho are in fact the generals of the great migration. If little concern\r\nis felt in regard to the Governor of the State, every body is docile\r\nand obedient to the innkeeper, the driver of the coach, and the captain\r\nof the steamboat; with them no one ventures to maintain the principles\r\nof self-government. All rise, breakfast, dine, sup, when the landlord\r\nor his lieutenant-general, the bar-keeper, thinks fit to ring the bell,\r\nor beat the gong; it is just as it is in a camp. They eat what is\r\nplaced before them, without ever allowing themselves to make any remark\r\nabout it. They stop at the pleasure of the driver and the captain,\r\nwithout showing the least symptom of impatience; they allow themselves\r\nto be overturned and their ribs to be broken by the one, they suffer\r\nthemselves to be drowned or burnt up by the other, without uttering a\r\ncomplaint or a reproach; the discipline is even more complete than in\r\nthe camp. It has been said that the life of founders of empires, from\r\nthe times of Romulus to that of the buccaneers, consists of a mixture\r\nof absolute independence and passive obedience. The society which is\r\nnow founding itself in the West, has not escaped the common law.\r\n\r\nThis part of the United States, which was a mere wilderness at the\r\ntime of the Declaration of Independence, and on which no one spent a\r\nthought, when the capital was fixed at Washington, will be the most\r\npowerful of the three great sections of the Union, at the taking of\r\nthe next census. Before long, it will singly be superior to the two\r\nothers taken together, it will have the majority in Congress, it will\r\ngovern the New World. Already the old division into North and South\r\nis becoming of secondary moment, and the great division of the Union\r\nwill soon be into the East and the West; the present President is a\r\nman of the West. The democratic party have just held a convention\r\nat Baltimore to agree upon the selection of candidates for the next\r\npresidential election. Mr Van Buren, who is from the East, has been\r\nchosen, but although he had the unanimous vote of the convention, he\r\nseems about to find a formidable competitor in the bosom of his own\r\nparty, in the person of Mr White of Tennessee. On the subject of the\r\nVice-Presidency there was an animated debate in the convention itself;\r\nsome proposed Mr Rives from the South, others Mr Johnson from the West.\r\nMr Rives passes for a man in every respect superior to his antagonist,\r\nhis diplomatic services have been highly esteemed by his countrymen. Mr\r\nJohnson is honest, indeed, but there is great doubt, or rather there\r\nis no doubt at all, about his abilities. The only claim set up by his\r\nfriends is, a _strong suspicion_ that he killed the celebrated Indian\r\nchief Tecumseh, in the battle of the Thames. But then Mr Johnson is\r\nfrom the West, and he has been preferred to his rival, even at the risk\r\nof offending Virginia, whose influence in the South is acknowledged to\r\nbe commanding. Mr Van Buren has yielded to this arrangement or probably\r\nhe has concerted it, because he would rather risk the loss of the South\r\nthan of the West. This, then, the West is already become; and when\r\nwe reflect that the only visible instrument of this progress is the\r\nsteamboat, we shall not wonder that the whole political system of some\r\nmen is comprised in physical improvements, and the interests connected\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[BB] Freight on our canals is only about half as high as in the United\r\nStates; but this advantage is counterbalanced by the excessive slowness\r\nof our movements.\r\n\r\n[BC] The Homer, a noted boat built by Mr Beckwith of Louisville, one of\r\nthe most skilful builders in the West, has a third story.\r\n\r\n[BD] A boat of the same dimensions would cost nearly 100,000 dollars in\r\nFrance; this is owing to the low price of the timber, the coarseness of\r\nthe steam-engines, which, on account of the cheapness of fuel, there\r\nwould be no advantage in making with more nicety, and the skill of the\r\nmechanics; the Americans excel in working in wood.\r\n\r\n[BE] A good engineer gets about 100 dollars a month in the large boats,\r\nand there are two to a boat. In France the wages of the same man would\r\nbe from 20 to 25 dollars a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.\r\n\r\nINTERCOMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BUFFALO, (N. Y.) JULY 9, 1835.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the United States consists; 1. of the two great\r\ninland basins of the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence, which run, the\r\nformer from north to south towards the Gulf of Mexico, the latter\r\nfrom south to north toward the gulf to which it gives its own name:\r\n2. on the eastern side, of a group of smaller basins, which empty\r\ntheir waters into the Atlantic ocean, and of which the principal\r\nare those of the rivers Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, Susquehanna,\r\nPotomac, James, Roanoke, Santee, Savannah, and Altamaha. The Alleghany\r\nMountains, which, from their lying in the direction of the length of\r\nthe continent, are called the back-bone of the United States, form a\r\nnatural water-shed, dividing the great inland basins from the eastern\r\ngroup of small basins. On the west, the valleys of the St. Lawrence and\r\nMississippi are bounded by the Mexican Cordilleras, which here take the\r\nname of Rocky Mountains. At the foot of this chain spreads out a wide\r\ndesert, bare of vegetation, and which, excepting some cases, can never,\r\nit is said, be peopled by man.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole English-American population is as yet on the left of\r\nthe Mississippi. On the right bank there is only one State, and that\r\none of the least important of the confederacy, and one Territory,\r\nthat of Arkansas, which will soon become one of the members of the\r\nUnion.[BF]\r\n\r\nThe Alleghany chain does not reach a great height; being hardly as\r\nlofty as the Vosges, while the Rocky Mountains exceed in elevation the\r\nPyrenees and even the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Alleghany system, although of no great height, rises from a very\r\nwide base, of which the breadth is nearly 150 miles by an air-line.\r\nViewed as a whole, it consists of a number of cavities separated by as\r\nmany ridges or crests, and stretching with great uniformity, nearly\r\nfrom one end of the chain to the other, from the shores of New England,\r\nwhere the mountains are washed by the sea, to the Gulf of Mexico, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of which they gradually sink down. These alternations\r\nof the ridges and cavities form a series of parallel furrows, which\r\nmay be traced on the surface, with some breaks, through a distance of\r\n1200 or 1500 miles. The geological formations are arranged very nearly\r\nin conformity with these furrows, through great distances; there are,\r\nhowever, exceptions from this rule, for sometimes the same layer is\r\nseen to pass from one furrow to another, always cutting the former at a\r\nvery acute angle.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this general character of regularity, these cavities\r\nare not hydrographical basins or river valleys. But the rivers, instead\r\nof hollowing out beds between two successive ridges, and thus passing\r\noff to the sea, frequently pass from one furrow to another, breaking\r\nthrough the weak points of the ridges. These openings or gaps, as\r\nthey are here called, are highly useful as routes for roads, canals,\r\nand railroads, enabling the engineer, by following the course of the\r\nrivers, to flank heights, which it would have been almost impossible\r\nto top. Of all these openings the most interesting is that made by the\r\nPotomac through the Blue Ridge, at Harper's Ferry, which Jefferson, in\r\nhis Virginian enthusiasm, said was worth a voyage across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe United States may then be divided hydrographically into two\r\ndistinct regions, the one to the east, the other to the west, of the\r\nAlleghanies; or into three, as under: 1. the Mississippi valley: 2. the\r\nvalley of the St. Lawrence with the great lakes: 3. the Atlantic coast.\r\nThis vast country may also be divided into the North and the South, and\r\nit has two commercial capitals, New York and New Orleans, which are, as\r\nit were, the two lungs of this great body, the two galvanic poles of\r\nthe system. Between these two divisions, the North and the South, there\r\nare radical differences, both in a political and an industrial point\r\nof view. The social frame in the South is founded on slavery; in the\r\nNorth, on universal suffrage. The South is a great cotton-plantation,\r\nyielding also some subsidiary articles, such as tobacco, sugar, and\r\nrice. The North acts as factor or agent for the South, selling the\r\nproductions of the latter, and furnishing her in return with those of\r\nEurope; as a sailor, carrying her cotton beyond sea; as an artisan,\r\nmaking all her household utensils and farming tools, her cotton-gins,\r\nher sugar-mills, her furniture, wearing apparel, and all other articles\r\nof daily use, and finding her also in corn and salted provisions.\r\n\r\nFrom these views it appears that the great public works in the United\r\nStates must have the following objects: 1. To connect the Atlantic\r\ncoast-region with the region beyond the Alleghanies; that is, to\r\nunite the rivers of the former, such as the Hudson, the Susquehanna,\r\nthe Potomac, the James, or its bays, such as the Delaware and the\r\nChesapeake, either with the Mississippi or its tributary the Ohio,\r\nor with the St. Lawrence, or the great lakes Erie and Ontario,\r\nwhose waters are carried by the St. Lawrence to the Ocean: 2. To\r\nform communications between the Mississippi Valley and that of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, that is, between one of the great tributaries of the\r\nMississippi, such as the Ohio, the Illinois, or the Wabash, and Lake\r\nErie or Lake Michigan, which, of all the great lakes of the St.\r\nLawrence basin, reach the furthest southwards. 3. To connect together\r\nthe northern and southern poles of the Union, New York and New Orleans.\r\n\r\nIndependently of these three new systems of public works, which are\r\nin fact, in progress, and even in part completed, there are numerous\r\nsecondary lines, intended to make the access to the centres of\r\nconsumption more easy, or to open outlets from certain centres of\r\nproduction, whence arise two new classes of works; the one including\r\nthe various canals and railroads, which, starting from the great\r\ncities as centres, radiate from them in all directions, and the other,\r\ncomprising the similar works executed for the transportation of coal\r\nfrom the coal-regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I. LINES EXTENDING ACROSS THE ALLEGHANIES.\r\n\r\nThe works which have hitherto almost wholly occupied, and still chiefly\r\noccupy, the attention of statesmen and business men in the United\r\nStates, are those designed to form communications between the East\r\nand the West. There are on the Atlantic coast four principal towns,\r\nwhich long strove with each other for the supremacy; namely, Boston,\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. All four aimed to secure the\r\ncommand of the commerce of the new States which are springing up in\r\nthe fertile regions of the West; and they have sustained the struggle\r\nwith different degrees of success, but always with a rare spirit of\r\nintelligence. They have not, however, been equally favoured in respect\r\nto natural advantages. Boston is too far north; she has no river\r\nwhich permits her to stretch her arms far toward the West, and she is\r\nsurrounded by a hilly country, which throws great obstacles in the\r\nway of rapid communication, and makes all works designed to promote\r\nit expensive. Philadelphia and Baltimore are shut up by ice almost\r\nevery winter, and this obstruction is, on the part of the latter,[BG]\r\na drawback from the other advantages of her position, her greater\r\nnearness to the Ohio, her more central latitude, and the beauty of\r\nher bay, which is above 250 miles in length, and receives numberless\r\nstreams, as the Susquehanna, Potomac, Patuxent, Rappahannock, &c.\r\nPhiladelphia is badly placed; Penn was led astray by the beauty of the\r\nSchuylkill and the Delaware; he thought that the broad plain spread\r\nout between their waters to the width of nearly three miles, would\r\nafford an admirable site for a city, whose streets should be run\r\nwith regularity, and whose warehouses, easy of access, would permit\r\nthousands of vessels to load and unload at once. He forgot to secure\r\nfor his city a great hydrographical basin, capable of consuming the\r\nmerchandise which it should import, and of sending it in return the\r\nproducts of its own labour, and he neglected to make an examination of\r\nthe Delaware, which he took for a great river, but which, unluckily is\r\nnot so. If he had founded the city of Brotherly Love on the banks of\r\nthe Susquehanna, it might have maintained a long struggle against New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nNew York is, then, the queen of the Atlantic coast. This city stands on\r\na long, narrow island, between two rivers (the North River and the East\r\nRiver); ships of any burden and in any numbers may lie at the wharves;\r\nthe harbour is very rarely closed by ice; it can be entered by small\r\nvessels with all winds, and by the largest ships at all times except\r\nwhen the wind is from the northwest. New York has beside the invaluable\r\nadvantage of standing upon a river for which some great flood has dug\r\nout a bed through the primitive mountains, uniformly deep, without\r\nrocks, without rapids, almost without a slope, and cutting through the\r\nmost solid mass of the Alleghanies at right angles. The tide, slight as\r\nit is on this coast, flows up the Hudson to Troy, 160 miles from its\r\nmouth; and such is the nature of its bed, that whale-ships are fitted\r\nout at Poughkeepsie and Hudson, of which the former is 75 and the\r\nlatter 116 miles above New York, and that, except in the lowest stage\r\nof the water, vessels of 9 feet draft can go up to Albany and Troy, in\r\nany tide.\r\n\r\nNew York possesses in addition great advantages in respect to the\r\ncharacter of its population. Originally a Dutch colony, conquered by\r\nthe English, and lying in the neighborhood of New England, she presents\r\na mixture of the solid qualities of the Saxon race, of the Dutch\r\nphlegm, and the enterprising shrewdness of the Puritans. This mixed\r\nbreed understands admirably how to turn to account all the advantages\r\nwhich nature has bestowed on the city.\r\n\r\nHardly was the war of independence at an end, when the great men whose\r\npatriotism and courage had brought it to a happy close, filled with\r\nideas of the wealth yet buried in the bosom of the then uninhabited\r\nWest, began to form plans for rendering it accessible by canals. If it\r\nis true, that Prussia, in the time of Voltaire, resembled two garters\r\nstretched out over Germany, the United States in the time of Washington\r\nand Franklin, and it is only fifty years since, might be likened to a\r\nnarrow riband thrown upon the sandy shore of the Atlantic. Washington\r\nat that time projected the canal which has since been begun according\r\nto the plans of Gen. Bernard, and which seeks the West by following up\r\nthe Potomac; but from want of capital and experienced engineers, what\r\nin our day has become a long and fine canal, was then merely a series\r\nof side-cuts around the Little Falls and Great Falls of the Potomac.\r\nAt the same time, the Pennsylvanians made some unsuccessful efforts\r\nand spent considerable sums, in ineffectual attempts to render the\r\nSchuylkill navigable, and to connect it with the Susquehanna. In the\r\nState of New York, some short cuts, some locks and sluices, were then\r\nthe only prelude to greater schemes.[BH] The works undertaken at that\r\ntime and during the fifteen first years of the present century could\r\nnot be completed, or failed in the expected results. One work only was\r\nsuccessfully executed, the Middlesex Canal, which extends from Boston\r\nto the River Merrimack at Chelmsford, a distance of 27 miles.[BI]\r\n\r\nThe war of 1812 found the United States without canals, and almost\r\nwithout good roads; their only means of intercourse were the sea,\r\ntheir bays, and the rivers that flow into them. Once blockaded by the\r\nEnglish fleets, not only could they hold no communication with Europe\r\nand India, but they could not keep up an intercourse among themselves,\r\nbetween State and State, and between city and city, between New York\r\nand Philadelphia for instance. Their commerce was annihilated, and\r\nthe sources of their capital dried up. Bankruptcy smote them like a\r\ndestroying angel, sparing not a family.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LINE. ERIE CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe lesson was hard, but it was not lost. The Americans, to do them\r\njustice, know how to profit by the teachings of Providence, especially\r\nif they pay dear for them. The project of a canal between New York\r\nand Lake Erie, which had already been discussed before the war, was\r\neagerly taken up again after the peace. De Witt Clinton, a statesman\r\nwhose memory will be ever hallowed in the United States, succeeded in\r\ninspiring his countrymen with his own noble confidence in his country's\r\ngreat destiny, and the first stroke of the spade was made on the 4th\r\nof July, 1817. In spite of the evil forebodings of men distinguished\r\nfor their sagacity and public services; in spite of the opinion of the\r\nvenerated patriarch of democracy, of Jefferson himself, who declared it\r\nnecessary to wait a century longer before undertaking such a work; in\r\nspite of the remonstrances of the illustrious Madison, who wrote that\r\nit would be an act of folly on the part of the State of New York to\r\nattempt, with its own resources only, the execution of a work for which\r\nall the wealth of the Union would be insufficient; notwithstanding\r\nall opposition this State, which did not then contain a population of\r\n1,300,000 inhabitants, began a canal 428 miles in length, and in eight\r\nyears it had completed it at a cost of 8,400,000 dollars. Since that\r\ntime it has continued to add numerous branches, covering almost every\r\npart of the State, as with net-work. In 1836, the State had completed\r\n656 miles of canal including slack-water navigation, at the expense of\r\n11,962,712 dollars, or 18,235 dollars per mile.[BJ]\r\n\r\nThe results of this work have surpassed all expectations; it opened an\r\noutlet for the fertile districts of the western part of the State,\r\nwhich had before been cut off from a communication with the sea and the\r\nrest of the world. The shores of Lake Erie and Ontario were at once\r\ncovered with fine farms and flourishing towns. The stillness of the old\r\nforest was broken by the axe of New York and New England settlers, to\r\nthe head of Lake Michigan. The State of Ohio, which is washed by Lake\r\nErie, and which had hitherto had no connection with the sea except by\r\nthe long southern route down the Mississippi, had now a short and easy\r\ncommunication with the Atlantic by way of New York. The territory of\r\nMichigan was peopled, and it now contains 100,000 inhabitants, and will\r\nsoon take its rank among the States.[BK] The transportation on the Erie\r\nCanal exceeded 400,000 tons in 1834, and it must nearly reach 500,000\r\ntons in 1835. The annual amount of tolls from the canals, and at\r\nmoderate rates, is about one million and a half dollars. The population\r\nof the city of New York increased in the ten years, from 1820 to 1830,\r\n80,000 souls.[BL] New York is become the third, if not the second port\r\nin the world, and the most populous city of the western hemisphere. The\r\nillustrious Clinton lived long enough to see the success of his plans,\r\nbut not to receive the brilliant reward which the gratitude of his\r\ncountrymen intended for him. He died, February 11, 1828, at the age of\r\n59 years, and but for this premature death, he would probably have been\r\nchosen President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Canal is no longer sufficient for the commerce which throngs\r\nit. In vain do the lock-masters attend night and day to the signal\r\nhorn of the boatmen, and perform the process of locking with a\r\nquickness that puts to shame the slowness of our own; there is no\r\nlonger room enough in the canal, whose dimensions however are rather\r\nlimited.[BM] The impatience of commerce, with whom time is money,\r\nis not satisfied with a rate of speed about fourfold that which is\r\ncommon on our canals. Merchandise of all sorts, as well as travellers,\r\nflows in at every point in such quantities, that railroads have been\r\nconstructed along the borders of the canal, to rival the packet-boats\r\nin the transportation of passengers only. There is one from Albany to\r\nSchenectady, 15 miles in length, which, though not well built, cost\r\nabout 550,000 dollars. A second, which will be finished in 1836, runs\r\nfrom Schenectady to Utica, and is 78 miles in length.[BN] A third\r\nrailroad is in progress from Rochester to Buffalo by way of Batavia and\r\nAttica, about 80 miles in length, and it is probable that before long\r\nthe line will be completed from one end of the canal to the other.[BO]\r\n\r\nA still greater undertaking is already in train; a company was\r\nchartered in 1832, which will begin next spring the construction of a\r\nrailroad from New York city to Lake Erie, through the southern counties\r\nof the State; on account of the circuitous route made necessary by the\r\nuneven nature of the ground, the length of this road will be about 340\r\nmiles.[BP] Meanwhile the Canal Commissioners have not slept; in July,\r\nthe Canal Board, in compliance with an act of the Legislature, directed\r\nthe construction of a double set of lift locks on the whole line, in\r\norder that there may be as little delay as possible in the passage of\r\nboats, and the enlargement of the canal so that the width shall be\r\n70 feet and the depth 6 feet, with a corresponding increase in the\r\ndimension of the locks; larger boats may then be used the speed may be\r\nincreased, and perhaps it will be practicable to use steam tow-boats.\r\nThe cost of this work is estimated at about 12,500,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nFinally, to make herself more entirely mistress of the commerce of the\r\nWest, and to penetrate her own territory more completely, the State of\r\nNew York is about to commence a new branch of the Erie canal (if we may\r\ncall a work of which the entire length will be 120 miles, a branch),\r\nwhich will form an immediate connection with the River Ohio. This canal\r\nis to run from Rochester, the flourishing city of millers, following\r\nup the course of the Genesee, with a rise of 979 feet to the summit\r\nlevel, and a fall of 78 feet thence to Olean, on the River Alleghany,\r\n270 miles from its junction with the Monongahela at Pittsburg. The main\r\ncanal from Rochester to Olean is only 107 miles in length, but there is\r\na branch to Danville. The Alleghany, in its natural state, is navigable\r\nonly during a few months in the year; the total distance from New York\r\nto Pittsburg by this route is 800 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen there could no longer be a doubt of the speedy completion of the\r\nErie Canal, Philadelphia and Baltimore felt that New York was going\r\nto become the capital of the Union. The spirit of competition aroused\r\nin them a spirit of enterprise. They wished also to have their routes\r\nto the West; but both had great natural obstacles to overcome. By\r\nmeans of the Hudson, which had forced a passage through the heart of\r\nthe mountains, New York was freed from the greatest difficulty in the\r\nway of effecting a communication between the East and the West, that\r\nof topping the crest of the Alleghanies. Between Albany, where the\r\nErie canal begins, and Buffalo, where it meets the lake, there are no\r\nhigh mountains. Baltimore could not look for a similar service to the\r\nPatapsco, nor Philadelphia to the Delaware; neither of these cities can\r\napproach the west by the basin of the great lakes, unless by a very\r\ncircuitous route; they are too far off. It became necessary for them,\r\ntherefore, to climb the loftiest heights, and thence to descend to the\r\nlevel of the Ohio with their works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LINE. PENNSYLVANIA CANAL.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the Pennsylvania canal is a long line of 400 miles,\r\nstarting from Philadelphia, and ending at Pittsburg on the Ohio. It\r\nwas begun simultaneously with several other works, at the expense of\r\nthe state of Pennsylvania, in 1826. It is not entirely a canal; from\r\nPhiladelphia a railroad 81 miles in length, extends to the Susquehanna\r\nat Columbia. To the Columbia railroad, succeeds a canal, 172 miles\r\nin length, which ascends the Susquehanna and the Juniata to the foot\r\nof the mountains at Holidaysburg. Thence the Portage railroad passes\r\nover the mountain to Johnstown, a distance of 37 miles, by means\r\nof several inclined planes constructed on a grand scale, with an\r\ninclination sometimes exceeding one tenth, which does not, however,\r\ndeter travellers from going over them.[BQ] From Johnstown a second\r\ncanal goes to Pittsburg, 104 miles. This route is subject to the\r\ninconvenience of three transhipments, one at Columbia at the end of\r\nthe railroad from Philadelphia, and the others at the ends of the\r\nPortage railroad, one of these may be avoided by means of two canals\r\nconstructed by incorporated companies, namely, the Schuylkill canal,\r\nwhich extends up the river of that name, and the Union canal, which\r\nforms a junction between the upper Schuylkill and the Susquehanna. The\r\ndistance from Philadelphia to Pittsburg by this route is 435 miles, or\r\n35 miles more than by the other route.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania canal, begun in 1826, was finished in 1834. The State\r\nhas connected with this work a general system of canalization, which\r\nembraces all the principal rivers, and especially the Susquehanna, with\r\nits two great branches (the North Branch and the West Branch), and also\r\nworks preparatory to a canal connecting Pittsburg with Lake Erie, at\r\nErie, a town founded by our Canadian countrymen, and by them called\r\nPresqu'île. Pennsylvania has executed, then, in all about 820 miles of\r\ncanals and railroads, of which 118 are railroads, at a cost of about\r\n25,000,000 dollars, exclusive of sums paid for interest. Average cost\r\nper mile, 35,000 dollars; average cost per mile, of canals, 32,500;\r\naverage cost per mile of railroads, 48,000.\r\n\r\nThis is much more than the cost of the New York works, although the\r\ndimensions of the works are the same, and the natural difficulties\r\nwere not greater in one case than in the other; it is owing to bad\r\nmanagement in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvanians had no Clinton to\r\nguide them. An unwise economy, forced upon the Canal Commissioners by\r\nthe legislature, prevented them from securing the services of able\r\nengineers, and for the sake of saving some thousands of dollars in\r\nsalaries, they have been obliged to spend millions in repairing what\r\nwas badly done, or in doing badly what more able hands would have\r\nexecuted well at less cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD LINE. BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nStill less than Philadelphia, could Baltimore think of a continuous\r\ncanal to the Ohio. Wishing to avoid the transhipments which are\r\nnecessary on the Pennsylvania line, the Baltimoreans decided on the\r\nconstruction of a railroad extending from their city to Pittsburg or\r\nWheeling, the whole length of which would be about 360 miles. It is\r\nnow finished as far as Harper's Ferry on the Potomac, a distance of 80\r\nmiles, and the company seem to have given up the design of carrying it\r\nfurther. It will here be connected with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,\r\nof which I shall speak below, as the Columbia railroad is connected\r\nwith the Pennsylvania canal. It is probable, that, on approaching\r\nthe crest of the Alleghanies, the canal will in turn give away to a\r\nrailroad across the mountains, and thus the Maryland works will be\r\nsimilar to the Pennsylvania line.[BR]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH LINE. CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe plan, which had been cherished by Washington, of making a lateral\r\ncanal along the Potomac which should one day be extended across the\r\nmountains to the Ohio, was resumed when New York had taught the country\r\nthat it was now ripe for the boldest enterprises of this kind. John\r\nQuincy Adams, then President of the United States, favoured the project\r\nwith all his might. At that time it was not a settled principle, that\r\nthe Federal government had no right to engage in internal improvements.\r\nThe old idea, which Washington had cherished, of making the political\r\ncapital of the Union a great city, was not less to the taste of Mr\r\nAdams and his friends. It was, therefore, resolved to undertake the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal, and a company was incorporated for this\r\npurpose. Congress voted a subscription of 1,000,000 dollars; the\r\ncity of Washington without commerce, without manufactures, with its\r\npopulation of 16,000 souls, subscribed the same sum; the other little\r\ncities of the Federal District, Georgetown and Alexandria, having\r\nboth together a population of about 10,000, furnished a half million;\r\nVirginia contributed 250,000, and Maryland 500,000 dollars; and 600,000\r\ndollars were raised by individual subscriptions. The work was begun\r\nJuly 4, 1828. Next year, by aid of a loan of 3,000,000 from Maryland,\r\nthis great work will be carried to the coal-beds of Cumberland at\r\nthe foot of the mountains; the length of this division is 185 miles,\r\nthe estimated cost 8,500,000 dollars, or 46,000 dollars per mile.\r\nThe execution is on a bold scale, and superior to that of the works\r\nbefore-mentioned; its dimensions exceed those generally adopted in the\r\nproportion of 3 to 2, which gives a larger section in the ratio of 9 to\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH LINE. JAMES RIVER AND KANAWHA COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\nVirginia, formerly the first State in the confederacy, but now fallen\r\nto the fourth in rank, and already outstripped by Ohio, which was not\r\nin being during the war of Independence, is at length roused to action,\r\nand has determined to profit by the lessons, which have come to her\r\nfrom the North. A company, whose means consist of little more than the\r\nsubscriptions of the State and of the capital, Richmond, is about to\r\nopen a canal from the East to the West. James River, which flows into\r\nChesapeake Bay, is navigable for vessels of 200 tons to the foot of the\r\ntable-land, on which Richmond stands in so charming a situation. On the\r\neast of the mountains, the canal, starting from Richmond, will follow\r\nthe course of James River, and on the West it will descend the Kanawha,\r\none of the tributaries of the Ohio, to Charleston, at the head of\r\nsteamboat navigation. The Alleghany crest will be passed by a railroad,\r\n150 miles in length; the canal itself will be about 250 miles long.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, stirred up by the example of Virginia, is engaged in\r\na great railroad from Charleston to Cincinnati on the Ohio; and the\r\nsurveys are at present actively going on. The people of Cincinnati\r\nare enthusiastically interested in this scheme.[BS] Georgia is also\r\ndreaming of a great railroad from the Savannah to the Mississippi, at\r\nMemphis; but this project has not assumed a substantial shape. North\r\nCarolina does nothing, and projects nothing. If she ever becomes rich,\r\nit will not be because she has seized fortune by the forelock, but\r\nbecause fortune has come to her bedside.[BT]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH LINE. RICHELIEU CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians are constructing a canal which will form another\r\ncommunication between the East and the West, that is, between the\r\nHudson and the St. Lawrence, between New York and Quebec. The great\r\nfissure, which forms so fine a bed for the Hudson between New York and\r\nTroy, does not end here, but stretches on towards the north to the St.\r\nLawrence, constituting the basin of Lake Champlain, which is a long\r\nand narrow cavity in the midst of the mountains, and the bed of the\r\nRiver Richelieu. Between Lake Champlain and the Hudson, there is only\r\na ridge 54 feet above the level of the former, and 134 above that of\r\nthe latter. The River Richelieu, which issues from the northern end\r\nof the lake and flows into the St. Lawrence, is broken by rapids, and\r\na lateral canal, 12 miles in length, and of sufficient dimensions to\r\nreceive the lake-craft, will be opened here in the course of a year;\r\nthe cost will be 350,000 dollars; the distance from New York to Quebec\r\nby the canals, rivers, and lakes, is 540 miles. The railroad from St.\r\nJohn, where the rapids of the Richelieu begin, to Laprairie, on the St.\r\nLawrence, opposite to Montreal, a distance of 16 miles, effects for\r\nMontreal what the canal does for Quebec; it cost about 160,000 dollars,\r\nor 10,500 dollars per mile. The distance from Montreal to New York is\r\n360 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II. LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND\r\nTHAT OF THE ST. LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\nThere is no mountain chain between these two valleys; the basin of the\r\ngreat lakes, whose united waters form the St. Lawrence, is separated\r\nfrom the valley of the Mississippi only by a spur of the Alleghany\r\nsystem, not exceeding 450 feet in height, and sinking rapidly down\r\ntoward the west, so as to be elevated but a few feet above the surface\r\nof Lake Michigan. During the rainy season, when the streams are swollen\r\nand the marshes of the water-shed are flooded, our Canadian countrymen\r\nwere wont to pass in boats from Lake Michigan into the Illinois, by the\r\nDes Plains. The breadth of this dividing spur is more considerable than\r\nits height. It is not a ridge or crest, but rather a table-land, which\r\nimperceptibly merges by gentle slopes into the plains that surround it.\r\nIts level summit is filled with marshes, and therefore offers great\r\nfacilities for feeding the canals which traverse it; further west,\r\nwhere it is scarcely higher than the rest of the country, it is often\r\nas dry as the surrounding prairies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST LINE. OHIO CANAL.\r\n\r\nOnly one work connecting the two valleys is as yet completed, this\r\nis the Ohio canal, which traverses that State from North to South,\r\nextending from Portsmouth, on the Ohio, to the little city of\r\nCleveland, which has sprung up on the shore of the lake since the canal\r\nwas made. It is 334 miles in length, and cost nearly 4,500,000 dollars,\r\nor about 13,500 dollars per mile. This is low, yet the locks are all\r\nof hewn stone; the ground, however, was very favorable. The work was\r\nexecuted at the expense of the State, and was undertaken at the same\r\ntime at Pennsylvania and Baltimore, on the traces of New York, started\r\nin the course of internal improvements. This young State, with a\r\npopulation of farmers, not having a single engineer within her limits,\r\nand none of whose citizens had ever seen any other canal than those of\r\nNew York, has thus, with the aid of some second rate engineers borrowed\r\nfrom that State, constructed a canal longer than any in France, with\r\nmore skill and intelligence than was displayed by Pennsylvania, in\r\nspite of the scientific lights of Philadelphia. This farming population\r\nof Ohio, almost wholly of New England origin, has a business instinct,\r\na practical shrewdness, and a readiness to exercise all trades without\r\nhaving learned them, that would be sought in vain in the Anglo-German\r\npopulation of Pennsylvania. The legislators, under whose direction the\r\npublic works were executed in both States, were, as is usual in the\r\nUnited States, a perfect copy of the mass of their constituents, with\r\nall its good and bad qualities. The Ohio canal commissioners added to a\r\nnoble disinterestedness an admirable good sense, and to them is due the\r\ngreater part of the glory of having planned and executed it. They were\r\nfarmers and lawyers, who set themselves about making canals, naturally,\r\neasily, and without even a suspicion that in Europe no one dares to\r\nundertake such a work without long preparation and scientific studies.\r\nNow it is no longer an art in that State to plan and construct canals,\r\nbut a mere trade; the science of canalling is there become quite an\r\naffair of the common people. The first-comer in a bar-room will\r\nexplain to you, over his glass of whiskey, how to feed the summit level\r\nand how to construct a lock. All our mysteries in civil engineering are\r\nhere fallen into the hands of the public, very much as the methods of\r\ndescriptive geometry are to be found in the workshops, where they had\r\nbeen handed down by tradition, ages before Monge gave them the sanction\r\nof theory.\r\n\r\nI have before said that Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois form a great\r\ntriangle, wholly comprised within the Mississippi valley, with the\r\nexception of a narrow strip along the lakes, belonging, of course, to\r\nthe St. Lawrence basin. The general slope of the surface is from north\r\nto south; the streams run mostly in that direction; this is especially\r\ntrue of the great tributaries of the Ohio. This arrangement of the\r\nsecondary valleys is no less favourable to the construction of canals\r\nbetween the lakes, on the one side, and the Ohio and Mississippi on the\r\nother, than the configuration and humidity of the dividing table-land.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LINE. MIAMI CANAL.\r\n\r\nOhio has constructed another canal, which, starting from Cincinnati on\r\nthe Ohio, runs north to Dayton, and is called the Miami canal. It is 65\r\nmiles in length, and cost nearly 1,000,000 dollars, or 15,400 dollars\r\na mile. By the aid of a grant of land from Congress, and the State's\r\nresources, its prolongation is now in progress to Defiance, on the\r\nriver Maumee, the site of a fortress of that name built by Gen. Wayne\r\nafter his celebrated victory over the Indians. The Maumee, which was\r\ncalled by the French the Miami of the Lakes, is one of the principal\r\ntributaries of Lake Erie, and is to be canalled by the State. The\r\ndistance from Dayton to Defiance is 125 miles; estimated cost 2,750,000\r\ndollars, or 22,000 dollars per mile.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD LINE. WABASH AND ERIE CANAL.\r\n\r\nOhio and Indiana, with the aid of a grant of land[BU] from Congress,\r\nhave undertaken in concert a canal, which will connect the Wabash,\r\none of the tributaries of the Ohio, with the Maumee. The greater part\r\nof the canal will be parallel to the two rivers, or in their beds;\r\nthe length of the whole work will be 382 miles, of which 195 are in\r\nIndiana, and 87 in Ohio. The greater portion of the Indiana section\r\nlateral to the Wabash has been completed, but Ohio has not yet been\r\nable to commence her portion, because, owing to an absurd system of\r\nestablishing boundaries, the mouth of the Maumee, whose whole course\r\nis in Ohio, will fall within Michigan.[BV] Ohio protests against this\r\narrangement, Michigan stands firm to her claims; both sides have voted\r\nthe sums needful for war, and both have taken arms; hostilities have\r\neven been begun, but the interference of the Federal government has\r\nled the parties to consent to an armistice. In this quarrel, Ohio\r\nhas reason on her side, but Michigan appeals to the letter of the\r\nlaws as favourable to her. It is probable that in creating Michigan\r\na State, Congress will attach this strip to Ohio, to whom it is so\r\nimportant.[BW] In this unsettled state of things, Ohio has suspended\r\nthe execution of her part of a work, which will give new importance to\r\nthe mouth of the Maumee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH LINE. ILLINOIS AND MICHIGAN CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe project of a canal from the Chicago, at the southern end of lake\r\nMichigan, to the head of steam navigation, that is, to the foot of\r\nthe falls, in the River Illinois, has long been discussed. It is said\r\nto be of very easy construction; and that by means of a cut of the\r\nmaximum depth of 26 feet, the summit level can be reduced to the level\r\nof Lake Michigan, so that the lake can be used as a feeder. It will be\r\n96 miles in length, and will traverse a level or slightly undulating\r\ncountry, bare of trees, and still known by the name given it by the\r\nFrench Canadians, _Prairie_. It is proposed to construct this canal of\r\nlarger dimensions than is common in the United States, so as to make\r\nit navigable by the lake-craft and steamboats. It is one of the most\r\nuseful works ever undertaken in the world.[BX]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH LINE. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe canal which has been commenced by Pennsylvania between the Ohio and\r\nthe town of Erie, 112 miles in length, and for feeding which extensive\r\nworks have already been constructed around Lake Conneaut, will make\r\nanother and a short line of water communication between the basins of\r\nthe Mississippi and the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT LINES.\r\n\r\nLastly, two canals are about to be undertaken, which will connect the\r\nPennsylvania works with those of Ohio, and of consequence, form new\r\nconnections between the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence. One of these\r\nis the Sandy and Beaver canal, which, beginning at the confluence of\r\nthe Big Beaver with the Ohio, follows the latter to the mouth of the\r\nLittle Beaver, ascends the valley of this stream, and passes down that\r\nof the Sandy River to the Ohio canal at Bolivar; the length will be\r\n90 miles. From Bolivar to New York by the Ohio canal, Lake Erie, Erie\r\ncanal, and the Hudson, the distance is 785 miles; by the new canal\r\nthe distance from Bolivar to Philadelphia, that is, to the ocean, is\r\nonly 512. The Mahoning canal leaves the Ohio canal at Akron, following\r\nthe valleys of the Little Cuyahoga, the Mahoning, a tributary of the\r\nBig Beaver, and the Big Beaver, to the Ohio; it is about 90 miles in\r\nlength; the distance from Akron to the river Ohio is 115 miles.\r\n\r\nThe generally level character of the surface of Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois is not less favourable to the construction of railroads than\r\nto that of canals. But as capital is scarce in this new country,\r\nwhich is as yet but imperfectly brought under cultivation, but few\r\nenterprises of much importance have hitherto been undertaken. The\r\nfinancial companies and institutions, which have always preceded the\r\nintroduction of canals and railroads, have, however, been already\r\nestablished and are prosperous, and their success is the omen of the\r\napproach of the latter. In the absence of companies, the States are\r\nready to adopt the most extensive schemes of public works; for the\r\nAmerican of the West is not a whit behind the American of the East in\r\nenterprise. At present, I know of but a single railroad actually in\r\nprocess of construction beyond the Ohio, and that does not seem to be\r\npushed forward with much activity; it is the Mad River railroad, which\r\nis to extend from Dayton, on the Miami canal, to Sandusky, on the bay\r\nof that name in Lake Erie; the length will be 153 miles. Many others\r\nhave been projected in this region, and Indiana has caused surveys to\r\nbe made for a railroad extending across the State from north to south,\r\nor from New Albany on the Ohio to some point on Lake Michigan.[BY]\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS FOR IMPROVING THE NAVIGATION OF THE OHIO, MISSISSIPPI, AND ST.\r\nLAWRENCE.\r\n\r\nTo this head belong the works executed in the beds of the rivers\r\nthemselves. The Mississippi is the _beau idéal_ of rivers in regard\r\nto navigable facilities. From St. Louis to New Orleans, a distance of\r\nnearly 1200 miles, there is water enough for steamers of 300 tons\r\nthroughout the year. Its yellow and muddy waters flow in a deep,\r\nalthough very circuitous channel, and its general breadth is from 800\r\nto 1,000 yards, in places where it is not expanded to a much greater\r\nwidth by low, flat islands, thickly covered with trees. There are\r\nno sand-banks in this part of the channel, yet there are formidable\r\ndangers in the way of the inexperienced navigator; these are the trunks\r\nof trees, that have been carried away from the banks, as has been\r\nbefore mentioned, and in the removal of which the Federal government\r\nkeeps steam _snag-boats_, the Heliopolis and Archimedes, employed;\r\nthese boats are provided with a peculiar machinery by means of which\r\nthey drag the trees up from the bed, and saw them into pieces of an\r\ninconsiderable length.\r\n\r\nCaptain Shreves, who has the command of these boats, and who invented\r\nthe machinery, is also employed in constructing sunk dams of loose\r\nstones in the Ohio, which have the effect of increasing the depth of\r\nwater in the dry season. He is at present engaged with a flotilla\r\nof steamboats in opening the bed of Red River, one of the great\r\ntributaries of the Mississippi, which the drift timber has choked up\r\nand covered over through a distance of 165 miles.[BZ] At Louisville,\r\nthe Ohio, whose bed has generally a very slight inclination, has a\r\ndescent of 22 feet in the distance of two miles, so as to be impassable\r\nfor steamboats, except during the season of high water. The Louisville\r\nand Portland canal has been constructed by a company to avoid this\r\nobstruction; it is nearly one mile and three fourths in length, and\r\ncost 750,000 dollars.[CA] It receives the largest boats at a rate of\r\ntoll which for the Henry Clay amounts to 175 dollars, and for the\r\nUncle Sam 190 dollars. It has been proposed that Congress should buy\r\nthis canal, and make the passage toll-free; and the importance of the\r\nnavigation of the Ohio would justify the measure.\r\n\r\nThe St. Lawrence differs essentially from the Mississippi; instead\r\nof an expanse of muddy waters, it presents to the eye a clear\r\nblue surface. The Mississippi traverses a low, uninhabited, and\r\nuninhabitable region, of which the soil consists entirely of sand;\r\nor rather of mud deposited by the river-floods; not a stone as large\r\nas the fist is to be found, and only a few bluff points are met\r\nwith which are above the reach of high water, and on which the pale\r\ninhabitants struggle unsuccessfully with the pestilential emanations\r\nof the surrounding swamps. The St. Lawrence flows through a broken,\r\nhilly, and sometimes rugged country, with a fertile soil, everywhere\r\nhealthful, sprinkled with flourishing villages, which attract the eye\r\nof the traveller from a distance by their houses newly white-washed\r\nevery year, and their churches built in the French style with their\r\nspires covered with tin. The Mississippi, like the Nile, has its annual\r\noverflow, or rather it has two in each year, but the spring-floods\r\nare much the most considerable. The St. Lawrence, owing to the vast\r\nextent of the lakes which serve as a reservoir and feeder to it, always\r\npreserves the same level, the extreme range of its rise and fall being\r\nonly about 20 inches. The St. Lawrence, from the beauty of its waters,\r\nfrom their prodigious volume, from the country which it waters, and\r\nfrom the groups of isles scattered over it, would be one of the first\r\nrivers in the world in the eyes of the artist, but in those of the\r\nmerchant, it is of quite a secondary importance. Its transparent waters\r\nhardly hide the numerous rocks; the navigation is interrupted first\r\nby the Falls of Niagara, and after it leaves Lake Ontario by numerous\r\nrapids, cataracts, or rocks between that lake and Montreal, and none\r\nbut an Indian or a French Canadian, would dare to descend these points\r\nin that portion of the river in a canoe; at several points, the most\r\npowerful steamer would be unable to make head against the current.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of emulation which has prevailed among the States of\r\nthe Union, has extended to the British Provinces, to the English\r\npopulation, which, leaving the lower part of the river to the French,\r\nhas occupied Upper Canada. The inhabitants of this Province have\r\nembraced the opinion, that if the chain of communication which is\r\nbroken by the cataracts and rapids, could be made whole, much of\r\nthe produce, which now finds its way to the Mississippi, or to the\r\nPennsylvania and New York canals, would seek a more convenient vent by\r\nthe St. Lawrence, and that the British manufactures would take the same\r\nroute up the river, through the ports of Quebec and Montreal, to the\r\nWestern States. One canal has, therefore, already been executed around\r\nthe falls of the Niagara, which forms a communication between Lakes\r\nErie and Ontario; the Welland canal is 28 miles in length, exclusive of\r\n20 miles of slack-water navigation. It is navigable by lake-craft of\r\n120 tons, and has cost 2,000,000 dollars, nearly the whole of which was\r\nfurnished by the upper Province, Lower Canada and the mother country\r\nhaving contributed a very trifling sum.\r\n\r\nSince that work has been completed, the river below Lake Ontario has\r\nbeen surveyed, and it has been found that the aggregate length of the\r\npoints not passable by steamboats of ten feet draft is only 30 miles,\r\npretty equally divided between the two provinces. Upper Canada, which\r\ncontains hardly 250,000 inhabitants, with no large towns and with\r\nlittle capital, has begun her portion of the work along the rapids\r\nwithin her limits. This work will be large enough to admit the passage\r\nof steamboats drawing nine feet water, and of the burden of 500 tons. I\r\nsaw the labourers at work along the Long Saut Rapids at Cornwall, where\r\nthere will be a cut of 13 miles in length; the estimated cost of this\r\nsection is 1,250,000 dollars. The French population of Lower Canada,\r\nswallowed up in political quarrels, the result of which cannot be\r\nforeseen, neglects its essential interests in pursuit of the imaginary\r\ninterests of national pride. It has done nothing towards continuing,\r\nwithin its limits, the great work, which has been begun by the poorer\r\nprovince of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III. LINES OF COMMUNICATION ALONG THE ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nFIRST LINE. INLAND CHANNELS BY THE SOUNDS AND BAYS ALONG THE ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nUpon examining the coast of the United States from Boston to Florida,\r\nit will be seen that there is almost a continuous line of inland\r\nnavigation, extending from northeast to southwest in a direction\r\nparallel to that of the coast, formed, in the north by a series of bays\r\nand rivers, and in the south, by a number of long sounds, or by the\r\nnarrow passes between the mainland and the chain of low islands that\r\nlie in front of the former. The necks of land that separate these bays,\r\nrivers, and lagoons, are all flat and of inconsiderable breadth. From\r\nProvidence (42 miles south of Boston) to New York are Narragansett Bay\r\nand Long Island Sound, together 180 miles in length. Thence to reach\r\nto the Delaware you go to New Brunswick at the head of the Raritan Bay,\r\nwhere you encounter the New Jersey isthmus, a level tract, not more\r\nthan 40 feet above the level of the sea, or than 35 to 40 miles in\r\nwidth. This neck is now cut across by the Raritan and Delaware Canal,\r\na fine work, navigable by the small coasting craft, and 43 miles in\r\nlength, exclusive of a navigable feeder 24 miles, all lately executed\r\nby a company, in less than three years, at a cost of about 2,500,000\r\ndollars.[CB]\r\n\r\nThis canal terminates at Bordentown, on the Delaware. Hence the\r\nnavigation is continued to Delaware City, 70 miles below Bordentown,\r\nand 40 below Philadelphia. There, the isthmus which divides the\r\nDelaware from the Chesapeake, is cut through by a canal, of which the\r\nsummit level is only 12 feet above the surface of the sea; this is the\r\nChesapeake and Delaware canal, like the last mentioned of dimensions\r\nsuited to coasting vessels. The cost was very great, about 2,600,000\r\ndollars; length 13 1-2 miles. Having entered the Chesapeake, the\r\nvoyage may be continued to Norfolk about 200 miles. Thence, to the\r\nseries of sounds and inland channels on the coast of North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia, extends the Dismal Swamp Canal, whose\r\nlength is 20 miles, and whose summit level is only 10 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea; this is also adapted for coasting vessels. The works\r\nintended to continue the navigation beyond the sounds connected with\r\nthe Dismal Swamp canal, have not been completed, and to the south of\r\nthe Chesapeake the line is, therefore, imperfect; but steamboats run\r\nfrom Charleston to Savannah, by the channels and lagoons between the\r\nmainland and the low islands which yield the famous long-staple cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND LINE. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH BY THE MARITIME\r\nCAPITALS.\r\n\r\nParallel to the preceding line which is designed for the transportation\r\nof bulky articles, is another further inland for the use of travellers,\r\nand the lighter and more valuable merchandise, on which steam is\r\nbecoming the only motive power, both by land and by water; by land on\r\nrailways, and by water in steamboats. You go from Boston to Providence\r\nby a railroad, 42 miles in length, which cost 1,500,000 dollars, or\r\n33,000 dollars a mile. From Providence to New York, passengers are\r\ncarried by the steamboats in from 14 to 18 hours; some boats have made\r\nthe passage in 12 hours. In passing from Narragansett Bay to the Sound,\r\nit is necessary to double Point Judith, where there is commonly a rough\r\nsea, to avoid which a railway is now in progress from Providence to\r\nStonington, a distance of 47 miles. A third railroad, of which the\r\nutility seems questionable (since the boats in the Sound move at the\r\nrate of 15 miles an hour), is projected from a point on Long Island\r\nopposite Stonington to Brooklyn, a distance of 88 miles.\r\n\r\nBetween New York and Philadelphia, you go by steamboat to South\r\nAmboy on Raritan Bay, 28 miles, whence a railroad extends across\r\nthe peninsula to Bordentown, and down along the Delaware to Camden,\r\nopposite Philadelphia. In summer a steamboat is taken at Bordentown,\r\nbut in winter the Delaware is frozen over, and the railway is then\r\nused through the whole distance to transport the crowd that is always\r\ngoing and coming between the commercial and financial capitals of the\r\nUnited States, between the great mart and the exchange of the Union,\r\nbetween the North and the South. An ice-boat lands the traveller in\r\nPhiladelphia, a few minutes after he has left the cars at Camden. This\r\nrailroad is 61 miles in length, and cost 2,300,000 dollars, or 38,000\r\ndollars a mile. It has but one track most of the way. I met many\r\npersons at Philadelphia, who remembered having been two, and sometimes\r\nthree long days on the road to New York; it is now an affair of seven\r\nhours, which will soon be reduced to six. Two railroads belonging to a\r\ndifferent group, of which one is completed, and the other nearly so,\r\nwill form, with the exception of an interval of several miles, a second\r\nline across the peninsula, from New York to Philadelphia. The one\r\nextends from Philadelphia to Trenton, 26 miles; the other from Jersey\r\nCity, opposite New York to New Brunswick, 30 miles; if, therefore,\r\nrails were laid between New Brunswick and Trenton, a distance of 28\r\nmiles, over a perfectly level plain, the land communication between New\r\nYork and Philadelphia would be complete; but the State of New Jersey\r\nhas hitherto refused to authorise this connection, because it received\r\na considerable sum from the Camden and Amboy company for the monopoly\r\nof the travel.[CC]\r\n\r\nFrom Philadelphia to Baltimore, the route is continued by a steamboat\r\nto Newcastle, and a railroad from thence to Frenchtown, across\r\nthe peninsula, 16 1-4 miles long, whence another steamboat takes\r\nthe traveller to Baltimore, in 8 or 9 hours after starting from\r\nPhiladelphia. The Newcastle and Frenchtown railroad cost 400,000\r\ndollars, or 24,500 dollars a mile. The navigation of the Chesapeake\r\nand Delaware is sometimes interrupted by ice, and it has, therefore,\r\nbeen thought that it would be useful to have a continuous railroad from\r\nPhiladelphia; there would also be a saving of time, for the present\r\nroute is somewhat circuitous. Different companies have undertaken\r\ndifferent portions of this work, which will pass by Wilmington and\r\nHavre de Grace, at the mouth of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nThe whole distance by this route is only 93 miles, instead of 118, the\r\ndistance by the present line, and the passage will occupy five or six\r\nhours, instead of eight or nine. From Baltimore southwardly two routes\r\noffer themselves; you may take the steamboat to Norfolk, a distance of\r\n200 miles, which is accomplished in 18 or 20 hours, whence another boat\r\nascends the James River to Richmond still more rapidly, the distance\r\nof about 135 miles being passed over in 10 hours; or you may go from\r\nNorfolk to Weldon on the Roanoke by a railroad 77 miles in length, of\r\nwhich two thirds are completed.[CD]\r\n\r\nFrom Baltimore you may also go to Washington, by a branch of the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio railroad, and thence by steamboat down the Potomac\r\nto a little village, 15 miles from Fredericksburg, from which a\r\nrailroad is now in progress to Richmond. It will be 58 miles in length,\r\nand will cost but 12,000 dollars a mile, including the engines, cars,\r\nand depots. From Petersburg, 20 miles from Richmond, a railroad\r\nextends to Blakely on the Roanoke, 60 miles, and the interval between\r\nPetersburg and Richmond will soon be filled up. The Petersburg and\r\nRoanoke railroad, which is shorter than the post-road, follows with\r\nvery little deviation an old Indian trail, a remarkable fact, which was\r\ntold me by the able engineer Mr Moncure Robinson. It extends, almost\r\nentirely on the surface of the ground and without embankments, through\r\nthe sandy, uncultivated plains, intersected by pools of stagnant water,\r\nwhich uniformly border the sea from the Chesapeake to Cape Florida, and\r\nare annually infested by the fever of the country. The whole region\r\nis most admirably adapted for railroads, which are constructed almost\r\nwholly of wood. The surface is graded by nature, and the sandy soil\r\noffers an excellent foundation for the wooden frame on which the rails\r\nare placed. The still virgin forests, consisting of pine and oak,\r\nafford an inexhaustible supply of timber for the construction of the\r\nrailways, free to whoever wishes to use it. But if the nature of the\r\ncountry is well suited to this object, the condition of the population\r\nis far from being so. In this sterile tract, the inhabitants are thinly\r\nscattered over the surface, and there are only a few villages here and\r\nthere on the rivers. Large towns, in which alone the necessary capital\r\nwould be found, do not exist, and the aid of Northern capitalists has\r\nbeen necessarily resorted to. Philadelphia capital has been largely\r\nemployed in the construction of the Petersburg and Richmond railroads,\r\nand without it, the great line between the South and the North, will\r\nnot be continued across North Carolina, one of the poorest States in\r\nthe confederacy, and connected with the works completed or in progress\r\nin Georgia and South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a great void of 325 miles, between the Roanoke\r\nand Charleston, the chief city of South Carolina, or rather of 275\r\nmiles between the Roanoke and Columbia, the capital of that State.[CE]\r\nFrom Charleston, a railroad 136 miles in length, extends through\r\nthe uncultivated and feverish zone of sand and pine-barrens to the\r\ncotton-region; it terminates at Hamburg, on the River Savannah,\r\nopposite Augusta, which is the principal interior cotton-market; the\r\ncost of this work was only about 9,500 dollars a mile including some\r\ncars, &c. Its construction is peculiar in this respect, that where its\r\nlevel is above that of the surface, recourse has been had to piles\r\ninstead of embankments; the railway, thus perched upon stilts from 15\r\nto 25 feet high, certainly leaves something to be desired in regard\r\nto the safety of travellers, but it was necessary to construct it,\r\nand to do so with a very small capital, and in this respect it has\r\nbeen successful. The receipts have already been sufficiently large to\r\npermit the company gradually to substitute embankments of earth for the\r\nfrail props on which it formerly rested. Another singular circumstance\r\nabout it is, that it was constructed almost entirely by slaves. This\r\nroad was undertaken with the purpose of diverting the cotton, which\r\ndescended the river Savannah to the town of the same name, from that\r\nplace to Charleston, and it has fully answered the expectations of its\r\nprojectors.\r\n\r\nFrom Augusta, the Georgia railroad has lately been begun, and will\r\ntraverse some of the most fertile cotton districts in the State;\r\nit will extend to Athens, a distance of 115 miles. To continue the\r\nline from North to South, or from Boston to New Orleans, it would be\r\nnecessary that this railroad should be prolonged in the direction of\r\nMontgomery, Alabama, whence a steamer takes the traveller to Mobile,\r\non the River Alabama.[CF] Between Mobile and New Orleans, there are\r\nregular lines of steamboats running through Mobile Bay, Pascagoula\r\nSound, and Lakes Borgne and Pontchartain. The four last miles, between\r\nthe latter lake and New Orleans, are passed over in a quarter of an\r\nhour on a railroad, which the Louisiana legislature calls in its bad\r\nFrench _chemin à coulisses_. Such is the line between the North and\r\nSouth, of which the execution is the most advanced; it will not be\r\nthe only one, but as civilisation establishes itself further west and\r\ncapital multiplies, several new routes will be formed, receding more\r\nand more from the coast.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore and Ohio railroad is connected at Harper's Ferry with\r\nthe Winchester railroad, 30 miles in length, which runs up the bed of\r\none of those long valleys that separate the successive ridges of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains from each other. That in which Winchester stands,\r\nis one of the most regular and fertile of these great basins, and is\r\ncelebrated under the name of the Virginia Valley. Although, therefore,\r\nthe Winchester railroad was constructed only for the purpose of giving\r\nthe produce of Winchester and its vicinity an easy access to the market\r\nof Baltimore, yet it may one day become a link in the great chain of\r\ncommunication extending through the Valley from north to south. A\r\ncompany has already been chartered for continuing the work to Staunton,\r\na distance of 96 miles. Another line from the South to the North,\r\nwhich will, perhaps, be connected with that of the great Valley, has\r\nbeen projected at New Orleans, and authorised by the legislatures of\r\nLouisiana and the other States through which it will pass; it is a\r\nrailroad from New Orleans to Nashville, the capital of Tennessee, and\r\nI am assured that the work will soon be commenced. This line aspires\r\nto nothing less than a competition with the magnificent river lines of\r\nthe Ohio and the Mississippi, in the transportation of passengers and\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV. LINES RADIATING AROUND THE LARGE TOWNS.\r\n\r\nFIRST CENTRE. BOSTON.\r\n\r\nThree railroads extend from Boston in different directions; the first,\r\n26 miles in length, to the manufacturing city of Lowell, which is\r\nthus become a suburb of Boston, and the second, 44 miles in length,\r\nto Worcester, the centre of an important agricultural district. The\r\nformer cost 60,000 dollars a mile, the latter 32,000. The third road is\r\nthe Providence railroad, already mentioned above as one of the links\r\nin the great chain from north to south. The Lowell railroad enters\r\ninto competition with the Middlesex canal; the Worcester road is to\r\nbe continued to the River Hudson, where it will terminate opposite\r\nAlbany. It will also be connected with the city of Hudson, 30 miles\r\nbelow Albany, by a railroad extending from West Stockbridge. It will\r\nthus become to Boston a Western Railroad, which name it has in fact\r\nreceived. A company has been authorised to execute the portion between\r\nWorcester and Springfield, a distance of 54 miles, the whole distance\r\nfrom Boston to Albany being 160 miles.[CG] The Eastern railroad, a\r\nfourth work is about to be undertaken, passing through Lynn, famous for\r\nits boots and shoes. Salem, a little city which carries on an extensive\r\ntrade with China, Ipswich, Beverly, and Newburyport towards Portland,\r\nthe principal town in the northern extremity of the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND CENTRE. NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nRadiating from New York are, 1. The railroad to Paterson, an important\r\nmanufacturing town at the falls of the Passaic, 16 miles in length; 2.\r\nThe New Brunswick railroad already mentioned, which serves as a route\r\nof communication with several important points, especially Newark, and\r\nfor the transportation of provisions for the New York market from a\r\nportion of New Jersey; 3. The Harlæm railroad, almost exclusively for\r\npassengers; and 4. The Brooklyn and Jamaica railroad, on Long Island,\r\n12 miles in length, and designed both for pleasure excursions, and for\r\ntransporting articles of consumption to the markets of New York.[CH]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD CENTRE. PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nAround Philadelphia, in addition to the great works extending to\r\nColumbia, Amboy, and Baltimore, already mentioned, are 1. The Trenton\r\nrailroad; 2. The Norristown and Germantown road, designed for\r\npassengers and for the accommodation of some manufacturing villages,\r\nsuch as Manayunk, 16 miles in length; and 3. That of West Chester, a\r\nbranch of the Columbia railroad, 9 miles in length, designed for the\r\nsupply of the markets of the city. There are also several railroads\r\nrunning through the city, of which the rails are laid on the level of\r\nthe street, and on which horse-cars only are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH CENTRE. BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\nBeside the Baltimore and Ohio railroad with its Washington branch,\r\nBaltimore is also about to have a railroad through York, to the\r\nSusquehanna, opposite to Columbia, the length of which will be 73\r\nmiles. The object of this road is to contest with Philadelphia the\r\ncommerce of the valley of the Susquehanna. The Pennsylvania canal\r\nwith its various branches forms a canalisation of this river and its\r\ntributaries above Columbia. But below Columbia, there are several\r\nrapids and shoals which interrupt the navigation of the river, except\r\nfor downward-bound boats in the highest stages of the water. The\r\nPhiladelphia merchants, fearing that all the works executed at a great\r\nexpense by Pennsylvania, would turn out much less advantageously\r\nfor them than for the Baltimoreans, as these last have, indeed,\r\nopenly boasted, opposed for a long time both the canalisation of the\r\nSusquehanna from Columbia to its mouth, and the permission to construct\r\nthat section of a railroad from Baltimore to Columbia, which would\r\nlie within the limits of Pennsylvania. Their opposition has, however,\r\nbeen at last overcome, and charters have been granted authorising the\r\nconstruction of both works. The railroad company, to which Maryland has\r\njust made a loan of 1,000,000 dollars, is pushing on the railway with\r\ngreat activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH CENTRE. CHARLESTON.\r\n\r\nSome short canals have been cut to facilitate the access to Charleston\r\nfrom the interior, but they are in a bad state, and are of little\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH CENTRE. NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the short railway of five miles from Lake Pontchartain\r\nto New Orleans, there are several other works, such as the Carrolton\r\nrailroad, which is a little longer, and two short canals extending from\r\nthe city to the lake. Some cuts have also been made between the lagoons\r\nand marshes of the lower Mississippi. These canals, dug in a wet and\r\nmuddy soil, have presented serious difficulties in their construction;\r\nbut they are of no interest in regard to extent or importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH CENTRE. SARATOGA.\r\n\r\nSaratoga Springs in New York are visited for two or three months in the\r\nsummer, by crowds of persons who throng thither in shoals. There is\r\nnot a master of a family of Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore, in\r\neasy circumstances, who does not feel obliged to pass 24 or 48 hours\r\nwith his wife and daughters, amidst this crowd in their Sunday's best,\r\nand to visit the field where the English army under General Burgoyne\r\nsurrendered its arms. There are at present two railroads to Saratoga;\r\none from Schenectady, 22 miles in length, a branch of the Albany and\r\nSchenectady road, and another from Troy on the Hudson, 25 miles in\r\nlength. After the season is over they serve for the transportation of\r\nfuel and timber.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V. WORKS CONNECTED WITH COAL-MINES.\r\n\r\nThe bituminous coal-mines of Chesterfield, near Richmond, are connected\r\nwith the river James by a short railway adapted only for horses, which\r\nis 12 miles long, and cost 15,000 dollars a mile, inclusive of the\r\ncars, depots, &c. Once delivered at the river, the coal is easily\r\ntransported along the whole coast, where it comes into competition with\r\nthe English and Nova Scotia coals.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite beds of Pennsylvania have caused the construction of a\r\nmuch more extensive series of works. At present hardly any other fuel\r\nis consumed on the coast for domestic and manufacturing purposes than\r\nthe anthracite, which is found only in a small section of Pennsylvania,\r\nlying between the Susquehanna and the Delaware. It gives a more intense\r\nand sustained heat than wood, which had also become very dear, and is\r\nmuch better suited to the rigourous winters, which are experienced\r\nin the United States, under the latitude of Naples. It is also much\r\npreferable to the bituminous coal, which is the only sort of coal in\r\nuse with us; it makes no smoke, and is much more cleanly, not soiling\r\nthe carpets and drapery. The fire is very easily kept up, and a grate\r\nneeds to be filled only two or three times during the whole twentyfour\r\nhours, to maintain a fire night and day. The servants, whom it spares\r\na great deal of trouble, prefer it, and on this point, as on several\r\nothers, their opinion is more important than that of their masters.\r\nThe only inconvenience attending it is, that it sometimes diffuses a\r\nsulphurous smell. It is also beginning to take the place of wood in the\r\nsteamboats. The anthracite trade has, therefore, become considerable,\r\nand several canals and railroads have been made or are making, to\r\ntransport the fuel from the mines to the points of consumption.\r\n\r\nThe principal of these lines are the following: 1. The Schuylkill\r\ncanal, which extends from Philadelphia to the vicinity of the mines\r\nabout the head of the Schuylkill. Its length from Philadelphia to Port\r\nCarbon, is 108 miles; it cost, inclusive of the double locks, 3,000,000\r\ndollars, or 28,000 dollars a mile, and yields a net income of 20 to 25\r\nper cent.; 400,000 tons of coal are annually brought down upon it. 2.\r\nThe Lehigh canal runs from the Delaware to the mines near the heads of\r\nthe Lehigh; it is 46 miles long, and cost 1,560,000 dollars, or 34,000\r\ndollars a mile. 3. The lateral canal along the Delaware starts from\r\nEaston, at the mouth of the Lehigh, and ends at Bristol, the head of\r\nnavigation for sea-vessels. It transports to Philadelphia, the coal\r\nthat is brought down the Lehigh canal; it is 60 miles long, and cost\r\n1,238,000 dollars, or 20,600 dollars a mile. This work was executed by\r\nthe State of Pennsylvania, and has been before enumerated among the\r\nState works. 4. The Morris canal starts from Easton, and ends at Jersey\r\nCity, opposite New York. It serves to supply the New York market with\r\ncoal. The change of level is here for the most part effected, not by\r\nlocks, but by inclined planes, the operation of which is very simple;\r\nthe length of this work is 102 miles, cost 2,650,000 dollars, or 25,000\r\ndollars a mile. 5. The Delaware and Hudson canal extends from the\r\nRoundout creek on the Hudson, near Kingston, 90 miles above New York,\r\nto the anthracite mines near the upper Delaware. The coal is brought\r\ndown to the canal, at Honesdale, from the mountains, at Carbondale,\r\non a railroad 16 miles in length; the canal is 109 miles long, and\r\ncost 2,250,000 dollars or 20,000 dollars a mile; the railroad cost\r\n300,000 dollars or 17,500 dollars a mile. 6. The Pottsville and Sunbury\r\nrailroad is designed to bring down to the Schuylkill the products of\r\nthe mines lying in the heart of the mountains between the Susquehanna\r\nand the heads of the Schuylkill. It is remarkable for the boldness\r\nof the inclined planes, some of which have an inclination of 25 and\r\n33 per cent., and which are worked by very ingenious and economical\r\ncontrivances. It is 45 miles in length, and cost 1,120,000 dollars, or\r\n25,000 dollars a mile. 7. The Philadelphia and Reading railroad, now\r\nin progress, will enter into competition with the Schuylkill canal; it\r\nis 56 miles in length, and cost, including the necessary apparatus,\r\n26,300 dollars a mile. It is proposed to continue it to Pottsville,\r\n35 miles from Reading; there would then be a continuous railroad from\r\nPhiladelphia to the centre of the Susquehanna valley.\r\n\r\nBeside these seven great lines, several mining companies have\r\nconstructed various railways of less importance, which branch from\r\nthem in different directions. At the end of 1834, there were 165 miles\r\nof these smaller works, constructed at an expense of about 1,125,000\r\ndollars, which, added to the 542 miles, and 13,280,000 of the seven\r\nworks above enumerated, gives a total of 707 miles and 14,400,000\r\ndollars, or deducting the Delaware canal, which has been before\r\nreckoned, of 647 miles and 13,162,000 dollars. The aggregate length\r\nof all the works which I have already enumerated, including only those\r\nthat are finished or far advanced, is 3,025 miles of canal, and 1,825\r\nmiles of railroad, made at a cost of above 112 millions. If we add\r\nseveral detached works, such as the Ithaca and Owego, the Lexington\r\nand Louisville, the Tuscumbia and Decatur (Alabama) railroads, and\r\nvarious canals in New England, Pennsylvania, Georgia, &c., we shall\r\nhave a total of 3,250 miles of canal, and 2,000 miles of railroad,\r\nconstructed at an expense of upwards of 120 million dollars. (See _Note\r\n22_.) The impulse is, therefore, given, the movement goes on with\r\nincreasing speed, the whole country is becoming covered with works in\r\nevery direction. If I were to attempt to enumerate all the railroads,\r\nof which the routes are under survey, which have been or are on the\r\npoint of being authorised by charters from the several legislatures,\r\nfor which the subscription is about to be opened, or has already been\r\nfilled up, I should be obliged to mention all the towns in the Union.\r\nA town of 10,000 inhabitants, which has not its railroad, looks upon\r\nitself with that feeling of shame, which our first parents experienced\r\nin the terrestrial paradise, when, after having eaten of the fruit of\r\nthe tree of knowledge, they saw that they were naked.\r\n\r\nI have here spoken of the more perfect means of intercommunication,\r\ncanals and railroads, and not of common roads. If I had undertaken\r\nto speak of these, I should have mentioned at their head, the great\r\nwork called the National or Cumberland road, which, starting from\r\nWashington, or strictly speaking, from Cumberland, on the Potomac,\r\nstrikes the Ohio at Wheeling, and extends westwards, across the\r\ncentre of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, to the Mississippi; it has\r\nbeen constructed wholly at the expense of the Federal government, and\r\nup to the present time there have been expended upon it 5,400,000\r\ndollars. It was begun in 1806, and is now nearly finished to Vandalia\r\nin Illinois. A dispute between Illinois and Missouri in respect to its\r\ntermination, has delayed the completion of the last division. From\r\nWashington to Vandalia, the distance is 800 miles, and from Cumberland\r\nto Vandalia, 675 miles. The doctrine of the unconstitutionality of\r\nCongress engaging in internal improvements having prevailed since the\r\naccession of General Jackson to the presidency, Congress has offered\r\nthe National Road to the States within which it lies, and they have\r\naccepted it on condition of its being first put in a state of perfect\r\nrepair. Several of the States have also spent considerable sums in\r\nimproving the condition of their roads; South Carolina, for instance,\r\nhas devoted about a million and a half to this object.\r\n\r\nThe public works of the United States are generally managed with\r\neconomy, as the statements above made testify; for the cost has been\r\nmuch less than that of similar works in Europe, although the wages\r\nof labour are two or three times higher than on the old continent.\r\nThe canals constructed by the States are, nevertheless, pretty well\r\nfinished; their dimensions are less than those of our canals, but\r\ngreater than those of England; the locks are almost always of hewn\r\nstone.[CI] The bridges, viaducts, and aqueducts are generally wooden\r\nsuperstructures resting on abutments and piers of common masonry.\r\nThe river-dams are always of wood. The railroads constructed by the\r\nStates, those of Pennsylvania in particular, have been built at a great\r\nexpense; they have a double track with stone viaducts and some tunnels;\r\nthe rails are wholly of iron, resting on stone blocks or sleepers. The\r\nLowell railroad company also wished to have their road constructed in\r\nthe most solid manner, and have displayed a luxury of granite, which,\r\nif not injurious, is certainly superfluous. The Baltimore and Ohio\r\nrailroad has two tracks, but except for a short distance is on wood. In\r\nthe Northern States and near the large towns most of the railroads have\r\nan iron edge rail and a roadway prepared for two tracks, but with only\r\none track laid. Such are the Worcester, Providence, and Amboy railways,\r\nand such will be the Philadelphia and Reading road; but the rails rest\r\nupon wooden cross-pieces, which, independently of their cheapness,\r\nhave some advantage over the stone sleepers, in regard to wear of the\r\ncars, superior ease of motion, and greater facility of repairs. Those\r\nrailroads in the North on which there is less travel, and which are\r\nmore remote from the large towns, and all those of the South, have\r\nbut a single track, with no preparation for a second, and consist of\r\nan iron bar, about two inches wide and half an inch thick, resting on\r\nlongitudinal sleepers.\r\n\r\nOn most of the American railroads, the inclinations are much greater\r\nthan what in Europe are usually considered the _maxima_. A rise of 35\r\nfeet to the mile, for instance, seems moderate to American engineers,\r\nand even 50 feet does not frighten them. Experience has shown that\r\nthese inclinations, the latter of which is double of the _maximum_\r\nestablished by our engineers, do not endanger the safety of travellers.\r\nThey do, indeed, diminish the rate of speed, unless additional power\r\nis applied at certain points, to increase the force of traction; but\r\nthe Americans think that these inconveniences are more than overborne\r\nby the reduction of the first cost of construction. The curves are\r\nalso greater; on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, on which locomotives\r\nare used, there are several with a radius of 400 or 500 feet, but\r\nthe consequence is, that on this road the mean rate of speed does\r\nnot exceed 12 or 13 miles an hour, only half as great as that on\r\nthe Liverpool railroad, but twice as great as that of a coach on an\r\nordinary road. In general, however, the American engineers endeavour\r\nto avoid curves of less than 1000 feet radius. In France the Board of\r\nPublic Works (_Ponts et chaussées_), in their surveys and plans, have\r\nfixed upon 2,700 feet as the _minimum_.\r\n\r\nOn some of the American railroads, however, even the rules of European\r\nscience have been exceeded; on the Lowell railroad the _minimum_\r\nradius is 3,000 feet; on the Boston and Providence railroad there is\r\nno curve of a less radius than 6,000 feet. The rate of velocity on the\r\nAmerican railroads is as various as the manner of their construction,\r\nand the amount of their inclinations and curvatures. On the Boston and\r\nLowell road the rate is nearly 25 miles an hour, on the Boston and\r\nProvidence and Worcester roads it is about 20 miles; on the Camden and\r\nAmboy railroad the mean velocity has been reduced to 15 miles; on the\r\nCharleston and Augusta road, it is only about 12, and it is still less\r\non the Baltimore and Ohio railway.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief means of economy in the construction of these works\r\nin this country, is the use of wood for bridges. The Americans are\r\nunequalled in the art of constructing wooden bridges; those of\r\nSwitzerland, about which so much has been said, are clumsy and heavy\r\ncompared with theirs. The American bridges have arches of 100 and 200\r\nfeet span,[CJ] and they are not less remarkable for their cheapness,\r\nthan for their boldness. The bridge over the Susquehanna at Columbia\r\nis 6,000 feet long and cost 130,000 dollars; it is roofed over, has\r\ntwo carriageways and two side-ways for foot passengers. In general\r\nthe wooden superstructure of a covered bridge, with a double carriage\r\nway, may be built at the rate of 8,000 to 14,000 dollars, according to\r\nthe locality and the character of the work, per 600 feet; a similar\r\nstructure with us would be built of hewn stone, and would cost at least\r\n200,000 to 300,000 dollars. The masonry is generally of uncut stone,\r\nor of undressed hewn stone, and is not, therefore, expensive. Three\r\ndifferent plans are followed in the construction of bridges; one is\r\nthat of a carpenter Burr, a second that of Col. Long, and the third,\r\nwhich is the newest, most interesting, and most suitable for railroads,\r\non account of its firmness, is that of Mr Town; they are all remarkable\r\nfor requiring scarcely any iron. There are, however, some bridges\r\nof hewn stone on the American railroads; such is the Thomas Viaduct\r\nover the Patapsco, on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, wholly of fine\r\ngranite; it is 700 feet long, and cost only 120,000 dollars, although\r\nit has two road-ways, and is 60 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty which the Americans encountered in the\r\nexecution of their public works, was not to procure the necessary\r\ncapital, but to find men capable of directing operations. In this\r\nrespect also, New York has done the Union signal service; the\r\nengineers, who were formed by the construction of the Erie canal, have\r\ndiffused the benefits of the experience acquired in that work, over\r\nthe whole country. Mr Wright, the most eminent among them, and still\r\nthe most active of American engineers, notwithstanding his advanced\r\nage, has been engaged in the superintendence of an inconceivable number\r\nof undertakings.[CK] His name is associated with the construction\r\nof canals from the Chesapeake to the Ohio, from the Delaware to the\r\nChesapeake, from the Hudson to the Delaware, from the James to the\r\nKanawha, on the St. Lawrence, and even on the Welland, as well as with\r\nthose of the railroads just mentioned. Within the last ten years the\r\nnumber of able engineers in the United States has become considerable,\r\nand they have written the records of their skill and science on the\r\nsoil of their country. General Bernard contributed not a little\r\nto this result, by carrying with him into the New World the most\r\nimproved processes of European art, and setting an example of their\r\napplication. Mr Moncure Robinson, also a pupil of the French schools\r\nof science, who excels in the art of combining great economy with\r\ngreat solidity and neatness of execution, has constructed the inclined\r\nplanes of the Portage Railroad over the Alleghany, and has built the\r\nChesterfield, Petersburg and Roanoke, the Little Schuylkill, and the\r\nWinchester railroads; he is, at present, engaged on the Pottsville\r\nand Sunbury, the Philadelphia and Reading, and the Fredericksburg\r\nand Richmond roads. Major McNeil has just finished the Boston and\r\nProvidence railway, and is engaged on the Stonington and the Baltimore\r\nand Susquehanna roads. Mr Douglass, after having completed the Morris\r\ncanal, and the Brooklyn and Jamaica railroad, is preparing, for\r\nthe coming season, the operations on the New York water-works. Mr\r\nFessenden, who has executed the Worcester railroad, is now engaged on\r\nthe Eastern and Western railroads on the right and left of Boston. Mr\r\nKnight, the principal engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad,\r\nis occupied in devising plans for topping the Alleghanies. The late\r\nMr Canvass White assisted in the construction of the Louisville and\r\nPortland canal, and had finished the fine canal from the Raritan to the\r\nDelaware, not long before his death. Mr Allen has built the Charleston\r\nand Augusta railroad. Mr Jervis, who is now directing a part of the\r\ngreat works of canalisation in New York, constructed the Carbondale and\r\nHonesdale road.\r\n\r\nTo supply the want of men of science, demanded by the spirit of\r\nenterprise, the Federal government authorises the officers of the\r\nengineer corps and of the topographical engineers to enter into the\r\nservice of the companies. It also employs them itself, in surveying\r\nroutes and preparing plans, or constructing works on its own account.\r\nGeneral Gratiot, the chief engineer, therefore, performs the duties\r\nof president of a board of public works (_directeur-général des\r\nponts et chaussées_). Cols. Albert and Kearney of the topographical\r\nengineers, take an active part in the construction of the great canal\r\nfrom the Chesapeake to the Ohio, of which the Federal government is\r\nthe principal share-holder. Capt. Turnbull superintends the canal from\r\nGeorgetown to Alexandria; Capt. Delafield the works on the National\r\nRoad, and Capt. Talcott the improvements of the navigation of the\r\nHudson. Col. Long passes from route to route, and conducts at one time\r\nthe surveys from Memphis to Savannah, at another those from Portland to\r\nMontreal and Quebec. On the other hand, architects become engineers,\r\nand Mr Strickland of Philadelphia, and Mr Latrobe of Baltimore,\r\nsuperintend the construction of the railroad between these two cities;\r\nand even simple merchants take upon themselves the responsibility of\r\ngreat works, as in the case of Mr Jackson of Boston, who is in fact,\r\nchief engineer of the Lowell railroad.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a young people, executing, in the short space of\r\nfifteen years, a series of works, which the most powerful States of\r\nEurope with a population three or four times as great, would have\r\nshrunk from undertaking, is in truth a noble sight. The advantages\r\nwhich result from these enterprises to the public prosperity are\r\nincalculable, and the political effects are not less important. These\r\nnumerous routes, which are traversed with so much ease and speed,\r\nwill contribute to the maintenance of the Union more than a regularly\r\nbalanced national representation. When New York shall be only six or\r\neight days from New Orleans, not merely for a class of the rich and\r\nprivileged, but for every citizen, every labourer, a separation will be\r\nimpossible. Distance will be annihilated, and this colossus, ten times\r\ngreater than France, will preserve its unity without an effort.[CL]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to turn back my thoughts to Europe, and to make a\r\ncomparison, by no means favorable to the great kingdoms which occupy\r\nit. The partisans of the monarchical principle maintain, that it is\r\nas powerful in promoting the greatness and welfare of peoples, and\r\nthe progress of the human race, as the principle of independence and\r\nself-government, which prevails on this side the Atlantic. For myself,\r\nI believe them to be in the right; but it is necessary that some\r\ntangible proofs of the correctness of their opinion should be given,\r\nif we do not wish that the contrary doctrine should make proselytes.\r\nIt is by the fruits that the tree must be judged. Now the European\r\ngovernments dispose of the property and the persons of more than 250\r\nmillions of men, that is, of a population twenty times more numerous\r\nthan that of the United States at the time these great works were\r\nbegun. The extent of territory which demands their care, is not quite\r\nfour times as great as that at present occupied by the States and the\r\norganised Territories. The millions which the European nations raise so\r\neasily for war, that is to say, to destroy and slaughter each other,\r\nwould not certainly be wanting to their princes for the execution\r\nof useful enterprises. The latter have only to will it, and all the\r\npeoples of Europe will be so completely blended together in interests,\r\nfeelings, and opinions, that the whole continent would be like a single\r\nstate, and a European war would be looked upon as no less sacrilegious\r\nthan a civil war. By putting off the day of these useful works, do not\r\nthe sovereigns give countenance to the reasonings of those, who assert\r\nthat the cause of kings is irreconcileable with the cause of nations?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[BF] Arkansas became a State in 1836. [It is a strange oversight of the\r\nauthor to say, that Missouri is the only State west of the Mississippi,\r\nwhen nearly the whole of Louisiana is on its right bank. Neither is it\r\ncorrect to say, that Missouri is one of the least important States.\r\nIn point of territorial extent, geographical position, agricultural\r\nresources, and mineral wealth, she is one of the most important,\r\nand even in point of population, which is increasing with great\r\nrapidity, is little behind many of her sisters. The Territory of Iowa,\r\nestablished in 1837, on the north of Missouri, has now about 30,000\r\ninhabitants, and is rapidly filling with settlers.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[BG] This difficulty is almost wholly, if not quite, remedied by\r\nice-boats.\r\n\r\n[BH] In 1792 the New York legislature incorporated two companies, the\r\nWestern and the Northern Inland Lock Navigation companies, which,\r\nhowever, did nothing of importance, the former with authority to\r\nconnect the Hudson by the Mohawk with Seneca Lake and Lake Ontario, the\r\nlatter to form a junction between the Hudson and Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\n[BI] By Mr Baldwin, father of the late Loammi Baldwin, who constructed\r\nthe dry docks at Charlestown and Gosport.\r\n\r\n[BJ] The official statements of the Canal Board, Feb. 23, 1837, are\r\nhere given instead of those of M. Chevalier. The statement in the text\r\ndoes not include the Black River Canal and the Genesee Valley Canal,\r\nbegun in 1837, with a total length of 168 miles, exclusive of 40 miles\r\nof improved navigation in the Black River; estimated cost, 3,000,000\r\ndollars.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[BK] Michigan became a State in 1837, at which time it had a population\r\nof 175,000 souls.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[BL] The increase of the population has since been at a still more\r\nrapid rate; from 1830 to 1835, the number of inhabitants increased\r\nfrom 203,000 to 270,000, or including Brooklyn, from 218,000 to\r\n294,000.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[BM] It is 40 feet wide on the surface and 4 feet deep; the locks are\r\n95 feet long and 15 wide. The Languedoc Canal is 90 feet wide, and 6\r\n1-2 feet deep, with locks 115 feet long, 36 feet wide in the centre,\r\nand 18 at each end. The English Canals are generally of about the\r\ndimensions of the Erie Canal.\r\n\r\n[BN] The legislature incorporated the company on the express condition\r\nthat they should transport only travellers and their baggage.\r\nNotwithstanding this provision, when the books were opened, seven times\r\nthe amount of capital needed was subscribed; the sum required was\r\n2,000,000 dollars; the amount of subscriptions 14,000,000.\r\n\r\n[BO] Several links in this chain between Auburn and Utica on one side,\r\nand Rochester on the other, are already completed.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[BP] In the session of 1836, the legislature authorised a loan of the\r\ncredit of the State for the sum of 3,000,000 dollars to the company;\r\nthe estimated cost of the road is 6,000,000. This road terminates at\r\nTappan Sloat on the Hudson.\r\n\r\n[BQ] The maximum of inclination allowed by our _Administration des\r\nPonts-et-Chaussées_ (board of public works) is 1/200; in the great\r\nlines executed at the expense of government, the inclination has\r\ngenerally been kept below 1/333, which is the maximum adopted in the\r\nfine railroad from London to Birmingham.\r\n\r\n[BR] In 1836 the Maryland legislature voted the sum of 8,000,000\r\ndollars in aid of public works, of which 3,000,000 were appropriated to\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and 3,000,000 to the Chesapeake and\r\nOhio Canal, and rest is divided between several works, one of which is\r\nintended to connect Annapolis, the capital, with the Potomac. Baltimore\r\nhas also subscribed 3,000,000 dollars towards aiding the completion of\r\nthe railroad. [Virginia and Wheeling have also subscribed 1,000,000\r\neach for the same object, and so far from being come to a stand, the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio railroad is now pushed on with great vigour towards\r\nCumberland.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[BS] In 1836, the construction of this road has been authorised by\r\nthe legislatures of Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South\r\nCarolina. The surveys have been completed, the route fixed upon, and\r\na board organised for pushing the work with vigour. Mr Hayne, late a\r\nSenator in Congress, and since governor of South Carolina, and one of\r\nthe most highly respected men in the country, is president. Including\r\nthe two branches, one to Louisville, and one to Maysville, the whole\r\nlength of the road will be 700 miles; the estimated cost is 11,870,000\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n[BT] [Two great works are now actively pushed on in Georgia, which\r\nwill form another connection between the Mississippi Valley and the\r\nAtlantic; these are the Central railroad from Savannah to Decatur, 285\r\nmiles, and the Georgia railroad from Augusta to the same place, 160\r\nmiles in length; the Main Trunk of the Atlantic and Western railroad\r\nis the common continuation of these two roads from Decatur to the\r\nTennessee, a distance of 120 miles. These works are already in a state\r\nof forwardness, and a third, the Brunswick and Florida railroad,\r\nnow under survey, will extend from Brunswick to the head of the\r\nAppalachicola, and connect the southernmost part of the western valley\r\nwith the Atlantic. In North Carolina, beside the Raleigh and Gaston\r\nrailroad, the railroad from the Roanoke to Wilmington is now nearly\r\ncompleted. As steam-packets run from Wilmington to Charleston, and the\r\nChattahoochee is already connected with Montgomery, which stands at\r\nthe head of steamboat navigation on the Alabama, the continuation of\r\nthe Central railroad from Decatur to the Chattahoochee, a distance of\r\n80 miles, is all that is wanted to complete the communication between\r\nBoston and New Orleans by railroads and steamboats.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[BU] These grants of land are generally made so that every other\r\nsection (of six miles square) along the line of the work is retained by\r\nCongress, and the rest are given to the State or company constructing\r\nthe canal. Sometimes, however, a certain number of acres in some other\r\nquarter is granted outright.\r\n\r\n[BV] No one can look at a map of the United States without being struck\r\nby the appearance of the right lines, constituting the frontiers of\r\nmost of the States; this method of bounding a territory by meridians\r\nand parallels of latitude is absurd, since it requires an infinite\r\nnumber of geodesic operations, which have not been executed, and cannot\r\nbe so for a long time. Meridians and parallels do very well for the\r\ndivisions of the heavens; but for the earth, there are no suitable\r\nboundaries but the beds of rivers, or water-sheds in the mountain\r\nchains.\r\n\r\n[BW] By the act establishing the State of Michigan (1836), Congress has\r\nannexed this disputed belt to Ohio. [The whole line of this great work\r\nis now nearly completed.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[BX] The work was begun on the canal, July 4, 1836; it is six feet\r\ndeep, and 60 feet wide at top; estimated cost 8,654,300 dollars. [The\r\nprogress of population in that region within the last two years has\r\ngiven rise to new and very important projects. One of these is a canal\r\nconnecting the Rock River with Lake Michigan, at Milwaukie, and the\r\nother is the junction of the Wisconsin with the Fox River of Green\r\nBay, thus adding two links to the chain of communication between the\r\nMississippi and St. Lawrence valleys.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[BY] In 1836, the legislature of Indiana adopted a general system\r\nof public works, for the execution of which it authorised a loan of\r\n10,000,000 dollars. The system embraces the canalisation of the Wabash\r\nand White River, the connection of the Wabash with the Maumee, and of\r\nLake Michigan with the same river by canals, and a canal across the\r\ncentre of the State from Evansville by Indianapolis to the Wabash and\r\nErie canal. Appropriations were made by the same law for railroads\r\nfrom Madison and Jeffersonville on the Ohio to the Wabash canal, and\r\nin aid of the Lawrenceburg and Indianapolis railroad which has been\r\nundertaken by a company. [The State of Illinois has also made provision\r\nfor a series of public works on an equally liberal scale; an act of\r\n1837 establishes a Board of Public Works and an Internal Improvement\r\nFund, and provides for the construction of a railroad across the\r\nState from north to south, reaching from the junction of the Ohio and\r\nMississippi by Vandalia and Peru to Galena, being about 460 miles in\r\nlength; of four roads crossing the State from east to west, namely,\r\nfrom Shawneetown on the Ohio to Alton on the Mississippi, from Mt.\r\nCarmel on the Wabash to Alton, from Terre Haute on the Wabash to Alton,\r\nand from Covington on the Wabash to Quincy on the Mississippi, and of\r\nanother cross road from Bloomington, in the centre of the State to\r\nWarsaw on the Mississippi. These works are now in active progress, as\r\nare also some works for improving the navigation of the Illinois, Rock\r\nRiver, Kaskaskia and Little Wabash. The youthful State of Michigan has\r\nfollowed the example of these elder sisters, by establishing a Board of\r\nPublic Works, and directing the construction of three railroads across\r\nthe peninsula, from Monroe, Detroit, and Huron to Lake Michigan, and a\r\ncanal from the river Saginaw of Lake Huron to the Grand River of Lake\r\nMichigan. There are also several railroads executed by companies in\r\nMichigan.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[BZ] [This work was completed in the spring of 1838, at which time\r\nseveral steamboats passed wholly through the place formerly occupied by\r\nthe raft. The removal of that obstruction, has extended the navigation\r\nby steamboats 750 miles on the Red River, exclusive of 600 miles on\r\nseveral branches.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CA] It is 50 feet wide at bottom and 200 feet at top, and has four\r\nlocks, 170 feet long by 50 wide.\r\n\r\n[CB] It is from 65 to 75 feet wide at top, and 7 feet deep. The locks\r\nare well constructed, and very expeditiously worked.\r\n\r\n[CC] [The link between New Brunswick and Trenton has since been\r\nauthorised by the State and constructed.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CD] [The Baltimore and Philadelphia, Fredericksburg and Roanoke, and\r\nPortsmouth and Roanoke railroads have since been completed.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CE] It will be easy to construct a branch from the Charleston and\r\nAugusta railroad to Columbia, and the route has been surveyed. [This\r\nbranch is now in progress, and as the Raleigh and Gaston railroad, from\r\nthe Roanoke to Raleigh, is also nearly completed, there remains only\r\nthe link between Raleigh and Columbia not yet undertaken.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CF] [A prolongation of the Georgia railroad to Decatur, 160 miles from\r\nAugusta, is already in progress, and the Montgomery and Chattahoochee\r\nrailroad, extending from West Point on the latter to the river Alabama,\r\nforms another link in the chain between Boston or rather Bangor and New\r\nOrleans.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CG] During the session of 1836 the legislature of Massachusetts\r\nsubscribed 1,000,000 in aid of the Western Railroad; this measure was\r\nthe first step taken by the State in the promotion of public works,\r\nand indicates a complete revolution in its policy on this point.\r\n[This act was immediately followed by similar acts in aid of the\r\nseveral other railroads now in progress in the State, and in 1838, by\r\na further grant of the credit of the State to the Western Railroad\r\nto the amount of 1,200,000 dollars. That work will be completed to\r\nSpringfield in October (1839), and the section between Springfield and\r\nWest Stockbridge is already far advanced towards its completion. The\r\nLowell railroad has been extended to Nashua, and an eastern branch is\r\nnow completed to Haverhill, of which a continuation towards Exeter is\r\nnow in progress.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CH] [To these should be added the railroads from Newark to Morristown,\r\nand from Elizabethtown to Somerville, both intersecting the New\r\nBrunswick railroad, and extending into a fine farming country. The\r\nBrooklyn railroad has also been continued about 20 miles beyond\r\nJamaica.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CI] On some of the canals the locks are partly of wood and partly of\r\nstone; these composite locks are economical and easily kept in repair,\r\nand deserve to be introduced in other countries. On many canals the\r\nlocks are wholly of wood.\r\n\r\n[CJ] The bridge over the Schuylkill at Philadelphia consists of a\r\nsingle arch of 300 feet span. [This beautiful structure has lately been\r\ndestroyed by fire.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[CK] At this very time, Mr Wright, in spite of his 60 years, is\r\ndirecting in person the Harlæm railroad, the great New York and Erie\r\nroad, the great work of connecting the James and Kanawha, by a railroad\r\nand canal, the works going on along the St. Lawrence in Upper Canada,\r\n750 miles further north, and the railway from Havana to Guines in\r\nthe islands of Cuba. The aggregate length of all these works is 870\r\nmiles. The most eminent engineers have always several works under their\r\ndirection at once; it is understood, of course, that they are aided by\r\nskilful and intelligent assistants, who do most of the work.\r\n\r\n[CL] The lowest rate of speed on a railroad can be hardly less than 15\r\nmiles an hour, or about three times greater than the ordinary speed\r\nof the stage-coaches in France and America. At this rate, a country\r\nwith railroads, nine times larger than France, would be on the same\r\nfooting in respect to intercommunication, as France without railroads;\r\nsupposing a velocity of 25 miles an hour, or five times greater\r\nthan that of the coaches, the proportion would then stand as one to\r\ntwentyfive, and a territory four and a half times greater than western\r\nEurope, or five times greater than that included within the limits\r\nof the 27 States, would be as easily and as promptly administered as\r\nFrance is at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.\r\n\r\nLABOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LANCASTER, (PENNSYLVANIA,) JULY 20, 1835.\r\n\r\nThere can be no success without special devotion to some one end;\r\nindividual or nation, to be successful and prosperous, beware of\r\nattempting every thing. Human nature is finite, and, like it, you must\r\nset some bounds to your wishes and efforts. Learn how to check yourself\r\nand to be content, is the precept of wisdom. If it is a wise rule,\r\nthen are the Americans, at least partially, wise, for they practise it\r\npartially. In general, the American is little disposed to be contented;\r\nhis idea of equality is to be inferior to none, but he endeavours to\r\nrise only in one direction. His only means, and the object of his\r\nwhole thought, is to subdue the material world, or, in other words,\r\nit is industry in its various branches, business, speculation, work,\r\naction. To this sole object every thing is made subordinate, education,\r\npolitics, private and public life. Every thing in American society,\r\nfrom religion and morals to domestic usages and daily habits of life,\r\nis bent in the direction of this common aim of each and all. If there\r\nare some exceptions to this general rule, they are few, and may be\r\nreferred to two causes; first, American society, exclusive as it is,\r\nis not destined to remain forever imprisoned in this narrow circle,\r\nand it already contains the germs of its future condition ages hence,\r\nwhatever that may be; and secondly, human nature, although bounded, is\r\nnot exclusive, and no force in the world can stifle its eternal protest\r\nagainst exclusiveness in taste, institutions, and manners. Speculation\r\nand business, work and action, these, then, under various forms, make\r\nthe exclusive object to which the Americans have devoted themselves,\r\nwith a zeal that amounts to fanaticism; this was marked out for them by\r\nthe finger of Providence, in order that a continent should be brought\r\nunder the dominion of civilisation with the least possible delay.\r\n\r\nI cannot reflect without sorrow, that at one moment France seem called\r\nto take part in this great mission with the two nations, between\r\nwhom God has placed it, not less morally in regard to character and\r\ninstitutions, than physically in respect to geographical position;\r\nnamely the English and Spaniards. Whilst Spain, then queen of the\r\nworld, grasped South America and the vast empire of Mexico, civilised,\r\nsword in hand, the native tribes, and built those monumental cities,\r\nwhich will bear witness to its genius and its power, ages after\r\nthe calumnies of its slanderers shall have been forgotten, whilst\r\nEngland was planting some insignificant colonies on the barren shore\r\nof North America, France was exploring the vast basin of the Father\r\nof Waters, and taking possession of the St. Lawrence, compared with\r\nwhich our Rhine, _tranquille et fier_, is but a modest rivulet: we\r\nwere crowning with fortifications the steep rock of Quebec, building\r\nMontreal, founding New Orleans and St. Louis, and here and there\r\nsubduing the rich plains of Illinois. At that time, we were occupying\r\nthe most fertile, best watered, and finest portion of North America,\r\nthe part best suited to become the seat of a magnificent empire, in\r\nharmony with our notions of unity. Our engineers, with a sagacity for\r\nwhich the Americans now express the greatest admiration, had marked\r\nout by fortresses, the sites most suitable for large towns. Our flag\r\nfloated over Pittsburg, then Fort Duquesne, Detroit, Chicago, Erie,\r\nthen Presqu'île, Kingston, then Fort Frontenac, Michillimackinac,\r\nTiconderoga, Vincennes, Fort Charters, Peoria, and St. John, as well\r\nas over the capitals of Canada, and Louisiana. Then our language might\r\nhave set up its claim to be the universal language; the French name\r\nbade fair to become the first, not only in the world of ideas, by art\r\nand letters, like the Greek; but also in the material and political\r\nworld, by the number of individuals who would take pride in bearing it,\r\nby the immensity of the territory over which its dominion stretched,\r\nlike the Roman. Louis XIV. in the days of his deification, in the\r\nOlympus which he had built himself, meditated this noble destiny for\r\nhis people and his race. With a lofty pride, he seemed to read their\r\nfuture triumphs on the pages of fate. But there is left to us, who\r\nare separated from him only by a single century, there is left, alas!\r\nnought but vain and impotent regrets. The English have driven us\r\nforever, not only from America, but also from the East Indies, where\r\nthat great prince had given us a footing. The descendants of our\r\nfathers in Canada and Louisiana struggle in vain against the British\r\nflood that swallows them up; our language is whelmed in the same\r\ndeluge; even our names for the cities we founded and the regions we\r\ndiscovered, are corrupted in the harsh throats of our fortunate rivals,\r\nand are too Saxonised to be any longer recognised. We have ourselves\r\nforgotten, that there was ever a time when we could have claimed to\r\nrule the New World; we no longer remember the generous men who devoted\r\nthemselves, that they might secure the dominion to us. To preserve the\r\nname of the heroic La Salle from oblivion, it has become necessary that\r\nthe American Congress should raise a monument to his memory in the\r\nrotunda of the Capital, between those to William Penn and John Smith.\r\nWe have had no stone for him among all our innumerable sculptures; our\r\npainters have covered miles of canvass with their colours, but have not\r\ndrawn a line in honour of him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the gigantic upstarts of Europe defy us, elbow us, and crowd\r\nus in. In vain did the genius of the the second Charlemagne restore\r\nto us the capital of the first Frank Kaiser, and the finest provinces\r\nof Clovis; capital and provinces have been snatched from us almost\r\nimmediately. One step more downward, and we should have been forever\r\nforced back among the secondary states, the worn out and decrepit\r\nnations, with no successors to receive and sustain with honor the\r\ninheritance of our fathers' glories. What is it that has thus degraded\r\na great people, and robbed it of its well-earned future? In an absolute\r\nmonarchy like ours, it was enough, that we should be ridden by such a\r\nprince as Louis XV., who had inherited nothing from his great ancestor\r\nbut his vices; it was enough, that during fifty years, France was the\r\nplaything of his infamous selfishness, and of the shameful imbecility\r\nof his creatures. Absolute governments may sometimes produce wonders\r\nin a short space of time, but they are exposed to cruel reverses. Had\r\nwe been the conquerors in America, instead of having been conquered by\r\nthe English, what would have been the consequences? To judge what the\r\npeople of New France would have been, by what the Canadians and the\r\nCreoles of Louisiana are, the boldness and rapidity of the progress\r\nof civilisation would have been much less than it has been. When it\r\nis proposed to conquer nations on the field of battle, France may\r\nenter the lists with confidence; but when it is proposed to subdue\r\nnature, the Englishman is our superior. He has firmer sinews and more\r\nvigourous muscle; physically he is better made for labour; he carries\r\nit on with more perseverance and method; he becomes interested in it,\r\nand obstinately bent upon it. If he meets any obstacle in his task, he\r\nattacks it with the devouring passion which a Frenchman can feel only\r\nin the presence of an adversary in a human form.\r\n\r\nWith what zeal and devotion has the Anglo-American fulfilled his\r\nmission as a pioneer in a new continent! Behold how he makes his way\r\nover the rocks and precipices; see how he struggles in close fight\r\nwith the rivers, with the swamps, with the primeval forests; see how\r\nhe slaughters the wolf and the bear, how he exterminates the Indian,\r\nwho in his eyes is only another wild beast! In this conflict with\r\nthe external world, with the land and the waters, with mountains and\r\npestilential marshes, he appears full of that impetuosity with which\r\nGreece flung itself into Asia at the voice of Alexander; of that\r\nfanatical daring with which Mahomet inspired his Arabs for the conquest\r\nof the Eastern Empire; of that delirious courage which animated our\r\nfathers forty years ago, when they threw themselves upon Europe. On the\r\nsame rivers, therefore, on which our colonists floated, carelessly\r\nsinging, in the bark canoe of the savage, they have launched fleets\r\nof superb steamers. Where we fraternised with the Red Skins, sleeping\r\nwith them in the forests, living like them on the chase, travelling,\r\nin their manner, through rugged trails afoot, the persevering American\r\nhas felled the aged trees, guided the plough, inclosed the fields,\r\nsubstituted the best breeds of English cattle for the wild deer,\r\ncreated farms, flourishing villages, and opulent cities, dug canals,\r\nand made roads. Those waterfalls which we admired as lovers of the\r\npicturesque, and the height of which our officers measured at the risk\r\nof their lives, he has shut up for the use of his mills and factories,\r\nregardless of the scenery. If these countries had continued to belong\r\nto the French, the population would certainly have been more gay than\r\nthe present American race; it would have enjoyed more highly, whatever\r\nit should have possessed, but it would have had less of comfort and\r\nwealth, and ages would have passed away, before man had become master\r\nof those regions, which have been reclaimed in less than fifty years by\r\nthe Americans.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the acts passed by the local legislatures at each\r\nsession, we shall find that at least three-fourths relate to the\r\nbanks, which give credit to the working men; to the establishment of\r\nnew religious societies and churches, which are the citadels where the\r\nguardians of industry keep watch; to routes and means of communication,\r\nroads, canals, railways, bridges, and steamboats, which facilitate\r\nthe access of the producer to the markets; to primary instruction\r\nfor the use of the mechanic and the labourer; to various commercial\r\nregulations; or to the incorporation of towns and villages, the work\r\nof these hardy pioneers. There is no mention of an army; the fine\r\narts are not so much as named; literary institutions and the higher\r\nscientific studies are rarely honoured with notice. The tendency of\r\nthe laws is above all to promote industry, material labour, the task\r\nof the moment. In the older States, they always profess the greatest\r\nrespect for property, because the legislature feels that the greatest\r\nencouragement to industry is to respect its fruits. They are especially\r\nconservative of landed property, either from a lingering remembrance of\r\nthe feudal laws of the mother country, or because they are anxious to\r\npreserve some element of stability in the midst of the general change;\r\nyet the laws generally pay less regard to the rights of property than\r\nis the case in Europe. Wo to whatever is inactive and unproductive,\r\nif it can be accused, on however slight a foundation, of resting upon\r\nmonopoly and privilege! The rights of industry here have the precedence\r\nof all others, efface all others, and it is on this account, that,\r\nexcept in in the affair of public credit, in which the towns and States\r\npique themselves on the most scrupulous exactness in fulfilling their\r\nengagements, in every dispute between the capitalists and the producer,\r\nthe latter has almost always the better.\r\n\r\nEvery thing is here arranged to facilitate industry; the towns\r\nare built on the English plan; men of business, instead of being\r\nscattered over the town, occupy a particular quarter, which is\r\ndevoted exclusively to them, in which there is not a building used as\r\na dwelling-house, and nothing but offices and warehouses are to be\r\nseen. The brokers, bankers, and lawyers here have their cells, the\r\nmerchants their counting-rooms; here the banks, insurance offices, and\r\nother companies, have their chambers, and other buildings are filled\r\nfrom cellar to garret with articles of merchandise. At any hour, one\r\nmerchant has but a few steps to go after any other, after a broker or a\r\nlawyer. This, it will be seen, is not according to the Paris fashion,\r\nby which a great deal of precious time is lost by men of business\r\nin running after one another; in this respect, Paris is the worst\r\narranged commercial city in the world. New York is, however inferior in\r\nthis particular to London or Liverpool; it has nothing like the great\r\ndocks and the Commercial House.\r\n\r\nThe manners and customs are altogether those of a working, busy\r\nsociety. At the age of fifteen years, a man is engaged in business;\r\nat twenty-one he is established, he has his farm, his workshop, his\r\ncounting-room, or his office, in a word his employment, whatever it\r\nmay be. He now also takes a wife, and at twentytwo is the father of\r\na family, and consequently has a powerful stimulus to excite him to\r\nindustry. A man who has no profession, and, which is nearly the same\r\nthing, who is not married, enjoys little consideration; he, who is\r\nan active and useful member of society, who contributes his share to\r\naugment the national wealth and increase the numbers of the population,\r\nhe only is looked upon with respect and favour. The American is\r\neducated with the idea that he will have some particular occupation,\r\nthat he is to be a farmer, artisan, manufacturer, merchant, speculator,\r\nlawyer, physician, or minister, perhaps all in succession, and that,\r\nif he is active and intelligent, he will make his fortune. He has no\r\nconception of living without a profession, even when his family is\r\nrich, for he sees nobody about him, not engaged in business. The man of\r\nleisure is a variety of the human species, of which the Yankee does not\r\nsuspect the existence, and he knows that if rich to-day, his father may\r\nbe ruined tomorrow. Besides the father himself is engaged in business,\r\naccording to custom, and does not think of dispossessing himself of\r\nhis fortune; if the son wishes to have one at present, let him make it\r\nhimself!\r\n\r\nThe habits of life are those of an exclusively working people. From\r\nthe moment he gets up, the American is at his work, and he is engaged\r\nin it till the hour of sleep. Pleasure is never permitted to interrupt\r\nhis business; public affairs only have the right to occupy a few\r\nmoments. Even meal-time is not for him a period of relaxation, in\r\nwhich his wearied mind seeks repose in the bosom of his friends; it\r\nis only a disagreeable interruption of business, an interruption to\r\nwhich he yields because it cannot be avoided, but which he abridges\r\nas much as possible. In the evening, if no political meeting requires\r\nhis attendance, if he does not go to discuss some question of public\r\ninterest, or to a religious meeting, he sits at home, thoughtful and\r\nabsorbed in his meditations, whether on the transactions of the day\r\nor the projects of the morrow. He refrains from business on Sunday,\r\nbecause his religion commands it, but it also requires him to abstain\r\nfrom all amusement and recreation, music, cards, dice, or billiards,\r\nunder penalty of sacrilege. On Sunday an American would not venture to\r\nreceive his friends; his servants would not consent to it, and he can\r\nhardly secure their services for himself, at their own hour, on that\r\nday. A few days since, the mayor of New York was _accused_ by one of\r\nthe newspapers of having entertained on Sunday some English noblemen,\r\nwho came out in their own yacht to give the American democracy a\r\nstrange idea of British tastes. The mayor hastened to declare publicly,\r\nthat he was too well acquainted with his duties as a Christian to\r\nentertain his friends on the _Sabbath_. Nothing is therefore, more\r\nmelancholy than the seventh day in this country; after such a Sunday,\r\nthe labour of Monday is a delightful pastime.\r\n\r\nApproach an English merchant in his counting-room in the morning, and\r\nyou will find him stiff and dry, answering you only by monosyllables;\r\naccost him at the hour of closing the mails, he will be at no pains to\r\nconceal his impatience; he will dismiss you without always taking care\r\nto do it politely. The same man, in his drawing-room in the evening, or\r\nat his country-house in summer, will be full of courtesy and attention\r\ntowards you. The Englishman divides his time, and does but one thing\r\nat once; in the morning he is wholly absorbed in business; in the\r\nevening he plays the man of leisure, reposing and enjoying life; he\r\nis a gentleman, having before his eyes, in the English aristocracy, a\r\nperfect model to form his manners, and to teach him how to spend his\r\nfortune with dignity and grace. The modern Frenchman is a confused\r\nmixture of the Englishman of the evening and the Englishman of the\r\nmorning; in the morning a little of the former, in the evening a little\r\nof the latter. The old French model was the former, or rather, to do\r\neach one justice, was the original after which the English aristocracy\r\nhas formed itself. The American of the North and the Northwest, whose\r\ncharacter now gives the tone in the United States, is permanently a man\r\nof business, he is always the Englishman of the morning. You find many\r\nof the Englishmen of the evening on the plantations of the South, and\r\nsome are beginning to be met with in the great cities of the North.\r\n\r\nTall, slender, and light of figure, the American seems built expressly\r\nfor labour; he has no equal for despatch of business. Nobody also\r\ncan conform so easily to new situations and circumstances; he is\r\nalways ready to adopt new processes and implements, or to change\r\nhis occupation. He is a mechanic by nature; among us there is not a\r\nschoolboy who has not made a _vaudeville_, a ballad, or a republican or\r\nmonarchical constitution; in Massachusetts and Connecticut, there is\r\nnot a labourer who has not invented a machine or a tool. There is not\r\na man of much consideration, who has not his scheme for a railroad, a\r\nproject for a village or a town, or who has not _in petto_ some grand\r\nspeculation in the drowned lands of Red River, in the cotton lands of\r\nthe Yazoo, or in the corn fields of Illinois. Eminently a pioneer, the\r\nAmerican who is not more or less Europeanised, the pure Yankee in a\r\nword, is not only a working man, but he is a migratory one. He has\r\nno root in the soil, he has no feeling of reverence and love for the\r\nnatal spot and the paternal roof; he is always disposed to emigrate,\r\nalways ready to start in the first steamer that comes along, from the\r\nplace where he had but just now landed. He is devoured with a passion\r\nfor locomotion, he cannot stay in one place; he must go and come, he\r\nmust stretch his limbs and keep his muscles in play. When his feet are\r\nnot in motion, his fingers must be in action, he must be whittling a\r\npiece of wood, cutting the back of his chair, or notching the edge of\r\nthe table, or his jaws must be at work grinding tobacco. Whether it be\r\nthat a continual competition has given him the habit, or that he has\r\nan exaggerated estimate of the value of time, or that the unsettled\r\nstate of everything around him keeps his nervous system in a state of\r\nperpetual agitation, or that he has come thus from the hands of nature,\r\nhe always has something to be done, he is always in a terrible hurry.\r\nHe is fit for all sorts of work, except those which require slow and\r\nminute processes. The idea of these fills him with horror; it is his\r\nhell. \"We are born in haste,\" says an American writer, \"we finish our\r\neducation on the run; we marry on the wing; we make a fortune at a\r\nstroke, and lose it in the same manner, to make and lose it again ten\r\ntimes over, in the twinkling of an eye. Our body is a locomotive, going\r\nat the rate of twentyfive miles an hour; our soul, a high-pressure\r\nengine; our life is like a shooting star, and death overtakes us at\r\nlast like a flash of lightning.\"[CM]\r\n\r\n\"Work,\" says American society to the poor man; \"work, and at eighteen\r\nyears of age, although a mere workman, you shall get more than\r\na captain in Europe. You shall live in plenty, be well-clothed,\r\nwell-lodged, and be able to lay up a part of your earnings. Be\r\nattentive to your work, be sober and religious, and you will find a\r\ndevoted and submissive partner of your fortunes; you shall have a more\r\ncomfortable home, than many of the higher classes of the commonalty\r\nin Europe. From a journeyman, you will become a master; you will have\r\napprentices and dependents under you in turn; you shall have credit\r\nwithout stint; you shall become a manufacturer or agriculturist on\r\na great scale; you shall speculate and become rich; you shall found\r\na town and give it your own name; you shall be a member of the\r\nlegislature of the State, or alderman of the city, and finally member\r\nof Congress; your son will have as good a chance to be made President\r\nas the son of the President himself. Work, and if the fortune of\r\nbusiness should be against you, and you fall, you will soon be able to\r\nrise again; for a failure is nothing but a wound in battle; it will not\r\ndeprive you of the esteem or confidence of any one, if you have always\r\nbeen prudent and temperate, a good Christian and a faithful husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Work,\" it says to the rich, \"work, and do not stop to think of\r\nenjoying your wealth. You shall increase your income without increasing\r\nyour expenses; you shall enlarge your fortune, but it will be only to\r\nincrease the sources of labour for the poor, and to extend your power\r\nover the material world. Be simple and severe in your exterior, but at\r\nhome you may have the richest carpets, plate in abundance, the finest\r\nlinens of Ireland and Saxony; externally your house shall be on the\r\nsame model with all the others of the town; you shall have neither\r\nlivery nor equipage; you shall not patronise the theatre, which tends\r\nto relax morals; you shall avoid play; you shall sign the articles and\r\npledges of the Temperance Society; you shall not even indulge in good\r\ncheer; you shall set an example of constant attendance at church; you\r\nshall always show the most profound respect for morals and religion,\r\nfor the farmer and mechanic around you have their eyes fixed upon you;\r\nthey take you for their pattern, they still acknowledge you to be the\r\narbiter of manners and customs, although they have taken from you the\r\npolitical sceptre. If you give yourself up to pleasure, to parade, to\r\namusement, to dissipation and luxury, they also will give the reins to\r\ntheir gross appetites and their violent passions. Your country will be\r\nruined, and you will be ruined with it.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible to imagine various social systems differently organised\r\nbut equally favourable, theoretically, to the promotion of industry.\r\nWe may imagine a society organised for labour under the influence of\r\nthe principle of authority; that is, a society composed of a gradation\r\nof ranks; we may conceive another constituted under the auspices of\r\nthe principle of liberty or independence. To organise _a priori_, for\r\npurposes of industry, any given people, it is necessary, under penalty\r\nof engendering a Utopian scheme, to consult the circumstances of its\r\norigin and the condition of its territory, to know whence and how\r\nit has come, and whither it is going. With the people of the United\r\nStates, a scion of the English stock, and thoroughly imbued with\r\nProtestantism, the principle of independence, of individualism, of\r\ncompetition, in fine, could not but be successful. The iron hearts of\r\nthe Puritans, the _Ultras_ of Protestantism, could not fail to find\r\nthis principle congenial to them. It is owing to this course that the\r\nsons of New England, which was peopled by the _Pilgrims_, have played\r\nthe chief part in the occupation of the great valley of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation of the West[CN] has sprung from the secret and\r\nsilent co-operation of two or three hundred thousand young farmers,\r\nwho started, each on his own account, from New England, often alone,\r\nsometimes with a small company of friends. This system would not have\r\nsucceeded with Frenchmen. The Yankee alone in the woods, with no\r\ncompanion but his wife, is all-sufficient for himself. The Frenchman is\r\neminently social; he could not bear the solitude in which the Yankee\r\nwould feel at his ease. The latter, although solitary, becomes excited\r\nby his own plans and eager to accomplish them. The Frenchman cannot\r\nbecome interested in any industrial enterprise except in connection\r\nwith others, whose concurrence with him is evident and palpable, or\r\nrather he rarely becomes interested in any material task, for he\r\nreserves his affections and sympathies for living objects. It is quite\r\nimpossible for him to fall in love with a _clearing_, to feel the same\r\ntransports at the success of a manufacture as for the safety of a\r\nfriend or the happiness of a mistress; but he is capable of applying\r\nhimself to the task with ardour, if his characteristic passions, his\r\nthirst for glory and his spirit of emulation, are brought into play\r\nby contact with human beings. If it were proposed, then, to settle\r\ncolonies with Frenchmen, it would be necessary to put little reliance\r\non individual efforts. In all things, as well as in a line of battle,\r\na Frenchman must feel his neighbour's elbow. Americans might be thrown\r\nseparately upon a new land, they would form little centres round which\r\nconstantly expanding circles of population and cultivation would grow\r\nup. But if the new settlers were Frenchmen, it would be necessary to\r\ncarry with them a society ready constituted, social bonds already\r\nbinding them in, or at least a regular social framework, and bolts to\r\nwhich the social bonds are to be attached; that is, they must have, at\r\nstarting, the great circle with its centre strongly marked.\r\n\r\nCanada is almost the only colony that has been founded exclusively by\r\nFrenchmen,[CO] and a complete social organisation was carried thither.\r\nThe country once explored, the royal fleet landed the _seigneurs_, who\r\nhad received fiefs from royal grants, and who were followed by vassals\r\ntransplanted from Normandy and Brittany, among whom the lands were\r\ndistributed. At the same time an endowed regular and secular clergy,\r\nwith ample domains and the right of collecting the tithe, was brought\r\nto the St. Lawrence. Next came traders and companies, to whom was given\r\nthe monopoly of the fur-trade and the commerce of the colony. In a\r\nword the three orders, the clergy, nobility, and third estate, were\r\nimported ready made from Old France into New. The only thing which the\r\ncolonists left behind them, was the poverty of the greatest number.\r\nThe system was a good one for that period; the principle of order and\r\nof ranks, which prevailed under the only form then practicable, was\r\nin keeping with the character of the people. The proof of this is to\r\nbe found in the fact, that Canada has flourished under this system in\r\nwhich the English conquerors have made no changes, and the population\r\nhas increased in the bosom of general ease. I have seen nothing which\r\nmore completely realised the _aurea mediocritas_, than the pretty\r\nvillages on the banks of the St. Lawrence. They do not exhibit the\r\nambitious prosperity of those of the United States; they are much more\r\nmodest than those of the republic; but if there is less show, there is\r\nalso more content and happiness. Canada reminded me of Switzerland; it\r\nis the same aspect of calm contentment and quiet happiness. It would\r\nbe a subject of admiration were it not by the side of the American\r\ncolossus; its rapid growth would attract attention, were it not for\r\nthe miraculous expansion of the United States. Neither would it be\r\nright to assert that the progress of Canada has been in spite of the\r\ncolonial system; the dispute about the _because_ and the _although_ is\r\neasily settled in this case. All that was burdensome about the original\r\nsystem remains untouched, and there is no complaint against it. The\r\nseignorial dues, the tithe, the seignorial mill, and the _four banal_,\r\nstill exist in full vigour; and do not appear in the interminable list\r\nof ninety-three grievances, lately drawn up by the Canadians.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[CM] In the hotels and on board the steamboats, the door of the\r\neating-room is beset by a crowd on the approach of a meal-time. As\r\nsoon as the bell sounds, there is a general rush into the room, and\r\nin less than ten minutes every place is occupied. In a quarter of an\r\nhour, out of 300 persons, 200 have left the table, and in ten minutes\r\nmore not an individual is to be seen. On my passage from Baltimore to\r\nNorfolk, in the winter of 1834, I found that, notwithstanding the cold,\r\nthree fourths of the passengers had risen at 4 o'clock, and at six,\r\nbeing almost the only person left abed, and feeling sure that we must\r\nbe near our port, I got up, and went upon deck; but it was not until\r\neight o'clock, that we came in sight of Norfolk. On mentioning the fact\r\nafterward to an American, a man of sense, who was on board at the same\r\ntime, and who, wiser than I, had lain abed till after sunrise; \"Ah,\r\nsir,\" said he, \"if you knew my countrymen better, you wouldn't be at\r\nall surprised at their getting up at four o'clock, with the intention\r\nof arriving at nine. An American is always on the lookout lest any of\r\nhis neighbours should get the start of him. If one hundred Americans\r\nwere going to be shot, they would contend for the priority, so strong\r\nis their habit of competition.\"\r\n\r\n[CN] I allude particularly to the Northwest, or that portion of the\r\nWest in which slavery does not exist.\r\n\r\n[CO] In Louisiana, St. Domingo, and the other islands, the mass of the\r\npopulation consisted of blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SUNBURY, (PENNSYLVANIA,) JULY 31, 1835.\r\n\r\nIn a society devoted to production and traffic, money must be regarded\r\nwith other eyes, than among a people of military spirit, or nourished\r\nin classical studies and scientific speculations. Among the latter,\r\nit must be looked upon, theoretically at least, as vile metal. With\r\nthem honour and glory are more powerful and more common motives of\r\naction than interest; they are the coin with which many persons are\r\ncontent, the only coin which many persons are ambitious to acquire.\r\nIn an industrious society, on the other hand, money, the fruit and\r\nobject of labour, is not to be despised; a man's wealth is the measure\r\nof his capacity and of his consideration among his fellow-citizens.\r\nWhatever may be the cause, the fact is certain, that money is not\r\nthe same thing here that it is with us; that it weighs here where\r\nwith us it has no weight; that it appears openly here, where with us\r\nit would hide itself. When I was in England, I was surprised at the\r\nnumber of notices in the docks, threatening, for instance, a fine\r\nfor certain offences, with a promise of half to the informer. If a\r\nprefect of the police should offer such a premium to informers among\r\nus, our blood would boil with indignation. In this country the same\r\npractice prevails, and seems to be still more frequent. When a crime\r\nis committed, the authorities offer a reward of 100 or 200 dollars to\r\nwhoever will make known or deliver up the criminal. In Philadelphia, I\r\nsaw the governor of the State and the mayor of the city endeavouring to\r\noutbid each other in promises; a murder had been committed during one\r\nof the preliminary elections, and those officers, who were of different\r\nparties, endeavoured to prove by the greatness of their offers, that\r\nthe opposite party was guilty of the act. In some cases of incendiarism\r\nor poisoning, a reward of 1000 dollars has been offered. It should be\r\nobserved, however, that in England, out of London, and in this country,\r\nthere is no organised police like ours, and it, therefore, becomes\r\nnecessary that the citizens themselves should act as a police.\r\n\r\nThe maxim here is that everything is to be paid for. Museums and\r\ninstitutions for higher instruction to which admission is gratuitous,\r\nare here unknown. Nor are those unpaid offices, which take a citizen\r\nfrom his business, and would make it impossible for him to provide for\r\nthe support of his family, if he discharged them faithfully, known\r\nhere. The municipal offices in the country have no pay attached to\r\nthem, because they take up little time and require little attention,\r\nand because a man in the country has more leisure than the busy\r\ninhabitant of the city. But in the cities all officers are paid, as\r\nsoon as their functions come to occupy much of their time. The custom\r\nof paying by the day, which prevails in England, is very general here.\r\nMembers of Congress are paid at the rate of eight dollars a day, and\r\nif a legislative committee prolongs its sessions beyond those of the\r\nlegislative body, the pay is continued on the same footing. All the\r\nState legislatures are paid by the day. Canal commissioners, who are\r\ngenerally men of some distinction, that is, rich men, are generally\r\npaid in the same way, an account being kept of the number of days they\r\nare employed in the public service; for them the pay amounts merely\r\nto the payment of their expenses. Those, however, who are permanently\r\noccupied, receive an annual salary. In some offices, the incumbents\r\nare paid by fees for each affair in which they become engaged; this\r\nis generally the case with the States' Attorneys and the Justices of\r\nPeace, and with the Aldermen in some of the cities. The public officers\r\nwho are regularly employed, such as the Governors of the States, and\r\nthe Mayors of the principal cities have a fixed annual salary. It is a\r\nsettled principle here that all work should stand on the same footing\r\nwith industrial labour, and be paid in the same manner. Intellectual\r\nmerchandise and material merchandise, capital and talent, dollars\r\nand science, are here placed on the same level; this practice puts\r\nevery one at his ease, and facilitates, abridges, and simplifies all\r\noperations. No one feels the least embarrassment in asking for a\r\nservice, which he knows will be paid for. Everything is settled plainly\r\nand easily, because in an industrious and prosperous society every one\r\nhas the power to be liberal.\r\n\r\nMoney is also made an instrument of punishment, as well as of reward.\r\nIt is well known that, in England, a conviction for adultery enriches\r\nthe wronged husband at the expense of the guilty paramour, and the same\r\npractice would prevail here, if the crime were not extremely rare.\r\nThe American law is very sparing of bodily punishments for simple\r\nmisdemeanours, but it makes very free use of fines. On most bridges,\r\nthere are notices forbidding the passing with horses at any other pace\r\nthan a walk, under penalty of a fine of 2, 3, or 5 dollars. When a man\r\nis suspected or even accused of a crime, such as forgery, arson, or\r\nmurder, it is not his person, but his purse that is secured; that is,\r\ninstead of being arrested, he is obliged to give bail in a sum which\r\nis left to the discretion of the Judicial authority. Last year, while\r\na convention for revising the constitution of Tennessee was in session\r\nin Nashville, one of the members, a militia general, of whom there are\r\nthousands in the country, a man of large property, and therefore very\r\nrespectable, got into a quarrel with an editor of a newspaper, and\r\nuttered violent threats against him. Some days afterward, in company\r\nwith another violent fellow, he actually discharged a pistol at his\r\nadversary in the bar-room of a hotel, and wounded him dangerously. The\r\naffair was brought before the proper authorities, and the assassin was\r\nadmitted to bail, being thus left at full liberty on depositing some\r\nthousand dollars, continuing to sit in the Convention and to assist\r\nin the formation of the new constitution of the State.[CP] So much\r\ntenderness towards an assassin, and similar proceedings which I have\r\nwitnessed relative to incendiaries and persons guilty of forgery,\r\nrecall to mind those times of barbarism, in which criminals were\r\nredeemed at a price. It will be readily imagined, after what has been\r\nsaid, that imprisonment for debt is very abhorrent from American ideas;\r\nin fact, a general clamour has been raised against it; most of the\r\nStates have already abolished it, and others will not long delay to\r\nfollow the example.\r\n\r\nMoney, is therefore, the sanction of the laws and of the most simple\r\npolice regulations. If a magistrate has good reason for believing that\r\nan individual has intentions to break the peace, instead of taking him\r\ninto custody as a measure of prevention, he requires him to give bail\r\nfor his good behaviour. It is by money-penalties, also, that chartered\r\ncompanies are obliged to conform to the provisions of their charters.\r\nIt is by fines, that even the magistrates are punished for neglect of\r\nduty. To remedy the inconveniences arising from the minute subdivision\r\nand dispersion of administrative authority in the New England States,\r\nresort is also had to money. In that part of the Union, the repair of\r\nroads is left to the care of the towns, and it is plain that the travel\r\nthrough a whole State might be seriously incommoded by the neglect\r\nof one town. It is, therefore, provided by law, that every town shall\r\nbe responsible for any accidents to travellers within its limits,\r\nwhich may be owing to the bad state of the roads; it is not uncommon\r\nto read accounts in the newspapers of a town being condemned to pay\r\na traveller, who has been overturned on its roads or bridges, 500 or\r\n1000 dollars damages. The city of Lowell was very lately condemned to\r\npay 6,000 dollars to two travellers, who had broken their legs by such\r\nan accident. The judge charged that the plaintiffs should not only be\r\nreimbursed for the expenses of the cure, but also for the estimated\r\nprobable earnings of their industry during their confinement.\r\n\r\nAmongst us, it is not money, but honour, that occupies the most\r\nconspicuous place, and if it be admitted that the sentiment of honour\r\nlies at the foundation of monarchies, and if every thing turn upon\r\nthis one principle, this is very well. The principle of honour is\r\nquite as good in every view, whether logically, morally or practically\r\nconsidered, as the principle of money. It is, indeed, more congenial to\r\nthe generosity of the French character; but then it is necessary that\r\nthe honour should be something real, that the consideration it gives,\r\nshould be incontestable; it is necessary that the authority which\r\nis the source of honour, should be itself respected. If the supreme\r\nauthority is insulted and despised, public functions become not a\r\nsource of consideration, but of contempt. If jealousy and suspicion of\r\npower are admitted and consecrated by the modern spirit of legislation\r\nand administration, is it not true that your pretended recompense of\r\npublic service by the consideration and dignity they confer, is a\r\nmockery, and that your whole system is founded upon a contradiction? If\r\nroyalty still sat all-powerful on the magnificent throne of Versailles,\r\namidst its guards glittering with steel and gold, surrounded by the\r\nmost brilliant court of which history preserves the record, and by\r\nthe fascinations with which the homage of the arts invested it; or if\r\nthe prince were a saviour of his country, raised on the buckler by his\r\nvictories, and dating his decrees from the palace of vassal kings,\r\nor from the Schoenbrunn of the conquered Kaisers; if he crowned and\r\nuncrowned kings, as our ministers now make and unmake sub-prefects; if\r\nat a breath of his mouth, victorious veterans calmly met death; if the\r\nworld did him homage; if he were the anointed of the Lord, the choice\r\nand idol of the people; if you had yet the monarchy of Louis XIV.,\r\nor of Napoleon, you would be welcome to speak of consideration and\r\nhonour! It was then distinction enough to be noticed by a royal look.\r\nThe favour of the sovereign then secured the confidence, or at least\r\nthe outward homage of the people. The point of precedence was worthy\r\nof being a subject of envy in the days of the splendour of Versailles,\r\nor when one might lose oneself in the crowd of kings in the Tuileries.\r\nBut what does it signify now-a-days, when royalty has lost its poetical\r\nattributes, when public ceremonies are abolished, when there is no\r\nlonger a court or court-dress? Titles have been profaned and degraded\r\nby the ignorance and stupidity of those who ought to have supported\r\ntheir dignity, or sullied by the jealousy of the commons. As for your\r\nribands you have been obliged to scatter them under the hoofs of\r\nhorses. The system of honour is, therefore, gone by; to restore it, a\r\nrevolution would be necessary; not a revolution like that of July, but\r\na revolution like that which was going on during the three centuries\r\nbetween Luther and Mirabeau, and which, ripe at last, has been shaking\r\nboth worlds during the last fifty years; a revolution in the name of\r\nauthority, like that which our fathers accomplished in the name of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nAmong the sayings attributed to M. de Talleyrand, the following is\r\noften quoted; \"I don't know an American that hasn't sold his horse\r\nor dog.\" It is certain that the Americans are an exaggeration of the\r\nEnglish, whom Napoleon used to call a nation of shop-keepers. The\r\nAmerican is always bargaining; he always has one bargain afoot, another\r\njust finished, and several more in meditation. All that he has, all\r\nthat he sees, is merchandise in his eyes. The poetical associations\r\nwhich invest particular spots or objects with a character of sanctity,\r\nhave no place in his mind. The spire of his village church is no more\r\nthan any other spire to him, and the finest in his view, is the newest,\r\nthe most freshly painted. To him a cataract is a motive power for his\r\nmachinery, _a mill privilege_; an old building is a quarry of bricks\r\nand stones, which he works without the least remorse. The Yankee will\r\nsell his father's house, like old clothes or rags. In his character of\r\npioneer, it is his destiny to attach himself to nothing, to no place,\r\nedifice, object, or person, except his wife, to whom he is indissolubly\r\nbound night and day, from the moment of marriage till death parts them.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom, then, of all that an American does, is money; beneath\r\nevery word, money. But it would be a mistake to suppose that he is\r\nnot capable of making pecuniary sacrifices; he is in the habit of\r\nsubscribing to all useful objects, and he does so without reluctance or\r\nregret, oftener than we are accustomed to do, and more liberally also;\r\nbut his munificence and his donations are systematic and calculated. It\r\nis neither enthusiasm nor passion that unties his purse strings, but\r\nmotives of policy or considerations of propriety, views of utility and\r\nregard for the public good, in which he feels his own private interests\r\nto be involved. The American, therefore, admits some exceptions to\r\nhis general commercial rule of conduct. He gives money, he attends\r\ncommittee-meetings, he draws up in haste a report or an opinion; he\r\neven goes in person, at high speed, to Washington, in order to present\r\na set of resolutions to the President, or he hastens to a neighbouring\r\ncity to attend a public dinner, and returns in equal haste; but he\r\nrequires in this case that the exception to the general rule should be\r\nsharply defined and the cause strongly marked, that the public interest\r\nshould be at stake. And he particularly insists that the sacrifice\r\nshould be of money only, once for all, and that his time should be\r\nrespected. To everything of a private nature, to everything that takes\r\nup his time and demands his attention, he applies the mercantile\r\nprinciple, nothing for nothing. He pays the services of others with\r\ndollars, and he expects others to do the same by him, because he looks\r\nupon compliments as too hollow and light to be put in the scale against\r\nlabour, and because distinctions, such for instance as precedence, are\r\nunknown and incomprehensible to him. With him it is an indisputable\r\nmaxim, that the labourer is worthy of his hire. The ideas of service\r\nand salary are so inseparably connected in his mind, that in American\r\nalmanacs it is common to see the rate of pay annexed to the lists of\r\npublic officers. He is of opinion that nobody can live on a dry crust\r\nand glory; he thinks of the welfare of his wife and children, of a\r\nprovision for his old age, and if he were told that there is a country\r\nin which these considerations are disregarded, for the purpose of\r\nobliging a neighbour or paying a courtesy to a magistrate, such a thing\r\nwould appear absurd to him.\r\n\r\nHigh pay is not, however, consonant with the spirit of democracy,\r\nbecause it is incapable of discerning its propriety. The mechanic who\r\nmakes 500 dollars a year, thinks himself generous towards a public\r\nofficer to whom he gives 1,500 or 2,000; just as our citizens of the\r\nmiddling class in Paris, who have an income of 10,000 francs, cannot\r\nsee why a public functionary should not be content with 12,000. The\r\nAmericans thought that among them, as elsewhere, there would be\r\ntwo kinds of coin, money and public consideration, and they were\r\npersuaded, on the authority of Franklin, that it would be easy to\r\nfind able public officers, whose salary should chiefly consist in the\r\nhonour of public station. But they were mistaken; for office is here\r\nno title to respect, but quite the contrary; and as public services\r\nare neither paid by dollars nor consideration, only a Hobson's choice\r\nis left to the people. With the exception of a very small number of\r\nplaces, which the delights of power still cause to be sought after,\r\nnotwithstanding the cost of the pleasure of commanding and having\r\ndependents or subordinates, office is generally sought for only by\r\nthe floating part of the population, which has been unsuccessful in\r\nbusiness, and tried one occupation after another in vain. It is not\r\neven, strictly speaking, a profession, but rather the temporary resort\r\nof persons who have no settled pursuit, who, as soon as they find a\r\nmore eligible employment in industry or speculation, take leave of the\r\nState. The West Point Academy sends out about forty lieutenants for\r\nthe army annually; about one third of these resign their commissions\r\nbefore two or three years of service, because the pay of the officers,\r\nalthough much higher than with us, is very inconsiderable compared with\r\nthe profits of a merchant or the salary of an engineer.\r\n\r\nThe duties of a public officer are generally less difficult in the\r\nUnited States than in France. Among us every question that arises,\r\nembraces a great complication of interests, and requires more\r\nknowledge. The powers and duties of the government in France are much\r\nmore extensive and more various, and more care is exacted of persons\r\nin the public employ among us, than in this country. Yet the average\r\nof salaries here is much greater than with us. When the Congress and\r\nthe States shall stand in need of able men for functionaries, they will\r\ndo as the American merchants do to their clerks, they will pay them.\r\nCongress, having lately become sensible of the importance of securing\r\nthe services of good naval officers, has just raised the pay of that\r\ncorps.[CQ] It may even be said that the number of office-holders who\r\nare treated with illiberality, is very small.[CR] Out of 158 persons\r\nemployed in the service of the Treasury department at Washington, there\r\nare only 5 who receive less than 1,000 dollars, and there are only two\r\nwho receive more than 2,000; this is the application of the principle\r\nof equality to pay. As the price of common objects of consumption, that\r\nis, bread, meat, coffee, tea, sugar, and fuel, is generally lower in\r\nthe United States than in France, and especially in Paris, a salary\r\nof 1,500 or 2,000 dollars is sufficient in most cases to support a\r\nfamily in comfort and abundance. An officer of the government, who\r\nreceives from 400 to 600 dollars in Paris, lives only by practising the\r\nstrictest economy if he is a bachelor, and suffers great privations\r\nif he is a married man. At Washington he would receive from 1,000 to\r\n1,200 dollars, and would live in abundance and comfort, if not in\r\nstyle and luxury. Nor would he here, as with us, be condemned to the\r\npunishment of Tantalus, for the pomp and splendour of the privileged\r\nclasses in the European capitals is unknown in the United States. In\r\nParis, the _employé_ is bespattered with mud by the equipage of a man\r\nwho spends his 20,000 dollars a year; in the streets of Philadelphia,\r\nhe would elbow a rich capitalist who kept no coach because he would not\r\nknow what to do with it, and who, with a revenue of 30,000 or 60,000\r\ndollars, cannot spend more than 8,000 or 10,000 at the most. The ratio\r\nof conditions, which in Paris is as one to forty, is here not more than\r\none to eight.\r\n\r\nHere the condition of the richest merchant, and that of a mechanic and\r\na farmer, are not essentially different; the difference is merely in\r\ndegree and not in kind. All have similar houses, built on a similar\r\nplan; only that one has a front five or six feet wider, and is one\r\nor two stories higher than another; the distribution of apartments,\r\nand the furniture are similar. All have carpets from the cellar to\r\nthe garret, all sleep in large high-post bedsteads very much like\r\neach other, projecting out into a chamber without closets, alcoves,\r\nor double door, and with bare walls; only the carpets of the one are\r\ncoarse, and those of the other are fine, the bedstead of the rich is\r\nof mahogany, and that of the mechanic of cherry or walnut. In general\r\nthe table is served much alike; there is the same number of meals,\r\nand there is nearly the same number of dishes. This is so much the\r\ncase, that, if my French palate had to decide between the dinner of a\r\ngreat city hotel (excepting those of Boston, New York, Philadelphia,\r\nand Baltimore), and that of a country inn, at which I should sit by\r\nthe side of the blacksmith of the place, with sooty visage and with\r\nsleeves rolled up, I think that I should really pronounce in favour of\r\nthe latter. This is especially the case in the North, and particularly\r\nin New England, the land of the Yankees. In the South, the condition\r\nof the planter on his estate gains all that is taken from the mass\r\nof the population, or the slaves. And even at the North, of late\r\nyears, commerce, which has collected men into large cities, has also\r\naccumulated capital in single hands, and created great fortunes. The\r\ninequality of condition is, therefore, beginning to manifest itself;\r\nthe style of the new houses in Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, with\r\ntheir first story of white marble, is a blow at equality. The same\r\ninnovation is creeping in in New York; the anti-democratical tendency\r\nof commerce is revealing itself.[CS]\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that among a people so deeply absorbed in material\r\npursuits, misers would abound; but it is not so. There is never any\r\nniggardliness in a Southerner; it is sometimes found in the Yankee,\r\nbut nowhere do you see specimens of that sordid avarice, of which\r\nexamples are so common among us. The American has too high a notion\r\nof the dignity of human nature, to be willing to deprive himself and\r\nhis children of those comforts which soften the asperities of life;\r\nhe respects his own person too much not to surround it with a certain\r\ndegree of decency. Harpagon is never to be met with in the United\r\nStates, and yet Harpagon is not by a great deal the most wretchedly\r\ndegraded miser, that European society exhibits. The American is\r\ndevoured with a passion for money, not because he finds a pleasure in\r\nhoarding it up, but because wealth is power, because it is the lever by\r\nwhich he governs nature. I ought also to do the Americans justice on\r\nanother point. I have said that with them every thing was an affair of\r\nmoney, and yet there is one thing, which among us, a people of lively\r\naffections, prone to love, and generous by nature, takes the mercantile\r\ncharacter very decidedly, and which among them has nothing of this\r\ncharacter; I mean marriage. We buy woman with our fortune, or we sell\r\nourselves to her for her dower. The American chooses her, or rather\r\noffers himself to her, for her beauty, her intelligence, or her amiable\r\nqualities, and asks no other portion. Thus, whilst we make a traffic\r\nof what is most sacred, these shop-keepers exhibit a delicacy and\r\nloftiness of feeling, which would have done honor to the most perfect\r\nmodels of chivalry. It is to industry that they are indebted for this\r\nsuperiority. Our idle cits, not being able to increase their patrimony,\r\nare obliged in taking a wife to calculate her portion, in order to\r\ndecide if their joint income will be enough to support a family. The\r\nAmerican, having the taste and the habits of industry, is sure of being\r\nable to provide amply for his household, and is therefore, free from\r\nthe necessity of making this melancholy calculation. Is it possible to\r\ndoubt, that a race of men, which thus combines in a high degree the\r\nmost contradictory qualities, is reserved for lofty destinies?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[CP] This man was finally condemned in light damages, and this was\r\nhis only punishment.

The Americans of all parties conduct\r\nthemselves in their private affairs like men who are convinced that\r\nbusiness will experience no interruption from that quarter. A person\r\nwho landed at New York, Boston, or Philadelphia, on the day that news\r\nwas received of the effect produced in France by the President's\r\nmessage, and had since played Epimenides, would not now recognise\r\nthe United States; the most unlimited confidence has succeeded to\r\nthe general anxiety. Every body is speculating, and every thing has\r\nbecome an object of speculation. The most daring enterprises find\r\nencouragement; all projects find subscribers. From Maine to the Red\r\nRiver, the whole country has become an immense _rue Quincampoix_. Thus\r\nfar every one has made money, as is always the case when speculation is\r\nin the ascendant. And as soon-come soon goes, consumption is enormously\r\nincreased, and Lyons feels the effect. I said that every thing has\r\nbecome an object of speculation; I was mistaken. The American,\r\nessentially practical in his views, will never speculate in tulips,\r\neven at New York, although the inhabitants of that city have Dutch\r\nblood in their veins. The principal objects of speculation are those\r\nsubjects which chiefly occupy the calculating minds of the Americans,\r\nthat is to say, cotton, land, city and town lots, banks, railroads.\r\n\r\nThe amateurs in land at the north, dispute with each other the\r\nacquisition of the valuable timber-lands of that region; at the\r\nsouthern extremity, the Mississippi swamps, and the Alabama and the\r\nRed River cotton lands, are the subject of competition, and in the\r\nWest, the corn fields and pastures of Illinois and Michigan. The\r\nunparallelled growth of some new towns has turned the heads of the\r\nnation, and there is a general rush upon all points advantageously\r\nsituated; as if, before ten years, three or four Londons, as many\r\nParises, and a dozen Liverpools, were about to display their streets\r\nand edifices, their quays crowded with warehouses, and their harbours\r\nbristling with masts, in the American wilderness. In New York building\r\nlots[CT] have been sold sufficient for a population of two million\r\nsouls, and at New Orleans, for at least a million. Pestilential\r\nmarshes and naked precipices of rock have been bought and sold for\r\nthis purpose. In Louisiana, the quagmires, the bottomless haunts of\r\nalligators, the lakes and cypress-swamps, with ten feet of water or\r\nslime, and in the North, the bed of the Hudson with 20, 30, or 50 feet\r\nof water, have found numerous purchasers.\r\n\r\nTake the map of the United States; place yourself on the shore of Lake\r\nErie, which twenty years ago was a solitary wilderness; ascend it to\r\nits head; pass thence to Lake St. Clair, and from that lake push on\r\ntowards the north, across Lake Huron: go forward still, thread your\r\nway through Lake Michigan, and advance southwards till the water fails\r\nyou; here you will find a little town by the name of Chicago, one of\r\nthe outposts of our indefatigable countrymen when they had possession\r\nof America. Chicago seems destined, at some future period, to enjoy\r\nan extensive trade; it will occupy the head of a canal, which is to\r\nconnect the Mississippi with the lakes and the St. Lawrence; but at\r\npresent it hardly numbers two or three thousand inhabitants. Chicago\r\nhas in its rear a country of amazing fertility; but this country is yet\r\nan uncultivated wild. Nevertheless the land for ten leagues round has\r\nbeen sold, resold, and sold again in small sections, not, however, at\r\nChicago, but at New York, which, by the route actually travelled, is\r\n2,000 miles distant. There you may find plans of Chicago lots numerous\r\nenough for 300,000 inhabitants; this is more than any city of the New\r\nWorld at present contains. More than one buyer will, probably, esteem\r\nhimself fortunate, if, on examination, he shall find not more than six\r\nfeet of water on his purchase.\r\n\r\nSpeculations in railroads have hardly been less wild than those in\r\nland. The American has a perfect passion for railroads; he loves\r\nthem, to use Camille Desmoulins' expression in reference to Mirabeau,\r\nas a lover loves his mistress. It is not merely because his supreme\r\nhappiness consists in that speed which annihilates time and space;\r\nis also because he perceives, for the American always reasons, that\r\nthis mode of communication is admirably adapted to the vast extent of\r\nhis country, to its great maritime plain, and to the level surface\r\nof the Mississippi valley, and because he sees all around him in the\r\nnative forest, abundance of materials for executing these works at a\r\ncheap rate. This is the reason, why railroads are multiplied in such\r\nprofusion, competing not only with each other, but entering into a\r\nrivalry with the rivers and canals. If the works now in process of\r\nconstruction are completed (and I think that they will be,) there\r\nwill be, within two years, three distinct routes between Philadelphia\r\nand Baltimore, exclusive of the old post-route; namely, two lines\r\nconsisting wholly of railroads, and a third consisting in part of\r\nsteamboats, and in part of railroad. The line that has the advantage of\r\nhalf an hour over its rivals, will be sure to crush them.\r\n\r\nThe manner of establishing banks here is this; an act authorising\r\nthe opening of books in a public place, for subscription of stock,\r\nis obtained from the legislature, and all persons have the right\r\nto subscribe on payment of a certain sum, say five, ten, or twenty\r\nper cent. on the amount of stock taken by them respectively. The\r\naffair of opening the books becomes a matter of the greatest moment.\r\nIn France, we form lanes (_on fait queue_) round the doors of the\r\ntheatres; but in the United States, during the last year, the doors of\r\nthe sanctuaries in which the books for registering the subscriptions\r\nfor bank-stock have been deposited, have been thronged with the\r\nmost intense solicitude. In Baltimore, the books were opened for a\r\nnew bank, the Merchants' Bank, with a capital of two millions; the\r\namount subscribed was nearly fifty million. At Charleston, for a\r\nbank of the same capital, ninety millions were subscribed, and as\r\nthe act in this instance required the advance of 25 per cent., the\r\nsum actually paid in, in paper money to be sure, but yet in current\r\nbills at par, amounted to twentytwo and a half millions, or more\r\nthan eleven times the capital required. This rage for bank-stock is\r\neasily explained. Most of the banks here are, in fact, irresponsible\r\nestablishments, which have the privilege of coining money from paper.\r\nThe share-holders, by means of a series of ingenious contrivances,\r\nrealise 8, 9, 10, and 12 per cent. interest on capital, which they do\r\nnot actually hold; and this in a country where the five per cents. of\r\nPennsylvania and New York, and the six per cents. of Ohio are at 110 to\r\n115. The Ohio sixes! What would the heroes of Fort Duquesne think of\r\nthat, if they should come back?\r\n\r\nMost of these speculations are imprudent, many of them are foolish.\r\nThe high prices of to-day may and needs must be followed by a crisis\r\ntomorrow. Great fortunes, and many of them too, have sprung out of the\r\nearth since the spring; others will, perhaps, return to it before the\r\nfall of the leaf. The American concerns himself little about that;\r\nviolent sensations are necessary to stir his vigourous nerves. Public\r\nopinion and the pulpit forbid sensual graduations, wine, women, and the\r\ndisplay of a princely luxury; cards and dice are equally prohibited;\r\nthe American, therefore, has recourse to business for the strong\r\nemotions which he requires to make him feel life. He launches with\r\ndelight into the ever-moving sea of speculation. One day, the wave\r\nraises him to the clouds; he enjoys in haste the moment of triumph.\r\nThe next day he disappears between the crests of the billows; he is\r\nlittle troubled by the reverse, he bides his time coolly, and consoles\r\nhimself with the hope of better fortune. In the midst of all this\r\nspeculation, whilst some enrich and some ruin themselves, banks spring\r\nup and diffuse credit, railroads and canals extend themselves over\r\nthe country, steamboats are launched into the rivers, the lakes, and\r\nthe sea; the career of the speculators is ever enlarging, the field\r\nfor railroads, canals, steamers, and banks goes on expanding. Some\r\nindividuals lose, but the country is a gainer; the country is peopled,\r\ncleared, cultivated; its resources are unfolded, its wealth increased.\r\n_Go ahead!_\r\n\r\nIf movement and the quick succession of sensations and ideas constitute\r\nlife, here one lives a hundred fold more than elsewhere; all is\r\nhere circulation, motion, and boiling agitation. Experiment follows\r\nexperiment; enterprise succeeds to enterprise. Riches and poverty\r\nfollow on each other's traces, and each in turn occupies the place of\r\nthe other. Whilst the great men of one day dethrone those of the past,\r\nthey are already half overturned themselves by those of the morrow.\r\nFortunes last for a season; reputations, during the twinkling of an\r\neye. An irresistible current sweeps away everything, grinds everything\r\nto powder, and deposits it again under new forms. Men change their\r\nhouses, their climate, their trade, their condition, their party,\r\ntheir sect;[CU] the States change their laws, their officers, their\r\nconstitutions. The soil itself, or at least the houses, partake in\r\nthe universal instability.[CV] The existence of social order, in the\r\nbosom of this whirlpool seems a miracle, an inexplicable anomaly. One\r\nis tempted to think, that such a society, formed of heterogeneous\r\nelements, brought together by chance, and following each its own\r\norbit according to the impulse of its own caprice or interest,--one\r\nwould think, that after rising for one moment to the heavens, like a\r\nwater-spout, such a society would inevitably fall flat in ruins the\r\nnext; such is not, however, its destiny. In the midst of this general\r\nchange, there is one fixed point; it is the domestic fire-side, or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, the conjugal bed. An austere watchman, sometimes\r\nharsh even to fanaticism, wards off from this sacred spot everything\r\nthat can disturb its stability; that guardian is the religious\r\nsentiment. Whilst that fixed point shall continue invariable, whilst\r\nthat sentinel shall persist in his vigilant watch over it, the social\r\nsystem may make new somersets, and undergo new changes without serious\r\nrisk; it may be pelted by the storm, but while it is made fast to\r\nthat hold, it will neither split nor sink. It may even be divided into\r\nseparate and independent masses, but it will still grow in energy, in\r\nresources, in extent.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the democracy is so universal in this country, that\r\nit was quite natural for it to raise its head amidst the speculators.\r\nThere have, therefore, been strikes on the part of the workmen, who\r\nwish to have a share in the profits of speculation, and who have\r\ndemanded higher wages and less work. The former demand was just, for\r\nall provisions, all articles of consumption have risen in price. These\r\ncoalitions are by no means timid in this country; for the English\r\npractice of haranguing in public and getting up processions prevails\r\nhere, and the working class here feels its strength, is conscious of\r\nits power, and knows how to make use of it. The different traders\r\nhave held their meetings in Philadelphia, New York, and other places,\r\ndiscussed their affairs publicly, and set forth their demands.\r\nThe women have had their meeting as well as the men. That of the\r\nseamstresses of Philadelphia attracted notice; Matthew Carey, known\r\nas a political writer, presided, assisted by two clergymen. Among the\r\ndemands of the trades, that of the journeymen bakers, who, by virtue\r\nof the rights of man and the sanctity of the seventh day, would not\r\nmake bread Sundays, is worthy of attention. The principal trades have\r\ndecided that all work shall be suspended until the masters,[CW] if this\r\nname can be applied here except in derision, have acceded to their\r\n_ultimatum_. That every one may know this, they have caused their\r\nresolutions to be published in the newspapers, signed by the president\r\nand secretaries of the meeting. These resolutions declare that those\r\nworkmen, who shall refuse to conform to their provisions, will have\r\nto abide the _consequences_ of their refusal. The _consequences_ have\r\nbeen, that those refractory workmen, who persisted in their labours,\r\nhave been driven, with stones and clubs, from their workshops, without\r\nany interference on the part of the magistrates. The _consequence_ is,\r\nthat at this very moment, a handful of boatmen on the Schuylkill canal,\r\nprevent the coal boats from descending to the sea, lay an embargo upon\r\nthem, and thus interrupt one of the most lucrative branches of the\r\nPennsylvania trade, deprive the mariners and ship-owners, who transport\r\nthe coal to all parts of the coast, of wages and freights, and expose\r\nthe miners to the danger of being dismissed from the mines. Meanwhile\r\nthe militia looks on; the sheriff stands with folded arms. If this\r\nminority of the boatmen, for these acts of disorder are the work of a\r\nsmall minority, persists in their plans, a fight between them and the\r\nminers is to be apprehended.[CX] In Philadelphia, the _consequence_\r\nhas been, that the carpenters, in order to reduce some contractors\r\nto terms, have set fire to several houses, which these latter were\r\nbuilding. In this case, the authorities at length interfered, the\r\nmayor issued a proclamation, reciting that, whereas there is reason\r\nto believe these fires to be the work of some evil-minded persons, he\r\noffers 1000 dollars reward to whoever shall disclose the authors of the\r\nsame. But it is too late. The municipal authorities, for the purpose,\r\nit is said of gaining a few votes on the side of the Opposition,\r\ninstead of interposing their power between the workmen and the masters,\r\nhastened, from the first, to comply with all the demands of the former\r\nwho were employed on the municipal works.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher, in whose eyes the present is but a point, may find\r\nreason to rejoice in considering these facts. Workmen and domestics\r\nin Europe live in a state of absolute dependence, which is favourable\r\nonly to him who commands. Legitimists, republicans, the _juste-milieu_,\r\nall comport themselves toward the operative whom they employ, or the\r\ndomestic who is in their service, as if he were a being of an inferior\r\nnature, who owes his master all his zeal and all his efforts, but who\r\nhas no claim for any return beyond a miserable pittance of wages.\r\nOne may be permitted to wish for the establishment of a juster scale\r\nof rights and duties. In the United States, the absolute principle\r\nof the popular sovereignty having been applied to the relations of\r\nmaster and servant, of employer and operative, the manufacturer\r\nand the contractor, to whom the workmen give the law, endeavour to\r\ndispense with their aid as much as possible, by substituting more and\r\nmore machinery for human force; thus the most painful processes in\r\nthe arts become less burdensome to the human race. The master, whose\r\ndomestics obey him when they please, and who pays dear[CY] for being\r\nbadly and ungraciously served, favours, to the extent of his power, the\r\nintroduction of mechanical contrivances for simplifying work, in order\r\nto spare himself the inconveniences of such a dependence.\r\n\r\nIt would be worth while to study not only the great manufacturing\r\nmachinery, but the common hand tools and domestic utensils, in this\r\ncountry. These utensils, tools, and machines exert a powerful influence\r\nupon the practical liberty of the greatest number; it is by means of\r\nthem, that the most numerous class of society gradually frees itself\r\nfrom the yoke which tends to crush and abase it. In this point of view,\r\nthe present relations between the employer and the employed, between\r\nthe master and the servant, in this country, tend to hasten the coming\r\nof a future, which every friend of humanity must hail with joy. But\r\nif the philosophical satisfaction is ample, present, physical comfort\r\nis almost absolutely wanting. But whoever is neither operative nor\r\ndomestic, whoever, especially, has tasted and enjoyed the life of the\r\ncultivated classes in Europe, he will find the actual practical life in\r\nAmerica, the mere bone and muscle, as it were, of life, to consist of a\r\nseries of jars, disappointments, mortifications, I had almost said, of\r\nhumiliations. The independence of the operatives is sometimes the ruin\r\nof the masters; the independence of servants involves the dependence of\r\nthe women, condemns them to household labours little consonant with the\r\nfinished education which many of them have received, and nails them to\r\nthe kitchen and the nursery from the day of their marriage to the day\r\nof their death.\r\n\r\nWhen the innovating force, acting without check or balance, operates\r\nwith an excess of energy, all classes suffer equally from the\r\nderangement. Not only what in Europe are called the higher classes,\r\n(but which here must take another name,) are deprived of a thousand\r\nlittle enjoyments, which it is a matter of convention to despise in\r\nbooks and set speeches, although every one sets a high value on them in\r\npractice; but the whole social machine gets out of order, discomfort\r\nbecomes general, and the extravagant claims of the lower classes, to\r\nspeak as a European, recoil violently on themselves. At this very\r\nmoment, for example, the Sybarites of Philadelphia, whose hearts are\r\nset upon having fresh bread on Sunday, are not the only persons who\r\nsuffer or are threatened with suffering. If the exaggerated pretensions\r\nof the working classes are persisted in, they will lose their custom,\r\nthere will be no demand for labour. Speculations, if not made solid\r\nby labour, will burst like soap-bubbles, and if a reaction comes, the\r\noperative, who is little used to economise, will feel it more sensibly\r\nthan others.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[CT] A _lot_ is generally from 22 to 25 feet front, and from 80 to 100\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n[CU] The causes of religious changes are various. It is not rare\r\nto see Americans, on becoming rich, abandon their former sect for\r\nEpiscopalianism, for instance, which is the most fashionable. The\r\nchange, however, from one sect to another is less considerable than\r\nis supposed in Catholic countries; for the different Protestant sects\r\ndiffer less from each other, than a Jansenist from a Molinist, or\r\na Jesuit from a Gallican. But we must except from this remark the\r\nAnglican church, which has a peculiar character, discipline, and\r\nliturgy, and the two not very numerous sects of Unitarians, who deny\r\nthe divinity of Christ, and Universalists, who reject the doctrine of\r\nreprobation.\r\n\r\n[CV] The American houses are low and slight; the walls are generally\r\nonly a brick and a half, sometimes only one in thickness; when,\r\ntherefore, the course of the street is changed, as is often the case in\r\nNew York, they are set forward or back with little difficulty, and they\r\nare often even raised bodily. In the country, the houses are mostly\r\nof wood, and are often transported a considerable distance on wheels.\r\nBetween Albany and Troy, I was stopped on the road by a house of more\r\nthan forty feet front, which was travelling in this manner.\r\n\r\n[CW] This word is not used here; that of employers is substituted for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[CX] The citizens of Pottsville have put an end to these outrages, by\r\nrepairing with a sheriff's mandate to the spot where the boatmen were\r\nassembled, and seizing the ringleaders, whom they conducted to prison.\r\nThis courage of simple citizens, who in time of need convert themselves\r\ninto an armed force, is one of the surest guarantees of American\r\nliberty; but it is relaxing in the cities.\r\n\r\n[CY] In most of the provinces in France servants' wages are from 12 to\r\n15 dollars a year; here they are from 10 to 12 dollars a month, and one\r\nservant in France does the work of two in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.\r\n\r\nBEDFORD SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BEDFORD SPRINGS, (PA.) AUG. 7, 1835.\r\n\r\nHere I am at Bedford, one of the American watering-places; it is\r\nhardly three days since I arrived, and I am already in haste to quit\r\nit. The Americans, and, still more especially, the American women,\r\nmust be desperately listless at home, to be willing to exchange its\r\nquiet comfort for the stupid bustle, and dull wretchedness of such a\r\nresidence. It would seem that in a country truly democratic, as is the\r\ncase here in the Northern States, nothing like our watering-places can\r\nexist; and you will see that in proportion as Europe grows democratic,\r\nif such is its destiny, your delightful summer resorts will lose their\r\ncharm. Man is naturally exclusive; there are few pleasures, which do\r\nnot cease to be such, the moment they become accessible to all, and for\r\nthat reason only. At Saratoga or at Bedford, the American soon grows\r\nweary, because he sees that there are twenty thousand heads of families\r\nin Philadelphia and New York, who can, as well as he, if the notion\r\nseizes them, and it actually does seize them, have the satisfaction\r\nof bringing their wives and daughters to the same place, and, once\r\nthere, of gaping on a chair in the piazza the whole day; of going,\r\narms in hand (I mean the knife and fork,) to secure their share of a\r\nwretched dinner; of being stifled in the crowd of the ball-room during\r\nthe evening, and of sleeping, if it is possible, in the midst of such\r\na hubbub, upon a miserable pallet in a cell echoing one's tread from\r\nits floor of pine boards. The American passes through the magnificent\r\nlandscapes on the Hudson without noticing them, because he is one of\r\nsix hundred or a thousand on board the steamer. And to confess the\r\ntruth, I have become an American myself in this respect, and I admired\r\nthe panorama of West Point and the Highlands, only when I found myself\r\nalone in my boat on the river.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is too new a comer upon the earth, to have been able as yet\r\nto organise its pleasures and its amusements. In Europe, our pleasures\r\nare essentially exclusive, they are aristocratic like Europe itself,\r\nand cannot, therefore, be at the command and for the use of the\r\nmultitude. In this matter, then, as in politics, the American democracy\r\nhas yet to create every thing afresh. The problem is difficult, but\r\nit is not insoluble, for it was once resolved among us. The religious\r\nfestivals of the Catholic church were eminently democratic; all were\r\ncalled to them, all took part in them. To what transports of joy did\r\nnot all Europe, great and small, nobles, burgesses, and serfs, give\r\nitself up in the time of the crusades, when the victory of Antioch\r\nor the capture of Jerusalem was celebrated by processions and _Te\r\nDeums_? Even to this day, in our southern provinces, where faith is\r\nnot yet extinct, there are ceremonies truly popular; such are the\r\nfestival of Easter with the representations of the Passion exhibited\r\nin the churches, and the processions with banners and crosses, the\r\nbrotherhoods of penitents with their quaint frocks and flowing robes,\r\nand their long files of women and children; with the effigies of the\r\nsaints in full dress, and their relics piously carried about; and,\r\nfinally, with the military and civil pomp, which, notwithstanding the\r\natheism of the law, is mingled with the show. This is the poor man's\r\nspectacle, and one which leaves on his mind better and more vivid\r\nrecollections, than the atrocious dramas of the _boulevard_ and the\r\nfire-works of the Barrier of the Throne, leave to the suburban of Paris.\r\n\r\nAlready democracy, especially in the Western States, is beginning\r\nto have its festivals, which thrill its fibres, and stir it with\r\nagreeable emotions. There are religious festivals, the Methodist\r\ncamp-meetings, to which the people press with eager delight, in spite\r\nof the philosophical remonstrances of the more refined sects, who\r\nfind fault with their heated zeal and noisy ranting, and in spite,\r\nor rather in consequence, of the convulsionary and hysterical scenes\r\nof the _anxious bench_. In the older States of the North, there are\r\npolitical processions, for the most part mere party exhibitions, but\r\nwhich are interesting in this respect, that the democracy has a share\r\nin them; for it is the democratic party that gets up the most brilliant\r\nand animated. Beside the camp-meetings, the political processions\r\nare the only things in this country, which bear any resemblance to\r\nfestivals. The party dinners, with their speeches and deluge of toasts,\r\nare frigid, if not repulsive; and I have never seen a more miserable\r\naffair, than the dinner given by the Opposition, that is to say, by\r\nthe middle class, at Powelton, in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia.\r\nBut I stopped involuntarily at the sight of the gigantic hickory-poles\r\nwhich made their solemn entry on eight wheels, for the purpose of being\r\nplanted by the democracy on the eve of the election. I remember one\r\nof these poles, with its top still crowned with green foliage, which\r\ncame on to the sound of fifes and drums, and was preceded by ranks\r\nof democrats, bearing no other badge than a twig of the sacred tree\r\nin their hats. It was drawn by eight horses, decorated with ribands\r\nand mottoes; Astride on the tree itself, were a dozen Jackson men of\r\nthe first water, waving flags with an air of anticipated triumph, and\r\nshouting, _Hurrah for Jackson!_\r\n\r\nBut this entry of the hickory was but a by-matter compared with the\r\nprocession I witnessed in New York. It was in the night after the\r\nclosing of the polls, when victory had pronounced in favour of the\r\ndemocratic party. (See _Letter XV._) The procession was nearly a mile\r\nlong; the democrats marched in good order to the glare of torches; the\r\nbanners were more numerous than I had ever seen them in any religious\r\nfestival; all were in transparency, on account of the darkness. On\r\nsome were inscribed the names of the democratic societies or sections;\r\n_Democratic young men of the ninth or eleventh ward_; others bore\r\nimprecations against the Bank of the United States; _Nick Biddle_\r\nand _Old Nick_ here figured largely, and formed the pendant of our\r\n_libera nos a malo_. Then came portraits of General Jackson afoot and\r\non horseback; there was one in the uniform of a general, and another\r\nin the person of the Tennessee farmer, with the famous hickory cane in\r\nhis hand. Those of Washington and Jefferson, surrounded with democratic\r\nmottoes, were mingled with emblems in all tastes and of all colours.\r\nAmong these figured an eagle, not a painting, but a real live eagle,\r\ntied by the legs, surrounded by a wreath of leaves, and hoisted upon\r\na pole, after the manner of the Roman standards. The imperial bird\r\nwas carried by a stout sailor, more pleased than ever was a sergeant\r\npermitted to hold one of the strings of the canopy, in a catholic\r\nceremony. From further than the eye could reach, came marching on\r\nthe democrats. I was struck with the resemblance of their air to the\r\ntrain that escorts the _viaticum_ in Mexico or Puebla. The American\r\nstandard-bearers were as grave as the Mexican Indians who bore the\r\nsacred tapers. The democratic procession, also, like the Catholic\r\nprocession, had its halting places; it stopped before the houses of\r\nthe Jackson men to fill the air with cheers, and halted at the doors\r\nof the leaders of the Opposition, to give three, six, or nine groans.\r\nIf these scenes were to find a painter, they would be admired at a\r\ndistance, not less than the triumphs and sacrificial pomps, which the\r\nancients have left us delineated in marble and brass; for they are not\r\nmere grotesques after the manner of Rembrandt, they belong to history,\r\nthey partake of the grand; they are the episodes of a wondrous epic\r\nwhich will bequeath a lasting memory to posterity; that of the coming\r\nof democracy.\r\n\r\nYet as festivals and spectacles, these processions are much inferior\r\nto revivals, which take place in the camp-meetings. All festivals and\r\nceremonies in which woman does not take part, are incomplete. Why is it\r\nthat our constitutional ceremonies are so entirely devoid of interest?\r\nIt is not because the actors are merely commoners, very respectable\r\ncitizens surely, but very prosaic, and that the pomp of costumes and\r\nthe fascination of the arts, are banished from them; it is rather\r\nbecause women do not and cannot have a place in them. A wit has said\r\nthat women are not poets, but they are poetry itself.\r\n\r\nI remember what made the charm and the attraction of the processions\r\nin my provincial city. We opened our eyes with wonder at the red robe\r\nof the chief president; we gazed with delight at the epaulets and\r\ngold lace of the general, and more than one youth was inspired with\r\nmilitary ardour at that show; we stretched forward with impatience\r\nto catch a glimpse of the episcopal train; we threw ourselves on our\r\nknees mechanically, on the approach of the canopy with its escort of\r\npriests, and the venerable bishop, crowned with the mitre, and bearing\r\nthe host in his hands; we envied the glory of those boys, who had the\r\nprivilege of enacting St. Mark or St. Peter for the day; more than one\r\ntall stripling was glad to sink his fifteen years, in which he prided\r\nhimself, for the sake of taking the character of St. John, clad in a\r\nsheepskin; but the whole multitude held their breath, when, beneath the\r\nforest of banners, through the peaked frocks of the penitents and the\r\nbayonets of the garrison, amidst the surplices and albs of the priests,\r\nthere appeared in sight one of those young girls in white robes, who\r\nrepresented the holy women and the Mother of the seven woes; or she,\r\nwho in the person of St. Veronica, displayed the handkerchief, with\r\nwhich the sweat was wiped from the Saviour's brow as he ascended Mount\r\nCalvary; or she, who, loaded with gold chains, ribands, and pearls,\r\nrepresented the empress at the side of the emperor;[CZ] or those who\r\nhad just been confirmed by my lord bishop, and still bore the traces\r\nof the emotions excited by that solemn act. So it is because there are\r\nwomen in the camp-meetings, and because they take a not less active\r\npart in them than the most rousing preachers, and it is on this account\r\nonly, that the American democracy throngs to these assemblages. The\r\ncamp-meetings with their raving Pythonissas have made the fortune\r\nof the Methodists, and attracted to their church in America a more\r\nnumerous body of adherents than is numbered by any of the English sects\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nTake women from the tournaments, and they become nothing more than a\r\nfencing-bout; from camp-meetings take away the _anxious bench_, remove\r\nthose women who fall into convulsions, shriek, and roll on the ground,\r\nwho, pale, dishevelled, and haggard, cling to the minister from whom\r\nthey inhale the holy spirit, or seize the hardened sinner at the door\r\nof the tent, or in the passage-way, and strive to melt his stony\r\nheart; it will be in vain, that a majestic forest overshadows the\r\nscene, of a beautiful summer's night, under a sky that need not fear a\r\ncomparison with a Grecian heavens; in vain, will you be surrounded with\r\ntents and numberless chariots, that recall to mind the long train of\r\nIsrael fleeing from Egypt; in vain the distant fires, gleaming amongst\r\nthe trees, will reveal the forms of the preachers gesticulating above\r\nthe crowd; in vain, will the echo of the woods fling back the tones of\r\ntheir voice; you will be weary of the spectacle in an hour. But the\r\ncamp-meetings, as they are now conducted, have the power of holding the\r\npeople of the West for whole weeks; some have lasted a month.\r\n\r\nI allow that the camp-meetings and political processions are as yet\r\nonly exceptions in America. A people has not a complete national\r\ncharacter, until it has its peculiar and appropriate amusements,\r\nnational festivals, poetry. In this respect, it will not be easy to\r\ncreate American nationality; the American has no past from which to\r\ndraw inspiration. On quitting the old soil of Europe, on breaking off\r\nfrom England, his fathers left behind them the national chronicles, the\r\ntraditions, the legends, all that constitutes country, that country\r\nwhich is not carried about on the soles of one's feet. The American,\r\nthen, has become poor in ideality, in proportion as he has become rich\r\nin material wealth. But a democracy always has some resource, so far as\r\nimagination is concerned. I cannot pretend to decide how the American\r\ndemocracy will supply the want of a past and of old recollections, any\r\nmore than I can undertake to pronounce, in what manner it will bridle\r\nitself, and curb its own humours. But I am sure that America will have\r\nher festivals, her ceremonies, and her art, as I am that society in\r\nAmerica will assume a regular organisation; for I believe in the future\r\nof American society, or, to speak more correctly, of the beginnings of\r\nsociety, whose growth is visible on the east and still more on the\r\nwest of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nIn France we have been for more than a century struggling against\r\nourselves, in the attempt to lay aside our national originality. We\r\nare striving to become reasonable according to what we imagine to be\r\nthe English pattern; and after our example the Southern Europeans are\r\nendeavouring to torture themselves into a parliamentary and calculating\r\ndemeanour. Imagination is treated as a lunatic. Noble sentiments,\r\nenthusiasm, chivalric loftiness of soul, all that made the glory of\r\nFrance, and gave Spain half the world, is regarded with contempt and\r\nderision. The public festivals and popular ceremonies have become the\r\nlaughing-stock of the free thinkers. Love of the fine arts is nothing\r\nmore than a frivolous passion. We make the most desperate efforts to\r\nstarve the heart and soul, conformably to the prescriptions of our\r\nreligious and political Sangrados. To strip life of the last vestige\r\nof taste and art, we have gone so far as to exchange the majestic\r\nelegance of the costume, which we borrowed from the Spaniards when they\r\nruled Europe, for the undress of the English, which may be described\r\nin one word, as suited to the climate of Great Britain. This could be\r\nborne, if we had merely flung away our tournaments, our carousals, our\r\njubilees, our religious festivals, our elegance of garb. But unhappily\r\nwe have gone to the sources of all national and social poetry, to\r\nreligion itself, and tried to dry them up. Our manners and customs\r\nscarcely retain the slightest tincture of their boasted grace. Politics\r\nis abandoned to the dryest matter of fact. The national genius would\r\nhave to be given over as past cure, did not now and then some gleams\r\nand outbursts prove that it is not dead but sleeps, and that the holy\r\nfire is yet smouldering beneath the ashes.\r\n\r\nFrance, and the peoples of Southern Europe, of whom she is the\r\ncoryphæus, certainly owe much to the philosophy of the 18th century;\r\nfor that was our Protest, that raised the standard of liberty amongst\r\nus, opened a career for the progress of mind, and established\r\nindividuality. But it must be confessed that it is inferior to German,\r\nEnglish, and American Protestantism, because it is irreligious. The\r\nwritings of the Apostles of that great revolution will survive as\r\nliterary monuments, but not as lessons of morality; for whatever is\r\nirreligious, can have but a transient social value. Place the remains\r\nof Voltaire and Montesquieu, of Rousseau and Diderot, in the Pantheon;\r\nbut on their monuments deposit their works veiled under a shroud. Teach\r\nthe people to bless their memory; but do not teach it their doctrines,\r\nand do net permit it to learn them from servile followers, whom those\r\ngreat writers would disavow, if they could return to the earth; for men\r\nlike them belong to the present or a future age, but never to the past.\r\n\r\nIn return for all that has been taken from us, we have received the\r\nrepresentative system. This, it has been supposed, would satisfy\r\nall our wants, would meet all our wishes in moral and intellectual,\r\nas well as in physical things. Far be it from me to undervalue the\r\nrepresentative system! I believe in its permanency, although I doubt\r\nwhether we have yet discovered the form, under which it is suited to\r\nthe character of the French and the Southern Europeans; but whatever\r\nmay be its political value, it cannot be denied that it does not, that\r\nit never can, of itself alone, make good the place of all that the\r\nreformers have robbed us of. It has its ceremonies and its festivals;\r\nbut these smell too much of the parchment not to disgust our senses. It\r\nhas, to a certain degree, its dogmas and its mysteries, but it has no\r\nhold on the imagination. Art has no sympathy with it; it has not the\r\npower to move the heart; and it embraces, therefore, but one fourth of\r\nour existence.\r\n\r\nI can conceive how representative government should here be made the\r\nkey-stone of the social arch. An American of fifteen years of age is\r\nas reasonable as a Frenchman of forty. Then society here is wholly\r\nmasculine; woman, who in all countries has little of the spirit of\r\nthe representative system, here possesses no authority; there are\r\nno saloons in the United States. But even here the system no longer\r\nexists in its primitive purity except on paper. The field of religion,\r\nalthough much narrowed, it is true, still remains open here, and the\r\nimagination still finds food, however meagre, within its limits. But\r\namong us, it would be sheer fanaticism to set up the representative\r\nsystem as the pivot of social life. All of us, God be thanked, have\r\na period of youth! Among us, women have a real power, although not\r\nenumerated in the articles of the Charter; and our national character\r\nhas many feminine, I will not say effeminate, features. In vain would\r\nyou decimate France, and leave only the burghers of forty years, who\r\nhave the senses calmed, the mind clear of illusions, that is to say,\r\nunpoetical and dry; you would hardly then have a community that would\r\nbe satisfied with constitutional emotions.\r\n\r\nThis is the cause why France is the theatre of a perpetual struggle\r\nbetween the old and the middle-aged on one side, and the young, who\r\nfind their bounds too narrow, on the other. Youth accuses age of narrow\r\nviews, of timidity, of selfishness; the old complain of the greedy\r\nambition which devours the young, and of their ungovernable turbulence.\r\nThat is the only good government, which satisfies at once the demands\r\nfor order, regularity, stability and physical prosperity on the part\r\nof those of riper years, and fills the longings of the young, and of\r\nthat portion of society which always continues youthful, for lively\r\nsensations, brilliant schemes, and lofty aspirations. By the side of\r\ntheir parliament, the English have their vast colonies, by which this\r\nspirit finds vent, over the remotest seas. The Anglo-Americans have\r\nthe West, and also, like Great Britain, the ocean. This double invasion\r\nof the East by the fathers, and of the West by the emancipated sons, is\r\na spectacle of gigantic magnitude and sublime interest. To suppose that\r\nwe, who stand in need of some vast enterprise, in which some may play a\r\npart before the eyes of the world, and others may enjoy the spectacle\r\nof their prowess,--to suppose that we shall be content to be forever\r\nimprisoned within our own territory, with no other occupation than\r\nthat of watching or turning the wheels of the representative machine,\r\nwould be to wish that a man of taste, confined to this paltry hamlet of\r\nBedford, should imagine himself in paradise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[CZ] This is one of the recollections of the Roman empire, which has\r\nleft deep impressions in the South of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nPOWER AND LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       RICHMOND, AUG. 16, 1835.\r\n\r\nRichmond stands in an admirable situation on the slope of a hill whose\r\nbase is bathed by the James River. Its Capitol, with its brick columns\r\ncovered with plaster, with its cornice and architrave of painted\r\nwood, produces an effect, at a distance, which even the Parthenon,\r\nin the days of Pericles, could not have surpassed; for the sky of\r\nVirginia, when it is not darkened by a storm, or veiled with snow, is\r\nas beautiful as that of Attica. Richmond has its port nearer than the\r\nPiræus was to Athens, while, at the same time it stands upon the falls\r\nof James River. Richmond enchanted me from the first by its charming\r\nsituation and the cordiality of its inhabitants; and it pleases me by\r\nits ambition, for it aspires to be a metropolis, and it is making the\r\ndue preparations to assume that character by the great works which it\r\nis executing or aiding to execute, canals, railroads, water-works, huge\r\nmills, workshops, for which the fall in the river affords an almost\r\nunlimited motive power. Here I also found some countrymen, whose love\r\nfor their country had not been chilled by fifty years of absence and\r\neighty years of age, and who have preserved, amidst the simplicity of\r\nAmerican manners, that fine flower of courtesy, of which the germ is\r\ndaily disappearing amongst us. I went yesterday, for the second time,\r\nto visit the cannon and mortars, given to America during her struggle\r\nfor independence, by Louis XVI. In the Capitol, by the side of the\r\nstatue of Washington, I found the bust of Lafayette. I heard the names\r\nof Rochambeau and d'Estaing pronounced, as if they were old friends\r\nwho had left but yesterday. I seem to myself, at times to have been\r\nmiraculously transported, not into France, but on the frontiers.\r\n\r\nMy admiration of Richmond is not, however, blind; the founders of the\r\nnew city have plotted out streets one hundred feet wide, like the\r\nhighways in the style of Louis XIV.; but in our great roads, between\r\nthe quagmires on the right and left, there is at least a strip of\r\npassable pavement or roadway. The streets of new Richmond have neither\r\npavement nor light. In the rainy season, they are dangerous bogs,\r\nin which, I am told, that several cows, who are here allowed by the\r\nmunicipal authorities to go at large, have met with the fate of the\r\nmaster of Ravensworth in the Kelpie. Richmond has, also, something of\r\nthe aspect of Washington; with the exception of the business part of\r\nthe town, it is neither city nor country; the houses are scattered\r\nabout on an imaginary plan, and it is almost impossible to find any\r\nlines to guide you, or to recognise the street K, F, or D, to which\r\nyou are referred; for the alphabet has furnished the names here, as the\r\narithmetic has done at Washington. The plot of Richmond has, however,\r\nthis advantage over that of Washington, that it is on a smaller scale\r\nand will be more speedily filled up; whilst Washington with its\r\narrangements for a million inhabitants, will not, perhaps, have fifty\r\nthousand, twenty years hence.\r\n\r\nThere is something in Richmond which offends me more than its\r\nbottomless mudholes, and shocks me more than the rudeness of the\r\nwestern Virginians,[DA] whom I met here during the session of the\r\nlegislature; it is slavery. Half of the population is black or mulatto;\r\nphysically, the negroes are well used in Virginia, partly from motives\r\nof humanity, and partly, because they are so much live stock raised for\r\nexportation to Louisiana; morally, they are treated as if they did not\r\nbelong to the human race. Free or slave, the black is here denied all\r\nthat can give him the dignity of man. The law forbids the instruction\r\nof the slave or the free man of colour in the simplest rudiments of\r\nlearning, under the severest penalties; the slave has no family; he has\r\nno civil rights; he holds no property. The white man knows that the\r\nslave has opened his ear to the word which every thing here proclaims\r\naloud, liberty; he knows that in secret the negro broods over hopes and\r\nschemes of vengeance, and that the exploits and martyrdom of Gabriel,\r\nthe leader of an old conspiracy, and of Turner, the hero of a more\r\nrecent insurrection, are still related in the negro cabins.[DB] The\r\nprecautionary measures which this knowledge has induced the whites to\r\nadopt, are such as freeze the heart of a stranger with horror.\r\n\r\nRichmond is noted for its tobacco and flour market. The Richmond flour\r\nis prized at Rio Janeiro as much as at New York, at Lima as well\r\nas at Havana. The largest flour-mill in the world is at Richmond,\r\nrunning twenty pair of stones, containing a great variety of accessory\r\nmachinery, and capable of manufacturing 600 barrels of flour a day. The\r\nreputation of the Richmond flour in foreign markets, like that of the\r\nAmerican flour in general, depends upon a system of inspection peculiar\r\nto the country, which contravenes, indeed, the theory of absolute\r\ncommercial freedom, but is essential to the prosperity of American\r\ncommerce, and has never, that I have heard of, been a subject of\r\ncomplaint. The flour is inspected previous to its being exported. The\r\nweight of each barrel and the quality of of the flour are ascertained\r\nby the inspector, and branded on the barrel-head. The superior\r\nqualities only can be exported; the inspection is real and thorough,\r\nand is performed at the expense of the holder. The Havana, Brazilian,\r\nor Peruvian merchant is thus perfectly sure of the quality of the\r\nmerchandise he buys; both the buyer and the seller find their advantage\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nCommerce can no more dispense with confidence in the market than with\r\ncredit in the counting-house.\r\n\r\nTobacco is subjected to the same system of inspection, and in general,\r\nall the coast States, all those from which produce is exported to\r\nforeign parts, have established this system, and applied it to almost\r\nall articles in which frauds can be committed. Thus in New York\r\nwheat-flour and Indian corn-meal, beef, pork, salt fish, potash, whale\r\noil, lumber, staves, flax-seed, leather, tobacco, hops, spirits, are\r\nall inspected. In regard to flour, the law is more rigourous than in\r\nrespect to other articles. The inspector brands with the word _light_\r\nthose barrels which are not of the legal weight, and the exportation of\r\nwhich is also prohibited, and with the word _bad_ those which are of\r\npoor quality. As for Indian corn, it is required that the grain shall\r\nhave been kiln-dried before grinding. Flour from other States cannot\r\nbe sold in the city of New York, even for local consumption, unless it\r\nhas been inspected the same as if for exportation. Every inspector has\r\nthe right to search vessels in which he suspects that there is flour\r\nthat has not been inspected, and to seize what has been so shipped,\r\nor what it has been attempted to ship. There are beside various other\r\nprovisions and penalties to prevent fraud.\r\n\r\nIf the necessity of these inspections were not sufficiently proved by\r\ntheir good effects and by long experience, it would be by the abuses\r\nthat prevail in those articles of commerce which are not subjected to\r\nthe system. Complaints have already been made in Liverpool, that bales\r\nof cotton are often made up of an inferior article concealed beneath\r\nan outer layer of good quality. From a report addressed to the Chamber\r\nof American Commerce in this metropolis of the cotton trade, by the\r\nprincipal cotton-brokers, it appears that this has not been confined to\r\ntwo or three bales, amidst large quantities, but that whole lots of one\r\nor two hundred bales have been found thus deficient.\r\n\r\nWhat! it will be said, is there not, then, freedom of commerce in this\r\nclassic land of liberty? No! the foreign commerce is not free in the\r\nUnited States, because the American people is not willing to expose\r\nthe industry and commerce of a whole country to be ruined by the\r\nfirst rogue that comes along. The people of this country is eminently\r\na working people; every one is at liberty to work, to choose his\r\nprofession, and to change it twenty times; every one has the right\r\nto go and come on his business, at pleasure, and to transport his\r\nperson and his industry from the centre to the circumference, and from\r\nthe circumference to the centre. If the country does not enjoy the\r\npolitical advantages of administrative unity, neither is it hampered in\r\nthe most petty details of industry by excessive centralisation. No man\r\nis obliged to go six hundred miles to solicit the license and personal\r\nsignature of a minister, overloaded with business, and harassed by\r\nparliamentary solicitudes. But American liberty is not a mystical,\r\nundefined liberty; it is a practical liberty, in harmony with the\r\npeculiar genius of the people and its peculiar destiny; it is a liberty\r\nof action and motion, of which the American avails himself to spread\r\nhimself over the vast territory that Providence has given him, and to\r\nsubdue it to his uses. The liberty of locomotion is almost absolute\r\nwith the exception of some restraints imposed by the observance of the\r\nSabbath. The liberty, or rather independence, in matters of industry\r\nis also ample; but if it is abused by some individuals, the general\r\ntendency is to restrain them by law or by dictatorial measures, or by\r\nthe influence of public opinion, sometimes expressed in the shape of\r\nmobs.\r\n\r\nThe restraints on internal trade are few; there are, however, some\r\nrestrictions upon hawkers and pedlers who impose on the credulity\r\nof the country people. If no effective bankrupt-law has yet been\r\nenacted, severe penalties are provided against false pretences. If\r\nstock-jobbing has not been prohibited, it is not from want of will on\r\nthe part of the legislators, for they are fully alive to the evils\r\nof unproductive speculation, which diverts from industry the needful\r\ncapital; but because they do not see how it is to be effectually\r\nprevented. Besides, it is not easy to commit frauds in the United\r\nStates, in the home trade; for here every body knows every body else,\r\nand every one is on the watch against others; and it is not difficult\r\nto ascend to the sources of a fraud. In respect to articles designed\r\nfor the foreign trade, detection is not so easy. There is also here a\r\nsort of patriotism, which is by no means at war with the real interests\r\nof the parties, and which operates with the fear of public opinion, in\r\nkeeping up a certain degree of honesty in domestic transactions, and\r\na tone of morality, which, if not wholly above reproach, is certainly\r\nfar superior to what prevails amongst us; whilst, to many persons, all\r\nis fair in dealings with foreigners, whom they look upon as a kind of\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1789, we had numerous restrictions not only on foreign\r\ncommerce, but on domestic industry, in France. These were all blown\r\naway by the Revolution; and certainly the destruction of most of them,\r\nwhich had become antiquated and inapplicable to the existing state of\r\nthings, was a great gain; but we have run into the contrary extreme,\r\nand abolished not only the burdensome restraints, but the most salutary\r\nchecks, and among them the inspection of exported articles. Yet on\r\nthe whole we have gained in respect to domestic industry, by sweeping\r\naway those often cumbersome regulations; but in regard to our foreign\r\ntrade, the evil has certainly overborne the good, as the decline of our\r\nmaritime commerce fully proves.\r\n\r\nOn the peace of 1814, when the sea was again opened to our vessels,\r\nour foreign commerce fell into the hands of petty traffickers, whose\r\ncupidity exhausted the vocabulary of fraud. During the first years\r\nafter the Restoration, the French name became discredited in all the\r\nmarkets of the Old and the New World. The Levant trade, of which we\r\nhad the monopoly, passed into the hands of the English and Austrians.\r\nThe stuffs, with which we formerly supplied the East, being no longer\r\nsubject to inspection on exportation, fell short in measure and were\r\ninferior in quality. Formerly packages of our goods changed hands\r\nwithout distrust and without search; but it became necessary to submit\r\nthem to a rigourous examination, for their contents often turned out\r\nto be quite different from the invoice. South America was the great\r\ntheatre of these frauds; water was actually sold for Burgundy, rolls\r\nof wood for rolls of ribands. The Bordelese, who, not without reason,\r\ncharge the prohibitive system with the decline of their prosperity,\r\ncannot be blind to the fact, that their own unscrupulous rapacity\r\ncontributed pretty largely to this result.\r\n\r\nAs customers could no longer be found to deal with us, these frauds\r\nhave necessarily been checked. Our foreign trade has gradually fallen\r\ninto the hands of a few great houses, and this concentration, which\r\nhas powerfully contributed to the prevalence of honorable dealings in\r\nEnglish commerce, has done something towards reviving ours. The small\r\ndealers have been driven out of the field; and it is to this cause that\r\nwe have to attribute the good condition of our trade with the United\r\nStates. But let us not deceive ourselves; some sleights of hand are\r\nstill played off; Bordeaux is not yet wholly purged of the infection;\r\nFrench commerce abroad is yet cankered by foul sores. It must be\r\nconfessed, that, if our public policy has been marked by a good faith\r\nand a spirit of disinterestedness, that give us a right to denounce the\r\nPunic faith of _perfidious Albion_, the English race can proudly oppose\r\nthe bold and honourable spirit of its commercial dealings to the\r\npusillanimity and unworthy shifts of our own. Let us confess our shame,\r\nand submit to the necessary diet for the cure of so loathsome a leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe United States constitute a society which moves under the impulse\r\nand by the guidance of instinct, rather than according to any\r\npremeditated plan; it does not know itself. It rejects the tyranny of\r\na past, which is exclusively military in its character, and yet it is\r\ndeeply imbued with the sentiment of order. It has been nurtured in\r\nthe hatred of the old political systems of Europe; but a feeling of\r\nthe necessity of self-restraint runs through its veins. It is divided\r\nbetween its instinctive perceptions of the future and its aversion to\r\nthe past; between its thirst after freedom, and its hunger for social\r\norder; between its religious veneration of experience, and its horror\r\nof the violence of past ages. Hence the apparent contradictions which\r\nappear in its tastes and its tendencies; but the confusion is only\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nIn each State there are two authorities, distinct in their composition\r\nand their attributes. The one corresponds to the government in the\r\nEuropean social system, to the old Cæsar. At its head is a magistrate\r\nwho bears the old name of Governor,[DC] with the pompous title of\r\ncommander-in-chief of the sea and land forces. This authority is\r\nreduced to a shadow. In the new States of the West, which have come\r\ninto the world since the establishment of Independence, its attributes\r\nhave been gradually suppressed, or rather the citizens have reserved\r\nthe exercise of them to themselves. Thus the people itself appoint most\r\nof the public officers. The management of funds is rarely confided\r\nto the Governor, but is generally entrusted to a special board of\r\nCommissioners. The Governor has not the control of the forces of the\r\nState; strictly speaking, indeed, there are none; but in case of\r\nnecessity, the Sheriff has the right to summon the _posse comitatus_,\r\nand to oblige all bystanders, armed or not, to render him assistance,\r\nand to act as police officers. There is no regular police, there are\r\nno passports; but nobody can stop at an inn without entering his name\r\nand residence on the register. This register is open to the examination\r\nof all in the bar-room, which is a necessary appendage of every public\r\nplace, and there it remains at all times to be turned over by all. The\r\nbar-keeper fills, in fact, the post of commissioner of police, and the\r\ncrowd that assembles in the bar-room to read the newspapers, smoke,\r\ndrink whiskey, and talk politics, that is to say all travellers, would,\r\nin case of necessity, be ready to act the part of constables. This is\r\nreal self-government; these are the obligations and responsibilities,\r\nthat every citizen takes upon himself when he disarms authority. The\r\npower of the Governor, who was formerly the representative of royalty,\r\nthe brilliant reflexion of the omnipotence of the proud monarchs of\r\nEurope, is crumbled to dust. Even the exterior of power has not been\r\nkept up; he has no guards, no palace, no money. The Governors of\r\nIndiana and Illinois have a salary of 1000 dollars a year, without a\r\nhouse or any accessories. There is not a trader in Cincinnati, who\r\ndoes not pay his head-clerk better; the clerks at Washington have 700\r\ndollars a year.\r\n\r\nThis fall of power is to be explained by other considerations than\r\nthose drawn from the principle of self-government. The ancient power\r\nwas Cæsar, was military in its character. American society has denied\r\nCæsar. In Europe, it has been necessary that Cæsar should be strong\r\nfor the security of national independence; for in Europe we are always\r\non the eve of war. The United States, on the contrary, are organised\r\non the principle, that war between the States is an impossibility, and\r\nthat a foreign war is scarcely probable. The Americans, therefore, can\r\ndispense with Cæsar, but we are obliged to cleave to him. Yet it is not\r\nto be inferred that they can and will long dispense with authority, or\r\nthat they are even now free from its control. There is, in America,\r\nreligious authority, which never closes its eyes; there is the\r\nauthority of opinion, which is severe to rigour; there is the authority\r\nof the legislatures, which sometimes savours of the omnipotence of\r\nparliament; there is the dictatorial authority of mobs.\r\n\r\nStill more; by the side of the power of Cæsar, in political affairs,\r\nanother regular authority is beginning to show itself, which embraces\r\nwithin its domain the modern institutions and new establishments of\r\npublic utility, such as the public routes, banks, and elementary\r\nschools, that, in the United States, have acquired an unparallelled\r\nmagnitude. Thus there are Canal Commissioners, Bank Commissioners,\r\nSchool Commissioners. Their power is great and real. The Canal\r\nCommissioners establish administrative regulations, which they change\r\nat will, without previous notice. They fix and change the rate of\r\ntolls; they are surrounded by a large body of agents, entirely\r\ndependent upon them and removeable at pleasure; they are charged with\r\nthe management of large sums of money; the sums that passed through the\r\nhands of the Pennsylvania Commissioners amounted to nearly 23,000,000\r\ndollars. They are certainly subjected to a less minute and rigourous\r\ncontrol, than is extended to the most trifling affairs of our Board of\r\nPublic Works or our Engineer Department. If they had had our financial\r\nregulations, our system of responsibility, our court of accounts, they\r\nwould, certainly, have spent ten years more in executing the works\r\nentrusted to them, and they would have executed them no better and\r\nno cheaper. The Bank Commissioners in the State of New York, by the\r\nprovisions of the Safety Fund Act, are clothed, by right, if not in\r\nfact, with a sort of dictatorship; they have, in certain cases, power\r\nof life and death over the banks.\r\n\r\nIt is in the new States, especially, that one should see the\r\nCommissioners exercise their powers. Last summer the Ohio Canal\r\nCommissioners, perceiving or thinking that they perceived, a conspiracy\r\namong the persons engaged in the transportation of goods on the\r\nNew York canals to raise the rates of freight, immediately adopted\r\na resolution to this effect; whereas certain persons have shown a\r\ndisposition to make exorbitant charges, the rates of toll on all\r\narticles that may have paid on the New York canal, above a certain\r\nrate of freight, shall be double. This was establishing a _maximum_,\r\nnot only on their own territory, but on that of a neighbouring State.\r\nA director-general of our public routes, who should take such a\r\nliberty, would be forthwith denounced as violating the principles of\r\ncommercial freedom. In the United States, every body agrees that the\r\nOhio Commissioners were right; that the profits of the transportation\r\ncompanies would be somewhat less, but the public would be the gainer,\r\nand the former accordingly submitted.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, then, the general weal is the supreme law; and it\r\nimmediately raises its head and vindicates its rights, when it feels\r\nthe encroachments of private interest. The system of government in this\r\ncountry is, therefore, not so much a system of absolute liberty and\r\nfree will, as a system of equality, or rather it takes the character\r\nof a strong rule by the majority. In looking at some of the provisions\r\nin the charters of incorporated companies, one is tempted to ask how\r\nassociations could be formed on such conditions, and how they have\r\nbeen able to procure capital. In Massachusetts, the share-holders are\r\nindividually responsible for the debts of the company. In Pennsylvania,\r\nit is expressly provided, that, if at any time the privileges granted\r\nto the corporation shall prove to be contrary to the public good, the\r\nlegislature may revoke them. This is the germ of despotism; but in\r\nthe United States, Cæsar is disarmed; the old feudal line has neither\r\nfangs nor claws. Industry is prompt to take alarm at the exercise of\r\ndespotism by Cæsar; but it is only in extreme cases, that it will feel\r\nany distrust of a society which lives and flourishes by labour, and all\r\nwhose ends and aims, public and private, are self-aggrandisement by\r\nmeans of productive labour.\r\n\r\nTo understand fully the meaning of the word liberty, as it is used in\r\nthis country, it is necessary to go to the sources of the American\r\npopulation; that is to say, to the origin of the distinction between\r\nthe Yankee and the Virginian race. They have arrived at their notions\r\nof liberty by different avenues, the one by the gate of religion, and\r\nthe other by that of politics, and have, therefore, understood it very\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nWhen the Yankee came to settle himself in the New World, it was not for\r\nthe purpose of founding an empire, but to establish a church. He fled\r\nfrom a land, which had shaken off the yoke of the papal Babylon, only\r\nto fall under that of the Babylon of episcopacy. He left behind him\r\nSatan, his pomp, and his works; he shook from the soles of his feet the\r\ndust of the inhospitable land of the Stuarts and the Anglican bishops;\r\nhe sought a refuge in which he might practise his own mode of worship\r\nand obey what he believed to be the law of God. The Pilgrims, landed\r\non Plymouth rock, established a liberty according to their own notion;\r\nit was a liberty for their own use exclusively, within whose embrace\r\nthey felt perfectly at ease themselves, without caring if others\r\nwere stifled by it. It might have been expected, that, proscribed\r\nthemselves, they would at least have admitted religious toleration; but\r\nthey did not grant it the narrowest corner, and even now it is far from\r\nhaving elbow room among them. Originally, the right of citizenship was\r\nextended only to Puritans like themselves; the state and the church\r\nwere confounded; it was not until 1832 that they were definitely and\r\ncompletely separated in Massachusetts. The Jew and the Quaker were\r\nforbidden to touch the soil under the severest penalties, and in case\r\nof return, under pain of death. At present, if the law tolerates the\r\nRoman Catholic, public opinion does not, as the burning of the Ursuline\r\nconvent in 1834, and the scandalous scenes exhibited at the trials\r\nof the incendiaries, testify. Still less mercy is shown to unbelief;\r\nwitness the trial of Abner Kneeland for blasphemy, on account of his\r\npantheistic writings.[DD]\r\n\r\nThe Yankee type exhibits little variety; all Yankees seem to be cast\r\nin the same mould; it was, therefore, very easy for them to organise\r\na system of liberty for themselves, that is, to construct a frame,\r\nwithin which they should have the necessary freedom of motion. On their\r\narrival they accordingly formed the plan of one, not merely tracing its\r\ngeneral outlines and form, but dividing it into numerous compartments\r\ncontrolling all the details of life, with as much minuteness as\r\nthe Mosaic law did that of the Hebrews. Thus organised, it became\r\nimpossible for any man not cut to the same pattern, to establish\r\nhimself among them. Although most of those laws which thus reduced life\r\nto rules,[DE] have been abrogated, especially since the Revolution,\r\nstill their spirit survives. The habits which gave them birth, and to\r\nwhich, by a natural reaction, they gave strength, still exist, and to\r\nthis day it is observable, that no foreigner settles in New England.\r\n\r\nAs for us, who resemble each other in nothing, except in differing from\r\nevery body else, for us, to whom variety is as necessary as the air, to\r\nwhom a life of rules would be a subject of horrour, the Yankee system\r\nwould be torture. Their liberty is not the liberty to outrage all that\r\nis sacred on earth, to set religion at defiance, to laugh morals to\r\nscorn, to undermine the foundations of social order, to mock at all\r\ntraditions and all received opinions; it is neither the liberty of\r\nbeing a monarchist in a republican country, nor that of sacrificing the\r\nhonour of the poor man's wife or daughter to one's base passions; it\r\nis not even the liberty to enjoy one's wealth by a public display, for\r\npublic opinion has its sumptuary laws, to which all must conform under\r\npain of moral outlawry; nor even that of living in private different\r\nfrom the rest of the world. The liberty of the Yankee is essentially\r\nlimited and special like the nature of the race. We should consider it\r\nas framed after the model of the liberty of Figaro; but the Yankee is\r\nsatisfied with it, because it leaves him all the latitude he desires,\r\nand because of all the lessons of the Bible, that of the forbidden\r\nfruit, which we have not been able to fix in our brain, has made the\r\ndeepest impression on his.\r\n\r\nAs the Yankee does not suffer under these restraints, as he is, or what\r\namounts to the same thing, thinks himself, free, a preventive authority\r\nis unnecessary for him. This is the reason why there is no appearance\r\nof authority in New England, and that an armed force, a police, are\r\neven more unknown there than in the rest of the Union. The absence\r\nof a visible authority imposes on us, and we think that the American\r\nin general, and the Yankee in particular, is more free than we are.\r\nI am persuaded, however, that if we measure liberty by the number of\r\nactions that are permitted or tolerated in public and private life, the\r\nadvantage is on our side, not only in comparison with New England, but\r\nalso with the white population of the South.\r\n\r\nThe Virginian is more disposed to understand liberty in our manner.\r\nHis disposition has a greater resemblance to ours; his faculties are\r\nmuch less special, more general than those of the Yankee; his mind is\r\nmore ardent, his tastes more varied. But it is the Yankee that now\r\nrules the Union; it is his liberty which has given its principal\r\nfeatures to the model of American liberty. Yet to extend its empire,\r\nit has been obliged to borrow some of the characteristic traits\r\nof Virginian liberty; or, I might say, of French liberty, for the\r\nhigh-priest of American democracy was a Virginian, who had imbibed in\r\nParis the doctrines of the philosophy of the 18th century. American\r\nliberty, as it now is, may be considered the result of a mixture, in\r\nunequal proportions, of the theories of Jefferson with the New England\r\nusages. From these dissimilar tendencies has resulted a series of\r\ncontradictory measures, which have become strangely complicated with\r\neach other, and which might puzzle and deceive a careless observer. It\r\nis in consequence of these opposite influences in the bosom of American\r\nsociety, that such conflicting judgments have been passed upon it;\r\nit is because the Yankee type is at present the stronger, whilst the\r\nVirginian was superior in the period of the revolution, that the ideas\r\nwhich the sight of America now suggests, are so different from those\r\nwhich she inspired at the epoch of Independence.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DA] When the assembly is in session, Richmond is full of country\r\ngentlemen from Western Virginia, real giants, taller, stouter, and\r\nbroader than the giants who are exhibited among us for money. When\r\nI found myself surrounded by these men, with their loud voices and\r\nHerculean frame, I experienced the same feeling with the companions\r\nof Magellan, when they found themselves alone amidst a crowd of\r\nPatagonians. These good people, to testify their good will, lavish\r\nupon you the same weighty caresses, as those which the Spaniards at\r\nfirst took for blows, and when you feel their heavy hands fall like\r\na sledge upon your European shoulders, nothing less than the frank\r\nsmile that lights up their broad faces, would convince you of their\r\nfriendly disposition. The first time I was in Richmond, I occupied the\r\nchamber, that had just been left by one of these gentlemen; wishing to\r\nconsult some of the papers of the session, I sought in vain for any\r\nthing like his library. His whole parliamentary outfit consisted of a\r\nmass of empty bottles, a barrel of biscuit, a case of liquors, and the\r\nfragments of a huge cheese.\r\n\r\n[DB] A gang of negroes rose against their masters in Southampton in\r\n1831, and murdered several white families, without distinction of age\r\nor sex, and the alarm became general through the country. The murderers\r\nwere soon captured and executed.\r\n\r\n[DC] The respect of the Americans for old names and titles is shown in\r\ntheir retaining most of those that were in use under the English rule.\r\nThus the States are divided into counties, and there are in several\r\ntowns, for instance, in Charleston, a King's Street and a Queen's\r\nStreet. In Virginia, there are Prince Edward's, Prince George's,\r\nKing's and Queen's, King George's and King William's Counties. Georgia\r\nretained its name, even when at war with the monarch in honour of\r\nwhom it bore it. I was very much surprised to hear a court of justice\r\nin Pennsylvania opened with the old French word _oyez! oyez! oyez!_\r\nrepeated by the crier, without his understanding the meaning. The\r\nEnglish received it from the Normans, and the Americans have retained\r\nit, because they received it from their fathers. In France we not only\r\nchanged the name of Choisy-le-Roi into Choisy-le-Peuple, but we even\r\nsuppressed the prefix of Saint, in the names of the Streets.\r\n\r\n[DD] It is unnecessary to say that the author has here fallen into a\r\ngross error. Even in the affair of the convent at Charlestown, it was\r\nthe supposed abuse of a particular institution, not the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion itself, that kindled the flame.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[DE] I doubt if the power of the community over the individual has\r\nbeen pushed to such an extent anywhere else as in New England; in\r\nConnecticut there were laws forbidding a person to continue tippling\r\nmore than half an hour at a tavern, or to drink more than half a\r\npint of wine, and it was ordered that taverns and victualling-houses\r\nshould be closed at half past nine o'clock. No young man not married\r\ncould keep house without the consent of the town; and no housekeeper\r\ncould receive a young man to sojourn in his family without the same\r\npermission. Laws were made against swearing, lying, uttering false news\r\nor reports, or using tobacco without a certificate from a physician\r\nthat it was necessary to health. Other regulations prohibited smoking\r\nin public places, and this very year the city government of Boston has\r\nforbidden smoking in the Mall, which, however, I do not consider a\r\nmeasure of excessive rigour. It is unnecessary to say that the laws of\r\nthe New England colonies were extremely severe in religious matters;\r\nevery individual was required to join some Congregational society,\r\nand no one was eligible to any public trust, unless he had so done.\r\nDissenters were taxed for the support of the established church. Jews\r\nand Quakers were banished, and forbidden to return under pain of death.\r\nThe _Blue Laws_ of Connecticut contained some curious provisions in\r\nrespect to marriage, and at Taunton, in Massachusetts, in 1836, two\r\njustices forbade the bans of matrimony, on the ground that the parties\r\ncould not provide for themselves after the marriage, and that they had\r\nnot sufficient discernment to enter into a contract of such moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL IMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CHARLESTON, SEPTEMBER 1, 1835.\r\n\r\nThe United States are certainly the land of promise for the labouring\r\nclass. What a contrast between our Europe and America! After landing\r\nin New York, I thought every day was Sunday, for the whole population\r\nthat throngs Broadway seemed to be arrayed in their Sunday's best.\r\nNone of those countenances ghastly with the privations or the foul\r\nair of Paris; nothing like our wretched scavengers, our ragmen, and\r\ncorresponding classes of the other sex. Every man was warmly clad\r\nin an outer garment; every woman had her cloak and bonnet of the\r\nlatest Paris fashion. Rags, filth, and suffering degrade the woman\r\neven more than the man; and one of the most striking features in the\r\nphysiognomy of the United States, is, undeniably, the change which\r\nhas been introduced, in the train of the general prosperity, into\r\nthe physical condition of women.[DF] The earnings of the man being\r\nsufficient for the support of the family, the woman has no other duties\r\nthan the care of the household, a circumstance still more advantageous\r\nfor her children than for herself. It is now a universal rule among\r\nthe Anglo-Americans, that the woman is exempt from all heavy work,\r\nand she is never seen, for instance, taking part in the labours of\r\nthe field, nor in carrying burdens.[DG] Thus freed from employments\r\nunsuited to her delicate constitution, the sex has also escaped that\r\nhideous ugliness and repulsive coarseness of complexion which toil and\r\nprivation every where else bring upon them. Every woman here has the\r\nfeatures as well as the dress of a lady; every woman here is called\r\na lady, and strives to appear so. You would search in vain among the\r\nAnglo-Americans, from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to that of the\r\nMississippi, for one of those wretched objects, who are feminine only\r\nwith the physiologist, in whom our cities abound, or for one of those\r\nhaggish beldams that fill our markets and three fourths of our fields.\r\nYou will find specimens of the former class only among the Indians\r\nand negroes, and of the latter, only among the Canadian French and\r\nPennsylvania Germans; for their women labour at least as much as the\r\nmen. It is the glory of the English race, that they have ever and every\r\nwhere, as much as possible, interpreted the superiority of the man\r\nto the woman, as reserving to the former the charge of the ruder and\r\nharder forms of toil. A country in which woman is treated according to\r\nthis principle presents the aspect of a new and better world.\r\n\r\nFigure to yourself an Irish peasant, who at home could scarcely earn\r\nenough to live on potatoes, who would look upon himself as a rich man\r\nif he owned an acre of ground, but who, on stepping ashore at New York,\r\nfinds himself able to earn a dollar a day by the mere strength of his\r\narm. He feeds and lodges himself for two dollars a week, and at the end\r\nof a fortnight he may have saved enough to buy ten acres of the most\r\nfertile land in the world. The distance from New York to the West, is\r\ngreat, it is true; but the fare on the great canal is trifling, and\r\nhe can easily pay his way by the work of his hands. It is also true,\r\nthat the poorest Irishman would not think of buying so little as ten\r\nacres; the least that one buys in the West is eighty. What of that?\r\nThe savings of a few months will enable him to compass them; besides,\r\n_Uncle Sam_ favours emigrants, and if, in theory, he does not sell his\r\nland on credit, he is, in fact, very indulgent to the pioneer who comes\r\nto subdue the savage wilderness, and he allows him to occupy the soil\r\ntemporarily without charge. Thus the Irish, who would go to fisticuffs\r\nwith any body for denying in their presence that the isle of Erin was\r\na terrestrial paradise, and who, under the inspiration of whiskey,\r\nsing the glories of that _first pearl of the sea_, quit it by fifty\r\nthousands for the United States. On their arrival, they cannot believe\r\ntheir own eyes; they feel of themselves to find out whether they are\r\nnot under some spell. They do not dare to describe to their friends in\r\nEurope the streams of milk and honey that flow through this promised\r\nland.[DH]\r\n\r\nEven in this section of the country, where the workman in the towns\r\nand the labourer in the country, instead of being as in the North the\r\nsovereigns of the country, are slaves, there is more plenty, more\r\nphysical comfort among the labouring class than is found amongst\r\nus. The coloured population, therefore, increases in numbers faster\r\nthan our rural population. Not that our peasant gives birth to\r\nfewer children than the blacks of Virginia and Carolina; but death,\r\nled by the hand of want, is active in keeping down the excessive\r\nmultiplication of arms that would soon become formidable competitors\r\nof the fathers, and in closing forever mouths that would cry for\r\nbread which their parents could not supply. The attention of the\r\nbenevolent in Europe has long been directed towards the reduction of\r\nthe public expenditures, and a more equal distribution of the burden of\r\ntaxation, as a means of improving the condition of the poor; but all\r\nthese plans, supposing them to succeed according to the views of the\r\nprojectors, would merely amount to taking a few coppers less from the\r\npockets of the poorer class. Whilst a system of measures concerted in\r\nsuch a manner as to diffuse among them a love of order and habits of\r\nregularity and industry, to enlarge the field of labour, and to render\r\nits terms more favourable to them, would have the effect to fill those\r\npockets. The relief of one class of the community by merely shifting\r\nits burden to the back of another, has a revolutionary character\r\nwhich ill agrees with the notions of a generation that is weary of\r\nrevolutions, or with the nature of a government established for the\r\nvery purpose of staying the revolutionary flood; on the contrary, all\r\nthat develops the resources of industry is in harmony with the present\r\nleaning of all minds. Labour is an admirable instrument of concord, for\r\nall interests gain by the prosperity of industry. This is the pure and\r\ntrue source of all wealth, public and private. Labour alone creates;\r\nand it is it alone that can relieve the wants of the needy, without\r\nimpoverishing him who has enough, or even reducing the luxury of the\r\nopulent; that can give wealth to some, competency to others, and to all\r\n_the fowl in the pot_, which, since the revolt of Luther, has been the\r\ngreat social problem in the material order of things.\r\n\r\nThe admirable prosperity of the United States is the fruit of\r\nlabour, much more than of any reform in taxation. The soil has not\r\nthe luxuriant fertility of the tropical regions; roasted larks fly\r\ninto nobody's mouth; but the American is a model of industry. This\r\ncountry is not a second edition of the Greek and Roman republics; it\r\nis a gigantic commercial house, which owns its wheat-fields in the\r\nNorthwest, its cotton, rice and tobacco plantations in the South, which\r\nmaintains its sugar works, its establishments for salting provisions,\r\nand some good beginnings of manufactures, which has its harbours\r\nin the Northeast thronged with fine ships, well built and better\r\nmanned, by means of which it undertakes to carry for the world, and to\r\nspeculate on the wants of all nations. Every American has a passion\r\nfor work, and the means of gratifying it. If he wishes to cultivate\r\nthe ground, he finds waste land enough for his farm in the Northwest\r\nor the Southwest. If he chooses to be a mechanic, that he may finally\r\nbecome a manufacturer, he has no difficulty in getting credit; he\r\nfinds unemployed waterfalls all along the rivers, of which he takes\r\npossession, and on which he sets up his wheels. If he has a taste for\r\ncommerce, he puts himself into the hands of a merchant, who after some\r\nyears of apprenticeship and trial, sends him to take charge of his\r\nbusiness in the interior, or to the Antilles, or South America, or\r\nLiverpool, or Havre, or Canton. He may labour without apprehension,\r\nand produce without stint; having no rent to pay, his flour, his salt\r\nprovisions, fear no competition in the markets of South America and the\r\nsugar islands. As for cotton, the United States alone almost supply the\r\nworld, and he cannot plant enough. The career open to the Americans, as\r\nactive, bold, and intelligent merchants, is unlimited, and is entered\r\nwith admirable spirit and success; they beat their rivals, even the\r\nEnglish, on every field. If the American devotes himself to some branch\r\nof domestic industry, here he finds ample room for activity, for the\r\nhome consumption is indefinite; every body here enjoys himself, or at\r\nleast spends. Every one produces much, because all consume much; each\r\nconsumes freely, because he gains freely, has no fears for the morrow\r\nneither for himself nor his children, or at least takes no thought for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe most efficient measures of the public administration for the\r\namelioration of the condition of the people in France, would be such\r\nas would tend to increase the industrial qualities of the mass, and\r\nto furnish them with the means of putting these qualities in action;\r\nsuch are, a system of industrial education; the establishment of\r\ninstitutions of credit, which should place within the reach of all,\r\nthe instruments of industry, or, in other words, capital, which is\r\nnow inaccessible not only to the operative and the labourer, but to\r\na great proportion of the _bourgeoisie_; the execution of a complete\r\nsystem of routes of communication, from village roads to railroads,\r\nfor manufactures and commerce are impracticable where facilities\r\nof transportation do not exist; the modification of many laws and\r\ncustoms, judicial and administrative, that now embarrass industry,\r\nwithout being of the least advantage in any point of view.\r\n\r\nI dare hardly speak of popular education, where I now am. The people\r\nin the Southern States, are slaves. The maxim here is that they need\r\nno instruction; to instil into them a sentiment of fear is the only\r\nmoral nature suitable to their condition. They have, therefore, no\r\nother education than that of their own hands, and that, of course,\r\nmust be limited, because their intellectual and moral nature is in\r\nfetters. In the Northern States, the labouring classes are whites, and\r\nthere the law makes a liberal provision for popular instruction. Almost\r\nevery where in the North, all the children go to the primary schools.\r\nElementary education is there of a more practical character than with\r\nus; it is our primary instruction, with the omission of the ideal,\r\nand the addition of some instruction in commercial and economical\r\naffairs; but there is no practical industrial education here except by\r\napprenticeship. There are no mechanical or agricultural seminaries. It\r\nis not thought necessary here to shut up the young in such institutions\r\nto inspire them with a taste for commerce, agriculture, or the\r\nmechanical arts; they suck it in with their mother's milk; they breathe\r\nthe air of industry under the paternal roof, in the places of public\r\nresort, in the public meetings, every where, at all times, and in every\r\nact of life. When an American wishes to learn a trade, he goes into\r\nthe workshop, the counting-house, the manufactory, as an apprentice.\r\nBy seeing others act, he learns how to act himself; he becomes an\r\nartisan, a manufacturer, a merchant; all the faculties of his firm and\r\nwatchful mind, all the energies of his ambitious spirit are centred in\r\nhis workshop or warehouse. He directs all his powers to making himself\r\nmaster of his business, to learn the lessons of others' experience,\r\nand he succeeds of course, as every one does who obeys the voice of\r\nhis destiny. I do not pretend that the Americans are right in not\r\nhaving recourse to a theoretical preparation for a particular branch\r\nof business, for which we have instituted such costly establishments.\r\nI only record the fact, with the observation that they get on very\r\nwell without it. Our national character has little disposition for\r\nbusiness; we work from necessity and not from choice. Our ideas have\r\nlittle of a commercial or mechanical turn. To make a Frenchman a\r\nskilful husbandman, an able merchant, a dexterous mechanic, a long and\r\npainful training is necessary; he must change his natural bent, and\r\nmetamorphose all his thoughts and habits; in a word, with us a special\r\nprofessional education must precede apprenticeship. The American learns\r\nby example merely; we must learn by general principles; we stand more\r\nin need of them, and we have a greater aptitude for mastering them,\r\nthan they.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the institutions best suited to develop industry,\r\nI would observe that a political system which should be particularly\r\ncalculated to create and sustain them, cannot be taxed with\r\nmaterialism. Industry influences the moral nature of man; the material\r\nprosperity of a people has an important bearing on the public\r\nliberties. Men cannot practically enjoy the rights secured to them\r\nby law, when they are manacled and fettered by poverty; the English\r\nand their children in America call competency, _independence_. The\r\nAnglo-Americans have reached wealth through their political liberty;\r\nother nations, and we, I think, are of the number, must arrive at\r\npolitical franchises by the progress of national wealth. I now come to\r\nthe consideration of a credit system.\r\n\r\nSuppose, on one side, the land-holder who has granaries bursting\r\nwith corn, his stable filled with cattle, his storehouse crowded\r\nwith barrels of whiskey and salt meat; then, the merchant with his\r\nwarehouses full of cloth, and the grocer, well supplied with tea,\r\ncoffee, and sugar; and on the other, the labourer, the mason, the\r\ncarpenter, the smith, all skilled in their trade and wanting work to\r\nsupply them with daily food. A canal or a railroad is projected; the\r\ncountry has capital enough to construct it, since it contains the arms\r\nto execute the works, and the necessaries for subsisting the labourers.\r\nThe construction of the work is indispensable in order to enable the\r\nworkman to turn his muscles to account, and gain his daily bread, and\r\nto give the merchant a market for his goods. Now in this case, amongst\r\nus, there is no other medium of communication between the labourer and\r\nthe holder of articles of consumption, than the engineer, a man of\r\nscience but not of capital, and the citizens of the towns which are\r\ninterested in the scheme; these last have a competence and no more,\r\nand they have no means of raising, on their lands or their houses, the\r\nready money which must serve as a medium of exchange between the wares\r\nof the merchant, the produce of the cultivator, and the labour of the\r\noperative. Amongst us, therefore, the most useful projects remain on\r\npaper. In this country, by the side of the engineer and the citizen,\r\nyou have one or more banks, in which all, labourers, landholders, and\r\ntraders, put confidence, often, indeed, much more than is deserved.\r\nThe bank guaranties to the cultivator and the trader payment for their\r\nproduce and merchandise, and to the labourer, his wages; for this end,\r\nit offers the share-holder of the projected enterprise, in exchange for\r\nhis personal engagement renewable at a certain date, and often on the\r\npledge of the very canal or railroad shares, a paper-money, which the\r\nlabourer receives in payment of his wages, and with which he procures\r\nthe necessary supplies from the producer or the trader. Thus every\r\njudicious and practicable project is at once carried out into execution.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at the same result amongst us, it would be\r\nnecessary, in the first place, that we should possess somewhat more\r\nof that genius for business which is the characteristic of the\r\nAmerican, and, in the next, that the banks should be able to accept\r\nwith confidence the engagements of the share-holder of the work; the\r\nlatter requisite, could not be obtained as in the United States,\r\nbecause amongst us, except in the manufacturing towns, the _bourgeois_\r\nin general does not engage in business; he is a proprietor living on\r\nhis income and not increasing it. The American _bourgeois_, on the\r\ncontrary, is actively engaged in business, and is constantly employed\r\nin increasing his means; and besides, the banks have more hold on his\r\nreal property, than they could have in France.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would be necessary that the public, proprietors and\r\nlabourers, traders as well as landholders, should have full confidence\r\nin the bills issued by the bank, which is impossible in a country\r\nwhere all paper-money suggests the idea of _assignats_. Even if\r\nthe people had not that disastrous experiment before their eyes,\r\nit would be difficult to teach them to look upon a scrap of paper,\r\nalthough redeemable at sight with coin, as equivalent to the metals.\r\nA metallic currency, has, in our notions, a superiority to any other\r\nrepresentative of value, which to an American or an Englishman is quite\r\nincomprehensible; to our peasants, it is the object of a mysterious\r\nfeeling, a real worship; and, in this respect we are all of us more or\r\nless peasants. The Americans, on the other hand, have a firm faith in\r\npaper; and it is not a blind faith, for if we have had our _assignats_,\r\nthey have had their continental money, and they need not go far back in\r\ntheir history to find a record of the failure of the banks in a body.\r\nTheir confidence is founded in reason, their courage is a matter of\r\nreflexion Last winter, for example, it was known to the public that\r\ncertain banks in New York had on hand only five dollars in specie for\r\none hundred paper-dollars in circulation, and even less. In France this\r\nwould have been the signal of a general panic, and the bill-holders\r\nwould have thrown themselves in crowds upon the bank to exchange their\r\npaper for coin. The bank, thus stormed, would have stopped payment;\r\nfifty or seventy bills in a hundred, would have become mere rags in the\r\nhands of the holders, and what would be more fatal, the banks, which\r\nlean upon each other, and hold each other's notes to a large amount,\r\nwould have failed one after another, as those of the Federal District\r\ndid last April. Each bank failure would have been followed by numerous\r\nindividual failures, which would have involved other banks in their\r\nfall, and the country would have been ruined. The Americans in this\r\nfearful crisis, did not quail; they stood firm, like veterans under the\r\nfire of a battery or encountering a cloud of Arabs at the foot of the\r\npyramids with bayonets crossed and serried files. None of the New York\r\nbanks stopped payment, and scarcely six or seven small banks failed\r\nthrough the country.\r\n\r\nLet us not deceive ourselves; it will be a long time before we shall be\r\nin a condition, in France, to enjoy such a system of credit as exists\r\nin the United States or England; in this respect we are yet in a state\r\nof barbarism, from which we cannot pass to a more perfect condition of\r\nthings, except by a complete revolution in our commercial habits and\r\nideas, and even to a certain degree of our national manners.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to decide beforehand what the precise organisation of\r\na system of credit for France should be; but I think it may be safely\r\naffirmed, that the system which prevails here would not do for us.\r\nIn appropriating to ourselves the improvements of the English and of\r\ntheir successors in America, we must modify them in conformity with\r\nthe genius of the nation, or they will wither on our soil. As the East\r\nis the cradle of religion, so England in our day is the mould in which\r\nthe political and commercial institutions that seem destined to rule\r\nthe world have been cast; but as the religious conceptions of the East\r\nhave had to undergo a radical change in order to gain a footing in the\r\nWest, so the political and commercial creations of our neighbours,\r\nmust undergo a transformation before they can become fixed amongst\r\nus. Coming into the world under circumstances of a peculiar nature,\r\namidst a people of an original and peculiar character, born under the\r\nunhealthy shadow of conquest and civil war, they are not suited to\r\nbe transferred bodily to another soil. They are already undergoing\r\nmodifications in America, although they are here amongst the scions\r\nof the English stock. Among the people of the south of Europe and\r\namong us, when they have taken their final shape, it is probable that\r\nthey will no more resemble their British type, than a Benedictine or\r\na Sister of Charity resembles an Indian fakir or dervish. It would be\r\npresumptuous to attempt to pronounce at present what precise form the\r\ninstitutions of credit will assume; yet it is reasonable to presume,\r\nthat to be in harmony with our character and disposition, they must\r\nlean upon the government, combine their operation with its action,\r\nbecome, in a word, public establishments, and they must be ready to\r\nextend a large share of their benefits to the agricultural interest.\r\n\r\nThe public credit, which, in France, must be the bulwark of private\r\ncredit, still feels and will continue to feel the effect of our former\r\nbankruptcy. It should be our aim to make the breaches of the public\r\nfaith under the monarchy and under the republic forgotten, and to\r\nstrengthen the foundations and enlarge the sphere of the national\r\ncredit, which will thus become a suitable basis for the banks, for\r\nin France we shall not trust in the bankers, nor will the banks have\r\nconfidence in themselves, any further than they are propped up by\r\nthe government, and become in fact public establishments. Many sound\r\nheads consider it indispensable that the system of credit, should be,\r\nin many respects, amalgamated with the financial system of the State.\r\nThis is no rash speculation, or untried novelty. In the Southern and\r\nWestern States, which, like France, are chiefly agricultural, the\r\nprincipal banks are dependent on the State governments, they are\r\nemployed in collecting the taxes, and transferring funds on account of\r\nthe State treasury. This is the case, in a greater or less degree, in\r\nthe Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama, and still more so in Indiana and\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nThe greatest change, which institutions of credit will have to\r\nundergo in their introduction amongst us, will be the adaptation of\r\nthem to the wants of agriculture. We are more an agricultural than a\r\nmanufacturing people; three fourths or four fifths of our population\r\nlive by agriculture. The English are especially devoted to manufactures\r\nand commerce; their banks are most easily accessible to the merchant,\r\nnext to the manufacturer, and but little or not at all, to the\r\nagriculturist. The feudal traits, which landed property still retains\r\namong them, contribute to this result. In this country, the banks have\r\nbeen organised on the English model. They have become excessively\r\nnumerous in the Northern States,[DI] which are inhabited by a people\r\neminently possessing the manufacturing and commercial spirit. Those\r\nwhich have been established in the agricultural States of the South\r\nand West, have fallen through at different crises, of which the most\r\ndisastrous was that of 1819. In 1828, the local banks had ceased to\r\nexist in Kentucky and Missouri; each of the States of Tennessee,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Mississippi, and Alabama, had but one, or had not\r\nyet established any. At present they are created in the South and West\r\nwith something of a public character, the state either becoming the\r\nprincipal share-holder or guarantying the loan for raising a capital.\r\nSeveral of them have a decided tendency to connect themselves with the\r\nagricultural interest. Louisiana has adopted the most comprehensive and\r\nimportant measures in this respect.[DJ]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the extension of credit in France would be the means\r\nof a greater saving to the people, than any reform in the budget. The\r\naverage rate of interest on all transactions of all kinds is at least\r\n15 or 20, perhaps, 25 per cent. Suppose that this could be reduced\r\nonly two per cent., a result which does not seem very difficult to be\r\nobtained, it is plain, that as positive a saving would be made to the\r\ncountry as could be made by a diminution of the expenses of government,\r\nand that the former would be applicable to as many millions as the\r\nlatter would be to thousands. It is not possible to give an exact\r\nestimate of the amount of the annual transactions in France, it must\r\nbe enormous, for every time an article of property changes hands,\r\nthere is a transaction affected by the rate of interest; now the total\r\nannual produce of French industry is estimated at nearly 2,000 millions\r\ndollars; and we must suppose the amount of transactions to be ten or\r\ntwelve times greater. The annual amount of commercial transactions\r\nalone is about 4,000 millions. Admitting the average credit to be four\r\nmonths, and the mass of transactions to amount to 16,000 millions, a\r\nsaving of two per cent. a year would be equal to 100 millions. Add to\r\nthis that the creation of institutions of credit would make a saving\r\nonce for all of 300 or 400 millions, by the substitution of paper for a\r\nportion of the metallic currency. (See _Letter V._)\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to dwell upon the salutary influence of a\r\njudicious system of public works on the prosperity of all classes,\r\nand more especially of the lower classes. On this point every one\r\nis already convinced; it would be an enterprise worthy of a great\r\npeople to undertake such a system, which should include canals, local\r\nroads, and railroads on the great routes; which should drain our bogs\r\nand supply water to the districts that need irrigation; which should\r\nconvert Rouen and Havre, Lille and Calais, Orleans, Rheims, and Troyes\r\ninto suburbs of Paris; should consummate the union of Belgium with\r\nFrance; should make Strasburg one of the greatest _entrepôts_ in the\r\nworld; should restore life to Bordeaux, which is now pining away, by\r\ngiving it a more easy access to the central and southern departments;\r\nshould revive Nantes, which is dead, by connecting it with the\r\nflourishing interior provinces, and particularly with Paris, the heart\r\nof France; should bring Lyons into contact with the Rhine and the\r\nDanube; should develop our mineral wealth, which now lies useless in\r\nthe bowels of the earth, for want of means of transportation; should\r\nnot, as is too often the case, overlook our peaceful and laborious\r\ncountry population, but should deliver every farm and village from the\r\nsix months' blockade, to which they are now condemned by the mud of\r\nevery winter. This would be a grand and noble enterprise.\r\n\r\nThere is a common bond of union between the various branches of social\r\nimprovement; a good system of public works would exercise a powerful\r\ninfluence on the extension of credit, and, reciprocally, a liberal\r\nsystem of public and private credit, would communicate activity to\r\npublic enterprises. I go further; it is impossible that our public\r\nworks should be carried forward with vigour, without the aid of\r\ncredit. To pretend to execute them wholly by means of taxes, would be\r\nmadness. Without public and private credit, the Americans would never\r\nhave had any public works. They have entered upon the construction\r\nof their great canals and their innumerable railroads only through\r\nthe instrumentality of the banks and their loans. In 1828, the three\r\ncities of the Federal District, Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria,\r\nhaving together a population of 32,000 souls, with little trade, no\r\nmanufactures, or agricultural resources, for the country around is\r\nsterile, subscribed 1,500,000 dollars towards the construction of the\r\ngreat canal from the Chesapeake to the Ohio, raising the funds by a\r\nloan in Holland. Our large towns Bordeaux, Marseilles, Rouen, Lyons,\r\nwill have canals and railroads, whenever they shall see fit to do with\r\nmoderation what Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria have attempted\r\non too great a scale.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the means of transportation often causes such a fall\r\nin the price of articles, that the construction of a canal or road\r\nrelieves the inhabitants to an extent much exceeding the amount of\r\nthe most oppressive tax. In France, where wine is abundant, and where\r\nit is a light drink which does not brutify a man, it is important to\r\nbring it within the reach of the poorer classes, and to accustom them\r\nto the daily use of it. There are still several districts in central\r\nand southern France, in which wine is transported on the back of mules,\r\nfor a distance of 40 miles. Transportation, the same distance, by a\r\ncanal, would only be one sixth of the price of mule carriage, or would\r\nmake a saving of five cents a gallon, which is more than the excise on\r\nthe common wines; so that the construction of a canal, considered in\r\nthis light, would be a greater relief to certain consumers, than the\r\nsuppression of the excise.\r\n\r\nIn regard to legislation, we have reason to congratulate ourselves\r\non having a uniform system of laws, instead of a jumble of rules and\r\ncustoms derived from all ages and various sources. The spirit of\r\nNapoleon pervaded the creation of this noble work; but Napoleon was\r\nwholly pre-occupied with Roman ideas; he wished to found an empire of\r\nadamant on the Roman model; his counsellors were possessed with the\r\nnotion that the Roman law was pure, absolute, immutable justice. They\r\nhave, therefore, given us a code of laws, protecting various interests\r\nrather according to the degree of importance which they possessed\r\neighteen hundred years ago, than that which they have acquired in\r\nmodern times. In the time of the Romans, landed property was almost\r\nthe only property; agriculture was the only branch of industry held\r\nin respect; manufactures were merely a department of domestic labour,\r\nand were carried on by the slaves in the house; commerce was abandoned\r\nto foreigners and freedmen. At that time, no one dreamed of the\r\npossibility of those huge factories on the English plan, or of that\r\npowerful machinery which is the soul of our industry; or those immense\r\ndocks and and store-houses, which enable a man, in his closet, to\r\narrange and direct the most extensive operations, without touching an\r\narticle of merchandise, or even inspecting samples, merely by setting\r\nhis signature to a warrant or a receipt. The system of accounts was\r\nthen unknown; the idea of banks did not occur to the most far-sighted\r\nintellect. Governments took little thought for the means of making\r\nexchanges sure, easy, and speedy; the great roads opened by the prætors\r\nand emperors, were military roads. Little care was given to economy of\r\ntime; for time has a value only in an industrious community.[DK] On the\r\ncontrary, there was every reason for endeavouring to keep property in\r\nthe great families. Landed property, with reference to which all the\r\nlaws were framed, is inconsistent with the idea of constant change. The\r\nobject of legislation was stability and permanency; the forms which it\r\nestablished, were favourable to delay.\r\n\r\nFollowing this example, Napoleon and his counsellors have given us a\r\ncode of laws, in which every thing is sacrificed to landed property.\r\nThe law treats the manufacturer and the merchant with suspicion; it\r\nlooks upon them as the sons of the slave and the freedman, or at\r\nleast, as persons of no consideration, commoners whom it is permitted\r\nto treat without ceremony. On the other hand, the presumption is\r\nalways in favour of the proprietor; he is protected not because he\r\nis a cultivator and producer, but simply and abstractly because he\r\nis a proprietor, the owner of the soil, the successor of the Roman\r\npatrician and the feudal lord. Thus our laws overlook the importance\r\nof manufacturing industry, and the great destiny which awaits it; they\r\nshackle and check it by the complicated formalities to which they\r\nsubject it, and the vexatious details with which they embarrass its\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nLet me not, however, be too severe on our code; I do not know any\r\nother, which, all things considered, is more advantageous to industry.\r\nEven the American legislation has retained the defects of the English\r\nlaws; it partakes in their vagueness and uncertainty; it is under the\r\nalmost exclusive dominion of precedents which it still borrows from\r\nEnglish decisions as if North America were still an English colony.\r\nIn most of the States, the undefined and conflicting pretensions of\r\nthe common law and equity jurisdiction still remain in force. In some\r\nof the old States, as Virginia, the legislation yet bears many of the\r\nfeatures of the feudal system. American law, however, has the great\r\nadvantage of a simpler and less expensive process than ours or the\r\nEnglish, and especially of a great economy of time by a reduction of\r\nthe delays attending the English and French practice. As for the use\r\nof the jury in civil cases, it is of doubtful expediency. I often hear\r\nit said, that it would be better to leave them to three judicious and\r\nirremovable judges, than to twelve citizens, who often carry their\r\nindividual prejudices, or party passions, or class jealousies into the\r\njury-box. With a jury, the influence of a skilful advocate often weighs\r\nmuch, the merits of the cause too little. Finally, in this country,\r\nthe commercial tribunals have no compulsory jurisdiction; the ordinary\r\ncourts take cognizance of all causes, unless there is a previous\r\nagreement between the parties to submit all differences that may arise\r\nbetween them to arbiters or a committee of the chamber of commerce,\r\nwhich is merely a voluntary association, and is not to be found in all\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DF] The legal condition of all classes of females in the United States\r\nis the same as that of the women of the middle classes in England. The\r\nsame is the case with their moral condition, except that they have even\r\nmore liberty before marriage, and are more dependent after.\r\n\r\n[DG] In England a woman is never seen, as with us, bearing a hamper of\r\ndung on her back, or labouring at the forge.\r\n\r\n[DH] An Irishman, who had recently arrived, showed his master a letter\r\nwhich he had just written to his family: \"But, Patrick,\" said his\r\nmaster, \"why do you say that you have meat three times a week, when you\r\nhave it three times a day?\" \"Why is it?\" replied Pat; \"it is because\r\nthey wouldn't believe me, if I told them so.\"\r\n\r\n[DI] In 1811, out of 88 local banks, there were 55, or two thirds, in\r\nNew England and New York, although those States contained but little\r\nmore than one third of the population. In 1834, the States north of the\r\nPotomac had 414 banks, with a capital of 106 millions; the Southern\r\nand Western States had only 88 with a capital of 60 millions, about\r\none half of which were in a few commercial towns. The population of\r\nthe former was then 6,500,000, of the latter 7,500,000; the ratio of\r\nthe banks, therefore, was as 4 to 3, while that of the population\r\nwas as 6 to 7. Massachusetts and Connecticut alone, in which the\r\ncharacter of the mother-country is most strongly preserved, had 174\r\nbanks or one third of the whole number of local banks, with a capital\r\nof 40 millions, or one-fourth of the whole banking capital of the\r\ncountry, although their population was only one thirteenth of the whole\r\npopulation. The extension of the culture of cotton, and of the trade\r\nwhich it creates, has since, however, tended to turn the balance in\r\nfavour of the south, and several large banks have been established in\r\nthe southern capitals with branches in the interior.\r\n\r\n[DJ] Several bank charters in Louisiana contain a provision obliging\r\nthe bank to lend a large proportion of the capital to the planters. The\r\nCitizen's Bank is bound to advance one half its capital to landholders,\r\nbeside which they have the advantage of being share-holders without\r\nhaving paid up anything. The bank borrowed its effective capital of\r\nEuropean capitalists; its nominal capital is double that sum. It gives\r\nin return mortgages on the estates of the share-holders to that amount,\r\nwith the guarantee of the mortgage by the State. Each share-holder is\r\nentitled to credit to the amount of half his stock at the rate of six\r\nper cent. The other half of the capital is devoted to the commercial\r\noperations of the bank. The share-holders then, have their share in the\r\nprofits. It will be seen that this system depends on the legislation in\r\nregard to mortgages.\r\n\r\n[DK] The Neapolitans are said to have made the following objection to\r\na company, which proposed to run a steamboat between their city and\r\nSicily: \"Your boat takes us over in one day, and yet you demand the\r\nsame fare, as a sail vessel which is three days. That is absurd; how\r\ncan you expect that we will pay as much for being found one day as for\r\nthree?\" This is the reasoning of a people, who have no idea of setting\r\nan economical value on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AUGUSTA, (GEORGIA,) SEPTEMBER 3, 1835.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to foresee the time when the blacks in this country\r\nshall be set free; there is here a great gulf between the black and\r\nthe white. The difficulty here is not exactly of a pecuniary kind;\r\nfor, to apply to the two million and a half of American negroes the\r\nprocess which the English have applied to their colonies, only 300\r\nmillions would be required, a sum which is not beyond the means of\r\nNorth America. By rendering the process of emancipation more gradual,\r\nso as to render it more slow and safe than in the English Islands, a\r\nmuch less sum would be sufficient; but another obstacle occurs, against\r\nwhich money can do nothing. The English nature is exclusive; English\r\nsociety is divided into an endless number of little coteries, each\r\njealous of its superior, and despising its inferior. The Englishman is\r\nin his own country, what his country is in reference to the rest of the\r\nworld, an islander.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of exclusiveness which prevails in society at home, appears\r\nagain in the relations of the English with other people. The Englishman\r\ncannot fraternise with the Red Skins or the blacks; between him, and\r\nthem there is no sympathy, no mutual confidence. The Anglo-Americans\r\nhave retained and even exaggerated this trait of their fathers; and to\r\nthe men of the North as well as to those of the South, to the Yankee\r\nas well as to the Virginian, the negro is a Philistine, a son of Ham.\r\nIn the States without slaves, as well as in those in which slavery is\r\nadmitted, the elevation of the black seems impossible. An American\r\nof the North or of the South, whether he be rich or poor, ignorant or\r\nlearned, avoids a contact with the negro, as if he were infected with\r\nthe plague. Free or slave, well or meanly clad, the black or the man of\r\ncolour is always a Pariah; he is denied a lodging at the inns; at the\r\ntheatre or in the steamboats he has a distinct place allotted him far\r\nfrom the whites; he is excluded from commerce, for he cannot set his\r\nfoot on 'Change nor in the banking rooms. Everywhere and always, he is\r\neminently unclean. Thus treated as vile, he almost always becomes so.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, blacks or coloured persons have sometimes filled high\r\nstations; there is not an instance of the kind in the United States.\r\nThe republic of Hayti has its accredited representatives at the court\r\nof France; it has none in Washington. An anecdote was told me at New\r\nYork of the disappointment of a young Haytian, who was a near relation\r\nof one of Boyer's ministers, and who had received a good education in\r\nFrance; having arrived in New York, he could not get admittance into\r\nany hotel, his money was refused at the door of the theatre, he was\r\nordered out of the cabin of a steamboat, and was obliged to quit the\r\ncountry without being able to speak to any body. At Philadelphia, I\r\nheard of a man of colour who had acquired wealth, a rare thing among\r\nthat class, who used sometimes to invite whites to dine with him, and\r\nwho did not sit at table, but waited upon his guests himself. At the\r\ndessert, however, upon their pressing him to be seated with them,\r\nhe would yield to their urgency. At the end of 1833, in one of the\r\nNew England States, and I think it was in Massachusetts,[DL] a man\r\nof colour being on board a steamer with his wife, wished to get her\r\nadmitted into the ladies' cabin; the captain refused her admission.\r\nA suit was, therefore, brought against the captain, by the man, who\r\nwas desirous of having it decided by the courts, whether free people\r\nof colour, conducting themselves with propriety, could enjoy the same\r\nprivileges with whites in a State, in which they were recognised as\r\ncitizens by the laws. He gained his cause on the first hearing, but was\r\ncast on appeal.\r\n\r\nThe different nations of the great Christian family, after having for\r\nages received the doctrines taught by the successors of St. Peter, have\r\nselected out of the Christian scheme, some one principle most congenial\r\nto their nature, and made it the basis of their character. The French,\r\na most Christian people, have chosen the principle of universal\r\ncharity. In our eyes, there are no longer Gentiles; our prepossessions\r\nin favour of foreigners increase as the square of the distance that\r\nseparates their country from ours. The Spanish, a chivalric people,\r\nhave adopted with enthusiasm the adoration of the Virgin, which is of\r\na more modern origin. The Protestants have taken up the principle of\r\nindividual conscience, and this is nearly all that they have accepted\r\nfrom Christianity; they have renounced the successive additions of the\r\nchurch to the faith of the Apostles, and they have even rejected a part\r\nof what Christ himself had engrafted on the Jewish theology. Among\r\nProtestants, the Yankees have carried this retrograde tendency to the\r\ngreatest extreme; they have, except in some few points, relapsed into\r\nJudaism, and returned to to the Mosaic law. They appeal in preference\r\nto the maxims and doctrines of the Old Testament; they borrow their\r\nnames from it, and amongst the peculiarities that strike a Frenchmen\r\nin New England, one of the strongest is the great prevalence of Hebrew\r\nnames, such as Phineas, Ebenezer, Judah, Hiram, Obadiah, Ezra, &c., on\r\nthe signs and in advertisements.\r\n\r\nAs the religion of the people exercises a controlling influence over\r\nthe general tone of its feeling and character, the Yankees, having\r\nthus fallen back into Judaism, possess, like the Jews, that exclusive\r\nspirit which was already inherent in their insular origin. The fact\r\nis, that their religious notions square exactly with this depression\r\nof the blacks. The blacks seem to them inferior beings; they revolt\r\nagainst the thought of any assimilation with them, even in the\r\nslightest degree; a mixture of the two races, or, as they call it,\r\n_amalgamation_, is in their eyes an abomination, a sacrilege, which\r\nwould deserve to be punished, as the sin of the Hebrews with the\r\ndaughters of Moab was punished. The emancipation of the negro comprises\r\ntwo things; the one, formal; that is manumission by the master, which\r\nit would not be difficult to effect, if a sufficient indemnity were\r\noffered to the planters and the country could pay it; and the other,\r\nmoral, that is, a real acknowledgment of the rights of the black, by\r\nadmitting him to the personal privileges of the white man, which would\r\nmeet with insurmountable obstacles at the North as well as the South,\r\nand would, perhaps, be even more repugnant to the former than to the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty of emancipation, so far as regards the slave\r\nhimself, is also of a moral character. To render him fit for the\r\nenjoyment of liberty, it is necessary that he should be initiated\r\nin the duties and dignity of man, that he should labour in order to\r\npay his tax to society, and maintain his family with decency, that he\r\nshould learn to obey other motives than the fear of the lash. He must\r\nlearn the sentiment of self-respect; he must wish and know how to be a\r\nfather, son, husband. He only can have a perfect right to liberty, who\r\nis in a condition to enjoy it with profit to himself and to society.\r\nSlavery, odious as it is, is one form of social order, and should be\r\npreserved where no better form can be substituted for it, as it must\r\ndisappear where the inferior is ripe for a better state of things.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the lower orders in Europe, the difficulty is of the same\r\nkind with that which stands in the way of the emancipation of the\r\nAmerican slaves; it is only different in degree, and it is already half\r\novercome. In order that the hireling should be raised from his present\r\nabject state, the higher classes must be ready to treat him as a being\r\nof the same nature with themselves, and he himself must have acquired\r\nhigher sentiments than such as belong to his present condition. He\r\nmust not only be inspired with the desire of being happier, but also\r\nwith the ambition of being better. To establish new relations between\r\nthe different classes, both parties must labour with that firm will,\r\nwhich recasts ideas and habits. The question of the improvement of\r\nthe condition of the lower classes is essentially a moral question. A\r\nmoral remodelling of society is the necessary preliminary. Now, whoever\r\npronounces the world moral in the wider sense of the term, means\r\nreligion. Philanthropy and philosophy have no hold on the moral nature\r\nof man, unless they borrow it from religion. Religion only can move\r\nthe hearts of all classes deep enough, and enlighten the minds of all\r\nstrongly enough, to cause the rich and the poor to conceive new ideas\r\nof their mutual relations, and to realize them in practice.\r\n\r\nHistory teaches us, that civilisation, in its successive phases, has\r\ngradually improved the condition of the lower classes; it proves also\r\nthat each of the great changes that have taken place in the condition\r\nof the multitude, has been consummated or prepared by religion, and\r\naccompanied by a change in religion itself. It was religion that struck\r\noff the fetters of the slave, that gradually freed the serf from the\r\nglebe. The free principles of the French revolution were only the\r\nprecepts of the Christian religion practised by persons who were no\r\nlonger Christians, and the revolutionary actors themselves gave to\r\nChrist the title of _sans-culotte_, in their eyes a title of honour.\r\n\r\nTo render the efforts of the higher classes in favour of the people\r\nvigourous and sustained, they must, then, be directed by religion.\r\nTo raise the lower orders effectually from their abasement, religion\r\nmust fix them steadily on that high moral level, to which they have\r\noccasionally soared by sublime, but fitful and soon drooping flights.\r\nNow, the higher classes have not faith. If among the highest, the\r\nirreligious philosophy of the 18th century has of late lost adherents,\r\nit restores and increases its numbers from among the lower ranks.\r\nIncredulity has lowered its aim a peg; its train has lost in quality,\r\nbut gained in quantity. Irreligion is at work among the populace of\r\nthe cities, disposes them to revolt, and would make them unfit for the\r\nregular enjoyment of liberty. When we have roads, when schools have\r\ntaught the whole population to read, which will be soon, you will see\r\nirreligion infecting the country people, if you do not provide against\r\nits approaches beforehand.\r\n\r\nChristianity, or at least Catholicism, seems to be on the eve of\r\nsuffering a general desertion amongst us. And yet how far are we\r\nfrom having drawn from the Christian principles, which some among us\r\naffect to consider as exhausted, all the elements of popular liberty\r\nand happiness which they contain! We are a most Christian people in\r\nthis sense, that we believe in the unity of the whole human family,\r\nand we prove it by our good will to all nations; but it seems as if\r\nwe expend abroad all the heat that Christianity has developed in our\r\nsouls. We, the apostles of the brotherhood of nations, we have not\r\nyet breathed into our relations to each other the principle of the\r\nfraternity of men. We of the middle class, the sons of freedmen, think\r\nthat labourers, the sons of slaves, are of a different nature from\r\nourselves. We have still a remnant of the old pagan leaven at the\r\nbottom of our hearts. We do not, indeed, with Aristotle, teach the\r\ndoctrine of two distinct natures, the free nature and the slave nature,\r\nbut we act in practice as if we were brought up in that faith. We are\r\nnot yet become the fathers and elder brothers of the peasant and the\r\noperative; but in our relations to them, we are still their _masters_,\r\nand hard masters too.\r\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, whilst society, driven about by the waves, at the\r\nmercy of chance and without a compass, is exposed to disasters, which\r\nthe control of religion alone can prevent, religion makes no effort\r\nto resume the helm and recover her authority. In the midst of nations\r\nwhich are rushing onward at every risk, Catholicism stands still,\r\nsilently shrouded in her mantle, with her arms folded, and her eyes\r\nbent on heaven. The Church bore all the shocks of the revolutionary\r\nstorm with a heroic resignation; she meekly submitted to be scourged\r\nwith rods, like the Just One; like him she has been fixed to the cross,\r\nand has opened her mouth only to pray for her executioners. But the\r\nsufferings of the Just have saved sinners and changed the face of the\r\nworld; nothing betokens that the recent sufferings of the Catholic\r\nchurch will have any saving power. From the tomb where it was laid for\r\ndead, we see it bring back no scheme for the restoration of suffering,\r\nlonging humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church is yet what it was four hundred years ago; but within\r\nthat period the world has become quite another thing; it has made great\r\nprogress, and freed itself from the meshes of the past, with the firm\r\npurpose not to be again involved in them. If civilisation, then, is\r\nabout to assume a new form, as every thing forebodes, religion, which\r\nis at once the beginning and end of society, the key-stone and the\r\ncorner-stone, religion, must also re-cast herself. Would it be the\r\nfirst time that Christianity has modified her forms and rules, to adapt\r\nherself to the instincts and the tendencies of the nations she has\r\nsought to bless?\r\n\r\nIn this country, religion has wrought the elevation of the lower\r\nclasses. Puritanism has been the starting point of the democratic\r\nmovement. The Puritans came to America, not in quest of gold, nor\r\nto conquer provinces, but to found a church on the principle of\r\nprimitive equality. They were as I have before said, new Jews; they\r\nwished to govern by the laws of Moses. In the beginning the state was\r\ncompletely swallowed up by the church; they divided themselves into\r\nreligious congregations, in which all the heads of families were equal,\r\nconformably to the Mosaic law, over which the elders and the saints\r\npresided, and in which all earthly distinctions were abolished or\r\ncontemned. One of the first objects of their care, under the influence\r\nof their religious views, was to establish schools, in which all the\r\nchildren should be educated together and in the same manner. Although\r\nunequal in respect to property, all adopted the same habits of life.\r\nThe physical exertions, to which all were obliged to devote themselves\r\nin common, in order to defend themselves from famine and the savages,\r\nstrengthened their habits and feelings of equality. Now, New England,\r\nwhich is inhabited exclusively by the sons of the Puritans, and in\r\nwhich their traditions and their faith are still kept unchanged, has\r\never been, and is yet, the focus of American democracy.\r\n\r\nThus American democracy has been enabled to organise and establish\r\nitself. All our efforts, on the contrary, to found a democracy in\r\nFrance in 1793, would have been vain, even had we not been unfitted for\r\ndemocratic habits, because we wished to build on irreligion, on the\r\nhatred of religion. Manners and feelings must prepare and inspire the\r\nmeans of social improvement; the laws must express and prescribe them.\r\nPolitics and religion, then, must join hands in this difficult task.\r\nPolitics, as well as religion, must be transformed for the furtherance\r\nof civilisation, and the safety of the world.\r\n\r\nI admire the results, which the political system of the United\r\nStates has produced in America. But it seems to me impossible, that\r\nthe institutions by which the condition of the people has been so\r\nmuch bettered here, can be naturalised amongst us. There must be\r\nharmony between the political and religious schemes that are suited\r\nto any one people. Protestantism is republican; puritanism is\r\nabsolute self-government in religion, and begets it in politics. The\r\nUnited Provinces were Protestant; the United States are Protestant.\r\nCatholicism is essentially monarchical; in countries, which are\r\nCatholic, at least by recollections, habits, and education, if not\r\nby faith, a regular democracy is impracticable. The anarchy of the\r\nformer Spanish colonies fully proves to what bitter regrets Catholic\r\nnations expose themselves, when they attempt to apply to themselves the\r\npolitical institutions of Protestant countries.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Protestantism and republicanism, the\r\nsocial progress has been effected by the medium of the spirit of\r\nindividuality; for protestantism, republicanism, and individuality\r\nare all one. Individuals stand apart from one another, or if they are\r\nassociated together, they have formed only limited associations, which\r\nhave no common bond of union. The republic of the United States is\r\nindefinitely subdivided into independent republics of various classes.\r\nThe States are republics in the general confederation; the towns are\r\nrepublics within the States; a farm is a republic in a county. Banking,\r\ncanal, and railroad companies, are so many distinct republics. The\r\nfamily is an inviolable republic in the state; each individual is a\r\nrepublic by himself in the family. The only effective militia consists\r\nof volunteer companies, which have no connexion with each other. The\r\nreligious organisation of the country resembles its civil and political\r\norganisation. The different sects are independent of each other, and\r\nmost of them tend to split up into completely detached fragments.\r\n\r\nOur national genius, on the contrary, requires that in France we\r\nshould act chiefly under the influence of association and unity, which\r\nare characteristic traits of Catholicism and monarchy. France is a\r\nspecimen of the completest political and administrative unity that\r\nthere is in the world. Our individual existence must be bound up with\r\nothers; we love independence, but we do not feel that we live unless\r\nwe make a part of a whole. Solitude overpowers us; the personality of\r\nthe Englishman or the American can sustain itself alone; ours must be\r\nlinked with that of others. For a people eminently social, like the\r\nFrench, how is it possible that the spirit of association should not be\r\nthe best? But it must retain the distinction of ranks; for with us, a\r\nrepublican association would degenerate into anarchy.\r\n\r\nIf, then, I should attempt to define the conditions most favourable\r\nto the improvement of society in France, I should say that they\r\nrequire it to be undertaken under the influences of religion; that\r\nits accomplishment should be confided to the constituted authorities,\r\ncentral and local, and particularly to royalty; that it should be\r\neffected by means of institutions bearing the double impress of unity\r\nand hierarchical association, and reposing immediately on the general\r\nassociation, which is the state, or supported by powerful intermediary\r\nassociations, which should be themselves attached to the state. The\r\nnearer we approach these conditions, the more complete will be our\r\nsuccess, the sooner shall we have the happiness of seeing our beloved\r\nFrance, prosperous within, recover the high station which she ought to\r\noccupy in the world.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DL] In Massachusetts and most of New England the blacks are legally\r\ncitizens, and, as such, have the right of voting; they do not, however,\r\nat present exercise this right, either because they are prevented from\r\ndoing so, or because their names are designedly omitted on the list\r\nof tax-payers, which in some States forms the list of voters. [Blacks\r\nvote and always have voted in Massachusetts.--TRANSL.] The constitution\r\nof Connecticut, formed in 1818, excludes them from this franchise. In\r\nNew York, real estate of the value of 250 dollars, and the payment\r\nof taxes is made the electoral qualification of blacks. [The new\r\nconstitution of Pennsylvania, formed in 1838, restricts the right of\r\nsuffrage to the whites, although it was extended to blacks by the old\r\nconstitution.--TRANSL.] The Western States, in which slavery does not\r\nexist, do not admit blacks to vote, and in the slave-holding States, it\r\nmay readily be imagined that they do not enjoy that privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPIRE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    ALBANY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1835.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shown (_Letter X._), that there are in the United\r\nStates two strongly marked types, the Yankee and the Virginian, the\r\nmutual action and reaction of which have hitherto been the life of the\r\nUnion. A third is rising in the West, which seems destined to become\r\nthe bond and umpire of the two others, if it is able to preserve its\r\nown unity; which will not, however, be easy, for the West comprises\r\nslave-holding and non-slave-holding States. For the present, this\r\nhigh office is filled by the Middle States, or rather by New York,\r\nwhich is the most important State not only of this group, but of the\r\nwhole Union. To be a mediator between two types, it is necessary to\r\nunite in one person the principal qualities of both; the State of\r\nNew York, then, should combine the large views of the South with\r\nthe spirit of detail that marks the North. To be, even imperfectly,\r\nthe personification of the principle of unity in the great American\r\nconfederation, it is indispensable that the claimant of that honour\r\nshould possess in a high degree the spirit of unity. To achieve the\r\nwork of centralisation or consolidation in America, even partially,\r\ndemands a high degree of the genius of centralisation. For some time\r\nthere has appeared in the administration of the State of New York, a\r\ncharacter of grandeur, unity, and centralisation, that has procured it\r\nthe title of the _Empire-State_. Although it is the nearest neighbour\r\nof the New England States, and actually borders upon three of them,\r\nalthough a large number of its inhabitants are of New England origin,\r\nit has succeeded in freeing itself from the spirit of extreme division\r\nthat is characteristic of the Yankees, or rather in counterbalancing it\r\nby a proportional development of the spirit of unity.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition, which is in the minority in the legislature in the\r\nState, and does not, therefore, feel in good humour, endeavours to\r\ncreate among the people a dislike to this control of the central power.\r\n\"You are led,\" it says, \"by the Albany Regency; a half-dozen of the\r\nfriends of Mr Van Buren, taking their cue from Governor Marcy, make\r\nyou their puppets.\" The Opposition exaggerates; but it is certain,\r\nthat the organisation of the State, and the forms of administration,\r\nwhich have been established of late years under the influence of Mr Van\r\nBuren, and which form a precedent for the future, bear the impress of a\r\ncentralism, at which the friends of unlimited individual independence\r\nhave a right to take alarm, but which wise men must applaud; for it is\r\nby means of it that the State of New York is become superiour to the\r\nothers, and it is by it alone that it can maintain its superiority.\r\nThis combination of expansive force, which prevails every where else in\r\nthe American confederacy, with a sufficient cohesive power, has given\r\nto the constitution of New York an elasticity, which, for communities\r\nas well as for individuals, is the condition of a long and prosperous\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the public schools and of public instruction in\r\ngeneral is centralised. Most of the States have a school-fund, the\r\nincome of which in New England is distributed among the towns, who\r\ndispose of it according to their own good pleasure, without the State\r\nhaving the right to exercise any real control over it, or imposing\r\nany conditions in regard to it. New York proceeds more imperially;\r\nit obliges the different towns to raise a sum equal to that to which\r\nthey are entitled from the State, under penalty of not receiving their\r\nshare of the State fund. This method is preferable to that followed\r\nin Connecticut, which distributes annually among the towns about the\r\nsame sum as New York, but exacts no account of the manner in which it\r\nhas been employed, and cannot even be sure that it has been actually\r\ndevoted to the purpose of instruction.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, the public schools in New York were attended by 541,400\r\npupils; now the number of children between five and sixteen years of\r\nage in the districts from which returns were received, comprising\r\nvery nearly the whole State, was only 543,085. The whole expenditure\r\nfor schools was 1,310,000 dollars, of which 750,000 dollars was for\r\npay of teachers. The amount expended in France for the same object is\r\nonly three times as great as that expended by New York, which has one\r\nsixteenth of the population of France. The number of children in our\r\nschools is 2,450,000, or one thirteenth of the population, which is\r\nonly one third of the proportion in New York.\r\n\r\nAll the common schools in New York are under the supervision and\r\ncontrol of a board of commissioners, mostly composed of several of\r\nthe chief officers of the government, and of which the Secretary of\r\nState is the most active member. The commissioners make provision for\r\nthe instruction of teachers, require an account of the condition of\r\nthe school, and select the text books. Virginia, Ohio, and some other\r\nStates have adopted a similar system in this respect; but New York\r\nhas this peculiarity, that it has also a board, styled the board of\r\nRegents of the University, who are appointed by the legislature, and\r\nhave the control of the higher schools called academies. There are\r\nseven colleges in the State, one of which is styled the University of\r\nNew York, and corresponds, very remotely it is true, to the English and\r\nGerman Universities.\r\n\r\nThe control of the government over the academies is at present very\r\nlimited; it is little more than an annual visit by one or more of the\r\nRegents of the University, but it can easily be extended, whenever the\r\nState shall think proper, by means of the system of pecuniary aid; in\r\n1834, the sum distributed among these seminaries was 12,500 dollars.\r\nThe number of pupils in the Academies was a little more than 5,000, or\r\ntwo and a half pupils out of each thousand souls. In France, there were\r\n80,000 pupils in the colleges, which is the same ratio to the whole\r\npopulation. It would appear from this comparison, that in the United\r\nStates, where the advantages of elementary instruction are universally\r\nrealised, the desire for a higher degree of instruction is less general\r\nthan with us, for the number of families that can afford to pay is\r\nproportionably much greater in the United States than in France. Thus\r\nin regard to a higher education, we recover, in some measure, the\r\nsuperiority, which the Americans, at least in New York, have over us in\r\nrespect to elementary education.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit of unity and centralisation has dictated a general\r\nregulation of a singular character in respect to the banks, which may\r\nprove to be of great value in practice, and to which there is nothing\r\nsimilar, either in the other States, or in any other country. The\r\nSafety-Fund-Act establishes a bank fund appropriated to making good\r\nany losses incurred by the failure of any of the banks. Each bank is\r\nrequired to pay annually to the State treasurer, a sum equal to one\r\nhalf of one per cent. on its capital, until it shall have so paid in\r\nthe sum of three per cent. on the capital stock. Whenever the bank\r\nfund is reduced by paying the debts of an insolvent bank, it must be\r\nrestored to the proper amount by the same process. The banks, together\r\nwith the fund, are under the supervision of three Commissioners, one\r\nof whom is appointed by the Governor, and the two others by the banks.\r\nThe Commissioners visit each bank at least once in four months, examine\r\ninto its operations, and satisfy themselves that it has conformed\r\nitself to the provisions of its charter. They are beside required to\r\nmake a particular examination of any bank on the demand of three other\r\nbanks, and in case of detecting any violation of the charter, to apply\r\nto the court of chancery for an injunction against it.\r\n\r\nThis law contains several sections designed to aid the Commissioners in\r\nthe execution of their duties, and to prevent their being imposed on by\r\nthe banks; it gives them the right to inspect the books, and to examine\r\nthe officers of the bank under oath. The salary of the Commissioners is\r\n2,000 dollars, which is paid out of the bank fund. Any bank director\r\nor officer who shall make false returns to the legislature, or false\r\nentries in the books, or exhibit false papers with intent to deceive\r\nthe Commissioners, is subject to imprisonment for not less than three\r\nnor more than ten years. Every bank subject to this act may receive\r\nlegal interest on loan and discounts; but on notes which shall be\r\nmature in sixty-three days from the time of discount, it shall receive\r\nonly six per cent. per annum. It is further provided that the issues or\r\ncirculation of any bank shall not exceed twice its capital stock, and\r\nthat its loans and discounts shall never exceed twice and a half that\r\namount; but this provision has not hitherto been rigidly observed.\r\n\r\nThe number of banks in the State is eighty-seven, of which only\r\nseventy-seven are subject to the provisions of the Safety-Fund-Act,\r\nthe others having been established before the date of the act. But as\r\nall will be obliged to renew their charters within ten years, with the\r\nexception of the Manhattan bank alone, which has a perpetual charter,\r\nthey will all, with one exception, be brought under the act. The\r\naggregate of the bank capital in the State is 31,280,000 dollars; the\r\nbank fund amounts to above 538,000 dollars. The annual amount of the\r\nloans and discounts of the banks is estimated at about 300 millions,\r\nexclusive of the operations of the three branches of the United States\r\nBank; that of the banks of the city of New York alone, is about 180\r\nmillion, or twice as much as that of the Bank of France.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, has contributed so much to give New York its\r\n_imperial_ reputation, as the energy it has displayed in canalling its\r\nterritory. All the resources of the State were devoted to this object;\r\nall the energies of its citizens were bent for eight years on the\r\naccomplishment of this great work. In spite of the worst predictions\r\nand earnest remonstrances of some of the most respected men in the\r\nUnion, the confidence of this young State never faltered for a moment.\r\nComplete success attended its efforts; the great canal, begun in 1817,\r\nwas finished in 1825. The State has since executed a great number of\r\ncanals, at an expense of above twelve millions, the greater part of\r\nwhich has been raised by loan. Several others are still in progress.\r\n\r\nThe Erie canal, the most important of these works, is simple in\r\nconstruction, not very deep nor very wide. But if it is not peculiarly\r\ninteresting as an object of art, it is an object of admiration\r\nconsidered as a great commercial artery. From our canals, which are\r\nnavigated by heavy and clumsy boats slowly and painfully dragged\r\nforward by a man, you can get no idea of this great channel, with its\r\nfleet of light, elegant, covered barks gliding along at a rapid rate,\r\nand drawn by a powerful team. Every minute boats are passing each\r\nother, and the boatman's horn warns the lock-master to be in readiness.\r\nEach moment, the landscape varies; now you pass a river by an aqueduct,\r\nnow you traverse large new towns, fine as capitals, with all their\r\nhouses having pillared porticoes and looking externally like little\r\npalaces; it is an admirable spectacle of life and variety. The amount\r\nof property annually transported on the Erie Canal is 430,000 tons, on\r\nthe Champlain canal, 307,000 tons, at very moderate rates of toll. The\r\nannual amount of tolls is 1,500,000 dollars; that on the French canals\r\nand rivers is only 900,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, when it began the great canal, the State of New York contained\r\n1,250,000 inhabitants, scattered over a surface about one fourth as\r\nlarge as France. Whilst in Europe, grave publicists were discussing\r\nthe question, whether a State should undertake the execution of public\r\nworks, and the most powerful governments were listening scrupulously\r\nto the debate, in order to determine whether they had the right to\r\nenrich their subjects by productive enterprises,--the same governments\r\nwho never doubted their right to waste millions of men and treasure\r\nin devastating Europe,--the modest authorities of this miniature\r\nempire solved the question, without dreaming that it could embarrass\r\ngreat potentates in other quarters. The State of New York undertook\r\nthe execution of public works, and has found its advantage in them;\r\nafter having executed them, it has managed them itself on its own\r\naccount, and found even greater advantages in this. The income from the\r\ncanals, with the aid of some slight additions, has been sufficient to\r\nsink nearly half the debt contracted in their construction. Thus the\r\nbrilliant success of the Erie canal, became the signal for the greatest\r\nundertakings of a similar character by the other States. Pennsylvania,\r\nOhio, Maryland, Virginia, and Indiana have followed the example of New\r\nYork, and have undertaken to open routes of communication of every\r\nkind, through their territories, at their own expense, even at the risk\r\nof incurring the reproaches of the timid economists of Europe.\r\n\r\nNew York has carried her interference in public works still further;\r\nin all the charters for railroad companies, the State reserves to\r\nitself the right of acquiring the property of the railroad, after the\r\nexpiration of ten years, and on certain conditions named in the act of\r\nincorporation, which are truly liberal on the part of the State; they\r\nstipulate the re-payment of the first cost and the sums expended in\r\nrepairs, and the supply of any deficiency in the dividends below ten\r\nper cent.[DM]\r\n\r\nThus the State of New York, in its imperial humour, has laid hands\r\non public instruction, banks, and the means of communication, with\r\nthe purpose of centralising them; the design is already effected in\r\nrespect to public works; it is not yet fully accomplished in regard\r\nto the schools and the banks; but its fulfilment approaches gradually\r\nand surely. As I have already said, the spirit of centralisation has\r\npenetrated more deeply into the administration of the State, than into\r\nthe acts of the legislature; a guarantee, that the laws of unity will\r\nnot remain paper rules.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of New York have turned to the profit of its neighbours;\r\nlike it, they also begin the work of centralisation, in embracing\r\nschools, banks, and public works within the action of the State. They\r\nsee, by its example, that the spirit of individual enterprise does not\r\nsuffer, when the government subjects to its control and its authority\r\nthese three great springs of national prosperity, and even when it\r\nsets them in action on its own account; for nowhere is the spirit of\r\nenterprise more vigourous and clear-sighted than in New York. In spite\r\nof the Safety-Fund-Act, there are nowhere more numerous applications\r\nfor the incorporation of banking companies. Notwithstanding the school\r\nlaws, nowhere do institutions of education increase more rapidly.\r\nNowhere are there more railroads in progress. The State contains 80\r\nmiles of canal and 100 of railroads, constructed by companies; from\r\n150 to 200 miles of railroad are now in process of construction, and a\r\ncompany has been organised for constructing a railroad from the Hudson\r\nto Lake Erie through the southern counties, a distance of 350 miles.\r\n\r\nIt would be too much to suppose that a country like France, where\r\nso much value is set on the principles of unity and centralisation,\r\nwould be less courageous than these little republics, born under the\r\ninfluence of the individual principle, and that we should any longer\r\ndelay to take an _imperial_ course in regard to institutions of credit,\r\npublic works, and industrial education. The object to be accomplished\r\nis not merely to increase the wealth of the country. But there are\r\nother and more elevated motives to induce modern governments to take\r\npart in such institutions, and thus to extend their control over the\r\ninterests and operations of industry.\r\n\r\nThe progress of civilisation, considered with reference to the\r\nindividual, consists in this; that each becomes more and more suited to\r\nbear the weight of his individuality. Social order, being thus supplied\r\nwith stronger individual guarantees, seems to require less and less\r\nof legal and public ones; but in this matter, there is an important\r\ndistinction to be kept in view. Civilisation gradually strips man of\r\nthe grosser habits and the brutal propensities of savage life. There\r\nare many prohibitions and commands in the Deuteronomy, which in our day\r\nwould be perfectly superfluous. Mankind hardly has further need to be\r\ntaught: _Thou shalt not kill_. The lictor and the headsman are losing\r\ntheir social importance; the constable, the sheriff, and the gaoler\r\nare, it is to be hoped, on the eve of taking their places every where.\r\nPublic order has begun, and will continue more and more, to dispense\r\nwith the use of the sword; and thus individual reason substitutes its\r\nvoluntary sanction for the imperative sanction of political power and\r\nthe force of arms.\r\n\r\nThe human understanding is expanded and enlightened by cultivation;\r\nthe heart is elevated and purified; yet the elementary passions are\r\nthe same. They are combined under different forms, and are turned to\r\ndifferent objects; but if they are moderated, it is only in outward\r\nappearances; if they are polished, it is only on the surface; within\r\nall is as rough and fierce as ever.[DN] In politics, particularly,\r\njealousy and ambition exist in the same degree amongst us as they\r\ndid amongst the Greeks and Romans; they no longer wield the dagger\r\nor administer the poison, they do not even employ an assassin or a\r\nLocusta; but they are neither less unjust, nor less insatiable, nor\r\nless bitter than in ancient times; they do not stab the body, but they\r\nwound the honour; slander takes the place of the stiletto, and serves\r\nthem as well as the juices of venomous plants; civilisation furnishes\r\nthem a thousand new means of assuaging their thirst. I do not believe\r\nthat Sylla and Marius, Cæsar and Pompey, hated each other more\r\ncordially than General Jackson, President of the United States, and Mr\r\nBiddle, president of the United States' Bank. If one were to search out\r\nthe types of Cain and Abel among modern statesmen, the list would be of\r\nfrightful length.\r\n\r\nTo that force of dissolution, which increases instead of diminishing,\r\nin proportion to the increasing number of individuals admitted to\r\na share of political influence, it is necessary to oppose cohesive\r\nelements of equal activity and intensity. It is for this reason that\r\nin the future, as well as in the past, the existence of society\r\ninvolves that of religion. Even did not religion touch the tenderest\r\ncords and stir the liveliest sensibilities of the human heart; if it\r\ndid not offer to the imagination a vast field in which to wander in\r\nsafety; even if it were not indispensable to peace of conscience and to\r\ndomestic tranquillity, it would be impossible to get along without it,\r\nfor it has also a political necessity. It has been rightly said, that\r\nif there were no God, it would be necessary to feign one.\r\n\r\nA single institution, however, would not suffice to regulate and govern\r\nthe passions at all times and in all places, unless it were to follow\r\nmen in all their movements, control them in all their acts, bind them\r\nhands and feet, or, in a word, unless it were despotic, after the image\r\nof the old theocracies. It is not, then, to be hoped, that, in our free\r\ncountries, religion alone can counterbalance human passions and confine\r\nthem within the limits, in which they subserve the progress of society;\r\nor at least, if it can do this in one of the social hemispheres, the\r\nfamily, it will always be insufficient in the other, the state. For\r\nthis reason, the Middle Ages established a salutary principle, when\r\nthey separated the temporal power from the spiritual authority, and\r\ngave strength and independence to each. From that time, all efforts to\r\nconfound these two powers, or, which amounts to the same thing, to\r\ndispense with one of them, have been completely unsuccessful; they have\r\ngenerally resulted in establishing a tyranny.[DO]\r\n\r\nA temporal authority, armed with ample prerogatives, is, then,\r\nindispensable at the present day, even in behalf of liberty itself.\r\nOn the other hand it is impossible to deny that the tendency of\r\ncivilisation is to strip the throne of its ancient attributes, either\r\nin whole or in part. On this head, our age has taken a decided stand.\r\nThe resistance of kings to the efforts of those who have assailed the\r\nthrone, has served to exasperate the latter to such a pitch, that a\r\nparty,--that of the republicans,--has been formed, the sole object\r\nof which is the complete and radical abolition of monarchy, and the\r\nsingular doctrine of the inutility and even the danger of all power has\r\nfound numerous and warm adherents.\r\n\r\nThe people are right to desire the kings to lay down or to curtail\r\ntheir old prerogatives; the governments, that are the heirs of\r\nconquest, ought to abdicate whatever there is of violence and brutality\r\nin their authority. It would be premature to assert that universal\r\npeace is about to dawn on the earth; it is not so to affirm that war\r\nis henceforth to be a secondary and accidental matter in the history\r\nof nations. Industry, that is to say, the art of creating wealth,\r\nmultiplying the means of happiness, and adorning the globe, the\r\nresidence of the human family, will henceforth take precedence of the\r\nart of slaying and wasting. The sword is ceasing to be the highest\r\nemblem of power. But kings are right, in their turn, to prevent their\r\npower being reduced to an empty shadow. Independently of all individual\r\nambition, from the lofty height on which they are placed, they see that\r\nthe preservation of the order of society demands the presence of a\r\npower worthy of the name. And what proves the justness of their view is\r\nthe fact, that men of all parties who have taken part in the government\r\nduring our revolutionary crisis, have all agreed in this point whatever\r\nmay have been their former opinions; it is the only point on which they\r\nhave been unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that while we are taking from governments, we must\r\nalso be giving to them. War is no longer the principal object of the\r\nactivity of nations; the employment of brute force becomes less and\r\nless necessary to the preservation of society; let us then gradually\r\nreduce, with a firm hand, those prerogatives of power which give it an\r\nexclusively warlike character, and which leave our lives and liberties\r\nat the discretion of its armed creatures! Since industry is occupying\r\na wider and wider space in the existence of the individual and the\r\nnation, let us cause it to enter more and more completely into the\r\nsphere of government, by including in the attributes of government\r\nits three springs, banks, means of communication, and schools; on\r\ncondition, be it understood, that government shall use the new powers\r\nwith which it shall be thus invested, for the general good.\r\n\r\nThe banks, means of communication, and schools are instruments of\r\ngovernments, which it would be unwise to leave wholly out of the\r\ninfluence of the public authority, but which there could be no harm\r\nin partially incorporating with it, in such a manner as not to stifle\r\nthe spirit of individual enterprise. The public authority would then\r\nexercise its functions conformably with the tendencies of the national\r\ncharacter, and would preside over the most important events of the\r\nnational life; it would then really deserve the name of government; it\r\nwould possess a new means of coercion and restraint, which is the only\r\none compatible with the progress of the spirit of liberty. Instead of\r\nhaving a hold on the body and blood of the subject, it would have a\r\nhold on his industry and his purse. A new degree of inviolability would\r\nthus be secured to the individual, without the social order losing\r\nits needful guarantees. By this means in fine the political advent of\r\nindustry would be accomplished. Instead of being a cause of agitation\r\nand change, once sure of its rank and secure in its seat, industry\r\nwould act an important conservative part in society.\r\n\r\nEvery thing is now ripe for this political transfiguration. Forty\r\nyears ago, the people looked for their own elevation in the overthrow\r\nof the old order of things. Hatred has now ceased to be their chief\r\ncounsellor; the thirst for destruction is cooled; they think less of\r\nshaking off the yoke of tyrants, more of freeing themselves from the\r\nburdens of ignorance and poverty. The road to liberty which would now\r\nbe preferred in Europe, passes through competency, education, and\r\nindustry. Those who were once the temporal and spiritual heads of the\r\npeople would soon regain their lost rank, if calming the fears with\r\nwhich the curses uttered against the last of kings and the last of\r\npriests had filled them, they knew how to put themselves at the head\r\nof such a march; for the people could follow them with joy. By what\r\nfatality is it, that they still doubt and hesitate?\r\n\r\nI know not if I deceive myself, but it seems to me, that, in this\r\nmatter, the example must come from France. Not that she has greater\r\nsums in her treasury; not that she counts more soldiers under her\r\nflag, more ships in her ports, more cannon in her fortresses, but that\r\nshe has the most sagacious intellect, and the noblest heart; that the\r\nworld is accustomed to receive the watchword from her. London, with\r\nits thousands of ships, might be burnt to the ground, and the rest of\r\nthe world would be no otherwise affected by the event, than as by a\r\nlamentable disaster which has befallen a foreigner; the recoil of a\r\nmere riot in Paris is felt to the ends of the world. The revolution\r\nof July gave birth to Parliamentary Reform; the Reform bill would\r\nnever have brought forth July. It is because France is the heart of\r\nthe world; the affairs of France interest all; the cause which she\r\nespouses is not that of a selfish ambition, but that of civilisation.\r\nWhen France speaks, she is listened to, because she speaks not her\r\nown feelings merely, but those of the human race. When she acts, her\r\nexample is followed, because she does what all desire to do.\r\n\r\nFrance was the first on the European continent to enthrone liberty;\r\nit is for her to re-seat the principle of authority, for the fulness\r\nof its time is come. She protected the people when protection was\r\nnecessary; it is now for her to protect kings; not by the edge of the\r\nsword, although she must not break her own, which has done so much for\r\ncivilisation (for that would be sacrilege), but by the wisdom and the\r\nmoral superiority of her new principles of government, by the creative\r\npower of the new attributes with which she invests authority.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DM] Several States have reserved to themselves a similar right, but\r\ngenerally on less liberal conditions. Massachusetts, however, has\r\nadopted the same, extending the term of possession by the company to\r\ntwenty years. New Jersey has stipulated that it shall have the right of\r\nacquiring the property of several works, at a price not exceeding their\r\nfirst cost.\r\n\r\n[DN] Mde. de Stael exclaims; \"Strange destiny of mankind, condemned\r\never to retrace the same circle by the passions, whilst it is ever\r\nadvancing in the career of thought!\"\r\n\r\n[DO] I have already said, that when the Puritans landed in New England\r\nthey wished above all things to found a religious society. They\r\norganised themselves by the laws of Moses. Political society did not\r\nexist in fact, although there was a nominal governor to represent the\r\ntemporal authority, or was swallowed up in the church; the town was\r\nmerged in the congregation. Thus in a short time, their government came\r\nto resemble that of the Jesuits in Paraguay, with only this difference,\r\nthat each one here had his share in the tyranny. The Blue Laws of\r\nConnecticut are a monument of this state of things, in which the common\r\nacts of life were subjected to the most vexatious restrictions. The\r\nNew Englanders were soon obliged to renounce their Mosaic system of\r\ngovernment, and without perfectly separating politics from religion,\r\nthey gave to each of the two powers an independent existence. They\r\ndid not establish the political power firmly beyond the town; but the\r\nmunicipal constitution was solid and firm, sometimes even to excess,\r\nfor the very reason that it started from the religious organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BALTIMORE, SEPTEMBER 25, 1835.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago Mr Clay began a speech in the Senate, with these words,\r\nwhich have become celebrated on this side of the Atlantic: \"We are\r\nin the midst of a revolution.\" It was at the time, when by an act of\r\nauthority before unheard of in American history, General Jackson had\r\njust settled the bank question, which his friends in Congress and even\r\nhis own ministers had refused to decide. These words have often been\r\nrepeated by others. More recently, since the scenes of murder, outrage,\r\nand destruction which have been exhibited through the United States,\r\nboth in the slave-holding States, and in those in which slavery does\r\nnot exist, in the country as well as in the towns, at Boston, the\r\nrepublican city _par excellence_, as as well as at Baltimore, for which\r\nthe bloody excesses of which it was the theatre in 1812, have gained\r\nthe title of the _Mob Town_, good citizens have repeated with grief;\r\n\"We are in the midst of a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be granted to the honour of the English race, that it is,\r\nmore deeply than any other, imbued with a feeling of reverence for\r\nthe law. Until lately, the Americans have shown themselves in this\r\nrespect, as well as in others, to be double-distilled Englishmen.\r\nThere are nations, who conceive of law under a living form, that is,\r\nonly so far as it is personified in a man. They know how to obey a\r\nleader, but they cannot learn to respect a dead letter. With them the\r\nglory and prosperity of a State depend little on the character of the\r\nlaws, but much on that of the men who are their organs. In their view,\r\nthe empire rises and falls by turns, according as the sovereign,\r\nwhatever may be his title, is a superior man or an ordinary personage.\r\nSuch appears to be, in general, the character of the Asiatics. The\r\nEnglishman is formed in a different mould; he willingly bows to the\r\nauthority of a text; but he stoops to man with reluctance. He does not\r\nneed that obedience to law should be inculcated by the voice of man, he\r\nobeys it without an effort and by instinct. In a word the Englishman\r\nhas in himself the principle of self-government. This fact accounts for\r\nthe success of his political system in the United States, where the\r\nnative character of the English race is fairly developed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the reverence for the laws seems to be wearing out with\r\nthe Americans. This people, eminently practical in every thing else,\r\nhave allowed themselves to be pushed into the excess of theory in\r\npolitics, and have here taken up the _quand même_ logic; they have\r\nshrunk from none of the consequences of popular sovereignty, at least\r\nwhile those consequences were flattering to their pride; as if there\r\nwere a single principle in the world, not excepting Christian charity\r\nitself, which could be carried to its extreme logical consequences\r\nwithout resulting in absolute absurdity. They have, therefore, been\r\ndriven in the United States to deny that there is any principle true in\r\nand by itself, and to assert that the will of the people is, always and\r\nnecessarily, justice; the infallibility of the people in every thing\r\nand at all times, has, in fact, become the received doctrine, and thus\r\na door has been opened to the tyranny of a turbulent minority, which\r\nalways calls itself the people.[DP]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this miscalled popular justice, administered by\r\nthe hands of a few desperate or furious men, who call themselves the\r\nsuccessors of the Boston _Tea Party_ of 1773, is a great calamity\r\nin the bosom of a country, where there is no other guarantee of the\r\npublic peace than a reverence of the laws, and where the legislator,\r\ntaking for granted the prevalence of order, has made no provisions\r\nagainst disorder. This popular justice has the greater condemnation\r\nof being for the most part grossly unjust. Most of the men who have\r\nbeen atrociously hanged, or flogged, or tortured in twenty other ways\r\nin the South,[DQ] as abolitionists, that is as guilty of instigating\r\nthe slaves to rise against their masters, were, according to all\r\nappearances, merely guilty of having expressed their abhorrence of\r\nslavery with too little caution. It is even doubtful whether the\r\npretended plots, for being engaged in which whites and blacks have\r\nbeen summarily executed, had a real existence. At least no proof of\r\ntheir reality has yet been brought forward, which would be admitted\r\nby a court of justice. During the outrages last month at Baltimore,\r\nwhich were continued for four days, this self-styled justice was most\r\nstupidly unjust. The mob gave out that it wished to punish those knaves\r\nwho had shamefully abused the credulity of the poor in the affair of\r\nthe Bank of Maryland. It is a matter of public notoriety, that the\r\nbankruptcy of the bank was fraudulent; that just before it stopped\r\npayment, it had offered a high rate of interest on deposits of any\r\namount, in order to attract to its counter the savings of the labouring\r\nclasses; but it was also a matter of notoriety, that the criminal acts\r\nof the bank were wholly the work of one Evan Poultney, who alone was,\r\nin fact, the bank. Instead of going to take vengeance for the ruin of\r\nthe artisan, the widow, and the orphan, on the author of it, the mob\r\nwent to call to account the bankruptcy commissioners, appointed by the\r\ncourt. It was not till the third day that it bethought itself to make\r\na visit to Poultney, who, without being at all disconcerted, began\r\nto cry out that he was a sinner, that he had been guilty of wronging\r\nhis neighbour. He beat his breast in sign of repentance, and in a\r\npuritanical slang accused himself more loudly than the rioters had\r\ndone. Blinded, like Orgon, by so much sanctity, they excused themselves\r\nto Tartufe like him, carefully swept the hall and the marble door-steps\r\nwhich they had soiled, and hastened to sack the house of the mayor,\r\nbecause a small detachment of militia, spontaneously assembled, had\r\nfired upon them in self-defence, after having stood patient for some\r\ntime under a shower of stones.\r\n\r\nThese disorders are alarming from their general prevalence, and from\r\ntheir frequent repetitions, and they are the more so, the less their\r\nimportance is realised. They meet with few voices to condemn them, but\r\nthey find many to excuse them. One of the defects of democracy is that\r\nit is forgetful of the past, and careless of the future. A riot, which\r\nin France would put a stop to business, prevents no one here from going\r\nto the Exchange, speculating, turning over the dollars, and making\r\nmoney. On meeting in the morning, each one asks and tells the news;\r\nhere a negro has been hanged, there a white man has been flogged; at\r\nPhiladelphia, ten houses have been demolished; at Buffalo, at Utica,\r\nsome people of colour have been scourged. Then they go on to the price\r\nof cotton and coffee, the arrivals of flour, lumber, and tobacco, and\r\nbecome absorbed in calculations the rest of the day. I am surprised to\r\nsee how dead the word equality falls, when a good citizen pronounces\r\nit; the reign of law seems to be at an end; we have fallen under that\r\nof expediency. Farewell to justice, farewell to the great principles of\r\n1776 and 1789! All hail to the interest of the moment, interpreted by\r\nnobody knows who, for the success of some petty intrigue of politics or\r\nbusiness!\r\n\r\nFive men, five white men, have been hanged at Vicksburg in Mississippi,\r\nwithout even the form of a trial; they were gamblers, you are told, the\r\nscourge of the country. The _most respectable_ citizens of Vicksburg\r\nassisted in their execution. But the law which guaranties to all your\r\nfellow-citizens the trial by a jury of peers; but that old Saxon\r\njustice of which you boast! What is become of them? No tribunal would\r\nhave been able to rid us of the rogues; morality and religion condemn\r\nthem, and their decree, for want of others, we have executed; it was\r\nnecessary. _Expediency!_ In Virginia, travellers from the Northern\r\nStates, on the slightest pretences, for some tavern gossip, or some\r\nconversation in the coach, have been dragged before the self-styled\r\n_Committees of Vigilance_, beaten, tarred, and feathered. Others,\r\nwhose crime consisted in inadvertently having in their pocket, some\r\npapers which the slave-holder has been pleased to pronounce abolition\r\nwritings, have been seized by these fanatics, and hanged as emissaries\r\nof insurrection. What is become of that article of the constitution,\r\nwhich secures to the citizens of each State the protection of the\r\nlaws in every other State? If we were to insist on these points, we\r\nshould endanger our union with the South. _Expediency!_ Merchants of\r\nNew York! The planters of one of the parishes of Louisiana have set a\r\nprice on the head of one of your number, because, as they say, he is\r\nan abolitionist, an amalgamator. Will not your national sensibility,\r\nso lively in regard to France, be touched by this act of audacity? Our\r\ncommerce with the South constitutes half the prosperity of New York.\r\n_Expediency!_ Men of New England! Citizens of the cradle of American\r\nliberty! Sons of the pilgrims, self-exiled first to Holland, and then\r\nto the sandy shores of Massachusetts, rather than bow their opinions to\r\nthe will of the Stuarts! You, so proud of your liberties, how can you\r\nabandon the dearest of all, the liberty of the press, to the hands of a\r\npostmaster? Always the same reply: _Expediency!_\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if political principles no longer existed in the\r\nUnited States but at the pleasure of the passions, and the laws had no\r\nforce when they jarred with interest. When a State feels itself injured\r\nby a tariff, it declares the law null and void, arms its militia, buys\r\npowder and throws down the glove to Congress. When another State,\r\nas Ohio, is dissatisfied with the boundary line assigned to it, it\r\ndeclares war against Michigan, its neighbour, in order to extend its\r\nfrontiers by force. When the fanatics of Massachusetts, in their savage\r\nintolerance, feel offended by the presence of a Catholic convent, in\r\nwhich the sisters devote themselves to the work of educating young\r\ngirls without distinction of sect, they plunder it and set it on\r\nfire, and the sacred edifice is burnt, in sight of a city with 70,000\r\ninhabitants, without a drop of water being thrown upon the flames,\r\nand without its being possible to find a jury that would convict the\r\nauthors of the cowardly outrage. When a Governor of Georgia[DR] comes\r\ninto collision with an upright magistrate, who interposes his authority\r\nbetween the rapacity of the whites and the poor Indian whom they are\r\nimpatient to rob, he denounces the just judge to the legislature, and\r\nurges the passing of a law that will make him a State criminal. And, I\r\nrepeat it, the worst and most fatal symptom of the times is, that the\r\nperpetration of these outrages, however frequent they become, excites\r\nno sensation. The destruction of the churches and school-houses of\r\nthe blacks in New York was looked upon as a show, and the merchants\r\nof the city as they passed, paused to take a moment's relaxation from\r\nthe sight; the fall of the buildings was greeted with loud cheers. In\r\nBaltimore, a numerous crowd applauded the work of demolition without\r\ninquiring whose house was pulled down, and the women, in the excitement\r\nof the moment, waved their handkerchiefs in the air.\r\n\r\nAnother symptom still more alarming! Civil courage, the virtue of the\r\nHampdens, the glory of the English race, which shone with so pure a\r\nlustre in the United States whilst the authors of their independence\r\nsurvived, seems to be for a time extinct; I say for a time, for there\r\nis a stock of energy in the American character, which cannot fail some\r\ntime or another to revive and put forth its strength anew. The press,\r\nwhich with a few honourable exceptions, does not possess and does not\r\nmerit, in the United States, the consideration which it enjoys in\r\nFrance; the press, which is here so outrageously violent and brutal\r\nin its treatment of members of Congress belonging to the opposite\r\nparty, is, on the other hand, more cautious and reserved in regard to\r\nthe multitude. The American press is free in so far as it gives no\r\nbonds and pays no stamp duty, but it is dependent on a capricious,\r\ndespotic, and not very enlightened public opinion, which requires it to\r\nflatter the passion of the hour, and does not look to it for lessons\r\nof morality. The public opinion of the democracy is a master who is\r\neasily offended, and who quickly shows his displeasure. The American\r\njournalist is well aware that for the slightest display of boldness\r\nhe will be deserted; and since the late events, this is not his only\r\nfear, for he knows that if his enemies should choose to brand him\r\nas an abolitionist, for example, it would be easy to raise a mob of\r\nvagabonds, who would pillage and pull down his house, tar and feather\r\nhis person, and drive him from home without any interference by the\r\npublic authorities.[DS] He is therefore exceedingly circumspect. In\r\na word, the _reign of terrour_ is begun in the United States. Men of\r\ncourage and devotion to the cause of law have no rallying point in\r\nthe press; and even when the public authority would be disposed to\r\nsupport them, it proves insufficient, either through fear, or concern\r\nfor party interests, or want of physical force. To the small number of\r\ngood citizens in whom the state of the country excites the liveliest\r\nalarm, there appears to be no resource left, but that of organising\r\nthemselves in patriotic societies, forming themselves into military\r\ncompanies, of creating, in fine, a national guard, under the form which\r\nthe laws and national customs would sanction. They feel that this step\r\nis necessary, but they hesitate, because they fear to kindle a civil\r\nwar. The Baltimoreans, however, seem determined to make the trial.[DT]\r\nIt has also been proposed to make the towns responsible by law for\r\nthe damages committed within their limits. Such a law, if it did not\r\nhave the effect wholly to prevent the disorders, for the taxes here are\r\nmostly paid by the rich, would at least have the merit of repairing the\r\nlosses suffered by means of them.\r\n\r\nThe present generation in the United States, brought up in devotion\r\nto business, living in an atmosphere of interest, if it is superiour\r\nto the last generation in commercial intelligence and industrial\r\nenterprise, is inferior to it in civil courage and love of the public\r\ngood. Deplorable fact! When Baltimore was not long since given up to\r\nthe genius of destruction four whole days, when the protection of\r\nthe city had been vainly transferred from the mayor to the sheriff,\r\nand from the sheriff to the commanding officer of the militia, when\r\nthe prisons had been forced, and the spirit of order began at last\r\nto revive, not a man was found in this city of 100,000 souls to\r\nput himself at the head of the movement. When the most respectable\r\ncitizens, and those most deeply interested in the restoration of the\r\npublic tranquillity held a meeting in the Exchange, the mountain in\r\nlabour brought forth only a long series of whereases on the advantage\r\nof public order, and a string of wordy resolutions which resolved\r\nnothing. Nothing, shameful to relate, but the presence of a veteran\r\nrelic of the Revolution with the weight of eighty-four years on his\r\nhead, who had retired from Congress to end his long career in repose,\r\nbut who felt his blood boil in his veins and mantle in his cheeks at\r\nthe spectacle before him,--nothing but his presence gave courage to\r\nthis assembly of men in the vigour of life, who were letting their\r\ncity fall a prey to a handful of drunkards and depraved boys. The\r\nindignant old man, started up and interrupted the reading of the\r\nresolutions; \"Damn your resolutions!\" cried he; \"give me a sword\r\nand thirty men, and I will restore order!\" \"What! General Smith,\"\r\nsaid one of these irresolute makers of resolutions, \"would you fire\r\nupon your fellow citizens?\" \"Those who break the laws, drive their\r\nneighbour from his house, plunder his property and reduce his wife and\r\nchildren to beggary,\" answered Gen. Smith, \"such fellows are not my\r\nfellow-citizens.\" These words, which expressed the thoughts of all, but\r\nwhich no one dared utter, were received with a thunder of applause. The\r\naged senator was named commander of the military force by acclamation,\r\nand a few days after was chosen mayor. Since that time Baltimore has\r\nbeen quiet. But when we reflect that order has been restored in a\r\nlarge and flourishing city, only because there happened to be present\r\na veteran whom death had spared, and who had energy enough, with one\r\nfoot in the grave, to come forward and teach his fellow citizens, by\r\nexample, the lessons of the golden age of American liberty, are we not\r\nforced to exclaim with Mr Clay; \"We are in the midst of a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nMr Clay is no false prophet; for the events that have succeeded each\r\nother since he uttered these words, announce that a crisis is at hand.\r\nThe American system no longer works well. In the North, the removal\r\nof all restrictions on the right of suffrage, without the creation\r\nof any counterpoise, has destroyed the equilibrium. In the South,\r\nthe old foundation borrowed from the ante-Christian ages, on which\r\nit has been attempted to raise the superstructure of a new social\r\norder in the nineteenth century, shakes and threatens to bury the\r\nthoughtless builders under the ruins of their half-finished work.\r\nIn the West, a population sprung from the soil under the influence\r\nof circumstances unparallelled in the history of the world, already\r\naffects a superiority, or rather lays claim to dominion, over the\r\nNorth and South. Everywhere, the relations established by the old\r\nfederal compact, become unsuited to the new state of things. The\r\ndissolution of the Union, the mere thought of which would have caused a\r\nshudder of horrour, ten years ago, which was numbered among those acts\r\nof infamy that are not to be named,--the dissolution of the Union has\r\nbeen demanded, and no thunder fell upon the head of the perpetrator of\r\nthe sacrilege. At present it is a common topic of conversation. The\r\ndissolution of the Union, if it should take place, would be the most\r\ncomplete of all revolutions.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the character of this revolution, which is felt to be\r\napproaching? To what institutions will it give birth? Who must perish\r\nin the day of account? Who will rise on the storm? Who will resist the\r\naction of ages? I have not the gift of prophecy, and I shall not try\r\nto pierce the mystery of the destinies of the New World. But I have a\r\nfirm faith, that a people with the energy and intelligence which the\r\nAmericans possess; a people which has like it the genius of industry,\r\nwhich combines perseverance with the resources of ingenuity, which\r\nis essentially regular in its habits and orderly in its disposition,\r\nwhich is deeply imbued with religious habits; even when a lively faith\r\nis wanting, such a people cannot be born of yesterday to vanish on\r\nthe morrow. The American people, in spite of its original defects, in\r\nspite of the numerous voids which a hasty growth and a superficial\r\neducation have left in its ideas, feelings, and customs, is still a\r\ngreat and powerful people. For such nations, the most violent storms\r\nare wholesome trials which strengthen, solemn warnings which teach,\r\nelevate, and purify them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DP] It has been observed, that the disorders are always committed by\r\na handful of men followed by a train of a mischievous boys. It is rare\r\nthat more than one hundred persons take part in the acts of violence,\r\nand often not half that number is engaged in them.\r\n\r\n[DQ] A Virginia newspaper relates that an abolitionist, having fallen\r\ninto the hands of a Committee of Vigilance, was stript naked, and\r\nstretched at his length on his face, when a cat was several times\r\ndragged across his bare back by the ruffians. A New York Journal\r\nrepeats the statement with no other comment than some witticism.\r\n\r\n[DR] Gov. Lumpkin.\r\n\r\n[DS] An editor of a newspaper was lately driven from Boston by a mob,\r\non account of his abolition principles, and not long since another was\r\nsubjected to the same ostracism in New Orleans for having offended a\r\nmilitia company by his remarks.\r\n\r\n[DT] The question of an armed police has for some time attracted\r\nthe attention of enlightened individuals in the United States; the\r\nconstable's staff and the _posse comitatus_ of the sheriff are no\r\nlonger sufficient to maintain order and keep the peace. Independently\r\nof political difficulties, however, economical considerations stand in\r\nthe way of the project. Virginia, for example, has nearly two-fifths of\r\nthe superficial area of France. An armed police of one thousand men,\r\nwhich would be inconsiderable for that extent of country, would cost\r\nher about 800,000 dollars a year, a sum, say the calculators, which\r\nwould more than pay the interest of a loan that would enable us to\r\nconstruct a canal or a railroad from Richmond to the Ohio. So the canal\r\nis made, and the armed police put off for another day. Meanwhile if\r\nsome travellers from the North are hanged or flogged as abolitionists\r\nby the slaveholders, in a moment of excitement, the affair is regretted\r\nat first, but it is thought to be more important to have a canal or\r\nrailroad which shall make Richmond the rival of New York, than to save\r\ntwo or three _fanatics_ from the lash or the halter. This system is\r\ndeplorable. But I know not that we have a right to denounce it, for we\r\nmust confess, that something analogous prevails amongst us. We demand\r\nmoney without hesitation for war, for organising and keeping up a large\r\nmilitary force, for filling our arsenals with cannon; but how difficult\r\nis it to procure any for useful enterprises, roads, canals, railroads,\r\nschools, penitentiaries, to which the United States devote almost all\r\ntheir resources?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE CLASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       BALTIMORE, OCT. 8, 1835.\r\n\r\nAmerican society is composed of quite different elements, from those of\r\nwhich European society in general, and French society in particular,\r\nconsists. On analysing the latter, we find, in the first place, the\r\nshadow of an aristocracy, comprising the wrecks of the great families\r\nof the old order that have been saved from the revolutionary storm,\r\nand the descendants of the Imperial nobility, who seem to be already\r\nseparated from their fathers by the distance of ages.\r\n\r\nNext below this is a numerous body of the Middle Classes\r\n(_bourgeoisie_), consisting of two distinct sets; the one, the active\r\nclass, is engaged in commerce, manufactures, agriculture, and the\r\nliberal professions; the other, generally designated amongst us as\r\nthe _bourgeoisie oisive_, consists of men without active employment,\r\nlandholders who derive an income of 500 or 1500 dollars from their\r\nestates, by rents or sharing the produce with the cultivator, without\r\nattempting to increase it, and the small body of holders of public\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThese two divisions of the Middle Class differ essentially from each\r\nother, the one labouring, the other only consuming and enjoying what\r\nthey have. The one increases its means, and consequently is able\r\nto keep itself above the waves, and maintain, if not to raise, its\r\nlevel; the other, as M. Lafitte has said, successively transported\r\nby time into one stage of society after another, in each of which\r\nlarge additions are made to the general wealth, finds itself growing\r\nrelatively poorer, and must decrease in numbers. They differ no less\r\nin their origin; the one belongs essentially to the commons; the other\r\nhas some pretensions to nobility, it is the offspring, or at least the\r\nheir and successor of the country-gentry. During the period of the\r\nRestoration, they differed also in their political views; the members\r\nof the one class for the most part took the left side, those of the\r\nother preferred the right side. At present, the former accepts the new\r\ndynasty without reluctance; the latter, more difficult to be satisfied\r\nin regard to the preservation of order, and ready to take alarm at\r\nevery violation of old established privileges, still preserves a secret\r\npreference for the legitimate line. In respect to religious sentiments,\r\nthe latter is sceptical, and prone to believe that the Voltairean\r\nphilosophy and the theories broached by the Opposition during the\r\nfifteen years, are the _nec plus ultra_ of the human understanding;\r\nthe former, shaken in its faith, still keeps alive the sacred fire of\r\nreligious feeling, rejects the disorganising doctrines of the 18th\r\ncentury, and holds in scorn the lucubrations of the liberal publicists\r\nof the Restoration. The one piques itself on its adherence to the\r\npositive, the material; the other concerns itself about the great\r\nconservative principles of society, but refuses to recognise the new\r\ninterests, which must be allowed to share in the privileges of those of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThese two sections of the Middle Class are not wholly and sharply\r\nseparated from each other; but they run into and across each other. A\r\nlarge proportion partakes somewhat of both characters, and joins one\r\nside or the other, according to times and circumstances. Yet, although\r\noften confounded in the same individual, the two interests are,\r\nnevertheless, substantially distinct from each other. The base of the\r\npyramid is occupied by the peasants and operatives, divided into two\r\nsections; the one of which has become possessed of property, the other\r\nhas not yet reached that point but aspires after it with eagerness. On\r\none side, we have the mechanics and small proprietors; on the other,\r\nthe labourers. It is universally acknowledged that the Middle Class, at\r\npresent, rules in France. The aristocracy is driven from power or keeps\r\nitself aloof. The mechanics and small proprietors hardly yet begin to\r\nraise their heads. The labourers are nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the Northern States of the American Union, society is much less\r\ncomplex in its composition, than in France. Exclusive of the coloured\r\ncaste, there are here only two classes; the middle class and the\r\ndemocracy. Of the two conflicting interests, one only has a public\r\nexistence here; it is labour. The Middle Class consists of the\r\nmanufacturers, merchants, lawyers, physicians. A small number of\r\ncultivators, and persons devoted to letters or the fine arts, is to be\r\nadded to these.\r\n\r\nThe democracy is composed of the farmers and mechanics. In general,\r\nthe cultivator is the owner of the soil; in the West, this rule is\r\nwithout exceptions. Great landholders do not exist, at least as a\r\nclass, in the North and the Northwest. There is strictly speaking no\r\nclass of mere labourers; for although there are day-labourers, and\r\nboth in the cities and country many workmen without capital, yet these\r\nare in fact apprentices, for the most part foreigners, who become\r\nin turn proprietors and master-workmen, and not unfrequently rich\r\nmanufacturers, wealthy speculators.\r\n\r\nBetween these two classes there is, however, no line of demarcation,\r\nfor the attempts of some coteries to establish certain fashionable\r\ndistinctions do not deserve notice, or at least are only of a negative\r\nvalue, as timid and often absurd protestations against the abuse of\r\nequality. The two classes have the same domestic habits, and lead the\r\nsame life, and differ considerably only in respect of the sect to which\r\nthey are attached, and the pews they occupy. The relations which\r\nexist at present between the wealthy _bourgeoisie_ and the wrecks of\r\nthe aristocracy in France, give an accurate notion of the relative\r\ncondition of the two classes of American Society.\r\n\r\nPolitical influence is, at present, entirely in the hands of the\r\nAmerican democracy, as with us it is monopolised by the Middle Classes.\r\nThe latter have no chance of getting possession of power in the United\r\nStates, except temporarily, or by means of accidental divisions in\r\nthe democratic ranks, when they may rally to their standard a portion\r\nof the farmers and mechanics, as happened in 1834, after General\r\nJackson's attack on the Bank. So in France, it will be impossible for\r\nthe aristocracy to raise, not its own banner (for it has none), but\r\nthat of the legitimate line, unless the folly of the government should\r\nexcite new troubles, and inspire the Middle Class, who now support it\r\nheartily, with fears for the public security.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States, the existence of slavery produces quite a\r\ndifferent state of society, from that of the North; half of the\r\npopulation there consists of mere labourers in the strictest sense,\r\nthat is of slaves. Slavery necessarily requires great estates, which\r\nin fact, form aristocracy. Great estates still continue to be held in\r\nthe South, notwithstanding the custom of equal partition has very much\r\nnarrowed them.\r\n\r\nBetween these two extremes in the South, an intermediate class has\r\nsprung up, consisting, like our Middle Class, of the workingmen and\r\nthe men of leisure, the new interest and the old interest. Commerce,\r\nmanufactures, and the liberal professions, on one side; on the other,\r\nthe landholders, corresponding to our moderate country landholders,\r\nliving on their estates by the sweat of their slaves, having no taste\r\nfor work, not prepared for it by education, and even taking little\r\noversight of the daily business of the plantation; men who would be\r\nincapable of applying themselves to any occupation if slavery were\r\nabolished, just as our proprietors would be unable to get a living, if\r\nthey were to be deprived of their estates.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the equal partition of estates must have tended to\r\nincrease the number of this class of men of leisure; it is numerous\r\nin the old Southern States, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, and\r\nalso in Louisiana; the check which these States at first experienced\r\nin their career, whilst the North was advancing without let, and the\r\ncontemporaneous increase of this class, are two correlative facts,\r\nwhich account for each other. But we do not find this class in the\r\nnew States of the South. The new generation there, as in the North,\r\ndevoured with the passion of making money, has become as industrious\r\nas the Yankees. The cultivation of cotton offers it a wide field of\r\nactivity; in Alabama and Mississippi, the cotton lands are sold at a\r\nvery low price. The internal slave-trade furnishes hands in abundance,\r\nwhich are easily procured on credit when one has friends, but no\r\npatrimony. The sons of the old Southern States, instead of vegetating\r\non a fragment of the paternal estate, with a handful of negroes, sell\r\noff their property at home, extend their means by aid of a loan, which\r\nthey are sure of being able to repay promptly, and go to the Southwest,\r\nto establish a a cotton-plantation, a sort of agricultural manufactory,\r\nin which they are obliged to exercise more or less of the activity, and\r\nto feel more or less of the hopes and fears of a manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThus the class which works little or not at all, is disappearing in the\r\nUnited States. In the Western States, which are the true New World, it\r\nno longer exists at all, in the North or in the South; you meet with no\r\none there who is not engaged in agriculture, commerce, manufactures,\r\nthe liberal professions, or the clerical office. The United States,\r\nthen, differ from us in having no aristocracy, no idle Middle Class, no\r\nclass of mere labourers, at the least in the North. But a distinction\r\nshould be made in regard to the absence of these three classes; for\r\nwhile it may be admitted that the two last are absolutely becoming\r\nextinct, it would be more correct to say that the first has not yet\r\nbegun to exist.\r\n\r\nCivilisation, in its passage from one continent to the other, has,\r\nthen, got rid of two classes. This twofold disappearance is, however,\r\nonly a single phenomenon, or, at most, two phases of a single fact, the\r\nindustrial progress of mankind. It seems to me to be inevitable, that,\r\nin this matter, the Old World should follow the example of the New; it\r\nmoves towards the same end under the influence of peculiar causes, and\r\nit is irresistibly driven onward by what is commonly called the force\r\nof events, that is, by the decree of providence.\r\n\r\nThere is a rule superior to all social conventions, codes of\r\nlegislation, or systems of jurisprudence; it is, that when a class has\r\nceased to take part in the workings of society, its doom is pronounced;\r\nit cannot preserve its privileges, unless the march of civilisation\r\ncomes to a stand, and it is kept stationary, as it was in Rome from\r\nAugustus to Constantine; but when the column again sets forward, those\r\nwho will not serve as soldiers, and are unfit to be officers, those who\r\ncan do duty neither in the ranks nor in command, who can act neither\r\nin the tent nor the field, all these are abandoned as stragglers,\r\nand their names are struck from the roll. The law is inflexible and\r\nunsparing; no human power can rescue those whom it condemns from their\r\ndoom; they only can save themselves, by taking part in the general\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThis explains the annihilation of the aristocracy of the nobility in\r\nFrance. Between it and royalty, as between royalty and the English\r\naristocracy, there was a long struggle, but the results were as\r\ndifferent as the characters of the nations. In France, monarchical\r\nunity triumphed; Louis XI. struck down the aristocracy; Richelieu\r\nmuzzled it; Louis XIV. obliged it to wear the collar. Thus reduced in\r\na political point of view, it was left in possession of the field of\r\ntaste and art, which it devoted to the promotion of irreligion and\r\ncorruption of manners. When, therefore, it was weighed in 1789, it was\r\nfound wanting; the decree of destiny had gone forth, and the revolution\r\nexecuted it with a cannibal ferocity. The unhappy aristocracy\r\nremembered its lofty nature only at the point of death; it mounted the\r\nscaffold with dignity.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, the idle portion of the Middle Class tends towards\r\nits fall, for it accomplishes no purpose, which cannot be effected\r\nwithout it. It does not enrich society by its labour, although it lays\r\nclaim to be reckoned in the number of producers, under the pretext that\r\nit holds the soil and exercises a sort of superintendence over its\r\ncultivation. The truth is, that it is wholly ignorant of agriculture;\r\nit has received by tradition a certain routine, but the peasantry is as\r\nfully possessed of the tradition, and needs no teachers on that matter.\r\nThe proprietor is sometimes, indeed, paid in kind by the peasant, and\r\nthen sells the grain himself; but the peasant could easily attend to\r\nthat business, and would manage it quite as well as his landlord.\r\nNeither does this class serve as the representative of knowledge;\r\nfor in this respect, its acquisitions are limited to a little polite\r\nliterature, an agreeable accomplishment surely, but not answering to\r\nthe wants and spirit of the age.\r\n\r\nWhere a nobility exists and maintains its prerogatives, as in England,\r\nit performs a twofold office. In the first place, it devotes itself\r\nto the most difficult of all arts, that of governing men, and in this\r\nit excels; whether because it cultivates it by the traditions of\r\nexperience, or because it vigilantly recruits its ranks by enlisting\r\nin them such men as have already proved their superiour knowledge of\r\nthe different interests of society. This reason cannot be urged by\r\nour idle Middle Class as an argument for its preservation; for it is\r\nnotoriously ignorant of the science of government.\r\n\r\nThe second office of a nobility, not less essential than the first in\r\nour polished age, is to serve as a pattern and example in the art of\r\nliving, to teach the art of consuming, without which that of producing\r\nprocures only partial and illusive gratification, and to encourage the\r\nfine arts. On this head nothing can be said in favour of the class\r\nalluded to. It excels neither in grace, nor elegance, nor address. The\r\nimportance which it has acquired by the destruction of the aristocracy,\r\nhas been fatal to the old French politeness, to that exquisite courtesy\r\non which our fathers prided themselves. Within the last fifty years,\r\nwhilst the English have been improving in this respect, much more\r\nsuccessfully than their stiff and unpliant humour seemed to promise, we\r\nhave forgotten much and unlearned much, under the controlling influence\r\nof our Middle Class.\r\n\r\nAs for the art of consuming with grace and living well, and that care\r\nof the person, the only fraction of which that they can be sensible\r\nto, the English call comfort, our Middle Class has lessons to learn,\r\nbut none to give. It is not, however, the fault of nature; for no\r\npeople has received finer and acuter senses than ours. Surely, our\r\nnerves are more sensitive, our ear and our palate more delicate than\r\nthose of the English. Our superiority on these points, is attested\r\nby the fact, that, from one end of the world to the other, we are in\r\npossession of most of the trades which relate to the person; the office\r\nof cook, head-dresser, dancing-master, valet, or tailor, is everywhere\r\nmonopolised by the French. But to surround oneself with the English\r\ncomfort, and that more refined comfort which we can conceive of, one\r\nmust be rich. Now our Middle Class is poor, and politically considered\r\nthis is one of its greatest faults; it grows poorer daily, either by\r\nthe operation of the law which commands the equal partition of estates,\r\nor of that idleness which condemns it to a stationary income, whilst\r\npublic wealth and luxury are increasing all around it. It cannot,\r\ntherefore, encourage the fine arts, for the patronage of the arts is\r\ncostly; besides taste is growing rare in France since the fall of the\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nNor can it be affirmed that the unemployed Middle Class in France\r\nrepresents the element of order, and that if it were to disappear,\r\nFrance itself would perish in frightful convulsions. For the labouring\r\nclass is already ripe for a better state of society, and requires only\r\nthe advantages of instruction, and of more favourable terms and more\r\nnumerous opportunities for industry, to be in a condition to exercise\r\nall the rights of a citizen as usefully as the greater portion of the\r\nMiddle Class. And even if the latter represents in whole or in part\r\nthe element of order, it is only by the aid and the instrumentality\r\nof four hundred thousand bayonets, exclusive of those of the Middle\r\nClass itself, and thus it retains its predominance only by opposing the\r\nmultitude to the multitude; a critical and dangerous position, which\r\ncannot long be held, for the very bayonets are beginning to become\r\nintelligent.\r\n\r\nThe _bourgeoisie oisive_ has, then, only one course to take; that\r\nis, to pass into the ranks of the working men, to fit themselves to\r\nbecome the leaders of the people in its labours. When this is done,\r\nour fields, which belong especially to their domain, will change their\r\naspect as if by enchantment, and our peasants, who, it cannot be too\r\noften repeated, at present form the poorest and most numerous class in\r\nFrance, will be raised to a better condition, of which they are worthy.\r\nThe idle Middle Class must now become with the government, to which the\r\nfirst step in all great projects of improvement belong, responsible\r\nfor the progress of twentyfive millions of agricultural labourers.\r\n\r\nIn this change it has every thing to gain itself. By this means it will\r\nmaintain and confirm its own social rank, for it will thus recover the\r\nconfidence of the multitude, and will turn its superiority to a good\r\naccount by exercising a beneficent patronage towards its inferiors. It\r\nwill exchange a straitened condition for competency or even wealth,\r\nand the tedium of a life of inaction for the satisfaction of having\r\ndone well, the consciousness of having faithfully performed a great\r\nduty. This honourable desertion of the standard of idleness for that\r\nof industry is now going forward daily. Let us rejoice at it: let\r\nus pray that it may speedily become universal. Let us especially\r\nurge government to accelerate it, by encouraging the development of\r\nindustry, by all the means and aids that can improve the condition\r\nand resources of agriculture, and inspire the young generation with a\r\ndesire to devote themselves to this first of arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nARISTOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   PHILADELPHIA, OCT. 13, 1835.\r\n\r\nNo great society can be durable, except in so far as authority is\r\nestablished in it. We may easily imagine a case, however, in which the\r\nauthority may be temporarily thrown into the shade; when a great nation\r\nis in search of political and social forms suited to its wants, when\r\nit is obliged to pass from trial to trial, to feel its way, and turn\r\nitself successively to different points; when, beside, its separation\r\nfrom the rest of the world guaranties its independence, and frees it\r\nfrom the necessity of organising itself under the apprehension of\r\nassaults from abroad, it is then permitted, it is even necessary, that\r\nit should provide for the greatest possible freedom of motion, and that\r\nit should cast off all unnecessary and unprofitable restraints. But\r\nthen a society without a fixed order and political ties, is an anomaly,\r\na passing phenomenon. The social bonds of opinion and religion, the\r\nonly ones which exist here, cannot supply the want of political ties,\r\nunless they are straightened to such a degree as to become despotic.\r\nBesides, when large towns like New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore,\r\nhave once grown up, and there is a numerous floating population, which\r\nopinion and religion cannot watch closely, manners and belief have need\r\nof the firm support of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe serious character and frequent occurrence of disorders in the\r\nAmerican Union, at the present time, prove that the period has come,\r\nwhen it will be necessary for authority to be organised. There are\r\ninterests in the South, for example, which are filled with alarm, and\r\nwhich for want of legal protection, protect themselves, right or wrong,\r\nin a brutal manner, and feel the necessity of a power upon which they\r\ncan rely for safety. In the Middle Class of the cities of the North,\r\nthere is a population enervated or rather refined by wealth, which\r\nis no longer ready to exercise that portion of self-government that\r\nconsists in the suppression of violence by force, and in the democracy,\r\nthere is a restless and turbulent element which force alone can hold in\r\ncheck. These two classes, which are peculiar to the North, and whose\r\nnumbers daily increase, will soon be unable to live with each other,\r\nwithout the intervention of power.\r\n\r\nAuthority has two bases, upon which, to stand firm, it must be\r\nsupported, like man upon two feet; these are unity or centralisation,\r\nand the distinction of ranks. The corresponding bases of liberty are\r\nequality, and independence. The spirit of unity or centralisation is\r\nalready beginning to appear in several of the United States. (See\r\n_Letter XXIX._).\r\n\r\nIt is not strictly correct to say that the Americans have renounced\r\nthe principle of authority; for they have from the beginning adopted\r\nthe principle of the sovereignty of the people. It is true that they\r\nunderstood it, at first, negatively; that is as a simple denial of\r\nauthority in the European sense, or of military power founded on\r\nconquest; but when the doctrine of equality had once secured to\r\nthe democracy the superiority over the Middle Class, the democracy\r\ngradually took upon itself the exercise of that sovereignty, for its\r\nown interest, well or ill understood, at the dictation of its passions\r\ngood or bad; here, then, was power in the fullest extent of the word,\r\nhere was a dictatorate: not indeed permanent and steady, but showing\r\nitself by starts and at intervals. For the most of the time it may\r\nbe said to have slumbered, and left the field free to the spirit of\r\nindividuality; it has roused itself occasionally only to strike a\r\ndecisive blow, and to sink back again into its slumbers; but however\r\nirregular may have been its action, still here has been power, and\r\npower legal in its character and bold in its operations, and gradually\r\nextending their sphere.\r\n\r\nThe New England States, which are the incarnation of the spirit of\r\ndivision and individualism, have advanced little in this direction.\r\nThe old Southern States, although they have more of the spirit of\r\ncentralisation, have also shown themselves timid in this matter. The\r\nMiddle States, and particularly New York, have made the greatest\r\nprogress; those of the West, and particularly of the Northwest, seem\r\ndisposed to imitate them.\r\n\r\nThis centripetal power has operated in two ways; negatively, in setting\r\nlimits, and sometimes narrow ones, to the independence of personal\r\naction, whether exercised singly by individuals or collectively by\r\ncompanies. It has, for example, reduced the privileges of incorporated\r\ncompanies in general, and the railroad and banking companies in\r\nparticular, or rather it has assumed to itself to be omnipotent\r\nin regard to them; at this moment, the democracy in the North is\r\nraising the hue and cry after all companies. It has imposed various\r\nrestrictions upon commerce, such for instance, as the inspection laws\r\nrelative to exported produce. Positively, it has interfered with the\r\nprivate transactions of individuals, and suspended or annulled them;\r\nthus in the West, _ex post facto_ laws have been passed in favour of\r\ndebtors; or the courts which refused to yield, have been abolished\r\nin a body, as in Kentucky; or monopolies have been created and sold\r\nfor the profit of the State, as in New Jersey. Within a few years\r\nother measures of a more fundamental and comprehensive nature have\r\nbeen adopted, and the centralisation of the schools, the means of\r\ncommunication, and the banks, the three institutions of the most\r\nvital importance in a society devoted to industry, has already been\r\ncommenced. Thus the germ of a vigourous central authority, which will\r\nembrace all the ruling interests of the country, is already beginning\r\nto sprout. In this respect the North and the South, the East and the\r\nWest, with the exception of New England, which is held back by its\r\nspirit of subdivision,[DU] seem to be unanimous.\r\n\r\nIf any danger is to be feared in the Northern States, during the coming\r\nperiod, it is not the absence, but the excess of power that is to be\r\napprehended. Whilst the democracy in these States retains its jealousy\r\nof the military, it appears to be regardless of the accumulation of\r\npower in the hands of the legislators. It refuses to appeal to arms,\r\neven for the suppression of the most brutal violence; but it is willing\r\nto use or abuse the omnipotence of the popular representation, and it\r\nwould not hesitate, in case it should be provoked by circumstances, to\r\nexercise it in the most tyrannical manner. A representative government\r\nloses the character of a compromise between the different social\r\ninterests, and degenerates into an instrument of despotism in the hands\r\nof the multitude. In America, it had its origin in the concessions\r\nof the Middle Class to the democracy. At present the positions are\r\nreversed; the Middle Class now stands in need of concessions and does\r\nnot seem likely to get them.\r\n\r\nInstead of the physical tortures of the Inquisition, this despotism, if\r\nit gains strength and stability, would practice the most cruel moral\r\ntortures, it would have its Procustes' bed for intellect and wealth;\r\nits level for genius. Under pretence of equality it would establish\r\nthe most fatal uniformity. As it would be successively exercised by\r\nthe changing favourites of the multitude, it would be eminently fickle\r\nand capricious; ever calling in question and unsettling all that was\r\nestablished,[DV] it would end by palsying the spirit of enterprise,\r\nwhich has created the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States, the white democracy has a pedestal in slavery.\r\nIn order to realise its own elevation, it is not obliged to be\r\ncontinually engaged in lowering the superiour classes; it exercises\r\nits authority on what is beneath, and thinks less of attacking what is\r\nover it. In the South, society is divided into masters and slaves; the\r\ndistinction of higher and lower class is there of secondary importance,\r\nparticularly at the present time, when the alarming state of their\r\nrelations with the blacks, obliges all whites to act in concert. In\r\nthe South, moreover, slavery will soon oblige the local governments to\r\nmaintain an armed police, which, while it keeps down the slaves, will\r\nalso serve to prevent the repetition of excesses, by which this section\r\nof the union has recently been sullied, and the imitation of those\r\noutrages on private property and public order, of which the North has,\r\nof late, so frequently been the theatre.\r\n\r\nCentralisation is one half of authority; distinction of ranks,\r\nthe other half, cannot be easily supplied in the United States,\r\nparticularly in the North, where, however, it is necessary that some\r\ninstitution should give stability and strength to authority. There are\r\ntwo sorts of aristocracy; aristocracy of birth, and aristocracy of\r\ntalents. I do not now speak of the aristocracy of money, for this has\r\nno chance of establishing itself, and can acquire influence only by\r\nbeing merged in one of the two others.\r\n\r\nAll great societies which have existed up to this time, have\r\nestablished with more or less solidity, one or the other of these\r\naristocracies, or, to speak more correctly, both. An aristocracy\r\nof talents existed even in the bosom of the Egyptian and Hindoo\r\ncastes; but Christianity first distinctly established an order of\r\nclassification founded on intellect, not only in each nation, but\r\nthroughout the Catholic Church; the Roman Catholic clergy was\r\norganised on this principle. It could not be otherwise; the unity of\r\nGod and of the human race was an article of faith; for the Christian\r\nthere was only one God, the father of all men, before whom all\r\ndistinctions of birth were as nothing.\r\n\r\nBut by the side of this aristocracy of intellect, all nations which\r\nhave reached a lofty political elevation, and founded durable empires,\r\nhave had an aristocracy of birth, a civil and military nobility. Among\r\nsome not very numerous peoples of antiquity, the nobility was composed\r\nof all free citizens, who were inferior in numbers to the slaves. Such\r\nwere the republics of Greece, whose political superiority, however,\r\nwas of short duration. Such were the Arabs, among whom there were\r\nrayas, Christians, and Jews, below the faithful. The nations which have\r\nhad most weight in the balance of European civilisation, have been\r\ndifferently constituted; above the free citizens, they had a hereditary\r\nprivileged class. Such was Rome; such is England; in the same way the\r\nempire of Islam was not solidly or firmly fixed, until a handful of\r\nTurks was placed over the Arabs, as a privileged class.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice, that the last of the great societies which\r\nhave passed over the face of the earth, Christian society, or that\r\nin which the aristocracy of intellect was first fully developed, is\r\nalso that in which aristocracy of birth has been most strongly marked.\r\nThe sons of Japhet, who gave the impulse and acted as leaders to this\r\nmovement of civilisation, brought with them from the North, a strong\r\nspirit of family, with which their political systems have been deeply\r\nimpregnated; thus arose the most strictly hereditary nobility which has\r\never been seen. Till that time the hereditary system had been applied\r\nto caste; the Germans extended hereditary distinctions and functions\r\nto family, with the additional restriction of primogeniture. What\r\nbefore had been an exception in favour of royal families, they applied\r\nto all noble families. This organisation, more or less modified, still\r\nprevails in most of the European States. But yesterday, it seemed as\r\nvigourous as ever in England. It is true that it has there conformed\r\nitself to the spirit of the age, that it has become pliant and elastic,\r\nopened its ranks to the aristocracy of intellect, and consecrated its\r\nwealth and employed its privileges, not in gratifying its own caprices,\r\nnor in satiating its passions, but in spreading all around it, the\r\nnet-work of a vast and beneficent patronage.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, there is a violent reaction against hereditary\r\ndistinctions and aristocracy of birth. On all points of the territory\r\noccupied by the Western civilisation, the aristocracy of feudal origin\r\nis battered down, here by the democracy, there by the Middle Class, and\r\nelsewhere by royalty. In the general league against it, the emperor\r\nof Russia gives his hand to the American democracy and the French\r\n_bourgeoisie_, and the British democracy in the person of O'Connell, is\r\nallied with the king of Prussia and the emperor of Austria.\r\n\r\nWhatever opinion we may entertain of the present value of aristocracy\r\nof birth, we are obliged to acknowledge, that, in the past, it has\r\nrendered great services to the human race. But for the establishment\r\nof the feudal system, the barbarian hordes would have continued to\r\ndrive over the face of Europe, tribe dashing against tribe, nation\r\nhurled against nation. The principal distinction between the Germans\r\nor Normans, and the followers of Attila or Genghis Khan, is that the\r\nformer had the instinct of organisation, as is manifested by their\r\nconception of the feudal system, and the latter were destitute of it.\r\nEngland is chiefly indebted to her aristocracy for her brilliant\r\nsuccess.[DW] I do not regret the past, for our share of glory is still\r\ngreat, although France has been conquered by her rival in the field and\r\nin the cabinet, and in every part of the world, in Europe, America, and\r\nAsia. Yet I may be permitted to say, that if the French aristocracy\r\nhad triumphed in its struggle with Richelieu,[DX] the destinies of the\r\nworld might have been completely changed; and France, perhaps, would\r\nthen have played the part which has fallen to the lot of England.\r\n\r\nThe right of primogeniture, extended beyond the limits of the\r\naristocracy, ought not to be looked upon as a senseless imitation\r\nof the customs of the nobility by vain commoners. Although it may\r\nbe difficult to defend this custom, on the ground of equity, yet it\r\nhas been one of the causes of the greatness of England. It is clear\r\nthat it is favourable to the accumulation of capital in few hands;\r\nnow capital is like man, powerful when united in masses, feeble when\r\ndivided. England is indebted to the law of primogeniture for an ever\r\nswarming army of younger sons, eager to exercise their enterprise in\r\nthe colonies, and contented with their lot, whether because they\r\nreadily obtain assistance from the head of the family, or because\r\nthey are full of energy, and know that by industry they will obtain\r\nwealth, or because they do not think that the world can be arranged on\r\na different system. Meanwhile, the elder sons have formed an opulent\r\nmetropolis, which has given ample aid to its distant possessions in all\r\nemergencies, and has gradually gained the supremacy in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut it would be madness to think of repairing the broken walls of\r\nfeudalism, or to wish to copy, in France or the United States, the\r\nEnglish aristocracy, even with its mode of recruiting its ranks by\r\nthose distinguished for merit and services; these orders of things\r\nhave had their day. Yet all nations which aim to become or to remain\r\npowerful, must have an aristocracy; that is to say, a body, which,\r\nwhether hereditary or not, may preserve and perpetuate traditions, give\r\nsystem and stability to policy, and devote itself to the most difficult\r\nof all arts, which every one at the present day thinks he knows without\r\nhaving learned it, that of governing. A people without an aristocracy\r\nmay shine in letters and art; but its political glory must be as\r\ntransitory as a meteor.\r\n\r\nI know not if I allow myself to be deceived by my admiration for the\r\npast, although I do not conceal from myself how much of tyranny has\r\nbeen exercised over the great mass of mankind. But I cannot bring\r\nmyself to believe, that the hereditary principle, or, in more general\r\nterms, the sentiment of family, should be entirely excluded from the\r\naristocratical part of the new social order, which, although yet\r\nwrapped in uncertainty and mystery, is now struggling into existence\r\non both sides of the Atlantic. The sentiment of family is not becoming\r\nextinct. Like all other social institutions, the constitution of the\r\nfamily has undergone various changes, since the beginning of the\r\nhistorical period. In the earlier times, every thing was swallowed\r\nup in the father, and the individuality--the rights, privileges, and\r\nduties--of the wife and children was the successive growth of ages; but\r\nthrough all these changes, the family sentiment has gained, rather than\r\nlost. If this progressive movement is not violently checked, the new\r\ninstitutions with which our civilisation is now big, must give a place\r\nin the political system to the family sentiment, and it is not easy\r\nto conceive how this can be done, without a certain infusion of the\r\nhereditary principle.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that, in the United States, the family sentiment\r\nis much weaker, than it is in Europe. But we must not confound what is\r\nmerely accidental and temporary, with the permanent acquisitions of\r\ncivilisation. The temporary weakness of the family sentiment was one\r\nof the necessary results of the general dispersion of individuals, by\r\nwhich the colonisation of America has been accomplished; the effect\r\nmust cease with the cessation of the temporary cause which produced it,\r\nthat is, with the interruption of emigration to the West. As soon as\r\nthey have got their growth, the Yankees, whose spirit now predominates\r\nin the Union, quit the paternal roof never to see it again, as\r\nnaturally and with as little emotion, as young birds desert forever\r\ntheir native nest as soon as they are fledged; but the predominance of\r\nthe Yankees, at least, as they now are, does not seem to me destined to\r\nbe perpetual; I do not see in them the ultimate and permanent type of\r\nthe American.\r\n\r\nEven amongst the Yankees themselves the family sentiment has maintained\r\na strong hold, by means of the bible, the sanctity and strictness of\r\nthe marriage tie, the ample powers left to the father in disposing of\r\nhis property.\r\n\r\nWithin the three last centuries, the moveable elements have shot up\r\nwith a wonderful vigour in western civilisation. Manufactures and the\r\npress, the organ of philosophy and profane learning, have destroyed\r\nthe balance between the opposing forces of innovation and conservation,\r\nwhose equilibrium is necessary to constitute order. These two new\r\npowers, whose tendency is to reform every thing, have gained the\r\nadvantage over the old powers of society, and trampled down the twofold\r\naristocracy of birth and talents, the clergy and the nobility. Must we,\r\nthen, conclude that these two aristocracies, or even either of them,\r\nare stone dead; or must we not rather admit that order, that is to say,\r\nthe equipoise of the innovating and the conservative powers, cannot\r\nsubsist, unless authority is reconstructed in its ancient strength,\r\nwithout, however, retaining the brutal traits of its former character?\r\nIs not this a reason that the hierarchy should be established at\r\nleast as firmly as in past times? Although it need not borrow from\r\nthe past the unyielding, unelastic, and absolute features of the old\r\naristocracies. And is there any principle of stability and solidity,\r\ncomparable to that of hereditary transmission? One may be permitted, or\r\nrather is obliged, to doubt it.\r\n\r\nSystems of great stability have, doubtless, been organised without\r\nhereditary succession. The Catholic hierarchy offers the most complete\r\nexample of this fact; it has now stood eighteen hundred years. But\r\nin order to produce this result, it was necessary to root out the\r\nsentiment of family from the bosoms of its members, by binding them to\r\ncelibacy; and to substitute for the natural principle of stability,\r\nthat of hereditary succession, a merely artificial principle, that\r\nof rigourous discipline, and passive obedience,--or in other words,\r\nstability has here been obtained at the sacrifice of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe two powers of commerce and the press are eminently fluctuating\r\nand unquiet, only because they are not yet regularly organised.\r\nThey are susceptible of being modified, and of being restrained in\r\ntheir innovating tendencies, so as to render the restoration of the\r\nconservative force in all its vigour less necessary. The industrial\r\ninterest would certainly be less averse to the privileges of the lay\r\naristocracy, if it were permitted to participate in them, or if it\r\nhad its own peculiar prerogatives. Learning, of which the press is\r\nthe sword, would have showed less antipathy towards the spiritual\r\nhierarchy, had not the latter repulsed and rejected it. It is not\r\nimpossible that we may be destined to witness a sort of industrial\r\nnobility; it is even possible that we may come, by degrees, in the\r\ncourse of time, to entertain the question of a more or less complete\r\nmonopoly of learning and the press under some form or another. Instead\r\nof throwing down the aristocracy, we might give it additional strength\r\nand stability, by connecting it with learning and industry, which would\r\nthen serve as its buttresses, instead of becoming the instruments of\r\nits ruin. In such a system as this, the aristocracy would be less\r\ncompact and less exclusive; it would soar less loftily over the rest\r\nof mankind; but it would cover more ground, it would gain in breadth\r\nand length what it lost in height, and it would leave nothing beyond\r\nthe reach of its influence. Equality would probably gain by this\r\narrangement; but human independence would lose by it.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to attempt to guess at the future forms which the\r\nhierarchy may assume, to foresee the different interests of which\r\nsociety will hereafter be composed, or to name beforehand the\r\ninstitutions in which they will embody themselves. A multitude of\r\ncombinations, which no one can divine, are possible. Many will take\r\nplace, either successively in the same country, or simultaneously in\r\ndifferent countries. But two things appear to me to be certain: one of\r\nthese is, that new social phenomena of great magnitude are on the eve\r\nof being exhibited, either in America or in Europe; and the other, that\r\nthe sentiment of family cannot be ultimately and absolutely erased\r\nfrom the political catalogue.\r\n\r\nFor Europeans, the immediate and complete abolition of a hereditary\r\naristocracy seems to me beset with the greatest difficulties. The\r\nnations of Western Europe have received their laws and usages from\r\nthe Germans and Romans, that is, from two stocks strongly impregnated\r\nwith the sentiment of family; there is not an inch of their soil,\r\na stone of their monuments, a line of their national songs, which\r\ndoes not awaken this sentiment by recalling this twofold origin; it\r\nseems, then, impossible that they should be ready to adopt at once a\r\npolitical system, in which it was allowed no place nor consideration.\r\nWe may, however, be sure that the principle of hereditary succession\r\nmust henceforth be limited within certain bounds. The idea of\r\nperpetuity, whether of punishment or of reward, is foreign from our\r\nage, and will not, certainly, be more acceptable to future ages.\r\nWe live longer in the space of time than our fathers; the same\r\nnumber of years, therefore, represents a much greater duration than\r\nformerly. If the aristocratic investiture were to endure only for a\r\nfew generations, aristocracy would not cease to be the most coveted\r\nof privileges and the most stable of institutions; while the jealousy\r\nof the non-privileged classes would be less keen in regard to its\r\nprerogatives, if the nobility bore upon its front the inscription;\r\n\"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, would not be enough; the aristocracy of birth requires a\r\nspur. To exercise the most important functions, it is not enough that\r\none has taken the trouble to be born. There is something monstrous\r\nin the privilege of the English peerage, of being legislators by\r\nhereditary right. In the Middle Ages it was necessary to have gained\r\nthe spurs, before one could gird on the sword and raise the banner of\r\na knight. In Rome, birth made Patricians, but not Senators. Similar\r\nrestrictions would be useful in all countries; with a people like the\r\nFrench and the Southern Europeans, they would be indispensable.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say whence a hereditary aristocracy in France is\r\nto be derived, if we must really have one. A nucleus of old families\r\nor of military men would be wanting, around which the new elements\r\nmight group themselves. Now, the old French nobility allowed itself\r\nto be degraded to the state of menials under Louis XIV., and sunk\r\ninto the grossest debauchery under Louis XV.; the trials of exile\r\ndid nothing for those who escaped the revolutionary axe; when they\r\nre-appeared amongst us, they had forgotten nothing, and learned\r\nnothing. The infusion of the military aristocracy of the empire has\r\nnot regenerated it. Is the retirement to which the old nobility has\r\ncondemned itself since the revolution of 1830, a retreat, in which by\r\nmeditation and repentance it is to renew its youth, or is it not rather\r\na tomb, in which it has buried itself forever? Will the old soil be\r\nheaved by earthquakes into new inequalities of surface? Have we among\r\nour peasants some unknown scions of the slayers of Cæsar, or of the\r\nchildren of Brennus, who will be revealed to the world by some mighty\r\nconvulsions? Or will some Tartar horde from the North, the great hive\r\nof nations, put an end to our domestic quarrels, fix themselves in our\r\npalaces, seize our most fertile fields, wed our noblest, richest, and\r\nloveliest heiresses, and, sword in hand, proclaim to us; \"The reign of\r\nlawyers is over, ours is begun.\"\r\n\r\nIf the United States have also to constitute an aristocracy, and give\r\npolitical existence to the sentiment of family, their future would be\r\nyet more cloudy and uncertain than our own. The hereditary element of\r\naristocracy has always come from conquest, or, at least, has supported\r\nitself, by alliance or compromise, by the sword of the conqueror.\r\nHow can there be a conquest in the United States? It is possible that\r\nthey may conquer Mexico, but they cannot be conquered by it. It cannot\r\nbe supposed that some red Alexander or Charlemagne from the distant\r\nsteppes of the West, heading the fierce tribes of the Pawnee braves,\r\nand dragging in his victorious train swarms of revolted negroes, can\r\never become the founder of a military dynasty and aristocracy. If the\r\nUnion should ever be dissolved, and the hardy sons of the West, pouring\r\ndown from the Alleghanies, should ever conquer the people of the North,\r\nenervated by luxury and enfeebled by anarchy, and those of the South,\r\nweakened by servile wars, still no germ of a hereditary aristocracy\r\nwould exist in such a conquest; for the victors and vanquished would\r\nall be of the same family.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States, however, are already organised on the principle\r\nof hereditary aristocracy. It is true that the privileged class is so\r\nnumerous, that, unless a privilege is established within a privilege,\r\nthey do not form an aristocracy properly so called; but the fear of a\r\nrising of the blacks keeps the whites closely united and forces them to\r\nsubmit to a vigourous organisation of authority at every sacrifice. The\r\nrelative situation of the whites and blacks admits of no hesitation.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the establishment of a hierarchy possessing any\r\nstability, would be the most difficult in the States without slaves,\r\nand that the elevation of the sentiment of family to political\r\ndominion, would there encounter the most vigourous resistance. In the\r\nmaritime States north of the Potomac, the difficulty would seem to be\r\ninsurmountable. These States contain large towns, with an extensive\r\ncommerce carried on by great houses, great factories in the English\r\nstyle, powerful trading, financial, and manufacturing companies,\r\nthat is to say, the germs of an extreme inequality; yet their laws\r\nconsecrate a system of absolute equality, and the sovereign democracy\r\nshows itself resolved to maintain it at all costs. Between these two\r\ncounteracting forces, a struggle is going on, and cases might be\r\nimagined in which the contest may assume a terrible character. If any\r\ncause were to interrupt the prosperity of these States; if, by means of\r\na separation, which, however, is daily becoming less and less probable,\r\nthe markets of the South were to be shut against their merchants and\r\nmanufacturers; if the sons of the farmers and their hired workmen could\r\nno longer have access to the lands and growing cities of the West; if,\r\nto crown their misery, a foreign war should blockade their harbours,\r\nthey would be exposed to the most frightful convulsions. The Northern\r\nStates, then, must remain indissolubly wedded to the Union of the\r\nStates, and firmly devoted to the policy of peace with the European\r\nmonarchies.\r\n\r\nIf, then, it were proved that there was an irresistible necessity\r\nfor a distinction of ranks in every society, and that the principle\r\nof inheritance or sentiment of family must be one of the constituent\r\nprinciples of a privileged class, which is requisite to form the apex\r\nof the social pyramid, it must be acknowledged that the prospect of the\r\nNorth is more dark and alarming than that of the South. By the exercise\r\nof unyielding vigilance over the slaves, the South may continue to\r\nmaintain the outward forms of a regular social system. It would,\r\nindeed, be a retrograde system, for it would be morally a copy of the\r\nancient order of society, which had its day before the advent of the\r\nChrist, patched up with the improved material order of modern times; it\r\nwould be despotism, but an orderly, organised despotism, which after\r\nall would be a less terrible scourge than the anarchy which threatens\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, whatever may be the destiny of aristocracy and the\r\npolitical fate of the family sentiment, I am loath to believe, that\r\nall that energy and intelligence which I have witnessed in the Northern\r\nStates of the Anglo-American Union, can be swallowed up and lost. No\r\ndeductions of logic can force me to conclude, that a society, superiour\r\nto any that has yet flourished in our ancient continent, will not,\r\none day, and that soon, exist in the fine regions on the east and the\r\nwest of the Alleghanies, around the wide basin of the great lakes, and\r\nalong the far-stretching banks of these mighty rivers. It cannot be\r\nthat a superiour race has transported its children to these shores to\r\ndevour each other. If, on the one side, American civilisation seems to\r\nbe exposed to formidable dangers, it presents itself in other points\r\nof view, with strongly marked features of permanency and stability. If\r\ngreat perils encompass its cradle, is it not the cradle of an infant\r\nHercules?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DU] It has already been mentioned that Massachusetts has lately\r\nadopted the new policy in regard to public works. [And it might be\r\nadded in respect to the school-system.--TRANSL.]\r\n\r\n[DV] In 1834, the Ohio legislature incorporated a Life and Trust\r\nCompany, with very great powers; the company was organised in 1835,\r\nand in 1836, a proposition was made in the legislature the effect of\r\nwhich would have been indirectly to abolish it. Happily the legislature\r\nsaw the necessity of keeping up the credit of the State by a faithful\r\nadherence to its engagements, and the proposition was rejected. Mr\r\nDallas, of Philadelphia, who has been a Senator of the United States,\r\nhas quite recently urged the adoption of _ex post facto_ measures, with\r\nthe object of annulling the charter of the United States Bank.\r\n\r\n[DW] The English aristocracy is accessible to every man of superior\r\nqualities. The king can and often does make a peer of a commoner,\r\nand the order of knights, which is the lowest degree of nobility, is\r\nessentially an aristocracy of talents and personal services, not being\r\nhereditary. But if the aristocracy of intellect has thus got a footing\r\nin the aristocracy of birth, the latter has also encroached upon the\r\nformer; for with the constitution of the Anglican church, and in the\r\nabsence of monasteries and the numerous gratuitous institutions of the\r\nolden time, it is more difficult for a swine-herd, like Sixtus V., to\r\nrise in the establishment at the present day, than it would have been\r\nfor him to reach the summit of the Catholic hierarchy in the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\n[DX] The French aristocracy which fought the fight with Richelieu was\r\nProtestant, and was more enlightened than the English aristocracy of\r\nthe same day. French protestantism was the flower of Europe in every\r\nrespect, even in industry. It is well known that the English and German\r\nmanufactures made great progress immediately after the revocation of\r\nthe edict of Nantes, which drove four hundred thousand of our fellow\r\ncountrymen from France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    NEW YORK, OCTOBER 22, 1835.\r\n\r\nOur old European societies have a heavy burden to bear; it is that of\r\nthe Past. Each age is the guarantee of the acts of those that have gone\r\nbefore it, and imposes a similar obligation on those which follow it.\r\nWe are paying interest on our fathers' errors; we pay it in the first\r\nplace under the form of the public debt; we pay it also in the charges\r\nfor the support of our fine army, for among the causes which oblige all\r\nEurope to keep the flower of its population under arms, we must reckon\r\nthe animosities of our fathers. We pay it, and at a higher rate, in all\r\nthose habits of distrust and suspicion, which have been bequeathed\r\nto us from times of anarchy and despotism. The accumulated weight of\r\na long Past must, indeed, be an insupportable burden, since the Roman\r\nempire, first in Rome, and afterwards in Constantinople, whither it was\r\nremoved to escape the load, crumbled and sunk beneath it. All nations,\r\nwhich have been the glory of the world, have been ground to a lifeless\r\ndust, like the ashes of the tombs, by the pressure of a Past, which\r\nhemmed them in on every side. Will the Europe of our age undergo the\r\nfate of its predecessors? There is reason to hope that it will be more\r\nfortunate; for, having their example before its eyes, it must be wiser\r\nthan they, and it is at the same time more pliant in its temper, and\r\nmore elastic in its forms.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends, some time ago visiting the great iron-works of\r\nCrawshay & Co., in Wales, was struck with the fact, that the numerous\r\nrailroads connected with the works, were constructed on an old and\r\nvery imperfect system. On inquiring the reason, and observing that the\r\nsaving in traction, would pay the expense of a re-construction with the\r\nimproved rail, \"Nothing is more just,\" he was told; \"but we retain our\r\nold flat rails, and we shall do so for a long time, because it would\r\ntake two or three years to make a change; and in the mean while, it\r\nbeing impossible to keep the wagons running on both rails at the same\r\ntime, we should have to stop operations, and to leave fifty thousand\r\nworkmen without work and without bread. The difficulty is merely in\r\nthe transition, but at present it seems to be insurmountable.\" So it\r\nis in regard to society. It is easy to see that one system has decided\r\nadvantages over another, and that if society could be transported\r\nfrom one to the other by a blow of the wand, much would be gained;\r\nbut between the two there is a great gulf. How can it be passed? How\r\nis it possible to assure vested right, to which nothing seems to be\r\nguarantied on the opposite side? How overcome the opposition of the\r\nprivileged class, who resist the change? How check the impatience of\r\nthe multitude, eager to enter into the enjoyment of the benefits which\r\nit expects to find on the other shore?\r\n\r\nIn regard to social reforms, the question is wonderfully simplified,\r\nby merely transplanting it, that is, by going into new countries to\r\nresolve it. The old country is then abandoned to old interests and old\r\nideas, and the emigrant lands disengaged and unembarrassed, ready to\r\nundertake every thing, and disposed to try every thing. He has left\r\nbehind him in the mother-country a thousand associations and relations,\r\nwhich surround existence, and give it, if you please, its ornaments and\r\nits charm, but which also tend to check its activity, and make society\r\nslow to answer the demands for reform. The first of all innovations is\r\nthe change of soil, and this necessarily involves others. Vested rights\r\ndo not emigrate; they are bound to the old soil; they know no other,\r\nand no other knows them. Privileges, which are respected because they\r\nare consecrated by time, do not venture upon a new soil, or if they\r\nhazard the trial, they cannot become acclimated there. A colony is like\r\na besieged city; each one must serve with his person; each one passes\r\nonly for what he is worth personally. In a society which has no Past,\r\nthe Past counts for nothing.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, therefore, that projects of social reform,\r\nconceived in the bosom of established societies, in which opportunity\r\nis afforded for the calm exercise of thought, have generally been\r\nobliged to be transported to other shores, and to take root in\r\nbarbarous lands, in order to be carried into execution, and to be\r\nembodied under the form of a new society. Civilisation has advanced\r\nfrom the East toward the West, increasing in vigour at every remove,\r\nalthough the founders of new colonies have generally quitted a more\r\ncivilised country for a barbarous one. Thus Italy and Greece, daughters\r\nof Asia and Egypt, have gone beyond their mothers; thus western Europe\r\nhas eclipsed the glories of Greece and Rome. Soon after having given\r\nbirth to the new nations, the old ones have perished violently, or\r\nhave fallen into an obscurity worse than death, merely from a want\r\nof will or energy to apply the principles which gave vigour to their\r\noffspring,--principles of a new social order, founded on the wider\r\nextension of liberty and the greater diffusion of privileges,--to their\r\nown wants.\r\n\r\nProvidence had done much to prepare the European races, when\r\ntransported across the ocean, for becoming the founders of great and\r\npowerful nations. The English-Americans, who were the last comers, and\r\ndid not arrive until after the Spaniards had established their dominion\r\nover equinoctial and southern America, left the Old World only after\r\nit had been aroused and agitated by the intellectual revolution of\r\nwhich Luther was the Mirabeau, and of which in England, Henry VIII.\r\nwas the Robespierre and the Napoleon. This great event had already\r\nsown those seeds in the human breast, which were to swell and expand\r\nthrough succeeding ages. England was already big with those habits of\r\nindustry and order, which were destined to make her the first nation\r\nof the Old World in the sphere of industry and in political greatness.\r\nHer children, therefore, carried with them the germ of those principles\r\nand institutions, which were to secure to them the same supremacy\r\nin the New. They embarked, at least this was the case with those of\r\nNew England, the pilgrims, the fathers of the Yankees, after having\r\nundergone the ordeal of fire and water, after having been seven times\r\ntried between the sledge and the anvil, between persecution and exile.\r\nThey arrived wearied out with political quarrels, and bent on devoting\r\ntheir energies to pacific and useful purposes.\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves under a climate which differed little from\r\nthat of their native skies. Thus they escaped the danger of becoming\r\nenervated by the influences of a warm and balmy atmosphere, like that\r\nin which the fiery spirits of the Castilian race were tamed; they\r\nlanded on an almost uninhabited shore, and had only a few poor tribes\r\nof Red Skins for enemies and neighbours, whilst the Spaniards had to\r\ncontend with the numerous armies of the brave Aztecs in Mexico, and\r\ntheir successors, the Creoles, have had to keep in check on the one\r\nside the Comanches and the _Indios Bravos_ of the north, and on the\r\nother the Araucanians of the southern Cordilleras. If the English had\r\nencountered a numerous population like that which resisted Cortez, they\r\nwould have had to conquer it, and doubtless they would have succeeded\r\nin so doing; but after the victory, they would have been obliged to\r\nkeep it in subjection, and the yoke of the English race is harder than\r\nthat of the Spaniards. Their social organisation would then have been\r\nfounded on the servitude of the inferior castes, red and mixed; the\r\nnew society would have been tainted with a deep-seated disease, which\r\nwould have reduced it to a much lower state than European society, and\r\nhave sunk it to the level of ancient communities, which were founded on\r\npersonal slavery. It is not, indeed, completely free from this taint at\r\npresent; since negroes have been brought into the country, and twelve\r\nStates out of twentyfour are defiled with the pollution of slavery. The\r\nportion of the country which has been left for the pure white race, is,\r\nhowever, ample enough to receive a large community composed of the same\r\nmaterials with the European nations, and affording great facilities for\r\ncombining them in a better order.\r\n\r\nIf they had found powerful enemies to combat, if war had been\r\nconstantly hanging over their heads, they would have been obliged to\r\nsubmit themselves to a military aristocracy, spite of the instinct of\r\nself-government and independence which runs in British veins, and of\r\nwhich they had a double share. In that case, the Anglo-American society\r\nwould have been only a copy, and an inferior copy of the English; as\r\nthe Canadians, for example, were merely an imitation of the French,\r\nunder the old order of things. The English colonists sometimes had to\r\nrepel the attacks of the French, who had possession of the west and of\r\nthe basin of the St Lawrence; but after the capture of Quebec, they\r\nfound themselves completely delivered from the most momentous public\r\ncharge, that of defending their territory and their independence.\r\nThey were, therefore, able to dispense with a military establishment,\r\nto turn all their thoughts and energies to their domestic concerns,\r\nand to devote themselves exclusively to the work of colonisation.\r\nThey ceased to stand in need of the English guardianship, and they\r\nfreed themselves from it, that they might expand themselves and take\r\ntheir own course without let or hindrance. Finally, yielding to their\r\nnatural impulse, they tried their great democratic experiment, which\r\nis already shedding such a brilliant light upon the prospect of\r\nimprovement in the condition of the lower classes in all countries.\r\nFrom these circumstances and influences, has resulted a new political\r\nand physiological phenomenon, a hitherto unknown variety of the human\r\nrace, inferior to the English and French types in many respects,\r\nparticularly in taste and philosophy, but superiour to the rest of the\r\nhuman family by its extraordinary combination of sagacity, energy of\r\nwill and hardy enterprise, by its admirable aptitude for business, by\r\nits untiring devotion to work, and above all by its recognition and\r\nprotection of the rights of the labouring classes, hitherto treated as\r\nthe offscourings of society.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that the Americans are called to continue the series of\r\nthat succession of progressive movements which have characterised our\r\ncivilisation ever since it quitted its cradle in the East. This people\r\nwill become the founders of a new family, although perhaps the features\r\nwhich now predominate in it will hereafter cease to be the prominent\r\ntraits; whilst the Spanish-Americans seem to be an impotent race, which\r\nwill leave no posterity behind it, unless by means of one of those\r\ninundations which are called conquests, a current of richer blood from\r\nthe North or the East, shall fill its exhausted veins.\r\n\r\nAn eminent philosopher, who is an honour to the French name,[DY]\r\ndefines the progress of the human race in its slow and majestic\r\npilgrimage round our globe, by the term initiation. Following out this\r\nthought, we may pronounce North America, at least the non-slave-holding\r\nStates, to be already in advance of us; for, in many respects, what\r\namongst us is accessible only to a small number of the elect, has\r\nbecome common property in the United States, and is familiar to the\r\nvulgar. The conquests of the human mind, to which the Reformation\r\ngave the signal and the impulse, and the great discoveries of science\r\nand art, which, in Europe are yet concealed from the general eye by\r\nthe bandage of ignorance and the mists of theory, are, in America,\r\nexposed to the vulgar gaze and placed within the reach of all. There\r\nthe multitude touches and handles them at will. Examine the population\r\nof our rural districts, sound the brains of our peasants, and you will\r\nfind that the spring of all their actions is a confused medley of the\r\nBible parables with the legends of a gross superstition. Try the same\r\noperation on an American farmer, and you will find that the great\r\nscriptural traditions are harmoniously combined, in his mind, with the\r\nprinciples of modern science as taught by Bacon and Descartes, with the\r\ndoctrine of moral and religious independence proclaimed by Luther, and\r\nwith the still more recent notions of political freedom. He is one of\r\nthe _initiated_.\r\n\r\nAmongst us the powerful instruments and machinery of science and art,\r\nthe steam-engine, the balloon, the voltaic pile, the lightning-rod,\r\ninspire the multitude with a religious dread. In France, out of a\r\nhundred peasants in the recesses of our provinces, you will not\r\nfind one, who, after having witnessed their effects, would dare to\r\nlay his hand upon them; they would fear to be struck dead, like the\r\nsacrilegious wretch who touched the ark of the Lord. But to the\r\nAmerican, on the contrary, these are all familiar objects; he knows\r\nthem all by name, at least, and he feels that they are his. To the\r\nFrench peasant they are mysterious and terrible beings, like his fetish\r\nto the negro, his manitou to the Indian; but to the cultivator of the\r\nwestern wilds, they are, what they are to a member of the Institute,\r\ntools, instruments of labour or science; again, therefore he is one of\r\nthe _initiated_.\r\n\r\nThere is no _profanum vulgus_ in the United States, at least amongst\r\nthe whites; and this is true not only in regard to steam-engines and\r\nelectrical phenomena, but the American multitude is also much more\r\ncompletely _initiated_ than the European mass, in all that concerns the\r\ndomestic relations and the household. The marriage tie is held more\r\nsacred amongst the lowest classes of American society, than among the\r\nMiddle Class of Europe. Although the marriage ceremony has fewer forms\r\nthan amongst us, and the connexion is more easily dissolved,[DZ] cases\r\nof adultery are extremely rare. The unfaithful wife would be a lost\r\nwoman; the man, who should seduce a woman, or should be known to have\r\nan illicit connexion, would be excommunicated by the popular clamour.\r\nIn the United States, even the man of the labouring class is more\r\ncompletely _initiated_ in the obligations of the stronger sex toward\r\nthe weaker, than most of the men of the Middle Class in France. Not\r\nonly does the American mechanic and farmer spare his wife, as much as\r\npossible, all the hard work and employments unsuitable to the sex, but\r\nhe exhibits towards her and every other woman, a degree of attention\r\nand respect, which is unknown to many persons amongst us, who pride\r\nthemselves on their education and refinement. In public places and in\r\nthe public conveyances, in the United States, no man, whatever may be\r\nhis talents and his services, is treated with any particular attention;\r\nno precedence or privilege is allowed him; for all men are equal. But\r\na woman, whatever may be the condition and fortune of her husband, is\r\nsure of commanding universal respect and attention.[EA]\r\n\r\nIn political affairs, the American multitude has reached a much\r\nhigher degree of initiation than the European mass, for it does not\r\nneed to be governed; every man here has in himself the principle of\r\nself-government in a much higher degree, and is more fit to take a\r\npart in public affairs. It is also more fully _initiated_ in another\r\norder of things, which are closely connected with politics and morals,\r\nthat is, in all that relates to labour. The American mechanic is a\r\nbetter workman,[EB] he loves his work more, than the European. He is\r\n_initiated_ not merely in the hardships, but also in the rewards, of\r\nindustry; he dresses like a member of Congress; his wife and daughters\r\nare dressed like the wife and daughters of a rich New York merchant,\r\nand like them, follow the Paris fashions. His house is warm, neat, and\r\ncomfortable; his table is almost as plentifully provided as that of the\r\nwealthiest of his fellow citizens. In this country, the articles of\r\n_the first necessity_ for the whites, embrace several objects, which,\r\namongst us, are articles of luxury, not merely among the lower, but\r\namong some of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nThe American multitude is more deeply _initiated_ in what belongs\r\nto the dignity of man, or, at least, to their own dignity, than the\r\ncorresponding classes in Europe. The American operative is full of\r\nself-respect, and he shows it not only by an extreme sensibility,\r\nby pretensions which to the European _bourgeoisie_ would appear\r\nextraordinary,[EC] and by his reluctance to make use of the term\r\n_master_, for which he substitutes that of _employer_, but also by\r\ngood faith and scrupulous exactness in his engagements; he is above\r\nthose vices of slavery, such as theft and lying, which are so prevalent\r\namongst hirelings with us, particularly amongst those of the towns\r\nand their manufactories.[ED] The French operative is more respectful\r\nand submissive in his manners, but hard-pressed by poverty, and\r\nsurrounded by temptations, he rarely neglects a chance of cheating\r\nhis _bourgeois_, when he can do it with impunity. The operative of\r\nLyons practises the _piquage d'onces_; those of Rheims secrete the\r\ngold lace.[EE] There are, doubtless, frauds committed in America;\r\nmore than one smart fellow has his conscience oppressed with numerous\r\npeccadilloes. How many strolling Yankee pedlers have sold charcoal for\r\nindigo, and soapstone for soap to the rural housewives! But in the\r\nUnited States these petty frauds are rare exceptions. The character of\r\nthe American workman is in a high degree honourable, and excites the\r\nenvy of the European when he compares the prospect here presented to\r\nhim with the aspect of things in his own country.[EF]\r\n\r\nWhat has been said above applies still more strongly to the farmer;\r\nnot being obliged, like the operative, daily to contest the rate of\r\nhis wages with an employer, surrounded by his equals, and a stranger\r\nto the seductions of the city, the American farmer possesses the\r\ngood qualities of the operative at least in an equal degree, and has\r\nhis faults in a much less degree. He is less unjust and less jealous\r\ntowards the richer or more cultivated classes.\r\n\r\nIf then we examine the condition of the American multitude, we find\r\nit, taken as a whole, to be much superiour to that of the mass in\r\nEurope. It is true that it appears to be almost completely destitute\r\nof certain faculties, which are possessed by the European populace.\r\nThere are, for instance, at times, a hundredfold more gleams of taste\r\nand poetical genius in the brain of the most beggarly _lazzarone_ of\r\nNaples, than in that of the republican mechanic or farmer of the New\r\nWorld. The houseless young vagabonds of Paris have transient flashes of\r\nchivalric feeling and greatness of soul, which the American operative\r\nnever equals. This is because the national character of the Italians is\r\nimpregnated with a love of art, and that generous sentiments are one of\r\nthe distinguished traits of the French character, and the very lowest\r\nclasses of each nation have some portion of the national spirit. But\r\nit does not belong to the multitude to be poets and artists, in Italy,\r\nor models of chivalry, in France. Their perfection, above all and in\r\nevery country, consists in knowing and fulfilling their duties to\r\nGod, to their country, to their families, to themselves, in assiduous\r\nand honest industry, in being good citizens, good husbands, and good\r\nfathers, in providing for the welfare and guarding the virtue of those\r\ndependent upon them. In order to make a fair comparison between the\r\nmultitude in Europe and the multitude in America, we should consider\r\nthem in reference to these qualities; for these belong to all varieties\r\nof the human race and all forms of civilization, and upon their\r\ndevelopment and stability in the greatest number, depends the strength\r\nof empires. To render the parallel between the two hemispheres perfect,\r\nit would be necessary to set against the mechanic and the farmer in the\r\nUnited States, the members of a corresponding class among a people of\r\nTeutonic origin, language, and religion, that is, the English operative\r\nand farmer. European civilisation, setting aside the Sclavonians, who\r\nhave recently appeared with brilliant success upon the stage, divides\r\nitself into two branches, that of the North, and that of the South, one\r\nTeutonic, the other Latin, distinguished by different qualities and\r\ntendencies. American society, being a scion of one of these branches,\r\ncan be more readily compared with it, than with any of the offsets of\r\nthe other. It is easy, therefore, to determine the superiority of the\r\nAmerican mechanic and farmer to those of England, but it is difficult\r\nto decide how much inferior or superiour any class of American society\r\nis to the corresponding Spanish, Italian, or French class; it is only\r\nnecessary, however, to open one's eyes to be convinced, that the\r\nmultitude among these three people are far from having reached, in\r\nthe direction in which nature points their career, the same degree of\r\nprogress that the Americans have done in theirs.\r\n\r\nThe American democracy certainly has its faults, and I do not think\r\nthat I can be accused of having extenuated them. I have not concealed\r\nits rude demands upon the higher classes, nor its haughty airs\r\nof superiority to other nations. I will even admit, that, in many\r\nrespects, it is rather as a class, and in the lump that it recommends\r\nitself to favour; for the individuals that compose it, are destitute of\r\nthose hearty and affectionate qualities, by which our French peasantry\r\nwould be distinguished, if it were once delivered from the wretchedness\r\nwhich now brutifies it; but it is in the mass and as a whole, that I\r\nnow judge the American multitude.\r\n\r\nThe American democracy is imperious and overbearing towards foreign\r\npeople; but is not a keen sensibility, a good quality rather than a\r\ndefect in a young nation as in a young man, provided that it is backed\r\nby an energetic devotion to a great work? Pride is ridiculous in an\r\nenervated and inert people, but in an enterprising, active, vigourous\r\nnation, it is consciousness of power, and confidence in its high\r\ndestiny. The foreign policy of the American democracy is profoundly\r\negoistic, for national ambition is the characteristic of a growing\r\nnation. Cosmopolitanism is generally a symptom of decline, as religious\r\ntolerance is a sign that faith is on the decay. The pretensions of the\r\nUnited States are unbounded: they aspire to the sovereignty over South\r\nAmerica; they covet one by one the provinces of Mexico; but in spite of\r\nthe rules of morality, it is might which makes right in the relations\r\nbetween people and people. If the United States should wrest the\r\nMexican provinces from the Spanish race, partly by craft and partly by\r\nforce, they would be responsible to God and to man for the consequences\r\nof the robbery; but they would not be alone guilty. If the country\r\nwhich they had seized, flourished in their hands, posterity would\r\npardon the act; but, on the other hand, it would condemn the Mexicans,\r\nif, with such neighbours at their doors, they should continue as at\r\npresent, to stagnate in stupid security and in a miserable lethargy,\r\nand the powers of Europe, if they neglected to warn them and to rouse\r\nthem from their torpor.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were intolerably arrogant towards other people; they spoke\r\nto the all-powerful sovereigns of the monarchical East, and to the\r\nheirs of Alexander the Great, that brutal and imperious language, which\r\nGeneral Jackson has flung into the face of a monarchy of fourteen\r\ncenturies. They treated all who stood in the way of the gratification\r\nof their insatiable thirst for conquest, as slaves who had revolted\r\nagainst the divine will. That Punic faith, with the charge of which\r\nthey branded the memory of their rivals, was often the only faith which\r\nthey practised. Posterity, however, has proclaimed them the greatest\r\npeople of history, because they were successful; that is, because they\r\nformed a durable empire out of conquered nations by the wisdom of their\r\nlaws. The Anglo-Americans have much resemblance to the Romans whether\r\nfor good or for evil. I do not say that they are destined to become\r\nthe masters of the world; I merely mean to affirm that by the side of\r\nfaults which shock and offend foreign nations, they have great powers\r\nand precious qualities which should rather attract our attention. It\r\nis by these that posterity will judge them; by these they have become\r\nformidable to other people. Let us aim to get the vantage-ground of\r\nthem, not by denouncing their defects to the world, but by endeavouring\r\nto make ourselves masters of their good qualities and their valuable\r\nfaculties, and by cultivating and developing our own. These are the\r\nsurest means of maintaining our rank in the world in spite of them and\r\nin spite of all.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the American democracy conducts itself more\r\nand more haughtily abroad, it is jealous of all who fall under the\r\nsuspicion of seeking to encroach upon its sovereignty at home. In this,\r\nit only imitates the most boasted of aristocracies. The system which it\r\nhas pursued towards the higher classes, is dictated by the instinct of\r\nself-preservation, just as that of the European aristocracy and Middle\r\nClass toward the classes respectively below them, has been instinctive\r\nwith them. The democracy is determined to lose none of its conquests,\r\nwhich have been gained, not by plundering its neighbours, not by\r\npillaging provinces, not by robbing travellers, but by the sweat of its\r\nbrow, by its own resolute industry. Who, then, amongst us will cast the\r\nfirst stone at it? I can readily conceive, that, at first sight, we\r\nof the Middle Class in Europe, should be offended by its pretensions,\r\nand that we should feel our sympathy excited by the spectacle of\r\nour American fellows conquered and bound. But let us, nevertheless,\r\nconfess, that this democracy has managed the affairs of the New World\r\nin such a manner as to justify the supremacy it has won, and to excuse\r\nits jealousy towards every thing that might have a tendency to spoil it\r\nof its conquest. This is the first time since the origin of society,\r\nthat the people have fairly enjoyed the fruits of their labours, and\r\nhave shown themselves worthy of the prerogatives of manhood. Glorious\r\nresult! Even though it has been obtained by the temporary humiliation\r\nof the classes with which our education and habits lead us to\r\nsympathise, it is the duty of every good man to rejoice at it, and to\r\nthank God for it!\r\n\r\nWo to tyranny by whomsoever exercised! Far be it from me to apologise\r\nfor the brutal and savage, and sometimes bloody excesses, which have\r\nlately been so often repeated in most of the large towns in the United\r\nStates! Should they be continued, the American democracy will be\r\ndegraded and will lose forever the high position it now occupies. But\r\ncriminal as these acts are, it would be unjust to impute them to the\r\nAmerican people, and to condemn to ignominy the whole body of these\r\nincomparable labourers. Popular excesses in all countries are the\r\nwork of an imperceptible minority, which the existing system in the\r\nUnited States is sufficient to restrain. That system needs, then, some\r\namendment, which shall suit it to preserve the good qualities of the\r\nnation in their purity, and which, indeed, seems already on the point\r\nof being introduced, for theories of absolute liberty are evidently\r\nlosing favour in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to infer from what has been said, that the\r\nAmerican civilisation is superiour to our own. The multitude in the\r\nUnited States is superiour to the multitude in Europe; but the higher\r\nclasses in the New World are inferior to those of the Old, although\r\nthe merits of the latter are rather virtual than real, and belong\r\nrather to the past or the future than to the present; for the higher\r\nclasses in Europe, both aristocracy and _bourgeoisie_, turn their good\r\nqualities to little account, whether on behalf of themselves or the\r\npeople. The higher classes in the United States, with some exceptions\r\nand taken as a whole, have the air and attitude of the vanquished; they\r\nbear the mark of defeat on their front. As they have been always and\r\nin almost all circumstances much mingled with the crowd, both parties\r\nhave naturally borrowed many habits and feelings from each other. This\r\nexchange has been advantageous to the multitude; but less so the higher\r\nclasses. The golden buckler of the Trojan has been exchanged for the\r\nleather shield of the gallant Diomed. Each of the two is, therefore,\r\nsuperiour in one of the two great elements of society, and inferior in\r\nthe other. This is the system of compensation.\r\n\r\nIf, then, from the superiority of the labouring classes in the United\r\nStates, it were necessary to draw a conclusion as to the relative rank\r\nof European and American civilisation in the future, the following\r\nwould be the only necessary inference: in order that American society\r\nshould have the advantage of ours, it would be requisite that it\r\nshould comprise a class, which, intrinsically and in its exterior,\r\nshould be as much elevated above the people, properly so called, as\r\nour higher classes are above the great mass of our population; or, in\r\nother words, it depends upon ourselves to give to our social order\r\nthe advantage over that of the United States, by raising our lower\r\nclass both of the towns and the country from the ignorance and brutal\r\ndegradation in which they are plunged, and developing their powers and\r\nqualities in conformity with our national disposition and the character\r\nof the race to which we belong.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[DY] M. Ballanche.\r\n\r\n[DZ] As in some of the States there is no law of divorce, the\r\nlegislatures grant it in virtue of their legislative omnipotence. Out\r\nof less than 150 acts passed by the New Jersey legislature in 1836,\r\nthirteen were acts authorising divorces.\r\n\r\n[EA] In the mail-coaches, the best seats are always yielded to women,\r\nwithout regard to the order in which the names are booked. The husband\r\nalso does the marketing and often brings home the provisions himself.\r\nNothing is more common than to see men carrying home a goose or a\r\nturkey by the legs, or a basket of fruit. I have before observed that\r\nthe conjugal and social submission of the woman is more complete\r\nin the United States than in France. In France, a woman engages in\r\nbusiness, and with the consent of her husband is acknowledged as a\r\nresponsible agent; but there is nothing of this sort in England and the\r\nUnited States. Our children in Canada have even gone beyond us in this\r\nrespect, and have admitted females to the electoral franchise.\r\n\r\n[EB] The English workman is very skilful. Although in certain branches\r\nwe excel the English, it appears to me incontestable, that at present\r\nthe English workman is the first in Europe. In some respects, he\r\nis also superiour to the American; he will, for example, finish a\r\nparticular piece of work in a better style, but when out of his special\r\nsphere, and separated from the tools of the English workshops, which\r\nare of a superiour kind, he will be at loss. The American workman has\r\na more general aptitude; his sphere is larger, and he can extend it\r\nindefinitely at will. He accomplishes at least, as much as the English\r\nworkman, and when he devotes himself for a long time to the same task,\r\nwhich is not usual with him, he does it better.\r\n\r\n[EC] Thus a shoemaker or tailor will not go to a customer's house to\r\ntake a measure, but requires all, women and men, to come in person to\r\nhis shop.\r\n\r\n[ED] In the relations between the master and the operative, the most\r\ndeplorable usages prevail in our large manufacturing towns. Many of\r\nthe masters are reduced to practise the most disgraceful artifices on\r\ntheir workmen, in order to sustain themselves against the violence of\r\ncompetition; thus, in some workshops and factories, the hands of the\r\nclock are put forward in the morning and backward in the evening. The\r\noperatives commit reprisals in every possible manner.\r\n\r\n[EE] The _piquage d'onces_, or secretion of silk by the workmen, is one\r\nof the cankers of Lyons. The value of the silk thus stolen is estimated\r\nat nearly one million of dollars a year; the thefts committed in the\r\nRheims factories are stated to exceed 600,000 dollars. The operatives\r\nexchange the gold-lace at the dram-shops for about one fourth of its\r\nactual value.\r\n\r\n[EF] The domestics in the United States are almost everywhere much\r\ninferior to the operatives, personal service being here looked upon\r\nas degrading. In many of the States the domestics will not bear to\r\nbe called servants, and take that of _help_; this is the case in New\r\nEngland. The domestic is there a hired agent whose task is light,\r\nand who in many houses takes his meals with the family. On these\r\nconditions, native servants may be had in New England who are attentive\r\nand intelligent; they stand upon their rights, and expect to be treated\r\nwith respect by their employers, but they perform their duties with\r\nan honourable fidelity. In most of the non-slave-holding States, the\r\nservants are chiefly free blacks, who are generally lazy and depraved,\r\nor newly arrived emigrants from Ireland, who are ignorant and without\r\nskill, prone to be most provokingly familiar, and in the intoxication\r\nof their new condition, so different from the squalid misery they have\r\nleft behind them, more disposed to take airs upon themselves, than the\r\nnatives of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 1--page 26.\r\n\r\n_Use of Iron._\r\n\r\nOne must go to England to appreciate the value of iron, the scarcity\r\nof wood having obliged the English to apply it to a great number of\r\npurposes to which no one on the continent would dream of its being\r\napplicable. At every step and under all forms, you meet with cast-iron,\r\nbar-iron, sheet-iron, and steel; machines, piles, columns of all\r\ndimensions from two inches to four feet in diameter, water-pipes and\r\ngas-pipes, posts, grates, bridges, roofs, floors, whole quays and\r\nroads, of iron. But for it, those light and airy structures, so slender\r\nin appearance, yet supporting such enormous weights, the huge six\r\nstory warehouses of St Catharine's docks for instance, would be heavy\r\nand gloomy dungeons. The gas which comes from a distance of seven or\r\neight miles, is made and brought in by the aid of iron. Those bridges,\r\nspringing as it were across the water, those graceful and elegant\r\nfootways across the canals, as well as the fluted columns of Regent's\r\nStreet, are of iron, cast or wrought. The quantity of pig-iron annually\r\nproduced in Great Britain and Ireland, is about 800,000 tons; in France\r\nit amounted in 1834 to 269,000 tons, beside 177,000 tons of bar iron.\r\nThe ordinary price of both kinds with us is about double the price in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nUntil the present day, stone has been almost the only material\r\nemployed in durable works of architecture; but stone having much less\r\ncohesive force than iron, is only suited to the Egyptian, Greek, and\r\nRoman styles of architecture. The light and airy architecture of the\r\nMiddle Ages, requires a material possessing great strength in a small\r\ncompass, such as the metals; and some attempts have already been made\r\nin France and Germany to apply cast-iron to the construction of\r\nGothic structures. Stone has already done all that it is capable of\r\ndoing, and we can have nothing new in architecture, except by means\r\nof new materials. In my opinion, iron is to be the instrument of this\r\nregeneration of the architectural art. The price of pig-iron is now so\r\nlow, that the cost of a building of this material, would not exceed\r\nthat of one constructed of hewn stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 2--page 26.\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Coal mined in France, England, and Belgium._\r\n\r\nMr McCulloch, in his Dictionary of Commerce estimates the quantity of\r\ncoal annually mined in England to amount to 16,000,000 tons.[EG] The\r\nextensive inquiries of M. Le Play, who has carefully examined all the\r\nEnglish coal-fields, have led him to estimate it much higher; it does\r\nnot, probably, fall short of 30,000,000 tons, of which 5,000,000 are\r\nconsumed in the iron manufacture. Mr McCulloch estimates the amount of\r\ncapital employed in the coal-trade at 10,000,000 pounds, and the number\r\nof persons engaged in it at from 160,000 to 180,000. Other estimates\r\ncarry this last number to 206,000, of whom 121,000 work in the mines.\r\n\r\nIn France 2,500,000 tons of coal were raised in 1834, and about 18,000\r\npersons were employed in the mines. France also imports coal from\r\nBelgium and England. Next to England, Belgium furnishes the largest\r\nquantity of coal; the three great coal-fields of Mons, Charleroi, and\r\nLiege with some smaller basins, yielding about 3,200,000 tons annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 3--page 33.\r\n\r\n_Value of Exports of Domestic Produce and Manufactures from England,\r\nFrance, and United States, from 1820 to 1835._\r\n\r\n  -------+---------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n  Years. |       France.       |     England.    |   United States.\r\n  -------+---------------------+-----------------+-------------------\r\n   1820  | francs. 543,100,000 | fr. 910,600,000 | fr. 275,400,000\r\n   1821  |         450,700,000 |     917,500,000 |     232,700,000\r\n   1822  |         427,600,000 |     925,000,000 |     265,800,000\r\n   1823  |         427,100,000 |     890,000,000 |     251,300,000\r\n   1824  |         505,800,000 |     960,000,000 |     269,900,000\r\n   1825  |         543,800,000 |     972,500,000 |     356,800,000\r\n   1826  |         461,000,000 |     787,500,000 |     282,700,000\r\n   1827  |         506,800,000 |     930,000,000 |     314,000,000\r\n   1828  |         511,200,000 |     920,000,000 |     270,000,000\r\n   1829  |         504,200,000 |     895,000,000 |     296,800,000\r\n   1830  |         452,900,000 |     955,000,000 |     316,900,000\r\n   1831  |         455,500,000 |     930,000,000 |     326,600,000\r\n   1832  |         507,400,000 |     921,000,000 |     336,500,000\r\n   1833  |         559,400,000 |     992,500,000 |     374,700,000\r\n   1834  |         509,300,000 |   1,041,000,000 |     432,100,000\r\n   1835  |         577,400,000 |   1,184,200,000 |     539,700,000\r\n\r\nEngland exports hardly any but manufactured articles. The United\r\nStates export chiefly raw produce. Raw Cotton forms half of the value\r\nof their exports, as manufactured cotton forms about half of those\r\nof Great Britain. Agriculture furnishes three fourths or four fifths\r\nof the exports of domestic articles from the United States, and\r\nmanufactures, only one tenth. Above two thirds of the exports of France\r\nare manufactures, and nearly one third, agricultural produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 4--page 36.\r\n\r\n_Shipping._\r\n\r\nStatement of the tonnage belonging to the principal ports of France,\r\nEngland and the United States in 1835.\r\n\r\n  _Ports._         _Tonnage._\r\n  London            566,152\r\n  New York          376,697\r\n  Boston            226,041\r\n  Newcastle         208,100\r\n  Liverpool         207,833\r\n  Sunderland        132,070\r\n  Philadelphia       86,445\r\n  New Orleans        79,467\r\n  New Bedford        76,533\r\n  Whitehaven         65,878\r\n  Hull               63,524\r\n  Bordeaux           69,690\r\n  Marseilles         68,314\r\n  Havre              68,070\r\n  Portland (U. S.)   57,666\r\n  Baltimore          54,416\r\n  Nantes             51,528\r\n  Bristol            42,913\r\n\r\nTo render the comparison exact, it would be necessary to deduct one\r\nfourth from the French tonnage, in order to allow for the different\r\nmodes of measurement. The French method is mathematically more correct,\r\nbut it lays our vessels under the disadvantage of being obliged to pay\r\nheavier tonnage dues; but a law of 1836 has authorised the government\r\nto make a change in this respect.\r\n\r\nOut of 1,824,000 tons of shipping entered and cleared at the French\r\nports in 1835, only 31 per cent. was French shipping; out of 5,025,000\r\ntons entered and cleared at the British ports, 75 per cent. was of\r\nEnglish vessels. In the United States, from 1817 to 1830, foreign\r\nshipping formed less than 15 per cent. of the vessels in the foreign\r\ntrade; in 1831, it was 26 per cent., and in 1832, 30 per cent., leaving\r\n70 per cent. for the American shipping.\r\n\r\nFrench navigation is in a deplorable state of feebleness, and the evil\r\nincreases daily. In 1832, the total amount of French shipping was\r\n670,000 tons, of British 2,225,000, of American 1,440,000. In France\r\nand England the amount varies little from year to year, but in the\r\nUnited States it increases rapidly, and in 1837 it was 1,896,685.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 5--page 38--_omitted._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 6--page 38.\r\n\r\nAll the banks in the United States, like the Bank of France in Paris,\r\nare at once banks of discount and loan, and banks of deposit and\r\ncirculation. Almost the whole currency of this country consists of\r\npaper-money, the metals being chiefly in the the vaults of the banks,\r\nwhich cannot dispense with them, because their bills are payable on\r\ndemand in gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe old Bank of the United States, founded in 1791, had a capital of\r\nten million dollars, the Federal government holding one fifth of the\r\nstock. The present Bank was incorporated in 1816, with the right of\r\nestablishing any number of branches. The Bank of England also has\r\nbranches in Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Gloucester,\r\nBristol, Hull, Newcastle, Norwich, Swansea, and Exeter. The Bank of\r\nFrance has but two branches, one at St. Etienne and the other at\r\nRheims, both established since 1836.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Bank of the United States is 35,000,000, in 350,000\r\nshares of 100 dollars each. That of the Bank of England is 11,000,000\r\npounds, divided into shares of one hundred pounds; and that of the Bank\r\nof France is 90,000,000 francs, in shares of 1000 francs, of which\r\n22,100 are held by the Bank itself. The United States' Bank stock was\r\nat a premium of 25 to 30 per cent. before General Jackson began his war\r\nupon it, that of the Bank of France is at an advance of 129 percent.,\r\nand that of the Bank of England at 116 per cent. advance.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the Bank of the United States consist in discounting\r\ncommercial paper with two names, in making advances upon public stock\r\nand other securities, and in trading in the precious metals. The\r\nBank of France discounts commercial paper with three names, or with\r\ntwo names and a deposit of Bank stock as collateral security. It is\r\nat present authorised to advance four-fifths on public stock on the\r\nsole guarantee of the depositor. It also makes advances on deposits\r\nof bullion and foreign coins, charging a commission of one eighth for\r\nforty-five days, or one per cent. a year. The commercial attributes of\r\nthe Bank of England are still more limited than those of the Bank of\r\nFrance. It makes no advances on public securities, except while the\r\ntransfer books are closed, which occurs for a certain period in London.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States discounts at the rate of six per cent.;\r\nthe Bank of France at four per cent.; and the Bank of England at\r\ndifferent rates, but rarely at less than four per cent., which is high\r\nin London. In 1836, the rate was advanced to four and a half and five\r\nper cent. The Bank of the United States effects foreign and domestic\r\nexchanges; the Bank of England only domestic exchange, which it does\r\nwithout charge for those who have an account open with it; and the Bank\r\nof France operates neither.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the Bank of the United States has varied within late\r\nyears from ten to twenty millions; in October 1835, it was twentyfive\r\nmillions, consisting chiefly of five and ten dollar notes. Of late\r\nyears the circulation of the Bank of England has amounted to about\r\n100 million dollars. Since 1830, the Bank of France has usually had a\r\ncirculation of forty millions, so that the two last institutions play\r\na more important part as banks of circulation, than the first. In the\r\nUnited States, the five or six hundred local banks, whose aggregate\r\ncirculation is five or six times greater than that of the United\r\nStates' Bank, perform this service. This coëxistence of more than five\r\nhundred distinct currencies is the great defect in the financial system\r\nof this country. The joint-stock banks, which have been of late much\r\nmultiplied in England, tend to introduce the same confusion into that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States has generally in its vaults about ten\r\nmillions in specie, but during the struggle with General Jackson, it\r\nhad, at times, a sum equal to its bills in circulation, or from sixteen\r\nto eighteen millions. The Bank of England endeavours to keep on hand\r\nfrom forty to fifty millions, but it sometime sinks as low as thirty.\r\nThe Bank of France always has at least twenty and sometimes more than\r\nforty millions; in 1832, it had fifty-three millions, or more than its\r\nwhole paper circulation.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States does not discount notes of above four\r\nmonths' date, although this restriction is voluntary; the great mass of\r\nits discounts is on paper of two months date. The Banks of France and\r\nEngland cannot discount bills of more than 90 days date.\r\n\r\nThe bills of the United States Bank circulate throughout the Union;\r\nthe revenue officers are obliged to receive them on the same footing\r\nas specie. The Bank, in return, is obliged to redeem them in specie\r\non demand, under penalty of paying interest on the sum demanded at\r\nthe rate of 12 per cent. per annum, and of forfeiting its charter. It\r\nis not, however, bound to redeem the bills of the branches, except\r\nat their respective counters, although it does so in fact. The bills\r\nof the Bank of England are a legal tender in England, and with the\r\nexception of those of the branches, are redeemable in gold and silver\r\nonly in London. The bills of the Bank of France are current only in\r\nParis, and are not there a legal tender.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States and the Bank of France only issue bills\r\npayable to bearer; the Bank of England has a certain amount of Bank\r\npost-bills, or bills payable to order at seven days sight, being\r\nequivalent to about one tenth or one twelfth of its whole circulation.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States receives deposits, on which it pays no\r\ninterest. The Scotch banks pay interest on deposits at the rate of 2 to\r\n2-1/2 per cent. The Banks of England and France do not pay interest on\r\ndeposits, but the latter gets bills on Paris cashed for its depositors\r\nwithout charge.\r\n\r\nThe number of accounts current opened by the Bank of the United States\r\nis indefinite; in that country and Scotland almost all persons have\r\nan account with the banks, and are thus freed from the necessity of\r\nkeeping any considerable sums on hand. They hardly keep enough in\r\nthe house to defray the expenses of the household for a few days,\r\nand payments are made by checks on a bank. The banks are, therefore,\r\nthe cashiers of the whole community. This concentration of the whole\r\ndisposable fund of the country in the banks, gives them the means of\r\nextending their operations greatly, and renders the capital, which\r\nwould otherwise be scattered about and lie idle, active and productive.\r\n\r\nThe dividends of the Bank of the United States have been regularly at\r\nthe rate of seven per cent.; those of the Bank of France vary from\r\neight to ten on the original capital; those of the Bank of England\r\nare at present eight per cent. on the nominal capital, which is\r\nthe original capital successively modified by acts of parliament.\r\nIndependently of the ordinary dividends, which were originally seven\r\nper cent., afterwards rose to ten, and are now eight, the Bank of\r\nEngland has made several extraordinary dividends, and it increased\r\nthe nominal capital on which the dividends are paid, twentyfive per\r\ncent. in 1816. Mr McCulloch makes the total sum of the extraordinary\r\ndividends and of the reserved profits carried to the extension of\r\nthe capital, from 1799 to 1832, eighty-two millions, which with the\r\nreimbursements required by the new charter, amounts to one hundred\r\nand five millions. The Bank of France has divided beyond its ordinary\r\ndividends, the sum of four and a half millions.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of the United States, previous to 1834, was charged with\r\nthe keeping of the public moneys, which were remitted to it by the\r\ncollectors and receivers and of which it was the legal depository,\r\nwith the transfer of funds for the service of the Treasury, and with\r\nthe payments on the public debt and of pensions. It is forbidden to\r\nlend more than 500,000 dollars to the Federal government, and more\r\nthan 50,000 to any State. In this respect it differs from the Banks\r\nof France and England, which make, and especially once made, enormous\r\nadvances to the state. This is the principal object of the Bank of\r\nEngland, the whole capital of which is lent to the government at the\r\nrate of three per cent. Besides this the Bank of England receives the\r\nExchequer Bills, and the Bank of France the Treasury Certificates\r\n(_bons du Tresor_), which bear a low rate of interest. These banks have\r\nmade inconceivable loans to the state in time of war; in 1814, the\r\nadvances of the Bank of England amounted to 165 millions, inclusive\r\nof the public deposits, which sometimes amounted to 60 millions.\r\nThe Bank of France, however, has at present little connexion with\r\nthe government, and has, therefore, greatly extended its commercial\r\noperations. In 1836, it had on hand notes to the value of 27 million\r\ndollars, without reckoning four millions advanced on deposits of public\r\nfunds; from 1830 to 1835 the amount had not exceeded seventeen millions.\r\n\r\nThe local or State banks in the United States are organized on\r\nprinciples analogous to those of the National Bank. They are\r\nincorporated companies, receiving their corporate privileges from the\r\nStates, and, therefore, confined to the limits of the State. Sometimes\r\ntheir bills are not current out of the town or county in which they\r\nare situated. They are institutions of credit and circulation almost\r\nexclusively for the use of merchants. Not having the resource of\r\nexchanges, and rarely having any deposits, they aim to enlarge their\r\nprofits, by extending their circulation through excessive discounts\r\nand loans, which often floods the country with an excess of paper\r\nmoney. Their capitals seldom exceed one million dollars, and are often\r\nmuch less; but several have lately been established in the South with\r\ncapitals of from three to ten millions.\r\n\r\nIn England the private bankers have the right of emitting bills payable\r\nto bearer, except, if there are less than six partners in the house,\r\nwithin the distance of sixty miles of London; in point of fact there\r\nare none issued within that space. The bills issued by private bankers\r\namount to about 8,500,000 pounds. In Paris, the Bank of France has the\r\nexclusive privilege of issuing bills payable to bearer.\r\n\r\nThe joint stock banks in England are not chartered companies, nor are\r\nthey under any control. All the partners are personally responsible.\r\nThese country banks are very numerous, and they offer, perhaps, less\r\nsecurity than the American State banks. In all times of crisis, in\r\n1792-93, 1814-15-16, 1825-26, many of them have become bankrupts or\r\nsuspended payment; in 1816, 240 were obliged to take one of these\r\nalternatives. In 1809 their issues amounted to 24 million pounds; in\r\n1821-23, they had fallen eight millions, and in 1825, had again risen\r\nto fourteen millions. Since the suppression of notes of less than\r\nfive pounds, they have been much reduced. At present (1836), these\r\ninstitutions are becoming multiplied to such a degree as to inspire\r\nserious alarm in prudent men.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 7--page 49.\r\n\r\n_Failures in the United States._\r\n\r\nIt would be excessively unjust to the Americans not to acknowledge that\r\nthey are improving daily in respect to failures. In a new country it is\r\nnatural that a failure should be little thought of, because every thing\r\nis necessarily an experiment, and all speculation is a game of hazard.\r\nThe public is very indulgent on this point, because it considers a\r\nfailure what it really is, nineteen times out of twenty, a misfortune\r\nand not a fraud. The bankrupt is looked upon as a wounded soldier, who\r\nis to be treated with sympathy, and not with contempt. Congress has\r\nthe power of passing a bankrupt law, but it has not yet exercised\r\nthis power, and the different States have made temporary provisions\r\nfor the case, which treat the insolvent debtor with great indulgence,\r\ndischarging him from any further obligation towards his creditors on\r\nhis giving up all his property for their benefit. It is felt that too\r\nmuch severity in regard to failures would have the tendency to check\r\nthe spirit of enterprise, which is the life of the country. None of\r\nthose rigourous provisions which disgrace French legislation and\r\nendanger the interests of creditors, exist here; and if the lenity of\r\nthe laws is sometimes abused, the inconvenience is much less than that\r\ncaused by the harshness of ours.\r\n\r\nIn the large maritime towns, however, it is felt, that if bankruptcy\r\nis not a disgrace, it is at least a private and public calamity, which\r\nis to be averted by every exertion. The history of the great fire in\r\nNew York in 1835 affords ample proof of this. The amount of the loss\r\nexceeded fifteen millions, and the insurance companies found themselves\r\nunable to meet their engagements. On the receipt of the news in Europe,\r\nthere was not a merchant who did not tremble for his American debts;\r\nfor in Europe, in general, and in France, in particular, such an\r\nevent would have deprived the sufferers of all credit, of all means\r\nof repairing their losses. In France the singular custom prevails\r\nof offering you credit, if you do not need it; but if you stand in\r\nwant of it, you will get none. In the United States, on the contrary,\r\nimmediately after this disaster, the President of the United States\r\nBank hastens to place two millions at the disposal of the New York\r\nmerchants, and the banks in general give out that they shall discount\r\nthe paper of the sufferers in preference.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sphere of the public authorities in the United States is\r\nvery narrow, the corporation of New York and the State government,\r\nrivalled each other in offers of assistance; the former offered an\r\nadvance of six millions, not to individuals, as was done in France in\r\n1830, but to the insurance companies, whose ruin would have led to a\r\ngeneral bankruptcy; it thus strengthened the hands of commerce, by\r\nrelieving its citadel. Even Congress, which is not allowed to take a\r\nstep out of its little district, and is scarcely permitted to notice\r\nwhat is going on beyond the Capitol, was moved, and extended the term\r\nof payment of custom dues. The result of this admirable co-operation\r\nof individuals, companies, and public authorities was to prevent any\r\nconsiderable failures.\r\n\r\nThe Americans have a courage in presence of commercial disasters, like\r\nthat of the soldier on the field of battle. In a critical juncture,\r\nthey face bankruptcy, as old grenadiers march upon a battery under a\r\nfire of grape-shot. If it is true that commerce is to supplant war in\r\nthe future, it must be confessed that the Americans are more advanced\r\non the march than we are; for they have applied all their energies and\r\nqualities to commerce, whilst we still devote ours to war. They have\r\ndiscovered a new sort of courage which produces and enriches; we shine\r\nonly by that courage which perishes or destroys.\r\n\r\nThe merit of this new spirit does not belong exclusively to the\r\nAmericans; they had the germ in their blood, and have received the\r\ngift from the mother country. At the period of the late calamity,\r\nthe English were no more subject to a panic terrour than their\r\nNew York descendants.--It is within my knowledge, that American\r\nmerchants established in Paris and having houses in the United States,\r\nhaving applied to London bankers for a continuation of credit, were\r\nimmediately assured, that not only the former amount of credit should\r\nbe continued, but that they should be allowed an unlimited credit in\r\norder to enable them to repair their losses. Some French bankers, on\r\nthe contrary, similarly situated, hastened to cut off the credit they\r\nhad previously given.\r\n\r\nIn a country organized for commerce, and having the proper institutions\r\nof credit, the money and merchandise of the merchant, are not his\r\nonly capital; the most valuable part of his capital consists of his\r\nexperience, his correspondents and connexions, the weight of his name.\r\nThis constitutes a moral capital, which conflagrations cannot destroy,\r\nnor accidents of any kind injure. In New York, by the aid of this\r\nmoral capital, on which a high value is set in commercial countries,\r\na merchant who has not property to the amount of more than 50,000\r\ndollars, operates as if he had five or six times as much. In Paris,\r\nthe same man, with the same fortune, would operate with only about\r\ntwice as much. Thus the wealth of the United States increases in a much\r\nfaster ratio than in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 8--page 54.\r\n\r\nThe American newspapers are very numerous, but in consequence of their\r\ngreat number their circulation is comparatively small. There are few\r\ndaily papers, whose circulation exceeds 2,000, and not one, which\r\nexceeds 4,000; that of most of the newspapers is not more than 400 or\r\n500. The American newspapers have little resemblance to the French and\r\nEnglish. They are chiefly mere advertising sheets; they do not direct\r\npublic opinion, they follow it. This local character does not allow\r\nof their having much influence out of their particular district. In\r\nNew York, only the city newspapers are read; in New Orleans, those\r\nof New Orleans are the only ones generally seen; whilst in France\r\nthose of Paris, and in England those of London are read every where.\r\nThe Globe and the National Intelligencer of Washington are, however,\r\npretty generally circulated. Newspapers in the United States are not\r\npowers, they are mere instruments of publicity within the reach of all.\r\nThey are consulted for the news, not for opinions. The profession of\r\na writer does not stand so high in England as in France, and is less\r\nhonourable in the United States, than in England. With the exception of\r\na very few newspapers, at the head of which are the New York American\r\nedited by Charles King, and the Philadelphia National Gazette, edited\r\nby Robert Walsh, the American press occupies a low rank in the social\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their large size, the American newspapers are\r\nlow-priced; the cause is plain enough; the profits are derived chiefly\r\nfrom advertisements, and the expenses of editing are inconsiderable,\r\nas there is generally but one editor. There is no stamp duty; but the\r\npostage on them is higher than in France.[EH] The circulation of some\r\nof the French newspapers exceeds 10,000; and some cheap publications\r\nhave lately had a circulation of 90,000 or 100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 9--page 53.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, the transfer of funds between different points of the Union,\r\nor between the Union and foreign countries, effected by the Bank of the\r\nUnited States, amounted to 255 millions, of which 241,718,710 was for\r\ndomestic, and 13,456,737 for foreign transactions. The Bank received\r\nonly 217,249 dollars for commissions on this vast sum.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 10--page 64.\r\n\r\n_Specie and Paper Money._\r\n\r\nThe quantity of gold and silver coined in France with the new die,\r\namounted, up to 1836, to about 750 million dollars, of which three\r\nfourths were in silver. It is not probable that more than one fourth of\r\nthat sum has been melted and exported; there would then remain about\r\n550 millions. A part of this immense sum is out of circulation, and is\r\nburied in the coffers of individuals or in the pockets of the poor, who\r\ndo not dare trust their savings to any person or institution.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, in 1834, the 405 local banks from which official\r\nor semi-official statements had been received, had 65 million dollars\r\npaper in circulation, and 14,250,000 dollars in specie in their\r\nvaults. There were beside, 101 banks, estimated to have in circulation\r\n12,650,000 dollars of paper, and 2,825,000 dollars in specie on hand.\r\nThe Bank of the United States had at that time a circulation of\r\n10,300,000 dollars, and specie to the amount of 13,865,000 dollars. The\r\nwhole currency of the United States, exclusive of the small amount of\r\nspecie in the hands of individuals, amounted, therefore, to 88 millions\r\nin paper and specie. At this time, the banks had withdrawn a large\r\namount of their bills from circulation, their issues before the war\r\non the Bank having exceeded 100 millions. Since 1834, the amount of\r\nspecie in the United States has been considerably increased, several of\r\nthe States having prohibited the emission of bills of less than five\r\ndollars, a measure, which would tend to promote the use of the metals.\r\n\r\nThe following statement, showing the quantity of paper money in\r\ncirculation in the United Kingdom at the end of 1833, is chiefly from\r\nMcCulloch's Dictionary of Commerce.\r\n\r\n  Of Bank of England          £19,500,000\r\n  Of Branches of do.            3,300,000\r\n  Of Private Bankers            8,500,000\r\n  Of English Country Banks      1,500,000[EI]\r\n  Of Scotch Banks               2,000,000\r\n  Of Irish Banks                7,500,000\r\n                              -----------\r\n                Total          42,300,000\r\n\r\nAt the same time the amount of the precious metals in circulation\r\nand in the banks, was estimated at 45,800,000 pounds, of which seven\r\nmillions were in silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 11[EJ]--page 96. _Cherokees and other Indians._ Omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 12[EJ]--page 98. _Public Lands._ Omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 13[EJ]--page 119. _Temperance Societies._ Omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 14--page 132.\r\n\r\n_Cotton Manufacture._\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1836, the Lowell cotton factories comprised\r\n\r\n129,828 spindles and 4,197 looms, and employed 6,793 operatives of\r\nwhom 5,416 were women. The quantity of cloth made was 849,300 yards a\r\nweek, or at the rate of 44 million yards a year; raw cotton consumed\r\n38,000 bales, or 15 million pounds yearly.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, the American manufacture employed 62,157 operatives, of\r\nwhom 38,927 were women and 4,691 children. There were beside 4,760\r\nhand-weavers, 40,709 persons employed in accessory labours, making the\r\nwhole number of persons engaged directly and indirectly 117,626. The\r\nfactories contained 1,246,503 spindles, and 33,506 looms, and produced\r\n230,461,990 yards of stuffs, besides 1,200,000 pounds of yarn, which\r\nwere woven in families during the winter. The consumption of raw\r\ncotton was 77 million pounds. The value of the products was 26 million\r\ndollars, eleven millions of which were paid in wages. (_Pitkin's\r\nStatistics_, 526.)\r\n\r\nThere were in England, in 1834, according to Baines, (_History of\r\nCotton Manufacture_,) 100,000 power-looms, and 250,000 hand-looms. The\r\ndifference between the number of the hand-looms in England and the\r\nUnited States deserves to be noticed. The hand-weavers in Great Britain\r\nform one of the most wretched classes of the population. The English\r\nfactories employed 729,000 persons, or with the dyers, bleachers,\r\nmeasurers, folders, packers, &c., and all hands employed in building\r\nand repairing the mills, 1,500,000, In 1833 the English factories\r\nconsumed 332 million pounds of cotton. The value of their annual\r\nproducts is estimated at from 30 to 34 million pounds sterling; the\r\nwages of the 724,000 operatives amount to 13 millions.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, the French manufacture employed 600,000 persons, and the\r\nannual value of its products was about 110 million dollars; quantity of\r\ncotton consumed 100 million pounds. If these statements are correct,\r\nit follows, that our operatives produce less than the English or\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 15--page 186.\r\n\r\n_Production and Consumption of Cotton._\r\n\r\nIn 1834, one of our most able manufacturers, M. Koekhlin, made the\r\nfollowing estimate of the production and consumption of cotton\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\n            _Production._\r\n\r\n  In the United States             437,500,000 lbs.\r\n  In India                          75,000,000\r\n  In Brasil                         30,000,000\r\n  In Bourbon, Cayenne, &c.           7,500,000\r\n  In Egypt and the Levant           25,000,000\r\n                                   -----------\r\n                   Total,          575,000,000\r\n\r\n            _Consumption._\r\n\r\n  In England                       375,000,000 lbs.\r\n  In France                        100,000,000\r\n  In the United States              45,000,000\r\n  In China                          37,500,000\r\n  In Switzerland, Belgium, &c.      42,500,000\r\n                                   -----------\r\n                   Total,           600,000,000\r\n\r\nSeveral other countries not enumerated above yield cotton. China\r\nproduces some which she consumes, or exports under the form of\r\nnankeens; Mexico produces nearly enough for her own consumption;\r\nMr Koekhlin has meant to speak only of what belongs to the general\r\ncommerce. He has somewhat overstated the consumption of England, and\r\nunderrates that of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 16--page 154--_omitted._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 17--page 161.\r\n\r\n_Trial of the Incendiaries for burning the Ursuline Convent._\r\n\r\nThe intolerant spirit of a part of the Protestant population was\r\noffended by the sight of the Ursuline Convent on Mount St. Bendict,\r\nwithin the limits of Charlestown, a town adjoining Boston. The sisters\r\ndevoted themselves to the instruction of young girls, and many\r\nProtestant families had confided daughters to their care. Every thing\r\nproves that they were by no means devoured by a spirit of proselytism.\r\nIn the beginning of August, 1835, a report got about in Charlestown,\r\nthat one of the sisters, a young woman, was detained in the convent\r\nby force. The Selectmen of the town had a meeting, five of them went\r\nto the convent, which they examined from cellar to garret, had an\r\ninterview with the sister who was represented as a victim of the\r\nCatholic discipline, and became satisfied that she was there of her\r\nown free will. This conviction was made known to the public. But on\r\nthe night of August 12th, the convent was surrounded and attacked by\r\na handful of ruffians, at the head of whom was one John Buzzell, a\r\nbrickmaker, noted for his brutal character. The sisters were driven\r\nfrom the convent with violence; every thing was plundered; the tombs of\r\nthe dead were forced open. The building was then fired; it was burnt in\r\nsight of the Selectmen; the Boston firemen hastened to the spot, but\r\nwere repulsed by the populace by main force.\r\n\r\nSeveral men, taken in the act, were arrested, and among others Buzzell;\r\nthey were tried in Boston in 1835.[EK] The witnesses were afraid to\r\nbear testimony, a mysterious influence had changed their language; the\r\npublic prosecutor, who had previously demanded in vain a postponement\r\nof the trial, until the causes which instigated the violence had been\r\ntraced, pleaded the cause of order with a generous indignation. All the\r\nprisoners were acquitted, except one poor youth of the name of Marcy\r\nwho was sentenced to fifteen or twenty years imprisonment; but public\r\nopinion soon after obliged the Executive to grant him a pardon. Buzzell\r\nand Kelly, one of his accomplices, became heroes; they were carried\r\nabout in triumph, and a subscription was made for their benefit. The\r\nsisters petitioned the Massachusetts legislature for indemnity; the\r\nmost intelligent citizens of Boston interested themselves in their\r\nfavour, but the House of Representatives rejected the petition by a\r\nlarge majority. On the anniversary of the outrage, the populace of\r\nCharlestown celebrated it as a day of rejoicing, and got up a shooting\r\nmatch, the target being a representation of the lady superior of the\r\nconvent. The Selectmen succeeded in suppressing the figure, but not\r\nthe procession. Finally, to crown these deeds of impudence and savage\r\nviolence, two of the incendiaries, in 1836, presented a petition to\r\nthe legislature to be indemnified for the damages they had suffered by\r\nthe trial. The committee to whom the petition was referred, reported\r\na grant of 500 dollars to each of these wretches; but to the honor of\r\nMassachusetts, their report was rejected on the second reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 18--page 172. _Omitted._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 19--page 180. _Omitted._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 20--page 193.\r\n\r\n_Taxation._\r\n\r\nIt has repeatedly been made a question of late, whether the United\r\nStates were more or less heavily taxed than France. The subject may\r\nbe considered under several points of view. The systems of Taxation\r\nin the two countries are very different. The taxes in the United\r\nStates are less numerous than they are in France, and are differently\r\ndistributed. The country population, that is the great majority, pay\r\nmuch less in the United States than in France; but in the large towns\r\nthe inhabitants pay nearly as much as with us, except in Paris. The\r\ndisproportion between the two countries becomes much greater, if\r\ninstead of estimating the amount in money, we give it in day's labour,\r\nwhich is the most rational manner. The day-wages of a labourer being\r\nabout threefold as much in the United States as they are with us, and\r\nother things being in the same proportion, it follows, that, in the\r\nformer, a tax of three dollars to three dollars and a half, which\r\nis about the general average, is not more burdensome to the mass of\r\nthe people, than a tax of one third that sum would be in France.\r\nThe average tax in France, or six dollars a head, is equivalent to\r\ntwentysix days' work in our country; while the average in the United\r\nStates is only equivalent to four days' work in that country.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that, amongst us, all the public expenditures are comprised\r\nin the budget; all our taxes amount to 190 million dollars. But in the\r\nUnited States, there are various expenses supported by individuals and\r\ncompanies, which do not appear in the sum of the public taxes. Toll is\r\npaid on a very large number of roads: public worship is maintained at\r\nthe expense of the worshippers; hence heavy charges on the rich.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remark, that the public revenue in the United\r\nStates is almost wholly employed in a productive manner, in useful\r\nundertakings, in public works, schools, and various kinds of\r\nimprovements. There is no Federal debt, that of most of the States\r\nand towns is inconsiderable, there are no retiring pensions, and the\r\narmy is small; whilst more than half of our budget, or 118 million\r\ndollars, is devoted to the charges on the public debt, pensions, and\r\nthe sea and land forces, we cannot expect to restore the balance in our\r\nfavour, because we cannot dismiss our soldiers, nor declare a national\r\nbankruptcy; but we might diminish our present inferiority (paradoxical\r\nas it may seem), by adding some millions to our budget for useful and\r\nproductive works.\r\n\r\nThe military service itself is a public burden and a very heavy one;\r\nbut it is difficult to rate the amount of this in money. In France it\r\ntakes one man out of eighty inhabitants from labour, but in the United\r\nStates only one out of 2,300. This tax might be lightened, by employing\r\nthe army in public works.\r\n\r\nWe may also notice the two following differences, which appear to me\r\nessential ones, between American and French taxes:--\r\n\r\n1. The American taxes, whether it be from the mode of their assessment,\r\nor from the difference of conditions of the two countries, never press\r\nheavily upon the taxables nor give them any uneasiness; they never\r\nembarrass transactions nor interrupt business. On the contrary, amongst\r\nus the tax is often an oppressive burden; our registry dues, and excise\r\non property changing hands, often occasion serious embarrassments and\r\neven insurmountable obstacles in the way of enterprise.\r\n\r\n2. In the United States the treasury fears to incur the public odium;\r\namongst us the most respectable citizens are subjected to the most\r\nvexatious treatment; our officers of the customs have adopted practices\r\nunworthy of a civilised people; our wives and daughters must submit to\r\nbe searched in the most shameless manner by vile hags, and these brutal\r\nproceedings have not the poor excuse of being useful to the customs.\r\nTheir avowed object is to prevent the smuggling of articles, with\r\nwhich, in spite of three lines of custom-house officers, the country\r\nis inundated, and which it is well known are brought in by dogs[EL] on\r\na large scale, and not in the pockets of private persons. The branches\r\nof industry, which they are designed to protect, are altogether of\r\nsecondary importance, and cannot be weighed in the balance against\r\npublic decency.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 21--page 11.\r\n\r\n_Construction and Cost of Steamboats in the West._\r\n\r\nThe western steamboats are on the high pressure principle, with a force\r\nof six or eight atmospheres. The boilers are on deck, in the bow of\r\nthe boat; the cylinder is horizontal; there are two wheels, one on\r\neach side. Formerly, a single stern wheel was generally used. Only one\r\nengine is used to a boat. The pistons are not of metal, an arrangement\r\nwhich necessarily involves a great loss of power, but which renders\r\nrepairs more easy, an important consideration with inexperienced\r\nengineers. The engines are of very simple construction and cost little;\r\nthose for the largest boats cost from 10,000 to 14,000 dollars; the\r\nengines of the French government packets in the Mediterranean cost\r\nnearly 60,000 dollars. The cylinders of the most powerful engines in\r\nthe western boats are of 30 inches diameter, and seven feet stroke.\r\nThese boats consume enormous quantities of wood; the larger ones\r\nburning from one and a half to one and three quarters cords an hour;\r\nthe rate of speed rarely exceeds ten miles an hour even down stream.\r\n\r\nIn the east a good steamer from 175 to 200 feet in length with copper\r\nboilers, which are necessary to resist the action of salt water, costs\r\nfrom 70,000 to 80,000 dollars, including the furniture. The carpenter's\r\nwork of the hull costs about thirty dollars a ton, exclusive of the\r\niron. The engine, when there is but one, costs from 12,000 to 15,000\r\ndollars, exclusive of the boilers. The North America cost 100,000\r\ndollars; a good boat, well taken care of, lasts about twelve or fifteen\r\nyears in the east. The eastern boats are very fast and safe, and of\r\nlate years, great improvements have been made in their construction,\r\nprincipally by Mr Stevens of New York. They move at the rate of\r\nfifteen miles an hour in still water, and generally carry nothing but\r\npassengers. Their usual length is from 180 to 200 feet, with a breadth\r\nof twentyfour or twentysix, without including the paddle-boxes; their\r\nusual draught of water about four or five feet in the rivers, and from\r\nsix and a half to nine feet in the bays and seas. Their engines are\r\non the low or mean pressure principle; the cylinder is vertical, and\r\nthey often have two engines; the stroke of the piston has been carried\r\nto ten or eleven feet; the diameter of the cylinders, in some of the\r\nboats, is five feet four inches. They consume from twentyfive to thirty\r\ncords of wood an hour.\r\n\r\nThe number of steamboats in the United States, at the end of 1834, was\r\n386 of an aggregate of 95,648 tons, of which 237, with a tonnage of\r\n64,347 tons, were on the western waters. [In 1839 the number of boats\r\nwas about 800, with an aggregate tonnage of 157,473 tons; of these\r\nabout 300 were on the western rivers and 70 on the lakes.--TRANSL.]\r\nThere were in France, in 1834, 82 steamboats, with a total tonnage of\r\nnot more than 15,000 tons, beside 37 belonging to the government. The\r\nwhole number of steamers in England is about 480.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 22--page 268.\r\n\r\n_Summary Statements of the Public Works in the United States._\r\n\r\nThe six tables which follow present a recapitulation of the statements\r\ngiven in Letter XXI., with the cost per league in francs. [Many of\r\nthe statements in the Letter are slightly varied from the original,\r\nin conformity with official reports, and the cost and distances have\r\nthere been reduced to English measures and Federal money. In these\r\ntables the author's statements are given without change because\r\nsufficient materials for a total recasting of them are not accessible\r\nto the translator.

If we take into account a number of important works,\r\nwhich have been undertaken in the last part of 1835 and the beginning\r\nof 1836, it will be necessary to add 900 leagues and 300 million francs\r\nto the above totals, making an aggregate of 3,050 leagues (7,625 miles)\r\nand 960 million francs (180 million dollars). I do not include the\r\nNashville and New Orleans and the Charleston and Cincinnati railroads,\r\nwhich, however, will probably be executed before long, and with their\r\nbranches will make an addition of more than 500 leagues. The Americans\r\nhave already surpassed in the extent of their works, and the rapidity\r\nof execution, the most active and wealthy European nations. Almost all\r\nthe works above enumerated have been executed in fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a summary view of similar works in Europe:\r\n\r\n  _Countries._            _Canals._            _Railroads._\r\n\r\n  England                 1,100 leagues.       313 leagues.\r\n  France                    998                 50\r\n  Belgium                   115                 74\r\n  Other States              400                 50\r\n                          -----                ---\r\n      Totals              2,613                487\r\n                          \\_________  ___________/\r\n                                    \\/\r\n  General Total of Europe         3,100\r\n         \"         United States  3,050\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE 23--page 281.\r\n\r\n_Geological Surveys._\r\n\r\nThe legislatures of several States have lately shown a laudable zeal\r\nfor geological examinations of the soil. Maryland has a State geologist\r\n(Mr Duchatel) who is engaged in preparing a geological map of the\r\nState, particularly with reference to economical purposes. Dr Duchatel\r\nhas already made some important discoveries in agricultural geology,\r\nespecially in respect to the use of marl. Tennessee has also its\r\ngeologist, Dr Troost. Massachusetts has a geological map prepared by\r\nProfessor Hitchcock. Congress has caused some examinations to be made\r\non the upper Mississippi. Dr Jackson has been several years employed\r\nin making geological surveys in Maine, and is at present occupied in\r\nRhode Island; he has also been appointed by New Hampshire to explore\r\nthe geology of her mountains and valleys. New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nNew Jersey, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Connecticut, Kentucky, Michigan\r\nand Georgia, have also engaged in the same enterprise, and partial\r\nexaminations have been made in North Carolina. New York has in addition\r\nto a corps of four geologists, Messrs Vanuxem, Mather, Emmons and\r\nConrad, a chemist (Dr Beck,) a botanist (Mr Torrey,) and a zoologist,\r\n(Dr DeKay.) It is principally to the efforts of the late Secretary\r\nof the State, General Dix, that New York is indebted for this great\r\nundertaking. Massachusetts has also organised a board of naturalists,\r\nto report upon the different branches of botany and zoology. In many\r\nof the States, a topographical survey more or less minute, has been\r\nconnected with the geological explorations. Massachusetts has been\r\ntrigonometrically surveyed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[EG] In a later work (_Statistics of the British Empire_, 1839), Mr\r\nMcCulloch estimates it at 26,188,000 tons.--TRANSL.\r\n\r\n[EH] The postage of newspapers in France is two fifths of a cent within\r\nthe department where it is published, and four fifths on any distance\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\n[EI] In August 1836, this had been increased to 3,600,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n[EJ] These notes, with several others, have been omitted, as they\r\ncontain merely statements familiar to most readers in this country.\r\n\r\n[EK] The author is mistaken; they were tried in the county in which the\r\noffence was committed.
