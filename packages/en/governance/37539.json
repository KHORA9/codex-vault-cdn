  "content": "THE INTERNATIONAL JEW\r\n\r\nThe World's Foremost Problem\r\n\r\nBeing a Reprint of a Series of Articles Appearing in The Dearborn\r\nIndependent from May 22 to October 2, 1920\r\n\r\nNovember, 1920\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy discuss the Jewish Question? Because it is here, and because its\r\nemergence into American thought should contribute to its solution, and\r\nnot to a continuance of those bad conditions which surround the Question\r\nin other countries.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Question has existed in the United States for a long time.\r\nJews themselves have known this, even if Gentiles have not. There have\r\nbeen periods in our own country when it has broken forth with a sullen\r\nsort of strength which presaged darker things to come. Many signs\r\nportend that it is approaching an acute stage.\r\n\r\nNot only does the Jewish Question touch those matters that are of common\r\nknowledge, such as financial and commercial control, usurpation of\r\npolitical power, monopoly of necessities, and autocratic direction of\r\nthe very news that the American people read; but it reaches into\r\ncultural regions and so touches the very heart of American life.\r\n\r\nThis question reaches down into South America and threatens to become an\r\nimportant factor in Pan-American relations. It is interwoven with much\r\nof the menace of organized and calculated disorder which troubles the\r\nnations today. It is not of recent growth, but its roots go deep, and\r\nthe long Past of this Problem is counterbalanced by prophetic hopes and\r\nprograms which involve a very deliberate and creative view of the\r\nFuture.\r\n\r\nThis little book is the partial record of an investigation of the Jewish\r\nQuestion. It is printed to enable interested readers to inform\r\nthemselves on the data published in The Dearborn Independent prior to\r\nOct. 1, 1920. The demand for back copies of the paper was so great that\r\nthe supply was exhausted early, as was also a large edition of a booklet\r\ncontaining the first nine articles of the series. The investigation\r\nstill proceeds, and the articles will continue to appear as heretofore\r\nuntil the work is done.\r\n\r\nThe motive of this work is simply a desire to make facts known to the\r\npeople. Other motives have, of course, been ascribed to it. But the\r\nmotive of prejudice or any form of antagonism is hardly strong enough to\r\nsupport such an investigation as this. Moreover, had an unworthy motive\r\nexisted, some sign of it would inevitably appear in the work itself. We\r\nconfidently call the reader to witness that the tone of these articles\r\nis all that it should be. The International Jew and his satellites, as\r\nthe conscious enemies of all that Anglo-Saxons mean by civilization, are\r\nnot spared, nor is that unthinking mass which defends anything that a\r\nJew does, simply because it has been taught to believe that what Jewish\r\nleaders do is Jewish. Neither do these articles proceed upon a false\r\nemotion of brotherhood and apology, as if this stream of doubtful\r\ntendency in the world were only accidentally Jewish. We give the facts\r\nas we find them; that of itself is sufficient protection against\r\nprejudice or passion.\r\n\r\nThis volume does not complete the case by any means. But it brings the\r\nreader along one step. In future compilations of these and subsequent\r\narticles the entire scope of the inquiry will more clearly appear.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

His emergence in the financial, political and social spheres has\r\nbeen so complete and spectacular since the war, that his place, power\r\nand purpose in the world are being given a new scrutiny, much of it\r\nunfriendly. Persecution is not a new experience to the Jew, but\r\nintensive scrutiny of his nature and super-nationality is. He has\r\nsuffered for more than 2,000 years from what may be called the\r\ninstinctive anti-Semitism of the other races, but this antagonism has\r\nnever been intelligent nor has it been able to make itself intelligible.\r\nNowadays, however, the Jew is being placed, as it were, under the\r\nmicroscope of economic observation that the reasons for his power, the\r\nreasons for his separateness, the reasons for his suffering may be\r\ndefined and understood.\r\n\r\nIn Russia he is charged with being the source of Bolshevism, an\r\naccusation which is serious or not according to the circle in which it\r\nis made; we in America, hearing the fervid eloquence and perceiving the\r\nprophetic ardor of young Jewish apostles of social and industrial\r\nreform, can calmly estimate how it may be. In Germany he is charged with\r\nbeing the cause of the Empire's collapse and a very considerable\r\nliterature has sprung up, bearing with it a mass of circumstantial\r\nevidence that gives the thinker pause. In England he is charged with\r\nbeing the real world ruler, who rules as a super-nation over the\r\nnations, rules by the power of gold, and who plays nation against nation\r\nfor his own purposes, remaining himself discreetly in the background. In\r\nAmerica it is pointed out to what extent the elder Jews of wealth\r\nand the younger Jews of ambition swarmed through the war\r\norganizations--principally those departments which dealt with the\r\ncommercial and industrial business of war, and also the extent to which\r\nthey have clung to the advantage which their experience as agents of the\r\ngovernment gave them.\r\n\r\nIn simple words, the question of the Jews has come to the fore, but like\r\nother questions which lend themselves to prejudice, efforts will be made\r\nto hush it up as impolitic for open discussion. If, however, experience\r\nhas taught us anything it is that questions thus suppressed will sooner\r\nor later break out in undesirable and unprofitable forms.\r\n\r\nThe Jew is the world's enigma. Poor in his masses, he yet controls the\r\nworld's finances. Scattered abroad without country or government, he yet\r\npresents a unity of race continuity which no other people has achieved.\r\nLiving under legal disabilities in almost every land, he has become the\r\npower behind many a throne. There are ancient prophecies to the effect\r\nthat the Jew will return to his own land and from that center rule the\r\nworld, though not until he has undergone an assault by the united\r\nnations of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe single description which will include a larger percentage of Jews\r\nthan members of any other race is this: he is in business. It may be\r\nonly gathering rags and selling them, but he is in business. From the\r\nsale of old clothes to the control of international trade and finance,\r\nthe Jew is supremely gifted for business. More than any other race he\r\nexhibits a decided aversion to industrial employment, which he balances\r\nby an equally decided adaptability to trade. The Gentile boy works his\r\nway up, taking employment in the productive or technical departments;\r\nbut the Jewish boy prefers to begin as messenger, salesman or\r\nclerk--anything--so long as it is connected with the commercial side of\r\nthe business. An early Prussian census illustrates this characteristic:\r\nof a total population of 269,400, the Jews comprised six per cent or\r\n16,164. Of these, 12,000 were traders and 4,164 were workmen. Of the\r\nGentile population, the other 94 per cent, or 153,236 people, there were\r\nonly 17,000 traders.\r\n\r\nA modern census would show a large professional and literary class added\r\nto the traders, but no diminution of the percentage of traders and not\r\nmuch if any increase in the number of wage toilers. In America alone\r\nmost of the big business, the trusts and the banks, the natural\r\nresources and the chief agricultural products, especially tobacco,\r\ncotton and sugar, are in the control of Jewish financiers or their\r\nagents. Jewish journalists are a large and powerful group here. \"Large\r\nnumbers of department stores are held by Jewish firms,\" says the Jewish\r\nEncyclopedia, and many if not most of them are run under Gentile names.\r\nJews are the largest and most numerous landlords of residence property\r\nin the country. They are supreme in the theatrical world. They\r\nabsolutely control the circulation of publications throughout the\r\ncountry. Fewer than any race whose presence among us is noticeable, they\r\nreceive daily an amount of favorable publicity which would be impossible\r\ndid they not have the facilities for creating and distributing it\r\nthemselves. Werner Sombart, in his \"Jew and Modern Capitalism\" says, \"If\r\nthe conditions in America continue to develop along the same lines as in\r\nthe last generation, if the immigration statistics and the proportion of\r\nbirths among all the nationalities remain the same, our imagination may\r\npicture the United States of fifty or a hundred years hence as a land\r\ninhabited only by Slavs, Negroes and Jews, wherein the Jews will\r\nnaturally occupy the position of economic leadership.\" Sombart is a\r\npro-Jewish writer.\r\n\r\nThe question is, If the Jew is in control, how did it happen? This is a\r\nfree country. The Jew comprises only about three per cent of the\r\npopulation; to every Jew there are 97 Gentiles; to the 3,000,000 Jews in\r\nthe United States there are 97,000,000 Gentiles. If the Jew is in\r\ncontrol, is it because of his superior ability, or is it because of the\r\ninferiority and don't-care attitude of the Gentiles?\r\n\r\nIt would be very simple to answer that the Jews came to America, took\r\ntheir chances like other people and proved more successful in the\r\ncompetitive struggle. But that would not include all the facts. And\r\nbefore a more adequate answer can be given, two points should be made\r\nclear. This first is this: all Jews are not rich controllers of wealth.\r\nThere are poor Jews aplenty, though most of them even in their poverty\r\nare their own masters. While it may be true that the chief financial\r\ncontrollers of the country are Jews, it is not true that every Jew is\r\none of the financial controllers of the country. The classes must be\r\nkept distinct for a reason which will appear when the methods of the\r\nrich Jews and the methods of the poor Jews to gain power are\r\ndifferentiated. Secondly, the fact of Jewish solidarity renders it\r\ndifficult to measure Gentile and Jewish achievements by the same\r\nstandard. When a great block of wealth in America was made possible by\r\nthe lavish use of another block of wealth from across the seas; that is\r\nto say, when certain Jewish immigrants came to the United States with\r\nthe financial backing of European Jewry behind them, it would be unfair\r\nto explain the rise of that class of immigration by the same rules which\r\naccount for the rise of, say, the Germans or the Poles who came here\r\nwith no resource but their ambition and strength. To be sure, many\r\nindividual Jews come in that way, too, with no dependence but\r\nthemselves, but it would not be true to say that the massive control of\r\naffairs which is exercised by Jewish wealth was won by individual\r\ninitiative; it was rather the extension of financial control across the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThat, indeed, is where any explanation of Jewish control must begin.\r\nHere is a race whose entire period of national history saw them peasants\r\non the land, whose ancient genius was spiritual rather than material,\r\nbucolic rather than commercial, yet today, when they have no country, no\r\ngovernment, and are persecuted in one way or another everywhere they go,\r\nthey are declared to be the principal though unofficial rulers of the\r\nearth. How does so strange a charge arise, and why do so many\r\ncircumstances seem to justify it?\r\n\r\nBegin at the beginning. During the formative period of their national\r\ncharacter the Jews lived under a law which made plutocracy and pauperism\r\nequally impossible among them. Modern reformers who are constructing\r\nmodel social systems on paper would do well to look into the social\r\nsystem under which the early Jews were organized. The Law of Moses made\r\na \"money aristocracy,\" such as Jewish financiers form today, impossible\r\nbecause it forbade the taking of interest. It made impossible also the\r\ncontinuous enjoyment of profit wrung out of another's distress.\r\nProfiteering and sheer speculation were not favored under the Jewish\r\nsystem. There could be no land-hogging; the land was apportioned among\r\nthe people, and though it might be lost by debt or sold under stress, it\r\nwas returned every 50 years to its original family ownership, at which\r\ntime, called \"The Year of Jubilee,\" there was practically a new social\r\nbeginning. The rise of great landlords and a moneyed class was\r\nimpossible under such a system, although the interim of 50 years gave\r\nample scope for individual initiative to assert itself under fair\r\ncompetitive conditions.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the Jews had retained their status as a nation, and had\r\nremained in Palestine under the Law of Moses, they would hardly have\r\nachieved the financial distinction which they have since won. Jews never\r\ngot rich out of one another. Even in modern times they have not become\r\nrich out of each other but out of the nations among whom they dwelt.\r\nJewish law permitted the Jew to do business with a Gentile on a\r\ndifferent basis than that on which he did business with a brother Jew.\r\nWhat is called \"the Law of the Stranger\" was defined thus: \"unto a\r\nstranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt\r\nnot lend upon usury.\"\r\n\r\nBeing dispersed among the nations, but never merging themselves with the\r\nnations and never losing a very distinctive identity, the Jew has had\r\nthe opportunity to practice \"the ethics of the stranger\" for many\r\ncenturies. Being strangers among strangers, and often among cruelly\r\nhostile strangers, they have found this law a compensating advantage.\r\nStill, this alone would not account for the Jew's preeminence in\r\nfinance. The explanation of that must be sought in the Jew himself, his\r\nvigor, resourcefulness and special proclivities.\r\n\r\nVery early in the Jewish story we discover the tendency of Israel to be\r\na master nation, with other nations as its vassals. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the whole prophetic purpose with reference to Israel seems to\r\nhave been the moral enlightenment of the world through its agency,\r\nIsrael's \"will to mastery\" apparently hindered that purpose. At least\r\nsuch would seem to be the tone of the Old Testament. Divinely ordered to\r\ndrive out the Canaanites that their corrupt ideas might not contaminate\r\nIsrael, the Jews did not obey, according to the old record. They looked\r\nover the Canaanitish people and perceived what great amount of man-power\r\nwould be wasted if they were expelled, and so Israel enslaved them--\"And\r\nit came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to\r\ntribute, and did not utterly drive them out.\" It was this form of\r\ndisobedience, this preference of material mastery over spiritual\r\nleadership, that marked the beginning of Israel's age-long disciplinary\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nThe Jews' dispersion among the nations temporarily (that is, for more\r\nthan 25 centuries now) changed the program which their scriptures\r\ndeclare was divinely planned, and that dispersion continues until today.\r\nThere are spiritual leaders in modern Judaism who still claim that\r\nIsrael's mission to the nations is spiritual, but their assertions that\r\nIsrael is today fulfilling that mission are not as convincing as they\r\nmight be if accompanied by more evidence. Israel throughout the modern\r\ncenturies is still looking at the Gentile world and estimating what its\r\nman-power can be made to yield. But the discipline upon Israel still\r\nholds; he is an exile from his own land, condemned to be discriminated\r\nagainst wherever he goes, until the time when exile and homelessness\r\nshall end in a re-established Palestine, and Jerusalem again the moral\r\ncenter of the earth, even as the elder prophets have declared.\r\n\r\nHad the Jew become an employe, a worker for other men, his dispersion\r\nwould not probably have been so wide. But becoming a trader, his\r\ninstincts drew him round the habitable earth. There were Jews in China\r\nat an early date. They appeared as traders in England at the time of the\r\nSaxons. Jewish traders were in South America 100 years before the\r\nPilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth Rock. Jews established the sugar\r\nindustry in the Island of St. Thomas in 1492. They were well established\r\nin Brazil when only a few villages dotted the eastern coast of what is\r\nnow the United States. And how far they penetrated when once they came\r\nhere is indicated by the fact that the first white child born in Georgia\r\nwas a Jew--Isaac Minis. The Jew's presence round the earth, his\r\nclannishness with his own people, made him a nation scattered among the\r\nnations, a corporation with agents everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnother talent, however, contributed greatly to his rise in financial\r\npower--his ability to invent new devices for doing business. Until the\r\nJew was pitted against the world, business was very crudely done. And\r\nwhen we trace the origins of many of the business methods which simplify\r\nand facilitate trade today, more likely than not we find a Jewish name\r\nat the end of the clue. Many of the indispensable instruments of credit\r\nand exchange were thought out by Jewish merchants, not only for use\r\nbetween themselves, but to check and hold the Gentiles with whom they\r\ndealt. The oldest bill of exchange extant was drawn by a Jew--one Simon\r\nRubens. The promissory note was a Jewish invention, as was also the\r\ncheck \"payable to bearer.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting bit of history attaches to the \"payable to bearer\"\r\ninstrument. The Jews' enemies were always stripping them of their last\r\nounce of wealth, yet strangely, the Jews recovered very quickly and were\r\nsoon rich again. How this sudden recovery from looting and poverty?\r\nTheir assets were concealed under \"bearer\" and so a goodly portion was\r\nalways saved. In an age when it was lawful for any pirate to seize goods\r\nconsigned to Jews, the Jews were able to protect themselves by\r\nconsigning goods on policies that bore no names.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Jew was to center business around goods instead of\r\npersons. Previously all claims had been against persons; the Jew knew\r\nthat the goods were more reliable than the persons with whom he dealt,\r\nand so he contrived to have claims laid against goods. Besides, this\r\ndevice enabled him to keep himself out of sight as much as possible.\r\nThis introduced an element of hardness into business, inasmuch as it was\r\ngoods which were being dealt in rather than men being dealt with, and\r\nthis hardness remains. Another tendency which survives and which is of\r\nadvantage in veiling the very large control which Jews have attained, is\r\nof the same origin as \"bearer\" bills; it permits a business dominated by\r\nJewish capital to appear under a name that gives no hint of Jewish\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nThe Jew is the only and original international capitalist, but as a rule\r\nhe prefers not to emblazon that fact upon the skies; he prefers to use\r\nGentile banks and trust companies as his agents and instruments. The\r\nsuggestive term \"Gentile front\" often appears in connection with this\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the stock exchange is also credited to Jewish financial\r\ntalent. In Berlin, Paris, London, Frankfort and Hamburg, Jews were in\r\ncontrol of the first stock exchanges, while Venice and Genoa were openly\r\nreferred to in the talk of the day as \"Jew cities\" where great trading\r\nand banking facilities might be found. The Bank of England was\r\nestablished upon the counsel and assistance of Jewish emigrants from\r\nHolland. The Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of Hamburg both arose\r\nthrough Jewish influence.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious fact to be noted in connection with the persecution\r\nand consequent wanderings of the Jews about Europe and that is: wherever\r\nthey wandered, the center of business seemed to go with them. When the\r\nJews were free in Spain, there was the world's gold center. When Spain\r\ndrove out the Jews, Spain lost financial leadership and has never\r\nregained it. Students of the economic history of Europe have always been\r\npuzzled to discover why the center of trade should have shifted from\r\nSpain, Portugal and Italy, up to the northern countries of Holland,\r\nGermany, and England. They have sought for the cause in many things, but\r\nnone has proved completely explanatory. When, however, it is known that\r\nthe change was coincident with the expulsion of the Jews from the South\r\nand their flight to the North, when it is known that upon the Jews'\r\narrival the northern countries began a commercial life which has\r\nflourished until our day, the explanation does not seem difficult. Time\r\nand again it has proved to be the fact that when the Jews were forced to\r\nmove, the center of the world's precious metals moved with them.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of the Jews over Europe and the world, each Jewish\r\ncommunity linked in a fellowship of blood, faith and suffering with\r\nevery other group, made it possible for the Jew to be international in\r\nthe sense that no other race or group of merchants could be at that\r\ntime. Not only were they everywhere (Americans and Russians are\r\neverywhere, too) but they were in touch. They were organized before the\r\ndays of conscious international commercial organizations, they were\r\nbound together by the sinews of a common life. It was observed by many\r\nwriters in the Middle Ages that the Jews knew more of what was\r\ntranspiring in Europe than the governments did. They also had better\r\nknowledge of what was likely to occur. They knew more about conditions\r\nthan the statesmen did. This information they imparted by letter from\r\ngroup to group, country to country. Indeed, they may be said thus to\r\nhave originated unconsciously the financial news-letter. Certainly the\r\ninformation they were able to obtain and thus distribute was invaluable\r\nto them in their speculative enterprises. Advance knowledge was an\r\nimmense advantage in the days when news was scarce, slow and unreliable.\r\n\r\nThis enabled Jewish financiers to become the agents of national loans, a\r\nform of business which they encouraged wherever possible. The Jew has\r\nalways desired to have nations for his customers. National loans were\r\nfacilitated by the presence of members of the same family of financiers\r\nin various countries, thus making an interlocking directorate by which\r\nking could be played against king, government against government, and\r\nthe shrewdest use made of national prejudices and fears, all to the no\r\nsmall profit of the fiscal agent.\r\n\r\nOne of the charges most commonly made against Jewish financiers today is\r\nthat they still favor this larger field of finance. Indeed, in all the\r\ncriticism that is heard regarding the Jew as a business man, there is\r\ncomparatively little said against him as an individual merchant serving\r\nindividual customers. Thousands of small Jewish merchants are highly\r\nrespected by their trade, just as tens of thousands of Jewish families\r\nare respected as our neighbors. The criticism, insofar as it respects\r\nthe more important financiers, is not racial at all. Unfortunately the\r\nelement of race, which so easily lends itself to misinterpretation as\r\nracial prejudice, is injected into the question by the mere fact that\r\nthe chain of international finance as it is traced around the world\r\ndiscloses at every link a Jewish capitalist, financial family, or a\r\nJewish-controlled banking system. Many have professed to see in this\r\ncircumstance a conscious organization of Jewish power for Gentile\r\ncontrol, while others have attributed the circumstance to Jewish racial\r\nsympathies, to the continuity of their family affairs down the line of\r\ndescent, and to the increase of collateral branches. In the old\r\nScriptural phrase, Israel grows as the vine grows, ever shooting out new\r\nbranches and deepening old roots, but always part of the one vine.\r\n\r\nThe Jew's aptitude for dealing with governments may also be traced to\r\nthe years of his persecution. He early learned the power of gold in\r\ndealing with mercenary enemies. Wherever he went there followed him like\r\na curse the aroused antipathy of other peoples. The Jew was never\r\npopular as a race; even the most fervid Jew will not deny that,\r\nhowsoever he may explain it. Individuals have been popular, of course;\r\nmany phases of Jewish nature are found to be very lovable when known;\r\nbut nevertheless one of the burdens the Jews have had to bear as a race\r\nis this burden of racial unpopularity. Even in modern times, in\r\ncivilized countries, in conditions which render persecution absolutely\r\nimpossible, this unpopularity exists. And what is more, the Jew has not\r\nseemed to care to cultivate the friendship of the Gentile masses, due\r\nperhaps to the failures of experience, but due more likely to his inborn\r\npersuasion that he belongs to a superior race. Whatever the true reason,\r\nhe has always placed his main dependence on cultivating friendship with\r\nkings and nobles. What cared the Jew if the people gnashed their teeth\r\nagainst him, so long as the king and the court were his friends? Thus\r\nthere was always, even through most of the severely trying times, \"a\r\ncourt Jew,\" one who had bought by loans and held by the strangle-hold of\r\ndebt an entrance to the king's chamber. The policy of the Jews has\r\nalways been to \"go to headquarters.\" They never tried to placate the\r\nRussian people, but they did endeavor to enlist the Russian court. They\r\nnever tried to placate the German people, but they did succeed in\r\npermeating the German court. In England they shrug their shoulders at\r\nthe outspoken anti-Jew reactions of the British populace--what care\r\nthey? Have they not all of lorddom at their heels, do they not hold the\r\nstrings of Britain's purse?\r\n\r\nThrough this ability of theirs to \"go to headquarters\" it is possible to\r\naccount for the stronghold they got upon various governments and\r\nnations. Added to this ability was, of course, the ability to produce\r\nwhat the governments wanted. If a government wanted a loan, the Jew at\r\ncourt could arrange it through Jews at other financial centers and\r\npolitical capitals. If one government wanted to pay another government a\r\ndebt without risking the precious metal to a mule train through a\r\nrobber-infested country, the Jew at court arranged that too. He\r\ntransferred a piece of paper and the debt was paid by the banking house\r\nat the foreign capital. The first time an army was ever fed in the\r\nmodern commissary way, it was done by a Jew--he had the capital and he\r\nhad the system; moreover he had the delight of having a nation for his\r\ncustomer.\r\n\r\nAnd this tendency, which served the race so well throughout the\r\ntroublous centuries, shows no sign of abatement. Certainly, seeing to\r\nwhat an extent a race numerically so unimportant influences the various\r\ngovernments of the world today, the Jew who reflects upon the disparity\r\nbetween his people's numbers and their power may be pardoned if he sees\r\nin that fact a proof of their racial superiority.\r\n\r\nIt may be said also that Jewish inventiveness in business devices\r\ncontinues to the present time, as well as Jewish adaptability to\r\nchanging conditions. The Jew is credited with being the first to\r\nestablish branch houses in foreign countries in order that responsible\r\nrepresentatives of the home office might be on the ground taking instant\r\nadvantage of every opening. During the war a great deal was said about\r\nthe \"peaceful penetration\" which the \"German Government\" had effected in\r\nthe United States by establishing here branch offices and factories of\r\nGerman firms. The fact that there were many German branch houses here is\r\nunquestionable. It should be known, however, that they were not the\r\nevidence of German enterprise but of Jewish enterprise. The old German\r\nbusiness houses were too conservative to \"run after customers\" even in\r\nthe hustling United States, but the Jewish firms were not, and they came\r\nstraight to America and hustled. In due time the competition forced the\r\nmore conservative German firms to follow suit. But the idea was Jewish\r\nin its origin, not German.\r\n\r\nAnother modern business method whose origin is credited to Jewish\r\nfinanciers is that by which related industries are brought together, as\r\nfor example, if an electrical power company is acquired, then the street\r\nrailway company using the electricity would be acquired too, one purpose\r\nbeing in this way to conserve all the profit accruing along the line,\r\nfrom the origination of the power down to the delivery of the street car\r\nride; but perhaps the main purpose being that, by the control of the\r\npower house the price of current could be increased to the car company,\r\nand by the control of the car company the cost of a ride could be\r\nincreased to the public, the controllers thus receiving an additional\r\nprofit all down the line. There is much of this going on in the world\r\ntoday, and in the United States particularly. The portion of the\r\nbusiness immediately next to the ultimate consumer explains that its\r\ncosts have risen, but it does not explain that the costs were increased\r\nby the owners and not by outsiders who were forced to do so by economic\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently in the world today a central financial force which\r\nis playing a vast and closely organized game, with the world for its\r\ntable and universal control for its stakes. The people of civilized\r\ncountries have lost all confidence in the explanation that \"economic\r\nconditions\" are responsible for all the changes that occur. Under the\r\ncamouflage of \"economic law\" a great many phenomena have been accounted\r\nfor which were not due to any law whatever except the law of the selfish\r\nhuman will as operated by a few men who have the purpose and the power\r\nto work on a wide scale with nations as their vassals.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be national, no one today believes that finance is\r\nnational. Finance is international. Nobody today believes that\r\ninternational finance is in any way competitive. There are some\r\nindependent banking houses, but few strong independent ones. The great\r\nmasters, the few whose minds see clearly the entire play of the plan,\r\ncontrol numerous banking houses and trust companies, and one is used for\r\nthis while another is used for that, but there is no disharmony between\r\nthem, no correction of each other's methods, no competition in the\r\ninterests of the business world. There is as much unity of policy\r\nbetween the principal banking houses of every country as there is\r\nbetween the various branches of the United States Post Office--and for\r\nthe same reason, namely, they are all operated from the same source and\r\nfor the same purpose.\r\n\r\nJust before the war Germany bought very heavily in American cotton and\r\nhad huge quantities of it tied up here for export. When war came, the\r\nownership of that mountainous mass of cotton wealth changed in one night\r\nfrom Jewish names in Hamburg to Jewish names in London. At this writing\r\ncotton is selling in England for less than it is selling in the United\r\nStates, and the effect of that is to lower the American price. When the\r\nprice lowers sufficiently, the market is cleared of cotton by buyers\r\npreviously prepared, and then the price soars to high figures again. In\r\nthe meantime, the same powers that have engineered the apparently\r\ncauseless strengthening and weakening of the cotton market, have seized\r\nupon stricken Germany to be the sweatshop of the world. Certain groups\r\ncontrol the cotton, lend it to Germany to be manufactured, leave a\r\npittance of it there in payment for the labor that was used, and then\r\nprofiteer the length and breadth of the world on the lie that \"cotton is\r\nscarce.\" And when, tracing all these anti-social and colossally unfair\r\nmethods to their source, it is found that the responsible parties all\r\nhave a common characteristic, is it any wonder that the warning which\r\ncomes across the sea--\"Wait until America becomes awake to the\r\nJew!\"--has a new meaning?\r\n\r\nCertainly, economic reasons no longer explain the condition in which the\r\nworld finds itself today. Neither does the ordinary explanation of \"the\r\nheartlessness of capital.\" Capital has endeavored as never before to\r\nmeet the demands of labor, and labor has gone to extremes in leading\r\ncapital to new concessions--but what has it advantaged either of them?\r\nLabor has heretofore thought that capital was the sky over it, and it\r\nmade the sky yield, but behold, there was yet an higher sky which\r\nneither capital nor labor had seen in their struggles one with another.\r\nThat sky is so far unyielding.\r\n\r\nThat which we call capital here in America is usually money used in\r\nproduction, and we mistakenly refer to the manufacturer, the manager of\r\nwork, the provider of tools and jobs--we refer to him as the\r\n\"capitalist.\" Oh, no. He is not the capitalist in the real sense. Why,\r\nhe himself must go to capitalists for the money with which to finance\r\nhis plans. There is a power yet above him--a power which treats him far\r\nmore callously and holds him in a more ruthless hand than he would ever\r\ndare display to labor. That, indeed, is one of the tragedies of these\r\ntimes, that \"labor\" and \"capital\" are fighting each other, when the\r\nconditions against which each one of them protests, and from which each\r\none of them suffers, is not within their power to remedy at all, unless\r\nthey find a way to wrest world control from that group of international\r\nfinanciers who create and control both these conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is a super-capitalism which is supported wholly by the fiction\r\nthat gold is wealth. There is a super-government which is allied to no\r\ngovernment, which is free from them all, and yet which has its hand in\r\nthem all. There is a race, a part of humanity, which has never yet been\r\nreceived as a welcome part, and which has succeeded in raising itself to\r\na power that the proudest Gentile race has never claimed--not even Rome\r\nin the days of her proudest power. It is becoming more and more the\r\nconviction of men all over the world that the labor question, the wage\r\nquestion, the land question cannot be settled until first of all this\r\nmatter of an international super-capitalistic government is settled.\r\n\r\n\"To the victor belongs the spoils\" is an old saying. And in a sense it\r\nis true that if all this power of control has been gained and held by a\r\nfew men of a long-despised race, then either they are super-men whom it\r\nis powerless to resist, or they are ordinary men whom the rest of the\r\nworld has permitted to obtain an undue and unsafe degree of power.\r\nUnless the Jews are super-men, the Gentiles will have themselves to\r\nblame for what has transpired, and they can look for rectification in a\r\nnew scrutiny of the situation and a candid examination of the\r\nexperiences of other countries.\r\n\r\n[Issue of May 22, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nGermany's Reaction Against the Jew\r\n\r\n\r\nHumanity has become wise enough to discuss those forms of physical\r\nsickness over which it formerly drew the veil of shame and secrecy, but\r\npolitical hygiene is not so far advanced. The main source of the\r\nsickness of the German national body is charged to be the influence of\r\nthe Jews, and although this was apparent to acute minds years ago, it is\r\nnow said to have gone so far as to be apparent to the least observing.\r\nThe eruption has broken out on the surface of the body politic, and no\r\nfurther concealment of this fact is possible. It is the belief of all\r\nclasses of the German people that the collapse which has come since the\r\narmistice, and the revolution from which they are being prevented a\r\nrecovery, are the result of Jewish intrigue and purpose. They declare it\r\nwith assurance; they offer a mass of facts to confirm it; they believe\r\nthat history will provide the fullest proof.\r\n\r\nThe Jew in Germany is regarded as only a guest of the people; he has\r\noffended by trying to turn himself into the host. There are no stronger\r\ncontrasts in the world than the pure Germanic and pure Semitic races;\r\ntherefore, there has been no harmony between the two in Germany; the\r\nGerman has regarded the Jew strictly as a guest, while the Jew,\r\nindignant at not being given the privileges of the nation-family, has\r\ncherished animosity against his host. In other countries the Jew is\r\npermitted to mix more readily with the people, he can amass his control\r\nunchallenged; but in Germany the case was different. Therefore, the Jew\r\nhated the German people; therefore, the countries of the world which\r\nwere most dominated by the Jews showed the greatest hatred of Germany\r\nduring the recent regrettable war. Jewish hands were in almost exclusive\r\ncontrol of the engines of publicity by which public opinion concerning\r\nthe German people was molded. The sole winners of the war were Jews.\r\n\r\nBut assertion is not enough; proof is wanted; therefore, consider the\r\nevidence. What occurred immediately upon the change from the old regime\r\nto the new? The cabinet composed of six men, which substituted the\r\nMinister of State, was dominated by the Jews Haase and Landsberg. Haase\r\nhad control of foreign affairs; his assistant was the Jew Kautsky, a\r\nCzech, who in 1918 was not even a German citizen. Also associated with\r\nHaase were the Jews Cohn and Herzfeld. The Jew Schiffer was Financial\r\nMinister of State, assisted by the Jew Bernstein. The Secretary of the\r\nInterior was the Jew Preuss, with the Jew Dr. Freund for his assistant.\r\nThe Jew Fritz Max Cohen, who was correspondent of the Frankfurter\r\nZeitung in Copenhagen, was made government publicity agent.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Prussia duplicated this condition of affairs. The Jews\r\nHirsch and Rosenfeld dominated the cabinet, with Rosenfeld controlling\r\nthe Department of Justice, and Hirsch in the Department of the Interior.\r\nThe Jew Simon was in charge of the Treasury Department. The Prussian\r\nDepartment of Justice was wholly manned and operated by Jews. The\r\nDirector of Education was the Jew Furtran with the assistance of the Jew\r\nArndt. The Director of the Colonial Office was the Jew Meyer-Gerhard.\r\nThe Jew Kastenberg was the director of the Department of Art. The War\r\nFood Supply Department was directed by the Jew Wurm, while in the State\r\nFood Department were the Jews Prof. Dr. Hirsch and the Geheimrat Dr.\r\nStadthagen. The Soldiers' and Workmen's Committee was directed by the\r\nJew Cohen, with the Jews Stern, Herz, Lowenberg, Frankel, Israelowicz,\r\nLaubenheim, Seligsohn, Katzenstein, Laufenberg, Heimann, Schlesinger,\r\nMerz and Weyl having control of various activities of that committee.\r\n\r\nThe Jew Ernst is chief of police at Berlin; in the same office at\r\nFrankfurt is the Jew Sinzheimer; in Munich the Jew Steiner; in Essen the\r\nJew Levy. It will be remembered that the Jew Eisner was President of\r\nBavaria, his financial minister being the Jew Jaffe. Bavaria's trade,\r\ncommerce and industry were in control of the half-Jew Brentano. The Jews\r\nLipsinsky and Schwarz were active in the government of Saxony; the Jews\r\nThalheimer and Heiman in Wurtemberg; the Jew Fulda in Hessen.\r\n\r\nTwo delegates sent to the Peace Conference were Jews and a third was\r\nnotoriously the tool of Jewish purposes. In addition Jews swarmed\r\nthrough the German delegation as experts and advisors--Max Warburg, Dr.\r\nVon Strauss, Merton, Oskar Oppenheimer, Dr. Jaffe, Deutsch, Brentano,\r\nBernstein, Struck, Rathenau, Wassermann, and Mendelsohn-Bartholdi.\r\n\r\nAs to the part which Jews from other countries had in the Peace\r\nConference, German observers declare that any candid student may\r\ndiscover by reading the accounts of impartial non-Jewish recorders of\r\nthat event. Only the non-Jewish historians seem to have been struck by\r\nthe fact; the multitude of Jewish writers apparently judged it wise to\r\nconceal it.\r\n\r\nJewish influence in German affairs came strongly to the front during the\r\nwar. It came with all the directness and attack of a flying wedge, as if\r\npreviously prepared. The Jews of Germany were not German patriots during\r\nthe war, and although this will not appear a crime in the eyes of the\r\nnations who were opposed to Germany, it may throw some light on the\r\nJew's assertion of patriotic loyalty to the land where he lives.\r\nThoughtful Germans hold that it is impossible for the Jew to be a\r\npatriot, for reasons which will presently be given.\r\n\r\nThe point to be considered is the general claim that the persons already\r\nnamed would not have obtained the positions in which they were found had\r\nit not been for the Revolution, and the Revolution would not have come\r\nhad not they brought it. It is true that there were unsatisfactory\r\nconditions in Germany, but they could and would have been adjusted by\r\nthe people themselves; the conditions which destroyed the people's\r\nmorale and were made impossible of reform were in control of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe principal Jewish influences which are charged with bringing about\r\nthe downfall of German order may be named under three heads: (a) the\r\nspirit of Bolshevism which masqueraded under the name of German\r\nSocialism; (b) Jewish ownership and control of the Press; (c) Jewish\r\ncontrol of the food supply and the industrial machinery of the country.\r\nThere was a fourth, \"higher up,\" but these worked upon the German people\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nAs it is possible that German conclusions upon this matter may be\r\nreceived doubtfully by peoples whose public opinion has been shaped by\r\nJewish influence, it may help to quote George Pitter-Wilson, of the\r\nLondon Globe, who wrote early in April, 1919, \"Bolshevism is the\r\ndispossession of the Christian nations of the world to such an extent\r\nthat no capital will remain in the hands of the Christians, that all\r\nJews may jointly hold the world in their hands and reign wherever they\r\nchoose.\" As early as the second year of the war, German Jews were\r\npreaching that Germany's defeat was necessary to the rise of the\r\nproletariat, at which time Strobel declared, \"I openly admit that a full\r\nvictory of the country would not be in the interest of the Social\r\nDemocrats.\" Everywhere it was preached that \"the exaltation of the\r\nproletariat after a won victory is an impossibility.\" These instances,\r\nout of many, are cited not to reopen the military question but to show\r\nhow the so-called German Jew forgot loyalty to the country in which he\r\nlived and joined the outside Jews in accomplishing the collapse of\r\nGermany, and not merely, as we shall see, to rid Germany of militarism,\r\nwhich every thoughtful German desired, but to throw the country into\r\nsuch confusion as to permit them to seize control.\r\n\r\nThe press of Germany echoed this plan of the Jewish spokesmen, at first\r\nfaintly, then boldly. The Berliner Tageblatt and the Munchner Neuester\r\nNachrichten were during the whole war official and semi-official organs\r\nof the government. They were owned and controlled by Jews, as was also\r\nthe Frankfurter Zeitung and a host of smaller papers that were their\r\nspiritual dependents. These papers, it is charged, were really German\r\neditions of the Jew-controlled press of the Allied countries, and their\r\npurpose was the same. One of the great pieces of research that ought to\r\nbe undertaken for the purpose of showing the world how its thought is\r\nmanufactured for it every day, and for what ulterior purposes, is this\r\nunion of the Jewish press, which passes for the Public Press, throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe food and supplies of the people quickly passed into Jewish hands as\r\nsoon as the war emergency came, and then began a period of dishonesty\r\nwhich destroyed the confidence of the bravest. Like all other patriotic\r\npeople, the German people knew that war meant sacrifice and suffering,\r\nand like other people they were willing to share the common lot. But\r\nthey found themselves preyed upon by a class of Jews who had prepared\r\neverything to make profit out of the common distress. Immediately Jews\r\nappeared in banks, war companies, distribution societies, and the\r\nministries of supplies--wherever the life of the people could be\r\nspeculated in or taxed. Articles that were plentiful disappeared, only\r\nto reappear again at high prices. The war companies were exclusively\r\nJewish, and although the government attempted to regulate the outgo of\r\nfood in the interests of all the people, it became notorious that those\r\nwith money could get all of anything they wanted, regardless of the food\r\ncards. The Jews simply trebled the price of the goods they let go\r\nwithout the cards, and so kept a stream of the nation's gold flowing\r\ninto their private treasuries. None of the government's estimates of the\r\nfood stocks could be depended on, because of the hidden hoards on which\r\nthese speculators drew. This began to disturb the morale of the people,\r\nand complaints were made and prosecutions started; but as soon as the\r\ncases came up it was discovered that the prosecutor appointed to charge\r\nand the commissioner appointed to judge were also Jews, and so the cases\r\nusually wore themselves out without results. When, however, a German\r\nmerchant was caught, great noise was made about it, and the penalty\r\nplaced upon him was equal to what all the others should have had. Go the\r\nlength and breadth of Germany today, say the reports, study the temper\r\nof the people, and you will discover that the abuse of power by the Jews\r\nhas burned across Germany's memory like a hot iron.\r\n\r\nWhile these influences were undermining the mass of the people, higher\r\ninfluences of Jewish origin were operating upon the government. The\r\nadvisors of the Bethmann-Hollweg government were the great ship magnate\r\nBallin, a Jew; Theodor Wolff, of the Berliner Tageblatt and member of\r\nthe Pan-Jewish press; Von Gwinner, director of the German Bank who is\r\nconnected by marriage with the great Jew bankers, the Speyers; and\r\nRathenau, the leader of Jewish industrial-financial activities. These\r\nmen were at the source of things and were bending the government as the\r\nother influences were bending the people.\r\n\r\nThe rich German Jew could buy the recognition he desired by acquiring\r\nfinancial power over those interests which most directly affected the\r\nruling class of Germany, but how was the poor Jew to gain the\r\nrecognition he desired?--for all Jews are actuated by the same desire;\r\nit is in them; they feel the spur to mastery. Having explored the\r\nconquest of the higher circles by Jewish money-power, there is yet to\r\nexplore the conquest of the body of the nation by Jews who had no money\r\nexcept what they could seize in the disorder which they caused. The\r\nanalysis that is given, follows:\r\n\r\nThe Jew is not an anarchist. He is not a destructionist. All this is\r\ntrue, notwithstanding he is the world's Bolshevist and preeminently\r\nGermany's revolutionist. His anarchy is not ingrain, it is a device\r\nwhich he uses for a purpose. The rich Jew is not an anarchist, because\r\nhe can achieve what he desires by more subtle methods. The poor Jew has\r\nno other recourse. But rich and poor go jointly for a long stretch; the\r\nbond of sympathy between them never breaks; for, if the anarchy is\r\nsuccessful, then the poor Jew shall take his place with the rich Jew;\r\nand if the anarchy is not successful, it has nevertheless served to\r\nbreak up new fields in which the rich Jew may operate.\r\n\r\nIn Germany it was possible for the poor Jew to thrust himself up through\r\nthe wall of Germanism above him only by breaking it up. In Russia the\r\nsame was true. The social system had encrusted around the Jew, keeping\r\nhim in a position where, as the nations knew by experience, he would be\r\nless harmful. As nature encysts the harmful foreign element in the\r\nflesh, building a wall around it, so nations have found it expedient to\r\ndo with the Jew. In modern times, however, the Jew has found a means of\r\nknocking down the walls and throwing the whole national house into\r\nconfusion, and in the darkness and riot that follows, seize the place he\r\nhas long coveted. When Russia broke, who came first to light? Kerensky,\r\nwho is a Jew. But his plans were not radical enough, and then came\r\nTrotsky, another Jew. Trotsky found the system too strong for him to\r\nbreak in America--he broke through the weak spot in Russia and would\r\nextend that weakness round the world. Every commissar in Russia today is\r\na Jew. Publicists are accustomed to speak of Russia as if it were in\r\ndisorder. It may be that Russia is, but the Jewish government of Russia\r\nis not. From a mass of underlings, the Jews of Russia came up a perfect\r\nphalanx, a flying wedge through the superinduced disorder, as if every\r\nman's place had been previously prepared for him.\r\n\r\nThat also is the way it was in Germany. The German ceiling had to be\r\nbroken, as it were, before the poor Jews could realize their ambition.\r\nWhen the break was made they swarmed through and settled in places of\r\ncontrol above the nation.\r\n\r\nThis may explain why Jews the world over supply the energy of disruptive\r\nmovements. It is understood that the young Jews of the United States are\r\npropagandists of an ideal that would practically abolish the United\r\nStates. The attack is aimed, of course, against \"capitalism,\" which\r\nmeans the present government of the world by the Gentile. The true\r\ncapitalists of the world are Jews, who are capitalists for capital's\r\nsake. It is hard to believe that they wish to destroy capital; they wish\r\nto obtain sole control of it, and their wish has long been in fair way\r\nto fulfillment.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, therefore, as in Russia, distinction is made between the\r\nmethods of the rich and of the poor Jews, because one method affects the\r\ngovernment and the other the morale of the people, but both converge on\r\nthe same objective. It is not only desire to escape oppression that\r\nactuates the lower classes of Jews, but desire to gain control--for the\r\nspirit of mastery pulses strong within them. German convictions on this\r\nquestion have reached the place where they may be expressed thus:\r\nRevolution is the expression of the Jews' will to power. Parties such as\r\nthe socialists, democrats and freethinkers are but tools for the Jewish\r\nplan to power. The so-called \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" is really\r\nand practically the dictatorship of Jews.\r\n\r\nSo suddenly have German eyes been opened, so stormfully wrathful has\r\nbeen the reaction, that the word has gone out through German Judaism to\r\nretire to the second trench. There has been a sudden and concerted\r\nabandonment of office wherever the office made direct contact with the\r\npublic; there has, however, been no abandonment of power. What will\r\nhappen in Germany is not now known. Some regrettable things have already\r\nhappened. But the Germans will doubtless prove themselves equal to the\r\nsituation by devising methods of control at once unobjectionable and\r\neffective. But as to Russia, it is hardly doubtful any longer what will\r\nhappen there. When Russia turns, a shudder will run through the earth.\r\n\r\nHow Gentile Germany and Russia look at the entire question may be\r\nsummarized as follows:\r\n\r\nJudaism is the most closely organized power on earth, even more than the\r\nBritish Empire. It forms a State whose citizens are unconditionally\r\nloyal wherever they may be and whether rich or poor.\r\n\r\nThe name which is given in Germany to this State which circulates among\r\nall the states is \"All-Judaan.\"\r\n\r\nThe means of power of the State of All-Judaan are capital and\r\njournalism, or money and propaganda.\r\n\r\nAll-Judaan is the only State that exercises world government; all the\r\nother States can and may exercise national government only.\r\n\r\nThe principal culture of All-Judaan is journalistic; the technical,\r\nscientific, literary performances of the modern Jew are throughout\r\njournalistic performances. They are due to the marvelous talent of the\r\nJews for receptivity of others' ideas. Capital and Journalism are joined\r\nin the Press to create a political and spiritual medium of Jewish power.\r\n\r\nThe government of this state of All-Judaan is wonderfully organized.\r\nParis was its first seat, but has now been moved to third place. Before\r\nthe war London was its first, and New York its second capital. It\r\nremains to be seen whether New York will now supplant London--the drift\r\nis toward America.\r\n\r\nAs All-Judaan is not in a position to have a standing army and navy,\r\nother states supply these for it. Its fleet is the British fleet, which\r\nguards from hindrance the progress of all-Jewish world economy, or that\r\npart of it which depends on the sea. In return, All-Judaan assures\r\nBritain an undisturbed political and territorial world rule. All-Judaan\r\nhas added Palestine to British control. Wherever there was an All-Judaan\r\nland force (whatever national uniform it might wear), it worked with the\r\nBritish navy.\r\n\r\nAll-Judaan is willing to entrust the government of various strips of the\r\nworld to the nationalistic governments; it only asks to control the\r\ngovernments. Judaism is passionately in favor of perpetuating\r\nnationalistic divisions for the Gentile world. For themselves, Jews\r\nnever become assimilated with any nation. They are a separate people,\r\nalways were and always will be.\r\n\r\nAll-Judaan's only quarrel with any nation occurs when that nation makes\r\nit impossible for All-Judaan to control that nation's industrial and\r\nfinancial profits. It can make war, it can make peace; it can command\r\nanarchy in stubborn cases, it can restore order. It holds the sinews of\r\nworld power in its hand and it apportions them among the nations in such\r\nways as will best support All-Judaan's plan.\r\n\r\nControlling the world's sources of news, All-Judaan can always prepare\r\nthe minds of the people for its next move. The greatest exposure yet to\r\nbe made is the way that news is manufactured and the way in which the\r\nmind of whole nations is molded for a purpose. When the powerful Jew is\r\nat last traced and his hand revealed, then comes the ready cry of\r\npersecution and it echoes through the world press. The real causes of\r\nthe persecution (which is the oppression of the people by the financial\r\npractices of the Jews) are never given publicity.\r\n\r\nAll-Judaan has its vice-governments in London and New York. Having\r\nwreaked its revenge on Germany it will now go forth to conquer other\r\nnations. Britain it already has. Russia it is struggling for, but the\r\nchances are against it. The United States, with its good-natured\r\ntolerance of all races, offers a promising field. The scene of\r\noperations changes, but the Jew is the same throughout the centuries.\r\n\r\n[Issue of May 29, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At first sight it would seem as if the economic system of North America\r\nwas the very one that developed independently of the Jews . . . .\r\nNevertheless I uphold my assertion that the United States (perhaps more\r\nthan any other land) are filled to the brim with the Jewish spirit. This\r\nis recognized in many quarters, above all in those best capable of\r\nforming a judgment on the subject . . . .\r\n\r\n\"In the face of this fact, is there not some justification for the\r\nopinion that the United States owe their very existence to the Jews? And\r\nif this be so, how much more can it be asserted that Jewish influence\r\nmade the United States just what they are--that is, American? For what\r\nwe call Americanism is nothing else, if we may say so, than the Jewish\r\nspirit distilled.\"\r\n\r\n--Werner Sombart, \"The Jews and Modern Capital,\" pp. 38, 43.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nJewish History in the United States\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the Jews in America begins with Christopher Columbus. On\r\nAugust 2, 1492, more than 300,000 Jews were expelled from Spain, with\r\nwhich event Spain's prestige began its long decline, and on August 3,\r\nthe next day, Columbus set sail for the West, taking a group of Jews\r\nwith him. They were not, however, refugees, for the prophetic\r\nnavigator's plans had aroused the sympathy of influential Jews for a\r\nlong period previously. Columbus himself tells us that he consorted much\r\nwith Jews. The first letter he wrote detailing his discoveries was to a\r\nJew. Indeed, the eventful voyage itself which added to men's knowledge\r\nand wealth \"the other half of the earth\" was made possible by Jews.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant story that it was Queen Isabella's jewels which financed\r\nthe voyage has disappeared under cool research. There were three Maranos\r\nor \"secret Jews\" who wielded great influence at the Spanish court: Luis\r\nde Santagel, who was an important merchant of Valencia and who was\r\n\"farmer\" of the royal taxes; his relative, Gabriel Sanchez, who was the\r\nroyal treasurer; and their friend, the royal chamberlain, Juan Cabrero.\r\nThese worked unceasingly on Queen Isabella's imagination, picturing to\r\nher the depletion of the royal treasury and the likelihood of Columbus\r\ndiscovering the fabulous gold of the Indies, until the Queen was ready\r\nto offer her jewels in pawn for the funds. But Santagel craved\r\npermission to advance the money himself, which he did, 17,000 ducats in\r\nall, about $20,000, perhaps equal to $160,000 today. It is probable that\r\nthe loan exceeded the expedition's cost.\r\n\r\nAssociated with Columbus in the voyage were at least five Jews: Luis de\r\nTorres, interpreter; Marco, the surgeon; Bernal, the physician; Alonzo\r\nde la Calle, and Gabriel Sanchez. The astronomical instruments and maps\r\nwhich the navigators used were of Jewish origin. Luis de Torres was the\r\nfirst man ashore, the first to discover the use of tobacco; he settled\r\nin Cuba and may be said to be the father of Jewish control of the\r\ntobacco business as it exists today.\r\n\r\nColumbus' old patrons, Luis de Santagel and Gabriel Sanchez, received\r\nmany privileges for the part they played in the work, but Columbus\r\nhimself became the victim of a conspiracy fostered by Bernal, the ship's\r\ndoctor, and suffered injustice and imprisonment as his reward.\r\n\r\nFrom that beginning, Jews looked more and more to America as a fruitful\r\nfield, and immigration set in strongly toward South America, principally\r\nBrazil. But because of military participation in a disagreement between\r\nthe Brazilians and the Dutch, the Jews of Brazil found it necessary to\r\nemigrate, which they did in the direction of the Dutch colony of what is\r\nnow New York. Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch governor, did not entirely\r\napprove of their settling among his people and ordered them to leave,\r\nbut the Jews had evidently taken the precaution to assure their being\r\nreceived even if not welcomed, because upon revoking the order of\r\nStuyvesant, the Directors gave as one of the reasons for the Jews being\r\nreceived, \"the large amount of capital which they have invested in the\r\nshares of the Company.\" Nevertheless they were forbidden to enter public\r\nservice and to open retail shops, which had the effect of driving them\r\ninto foreign trade in which they were soon exercising all but a monopoly\r\nbecause of their European connections.\r\n\r\nThis is only one of the thousand illustrations which can be given of the\r\nresourcefulness of the Jew. Forbid him in one direction, he will excel\r\nin another. When he was forbidden to deal in new clothes, he sold old\r\nclothes--that was the beginning of the organized traffic in secondhand\r\nclothing. When he was forbidden to deal in merchandise, he dealt in\r\nwaste--the Jew is the originator of the waste product business of the\r\nworld; he was the originator of the salvage system; he found wealth in\r\nthe debris of civilization. He taught people how to use old rags, how to\r\nclean old feathers, how to use gall nuts and rabbit skins. He has always\r\nhad a taste for the furrier trade, which he now controls, and to him is\r\ndue the multitude of common skins which now pass under various alluring\r\ntrade names as furs of high origin. The idea of renovation gained\r\ncommercial value through the Jew. In the \"rag men\" who blow tin horns\r\nthrough our cities and save the old iron, old bottles, old paper and old\r\nfabrics, we have the commercial descendants of those earlier Jews who\r\nturned adversity into success by converting the rubbish of the earth\r\ninto material of value.\r\n\r\nUnwittingly, old Peter Stuyvesant compelled the Jew to make New York the\r\nprincipal port of America, and though a majority of New York Jews had\r\nfled to Philadelphia at the time of the American Revolution, most of\r\nthem returned to New York at the earliest opportunity, instinct seeming\r\nto make them aware that in New York was to be their principal paradise\r\nof gain. And so it has proved. New York is the greatest center of Jewish\r\npopulation in the world. It is the gateway where the bulk of American\r\nimports and exports are taxed, and where practically all the business\r\ndone in America pays tribute to the masters of money. The very land of\r\nthe city is practically the holdings of the Jews. A list of the property\r\nowners of the metropolis reveals only at rare intervals a Gentile name.\r\nNo wonder that Jewish writers, viewing this unprecedented prosperity,\r\nthis unchecked growth in wealth and power, exclaim enthusiastically that\r\nthe United States is the Promised Land foretold by the prophets, and New\r\nYork the New Jerusalem. Some have gone even further and described the\r\npeaks of the Rockies as \"the mountains of Zion,\" and with reason, too,\r\nif the mining and coastal wealth of the Jews is considered.\r\n\r\nThe new waterways proposal, which will make an ocean port of practically\r\nevery great city on the Great Lakes and take from New York the prestige\r\nshe has maintained by being the gateway toward which the principal\r\nrailways narrowed, is being strongly protested at this time. And the\r\nstrongest motive in opposing this most obvious betterment is that so\r\nmuch wealth counted in New York is not wealth at all, but fictitious\r\nvalues depending solely on New York remaining New York. When anything\r\ncomes which will make New York merely a city on the coast, and not the\r\ncity where the great taxers sit to levy their tribute, much Jewish\r\nwealth will decrease. It was fabulous before the war. What it is now the\r\nstatisticians will hardly undertake to say.\r\n\r\nIn fifty years the increase in the Jewish population of the United\r\nStates has been from 50,000 to more than 3,300,000. In the British Isles\r\nthere are only 300,000, in Palestine only 100,000. It is fortunate for\r\nthe Jew himself that in Great Britain his numbers are not greater, for\r\nthe large and evident control he exercises in great matters would\r\nsometimes make it inconvenient for the poorer Jew, if he were abroad in\r\nEngland in large numbers. An unusually well-informed Briton says that\r\nanti-Semitism is always ready to break out in England upon sufficient\r\ncause, but it cannot break out against the inaccessible rich Jews who\r\ncontrol in politics and international finance. It us probably true that\r\nthe commonest real cause of anti-Semitism is the action of the\r\ninternational Jew who is often unknown and always secure, but the\r\ninnocent victim of it is the poor Jew. Anti-Semitism, however, will be\r\nconsidered in the next article.\r\n\r\nThe figures representing Jewish population in Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States indicate that the colossal power wielded by international\r\nJewish financiers is neither consequent nor dependent upon their number.\r\nThe arresting fact about the Jew is his world-wide unchallenged power,\r\ncoupled with comparative numerical inferiority. There are only about\r\n14,000,000 Jews in the world; they are about as numerous as the Koreans.\r\nThis comparison of their numbers with the Koreans will illustrate still\r\nmore vividly the phenomenon of their power.\r\n\r\nIn the time of George Washington there were about 4,000 Jews in the\r\ncountry, most of them well-to-do traders. For the most part they favored\r\nthe American side. Haym Salomon helped the Colonies out with the loan of\r\nhis entire fortune at a critical moment. But they never assimilated,\r\nthey did not take up the usual employments nor farming, they never\r\nseemed to care for the worry of manufacturing things, but only for the\r\nselling of them after they were made.\r\n\r\nIt is only of recent years the Jew has shown any capacity for\r\nmanufacturing, and most of what he now engages in has grown up as an\r\nadjunct to his merchandising plans. By manufacturing, he saves a profit.\r\nThe result has not been a decrease in cost to the public, but an\r\nincrease. It is characteristic of Jewish business methods that economies\r\nare for the sake of the business, not for the sake of the public. The\r\ncommodities in which there have been the most inexcusable and exorbitant\r\nincreases in prices to the public, and the lines of business which have\r\nbeen most quickly frightened into lower prices without any explanatory\r\nchange in the general situation, have been those lines in which Jews\r\nexercise the widest control.\r\n\r\nBusiness to the Jewish mind is money; what the successful Jew may do\r\nwith the money after he gets it is another matter, but in the getting of\r\nit he never permits \"idealistic slush\" to interfere with the dollar. His\r\ndollar of profit is never \"clipped\" by any of the voluntary reforms by\r\nwhich a few men are trying to ameliorate the condition of the workers.\r\n\r\nThis is not by any means due to the hardness of the Jewish heart, but to\r\nthe hardness of the Jewish view of business. Business is to it a matter\r\nof goods and money, not of people. If you are in distress and suffering,\r\nthe Jewish heart would have sympathy for you; but if your house were\r\ninvolved in the matter, you and your house would be two separate\r\nentities; the Jew would naturally find it difficult, in his theory of\r\nbusiness, to humanize the house; he would deal with it after a manner\r\nwhich other people would call \"hard,\" but he would not feel the charge\r\nto be just; he would say that it was only \"business.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probably this way that the Jewish \"sweatshops\" of New York may be\r\nexplained. When the susceptible people of the nation commiserated the\r\npoor Jews of the New York sweatshops, they for the most part did not\r\nknow that the inventors and operators of the \"sweatshop\" method were\r\nthemselves Jews. Indeed, while it is the boast of our country that no\r\nrace or color or creed is persecuted here, but liberty is insured to\r\nall, still it is a fact which every special investigator has noted that\r\nthe only heartless treatment ever accorded the Jew in the United States\r\ncame from his own people, his overseers and masters. And yet there is no\r\nevidence that either the \"sweater\" or the \"sweated\" ever thought of it\r\nas inhumanity or as \"heartless.\" It was \"business.\" The \"sweated\" lived\r\nin the hope of having a roomful of people sewing for him or her some\r\nday. Their endlessly vital interest in \"business\" and their unflagging\r\nambition to get further up the ladder and become masters in their own\r\nsweatshop, enabled them to work without the slightest sense of\r\noppression or injustice which, after all, is the sorest thing about\r\npoverty. The Jews never regard work as a calamity, but neither do they\r\nregard subordinate positions as permanently theirs. Thus, they spend\r\ntheir energies in getting up and out rather than in lamenting the\r\ninconveniences of the place where they are and trying to improve it.\r\n\r\nAll this is individually excellent but socially harmful. The result is\r\nthat, until recently, the lower ranges of employment were wholly\r\nunsupervised, and the higher circles never felt the necessity of\r\ndevising industrial reforms and benefits. The record of the great Jews\r\nin charity is very noble; their record in industrial reforms is nil.\r\nWith commendable sympathy toward their own people, they will donate a\r\npart of their profits to rectify some of the human need resulting from\r\nthe method by which they made their profits, but as for reforming the\r\nmethod by which they get their profits in order that the resulting need\r\nmight be diminished or prevented, apparently it has never occurred to\r\nthem. At least, while there are many charitable names among the\r\nwealthier Jews, there are no names that stand for an actual, practical\r\nhumanizing of industry, its methods and its returns.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is unfortunate; but it is intelligible; more than that,\r\nit is explanatory of many things for which the Jew is blamed by those\r\nwho do not understand his nature. The Jew will go part way in sharing\r\nthe results of his prosperity; he has not gone any length, save upon\r\nouter compulsion, in sharing the processes, or sharing wealth in the\r\nmaking. And while the social effect is the same as if this were done out\r\nof cruel insensibility and inhumanity, still it must be said that mostly\r\nit is done not out of such feelings, but out of the Jew's ingrain\r\nconception of the game of business. Some proposals of industrial reform\r\nappear as crazy to him as would a proposal to credit one baseball\r\nbatter's hit to his opponent's score, just as a matter of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe American Jew does not assimilate. This is stated, not to blame him,\r\nbut merely as a fact. The Jew could merge with the people of America if\r\nhe desired, but he doesn't. If there is any prejudice existing against\r\nhim in America, aside from the sense of inquiry which his colossal\r\nsuccess engenders, it is because of his aloofness. The Jew is not\r\nobjectionable in his person, creed, or race. His spiritual ideals are\r\nshared by the world. But still he does not assimilate; he cultivates by\r\nhis exclusiveness the feeling that he does not \"belong.\" This is his\r\nprivilege, and from one point of view it may indicate excellent\r\njudgement, but he must not make it one of the grounds of his complaint\r\nagainst Gentiles in general, as he has a tendency to do. It is better\r\nthat he should make it clear to Gentiles once and for all where true\r\nJews stand in the matter, as when a young Jew said--\"There is all the\r\ndifference in the world between an American Jew and a Jewish American. A\r\nJewish American is a mere amateur Gentile, doomed to be a parasite\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\nThe ghetto is not an American product but the Jews' own importation.\r\nThey have separated themselves into a distinct community. Speaking of\r\nthis matter the Jewish Encyclopedia says: \"The social organization of\r\nthe Jews resident in America has differed little from that in other\r\ncountries * * * in the main, and without any compulsion, Jews preferred\r\nto live in close proximity to one another, a peculiarity which still\r\nprevails.\"\r\n\r\nTo make a list of the lines of business controlled by the Jews of the\r\nUnited States would be to touch most of the vital industries of the\r\ncountry--those which are really vital, and those which cultivated habit\r\nhas made to seem vital. The theatrical business, of course, as everyone\r\nknows, is exclusively Jewish. Play-producing, booking, theater operation\r\nare all in the hands of Jews. This perhaps accounts for the fact that in\r\nalmost every production today can be detected propaganda, sometimes\r\nglaringly commercial advertisement, which does not originate with\r\nplaywrights, but with producers.\r\n\r\nThe motion picture industry.\r\n\r\nThe sugar industry.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco industry.\r\n\r\nFifty per cent or more of the meat packing industry.\r\n\r\nUpward of 60 per cent of the shoemaking industry.\r\n\r\nMen's and women's ready-made clothing.\r\n\r\nMost of the musical purveying done in the country.\r\n\r\nJewelry.\r\n\r\nGrain.\r\n\r\nMore recently, cotton.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado smelting industry.\r\n\r\nMagazine authorship.\r\n\r\nNews distribution.\r\n\r\nThe liquor business.\r\n\r\nThe loan business.\r\n\r\nThese, only to name the industries with national and international\r\nsweep, are in control of the Jews of the United States, either alone or\r\nin association with Jews overseas.\r\n\r\nThe American people would be vastly surprised if they could see a\r\nline-up of some of the \"American business men\" who hold up our\r\ncommercial prestige overseas. They are mostly Jews. They have a keen\r\nsense of the value of the American name, and when in a foreign port you\r\nstroll up to the office which bears the sign, \"American Importing\r\nCompany,\" or \"American Commercial Company,\" or other similarly\r\nnon-committal names, hoping to find a countryman, an American, you\r\nusually find a Jew whose sojourn in America appears to have been all too\r\nbrief. This may throw a sidelight on the regard in which \"American\r\nbusiness methods\" are held in some parts of the world. When 30 or 40\r\ndifferent races of people can carry on business under the name\r\n\"American,\" and do it legally, too, it is not surprising that Americans\r\ndo not recognize some of the descriptions of American methods which\r\nappear in the foreign press. The Germans long ago complained that the\r\nrest of the world was judging them by the German-speaking Jewish\r\ncommercial traveler.\r\n\r\nInstances of Jewish prosperity in the United States are commonplace, but\r\nprosperity, the just reward of foresight and application, is not to be\r\nconfounded with control. The prosperity of the Jews can be had by anyone\r\nwho is willing to pay the price which the Jews pay for it--a very, very\r\nhigh price, as a rule, all things considered--but it would be impossible\r\nfor any Gentile coalition under similar circumstances to attain the\r\ncontrol which the Jews have won, for the reason that there is lacking in\r\nthe Gentile a certain quality of working-togetherness, a certain\r\nconspiracy of objective, and the adhesiveness of intense raciality,\r\nwhich characterizes the Jew. It is nothing to a Gentile that another man\r\nis a Gentile; it is next to everything to a Jew that the man at his door\r\nis another Jew. So, if instances of Jewish prosperity were needed, the\r\ncase of the Temple Emmanu-el, New York, might be cited, which in 1846\r\ncould scarcely raise $1,520 for its budget, but in 1868, following the\r\nCivil War, raised $708,755 from the rental of 231 pews. And the rise of\r\nthe Jewish clothing monopoly as one of the results of the same Civil War\r\nmight be cited as an instance of prosperity plus national and\r\ninternational control.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it might be said that the Jew has succeeded in everything he has\r\nattempted in the United States, except farming. The explanation usually\r\nmade in Jewish publications is that ordinary farming is far too simple\r\nto engage the Jew's intellect and therefore he is not enough interested\r\nin it to succeed, but that in dairy and cattle farming where the \"brain\"\r\nis more necessary he has made a success. Numerous attempts have been\r\nmade in various parts of the United States to start Jewish farming\r\ncolonies, but their story is a series of failures. Some have blamed the\r\nfailures on the Jew's lack of knowledge of scientific farming, others on\r\nhis distaste for manual labor, others on the lack of the speculative\r\nelement in agriculture. In any case, he stands higher in the\r\nnon-productive employments than in this basically productive one. Some\r\nstudents of the question state that the Jew never was a man of the land,\r\nbut always a trader, for which assertion one of the proofs offered is\r\nthe Jews' selection of Palestine as their country, that strip of land\r\nwhich formed a gateway between East and West and over which the overland\r\ntraffic of the world passed.\r\n\r\n[Issue of June 5, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Jewish Question still exists. It would be useless to deny it . . .\r\n. The Jewish Question exists wherever Jews live in perceptible numbers.\r\nWhere it does not exist, it is carried by Jews in the course of their\r\nmigrations. We naturally move to those places where we are not\r\npersecuted, and there our presence produces persecution . . . . The\r\nunfortunate Jews are now carrying anti-Semitism into England; they have\r\nalready introduced it into America.\"\r\n\r\n--Theodore Herzl, \"A Jewish State,\" p. 4.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Question--Fact or Fancy?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in writing about the Jewish Question is the\r\nsupersensitiveness of Jews and non-Jews concerning the whole matter.\r\nThere is a vague feeling that even to openly use the word \"Jew,\" or to\r\nexpose it nakedly to print, is somehow improper. Polite evasions like\r\n\"Hebrew\" and \"Semite,\" both of which are subject to the criticism of\r\ninaccuracy, are timidly essayed, and people pick their way gingerly as\r\nif the whole subject were forbidden, until some courageous Jewish\r\nthinker comes straight out with the good old word \"Jew,\" and then the\r\nconstraint is relieved and the air cleared. The word \"Jew\" is not an\r\nepithet; it is a name, ancient and honorable, with significance for\r\nevery period of human history, past, present and to come.\r\n\r\nThere is extreme sensitiveness about the public discussion of the Jewish\r\nQuestion on the part of Gentiles. They would prefer to keep it in the\r\nhazy borderlands of their thought, shrouded in silence. Their heritage\r\nof tolerance has something to do with their attitude, but perhaps their\r\ninstinctive sense of the difficulty involved has more to do with it. The\r\nprincipal public Gentile pronouncements upon the Jewish Question are in\r\nthe manner of the truckling politician or the pleasant after-dinner\r\nspeaker; the great Jewish names in philosophy, medicine, literature,\r\nmusic and finance are named over, the energy, ability and thrift of the\r\nrace are dwelt upon, and everyone goes home feeling that a difficult\r\nplace has been rather neatly negotiated. But nothing is changed thereby.\r\nThe Jew is not changed. The Gentile is not changed. The Jew still\r\nremains the enigma of the world.\r\n\r\nGentile sensitiveness on this point is best expressed by the desire for\r\nsilence--\"Why discuss it at all?\" is the attitude. Such an attitude is\r\nitself a proof that there is a problem which we would evade if we could.\r\n\"Why discuss it at all?\"--the keen thinker clearly sees in the\r\nimplications of such a question, the existence of a problem whose\r\ndiscussion or suppression will not always be within the choice of\r\neasy-going minds.\r\n\r\nIs there a Jewish Question in Russia? Unquestionably, in its most\r\nvirulent form. Is it necessary to meet that Question in Russia?\r\nUndoubtedly, meet it from every angle along which light and healing may\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nWell, the percentage of the Jewish population of Russia is just one per\r\ncent more than it is in the United States. The majority of the Jews\r\nthemselves are not less well-behaved in Russia than they are here; they\r\nlived under restrictions which do not exist here; yet in Russia their\r\ngenius has enabled them to attain a degree of power which has completely\r\nbaffled the Russian mind. Whether you go to Rumania, Russia, Austria or\r\nGermany, or anywhere else that the Jewish Question has come to the\r\nforefront as a vital issue, you will discover that the principal cause\r\nis the outworking of the Jewish genius to achieve the power of control.\r\n\r\nHere in the United States it is the fact of this remarkable minority--a\r\nsparse Jewish ingredient of three per cent in a nation of\r\n110,000,000--attaining in 50 years a degree of control that would be\r\nimpossible to a ten times larger group of any other race, that creates\r\nthe Jewish Question here. Three per cent of any other people would\r\nscarcely occasion comment, because we could not meet with a\r\nrepresentative of them wherever we went in high places--in the innermost\r\nsecrecy of the councils of the Big Four at Versailles; in the supreme\r\ncourt; in the councils of the White House; in the vast dispositions of\r\nworld finance--wherever there is power to get or use. Yet we meet the\r\nJew everywhere in the upper circles, literally everywhere there is\r\npower. He has the brains, the initiative, the penetrative vision which\r\nalmost automatically project him to the top, and as a consequence he is\r\nmore marked than any other race.\r\n\r\nAnd that is where the Jewish Question begins. It begins in very simple\r\nterms--How does the Jew so habitually and so resistlessly gravitate to\r\nthe highest places? What puts him there? Why is he put there? What does\r\nhe do there? What does the fact of his being there mean to the world?\r\n\r\nThat is the Jewish Question in its origin. From these points it goes on\r\nto others, and whether the trend becomes pro-Jewish or anti-Semitic\r\ndepends on the amount of prejudice brought to the inquiry, and whether\r\nit becomes pro-Humanity depends on the amount of insight and\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThe use of the word Humanity in connection with the word Jew usually\r\nthrows a side-meaning which may not be intended. In this connection it\r\nis usually understood that the humanity ought to be shown toward the\r\nJew. There is just as great an obligation upon the Jew to show his\r\nhumanity toward the whole race. The Jew has been too long accustomed to\r\nthink of himself as exclusively the claimant on the humanitarianism of\r\nsociety; society has a large claim against him that he cease his\r\nexclusiveness, that he cease exploiting the world, that he cease making\r\nJewish groups the end and all of his gains, and that he begin to\r\nfulfill, in a sense his exclusiveness has never yet enabled him to\r\nfulfill, the ancient prophecy that through him all the nations of the\r\nearth should be blessed.\r\n\r\nThe Jew cannot go on forever filling the role of suppliant for the\r\nworld's humanitarianism; he must himself show that quality to a society\r\nwhich seriously suspects his higher and more powerful groups of\r\nexploiting it with a pitiless rapacity which in its wide-flung and long\r\ndrawn-out distress may be described as an economic pogrom against a\r\nrather helpless humanity. For it is true that society is as helpless\r\nbefore the well-organized extortions of certain financial groups, as\r\nhuddled groups of Russian Jews were helpless against the anti-Semitic\r\nmob. And as in Russia, so in America, it is the poor Jew who suffers for\r\nthe delinquencies of the rich exploiter of his race.\r\n\r\nThis series of articles is already being met by an organized barrage by\r\nmail and wire and voice, every single item of which carries the wail of\r\npersecution. One would think that a heartless and horrible attack were\r\nbeing made on a most pitiable and helpless people--until one looks at\r\nthe letterheads of the magnates who write, and at the financial ratings\r\nof those who protest, and at the membership of the organizations whose\r\nresponsible heads hysterically demand retraction. And always in the\r\nbackground there is the threat of boycott, a threat which has\r\npractically sealed up the columns of every publication in America\r\nagainst even the mildest discussion of the Jewish Question.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Question in America cannot be concealed forever by threats\r\nagainst publications, nor by the propagandist publication of matter\r\nextremely and invariably favorable to everything Jewish. It is here and\r\nit cannot be twisted into something else by the adroit use of\r\npropaganda, nor can it be forever silenced by threats. The Jews of the\r\nUnited States can best serve themselves and their fellow-Jews all over\r\nthe world by letting drop their far too ready cry of \"anti-Semitism,\" by\r\nadopting a franker tone than that which befits a helpless victim, and by\r\nseeing what the Jewish Question is and how it behooves every Jew who\r\nloves his people to help solve it.\r\n\r\nThere has been used in this series the term \"International Jew.\" It is\r\nsusceptible of two interpretations: one, the Jew wherever he may be; the\r\nother, the Jew who exercises international control. The real contention\r\nof the world is with the latter and his satellites, whether Jew or\r\nGentile.\r\n\r\nNow, this international type of Jew, this grasper after world-control,\r\nthis actual possessor and wielder of world-control is a very unfortunate\r\nconnection for his race to have. The most unfortunate thing about the\r\ninternational Jew, from the standpoint of the ordinary Jew, is that the\r\ninternational type is also a Jew. And the significance of this is that\r\nthe type does not grow anywhere else than on a Jewish stem. There is no\r\nother racial nor national type which puts forth this kind of person. It\r\nis not merely that there are a few Jews among international financial\r\ncontrollers; it is that these world controllers are exclusively Jews.\r\nThat is the phenomenon which creates an unfortunate situation for those\r\nJews who are not and never shall be world-controllers, who are the plain\r\npeople of the Jewish race. If world-control were mixed, like the\r\ncontrol, say, of the biscuit business, then the occasional Jews we might\r\nfind in those higher financial altitudes would not constitute the\r\nproblem at all; the problem would then be limited to the existence of\r\nworld-control in the hands of a few men, of whatever race or lineage\r\nthey might be. But since world-control is an ambition which has only\r\nbeen achieved by Jews, and not by any of the methods usually adopted by\r\nwould-be world conquerors, it becomes inevitable that the question\r\nshould center in that remarkable race.\r\n\r\nThis brings another difficulty: in discussing this group of\r\nworld-controllers under the name of Jews (and they are Jews), it is not\r\nalways possible to stop and distinguish the group of Jews that is meant.\r\nThe candid reader can usually determine that, but the Jew who is in a\r\nstate of mind to be injured is sometimes pained by reading as a charge\r\nagainst himself what was intended for the upper group. \"Then why not\r\ndiscuss the upper group as financiers and not as Jews?\" may be asked.\r\nBecause they are Jews. It is not to the point to insist that in any list\r\nof rich men there are more Gentiles than Jews; we are not talking about\r\nmerely rich men who have, many of them, gained their riches by serving a\r\nSystem, we are talking about those who Control--and it is perfectly\r\napparent that merely to be rich is not to control. The world-controlling\r\nJew has riches, but he also has something much more powerful than that.\r\n\r\nThe international Jew, as already defined, rules not because he is rich,\r\nbut because in a most marked degree he possesses the commercial and\r\nmasterful genius of his race, and avails himself of a racial loyalty and\r\nsolidarity the like of which exists in no other human group. In other\r\nwords, transfer today the world-control of the international Jew to the\r\nhands of the highest commercially talented group of Gentiles, and the\r\nwhole fabric of world-control would eventually fall to pieces, because\r\nthe Gentile lacks a certain quality, be it human or divine, be it\r\nnatural or acquired, that the Jew possesses.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, the modern Jew denies. There is a new position taken by\r\nthe modernists among the Jews which constitutes a denial that the Jew\r\ndiffers from any other man except in the matter of religion. \"Jew\" they\r\nsay is not a racial designation, but a religious designation like\r\n\"Episcopalian,\" \"Catholic,\" \"Presbyterian.\" This is the argument used in\r\nnewspaper offices in the Jews' protests against giving the Jewish\r\ndesignation to those of their people who are implicated in crime--\"You\r\ndon't give the religious classification of other people who are\r\narrested,\" the editor is told, \"why should you do it with Jews?\" The\r\nappeal to religious tolerance always wins, and is sometimes useful in\r\ndiverting attention from other things.\r\n\r\nWell, if the Jews are only religiously differentiated from the rest of\r\nthe world, the phenomenon grows stranger still. For the rest of the\r\nworld is interested less in the Jew's religion than in anything else\r\nthat concerns him. There is really nothing in his religion to\r\ndifferentiate the Jew from the rest of mankind, as far as the moral\r\ncontent of that religion is concerned, and if there were he would have\r\novercome that by the fact that his Jewish religion supplies the moral\r\nstructure for both of the other great religions. Moreover, it is stated\r\nthat there are among English speaking nations 2,000,000 Jews who\r\nacknowledge their race and not their religion, while 1,000,000 are\r\nclassed as agnostic--are these any less Jews than the others? The world\r\ndoes not think so. The authoritative students of human differences do\r\nnot think so. An Irishman who grows indifferent to the Church is still\r\nan Irishman, and it would seem to be equally true that a Jew who grows\r\nindifferent to the Synagogue is still a Jew. He at least feels that he\r\nis, and so does the non-Jew.\r\n\r\nA still more serious challenge would arise if this contention of the\r\nmodernists were true, for it would necessitate the explanation of these\r\nworld-controlling Jews by their religion. We should have to say, \"They\r\nexcel through their religion,\" and then the problem would turn on the\r\nreligion whose practice should bring such power and prosperity to its\r\ndevotees. But another fact would intervene, namely, that these\r\nworld-controlling Jews are not notably religious; and still another fact\r\nwould hammer for recognition, namely, the most devout believers and most\r\nobedient followers of the Jewish religion are the poorest among the\r\nJews. If you want Jewish orthodoxy, the bracing morality of the Old\r\nTestament, you will find it, not among the successful Jews, who have\r\nUnitarianized their religion to the same extent that the Unitarians have\r\nJudaized their Christianity, but among the poor in the side streets who\r\nstill sacrifice the Saturday business for their Sabbath keeping.\r\nCertainly their religion has not given them world-control; instead, they\r\nhave made their own sacrifices to keep it inviolate against modernism.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the Jew differs from the rest of mankind only when he is\r\nin full accord with his religion, the question becomes very simple. Any\r\ncriticism of the Jew becomes sheer religious bigotry and nothing else!\r\nAnd that would be intolerable. But it would be the consensus of\r\nthoughtful opinion that the Jew differs less in his religion than in\r\nanything else. There is more difference between the two great branches\r\nof Christianity, more conscious difference, than between any branch of\r\nChristianity and Judaism.\r\n\r\nSo that, the contention of certain modernists notwithstanding, the world\r\nwill go on thinking of the Jew as a member of a race, a race whose\r\npersistence has defeated the utmost efforts made for its extermination,\r\na race that has preserved itself in virility and power by the observance\r\nof those natural laws the violation of which has mongrelized so many\r\nnations, a race which has come up out of the past with the two great\r\nmoral values which may be reckoned on monotheism and monogamy, a race\r\nwhich today is before us as the visible sign of an antiquity to which\r\nall our spiritual wealth harks back. Nay, the Jew will go on thinking of\r\nhimself as the member of a people, a nation, a race. And all the mixture\r\nand intermixture of thought or faith or custom cannot make it otherwise.\r\nA Jew is a Jew and as long as he remains within his perfectly\r\nunassailable traditions, he will remain a Jew. And he will always have\r\nthe right to feel that to be a Jew is to belong to a superior race.\r\n\r\nThese world-controlling Jews at the top of affairs, then, are there by\r\nvirtue of, among other things, certain qualities which are inherent in\r\ntheir Jewish natures. Every Jew has these qualities even if not in the\r\nsupreme sense, just as every Englishman has Shakespeare's tongue but not\r\nin Shakespeare's degree. And thus it is impracticable, if not\r\nimpossible, to consider the international Jew without laying the\r\nfoundations broadly upon Jewish character and psychology.\r\n\r\nWe may discount at once the too common libel that this greater form of\r\nJewish success is built upon dishonesty. It is impossible to indict the\r\nJewish people or any other people on a wholesale charge. No one knows\r\nbetter than the Jew how widespread is the notion that Jewish methods of\r\nbusiness are all unscrupulous. There is no doubt a possibility of a\r\ngreat deal of unscrupulousness existing without actual legal dishonesty,\r\nbut it is altogether possible that the reputation the Jewish people have\r\nlong borne in this respect may have had other sources than actual and\r\npersistent dishonesty.\r\n\r\nWe may indicate one of these possible sources. The Jew at a trade is\r\nnaturally quicker than most other men. They say there are other races\r\nwhich are as nimble at a trade as is the Jew, but the Jew does not live\r\nmuch among them. In this connection one may remember the famous joke\r\nabout the Jew who went to Scotland.\r\n\r\nNow, it is human nature for the slower man to believe that the quicker\r\nman is too deft by far, and to become suspicious of his deftness.\r\nEverybody suspects the \"sharper\" even though his sharpness be entirely\r\nhonest. The slower mind is likely to conceive that the man who sees so\r\nmany legitimate twists and turns to a trade, may also see and use a\r\nconvenient number of illegitimate twists and turns. Moreover, there is\r\nalways the ready suspicion that the one who gets \"the best of the\r\nbargain\" gets it by trickery which is not above board. Slow, honest,\r\nplain-spoken and straight-dealing people always have their doubts of the\r\nman who gets the better of it.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, as the records for centuries show, were a keen people in\r\ntrade. They were so keen that many regarded them as crooked. And so the\r\nJew became disliked for business reasons, not all of which were\r\ncreditable to the intelligence or initiative of his enemies.\r\n\r\nTake for example, the persecution which Jew merchants once suffered in\r\nEngland. In older England the merchant class had many easy-going\r\ntraditions. One tradition was that a respectable tradesman would never\r\nseek business but wait for it to come to him. Another tradition was that\r\nto decorate one's store window with lights or colors, or to display\r\none's stock of goods attractively in the view of the public, was a\r\ncontemptible and underhanded method of tempting a brother tradesman's\r\ncustomers away from him. Still another tradition was that it was\r\nstrictly unethical and unbusinesslike to handle more than one line of\r\ngoods. If one sold tea, it was the best reason in the world why he\r\nshould not sell teaspoons. As for advertising, the thing would have been\r\nso brazen and bold that public opinion would have put the advertiser out\r\nof business. The proper demeanor for a merchant was to seem reluctant to\r\npart with his goods.\r\n\r\nOne may readily imagine what happened when the Jewish merchant bustled\r\ninto the midst of this jungle of traditions. He simply broke them all.\r\nIn those days tradition had all the force of a divinely promulgated\r\nmoral law and in consequence of his initiative the Jew was regarded as a\r\ngreat offender. A man who would break those trade traditions would stop\r\nat nothing! The Jew was anxious to sell. If he could not sell one\r\narticle to a customer, he had another on hand to offer him. The Jews'\r\nstores became bazaars, forerunners of our modern department stores, and\r\nthe old English custom of one store for one line of goods was broken up.\r\nThe Jew went after trade, pursued it, persuaded it. He was the\r\noriginator of \"a quick turnover and small profits.\" He originated the\r\ninstallment plan. The one state of affairs he could not endure was\r\nbusiness at a standstill, and to start it moving he would do anything.\r\nHe was the first advertiser--in a day when even to announce in the\r\npublic prints the location of your store was to intimate to the public\r\nthat you were in financial difficulties, were about to go to the wall\r\nand were trying the last desperate expedient to which no self-respecting\r\nmerchant would stoop.\r\n\r\nIt was as easy as child's play to connect this energy with dishonesty.\r\nThe Jew was not playing the game, at least so the staid English merchant\r\nthought. As a matter of fact he was playing the game to get it all in\r\nhis own hands--which he has practically done.\r\n\r\nThe Jew has shown that same ability ever since. His power of analyzing\r\nthe money currents amounts to an instinct. His establishment in one\r\ncountry represented another base from which the members of his race\r\ncould operate. Whether by the natural outworking of innate gifts, or the\r\ndeliberate plan of race unity and loyalty, all Jewish trading\r\ncommunities had relations, and as those trading communities increased in\r\nwealth, prestige and power, as they formed relations with governments\r\nand great interests in the countries where they operated, they simply\r\nput more power into the central community wherever it might be located,\r\nnow in Spain, now in Holland, now in England. Whether by intention or\r\nnot, they became more closely allied than the branches of one business\r\ncould be, because the cement of racial unity, the bond of racial\r\nbrotherhood cannot in the very nature of things exist among the Gentiles\r\nas it exists among the Jews. Gentiles never think of themselves as\r\nGentiles, and never feel that they owe anything to another Gentile as\r\nsuch. Thus they have been convenient agents of Jewish schemes at times\r\nand in places when it was not expedient that the Jewish controllers\r\nshould be publicly known; but they have never been successful\r\ncompetitors of the Jew in the field of world-control.\r\n\r\nFrom these separated Jewish communities went power to the central\r\ncommunity where the master bankers and the master analysts of conditions\r\nlived. And back from the central community flowed information of an\r\ninvaluable character and assistance wherever needed. It is not difficult\r\nto understand how, under such a condition, the nation that did not deal\r\nkindly with the Jews was made to suffer, and the nation that yielded to\r\nthem their fullest desire was favored by them. And it is credibly stated\r\nthat they have made certain nations feel the power of their displeasure.\r\n\r\nThis system, if it ever existed, exists in greater power today. It is\r\ntoday, however, threatened as it has never been. Fifty years ago,\r\ninternational banking, which was mostly in control of the Jews as the\r\nmoney brokers of the world, was on top of business. It exercised the\r\nsupercontrol of governments and finance everywhere. Then came that new\r\nthing, Industry, which expanded to a degree unguessed by the shrewdest\r\nprophets and analysts. As Industry gathered strength and power it became\r\na powerful money magnet, drawing the wealth of the world in its train,\r\nnot, however, merely for the sake of possessing the money, but of making\r\nit work. Production and profit on production, instead of loans and\r\ninterest on loans, became the master method for a time. The war came, in\r\nwhich the former broker-masters of the world had undoubtedly their large\r\npart. And now the two forces, Industry and Finance, are in a struggle to\r\nsee whether Finance is again to become the master, or creative Industry.\r\nThis is one of the elements which is bringing the Jewish Question to the\r\nbar of public opinion.\r\n\r\nTo state this and to prove it may be nothing more than to establish the\r\nsuperiority of Jewish ability. Certainly it is not a tenable position to\r\nsay that the Jew is extraordinarily successful and therefore must be\r\ncurbed. It would be equally aside from the truth to say that the\r\nco-ordination of Jewish activity has been, on the whole, a harmful thing\r\nfor the world. It may be possible to show that up to this point it has\r\nbeen useful. Success cannot be attacked nor condemned. If any moral\r\nquestion arises at all, it must concern the use made of the success\r\nwhich has been attained. The whole matter centers there, after the\r\nprevious fact is established. May the Jew go on as he has gone, or does\r\nhis duty to the world require another use of his success?\r\n\r\nThis inquiry obviously leads to further discussion, as well as a\r\ngathering up of the remaining threads of the present discussion, which\r\nfuture articles will attempt to do.\r\n\r\n[Issue of June 12, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To this end we must organize. Organize, in the first place, so that the\r\nworld may have proof of the extent and the intensity of our desire for\r\nliberty. Organize, in the second place, so that our resources may become\r\nknown and be made available . . . .\r\n\r\n\"Organize, organize, organize, until every Jew must stand up and be\r\ncounted--counted with us, or prove himself, wittingly or unwittingly, of\r\nthe few who are against their own people.\"\r\n\r\n--Louis D. Brandeis, Justice of the United States Supreme Court,\r\n\"Zionism,\" pp. 113, 114.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism--Will It Appear in the U. S.?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone who essays to discuss the Jewish Question in the United States or\r\nanywhere else must be fully prepared to be regarded as an Anti-Semite,\r\nin high-brow language, or in low-brow language, a Jew-baiter. Nor need\r\nencouragement be looked for from people or from press. The people who\r\nare awake to the subject at all prefer to wait and see how it all turns\r\nout; while there is probably not a newspaper in America, and certainly\r\nnone of the advertising mediums which are called magazines, which would\r\nhave the temerity even to breathe seriously the fact that such a\r\nQuestion exists. The press in general is open at this time to fulsome\r\neditorials in favor of everything Jewish (specimens of the same being\r\nobtainable almost anywhere), while the Jewish press, which is fairly\r\nnumerous in the United States, takes care of the vituperative end.\r\n\r\nOf course, the only acceptable explanation of any public discussion at\r\npresent of the Jewish Question is that some one--writer, or publisher,\r\nor a related interest--is a Jew-hater. That idea seems to be fixed; it\r\nis fixed in the Jew by inheritance; it is sought to be fixed in the\r\nGentile by propaganda, that any writing which does not simply cloy and\r\ndrip in syrupy sweetness toward things Jewish is born of prejudice and\r\nhatred. It is, therefore, full of lies, insult, insinuation, and\r\nconstitutes an instigation to massacre. These terms are culled at random\r\nfrom Jewish editorial utterances at hand.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to be necessary for our Jewish citizens to enlarge their\r\nclassification of Gentiles to include the class which recognizes the\r\nexistence of a Jewish Question and still is not anti-Semitic.\r\n\r\nThere are four distinct parties traceable among the Jews themselves.\r\nFirst, those whose passionate purpose is to keep Jewish faith and life\r\nalive at the cost of any sacrifice of popularity or success; second,\r\nthose who are willing to make whatever sacrifice may be needed to\r\npreserve Jewish religion, but are not so particular about the\r\ntraditional customs of Jewish life; third, those who have no very strong\r\nconvictions either way, but are opportunists, and will always swerve in\r\nthe direction of success; and, fourth, those who believe and preach that\r\nthe only solution of the differences between the Jew and other men is\r\nthe complete absorption of the Jewish race by the other races. The\r\nfourth is the weakest, most unpopular and least to be considered of all\r\nthe parties.\r\n\r\nWith the Gentiles there are only two classes, as far as this special\r\nquestion is concerned: those who dislike Jews, they cannot tell why; and\r\nthose who are disposed to fairness, in spite of the accident of\r\ncongeniality or uncongeniality, and who recognize the Jewish Question\r\nas, at least, a problem. Both these attitudes, whenever they become\r\napparent, are subject to the charge of \"anti-Semitism.\"\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism is a term which is bandied about too loosely. It ought to\r\nbe reserved to denote the real anti-Jewish temper of violent prejudice.\r\nIf used indiscriminately about all who attempt to discuss Jewish\r\ncharacteristics and Jewish world-power, it may in time arrive at the\r\nestate of respectability and honor.\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism in almost every form is bound to come to the United\r\nStates; indeed, it may be said that it is here now, and has been here\r\nfor a long time. If it be mislabeled now, the United States will not be\r\nable to work within it the transformation which has been effected upon\r\nso many other ideas that have arrived here in their journey round the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIt may be a serviceable clearing of the ground to define what\r\nanti-Semitism is not:\r\n\r\n1. It is not recognition of the Jewish Question. If it were, then it\r\ncould be set down that the bulk of the American people are destined to\r\nbecome anti-Semites, for they are beginning to recognize the existence\r\nof a Jewish Question and will steadily do so in increasing numbers as\r\nthe Question is forced upon them from the various practical angles of\r\ntheir lives. The Question is here. We may be honestly blind to it. We\r\nmay be timidly silent about it. We may even make dishonest denial of it.\r\nBut it is here. In time all will have to recognize it. In time the\r\npolite \"hush, hush\" of over-sensitive or intimidated circles will not be\r\npowerful enough to suppress it. But to recognize it will not mean that\r\nwe have gone over to a campaign of hatred and enmity against the Jews.\r\nIt will only mean that a stream of tendency which has been flowing\r\nthrough our civilization has at last accumulated bulk and power enough\r\nto challenge attention, to call for some decision with regard to it, to\r\ncall for the adoption of a policy which will not repeat the mistakes of\r\nthe past and yet will forestall any possible social menace of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n2. Again, the public discussion of the Jewish Question is not\r\nanti-Semitism. Publicity is sanitary. The publicity given the Jewish\r\nQuestion, or certain aspects of it, in this country has been very\r\nmisleading. It has been discussed more fully in the Jewish press than\r\nelsewhere, but not with candor or breadth of vision. The two dominant\r\nnotes--they are sounded over and over again with monotonous regularity\r\nin the Jewish press--are Gentile unfairness and Christian prejudice.\r\nThese apparently are the two chief aspects of life which impress Jewish\r\npublicists when they look over the line of their own race. It is said in\r\nall soberness that it is fortunate for Jews generally that the Jewish\r\npress does not circulate very widely among Gentiles, for it is probably\r\nthe one established agency in the United States which, without altering\r\nits program in the least, could stir up anti-Jewish sentiment by the\r\nsimple expedient of a general reading among non-Jews. Jewish writers\r\nwriting for Jewish readers present unusual material for the study of\r\nrace consciousness and its accompaniment of contempt for other races. It\r\nis true that in the publications referred to, America is constantly\r\npraised, but not America as the land of the American people; America,\r\nrather, as the land of the Jews' opportunity.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the daily press, there has been no serious discussion at\r\nall. This is neither surprising nor reprehensible. The daily press deals\r\nwith matters that have reached the overheated stage. When it mentions\r\nthe Jews at all, it has stock phrases for the purpose; the effort\r\nincludes a list of the famous Jews of history, and usually closes with\r\ncomplimentary references to certain local Jews of commendable qualities,\r\nwhose advertisements are not infrequently found in another part of the\r\npaper. Summing up, it may be said that the publicity given the question\r\nin this country consists in misrepresentative criticism of the Gentiles\r\nby the Jewish press and misrepresentative praise of the Jews by the\r\nnon-Jewish press. An independent effort to give a constructive publicity\r\ncannot, therefore, be laid to anti-Semitism, even when some of the\r\nstatements which are made in the course of it arouse the resentment of\r\nJewish readers.\r\n\r\n3. Nor is it anti-Semitism to say that the suspicion is abroad in every\r\ncapital of civilization and the certainty is held by a number of\r\nimportant men that there is active in the world a plan to control the\r\nworld, not by territorial acquisition, not by military aggression, nor\r\nby governmental subjection, not even by economic control in the\r\nscientific sense, but by control of the machinery of commerce and\r\nexchange. It is not anti-Semitism to say that, nor to present the\r\nevidence which supports that, nor to bring the proof of that. Those who\r\ncould best disprove it if it were not true are the international Jews\r\nthemselves, but they have not disproved it. Those who could best prove\r\nit would be those Jews whose ideals include the good of the whole of\r\nhumanity on an equality and not the good of one race only, but they have\r\nnot proved it. Some day a prophetic Jew may arise who will see that the\r\npromises bestowed upon the Ancient People are not to be fulfilled by\r\nRothschild methods, and that the promise that all the nations were to be\r\nblessed through Israel is not to be fulfilled by making the nations the\r\neconomic vassals of Israel; and when that time comes we may hope for a\r\nredirection of Jewish energy into channels that will drain the present\r\nsources of the Jewish Question. In the meantime, it is not\r\nanti-Semitism, it may even be found to be a world service to the Jew, to\r\nthrow light on what purpose motivates certain higher circles.\r\n\r\nIf the above propositions are true, then the term \"anti-Semitic,\" so\r\nfreely bestowed on this series of articles, betrays a worse spirit in\r\nthe critics than in the author. But enough of that. There is much yet to\r\ndo, and what is done must stand on what merit remains after friend and\r\nfoe alike are through with praise and blame.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAnti-Semitism has unquestionably swayed large sections of humanity at\r\nvarious times, warping the vision, twisting the characters and staining\r\nthe hands of its victims, but the most amazing statement that can be\r\nmade of it is that it has never accomplished anything in behalf of those\r\nwho used it, and it has never taught anything to the Jews against whom\r\nit was used.\r\n\r\nThe grades of anti-Semitism are fairly numerous, and a few of them may\r\nbe cited here:\r\n\r\n1. There is first that degree of anti-Semitism, if it may be so\r\ndescribed, which consists in plain dislike of the Jew as a person, no\r\nmatter whom he may be. This is often found in people of all grades. It\r\nis found mostly, however, in those whose contact with Jews has been very\r\nlimited. It begins sometimes in childhood with an instinctive dislike\r\nfor the word \"Jew.\" It is encouraged by the misuse of the word \"Jew\" as\r\nan epithet, or as an adjective generally descriptive of unpopular\r\npractices. The feeling is not different from that which exists toward\r\nGentiles, concerning whom the same notions are held, but it differs in\r\nthat it is extended to the race of unknown individual Jews instead of\r\nbeing restricted to known individuals who may justify such a feeling.\r\n\r\nCongeniality is not within our choice, but control of the sentiment of\r\nuncongeniality is. Every fair-minded person is compelled at times to\r\nreflect that it is not impossible that the person for whom he feels a\r\ndislike may be as good and possibly a better person than he. Our dislike\r\nmerely registers the result of attraction and repulsion as they operate\r\nbetween another person and oneself; it does not indicate that the\r\ndisliked person is unworthy. Of course, wherever intelligence is joined\r\nwith this instinctive withdrawal from social contact with members of the\r\nJewish race, prejudice is forestalled, except, of course, in those\r\npersons who hold that there are no individuals among the Jews worthy of\r\nrespect. This is an extreme attitude and is composed of other elements\r\nbeside natural dislike. It is possible for people to dislike Jews and\r\nnot be anti-Semitic. Indeed, it is not at all uncommon, it grows more\r\nand more common, that intelligent and refined Jews themselves do not\r\nrelish the society of their own people except in cases of exceptional\r\nrefinement.\r\n\r\nThis reality calls for some comment on the manners and characteristics\r\nof the ordinary member of the Jewish race, the accidents of behavior\r\nwhich stand out most obnoxiously and of which Jews themselves are often\r\nthe most unsparing critics, but these comments must fall into place\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n2. A second stage of the spirit of anti-Semitism may be designated as\r\nhatred and enmity. It should be noted that the antipathy referred to\r\nimmediately above was not hatred. Dislike is not hatred, nor is it\r\nnecessarily enmity. One may dislike sugar in his tea without troubling\r\nto hate sugar. But undoubtedly there are people who because they have\r\nlet their dislikes deepen into prejudice, and perhaps also because of\r\nunpleasant experiences with members of the Jewish race (probably a\r\nmillion Americans have been brought to the verge of becoming Jew-haters\r\nthis winter because of contact with Jewish merchants and landlords) may\r\nbe classified as, at least, incipient anti-Semites. This is most of all\r\nunfortunate for the persons who harbor these emotions. It is unfortunate\r\nin that it unfits the mind to consider intelligently the facts which\r\nconstitute the Jewish Question, and also unfits it to deal with them in\r\na fair and constructive way. For one's own sake, whatever the\r\nprovocation otherwise, it is better not to let passion deflect the\r\nneedle of one's mind. Hatred at the wheel means hazard on the course.\r\nEnmity lives in the vicinity of the Jews more than of any other race,\r\nand the reason for this is one of the puzzles of the ages. The Jewish\r\nnature itself, as shown in ancient and modern history, is not without\r\nits own share of enmity, and it either evokes or provokes enmity where\r\nit comes in contact with those Aryan races which follow their natural\r\nimpulses unchecked by cultural and ethical influences. This age-long\r\nconflict of the Jew has puzzled the minds of students for generations.\r\nSome explain it Biblically as the curse of Jehovah upon His Chosen\r\nPeople for their disobedience to the discipline by which He would have\r\nmade them the Prophet Nation of the world. If this offense must come, if\r\nit is part of the Jew's heritage, an old saying--Christian and\r\nScriptural, by the way--would still remain true: \"It must needs be that\r\noffenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\"\r\n\r\n3. In some parts of the world at various times this feeling of hatred\r\nhas broken into murderous violence, which has roused, as wholesale\r\nphysical outrage always does, the horror and resentment of humanity.\r\nThis is the extreme form in which anti-Semitism has exhibited itself,\r\nand it is the charge of intending to stimulate it here and elsewhere\r\nwhich every public discussion of the Jewish Question has to bear. There\r\nis, of course, no excuse for these outbreaks, but there is sufficient\r\nexplanation of them. The Jews usually explain them as expressions of\r\nreligious prejudice, and the Gentiles as rebellion against an economic\r\nyoke which the Jews have woven for the people. It is an astonishing fact\r\nthat, to take one country, the parts of Russia where anti-Semitic\r\nviolence has been most marked are the most prosperous parts, so\r\nprosperous indeed and with a prosperity so unquestionably due to Jewish\r\nenterprise that the Jews have openly declared that they have the power\r\nto throw those parts of Russia back into commercial lethargy again by\r\nsimply withdrawing. It is utterly idle to throw denials at this\r\nstatement. It is confirmed time and time again by men who have gone to\r\nRussia full of resentment against the attitude of the Russians toward\r\nthe Jews, as that attitude is represented in the Anglo-Saxon press, and\r\nwho have come home with a new light on the cause of these outbreaks,\r\nthough not excusing their character. Impartial observers have also found\r\nthat some of the outbreaks have been precipitated by the Jews\r\nthemselves. A correspondent, known the world over for his trenchant\r\ndefense of the Jews under Russian persecution, was always bitterly\r\nattacked by the Jews themselves whenever he stated the truth about this,\r\nnotwithstanding his protest to them that if he did not tell the truth\r\nwhen they were in the wrong the world would not be ready to believe him\r\nwhen he said they were blameless. To this day, in every country, the\r\nJews are slow to admit blameworthiness for anything. They must be\r\nexcused, whoever else may be accused. It is a trait which will have to\r\nbe disciplined before they can be brought to assist, if ever they can,\r\nthe removal of those characteristics which arouse the antagonism of\r\nother peoples. Elsewhere in the world, it may be said that out-and-out\r\nenmity to the Jews has an economic basis. This, of course, leads to the\r\nquestion whether the Jew shall have to become a deliberate failure, or\r\ndeny his genius, and forego his just meed of prosperity before he can\r\nwin the approval of the other races--a question which will arise for\r\ndiscussion later.\r\n\r\nAs to the religious prejudice which the Jews are, as a rule, readiest to\r\naffirm, it is safe to say that it does not exist in the United States.\r\nYet it is charged up to Americans by Jewish writers just as freely as it\r\nis charged up to Russians. Each non-Jew reader is competent to settle\r\nthis for himself. He can easily do so by asking himself whether in all\r\nhis life he has ever felt a moment's resentment against the Jew on\r\naccount of his religion. In an address recently delivered in a Jewish\r\nlodge and reported in the Jewish press, the speaker, a Jew, stated that\r\nif 100 non-Jews on the street were approached at random and casually\r\nasked what a Jew is, the reply of the majority would be, \"He is a\r\nChrist-killer.\" One of the best known and most highly respected rabbis\r\nin the United States said recently in a sermon that children in\r\nChristian Sunday schools were taught to regard the Jew as a\r\nChrist-killer. He repeated it in a conversation several weeks later.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be the testimony of Christians generally that they\r\nnever heard this term until they heard it in a Jewish complaint, and\r\ncertainly themselves never used it. The charge is absurd. Let the\r\n20,000,000 now in the Christian Sunday schools of Canada and the United\r\nStates testify as to the instruction given. There is no hesitation in\r\nstating that there is no prejudice whatever in the Christian churches\r\nagainst the Jew on account of his religion. On the contrary, there is\r\nnot only a deep sense of indebtedness, but a feeling of sharing with the\r\nJew in his religion. The Sunday schools of the Christian churches of the\r\nworld are spending six months of this year studying the International\r\nLessons which are appointed for the Books of the Judges, Ruth, First and\r\nSecond Samuel and the Books of the Kings, and every year is devoted in\r\npart to the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nHere, however, is something for Jewish religious leaders to consider:\r\nthere is more downright bitterness of religious prejudice on the part of\r\nthe Jews against Christianity than could ever be possible in the\r\nChristian churches of America. Simply take the church press of America\r\nand compare it with the Jewish press in this regard, and there is no\r\nanswer. No Christian editor would think it either Christian or\r\nintelligent to attack the Jewish religion, yet any six months' survey of\r\nthe Jewish press would yield a mass of attack and prejudice on the other\r\nside. Moreover, no religious bitterness in America attains within\r\ninfinite distances to that bitterness visited upon the Jew who becomes a\r\nChristian in his faith. It amounts almost to a holy vendetta. A\r\nChristian may become a Jewish proselyte and his motives be respected; it\r\nis never so when a Jew becomes a Christian. These statements are true of\r\nboth the orthodox and liberal wings of Judaism. It is not his religion\r\nthat gives prominence to the Jew today; it is something else. And yet,\r\nwith undeviating monotony, it is repeated wherever the Jew takes\r\ncognizance of the feeling toward him that it is on account of three\r\nthings, first and most prominent of which is his religion. It may be\r\ncomforting to him to think that he is suffering for his faith, but it is\r\nnot true. Every intelligent Jew must know it.\r\n\r\nEvery Jew ought to know also that in every Christian church where the\r\nancient prophecies are received and studied, there is a great revival of\r\ninterest in the future of the Ancient People. It is not forgotten that\r\ncertain Promises were made to them regarding their position in the\r\nworld, and it is held that these prophecies will be fulfilled. The\r\nfuture of the Jew, as prophetically outlined, is intimately bound up\r\nwith the future of this planet, and the Christian church in large\r\npart--at least by the evangelical wing, which the Jews most\r\ncondemn--sees a Restoration of the Chosen People yet to come. If the\r\nmass of the Jews knew how understandingly and sympathetically all the\r\nprophecies concerning them are being studied in the Church, and the\r\nfaith that exists that these prophecies will find fulfillment and that\r\nthey will result in great Jewish service to society at large, they would\r\nprobably regard the Church with another mind. They would at least know\r\nthat the Church does not believe that it will be the instrument in the\r\nconversion of the Jews--a point on which Jewish leaders are tragically\r\nmisled and which evokes more bitterness than anything else--but that it\r\ndepends on quite other instruments and conditions, which it is not the\r\nfunction of this article to point out except to say that it will be the\r\nJews' very own Messiah which will accomplish it and not the \"wild\r\nolive,\" or the Gentile.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, there is a phase of anti-Semitism having to do with\r\nreligion, but not in the way here discussed. There are those, very few\r\nin number and of atheistical tendencies, who assert that all religion is\r\na sham, being the invention of Jews for the purpose of enslaving the\r\nminds of the people of the world to an enervating superstition. This\r\nposition, however, has had no effect on the main issue. It is a far\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNow, which of these exhibitions of anti-Semitism will show itself in\r\nAmerica? If certain tendencies continue, as they are certain to do, what\r\nform will the feeling toward the Jew take? Not that of mass violence, we\r\nmay be sure. The only mass action visible now is that of the Jewish\r\nagencies themselves against any person or institution that dares bring\r\nthe Jewish Question to public attention.\r\n\r\n1. Anti-Semitism will come to America because of the habit which\r\nemotions and ideas apparently have of making their way westward around\r\nthe world. North of Palestine, where the Jews have been longest settled\r\nand where they are now in great numbers, anti-Semitism is acute and\r\nwell-defined. Westward, in Germany, it is clearly defined but, until the\r\nseizure of German revolutionary agencies, was devoid of violence. Still\r\nfarther westward, in Great Britain, it is defined, but because of the\r\ncomparatively small number of Jews in the British Isles and their\r\ncoalition with the ruling class, it is more a feeling than a movement.\r\nIn the United States it is not so definite, but shows itself in a\r\nrestlessness, a questioning, a sensible friction between the traditional\r\ntendency of the American to fair-mindedness and his respect for the cold\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nBecause the Question will assume more and more pressure in America it\r\nbehooves everyone of foresight to disregard the shortsighted protests of\r\nthe Jews themselves and see to it that the Question shall not present\r\nitself among us as it has done among other people, in its most\r\ndistressing and confusing forms. It is a public duty to seize this\r\nproblem at its beginning and train it up, so to speak; that is, so\r\nprepare for it that it may be handled here in a manner which will form a\r\nmodel for all other countries, which will indeed supply all other\r\ncountries with the essential materials for a permanent solution. And\r\nthis can be done only by exposing and recognizing and treating with the\r\nserum of publicity the conditions before which, heretofore, the nations\r\nhave helplessly floundered because they lacked either the desire or the\r\nmeans to get at the great root of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n2. Another cause of the Question appearing here will be the great influx\r\nof Jews which is planned for America. There will probably be a million\r\nJews enter the country this year, increasing our Jewish population to\r\nnearly 4,500,000. This does not mean merely an immigration of persons,\r\nbut an immigration of ideas. No Jewish writer has ever told us, in\r\nsystematic fashion, just what is the Jews' idea of non-Jews, how they\r\nregard the Gentiles in their private minds. But there are indications of\r\nit, although one would not attempt to reconstruct the Jewish attitude\r\ntoward Gentiles. A Jew ought to do this for us, but he would probably be\r\ncast out by his own people if he discharged his task with rigorous\r\njealousy for the exact fact.\r\n\r\nThese people are coming here regarding the Gentile as an hereditary\r\nenemy, as perhaps they have good ground for doing, and so believing they\r\nare going to model their behavior in a manner that will show it. Nor\r\nwill these Jews be so helpless as they appear. In stricken Poland, where\r\nthe Jews are represented as having been stripped of everything during\r\nthe war, there are hundreds daily appearing before the consulate to\r\narrange their passage here. The fact is significant. In spite of their\r\nreputed suffering and poverty, they are able to travel a great distance\r\nand to insist on coming. No other people are financially able to travel\r\nin such numbers. But the Jews are. It will readily be seen that they are\r\nnot objects of charity. They have been able to keep afloat in a storm\r\nthat has wrecked the other people. They know it and they joy in it, as\r\nis natural. And they will bring here the same thoughts toward the\r\nmajority which they have harbored in their present lands of domicile.\r\nThey may hail America; they will have their own thoughts about the\r\nmajority of the American people. They may be in the lists as Russians or\r\nPoles or what not, but they will be Jews with the full Jewish\r\nconsciousness, and they will make themselves felt.\r\n\r\nAll this is bound to have its effect. And it is not race prejudice to\r\nprepare for it, and to invite American Jews themselves to consider the\r\nfact and contribute to the solution of the problem which it presents.\r\n\r\n3. Every idea which has ruled Europe has met with transformation when it\r\nwas transplanted in America. It was so with the idea of Liberty, the\r\nidea of Government, the idea of War. It will be so with the idea of\r\nanti-Semitism. The whole problem will center here and if we are wise and\r\ndo not shirk it, it will find its solution here. A recent Jewish writer\r\nhas said: \"Jewry today largely means American Jewry . . . . . . . . . .\r\nall former Jewish centers were demolished during the war and were\r\nshifted to America.\" The problem will be ours, whether we choose it or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAnd what course will it take? Much depends on what can be accomplished\r\nbefore it becomes very strong. It may be said, however, that the first\r\nelement to appear will be a show of resentment against certain Jewish\r\ncommercial successes, more particularly against the united action by\r\nwhich they are attained. Our people see the spectacle of a people in the\r\nmidst of a people, in a sense which the Mormons never were, and they\r\nwill not like it. The Mormons made an Exodus; Israel is going back into\r\nEgypt to subjugate it.\r\n\r\nThe second element which will undoubtedly appear is prejudice and its\r\nincitement. The majority may always be right, but they are not always\r\ninitially reasonable. That prejudice which exists now, and which is\r\nfreely admitted by both Jew and Gentile, may become more marked, to the\r\ndistress of both parties, for neither the subject nor the object of\r\nprejudice can attain that freedom of mind which is happiness.\r\n\r\nThen we may most confidently look for a reaction of Justice. It is here\r\nthat the whole matter will begin to bend to the genius of Americanism.\r\nThe innate justice of the American mind has come to the aid of every\r\nobject that ever roused American resentment. The natural reaction with\r\nus is of very brief duration; the intellectual and ethical reaction\r\nswiftly follows. The American mind will never rest with merely resenting\r\ncertain individuals. It will probe deeper. Already this deeper probe has\r\nbeen begun in Great Britain and America. We characteristically do not\r\nstop with persons when principles are in sight.\r\n\r\nAnd upon this there will be an investigation of materials, part of which\r\nmay yet be presented in this series and which may possibly be\r\ndisregarded for a time, but which at a future date will be found to be\r\nthe clue to the maze. Upon this, the root of all the trouble will be\r\nbared to the light, to die as all roots do when deprived of their\r\nconcealment of darkness, and then the Jewish people themselves may be\r\nexpected to begin an adjustment to the new order of things, not to lose\r\ntheir identity or to curtail their energy or to dim their brilliance,\r\nbut to turn all into more worthy channels for the benefit of all races,\r\nwhich alone can justify their claim to superiority. A race that can\r\nachieve in the material realm what the Jews have achieved while\r\nasserting themselves to be spiritually superior, can achieve in a less\r\nsordid, a less society-defying realm also.\r\n\r\nThe Jews will not be destroyed; neither will they be permitted to\r\nmaintain the yoke which they have been so skillful in fastening upon\r\nsociety. They are the beneficiaries of a system which itself will change\r\nand force them to other and higher devices to justify their proper place\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n[Issue of June 19, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We must force the Gentile governments to adopt measures which will\r\npromote our broadly conceived plan already approaching its triumphal\r\ngoal by bringing to bear the pressure of stimulated public opinion which\r\nhas in reality been organized by us with the help of the so-called\r\n'great power' of the Press. With few exceptions, not worth considering,\r\nit has already fallen into our hands.\"\r\n\r\n--The Seventh Protocol.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nJewish Question Breaks Into the Magazines\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time an American faculty member of an American university\r\nwent to Russia on business. He was expert in a very important department\r\nof applied science and a keen observer. He entered Russia with the\r\naverage American's feeling about the treatment which the government of\r\nthat people accorded the Jew. He lived there three years, came home for\r\na year, and went back again for a similar period, and upon his second\r\nreturn to America he thought it was time to give the American public\r\naccurate information about the Jewish Question in Russia. He prepared a\r\nmost careful article and sent it to the editor of a magazine of the\r\nfirst class in the Eastern United States. The editor sent for him, spent\r\nmost of two days with him, and was deeply impressed with all he\r\nlearned--but he said he could not print the article. The same interest\r\nand examination occurred with several other magazine editors of the\r\nfirst rank.\r\n\r\nIt was not because the professor could not write--these editors gladly\r\nbought anything he would write on other subjects. But it was impossible\r\nfor him to get his article on the Jews accepted or printed in New York.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Question, however, has at last broken into a New York\r\nmagazine. Rather it is a fragment of a shell hurled from the Jewish camp\r\nat the Jewish Question to demolish, if possible, the Question and thus\r\nmake good the assertion that there is no such thing.\r\n\r\nIncidentally it is the only kind of article on the Jewish Question that\r\nthe big magazines, whose mazes of financial controllers make most\r\ninteresting rummaging, would care to print.\r\n\r\nYet, the general public may learn much about the Question even from the\r\ntype of article whose purpose is to prove that the Question doesn't\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nMr. William Hard, in the Metropolitan for June, has done as well as\r\ncould be expected, considering the use he was supposed to make of such\r\nmaterial as he had at hand. And doubtless the telegraph and letter\r\nbrigades, which keep watch over all printed references to the Jews, have\r\nduly congratulated the good editors of the Metropolitan for their\r\nassistance in soothing the public to further sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped, for the sake of the Question, that Mr. Hard's effort\r\nwill have a wide reading, for there is very much to be learned from\r\nit--much more than it was anybody's intention should be learned from it.\r\n\r\nIt may be learned, first, that the Jewish Question exists. Mr. Hard says\r\nit is discussed in the drawing-rooms of London and Paris. Whether the\r\nmention of drawing-rooms was a writer's device to intimate that the\r\nmatter was unimportant and frivolous, or merely represented the extent\r\nof Mr. Hard's contact with the Question is not clear. He adds, however,\r\nthat a document relating to the Question has \"travelled a good bit in\r\ncertain official circles in Washington.\" He also mentions a cable\r\ndispatch to the New York World, concerning the same Question, which that\r\npaper published. His article was probably published too early to note\r\nthe review which the London Times made of the first document referred\r\nto. But he has told the reader who is looking for the objective facts in\r\nthe article that there is a Jewish Question, and that it does not exist\r\namong the riff-raff either but principally in those circles where the\r\nevidence of Jewish power and control is most abundant. Moreover, the\r\nQuestion is being discussed. Mr. Hard tells us that much. If he does not\r\ngo further and tell us that it is being discussed with great seriousness\r\nin high places and among men of national and international importance,\r\nit is probably because of one of two things, either he does not know, or\r\nhe does not consider it consonant with the purpose of the article to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Hard has already made it clear that there is a Jewish\r\nQuestion, that it is being discussed, that it is being discussed by\r\npeople who are best situated to observe the matter they are talking\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe reading of Mr. Hard's article makes it clear also that the Question\r\nalways comes to the fore on the note of conspiracy. Of course, Mr. Hard\r\nsays he does not believe in conspiracies which involve a large number of\r\npeople, and it is with the utmost ease that his avowal of unbelief is\r\naccepted, for there is nothing more ridiculous to the Gentile mind than\r\na mass conspiracy, because there is nothing more impossible to the\r\nGentile himself. Mr. Hard, we take it, is of non-Jewish extraction, and\r\nhe knows how impossible it would be to band Gentiles together in any\r\nconsiderable number for any length of time in even the noblest\r\nconspiracy. Gentiles are not built for it. Their conspiracy, whatever it\r\nmight be, would fall like a rope of sand. Gentiles have not the basis\r\neither in blood or interest that the Jews have to stand together. The\r\nGentile does not naturally suspect conspiracy; he will indeed hardly\r\nbring himself to the verge of believing it without the fullest proof.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore quite easy to understand Mr. Hard's difficulty with\r\nconspiracy; the point is that to write his article at all, he is forced\r\nto recognize at almost every step that whenever the Jewish Question is\r\ndiscussed, the idea of conspiracy occupies a large part in it. As a\r\nmatter of fact, it is the central idea in Mr. Hard's article, and it\r\ncompletely monopolizes the heading--\"Great Jewish Conspiracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe search for basic facts in Mr. Hard's article will disclose the\r\nadditional information that there are certain documents in existence\r\nwhich purport to contain the details of the conspiracy, or--to drop a\r\nword that is unpleasant and may be misleading and which has not been\r\nused in this series--the tendency of Jewish power to achieve complete\r\ncontrol. That is about all that the reader learns from Mr. Hard about\r\nthe documents, except that he describes one as \"strange and horrible.\"\r\nHere is indeed a regrettable gap in the story, for it is to discredit a\r\ncertain document that Mr. Hard writes, and yet he tells next to nothing\r\nabout it. Discreditable documents usually discredit themselves. But this\r\ndocument is not permitted to do that. The reader of the article is left\r\nto take Mr. Hard's word for it. The serious student or critic will feel,\r\nof course, that the documents themselves would have formed a better\r\nbasis for an intelligent judgement. But laying that matter aside, Mr.\r\nHard has made public the fact that there are documents.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Hard does another thing, as well as he can with the\r\nmaterials at hand, the purpose of the article being what it was, and\r\nthat is to show how little the Jews have to do with the control of\r\naffairs by showing who are the Jews that do control certain selected\r\ngroups of affairs. The names are all brought forward by Mr. Hard and he\r\nalone is responsible for them, our purpose in referring to them being\r\nmerely to show what can be learned from him.\r\n\r\nMr. Hard leans heavily on Russian affairs. Sometimes it would almost\r\nseem as if the Jewish Question were conceived as the Soviet Question,\r\nwhich it is not, as Mr. Hard very well knows, and although the two have\r\ntheir plain connections, it is nothing less than well-defined propaganda\r\nto set up Bolshevist fiction and knock it down by Jewish fact for the\r\npurpose of the latter. However, what Mr. Hard offers as fact is very\r\ninstructive, quite apart from the conclusion which he draws from it.\r\n\r\nNow, take his Russian line-up first. He says that in the cabinet of\r\nSoviet Russia there is only one Jew. But he is Trotsky. There are others\r\nin the government, of course, but Mr. Hard is speaking about the cabinet\r\nnow. He is not speaking about the commissars, who are the real rulers of\r\nRussia, nor about the executive troops, who are the real strength of the\r\nTrotsky-Lenin regime. No, just the cabinet. Of course, there was only\r\none Jew prominent in Hungary, too, but he was Bela Kun. Mr. Hard does\r\nnot ask us to believe, however, that it is simply because of Trotsky and\r\nKun that all Europe believes that Bolshevism has a strong Jewish\r\nelement. Else the stupid credibility of the Gentiles would be more\r\nimpossible of conception than the idea of a Jewish conspiracy is to Mr.\r\nHard's mind. Why should it be easier to believe that Gentiles are dunces\r\nthan that Jews are clever?\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not too much to say that Trotsky is way up at the top,\r\nsharing the utmost summit of Bolshevism with Lenin, and Trotsky is a\r\nJew--nobody ever denied that, not even Mr. Braunstein himself (the\r\nlatter being Trotsky's St. Louis, U.S.A., name).\r\n\r\nBut then, says Mr. Hard, the Mensheviks are led by Jews, too! That is a\r\nfact worth putting down beside the others. Trotsky at the head of the\r\nBolsheviks; at the head of the Mensheviks during their opposition of the\r\nBolsheviks were Leiber, Martov and Dan--\"all Jews,\" says Mr. Hard.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a middle party between these extremes, the Cadets,\r\nwhich, Mr. Hard says, are or were the strongest bourgeois political\r\nparty in Russia. \"They now have their headquarters in Paris. Their\r\nchairman is Vinaver--a Jew.\"\r\n\r\nThere are the facts as stated by Mr. Hard. He says that Jews, whose\r\nnames he gives, head the three great divisions of political opinion in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nAnd then he cries, look how the Jews are divided! How can there be\r\nconspiracy among people who thus fight themselves?\r\n\r\nBut another, looking at the same situation may say, look how the Jews\r\ncontrol every phase of political opinion in Russia! Doesn't there seem\r\nto be some ground for the feeling that they are desirous of ruling\r\neverywhere?\r\n\r\nThe facts are there. What significance does it bring to the average mind\r\nthat the three great parties of Russia are led by Jews?\r\n\r\nBut that does not exhaust the information which the matter-of-fact\r\nreader may find in Mr. Hard's article. He turns to the United States and\r\nmakes several interesting statements.\r\n\r\n\"There is Otto Kahn,\" he says. Well, sometimes Otto Kahn is there, and\r\nsometimes he is in Paris on important international matters, and\r\nsometimes he is in London advocating certain alliances between British\r\nand American capital which have to do in a large way with European\r\npolitical conditions. Mr. Kahn is rated as a conservative, and that may\r\nmean anything. A man is conservative or not according to the angle from\r\nwhich he is viewed. The most conservative men in America are really the\r\nmost radical; their motives and methods go to the very roots of certain\r\nmatters; they are radicals in their own field. The men who controlled\r\nthe last Republican Convention--if not the last, the most recent--are\r\nstyled conservatives by those whose vision is circumscribed by certain\r\nlimited economic interests; but they are the most radical of radicals,\r\nthey have passed the red stage and are white with it. If it were known\r\nwhat is in the back of Mr. Kahn's mind, if he should display a chart of\r\nwhat he is doing and aiming to do, the term which would then most aptly\r\ndescribe him might be quite different. Anyway, we have it from Mr. Hard,\r\n\"There is Mr. Kahn.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand,\" says Mr. Hard, \"there is Rose Pastor Stokes.\" He\r\nadds the name of Morris Hillquit. They are, in Mr. Hard's\r\nclassification, radicals. And to offset these names he adds the names of\r\ntwo Gentiles, Eugene V. Debs and Bill Haywood and intimates that they\r\nare much more powerful leaders than the first two. Students of modern\r\ninfluences, of which Mr. Hard has long appeared as one, do not think so.\r\nNeither Debs nor Haywood ever generated in all their lives a fraction of\r\nthe intellectual power which Mrs. Stokes and Mr. Hillquit have\r\ngenerated. Both Debs and Haywood live by the others. To every informed\r\nperson, as to Mr. Hard in this article, come the Jewish names to mind\r\nwhen the social tendencies of the United States are passed under\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nThis is most instructive indeed, that in naming the leaders of so-called\r\nconservatism and radicalism, Mr. Hard is driven to use Jewish names. On\r\nhis showing the reader is entitled to say that Jews lead both divisions\r\nhere in the United States.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hard is not through. \"The man who does more than any other\r\nman--the man who does more than any regiment of other men--to keep\r\nAmerican labor anti-radical is a Jew--Samuel Gompers.\" That is a fact\r\nwhich the reader will place in his list--American labor is led by a Jew.\r\n\r\nWell, then, \"the strongest anti-Gompers trade union in the country--The\r\nAmalgamated Clothing Workers--and very strong indeed, and very large--is\r\nled by a Jew--Sidney Hillman.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the Russian situation over again. Both ends of the movements, and\r\nthe movement which operate within the movement, are under the leadership\r\nof Jews. This, whatever the construction put upon it, is a fact which\r\nMr. Hard is compelled by the very nature of his task to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd the middle movement, \"the Liberal Middle\" as Mr. Hard calls it,\r\nwhich catches all between, produces in this article the names of Mr.\r\nJustice Brandeis, Judge Mack and Felix Frankfurter, gentlemen whose\r\nactivities since Armistice Day would make a very interesting story.\r\n\r\nFor good measure, Mr. Hard produces two other names, \"Baron Gunzberg--a\r\nJew\" who is \"a faithful official\" of the Russian Embassy of Ambassador\r\nBakhmetev, a repesentative of the modified old regime, while the Russian\r\nInformation Bureau, whose literary output appears in many of our\r\nnewspapers is conducted by another Jew, so Mr. Hard calls him, whose\r\nname is familiar to newspaper readers, Mr. A. J. Sack.\r\n\r\nIt is not a complete list by any means, but it is quite impressive. It\r\nseems to reflect importance on the documents which Mr. Hard endeavors to\r\nminimize to a position of ridiculous unimportance. And it leads to the\r\nthought that perhaps the documents are scrutinized as carefully as they\r\nare because the readers of them have observed not only the facts which\r\nMr. Hard admits but other and more astonishing ones, and have discovered\r\nthat the documents confirm and explain the observations. Other readers\r\nwho have not had the privilege of learning all that the documents\r\ncontain are entitled to have satisfaction given to the interest thus\r\naroused.\r\n\r\nThe documents did not create the Jewish Question. If there were nothing\r\nbut the documents, Mr. Hard would not have written nor would the\r\nMetropolitan Magazine have printed the article here discussed.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Hard has done is to bring confirmation in a most unexpected\r\nplace that the Question exists and is pressing for discussion. Someone\r\nfelt the pressure when \"The Great Jewish Conspiracy\" was ordered and\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n[Issue of June 26, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What are you prating about?

We must control\r\nor influence the papers of the whole world in order to blind and deceive\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n--Baron Montefiore.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nArthur Brisbane Leaps to the Help of Jewry\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more the current of this series on the Modern Jewish Question is\r\ninterrupted to give notice of the appearance of the Question in another\r\nquarter, the appearance this time consisting of a more than two-column\r\n\"Today\" editorial in the Hearst papers of Sunday, June 20, from the pen\r\nof Arthur Brisbane. It would be too much to say that Mr. Brisbane is the\r\nmost influential writer in the country, but perhaps he is among the\r\ndozen most widely read. It is, therefore, a confirmation of the\r\nstatement that the Question is assuming importance in this country, that\r\na writer of Mr. Brisbane's prominence should openly discuss it.\r\n\r\nOf course, Mr. Brisbane has not studied the Question. He would probably\r\nadmit in private conversation--though such an admission would hardly be\r\nin harmony with the tone of certainty he publicly adopts--that he really\r\nknows nothing about it. He knows, however, as a good newspaper man, how\r\nto handle it when the exigencies of the newspaper day throw it up to him\r\nfor offhand treatment. Every editorial writer knows how to do that.\r\nThere is something good in every race, or there have been some notable\r\nindividuals in it, or it has played a picturesque part in history--that\r\nis enough for a very readable editorial upon any class of people who may\r\nhappen to be represented in the community. The Question, whatever it may\r\nbe, need not be studied at all; a certain group of people may be salved\r\nfor a few paragraphs, and the job need never be tackled again. Every\r\nnewspaper man knows that.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, having lived in New York for a long time, having had financial\r\ndealings of a large and obligating nature with certain interests in this\r\ncountry, having seen no doubt more or less of the inner workings of the\r\ngreat trust and banking groups, and being constantly surrounded by\r\nassistants and advisors who are members of the Jewish race, Mr. Brisbane\r\nmust have had his thoughts. It is, however, no part of a newspaper man's\r\nbusiness to expose his thoughts about the racial groups of his\r\ncommunity, any more than it is a showman's business to express his\r\nopinion of the patrons of his show. The kinds of offense a newspaper\r\nwill give, and the occasions on which it will feel justified in giving\r\nit, are very limited.\r\n\r\nSo, assuming that Mr. Brisbane had to write at all, it could have been\r\ntold beforehand what he would write. The only wonder is that he felt he\r\nhad to write. Did he really feel that the Jews are being \"persecuted\"\r\nwhen an attempt is made to uncover the extent and causes of their\r\ncontrol in the United States and elsewhere? Did he feel, with good\r\neditorial shrewdness, that here was an opportunity to win the attention\r\nand regard of the most influential group in New York and the nation?\r\nOr--and this seems within the probabilities--was he inclined simply to\r\npass it over, until secretarial suggestions reached him for a Sunday\r\neditorial, or until some of the bondholders made their wishes known?\r\nThis is not at all to impugn Mr. Brisbane's motives, but merely to\r\nindicate on what slender strings such an editorial may depend.\r\n\r\nBut what is more important--does Mr. Brisbane consider that, having\r\ndisposed of the Sunday editorial, he is through with the Question, or\r\nthat the Question itself is solved? That is the worst of daily\r\neditorializing; having come safely and inoffensively through with one\r\neditorial, the matter is at an end as far as that particular writer is\r\nconcerned--that is, as a usual thing.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that Mr. Brisbane is not through. He ought not to\r\nleave a big question without contributing something to it, and in his\r\nSunday editorial he did not contribute anything. He even made mistakes\r\nwhich he ought to correct by further study. \"What about the\r\nPhoenicians?\" he asks. He should have looked that up while his mind was\r\nopened receptively toward the subject, and he would not have made so\r\nmiserable a blunder as to connect them so closely with the Jews. He\r\nwould never find a Jew doing that. It is permissible, however, in Jewish\r\npropaganda intended for Gentile consumption. The Phoenicians themselves\r\ncertainly never thought they were connected in any way with the Jews,\r\nand the Jews were equally without light on the subject. If in nothing\r\nelse, they differed in their attitude toward the sea. The Phoenicians\r\nnot only built boats but manned them; the Jew would rather risk his\r\ninvestment in a boat than himself. In everything else the differences\r\nbetween the two peoples were deep and distinct. Mr. Brisbane should have\r\nturned up the Jewish Encyclopedia at that point in his dictation. It is\r\nto be hoped he will resume his study and when he has found something\r\nthat is not printed in \"simply written\" Jewish books will give the world\r\nthe benefit of it. It is hardly like the question of the rotundity of\r\nthe earth; this Question is not settled and it will be discussed.\r\n\r\nMr. Brisbane is in a position to pursue some investigations of his own\r\non this subject. He has a large staff, and it is presumed that some of\r\nits members are Gentiles of unbiased minds; he has a world-wide\r\norganization; since his own modification of speech and views following\r\nupon his adventure in the money-making world, he has a \"look-in\" upon\r\ncertain groups of men and certain tendencies of power--why does he not\r\ntake the Question as a world problem and go after the facts and the\r\nsolution?\r\n\r\nIt is a task worthy of any newspaper organization. It will assist\r\nAmerica to make the contribution which she must make if this Question is\r\never to be turned from the bugbear it has been through all the\r\ncenturies. All the talk on earth about \"loving our fellow men\" will not\r\nserve in lieu of an investigation, because it is asking men to love\r\nthose who are rapidly and insidiously gaining the mastery of them.\r\n\"What's wrong with the Jew?\" is the first question, and then, \"What's\r\nwrong with the Gentile to make it possible?\"\r\n\r\nAs in the case of every Gentile writer who appears as the Jew's\r\ngood-natured defender, Mr. Brisbane is compelled to state a number of\r\nfacts which comprise a part of the very Question whose existence is\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n\"Every other successful name you see in a great city is a Jewish name,\"\r\nsays Mr. Brisbane. In his own city the ratio is even higher than that.\r\n\r\n\"Jews numbering less than one per cent of the earth's population possess\r\nby conquest, enterprise, industry and intelligence 50 per cent of the\r\nworld's commercial success,\" says Mr. Brisbane.\r\n\r\nDoes it mean anything to Mr. Brisbane? Has he ever thought how it will\r\nall turn out? Is he willing to absolve that \"success\" from every quality\r\nwhich humanity has a right to challenge? Is he entirely satisfied with\r\nthe way that \"success\" is used where it is supreme? Would he be willing\r\nto undertake to prove that it is due to those commendable qualities he\r\nhas named and nothing less commendable? Speaking of the Jew-financed\r\nHarriman railroad campaign, is Mr. Brisbane ready to write his\r\nendorsement upon that? Did he ever hear of Jewish money backing\r\nrailroads that were built for railroad purposes and nothing else?\r\n\r\nIt would be very easy to suggest to Mr. Brisbane, as editor, a series of\r\narticles which would be most enlightening, both to himself and his\r\nreaders, if he would only put unbiased men at work gathering the facts\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nOne of the articles might be entitled \"The Jews at the Peace\r\nConference.\" His men should be instructed to learn who were the most\r\nprominent figures at the Peace Conference; who came and went most\r\nconstantly and most busily; who were given freest access to the most\r\nimportant persons and chambers; which race provided the bulk of the\r\nprivate secretaries to the important personages there; which race\r\nprovided most of the sentinels through whom engagements had to be made\r\nwith men of note; which race went furthest in the endeavor to turn the\r\nwhole proceeding into a festival rout by dances and lavish\r\nentertainment; which civilians of prominence oftenest dined the leading\r\nconferees in private session.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Brisbane, with the genius for reporting which his organization\r\ndeservedly has, will turn his men loose on that assignment, and then\r\nprint what they bring him, he will have a story that will make a mark\r\neven in his remarkable career as an editor.\r\n\r\nHe might even run a second story on the Peace Conference, entitled,\r\n\"Which Program Won at the Peace Conference?\" He might instruct his men\r\nto inquire as to the business which brought the Jews in such quality and\r\nquantity to Paris, and how it was put through. Particularly should they\r\ninquire whether any jot or tittle of the Jews' world program was refused\r\nor modified by the Peace Conference. It should also be carefully\r\ninquired whether, after getting what they went after, they did not ask\r\nfor still more and get that, too, even though it constituted a\r\ndiscrimination against the rest of the world. Mr. Brisbane would\r\ndoubtless be surprised to learn that of all the programs submitted to\r\nthat Conference, not excepting the great program on which humanity hung\r\nso many pathetic hopes, the only program to go through was the Jews'\r\nprogram. And yet he could learn just that if he inquired. The question\r\nis, having obtained that information, what would Mr. Brisbane do with\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThere are any number of lines of investigation Mr. Brisbane might enter,\r\nand in any one of them his knowledge of his country and of its relation\r\nto this particular Question would be greatly enlarged.\r\n\r\nDoes Mr. Brisbane know who owns Alaska? He may have been under the\r\nimpression, in common with the rest of us until we learned better, that\r\nit was owned by the United States. No, it is owned by the same people\r\nwho are coming rapidly to own the United States.\r\n\r\nIs Mr. Brisbane, from the vantage point afforded by his position in\r\nnational journalism, even dimly aware that there are elements in our\r\nindustrial unrest which neither \"capital\" nor \"labor\" accurately define?\r\nHas he ever caught a glimpse of another power which is neither \"labor\"\r\nnor \"capital\" in the productive sense, whose purpose and interest it is\r\nto keep labor and capital as far apart as possible, now by provoking\r\nlabor, now by provoking capital? In his study of the industrial\r\nsituation and its perfectly baffling mystery, Mr. Brisbane must have\r\ncaught a flash of something behind the backmost scene. It would be good\r\njournalistic enterprise to find out what it is.\r\n\r\nHas Mr. Brisbane ever printed the name of the men who control the sugar\r\nsupply of the United States--does he know them--would he like to know\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nHas he ever looked into the woolen situation in this country, from the\r\nchange of ownership in cotton lands, and the deliberate sabotage of\r\ncotton production by banking threats, right on through to the change in\r\nthe price of cloth and clothing? And has he ever noted the names of the\r\nmen he found on that piece of investigation? Would he like to know how\r\nit is done, and who does it? Mr. Brisbane could find all these things\r\nand give them to the public by using his efficient staff of\r\ninvestigators and writers on this Question.\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Brisbane would feel free to do this, he himself best knows.\r\nThere may be reasons why he would not, private reasons, prudential\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, there are no reasons why he should not make a\r\ncomplete study of the Question--a real study, not a superficial glance\r\nat it with an eye to its \"news value\"--and arrive at his own considered\r\nconclusion. There would be no intolerance about that. As it is now, Mr.\r\nBrisbane is not qualified to take a stand on either side of the\r\nQuestion; he simply brushes it aside as troublesome, as the old planters\r\nused brush aside the anti-slavery moralists; and for that reason the\r\nrecent defense of the Jew is not a defense at all. It is more like a bid\r\nfor favor.\r\n\r\nMr. Brisbane's chief aversion, apparently, is toward what he calls race\r\nprejudice and race hatred. Of course, if any man should fear that the\r\nstudy of an economic situation would plunge him into these serious\r\naberrations of mind, he should be advised to avoid that line of study.\r\nThere is something wrong either with the investigation or with the\r\ninvestigator when prejudice and hatred are the result. It is a mighty\r\npoor excuse, however, for an intelligent man to put forward either on\r\nhis own behalf or on behalf of those whose minds he has had the\r\nprivilege of molding over a course of years.\r\n\r\nPrejudice and hatred are the very conditions which a scientific study of\r\nthe Jewish Question will forestall and prevent. We prejudge what we do\r\nnot know, and we hate what we do not understand; the study of the Jewish\r\nQuestion will bring knowledge and insight, and not to the Gentile only,\r\nbut also to the Jew. The Jew needs this as much, even more than the\r\nGentile. For if the Jew can be made to see, understand, and deal with\r\ncertain matters, then a large part of the Question vanishes in the\r\nsolution of ideal common sense. Awaking the Gentile to the facts about\r\nthe Jew is only part of the work; awaking the Jew to the facts about the\r\nQuestion is an indispensable part. The big initial victory to be\r\nachieved is to transform Gentiles from being mere attackers and to\r\ntransform Jews from being mere defenders, both of them special pleaders\r\nfor partisan views, and to turn them both into investigators. The\r\ninvestigation will show both Gentile and Jew at fault, and the road will\r\nthen be clear for wisdom to work out a result, if there should perchance\r\nbe that much wisdom left in the race.\r\n\r\nThere is a serious snare in all this plea for tolerance. Tolerance is\r\nfirst a tolerance of the truth. Tolerance is urged today for the sake of\r\nsuppression. There can be no tolerance until there is first a full\r\nunderstanding of what is tolerated. Ignorance, suppression, silence,\r\ncollusion--these are not tolerance. The Jew never has been really\r\ntolerated in the higher sense because he has never been understood. Mr.\r\nBrisbane does not assist the understanding of this people by reading a\r\n\"simply written\" book and flinging a few Jewish names about in a sea of\r\ntype. He owes it to his own mind to get into the Question, whether he\r\nmakes newspaper use of his discoveries or not.\r\n\r\nAs to the newspaper angle, it is impossible to report the world even\r\nsuperficially without coming everywhere against the fact of the Jews,\r\nand the Press gets around that fact by referring to them as Russians,\r\nLetts, Germans, and Englishmen. This mask of names is one of the most\r\nconfusing elements in the whole problem. Names that actually name,\r\nstatements that actually define are needed for the clarification of the\r\nworld's mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Brisbane should study this question for the light such a study would\r\nthrow on other matters with which he is concerned. It would be a help to\r\nthat study if from time to time he would publish some of his findings,\r\nbecause such publication would put him in touch with a phase of Judaism\r\nwhich mere complimentary editorials could not. No doubt Mr. Brisbane has\r\nbeen deluged by communications which praise him for what he has written;\r\nthe real eye-opener would come if he could get several bushels of the\r\nother kind. Nothing that has ever come to him could compare with what\r\nwould come to him if he should publish even one of the facts he could\r\ndiscover by an independent investigation.\r\n\r\nHaving written about the Jews, Mr. Brisbane will probably have a readier\r\neye henceforth for other men's pronouncements on the same subject. In\r\nhis casual reading he will find more references to the Jew than he has\r\never noticed before. Some of them will probably appear in isolated\r\nsentences and paragraphs of his own papers. Sooner or later, every\r\ncompetent investigator and every honest writer strikes a trail that\r\nleads toward Jewish power in the world. THE DEARBORN INDEPENDENT is only\r\ndoing with system and detail what other publications have done or are\r\ndoing piecemeal.\r\n\r\nThere is a real fear of the Jew upon the publicity sources of the United\r\nStates--a fear which is felt and which ought to be analyzed. Unless it\r\nis a very great mistake, Mr. Brisbane himself has felt this fear, though\r\nit is quite possible he has not scrutinized it. It is not the fear of\r\ndoing injustice to a race of people--all of us ought to have that\r\nhonorable fear--it is the fear of doing anything at all with reference\r\nto them except unstintedly praising them. An independent investigation\r\nwould convince Mr. Brisbane that a considerable modification of praise\r\nin favor of discriminate criticism is a course that is pressing upon\r\nAmerican journalism.\r\n\r\n[Issue of July 3, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nDoes a Definite Jewish World Program Exist?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the explanations of anti-Jewish feeling which modern Jewish\r\nspokesmen make, these three alleged causes are commonly given--these\r\nthree and no more: religious prejudice, economic jealousy, social\r\nantipathy. Whether the Jew knows it or not, every Gentile knows that on\r\nhis side of the Jewish Question no religious prejudice exists. Economic\r\njealousy may exist, at least to this extent, that his uniform success\r\nhas exposed the Jew to much scrutiny. A few Jewish spokesmen seek to\r\nturn this scrutiny by denying that the Jew is pre-eminent in finance,\r\nbut this is loyalty in extremity. The finances of the world are in\r\ncontrol of Jews; their decisions and their devices are themselves our\r\neconomic law. But because a people excels us in finance is no sufficient\r\nreason for calling them to the bar of public judgement. If they are more\r\nintellectually able, more persistently industrious than we are, if they\r\nare endowed with faculties which have been denied us as an inferior or\r\nslower race, that is no reason for our requiring them to give an account\r\nof themselves. Economic jealousy may explain some of the anti-Jewish\r\nfeeling; it cannot account for the presence of the Jewish Question\r\nexcept as the hidden causes of Jewish financial success may become a\r\nminor element of the larger problem. And as for social antipathy--there\r\nare many more undesirable Gentiles in the world than there are\r\nundesirable Jews, for the simple reason that there are more Gentiles.\r\n\r\nNone of the Jewish spokesmen today mention the political cause, or if\r\nthey come within suggestive distance of it, they limit and localize it.\r\nIt is not a question of the patriotism of the Jew, though this too is\r\nvery widely questioned in all the countries. You hear it in England, in\r\nFrance, in Germany, in Poland, in Russia, in Rumania--and, with a shock,\r\nyou hear it in the United States. Books have been written, reports\r\npublished and scattered abroad, statistics skillfully set forth for the\r\npurpose of showing that the Jew does his part for the country in which\r\nhe resides; and yet the fact remains that in spite of these most zealous\r\nand highly sponsored campaigns, the opposite assertion is stronger and\r\nlives longer. The Jews who did their duty in the armies of Liberty, and\r\ndid it doubtless from true-hearted love and allegiance, have not been\r\nable to overcome the impression made upon officers and men and civilians\r\nby those who did not.\r\n\r\nBut that is not what is here meant as the political element in the\r\nJewish Question. To understand why the Jew should think less of the\r\nnationalities of the world than do those who comprise them is not\r\ndifficult. The Jew's history is one of wandering among them all.\r\nConsidering living individuals only, there is no race of people now upon\r\nthe planet who have lived in so many places, among so many peoples as\r\nhave the Jewish masses. They have a clearer world-sense than any other\r\npeople, because the world has been their path. And they think in world\r\nterms more than any nationally cloistered people could. The Jew can be\r\nabsolved if he does not enter into national loyalties and prejudices\r\nwith the same intensity as the natives; the Jew has been for centuries a\r\ncosmopolitan. While under a flag he may be correct in the conduct\r\nrequired of him as a citizen or resident, inevitably he has a view of\r\nflags which can hardly be shared by the man who has known but one flag.\r\n\r\nThe political element inheres in the fact that the Jews form a nation in\r\nthe midst of the nations. Some of their spokesmen, particularly in\r\nAmerica, deny that, but the genius of the Jew himself has always put\r\nthese spokesmen's zeal to shame. And why this fact of nationhood should\r\nbe so strenuously denied is not always clear. It may be that when Israel\r\nis brought to see that her mission in the world is not to be achieved by\r\nmeans of the Golden Calf, her very cosmopolitanism with regard to the\r\nworld and her inescapable nationalistic integrity with regard to herself\r\nwill together prove a great and serviceable factor in bringing about\r\nhuman unity, which the total Jewish tendency at the present time is\r\ndoing much to prevent. It is not the fact that the Jews remain a nation\r\nin the midst of the nations; it is the use made of that inescapable\r\nstatus, which the world has found reprehensible. The nations have tried\r\nto reduce the Jew to unity with themselves; attempts toward the same end\r\nhave been made by the Jews themselves; but destiny seems to have marked\r\nthem out to continuous nationhood. Both the Jews and the World will have\r\nto accept that fact, find the good prophecy in it, and seek the channels\r\nfor its fulfillment.\r\n\r\nTheodor Herzl, one of the greatest of the Jews, was perhaps the\r\nfarthest-seeing public exponent of the philosophy of Jewish existence\r\nthat modern generations have known. And he was never in doubt of the\r\nexistence of the Jewish nation. Indeed, he proclaimed its existence on\r\nevery occasion. He said, \"We are a people--One people.\"\r\n\r\nHe clearly saw that what he called the Jewish Question was political. In\r\nhis introduction to \"The Jewish State\" he says, \"I believe that I\r\nunderstand anti-Semitism, which is really a highly complex movement. I\r\nconsider it from a Jewish standpoint, yet without fear or hatred. I\r\nbelieve that I can see what elements there are in it of vulgar sport, of\r\ncommon trade jealousy, of inherited prejudice, of religious intolerance\r\nand also of pretended self-defense. I think the Jewish Question is no\r\nmore a social than a religious one, notwithstanding that it sometimes\r\ntakes these and other forms. It is a national question, which can only\r\nbe solved by making it a political world-question to be discussed and\r\ncontrolled by the civilized nations of the world in council.\"\r\n\r\nNot only did Herzl declare that the Jews formed a nation, but when\r\nquestioned by Major Evans Gordon before the British Royal Commission on\r\nAlien Immigration in August, 1902, Dr. Herzl said: \"I will give you my\r\ndefinition of a nation, and you can add the adjective 'Jewish.' A nation\r\nis, in my mind, an historical group of men of a recognizable cohesion\r\nheld together by a common enemy. That is in my view a nation. Then if\r\nyou add to that the word 'Jewish' you have what I understand to be the\r\nJewish nation.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, in relating the action of this Jewish nation to the world, Dr.\r\nHerzl wrote--\"When we sink, we become a revolutionary proletariat, the\r\nsubordinate officers of the revolutionary party; when we rise, there\r\nrises also our terrible power of the purse.\"\r\n\r\nThis view, which appears to be the true view in that it is the view\r\nwhich has been longest sustained in Jewish thought, is brought out also\r\nby Lord Eustace Percy, and re-published, apparently with approval, by\r\nthe Canadian Jewish Chronicle. It will repay a careful reading:\r\n\r\n\"Liberalism and Nationalism, with a flourish of trumpets, threw open the\r\ndoors of the ghetto and offered equal citizenship to the Jew. The Jew\r\npassed out into the Western World, saw the power and the glory of it,\r\nused it and enjoyed it, laid his hand indeed upon the nerve centers of\r\nits civilization, guided, directed and exploited it, and then--refused\r\nthe offer * * * Moreover--and this is a remarkable thing--the Europe of\r\nnationalism and liberalism, of scientific government and democratic\r\nequality is more intolerable to him than the old oppressions and\r\npersecutions of despotism * * * In the increasing consolidation of the\r\nwestern nations, it is no longer possible to reckon on complete\r\ntoleration * * *\r\n\r\n\"In a world of completely organized territorial sovereignties he (the\r\nJew) has only two possible cities of refuge: he must either pull down\r\nthe pillars of the whole national state system or he must create a\r\nterritorial sovereignty of his own. In this perhaps lies the explanation\r\nboth of Jewish Bolshevism and of Zionism, for at this moment Eastern\r\nJewry seems to hover uncertainly between the two.\r\n\r\n\"In Eastern Europe Bolshevism and Zionism often seem to grow side by\r\nside, just as Jewish influence molded Republican and Socialist thought\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century, down to the Young Turk revolution in\r\nConstantinople hardly more than a decade ago--not because the Jew cares\r\nfor the positive side of radical philosophy, not because he desires to\r\nbe a partaker in Gentile nationalism or Gentile democracy, but because\r\nno existing Gentile system of government is ever anything but\r\ndistasteful to him.\"\r\n\r\nAll that is true, and Jewish thinkers of the more fearless type always\r\nrecognize it as true. The Jew is against the Gentile scheme of things.\r\nHe is, when he gives his tendencies full sway, a Republican as against\r\nthe monarchy, a Socialist as against the republic, and a Bolshevist as\r\nagainst Socialism.\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes of this disruptive activity? First, his essential\r\nlack of democracy. Jewish nature is autocratic. Democracy is all right\r\nfor the rest of the world, but the Jew wherever he is found forms an\r\naristocracy of one sort or another. Democracy is merely a tool of a word\r\nwhich Jewish agitators use to raise themselves to the ordinary level in\r\nplaces where they are oppressed below it; but having reached the common\r\nlevel they immediately make efforts for special privileges, as being\r\nentitled to them--a process of which the late Peace Conference will\r\nremain the most startling example. The Jews today are the only people\r\nwhose special and extraordinary privileges are written into the world's\r\nTreaty of Peace. But more of that at another time.\r\n\r\nNo one now pretends to deny, except a few spokesmen who really do not\r\nrule the thought of the Jews but are set forth for the sole benefit of\r\ninfluencing Gentile thought, that the socially and economically\r\ndisruptive elements abroad in the world today are not only manned but\r\nalso moneyed by Jewish interests. For a long time this fact was held in\r\nsuspense owing to the vigorous denial of the Jews and the lack of\r\ninformation on the part of those agencies of publicity to which the\r\npublic had looked for its information. But now the facts are coming\r\nforth. Herzl's words are being proved to be true--\"when we sink, we\r\nbecome a revolutionary proletariat, the subordinate officers of the\r\nrevolutionary party\"--and these words were first published in English in\r\n1896, or 24 years ago.\r\n\r\nJust now these tendencies are working in two directions, one for the\r\ntearing down of the Gentile states all over the world, and the other for\r\nthe establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. The latter project has\r\nthe best wishes of the whole world, but it is far from having the best\r\nwishes of the whole, or even the larger part, of Jewry. The Zionist\r\nparty makes a great deal of noise, but it is really an unrepresentative\r\nminority. It can scarcely be designated as more than an unusually\r\nambitious colonization scheme. [See note on page 95.] It is doubtless\r\nserving, however, as a very useful public screen for the carrying on of\r\nsecret activities. International Jews, the controllers of the world's\r\ngovernmental and financial power, may meet anywhere, at any time, in war\r\ntime or peace time, and by giving out that they are only considering the\r\nways and means of opening up Palestine to the Jews, they easily escape\r\nthe suspicion of being together on any other business. The Allies and\r\nenemies of the Gentile nations at war thus met and were not molested. It\r\nwas at a Zionist conference--the sixth, held in 1903--that the recent\r\nwar was exactly predicted, its progress and outcome indicated, and the\r\nrelation of the Jews to the Peace Treaty outlined.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, though Jewish nationalism exists, its enshrinement in a\r\nstate to be set up in Palestine is not the project that is engaging the\r\nwhole Jewish nation now. The Jews will not move to Palestine just yet;\r\nit may be said that they will not move at all merely because of the\r\nZionist movement. Quite another motive will be the cause of the exodus\r\nout of the Gentile nations, when the time for that exodus fully comes.\r\n\r\nAs Donald A. Cameron, late British Consul-General at Alexandria, a man\r\nfully in sympathy with Zionism and much quoted in the Jewish press,\r\nsays: \"The Jewish immigrants (into Palestine) will tire of taking in one\r\nanother's washing at three per cent, of winning one another's money in\r\nthe family, and their sons will hasten by train and steamer to win 10\r\nper cent in Egypt * * * The Jew by himself in Palestine will eat his\r\nhead off; he will kick his stable to pieces.\" Undoubtedly the time for\r\nthe exodus--at least the motive for the exodus--is not yet here.\r\n\r\nThe political aspect of the Jewish Question which is now engaging at\r\nleast three of the great nations--France, Great Britain and the United\r\nStates--has to do with matters of the present organization of the Jewish\r\nnation. Must it wait until it reaches Palestine to have a State, or is\r\nit an organized State now? Does Jewry know what it is doing? Has it a\r\n\"foreign policy\" with regard to the Gentiles? Has it a department which\r\nis executing that foreign policy? Has this Jewish State, visible or\r\ninvisible, if it exists, a head? Has it a Council of State? And if any\r\nof these things is so, who is aware of it?\r\n\r\nThe first impulsive answer of the Gentile mind would be \"No\" to all\r\nthese questions--it is a Gentile habit to answer impulsively. Never\r\nhaving been trained in secrets or invisible unity, the Gentile\r\nimmediately concludes that such things cannot be, if for no other reason\r\nthan that they have not crossed his path and advertised themselves.\r\n\r\nThe questions, however, answered thus, require some explanation of the\r\ncircumstances which are visible to all men. If there is no deliberate\r\ncombination of Jews in the world, then the control which they have\r\nachieved and the uniformity of the policies which they follow must be\r\nthe simple result, not of deliberate decisions, but of a similar nature\r\nin all of them working out the same way. Thus, we might say that as a\r\nlove for adventure on the water drove the Britisher forth, so it made\r\nhim the world's greatest colonist. Not that he deliberately sat down\r\nwith himself and in formal manner resolved that he would become a\r\ncolonizer, but the natural outworking of his genius resulted that way.\r\nBut would this be a sufficient account of the British Empire?\r\n\r\nDoubtless the Jews have the genius to do, wherever they go, the things\r\nin which we see them excel. But does this account for the relations\r\nwhich exist between the Jews of every country, for their world councils,\r\nfor their amazing foreknowledge of stupendous events which break with\r\nshattering surprise on the rest of the world, for the smoothness and\r\npreparedness with which they appear, at a given time in Paris, with a\r\nworld program on which they all agree?\r\n\r\nThe world has long suspected--at first only a few, then the secret\r\ndepartments of the governments, next the intellectuals among the people,\r\nnow more and more the common people themselves--that not only are the\r\nJews a nation distinct from all the other nations and mysteriously\r\nunable to sink their nationality by any means they or the world may\r\nadopt to this end, but that they also constitute a state; that they are\r\nnationally conscious, not only, but consciously united for a common\r\ndefense and for a common purpose. Revert to Theodor Herzl's definition\r\nof the Jewish nation, as held together by a common enemy, and then\r\nreflect that this common enemy is the Gentile world. Does this people\r\nwhich knows itself to be a nation remain loosely unorganized in the face\r\nof that fact? It would hardly be like Jewish astuteness in other fields.\r\nWhen you see how closely the Jews are united by various organizations in\r\nthe United States, and when you see how with practiced hand they bring\r\nthose organizations to bear as if with tried confidence in their\r\npressure, it is at least not inconceivable that what can be done within\r\na country can be done, or has been done, between all the countries where\r\nthe Jews live.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, in the American Hebrew of June 25, 1920, Herman Bernstein\r\nwrites thus: \"About a year ago a representative of the Department of\r\nJustice submitted to me a copy of the manuscript of 'The Jewish Peril'\r\nby Professor Nilus, and asked for my opinion of the work. He said that\r\nthe manuscript was a translation of a Russian book published in 1905\r\nwhich was later suppressed. The manuscript was supposed to contain\r\n'protocols' of the Wise Men of Zion and was supposed to have been read\r\nby Dr. Herzl at a secret conference of the Zionist Congress at Basle. He\r\nexpressed the opinion that the work was probably that of Dr. Theodor\r\nHerzl. . . . . He said that some American Senators who had seen the\r\nmanuscript were amazed to find that so many years ago a scheme had been\r\nelaborated by the Jews which is now being carried out, and that\r\nBolshevism had been planned years ago by Jews who sought to destroy the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThis quotation is made merely to put on record the fact that it was a\r\nrepresentative of the Department of Justice of the United States\r\nGovernment, who introduced this document to Mr. Bernstein, and expressed\r\na certain opinion upon it, namely, \"that the work was probably that of\r\nTheodor Herzl.\" Also that \"some American Senators\" were amazed to note\r\nthe comparison between what a publication of the year 1905 proposed and\r\nwhat the year 1920 revealed.\r\n\r\nThe incident is all the more preoccupying because it occurred by action\r\nof the representative of a government who today is very largely in the\r\nhands of, or under the influence of, Jewish interests. It is more than\r\nprobable that as soon as the activity became known, the investigator was\r\nstopped. But it is equally probable that whatever orders may have been\r\ngiven and apparently obeyed, the investigation may not have stopped.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government was a little late in the matter, however.\r\nAt least four other world powers had preceded it, some by many years. A\r\ncopy of the Protocols was deposited in the British Museum and bears on\r\nit the stamp of that institution, \"August 10, 1906.\" The notes\r\nthemselves probably date from 1896, or the year of the utterances\r\npreviously quoted from Dr. Herzl. The first Zionist Congress convened in\r\n1897.\r\n\r\nThe document was published in England recently under auspices that\r\nchallenged attention for it, in spite of the unfortunate title under\r\nwhich it appeared. Eyre and Spottiswoode are the appointed printers to\r\nthe British Government, and it was they who brought out the pamphlet. It\r\nwas as if the Government Printing Office at Washington should issue them\r\nin this country. While there was the usual outcry by the Jewish press,\r\nthe London Times in a review pronounced all the Jewish counter-attacks\r\nas \"unsatisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nThe Times noticed what will probably be the case in this country also\r\nthat the Jewish defenders leave the text of the protocols alone, while\r\nthey lay heavy emphasis on the fact of their anonymity. When they refer\r\nto the substance of the document at all there is one form of words which\r\nrecurs very often--\"it is the work of a criminal or a madman.\"\r\n\r\nThe protocols, without name attached, appearing for the most part in\r\nmanuscripts here and there, laboriously copied out from hand to hand,\r\nbeing sponsored by no authority that was willing to stand behind it,\r\nassiduously studied in the secret departments of the governments and\r\npassed from one to another among higher officials, have lived on and on,\r\nincreasing in power and prestige by the sheer force of their contents. A\r\nmarvelous achievement for either a criminal or a madman! The only\r\nevidence it has is that which it carries within it, and that internal\r\nevidence is, as the London Times points out, the point on which\r\nattention is to be focused, and the very point from which Jewish effort\r\nhas been expended to draw us away.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the Protocols at this time is their bearing on the\r\nquestions: Have the Jews an organized world system? What is its policy?\r\nHow is it being worked?\r\n\r\nThese questions all receive full attention in the Protocols. Whosoever\r\nwas the mind that conceived them possessed a knowledge of human nature,\r\nof history and of statecraft which is dazzling in its brilliant\r\ncompleteness, and terrible in the objects to which it turns its powers.\r\nNeither a madman nor an intentional criminal, but more likely a\r\nsuper-mind mastered by devotion to a people and a faith could be the\r\nauthor, if indeed one mind alone conceived them. It is too terribly real\r\nfor fiction, too well-sustained for speculation, too deep in its\r\nknowledge of the secret springs of life for forgery.\r\n\r\nJewish attacks upon it thus far make much of the fact that it came out\r\nof Russia. That is hardly true. It came by way of Russia. It was\r\nincorporated in a Russian book published about 1905 by a Professor\r\nNilus, who attempted to interpret the Protocols by events then going\r\nforward in Russia. This publication and interpretation gave it a Russian\r\ntinge which has been useful to Jewish propagandists in this country and\r\nEngland, because these same propagandists have been very successful in\r\nestablishing in Anglo-Saxon mentalities a certain atmosphere of thought\r\nsurrounding the idea of Russia and Russians. One of the biggest humbugs\r\never foisted on the world has been that foisted by Jewish propagandists,\r\nprincipally on the American public, with regard to the temper and genius\r\nof the truly Russian people. So, to intimate that the Protocols are\r\nRussian, is partially to discredit them.\r\n\r\nThe internal evidence makes it clear that the Protocols were not written\r\nby a Russian, nor originally in the Russian language, nor under the\r\ninfluence of Russian conditions. But they found their way to Russia and\r\nwere first published there. They have been found by diplomatic officers\r\nin manuscript in all parts of the world. Wherever Jewish power is able\r\nto do so, it has suppressed them, sometimes under the supreme penalty.\r\n\r\nTheir persistence is a fact which challenges the mind. Jewish apologists\r\nmay explain that persistence on the ground that the Protocols feed the\r\nanti-Semitic temper, and therefore are preserved for that service.\r\nCertainly there was no wide nor deep anti-Semitic temper in the United\r\nStates to be fed or that felt the greed for agreeable lies to keep\r\nitself alive. The progress of the Protocols in the United States can\r\nonly be explained on the ground that they supply light and give meaning\r\nto certain previously observed facts, and that this light and meaning is\r\nso startling as to give a certain standing and importance to these\r\notherwise unaccredited documents. Sheer lies do not live long, their\r\npower soon dies. These Protocols are more alive than ever. They have\r\npenetrated higher places than ever before. They have compelled a more\r\nserious attitude to them than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols would not be more worthy of study if they bore, say, the\r\nname of Theodor Herzl. Their anonymity does not decrease their power any\r\nmore than the omission of a painter's signature detracts from the art\r\nvalue of a painting. Indeed, the Protocols are better without a known\r\nsource. For if it were definitely known that in France or Switzerland in\r\nthe year 1896, or thereabouts, a group of International Jews, assembled\r\nin conference, drew up a program of world conquest it would still have\r\nto be shown that such a program was more than a mere vagary, that it was\r\nconfirmed at large by efforts to fulfill it. The Protocols are a World\r\nProgram--there is no doubt anywhere of that. Whose program, is stated\r\nwithin the articles themselves. But as for outer confirmation, which\r\nwould be the more valuable--a signature, or six signatures, or twenty\r\nsignatures, or a 25-year unbroken line of effort fulfilling that\r\nprogram?\r\n\r\nThe point of interest for this and other countries is not that a\r\n\"criminal or a madman\" conceived such a program, but that, when\r\nconceived, this program found means of getting itself fulfilled in its\r\nmost important particulars. The document is comparatively unimportant;\r\nthe conditions to which it calls attention are of a very high degree of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[NOTE: The statements indicated are those of non-Zionist Jews. The real\r\nJewish program is that program which is executed. It was the Zionist\r\nprogram that was followed by the Peace Conference. It must therefore be\r\nregarded as the official program.]\r\n\r\n[Issue of July 10, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are a people--One people . . . . When we sink, we become a\r\nrevolutionary proletariat, the subordinate officers of a revolutionary\r\nparty; when we rise, there rises also our terrible power of the purse.\"\r\n\r\n--Theodore Herzl, \"A Jewish State,\" pp. 5, 23.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe Historic Basis of Jewish Imperialism\r\n\r\n\r\nA great unloosening of speech with reference to the Jewish Question and\r\nthe Jewish program for world power has occurred in this country since\r\nthe beginning of this series of articles. It is now possible to\r\npronounce the word \"Jew\" in a perfectly serious discussion, without\r\ntimidity, or without intimidation. Heretofore that has been regarded as\r\nthe special prerogative of the Jewish publicists themselves and they\r\nhave used the name exclusively in well-organized and favorable\r\npropaganda. They can oust portions of Shakespeare from the public\r\nschools on the ground that the Jews are offended; they can demand the\r\nremoval of one of Sargent's paintings from the Boston Library because it\r\nrepresents the Synagogue in a decline. But when anything emanates from\r\nthe Gentile side which indicates that the Gentile is also conscious of\r\nthe Jew, then the charge of prejudice is instantly and strongly made.\r\nThe effect of that in this country has been a ban on speech which has\r\nhad few parallels in our history. Recently at a banquet a speaker used\r\nthe term \"Jews\" in reference to the actions of a group of Jewish\r\nbankers. A Jewish guest leaped to his feet demanding to know if the\r\nspeaker considered it \"American\" to single out a race that way. The\r\nspeaker replied, \"I do, sir,\" and received the approval of the audience.\r\nIn that particular part of the country, business men's tongues had been\r\ntied for years by the unwritten law that Jews must never by singled out\r\nas Jews.\r\n\r\nNo one would have predicted a year ago that a newspaper like the Chicago\r\nTribune could have convinced itself that it was good newspaper policy to\r\nprint in the first column of its first page a copyrighted article on the\r\nJewish program for world rule, printing the word \"Jew\" in large letters\r\nin its headline, and abstaining from editorial retouching of the word\r\n\"Jew\" in the body of the article. The usual plan is to do what an\r\neastern newspaper did when dealing with the same subject: wherever the\r\nterm \"international Jew\" occurred in the article which it printed, it\r\nwas retouched to \"financiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Tribune, however, on Saturday, June 19, 1920, printed in the\r\nfirst column of the first page a cable dispatch from John Clayton, its\r\nspecial correspondent, under the heading: \"Trotsky Leads Jew-Radicals to\r\nWorld Rule. Bolshevism Only a Tool for His Scheme.\"\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"For the last two years army intelligence officers, members of the\r\nvarious secret service organizations of the Entente, have been bringing\r\nin reports of a world revolutionary movement other than Bolshevism. At\r\nfirst these reports confused the two, but latterly the lines they have\r\ntaken have begun to be more and more clear.\"\r\n\r\nAs previously stated in THE DEARBORN INDEPENDENT, our own secret service\r\nis one of these, though there is reason to believe that because of the\r\ninfluence of Jews upon the government these investigations were not\r\npursued with the persistency that might otherwise have been given them.\r\nHowever, we know from Jewish sources, not to mention any other, that the\r\nDepartment of Justice of the United States was at one time interested\r\nenough to make inquiries.\r\n\r\nWhat the Tribune writer does in the above paragraph is to show that this\r\ninterest has been sustained for two years by officials of the Entente, a\r\nfact which ought to be borne in mind by those who declare that the whole\r\nmatter is of German instigation. The emergence of the Jewish Question\r\ninto American thought was immediately met by a statement from Jewish\r\nsources that it was a German importation, and that the anti-Semitism\r\nwhich flowed over Germany and resulted in cleaning out the overwhelming\r\nJewish revolutionary influences from the new German Government, was only\r\na trick to throw the blame for the defeat of Germany on the Jews.\r\nAmerican rabbis are even now unitedly preaching that history shows that\r\nevery great war is followed by a new \"attack\" on the Jews. It is\r\nundoubtedly a fact that every war newly opens the people's eyes to the\r\npower which international Jewish financiers exert with reference to\r\nwar--and it would seem that such a fact is worthy of a better\r\nexplanation than that of \"prejudice.\" However, as the Tribune article\r\nshows, and as all the facts confirm, the interest is not confined to the\r\nGerman side; indeed, it is not even strongest there. It is \"the various\r\nsecret service organizations of the Entente\" that have been most active\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nThe second paragraph further distinguishes between Bolshevism and Jewish\r\nimperialism:\r\n\r\n\"Bolshevism aims at the overthrow of existing society and the\r\nestablishment of an international brotherhood of men who work with their\r\nhands as rulers of the world. The second movement aims for the\r\nestablishment of a new racial domination of the world. So far as the\r\nBritish, French and our own department's inquiry have been able to\r\ntrace, the moving spirits in the second scheme are Jewish radicals.\"\r\n\r\nOther statements in the article are:\r\n\r\n\"Within the ranks of communism is a group of this party, but it does not\r\nstop there. To its leaders, communism is only an incident.\"\r\n\r\n(This will recall the statement of Lord Eustace Percy, quoted last week\r\nfrom the Canadian Jewish Chronicle--\"Not because the Jew cares for the\r\npositive side of radical philosophy, not because he desires to be a\r\npartaker in Gentile nationalism or Gentile democracy, but because no\r\nexisting Gentile system of government is anything but distasteful to\r\nhim.\")\r\n\r\n\"They are ready to use the Islamic revolt, hatred by the central empires\r\nfor England, Japan's designs on India, and commercial rivalry between\r\nAmerica and Japan.\"\r\n\r\n\"As any movement of world revolution must be, this is primarily\r\nanti-Anglo-Saxon.\"\r\n\r\n\"The organization of the world Jewish-radical movement has been\r\nperfected in almost every land.\"\r\n\r\n\"The aims of the Jewish-radical party have nothing of altruism behind\r\nthem beyond liberation of their own race.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be conceded that these are rather startling statements. If they\r\nwere found in a propagandist publication of no responsibility, the\r\naverage reader might pass them by as preposterous, so little does the\r\naverage reader know of the secret influences which shape his life and\r\nframe his problems. But appearing in a great newspaper, they must\r\nreceive a different evaluation.\r\n\r\nNor did the Tribune stop at the news article. On June 21, 1920, an\r\neditorial appeared entitled \"World Mischief.\" The editorial is evidently\r\nan effort to prevent possible misunderstanding of what the news article\r\nwas driving at.\r\n\r\n\"The Jewish phase of the movement, he asserts, aims at a new racial\r\ndomination of the world . . .\"\r\n\r\nThe Tribune also says that while it is perhaps natural for the Jews of\r\nother countries to be engaged in this \"world mischief,\" the Jews of\r\nEngland and the United States \"are loyal nationalists and conservative\r\nupholders of the national traditions.\" It were well if this were true.\r\nPerhaps it is true of tens of thousands of Jews as individuals; it\r\ncertainly is not true of those internationalists who pull the strings of\r\nall the governments and who during the last six tragic years have been\r\nmeddling with world affairs in a way which must soon be plainly told.\r\nThe unfortunate circumstance is that all the American and English Jews\r\nmust for a time feel a distress which no one desires them to feel, which\r\neveryone would do much to save them from, but which seems inevitable\r\nuntil the whole story is told and until the mass of the Jews themselves\r\ncut off from their name and support some who now receive their deepest\r\nhomage.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while observing the contrasts and similarities between the\r\nGentile and Jewish reaction to this alleged movement to establish a\r\nJewish imperialism over the world. Jewish publicists first deny it\r\nwithout qualification. It is all false, all a lie, all hatched up by\r\nenemies of the Jews in order to stir up hatred and murder. As the\r\nevidence accumulates, the Jewish tone changes: \"Well, suppose it is\r\ntrue,\" the publicists say; \"is it any wonder that the poor oppressed\r\nJews, driven to madness through their sufferings, should dream dreams of\r\noverthrowing their enemies and placing themselves in the seat of\r\nauthority?\"\r\n\r\nThe Gentile mind, confronted with the statement, says: \"Yes, but they\r\nare Russian Jews. Don't mind them. American Jews are all right. They\r\nwould never be taken in by anything like that.\" Going a little deeper\r\ninto the subject, the Gentile mind is forced to admit the existence of\r\nsome kind of a subversive world movement, the power of which has shaken\r\neven this country, and that the moving spirits in it are revolutionary\r\nJews. And then the tendency from that point forward is either to fall in\r\nwith the theory that the movement is really Jewish in its origin,\r\nagitation, execution and purpose, or to set up the theory that it is a\r\n\"world movement\" undoubtedly, but only incidentally Jewish. The end of\r\nboth Jewish and Gentile reaction is an admission that something\r\nanswering to the movement charged actually exists.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Christian Science Monitor, whose standard as a\r\nnewspaper no one will question, has this to say in a lengthy editorial\r\non the subject:\r\n\r\n\"In spite of this, it would be a tremendous mistake to conclude that the\r\nJewish peril, given another name and atmosphere, does not exist. It\r\nmight, indeed, be renamed, out of one of the grandest of the books of\r\nthe Old Testament, 'the terror by night,' for it is, essentially, the\r\nPsalmist's concept of the forces of mental evil at which, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, Professor Nilus is aiming. In other words, that a secret\r\ninternational political organization exists, working unremittingly by\r\nmeans of its Bureau of Psychology, though the world which should be\r\nawake to it is entirely asleep to it, is, to the man who can read the\r\nsigns of the times, a thing unquestionable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Monitor gives warning against prejudice and disregard of the laws of\r\nevidence which is exceedingly timely and is, indeed, the desire of\r\nanyone who has ever undertaken to deal with this subject, but too often\r\nit is a disregard of facts and not of evidence that makes the\r\ndifficulty. It is safe to say that most of the prejudice today is\r\nagainst the facts, it has not been caused by them.\r\n\r\nThere are two preconceptions to be guarded against in making an approach\r\nto this question. One is that the Jewish imperialistic program, if such\r\na thing exists, is of recent origin. Upon the mere mention of such a\r\nprogram, Gentiles are likely to think that it was formulated last week,\r\nor last year, or within recent time. That need not be the case at all,\r\nand in Jewish matters it is very likely not to be the case. It is very\r\neasy to see how, if the program were to be formulated today, it would be\r\nwholly different from the one which is to be considered. The kind of\r\nprogram that would be made today indeed exists too, but it is not to be\r\ncompared in extent and profundity with that which has existed for a very\r\nlong time. Perfect constitutions of invisible governments are not the\r\ncreations of secret conventions; they are the accumulated thought and\r\nexperience of centuries. Moreover, no matter how prone a modern\r\ngeneration may be to disregard such things, the mere fact that they may\r\nhave existed as a secret racial ideal for centuries is a powerful\r\nargument for their respectable acceptance, if not active execution, by\r\nthe generation that now is. There is no idea deeper in Judaism than that\r\nJews constitute a Chosen People and that their future is to be more\r\nglorious than their past. A large part of the Christian world accepts\r\nthat, too, and it may well be true, but in a moral universe it cannot\r\ncome to pass by the methods which have been and are being used.\r\n\r\nBut to mention the ancient lineage of the idea of the Chosen People is\r\nmerely to suggest that of all the programs that may have gathered round\r\nit to assist its full historical realization, it is not strange that\r\nthere should be one very old one to which the wisest minds of Israel\r\nhave contributed their best of mind and heart to insure its success.\r\nThat there is such a plan has been the belief of many deep delvers in\r\nthe hidden things of the world, and that such a plan has at times had\r\nits dress rehearsals, so to speak, on a limited stage, as if in\r\npreparation for its grand finale on the universal stage, is another\r\nbelief held by men at whose knowledge it is impossible to cavil.\r\n\r\nSo, then, it may be that we are dealing with something for which\r\npresent-day Jews, even the more important internationalists, are not\r\noriginally responsible. It may have come to them as part of their\r\nancient Jewish inheritance. Certainly, if it were a mere modern thing,\r\nhastily conceived and thrown together after the modern fashion, it could\r\nbe expected to disappear in the same era which saw it born.\r\n\r\nAnother preconception to be guarded against is that every Jew one meets\r\nhas secret knowledge of this program. That is not the case. With the\r\ngeneral idea of the ultimate triumph of Israel every Jew who has\r\nretained contact with his people is familiar, but with the special plans\r\nwhich for centuries have existed in formulated form for the attainment\r\nof that triumph, the average Jew is no more familiar than anyone\r\nelse--no more so than was the average German with the secret plans of\r\nthe Pan-Germanic party whose ideas started and guided the recent war.\r\nThe average Jew enters into the plans of the secret group just to this\r\nextent, except in specially selected cases: It is perfectly understood\r\nthat the consummation of the Jewish triumph will not be distasteful to\r\nany Jew, and if the methods to be used toward the end are a bit violent,\r\nevery Jew can be depended upon to see in that violence a very\r\ninsufficient retribution visited upon the Gentile world for the\r\nsufferings which it has caused the sons of Judah throughout the\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nStill, with even these preconceptions guarded against, there is no\r\nescape from the conclusion that if such a program of Jewish world\r\nimperialism exists today, it must exist with the cognizance and active\r\nsupport of certain individuals, and that these groups of individuals\r\nmust have somewhere an official head.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, the one point at which more investigators stop than at\r\nany other. The idea of a Jewish autocrat is too strange for the mind\r\nwhich has not been much in contact with the main question. And yet there\r\nis no race which more instinctively supports autocracy than does the\r\nJewish race, no race which more craves and respects position. It is\r\ntheir sense of the value of position that explains the main course their\r\nactivities take. The Jew is primarily a money-maker for the reason that\r\nup to this time money is the only means he knows by which to gain\r\nposition. The Jews who have gained position for any other reason are\r\ncomparatively few. This is not a Gentile gibe; it is the position of a\r\nfamous Anglo-Jewish physician, Dr. Barnard Von Oven, who wrote: \"All\r\nother means of distinction are denied him; he must rise by wealth, or\r\nnot at all. And if, as he well knows, to insure wealth will be to insure\r\nrank, respect and attention in society, does the blame rest with him who\r\nendeavors to acquire wealth for the distinction which it will purchase,\r\nor with that society which so readily bows down to the shrine of\r\nMammon?\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew is not averse to kings, only to the state of things which\r\nprevents a Jewish king. The future autocrat of the world is to be a\r\nJewish king, sitting upon the throne of David, so ancient prophecies and\r\nthe documents of the imperialistic program agree.\r\n\r\nIs such a king in the world now? If not, the men who could choose a king\r\nare in the world. There has been no king of the Jews since before the\r\nChristian Era, but until about the eleventh century there were Princes\r\nof the Exile, those who represented the headship of the Jews who were\r\ndispersed through the nations. They were and still are called\r\n\"exilarchs,\" or Princes of the Exile. They were attended by the wise men\r\nof Israel, they held court, they gave the law to their people. They\r\nlived abroad wherever their circumstances or convenience dictated, in\r\nChristian or Mohammedan countries. Whether the office was discontinued\r\nwith the last publicly known exilarch or merely disappeared from the\r\nsurface of history, whether today it is entirely abandoned or exists in\r\nanother form, are questions which must wait. That there are offices of\r\nworld jurisdiction held by Jews is well known. That there are world\r\norganizations of Jews--organizations, that is, within the very strong\r\nsolidarity of the Jewish nation itself--is well known. That there is\r\nworld unity on certain Jewish activities, defensive and offensive, is\r\nwell known. There is nothing in the condition or thought of the Jews\r\nwhich would render the existence today of an exilarch distasteful to\r\nthem; indeed, the thought would be very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia remarks: \"Curiously enough, the exilarchs are\r\nstill mentioned in the Sabbath services of the Ashkenazim ritual * * *\r\nThe Jews of the Sephardic ritual have not preserved this anachronism,\r\nnor was it retained in most of the Reform synagogues of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\"\r\n\r\nIs there, then, a Jewish Sanhedrin?--a governing or counseling body of\r\nJews who take oversight of the affairs of their people throughout the\r\nworld?\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Sanhedrin was a most interesting institution. Its origin and\r\nmethod of constitution are obscure. It consisted of 71 members, with the\r\npresident, and performed the functions of a political senate. There is\r\nnothing to show whence the Sanhedrin derived its authority. It was not\r\nan elective body. It was not democratic. It was not representative. It\r\nwas not responsible to the people. In these qualities, it was typically\r\nJewish. The Sanhedrin was chosen by the prince or priest, not with the\r\npurpose of safeguarding the people's interest, but to assist the ruler\r\nin the work of administration. It was thus assembled by call, or it was\r\nself-perpetuating, calling its own members. The arrangement seems to\r\nhave been that well-known device by which an aristocracy can maintain\r\nitself in power whatever the political construction of the nation may\r\nbe. The Jewish Encyclopedia says: \"The Sanhedrin, which was entirely\r\naristocratic in character, probably assumed its own authority, since it\r\nwas composed of members of the most influential families of the nobility\r\nand priesthood.\"\r\n\r\nThis body was flanked by a similar body, which governed the religious\r\ninterests of the nation, the members being drawn apparently from classes\r\nnearer the common people.\r\n\r\nThe Sanhedrin exercised authority not only over the Jews of Palestine,\r\nbut wherever they were scattered throughout the world. As a senate\r\nexercising direct political authority, it ceased with the downfall of\r\nthe Jewish State in the year 70, but there are indications of its\r\ncontinuance as an advisory body down to the fourth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, in order to satisfy the mind of Napoleon upon some questions\r\nwhich had arisen concerning the Jews, an Assembly of Notables was\r\ncalled, whose membership consisted of prominent Jews of France. They, in\r\nturn, to bring the sanction of all Jewry to the answers which they\r\nshould give Napoleon, convoked the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin assembled in\r\nParis on February 9, 1807. It followed the prescribed ancient forms; it\r\nwas comprised of Jews from all parts of Europe; it was assembled to put\r\nthe whole authority of Jewry behind any compact the French Jews may have\r\nbeen able to make with Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIn putting forth its decisions, this Sanhedrin of 1807 declared that it\r\nwas in all respects like the ancient Sanhedrin, \"a legal assembly vested\r\nwith power of passing ordinances in order to promote the welfare of\r\nIsrael.\"\r\n\r\nThe significance of these facts is this: Whatever the leaders of the\r\nJews may do today in the way of maintaining the policy and constitution\r\nof Israel, would not constitute a new departure. It would not signify a\r\nnew attitude. It would not be evidence of a new plan.\r\n\r\nIt would be entirely natural, Jewish solidarity being what it is, that\r\nthe Sanhedrin should still be continued. The ancient Sanhedrin appears\r\nto have had a group of ten who were somewhat exalted in importance above\r\nthe rest; it would be perfectly natural if the leaders of the Jews were\r\ntoday divided into committees, by countries or by objects.\r\n\r\nThere are always being held, year by year, world meetings of the\r\nprincipal Jews of all lands. They come together whenever called, to the\r\ndisregard of everything else. Great judges from the high courts of the\r\nvarious countries, international financiers, Jewish orators of the\r\n\"liberal type\" who have the ear of the Gentiles, political maneuverers\r\nfrom all the parties represented in the world, they assemble wherever\r\nthey will, and the subjects of their deliberations are made known only\r\nto the extent they will. It is not to be supposed that all of the\r\nattendants on these conventions are members of the inner circle. The\r\nlist of delegates will show scores of persons with whom no one would\r\nassociate Lord Reading and Judge Brandeis. If the modern Sanhedrin\r\nmeets, and it would be the most natural thing in the world if it should,\r\nwe may be sure it meets within the closed circle of those persons which\r\nthe Jewish aristocracy of money, intellect and power approves.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of a Jewish world government exists ready-made. The Jew is\r\nconvinced that he has the best religion, the best morality, the best\r\nmethod of education, the best social standards, the best ideal of\r\ngovernment. He would not have to go outside the circle of that which he\r\nconsiders best to get anything which he may need to advance the welfare\r\nof his people, or to execute any program which may have to do with the\r\noutside world.\r\n\r\nIt is the ancient machinery that the international Jew uses in all those\r\nactivities which he permits the world to see in part. There are\r\ngatherings of the financial, political and intellectual chief rulers of\r\nthe Jews. These gatherings are announced for one or another\r\nthing--sometimes. Sometimes there is a gathering of Jews in a world\r\ncapital, with no announced purpose. They all appear in one city, confer\r\nand depart.\r\n\r\nWhether there is a recognized head to all of this is yet to be\r\ndisclosed. There can be little doubt, however, as to the existence of\r\nwhat may be called a \"foreign policy,\" that is, a definite point of view\r\nand plan of action with reference to the Gentile world. The Jew feels\r\nthat he is in the midst of enemies, but he also feels that he is a\r\nmember of a people--\"one people.\" He must have some policy with regard\r\nto the outer world. He cannot help but consider present conditions, he\r\ncannot consider them without being stirred to speculate upon what the\r\noutcome must be, and he cannot speculate on the outcome without in some\r\nmanner endeavoring to make it as he would like it to be.\r\n\r\nThe invisible government of the Jews, its attitude toward the Gentile\r\nworld, its policy with regard to the future, are not, then, the abnormal\r\nthings that some would make them appear. Given the Jewish position, they\r\nare of all things most natural. Jewish existence in this world is not\r\nsuch as woos the Jew into sleepy contentment; it is such as stirs him\r\ninto organization against future contingencies and into programs which\r\nmay shape those contingencies to the benefit of his race. That there\r\nshould be a Sanhedrin of the Jews, a world body of the leading men of\r\nall countries; that there should even be an exilarch, a visible and\r\nrecognized head of the Sanhedrin, mystically foreshadowing the autocrat\r\nto come; that there should even be a world program, just as every\r\ngovernment has its foreign policy, are not strange, uncanny\r\nsuppositions. They grow normally out of the situation itself.\r\n\r\nAnd it is also natural that not every Jew should know this. The\r\nSanhedrin always was the aristocracy, and would be today. When rabbis\r\ncry from their pulpits that they know nothing about this thing, they are\r\ndoubtless telling the truth. What the international Jew depends upon is\r\nthe likelihood of every Jew approving that which brings power and\r\nprestige to his people. At any rate, it is well enough known that\r\nhowever little the ordinary Jewish leader may have been told about world\r\nprograms, he regards with the greatest respect and confidence the very\r\nmen who must put these programs through, if these exist at all.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-fourth Protocol of the Learned Elders of Zion has this to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\"Now I will discuss the manner in which the roots of the house of King\r\nDavid will penetrate to the deepest strata of the earth. This dynasty,\r\neven to this day, has given the power of controlling world affairs to\r\nour wise men, the educational directors of all human thought.\"\r\n\r\nThis would indicate, if reliable, that, as the Protocol goes on to\r\nrecite, the Autocrat himself has not appeared, but the dynasty, or the\r\nDavidic line in which he must appear, have entrusted the work of\r\npreparing for him to the Wise Men of Zion. These wise men are\r\nrepresented not only as preparing those who exercise rulership over\r\nJudaism's affairs, but also as framing and influencing the world's\r\nthought toward ends which shall be propitious to these plans. Whatever\r\nmay be hidden in the program, it is certain that its execution or the\r\neffects of its execution cannot be hidden. Therefore, it may be possible\r\nto find in the outer world the clues which, traced back to their source,\r\nreveal the existence of a program, whose promise for the world, good or\r\nbad, ought to be widely known.\r\n\r\n[Issue of July 17, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nAn Introduction to the \"Jewish Protocols\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe documents most frequently mentioned by those who are interested in\r\nthe theory of Jewish World Power rather than in the actual operation of\r\nthat power in the world today, are those 24 documents known as \"The\r\nProtocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protocols have attracted much attention in Europe, having become the\r\ncenter of an important storm of opinion in England only recently, but\r\ndiscussion of them in the United States has been limited. These are the\r\ndocuments concerning which the Department of Justice was making\r\ninquiries more than a year ago, and which were given publication in\r\nLondon by Eyre and Spottiswoode, the official printers to the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWho it was that first entitled these documents with the name of the\r\n\"Elders of Zion\" is not known. It would be possible without serious\r\nmutilation of the documents to remove all hint of Jewish authorship, and\r\nyet retain all the main points of the most comprehensive program for\r\nworld subjugation that has ever come to public knowledge.\r\n\r\nYet it must be said that thus to eliminate all hint of Jewish authorship\r\nwould be to bring out a number of contradictions which do not exist in\r\nthe Protocols in their present form. The purpose of the plan revealed in\r\nthe Protocols is to undermine all authority in order that a new\r\nauthority in the form of autocracy may be set up. Such a plan could not\r\nemanate from a ruling class which already possessed authority, although\r\nit might emanate from anarchists. But anarchists do not avow autocracy\r\nas the ultimate condition they seek. The authors might be conceived as a\r\ncompany of French Subversives such as existed at the time of the French\r\nRevolution and had the infamous Duc d'Orleans as their leader, but this\r\nwould involve a contradiction between the fact that those Subversives\r\nhave passed away, and the fact that the program announced in these\r\nProtocols is being steadily carried out, not only in France, but\r\nthroughout Europe and very noticeably in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn their present form which bears evidence of being their original form,\r\nthere is no contradiction. The allegation of Jewish authorship seems\r\nessential to the consistency of the plan.\r\n\r\nIf these documents were the forgeries which Jewish apologists claim them\r\nto be, the forgers would probably have taken pains to make Jewish\r\nauthorship so clear that their anti-Semitic purpose could easily have\r\nbeen detected. But only twice is the term \"Jew\" used in them. After one\r\nhas read much further than the average reader usually cares to go into\r\nsuch matters, one comes upon the plans for the establishment of the\r\nWorld Autocrat, and only then it is made clear of what lineage he is to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nBut all through the documents there is left no doubt as to the people\r\nagainst whom the plan is aimed. It is not aimed against aristocracy as\r\nsuch. It is not aimed against capital as such. It is not aimed against\r\ngovernment as such. Very definite provisions are made for the enlistment\r\nof aristocracy, capital and government for the execution of the plan. It\r\nis aimed against the people of the world who are called \"Gentiles.\" It\r\nis the frequent mention of \"Gentiles\" that really decides the purpose of\r\nthe documents. Most of the destructive type of \"liberal\" plans aim at\r\nthe enlistment of the people as helpers; this plan aims at the\r\ndegeneration of the people in order that they may be reduced to\r\nconfusion of mind and thus manipulated. Popular movements of a \"liberal\"\r\nkind are to be encouraged, all the disruptive philosophies in religion,\r\neconomics, politics and domestic life are to be sown and watered, for\r\nthe purpose of so disintegrating social solidarity that a definite plan,\r\nherein set forth, may be put through without notice, and the people then\r\nmolded to it when the fallacy of these philosophies is shown.\r\n\r\nThe formula of speech is not, \"We Jews will do this,\" but \"The Gentiles\r\nwill be made to think and do these things.\" With the exception of a few\r\ninstances in the closing Protocols, the only distinctive racial term\r\nused is \"Gentiles.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: the first indication of this kind comes in the first\r\nProtocol in this way:\r\n\r\n\"The great qualities of the people--honesty and frankness--are\r\nessentially vices in politics, because they dethrone more surely and\r\nmore certainly than does the strongest enemy. These qualities are\r\nattributes of Gentile rule; we certainly must not be guided by them.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\"On the ruins of the hereditary aristocracy of the Gentiles we have set\r\nup the aristocracy of our educated class, and over all the aristocracy\r\nof money. We have established the basis of this new aristocracy on the\r\nbasis of riches, which we control, and on the science guided by our wise\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n\"We will force up wages, which however will be of no benefit to workers,\r\nfor we at the same time will cause a rise in the prices of prime\r\nnecessities, pretending that this is due to the decline of agriculture\r\nand of cattle raising. We will also artfully and deeply undermine the\r\nsources of production by instilling in the workmen ideas of anarchy and\r\nencourage them in the use of alcohol, at the same time taking measures\r\nto drive all the intellectual forces of the Gentiles from the land.\"\r\n\r\n(A forger with anti-Semitic malice might have written this any time\r\nwithin the last five years, but these words were in print at least 14\r\nyears ago according to British evidence, a copy having been in the\r\nBritish Museum since 1906, and they were circulated in Russia a number\r\nof years prior.)\r\n\r\nThe above point continues: \"That the true situation shall not be noticed\r\nby the Gentiles prematurely we will mask it by a pretended effort to\r\nserve the working classes and promote great economic principles, for\r\nwhich an active propaganda will be carried on through our economic\r\ntheories.\"\r\n\r\nThese quotations will illustrate the style of the Protocols in making\r\nreference to the parties involved. It is \"we\" for the writers, and\r\n\"Gentiles\" for those who are being written about. This is brought out\r\nvery clearly in the Fourteenth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"In this divergence between Gentiles and ourselves in ability to think\r\nand reason is to be seen clearly the seal of our election as the chosen\r\npeople, as higher human beings, in contrast with the Gentiles who have\r\nmerely instinctive and animal minds. They observe, but they do not\r\nforesee, and they invent nothing (except perhaps material things). It is\r\nclear from this that nature herself predestined us to rule and guide the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThis, of course, has been the Jewish method of dividing humanity from\r\nthe earliest times. The world was only Jew and Gentile; all that was not\r\nJew was Gentile.\r\n\r\nThe use of the word Jew in the Protocol may be illustrated by this\r\npassage in the eighth section:\r\n\r\n\"For the time being, until it will be safe to give responsible\r\ngovernment positions to our brother Jews, we shall entrust them to\r\npeople whose past and whose characters are such that there is an abyss\r\nbetween them and the people.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the practice known as using \"Gentile fronts\" which is\r\nextensively practiced in the financial world today in order to cover up\r\nthe evidences of Jewish control. How much progress has been made since\r\nthese words were written is indicated by the occurrence at the San\r\nFrancisco convention when the name of Judge Brandeis was proposed for\r\nPresident. It is reasonably to be expected that the public mind will be\r\nmade more and more familiar with the idea of Jewish occupancy--which\r\nwill be really a short step from the present degree of influence which\r\nthe Jews exercise--of the highest office in the government. There is no\r\nfunction of the American Presidency in which the Jews have not already\r\nsecretly assisted in a very important degree. Actual occupancy of the\r\noffice is not necessary to enhance their power, but to promote certain\r\nthings which parallel very closely the plans outlined in the Protocols\r\nnow before us.\r\n\r\nAnother point which the reader of the Protocols will notice is that the\r\ntone of exhortation is entirely absent from these documents. They are\r\nnot propaganda. They are not efforts to stimulate the ambitions or\r\nactivity of those to whom they are addressed. They are as cool as a\r\nlegal paper and as matter-of-fact as a table of statistics. There is\r\nnone of the \"Let us rise, my brothers\" stuff about them. There is no\r\n\"Down with the Gentiles\" hysteria. These Protocols, if indeed they were\r\nmade by Jews and confided to Jews, or if they do contain certain\r\nprinciples of a Jewish World Program, were certainly not intended for\r\nthe firebrands but for the carefully prepared and tested initiates of\r\nthe higher groups.\r\n\r\nJewish apologists have asked, \"Is it conceivable that if there were such\r\na world program on the part of the Jews, they would reduce it to writing\r\nand publish it?\" But there is no evidence that these Protocols were ever\r\nuttered otherwise than in spoken words by those who put them forth. The\r\nProtocols as we have them are apparently the notes of lectures which\r\nwere made by someone who heard them. Some of them are lengthy; some of\r\nthem are brief. The assertion which has always been made in connection\r\nwith the Protocols since they have become known is that they are the\r\nnotes of lectures delivered to Jewish students presumably somewhere in\r\nFrance or Switzerland. The attempt to make them appear to be of Russian\r\norigin is absolutely forestalled by the point of view, the reference to\r\nthe times and certain grammatical indications.\r\n\r\nThe tone certainly fits the supposition that they were originally\r\nlectures given to students, for their purpose is clearly not to get a\r\nprogram accepted but to give information concerning a program which is\r\nrepresented as being already in process of fulfillment. There is no\r\ninvitation to join forces or to offer opinions. Indeed it is\r\nspecifically announced that neither discussion nor opinions are desired.\r\n(\"While preaching liberalism to the Gentiles, we shall hold our own\r\npeople and our own agents in unquestioning obedience.\" \"The scheme of\r\nadministration must emanate from a single brain * * * Therefore, we may\r\nknow the plan of action, but we must not discuss it, lest we destroy its\r\nunique character * * * The inspired work of our leader therefore must\r\nnot be thrown before a crowd to be torn to pieces, or even before a\r\nlimited group.\")\r\n\r\nMoreover, taking the Protocols at their face value, it is evident that\r\nthe program outlined in these lecture notes was not a new one at the\r\ntime the lectures were given. There is no evidence of its being of\r\nrecent arrangement. There is almost the tone of a tradition, or a\r\nreligion, in it all, as if it had been handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration through the medium of specially trusted and initiated men.\r\nThere is no note of new discovery or fresh enthusiasm in it, but the\r\ncertitude and calmness of facts long known and policies long confirmed\r\nby experiment.\r\n\r\nThis point of the age of the program is touched upon at least twice in\r\nthe Protocols themselves. In the First Protocol this paragraph occurs:\r\n\r\n\"Already in ancient times we were the first to shout the words,\r\n'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,' among the people. These words have been\r\nrepeated many times by unconscious poll-parrots, flocking from all sides\r\nto this bait, with which they have ruined the prosperity of the world\r\nand true personal freedom * * * The presumably clever and intellectual\r\nGentiles did not understand the symbolism of the uttered words; did not\r\nobserve their contradiction in meaning; did not notice that in nature\r\nthere is no equality * * *\"\r\n\r\nThe other reference to the program's finality is found in the Thirteenth\r\nProtocol:\r\n\r\n\"Questions of policy, however, are permitted to no one except those who\r\nhave originated the policy and have directed it for many centuries.\"\r\n\r\nCan this be a reference to a secret Jewish Sanhedrin, self-perpetuating\r\nwithin a certain Jewish caste from generation to generation?\r\n\r\nAgain, it must be said that the originators and directors here referred\r\nto cannot be at present any ruling caste, for all that the program\r\ncontemplates is directly opposed to the interests of such a caste. It\r\ncannot refer to any national aristocratic group, like the Junkers of\r\nGermany, for the methods which are proposed are the very ones which\r\nwould render powerless such a group. It cannot refer to any but a people\r\nwho have no government, who have everything to gain and nothing to lose,\r\nand who can keep themselves intact amid a crumbling world. There is only\r\none group that answers that description.\r\n\r\nAgain, a reading of the Protocols makes it clear that the speaker\r\nhimself was not seeking for honor. There is a complete absence of\r\npersonal ambition throughout the document. All plans and purposes and\r\nexpectations are merged in the future of Israel, which future, it would\r\nseem, can only be secured by the subtle breaking down of certain world\r\nideas held by the Gentiles. The Protocols speak of what has been done,\r\nwhat was being done at the time these words were given, and what\r\nremained to be done. Nothing like them in completeness of detail, in\r\nbreadth of plan and in deep grasp of the hidden springs of human action\r\nhas ever been known. They are verily terrible in their mastery of the\r\nsecrets of life, equally terrible in their consciousness of that\r\nmastery. Truly they would merit the opinion which Jews have recently\r\ncast upon them, that they were the work of an inspired madman, were it\r\nnot that what is written in the Protocols in words is also written upon\r\nthe life of today in deeds and tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms which these Protocols pass upon the Gentiles for their\r\nstupidity are just. It is impossible to disagree with a single item in\r\nthe Protocols' description of Gentile mentality and veniality. Even the\r\nmost astute of the Gentile thinkers have been fooled into receiving as\r\nthe motions of progress what has only been insinuated into the common\r\nhuman mind by the most insidious systems of propaganda.\r\n\r\nIt is true that here and there a thinker has arisen to say that science\r\nso-called was not science at all. It is true that here and there a\r\nthinker has arisen to say that the so-called economic laws both of\r\nconservatives and radicals were not laws at all, but artificial\r\ninventions. It is true that occasionally a keen observer has asserted\r\nthat the recent debauch of luxury and extravagance was not due to the\r\nnatural impulses of the people at all, but was systematically\r\nstimulated, foisted upon them by design. It is true that a few have\r\ndiscerned that more than half of what passes for \"public opinion\" is\r\nmere hired applause and booing and has never impressed the public mind.\r\n\r\nBut even with these clues here and there, for the most part disregarded,\r\nthere has never been enough continuity and collaboration between those\r\nwho were awake, to follow all the clues to their source. The chief\r\nexplanation of the hold which the Protocols have had on many of the\r\nleading statesmen of the world for several decades is that they explain\r\nwhence all these false influences come and what their purpose is. They\r\ngive a clue to the modern maze. It is now time for the people to know.\r\nAnd whether the Protocols are judged as proving anything concerning the\r\nJews or not, they constitute an education in the way the masses are\r\nturned about like sheep by influences which they do not understand. It\r\nis almost certain that once the principles of the Protocols are known\r\nwidely and understood by the people, the criticism which they now\r\nrightly make of the Gentile mind will no longer hold good.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of future articles in this series to study these\r\ndocuments and to answer out of their contents all the questions that may\r\narise concerning them.\r\n\r\nBefore that work is begun, one question should be answered--\"Is there\r\nlikelihood of the program of the Protocols being carried through to\r\nsuccess?\" The program is successful already. In many of its most\r\nimportant phases it is already a reality. But this need not cause alarm,\r\nfor the chief weapon to be used against such a program, both in its\r\ncompleted and uncompleted parts, is clear publicity. Let the people\r\nknow. Arousing the people, alarming the people, appealing to the\r\npassions of the people is the method of the plan outlined in the\r\nProtocols. The antidote is merely enlightening the people.\r\n\r\nThat is the only purpose of these articles. Enlightenment dispels\r\nprejudice. It is as desirable to dispel the prejudice of the Jew as of\r\nthe Gentile. Jewish writers too frequently assume that the prejudice is\r\nall on one side. The Protocols themselves ought to have the widest\r\ncirculation among the Jewish people, in order that they may check those\r\nthings which are bringing suspicion upon their name.\r\n\r\n[Issue of July 24, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\"Jewish\" Estimate of Gentile Human Nature\r\n\r\n\"Upon completing this program of our present and future actions, I will\r\nread to you the principles of these theories.\"--Protocol 16.\r\n\r\n\"In all that I have discussed with you hitherto, I have endeavored to\r\nindicate carefully the secrets of past and future events and of those\r\nmomentous occurrences of the near future toward which we are rushing in\r\na stream of great crises, anticipating the hidden principles of\r\nfuture relationships with the Gentiles and of our financial\r\noperations.\"--Protocol 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Protocols, which profess themselves to be an outline of the Jewish\r\nWorld Program, are found upon analysis to contain four main divisions.\r\nThese, however, are not marked in the structure of the documents, but in\r\nthe thought. There is a fifth, if the object of it all is included, but\r\nthis object is assumed throughout the Protocols, being only here and\r\nthere defined in terms. And the four main divisions are great trunks\r\nfrom which there are numerous branches.\r\n\r\nThere is first what is alleged to be the Jewish conception of human\r\nnature, by which is meant Gentile nature. It is inconceivable that such\r\na plan as that which the Protocols set forth could have been evolved by\r\na mind that had not previously based the probability of success on a\r\ncertain estimate of the ignobility and corruptibility of human\r\nnature--which all through the Protocols is referred to as Gentile\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThen, secondly, there is the account of what has already been\r\naccomplished in the realization of the program--things actually done.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is a complete instruction in the methods to be used to\r\nget the program still further fulfilled--methods which would themselves\r\nsupply the estimate of human nature upon which the whole fabric is\r\nbased, if there were nothing else to indicate it.\r\n\r\nFourth, the Protocols contain in detail some of the achievements which,\r\nat the time these words were uttered, were yet to be made. Some of these\r\ndesired things have been achieved in the meantime, for it should be\r\nborne in mind that between the year 1905 and the year 1920 there has\r\nbeen time to set many influences in motion and attain many ends. As the\r\nsecond quotation at the head of this article would indicate, the speaker\r\nknew that events were \"rushing in a stream of great crises,\" a knowledge\r\nwhich is amply attested by Jewish sources outside the Protocols.\r\n\r\nIf this series of articles represented a special pleading upon the\r\nJewish Question, the present article would seek to win the reader's\r\nconfidence by presenting first the set of facts which are described\r\nunder \"secondly\" in the above list of main divisions. To begin with the\r\nestimate of human nature here disclosed is to court alienation of the\r\nreader's interest, especially if the reader be a Gentile. We know from\r\nabundant sources what the Jewish estimate of human nature is, and it\r\ntallies in all respects with what is disclosed in the Protocols, but it\r\nhas always been one of the fallacies of Gentile thought that human\r\nnature is, now, full of dignity and nobility. There is little question,\r\nwhen the subject is considered in all its lights, that the Jewish\r\nconception is right. And so far as these Protocols are concerned, their\r\nlow estimate of mankind, though harsh to human pride and conceit, are\r\nvery largely true.\r\n\r\nJust to run through the Protocols and select the salient passages in\r\nwhich this view is expressed is to find a pretty complete philosophy of\r\nthe motives and qualities of human beings.\r\n\r\nTake these words from the First Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"It should be noted that people with evil instincts are more numerous\r\nthan those with good ones; therefore, the best results in governing them\r\nare attained by intimidation and violence, and not by academic argument.\r\nEvery man aims for power; everyone desires to be a dictator, if\r\npossible; moreover, few would not sacrifice the good of others to attain\r\ntheir own ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"People in masses and people of the masses are guided by exceptionally\r\nshallow passions, beliefs, customs, traditions and sentimental theories\r\nand are inclined toward party divisions, a fact which prevents any form\r\nof agreement, even when this is founded on a thoroughly logical basis.\r\nEvery decision of the mob depends upon an accidental or prearranged\r\nmajority, which, owing to its ignorance of the mysteries of political\r\nsecrets, gives expression to absurd decisions that introduce anarchy\r\ninto government.\"\r\n\r\n\"In working out an expedient plan of action, it is necessary to take\r\ninto consideration the meanness, the vacillation, the changeability of\r\nthe crowd * * * It is necessary to realize that the force of the masses\r\nis blind, unreasoning and unintelligent, prone to listen now to the\r\nright, and now to the left * * *\"\r\n\r\n\"Our triumph has also been made easier because, in our relations with\r\nthe people necessary to us, we have always played upon the most\r\nsensitive strings of the human mind--on calculation, greed, and the\r\ninsatiable material desires of men. Each of these human weaknesses,\r\ntaken separately, is capable of paralyzing initiative and placing the\r\nwill of the people at the disposal of the purchaser of their\r\nactivities.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Fifth Protocol, this shrewd observation on human nature is to be\r\nfound:\r\n\r\n\"In all times, nations as well as individuals, accepted words for acts.\r\nThey have been satisfied by what is shown them, rarely noticing whether\r\nthe promise has been followed by fulfillment. For this reason we will\r\norganize 'show' institutions which will conspicuously display their\r\ndevotion to progress.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this from the Eleventh Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"The Gentiles are like a flock of sheep * * * They will close their eyes\r\nto everything because we will promise them to return all the liberties\r\ntaken away, after the enemies of peace have been subjugated and all the\r\nparties pacified. Is it worth while to speak of how long they will have\r\nto wait? For what have we conceived all this program and instilled its\r\nmeasures into the minds of the Gentiles without giving them the\r\npossibility of examining its underside, if it is not for the purpose of\r\nattaining by circuitous methods that which is unattainable to our\r\nscattered race by a direct route?\"\r\n\r\nNotice also this very shrewd observation upon the \"joiners\" of secret\r\nsocieties--this estimate being made by the Protocols to indicate how\r\neasily these societies may be used to further the plan:\r\n\r\n\"Usually it is the climbers, careerists and people, generally speaking,\r\nwho are not serious, who most readily join secret societies, and we\r\nshall find them easy to handle and through them operate the mechanism of\r\nour projected machine.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks under this head are curtailed by the present writer, because\r\nthe Protocols make reference to a very important secret order, the\r\nmention of whose name in this connection might lead to misunderstanding,\r\nand which is therefore reserved for future and fuller attention. It\r\nwill, however, be of interest to the members of that order to see what\r\nthe Protocols have to say of it, and then check up the facts and see how\r\nfar they correspond with the words.\r\n\r\nTo continue: \"The Gentiles join lodges out of curiosity or in the hope\r\nthat through them they may worm their way into social distinction * * *\r\nWe therefore give them this success so that we can take advantage of the\r\nself-conceit to which it gives birth and because of which people\r\nunconsciously accept our suggestions without examination * * * You\r\ncannot imagine to what an extent the most intelligent Gentiles may be\r\nbrought to a state of unconscious naivete under conditions of\r\nself-deceit, and how easy it is to discourage them by the least failure,\r\neven the stopping of applause, or to bring them into a state of servile\r\nsubjection for the sake of regaining it. The Gentiles are as ready to\r\nsacrifice their plans for the sake of popular success as our people are\r\nto ignore success for the sake of carrying out our plans. This\r\npsychology of theirs facilitates the task of directing them.\"\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the passages in which this estimate of human or\r\nGentile nature is made out in words. But even if it were not so baldly\r\nstated, it could be easily inferred from various items in the program\r\nwhich was depended upon to break up Gentile solidarity and strength.\r\n\r\nThe method is one of disintegration. Break up the people into parties\r\nand sects. Sow abroad the most promising and utopian of ideas and you\r\nwill do two things: you will always find a group to cling to each idea\r\nyou throw out; and you will find this partisanship dividing and\r\nestranging the various groups. The authors of the Protocols show in\r\ndetail how this is to be done. Not one idea, but a mass of ideas are to\r\nbe thrown out, and there is to be no unity among them. The purpose is\r\nnot to get the people thinking one thing, but to think so diversely\r\nabout so many different things that there will be no unity among them.\r\nThe result of this will be vast disunity, vast unrest--and that is the\r\nresult aimed for.\r\n\r\nWhen once the solidarity of the Gentile society is broken up--and the\r\nname, \"Gentile society\" is perfectly correct, for human society is\r\noverwhelmingly Gentile--then this solid wedge of another idea which is\r\nnot at all affected by the prevailing confusion can make its way\r\nunsuspectedly to the place of control. It is well enough known that a\r\nbody of 20 trained police or soldiers can accomplish more than a\r\ndisordered mob of a thousand persons. So the minority initiated into the\r\nplan can do more with a nation or a world broken into a thousand\r\nantagonistic parties, than any of the parties could do. \"Divide and\r\nrule\" is the motto of the Protocols.\r\n\r\nThe division of society is perfectly easy, according to the estimate of\r\nhuman nature made in these documents. It is human nature to take\r\npromises for acts. No one who considered the list of dreams and vagaries\r\nand theories that have swayed the people through the centuries can doubt\r\nthis. The more utopian, the more butterfly-like the theory, the more it\r\ncommands public adherence. Just as the Protocols say, Gentile society\r\ndoes not scrutinize the origin or the consequences of the theories it\r\nadopts. When a theory makes its appeal to the mind, the tendency is to\r\nbelieve that the mind which receives it always had it in essence, and\r\ntherefore the experience has all the glow of original discovery.\r\n\r\nIn this manner, theory after theory has been exploited among the masses,\r\ntheory after theory has been found to be impracticable and has been\r\ndiscarded, but the result is precisely that which the program of the\r\nProtocols aims for--with the discarding of each theory, society is a\r\nlittle more broken than it was before. It is a little more helpless\r\nbefore its exploiters. It is a little more confused as to where to look\r\nfor leadership. As a consequence society falls an easy victim again to a\r\ntheory which promises it the good it seeks, and the failure of this\r\ntheory leaves it still more broken. There is no longer any such thing as\r\npublic opinion. Distrust and division are everywhere. And in the midst\r\nof the confusion everyone is dimly aware that there is a higher group\r\nthat is not divided at all, but is getting exactly what it wants by\r\nmeans of the confusion that obtains all around. It will be shown, as\r\nclaimed by the Protocols, that most of the disruptive theories abroad in\r\nthe world today are of Jewish origin; it will also be shown that the one\r\nsolid unbroken group in the world today, the group that knows where it\r\nwants to go and is going there regardless of the condition of society,\r\nis the Jewish group.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous theory of all is that which explains the rise of\r\ntheories and the social break-up which follows them. These are all\r\n\"symptoms of progress\" we are told. If so, then \"progress\" is toward\r\ndissolution. No one can predicate the fact of \"progress\" on the ground\r\nthat, whereas our fathers made wheels to go round with the blowing wind\r\nor the running water, we make them go round by successive small\r\nexplosions of gasoline. The question of \"progress\" is, Where are the\r\nwheels taking us? Was windmill and water wheel society better or worse\r\nthan the present society? Was it more unified in its morality? Did it\r\nmore highly respect law, did it produce a higher and sturdier type of\r\ncharacter?\r\n\r\nThe modern theory of \"ferment,\" that out of all the unrest and change\r\nand transvaluation of values a new and better mankind is to be evolved\r\nis not borne out by any fact on the horizon. It is palpably a theory\r\nwhose purpose is to make a seeming good out of that which is undeniable\r\nevil. The theories which cause the disruption and the theory which\r\nexplains the disruption as good, come from the same source. The whole\r\nscience of economics, conservative and radical, capitalistic and\r\nanarchistic, is of Jewish origin. This is another of the announcements\r\nof the Protocols which the facts confirm.\r\n\r\nNow, all this is accomplished, not by acts, but by words. The\r\nword-brokers of the world, those who wish words to do duty for things,\r\nin their dealings with the world outside their class, are undoubtedly\r\nthe Jewish group--the international Jews with which these articles\r\ndeal--and their philosophy and practice are precisely set forth in the\r\nProtocols.\r\n\r\nTake for illustration these passages: The first is from the First\r\nProtocol:\r\n\r\n\"Political freedom is an idea, not a fact. It is necessary to know how\r\nto apply this idea when there is need of a clever bait to gain the\r\nsupport of the people for one's party, if such a party has undertaken to\r\ndefeat another party already in power. This task is made easier if the\r\nopponent has himself been infected by principles of freedom or so-called\r\nliberalism, and for the sake of the idea will yield some of his own\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\nOr consider this from the Fifth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"To obtain control over public opinion, it is first necessary to confuse\r\nit by the expression from various sides of so many conflicting opinions\r\nthat the Gentiles will lose themselves in the labyrinth and come to\r\nunderstand that it is best to have no opinion on political questions,\r\nwhich it is not given to society at large to understand but only to the\r\nruler who directs society. This is the first secret.\r\n\r\n\"The second secret consists in so increasing and intensifying the\r\nshortcomings of the people in their habits, passions and mode of living\r\nthat no one will be able to collect himself in the chaos, and,\r\nconsequently, people will lose all their mutual understanding. This\r\nmeasure will serve us also in breeding disagreement in all parties, in\r\ndisintegrating all those collective forces which are still unwilling to\r\nsubmit to us and in discouraging all personal initiative which can in\r\nany way interfere with our undertaking.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this from the Thirteenth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"* * * and you may also notice that we seek approval, not for our acts,\r\nbut for our words uttered in regard to one or another question. We\r\nalways announce publicly that we are guided in all our measures by the\r\nhope and the conviction that we are serving the general good.\r\n\r\n\"To divert over-restless people from discussing political questions, we\r\nshall now bring forward new problems apparently connected with the\r\npeople--problems of industry. In these, let them lose themselves as much\r\nas they like. Under such conditions we shall make them think that the\r\nnew questions have also a political bearing.\"\r\n\r\n(It is to be hoped that the reader, as his eye passes over these details\r\nof the Program, is also permitting his mind to pass over the trend of\r\nevents, to see if he may detect for himself these very developments in\r\nthe life and thought of the past few years.)\r\n\r\n\"To prevent them from really thinking out anything themselves, we shall\r\ndeflect their attention to amusements, games, pastimes, excitements and\r\npeople's palaces. Such interests will distract their minds completely\r\nfrom questions on which we might be obliged to struggle with them.\r\nBecoming less and less accustomed to independent thinking, people will\r\nexpress themselves in unison with us because we alone offer new lines of\r\nthought--of course, through persons whom they do not consider as in any\r\nway connected with us.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same Protocol it is plainly stated what is the purpose of the\r\noutput of \"liberal\" theories, of which Jewish writers, poets, rabbis,\r\nsocieties and influences are the most prolific sources:\r\n\r\n\"The role of the liberal Utopians will be completely played out when our\r\ngovernment is recognized. Until that time they will perform good\r\nservice. For that reason we will continue to direct thought into all the\r\nintricacies of fantastic theories, new and supposedly progressive.\r\nSurely we have been completely successful in turning the witless heads\r\nof the Gentiles by the word 'progress.'\"\r\n\r\nHere is the whole program of confusing, enervating, and trivializing the\r\nmind of the world. And it would be the most outlandish thought to put\r\ninto words, were it not possible to show that this is just what has been\r\ndone, and is still being done, by agencies which are highly lauded and\r\neasy to be identified among us.\r\n\r\nA recent writer in a prominent magazine has pointed out what he calls\r\nthe impossibility of the Jewish ruling group being allied in one common\r\nWorld Program because, as he showed, there were Jews acting as leading\r\nminds in all the divisions of present-day opinion. There were Jews at\r\nthe head of the capitalists, Jews at the head of the labor unions, and\r\nJews at the head of those more radical organizations which find even the\r\nlabor unions too tame. There is a Jew at the head of the judiciary of\r\nEngland and a Jew at the head of Sovietism in Russia. How can you say,\r\nhe asked, that they are united, when they represent so many points of\r\nview?\r\n\r\nThe common unity, the possible common purpose of it all, is thus\r\nexpressed in the Ninth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"People of all opinions and of all doctrines are at our service,\r\nrestorers of monarchy, demagogues, Socialists, communists and other\r\nUtopians. We have put them all to work. Every one of them from his point\r\nof view is undermining the last remnant of authority, is trying to\r\noverthrow all existing order. All the governments have been tormented by\r\nthese actions. But we will not give them peace until they recognize our\r\nsuper-government.\"\r\n\r\nThe function of the idea is referred to in the Tenth Protocol also:\r\n\r\n\"When we introduced the poison of liberalism into the government\r\norganism, its entire political complexion changed.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole outlook of these Protocols upon the world is that the idea may\r\nbe made a most potent poison. The authors of these documents do not\r\nbelieve in liberalism, they do not believe in democracy, but they lay\r\nplans for the constant preaching of these ideas because of their power\r\nto break up society, to divide it into groups, to destroy the power of\r\ncollective opinion through a variety of convictions. The poison of an\r\nidea is their most relied-on weapon.\r\n\r\nThe plan of thus using ideas extends to education:\r\n\r\n\"We have misled, stupefied and demoralized the youth of the Gentiles by\r\nmeans of education in principles and theories, patently false to us, but\r\nwhich we have inspired.\"--Protocol 9.\r\n\r\nIt extends also to family life:\r\n\r\n\"Having in this way inspired everybody with the thought of his own\r\nimportance, we will break down the influence of family life among the\r\nGentiles, and its educational importance.\"--Protocol 10.\r\n\r\nAnd in a passage which might well provide the material for long\r\nexamination and contemplation by the thoughtful reader, this is said:\r\n\r\n\"Until the time is ripe, let them amuse themselves * * * Let those\r\ntheories of life which we have induced them to regard as the dictates of\r\nscience play the most important role for them. To this end we shall\r\nendeavor to inspire blind confidence in these theories by means of our\r\nPress * * *\r\n\r\n\"Note the successes we have arranged in Darwinism, Marxism, and\r\nNietzscheism. The demoralizing effect of these doctrines upon the minds\r\nof the Gentiles should be evident at least to us.\"--Protocol 2.\r\n\r\nThat this disintegration and division of Gentile society was proceeding\r\nat a favorable rate when the Protocols were uttered is evident from\r\nevery line of them. For it must be remembered that the Protocols are not\r\nbidding for support for a proposed program, but are announcing progress\r\non a program which has been in process of fulfillment for \"centuries\"\r\nand \"from ancient times.\" They contain a series of statements regarding\r\nthings accomplished, as well as a forelook at things yet to be\r\naccomplished. The split of Gentile society was very satisfactorily\r\nproceeding in 1896, or thereabouts, when these oracles were uttered.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that the purpose is nowhere stated to be the\r\nextermination of the Gentiles, but their subjugation, at first under the\r\ninvisible rule which is proposed in these documents, at length under the\r\nrule of one whom the invisible forces would be able to put in control of\r\nthe world through political changes which would create an office of\r\nWorld President or Autocrat. The Gentiles are to be subdued, first\r\nintellectually, as here shown, and then economically. Nowhere is it\r\nhinted that they are to be deprived of the earth, but only of their\r\nindependence of those whom the Protocols represent to be Jews.\r\n\r\nHow far the division of society had proceeded when these Protocols were\r\ngiven may be gathered from the Fifth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"A world coalition of Gentiles could cope with us temporarily, but we\r\nare assured against this by roots of dissension among them so deep that\r\nthey cannot be torn out. We have created antagonism between the personal\r\nand national interests of the Gentiles by arousing religious and race\r\nhatreds which we have nourished in their hearts for twenty centuries.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as that concerns the dissensions of the Gentiles or Christian\r\nworld, it is absolutely true. And we have seen in our own nation how\r\n\"the antagonism between personal and national interests\" have rested on\r\n\"religious and race hatreds.\" But whoever suspected a common source for\r\nthese? More amazing still, who would expect any man or group to avow\r\nthemselves the source? Yet it is thus written in the Protocols--\"we have\r\ncreated the antagonism--we thus assure ourselves against the possibility\r\nof a Gentile coalition against us.\" And whether these Protocols are of\r\nJewish origin or not, whether they represent Jewish interests or not,\r\nthis is exactly the state of the world, of the Gentile world, today.\r\n\r\nBut a still deeper division is aimed for, and there are signs of even\r\nthis coming to pass. Indeed, in Russia it has already come to pass, the\r\nspectacle of a Gentile lower class led by Jewish leaders against a\r\nGentile upper class! In the First Protocol, describing the effects of a\r\nspeculative industrial system upon the people, it is said that this sort\r\nof economic folly--\r\n\r\n\"* * * has already created and will continue to create a society which\r\nis disillusioned, cold and heartless. Such a society is completely\r\nestranged from politics and religion. Lust of gold will be the only\r\nguide of the people * * * THEN, not for the sake of good, nor even for\r\nthe sake of riches, but solely on account of their hatred of the\r\nprivileged classes, the lower classes of the Gentiles will follow us in\r\nthe struggle against our rivals for power, the Gentiles of the\r\nintellectual classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lower classes of the Gentiles will follow us * * * against * * *\r\nthe Gentiles of the intellectual classes.\"\r\n\r\nIf that struggle were to occur today, the leaders of the Gentile\r\ninsurgents against Gentile society would be Jewish leaders. They are in\r\nthe leader's place now--not only in Russia, but also in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Issue of July 31, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is all the difference in the world,\" said a young Jewish\r\nphilosopher, \"between an American Jew and a Jewish American. A Jewish\r\nAmerican is a mere amateur Gentile, doomed to be a parasite forever.\"\r\n\r\n--\"The Conquering Jew,\" p. 91.\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\"Jewish Protocols\" Claim Partial Fulfillment\r\n\r\n\"With the present instability of all authority, our power will be more\r\nunassailable than any other, because it will be invisible until it has\r\ngained such strength that no cunning can undermine it.\"--Protocol 1.\r\n\r\n\"It is indispensable for our purposes that, as far as possible, wars\r\nshould bring no territorial advantages. This will shift war to an\r\neconomic footing . . . . Such a condition of affairs will place both\r\nsides under the control of our international agents with their million\r\neyes, whose vision is unhampered by any frontiers. Then, our\r\ninternational rights will eliminate national rights in the narrow\r\nsense, and will govern the governments as they govern their\r\nsubjects.\"--Protocol 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a mere literary curiosity, these documents which are called \"The\r\nProtocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\" would exercise a fascination by\r\nreason of the terrible completeness of the World Plan which they\r\ndisclose. But they discourage at every turn the view that they are\r\nliterature; they purport to be statesmanship, and they provide within\r\ntheir own lines the clue by which their status may be determined.\r\nBesides the things they look forward to doing, they announce the things\r\nthey have done and are doing. If, in looking about the world, it is\r\npossible to see both the established conditions and the strong\r\ntendencies to which these Protocols allude, it will not be strange if\r\ninterest in a mere literary curiosity gives way to something like\r\nalertness, and it may be alarm.\r\n\r\nA few general quotations will serve to illustrate the element of present\r\nachievement in the assertions of these documents, and in order that the\r\npoint may be made clear to the reader the key words will be emphasized.\r\n\r\nTake this from Protocol Nine:\r\n\r\n\"In reality there are no obstacles before us. Our super-government has\r\nsuch an extra-legal status that it may be called by the energetic and\r\nstrong word--dictatorship. I can conscientiously say that, at the\r\npresent time, we are the lawmakers. We create courts and jurisprudence.\r\nWe rule with a strong will because we hold in our hands the remains of a\r\nonce strong party, now subjugated by us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this from the Eighth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"We will surround our government with a whole world of economists. It is\r\nfor this reason that the science of economics is the chief subject of\r\ninstruction taught by the Jews. We shall be surrounded by a whole galaxy\r\nof bankers, industrialists, capitalists, and especially by millionaires\r\nbecause, actually, everything will be decided by an appeal to figures.\"\r\n\r\nThese are strong claims, but not too strong for the facts that can be\r\nmarshaled to illustrate them. They are, however, but an introduction to\r\nfurther claims that are made and equally paralleled by the facts. All\r\nthrough the Protocols, as in this quotation from the Eighth, the\r\npre-eminence of the Jews in the teaching of political economy is\r\ninsisted upon, and the facts bear that out. They are the chief authors\r\nof those vagaries which lead the mob after economic impossibilities, and\r\nthey are also the chief teachers of political economy in our\r\nuniversities, the chief authors of those popular textbooks in the\r\nsubject, which hold the conservative classes to the fiction that\r\neconomic theories are economic laws. The idea, the theory, as\r\ninstruments of social disintegration are common to both the university\r\nJew and the Bolshevik Jew. When all this is shown in detail, public\r\nopinion upon the importance of academic and radical economics may\r\nundergo a change.\r\n\r\nAnd, as claimed in the quotation just given from the Ninth Protocol, the\r\nJewish world power does today constitute a super-government. It is the\r\nProtocol's own word, and none is more fitting. No nation can get all\r\nthat it wants, but the Jewish World Power can get all that it wants,\r\neven though its demands exceed Gentile equality. \"We are the lawmakers,\"\r\nsay the Protocols, and Jewish influences have been lawmakers in a\r\ngreater degree than any but the specialists realize. In the past ten\r\nyears Jewish international rule, or the power of the group of\r\nInternational Jews has quite dominated the world. More than that, it has\r\nbeen powerful enough to prevent the passage of salutary laws, and where\r\none law may have slipped through to a place on the statute books, it has\r\nbeen powerful enough to get it interpreted in a sense that rendered it\r\nuseless for its purpose. This, too, can be illustrated by a large\r\ncollection of facts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the method by which this is done was outlined long ago in the\r\nprogram of which the Protocols purport to be an outline. \"We create\r\ncourts,\" continues the quotation, and it is followed in other Protocols\r\nby numerous references to \"our judges.\" There is a Jewish court sitting\r\nin a public building in the city of New York every week, and other\r\ncourts, for the sole advantage and use of this people whose spokesmen\r\ndeny that they are a \"separate people,\" are in formation everywhere. The\r\nZionist plan has already been used in some of the smaller European\r\ncountries to confer an extra-citizenship upon Jews who already enjoy\r\ncitizenship in the lands of their residence, and in addition to that a\r\ndegree of self-rule under the very governments which they demand to\r\nprotect them. Wherever Jewish tendencies are permitted to work\r\nunhindered, the result is not \"Americanization,\" or \"Anglicization\" nor\r\nany other distinctive nationalism, but a strong and ruling reversion\r\nback to essential \"Judaization.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"agents\" referred to in the first quotation will receive attention\r\nin another article. To resume the claims of the Protocols: This from the\r\nSeventeenth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"We have taken good care long ago to discredit the Gentile clergy and\r\nthereby to destroy their mission, which at present might hamper us\r\nconsiderably. Their influence over the people diminishes daily.\r\n\r\n\"Freedom of conscience has been proclaimed everywhere. Consequently it\r\nis only a question of time when the complete crash of the Christian\r\nreligion will occur. It will be easier to handle the other religions,\r\nbut it is too early to discuss this phase of the subject.\"\r\n\r\nThis will be of considerable interest, perhaps, to those clergymen who\r\nare laboring with Jewish rabbis to bring about some kind of religious\r\nunion. Such a union would of necessity dispose of Christ as a\r\nwell-meaning but wholly mistaken Jewish prophet, and thus distinctive\r\nChristianity would cease to exist insofar as the \"union\" was effective.\r\nThe principal religious aversion of the Protocols, however, so far as it\r\nis expressed, is against the Catholic church in general and the\r\npontifical office in particular.\r\n\r\nA curious paragraph in this Protocol claims for the Jewish race a\r\nparticular skill in the art of insult:\r\n\r\n\"Our contemporary press will expose governmental and religious affairs\r\nand the incapacity of the Gentiles, always using expressions so\r\nderogatory as to approach insult, the faculty of employing which is so\r\nwell known to our race.\"\r\n\r\nThis from the Fifth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"Under our influence the execution of the laws of the Gentiles is\r\nreduced to a minimum. Respect for the law is undermined by the liberal\r\ninterpretation we have introduced in this sphere. The courts decide as\r\nwe dictate, even in the most important cases in which are involved\r\nfundamental principles or political issues, viewing them in the light in\r\nwhich we present them to the Gentile administration through agents with\r\nwhom we have apparently nothing in common, through newspaper opinion and\r\nother avenues.\r\n\r\n\"In Gentile society where we have planted discord and protestantism * *\r\n* *\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"protestantism\" is evidently not used in the religious or\r\nsectarian sense, but to denote a temper of querulous fault-finding\r\ndestructive of harmonious collective opinion.\r\n\r\nThis from the Fourteenth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"In countries called advanced, we have created a senseless, filthy and\r\ndisgusting literature. For a short time after our entrance into power we\r\nshall encourage its existence so that it may show in greater relief the\r\ncontrast between it and the written and spoken announcements which will\r\nemanate from us.\"\r\n\r\nDiscussing in the Twelfth Protocol the control of the Press--a subject\r\nwhich must be treated more extensively in another article--the claim is\r\nmade:\r\n\r\n\"We have attained this at the present time to the extent that all news\r\nis received through several agencies in which it is centralized from all\r\nparts of the world. These agencies will then be to all intents and\r\npurposes our own institutions and will publish only that which we\r\npermit.\"\r\n\r\nThis from the Seventh Protocol bears on the same subject:\r\n\r\n\"We must force the Gentile governments to adopt measures which will\r\npromote our broadly conceived plan, already approaching its triumphant\r\ngoal, by bringing to bear the pressure of stimulated public opinion,\r\nwhich has been organized by us with the help of the so-called 'great\r\npower' of the press. With a few exceptions not worth considering, it is\r\nalready in our hands.\"\r\n\r\nTo resume the Twelfth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"If we have already managed to dominate the mind of Gentile society to\r\nsuch a point that almost all see world affairs through the colored\r\nlenses of the spectacles which we place before their eyes, and if now\r\nthere is not one government with barriers erected against our access to\r\nthat which by Gentile stupidity is called state secrets, what then will\r\nit be when we are the recognized masters of the world in the person of\r\nour universal ruler?\"\r\n\r\nThe Jewish nation is the only nation that possesses the secrets of all\r\nthe rest. No nation long protects a secret which directly concerns\r\nanother nation, but even so, no nation has all the secrets of all the\r\nother nations. Yet it is not too much to say that the International Jews\r\nhave this knowledge. Much of it, of course, amounts to nothing and their\r\npossession of it does not materially add to their power, but the fact\r\nthat they have the access, that they can get whatever they want when\r\nthey want it is the important point--as many a secret paper could\r\ntestify if it could talk, and many a custodian of secret papers could\r\ntell if he would. The real secret diplomacy of the world is that which\r\nhands over the world's so-called secrets to a few men who are members of\r\none race. The surface of diplomacy, those activities which get written\r\ndown in the memoirs of comfortably aging statesmen, those coups and\r\ntreaties which are given high-sounding fame as if they really were\r\nimportant--that is incomparable with the diplomacy of Judah, and its\r\nmatchless enginery for worming out the hidden knowledge of every ruling\r\ngroup. The United States is included in all these statements. Perhaps\r\nthere is no government in the world so completely at their service as\r\nour own at present, their control having been gained during the past\r\nfive or six years.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols do not regard the dispersal of the Jews abroad upon the\r\nface of the earth as a calamity, but as a providential arrangement by\r\nwhich the World Plan can be more certainly executed, as see these words\r\nof the Eleventh Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"God gave to us, His Chosen People, as a blessing, the dispersal, and\r\nthis which has appeared to all to be our weakness has been our whole\r\nstrength. It has now brought us to the threshold of universal rule.\"\r\n\r\nThe claims to accomplishment which are put forth in the Ninth Protocol\r\nwould be too massive for words were they too massive for concrete\r\nrealization, but there is a point where the word and the actuality meet\r\nand tally.\r\n\r\n\"In order not to destroy prematurely the Gentile institutions, we have\r\nlaid our efficient hands on them, and rasped the springs of their\r\nmechanism. They were formerly in strict and just order, but we have\r\nreplaced them with a liberal disorganized and arbitrary administration.\r\nWe have tampered with jurisprudence, the franchise, the press, freedom\r\nof the person, and, most important of all, education and culture, the\r\ncorner stone of free existence.\r\n\r\n\"We have misled, stupefied and demoralized the youth of the Gentiles by\r\nmeans of education in principles and theories patently false to us, but\r\nwhich we have inspired.\r\n\r\n\"Above existing laws, without actual change but by distorting them\r\nthrough contradictory interpretations, we have created something\r\nstupendous in the way of results.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that, in spite of the fact that the air was never so full\r\nof theories of liberty and wild declarations of \"rights,\" there has been\r\na steady curtailment of \"personal freedom.\" Instead of being socialized,\r\nthe people, under a cover of socialistic phrases, are being brought\r\nunder an unaccustomed bondage to the state. The Public Health is one\r\nplea. Various forms of Public Safety are other pleas. Children are\r\nhardly free to play nowadays except under play-masters appointed by the\r\nState, among whom, curiously enough, an astonishing proportion of Jews\r\nmanage to find a place. The streets are no longer as free as they were;\r\nlaws of every kind are hedging upon the harmless liberties of the\r\npeople. A steady tendency toward systemization, every phase of the\r\ntendency based upon some very learnedly stated \"principle,\" has set in,\r\nand curiously enough, when the investigator pursues his way to the\r\nauthoritative center of these movements for the regulation of people's\r\nlife, he finds Jews in power. Children are being lured away from the\r\n\"social center\" of the home for other \"centers\"; they are being led away\r\n(and we are speaking of Gentile children--no Gentiles are ever allowed\r\nto regulate the lives of Jewish children) from their natural leaders in\r\nhome, church and school, to institutionalized \"centers\" and scientific\r\n\"play spots,\" under \"trained leaders\" whose whole effect, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, is to lead the modern child to look to the State, instead\r\nof its natural environment, for leadership. All this focuses up to the\r\nWorld Plan for the subjugation of the Gentiles, and if it is not the\r\nJewish World Plan it would be interesting to know why the material for\r\nit is so largely Gentile children and the leaders of it so often of the\r\nJewish race.\r\n\r\nJewish liberties are the best safeguarded in the United States. Gentiles\r\ntake their chance with public matters, but every Jewish community is\r\nsurrounded by special protectors who gain special recognition by various\r\ndevices--political and business threats not the least of them. No public\r\nspirited Gentiles are welcomed to the task of regulating the lives of\r\nJewish children. The Jewish community in every city is all-sufficient in\r\nitself as far as such activities go. The most secret of all parochial\r\nschools are the Jewish schools, whose very locations are not all known\r\nto the officials of large cities. The Jew is almost anxious in his\r\nefforts to mold the Gentile mind; he insists on being permitted to tell\r\nthe Gentile what to think, especially about the Jew; he is not averse to\r\ninfluencing general Gentile thought in a manner which, though it come\r\nabout by wide circles, works ultimately into the Jewish scheme of\r\nthings. The anxiety and the insistence, so well known to all who have\r\nobserved them, are only reflections of the Jew's conviction that his is\r\nthe superior race and is capable of directing the inferior race--of\r\nwhich there is but one, including the whole non-Jewish world.\r\n\r\nEvery influence that leads to lightness and looseness in Gentile youth\r\ntoday heads up in a Jewish source. Did the young people of the world\r\ndevise the \"sport clothes\" which have had so deleterious an effect on\r\nthe youth of the times that every publicist has thought it worthy of\r\nmention? Those styles come out of Jewish clothing concerns, where\r\ncertainly art is not the rule nor moral influence the main\r\nconsideration. The moving picture is an interesting development of\r\nphotography allied with the show business, but whose is the\r\nresponsibility for its development along such lines as make it a menace\r\nto the minds of millions--so serious a menace that it has not escaped\r\nobservation and condemnation everywhere? Who are the masters of musical\r\njazz in the world? Who direct all the cheap jewelry houses, the\r\nbridge-head show parks, the \"coney islands,\" the centers of nervous\r\nthrills and looseness? It is possible to take the showy young man and\r\nwoman of trivial outlook and loose sense of responsibility, and tag them\r\noutwardly and inwardly from their clothing and ornaments to their hectic\r\nideas and hopes, with the same tag, \"Made, introduced and exploited by a\r\nJew.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, something most sinister in the light which events\r\ncast upon that paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"We have misled, stupefied, and demoralized the youth of the Gentiles by\r\nmeans of education in principles and theories, patently false to us but\r\nwhich we have inspired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Principles and theories\" do not necessarily imply lofty or even modest\r\nintellectual qualities. The youngster who spends his noon hours and\r\nevenings at the movies is getting his \"principles and theories\" just as\r\nthe more intellectual youngster from a higher grade of society who\r\nlistens to a Jewish \"liberal\" expound \"sex liberty\" and the \"control of\r\npopulation\" is getting his. The looseness which inheres in these\r\n\"principles and theories\" does not emanate from the Gentile home, or the\r\nGentile church, or from any line of money-making which is filled\r\nprincipally with Gentiles, but from theories, movements and lines of\r\nmoney-making mostly fancied by Jews. This line of accusation could be\r\nrun much deeper, but it is preferred to restrict it to what is\r\nobservable by decent eyes everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd that \"the youth of the Gentiles\" are the principal victims, and not\r\nthe youth of the Jews, is also observable. While a certain percentage of\r\nJewish youth itself is overcome by this social poison, the percentage is\r\nalmost nothing compared with the results among the youth of the\r\nGentiles. It is a significant fact that Jews who link this process of\r\nenervation of Gentiles with large profits are not themselves, nor are\r\ntheir sons and daughters, the victims of this enervation. Jewish youth\r\ncomes through more proudly and more cleanly than the mass of Gentile\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nMany a father and mother, many a sound-minded, uncorrupted young person,\r\nand thousands of teachers and publicists have cried out against luxury.\r\nMany a financier, observing the manner in which the people earned and\r\nflung away their money, has warned against luxury. Many an economist,\r\nknowing that the nonessential industries were consuming men and\r\nmaterials that were necessary to the stabilizing of essential\r\nindustries; knowing that men are making knick-knacks who should be\r\nmaking steel; knowing that men are engaged in making gew-gaws who should\r\nbe working on the farm; that materials are going into articles that are\r\nmade only to sell and never to use, and that materials are thus diverted\r\nfrom the industries that support the people's life--every observer\r\nknowing this crazy insistence on luxurious nonessentials has lifted up a\r\nstrong voice against it.\r\n\r\nBut, according to these Protocols, we have been starting at the wrong\r\nend. The people, it is true, buy these senseless nonessentials which are\r\ncalled luxuries. But the people do not devise them. And the people grow\r\ntired of them one by one. But the stream of varieties continues--always\r\nsomething else being thrust at the people, dangled before their eyes,\r\nset bobbing down the avenue on enough mannikins to give the impression\r\nthat it is \"style\"; newspaper print and newspaper pictures; movie\r\npictures; stage costumes enough to force the new thing into \"fashion\"\r\nwith a kind of force and compulsion which no really worthy essential\r\nthing can command.\r\n\r\nWhere does it come from? What power exists whose long experience and\r\ndeliberate intent enable it to frivolize the people's minds and tastes\r\nand compel them to pay most of their money for it too? Why this spasm of\r\nluxury and extravagance through which we have just passed? How did it\r\noccur that before luxury and extravagance were apparent, all the\r\nmaterial to provoke and inflame them had been prepared beforehand and\r\nshipped beforehand, ready for the stampede which also had been prepared?\r\n\r\nIf the people of the United States would stop to consider, when the\r\nuseless and expensive thing is offered them--if they would trace its\r\norigin, trace the course of the enormous profits made out of it, trace\r\nthe whole movement to flood the market with uselessness and extravagance\r\nand thus demoralize the Gentile public financially, intellectually, and\r\nsocially--if, in short, it could be made clear to them that Jewish\r\nfinancial interests are not only pandering to the loosest elements in\r\nhuman nature, but actually engaged in a calculated effort to render them\r\nloose in the first place and keep them loose--it would do more than\r\nanything else to stop this sixfold waste--the waste of material, the\r\nwaste of labor, the waste of Gentile money, the waste of Gentile mind,\r\nthe waste of Jewish talent, and the worse than waste of Israel's real\r\nusefulness to the world.\r\n\r\nWe say the Gentile public is the victim of this stimulated trade in\r\nuseless luxuries. Did you ever see Jewish people so victimized? They\r\nmight wear very noticeable clothing, but its price and its quality\r\nagree. They might wear rather large diamonds, but they are diamonds. The\r\nJew is not the victim of the Jew, the craze for luxuries is just like\r\nthe \"coney island\" crowd to him; he knows what attracts them and the\r\nworthlessness of it.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not so much the financial loss that is to be mourned, nor yet\r\nthe atrocities committed upon good taste, but the fact that the silly\r\nGentile crowds walk into the net willingly, even gaily, supposing the\r\nchange of the fashion to be as inevitable as the coming of spring,\r\nsupposing the new demand on their earnings to be as necessary and as\r\nnatural as taxes. The crowds think that somehow they have part in it,\r\nwhen their only part is to pay, and then pay again for the new\r\nextravagance when the present one palls. There are men in this country\r\nwho know two years ahead what the frivolities and extravagances of the\r\npeople will be, because they decree what they shall be. These things are\r\nstrictly business, demoralizing to the Gentile majority, enriching to\r\nthe Jewish minority.\r\n\r\nLook at the Sixth Protocol for a sidelight on all this:\r\n\r\nThis is an excerpt from a longer passage dealing with the plans by which\r\nthe people's interest could be swung from political to industrial\r\nquestions, how industry could be made insecure and unfair by the\r\nintroduction of speculation into its management, and finally how against\r\nthis condition the people could be rendered restless and helpless.\r\nLuxury was to be the instrument:\r\n\r\n\"To destroy Gentile industry, we shall, as an incentive to this\r\nspeculation, encourage among the Gentiles a strong demand for\r\nluxuries--all enticing luxuries.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the First Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"Surely we cannot allow our own people to come to this. The people of\r\nthe Gentiles are stupefied with spirituous liquors * * *\"\r\n\r\n--incidentally, the profits of spirituous liquors flow in large amounts\r\nto Jewish pockets. The history of the whiskey ring in this country will\r\nshow this. Historically, the whole prohibition movement may be described\r\nas a contest between Gentile and Jewish capital, and in this instance,\r\nthanks to the Gentile majority, the Gentiles won.\r\n\r\nThe amusement, gambling, jazz song, scarlet fiction, side show,\r\ncheap-dear fashions, flashy jewelry, and every other activity that lived\r\nby reason of an invisible pressure upon the people, and that exchanged\r\nthe most useless of commodities for the prices that would just exhaust\r\nthe people's money surplus and no more--every such activity has been\r\nunder the mastery of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThey may not be conscious of their participation in any wholesale\r\ndemoralization of the people. They may only be conscious of \"easy\r\nmoney.\" They may sometimes yield to surprise as they contrast the silly\r\nGentiles with their own money-wise and fabric-wise and metal-wise Jews.\r\nBut however this may be, there is the conception of a program by which a\r\npeople may be deliberately devastated materially and spiritually, and\r\nyet kept pleasant all the time--and there also is the same program\r\ntranslated into terms of daily transactions and for the most part,\r\nperhaps altogether under control of the members of one race.\r\n\r\n[Issue of August 7, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\"Jewish\" Plan to Split Society by \"Ideas\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method by which the Protocols work for the breakdown of society\r\nshould now be fairly evident to readers of these articles. An\r\nunderstanding of the method is necessary if one is to find the meaning\r\nof the currents and cross-currents which make so hopeless a hodge-podge\r\nof the present times. People who are confused and discouraged by the\r\nvarious voices and discordant theories of today, each seeming to be\r\nplausible and promising, may find a clear clue to the value of the\r\nvoices and the meaning of the theories if they understand that their\r\nconfusion and discouragement comprise the very objective which is\r\nsought. The uncertainty, hesitation, hopelessness, fear; the eagerness\r\nwith which every promising plan and offered solution is grasped--these\r\nare the very reactions which the program outlined in the Protocols aims\r\nto produce. The condition is proof of the efficacy of the program.\r\n\r\nIt is a method that takes time, and the Protocols declare that it has\r\ntaken time, indeed, centuries. Students of the matter find the identical\r\nprogram of the Protocols, announced and operated by the Jewish race,\r\nfrom the first century onward.\r\n\r\nIt has taken 1900 years to bring Europe to its present degree of\r\nsubjugation--violent subjugation in some countries, political\r\nsubjugation in some, economic subjugation in all--but in America the\r\nsame program, with almost the same degree of success, has required about\r\n50 years. Certain mistaken ideas of liberalism, certain flabby ideas of\r\ntolerance, all of them originating at European sources which the\r\nProtocolists had completely polluted, were transported to America, and\r\nhere under cover of the blindness and innocence of a false liberalism\r\nand tolerance, together with modern appliances for the swift\r\nacceleration of opinion, there has been worked a subjugation of our\r\ninstitutions and public thought which is the amazement of European\r\nobservers. It is a fact that some of the important students of the\r\nJewish Question, whom Jewish publicists are pleased to damn with the\r\nterm \"Anti-Semites,\" have been awakened to the existence of the Question\r\nnot by what they have observed in Europe, but by what they have seen in\r\nthe swift and distinct \"close-up\" which has been afforded in American\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe center of Jewish power, the principal sponsors of the Jewish\r\nprogram, are resident in America, and the leverage which was used at the\r\nPeace Conference to fasten Jewish power more securely upon Europe, was\r\nAmerican leverage exercised at the behest of the strong Jewish pressure\r\nwhich was brought from the United States for that purpose. And these\r\nactivities did not end with the Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nThe whole method of the Protocols may be described in one word,\r\nDisintegration. The undoing of what has been done, the creation of a\r\nlong and hopeless interim in which attempts at reconstruction shall be\r\nbaffled, and the gradual wearing down of public opinion and public\r\nconfidence, until those who stand outside the created chaos shall insert\r\ntheir strong calm hand to seize control--that is the whole method of\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nPutting together the estimate of human nature which obtains in these\r\nProtocols, and their claims to a rather definite though as yet\r\nincomplete fulfillment of the World Program (these two comprising the\r\nthemes of the previous two articles), some of the aspects of this\r\npropaganda of disintegration have become clear. But not all of them.\r\nThere are yet other aspects of these methods, which will be dealt with\r\nin the present article, and there are yet future reaches of the program\r\nwhich will be considered later.\r\n\r\nThe first point of attack is Collective Opinion, that body of ideas\r\nwhich through men's agreement with them, holds large groups together in\r\npolitical, racial, religious, or social unity. Sometimes we call them\r\n\"standards,\" sometimes we call them \"ideals\"; whatever they may be\r\ncalled, they are the invisible bonds of unity, they are the common\r\nfaith, they are the great overarching reason for group unity and\r\nloyalty.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols assert that here the first attack has been made. The\r\nhistory of Jewish propaganda in the world shows that also.\r\n\r\nThe first wave of attack is to corrupt Collective Opinion. Now, to\r\n\"corrupt\" in the real sense does not mean anything unsavory or unclean.\r\nThe whole power of every heresy is its attractiveness to the good mind.\r\nThe whole explanation of the strong hold which untruth has gained upon\r\nthe world of our day, is that the untruth is reasonable, inspiring and\r\napparently good. It is only after a long discipline in false\r\nideals--which are reasonable, inspiring and good--that the evil fruits\r\nappear in acts and conditions which are unreasonable, destructive and\r\nwholly evil. If you will trace the idea of Liberty as it has appeared in\r\nRussian history, from its philosophic beginning (a Jewish beginning, by\r\nthe way) to its present ending (a Jewish ending also), you will see the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols claim that the Gentiles are not thinkers, that attractive\r\nideas have been thrown at them so strategically and persistently that\r\nthe power of thought is almost destroyed out of them. Fortunately this\r\nis a matter on which any Gentile may apply his own test. If he will\r\nsegregate his ruling ideas, especially those that center round the\r\nthought of \"democracy,\" he will discover that he is being ruled in his\r\nmind by a whole company of ideas into whose authority over him he has\r\nnot inquired at all. He is ruled by \"say so\" whose origin he has not\r\ntraced. And when, pursuing those ideas, he finds that they are not\r\npracticable, he is received by the explanation that \"we are not yet\r\nsufficiently advanced.\" Yet when he does see men who are sufficiently\r\n\"advanced\" to put these very ideas into operation, he recoils from what\r\nhe sees them do, because he knows that \"advancement\" such as that is\r\ndeterioration--a form of disintegration. Yet every one of the ideas were\r\n\"good,\" \"reasonable,\" \"inspiring,\" \"humane,\" to begin with. And, if this\r\nGentile will observe a little further, he will see that they are the\r\nmost persistently preached ideas in the world; he will also see who the\r\npreachers are.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols distinctly declare that it is by means of the set of\r\nideals which cluster around \"democracy,\" that their first victory over\r\npublic opinion was obtained. The idea is the weapon. And to be a weapon\r\nit must be an idea at variance with the natural trend of life. It must\r\nindeed be a theory opposed to the facts of life. And no theory so\r\nopposed can be expected to take root and become the ruling factor,\r\nunless it appeals to the mind as reasonable, inspiring and good. The\r\nTruth frequently seems unreasonable; the Truth frequently is depressing;\r\nthe Truth sometimes seems to be evil; but it has this eternal advantage,\r\nit is the Truth, and what is built thereon neither brings nor yields to\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThis first step does not give the control of public opinion, but leads\r\nup to it. It is worthy of note that it is the sowing of \"the poison of\r\nliberalism,\" as the Protocols name it, which comes first in order in\r\nthose documents. Then, following upon that, the Protocols say:\r\n\r\n\"To obtain control over public opinion it is first necessary to confuse\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nTruth is one and cannot be confused, but this false, appealing\r\nliberalism which has been sown broadcast, and which is ripening faster\r\nunder Jewish nurture in America than ever it did in Europe, is easily\r\nconfused because it is not truth. It is error, and error has a thousand\r\nforms. Take a nation, a party, a city, an association in which \"the\r\npoison of liberalism\" has been sown, and you can split that up into as\r\nmany factions as there are individuals simply by throwing among them\r\ncertain modifications of the original idea. This is a piece of strategy\r\nwell known to the forces that invisibly control mass-thought. Theodor\r\nHerzl, the arch-Jew, a man whose vision was wider than any statesman's\r\nand whose program paralleled the Protocols, knew this many years ago\r\nwhen he said that the Zionist (cryptic for \"Jewish\") state would come\r\nbefore the Socialist state could come; he knew with what endless\r\ndivisions the \"liberalism\" which he and his predecessors had planted\r\nwould be shackled and crippled.\r\n\r\nThe process of which all Gentiles have been the victims, but never the\r\nJews--never the Jews!--is just this--\r\n\r\nFirst, to create an ideal of \"broad-mindedness.\" That is the phrase\r\nwhich appears in every Jewish remonstrance against public mention of the\r\nJew and his alleged World Program: \"We thought you were too broad-minded\r\na man to express such thoughts;\" \"we thought Mr. So-and-So was too\r\nbroad-minded a man to suspect the Jews of this;\" \"we thought the daily\r\nor weekly or monthly such-and-such a paper was too broad-minded\r\neditorially to consider such material.\" It is a sort of keyword,\r\nindicative of the state of mind in which it is desired that the Gentles\r\nbe kept. It is a state of flabby tolerance. A state of mind which mouths\r\nmeaningless phrases about Liberty, phrases which act as an opiate on the\r\nmind and conscience and which allow all sorts of things to be done under\r\ncover. The phrase, the slogan, is a very dependable Jewish weapon. (\"In\r\nall times people have accepted words for acts.\"--Protocol 5.) The\r\nreality behind the phrase the Protocols frankly admit to be\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\nNothing has served to create \"broad-mindedness,\" a state of mind whose\r\nbreadth indicates its lack of depth, so much as the ideas of liberalism\r\nwhich the Jews are constantly teaching to Gentiles and on which they\r\nnever themselves act. We need a new sort of allegiance to the reality of\r\nlife, to the facts as they are, which will enable us to stand up under\r\nall cajoling to \"broad-mindness\" and assert a new intolerance of\r\neverything but truth. The terms \"narrow\" and \"broad\" as they are used\r\ntoday represent lies. The liberal man ought to believe more, he ought to\r\nbe deep and wide in his beliefs in order to merit that name; but as a\r\nusual thing he believes nothing. He is not liberal at all. When you seek\r\nbelief, belief with a foundation, belief with vitality, you must seek it\r\namong men who are sneered at, under this false Jewish-propagated notion\r\nof liberality, as \"narrow men.\" Jewish propaganda, in common with the\r\nProtocols, is against men who have dug down to the rock; they want\r\n\"broad-minded men\" who can easily be shifted about the surface and thus\r\nserve the invisible scheme in any manner desired. This type of men, on\r\ntheir part, never imagine but that their \"broad-mindedness\" is a mark of\r\ntheir superiority and independence.\r\n\r\nNow, see what follows. Men are born believers. For a time they may\r\nbelieve in \"broad-mindedness\" and under the terrific social pressure\r\nthat has been set up in its favor they will openly espouse it. But it is\r\ntoo shallow to satisfy any growing roots of life. They must believe,\r\ndeeply, something. For proof of this, notice the undeniable strength of\r\nthe negative beliefs which are held by men who fancy that they believe\r\nnothing. Therefore, some who are highly endowed with independence of\r\nspirit, root down into those prohibited matters which at some point\r\ntouch Jewish concerns--these are the \"narrow\" men. But others find it\r\nmore convenient to cultivate those departments which promise a highway\r\nwhereon there shall be no clashes of vital opinion, no chance of the\r\ncharge of \"intolerance\"; in short they transfer all their contemplative\r\npowers to the active life, even as it is written in the Protocols--\r\n\r\n\"To divert Gentile thought and observation, interest must be deflected\r\nto industry and commerce.\"\r\n\r\nIt is amazing to look around and see the number of men who have been\r\nactually browbeaten into committing their whole lives to these secondary\r\nor even tertiary things, while they look with great timidity and\r\naversion at the vital things which really rule the world and upon the\r\nissue of which the world really depends.\r\n\r\nBut it is just this deflection to the materialistic base that offers the\r\nProtocolists, and similarly Jewish propagandists, their best hold.\r\n\"Broad-mindedness\" today consists in leaving vital matters severely\r\nalone. It descends quickly to material-mindedness. Within this lower\r\nsphere all the discord which distresses the world today is to be found.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the ruin of the upper circles of industry and commerce:\r\n\r\n\"To make it possible for liberty definitely to disintegrate and ruin\r\nGentile society, industry must be placed on a speculative basis.\"\r\n\r\nNo one needs to be told what this means. It means, as everything about\r\nus shouts, the prostitution of service to profits and the eventual\r\ndisappearance of the profits. It means that the high art of management\r\ndegenerates into exploitation. It means reckless confusion among the\r\nmanagers and dangerous unrest among the workmen.\r\n\r\nBut it means something worse; it means the splitting up of Gentile\r\nsociety. Not a division between \"Capital\" and \"Labor,\" but the division\r\nbetween the Gentiles at both ends of the working scheme. Gentile\r\nmanagers and manufacturers are not the \"capitalists\" of the United\r\nStates. Most of them have to go to the \"capitalists\" for the funds with\r\nwhich they work--and the \"capitalists\" are Jewish, International Jews.\r\n\r\nBut with Jewish capital at one end of the Gentile working scheme putting\r\nthe screws on the manufacturers, and with Jewish agitators and\r\ndisruptionists and subversives at the other end of the Gentile working\r\nscheme putting the screws on the workmen, we have a condition at which\r\nthe world-managers of the Protocol program must be immensely satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"We might fear the combined strength of the Gentiles of vision with the\r\nblind strength of the masses, but we have taken all measures against\r\nsuch a possible contingency by raising a wall of mutual antagonism\r\nbetween these two forces. Thus, the blind force of the masses remains\r\nour support. We, and we alone, shall serve as their leaders. Naturally,\r\nwe will direct their energy to achieve our end.\"--Protocol 9.\r\n\r\nThe indication that they are highly satisfied is that they are not only\r\nnot doing anything to relieve the situation, but are apparently willing\r\nto have it made worse, and if it be at all possible for them to do so\r\nthey would like to see this coming winter, and the privations which are\r\nscheduled for it (unless Gentile flabbiness before the Jewish power,\r\nhigh and low, receives a new backbone), bring the United States to the\r\nverge of, if not across the very line of Bolshevism. They know the whole\r\nmethod of artificial scarcity and high prices. It was practiced in the\r\nFrench Revolution and in Russia. All the signs of it are in this country\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nIndustrial problems for their mental food and light amusement for their\r\nleisure hours, these are the Protocols' method with regard to the\r\nGentile mind, and under cover of these the work is to be done--the work\r\nwhich is best expressed by the motto, \"Divide and Rule.\"\r\n\r\nRead this:\r\n\r\n\"To divert over-restless people from discussing political questions, we\r\nshall now bring forward new problems apparently connected with\r\nthem--problems of industry.\"--Protocol 13.\r\n\r\nHas not everyone been struck by the divorcement which exists in this\r\ncountry between the mass-thought which is almost exclusively devoted to\r\nindustrial questions, and the party-thought which is endeavoring to keep\r\nthe field of pure politics? And is it not a fact that our friends, the\r\nJews, are strongly entrenched in both fields--in politics to keep it\r\nreactionary, and in industrial circles to keep it radical--and so widen\r\nthe split? And what is this split but a split of the Gentiles?--for\r\nsociety is Gentile, and the disruptive influences are Jewish.\r\n\r\nRead this:\r\n\r\n\"We have included in the constitution rights for the people that are\r\nfictitious and not actual rights. All those so-called 'rights of the\r\npeople' can only exist in the abstract and can never be realized in\r\npractice * * * The proletarian gains no more from the constitution than\r\nthe miserable crumbs thrown from our table in return for his votes to\r\nelect our agents and pass our measures. Republican rights are a bitter\r\nirony to the poor man, for the pressure of daily labor prevents him from\r\nusing them, and at the same time, deprives him of the guaranty of a\r\npermanent and certain livelihood by making him dependent upon strikes,\r\norganized either by his employers or his comrades.\"--Protocol 3.\r\n\r\nThis remark about strikes is not at all puzzling to anyone who has\r\nstudied the different types of strikes in this country. The number\r\nfomented from above the working class is astoundingly large.\r\n\r\nRead this also:\r\n\r\n\"We will force up wages, which, however, will be of no benefit to the\r\nworkers, for we will at the same time cause a rise in the prices of\r\nnecessities, pretending that this is due to the decline of agriculture\r\nand of cattle raising. We will also artfully and deeply undermine the\r\nsources of production by instilling in the workmen ideas of\r\nanarchy.\"--Protocol 6.\r\n\r\nAnd this:\r\n\r\n\"We will represent ourselves as the saviours of the working class who\r\nhave come to liberate them from this oppression by suggesting that they\r\njoin our army of socialists, anarchists, communists, to whom we always\r\nextend our help under the guise of the fraternal principles of universal\r\nhuman solidarity.\"--Protocol 3.\r\n\r\n\"Broad-mindedness\" again! In this connection it is always well to\r\nremember the words of Sir Eustace Percy, heretofore quoted, words which\r\nare sponsored by Jews themselves--\"Not because the Jew cares for the\r\npositive side of radical philosophy, not because he desires to be a\r\npartaker in Gentile nationalism or Gentile democracy, but because no\r\nexisting Gentile system of government is ever anything but distasteful\r\nto him.\"\r\n\r\nOr, as the author of \"The Conquering Jew\" says: \"He is democratic in his\r\nsentiments, but not in his nature. When he proclaims the common\r\nbrotherhood of man, he is asking that the social gate now closed against\r\nhim in so many quarters shall be open to him; not because he wants\r\nequality, but because he desires to be master in the social world, as he\r\nis showing himself in so may other spheres. Many an honorable Jew will,\r\nI doubt not, dispute the accuracy of this distinction; but if he does it\r\nwill be because he has lived so long in the atmosphere of the West that\r\nhe is unconscious of what is bred in the bone of his Eastern race.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult, therefore, to see the genealogy of the Jewish ideas\r\nof liberalism from their origin to their latest effects upon Gentile\r\nlife. The confusion aimed for is here. There is not a reader of these\r\nlines who has not felt in his own life the burden of it. Bewilderment\r\ncharacterizes the whole mental climate of the people today. They do not\r\nknow what to believe. First one set of facts is given to them, then\r\nanother. First one explanation of conditions is given to them, and then\r\nanother. The fact-shortage is acute. There is a whole market-full of\r\nexplanations that explain nothing, but only deepen the confusion. The\r\ngovernment itself seems to be hampered, and whenever it starts on a line\r\nof investigation finds itself mysteriously tangled up so that procedure\r\nis difficult. This governmental aspect is also set forth in the\r\nProtocols.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the onslaught on the human tendency toward religion, which\r\nis usually the last barrier to fall before violence and robbery\r\nunashamed stalk forth. In order to bring the condition about at which\r\nthis World Program aims, the Fourth Protocol says:\r\n\r\n\"It is for this reason that we must undermine faith, eradicate from the\r\nminds of the Gentiles the very principles of God and Soul, and replace\r\nthese conceptions by mathematical calculations and material desires.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we deprived the masses of their belief in God, ruling authority\r\nwas thrown into the gutter, where it became public property, and we\r\nseized it.\"--Protocol 5.\r\n\r\n\"We have taken good care long ago to discredit the Gentile\r\nclergy.\"--Protocol 17.\r\n\r\n\"When we become rulers we shall regard as undesirable the existence of\r\nany religion except our own, proclaiming One God with Whom our fate is\r\ntied as The Chosen People, and by Whom our fate has been made one with\r\nthe fate of the world. For this reason we must destroy all other\r\nreligions. If thereby should emerge contemporary atheists, then, as a\r\ntransition step, this will not interfere with our aims.\"--Protocol 14.\r\n\r\nThis will probably offer matter for reflection by the \"broad-minded.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how this religious program has worked out in\r\nRussia where Trotsky (as loudly heralded in the American Jewish Press)\r\nis said to have no religion, and where Jewish commissars tell dying\r\nRussians who ask for priests, \"We have abolished the Almighty.\" Miss\r\nKatherine Dokoochief is reported, under a Philadelphia date, to have\r\ntold the Near East Relief that Russian Christian churches have been\r\nsubjected to the vilest indignities by the Bolsheviki, details of which\r\nshe gives; but \"the synagogues remain untouched, meeting with no\r\ndamage.\"\r\n\r\nAll these lines of attack, whose object is the destruction of the\r\nnatural rallying points of Gentile thought, and the substitution of\r\nother rallying points of an unwholesome and destructive nature, are\r\nassisted, as we saw in the last article, by the propaganda for luxury.\r\nLuxury is recognizedly one of the most enervating influences. Its course\r\nruns from ease, through softness, to flabbiness, to degeneracy, mental,\r\nphysical and moral. Its beginnings are attractive, its end is\r\nlasciviousness in some form, testifying to the complete breakdown of all\r\nthe strong fiber of the life. It may make a theme for a more complete\r\nstudy some day, this lure to lasciviousness through luxury, and the\r\nidentity of the forces that set the lure.\r\n\r\nBut now, to conclude this general view of the method, rather this part\r\nof the method, the confusion itself, which all these influences converge\r\nto produce, is expected to produce another more deeply helpless state.\r\nAnd that state is, Exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIt needs no imagination to see what this means. Exhaustion is today one\r\nof the conditions that menace the people. The recent political\r\nconventions and their effect upon the public fully illustrate it. Nobody\r\nseemed to care. Parties might make their declarations and candidates\r\ntheir promises--nobody cared. The war and its strain began the\r\nexhaustion; the \"peace\" and its confusion have about completed it. The\r\npeople believe little and expect less. Confidence is gone. Initiative is\r\nnearly gone. The failure of movements falsely heralded as \"people's\r\nmovements\" has gone far to make the people think that no people's\r\nmovement is possible.\r\n\r\nSo say the Protocols:\r\n\r\n\"To wear everyone out by dissensions, animosities, feuds, famine,\r\ninoculation of diseases, want, until the Gentiles see no other way of\r\nescape except an appeal to our money and power.\"--Protocol 10.\r\n\r\n\"We will so wear out and exhaust the Gentiles by all this that they will\r\nbe compelled to offer us an international authority, which by its\r\nposition will enable us to absorb without disturbance all the\r\ngovernmental forces of the world and thus form a super-government.\r\n\r\n\"We must so direct the education of Gentile society that its hands will\r\ndrop in the weakness of discouragement in the face of any undertaking\r\nwhere initiative is needed.\"--Protocol 5.\r\n\r\nThe Jews have never been worn out or exhausted. They have never been\r\nnonplused. This is the true psychic characteristic of those who have a\r\nclue to the maze. It is the unknown that exhausts the mind, the constant\r\nwandering around among tendencies and influences whose source is not\r\nknown and whose purpose is not understood. Walking in the dark is\r\nwearing work. The Gentiles have been doing it for centuries. The others,\r\nhaving a pretty accurate idea what it was all about, have not succumbed.\r\nEven persecution is endurable if it is understandable, and the Jews of\r\nthe world have always known just where it fitted in the scheme of\r\nthings. Gentiles have suffered from Jewish persecutions than have the\r\nJews, for after the persecutions were over, the Gentile was as much in\r\nthe dark as ever; whereas Judaism simply took up again its century-long\r\nmarch toward a goal in which it implicitly believes, and which, some say\r\nwho have deep knowledge of Jewish roots in the world and who too may be\r\ntouched with exhaustion, they will achieve. However this may be, the\r\nrevolution which would be necessary to unfasten the International Jewish\r\nsystem from its grip on the world, would probably have to be just as\r\nradical as any attempts the Jews have made to attain that grip. There\r\nare those who express serious doubts that the Gentiles are competent to\r\ndo it at all. Maybe not. Let them at least know who their conquerors\r\nare.\r\n\r\n[Issue of August 14, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nDid the Jews Foresee the World War?\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a more detailed study of the connection between the\r\nwritten program of the documents which are called \"The Protocols of the\r\nLearned Elders of Zion,\" and the actual program as it can be traced in\r\nreal life, we shall now view those plans which were future when the\r\nProtocols were uttered. It must be borne in mind, however, that what was\r\nfuture in 1896 and 1905, may be past today, that what was plan then may\r\nbe fulfillment now. To bear this in mind will be in exact accord with\r\nthe expression of Protocol 22--\"I have endeavored to indicate carefully\r\nthe secrets of past and future events, and of those momentous\r\noccurrences of the near future toward which we are rushing in a stream\r\nof great crises.\" Some of those \"momentous occurrences\" have come to\r\npass, and with them a brighter light on the Question which we are\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of this which is fresh in the minds of all was furnished\r\nby the Great War. Jewish comment on this series of articles has made\r\nmuch of the fact that one of the articles was devoted to the then\r\nprominence of the Jewish Question in Germany, and it was sought to\r\nmislead the people to think that this series was really a part of subtle\r\nGerman after-the-war propaganda. The fact is that articles on the\r\nQuestion in a number of countries were set aside in order to bring the\r\nQuestion itself prominently before the minds of Americans with the least\r\ndelay. The postponed articles will appear in due season, though out of\r\ntheir order. Germany is today, with perhaps the possible exception of\r\nthe United States, the most Jew-controlled country in the\r\nworld--controlled within and from without--and a much stronger set of\r\nfacts could be presented now than was presented in the original article\r\n(the facts of which were at first denied and later admitted by the\r\nJewish spokesmen in the United States). For, since that article was\r\nwritten, public sentiment in Germany has swept the Jews largely out of\r\npublic office. German public opinion exerted itself to the utmost to put\r\nGerman political administration back into German hands. But did that\r\nliberate Germany from the Jews? Not at all. For their entrenchments\r\nstretched further and deeper than mere display of official power. Their\r\nhold on the basic industries, the finances, the future of Germany has\r\nnot been loosened in the least. It is there, unmovable. In what that\r\nhold consists, the reader will be told at some convenient time.\r\n\r\nGermany is mentioned now, in connection with the Jews, for this purpose:\r\nIt will be remembered that it was from Germany that the first cry of\r\n\"annexations\" came, and it came at a time when all German war activities\r\nand war sentiment were admittedly in Jewish control. \"Annexations\" was\r\nthe cry that flashed across the world one day. And back across the\r\nworld, from the United States, a nation that was not even a party to the\r\nwar at that time, the word flashed back, \"No Annexations.\" Thus by a\r\ndramatic play the whole question was thrust before the world.\r\n\r\nSoon the people of all countries had forgotten the blood of battle, the\r\nwar profiteers and every other vital point, and were discussing a matter\r\nwhich belonged to the end of the war and not the beginning, the question\r\nof \"annexations.\" Now, when it is known who were controlling the\r\nformulation of war-aims in Germany and who were the chief counselors of\r\nthe foreign policy of the United States at the same time, the projection\r\nof this question of \"annexations\" into the world's mind becomes\r\ninteresting; interesting but not wholly intelligible.\r\n\r\nNot until you read the Protocols do you get a full light on this--and\r\nthis report of the Protocols which is now given the world probably dates\r\nfrom 1896; there is absolutely ironclad proof of the date 1905.\r\n\r\nThe Second Protocol begins on the note of war, and its opening words are\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n\"It is indispensable for our purpose that as far as possible, wars\r\nshould bring no territorial advantages. This will shift war to an\r\neconomic footing, and nations will perceive the strength of our\r\nsuperiority in the aid we render.\"\r\n\r\nWho was thinking, between 1896 and 1905, of the new \"no annexations\"\r\nrule to be applied to war? Were you? Do you know of any statesman who\r\nwas? We know that military men were concerned about the appliances and\r\noperations of any future war that might occur. We know that statesmen,\r\nof the more responsible sort, were working to consolidate a balance of\r\ninterests that would make war extremely improbable. Who had outdistanced\r\nthem all in foresight and planning sufficiently to lay down a definite\r\nprogram of \"no annexations?\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the clue to the answer is supplied to us by unquestionable\r\nJewish sources. The American Jewish News of September 19, 1919, had an\r\nadvertisement on its front page which read thus:\r\n\r\n\"WHEN PROPHETS SPEAK\r\n\r\nBy Litman Rosenthal\r\n\r\nMany years ago Nordau prophesied the Balfour Declaration. Litman\r\nRosenthal, his intimate friend, relates this incident in a fascinating\r\nmemoir.\r\n\r\nThe article, on page 464, begins: \"It was on Saturday, the day after the\r\nclosing of the Sixth Congress, when I received a telephone message from\r\nDr. Herzl asking me to call on him.\"\r\n\r\nThis fixes the time. The Sixth Zionist Congress was held at Basle in\r\nAugust, 1903.\r\n\r\nThe memoir continues: \"On entering the lobby of the hotel I met Herzl's\r\nmother who welcomed me with her usual gracious friendliness and asked me\r\nwhether the feelings of the Russian Zionists were now calmer.\r\n\r\n\"'Why just the Russian Zionists, Frau Herzl?' I asked. 'Why do you only\r\ninquire about these?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because my son,' she explained, 'is mostly interested in the Russian\r\nZionists. He considers them the quintessence, the most vital part of the\r\nJewish people.'\"\r\n\r\nAt this Sixth Congress the British Government (\"Herzl and his agents had\r\nkept in contact with the English Government\"--Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol.\r\n12, page 678) had offered the Jews a colony in Uganda, East Africa.\r\nHerzl was in favor of taking it, not as a substitute for Palestine, but\r\nas a step toward it. It was this which formed the chief topic of\r\nconversation between Herzl and Litman Rosenthal in that Basle hotel.\r\nHerzl said to Rosenthal, as reported in this article: \"There is a\r\ndifference between the final aim and the ways we have to go to achieve\r\nthis aim.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Max Nordau, who seems at the conference held last month in\r\nLondon to have become Herzl's successor, entered the room, and the\r\nRosenthal interview was ended.\r\n\r\nLet the reader now follow attentively the important part of this\r\nRosenthal story:--(the italics are ours)\r\n\r\n\"About a month later I went on a business trip to France. On my way to\r\nLyons I stopped in Paris, and there I visited, as usual, our Zionist\r\nfriends. One of them told me that this very same evening Dr. Nordau was\r\nscheduled to speak about the Sixth Congress, and I, naturally,\r\ninterrupted my journey to be present at this meeting and to hear Dr.\r\nNordau's report. When we reached the hall in the evening we found it\r\nfilled to overflowing and all were waiting impatiently for the great\r\nmaster, Nordau, who, on entering, received a tremendous ovation. But\r\nNordau, without paying heed to the applause showered upon him, began his\r\nspeech immediately, and said:\r\n\r\n\"'You all came here with a question burning in your hearts and trembling\r\non your lips, and the question is, indeed, a great one, and of vital\r\nimportance. I am willing to answer it. What you want to ask is: How\r\ncould I--I who was one of those who formulated the Basle program--how\r\ncould I dare to speak in favor of the English proposition concerning\r\nUganda, how could Herzl as well as I betray our ideal of Palestine,\r\nbecause you surely think that we have betrayed it and forgotten it. Yet\r\nlisten to what I have to say to you. I spoke in favor of Uganda after\r\nlong and careful consideration; deliberately I advised the Congress to\r\nconsider and to accept the proposal of the English Government, a\r\nproposal made to the Jewish nation through the Zionist Congress, and my\r\nreasons--but instead of my reasons let me tell you a political story as\r\na kind of allegory.\r\n\r\n\"'I want to speak of a time which is now almost forgotten, a time when\r\nthe European powers had decided to send a fleet against the fortress of\r\nSebastopol. At this time Italy, the United Kingdom of Italy, did not\r\nexist. Italy was in reality only a little principality of Sardinia, and\r\nthe great, free and united Italy was but a dream, a fervent wish, a far\r\nideal of all Italian patriots. The leaders of Sardinia, who were\r\nfighting for and planning this free and united Italy, were the three\r\ngreat popular heroes: Garibaldi, Mazzini, and Cavour.\r\n\r\n\"'The European powers invited Sardinia to join in the demonstration at\r\nSebastopol and to send also a fleet to help in the siege of this\r\nfortress, and this proposal gave rise to a dissension among the leaders\r\nof Sardinia. Garibaldi and Mazzini did not want to send a fleet to the\r\nhelp of England and France and they said: \"Our program, the work to\r\nwhich we are pledged, is a free and united Italy. What have we to do\r\nwith Sebastopol? Sebastopol is nothing to us, and we should concentrate\r\nall our energies on our original program so that we may realize our\r\nideal as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"'But Cavour, who even at this time was the most prominent, the most\r\nable, and the most far-sighted statesman of Sardinia, insisted that his\r\ncountry should send a fleet and beleaguer with the other powers\r\nSebastopol, and, at last, he carried his point. Perhaps it will interest\r\nyou to know that the right hand of Cavour, his friend and adviser, was\r\nhis secretary, Hartum, a Jew, and in those circles, which were in\r\nopposition to the government, one spoke fulminantly of Jewish treason.\r\nAnd once at an assembly of Italian patriots one called wildly for\r\nCavour's secretary, Hartum, and demanded of him to defend his dangerous\r\nand treasonable political actions. And this is what he said: \"Our dream,\r\nour fight, our ideal, an ideal for which we have paid already in blood\r\nand tears, in sorrow and despair, with the life of our sons and the\r\nanguish of our mothers, our one wish and one aim is a free and united\r\nItaly. All means are sacred if they lead to this great and glorious\r\ngoal. Cavour knows full well that after the fight before Sebastopol\r\nsooner or later a peace conference will have to be held, and at this\r\npeace conference those powers will participate who have joined in the\r\nfight. True, Sardinia has no immediate concern, no direct interest in\r\nSebastopol, but if we will help now with our fleet, we will sit at the\r\nfuture peace conference, enjoying equal rights with the other powers,\r\nand at this peace conference Cavour, as the representative of Sardinia,\r\nwill proclaim the free and independent, united Italy. Thus our dream for\r\nwhich we have suffered and died, will become, at last, a wonderful and\r\nhappy reality. And if you now ask me again, what has Sardinia to do at\r\nSebastopol, then let me tell you the following words, like the steps of\r\na ladder: Cavour, Sardinia, the siege of Sebastopol, the future European\r\npeace conference, the proclamation of a free and united Italy.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole assembly was under the spell of Nordau's beautiful, truly\r\npoetic and exalted diction, and his exquisite, musical French delighted\r\nthe hearers with an almost sensual pleasure. For a few seconds the\r\nspeaker paused, and the public, absolutely intoxicated by his splendid\r\noratory, applauded frantically. But soon Nordau asked for silence and\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"'Now this great progressive world power, England, has after the pogroms\r\nof Kishineff, in token of her sympathy with our poor people, offered\r\nthrough the Zionist Congress the autonomous colony of Uganda to the\r\nJewish nation. Of course, Uganda is in Africa, and Africa is not Zion\r\nand never will be Zion, to quote Herzl's own words. But Herzl knows full\r\nwell that nothing is so valuable to the cause of Zionism as amicable\r\npolitical relations with such a power as England is, and so much more\r\nvaluable as England's main interest is concentrated in the Orient.\r\nNowhere else is precedent as powerful as in England, and so it is most\r\nimportant to accept a colony out of the hands of England and create thus\r\na precedent in our favor. Sooner or later the Oriental question will\r\nhave to be solved, and the Oriental question means, naturally, also the\r\nquestion of Palestine. England, who had addressed a formal, political\r\nnote to the Zionist Congress--the Zionist Congress which is pledged to\r\nthe Basle program, England will have the deciding voice in the final\r\nsolution of the Oriental question, and Herzl has considered it his duty\r\nto maintain valuable relations with this great and progressive power.\r\nHerzl knows that we stand before a tremendous upheaval of the whole\r\nworld. Soon, perhaps, some kind of a world-congress will have to be\r\ncalled, and England, the great, free and powerful England, will then\r\ncontinue the work it has begun with its generous offer to the Sixth\r\nCongress. And if you ask me now what has Israel to do in Uganda, then\r\nlet me tell you as the answer the words of the statesmen of Sardinia,\r\nonly applied to our case and given in our version; let me tell you the\r\nfollowing words as if I were showing you the rungs of a ladder leading\r\nupward and upward: Herzl, The Zionist Congress, the English Uganda\r\nproposition, the future world war, the peace conference where with the\r\nhelp of England a free and Jewish Palestine will be created.'\r\n\r\n\"Like a mighty thunder these last words came to us, and we all were\r\ntrembling and awestruck as if we had seen a vision of old. And in my\r\nears were sounding the words of our great brother Achad Haam, who said\r\nof Nordau's address at the First Congress:\r\n\r\n\"'I felt that one of the great old prophets was speaking to us, that his\r\nvoice came down from the free hills of Judea, and our hearts were\r\nburning in us when we heard his words, filled with wonder, wisdom and\r\nvision.'\"\r\n\r\nThe amazing thing is that this article by Litman Rosenthal should ever\r\nhave been permitted to see print. But it did not see print until the\r\nBalfour Declaration about Palestine, and it never would have seen print\r\nhad not the Jews believed that one part of their program had been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Jew never betrays himself until he believes that what he seeks has\r\nbeen won, then he lets himself go. It was only to Jews that the 1903\r\n\"program of the Ladder\"--the future world war--the peace conference--the\r\nJewish program--was communicated. When the ascent of that ladder seemed\r\nto be complete, then came the public talk.\r\n\r\nA similar illustration of this is to be found in the fall of the Czar.\r\nWhen that event transpired it was an occasion of great rejoicing in New\r\nYork, and a Gentile of world-wide fame made a speech in which he lauded\r\nan American Jew of national reputation for having begun the downfall of\r\nthe Czar by providing the money with which propaganda had been made\r\namong Russian prisoners in Japan during the Russo-Japanese war. The\r\nstory came out only after the success of the plot. It is not at all out\r\nof keeping that the last men to see the last act of the plot carried\r\nout, the actual murder of Nicholas Romanovitch, his wife, his young\r\ndaughters and his invalid boy, were \"five Soviet deputies, the latter\r\nfive all Jews.\" What began with the assistance of an American financier,\r\nfinished with Soviet deputies.\r\n\r\nDid International Jews in 1903 foresee the war? This Rosenthal\r\nconfession is but one bit of evidence that they did. And did they do\r\nnothing but foresee it? It were well if the facts stopped at foresight\r\nand did not run on to provocation.\r\n\r\nFor the present the reader is invited to retain in his mind two points\r\nin this Rosenthal article: \"Perhaps it will interest you to know that\r\nthe right hand of Cavour, his friend and adviser, was his secretary,\r\nHartum, a Jew.\" This is the way the Jewish press speaks of its own. If\r\nthis paper, or a Chicago paper, or a New York paper should go through\r\nthe list of the secretaries of the men of power in the world today and\r\nmake the note after the names--\"His secretary, a Jew,\" the\r\nAnti-Defamation Society would send letters of protest. There is one rule\r\nfor the Gentile and one for the Jew, in the Jewish mind. Writing in the\r\npublic prints about Hartum, he would be described as an \"Italian.\"\r\n\r\nWere the Jewish secretaries who abounded before the war, during the war\r\nand throughout the Peace Conference of less brilliance than Hartum? Were\r\nthere not Hartums in England, France, Germany, yes and in Russia too (in\r\nthe United States there were many) who saw the \"program of the Ladder\"?\r\nDid Max Nordau who saw it so clearly in 1903 forget it in 1914 and 1918?\r\n\r\nWe know this: the Jews in their Congress at Basle in 1903 foresaw \"the\r\nfuture world war.\" How did they know it was to be a \"world war\"?\r\n\r\nWe know this also: the Protocols, perhaps as early as 1896, certainly\r\nnot later than 1905, foresaw the policy of \"no annexations.\"\r\n\r\nThe World War came to pass.\r\n\r\n\"No annexations\" came to pass. What was then future in the Jewish world\r\nprogram, is now past.\r\n\r\nIn the Protocols there are two forms of declaration. One is, \"we have.\"\r\nThe other is, \"we shall.\" If somewhere in the world this summer the high\r\nsecret spokesman of the World Program is addressing his class of\r\nInternational Initiates, he will have to say \"we have\" in many places\r\nwhere this spokesman of 1896 said \"we shall.\" Things have been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\"We will represent ourselves as the saviors of the laboring classes.\"\r\nThat has been and is being done. \"We will deflect the thoughts of the\r\nGentiles to industry and commerce.\" That has been done. \"We will create\r\na strongly centralized administration so as to grasp all the social\r\nforces strongly in our hands.\" That has been done. \"We will adopt for\r\nourselves the liberal side of all parties and all movements and provide\r\norators.\" That has been done. \"We will force up wages.\" That has been\r\ndone. \"We will at the same time cause a rise in the price of prime\r\nnecessities.\" That has been done. \"We will also undermine the sources of\r\nproduction by instilling in the workmen ideas of anarchy.\" That has been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"To demonstrate our enslavement of the Gentile governments of Europe, we\r\nshall show our power to one by crimes of violence, that is, by a reign\r\nof terror.\"--Protocol 7.\r\n\r\nWho that sees Russia and beholds the attitude of the premiers of\r\nEngland, France, and Italy toward the Soviets, the \"enslavement\" of\r\nstatesmanship by a condition that tangles more gnarledly the more it is\r\ndealt with--who that sees the prostration of Europe before a wound that\r\nis deliberately kept from healing, can forbear to say: That too has been\r\ndone!\r\n\r\n\"Our plans will not upset contemporary institutions immediately. Their\r\nmanagement will only be altered and consequently the whole procedure of\r\ntheir activity will thus be directed according to plans laid down by\r\nus.\" That has been done.\r\n\r\n\"We shall saddle the press and keep a tight reign upon it.\" That has\r\nbeen done. The rein is being strongly pulled in the United States at\r\nthis moment, as many an editor can testify.\r\n\r\n\"Even if there should be those who desire to write against us, no one\r\nwill print their writings.\" In large part, that has been done. It has\r\nbeen done completely with the profit-making press.\r\n\r\n\"We shall, as an incentive to speculation, encourage among the Gentiles\r\na strong demand for luxuries--all-enticing luxuries.\" That has been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"To each act of opposition we must be in a position to respond by\r\nbringing on war through the neighbors of any country that dares to\r\noppose us, and if these neighbors should plan to stand collectively\r\nagainst us, we must let loose a world war.\" (Protocol 7). The term\r\n\"world war\" is the same as that used by Rosenthal and Nordau. \"Herzl\r\nknows,\" said Nordau in 1903, \"that we stand before a tremendous upheaval\r\nof the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must create unrest, dissension and mutual animosities throughout\r\nEurope and, with the help of her relationships, on other continents.\"\r\nThis has been done. This passage continues: \"There is a double advantage\r\nin this. First, we shall command the respect of all countries by this\r\nmethod, for they will realize that we have the power to create disorder\r\nor establish order at will.\" This too has been done.\r\n\r\nTruly did the spokesman of 1896 speak of \"those momentous occurrences of\r\nthe near future toward which we are rushing in a stream of great\r\ncrises.\"\r\n\r\nNot only was \"no annexations\" achieved \"as far as possible,\" just as the\r\nProtocols outlined it, but a host of other plans have matured in\r\nachievement along with it. \"No annexations\" as a matter of political\r\nmorality is one thing; and \"no annexations\" for the reason that \"this\r\nwill shift war to an economic footing and nations will perceive the\r\nstrength of our superiority in the aid we render\" is quite another\r\nthing. The world was with the \"no annexations\" program as a matter of\r\npolitical morality; the other program, which used this morality as its\r\nvehicle, was hidden.\r\n\r\nThere are still other matters in this group which must receive\r\nattention, but another article will be necessary to do it. In the\r\nmeantime, it is natural to wonder whether, with the program as outlined\r\nin this report of the Protocols having received fulfillment in so many\r\nparticulars, a new Protocol, or a further unfolding of the Ladder has\r\nbeen made by the Wise Men to their Initiates; and whether any additional\r\nunveiling will ever come to the knowledge of the world. It would seem\r\nthat a proper estimate of the knowledge now available would lead to such\r\nan awakening as to nullify the present program and make all future ones\r\nimpossible. But Gentiles like their ease, and Judah is beckoned on by a\r\nbright star.\r\n\r\n[Issue of August 21, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nIs the Jewish \"Kahal\" the Modern \"Soviet\"?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Soviet is not a Russian but a Jewish institution. Nor is it the\r\ninvention of Russian Jews of the present time, a new political device\r\nwhich has been set up as a vehicle of the ideas of Lenin and Trotsky; it\r\nis of ancient Jewish origin, a device which the Jews themselves invented\r\nto maintain their distinctive racial and national life after the\r\nconquest of Palestine by the Romans.\r\n\r\nModern Bolshevism, which is now known to be merely the outer cloak of a\r\nlong-planned coup to establish the domination of a race, immediately set\r\nup the Soviet form of government because the Jews of all countries who\r\ncontributed to Russian Bolshevism had long been schooled in the nature\r\nand structure of the Soviet.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet appears in the \"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\"\r\nunder the ancient name of KAHAL. In the Seventeenth Protocol this\r\npassage occurs:\r\n\r\n\"Even now our brothers are under obligation to denounce apostates of\r\ntheir own family or any person known to be opposed to the Kahal. When\r\nour kingdom comes, it will be necessary for all subjects to serve the\r\nstate in a similar manner.\"\r\n\r\nAnyone who is acquainted with contemporary Jewish life knows what this\r\ndenunciation of apostates means. The bitterness of the persecution which\r\nfalls upon a convert to Christianity or upon the Jewish son or daughter\r\nof an orthodox family who chooses to marry a Gentile, is without\r\nparallel among men. Very recently in a western state a fine Jewish girl\r\nchose to marry a Gentile, who was a newspaperman. From the time of her\r\nannouncement of intention, the girl was treated as an apostate. Had she\r\ndied a most wretched death, had she descended to a status of most\r\nignominious shame, the feelings which her fate would have aroused could\r\nnot have been more terrible. A darkly solemn funeral service was held\r\nfor her, and on her bridal day she was declared to be dead to her\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe case is very far from being unusual. Perhaps one of the most moving\r\ndescriptions of it is to be found in the life of Spinoza, the great\r\nphilosopher whom modern Jews are fond of holding up for exhibition as a\r\ngreat ornament of their people. Spinoza's studies led him to question\r\nmany of the dogmas the rabbis taught, those \"commandments of men\" of\r\nwhich the New Testament speaks, and as Spinoza was already a person of\r\ninfluence the very common Jewish tactic of bribery was tried upon him.\r\n\r\nThere would be some hesitation in using the words just set down--\"the\r\nvery common Jewish tactic of bribery\"--if they were not known to be\r\ntrue. There is no desire to cast aspersions which grow out of malice.\r\nBut Jewish history as written by Jews provides mountains of proof that\r\nbribery was, while present knowledge amply testifies that it still is,\r\nthe favorite and most dependable weapon of the Jews. A Jewish writer,\r\nJacob Israel De Haan, a Dutch lawyer resident in Jerusalem, has recently\r\nstated that one hope of a settlement of the Arab agitation in Palestine\r\nis the ease with which the Arab press can be bribed. His words are:\r\n\"There is a strong agitation here among the Arabs against what they call\r\nthe Zionist peril. But the Arabs, especially the Arabian papers, are\r\nopen to bribe. This weakness will cause them, in the long run, to lose\r\nout against us.\"\r\n\r\nSo, young Spinoza was offered an annual stipend of 1,000 florins if he\r\nwould be silent upon his convictions and from time to time show himself\r\nat the synagogue. This he refused with high-minded scorn. He made ready\r\nto earn his bread by polishing lenses for optical instruments. Upon\r\nthis, he was excommunicated, a proceeding which is thus described:\r\n\r\n\"The day of excommunication at length arrived, and a vast concourse\r\nassembled to witness the awful ceremony. It began by the silent and\r\nsolemn lighting of a quantity of black wax candles and by opening the\r\ntabernacle wherein were deposited the books of the Law of Moses. Thus\r\nwere the imaginations of the faithful prepared for all the horror of the\r\nscene. The chief rabbi, the ancient friend and master, now the fiercest\r\nenemy, of the condemned, was to order the execution. He stood there\r\npained, but implacable; the people fixed their eager eyes upon him. High\r\nabove, the chanter rose and chanted forth in loud lugubrious tones the\r\nwords of execration; while from the opposite side another mingled with\r\nthese curses the thrilling sounds of the trumpet. And now the black\r\ncandles were reversed and were made to melt drop by drop into a huge tub\r\nfilled with blood.\" (Lewes: Biographical History of Philosophy.)\r\n\r\nThen came the final anathema. \"'With the judgment of the angels and of\r\nthe saints, we excommunicate, cut off, curse and anathematize Baruch de\r\nEspinoza, with the consent of the elders and all this holy congregation,\r\nin the presence of the holy books: by the 613 precepts which are written\r\ntherein, with the anathema wherewith Joshua cursed Jericho, with the\r\ncurse which Elisha laid upon the children, and with all the curses which\r\nare written in the law. Cursed be he by day, and cursed be he by night.\r\nCursed be he in sleeping, and cursed be he in waking, cursed in going\r\nout, and cursed in coming in. The Lord shall not pardon him, the wrath\r\nand the fury of the Lord shall henceforth be kindled against this man,\r\nand shall lay upon him all the curses written in the Book of the Law.\r\nThe Lord shall destroy his name under the sun, and cut him off for his\r\nundoing from all the tribes of Israel, with all the curses of the\r\nfirmament which are written in the Law * * * And we warn you that none\r\nmay speak with him by word of mouth nor by writing, nor show any favor\r\nunto him, nor be under one roof with him, nor come within four cubits of\r\nhim, nor read any paper composed by him.'\" (Pollock: Life of Spinoza.)\r\n\r\n\"As the blasting words were uttered, the lights were all suddenly\r\nimmersed in the blood, a cry of religious horror and execration burst\r\nfrom all; and in that solemn darkness, and to those solemn curses, they\r\nshouted Amen, Amen!\" (Professor J. K. Hosmer: The Jews.)\r\n\r\nThat is a commentary on the decree of denunciation. It also throws a\r\nvery strong light on the pressure which is brought against many Jews who\r\nwould cry out against the anti-social ideas of their people, but who\r\ndare not because of the penalties it would bring.\r\n\r\nThis denunciation, as Protocol Seventeen orders, is to be made against\r\nanyone who is \"known to be opposed to the Kahal\" or ancient Soviet\r\nsystem of the Jews.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the Jewish state by the Romans, the Jews\r\nmaintained a center in the Patriarch; and after the dispersion of the\r\nJews out of Palestine this center of nationality was preserved in the\r\nPrince of the Exile, or Exilarch, an office which is believed to persist\r\nto the present time, and which some believe to be held now by an\r\nAmerican Jew. In spite of all assertions to the contrary, the Jews have\r\nnever ceased to be \"a people\"; that is, a consciously united racial\r\ngroup, different from all others, and with purposes and ideals which are\r\nstrictly of the Jews, by the Jews, and for the Jews in distinction from\r\nthe rest of the world. That they constitute a nation within the nations,\r\nthe most responsible Jewish thinkers not only declare but insist upon.\r\nAnd this is wholly in accord with the facts as observed. The Jew not\r\nonly desires to live apart from other people, but he works with his own\r\npeople as against others, and he desires as much as possible to live\r\nunder his own laws. In the city of New York today, the Jews have\r\nsucceeded in establishing their own court for the settlement of their\r\nown questions according to their own laws. And that is precisely the\r\nprinciple of the Soviet-Kahal.\r\n\r\nFrom the first century forward, as any reader can see by consulting the\r\nJewish Encyclopedia, the \"community,\" \"assembly\" or \"Kahal\" has been the\r\ncenter of Jewish life. It was so earlier, in the time of the Babylonian\r\ncaptivity. And the last official appearance of it was at the Peace\r\nConference, where the Jews, in accordance with their World Program, the\r\nonly program that passed successfully and unchanged through the Peace\r\nConference, secured for themselves the right to the Kahal for\r\nadministrative and cultural purposes in addition to many other\r\nprivileges in countries where their activities had been a matter of\r\nprotest. The Polish question is purely a Jewish question, and\r\nPaderewski's failure as a statesmen was entirely due to his domination\r\nby Jewish influences. The Rumanian question is likewise a Jewish\r\nquestion, and all Rumanians speak of the United States as \"The Jews'\r\nCountry\" because they know through their statesmen the terrific pressure\r\nwhich was exerted by American Jews against their country, a pressure\r\nextending to the very necessities of life, and which compelled Rumania\r\nto sign agreements which are as humiliating as those that Austria asked\r\nof Serbia, out of which the World War grew. The Jewish Question is\r\nwritten all over the forces that provoked the war, and over all the\r\nhindrances to peace which the world has since seen.\r\n\r\nUnder the Kahal or ancient Soviet, the Jews lived by themselves and\r\ngoverned themselves, doing business with the government solely through\r\ntheir representatives. It was communism in a more drastic form than has\r\nbeen seen anywhere in the world outside Russia. Education, health,\r\ntaxes, domestic affairs, all were under the absolute control of a few\r\nmen who constituted the ruling board. This board, as the present-day\r\nJewish hierarchy is supposed to be, was self-perpetuating, the office\r\noften passing in an unbroken line of hereditary succession through many\r\ngenerations. All property was in common, which however did not prevent\r\nthe leaders becoming rich. These Kahals or Soviets existed in Rome,\r\nFrance, Holland, Germany, Austria, Russia, Denmark, Italy, Rumania,\r\nTurkey and England. In the United States the idea has developed around\r\nthe synagogue and around national and international secret societies of\r\nJews, of which more will be said in succeeding articles.\r\n\r\nThe Kahal is the traditional Jewish political institution during the\r\ndispersal of the race among the nations. Its international aspect is to\r\nbe seen in the higher councils. These councils enlarged as the Jews\r\nspread over the world. The Jewish Encyclopedia cites the Council of\r\nThree Lands, the Council of Four Lands, and the Council of Five Lands,\r\nshowing an international relationship in earlier years. But like all\r\nsuch records, public view of them is not easily accessible so far as\r\nthey relate to modern times. The recent Zionist Congress in London,\r\nwhere doubtless much business was done that pertained to the Jewish\r\npeople throughout the world, though not in public halls by any means,\r\nmay be called the Council of Thirty-Seven Lands, for the delegates to\r\nthat congress came from all parts of the world, from points remote as\r\nLapland and South Africa, Persia and New Zealand. The purpose of these\r\nWorld Councils was the unification of the Jews, and the records of their\r\nassemblages run back through the centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore no new thing that has arisen in Russia. It is the\r\nimposition by the Jewish revolutionists upon Gentile Russia of a form of\r\ncontrol in which Judaism has been schooled from the earliest times of\r\nits contact with the world. Soviet Russia could not have been possible\r\nhad not 90 per cent of the commissars been Jewish. Soviet Hungary could\r\nnot have been possible had not Bela Kun, the chief Red, been a Jew, and\r\nhad not 18 of his 24 commissars been Jews. The Jews are the only group\r\nschooled in the erection and administration of the Kahal.\r\n\r\nAn Associated Press dispatch under date of August 12 throws a light on\r\nthe congeniality of the Soviet system and the Jewish mind. Speaking of\r\nthe Polish towns and villages occupied by Bolshevik forces in their\r\nrecent drive, the dispatch says:\r\n\r\n\"The local Jewish parish populations already are said to be setting up\r\nSoviet and Communist governments.\"\r\n\r\nOf course. Yet this is in strange contrast with what we are constantly\r\ntold through the press of the sufferings of the Jews under the Soviet\r\nform and of their abhorrence of the Reds. However, most of what we read\r\nconcerning this in the public press is Jewish propaganda, pure and\r\nsimple, and the reports of men on the spot contradict it all. One relief\r\nworker testifies that relief work in Poland is frequently \"hung up\r\nbecause some Jew landlord asks an exorbitant rent for his premises,\"\r\nwhile another testifies that though railroad fares in the supposedly\r\nfamine-stricken districts have gone up 1,000 per cent, the best and\r\nhighest-fare trains are \"exclusively occupied by Jews.\" He adds, of his\r\ntrip through Hungary, \"The Hungarians have no money any more, but the\r\nJews have.\"\r\n\r\n\"But American Jews abhor Trotsky and Sovietism\" is the plea sometimes\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nDo they?\r\n\r\nOn page 9 of the American Jewish World, of July 30, a letter signed\r\n\"Mrs. Samuel Rush\" appears. It is headed: \"Are We Really Ashamed of\r\nTrotsky?\" Read a few excerpts from it:\r\n\r\n\"I have read of late several laments from editors of Jewish publications\r\nthat the Jew is now libeled as a radical.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that many Jews are radicals. It is also true that some of\r\nthe radical leaders are Jews.\r\n\r\n\"But before weeping over the downfall of the race, let's think a bit.\r\n\r\n\"Trotsky himself has never been represented as anything but a cultured\r\nman, a student of world economics, a powerful and efficient leader and\r\nthinker who will surely go down in history as one of the great men our\r\nrace has given the world.\r\n\r\n\"* * * Very few of us doubt any longer that behind the absurdities\r\nwritten about Russia is the great truth that Russia is in that unsettled\r\nstate which attends reconstruction. There is a plan behind this seeming\r\ndisorder, and out of the upheaval will come order. It will not be\r\nutopia, but as good a government as the undoubtedly high-minded\r\npractical idealists who are building for Russia can build with the\r\nnecessarily imperfect materials--human beings--with which they must\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"And one of the leaders is Leon Trotsky!\r\n\r\n\"Are we really ashamed of Trotsky?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady is evidently not ashamed of Trotsky, or Mr. Braunstein, as his\r\nreal name is.\r\n\r\nOr take Judge Harry Fisher, of Chicago. While drawing a salary for work\r\nin the court, Judge Fisher went abroad on Jewish relief work. His plans\r\nwere changed somewhat after his departure and he landed in Russia. He\r\nasserts in several interviews that he was permitted to arrive in Russia\r\non condition that he leave political matters alone. There has been no\r\nsuch restriction placed upon him since his return to the United States,\r\nfor he appears as an open advocate of full trade relations with the\r\nSoviet Government of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Tribune thus quotes him:\r\n\r\n\"'We must leave Russia alone' he said in summarizing his views. 'We\r\nshould resume trade with the Soviet. The Bolshevist Government is\r\npermanent. * * * While there are only 700,000 members of the Communist\r\nparty, the peasants, who represent almost 100,000,000 people, are\r\nsolidly back of the Lenin regime.'\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Soviet devices which the 100,000,000 peasants of Russia are\r\nsaid to be \"solidly back of,\" is the following (it is particularly\r\ninteresting in view of the fact that Judge Fisher is judge of the Morals\r\nCourt of Chicago):\r\n\r\n\"'Some time ago, it was published that the women of Russia had become\r\nnational property,' he said. 'That is untrue, but the ease with which\r\nmarriage and divorce may be effected makes for rapid changes. Everyone\r\nwanting to marry goes to what we would call the city hall and registers.\r\n\r\n\"'Inducements to marry are great. When people are hard pressed for\r\nclothes and food they sometimes make a pact to wed for a day.\r\n\r\n\"'The next day they go down to the city hall and register again. This\r\ntime their names are put side by side in the divorce book. That is all\r\nthat is necessary to be divorced, and they have had a good feed in the\r\nbargain.'\"\r\n\r\nJudge Harry Fisher, of Chicago, who has returned from Jewish relief work\r\nabroad, evidently is one with the others in not being ashamed of\r\nTrotsky.\r\n\r\nAlso Max Pine, for many years secretary of the United Hebrew Trades of\r\nNew York, had been abroad in Soviet Russia as \"a labor delegate.\" He too\r\nhad many good things to say of the Soviets, among other things the\r\nstrange contradiction that the Jews are doing very well in Russia but\r\nare not pro-Bolshevik!\r\n\r\nHere are three persons from widely different spheres of life, yet each\r\none of them indicates a natural liking for the Kahal or Soviet, an\r\nadmiration of its methods, and a distinct good feeling towards its\r\nrulers. For Sovietism is the rankest form of autocracy, and the marriage\r\nlaws of Soviet Russia are in full harmony with the program stated in the\r\nProtocols--\r\n\r\n\"We will break down the influence of family life among the Gentiles.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the Soviet-Kahals of Russia will succeed in completely\r\nundermining Russian family life is extremely doubtful. The weakness of\r\nSoviet rule is the same as that of the Protocols--a moral weakness that\r\nmust eat like a cancer until it destroys the institutions which it\r\ninfests.\r\n\r\nRussia today, viewed in the light of the Protocols, does not represent\r\nthe Judaic state, but it represents the Gentile state seized by Jewish\r\nforces. There are three degrees of action set forth in the Protocols.\r\nThere is first the secret process of breaking up the integrity of\r\nsociety by the admixture of alluring but disruptive ideas. This is a\r\nwork in which Gentile agitators are used. When the ideas have worked\r\nsufficiently to break up society and explode in a crisis, then as in\r\nGermany, the forces that have worked in secret swiftly come to the front\r\nto take the reins and guide the riot. In Germany this immediately\r\noccurred upon the collapse which followed the armistice, but the Germans\r\nwere wise enough to know the meaning of the influx of Jews into all the\r\nofficial positions of the former empire, and it was not long before they\r\nwere politically ousted. In Russia, however, the Jews sprang immediately\r\ninto official positions and have succeeded in remaining there. It began\r\nwith Kerensky compelling the Czar to lay aside his crown; it continues\r\nwith Trotsky and his armies at the throat of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut this seizure of a country, as was attempted in Germany, and as was\r\nnot only attempted but succeeded in Russia, is not the end of the\r\nProgram. It is only the beginning of its open or public phase. The\r\nSoviet-Kahal makes for the complete breaking up of society, the entire\r\ncutting off of co-operation and communication, the ruling of each little\r\nsection in the way desired, until the whole country lies helpless in\r\nisolated bits. The process includes, of course, the disintegration of\r\nindustry also, the massing of Gentiles into an army, and a general\r\ndestruction of morality and order. It is the Protocol program in its\r\nlast stage before the reconstruction begins which shall make the\r\nconquered country a Jewish state.\r\n\r\nThe world has not seen that last stage yet. It has not come, even in\r\nRussia. If the Russian people waken from the daze into which they have\r\nbeen thrust, it will not come. Jewish voices loudly proclaim that Soviet\r\nRussia has come to stay. The only authoritative voice on that subject is\r\nthe voice of Russia, and Russia has not yet spoken. Today the world is\r\ntrembling on the very verge of Real Russia's awakening, and with it a\r\nretribution most terrible upon the Sovietists.\r\n\r\nThe program of the Protocols once came near succeeding in the French\r\nRevolution, but its essential immorality overreached itself. It has come\r\na step nearer success in Russia, but there too its defiance of the moral\r\nlaw will be its undoing. The Jewish Question of today is being fought\r\nout in Russia and Poland, and the strength of the Jewish forces is\r\nlargely and mostly supplied from the United States of America. No wonder\r\nthose small East European independencies which are fighting for their\r\nlives refer to our country as \"The Land of the Jews.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will show our power to one,\" say the Protocols. \"In order to\r\ndemonstrate our enslavement of the Gentile governments of Europe, we\r\nshall show our power to one of them by crimes of violence, that is, by a\r\nreign of terror.\" (Protocol Seven.)\r\n\r\nOne by one the Gentile nations of Europe have been compelled to withdraw\r\ntheir troops from Russia. One by one the premiers of Europe have\r\nsubmitted to heavy shackling of their official hands with regard to the\r\nRussian question. And today the world looks on while little Poland,\r\napparently the second country on the list of Soviet victims, is made to\r\nfeel heavy vengeance for her daring to be independent of Jewish power.\r\nRussia has been made to pay for her attempted independence of the Jew;\r\nPoland is now being made to pay. It is a flame, the Jews of Eastern\r\nEurope hope, and many Jews of America also, which will sweep round the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIf the ruling Jews of the world wished the Russian people freed, if they\r\nwished the flames of Bolshevism to be quenched, if they wished Jewish\r\nparticipation in revolutionary movements to be withdrawn, they could\r\naccomplish it in a week. What is going on today is going on by\r\npermission of the Jewish world powers.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently no desire to curtail a movement which largely\r\noriginated in American Jewry. This is the program of \"showing our power\r\nto one,\" and the program will be followed out. The \"showing,\" however,\r\nis twofold; it is a showing of power, but it is also a showing of the\r\npeople who wield the power, and in the end it might have been just as\r\nwell had the power never been coveted, attained, or used.\r\n\r\nAnyone who desires to test the exactitude of the Protocols' estimate of\r\nhuman nature may do so by observing his own reactions to the Russian\r\nBolshevist situation. It is undeniable that there exists among all\r\nclasses of Gentiles in America a kind of admiration for the coup which\r\nLenin and Trotsky have managed on such a massive scale. The audacity of\r\nit, the ability to stay afloat thus long in defiance of so many laws,\r\nhave conspired to draw out unwilling applause.\r\n\r\nConsider then this passage from the Tenth Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"The people feel an especial love and respect toward the genius who\r\nwields political power, and they say of all his high-handed actions: 'It\r\nis base, but clever! It is a trick, but how he played it! So majestic!\r\nSo impudent!'\r\n\r\n\"We count on attracting all nations to the constructive work of laying\r\nthe foundations for the structure planned by us. It is necessary for us\r\nfirst of all to acquire the services of bold and fearless agents, who\r\nwill overcome all obstacles in our pathway.\r\n\r\n\"When we accomplish our governmental coup d'etat, we will say to the\r\npeople: 'Everything has gone badly, all have suffered. We will eliminate\r\nthe cause of your sufferings--nationality, frontiers and diversity of\r\ncoinage. Of course you are free to pronounce sentence upon us, but that\r\ncan scarcely be just if you do so before giving a trial to that which we\r\noffer you.'\"\r\n\r\nThis is very well conceived, and this is the way in which, up to this\r\ntime, it has worked out. But there will be a strong reaction set in.\r\nFalse promises like chickens come home to roost. The real originators,\r\nthe real purpose of the movement hidden behind Bolshevism will become\r\nevident. And then the world will crush out again the World Program which\r\nat times has seemed so near success.\r\n\r\nThere will probably be more light upon this World Program as a result of\r\nthe Russian Kahal-Soviet system than from any other attempt to realize\r\nit. For five generations the world has lived in a false light supposed\r\nto be shed by the French Revolution. It is now known that that\r\nrevolution was not the Revolution of the French People, but the\r\ndisorders of a minority who sought to impose upon the French People the\r\nvery Plan which is now being considered. It was the French People who\r\nultimately put down the so-called French Revolution. And France, as a\r\nresult of that upheaval of a well-organized minority, has been bound by\r\nJewish control ever since.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Revolution will go down in history with no such false halo\r\nof romance around it. The world now knows it for what it is. The world\r\nwill soon know whose was the money and whose were the brains that\r\nfostered it, and from what part of the world the principal impetus came.\r\nThe Russian upheaval is racial, not political nor economic. It conceals\r\nbeneath all its false socialism and its empty mouthings of \"human\r\nbrotherhood\" a clear-cut plan of racial imperialism, which is not\r\nRussian, and which the common sense and interest of the world will\r\nspeedily stamp out.\r\n\r\n[Issue of August 28, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nHow the \"Jewish Question\" Touches the Farm\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real estate speculations of the Jews are familiar to all, but\r\nunfortunately do not constitute their entire land program. Many American\r\ncities have changed their characters entirely during the past 15 years\r\nby reason of Jewish speculation in residence property, and it is a fact\r\nestablished in the larger eastern cities that the recent exorbitant and\r\nextortionate rise in rents was largely a matter of the Jewish landlord.\r\nThe governor of one of the most important of our commonwealths was loath\r\nto sign a bill regulating rents. His hesitancy was encouraged by very\r\nheavy pressure brought to bear upon him by the weightiest Jewish\r\nfinancial interests in his own and neighboring states. He finally\r\ndecided that he would sign the bill and give the law effect, and the\r\nfact that decided him was his personal investigation and the\r\ninvestigation of his personal agents into hundreds of cases of abuse\r\nwhere he discovered that it was a common practice among Jewish landlords\r\nto transfer the same piece of property round and round to every member\r\nof the family in turn, each \"transfer\" being the excuse for a new\r\nincrease in the rent. Men have their eyes opened to the Jewish Question\r\nin various ways: this was the way a governor had his eyes opened.\r\n\r\nThat, however, is not the peculiarity of Jewish landlords alone; Gentile\r\nlandlords have played the same trick. But landlordism is peculiarly a\r\nJewish ambition and distinction; the Jew is the Landlord of America. Any\r\ngroup of tenants almost anywhere in America, except the West, could\r\ntestify to this.\r\n\r\nNor is landlordism itself reprehensible, things being what they are,\r\nunless it is anti-social and anti-American. And just here is where it\r\ngets point. Some of the oldest and most sacred shrines of Americanism in\r\nthe East have entirely lost their character as such by the invasion--not\r\nof \"foreigners\"--but of Jews.\r\n\r\nThe more one sees of the invasion, the more one utterly distrusts the\r\nstatistics given out by Jews as to the Jewish population of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nDo you know that the one nationality on which the Government of the\r\nUnited States is estopped from asking questions, either for immigration\r\nor census statistics, is the Jewish?\r\n\r\nDo you know that when the Government of the United States wants to know\r\nanything about the Jews it must go to statisticians which the Jews\r\nthemselves support?\r\n\r\nIf a nation claims that it is no nation with respect to the United\r\nStates Government, as the Jews claim, and has no national statistics\r\nwhich it will permit to government to collect in the official way, why\r\nshould it treat itself as a nation and keep its own records?\r\n\r\nThe Jews of the United States, like the Jews of every European country,\r\nare a nation among themselves, with their own government, their own\r\npolicy, their own records; and the United States Government does\r\nbusiness with the Jewish Government in America through chosen Jews--no\r\ndoubt of that.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a digression. The matter of Jewish statistics will come\r\nup again. In the meantime a glance at the rapid changing of so many\r\nAmerican cities in all parts of the land leads to the belief that the\r\nJewish statistics furnished by the Jews for Gentile consumption entirely\r\nmisstate the facts, and this belief is strengthened by the knowledge\r\nthat the statistics given by the Jews for Jewish consumption are very\r\ndifferent from those supplied for the outside world.\r\n\r\nLandlordism may be explained by the inclination of the Jew toward\r\nspeculation, and we know that real estate has been made one of the most\r\nspeculative of occupations, disgracefully, almost disastrously so. The\r\nJew cannot be condemned for becoming a landlord, for becoming the most\r\nconspicuous landlord in America; he cannot be condemned apart from his\r\nGentile co-offenders for the abuse he has made of his advantage as\r\nlandlord. But it is a matter for American concern that the cities to\r\nwhich, in the schoolbooks, our children are taught to look as the\r\nbirthplaces of liberty and as still the spokesmen of Americanism, should\r\nbecome Semite cities, financially and politically, and the recruiting\r\ngrounds of the world's Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, however, the Jew in America has not cared for the land.\r\nIt is a characteristic. The Jew is not an agriculturist. Lavish fortunes\r\nhave been expended to make him so, but the productive work of farming\r\nhas not had, and does not now have, any appeal to him. His choice in\r\nland is this: land that produces gold from the mine, and land that\r\nproduces rents. Land that produces mere potatoes and wheat has not\r\ndirectly interested him.\r\n\r\nIt is true, of course, that the land question has been distinctly Jewish\r\nin countries like Poland and Rumania. No law against Jews owning land in\r\nthose countries has ever been effective in preventing their control of\r\nwhole provinces. Not that the Jews demanded the right to farm the land,\r\ntheir choice was to farm the farmers. By devious methods and the use of\r\n\"Gentile fronts\" they could always secure control of the land, and thus\r\ndominating the peasants they could create almost any condition they\r\nwished. That is what they actually did. That is the Jewish Question in\r\nthose parts of the world. Not for farming purposes, it must be\r\nunderstood, but for the purpose of controlling the main source of wealth\r\nin agricultural countries and for taking the control of people away from\r\ntheir natural Gentile leaders.\r\n\r\nThese two things always go together in countries where there is\r\nintellectual or landed aristocracy to which the people look for\r\nleadership: the Jewish program is to destroy that leadership by gaining\r\ncontrol of the land. It is profitable, of course, but when you survey\r\nthe outworking of the plan you always see something other than profits\r\ninvolved. The consummate perfection of the Jewish plan for World Control\r\nis that it does not involve sacrifice as have other plans, it is\r\nimmensely profitable at every stage, and the greater the profitableness\r\nthe more surely the purpose is being achieved.\r\n\r\nIn America there was no aristocracy to be cut under by the gaining of\r\nland control. Jewish activity in the United States until recently has\r\nconfined itself to the control of land products after they have been\r\nproduced: that is, so to say, Jewish interests do not engage in\r\ntrapping, but they control the fur trade.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of furs, it is very funny to see how some affairs turn out.\r\nDuring the war there was a great to-do made about the German control of\r\nthe American fur trade. It was true that the fur trade was controlled\r\nfrom Germany, but not by Germans--by Jews! And then a great to-do was\r\nmade about seizing, confiscating and absolutely selling out that\r\n\"German\" fur business to Americans, and the \"Americans\" who bought it\r\nwere--Jews! The actual control has never changed; the profits still find\r\ntheir way to the \"International\" purse.\r\n\r\nBut furs is just an example. Jewish interests do not engage in raising\r\ngrain, but control the grain that others produce. The need of the United\r\nStates is a \"Who's Who of Jewish Financiers\" that the people may\r\nidentify the men about whom they read as having made this \"corner\" or\r\nsprung that \"coup.\" These interests, which have simply grabbed\r\nAmerican-produced wealth and made American consumers pay and pay and\r\npay, have been able to operate almost openly because of the sheer\r\nblindness of the American people as they read their newspapers. And, of\r\ncourse, while the American newspaper will gladly inform you that this\r\nman is an Italian and that man a Pole and the other man a Briton, it\r\nwill never tell you that the fourth man is a Jew. There is a Jewish\r\norganization in every city, large and small, to prevent it--and they\r\nprevent it by methods that are violent and wholly subversive of the\r\nAmerican ideal of liberty.\r\n\r\nSo, until recently, the plan in the United States has been to seize the\r\ncommodity at just that point in its passage from the producer to the\r\nconsumer where the heaviest weight of profit can be extracted from\r\nit--at the neck of the bottle, so to speak--and control it there. It is\r\nnot service that the people pay for; they pay for seizure.\r\n\r\nBut a new movement has begun in the United States. Jewish millions are\r\nnow being used to secure immense tracts of American lands. Formerly it\r\nwas enough to control the cotton, as the bread was controlled, but now\r\nthe movement is toward controlling the cotton lands. The operations are\r\ncarefully guarded; \"Gentile fronts\" are used almost exclusively; but\r\nfollow the trail through all the \"blinds\" and \"false scents,\" and you\r\ncome at last to the International Jew, whose throne is set up in London.\r\n\r\nMany Jews have written THE DEARBORN INDEPENDENT saying that they do not\r\nknow about these racial plans for world control. It may well be believed\r\nthat they do not. One purpose of these articles is to tell them about\r\nit. But this every Jew rejoices in--the movement of his people toward\r\npower. And it is this sentiment that the International Jew implicitly\r\ntrusts, and because this sentiment exists the International Program\r\nsecures a maximum of success at a minimum risk of exposure. Jewry is not\r\na democracy but an autocracy. Of course the ordinary Jew does not know!\r\nThe question is, Why should he revile the Gentile who tries to tell him?\r\nIf a Jew will not seal his mind against the statements made in these\r\narticles, he will find in his own knowledge sufficient corroboration of\r\ntheir principal features, and he will be in a better position to assist\r\nin the solution of the Jewish Question.\r\n\r\nIt is with amazement at certain men's conception of editorial honesty\r\nthat THE DEARBORN INDEPENDENT has read some of the reports made of these\r\narticles. Under cover, principally of the Yiddish, alleged translations\r\nof these articles have been flung broadcast among non-English speaking\r\nJews, translations which not only bear no resemblance to the original,\r\nbut actually insert whole paragraphs of matter which never appeared in\r\nthe original at all. Is there a fear of permitting the average Jew to\r\nread this series? Nothing is more desired by those whose purpose is to\r\nlay foundations for the solution of the Jewish Question in America than\r\nthat every Jew in the United States should know exactly what is being\r\nprinted here week by week. The Jew has been deceived by his leaders long\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, then, that there is a definite and already well forwarded\r\nmovement toward the control of the cotton lands of the United States.\r\nThe first step was to depreciate the market value of these lands as much\r\nas possible. Pressure was brought through certain banks to limit the\r\ncotton farmers' efforts. They were told that if they planted more\r\nacreage to cotton than they were told to, they would not be financed.\r\nCotton production was to go down while cotton prices were to go up, and\r\nthe profits were not the farmers' but those who controlled the course of\r\ncotton from the first market to the wearer. Cotton farming was to be\r\nmade less profitable, while cotton speculation was to become more\r\nprofitable. The public was being compelled to supply the money by which\r\nthe Jewish controllers were to buy the land. In brief, it was to be made\r\nmore profitable to sell cotton lands than to sell cotton.\r\n\r\nThese statements are being deliberately restricted to the traffic in\r\ncotton lands. Jewish financiers in New York and London know these\r\nthings, even if Jewish editors and rabbis do not.\r\n\r\nThis movement has been within the knowledge of certain classes of\r\nbusiness men for a long time, indeed some have been forced by what used\r\nto be called \"the pressure of circumstances,\" to serve the movement. But\r\nthey were not able to interpret its meaning. It is only recently that\r\nthe more important Gentile business men of the United States have been\r\nable to interpret certain things. The war was a potent eye-opener.\r\n\r\nThose wonderful documents known as the \"Protocols,\" with their strong\r\ngrasp of every element of life, have not overlooked Land. The Land\r\nProgram found in the Sixth Protocol, which is one of the briefest of\r\nthese documents and may be quoted in full to show now the relation it\r\nbears to certain excerpts made in previous articles:\r\n\r\nProtocol VI.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon begin to establish huge monopolies, colossal reservoirs\r\nof wealth, upon which even the big Gentile properties will be dependent\r\nto such an extent that they will all fall together with the government\r\ncredit on the day following the political catastrophe. The economists\r\nhere present must carefully weigh the significance of this combination.\r\nWe must develop by every means the importance of our super-government,\r\nrepresenting it as the protector and benefactor of all who voluntarily\r\nsubmit to us.\r\n\r\n\"The aristocracy of the Gentiles as a political force has passed away.\r\nWe need not take them into consideration. But, as owners of the land,\r\nthey are harmful to us in that they are independent in their sources of\r\nlivelihood. Therefore, at all costs, we must deprive them of their land.\r\n\r\n\"The best means to attain this is to increase the taxes and mortgage\r\nindebtedness. These measures will keep land ownership in a state of\r\nunconditional subordination. Unable to satisfy their needs by small\r\ninheritances, the aristocrats among the Gentiles will burn themselves\r\nout rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"At the same time it is necessary to encourage trade and industry\r\nvigorously and especially speculation, the function of which is to act\r\nas a counterpoise to industry. Without speculation, industry will cause\r\nprivate capital to increase and tend to improve the condition of\r\nAgriculture BY FREEING THE LAND FROM INDEBTEDNESS FOR LOANS by the land\r\nbanks. It is necessary for industry to deplete the land both of laborers\r\nand capital, and, through speculations, transfer all the money of the\r\nworld into our hands, thereby throwing the Gentiles into the ranks of\r\nthe proletariat. The Gentiles will then bow before us to obtain the\r\nright to existence.\r\n\r\n\"To destroy Gentile industry, we shall, as an incentive to this\r\nspeculation, encourage among the Gentiles a strong demand for luxuries,\r\nall-enticing luxuries.\r\n\r\n\"We will force up wages, which however, will be of no benefit to\r\nworkers, for we will at the same time cause a rise in the prices of\r\nprime necessities, pretending that this is due to the decline of\r\nagriculture and of cattle raising. We will also artfully and deeply\r\nundermine the sources of production by instilling in the workmen ideas\r\nof anarchy, and encourage them in the use of alcohol, at the same time\r\ntaking measures to drive all the intellectual forces of the Gentiles\r\nfrom the land.\r\n\r\n\"That the true situation shall not be noticed by the Gentiles\r\nprematurely, we will mask it by a pretended effort to serve the working\r\nclasses and promote great economic principles, for which an active\r\npropaganda will be carried on through our economic theories.\"\r\n\r\nThe local and passing element in this is \"the aristocracy of the\r\nGentiles.\" That is to say, the program is not entirely fulfilled by the\r\npassing of aristocrats. Jewry goes on just the same. Its program\r\nstretches far. Jewry will retain such kings as it desires as long as it\r\ndesires them. Probably the last throne to be vacated will be the British\r\nthrone because what to the British mind is the honor of being Jewry's\r\nprotector and therefore the inheritor of the blessing which that\r\nattitude brings, is to the Jewish mind the good fortune of being able to\r\nuse a world-wide empire for the furtherance of Jewry's purpose. Each has\r\nserved the other and the partnership will probably last until Jewry gets\r\nready to throw Britain over, which Jewry can do at almost any time.\r\nThere are indications that it has already started in this last task.\r\n\r\nBut the permanent elements in the Protocol are the Land, the Jews, and\r\nthe Gentiles. A word of explanation may be necessary on this inclusion\r\nof the Gentiles as permanent: the Protocols do not contemplate the\r\nextermination of the Gentiles, nor the making of this world a completely\r\nJewish populated world. The Protocols contemplate a Gentile world ruled\r\nby the Jews--the Jews as masters, the Gentiles as hewers of wood and\r\ndrawers of water, a policy which every Old Testament reader knows to be\r\ntypically Jewish and the source of divine judgement upon Israel time and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNow, look at this whole Program as it concerns the Land.\r\n\r\n\"Owners of the land * * * are harmful to us in that they are independent\r\nin their sources of livelihood.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a foundation principle of the Protocols. It matters not whether\r\nthe owners are the \"Gentile aristocracy,\" the peasants of Poland, or the\r\nfarmers of the United States--land ownership makes the owners,\r\n\"independent in their sources of livelihood.\" And any form of\r\nindependence is fatal to the success of the World Program which is\r\nwritten so comprehensively in the Protocols and which is advancing so\r\ncomprehensively under Jewish guidance in the world of actual affairs\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nNot \"tillers\" of the land, not \"dwellers\" on the land, not \"tenants,\"\r\nnot an \"agricultural peasantry,\" but \"owners of the land\"--this is the\r\nclass singled out for attention in this Sixth Protocol, BECAUSE they are\r\n\"independent in their sources of livelihood.\"\r\n\r\nNow, there has been no time in the history of the United States when\r\napparently it was more easy for the farmer to own his land than now.\r\nMortgages should be a thing of the past. Everywhere the propaganda of\r\nthe question tells us that the farmers are growing \"rich.\" And yet there\r\nwere never so many abandoned farms!\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, at all costs we must deprive them of their land.\"\r\n\r\nHow? \"The best means to attain this is to increase land taxes and\r\nmortgage indebtedness.\" High taxes to keep the land at all, borrowed\r\nmoney to finance the tilling of it.\r\n\r\n\"These measures will keep land ownership in a state of unconditional\r\nsubordination.\"\r\n\r\nWe will leave it to the farmers of the United States to say whether this\r\nis working out or not.\r\n\r\nAnd in a future reference to this subject we will show that whenever an\r\nattempt is made to enable farmers to borrow money at decent rates,\r\nwhenever it is proposed to lighten the burden of \"mortgage indebtedness\"\r\non the farm, Jewish financial influence in the United States steps in to\r\nprevent it, or failing to prevent it, mess it all up in the operation.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the farmer's financial disability on the one hand, and by\r\nincreasing industrial allurements on the other, a very great deal is\r\naccomplished. The Protocol says: \"It is necessary for industry to\r\ndeplete the Land both of laborers and capital.\"\r\n\r\nHas that been done? Have the farms of the United States been depleted\r\nboth of laborers and capital? Certainly. Money is harder for the farmer\r\nto get than it is for any other man; and as for labor, he cannot get it\r\non any terms.\r\n\r\nWhat is the result of these two influences, the one working on the farm,\r\nand the other in the cities? It is precisely what the Protocol says it\r\nwill be: Increased wages that buy less of the materials of life--\"We\r\nwill at the same time cause a rise in the prices of prime necessities,\r\npretending that this is due to the decline of agriculture and cattle\r\nraising.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew who set these Protocols in order was a financier, economist and\r\nphilosopher of the first order. He knew what he was talking about. His\r\noperations in the ordinary world of business always indicated that he\r\nknew exactly what he was doing. How well this Sixth Protocol has worked\r\nand is still working out in human affairs is before the eyes of everyone\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nHere in the United States one of the most important movements toward\r\nreal independence of the financial powers has been begun by the farmers.\r\nThe farmer's strong advantage is that, owning the land, he is\r\nindependent in his sources of livelihood. The land will feed him whether\r\nhe pleases International Jewish Financiers or not. His position is\r\nimpregnable as long as the sun shines and the seasons roll. It was\r\ntherefore necessary to do something to hinder this budding independence.\r\nHe was placed under a greater disadvantage than any other business man\r\nin borrowing capital. He was placed more ruthlessly than any other\r\nproducer between the upper and nether stones of a thievish distribution\r\nsystem. Labor was drawn away from the farm. The Jew-controlled melodrama\r\nmade the farmer a \"rube,\" and Jew-made fiction presented him as a\r\n\"hick,\" causing his sons to be ashamed of farm life. The grain\r\nsyndicates which operate against the farmer are Jew-controlled. There is\r\nno longer any possibility of doubting, when the facts of actual affairs\r\nare put alongside the written Program, that the farmer of the United\r\nStates has an interest in this Question.\r\n\r\nWhat would this World Program gain if the wage-workers were enslaved and\r\nthe farmers were allowed to go scot-free? Therefore the program of\r\nagricultural interference which has been only partially outlined here.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all.\r\n\r\nAny writer who attempts fully to inform the Gentile mind on the Jewish\r\nQuestion must often feel that the extent of the Protocols' Conspiracy is\r\nso great as to stagger the Gentile mind. Gentiles are not conspirators.\r\nThey cannot follow a clue through long and devious and darkened\r\nchannels. The elaborate completeness of the Jewish Program, the perfect\r\nco-ordination of its mass of details wearies the Gentile mind. This,\r\nreally more than the daring of the Program itself, constitutes the\r\nprincipal danger of Program being fulfilled. Gentile mental laziness is\r\nthe most powerful ally the World Program has.\r\n\r\nFor example: after citing the perfectly obvious coincidence and most\r\nprobable connection between the Protocols and the observable facts with\r\nreference to the farm situation, the writer is compelled to say, as\r\nabove, \"But this is not all.\" And it is a peculiarity of Gentile\r\npsychology that the Gentile reader will feel that it ought to be all\r\nbecause it is so complete. This is where the Jewish mind out-maneuvers\r\nthe Gentile mind.\r\n\r\nGentiles may do a thing for one reason: the Jew often does the same\r\nthing for three or four reasons. The Gentile can understand thus far why\r\nJewish financiers should seek control of the land in order to prevent\r\nwidespread Agricultural Independence which, as Protocol Six says, would\r\nbe \"harmful to us.\" That reason is perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nBut there is another. It is found in the Twelfth Protocol. It\r\ncontemplates nothing less than the playing of City against Country in\r\nthe great game now being exposed. Complete control over the City by the\r\nindustrial leverage, and over the Country by the debt leverage, will\r\nenable the Hidden Players to move first the Country by saying that the\r\nCity demands certain things, and then move the City by saying that the\r\nCountry demands certain things, thus splitting Citizens and Farmers\r\napart and using them against one another.\r\n\r\nLook at the plainness and the boldness, yet the calm assurance, with\r\nwhich this plan is broached:\r\n\r\n\"Our calculations reach out, especially into the country districts.\r\nThere we must necessarily arouse those interests and ambitions which we\r\ncan always turn against the city, representing them to the cities as\r\ndreams and ambitions for independence on the part of the provinces. It\r\nis clear that the source of all this will be precisely the same, and\r\nthat it will come from us. It will be necessary for us before we have\r\nattained full power to so arrange matters that, from time to time, the\r\ncities shall come under the influence of opinion in the country\r\ndistricts, that is, of the majority prearranged by our agents * * *\"\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries of the game are here set forth--to jockey City and\r\nFarm against each other, that in the end the Conspirators may use\r\nwhichever proves the stronger in putting the Plan over. In Russia, both\r\nschemes have been worked. The old regime, established in the Cities, was\r\npersuaded to lay down power because it was made to believe that the\r\npeasants of Russia requested it. Then, when the Bolshevists seized\r\npower, they ruled the peasantry on the ground that the Cities wanted it.\r\nThe Cities listened to the Country, now the Country is listening to the\r\nCities.\r\n\r\nIf you see any attempt made to divide City and Farm into antagonistic\r\ncamps, remember this paragraph from the Twelfth Protocol. Already the\r\npoison is working. Have you never heard that Prohibition was something\r\nwhich the backwoods districts forced upon the cities? Have you never\r\nheard that the High Cost of Living was due to extravagant profits of the\r\nfarmer?--profits which he doesn't get.\r\n\r\nOne big dent in this Program of World Control could be made if the\r\nCitizen and the Farmer could learn each other's mind, not through\r\nself-appointed spokesmen, but directly from each other. City and Farm\r\nare drifting apart because of misrepresentation of outsiders, and in the\r\nwidening rift the sinister shadow of the World Program appears.\r\n\r\nLet the Farmers look past the \"Gentile fronts\" in their villages or\r\nprincipal trading points, past them to the real controllers who are\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\n[Issue of September 4, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nDoes Jewish Power Control the World Press?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this article is twofold: to set forth what the Protocols\r\nhave to say about the relation of the Press to the World Program, and to\r\nmake an introduction to a study of Jewish influence on the Press.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish race has always been aware of the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom news. This was one of the factors in its control of European\r\ncommerce from the earliest Christian times. To be informed beforehand,\r\nto know what was coming before the Gentiles among whom they lived knew\r\nit, was a special privilege of the Jews, made possible by the close\r\ncommunication in which widely separated Jewish groups kept themselves.\r\nFrom the first they were inveterate correspondents. They were the\r\ninventors of the news-letter.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply, however, that the Jews were the forerunners or even\r\nthe sponsors of the modern Press. It was no part of their purpose to\r\ndistribute news among the people, but to keep it for themselves as a\r\nsecret advantage. The political, economic and commercial news which sped\r\nwith really remarkable facility throughout Europe, from Jewish community\r\nto Jewish community, was in reality the official budget by which each\r\ncommunity informed all the others of what was transpiring, as to war,\r\ntrade currents, rising emergencies, or whatever the matter may have\r\nbeen. For centuries the Jews were the best informed people on the\r\ncontinent; from their secret sources in courts and chancellories, from\r\nprivileged Jews who were placed in every position of vantage, the whole\r\nrace was informed of the state of the world.\r\n\r\nScouts were kept in motion everywhere. Far down in South America, before\r\nthe British or Dutch colonies in North America had hardly secured a\r\nfoothold, there were Jews who served as outposts for European trade\r\ninterests. The world was spied out in the interests of their race, just\r\nas today the entire planet is under the watchful eyes of Jewish\r\nagents--mostly Gentiles, it must be said--for any hint of new gold\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and historic illustration of the Jews' appreciation of\r\nnews is to be found in the career of Nathan Rothschild. Rothschild had\r\nlaid all his plans on the assumption that the Emperor Napoleon, then\r\nbanished to Elba, was finally eliminated from European affairs. Napoleon\r\nunexpectedly returned, and in the \"Hundred Days\" it seemed as if the\r\nRothschild financial edifice might collapse. Feverishly the financier\r\naided both Prussia and England, and as the Battle of Waterloo\r\napproached, no one was more interested in the outcome than he.\r\n\r\nRothschild was a man who shrank from the sight of blood; he was\r\nphysically a coward, and any sign of violence unnerved him; but so\r\nintense was his interest in the battle on which his whole fortune seemed\r\nto depend, that he hastened to France, followed the British Army, and\r\nwhen the battle began he hid himself in \"some shot-proof nook near\r\nHougomont\" where he watched all day the ebb and flow of battle. Just\r\nbefore Napoleon ordered the last desperate charge Rothschild had made up\r\nhis mind. He said afterward that his exclamation at this point was, \"The\r\nHouse of Rothschild has won the battle.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried from the field, galloped wildly to Brussels, communicating\r\nnot a word of what he knew to the anxious people he met by the way.\r\nHiring a carriage at an exorbitant price, he galloped away to Ostend.\r\nHere a fierce storm was raging on the ocean and no sailor was willing to\r\nset out for England, about 20 miles away. Rothschild himself, always\r\nafraid of danger, forgot his fear in his visions of the stock market. He\r\noffered 500, 800, and at length 1,000 francs to the man who would take\r\nhim across. But no one dared. Finally one sailor proposed that if\r\nRothschild would pay 2,000 francs into his wife's hands, he would\r\nattempt it.\r\n\r\nHalf dead the two men reached the English coast, but without rest\r\nRothschild ordered express post and hurried away to London. Whip and\r\nspur were not spared on that journey.\r\n\r\nThere were no telegrams in those days, no swift communication. England\r\nwas anxious. The rumors were bad. And on the morning of June 20, 1815,\r\nwhen Nathan Rothschild appeared in his usual place at the Stock Exchange\r\nand leaned against the column, England knew nothing of what he knew. He\r\nwas pale and broken. The sight of his face led the other financiers to\r\nbelieve that he had received bad news from the front. Then it was seen\r\nthat he was quietly selling his securities. What? Rothschild unloading?\r\nThe market dropped disastrously, a very panic seized the financiers, the\r\nmarket was flooded with consols offered for sale--and all that was\r\noffered, Rothschild's agents bought!\r\n\r\nSo it went on, all day the 20th, and all day the 21st. At the close of\r\nbusiness the second day, Rothschild's heavy chests were crammed with\r\nsecurities. Then in the evening a courier galloped into London with the\r\nnews that Wellington had won and Napoleon was a fugitive. But Nathan\r\nRothschild had made $10,000,000 and the men he did business with had\r\nlost that much--all as an affair of news!\r\n\r\nThere was a little incident in Washington during the war--a \"leak\" of\r\nnews, it was called. The wise men of Wall Street sometimes whisper that\r\neven between 1914-1918 there were men of Rothschild's race who showed\r\nhis same appreciation of \"news,\" with the same profitable results. And\r\nnot only the men of \"Rothschild's race,\" but some of their \"Gentile\r\nfronts,\" also.\r\n\r\nThere were times during the war when no Gentile knew what was going on\r\nin certain countries. The Jewish leaders always knew. Some very\r\ninteresting testimony can be presented on that point.\r\n\r\nAside from its own interest, this Rothschild narrative fully illustrates\r\nthe statement that while the Jews were very early news-gatherers, they\r\nwere not publicists. They used the news for their own benefit; they did\r\nnot disseminate it. If it had depended on their influence, there would\r\nhave been no public Press at all. It was in France, which had no\r\nnewspapers outside the capital, that the French Revolution was possible.\r\nThere being no reliable exchange of news and opinion, the people were\r\nkept in ignorance. Paris itself did not know that the Bastille had\r\nfallen until next day. Where there is no Press, minorities easily gain\r\ncontrol--as the Jewish-Bolshevist revolution in Russia illustrates.\r\n\r\nOne of the most dangerous developments of the time is public distrust of\r\nthe Press. If the day ever comes when swift, reliable and authoritative\r\ncommunication with the entire people shall be necessary for public\r\naction in the interests of public safety, the nation may find itself\r\nsadly crippled unless a new confidence in the daily Press can be built\r\nup. If for no other reason than that the free press is a safeguard\r\nagainst minority seizure of control, such laws as the zone laws, or any\r\nrestrictions on the freest and fullest communication between various\r\nparts of the country, should be absolutely abolished.\r\n\r\nBut, the Press being in existence, and being largely an Anglo-Saxon\r\ncreation, it is a force not to be treated lightly, and that is the point\r\nwhere the World Program and Jewish Control come in contact with it.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols, which overlook nothing, propose a very definite plan with\r\nregard to the Press. As in the multitude of other matters with which\r\nthese remarkable documents deal, there are the two phases--\"what we have\r\ndone,\" and \"what we will do.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as the Second Protocol, the Press comes in for attention. It is\r\nsignificant that it makes its appearance in the same Protocol in which\r\nthe \"No Annexations\" program was announced 20 years before the World\r\nWar, in the same Protocol in which it is announced that Gentile rulers\r\nwill be allowed to appear before the people for a short period, while\r\nJewish influences were organizing themselves behind the seats of power,\r\nand in the same Protocol where Darwinism, Marxism and Nietzscheism are\r\nclaimed among the most \"demoralizing\" doctrines which Jewish influence\r\nhas disseminated. These are very curious statements, but not stranger\r\nthan the actuality that has come to pass.\r\n\r\nSays the Second Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"There is one great force in the hands of modern governments which\r\ncreates thought movements among the people, that is, the Press. The\r\npresumed role of the Press is to indicate supposedly indispensable\r\nneeds, to register popular complaints, and to create discontent. The\r\ntriumph of 'free speech' (babbling) rests in the Press. But governments\r\nare unable to profit by this power, and it has fallen into our hands.\r\nThrough it we have attained influence while remaining in the shadow.\r\nThanks to it, we have amassed gold, though it has cost us torrents of\r\nblood and tears.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same Protocol, \"our Press\" is spoken of as the agency through\r\nwhich are disseminated \"those theories of life which we have induced\r\nthem (the Gentiles) to regard as the dictates of science.\"\r\n\r\n\"To this end we shall certainly endeavor to inspire blind confidence in\r\nthese theories by means of our Press.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows the claim made concerning the three most revolutionary\r\ntheories in the physical, economic and moral realms, namely Darwinism,\r\nMarxism and Nietzscheism.\r\n\r\nIn the Third Protocol the claim is made that this control of the Press\r\nis being used to break down respect for authority:\r\n\r\n\"Daring journalists and audacious pamphleteers make daily attack upon\r\nthe personnel of the administration. This abuse of authority is\r\ndefinitely preparing the downfall of all institutions, and everything\r\nwill be overturned by blows coming from the infuriated populace.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Seventh Protocol, discussing the progress which the World\r\nProgram has already made, the part played by the Press is indicated:\r\n\r\n\"We must force the Gentile governments to adopt measures which will\r\npromote our broadly conceived plan already approaching its triumphal\r\ngoal, by bringing to bear the pressure of stimulated public opinion,\r\nwhich has in reality been organized by us with the help of the so-called\r\n'great power' of the Press. With few exceptions not worth considering,\r\nit is already in our hands.\"\r\n\r\nThus twice is the claim made to control of the Press. \"It has fallen\r\ninto our hands,\" says the Second Protocol. \"It is already in our hands,\"\r\nsays the Seventh. In the Second Protocol the Press is represented as\r\nfurthering revolutionary physical, economic and moral philosophies;\r\nwhile in the Seventh it is used to create the \"pressure of stimulated\r\npublic opinion\" for the purpose of \"forcing Gentile governments to adopt\r\nmeasures which will promote our broadly conceived plan, already\r\napproaching its triumphal goal.\"\r\n\r\nA word of comment may be made here upon the claim of the Second Protocol\r\nthat \"thanks to it (the Press), we have amassed gold, though it has cost\r\nus torrents of blood and tears.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a statement which can be illustrated in many ways. \"Though it\r\nhas cost us torrents of blood and tears\" is an admission upon which the\r\nProtocols throw light, a light which also shines upon the Jewish\r\nargument regarding responsibility for the recent war, namely, that\r\nJewish World Financial Power could not have willed the war seeing that\r\nJews suffered so heavily in Eastern Europe. The Protocols frankly\r\nrecognize the possibility of Jews suffering during the establishment of\r\nthe World Program, but it consoles them with the thought that they fall\r\nas soldiers for the good of Israel. The death of a Jew, we are told in\r\nthe Protocols, is more precious in the sight of God than the death of a\r\nthousand \"seed of cattle,\" which is one of the delicate names applied to\r\nthe Gentiles.\r\n\r\nThe reference to the amassment of gold is very clear. It does not apply\r\nto ownership of publications and a share in their profits only, but also\r\nthe use that may be made of them through silence or outcry to promote\r\nInternational Jewish Financiers' schemes. The Rothschilds bought editors\r\nas they bought legislators. It was a preliminary of nearly every scheme\r\nthey floated to first \"fix\" the newspapers, either for silence or claque\r\nboosting. In matters of war and peace; in the removal of administrations\r\ninimical to Jewish financial or political plans; in the elimination by\r\npublic exposure of \"Gentile fronts\" whom their Jewish masters wished to\r\nbe rid of; in the gradual building up of reputation and influence for\r\n\"rising men\" who had been chosen for work in the future--in these and\r\nlike matters the Press very greatly aided the International Cabal in\r\nattaining its end.\r\n\r\nAll the details of the foregoing paragraph can be illustrated at length\r\nby instances which have occurred in the United States within the past 15\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere was once a Senator of the United States who--but that story\r\nillustrates another point also, and will be reserved until that point is\r\nreached in this series of discussions.\r\n\r\nThe Twelfth Protocol, however, contains the entire plan of Control of\r\nthe Press, reaching from the present time into the future when the\r\nJewish World Government shall be established. The reader is invited to\r\nread carefully and thoughtfully the deep and wide outreaching of this\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nKeep also in mind the boast that has been made for generations that no\r\npublication that has handled the Jewish Question in a manner distasteful\r\nto the Jewish powers has been allowed to live.\r\n\r\n\"What role is played at present by the Press? It serves to inflame the\r\npassions of selfish partisanship which our interests require. It is\r\nshallow, lying and unfair, the most people do not understand what end it\r\nserves.\"\r\n\r\nIn that quotation we have the same low estimate which was noted when we\r\nstudied \"the estimate of human nature\" which the Protocols contain.\r\n\r\nNow, for the Plan of Press Control: We separate the points for\r\nconvenience:\r\n\r\n\"We shall handle the Press in the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. \"We shall saddle it and keep tight rein upon it. We shall do the same\r\nalso with other printed matter, for of what use is it to rid ourselves\r\nof attacks in the Press, if we remain exposed to criticism through\r\npamphlets and books?\"\r\n\r\n2. \"Not one announcement will reach the people save under our\r\nsupervision. We have attained this at the present time to the extent\r\nthat all news is received through several agencies in which it is\r\ncentralized from all parts of the world.\"\r\n\r\nA sidelight on the first sentence above may be had from the Jewish\r\nstatement regarding the British Declaration relating to Palestine: \"This\r\nDeclaration was sent from the Foreign Office to Lord Walter Rothschild.\r\n* * * It came perhaps as a surprise to large sections of the Jewish\r\npeople * * * But to those who were active in Zionist circles, the\r\ndeclaration was no surprise. * * * The wording of it came from the\r\nBritish Foreign Office, but the text had been revised in the Zionist\r\noffices in America as well as in England. The British Declaration was\r\nmade in the form in which the Zionists desired it. * * *\" pp. 85-86,\r\n\"Guide to Zionism,\" by Jessie E. Sampter, published by the Zionist\r\nOrganization of America.\r\n\r\n3. \"Literature and journalism are two most important educational forces,\r\nand consequently our government will become the owner of most of the\r\njournals. * * * If we permit ten private journals, we shall organize\r\nthirty of our own, and so on. This must not be suspected by the public,\r\nfor which reason all the journals published by us will be EXTERNALLY of\r\nthe most contrary opinions and tendencies thus evoking confidence in\r\nthem and attracting our unsuspecting opponents, who thus will be caught\r\nin our trap and rendered harmless.\"\r\n\r\nThis is most interesting in view of the defense now being made for so\r\nmany Jewish journals. \"Look at the newspapers owned and controlled by\r\nJews,\" they say; \"see how they differ in policy! See how they disagree\r\nwith each other!\" Certainly, \"externally,\" as Protocol 12 says, but the\r\nunderlying unity is never hard to find.\r\n\r\nBesides, one way of discovering who are the people that have knowledge\r\nof the Jewish World problem, of who can be convinced of it, or who will\r\nwrite about it is just to start a paper which \"externally\" seems to be\r\nindependent of the Jewish Question. So deeply is this thought shared by\r\neven uneducated Jews that a rumor is today widespread in the United\r\nStates that the reason for the present series of articles in THE\r\nDEARBORN INDEPENDENT is the desire of its owner to forward the Jewish\r\nWorld Program! Unfortunately, this scheme of starting a fake opposition\r\nin order to discover where the real opposing force is, is not confined\r\nto the Jewish Internationalists, although there is every indication that\r\nit was learned from them.\r\n\r\nThis idea of a misrepresentative front for certain secret purposes is\r\nexpressed at length not only with reference to the Press, but throughout\r\nthe Protocols in other relations. But in Protocol 12 it is fully\r\ndeveloped with regard to the Press, as the following quotations show.\r\n\r\n(a) In order to force writers into such long productions that no one\r\nwill read them, a tax on writing is proposed--\"on books of less than 30\r\npages a double tax.\" Small articles are most feared. Therefore doubly\r\ntax the pamphlets of less than 30 pages. The longer articles fewer will\r\nread, so the Protocols argue, and the double tax will thus \"force\r\nwriters into such long productions that they will be little read,\r\nespecially as they will be expensive.\"\r\n\r\nBUT--\r\n\r\n\"That which we ourselves shall publish for directing the public mind\r\nwill be cheap and widely read. The tax will discourage mere literary\r\nambition, whereas the fear of punishment will make the writers\r\nsubservient to us. Even if there should be those who may desire to write\r\nagainst us, no one will publish their writings.\" (How many American\r\nwriters know this!)\r\n\r\n\"Before accepting any work for printing, the publisher or printer must\r\nobtain permission from the authorities. Thus we will know in advance\r\nwhat attacks are being prepared against us and shall be able to\r\ncounteract them by coming out beforehand with explanations on the\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nThat is largely the situation today. They do know in advance what is\r\nbeing done, and they do seek to disarm it beforehand.\r\n\r\n(b) Here are the Three Degrees of Jewish Journalism, which are not only\r\nstated in the Protocols but are observable in the everyday world of the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"The leading place will be held by organs of an official character. They\r\nwill always stand guard over our interests and consequently their\r\ninfluence will be comparatively small.\r\n\r\n\"The second place will be held by semi-official organs whose aim it will\r\nbe to attract the indifferent and lukewarm.\r\n\r\n\"In the third category we shall place organs of apparent opposition. At\r\nleast one will be extremely antagonistic. Our true opponents will\r\nmistake this seeming opposition as belonging to their own group and will\r\nthus show us their cards.\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to notice that among those who attack us there will be organs\r\nfounded by us, and they will attack exclusively those points which we\r\nplan to change or eliminate.\r\n\r\n\"All our papers will support most diverse opinions: aristocratic,\r\nrepublican, even anarchist, so long of course as the Constitution lives.\r\n* * These fools who believe they are repeating the opinions expressed by\r\ntheir party newspapers will be repeating our opinions or those things\r\nwhich we wish them to think.\r\n\r\n\"By always discussing and contradicting our writings superficially, and\r\nwithout touching upon their essence, our press will keep up a blank fire\r\nagainst the official newspapers, only to give us opportunity to express\r\nourselves in greater detail than we could in our first declaration. This\r\nwill be done when useful to us.\r\n\r\n\"These attacks will also convince the people of the full freedom of the\r\npress, and it will give our agents the opportunity of declaring that the\r\npapers opposing us are mere wind-bags, since they cannot find any real\r\narguments to oppose our orders.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly that would be the case were all the papers controlled. In\r\nthe case of the present series of articles, however, the tables appear\r\nto be turned. It is the Jewish Press which has so signally failed to\r\nbring forward disproof either by fact or argument.\r\n\r\n\"When necessary, we shall promulgate ideas in the third section of our\r\nPress as feelers, and then refute them vigorously in the semi-official\r\npress.\r\n\r\n\"We shall overcome our opponents without fail because they will not have\r\norgans of the Press at their disposal.\r\n\r\n\"The pretext for suppressing a publication will be that it stirs up the\r\npublic mind without basis of reason\"--a pretext which has already been\r\nurged time and again, but without the legal power to effect suppression,\r\nalthough without legal power the Jewish interests in the United States\r\nhave effected a pretty complete suppression of everything they do not\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nHow far does Jewish influence control the Newspapers of the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nIn so far as the use of the word \"Jew\" is concerned, the Press is almost\r\ncompletely dominated. The editor who uses it is certain to hear from it.\r\nHe will be visited and told--contrary to everything the Jew is\r\ntold--that the word \"Jew\" denotes a member of a religious denomination\r\nand not a member of a race, and that its use with reference to any\r\nperson spoken of in the public prints is as reprehensible as if\r\n\"Baptist,\" \"Catholic,\" or \"Episcopalian\" were used.\r\n\r\nThe Jew is always told by his leaders that regardless of religion or\r\ncountry of birth, he is a Jew, the member of a race by virtue of blood.\r\nPages of this paper could be filled with the most authoritative Jewish\r\nstatements on this point. But what the Jew is told by his leaders, and\r\nwhat the Gentile editor is told by the Jewish committee are two\r\ndifferent and antagonistic things. A Jewish paper may shriek to the\r\nskies that Professor So-and-So, or Judge So-and-So, or Senator So-and-So\r\nis a Jew, but the secular newspaper that should do that would be visited\r\nby an indignant committee bearing threats.\r\n\r\nA certain newspaper, as a mere matter of news, published an excerpt from\r\none of THE DEARBORN INDEPENDENT articles. Next day a number of\r\nadvertising accounts dropped for lack of copy. Inquiry developed the\r\nfact that the reticent advertisers were all Jewish firms and the cause\r\nof their action was the really unimportant excerpt which the paper\r\npublished. It developed also that the advertising agent who handled all\r\nthe advertising for those Jewish firms was himself a Jew who also held\r\nan office in a Jewish secret society, which office was concerned\r\nexclusively with the control of newspapers in the matter of Jewish\r\npublicity. It was this man who dealt with the editor. A lame editorial\r\nretraction followed which faintly praised the Jews. The advertising was\r\nreturned to the paper, and it is just a question whether that editor was\r\nrightly handled or not. Certainly he has been made to feel the power.\r\nBut the diplomacy of it was bad. The editor, along with hundreds of\r\nothers, has only been given the proper background for estimating the\r\nJewish power in its wider reaches.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that every editor should enter upon a campaign to\r\nexpose the secret power. That is a matter for personal decision. Every\r\neditor, however, is so situated that he can see certain things, and he\r\nought to see them, note them, and inwardly digest them.\r\n\r\nJewish publicity in response to these articles is very easy to get in\r\nalmost any newspaper. Some have fallen most lamentably for lying\r\nstatements. Others have opened their columns to propaganda sent out from\r\nJewish sources. That is all very well. But the Gentile interest in the\r\nquestion has been largely ignored, even in cases where the editors are\r\nawake to the whole Question. This too affords a vantage from which the\r\naverage editor can view what is transpiring in this country.\r\n\r\nIf a list of the Jewish owners, bondholders and other interests in our\r\nnewspapers should be published the list would be impressive. But it\r\nwould not account for the widespread control of the Press as observed in\r\nthis country. Indeed, it would be unfair in such a connection as this to\r\nlist some of the Jewish-owned newspapers of the United States, because\r\ntheir owners are fair and public-spirited servants of the people.\r\n\r\nActual ownership does not often account for much in a newspaper.\r\nOwnership in the newspaper business in not always synonymous with\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know the control of the newspaper, look to its attorney\r\nand the interests he serves; look to the social connections of its chief\r\neditors; look to the advertising agents who handle the bulk of Jewish\r\nadvertising; and then look to the matter of the paper's partisanship or\r\nindependence in politics.\r\n\r\nNewspaper control of the Press by the Jews is not a matter of money. It\r\nis a matter of keeping certain things out of the public mind and putting\r\ncertain things into it.\r\n\r\nOne absolute condition insisted upon with the daily Press is that it\r\nshall not identify the Jew, mention him, or in any but the most\r\nfavorable way call the public's attention to his existence.\r\n\r\nThe first plea for this is based on \"fairness,\" on the false statement\r\nthat a Jew is not a Jew but a church member. This is the same statement\r\nwhich Jewish agents in the United States Government have used for years\r\nto prevent the United States Government from listing the Jews in any\r\nracial statistics. It is in direct contradiction to what the Jews\r\nthemselves are told. A flabby \"fairness,\" a sloppy \"broad-mindedness,\" a\r\ncry of \"religious prejudice,\" is the first plea. The second is a sudden\r\ncessation of Jewish patronage. The third is withdrawal of patronage by\r\nevery Gentile concern that is under the grip of Jewish financiers. It is\r\na mere matter of brutal bludgeoning. And the fourth act, in a community\r\nthoroughly blinded to the Jewish Question, is the collapse of the\r\noffending publication.\r\n\r\nRead the Jewish Encyclopedia for a list of some of the papers which\r\ndared open up the Question, and ceased!\r\n\r\nWhen old Baron Moses Montefiore said at Krakau:\r\n\r\n\"What are you prating about? As long as we do not have the press of the\r\nwhole world in our hands, everything you may do is vain. We must control\r\nor influence the papers of the whole world in order to blind and deceive\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n--he knew what he was saying. By \"blinding\" the people he only meant\r\nthat they should not see the Jew, and by \"deceiving\" them he only meant\r\nthat the people should think certain world movements meant one thing\r\nwhen they really meant another. The people may be told what happens:\r\nthey may not be told what was behind it. The people do not yet know why\r\ncertain occurrences which have affected their whole lives, should have\r\noccurred at all. But the \"why\" of it is very definitely known in certain\r\ncircles whose news service never sees print, and sometimes not even\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nStatistics as to the space given the Jews by newspapers concerning\r\nthings they want to get into print would also be an eye-opener. A\r\nminority nation, they get more publicity than any ten of the important\r\nminor nations of Europe--of the kind of publicity they want!\r\n\r\nThe number of Jewish contributors to the Press of the United States\r\nmakes another interesting statistical bit. It would be sheer prejudice\r\nto make objectionable mention of many Jewish journalists and writers,\r\nand they come within the scope of this study only as they have shown\r\nthemselves to be the watchful agents and active servants of the System.\r\nThis is what many of them are. Not the ambitious young Jewish reporter\r\nwho runs around the streets gathering news, perhaps, but the journalist\r\nat the seat of the news and at the necks of those two or three important\r\ninternational runways through which the news of the world flows.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter, as far as extent of control is concerned, could be\r\nvisualized on a map of the United States, by means of colored pins\r\nshowing the number of Jewish-owned, provably Jewish-controlled papers,\r\nand the number of Jewish writers who are directing the majority thought\r\nof the various sections of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish journalist who panders to unrest, whose literary ambition is\r\nto maintain a ferment in his readers, whose humor is sordid and whose\r\nphilosophy is one of negation; as well as the Jewish novelist who extols\r\nhis or her own people even while the story sows subtle seeds of\r\ndisruption in Gentile social or economic life must be listed as the\r\nagents of that World Program which would break down society through the\r\nagency of \"ideas.\" And it is very striking how many there are, and how\r\nskillfully they conceal their propaganda in their work.\r\n\r\nHere and there in the United States it is now becoming possible to print\r\nthe word \"Jew\" in the headlines of an article, and tell the Jewish\r\ncommittee which calls the next day that this is yet a free country.\r\nQuietly a number of newspapers have tested the strength of this assumed\r\ncontrol in their communities, and have discounted it.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for fear on the part of the editor who has his facts.\r\nBut the editor who backs down will more and more feel the pressure upon\r\nhim. The man who courageously and fairly holds his ground will soon\r\nlearn another thing that is not so generally known, namely, that with\r\nall the brilliance there is a lot of bluff, and that the chain of\r\ncontrol once broken is felt throughout the whole system as a blow.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that the International Jew fears so much as the truth,\r\nor any hint of the truth about himself or his plans. And, after all, the\r\nrock of refuge and defense, the foundation of endurance for Jew or\r\nGentile must be the Truth.\r\n\r\n[Issue of September 11, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nDoes This Explain Jewish Political Power?\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle has yet been said in this commentary on the Protocols about the\r\npolitical program contained in them. It is desirable that the points be\r\ntaken separately in order that when our study turns to actual conditions\r\nin this country, the reader may be in a position to judge whether the\r\nwritten program agrees with the acted program as it may be seen all\r\nabout us. The World Program as outlined in these strange documents turns\r\nupon many points, some of which have already been discussed. Its success\r\nis sought (a) by securing financial control of the world, this having\r\nalready been secured by the overwhelming indebtedness of every nation\r\nthrough wars, and by the capitalistic (not the manufacturing or\r\nmanagerial) control of industry; (b) by securing political control,\r\nwhich is easily illustrated by the condition of every civilized country\r\ntoday; (c) by securing control of education, a control which has been\r\nsteadily won under the blinded eyes of the people; (d) by trivializing\r\nthe public mind through a most complete system of allurement which has\r\njust brought us into a period which requires the new word \"jazz\" to\r\ndescribe it; and (e) by the sowing of seeds of disruption\r\neverywhere--not the seeds of progress, but of economic fallacies and\r\nrevolutionary temper. All of these main objectives entail various\r\navenues of action, none of which has been overlooked by the Protocols.\r\n\r\nIn leading up to what the Protocols have to say about the selection and\r\ncontrol of Presidents, it will be enlightening to take the views which\r\nthese documents express about other phases of politics.\r\n\r\nIt may be very interesting to those Jewish apologists, who in all their\r\npronouncements never discuss the contents of the Protocols, to know that\r\nso far from their being a plea for monarchy, they are a plea for the\r\nmost drastic and irresponsible liberalism in government. The powers\r\nbehind the Protocols appear to have absolute confidence in what they can\r\ndo with the people once the people are made to believe that popular\r\ngovernment has really arrived.\r\n\r\nThe Protocols believe in frequent change. They like elections; they\r\napprove frequent revisions of constitutions; they counsel the people to\r\nchange their representatives often.\r\n\r\nTake this from the First Protocol:\r\n\r\n\"The abstract conception of Liberty made it possible for us to convince\r\nthe crowd that government is only the management for the owner of the\r\ncountry, the people, and that the steward can be changed like a pair of\r\nworn-out gloves. The possibility of changing the representatives of the\r\npeople has placed them at our disposal and, as it were, has placed them\r\nin our power as creatures of our purposes.\"\r\n\r\nNote also how this Use of Change is buried in this paragraph from the\r\nFourth Protocol, which describes the evolution of a Republic:\r\n\r\n\"Every republic passes through several stages. The first is that of\r\nsenseless ravings, resembling those of a blind man throwing himself from\r\nright to left. The second is that of demagogy, which breeds anarchy and\r\ninevitably leads to despotism, not of a legal, open and consequently\r\nresponsible character, but an unseen and unknown despotism, felt none\r\nthe less because exercised by a secret organization. Such a despotism\r\nacts with even less scruple because it is hidden under cover and works\r\nbehind the backs of various agents, the shifting and changing of which\r\nwill not harm its secret power, but serve it, since such changes will\r\nrelieve the organization from the necessity of expending its resources\r\non rewards for long service.\"\r\n\r\nThis \"changing\" of servants is not unknown in the United States. A\r\nformer Senator of the United States could easily testify to this if he\r\nonly knew who did the \"changing.\" Time was when he was the tool of every\r\nJewish lobbyist in the Senate. His glib tongue lent charm and\r\nplausibility to every argument they wished to advance against the\r\ngovernment's intentions. Secretly, however, the Senator was receiving\r\n\"favors\" from a very high source, \"favors\" of a financial character. The\r\ntime came when it was desirable to \"detach\" the Senator. The written\r\nrecord of his \"favors\" was abstracted from its place of supposed\r\nsecrecy, a newspaper system that has always been the ready organ of\r\nAmerican Jewry made the exposure, and an indignant public did the rest.\r\nIt could not have been done had not the man been compromised first; it\r\ncould not have been done without certain newspaper connivance; it would\r\nnever have been done had not the Senator's masters wished it. However,\r\nit was done.\r\n\r\nIn the Fourteenth Protocol, which begins \"When we become rulers,\" it is\r\npictured how hopeless the Gentile peoples will have become of any\r\nbetterment of conditions through changes of government, and therefore\r\nwill accept the promise of stability which the Protocolists of that time\r\nwill be prepared to offer:\r\n\r\n\"The masses will become so satiated with the endless changes of\r\nadministration which we instigated among the Gentiles when we were\r\nundermining their governmental institutions, that they will tolerate\r\nanything from us * * *\"\r\n\r\nThe official who is changed most quickly in this country is the man who\r\nquestions certain matters which come from Jewish sources. There must be\r\na small army of such men in the United States today. Some of them do not\r\nknow even now how it happened. Some are still wondering why perfectly\r\nlegitimate and patriotic information should have been lost in an icy\r\nsilence when they sent it in, and why they should have lost favor for\r\nsending it.\r\n\r\nProtocol Nine is full of the most amazing claims, of which these may\r\nserve as illustration:\r\n\r\n\"At the present time, if any government raises a protest against us, it\r\nis only for the sake of form, it is under our control, and it is done by\r\nour direction, for their anti-Semitism is necessary for keeping in order\r\nour lesser brothers. I will not explain this further as already it has\r\nbeen the subject of numerous discussions between us.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of the usefulness of anti-Semitism and the desirability of\r\ncreating it where it does not exist are found in the words of Jewish\r\nleaders, ancient and modern.\r\n\r\n\"In reality there are no obstacles before us. Our super-government has\r\nsuch an extra-legal status that it may be called by the energetic and\r\nstrong word--dictatorship. I can conscientiously say that at the present\r\ntime we are the lawmakers.\"\r\n\r\nIn that Protocol this claim is made:\r\n\r\n\"De facto, we have already eliminated every government except our own,\r\nalthough de jure there are still many others left.\"\r\n\r\nThat is simple: the governments still exist, under their own names,\r\nhaving authority over their own people; but the super-government has\r\nunchallenged influence over all of them in matters pertaining to the\r\nJewish Nation and particularly in matters pertaining to the purpose of\r\nThe International Jew.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Protocol shows how this can be:\r\n\r\n\"For the time being, until it will be safe to give responsible\r\ngovernment positions to our brother Jews, we shall entrust them to\r\npeople whose past and whose character are such that there is an abyss\r\nbetween them and the people; to people, for whom, in case of\r\ndisobedience to our orders, there will remain only trial or exile (from\r\npublic life), thus forcing them to protect our interest to their last\r\nbreath.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Ninth Protocol again is this reference to party funds:\r\n\r\n\"The division into parties has placed them all at our disposal, inasmuch\r\nas in order to carry on a party struggle it is necessary to have money,\r\nand we have it all.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been many investigations of campaign funds. None has ever yet\r\ngone deep enough to inquire into the \"international\" sources of these\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nNow, in the United States during the last five years we have seen an\r\nalmost complete Judaized administration in control of all the war\r\nactivities of the American people. The function of the regularly\r\norganized United States Government during that time was practically\r\nconfined to the voting of money. But the administration of the business\r\nend of the war was in charge of a government within a government, and\r\nthis inner, extra government was Jewish.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, often asked why this was so. The first answer given is\r\nthat the Jews who were immediately placed in charge of the business\r\nadministration of the war were competent men, the most competent men who\r\ncould be found. This was actually the answer given to an inquiry as to\r\nthe reason for so large a part of the foreign policy of the United\r\nStates depending on the counsel of a certain group of Jews--they were\r\nthe men who knew, no one else knew so much, the officials chosen by the\r\npeople had a right to select the most efficient and able counsel they\r\ncould find.\r\n\r\nVery well, let that stand. Let the explanation be that in all the United\r\nStates, Jews were the only persons to be found who could handle the\r\nemergency with masterly ease. We shall see more of this phase of the\r\nmatter at another time. The war is not under discussion in this article,\r\nmerely the fact that in an emergency the government became distinctly\r\nJewish.\r\n\r\nBut the Second Protocol would appear to throw a little light on the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"The administrators chosen by us from the masses for their servility\r\nwill not be persons trained for government, and consequently they will\r\neasily become pawns in our game, played by our learned and talented\r\ncounsellors, specialists educated from early childhood to administer\r\nworld affairs. As we know, our specialists have been acquiring the\r\nnecessary knowledge for governing * * *\"\r\n\r\nThe language is a trifle raw, as it usually is when Gentiles are under\r\ndiscussion. But the same fact, namely, that Jewish specialists have come\r\nto the aid of Gentile administrators in an emergency, when uttered for\r\nthe consideration of the general public, may be very beautifully\r\nphrased.\r\n\r\nThe untrained Gentile administrator must have help; his unpreparedness\r\nmakes it necessary. And who knows it better than those who have the help\r\nto offer? The Gentile public has been taught to suspect the man who has\r\nhad experience in politics or government. This, of course, makes the\r\nwhole situation doubly easy for those whose speciality it is to give\r\n\"aid.\" Just what interests they aid most will give, when discovered, a\r\nstrong light upon their zeal.\r\n\r\nBut in all that the Protocols have to say about the political angle of\r\nthe World Program, nothing is of so great interest as that which\r\nconcerns the selection and control of Presidents. The whole plan is\r\noutlined in the Tenth Protocol. The fact that the President of France\r\nseems to have been in mind is a localism; the plan is applicable\r\nelsewhere; indeed has elsewhere its most perfect illustration.\r\n\r\nThis Tenth Protocol, then, leads gradually up to the subject, tracing\r\nthe evolution of rulers from Autocrat to President, and of nations from\r\nMonarchies to Republics.\r\n\r\nThe language of this passage is particularly objectionable, but no more\r\nso than can be found in current Jewish literature where boasting of\r\npower is indulged in. Unpleasant as the whole attitude is, it is\r\nvaluable as showing in just what light the supporters of the Protocol\r\nProgram view the Gentiles and their dignities. It must be born in mind\r\nthat the Jewish ideal is not a President, but a Prince and a King. The\r\nJewish students of Russia marched the streets in 1918 singing this\r\nhymn--\r\n\r\n\"We have given you a God; Now we will give you a King.\"\r\n\r\nThe new flag of Palestine, now permitted to fly without hindrance, bears\r\ninsignia, as does every synagogue, of a Jewish King. The Jewish hope is\r\nthat the Throne of David shall be set up again, as doubtless it will be.\r\nNone of these things is to be decried in the least, nor to be regarded\r\nwith anything but a decent respect, but they should be borne in mind as\r\na side light on the expressed contempt for Gentile Presidents and\r\nLegislatures.\r\n\r\nThe Tenth Protocol reaches the theme of President thus:\r\n\r\n\"Then the rise of the republican era became possible, and then in the\r\nplace of a sovereign we substituted a caricature of him, a President\r\npicked from the crowd * * * Such was the foundation of the mine we laid\r\nunderneath the Gentile people, or more accurately, the Gentile peoples.\"\r\n\r\nIt is with something of a shock that one reads that men with a \"past\"\r\nare specially favored for the presidential office. Men with a \"past\"\r\nhave become President in various countries, including the United States,\r\nthere is no doubt of that. In some instances, the particular scandal\r\nthat constituted the \"past\" has been publicly known; in other cases it\r\nhas been hushed up and lost in a maze of rumor. In at least one case it\r\nwas made the special property of a syndicate of men who, while\r\nprotecting the official from public knowledge, compelled him to pay\r\nrather stiffly for their service. Men with a \"past\" are not uncommon,\r\nand it is not always the \"past\" but the concealment of it that concerns\r\nthem most, and in this lack of frankness, this distrust of the\r\nunderstanding and mercy of the people, they usually fall into another\r\nslavery, namely, the slavery of political or financial blackmail.\r\n\r\n\"We will manipulate the election of Presidents whose past contains some\r\nundisclosed dark affair, some 'Panama,' then they will be faithful\r\nexecutors of our orders from fear of exposure and from the natural\r\ndesire of every man who has attained a position of authority to retain\r\nthe privileges, emoluments and the dignity associated with the position\r\nof President.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of the word \"Panama\" here refers to the various scandals which\r\narose in French political circles over the original efforts to construct\r\nthe Panama Canal. If the present form of the Protocols had been written\r\nat a later date they might have referred to the \"Marconi wireless\"\r\nscandals in England--though on second thought, they would not have done\r\nso because certain men were involved who were not Gentiles. Herzl, the\r\ngreat Jewish Zionist leader, uses the expression in \"The Jewish State.\"\r\nSpeaking of the management of the business of Palestine he says that the\r\nSociety of the Jews \"will see to it that the enterprise does not become\r\na Panama but a Suez.\" That the same expression should occur in Herzl and\r\nin the Protocols is significant; it has also another significance, which\r\nwill be described at another time. It must be clear to the reader,\r\nhowever, that no one writing for the general public at this day would\r\nrefer to a \"Panama\" in a man's past. The reference would not be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIt is this practice of holding a man under obligation which makes it\r\nneedful on the part of the true publicist to tell the truth and the\r\nwhole truth about aspirants for public office. It is not enough to say\r\nof a candidate that he \"began as a poor boy\" and then became\r\n\"successful.\" How did he become successful? How explain the \"rise\" of\r\nhis fortunes? Sometimes the clue leads deep into the domestic life of\r\nthe candidate. It may be told of a man, for example, that he helped\r\nanother out of a scrape by marrying the woman involved, and received a\r\nsum of money for doing so. It may be told of another that he was\r\nimplicated by his too friendly relations with another's wife, but was\r\nrelieved of his predicament by the astute diplomacy of powerful friends,\r\nto whom thereafter he felt himself in debt of honor. It is strange that,\r\nin American affairs at least, the woman-note is predominant. In our\r\nhigher offices that has more frequently occurred than any other, oftener\r\nthan the money-note.\r\n\r\nIn European countries, however, where the fact of a man's being\r\nentangled illegitimately with a woman does not carry so heavy a stamp of\r\nshame with it, the controlled men have been found to have \"pasts\" of\r\nanother character.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject is extremely distasteful, but truth has its surgical\r\nduties to perform, and this is one of them. When, for example, a pivotal\r\nassemblage like that of the Peace Conference is studied, and the men who\r\nare most subject to the Jewish influence are isolated, and their past\r\nhistory is carefully traced, there is almost no difficulty whatever in\r\ndetermining the precise moment when they passed over into that fateful\r\ncondition which, while it did not hinder them of public honors for one\r\nhour, made them unchangeably the servants of a power the public did not\r\nsee. The puzzling spectacle which the observer sees of the great leaders\r\nof Anglo-Saxon races closely surrounded and continuously counseled by\r\nthe princes of the Semitic race, is explained only by knowledge of those\r\nleaders' \"past\" and those words of the Protocols--\"We will manipulate\r\nthe election of Presidents whose past contains some undisclosed dark\r\naffair.\"\r\n\r\nAnd where this Jewish domination of officials is glaringly apparent, it\r\nmay be safely assumed that the custody of the secret is almost entirely\r\nwith that race. When necessity arises, it may be a public service for\r\nthose in possession of the facts to make them public--not for the\r\npurpose of destroying reputations, but for the purpose of damning for\r\nall time a most cowardly practice.\r\n\r\nPolitically, so the Jewish publicists tell us, Jews do not vote as a\r\ngroup. Because of this so we are told, they have no political influence.\r\nMoreover, we are told, they are so divided among themselves that they\r\ncannot be led in one direction.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that when it is a question of being for anything, the\r\nJewish community may show a majority and minority opinion--a small\r\nminority, it is likely to be. But when it becomes a question of being\r\nagainst anything, the Jewish community is always a unit.\r\n\r\nThese are facts to which any ward politician can testify. Any man in\r\npolitical life can test it for himself by announcing that he will not\r\npermit himself to be dominated by Jews or anybody else. Just let him\r\nmention Jews in that manner; he will no longer have to read about Jewish\r\nsolidarity; he will have felt it. Not that, in a vote, the Jewish\r\nsolidarity can accomplish anything it wishes; the Jew's political\r\nstrength is not in his vote, but in the \"pull\" of, say, seven men at the\r\nseat of government. The Jews, a political minority so far as votes are\r\nconcerned, were a political majority so far as influence was concerned,\r\nduring the last five years. They ruled. They boast that they ruled. The\r\nmark of their rule is everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe note which everyone observes in politics, as in the Press, is the\r\nfear of the Jews. This fear is such that nowhere are the Jews discussed\r\nas are, say, the Armenians, the Germans, the Russians, or the Hindoos.\r\nWhat is this fear but reflection of the knowledge of the Jews' power and\r\ntheir ruthlessness in the use of it? It is possibly true, as many Jewish\r\npublicists say, that what is called anti-Semitism is just a panic-fear.\r\nIt is a dread of the unknown. The uncanny spectacle of an apparently\r\npoor people who are richer than all, of a very small minority which is\r\nmore powerful than all, creates phantoms before the mind.\r\n\r\nIt is very significant that those who most assume to represent the Jews\r\nare quite content that the fear should exist. They wish it to exist. To\r\nkeep it delicately poised and always there, though not too obtrusively,\r\nis an art they practice. But once the balance is threatened, their\r\ncrudeness instantly appears. Then comes the threat, by which it is hoped\r\nto re-establish the fear again. When the threat fails, there comes the\r\nwail of anti-Semitism.\r\n\r\nHow strange this is, that the Jews should not see that the most abject\r\nform of anti-Semitism is just this fear which they are willing to have\r\nfelt toward them by their neighbors. This fear is \"Semitophobia\" in its\r\nworst form. To inspire fear--what is more dreaded by the normal man, and\r\nyet what more delights an inferior race?\r\n\r\nNow, a great service is done when the people are emancipated from this\r\nfear. It is the process of emancipation that Jewish publicists attack.\r\nIt is this they call anti-Semitism. It is not anti-Semitism at all; it\r\nis the only course that can prevent anti-Semitism.\r\n\r\nThe process involves several steps. The extent of the Jewish power must\r\nbe shown. To this, of course, strong Jewish objection is made, though no\r\nstrong disproof can be made.\r\n\r\nThen the existence of this power must be explained. It can be explained\r\nonly by the Jewish Will to Power, as it may be called, or by the\r\ndeliberate program which is followed in the attainment of the power.\r\nWhen the method is explained, half the damage is undone. The Jew is not\r\na superman. He is bright, he is intense, his philosophy of material\r\nthings leaves him free to do many things from which his neighbor draws\r\nback; but, given equal advantages, he is not a superman. The Yankee is\r\nmore than his equal any time, but the Yankee has an inborn inclination\r\nto observe the rules of the game. When the people know by what means\r\nthis power is gained--when they are informed how, for example, political\r\ncontrol is seized, as it has been in the United States, the very method\r\ntakes all the glamour from the power, and shows it to be a rather sordid\r\nthing after all.\r\n\r\nThis series of articles is attempting to take these orderly steps, and\r\nit is believed the complete effort will justify itself to reasonable\r\nminds, both Jewish and Gentile.\r\n\r\nIn the present article one important means of power has been described\r\non the authority of the Protocols. Whether the method laid down by the\r\nProtocols is worth considering or not depends entirely on whether it can\r\nbe found in actual affairs today. It can be found. The two tally. The\r\nparallel is complete. It were well for the Jew, of course, if no trace\r\nof him could be found in either the written or the actual program. But\r\nhe is there, and it is illogical for him to blame anyone but himself for\r\nbeing there. Certainly, it is small defense against the fact to heap\r\nabuse upon the one who discloses the fact. We have agreed that the Jews\r\nare clever, but they are not so clever as to be able to cover their\r\nwork. There is a certain element of weakness in them which reveals the\r\nwhole matter in the end. And even the revelation would not mean much if\r\nthe thing revealed were not wrong. But that is the weakness of the\r\nJewish program--it is wrong. The Jews have never gained any measure of\r\nsuccess so great that the world cannot check it. The world is engaged in\r\na great checking tactic now, and if there are still prophets among the\r\nJews they should lead their people in another path.\r\n\r\nThe proof and the fruit of any exposure of the World Program is the\r\nremoval of the element of fear from the peoples among whom the Jews\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n[Issue of September 18, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In a world of completely organized territorial sovereignties he (the\r\nJew) has only two possible cities of refuge; he must either pull down\r\nthe pillars of the whole national state system, or he must create a\r\nterritorial sovereignty of his own . . . . In Eastern Europe, Bolshevism\r\nand Zionism seem to grow side by side . . . . not because the Jew cares\r\nfor the positive side of radical philosophy, not because he desires to\r\nbe a partaker in Gentile nationalism or Gentile democracy, but because\r\nno existing Gentile system is ever anything but distasteful to him.\"\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nThe All-Jewish Mark on \"Red Russia\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly interrupt the commentary which we have been making\r\non the Protocols to set at rest once and for all certain misstatements\r\nwhich are made for Gentile consumption.\r\n\r\nTo learn what the Jewish leaders of the United States or any other\r\ncountry think, do not read their addresses to the Gentiles; read their\r\naddresses to their own people. On such matters as these--Whether the Jew\r\nregards himself as destined to rule the world; whether he regards\r\nhimself as belonging to a nation and race distinct from every other\r\nnation and race; whether he regards the Gentile world as the legitimate\r\nfield of his exploitation by a lower moral method than is permissible\r\namong his own people; whether he knows and shares the principles of the\r\nProtocols--on such matters as these, the only safe guide is to be found\r\nin the words which Jewish leaders speak to Jews, not in the words they\r\nspeak to Gentiles.\r\n\r\nThe notable Jewish names which appear oftenest in the Press do not\r\nrepresent the spokesmen of Judaism at all, but only a selected few who\r\nrepresent the Department of Propaganda Among the Gentiles. Sometimes\r\nthat propaganda is in the form of donations for Christian charitable\r\norganizations; sometimes it is in the form of \"liberal\" opinion on\r\nreligious, social and political questions. In whatever form it comes,\r\nyou may depend upon it that the real activities of the Jewish hierarchy\r\nproceed under cover of that which the Gentile is invited to observe and\r\napprove.\r\n\r\nThe statements offered in this series are never made without the\r\nstrictest and fullest proof, confirmation and corroboration in the\r\nutterances of Jewish leaders. This is one of the strange features of the\r\nmultitude of Jewish attacks on this series: they are attacking what they\r\nthemselves stand for, and their only reason for the attack must be their\r\nbelief that this investigation has not been able to penetrate through to\r\nthat which has been kept hidden from the world.\r\n\r\nThe most persistent denials have been offered to the statement that\r\nBolshevism everywhere, in Russia or the United States, is Jewish. In\r\nthese denials we have perhaps one of the most brazen examples of the\r\ndouble intent referred to above. The denial of the Jewish character of\r\nBolshevism is made to the Gentile; but in the confidence and secrecy of\r\nJewish communication, or buried in the Yiddish dialect, or obscurely\r\nhidden in the Jewish national press, we find the proud assertion\r\nmade--to their own people!--that Bolshevism is Jewish.\r\n\r\nJewish propaganda has only two straws to grasp in the terrible tale of\r\nmurder, immorality, robbery, enforced starvation and hideous humanism\r\nwhich make the present Russian situation impossible to describe and all\r\nbut impossible to comprehend.\r\n\r\nOne of these straws is that Kerensky, the man who eased in the opening\r\nwedge of Bolshevism, is not a Jew. Indeed, one of the strongest\r\nindications that Bolshevism is Jewish is that the Jewish press\r\nemphasizes so fiercely the alleged Gentilism of a least two of the\r\nrevolutionary notables. It may be cruel to deny them two among hundreds,\r\nbut merely saying so cannot change Kerensky's nationality. His name is\r\nAdler. His father was a Jew and his mother a Jewess. Adler, the father,\r\ndied, and the mother married a Russian named Kerensky, whose name the\r\nyoung child took. Among the radicals who employed him as a lawyer, among\r\nthe forces that put him forward to drive the first nail into Russia's\r\ncross, among the soldiers who fought with him, his Jewish descent and\r\ncharacter have never been doubted.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but there is Lenin,\" our Jewish publicists say--\"Lenin the head\r\nof it all, the brains of it all, and Lenin is a Gentile! We've got you\r\nthere--Lenin is a Gentile!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps he is, but why do his children speak Yiddish? Why are his\r\nproclamations put forth in Yiddish? Why did he abolish the Christian\r\nSunday and establish by law the Jewish Saturday Sabbath?\r\n\r\nThe explanation of all this may be that he married a Jewess. The fact is\r\nthat he did. But another explanation may be that he himself is a Jew.\r\nCertainly he is not the Russian nobleman he has always claimed to be.\r\nThe statements he has made about his identity thus far have been lies.\r\nThe claim that he is a Gentile may be unfounded too.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever doubted Trotsky's nationality--he is a Jew. His name is\r\nBraunstein. Recently the Gentiles were told that Trotsky had said he\r\nwasn't much of anything--in religion. That may be. But still he must be\r\nsomething--else why are the Russian Christian churches turned into\r\nstables, slaughter houses and dancing halls, while the Jewish synagogues\r\nremain untouched? And why are Christian priests and ministers made to\r\nwork on roads, while Jewish rabbis are left their clerical privileges?\r\nTrotsky may not be much of anything in religion, but he is a Jew\r\nnevertheless. This is not mere Gentile insistence that he shall be\r\nconsidered a Jew whether or no; it is straight Jewish teaching that he\r\nis. In a future discussion on \"religion or race?\" we shall show that\r\neven without religion, Trotsky is, and is considered by all Jewish\r\nauthorities to be, a Jew.\r\n\r\nAn apology must be made here for repeating well-known facts. Yet, so\r\nmany people are not even now aware of the true meaning of Bolshevism,\r\nthat at the risk of monotony, we shall cite a few of the salient facts.\r\nThe purpose, however, is not alone to explain Russia, but to throw a\r\nwarning light on conditions in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Bolshevik Government, as it stood late this summer when the latest\r\nreport was smuggled through to certain authorities, shows up the Jewish\r\ndomination of the whole affair. It has changed very slightly since the\r\nbeginning. We give only a few items to indicate the proportion. It must\r\nnot be supposed that the non-Jewish members of the government are\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\nVery few Russians have anything to say about their own country these\r\ndays. The so-called \"Dictatorship of the Proletariat,\" in which the\r\nproletariat has nothing whatever to say, is Russian only in the sense\r\nthat it is set up in Russia; it is not Russian in that it springs from\r\nor includes the Russian people. It is the international program of the\r\nProtocols, which might be \"put over\" by a minority in any country, and\r\nwhich is being given a dress-rehearsal in Russia.\r\n\r\nTable Showing Jewish Control of Russia\r\n\r\n                                | Number  | Number of | Jewish\r\n                                |   of    |  Jewish   |  Per-\r\n                                | Members |  Members  | centage\r\n--------------------------------+---------+-----------+--------\r\nThe Council of the Commissaries |         |           |\r\n  of the People                 |   22    |    17     |  77.2%\r\nThe Commissariat of War         |   43    |    33     |  76.7%\r\nThe Commissariat of Foreign     |         |           |\r\n  Affairs                       |   16    |    13     |  81.2%\r\nThe Commissariat of Finance     |   30    |    24     |  80.0%\r\nThe Commissariat of Justice     |   21    |    20     |  95.2%\r\nThe Commissariat of Public      |         |           |\r\n  Instruction                   |   53    |    42     |  79.2%\r\nThe Commissariat of Social      |         |           |\r\n  Assistance                    |    6    |     6     | 100.0%\r\nThe Commissariat of Work        |    8    |     7     |  87.5%\r\nDelegates of the Bolshevik Red  |         |           |\r\n  Cross to Berlin, Vienna,      |         |           |\r\n  Varsovie, Bucharest, Copen-   |         |           |\r\n  hagen                         |    8    |     8     | 100.0%\r\nCommissaries of the Provinces   |   23    |    21     |  91.3%\r\nJournalists                     |   41    |    41     | 100.0%\r\n\r\nThese are enlightening figures. The reader will note that the Jewish\r\npercentage is high at all times, never lower than 76 per cent in any\r\ncase. (Curiously enough, the lowest percentage of Jews is found in the\r\nCommissariat of War.) But in those committees which deal most closely\r\nwith the mass of the people, as well as in the committees of defense and\r\npropaganda, Jews fill literally all the places.\r\n\r\nRemember what the Protocols say about Press control: remember what Baron\r\nMontefiore said about it, and then look at the Government Journalists.\r\nThat committee comprises 41 men, and the 41 are Jews. Only Jewish pens\r\nare trusted with Bolshevist propaganda.\r\n\r\nAnd then the so-called \"Red Cross delegates,\" which are merely Red\r\nRevolutionary delegates to the cities named--of the 8, there are 8 Jews.\r\n\r\nThe Commissariat of Social Assistance, upon whose word the life and\r\nprivilege of tens of thousands hang--there are 6 members, and the 6 are\r\nJews. And so on through the list.\r\n\r\nOut of the 53 members of the Commissariat of Public Instruction, 11 are\r\nnoted as non-Jews. But what kind of non-Jews is not stated. They may be\r\n\"non-Jews like Lenin\" whose children speak the Yiddish as their native\r\ntongue. Whatever they are, there is a sidelight upon their attitude in\r\nthe fact that the Bolsheviki immediately took over all the Hebrew\r\nschools and continued them as they were and laid down a rule that the\r\nancient Hebrew language should be taught in them. The ancient Hebrew\r\nlanguage is the vehicle of the deeper secrets of the World Program.\r\n\r\nAnd for the Gentile Russian children--? \"Why,\" said these gentle Jewish\r\neducators, \"we will teach them sex knowledge. We will brush out of their\r\nminds the cobwebs. They must learn the truth about things!\"--with\r\nconsequences that are too pitiable to narrate. But this can be said:\r\nunquestionably there were deaths among innocent Jews when Hungary\r\nwrested itself free from the Red Bolshevism of Bela Kun (or Cohen). The\r\nJews may well call it the \"White Terror\" that followed their failure to\r\nre-enact the tragedy of Russia in Hungary. But there are mountains of\r\nevidence to show that nothing had so potent an effect in producing the\r\nbloodshed of the \"White Terror\" as the outraged minds of parents whose\r\nchildren had been compulsorily drawn through sloughs of filth during the\r\nshort time the Jewish Bolsheviki had charge of the schools.\r\n\r\nAmerican Jews do not like to hear this. Their shrinking from it would be\r\ngreatly to their honor did they not immediately return to the defense of\r\nthe people who do these things. It is well enough known that the\r\nchastity of Christians is not so highly regarded by the orthodox male\r\nJew as is the chastity of his own people, but it would be pleasant to be\r\ncertain that all of them condemn what went on in Russia and Hungary in\r\nthe matter of education. However, as most of the influences which\r\ndestroy Gentile youth today--in America--are in the hands of the Jews,\r\nand as it is plainly stated in the Protocols that one of the lines of\r\ncampaign is \"to corrupt the youth of the Gentiles,\" the situation is one\r\nthat calls for something more than mere hard feelings and angry denials\r\nwhenever these facts are referred to.\r\n\r\nIt is not the economic experiment, so-called, that one objects to in\r\nRussia; it is not the fallacies, the sad delusion of the people. No. It\r\nis the downright dirty immorality, the brutish nastiness of it all; and\r\nthe line which the immorality and nastiness draws between Jew and\r\nGentile. The horrible cruelty involved we will not deal with, leaving it\r\nmerely with the explanation which has found utterance in the Jewish\r\npress that \"it may be that the Jew in Russia is taking an unconscious\r\nrevenge for his centuries of suffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asks some reader, \"how may we know that all this is true?\"\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that we are speaking of Russia, not for the interest of\r\nthe Russian situation at all, but to indicate the international\r\ncharacter of those who are responsible for conditions there, and to\r\nidentify them for the protection of the United States, we shall look at\r\nthe evidence.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, the evidence brought to light by our own United\r\nStates Senate and printed in a Report of the Committee on the Judiciary.\r\nWe do not wish to spend much time on this, because we prefer in these\r\narticles to use Jewish testimony instead of Gentile. But we shall pause\r\nlong enough to show the nature of the testimony brought out by our own\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nDr. George A. Simons, a clergyman in charge of an American congregation\r\nin Petrograd at the time the Bolshevik terror broke out, was a witness.\r\nParts of his testimony are given here:\r\n\r\n\"'There were hundreds of agitators who followed in the trail of\r\nTrotsky-Bronstein, these men having come over from the lower East Side\r\nof New York * * * A number of us were impressed by the strange Yiddish\r\nelement in this thing right from the start, and it soon became evident\r\nthat more than half the agitators in the so-called Bolshevik movement\r\nwere Yiddish.'\r\n\r\n\"Senator Nelson--'Hebrews?'\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Simons--'They were Hebrews, apostate Jews. I do not want to say\r\nanything against the Jews, as such. I am not in sympathy with the\r\nanti-Semitic movement, never have been, and do not ever expect to be * *\r\n* But I have a firm conviction that this thing is Yiddish, and that one\r\nof its bases is found in the East Side of New York.'\r\n\r\n\"Senator Nelson--'Trotsky came over from New York during that summer,\r\ndid he not?'\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Simons--'He did.'\r\n\r\n\"Later Dr. Simons said: 'In December, 1918 * * * under the presidency of\r\na man known as Apfelbaum * * * out of 388 members, only 16 happened to\r\nbe real Russians, and all the rest Jews, with the exception possibly of\r\none man, who is a Negro from America, who calls himself Professor Gordon\r\n* * * and 265 of this northern commune government that is sitting in the\r\nOld Smolny Institute came from the lower East Side of New York--265 of\r\nthem. * * *\r\n\r\n\"'I might mention this, that when the Bolsheviki came into power, all\r\nover Petrograd we at once had a predominance of Yiddish proclamations,\r\nbig posters, and everything in Yiddish. It became very evident that now\r\nthat was to be one of the great languages of Russia; and the real\r\nRussians, of course, did not take very kindly to it.'\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Chapin Huntington, who was commercial attache of the United\r\nStates Embassy at Petrograd, testified:\r\n\r\n\"The leaders of the movement, I should say, are about two-thirds Russian\r\nJews * * * The Bolsheviks are internationalists, and they were not\r\ninterested in the particular national ideals of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam W. Welch, an employee of the National City Bank, New York,\r\ntestified:\r\n\r\n\"In Russia it is well known that three-fourths of the Bolshevik leaders\r\nare Jewish * * * There were some--not many, but there were some--real\r\nRussians; and what I mean by real Russians is Russian-born, and not\r\nRussian Jews.\"\r\n\r\nRoger E. Simmons, Trade Commissioner connected with the United States\r\nDepartment of Commerce, also testified. An important anonymous witness,\r\nwhom the committee permitted to withhold his name, told the same things.\r\n\r\nThe British White Book, Russia, No. 1--\"A Collection of Reports on\r\nBolshevism in Russia, presented to Parliament by Command of His Majesty,\r\nApril, 1919,\" contains masses of the same testimony from many sources,\r\nall of them eyewitnesses.\r\n\r\nIn that very highly respected magazine Asia for February-March, 1920, is\r\nan article which contains, among other important ones, these statements:\r\n(the italics are ours)\r\n\r\n\"In all the Bolshevist institutions the heads are Jews. The Assistant\r\nCommissar for Elementary Education, Grunberg, can hardly speak Russian.\r\nThe Jews are successful in everything and obtain their ends. They know\r\nhow to command and get complete submission. But they are proud and\r\ncontemptuous toward everyone, which strongly excites the people against\r\nthem * * * At the present time there is a great national religious\r\nfervor among the Jews. They believe that the promised time of the rule\r\nof God's elect on earth is coming. They have connected Judaism with a\r\nuniversal revolution. They see in the spread of revolution the\r\nfulfilling of the Scriptures: 'Though I make an end of all the nations\r\nwhither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make an end of thee.'\"\r\n\r\nNow if Gentile proof were wanted, the files of the THE DEARBORN\r\nINDEPENDENT for a whole year would not begin to contain it. But Jewish\r\nproof is better.\r\n\r\nThere has been a strange vacillation in Jewish opinion concerning\r\nBolshevism. At first it was hailed with delight. There was no\r\nconcealment whatever in the early days of the new regime as to the part\r\nwhich Jewry had in it. Public meetings, interviews, special articles\r\npoured forth in which very valuable elements of truth were mingled.\r\nThere was no attempt at concealment of names.\r\n\r\nThen the horror of the thing began to take hold upon the world, and for\r\njust a breathing space Jewish opinion fell silent. There was a spasmodic\r\ndenial or two. Then a new burst of glorification. The glorification\r\ncontinues within Judaism itself, but it now carries on the Gentile side\r\nof its face a very sad expression labeled \"persecution.\"\r\n\r\nWe have lived to see the day when to denounce Bolshevism is to\r\n\"persecute the Jews.\"\r\n\r\nIn the American Hebrew, for September 10, 1920, an article appears which\r\nnot only acknowledges and explains the part which the Jew plays in the\r\npresent unrest and upheaval, but justifies it--and justifies it,\r\ncuriously enough, by The Sermon on the Mount.\r\n\r\nThe writer says that \"the Jew evolved organized capitalism with its\r\nworking instrumentality, the banking system.\"\r\n\r\nThis is very refreshing, in view of the numerous Jewish denials of this\r\neconomic fact.\r\n\r\n\"One of the impressive phenomena of the impressive time is the revolt of\r\nthe Jew against the Frankenstein which his own mind conceived and his\r\nown hand fashioned * * *\" If this is true, why is Jewish \"organized\r\ncapital with its working instrumentality, the banking system\" supporting\r\nthe revolt?\r\n\r\n\"That achievement (referring to the Russian overthrow), destined to\r\nfigure in history as the overshadowing result of the World War, was\r\nlargely the outcome of Jewish thinking, of Jewish discontent, of Jewish\r\neffort to reconstruct.\"\r\n\r\n\"This rapid emergence of the Russian revolution from the destructive\r\nphase and its entrance into the constructive phase is a conspicuous\r\nexpression of the constructive genius of Jewish discontent.\"\r\n\r\n(This, of course, requires proof that the constructive phase has\r\nappeared. The implication here is sheer propaganda. The Protocols,\r\nhowever, have a reconstructive program. We have not reached it as yet in\r\nthis series of articles, but it is clearly outlined in the\r\nProtocols--destroy the Gentile society, and then reconstruct it\r\naccording to \"our\" plans.)\r\n\r\nNow read carefully:\r\n\r\n\"What Jewish idealism and Jewish discontent have so powerfully\r\ncontributed to accomplish in Russia, the same historic qualities of the\r\nJewish mind and heart ARE TENDING TO PROMOTE IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\"\r\n\r\nRead that again. \"What Jewish idealism and Jewish discontent have so\r\npowerfully contributed to accomplish in Russia!\" Just what was that? And\r\njust how did it \"powerfully contribute?\" And why are \"Jewish idealism\"\r\nand \"Jewish discontent\" always linked together? If you read the\r\nProtocols it is all very clear. Jewish idealism is the destruction of\r\nGentile society and the erection of Jewish society. Was it not so in\r\nRussia?--Yiddish proclamations on the walls, the ancient Hebrew in the\r\nschools, Saturday substituted for Sunday, and the rabbis respected while\r\nthe priests were put to work on the roads! All \"powerfully contributed\"\r\nto by murder, rapine, theft and starvation.\r\n\r\nOur author is more candid than he realizes. He calls this linked\r\nidealism and discontent \"the historic qualities of the Jewish mind.\" THE\r\nDEARBORN INDEPENDENT is indebted to him for this clear confirmation of\r\nwhat it has been saying for some time.\r\n\r\nBut even that is not all. \"These same historic qualities of the Jewish\r\nmind\" which \"contributed so powerfully to accomplish in Russia\" the Red\r\nTerror still existing there, are declared by this author to be tending\r\nto promote the same sort of thing in other countries. He says so in so\r\nmany words--\"tending to promote in other countries.\"\r\n\r\nBut we knew that. The only difference is that when Gentiles said it,\r\nthey were overwhelmed with the wildest abuse; but now a pro-Jewish\r\nwriter says it in a leading Jewish publication. And he says it\r\napologetically--listen to him:\r\n\r\n\"It was natural that * * * discontent in other parts of the world should\r\nfind expression in overemphasis of issues and overstatement of aims.\"\r\n\r\nWhat discontent? Jewish discontent, of course. Discontent with what?\r\nWith any form of Gentile rule. And how did it find expression? \"In\r\noveremphasis of issues and overstatement of aims.\" What were these\r\nissues and aims? To bring the Bolshevik revolution to the United States.\r\n\r\nNo, they did not overstate their aims; they exactly stated them--they\r\nsimply selected the wrong country, that's all.\r\n\r\nThere are Russian Bolshevists in this country now, hawking about the\r\nstreets of New York the gold cigaret cases which they stole from Russian\r\nfamilies, and the family jewels, the wedding and birthday rings, which\r\nthey filched from Russian women. Bolshevism never got further than the\r\npawnshop and burglar's \"fence\" idea. The proof of this traffic in stolen\r\nproperty is going to drive some people into hiding before long. It will\r\nbe a long, long time before America will be taking orders in Yiddish, or\r\nAmerican women will be giving up their jewels to \"the chosen race.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, that happens to be only the most recent acknowledgement that\r\nhas come to hand. It is significant for its confession that \"Jewish\r\ndiscontent\" was \"tending to promote\" in \"other countries\" what it has\r\n\"so powerfully contributed to accomplish in Russia.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with such a link between the American Hebrew, Russian Bolshevism and\r\nthe Protocols, there are still Jewish publicists with the crust to say\r\nthat only crazy people could see the connection. Only blind people will\r\nnot see it. But that is only a minor connection. This series of articles\r\ndoes not rest on anything so accidental as the Jewish New Year's apology\r\nfor Bolshevism in the great Hebrew weekly of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Issue of September 25, 1920.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Out of the economic chaos, the discontent of the Jew evolved organized\r\ncapital with its working instrumentality, the banking system . . . .\r\n\r\n\"One of the impressive phenomena of the impressive time is the revolt of\r\nthe Jew against the Frankenstein which his own mind conceived and his\r\nown hand fashioned. . . .\r\n\r\n\"That achievement (Russian Bolshevik revolution--Ed.), destined to\r\nfigure in history as the over-shadowing result of the World War, was\r\nlargely the outcome of Jewish thinking, of Jewish discontent, of Jewish\r\neffort to reconstruct . . . .\r\n\r\n\"What Jewish idealism and Jewish discontent have so powerfully\r\ncontributed to accomplish in Russia, the same historic qualities of the\r\nJewish mind and heart are tending to promote in other countries . . . .\r\n\r\n\"Shall America, like the Russia of the Czars, overwhelm the Jew with the\r\nbitter and baseless reproach of being a destroyer, and thus put him in\r\nthe position of an irreconcilable enemy?\r\n\r\n\"Or shall America avail itself of Jewish genius as it avails itself of\r\nthe peculiar genius of every other race? . . . .\r\n\r\n\"That is the question for the American people to answer.\"\r\n\r\n--From an article in The American Hebrew, Sept. 10, 1920.\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nJewish Testimony in Favor of Bolshevism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American people will answer that question, and their answer will be\r\nagainst the disruptive genius of dissatisfied Jews.\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that \"what Jewish idealism and Jewish discontent\r\nhave so powerfully contributed to accomplish in Russia\" is also being\r\nattempted in the United States. Why did not the writer in the American\r\nHebrew say the United States, instead of saying \"the same historic\r\nqualities of the Jewish mind and heart are tending to promote in other\r\ncountries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jewish idealism and Jewish discontent\" are not directed against\r\ncapital. Capital is enlisted in their service. The only governmental\r\norder the Jewish effort is directed against is Gentile governmental\r\norder; and the only \"capital\" it attacks is Gentile capital.\r\n\r\nLord Eustace Percy who, if one may judge by the full and appreciative\r\nquotations of his words in the Jewish press, has the sanction of\r\nthinkers among the Jews, settles the first point. Discussing the Jewish\r\ntendency to revolutionary movements he says:\r\n\r\n\"In Eastern Europe Bolshevism and Zionism often seem to grow side by\r\nside, just as Jewish influence molded Republican and Socialist thought\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century down to the Young Turk revolution in\r\nConstantinople hardly more than a decade ago--not because the Jew cares\r\nfor the positive side of radical philosophy, not because he desires to\r\nbe a partaker in Gentile nationalism or Gentile democracy, but because\r\nno existing Gentile system of government is ever anything but\r\ndistasteful to him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that analysis is absolutely true. In Russia, the excuse was the\r\nczar; in Germany, the kaiser; in England it is the Irish question; in\r\nthe numerous South American revolutions, where the Jews always had a\r\nruling hand, no particular reason was thought necessary to be given; in\r\nthe United States it is \"the capitalistic class;\" but always and\r\neverywhere it is, by the confession of their own spokesman, a distaste\r\nfor any form whatsoever of Gentile government. The Jew believes that the\r\nworld is his by right; he wants to collect his own, and the speediest\r\nway of doing so is the destruction of order by revolution--a destruction\r\nwhich is made possible by a long and clever campaign of loose and\r\ndestructive ideas.\r\n\r\nAs to the second point, every reader can verify the fact from his own\r\nexperience. Let him recall to his mind the capitalists who have been\r\nheld up to public scorn in the Jew-controlled press of the United\r\nStates--and whom does he find them to be? Whose forms have you seen\r\ncaricatured with the dollar-mark in Hearst's papers? Are they Seligman,\r\nKahn, Warburg, Schiff, Kuhn, Loeb & Company, or any of the others? No.\r\nThese are Jewish bankers. The attack is never made on them. The names\r\nmade most familiar to you by newspaper denunciation are the names of\r\nGentile industrial and banking leaders--and Gentile leaders only--the\r\nprincipal ones being Morgan and Rockefeller.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that during the French Commune when men of\r\nwealth suffered severe losses in property, the Jewish Rothschilds were\r\nnot injured to the extent of one pennyworth. It is also a well-known\r\nfact, capable of proof satisfactory to any ordinary mind, that the\r\nconnections between Jewish financiers and the more dangerous\r\nrevolutionary elements here in the United States are such that it is\r\nmost unlikely that the former stand to lose anything in any event. Under\r\ncover of the disorder in Russia at the present time, Jewish financiers\r\nare taking advantage of the stress of the people to gain control of all\r\nthe strategic natural resources and municipal property, by methods which\r\nthey fully expect to be legalized by Jewish courts when the present\r\n\"Bolshevik regime\" announces that it will give way to a \"modified\r\ncommunism.\" The world hasn't seen the end of Bolshevism yet. Like the\r\nWorld War, Bolshevism cannot be interpreted until it is seen who profits\r\nmost by it, and the profiteering is in full sway now. The enemy is\r\nGentile capital. Not any other. And \"all the wealth of the world is in\r\nour hands\" is the unspoken slogan of every Jewish outbreak in the world\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nThe quotation at the head if this article represents the position which\r\nthe Jews are now ready to take with reference to the Russian Revolution.\r\nThey have always been charged with responsibility for what has occurred\r\nin that unhappy country, but at first their spokesmen denied it. The\r\ndenials were most indignant, and were usually accompanied by the typical\r\nplaint that the charge was \"persecution.\" But the facts have been so\r\noverwhelming, and the government investigations have been so revealing,\r\nthat denials have been abandoned.\r\n\r\nFor a while an attempt was made to distract attention from Russia by a\r\ntremendously powerful propaganda concerning the Jews in Poland. There\r\nare many indications that the Polish propaganda was undertaken as a\r\n\"cover\" for the immense immigration of Jews into the United States. It\r\nmay be that some of our readers do not know it, but an endless stream of\r\nthe most undesirable immigrants pours daily into the United States, tens\r\nof thousands of the same people whose presence has been the problem and\r\nmenace of the governments of Europe.\r\n\r\nWell, the Polish propaganda and the immigration movement are sailing\r\nalong smoothly, and the United States Government is assured by the\r\nJewish ring at Washington that everything is quiet along the Potomac (it\r\nis quiet there, quiet as the Jewish ring could wish), but still the\r\nRussian fact persists in calling for explanation.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the explanation: The Jews created capitalism, we are told.\r\nBut capitalism has proved itself ill-behaved. So now, the Jewish\r\ncreators are going to destroy their creation. They have done so in\r\nRussia. And now, will the American people be good and let their Jewish\r\nbenefactors do the same in America?\r\n\r\nThat is the new explanation, and typically Jewish again, it is coupled\r\nwith a proposal for the United States--and a threat! If America refuses\r\nthis particular service of the Jew, we \"put him in a position of an\r\nirreconcilable enemy.\" See quotation at the head of this article.\r\n\r\nBut the Jews have not destroyed capitalism in Russia. When Lenin and\r\nTrotsky make their farewell bow and retire under the protective\r\ninfluence of the Jewish capitalists of the world, it will be seen that\r\nonly Gentile or Russian capital has been destroyed, and that Jewish\r\ncapital has been enthroned.\r\n\r\nWhat is the record? Documents printed by the United States Government\r\ncontain this letter: Please note the date, the Jewish banker and the\r\nJewish names:\r\n\r\n\"Stockholm, Sept. 21, 1917.\r\n\r\n\"To Mr. Raphael Scholan:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Comrade:--The banking house, M. Warburg, opened an account for the\r\nenterprise of Comrade Trotsky upon receipt of a telegram from the\r\nChairman of the 'Rhein-Westphalian Syndicate.' A lawyer, probably Mr.\r\nKestroff, obtained ammunition and organized the transportation of same,\r\ntogether with that of the money * * * to whom the sum demanded by\r\nComrade Trotsky is to be handed.\r\n\r\n\"Fraternal Greetings!\r\n\r\n\"Furstenberg.\"\r\n\r\nLong before that, an American Jewish financier was supplying the funds\r\nwhich carried revolutionary propaganda to thousands of Russian prisoners\r\nof war in Japanese camps.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said, by way of explaining the Bolshevik movement, that\r\nit was financed from Germany, a fact which was seized upon to supply war\r\npropaganda. It is true that part of the money came from Germany. It is\r\ntrue that part of the money came from the United States. It is the whole\r\ntruth that Jewish finance in all the countries was interested in\r\nBolshevism as an All-Jewish investment. For the whole period of the war,\r\nthe Jewish World Program was cloaked under this or that national\r\nname--the blame being laid on the Germans by the Allies, and on the\r\nAllies by the Germans, and the people kept in ignorance of who the real\r\npersonages were.\r\n\r\nIt was stated by a French official that two millions of money was\r\ncontributed by one Jewish banker alone.\r\n\r\nWhen Trotsky left the United States to fulfill his appointed task, he\r\nwas released from arrest at Halifax upon request of the United States,\r\nand everyone knows who constituted the War Government of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion, when all the facts are considered, is irresistible, that\r\nthe Bolshevik revolution was a carefully groomed investment on the part\r\nof International Jewish Finance.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, then, why the same forces would like to\r\nintroduce it to the United States. The real struggle in this country is\r\nnot between labor and capital; the real struggle is between Jewish\r\ncapital and Gentile capital, with the I.W.W. leaders, the Socialist\r\nleaders, the Red leaders and the labor leaders almost a unit on the side\r\nof the Jewish capitalists.\r\n\r\nAgain recall which financiers these men most attack. You cannot recall a\r\nsingle Jewish name.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose in these two articles, however, is to introduce the\r\nJewish testimony which exists as to the Jewish nature of Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish Chronicle, of London, said in 1919:\r\n\r\n\"There is much in the fact of Bolshevism itself, in the fact that so\r\nmany Jews are Bolsheviks, in the fact that the ideals of Bolshevism at\r\nmany points are consonant with the finest ideals of Judaism.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same paper, of 1920, is a report of an address made by Israel\r\nZangwill, a noted Jewish writer, in which he pronounced glowing praise\r\non \"the race which has produced a Beaconsfield, a Reading, a Montagu, a\r\nKlotz, a Kurt Eisner, a Trotsky.\" Mr. Zangwill, in his swelling Semitic\r\nenthusiasm, embraced the Jews in the British Government in the same\r\ncategory with the Jews of the Hungarian and Russian Bolshevik\r\ngovernments. What is the difference? They are all Jewish, and all of\r\nequal honor and usefulness to \"the race.\"\r\n\r\nRabbi J. L. Magnes, in an address at New York in 1919, is reported to\r\nhave said:\r\n\r\n\"When the Jew gives his thought, his devotion, to the cause of the\r\nworkers and of the dispossessed, of the disinherited of the world, the\r\nradical quality within him goes to the roots of things, and in Germany\r\nhe becomes a Marx and a Lassalle, a Haas and an Edward Bernstein; in\r\nAustria he becomes a Victor Adler and a Friedrich Adler; in Russia, a\r\nTrotsky. Just take for a moment the present situation in Russia and in\r\nGermany. The revolution set creative forces free, and see what a large\r\ncompany of Jews was available for immediate service. Socialist\r\nRevolutionaries and Mensheviki, and Bolsheviki, Majority and Minority\r\nSocialists--whatever they be called--Jews are to be found among the\r\ntrusted leaders and the routine workers of all these revolutionary\r\nparties.\"\r\n\r\n\"See,\" says the rabbi, \"what a large company of Jews are available for\r\nimmediate service.\" One ought to see where he points. There are as many\r\nJewish members of revolutionary societies in the United States, as there\r\nwere in Russia; and here, as there, they are \"available for immediate\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nBernard Lazare, a Jewish writer who has published a work on\r\nanti-Semitism, says:\r\n\r\n\"The Jew, therefore, does take a part in revolutions, and he\r\nparticipates in them in so far as he is a Jew, or more correctly, in so\r\nfar as he remains a Jew.\"\r\n\r\nHe says also--\"The Jewish spirit is essentially a revolutionary spirit,\r\nand consciously or otherwise, the Jew is a revolutionist.\"\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any country in the world, except the United States,\r\nwhere denials of this could be made in such a way as to require proof.\r\nIn every other country the fact is known. Here we have been under such a\r\nfear of mentioning the word \"Jew\" or anything pertaining to it, that the\r\ncommonest facts have been kept from us--facts which even a superficial\r\nknowledge of Jewish writing would have given us. It was almost a\r\npathetic spectacle to see American audiences go to lectures about the\r\nRussian situation, and come away from the hall confused and perplexed\r\nbecause the Russian situation is so un-Russian, all because no lecturer\r\nthought it politic to mention \"Jew\" in the United States, for, as some\r\nday we shall see, the Jew has contrived to gain control of the platform\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nNot only do the literary lights of Jewry acknowledge the Jew's\r\npropensity to revolution generally, and his responsibility for the\r\nRussian situation particularly, but the lower lights also have a very\r\nclear idea about it. The Jew in the midst of the revolution is conscious\r\nthat somehow he is advancing the cause of Israel. He may be a \"bad Jew\"\r\nin the synagogue sense, but he is enough of a Jew to be willing to do\r\nany thing that would advance the prestige of Israel. Race is stronger\r\nthan religion in Jewry.\r\n\r\nThe Russian paper, On to Moscow, in September, 1919, said:\r\n\r\n\"It should not be forgotten that the Jewish people, who for centuries\r\nwere oppressed by kings and czars, are the real proletariat, the real\r\nInternationale, which has no country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cohan, in the newspaper, Communist, in April, 1919, said:\r\n\r\n\"Without exaggeration, it may be said that the great Russian social\r\nrevolution was indeed accomplished by the hands of the Jews. Would the\r\ndark, oppressed masses of the Russian workmen and peasants have been\r\nable to throw off the yoke of the bourgeoisie by themselves? No, it was\r\nprecisely the Jews who led the Russian proletariat to the dawn of the\r\nInternationale and not only have led, but are also now leading the\r\nSoviet cause which remains in their safe hands. We may be quiet as long\r\nas the chief command of the Red Army is in the hands of Comrade Leon\r\nTrotsky. It is true that there are no Jews in the ranks of the Red Army\r\nas far as privates are concerned, but in the committees and Soviet\r\norganizations, as commissars, the Jews are gallantly leading the masses\r\nof the Russian proletariat to victory. It is not without reason that\r\nduring the elections to all Soviet institutions the Jews are winning by\r\nan overwhelming majority * * * The symbol of Jewry, which for centuries\r\nhas struggled against capitalism, has become also the symbol of the\r\nRussian proletariat, which can be seen even in the adoption of the Red\r\nfive-pointed star, which in former times, as it is well known, was the\r\nsymbol of Zionism and Jewry. With this sign comes victory, with this\r\nsign comes the death of the parasites of the bourgeoisie * * * Jewish\r\ntears will come out of them in sweat of drops of blood.\"\r\n\r\nThis confession, or rather boast, is remarkable for its completeness.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, says Mr. Cohan, are in control of the Russian masses--the\r\nRussian masses who have never risen at all, who only know that a\r\nminority, like the czar's minority, is in control at the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Jews are not in the Red Army, Mr. Cohan informs us, that is, in the\r\nranks where the actual fighting is done; and this is strictly in line\r\nwith the Protocols. The strategy of the World Program is to set Gentiles\r\nto kill Gentiles. This was the Jewish boast during the various French\r\nsocial disasters, that so many Frenchmen had been set killing each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the World War just passed, there were as many Gentiles killed by\r\nGentiles as there are Jews in the world. It was a great victory for\r\nIsrael. \"Jewish tears will come out of them in sweat of drops of blood.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Jews are in the places of control and safety, says Mr. Cohan,\r\nand he is absolutely right about it. The wonder is that he was so honest\r\nas to say it.\r\n\r\nAs to the elections, so-called, at which the Jews are so unanimously\r\nchosen, the literature of Bolshevism is very explicit. Those who voted\r\nagainst the Jewish candidates were adjudged \"enemies of the revolution\"\r\nand executed. It did not require many executions at a voting place to\r\nmake all the elections unanimous.\r\n\r\nMr. Cohan is especially instructive on the significance of the Red Star,\r\nthe five-pointed emblem of Bolshevism. \"The symbol of Jewry,\" he says,\r\n\"has become also the symbol of the Russian proletariat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Star of David, the Jewish national emblem, is a six-pointed Star,\r\nformed by two triangles, one standing on its base, the other on its\r\napex. Deprived of their base lines, these triangles approximate the\r\nfamiliar Masonic emblem of the Square and Compass. It is this Star of\r\nDavid of which a Jewish observer in Palestine remarks that there are so\r\nfew among the graves of the British solders who won Palestine in the\r\nrecent war; most of the signs are the familiar wooden Cross. These\r\nCrosses are now reported to be objectionable to the new rulers of\r\nPalestine, because they are so plainly in view of the visitor who\r\napproaches the new Jewish university. As in Soviet Russia, so in\r\nPalestine, not many Jews laid down their lives for the cause: there were\r\nplenty of Gentiles for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAs the Jew is a past master in the art of symbolism, it may not be\r\nwithout significance that the Bolshevik Star has one point less than the\r\nStar of David. For there is still one point to be fulfilled in the World\r\nProgram as outlined in the Protocols--and that is the enthronement of\r\n\"our leader.\" When he comes, the World Autocrat for whom the whole\r\nprogram is framed, the sixth point may be added.\r\n\r\nThe Five Points of the Star now apparently assured are the Purse, the\r\nPress, the Peerage, Palestine and Proletarianism. The sixth point will\r\nbe the Prince of Israel.\r\n\r\nIt is very hard to say, it is hard to believe, but Mr. Cohan has said\r\nit, and revolutions especially since the French Revolution confirm it,\r\nthat \"with this sign comes the death of the parasites of the bourgeoisie\r\n* * * Jewish tears will come out of them in sweat of drops of blood.\"\r\nThe \"bourgeoisie,\" as the Protocols say, are always Gentile.\r\n\r\nThe common counterargument to the invincible fact of the Jewish\r\ncharacter of the Russian revolution--an argument which is destined to\r\ndisappear now that Jewish acknowledgement is coming thick and fast--is\r\nthat the Jews in Russia suffer too. \"How can we favor a movement which\r\nmakes our own people suffer?\" is the argument put up to the Gentile.\r\n\r\nWell, the fact is this: they are favoring that movement. Today, this\r\nvery moment, the Bolshevik Government is receiving money from Jewish\r\nfinanciers in Europe, and if in Europe, then of course from the\r\nInternational Jewish bankers in America also. That is one fact.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is this: the Jews of Russia are not suffering to anywhere\r\nnear the extent we are told by the propagandists. It is now a fact\r\nadmitted by Jews themselves that upon the first sweep of the Bolshevists\r\nacross Poland, the Polish Jews were friendly with the invaders and\r\nhelped them. The fact was explained by American Jews in this manner:\r\nsince Bolshevism came to Russia, the condition of the Jews there has\r\ngreatly improved--therefore the Polish Jews were friendly. And it is\r\ntrue--the condition of Russian Jews is good.\r\n\r\nOne reason is: they have Russia. Everything there belongs to them.\r\n\r\nThe other reason is: The Jews of Russia are the only ones receiving help\r\nthere today.\r\n\r\nDid that second statement ever strike you as significant? Only the Jews\r\nof Russia have food and money sent to them. It is one form, of course,\r\nof the support which the Jewish world is giving Bolshevism. But if the\r\nsuffering among the Jews is what the propagandists say it is, what must\r\nit be among the Russians? Yet no one is sending food or money to them.\r\nThe probable truth of the whole situation is that Jewish Bolshevism is\r\nlaying a tax on the world. Any time it may be required, there is plenty\r\nof evidence as to the good condition of the Jews in Russia. They have\r\nall there is.\r\n\r\nAnother source of confusion is revealed in the question: \"How can Jewish\r\ncapitalists support Bolshevism when Bolshevism is against capitalism?\"\r\n\r\nBolshevism, as before stated, is only against Gentile capitalism. Jewish\r\nfinanciers who remained in Russia are very useful to the Bolsheviki.\r\nRead this description by an eyewitness: \"A Jew is this Commissary of the\r\nBank, very elegant, with a cravat of the latest style, and a fancy\r\nwaistcoat. A Jew is this District Commissary, former stockbroker, with a\r\ndouble bourgeois chin. Again a Jew, this inspector of taxes: he\r\nunderstands perfectly how to squeeze the bourgeoisie.\"\r\n\r\nThese agents of Jewry are still there. Other agents are among the\r\nRussians who fled, getting their lands away from them on mortgage loans.\r\nWhen the curtain lifts, most of the choice real estate will be found to\r\nhave passed into Jewish control by perfectly \"legal\" means.\r\n\r\nThat is one answer to the question, Why the Jewish capitalists support\r\nBolshevism. The Red Revolution is the greatest speculative event of\r\nhuman history. Besides, it is for the exaltation of Israel; it is a\r\ncolossal revenge, which the Jews always take where they can, for wrongs\r\nreal or imaginary.\r\n\r\nJewish capitalism knows exactly what it is doing. What are its gains?\r\n\r\n1. It has taken a whole rich country, without the cost of war.\r\n\r\n2. It has demonstrated the necessity of gold. Jewish power rests on the\r\nfiction that gold is wealth. By the premeditated clumsiness of the\r\nBolshevik monetary system, the unthinking world has been made to believe\r\nstill more strongly that gold is necessary, and this belief gives Jewish\r\ncapitalism another hold on the Gentile world. If the Bolshevists had\r\nbeen honest, they could have dealt Jewish capitalism its death blow. No!\r\nGold is still on its throne. Destroy the fiction that gold has value,\r\nand you leave the Jewish International Financiers sitting forlorn on\r\nheaps of useless metal.\r\n\r\n3. It has demonstrated its power to the world. Protocol Seven says: \"To\r\ndemonstrate our enslavement of the Gentile governments of Europe, we\r\nwill show our power to one of them by crimes of violence, that is, a\r\nreign of terror.\" Has Europe been sufficiently \"shown\"? Europe has, and\r\nis afraid! That is a great gain for Jewish capitalists.\r\n\r\n4. Not the least of the gains is the field practice in the art of\r\nrevolution which Russia has offered. Students of that Red school are\r\ncoming back to the United States. The technique of revolution has been\r\nreduced to a science according to the details laid down in the\r\nProtocols. To use Rabbi Magnes's words again: \"See what a large company\r\nof Jews was available for immediate service.\" The available company is\r\nnow much larger.\r\n\r\n[Issue of October 2, 1920.]",
