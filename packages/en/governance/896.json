Adam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ORATIONS\"\r\n\r\nBy John Quincy Adams\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Jubilee of the Constitution, delivered at New York, April 30, 1839,\r\nbefore the New York Historical Society.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens and Brethren, Associates of the New York Historical\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nWould it be an unlicensed trespass of the imagination to conceive that\r\non the night preceding the day of which you now commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary--on the night preceding that thirtieth of April, 1789, when\r\nfrom the balcony of your city hall the chancellor of the State of New\r\nYork administered to George Washington the solemn oath faithfully to\r\nexecute the office of President of the United States, and to the best\r\nof his ability to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the\r\nUnited States--that in the visions of the night the guardian angel of\r\nthe Father of our Country had appeared before him, in the venerated form\r\nof his mother, and, to cheer and encourage him in the performance of the\r\nmomentous and solemn duties that he was about to assume, had delivered\r\nto him a suit of celestial armor--a helmet, consisting of the principles\r\nof piety, of justice, of honor, of benevolence, with which from his\r\nearliest infancy he had hitherto walked through life, in the presence of\r\nall his brethren; a spear, studded with the self-evident truths of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence; a sword, the same with which he had led the\r\narmies of his country through the war of freedom to the summit of\r\nthe triumphal arch of independence; a corselet and cuishes of long\r\nexperience and habitual intercourse in peace and war with the world of\r\nmankind, his contemporaries of the human race, in all their stages of\r\ncivilization; and, last of all, the Constitution of the United States,\r\na shield, embossed by heavenly hands with the future history of his\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nYes, gentlemen, on that shield the Constitution of the United States was\r\nsculptured (by forms unseen, and in characters then invisible to mortal\r\neye), the predestined and prophetic history of the one confederated\r\npeople of the North American Union.\r\n\r\nThey had been the settlers of thirteen separate and distinct English\r\ncolonies, along the margin of the shore of the North American Continent;\r\ncontiguously situated, but chartered by adventurers of characters\r\nvariously diversified, including sectarians, religious and political, of\r\nall the classes which for the two preceding centuries had agitated\r\nand divided the people of the British islands--and with them were\r\nintermingled the descendants of Hollanders, Swedes, Germans, and French\r\nfugitives from the persecution of the revoker of the Edict of Nantes.\r\n\r\nIn the bosoms of this people, thus heterogeneously composed, there was\r\nburning, kindled at different furnaces, but all furnaces of affliction,\r\none clear, steady flame of liberty. Bold and daring enterprise, stubborn\r\nendurance of privation, unflinching intrepidity in facing danger,\r\nand inflexible adherence to conscientious principle, had steeled to\r\nenergetic and unyielding hardihood the characters of the primitive\r\nsettlers of all these colonies. Since that time two or three generations\r\nof men had passed away, but they had increased and multiplied with\r\nunexampled rapidity; and the land itself had been the recent theatre of\r\na ferocious and bloody seven years' war between the two most powerful\r\nand most civilized nations of Europe contending for the possession of\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nOf that strife the victorious combatant had been Britain. She had\r\nconquered the provinces of France. She had expelled her rival totally\r\nfrom the continent, over which, bounding herself by the Mississippi, she\r\nwas thenceforth to hold divided empire only with Spain. She had acquired\r\nundisputed control over the Indian tribes still tenanting the forests\r\nunexplored by the European man. She had established an uncontested\r\nmonopoly of the commerce of all her colonies. But forgetting all the\r\nwarnings of preceding ages--forgetting the lessons written in the blood\r\nof her own children, through centuries of departed time--she undertook\r\nto tax the people of the colonies without their consent.\r\n\r\nResistance, instantaneous, unconcerted, sympathetic, inflexible\r\nresistance, like an electric shock, startled and roused the people of\r\nall the English colonies on this continent.\r\n\r\nThis was the first signal of the North American Union. The struggle was\r\nfor chartered rights--for English liberties--for the cause of Algernon\r\nSidney and John Hampden--for trial by jury--the Habeas Corpus and Magna\r\nCharta.\r\n\r\nBut the English lawyers had decided that Parliament was omnipotent--and\r\nParliament, in its omnipotence, instead of trial by jury and the\r\nHabeas Corpus, enacted admiralty courts in England to try Americans for\r\noffences charged against them as committed in America; instead of\r\nthe privileges of Magna Charta, nullified the charter itself of\r\nMassachusetts Bay; shut up the port of Boston; sent armies and navies to\r\nkeep the peace and teach the colonies that John Hampden was a rebel and\r\nAlgernon Sidney a traitor.\r\n\r\nEnglish liberties had failed them. From the omnipotence of Parliament\r\nthe colonists appealed to the rights of man and the omnipotence of the\r\nGod of battles. Union! Union! was the instinctive and simultaneous\r\ncry throughout the land. Their Congress, assembled at Philadelphia,\r\nonce--twice--had petitioned the king; had remonstrated to Parliament;\r\nhad addressed the people of Britain, for the rights of Englishmen--in\r\nvain. Fleets and armies, the blood of Lexington, and the fires of\r\nCharlestown and Falmouth, had been the answer to petition, remonstrance,\r\nand address....\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of allegiance to the British crown, the severance of\r\nthe colonies from the British Empire, and their actual existence as\r\nindependent States, were definitively established in fact, by war and\r\npeace. The independence of each separate State had never been declared\r\nof right. It never existed in fact. Upon the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the dissolution of the ties of allegiance,\r\nthe assumption of sovereign power, and the institution of civil\r\ngovernment, are all acts of transcendent authority, which the people\r\nalone are competent to perform; and, accordingly, it is in the name and\r\nby the authority of the people, that two of these acts--the dissolution\r\nof allegiance, with the severance from the British Empire, and the\r\ndeclaration of the United Colonies, as free and independent States--were\r\nperformed by that instrument.\r\n\r\nBut there still remained the last and crowning act, which the people\r\nof the Union alone were competent to perform--the institution of civil\r\ngovernment, for that compound nation, the United States of America.\r\n\r\nAt this day it cannot but strike us as extraordinary, that it does not\r\nappear to have occurred to any one member of that assembly, which had\r\nlaid down in terms so clear, so explicit, so unequivocal, the foundation\r\nof all just government, in the imprescriptible rights of man, and the\r\ntranscendent sovereignty of the people, and who in those principles had\r\nset forth their only personal vindication from the charges of rebellion\r\nagainst their king, and of treason to their country, that their last\r\ncrowning act was still to be performed upon the same principles. That\r\nis, the institution, by the people of the United States, of a civil\r\ngovernment, to guard and protect and defend them all. On the contrary,\r\nthat same assembly which issued the Declaration of Independence, instead\r\nof continuing to act in the name and by the authority of the good people\r\nof the United States, had, immediately after the appointment of the\r\ncommittee to prepare the Declaration, appointed another committee,\r\nof one member from each colony, to prepare and digest the form of\r\nconfederation to be entered into between the colonies.\r\n\r\nThat committee reported on the twelfth of July, eight days after the\r\nDeclaration of Independence had been issued, a draft of articles of\r\nconfederation between the colonies. This draft was prepared by John\r\nDickinson, then a delegate from Pennsylvania, who voted against the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and never signed it, having been superseded\r\nby a new election of delegates from that State, eight days after his\r\ndraft was reported.\r\n\r\nThere was thus no congeniality of principle between the Declaration of\r\nIndependence and the Articles of Confederation. The foundation of the\r\nformer was a superintending Providence--the rights of man, and the\r\nconstituent revolutionary power of the people. That of the latter was\r\nthe sovereignty of organized power, and the independence of the separate\r\nor dis-united States. The fabric of the Declaration and that of the\r\nConfederation were each consistent with its own foundation, but they\r\ncould not form one consistent, symmetrical edifice. They were the\r\nproductions of different minds and of adverse passions; one, ascending\r\nfor the foundation of human government to the laws of nature and of\r\nGod, written upon the heart of man; the other, resting upon the basis\r\nof human institutions, and prescriptive law, and colonial charter. The\r\ncornerstone of the one was right, that of the other was power....\r\n\r\nWhere, then, did each State get the sovereignty, freedom, and\r\nindependence, which the Articles of Confederation declare it\r\nretains?--not from the whole people of the whole Union--not from the\r\nDeclaration of Independence--not from the people of the State itself. It\r\nwas assumed by agreement between the Legislatures of the several States,\r\nand their delegates in Congress, without authority from or consultation\r\nof the people at all.\r\n\r\nIn the Declaration of Independence, the enacting and constituent party\r\ndispensing and delegating sovereign power is the whole people of the\r\nUnited Colonies. The recipient party, invested with power, is the United\r\nColonies, declared United States.\r\n\r\nIn the Articles of Confederation, this order of agency is inverted. Each\r\nState is the constituent and enacting party, and the United States in\r\nCongress assembled the recipient of delegated power--and that power\r\ndelegated with such a penurious and carking hand that it had more\r\nthe aspect of a revocation of the Declaration of Independence than an\r\ninstrument to carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nNone of these indispensably necessary powers were ever conferred by the\r\nState Legislatures upon the Congress of the federation; and well was\r\nit that they never were. The system itself was radically defective. Its\r\nincurable disease was an apostasy from the principles of the Declaration\r\nof Independence. A substitution of separate State sovereignties, in the\r\nplace of the constituent sovereignty of the people, was the basis of the\r\nConfederate Union.\r\n\r\nIn the Congress of the Confederation, the master minds of James Madison\r\nand Alexander Hamilton were constantly engaged through the closing years\r\nof the Revolutionary War and those of peace which immediately succeeded.\r\nThat of John Jay was associated with them shortly after the peace,\r\nin the capacity of Secretary to the Congress for Foreign Affairs. The\r\nincompetency of the Articles of Confederation for the management of the\r\naffairs of the Union at home and abroad was demonstrated to them by the\r\npainful and mortifying experience of every day. Washington, though\r\nin retirement, was brooding over the cruel injustice suffered by his\r\nassociates in arms, the warriors of the Revolution; over the prostration\r\nof the public credit and the faith of the nation, in the neglect to\r\nprovide for the payments even of the interest upon the public debt; over\r\nthe disappointed hopes of the friends of freedom; in the language of\r\nthe address from Congress to the States of the eighteenth of April,\r\n1788--\"the pride and boast of America, that the rights for which she\r\ncontended were the rights of human nature.\"\r\n\r\nAt his residence at Mount Vernon, in March, 1785, the first idea\r\nwas started of a revisal of the Articles of Confederation, by the\r\norganization, of means differing from that of a compact between the\r\nState Legislatures and their own delegates in Congress. A convention\r\nof delegates from the State Legislatures, independent of the Congress\r\nitself, was the expedient which presented itself for effecting\r\nthe purpose, and an augmentation of the powers of Congress for the\r\nregulation of commerce, as the object for which this assembly was to\r\nbe convened. In January, 1785, the proposal was made and adopted in\r\nthe Legislature of Virginia, and communicated to the other State\r\nLegislatures.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was held at Annapolis, in September of that year. It\r\nwas attended by delegates from only five of the central States, who,\r\non comparing their restricted powers with the glaring and universally\r\nacknowledged defects of the Confederation, reported only a\r\nrecommendation for the assemblage of another convention of delegates\r\nto meet at Philadelphia, in May, 1787, from all the States, and with\r\nenlarged powers.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States was the work of this Convention.\r\nBut in its construction the Convention immediately perceived that they\r\nmust retrace their steps, and fall back from a league of friendship\r\nbetween sovereign States to the constituent sovereignty of the\r\npeople; from power to right--from the irresponsible despotism of\r\nState sovereignty to the self-evident truths of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. In that instrument, the right to institute and to alter\r\ngovernments among men was ascribed exclusively to the people--the ends\r\nof government were declared to be to secure the natural rights of man;\r\nand that when the government degenerates from the promotion to the\r\ndestruction of that end, the right and the duty accrues to the people\r\nto dissolve this degenerate government and to institute another. The\r\nsigners of the Declaration further averred, that the one people of the\r\nUnited Colonies were then precisely in that situation--with a government\r\ndegenerated into tyranny, and called upon by the laws of nature and of\r\nnature's God to dissolve that government and to institute another. Then,\r\nin the name and by the authority of the good people of the colonies,\r\nthey pronounced the dissolution of their allegiance to the king, and\r\ntheir eternal separation from the nation of Great Britain--and declared\r\nthe United Colonies independent States. And here as the representatives\r\nof the one people they had stopped. They did not require the\r\nconfirmation of this act, for the power to make the declaration had\r\nalready been conferred upon them by the people, delegating the power,\r\nindeed, separately in the separate colonies, not by colonial authority,\r\nbut by the spontaneous revolutionary movement of the people in them all.\r\n\r\nFrom the day of that Declaration, the constituent power of the people\r\nhad never been called into action. A confederacy had been substituted\r\nin the place of a government, and State sovereignty had usurped the\r\nconstituent sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Convention assembled at Philadelphia had themselves no direct\r\nauthority from the people. Their authority was all derived from the\r\nState Legislatures. But they had the Articles of Confederation before\r\nthem, and they saw and felt the wretched condition into which they had\r\nbrought the whole people, and that the Union itself was in the agonies\r\nof death. They soon perceived that the indispensably needed powers\r\nwere such as no State government, no combination of them, was by the\r\nprinciples of the Declaration of Independence competent to bestow. They\r\ncould emanate only from the people. A highly respectable portion of the\r\nassembly, still clinging to the confederacy of States, proposed, as\r\na substitute for the Constitution, a mere revival of the Articles of\r\nConfederation, with a grant of additional powers to the Congress.\r\nTheir plan was respectfully and thoroughly discussed, but the want of a\r\ngovernment and of the sanction of the people to the delegation of powers\r\nhappily prevailed. A constitution for the people, and the distribution\r\nof legislative, executive, and judicial powers was prepared. It\r\nannounced itself as the work of the people themselves; and as this was\r\nunquestionably a power assumed by the Convention, not delegated to\r\nthem by the people, they religiously confined it to a simple power\r\nto propose, and carefully provided that it should be no more than a\r\nproposal until sanctioned by the Confederation Congress, by the State\r\nLegislatures, and by the people of the several States, in conventions\r\nspecially assembled, by authority of their Legislatures, for the single\r\npurpose of examining and passing upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was consummated the work commenced by the Declaration of\r\nIndependence--a work in which the people of the North American Union,\r\nacting under the deepest sense of responsibility to the Supreme Ruler\r\nof the universe, had achieved the most transcendent act of power that\r\nsocial man in his mortal condition can perform--even that of dissolving\r\nthe ties of allegiance by which he is bound to his country; of\r\nrenouncing that country itself; of demolishing its government; of\r\ninstituting another government; and of making for himself another\r\ncountry in its stead.\r\n\r\nAnd on that day, of which you now commemorate the fiftieth\r\nanniversary--on that thirtieth day of April, 1789--was this mighty\r\nrevolution, not only in the affairs of our own country, but in the\r\nprinciples of government over civilized man, accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution itself was a work of thirteen years--and had never\r\nbeen completed until that day. The Declaration of Independence and the\r\nConstitution of the United States are parts of one consistent whole,\r\nfounded upon one and the same theory of government, then new in\r\npractice, though not as a theory, for it had been working itself into\r\nthe mind of man for many ages, and had been especially expounded in the\r\nwritings of Locke, though it had never before been adopted by a great\r\nnation in practice.\r\n\r\nThere are yet, even at this day, many speculative objections to this\r\ntheory. Even in our own country there are still philosophers who deny\r\nthe principles asserted in the Declaration, as self-evident truths--who\r\ndeny the natural equality and inalienable rights of man--who deny that\r\nthe people are the only legitimate source of power--who deny that all\r\njust powers of government are derived from the consent of the governed.\r\nNeither your time, nor perhaps the cheerful nature of this occasion,\r\npermit me here to enter upon the examination of this anti-revolutionary\r\ntheory, which arrays State sovereignty against the constituent\r\nsovereignty of the people, and distorts the Constitution of the United\r\nStates into a league of friendship between confederate corporations. I\r\nspeak to matters of fact. There is the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand there is the Constitution of the United States--let them speak for\r\nthemselves. The grossly immoral and dishonest doctrine of despotic State\r\nsovereignty, the exclusive judge of its own obligations, and responsible\r\nto no power on earth or in heaven, for the violation of them, is not\r\nthere. The Declaration says, it is not in me. The Constitution says, it\r\nis not in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oration at Plymouth, December 22, 1802, in Commemoration of the Landing\r\nof the Pilgrims.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the sentiments of most powerful operation upon the human\r\nheart, and most highly honorable to the human character, are those of\r\nveneration for our forefathers, and of love for our posterity. They form\r\nthe connecting links between the selfish and the social passions. By the\r\nfundamental principle of Christianity, the happiness of the individual\r\nis interwoven, by innumerable and imperceptible ties, with that of his\r\ncontemporaries. By the power of filial reverence and parental affection,\r\nindividual existence is extended beyond the limits of individual life,\r\nand the happiness of every age is chained in mutual dependence upon that\r\nof every other. Respect for his ancestors excites, in the breast of man,\r\ninterest in their history, attachment to their characters, concern for\r\ntheir errors, involuntary pride in their virtues. Love for his posterity\r\nspurs him to exertion for their support, stimulates him to virtue for\r\ntheir example, and fills him with the tenderest solicitude for their\r\nwelfare. Man, therefore, was not made for himself alone. No, he was made\r\nfor his country, by the obligations of the social compact; he was made\r\nfor his species, by the Christian duties of universal charity; he\r\nwas made for all ages past, by the sentiment of reverence for his\r\nforefathers; and he was made for all future times, by the impulse of\r\naffection for his progeny. Under the influence of these principles,\r\n\r\n     \"Existence sees him spurn her bounded reign.\"\r\n\r\nThey redeem his nature from the subjection of time and space; he is\r\nno longer a \"puny insect shivering at a breeze\"; he is the glory of\r\ncreation, formed to occupy all time and all extent; bounded, during his\r\nresidence upon earth, only to the boundaries of the world, and destined\r\nto life and immortality in brighter regions, when the fabric of nature\r\nitself shall dissolve and perish.\r\n\r\nThe voice of history has not, in all its compass, a note but answers in\r\nunison with these sentiments. The barbarian chieftain, who defended his\r\ncountry against the Roman invasion, driven to the remotest extremity of\r\nBritain, and stimulating his followers to battle by all that has power\r\nof persuasion upon the human heart, concluded his persuasion by an\r\nappeal to these irresistible feelings: \"Think of your forefathers and of\r\nyour posterity.\" The Romans themselves, at the pinnacle of civilization,\r\nwere actuated by the same impressions, and celebrated, in anniversary\r\nfestivals, every great event which had signalized the annals of their\r\nforefathers. To multiply instances where it were impossible to adduce\r\nan exception would be to waste your time and abuse your patience; but\r\nin the sacred volume, which contains the substances of our firmest faith\r\nand of our most precious hopes, these passions not only maintain their\r\nhighest efficacy, but are sanctioned by the express injunctions of the\r\nDivine Legislator to his chosen people.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions of time furnish no previous example of a nation shooting\r\nup to maturity and expanding into greatness with the rapidity which has\r\ncharacterized the growth of the American people. In the luxuriance of\r\nyouth, and in the vigor of manhood, it is pleasing and instructive to\r\nlook backward upon the helpless days of infancy; but in the continual\r\nand essential changes of a growing subject, the transactions of that\r\nearly period would be soon obliterated from the memory but for some\r\nperiodical call of attention to aid the silent records of the historian.\r\nSuch celebrations arouse and gratify the kindliest emotions of the\r\nbosom. They are faithful pledges of the respect we bear to the memory\r\nof our ancestors and of the tenderness with which we cherish the rising\r\ngeneration. They introduce the sages and heroes of ages past to the\r\nnotice and emulation of succeeding times; they are at once testimonials\r\nof our gratitude, and schools of virtue to our children.\r\n\r\nThese sentiments are wise; they are honorable; they are virtuous; their\r\ncultivation is not merely innocent pleasure, it is incumbent duty.\r\nObedient to their dictates, you, my fellow-citizens, have instituted\r\nand paid frequent observance to this annual solemnity, and what event of\r\nweightier intrinsic importance, or of more extensive consequences, was\r\never selected for this honorary distinction?\r\n\r\nIn reverting to the period of our origin, other nations have generally\r\nbeen compelled to plunge into the chaos of impenetrable antiquity, or to\r\ntrace a lawless ancestry into the caverns of ravishers and robbers.\r\nIt is your peculiar privilege to commemorate, in this birthday of your\r\nnation, an event ascertained in its minutest details; an event of which\r\nthe principal actors are known to you familiarly, as if belonging to\r\nyour own age; an event of a magnitude before which imagination shrinks\r\nat the imperfection of her powers. It is your further happiness to\r\nbehold, in those eminent characters, who were most conspicuous in\r\naccomplishing the settlement of your country, men upon whose virtue\r\nyou can dwell with honest exultation. The founders of your race are\r\nnot handed down to you, like the fathers of the Roman people, as the\r\nsucklings of a wolf. You are not descended from a nauseous compound of\r\nfanaticism and sensuality, whose only argument was the sword, and whose\r\nonly paradise was a brothel. No Gothic scourge of God, no Vandal pest of\r\nnations, no fabled fugitive from the flames of Troy, no bastard Norman\r\ntyrant, appears among the list of worthies who first landed on the\r\nrock, which your veneration has preserved as a lasting monument of\r\ntheir achievement. The great actors of the day we now solemnize were\r\nillustrious by their intrepid valor no less than by their Christian\r\ngraces, but the clarion of conquest has not blazoned forth their names\r\nto all the winds of heaven. Their glory has not been wafted over oceans\r\nof blood to the remotest regions of the earth. They have not erected to\r\nthemselves colossal statues upon pedestals of human bones, to provoke\r\nand insult the tardy hand of heavenly retribution. But theirs was \"the\r\nbetter fortitude of patience and heroic martyrdom.\" Theirs was the\r\ngentle temper of Christian kindness; the rigorous observance of\r\nreciprocal justice; the unconquerable soul of conscious integrity.\r\nWorldly fame has been parsimonious of her favor to the memory of those\r\ngenerous companions. Their numbers were small; their stations in life\r\nobscure; the object of their enterprise unostentatious; the theatre of\r\ntheir exploits remote; how could they possibly be favorites of worldly\r\nFame--that common crier, whose existence is only known by the assemblage\r\nof multitudes; that pander of wealth and greatness, so eager to haunt\r\nthe palaces of fortune, and so fastidious to the houseless dignity of\r\nvirtue; that parasite of pride, ever scornful to meekness, and ever\r\nobsequious to insolent power; that heedless trumpeter, whose ears are\r\ndeaf to modest merit, and whose eyes are blind to bloodless, distant\r\nexcellence?\r\n\r\nWhen the persecuted companions of Robinson, exiles from their native\r\nland, anxiously sued for the privilege of removing a thousand leagues\r\nmore distant to an untried soil, a rigorous climate, and a savage\r\nwilderness, for the sake of reconciling their sense of religious duty\r\nwith their affections for their country, few, perhaps none of them,\r\nformed a conception of what would be, within two centuries, the result\r\nof their undertaking. When the jealous and niggardly policy of their\r\nBritish sovereign denied them even that humblest of requests, and\r\ninstead of liberty would barely consent to promise connivance, neither\r\nhe nor they might be aware that they were laying the foundations of a\r\npower, and that he was sowing the seeds of a spirit, which, in less\r\nthan two hundred years, would stagger the throne of his descendants, and\r\nshake his united kingdoms to the centre. So far is it from the ordinary\r\nhabits of mankind to calculate the importance of events in their\r\nelementary principles, that had the first colonists of our country ever\r\nintimated as a part of their designs the project of founding a great and\r\nmighty nation, the finger of scorn would have pointed them to the cells\r\nof Bedlam as an abode more suitable for hatching vain empires than the\r\nsolitude of a transatlantic desert.\r\n\r\nThese consequences, then so little foreseen, have unfolded themselves,\r\nin all their grandeur, to the eyes of the present age. It is a common\r\namusement of speculative minds to contrast the magnitude of the most\r\nimportant events with the minuteness of their primeval causes, and the\r\nrecords of mankind are full of examples for such contemplations. It\r\nis, however, a more profitable employment to trace the constituent\r\nprinciples of future greatness in their kernel; to detect in the acorn\r\nat our feet the germ of that majestic oak, whose roots shoot down to\r\nthe centre, and whose branches aspire to the skies. Let it be, then, our\r\npresent occupation to inquire and endeavor to ascertain the causes\r\nfirst put in operation at the period of our commemoration, and already\r\nproductive of such magnificent effects; to examine with reiterated care\r\nand minute attention the characters of those men who gave the first\r\nimpulse to a new series of events in the history of the world; to\r\napplaud and emulate those qualities of their minds which we shall find\r\ndeserving of our admiration; to recognize with candor those features\r\nwhich forbid approbation or even require censure, and, finally, to lay\r\nalike their frailties and their perfections to our own hearts, either as\r\nwarning or as example.\r\n\r\n\r\n Of the various European settlements upon this continent,\r\nwhich have finally merged in one independent nation, the first\r\nestablishments were made at various times, by several nations, and under\r\nthe influence of different motives. In many instances, the conviction\r\nof religious obligation formed one and a powerful inducement of the\r\nadventures; but in none, excepting the settlement at Plymouth, did they\r\nconstitute the sole and exclusive actuating cause. Worldly interest and\r\ncommercial speculation entered largely into the views of other settlers,\r\nbut the commands of conscience were the only stimulus to the emigrants\r\nfrom Leyden. Previous to their expedition hither, they had endured\r\na long banishment from their native country. Under every species of\r\ndiscouragement, they undertook the voyage; they performed it in spite\r\nof numerous and almost insuperable obstacles; they arrived upon a\r\nwilderness bound with frost and hoary with snow, without the boundaries\r\nof their charter, outcasts from all human society, and coasted five\r\nweeks together, in the dead of winter, on this tempestuous shore,\r\nexposed at once to the fury of the elements, to the arrows of the native\r\nsavage, and to the impending horrors of famine.\r\n\r\nCourage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which\r\ndifficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air. These qualities\r\nhave ever been displayed in their mightiest perfection, as attendants in\r\nthe retinue of strong passions. From the first discovery of the\r\nWestern Hemisphere by Columbus until the settlement of Virginia which\r\nimmediately preceded that of Plymouth, the various adventurers from the\r\nancient world had exhibited upon innumerable occasions that ardor of\r\nenterprise and that stubbornness of pursuit which set all danger at\r\ndefiance, and chained the violence of nature at their feet. But they\r\nwere all instigated by personal interests. Avarice and ambition had\r\ntuned their souls to that pitch of exaltation. Selfish passions were the\r\nparents of their heroism. It was reserved for the first settlers of\r\nnew England to perform achievements equally arduous, to trample down\r\nobstructions equally formidable, to dispel dangers equally terrific,\r\nunder the single inspiration of conscience. To them even liberty\r\nherself was but a subordinate and secondary consideration. They claimed\r\nexemption from the mandates of human authority, as militating with their\r\nsubjection to a superior power. Before the voice of Heaven they silenced\r\neven the calls of their country.\r\n\r\nYet, while so deeply impressed with the sense of religious obligation,\r\nthey felt, in all its energy, the force of that tender tie which binds\r\nthe heart of every virtuous man to his native land. It was to renew that\r\nconnection with their country which had been severed by their compulsory\r\nexpatriation, that they resolved to face all the hazards of a perilous\r\nnavigation and all the labors of a toilsome distant settlement. Under\r\nthe mild protection of the Batavian Government, they enjoyed already\r\nthat freedom of religious worship, for which they had resigned so\r\nmany comforts and enjoyments at home; but their hearts panted for a\r\nrestoration to the bosom of their country. Invited and urged by the\r\nopen-hearted and truly benevolent people who had given them an asylum\r\nfrom the persecution of their own kindred to form their settlement\r\nwithin the territories then under their jurisdiction, the love of their\r\ncountry predominated over every influence save that of conscience alone,\r\nand they preferred the precarious chance of relaxation from the bigoted\r\nrigor of the English Government to the certain liberality and alluring\r\noffers of the Hollanders. Observe, my countrymen, the generous\r\npatriotism, the cordial union of soul, the conscious yet unaffected\r\nvigor which beam in their application to the British monarch:\r\n\r\n\"They were well weaned from the delicate milk of their mother country,\r\nand inured to the difficulties of a strange land. They were knit\r\ntogether in a strict and sacred bond, to take care of the good of each\r\nother and of the whole. It was not with them as with other men, whom\r\nsmall things could discourage, or small discontents cause to wish\r\nthemselves again at home.\"\r\n\r\nChildren of these exalted Pilgrims! Is there one among you who can hear\r\nthe simple and pathetic energy of these expressions without tenderness\r\nand admiration? Venerated shades of our forefathers! No, ye were,\r\nindeed, not ordinary men! That country which had ejected you so cruelly\r\nfrom her bosom you still delighted to contemplate in the character of an\r\naffectionate and beloved mother. The sacred bond which knit you together\r\nwas indissoluble while you lived; and oh, may it be to your descendants\r\nthe example and the pledge of harmony to the latest period of time!\r\nThe difficulties and dangers, which so often had defeated attempts of\r\nsimilar establishments, were unable to subdue souls tempered like yours.\r\nYou heard the rigid interdictions; you saw the menacing forms of toil\r\nand danger, forbidding your access to this land of promise; but you\r\nheard without dismay; you saw and disdained retreat. Firm and undaunted\r\nin the confidence of that sacred bond; conscious of the purity, and\r\nconvinced of the importance of your motives, you put your trust in the\r\nprotecting shield of Providence, and smiled defiance at the combining\r\nterrors of human malice and of elemental strife. These, in the\r\naccomplishment of your undertaking, you were summoned to encounter\r\nin their most hideous forms; these you met with that fortitude, and\r\ncombated with that perseverance, which you had promised in their\r\nanticipation; these you completely vanquished in establishing the\r\nfoundations of New England, and the day which we now commemorate is the\r\nperpetual memorial of your triumph.\r\n\r\n It were an occupation peculiarly pleasing to cull from our\r\nearly historians, and exhibit before you every detail of this\r\ntransaction; to carry you in imagination on board their bark at the\r\nfirst moment of her arrival in the bay; to accompany Carver, Winslow,\r\nBradford, and Standish, in all their excursions upon the desolate coast;\r\nto follow them into every rivulet and creek where they endeavored to\r\nfind a firm footing, and to fix, with a pause of delight and exultation,\r\nthe instant when the first of these heroic adventurers alighted on the\r\nspot where you, their descendants, now enjoy the glorious and happy\r\nreward of their labors. But in this grateful task, your former orators,\r\non this anniversary, have anticipated all that the most ardent industry\r\ncould collect, and gratified all that the most inquisitive curiosity\r\ncould desire. To you, my friends, every occurrence of that momentous\r\nperiod is already familiar. A transient allusion to a few characteristic\r\ninstances, which mark the peculiar history of the Plymouth settlers, may\r\nproperly supply the place of a narrative, which, to this auditory, must\r\nbe superfluous.\r\n\r\nOne of these remarkable incidents is the execution of that instrument of\r\ngovernment by which they formed themselves into a body politic, the day\r\nafter their arrival upon the coast, and previous to their first landing.\r\nThat is, perhaps, the only instance in human history of that positive,\r\noriginal social compact, which speculative philosophers have imagined\r\nas the only legitimate source of government. Here was a unanimous\r\nand personal assent, by all the individuals of the community, to\r\nthe association by which they became a nation. It was the result of\r\ncircumstances and discussions which had occurred during their passage\r\nfrom Europe, and is a full demonstration that the nature of civil\r\ngovernment, abstracted from the political institutions of their native\r\ncountry, had been an object of their serious meditation. The settlers\r\nof all the former European colonies had contented themselves with the\r\npowers conferred upon them by their respective charters, without looking\r\nbeyond the seal of the royal parchment for the measure of their rights\r\nand the rule of their duties. The founders of Plymouth had been impelled\r\nby the peculiarities of their situation to examine the subject with\r\ndeeper and more comprehensive research. After twelve years of banishment\r\nfrom the land of their first allegiance, during which they had been\r\nunder an adoptive and temporary subjection to another sovereign, they\r\nmust naturally have been led to reflect upon the relative rights and\r\nduties of allegiance and subjection. They had resided in a city, the\r\nseat of a university, where the polemical and political controversies\r\nof the time were pursued with uncommon fervor. In this period they had\r\nwitnessed the deadly struggle between the two parties, into which the\r\npeople of the United Provinces, after their separation from the crown of\r\nSpain, had divided themselves. The contest embraced within its compass\r\nnot only theological doctrines, but political principles, and Maurice\r\nand Barnevelt were the temporal leaders of the same rival factions, of\r\nwhich Episcopius and Polyander were the ecclesiastical champions.\r\n\r\nThat the investigation of the fundamental principles of government was\r\ndeeply implicated in these dissensions is evident from the immortal\r\nwork of Grotius, upon the rights of war and peace, which undoubtedly\r\noriginated from them. Grotius himself had been a most distinguished\r\nactor and sufferer in those important scenes of internal convulsion,\r\nand his work was first published very shortly after the departure of\r\nour forefathers from Leyden. It is well known that in the course of the\r\ncontest Mr. Robinson more than once appeared, with credit to himself, as\r\na public disputant against Episcopius; and from the manner in which\r\nthe fact is related by Governor Bradford, it is apparent that the whole\r\nEnglish Church at Leyden took a zealous interest in the religious part\r\nof the controversy. As strangers in the land, it is presumable that\r\nthey wisely and honorably avoided entangling themselves in the political\r\ncontentions involved with it. Yet the theoretic principles, as they were\r\ndrawn into discussion, could not fail to arrest their attention, and\r\nmust have assisted them to form accurate ideas concerning the origin and\r\nextent of authority among men, independent of positive institutions.\r\nThe importance of these circumstances will not be duly weighed without\r\ntaking into consideration the state of opinion then prevalent in\r\nEngland. The general principles of government were there little\r\nunderstood and less examined. The whole substance of human authority was\r\ncentred in the simple doctrine of royal prerogative, the origin of which\r\nwas always traced in theory to divine institution. Twenty years later,\r\nthe subject was more industriously sifted, and for half a century became\r\none of the principal topics of controversy between the ablest and most\r\nenlightened men in the nation. The instrument of voluntary association\r\nexecuted on board the \"Mayflower\" testifies that the parties to it had\r\nanticipated the improvement of their nation.\r\n\r\nAnother incident, from which we may derive occasion for important\r\nreflections, was the attempt of these original settlers to establish\r\namong them that community of goods and of labor, which fanciful\r\npoliticians, from the days of Plato to those of Rousseau, have\r\nrecommended as the fundamental law of a perfect republic. This theory\r\nresults, it must be acknowledged, from principles of reasoning\r\nmost flattering to the human character. If industry, frugality, and\r\ndisinterested integrity were alike the virtues of all, there would,\r\napparently, be more of the social spirit, in making all property a\r\ncommon stock, and giving to each individual a proportional title to the\r\nwealth of the whole. Such is the basis upon which Plato forbids, in\r\nhis Republic, the division of property. Such is the system upon which\r\nRousseau pronounces the first man who inclosed a field with a fence, and\r\nsaid, \"This is mine,\" a traitor to the human species. A wiser and more\r\nuseful philosophy, however, directs us to consider man according to the\r\nnature in which he was formed; subject to infirmities, which no wisdom\r\ncan remedy; to weaknesses, which no institution can strengthen; to\r\nvices, which no legislation can correct. Hence, it becomes obvious that\r\nseparate property is the natural and indisputable right of separate\r\nexertion; that community of goods without community of toil is\r\noppressive and unjust; that it counteracts the laws of nature, which\r\nprescribe that he only who sows the seed shall reap the harvest; that\r\nit discourages all energy, by destroying its rewards; and makes the most\r\nvirtuous and active members of society the slaves and drudges of the\r\nworst. Such was the issue of this experiment among our forefathers,\r\nand the same event demonstrated the error of the system in the elder\r\nsettlement of Virginia. Let us cherish that spirit of harmony which\r\nprompted our forefathers to make the attempt, under circumstances more\r\nfavorable to its success than, perhaps, ever occurred upon earth. Let\r\nus no less admire the candor with which they relinquished it, upon\r\ndiscovering its irremediable inefficacy. To found principles of\r\ngovernment upon too advantageous an estimate of the human character is\r\nan error of inexperience, the source of which is so amiable that it is\r\nimpossible to censure it with severity. We have seen the same mistake\r\ncommitted in our own age, and upon a larger theatre. Happily for our\r\nancestors, their situation allowed them to repair it before its effects\r\nhad proved destructive. They had no pride of vain philosophy to support,\r\nno perfidious rage of faction to glut, by persevering in their mistakes\r\nuntil they should be extinguished in torrents of blood.\r\n\r\nAs the attempt to establish among themselves the community of goods was\r\na seal of that sacred bond which knit them so closely together, so the\r\nconduct they observed toward the natives of the country displays\r\ntheir steadfast adherence to the rules of justice and their faithful\r\nattachment to those of benevolence and charity.\r\n\r\nNo European settlement ever formed upon this continent has been more\r\ndistinguished for undeviating kindness and equity toward the savages.\r\nThere are, indeed, moralists who have questioned the right of the\r\nEuropeans to intrude upon the possessions of the aboriginals in any\r\ncase, and under any limitations whatsoever. But have they maturely\r\nconsidered the whole subject? The Indian right of possession itself\r\nstands, with regard to the greater part of the country, upon a\r\nquestionable foundation. Their cultivated fields; their constructed\r\nhabitations; a space of ample sufficiency for their subsistence,\r\nand whatever they had annexed to themselves by personal labor, was\r\nundoubtedly, by the laws of nature, theirs. But what is the right of\r\na huntsman to the forest of a thousand miles over which he has\r\naccidentally ranged in quest of prey? Shall the liberal bounties of\r\nProvidence to the race of man be monopolized by one of ten thousand for\r\nwhom they were created? Shall the exuberant bosom of the common mother,\r\namply adequate to the nourishment of millions, be claimed exclusively\r\nby a few hundreds of her offspring? Shall the lordly savage not only\r\ndisdain the virtues and enjoyments of civilization himself, but shall he\r\ncontrol the civilization of a world? Shall he forbid the wilderness\r\nto blossom like a rose? Shall he forbid the oaks of the forest to fall\r\nbefore the axe of industry, and to rise again, transformed into the\r\nhabitations of ease and elegance? shall he doom an immense region of the\r\nglobe to perpetual desolation, and to hear the howlings of the tiger and\r\nthe wolf silence forever the voice of human gladness? Shall the fields\r\nand the valleys, which a beneficent God has formed to teem with the life\r\nof innumerable multitudes, be condemned to everlasting barrenness? Shall\r\nthe mighty rivers, poured out by the hand of nature, as channels of\r\ncommunication between numerous nations, roll their waters in sullen\r\nsilence and eternal solitude of the deep? Have hundreds of commodious\r\nharbors, a thousand leagues of coast, and a boundless ocean, been spread\r\nin the front of this land, and shall every purpose of utility to which\r\nthey could apply be prohibited by the tenant of the woods? No, generous\r\nphilanthropists! Heaven has not been thus inconsistent in the works of\r\nits hands. Heaven has not thus placed at irreconcilable strife its moral\r\nlaws with its physical creation. The Pilgrims of Plymouth obtained their\r\nright of possession to the territory on which they settled, by titles\r\nas fair and unequivocal as any human property can be held. By their\r\nvoluntary association they recognized their allegiance to the government\r\nof Britain, and in process of time received whatever powers and\r\nauthorities could be conferred upon them by a charter from their\r\nsovereign. The spot on which they fixed had belonged to an Indian tribe,\r\ntotally extirpated by that devouring pestilence which had swept the\r\ncountry shortly before their arrival. The territory, thus free from\r\nall exclusive possession, they might have taken by the natural right\r\nof occupancy. Desirous, however, of giving amply satisfaction to every\r\npretence of prior right, by formal and solemn conventions with the\r\nchiefs of the neighboring tribes, they acquired the further security of\r\na purchase. At their hands the children of the desert had no cause\r\nof complaint. On the great day of retribution, what thousands, what\r\nmillions of the American race will appear at the bar of judgment to\r\narraign their European invading conquerors! Let us humbly hope that\r\nthe fathers of the Plymouth Colony will then appear in the whiteness of\r\ninnocence. Let us indulge in the belief that they will not only be free\r\nfrom all accusation of injustice to these unfortunate sons of nature,\r\nbut that the testimonials of their acts of kindness and benevolence\r\ntoward them will plead the cause of their virtues, as they are now\r\nauthenticated by the record of history upon earth.\r\n\r\nReligious discord has lost her sting; the cumbrous weapons of\r\ntheological warfare are antiquated; the field of politics supplies the\r\nalchemists of our times with materials of more fatal explosion, and the\r\nbutchers of mankind no longer travel to another world for instruments\r\nof cruelty and destruction. Our age is too enlightened to contend upon\r\ntopics which concern only the interests of eternity; the men who hold in\r\nproper contempt all controversies about trifles, except such as inflame\r\ntheir own passions, have made it a commonplace censure against your\r\nancestors, that their zeal was enkindled by subjects of trivial\r\nimportance; and that however aggrieved by the intolerance of others,\r\nthey were alike intolerant themselves. Against these objections, your\r\ncandid judgment will not require an unqualified justification; but your\r\nrespect and gratitude for the founders of the State may boldly claim an\r\nample apology. The original grounds of their separation from the Church\r\nof England were not objects of a magnitude to dissolve the bonds of\r\ncommunion, much less those of charity, between Christian brethren of\r\nthe same essential principles. Some of them, however, were not\r\ninconsiderable, and numerous inducements concurred to give them an\r\nextraordinary interest in their eyes. When that portentous system of\r\nabuses, the Papal dominion, was overturned, a great variety of religious\r\nsects arose in its stead in the several countries, which for many\r\ncenturies before had been screwed beneath its subjection. The fabric of\r\nthe Reformation, first undertaken in England upon a contracted basis, by\r\na capricious and sanguinary tyrant, had been successively overthrown\r\nand restored, renewed and altered, according to the varying humors and\r\nprinciples of four successive monarchs. To ascertain the precise point\r\nof division between the genuine institutions of Christianity and the\r\ncorruptions accumulated upon them in the progress of fifteen centuries,\r\nwas found a task of extreme difficulty throughout the Christian world.\r\n\r\nMen of the profoundest learning, of the sublimest genius, and of the\r\npurest integrity, after devoting their lives to the research, finally\r\ndiffered in their ideas upon many great points, both of doctrine and\r\ndiscipline. The main question, it was admitted on all hands, most\r\nintimately concerned the highest interests of man, both temporal and\r\neternal. Can we wonder that men who felt their happiness here and their\r\nhopes of hereafter, their worldly welfare and the kingdom of heaven\r\nat stake, should sometimes attach an importance beyond their intrinsic\r\nweight to collateral points of controversy, connected with the\r\nall-involving object of the Reformation? The changes in the forms and\r\nprinciples of religious worship were introduced and regulated in England\r\nby the hand of public authority. But that hand had not been uniform\r\nor steady in its operations. During the persecutions inflicted in the\r\ninterval of Popish restoration under the reign of Mary, upon all who\r\nfavored the Reformation, many of the most zealous reformers had been\r\ncompelled to fly their country. While residing on the continent of\r\nEurope, they had adopted the principles of the most complete and\r\nrigorous reformation, as taught and established by Calvin. On returning\r\nafterward to their native country, they were dissatisfied with\r\nthe partial reformation, at which, as they conceived, the English\r\nestablishment had rested; and claiming the privilege of private\r\nconscience, upon which alone any departure from the Church of Rome could\r\nbe justified, they insisted upon the right of adhering to the system of\r\ntheir own preference, and, of course, upon that of non-conformity to the\r\nestablishment prescribed by the royal authority. The only means used\r\nto convince them of error and reclaim them from dissent was force, and\r\nforce served but to confirm the opposition it was meant to suppress. By\r\ndriving the founders of the Plymouth Colony into exile, it constrained\r\nthem to absolute separation irreconcilable. Viewing their religious\r\nliberties here, as held only by sufferance, yet bound to them by all\r\nthe ties of conviction, and by all their sufferings for them, could they\r\nforbear to look upon every dissenter among themselves with a jealous\r\neye? Within two years after their landing, they beheld a rival\r\nsettlement attempted in their immediate neighborhood; and not long\r\nafter, the laws of self-preservation compelled them to break up a nest\r\nof revellers, who boasted of protection from the mother country, and who\r\nhad recurred to the easy but pernicious resource of feeding their wanton\r\nidleness, by furnishing the savages with the means, the skill, and the\r\ninstruments of European destruction. Toleration, in that instance, would\r\nhave been self-murder, and many other examples might be alleged, in\r\nwhich their necessary measures of self-defence have been exaggerated\r\ninto cruelty, and their most indispensable precautions distorted into\r\npersecution. Yet shall we not pretend that they were exempt from the\r\ncommon laws of mortality, or entirely free from all the errors of\r\ntheir age. Their zeal might sometimes be too ardent, but it was always\r\nsincere. At this day, religious indulgence is one of our clearest\r\nduties, because it is one of our undisputed rights. While we rejoice\r\nthat the principles of genuine Christianity have so far triumphed over\r\nthe prejudices of a former generation, let us fervently hope for the day\r\nwhen it will prove equally victorious over the malignant passions of our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nIn thus calling your attention to some of the peculiar features in the\r\nprinciples, the character, and the history of our forefathers, it is\r\nas wide from my design, as I know it would be from your approbation, to\r\nadorn their memory with a chaplet plucked from the domain of others.\r\nThe occasion and the day are more peculiarly devoted to them, and let\r\nit never be dishonored with a contracted and exclusive spirit. Our\r\naffections as citizens embrace the whole extent of the Union, and the\r\nnames of Raleigh, Smith, Winthrop, Calvert, Penn and Oglethorpe excite\r\nin our minds recollections equally pleasing and gratitude equally\r\nfervent with those of Carver and Bradford. Two centuries have not\r\nyet elapsed since the first European foot touched the soil which now\r\nconstitutes the American Union. Two centuries more and our numbers must\r\nexceed those of Europe itself. The destinies of their empire, as they\r\nappear in prospect before us, disdain the powers of human calculation.\r\nYet, as the original founder of the Roman State is said once to have\r\nlifted upon his shoulders the fame and fortunes of all his posterity, so\r\nlet us never forget that the glory and greatness of all our descendants\r\nis in our hands. Preserve in all their purity, refine, if possible,\r\nfrom all their alloy, those virtues which we this day commemorate as the\r\nornament of our forefathers. Adhere to them with inflexible resolution,\r\nas to the horns of the altar; instil them with unwearied perseverance\r\ninto the minds of your children; bind your souls and theirs to the\r\nnational Union as the chords of life are centred in the heart, and you\r\nshall soar with rapid and steady wing to the summit of human glory.\r\nNearly a century ago, one of those rare minds to whom it is given to\r\ndiscern future greatness in its seminal principles, upon contemplating\r\nthe situation of this continent, pronounced, in a vein of poetic\r\ninspiration, \"Westward the star of empire takes its way.\" Let us unite\r\nin ardent supplication to the Founder of nations and the Builder\r\nof worlds, that what then was prophecy may continue unfolding\r\ninto history--that the dearest hopes of the human race may not be\r\nextinguished in disappointment, and that the last may prove the noblest\r\nempire of time.",
