A wealth of material relating to the complex life of\r\nmodern Indians and their affairs was offered. The comparisons between\r\ntribes of today and a century ago present an absorbing field for study.\r\nI have frequently with difficulty checked myself, as it was more easy\r\nand pleasant to speak of the past rather than of modern days.\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively simple to record existing Indian customs still\r\nsurviving in out-of-the-way corners of the United States. But such do\r\nnot represent the present cultural state of the Indian as a whole. As my\r\nbook aimed at a correct perspective of the Indians today, the inclusion\r\nof such matter and the exclusion of the widespread Indian activities in\r\nother directions, might result in a distorted perspective—certainly the\r\npicture (while more pleasing) would not be true to life. It will be\r\nobserved by readers, that while I have generally described the\r\nactivities of modern Indians, that the real purpose of the book is to\r\nbring before the American public the acuteness of the Indian problem,\r\nand to suggest certain recommendations.\r\n\r\nA perusal of the following chapters will acquaint readers with all the\r\nfacts—how that the Indian has been hurried into citizenship. We have\r\nchanged his entire life within the space of a few generations and forced\r\nupon him serious problems. In fact, we have brought about so stupendous\r\na change in his life, that his very existence is threatened. As will be\r\nindicated, much of the old life obtains in spite of all our civilizing\r\ninfluences. While this is true, the preponderance of evidence indicates\r\nthat the greater majority of our Indians have passed into the\r\ntransitional state. Whether they shall become upright, self-supporting,\r\nintelligent American citizens, depends upon our attitude rather than\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nSince we have brought about the extinction of tribal and communistic\r\nlife among the Indians, absolute responsibility for the future of the\r\nIndian rests with us. In the olden days, under the general tribal life,\r\nthe Indians were able to band together and protect themselves. Now that\r\nmost of our reservations have been cut up, and the Indians placed upon\r\nindividual farms, it is impossible for them to join in any movement for\r\nself-protection. They are now citizens, rather than members of a tribe.\r\nHence, it is quite easy for unscrupulous white persons to take advantage\r\nof them. While we thought we were acting in the best interests of the\r\nIndian, what we really did, was to destroy natural barriers which\r\nformerly kept out the enemy.\r\n\r\nOne should not object to, or find fault with an established policy,\r\nunless one offered a constructive policy in the place of that which he\r\nsought to destroy. I have, therefore, pointed out in my Conclusions\r\nwhat, in my opinion, must be done would we save the Indian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     INDIAN ART AND OLD INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nThe arts and industries of the Indians (barring a few exceptions) have\r\nbeen modified by contact with the Whites. As an illustration, the\r\nbeadwork of the Ojibwa, Malecite, Penobscot, Iroquois and others is very\r\ndifferent from the art of two centuries ago. Basketry still obtains, but\r\nexcept on the Pacific coast and in the Southwest, much of the textile\r\nwork is influenced by European culture, and I have therefore omitted a\r\nconsideration of Indian art in general.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the Navaho there was reference to the extensive\r\nblanket industry of that people. There is no danger of the blanket\r\nindustry becoming extinct, although it may deteriorate because certain\r\nwell-meaning, but misguided persons desire to superintend the Navaho\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThe basketry is threatened with extinction. The manufacture of beadwork,\r\nmoccasins and Indian garments continues in various sections of the\r\ncountry, but has become modernized in design and manufacture. With the\r\nscarcity of deer, elk and buffalo, substitutes are now employed. This is\r\nobserved in so common an article as moccasins—which are far inferior to\r\nthose in use fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen Honorable R. G. Valentine was Commissioner, I made a somewhat\r\nlengthy report on the possibilities of aboriginal art, or manufacture,\r\nas a commercial asset to the Indians. I recommended that the old basket\r\nand blanket weavers, and the few remaining Indians who are skilled in\r\nmaking bead designs, moccasins, and other articles, be encouraged in\r\ntheir native arts. I recommended to the Commissioner that he establish a\r\nBureau of Arts and Industries somewhat different from that one\r\nmaintained at the present time. That the older men and women should be\r\nencouraged to make their baskets and blankets as in olden days, and that\r\nthese should be marketed through certain agencies and the profits accrue\r\nto the Indians. I took the position that it was useless to attempt to\r\ninstruct young Indians in the arts of their parents. That these persons\r\nwere properly instructed in the great Indian schools, but that the true\r\nexpression of aboriginal art was found among the few, old, self-taught\r\npersons. Art cannot be superintended, and if we continue such a course\r\nwe will destroy what remains and have in its place that which is the\r\nopposite of true art. Our attempt to “teach” the Indians music ended in\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Office should encourage the old art-workers to make their\r\nproducts in their own way with absolutely no supervision upon our part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A PROPHECY VERIFIED\r\n\r\nEvents have moved rapidly of late, and as the Introduction proofs come\r\nback from my publishers, the press dispatches from Washington announce\r\nthe appointment of Honorable Gabe E. Parker as Commissioner to the Five\r\nCivilized Tribes in Oklahoma. Mr. Parker is one of the brightest of our\r\neducated Indians. Miss Barnard has just informed me that her successor\r\nin the Department of Charities and Corrections has been named. With\r\nthese changes, Mr. Mott’s remarkable prophecy of last February (_See p.\r\n163_) is with one exception, completely verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nThere are many persons, and a number of governmental Departments, to\r\nwhom I am especially indebted. When I began the preparation of this\r\nmanuscript nearly a year ago, I explained to officials in the United\r\nStates Indian Office, Department of Justice, Smithsonian Institution,\r\nIndian Rights Association, and other organizations that I intended to\r\nprepare a history of the Indian of the transition period. It was made\r\nclear that a history must contain both the good and the bad; that a mere\r\ndescription of school activities and progress in arts and industries,\r\nwould result in confirming the public in the present erroneous, but\r\nwidespread opinion, that all our Indians are properly cared for,\r\nprotected, and really becoming self-supporting.\r\n\r\nGreat credit must be given to various officials and private citizens for\r\ntheir earnest cooperation. The subject was a delicate one for them to\r\nhandle. Taking everything into consideration, I have clearly indicated\r\nthat the present unsatisfactory condition of our Indians grew up through\r\na gradual process of evolution. We must not select the administration of\r\nMr. Morgan, or that of Messrs. Leupp and Valentine, or the present one,\r\nunder Mr. Sells, and state—“It was under this regime that the Indian\r\nbegan to lose his property.” Beginning fifty years ago, the evolution\r\nproceeded regularly, but irresistibly, until it terminated in the\r\nbureaucracy of present times. No particular administration, and no group\r\nof men are to blame.\r\n\r\nHonorable Cato Sells, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and Honorable E.\r\nB. Meritt, Assistant Commissioner, both instructed under-officials to\r\nafford me every possible courtesy in the preparation of this book, and I\r\nam greatly indebted to both of them.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Rodman Wanamaker and Dr. Joseph K. Dixon, I express thanks for\r\nthe permission to reproduce photogravure plates illustrating the Indian\r\nof fifty years ago. Messrs. Doubleday Page & Co., publishers of Dr.\r\nDixon’s book, “The Vanishing Race”, were good enough to make the\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nMr. George Wharton James and his publishers, A. C. McClurg & Co.,\r\npermitted me to reproduce a fine, colored Navaho blanket and an\r\nillustration of a weaver, from “Indian Blankets and Their Makers”. Mr.\r\nJ. Weston Allen of Boston also rendered me valuable assistance. The\r\nCarlisle School, Haskell Institute, and the United States Indian School,\r\nChilocco, furnished information regarding their work, loaned me several\r\nplates and sent photographs. I have thanked the Superintendents in the\r\nlist on this and the next page.\r\n\r\nMr. C. E. Kelsey of California; Mr. Grant Foreman of Oklahoma; Capt. G.\r\nW. Grayson of Oklahoma, and L. V. McWhorter of Washington, have my\r\nspecial thanks for contributing pages to this book. I also am indebted\r\nto Hon. F. H. Abbott, Secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners,\r\nfor information; Mr. M. K. Sniffen for Alaskan notes, and Miss Kate\r\nBarnard, Mr. M. L. Mott and H. C. Phillips for suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above I am indebted to many other persons, all of\r\nwhom contributed more or less information. The list of these follows:\r\n\r\nMiss Caroline W.

Aside from reports emanating from officials and\r\nDepartments, the largest body of literature is that dealing with the\r\nethnology of existing tribes. Under the term ethnology would be included\r\nseveral divisions of the science. Most of the ethnologic works, reports\r\nand papers fall within no specified dates. Hence, a paper may cover one\r\nor two centuries, or it might be confined to some aboriginal activity in\r\nmodern times. To compile a bibliography restricted to governmental\r\nreports, books by individuals, addresses, special articles, etc.,\r\nconcerning the administration of Indian affairs, and omitting scientific\r\nbooks and papers, is unsatisfactory and quite incomplete. I therefore\r\nomitted a general bibliography, although I cite some 150 books, reports\r\nand addresses. To readers who may desire to pursue the subject further,\r\nI would suggest that in addition to the Handbook of American Indians,\r\nthere are the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and Bureau of\r\nEthnology, Washington. A large number of reports have been issued by\r\nthese scientific institutions the past forty years, and they cover\r\npractically all activities of many of our Indian tribes. The American\r\nAnthropologist (1888–1914) will be found to contain valuable papers upon\r\nthe language, folk-lore, religion, philology and general ethnology of\r\nmodern tribes. The Handbook of American Indians contains a bibliography\r\nof more than forty-two pages in length.\r\n\r\nIndian songs and music are presented in a large volume in a most\r\nattractive manner by Miss Nathalie Curtis. Basketry and blankets are\r\ndescribed by Professor Mason and Mr. G. W. James. Dr. Charles A.\r\nEastman’s books of Indian life are excellent—and there are many others.\r\nThese in addition to the Smithsonian, Bureau of Ethnology, Handbook, and\r\nAnthropologist cited, will afford readers an abundance of material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CORRECTIONS\r\n\r\nAfter [Chapters I-XXX] had been printed, Commissioner Sells notified me\r\nthat through a typographical error on [page 27], the 600,000 acres of\r\nirrigable lands had become 6,000,000! It would be exceedingly gratifying\r\ncould we claim that the Indians had under cultivation 6,000,000 acres,\r\nbut as the sum total is but 600,000, I cite the correction.\r\n\r\nOn [page 25], last paragraph, fourth line, “under the Chiefs of\r\nDivisions”; should be, “in the various Divisions”.\r\n\r\n[Page 112], second paragraph from bottom, fifth line: “witnessed many of\r\nthese dances”, should be “witnessed many different dances”.\r\n\r\n[Page 217]. It was necessary to omit a special chapter devoted to\r\nagriculture for the reason that in various places in the book the\r\nindustries of modern Indians were commented on at length. In [Chapter\r\nXXXIII], Farming and Stock Raising, it was thought best to omit the\r\nbibliography. Therefore, the last sentence in the paragraph should read,\r\n“These cover, in a general way, all phases of education.”\r\n\r\n[Page 247]. Last paragraph. “John T. Shelton” should be, “William T.\r\nShelton”.\r\n\r\n[Page 252], center of page: Parquette, should be Paquette.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  A bibliography of these will be found in “The Stone Age in North\r\n  America.” Vol. II, pages 408–410.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHAPTER I. TWO POINTS OF VIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Indian may be regarded from two wide and divergent points\r\nof view; that of the scientist, and that of the humanitarian. Under the\r\nformer should be grouped all study of the Indian, past and present,\r\nfalling under the general science of anthropology, and its various\r\ndivisions and sub-divisions. This includes the study of the Indian as a\r\nprimitive man belonging to the Red Race, and different from all other\r\nraces on the face of the earth. This view comprises archaeology,\r\nphysical anthropology, ethnology, folklore, religion, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second, under the general title of humanitarianism, includes all\r\nprogress, education, missionary endeavor, and that which may be summed\r\nup under the title Civilization, or as the modernists have it, “Social\r\nService.”\r\n\r\nAfter much thought, it occurs to me that we must view the Indian from\r\nthese two and quite opposed angles—the scientific, the philanthropic.\r\n\r\nThe average man or woman is not interested in the Indian from the point\r\nof view of the scientist. This is quite natural. But, persons of\r\nintelligence are interested in the Indian as a strange and peculiar\r\nindividual. He appeals to their imagination. The public has had\r\npresented to it during past years, great numbers of books, pamphlets and\r\narticles all dealing with the Indian, and most of them regard him from\r\nwhat is known as “the popular point of view.” Having read, or glanced\r\nthrough scores of these, it is my firm conviction that, after all, we\r\nhave not properly understood the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe scientists have made him the subject of technical study, beginning\r\nwith the generalities of two centuries ago and continuing down to the\r\nminutest of detail of modern investigations. Through our records of\r\nwars, and our sensational articles, we have been given the impression\r\nthat his days were spent in fighting, and his nights in war dances. To\r\nthe scientist he has appeared, not as a man, but as a bit of life to be\r\ndissected and preserved; or a specimen duly catalogued, described, and\r\nplaced in an exhibition case. To the average man or woman, influenced by\r\nsensational books, and degrading wild-west shows, and that modern\r\ninvention, the motion picture, he presents a figure as unreal as it is\r\nunhuman.\r\n\r\nThe Indian of today, with few exceptions, having lost his aboriginal\r\ncharacteristics, the faith of his fathers and his whole life changed, is\r\nindeed, a fit subject for the educator, the philanthropist, and the\r\nsocial reformer.\r\n\r\nWould one desire to understand this very peculiar race of red men, one\r\nshould begin his study by observing the Indian of today. And his\r\nobservation should cover the character, activities and condition of this\r\nIndian of modern times. He should regard him not merely through the\r\ncold, unsympathetic eyes of the scientist, who looks for survival of\r\nsavage or primitive customs, but in a larger and broader sense. To begin\r\nwith, everyone should realize that the survivors of the American race[2]\r\nare more in need today of protection and help than of scientific study.\r\nFrom a purely scientific point of view, the Indian has been pretty\r\nthoroughly studied the past fifty years. This statement of mine does not\r\nnecessarily imply that there should be no technical study of the\r\nAmerican Indian in these present days. But as between the work of the\r\nscientist and that of the humanitarian the Indian is vastly more in need\r\nof the latter than of the former.\r\n\r\nIn the belief that our studies of the American Indian have so progressed\r\nthat one may now consider the race in its entirety, I have set myself\r\nthe rather ambitious task of preparing a number of volumes treating of\r\nthe American Indian of the present and past. After much deliberation it\r\nhas occurred to me that the Indian of today should be first\r\nconsidered—hence this volume. At the outset, we find that generally\r\nspeaking the Indian throughout the United States although maintaining\r\nmuch of his original speech, and in places some of his aboriginal\r\ncharacteristics, yet, as a whole, he is in the transition period.\r\n\r\nOur native Americans are, and have been, a remarkable people. Their very\r\nmanner of life, their striking and picturesque costumes, their peculiar\r\ncolor and their diversified languages seem to have challenged the\r\nattention of explorers, travelers, priests and scientists. It is to be\r\ndoubted if there is another aboriginal race, on the face of the earth,\r\nconcerning which more books, articles and reports have been published.\r\nIn Europe, as well as in America, the Indian is celebrated in song and\r\nstory, yet since the discovery of America his domination has gradually\r\ndiminished, and the period of his greatest activity (since the advent of\r\nthe white race) is very short lived compared with that of other tribes\r\nof men. From 1500 to 1700, he may be said to have controlled a\r\nsufficient extent of the United States and Canada, to dominate it. His\r\npower after the year 1700 rapidly diminished, and in 1800 we find that\r\nhe did not control any large areas save west of the Mississippi and west\r\nof Lake Superior. Up to the year 1865, he dominated a large portion of\r\nthe West, South West and North West. From 1880 down to the present time,\r\nhis sun has rapidly declined and he may be said today to have passed out\r\nof the tribal estate, to have ceased to be a factor in national life as\r\na separate race. He is rapidly becoming merged into our larger body of\r\ncitizens, and while some thousands of Indians (perhaps 45,000) live and\r\nthink in the past, the great majority of Indians, like the great\r\nmajority of foreign immigrants, belong to the body politic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARTHUR C. PARKER\r\n\r\n  Iroquois. State Archaeologist of New York; Secretary Society American\r\n    Indians.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSo, we consider the majority in this study of the Indian, rather than\r\nthe minority; leaving that fraction to the scientist.\r\n\r\nIf we are consistent in the statement that we shall begin with the\r\npresent and work backward into the past, we must consider in this volume\r\nthe activities and the life of the modern Indian, and the modern Indian\r\nbeing in the transition period presents us very little in the way of\r\nfolklore and traditions. A careful study of the recent reports of\r\nethnological investigators emphasizes this truth. The writers have\r\ninvariably sought out the _older_ Indians, for the very good reason that\r\nthey knew much concerning the past. The greater number of Indians—the\r\nmiddle-aged and young, and the thousands of educated Indians—are not\r\nable to furnish material such as scientific investigators seek. A\r\nconfirmation of my statement will be found in that excellent memoir,\r\n“Chippewa Music,” by Miss Frances Densmore. This was published by the\r\nBureau of Ethnology in 1913. In this worthy publication, denoting much\r\nresearch, Miss Densmore is dependent on the older people for her\r\ninformation. Even these older persons, as they appear in the photographs\r\naccompanying the book, are dressed in garments such as are worn by white\r\npersons. Many of these Indians (as in the case of other tribes) keep a\r\nfew old war bonnets, buckskin coats, moccasins, leggings, embroidered\r\nbelts, etc., with which they adorn themselves on state-occasions, but\r\ntheir natural dress today, is European in character. Not only in Miss\r\nDensmore’s book but in the reports of other investigators in the United\r\nStates, where a group of Indians are assembled, one observes more\r\nevidence of European than native American costumes. It is frequently (if\r\nnot usually) necessary to ask the Indians to put on their tribal\r\ncostumes, and sometimes they are compelled to borrow a garment here and\r\nthere among their friends in order to make up properly. There naturally\r\narises the pertinent question—are not modern Indians so saturated with\r\ncivilization that their opinions of tribal customs of past decades\r\nshould be accepted with due reserve? This important question should be\r\nconsidered by some one of our numerous writers on Indian topics.\r\n\r\nThe two maps presented opposite pages 25 and 35, will bring home to\r\nreaders the tremendous shrinkage of Indian lands during the short space\r\nof thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe map, presented by Commissioner Sells in his report for 1913, as\r\ncontrasted to the map of 1879, shows that the Indian reservations have\r\nbeen cut down to at least one-third. The population in the year 1881\r\nwill be found in small figures on each area given on the map. It will be\r\nseen by comparing the period of 1879 with 1913, that the Navaho have\r\ngreatly increased, and also the tribes now living in Oklahoma (formerly\r\nIndian Territory). Others have either diminished, or show slight\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN HOME, ONONDAGA RESERVATION, NEW YORK\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe increases are due to growth of the mixed-blood elements, to white\r\nmen marrying Indian women.[3] The allotment plan, the accumulation of\r\ntribal funds, the increase in property values—all these factors induced\r\nmany persons to “get on the Indian rolls” and thus swell the numbers;\r\nwhile the pure-blood Navahos are increasing, I doubt if other tribes\r\nshow growth—save in the mixed-blood element referred to above.\r\n\r\nCertainly these two maps present us with facts for serious study. They\r\nindicate the rapidity with which the Red Race’s property is being\r\nlegislated away. Many reservations have been abolished, and the Indians\r\nallotted land in severalty. If the Indians held such lands as white men\r\nhold their farms, the whole Indian area today would be as large as\r\nformerly, even though reservation lines are abolished. Some do hold\r\ntheir lands. But most of them sell, lease, or mortgage; the maps, after\r\nall, tell the sad truth, and the erasure of governmental lines usually\r\nmeans the blotting out of Indian titles.\r\n\r\n            TABLE 1.—INDIAN POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n                           FROM 1850 TO 1913\r\n\r\n           Year              Authority\r\n\r\n           1850 Report of H.

In 1886 there were 334,000\r\nIndians, whereas in ’87 the number is given as 243,000. This must be due\r\nto faulty enumeration, or to estimating rather than counting. The\r\ngradual increase from 1898 to 1913 is for the reason assigned, page 21.\r\n\r\nIn the table presented by Commissioner Sells it will be observed that\r\nthe Indians have made some progress along various industrial directions.\r\nAs he has grouped under a total valuation of $22,238,242, all the\r\nhorses, cattle, hogs and sheep raised by the Indians, it is difficult to\r\ncompare this table with those of 1879–1881. I present tables of those\r\nyears prepared long ago by the Board of Indian Commissioners and\r\npublished by them February 1st, 1882. It will be seen that the number of\r\nacres under cultivation are about the same thirty-two years ago as at\r\nthe present time. In 1881 there were over 2,000,000 head of stock owned\r\nby Indians. The value of sheep would reduce an average of $10 per head,\r\nhorses and cattle would raise it. Some horses might be worth as high as\r\n$50, most of them would average $15. Cattle would range from $15 to $25\r\nper head at that time. Mules would be higher, while hogs might be\r\naveraged at $8 per head, and sheep, $2. We might strike an average of\r\n$10 per head, which would amount to $20,000,000. In view of the present\r\nincreased value of livestock, the $22,000,000 worth of property and\r\nlivestock at the present time cannot amount to more than 2,000,000 head.\r\n(_See [page 29]_)\r\n\r\nI think the slight increase noted in the 1912 table is due to the\r\nprogress of certain Indian tribes (notably the Navaho) and the increased\r\nmoney value per head of stock. It does not mean that the Indians own\r\nmore “live” property today than they did in 1881.\r\n\r\nAll of this, it is understood, is no reflection on the Honorable\r\nCommissioner or his able assistants. It merely indicates that the\r\nIndians, as a body, have not progressed to the extent that we would\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n ════╤════════════╤═════════════════════════════════════\r\n     │  Acreage   │       CROPS RAISED BY INDIANS\r\n     │agricultural│\r\n     │   lands    │\r\n     │ cultivated │\r\n     │ by Indians │\r\n ────┼────────────┼───────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────\r\n     │            │  Hay  │Corn Tons│Wheat Bu.│Oats and\r\n     │            │ Tons  │         │         │ Barley\r\n     │            │       │         │         │   Bu.\r\n ────┼────────────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n 1912│     558,503│158,478│1,525,334│1,343,213│1,001,504\r\n ────┼────────────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n 1904│     365,469│405,629│  949,815│  750,788│1,246,460\r\n ────┼────────────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n 1898│     352,217│215,163│1,339,444│  664,930│  599,665\r\n ────┴────────────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\n ════╤════════════════════════════════\r\n     │     STOCK OWNED BY INDIANS\r\n     │\r\n     │\r\n     │\r\n     │\r\n ────┼───────┬───────┬──────┬─────────\r\n     │Horses │Cattle │Swine │  Sheep\r\n     │       │       │      │\r\n     │       │       │      │\r\n ────┼───────┴───────┴──────┴─────────\r\n 1912│         [5]$22,238,242\r\n ────┼───────┬───────┬──────┬─────────\r\n 1904│295,466│297,611│40,898│  792,620\r\n ────┼───────┼───────┼──────┼─────────\r\n 1898│328,866│214,474│37,359│1,041,315\r\n ────┴───────┴───────┴──────┴─────────\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map showing\r\n  INDIAN RESERVATIONS\r\n  in the United States\r\n  West of the 83^{rd}.

On March 3, 1849, the Interior Department took over the\r\nmanagement of the Indians. Since 1832, there have been 31 Commissioners\r\nof Indian Affairs. The longest tenure of office was that held by\r\nHonorable Wm. A. Jones.\r\n\r\nThe present Commissioner is Honorable Cato Sells of Texas, who took\r\ncharge June 4, 1913. Mr. Sells has already inaugurated a new and\r\nprogressive policy and his work is highly commended by every person\r\nhaving the welfare of the Indians at heart.[6] A splendid tribute has\r\nbeen paid him by M. K. Sniffen, Esq., Corresponding Secretary of the\r\nIndian Rights Association. Honorable Edgar B. Meritt, who has served\r\nfaithfully for many years, is Assistant Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThere are in addition to these high officers, Second Assistant\r\nCommissioner, Honorable C. F. Hauke; and Honorable E. B. Linnen, Chief\r\nof the Inspection Service. I have always considered the Inspection\r\nService the most important of all. It is therefore very satisfactory\r\nthat we have as Chief of the Division, a man who has had twenty-five\r\nyears’ experience as Inspector and former Secret Service official. And\r\nright here, I wish to state that if the Inspection Service had been\r\nefficient in past years, the horrible scandals in Minnesota, Oklahoma\r\nand elsewhere never would have occurred.\r\n\r\nThere are Chiefs of Divisions in education, land and finance; Chief\r\nSupervisors of schools, health, industries, irrigation, forestry and\r\nconstruction. There are ten Supervisors and eight Special Agents serving\r\nin the various Divisions. The roster of officers for this year contains\r\nthe names of hundreds of conscientious and competent men and women\r\nscattered throughout the entire West and in Washington, whose sole\r\npurpose is to make of these Indians good American citizens. No one who\r\nhas investigated the Indian situation as it presents itself today can do\r\nother than accord to all these persons the full meed of praise. They\r\nlabor under great disadvantages. If they are radical, they call down\r\nupon their heads the wrath of those who covet Indian lands; if they are\r\nconservative, the officials of various benevolent organizations accuse\r\nthem of aiding and abetting the grafters in their nefarious work. If a\r\nsingle mistake is made—though unintentional—it is pointed out by some\r\ndisgruntled person living in the Indian country. The complications, the\r\nsituation, and the opposition which they are called upon to face might\r\nwell cause many of their critics to timidly decline to exchange places\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nI am entirely sincere in the above statement. Because it has been my\r\nunpleasant duty to point out needed reforms—not to use a stronger term—a\r\nfew good people have imagined that I criticised the personnel of the\r\nIndian Service. That would be not only unkind, but also unjust, and in\r\nall that I have published, written or spoken, I have never thought to\r\ncriticize any man or woman save those who were engaged in defrauding\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nAs will be presented in the final chapter of this book, the Indian\r\nOffice machinery is efficient, and the personnel competent. The only\r\nquestion—and it is a great question—is whether our manufactured product\r\nis what it should be. Our machines are perfect, but do we run them\r\nproperly?\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Mr. Sells, issued a valuable report\r\nDecember 8, 1913. It covers the period from July 1, 1912, to June 30,\r\n1913. In order that we may grasp the full significance of the work being\r\ndone by the Indian Office, and the magnitude of the problems confronting\r\nus, it is necessary to present some statistics, taken from this report.\r\n\r\nThere are some 6,000 employees in the Indian Service, and 330,639\r\nIndians. Among the Indians are included a great many mixed bloods and\r\npersons who have married Indian women. This swells the total, as I have\r\npointed out on Page 21.\r\n\r\nThe property of these Indians is estimated by the Commissioner to be\r\nworth nearly $900,000,000. As competent observers in the State of\r\nOklahoma claim the Indians have property there rising $500,000,000 in\r\nvalue, it is my candid opinion, after considering the Navaho, Crow,\r\nSioux, Yakima, Apache and all other lands, minerals, timber, etc., in\r\nthe United States, that the sum is probably nearer $1,200,000,000. There\r\nis also in the United States Treasury some $48,848,744 in cash.\r\n\r\nThere has been appropriated since the year 1881, and including the year\r\n1914, this generous sum for the education, allotting, protection of\r\nIndians and the maintenance of the thousands of employees in the Indian\r\nService, viz:—$263,623,004.01. This enormous sum properly and wisely\r\nexpended from the year 1881 to the present time would have solved the\r\nIndian problem in the United States. But two great obstacles stood in\r\nthe way—the politician in the East and the grafter in the West. The\r\nHonorable Commissioner cannot state in his report that it is due to\r\nthese two influences that our Indian history is, beyond question, the\r\ndarkest page in the general American history, but such a statement is\r\nabsolutely correct.\r\n\r\nOf these 330,000 Indians, 180,000 have received farms, or as the Indian\r\nOffice calls them, allotments. 34,000,000 acres have been used for this\r\npurpose and there remain 39,000,000 acres. The Commissioner states that\r\nthe timber held by Indians is worth $80,000,000.\r\n\r\nSince 1876 the Government has spent $80,000,000 for schools and\r\neducation, and there are now 223 Indian day schools on or near Indian\r\ncommunities; 76 boarding-schools on reservations and 35 non-reservation\r\nschools. There are 65,000 Indian children, and all go to school save\r\n17,500 who are either defectives or unprovided for.\r\n\r\nThere are 25,000 Indians suffering from tuberculosis; yet there are but\r\n300 beds in all the Indian hospitals. This is a condition that would not\r\nbe tolerated outside of an Indian community in the United States, for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Thirty-two per cent of the Indian deaths are due to\r\npulmonary tuberculosis as against 12.02 per cent among the white people\r\nof the United States. 60,000 Indians suffer from trachoma. This eye\r\ndisease was introduced by the lower class of European immigrants and it\r\nspread throughout nearly every Indian community.\r\n\r\n“I find that the Indians have more than 600,000 acres of irrigable land,\r\napproximately 9,000,000 acres of other agricultural lands, more than\r\n50,000,000 acres grazing lands, and that the Government has expended\r\napproximately $10,000,000 in connection with Indian irrigation projects.\r\n\r\n“Many able-bodied Indians who have valuable lands are wholly or\r\npartially without seeds, teams, implements, and other equipment to\r\nutilize properly such lands. This is particularly true in several\r\nreservations where large sums of public or tribal funds have been used\r\nin constructing irrigation systems, and is in part the reason why such\r\nlarge areas of irrigable and other agricultural lands are not under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\n“The valuable grazing lands of the Indians offer unusual opportunities\r\nfor increasing the meat supply of the country, at the same time\r\nfurnishing a profitable employment for the Indians as well as utilizing\r\ntheir valuable grazing lands. During the last year the Indians\r\ncultivated less than 600,000 acres of their vast area of agricultural\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n“It shall be my purpose to attempt to procure reimbursable\r\nappropriations so as to advance to the Indians needed agricultural\r\nequipment in order that they may make beneficial use of their resources\r\nand become self-supporting and progressive citizens. These reimbursable\r\nappropriations, if procured and properly used, will result in ultimately\r\ndecreasing the gratuity appropriations for Indians.”[7]\r\n\r\nCommissioner Sells very wisely emphasizes agricultural work,\r\nstock-raising and cooperation with the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture. He calls attention to the enormous number of lands leased\r\nby the Indians to white men, for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and illuminating sections in the report is,\r\nto my mind, the table number 7: “General data for each Indian\r\nreservation, under what agency or school, tribes occupying or belonging\r\nto it, area not allotted or specially reserved, and authority for its\r\nestablishment, to Nov. 3, 1913.”\r\n\r\nA study of this table indicates that tracts of these lands have been\r\nsold under various acts of Congress. The statements appear: “Open to\r\nsettlement 1,449,268 acres” or, “1,061,500 acres were open to\r\nsettlement.” All this indicates that enormous tracts have been sold to\r\nsettlers, or disposed of by the Government after the Indians had been\r\nallotted. This policy has been persistently carried on in the State of\r\nOklahoma, although I have repeatedly urged not only the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs, but also the Commissioner of the Five Civilized Tribes\r\nto conserve some of these lands. I have contended, also, that the\r\nIndians are not properly protected in their property rights, and many of\r\nthem are becoming paupers; that large tracts of land should be reserved\r\nby the Government in order that each dispossessed or pauperized Indian\r\nshould be entitled to a small home at some future time. The policy of\r\ndisposing of enormous tracts of grazing and agricultural land is\r\nextremely short-sighted.\r\n\r\nI have been told, when calling attention of Commissioner Wright, or the\r\nIndian Office, to the fact that some of these surplus lands should be\r\nconserved, that under the law, this cannot be done. The land is tribal\r\nproperty, or by act of Congress on such and such a date the lands were\r\nordered sold. There is always authority for these sales, and no one can\r\nquestion it. But the policy continues, and to me appears very\r\npernicious. Certain Indians on some of our reservations have either\r\ndisposed of their holdings, or been swindled out of them. If none of the\r\nsurplus lands are retained, there will be nothing available for these\r\nIndians, and they will soon become homeless paupers. We have an\r\nillustration of that in California. There we permitted the Indians to\r\nlose their property, or to be evicted. In recent years we have spent\r\nlarge sums of money purchasing tracts of irrigated land to provide homes\r\nfor the very Indians we permitted to lose their homesteads. Certainly\r\nthis is a very short-sighted and unbusiness-like policy.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Indian the past year in arts and industries has been\r\nfairly satisfactory. Most of the Superintendents report increased\r\nindustry on the part of their wards. The Commissioner presents nearly\r\n200 pages of tabulated statistics covering progress and values. The\r\nIndians have not worked in the same proportion as have white people for\r\nvarious reasons. I shall set forth these in detail in a subsequent\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n                         RESULTS OF INDIAN LABOR\r\n\r\n                       INDIANS EXCLUSIVE OF FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES\r\n ═════════════════════════════════════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════\r\n                                          │  1879   │  1880   │  1881\r\n Number of acres broken by Indians        │   24,270│   27,105│   29,558\r\n Number of acres cultivated               │  157,056│  168,340│  205,367\r\n Number of bushels of wheat raised        │  328,637│  408,812│  451,479\r\n Number of bushels of corn raised         │  643,286│  604,103│  517,642\r\n Number of bushels of oats and barley     │         │         │\r\n   raised                                 │  189,054│  224,899│  343,444\r\n Number of bushels of vegetables raised   │  390,698│  375,843│  488,792\r\n Number of tons of hay cut                │   48,333│   75,745│   76,763\r\n Number of horses owned                   │  199,732│  211,981│  188,402\r\n Number of cattle owned                   │   68,894│   78,939│   80,684\r\n Number of swine owned                    │   32,537│   40,381│   43,913\r\n Number of sheep owned                    │  863,525│  864,216│  977,017\r\n Number of houses occupied                │   11,634│   12,507│   12,893\r\n Number of Indian houses built during the │         │         │\r\n   year                                   │    1,211│    1,639│    1,409\r\n Number of Indian apprentices who have    │         │         │\r\n   been learning trades                   │      185│      358│      436\r\n                                          │         │         │\r\n           FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES          │         │         │\r\n                                          │         │         │\r\n Number of acres cultivated               │  273,000│  314,396│  348,000\r\n Number of bushels of wheat raised        │  565,400│  336,424│  105,000\r\n Number of bushels of corn raised         │2,015,000│2,346,042│  616,000\r\n Number of bushels of oats and barley     │         │         │\r\n   raised                                 │  200,000│  124,568│   74,300\r\n Number of bushels of vegetables raised   │  336,700│  595,000│  305,000\r\n Number of tons of hay cut                │  176,500│  125,500│  161,500\r\n Number of bales of cotton raised         │   10,530│   16,800│\r\n Number of horses owned                   │   45,500│   51,453│   64,600\r\n Number of mules owned                    │    5,500│    5,138│    6,150\r\n Number of cattle owned                   │  272,000│  297,040│  370,000\r\n Number of swine owned                    │  190,000│  400,282│  455,000\r\n Number of sheep owned                    │   32,400│   34,034│   33,400\r\n ─────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Chapters upon health, education, irrigation, etc.,\r\nI have presented bibliographies.

For these journals the Indian Service officials frequently write\r\narticles, and in them speeches and addresses upon Indian topics by\r\nprominent men are often reproduced.\r\n\r\nThese journals are creditable publications and do much toward\r\nenlightening the boys and girls as to progress in other schools—thus\r\nacting as an incentive to further effort. It is unfortunate that the\r\npublic at large is not familiar with them. Were they generally\r\ncirculated, much ignorance of Indian education would disappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MODERN INDIAN HOUSE\r\n\r\n  Although on the Allegheny reservation, N.

AYER’S REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the preceding chapter that the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, his assistants, Supervisors, Inspectors and Special Agents\r\nstand at the head of a very great Bureau; and that under them are\r\nthousands of employees. The diagram on the following page is an outline\r\nplan of the entire Indian Service, beginning with that great body, the\r\nCongress of the United States, and passing through its various\r\nramifications down to the amalgamation of the educated, competent Indian\r\ninto the body of American citizens.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive table was published by Honorable F. E. Farrell,\r\nSuperintendent of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Agency, in the school\r\npublication _The Carrier Pigeon_, in December, 1912.\r\n\r\nWe should first realize the tremendous difference between the Indians of\r\n1850 and those of 1914. A comparison of the Indian reservation map of\r\n1879 and the map of 1913 will give readers some idea of the tremendous\r\nchanges in Indian life in this country. In the short space of fifty\r\nyears, the entire West has been transformed from an Indian country to a\r\nwhite man’s country. The problem of these Indians is today, not so much\r\nan ethnologic study, as it is a citizenship and humanitarian problem.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are a few scattered bands of Indians on the public domain\r\n(notably Papago and Navaho, and a few other bands) more than nine-tenths\r\nof these people are under direct Federal or State supervision. As I have\r\nremarked elsewhere, a great many of the Navaho and certain other Indians\r\nstill keep up tribal customs and continue in the faith of their\r\nancestors, but for the greater part, the Indians are, and should be,\r\nconsidered a part of our body politic. Before discussing some of the\r\nlarger tribes, and certain phases of Indian history in the broad sense,\r\nwe should review the Indian situation as it presents itself generally in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the far East, we should glance at the thousand or more\r\nnative Americans living in Maine and New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred Penobscot and Passamaquoddy Indians are located at\r\nOldtown, Maine, and on the St. Croix River above Princeton, Maine. These\r\nare of superior intelligence, and all are self-supporting. There is some\r\ndrunkenness, but it is not prevalent, as among some of our western\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n                       DIAGRAM OF THE INDIAN SERVICE\r\n\r\n

The\r\nPenobscots own all the islands in the Penobscot River between Oldtown\r\nand Millinockett. They are, for the most part, guides, farmers,\r\ncarpenters, clerks and lumbermen. Many of them earn excellent wages—from\r\n$2 to $5 per day. I saw no evidences of poverty. The people are\r\nintelligent and of good character. Consumption is not common, and\r\ntrachoma cases are rare.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the splendid condition of the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy\r\nIndians should not be lost upon our officials and Indian Committees in\r\nauthority in Congress.\r\n\r\nThey have been surrounded by a high class of white people, and have been\r\nleft alone to develop and progress. While they have been protected by\r\nthe State of Maine, no discrimination has been made against them, as in\r\nthe case of Indians in Oklahoma, Minnesota, California and elsewhere.\r\nThey enjoy the same citizenship as is conferred upon Whites, and it does\r\nnot consist of “paper promises,” but is real and effective. Theirs is no\r\nstory of dishonesty and disease.\r\n\r\nThe past summer, while on an archaeological expedition on the St. John\r\nRiver, I visited three villages occupied by Malecite Indians, in New\r\nBrunswick, Canada. All of them are well situated, one at the mouth of\r\nthe Tobique River; another at Edmunston; and a third near Woodstock.\r\nWhile these Indians are poor, there is no general pauperism, and their\r\ngeneral health is better than among the Indians I have visited in our\r\nUnited States (exclusive of Maine).\r\n\r\nIn one respect the plans followed by the Canadian officials are superior\r\nto ours, and evince more ability (or rather stability) in the handling\r\nof the Indians. Instead of allotting these Indians, giving them deeds to\r\nvaluable property, permitting them to be swindled by unscrupulous white\r\npersons, and then spending years in profitless litigation, in an attempt\r\nto make grafters return property taken from the Indians, these Canadians\r\nhave continued the reservation system under a modified form. The Indians\r\nown their tracts of land, as with us, but do not hold deeds, or trust\r\npatents to same, therefore the lands cannot be sold or mortgaged; thus\r\nthe incentive to fraud is removed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians serve as farmers, guides, carpenters and fishermen. Most of\r\nthem are Catholics, and there is a priest located at the Tobique\r\nvillage. He lives among them and encourages them in various arts.\r\n\r\nThe census gives a few Indians as residing in our eastern states, but\r\nthey are white people in every way, save color.\r\n\r\nTo discover the next body of Indians exceeding more than three or four\r\nhundred, we must go down South where we find a few bands of Cherokees in\r\nSwain and Jackson Counties, North Carolina; and scattered throughout\r\nTennessee, Georgia, and Alabama there are 1100 or 1200 residing on what\r\nwas originally a part of the habitat of this great nation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNMENT SAWMILL, FT. BELKNAP RESERVATION, MONTANA\r\n\r\n  Lumber cut by Indians.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING INDIAN RESERVATIONS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES 1913]\r\n\r\nSome of the Iroquois still reside in western New York, notably in\r\nsettlements not far from Buffalo. These Indians, as in the case of the\r\nNorth Carolina Cherokees, are chiefly mixed-bloods, have adopted our\r\ncustoms, live in fairly comfortable houses and are in no need of\r\nGovernment supervision. Among the Iroquois of New York, the percentage\r\nof tuberculosis and other diseases was so low as to be practically nil.\r\nIn one of the recent Government reports it is given as but a fraction\r\nover one per cent.\r\n\r\nThere has recently developed agitation seeking to break up their\r\nreservation. This is most unfortunate, as the tracts are small; the\r\nIndians are doing well and desire to be let alone. They deserve to\r\nremain in peaceful possession of their old-time homes.\r\n\r\nAll of the remaining Indians east of the Mississippi, and south of the\r\nGreat Lakes need not enter into our discussion. Save for a noticeable\r\nIndian color in the case of some individuals, the bulk of them have\r\nceased to be real Indians. The New York Iroquois, in recent times, have\r\nmade creditable progress in arts, and have produced a number of\r\nprominent men and women. A large number of them serve in responsible\r\npositions and so far as they are concerned there is no Indian problem.\r\nWe may, therefore, eliminate the eastern half of the United States, with\r\nthe exception of Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida.\r\n\r\nIn Florida we have the descendants of the Seminoles, estimated at 600,\r\nand are an offshoot of the Creeks, or Muskokis. These still cling to\r\ntheir ancient homes in the Everglades, and have withstood all attempts\r\nto make of them either educated Indians or agency Indians. During Mr.\r\nLeupp’s administration, he proposed to me that I go to Florida and spend\r\na winter cultivating the friendship of these Indians and see if it were\r\nnot possible to persuade them to send their children to school. I was\r\nunable to carry this mission into effect, but I understand that recently\r\nthe Government sent a Special Agent there, who has compelled a number of\r\nthe children to attend school. The draining of the Everglades is now\r\nwell under way, and soon the hunting and fishing-grounds of these people\r\nwill be very much restricted. They have always been self-supporting and\r\nthey merit consideration, and should have our help. It is to be hoped\r\nthat before the ditching of the Everglades is completed, these Indians\r\nwill be properly provided for. This is a subject I would commend to the\r\nattention of the Federal authorities.\r\n\r\nIn Wisconsin we have quite a large number of Indians at the present\r\ntime, located on reservations, or clustered about schools. These number\r\n9,930, and Wisconsin ranks ninth in the entire country in point of\r\nIndian population. Wisconsin is the first State, on our inspection tour\r\nfrom the East to the West, wherein we find a large body of Indians still\r\nin the transition period. They belong to the following bands:—the Ojibwa\r\n(Chippewa), Menominee, Potawatomi, Oneida, Winnebago and a few others.\r\nThe Ojibwa are by far the most numerous, amounting to, approximately,\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire number. Whether all of these five tribes\r\noriginally belonged in Wisconsin, is a question which may be deferred to\r\nthe ethnologist. We are treating of the State in recent times, as I have\r\npreviously remarked in this book. Therefore that great question—the\r\norigin of these Indians and their presence in the State of Wisconsin—is\r\nnot our concern. They are here located at the present time, and, in\r\ngeneral, are making fair progress.\r\n\r\nHonorable Edward E. Ayer, of the Board of Indian Commissioners, last\r\nyear, made an extended investigation of the timber problem confronting\r\nthe Menominee Indians. Mr. Ayer has kindly furnished me with an advance\r\ncopy of his report in order that I might present a synopsis. Seldom has\r\nan investigation been conducted under more auspicious circumstances. Mr.\r\nAyer took with him a number of persons, including a practical lumberman\r\nof wide experience. As the Menominee problem is one concerned with\r\ntimber, rather than land values, it was very important that the work be\r\nthoroughly done. Mr. Ayer covered the entire reservation in his report.\r\n\r\n“The Menominee Indians originally occupied the greater part of the State\r\nof Wisconsin. They ranged from what is now the site of Milwaukee north\r\nalong the west shores of Lake Michigan to Menominee, North Michigan, and\r\nwest to the Wisconsin River and Black River. Along Green Bay and the Fox\r\nRiver Valley were their principal settlements, and on the shores of\r\nGreen Bay they first met the white man, when Father Marquette, La Salle\r\nand the first French descended the Great Lakes from the Canada\r\nsettlement on exploration voyages of early days. On the reservation at\r\nKeshena is now the successor of the first French Mission established by\r\nMarquette at Green Bay.\r\n\r\n“A woods Indian, the Menominee was a striking figure, of generally six\r\nfeet and over in height, a giant in strength. Few in numbers when\r\ncompared with other great tribes, his bravery and fighting qualities\r\nenabled him to hold his own with surrounding tribes, Potawatomies on the\r\nsouth, Sauk and Fox and Winnebago on southwest, the great Dakota or\r\nSioux natives to west and Chippewa on the shore of Superior to the\r\nnorth, and the Hurons to the east of them. Their word once given could\r\nbe relied upon. The French, English and American nations, each in turn,\r\nmade treaties with them and all were faithfully kept. The Menominee was\r\na peaceful nation, seldom the aggressor, but mighty in wrath, once\r\njustified in taking the warpath. From early times these Indians have\r\nbeen the white man’s friend. In our Civil War many soldiers were\r\nrecruited from their band, and today here exists the only Indian G. A.\r\nR. Post in America. Their pursuits are farming, lumbering and\r\nmanufacture of lumber products. At Neopit is the seat of a large\r\nmilling-plant industry, capitalized for one million dollars. It has a\r\nsawmill with an output of forty million feet yearly, a planing-mill of\r\ntwenty million capacity and carries a stock on hand of forty million\r\nfeet of lumber, also laths, shingles, etc. The town numbers about one\r\nthousand men, women and children, and here may be seen the advanced\r\nIndian living in his modern cottage surrounded with all the home\r\ncomforts of modern life and partaking of the same social enjoyments as\r\nhis white brother. A modern day school and a mission day school furnish\r\neducation to his children, as does town life social instruction to his\r\nhome, and the mill industrial education to himself and sons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  U. S.

Scattered out from Keshena for a radius of\r\ntwelve miles is a scene of agricultural progress, Indian farmers whose\r\nefforts vary from farms of 5 to 80 acres, cleared, fenced and in various\r\nstages of improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEWIS TEWANIMA\r\n\r\n  In the 10,000–meter run at the Olympic Games in Stockholm Tewanima won\r\n    second place.

Educated at Carlisle.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The tribal funds on deposit in the Treasury of the United States are\r\napproximately $2,000,000, gathered from fruits of their own toil and in\r\nthe sale of their timber products.\r\n\r\n“The tribe numbers about 1700 souls. Statistics show about 575\r\nable-bodied males, aged 18 years and over. Labor figures for the reserve\r\nshow of this number an average of 264 adult Indians continuously\r\nemployed the year round, earning in wages $91,630.47, not including\r\nsubsistence. The greatest value of the Neopit operations is as a school\r\nof industry. Its value educationally, morally and civilly cannot be\r\nmeasured in dollars and cents.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ayer found that the Government had erected a sawmill at Neopit. This\r\nmill sawed Indian timber exclusively.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the mill’s operations were not satisfactory, there being\r\nextravagance in management. Since Mr. Nicholson was appointed, all of\r\nthis has been remedied, and after liberal deductions for all expenses,\r\nthe mill shows a profit of $443,176.17 to the Menominee Indians (from\r\nJuly, 1910 to September 30, 1913). He found the mill employed a large\r\nnumber of Indian men, while other Indians found employment working with\r\nthe logging crews in the woods. The mill served a double purpose. Not\r\nonly were the Indians employed and earned good wages, but they also\r\nreceived the benefits of the mill’s earnings.\r\n\r\nThere is practically no poverty on the reservation, and little sickness.\r\nThe houses are clean and well kept.\r\n\r\nMr. Ayer’s exhaustive study of conditions led him to make several\r\nrecommendations, one or two of which I append herewith:—\r\n\r\n“I recommend that two, four or six of the brightest young Indians on the\r\nReservation be sent to Wisconsin State College of Agriculture at Madison\r\nto take a full course in forestry and scientific farming, that they may\r\ncome back to the reservation equipped to teach the Indians who have\r\nelected to make farms.\r\n\r\n“I would also recommend that there be a company or tribal store at\r\nNeopit and a branch one at Keshena and that the goods shall be sold say\r\non a basis of 12½ or 15 per cent, which would make the stores absolutely\r\nself-sustaining and the Indians would get the necessities of life much\r\ncheaper. These stores should also carry a stock of the ordinary\r\nagricultural tools that might be used and there should also be a bank,\r\nsay with forty or fifty thousand dollars capital connected with the\r\nNeopit store, where the employees of the mill could get checks cashed.\r\n\r\n“Now, if they want to buy anything extraordinary, an agricultural tool\r\nor any other thing, or cash their check, they have got to go twenty\r\nmiles away to Shawano for the purpose, and they are subjected to all the\r\ntemptations of the outside towns. I think everything ought to be\r\nsupplied to the Indians on the reservation so that they would have as\r\nlittle necessity of leaving it as possible.”\r\n\r\nA complaint had gained circulation to the effect that the mill was\r\nlosing money and had been extravagantly managed. There were some grounds\r\nfor this five years ago, but not during the past three years. A certain\r\nattorney, wishing to take over the management of tribal affairs, visited\r\nthe Indians and, calling their attention to a few logs here and there,\r\nwhich had not been properly handled, persuaded the Indians to raise a\r\nsum of money to pay his expenses to Washington. Here he made complaints\r\nto the Commissioner and others. His presence on the reservation caused\r\ndissatisfaction. Ayer’s investigation proved that the loss was nothing\r\ncompared with the great financial benefits accruing to the Indians,\r\nthrough the mill’s operation.\r\n\r\nI mention this at some length for the reason that Mr. Ayer’s report was\r\nunjustly criticised by one or two persons who lent willing ears to the\r\nself-seeking attorney.\r\n\r\nHis report covers all questions relating to farming, education, health,\r\nand the sale of timber to better advantage. The mill is a model of\r\nefficiency, conserves the Indians’ timber to the tribe’s best interest,\r\nand similar mills should be conducted on other reservations.\r\n\r\nThe amount of timber remaining to be cut is variously estimated at from\r\n1,500,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 feet. It will thus be observed that the\r\nMenominee Indians are possessed of a very valuable property. The\r\nauthorities should heed Mr. Ayer’s suggestions, coming as they do, from\r\na practical timber man of many years’ experience.\r\n\r\nThe greatest tracts of timber (aside from Menominee) are on Chippewa\r\nlands at Bad River and La Pointe. Some are exceedingly valuable. I\r\naddressed the Department and received assurance that the Commissioner\r\nwas aware of the dangers of a “second White Earth.” The following\r\nofficial communication (in part) is evidence that these Indians will be\r\nprotected:—\r\n\r\n“Under the treaty of September 30, 1854 (10 Stats. L., 1109), 1063\r\nIndians within the La Pointe or Bad River Reservation, Wisconsin, have\r\nbeen allotted a total area of 8,387,068 acres. Approximately 45,000\r\nacres of surplus tribal land remain, authority for the allotment of\r\nwhich exists in the Act of February 11, 1901 (31 Stats. L., 766), as\r\namended by the Act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stats. L., 1217). Nothing is\r\nsaid in these acts about the allotment of timber lands and the remaining\r\ntribal lands within this reservation are very valuable for timber\r\npurposes, some of the eighty-acre tracts being estimated to yield\r\napproximately $30,000 for the timber alone. Other tracts containing but\r\nlittle timber are not desirable and an equitable division of the lands\r\nin allotment cannot be made under existing conditions.\r\n\r\n“Two factions exist in the tribe, one in favor of allotting under\r\nexisting laws and the other in favor of selling the timber, distributing\r\nthe proceeds per capita and thereafter allotting the lands to the\r\nunallotted Indians belonging on this reservation.\r\n\r\n“Appended hereto is the part of the Office file relating to this\r\nallotment correspondence, particularly the submission to the Department\r\nof the request for authority to procure agreements from the Indians to\r\nallot the lands under the existing laws with the understanding that the\r\ntimber should be cut and sold for the benefit of the tribe at large.”\r\n(File omitted in this book.)\r\n\r\nFor several years there have been extensive cuttings of pine timber on\r\nthe reservations at Bad River, Lac du Flambeau, Lac Courte Oreille, and\r\nFond du Lac. The total amount cut on each of these reservations was as\r\nfollows: Bad River, 57,183,770 feet; Lac du Flambeau, 23,049,110 feet;\r\nLac Courte Oreille, 4,268,050 feet; Fond du Lac, 13,128,775 feet. All of\r\nthis timber was cut on allotments except 12,068,620 feet cut from\r\nunpatented lands of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation, claimed by the\r\nState of Wisconsin as swamp lands, and 56,955 feet cut from tribal lands\r\nof the Bad River Reservation.\r\n\r\nA number of circular letters were addressed by me to persons living in\r\nWisconsin, requesting information as to the condition of the Indians. It\r\nis known that not only is there vocational training in the schools, but\r\nalso more or less higher educational training. One of my correspondents,\r\na missionary, takes the view that there has been too much higher\r\neducation of Indian children in his State, and it would be far better to\r\nconfine the work to the teaching of trades and give no book instruction\r\nbeyond the fundamentals. He thinks that the average Indian when educated\r\nbeyond this point, is not willing to take his place as an ordinary\r\nworkman. Another gentleman, while expressing satisfaction with much that\r\nhas been done, sums up the situation in the particular Indian community\r\nin which he resides as follows: “Too much red tape.”\r\n\r\nThe progress of these Indians while slow, is satisfactory. They do not\r\npresent a sufficiently interesting problem for our study at the present\r\ntime. It is safe to predict that within a generation, a full-blood\r\nIndian in Wisconsin will be a rarity. They may continue to live an\r\nindefinite length of time in various communities where they are now\r\nsettled, but Government supervision (save possibly on the Menominee\r\nreservation) may be safely withdrawn in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan the larger number of Indians are Chippewa (Ojibwa), with a\r\nsprinkling of Ottawa and Potawatomi. Schools care for a majority of\r\ntheir children, and the adults are, for the most part, quite\r\nself-supporting. They may be dismissed from our pages.\r\n\r\nProceeding westward to the headquarters of the Mississippi, we have the\r\ngreat Minnesota region which is generally covered in my four chapters\r\nupon White Earth reservation. West of the Mississippi River, there are\r\nvery few Indians in that great area of Texas (but 702), and in Iowa,\r\nMissouri, Arkansas and Louisiana; the numbers range from 313 to 780.\r\nThese areas may be set aside as containing such a preponderance of white\r\npopulation as to render those of Indian blood an extreme minority. Of\r\nthe mountain states, Colorado contains but 870 Indians, Wyoming 1715,\r\nand the others 4,000 to 11,000. The great Indian populations are,\r\ntherefore, confined to nine states. Ten states contain from 800 to\r\n8,000. The remaining twenty-nine contain but a fraction of the entire\r\nIndian body, and they are now more white than Indian.\r\n\r\nTexas, in spite of its enormous size, is interesting in that but a\r\nhandful of Indians are in evidence. In 1850 the Indian population was\r\nconsiderable. Nelson Lee’s book of captivity among the Comanches[8]\r\ngives an idea of the extent of the roving bands of Comanches and Apaches\r\ninfesting the State in early days. The hostility of the Texas people was\r\nsuch that through the organization of the famous Texas Rangers those\r\nIndians were either driven out of the State or exterminated. Very little\r\nconsideration was shown them, and I can find no evidence of any general\r\neffort being put forward to protect these Indians in their rights or\r\nplace them upon reservations or establish schools among them. Our troops\r\nwere frequently sent into Texas, and as late as 1875, roving bands of\r\nIndians infested the western part of the State and carried on raids into\r\nold Mexico, or stole stock from Texas ranches. As to the number of\r\nIndians in the State of Texas just prior to the Civil War, there seems\r\nto be no reliable statistics.\r\n\r\nThe Texas tribes were of the general Caddoan stock, of which the\r\nComanche appear to have been the largest and strongest branch. These\r\nIndians ranged through the valleys of the Brazos and Colorado and\r\nextended their conquests to the land of the Apache, along the Rio\r\nGrande, to the west. They were essentially buffalo Indians and were not\r\nagriculturalists, but presented the purest nomadic type found in the\r\nsouthwest. This must not be misunderstood. The Navaho are nomadic to a\r\ncertain extent, but their range has been limited. Moreover they possess\r\nflocks and herds. There is no evidence that the Comanche ever\r\ndomesticated sheep, goats, and cattle, although they frequently obtained\r\nstock in their raids against the Texans. As they were continually on the\r\nmove following the buffalo in its migrations, or planning war parties\r\nagainst the white people and Mexicans alike, they were pure nomads, as\r\nstated above.\r\n\r\nYears ago, during the height of Indian troubles in Texas, a law was\r\npassed expelling red men from that State. Indians entering the State\r\nwere subjected to fine, imprisonment or expulsion. The feeling against\r\nthe race was very bitter, and Indians in Texas never received just\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nA few of them were, in later years, taken to Indian Territory, but most\r\nof the Comanches, it is safe to affirm, were killed in action. Although\r\nthe Texas rangers were superiorly armed and better mounted, the Apaches\r\ncontinued their warfare from the earliest times down to about 1870, when\r\ntheir power was permanently broken. They were very cruel and vindictive.\r\nNelson Lee’s narrative, to which I have referred, is one of the most\r\ninteresting Indian captivities ever brought to my attention. It presents\r\na vivid picture of the Comanche as they were during the period preceding\r\nour war with Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER IV. THE OJIBWA OF MINNESOTA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ojibwa commonly known as Chippewa, constitute one of the great\r\ndivisions of the Algonkin stock. We shall have much to say concerning\r\ntheir ethnology, in a subsequent volume. But following the scope\r\naccepted for this book, we shall treat of the Ojibwa as one of the great\r\nIndian tribes (numerically), at the present time and one much “advanced”\r\nalong the white man’s trail.\r\n\r\nThe year 1850 found the Ojibwa, or Chippewa, Indians located as they are\r\nat the present time, with some exceptions. A few in Wisconsin and on the\r\nshores of Lake Superior; some at Turtle Mountain in North Dakota, but\r\nmost of them living in the State of Minnesota at Leech Lake, White\r\nEarth, Red Lake and Cass Lake. The number of these Indians in the year\r\n1851 was about 28,000. In 1884 the entire number is given as 16,000. In\r\n1905, the “Handbook of American Indians” estimates that there are 15,000\r\nin British America and 17,144 in the United States.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to trace the migrations, and study the interesting\r\ncustoms and folklore of these people would do well to consult an\r\ninteresting book written by an Ojibwa, Mr. William W. Warren. The\r\nmanuscript of this work was prepared between 1850 and 1853. Warren’s\r\nmother was three-fourths Ojibwa and his father a white man. He died of\r\ntuberculosis June 1, 1853, and the Minnesota Historical Society did not\r\npublish his history of the nation until 1885. Clearly, Warren was the\r\nmost prominent of later-day Ojibwa; he had served in the Minnesota\r\nLegislature, and he was possessed of a brilliant mind and would\r\ndoubtless have made his mark in the world had he lived.\r\n\r\nIn the early ’50’s and ’60’s a few of the fur companies still did\r\nbusiness in northern Minnesota. It was no uncommon sight to see the “Red\r\nRiver ox carts” bringing supplies into northern Minnesota, or carrying\r\nloads of furs to the nearest Hudson Bay post, in the Red River valley to\r\nthe north. The Ojibwa came in contact with the French-Canadian element\r\nduring the activities of the fur trade, and had little in common with,\r\nor met few Americans, until white settlers from the East increased in\r\nnumbers in the State of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nWhile this and the succeeding chapter are confined chiefly to White\r\nEarth, a description of Leech Lake and Red Lake reservations should not\r\nbe omitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HONORABLE GABE E. PARKER, CHOCTAW\r\n\r\n  Registrar of the United States Treasury.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Ojibwa Indians living on Red Lake have not been allotted, but hold\r\ntheir land in common. The pine timber possessed by them is valued at\r\nseveral million dollars. Most of the cabins are grouped about the shores\r\nof Red Lake, and the Indians while not well-to-do, are far from\r\npauperism. It has not been necessary to ration them as in the case of\r\nWhite Earth, where the Superintendent, Major John R. Howard, last winter\r\nfed 762 Indians. The reasons for this are set forth in succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nThe Ojibwa at Leech Lake have valuable white pine, but this has been cut\r\nunder Government supervision and the dreadful scandals occurring at\r\nWhite Earth have been avoided. At Leech Lake, Red Lake, and Cass Lake,\r\nthe Indians live by working in the lumber camps, agriculture, fishing,\r\nand some serve in other branches of industry. They have, however,\r\ndepended entirely too much upon interest payments made by the\r\nGovernment. Much of the educating, training and support of these Indians\r\nis paid for by the interest accruing to the Indian on a fund of several\r\nmillion dollars in the United States Treasury and belonging to the\r\nOjibwa of Minnesota. It has been pointed out by other observers, and\r\nemphasized in addresses at Lake Mohonk and elsewhere, that this fund is\r\na curse rather than a blessing. The mixed-blood element, controlled by a\r\nfew shrewd French-Canadians, wish to secure possession of it; attorneys\r\nare attracted by its presence; the young men and women, in some cases,\r\nwill not work since they expect to be supported out of the fund. It\r\nshould be divided up per capita among the Indians. The Government should\r\ncontrol, or supervise, the portions belonging to Indians known to be\r\nincompetent or drunkards, and instead of paying them money, give them\r\ngroceries and clothing until their portion of the fund is exhausted.\r\nCouncils should be called on all reservations, or at central points, on\r\nallotment groups, and the Indians made to understand that with the\r\npayment of this money, responsibility on the part of the United States\r\nceases,—excepting in the case of incompetents, referred to above.\r\n\r\nWith the dreadful lesson of White Earth, staring everyone in the face,\r\nit is incomprehensible that Red Lake should be allotted, and the timber\r\nissued to the Indians. Yet there was a determined effort to bring about\r\nsuch a result, and it was only through opposition of the Indian Office,\r\nand Inspector E. B. Linnen and others that the steal was prevented.\r\n\r\nThe Indians live in frame and log dwellings. The birch-bark wigwam is\r\nrare—save for summer residence. Ordinary “store clothes” are worn by all\r\npersons. The birch-bark canoe still persists, and there are some\r\nsurvivals of ancient customs. Such a majority of the people speak\r\nEnglish and live like the lower classes of Caucasians, that the bands\r\nmay be considered less Indian than the Sioux, and much less primitive\r\nthan the Navaho. The photographs prove this statement.\r\n\r\nLet us look backward and compare conditions of the ’80’s and of\r\n1905–’12.\r\n\r\nRev. Joseph A. Gilfillan was a missionary in northern Minnesota for\r\ntwenty-five years. He became entirely familiar with the Ojibwa language\r\nand spoke it fluently. He is a quiet, modest man. The Indians told me of\r\nnumbers of heroic actions on his part during the twenty-five years he\r\nlabored in and about White Earth reservation. During the spring of one\r\nyear, when the ice on the lake was breaking up, two white men were in a\r\nmost perilous situation, and although there were larger and stronger men\r\nstanding about, no one would venture out to save the lives of the\r\nunfortunates. Gilfillan went out—although he frequently broke through\r\nthe ice—and managed to bring both men ashore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUILDINGS PINE POINT, WHITE EARTH, MINNESOTA\r\n\r\n  Built and formerly occupied by Rev. James Gilfillan as a school. Now\r\n    used as Government School.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, he was held up by several armed men, sent out by\r\nthe mixed-blood and French-Canadian element, who opposed his missionary\r\nlabors. In fact, one of the men presented a gun and threatened to shoot\r\nhim if he continued in his determination to preach to the Indians that\r\nSunday. The above incidents (and more could be related) give an idea of\r\nthe character of this worthy man. He has never been engaged in any of\r\nthe disputes regarding the deplorable situation among the Minnesota\r\nOjibwa, and it required considerable urging on my part to persuade him\r\nto testify before the Congressional Investigation Committee of which\r\nHonorable James Graham was Chairman.\r\n\r\nRev. Gilfillan, largely at his own expense, built splendid schoolhouses,\r\nmissions and chapels at Pine Point, White Earth and Twin Lakes. His\r\nmission was successful and he had at one time several hundred Indians in\r\nattendance in both school and church, and a corps of efficient workers.\r\nI think it is correct to state that there were more church members on\r\nWhite Earth reservation during Gilfillan’s administration than at the\r\npresent time. Certainly the moral tone was far above that which obtains\r\ntoday. It is sad to relate that Gilfillan’s missions were discontinued,\r\nand the buildings where he devoted so many years of unselfish labor were\r\ntaken over by the United States Government at far less than their actual\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nRev. Gilfillan’s statement made to me, and accepted by the Congressional\r\nCommittee[9] and published in their report is as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                       WASHINGTON, D. C., DEC. 9, 1910\r\n\r\n  “Hon. Warren K. Moorehead,\r\n        Andover, Mass.\r\n\r\n  “My dear Sir: Your favor of 8th instant has just reached me, and it\r\n  gives me pleasure to answer your inquiries. The first is, ‘While\r\n  there was much suffering when you were missionary at White Earth,\r\n  Pine Point, Twin Lakes, etc., is it not your opinion that there was\r\n  less swindling than at the present time?’\r\n\r\n  “In answer I would say that I do not consider there was any\r\n  suffering at all to speak of from June, 1873, when I went there,\r\n  till along toward 1898, when I left. The Indians raised garden\r\n  produce; many had fine fields of wheat. They could gather all the\r\n  wild rice they wanted to; fish were abundant. Some of the men made\r\n  two or three hundred dollars by the muskrat hunt each spring. They\r\n  made a good deal by furs. Some hunters killed as many as forty deer\r\n  in a winter. They made maple sugar. They had all the berries they\r\n  could gather. From all these varied sources they made a good living.\r\n  They had unlimited fuel at their doors. They were rent free. I have\r\n  heard people say, and I believe it, that there was not nearly so\r\n  much poverty or suffering as in a white city, where the poor have\r\n  only one resource—wages. If they had wished to raise a little more\r\n  vegetables, as potatoes, corn, etc., they could have lived on the\r\n  fat of the land. They were in those days happy, peaceful, and\r\n  contented communities. To the above-enumerated sources of income of\r\n  theirs I omitted to mention that there passed through my hands for\r\n  them, given by the Episcopal mission, more than $130,000 in money\r\n  for all imaginable purposes—from spectacles to building churches for\r\n  them and supporting their children in schools. There were several\r\n  thousand dollars’ worth of clothing sent me for them by charitable\r\n  people. There was no crime during the twenty-five years I was there,\r\n  although for many years there was not even Indian police. There was\r\n  no instance of holdup or robbery, not to speak of greater offenses.\r\n  Life and property were absolutely safe—far safer than in any white\r\n  community I know. None of them would ever have thought of molesting\r\n  anyone. They were in those days happy, peaceful, harmless people. As\r\n  to how the present state contrasts with that, you have been out\r\n  there lately and know better than I.\r\n\r\n  “As to your second question, whether there was less swindling than\r\n  at the present time, I would say that then there was none at all.\r\n  The Indians had no lands to sell; no property of any kind except\r\n  their little patches of gardens, their little furs, wild rice, etc.\r\n  There was nothing to tempt the cupidity of the white man. As to how\r\n  that contrasts with the present, you have been out there and know\r\n  better than I.\r\n\r\n  “But I ought to qualify this by saying that for some years in the\r\n  nineties there was a great deal of swindling from them unwittingly\r\n  perpetrated by the Government, for an account of which I refer you\r\n  to my inclosed printed statement made to Mohonk Conference in 1898,\r\n  which you will find on Page 13 of the inclosed pamphlet. And that\r\n  you may know that the statements made therein are true, I may inform\r\n  you that the then Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Hon. William\r\n  Jones, who went to the ground and personally investigated, endorsed\r\n  upon that statement: ‘I find that the statements herein made by Mr.\r\n  Gilfillan are in the main correct.’ This indorsement does not appear\r\n  on the copy I send you, but is on other copies. To briefly specify\r\n  the heads under which this swindling was done: it was; First, by\r\n  billeting upon them three Chippewa commissioners at $39 a day for\r\n  the three, making with their clerks, etc., $88 a day, the Indians\r\n  said; said commissioners being mostly politicians out of a job, and\r\n  their positions almost sinecures. Secondly, by repeated farcical\r\n  ‘estimating’ of their pine; three several ‘estimations’ (pretended),\r\n  covering a period of perhaps nine years; two of said estimations\r\n  costing $360,000, and then done dishonestly in the interests of\r\n  those who bought the pine, whereas the real worth of the work, done\r\n  honestly, was only $6,000. Thirdly, by cutting green pine, but\r\n  paying for it as ‘dead and down’ pine, so getting for it\r\n  seventy-five cents a thousand instead of five dollars a thousand.\r\n  But most destructive of all was the swindling done by fire; the\r\n  timber being fired to allow of its being cut as ‘dead and down’ and\r\n  paid for at seventy-five cents a thousand instead of five dollars.\r\n  It was a pitiful sight to see those magnificent pine forests, where\r\n  I used to ride for seventy miles on a stretch through great pine\r\n  woods, shapely and tall, the trees reaching up, it seemed, 100 feet,\r\n  that, like the buffalo, could never be replaced, now all blackened\r\n  and scarred, killed and dead. The glory of the State of Minnesota\r\n  was gone when in the nineties her magnificent pine forests that\r\n  covered so large an area of her northern part were fired to get the\r\n  Indians’ pine for seventy-five cents a thousand.\r\n\r\n  “Now, as to your next question, whether there was more drinking\r\n  among the Indians then than now. I am glad to say that for many\r\n  years after 1873, when I first knew them, there was, one may say, no\r\n  drinking among the Indians. The mixed-bloods, who were mostly\r\n  French-Canadian mixed bloods, always drank a little, but the Indians\r\n  were remarkably free from it. The White Earth Indians lived\r\n  twenty-two miles from the railroad, the nearest place where they\r\n  could get liquor; they were almost that distance from the nearest\r\n  white men. The Red Lake Indians were one hundred miles from the\r\n  railroad, the Cass Lake one hundred, the Leech Lake seventy miles.\r\n  They were almost as far from any white men, except the Government\r\n  employees and the missionaries. So they were secluded from the white\r\n  man and his vices. But the great reason of their immunity was the\r\n  missions. The influence of the Gospel and the church in their\r\n  secluded position kept them safe. It is no reflection on the White\r\n  Earth Indians to say that in the place from which they had been\r\n  removed in 1868—Crow Wing—they had fallen most dreadfully under the\r\n  dominion of the ‘firewater,’ both men and women. They were in a most\r\n  dreadful state of degradation from that cause. But never was the\r\n  power of the Gospel more signally shown than in their cleansing and\r\n  renovation on the White Earth reservation. I never saw a drunken\r\n  Indian nor even one that I thought had tasted liquor. They had\r\n  become communicants of the church, had their family prayers, their\r\n  weekly prayer meetings from house to house, where they exhorted each\r\n  other to steadfastness in the Christian life. What had such a people\r\n  to do with liquor? Some of them, who at Crow Wing had been in the\r\n  lowest depths, told me that they had not tasted liquor in twenty\r\n  years, others for other periods; and I know they told the truth.\r\n  Among all the chiefs, numbering perhaps twenty, on White Earth\r\n  Reservation, there was just one who drank, and he, I am informed,\r\n  had the liquor supplied to him by a mixed-blood, who, in payment,\r\n  got him to swing the Indians to his schemes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OJIBWA, BLIND, FROM TRACHOMA, PINE POINT, WHITE EARTH RESERVATION,\r\n    MINNESOTA\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “But into this fair garden of temperance Satan drew his shining\r\n  trail and toward the last years of my residence there sadly marred\r\n  it. It was found that much money could be made out of Indians\r\n  drinking, and it soon grew up into a most profitable industry. It\r\n  came about in this way: Congress, as everybody knows, passed a law\r\n  that liquor should not be sold or given to Indians. A set of men\r\n  arose who saw the money there was in that; they arrested Indians who\r\n  had taken a drink, or as witnesses, took them to St. Paul or Duluth,\r\n  fiddled with them a little, and then presented a bill of $400, I\r\n  believe, to the Government for each Indian, which money was paid,\r\n  and they divided it up among them. The Indians had all the whisky\r\n  they wanted while under the care of these deputy marshals, as they\r\n  were called; they kept drunk while with them, and they brought\r\n  plenty of liquor home with them to the reservations when they\r\n  returned. They did not want to stop the Indians drinking; they\r\n  encouraged it; the more drinking the more cases and the more money\r\n  for them. This was found so profitable that it grew to a monstrous\r\n  height. Once they had, it was said, every adult male Indian on the\r\n  White Earth Reservation in St. Paul in whisky cases, a distance of,\r\n  say 240 miles, and for every one of these men they got perhaps $400.\r\n  The most of the deputy marshals who made the arrests were\r\n  French-Canadian mixed-bloods of the lowest character, nearly all of\r\n  whom openly and frankly drank themselves, though in the eyes of the\r\n  law Indians like the Indians they arrested; and a high official of\r\n  the United States Government told the writer that one of those\r\n  half-breeds made $5,000 a year out of it, as much, perhaps, as the\r\n  salaries of the members of the Cabinet of the United States\r\n  Government. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars or how many\r\n  millions they got out of the Government by this swindle under the\r\n  form of law it would be interesting to know. Some of those\r\n  mixed-bloods worked that gold mine for eighteen years. The loss of\r\n  so much money to the Government was pitiful, but not half so pitiful\r\n  as the terrible demoralization of the Indians by the operations of\r\n  those men. Here again the good intentions of the Government in\r\n  passing that law, that liquor must not be given or sold to Indians,\r\n  was turned into death and destruction to them, and became most\r\n  bitter gall in its carrying out by the agents of the Government to\r\n  enrich themselves.\r\n\r\n  “So the answer to your question as to whether the Indians drank more\r\n  then or now must be that in the early years after 1873, when there\r\n  was just one honest white deputy marshal named Nichols, they drank\r\n  practically none at all, most of them never tasting it for years;\r\n  but that later, after the swarm of mixed-blood deputy marshals\r\n  arose, there was much drinking under the manipulation of those men,\r\n  restrained, however, by their very great lack of money, for at that\r\n  time none of them had got any.\r\n\r\n  “As to your other question, namely, the relative healthfulness of\r\n  the Indians then and now, I would say that there was always much\r\n  tuberculosis among them, owing to their crowding into one-room\r\n  cabins, heated very hot in the winter, without ventilation; and if\r\n  there was one tubercular patient, that one was spitting over\r\n  everything, so that if there was one sick in a family he or she\r\n  almost necessarily communicated the infection to everyone who was\r\n  infectible. They say that formerly, when they lived practically in\r\n  the open air, winter and summer, in their birch-bark wigwams, though\r\n  in a 40–degrees-below-zero temperature in winter, and lived on a\r\n  flesh diet, that consumption was unknown among them; but in the\r\n  transition state, when shut up in the one-room cabin, living on salt\r\n  pork and heavy bread, and in many other unsanitary ways, the ravages\r\n  of consumption have been serious. Whether worse now than in the days\r\n  from 1873 to 1898 I do not know. I only remember a few who had sore\r\n  eyes, which I suppose was trachoma, in those days.\r\n\r\n  “Believe me, very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     “J. A. GILFILLAN”\r\n\r\nThere has always been a conflict between the full-bloods and\r\nmixed-bloods of Minnesota, and especially at White Earth reservation.\r\nThis dates from the migration of a number of mixed-blood Indians\r\n(chiefly French-Canadian) from Canada. They have caused no end of\r\ntrouble, and by clever manoeuvering dominated the councils.\r\n\r\nThe favorite chief of the entire Ojibwa nation was Hole-in-the-Day. He\r\nbecame war chief in 1846. The Indians talk of him even at the present\r\nday, and the story of Ojibwa, presented towards the end of this book,\r\nwill be found of interest in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe Indians told me, during the investigation of 1909, who were\r\nresponsible for the murder of this fine old chief, but they were\r\nunwilling to testify, fearing the vengeance of the French-Canadian\r\nelement. The following interesting communication, from one in authority,\r\nclears up the murder of Hole-in-the-Day, and explains the hostility\r\nbetween the scheming mixed-bloods, and the honest, although ignorant\r\nfull-bloods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN SCHOOL CHILDREN IN UNIFORM, PINE POINT WHITE EARTH, MINNESOTA\r\n]\r\n\r\n“During the summer of 1912 Mr. James T. Shearman was detailed by the\r\nHonorable Secretary of the Interior to secure testimony concerning the\r\neighty-six mixed-blood Indians suspended from the White Earth rolls. At\r\nthis hearing certain testimony was given that may be of interest to you,\r\nas it explains the assassination of the then head chief of all the\r\nChippewas, Hole-in-the-Day, who was killed at Crow Wing by a party of\r\nLeech Lake Indians in 1886. At this hearing an old, blind Indian\r\ntestified that Clement Beaulieu, father of Gus Beaulieu, Albert\r\nFairbanks, uncle of Ben Fairbanks, and certain other mixed-bloods\r\nemployed him and other Indians then living at Leech Lake to go to Crow\r\nWing and kill Chief Hole-in-the-Day, agreeing to pay the Indians $2000\r\nfor the deed. They went to Crow Wing and killed him according to\r\nagreement. Later, when the mixed-bloods refused to pay the price agreed\r\nupon, they organized another party and came to White Earth, intending to\r\nkill Beaulieu and certain other mixed-blood families. Upon their arrival\r\nhere they were induced by the present Head Chief, Me-zhuck-ke-ge-shig,\r\nwho was related to one of the party, to return to Leech Lake. After this\r\nold, blind Indian finished his story, Me-zhuck-ke-ge-shig, now about\r\nninety years of age, went upon the stand and confirmed the testimony of\r\nthe former witness. Mr. Shearman’s report is probably on file in the\r\nSecretary’s office, and I am informed that a brief of the testimony was\r\nmade by Mr. E. C. O’Brien of the Department of Justice, and you can\r\nprobably obtain a copy of the same.\r\n\r\n“Since Mr. Shearman was here on the matter referred to, I have been\r\nfurnished additional testimony concerning the killing of\r\nHole-in-the-Day. It appears that the party left Leech Lake under the\r\npretext of going hunting, there being nine in the party, and that only\r\nfour of them were in the plot to kill Hole-in-the-Day. When they got to\r\nthe Crow Wing country May-dway-we-mind said: “Hole-in-the-Day dies\r\ntoday.” Later, they met him about a mile and a half from the Crow Wing\r\nAgency at a branch of the two roads, where he was killed. After the deed\r\nwas done, one of the party named Ay-nah-me-ay-gah-bow asked why he had\r\nbeen killed. The answer was that they were told to do it and that there\r\nwas a reward for killing him, that each one of the party was to get a\r\nthousand dollars and a nice house built for him, and the one who shot\r\nfirst was to take Hole-in-the-Day’s place as Head Chief. The man who\r\nasked the first question also asked who offered the reward and he was\r\ntold that Clement Beaulieu (father of Gus H. Beaulieu), Albert Fairbanks\r\n(uncle of Ben L. Fairbanks), ——[10] with others, were the men.\r\n\r\n“Me-zhuck-ke-gwon-abe or Jim Bassett also stated that about four years\r\nafter the killing he came with May-dway-we-mind, Num-ay-we-ne-nee,\r\nWay-zow-e-ko-nah-yay, O-didh-quay-ge-shig and Day-dah-tub-aun-gay to\r\nWhite earth for the money that had been offered as a reward and which\r\nthey did not obtain.\r\n\r\n“It is a matter of history that Hole-in-the-Day was opposed to the\r\nadmission of the mixed-bloods to this reservation and that he was killed\r\nat their instigation, and there has been irrepressible friction between\r\nthese Indians ever since.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Three Years Among the Comanches; Albany, 1859.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Hearings before a subcommittee of the Committee on Expenditures in the\r\n  Interior Department, House of Representatives.

THE LEGAL COMPLICATIONS AT WHITE EARTH—THE DEPARTMENT OF\r\n                                JUSTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Marsden C. Burch, representing the Attorney General of the United\r\nStates (Department of Justice) before the Committee on Expenditures in\r\nthe Interior Department, House of Representatives, went into modern\r\nOjibwa history at great length. The hearings began July 25, 1911, and\r\ncontinued through March 27, 1912. The testimony lies before me, and it\r\nfills 2,759 pages. It would be well nigh impossible for readers to\r\nconsult this enormous bulk of evidence submitted by several hundred\r\nwitnesses. He found, as have others, that they moved into Minnesota from\r\nthe head of Lake Superior some seventy years ago. About 1868 the White\r\nEarth reservation was established, and the following bands were located\r\nat White Earth, Leech Lake, Red Lake, and Cass Lake in Minnesota: the\r\nMississippi; the Otter Tails; the Pillagers; and a few Indians still\r\nclaiming they belonged to the Lake Superior band and the Fond du Lac\r\nband. The White Earth reservation consisted of thirty-six townships, or\r\n829,440 acres. The population in 1909 was 5,300; about 700 full-bloods\r\nand 4,600 mixed-bloods. Those who have traveled over it will agree with\r\nJudge Burch’s statement.\r\n\r\n“I have never seen a more beautiful stretch of territory than that\r\nembraced in the present White Earth reservation. It contained lakes and\r\nstreams, prairies and forests, timber enough of white pine originally\r\nthere to build all the elegant buildings that might have been needed for\r\ncenturies to come, of the most valuable character—timber which now\r\nconverted into lumber would be worth in the open market, ranging by\r\nvarious grades, from $35 to $110 per thousand feet, board measure. It is\r\nhard wood, ample for fuel and all kinds of purposes. There were marshes\r\nand lakes wherein they could fish, and whereon they could hunt and\r\ngather wild rice for their sustenance; and the richest of prairie lands\r\nimaginable, high, rolling, healthy—everything that could be desired for\r\nthe last stand of a great race.”\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1912, Judge Burch made a longer speech which reviews the\r\nentire political and Departmental history of White Earth.[11] Some\r\nreaders may wish to know a little concerning the legal procedures by\r\nwhich Indians are dispossessed. We will, therefore, take White Earth as\r\nan example, and omit the discussion of similar troubles elsewhere. I\r\npresent about a fourth of his address.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES BASSETT, FULL-BLOOD OJIBWA IN TRIBAL COSTUME\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the Nelson Act was passed. This provided for the collecting of\r\nscattered Ojibwa from ten localities and concentrating them at White\r\nEarth, Red Lake and Leech Lake. Judge Burch enters into a lengthy\r\ndiscussion of how the Nelson Act was followed by a bill introduced by\r\nSenator Clapp, and that in January, 1904, Representative Steenerson of\r\nMinnesota introduced another bill. Of this the Judge says:—\r\n\r\n“Under the terms of this Steenerson Act each Indian who had received an\r\nallotment on the White Earth Reservation or was entitled thereto should\r\nhave an additional allotment sufficient to make the original and\r\nadditional total 160 acres, provided that if there should not be enough\r\nland for 160 acres each, the additional allotments should contain only\r\nso much land as could be allotted by dividing the total remaining\r\nallotable land by the number of eligible allottees.\r\n\r\n“We expect to show that of this White Earth Reservation there was an\r\narea of lake surface aggregating 59,731.24 acres; also that there is\r\nclaimed as swamp land going to the State as part of its quota under the\r\norganic law of Congress 26,658.15 acres. The allotments additional under\r\nthe Steenerson Act were made by one Simon Michelet, the White Earth\r\nIndian Superintendent, or Agent, at that time. By omitting the two items\r\nof lake land and State swamp land from consideration, he figured that\r\nthere was sufficient territory practically to furnish each allottee the\r\nfull 160 acres of land, and thus he proceeded to allot to those who\r\nfirst came to be served the total of 160 acres; of course, including all\r\nthe valuable pine upon the reservation.\r\n\r\n“We expect to show that those who were thus favored by these complete\r\nadditional allotments were largely composed of persons who could be\r\nhandled in the matter of purchase of the timber by the representatives\r\nof the lumber companies that had procured the greater portion of the\r\ntimber in the four townships. Large numbers of persons eligible to\r\nadditional allotments, but who came later, were denied the same because\r\nthere was no land left for them, there being 31,516.88 acres lacking. It\r\nwill thus be seen that the so-called additional allotment under Michelet\r\nwas a fraud upon the rights of from 400 to 500 Indians who were\r\nabsolutely left out in the cold. In addition to this, it would seem that\r\nthe allotments made included the 59,000 odd acres of lake land, thus\r\nincreasing the fraud upon those who were not favored with pine in these\r\nadditional allotments. The allotment was, of course, in direct violation\r\nof the Steenerson Act itself. It is a matter of question whether those\r\nwho had knowledge of and participated in the benefits arising from these\r\nillegal allotments can not be yet reached by a court of equity and they\r\ncompelled to account for their misdeeds.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“No machinery for carrying into effect the Clapp amendment was provided\r\ntherein, and thus it remained to be determined who were and who were not\r\nadults of the mixed-blood and freed from restraint as to alienation. The\r\nresult was that designing persons rushed in and obtained deeds and\r\nmortgages indiscriminately; that is, from children of the mixed-blood\r\nand adults of the full-blood the same as adults of the mixed-blood. In\r\nall of these they were accustomed to recite the competency of the\r\nIndian, and attached to the deed in each case they usually secured what\r\npurported to be the affidavit of two persons that the allottee was an\r\nadult Indian of the mixed blood, which affidavits were ordinarily passed\r\nwith the deed in making mesne conveyances or in recording in the proper\r\ncounty recording office. In connection with these transactions we shall\r\nbe able to demonstrate to the committee that every variety of fraudulent\r\nschemes and devices which would occur naturally to acute minds was\r\nresorted to to defraud the Indians. The taking of these deeds in\r\nviolation of law from minors of the mixed-blood and from full-bloods\r\neventuated in the action of the Government in requiring the Department\r\nof Justice to file about 1,200 bills in equity to remove the clouds from\r\nthe titles to lands thus unlawfully obtained.\r\n\r\n“Following upon the sudden acquirement of money by persons in some\r\nrespects less fitted to handle the same and make proper use of it than\r\nwhite children of tender years, there came a condition of affairs which\r\nwe expect to demonstrate to the committee as most deplorable and\r\nshameful, a stain upon the fair fame of a great and enlightened State.\r\nSaloons ran wide open. Cheap and tawdry articles were sold at\r\nextravagant prices. The Indians were overreached, and the money they had\r\nobtained from selling or mortgaging their lands or timber was coaxed\r\nfrom them in exchange for objects of little or no value, but of supposed\r\nutility—such as decrepit horses, defective vehicles, unmanageable sewing\r\nmachines, and even pianos of little worth. A perfect frenzy of\r\ndrunkenness characterized many who took their way to the neighboring\r\ntown of Detroit, and encamped in its vicinity, and practically the same\r\nconditions occurred in the hamlets along the Soo Road. The land-shark,\r\npassing under the more dignified title of real-estate agent, was\r\neverywhere in evidence, and the money-loaning shark, posing under the\r\nmore dignified business appellation of banker, was engaged in\r\nover-reaching the Indian right and left.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“From the close of 1906 or 1907, when isolated transactions were going\r\non, the fiercest of the fraud and debauchery had subsided, till the\r\nsummer of 1909 a condition like that of the quiet which succeeds a\r\nprolonged intoxication occurred. The Indians had mainly, in one form or\r\nanother, parted with their heritage and in most instances, had suffered\r\nseverely from the result. Poverty, sickness, a sense of mortification\r\nand loss at the hands of the white men pervaded their minds and\r\ndepressed their spirits. The pine again, as in the case of the four\r\ntownships, by clean-cut lines of apparent division had shown up in the\r\nownership and possession as to certain territory (and this the largest\r\nand most valuable part) of the Nichols-Chisolm Lumber Co.—pine reputed\r\nin extent to be of the amount of 150,000,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DISPOSSESSED OJIBWA AT REAR OF AGENCY BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n  Rice River, White Earth, Minn., 1909.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Pine in another clean-cut and well-defined territory, reputed to amount\r\nto about 50,000,000 feet, was found to be in the possession and under\r\nthe control of the Park Rapids Lumber Co.; and in still another section,\r\nequally well defined in its boundary line, a reputed 50,000,000 feet was\r\ncontrolled by the Wild Rice Lumber Co. Likewise the best of the\r\nagricultural lands had fallen into the hands of, or under the control\r\nof, the so-called bankers at the hamlets before mentioned, and certain\r\nmen of great wealth and influence resident in the city of Duluth, as\r\nwell as in St. Paul and Minneapolis.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“The first result of the treaties of 1889 was the saddling upon the\r\nChippewas of an allotting commission of three members and a large\r\nretinue of subordinates. The expense of this commission was $88 a day,\r\nand the work that the commission and its subordinates accomplished could\r\ndoubtless have easily been done by an allotting clerk at $1,000 a year.\r\nBesides this commission many other white officials were sent to the\r\nreservations, ostensibly to supervise the cutting of the timber and on\r\nmany other pretexts, for all of which the Indians had to pay. A corps of\r\nestimators, each drawing $6 a day of the Indians’ money, was appointed\r\nto estimate the pine on the Red Lake Reservation. Fraud having been\r\ndiscovered in making this estimate, a new corps of estimators, numbering\r\nabout twenty-six, was appointed to do the work over again. Each of the\r\nnew corps also received $6 per day of the Indians’ money.\r\n\r\n“The new corps proved to be grossly incompetent. They were always well\r\nsupplied with whiskey and drank heavily. They spent most of their time\r\nin towns fifteen or twenty miles distant from the pine they were sent to\r\nestimate. Some of the interlopers were members of this corps of\r\nexaminers, and, though they absented themselves for long periods of\r\ntime, they still drew their pay. It has been asserted that the total\r\ncost to the Indians of these two corps of estimators was $350,000 and\r\nthat the real value of their work was about $6,000; that in many cases\r\nthe pine had been underestimated in the interest of the purchasers. The\r\nsecond corps of estimators were likewise discharged and a third corps\r\nappointed to go over the work previously done. Like the celebrated case\r\nof Jarndice v. Jarndice, it seems that after all the proceedings were\r\nover, although the pine alone on the reservations, exclusive of that on\r\nthe White Earth Reservation, was supposed to be worth from $25,000,000\r\nto $50,000,000, there would be little or nothing left but heirs.\r\nAlthough an Indian entitled to a share of the immense value of these\r\nlands and forests might be starving to death, he could not procure two\r\ncents from his great wealth to buy a pound of flour.\r\n\r\n“While the proceeds from the sale of the pine was thus being squandered,\r\nthe Indians were also being defrauded by the loggers and lumbermen who\r\nwere purchasing the timber. By the conspiracy at the Crookston sale in\r\n1900, the Indians doubtless lost several thousand dollars, and by the\r\nfraudulent operations under the so-called ‘dead and down’ act, they lost\r\neven a greater sum.\r\n\r\n“Another source of complaint on the part of the real Indians of\r\nMinnesota is the payment of annuities to persons whom the Indians\r\ncontend are not members of their tribe, and whose names are not properly\r\nupon the tribal rolls, and who consequently had no rights thereto.\r\n\r\n“Another grievance of which the real Indians bitterly complain and which\r\nwas the immediate cause of the outbreak of the Pillagers in 1898,\r\nresulting in the killing of a major and six soldiers of the United\r\nStates Army, and the wounding of many others, was the conduct of certain\r\nmixed-blood deputy marshals, several of whom it is claimed by the\r\nIndians were persons who had improperly been placed upon their tribal\r\nrolls. These deputy marshals originated and developed, as we shall\r\nexpect to show, a system of arresting and transporting to St. Paul,\r\nDuluth, and Detroit various members of the tribe, charging them either\r\nwith bringing whiskey upon the reservation or with some other like\r\noffense. We expect to show that the purpose of these mixed-blood deputy\r\nmarshals was to secure fees for making such arrests and for bringing\r\nother Indians to the said cities as witnesses against the Indians\r\naccused. The practice continued for some years, until finally, as we\r\nexpect to show, a member of the Pillager Band was arrested in this\r\nmanner and taken to Duluth. He was left at Duluth without money to buy\r\nfood or to buy transportation home, and compelled to walk back to the\r\nreservation, a distance of more than 200 miles. When he arrived at the\r\nreservation he was nearly dead from exposure and starvation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“An instance of the manner in which the Minnesota Indians have been made\r\nthe instruments or causes for defrauding the Government through\r\nCongress, in the interests of attorneys, and these same parties who have\r\nbeen so often suggested, is the Mille Lac Indian case. An appropriation\r\nof $40,000 was secured through an act of Congress ostensibly for the\r\nrelief of the Mille Lac Indians as a payment for certain alleged\r\nimprovements made by them upon the Mille Lac Reservation. The matter\r\ncame up this way:\r\n\r\n“In 1854 the Mille Lac Band ceded their reservation to the Government.\r\nIn 1862, when Chief Hole-in-the-Day advised a combination with the Sioux\r\nfor an uprising against the Government, these Indians refused to\r\nparticipate on account of their ancient enmity with the Sioux. To reward\r\nthem for their loyalty the President promised them they might still\r\nremain on their reservation as long as they did not interfere with the\r\nWhites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GROUP OF THIRTY PERSONS CONSTITUTING LINNEN-MOOREHEAD FORCE WHITE\r\n    EARTH INVESTIGATION, 1909\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Under the Nelson Act, in the treaty of 1889, they ceded this privilege\r\nof occupancy to the Government, but some portions of them refused to\r\nremove to White Earth, claiming that they had never really ceded\r\nanything to the Government. As an inducement for these parties to leave,\r\nCongress was persuaded to appropriate $40,000, or so much thereof as\r\nmight be necessary for the purpose, to pay these parties for the\r\nimprovements they had made during their occupancy of the reservation.\r\n(32 Stat. L. 268.) Michelet and this same ——[12] went over for the\r\nGovernment to investigate and appraise the improvements, and found\r\npractically none—nothing but the charred remains of some Indian tipis;\r\nbut to eat up, that is, to cover the entire $40,000, these charred\r\nremains were appraised at the original cost of the tipis, and items were\r\ninserted in the list of improvements, such as the profit an Indian would\r\nmake gathering wild rice for a year, for gathering wild honey for a like\r\nperiod, and other like items. Now, the real disposition of the money\r\nseems to have been as follows:\r\n\r\n“First, $4,000 was paid to Gus H. Beaulieu for attorney’s fees, $2,500\r\nwas paid to D. B. Henderson as attorney’s fees, and $1,500 to D. B.\r\nHenderson for expenses. Four chiefs received $1,000 each. About $17,000\r\nwas then prorated among the Indians; $10,020 then remained in the hands\r\nof Gus H. Beaulieu.\r\n\r\n“It then became necessary for the Mille Lac Indians to employ another\r\nset of attorneys to sue Beaulieu for the $10,020. After considerable\r\nexpensive litigation, Beaulieu deposited $5,600 to the credit of the\r\nMille Lac Band in the Merchants National Bank of St. Cloud, Minn., and\r\npaid $1,000 to the Indians’ attorneys.\r\n\r\n“The traders in the vicinity of the Mille Lac Reservation then commenced\r\nsuit for the money so deposited, claiming that the individual members of\r\nthe band owed them money for goods. Again a compromise was effected with\r\nthe result that a portion of the $5,600 was turned over to Agent\r\nMichelet for distribution. There is now about $208 waiting for the\r\nclaimants.\r\n\r\n“We think this is indicative of the way in which Congress has\r\ncontributed innocently from the public funds to the support and\r\nenrichment of a few persons of little or no merit, by a species of\r\npretense of recompensing the Indians who, in the end, have slight\r\nparticipation in the generous provisions so by Congress made.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Hearings before the Committee on Expenditures in the Interior\r\n  Department of the House of Representatives, H.

THE WHITE EARTH SCANDAL\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Burch’s research led him to conclude that the Indians were in\r\nvastly better shape forty years ago than at the present time. The\r\nreading of Warren’s book, Gilfillan’s testimony, and other evidence\r\nestablishes it beyond question that the Indian does not seem to have\r\nsuffered to any great extent in either health or morals prior to 1880.\r\nThe older men of the tribe, who were keen mentally in spite of great\r\nage, when I visited those Indians in 1909, told me much regarding their\r\npast. I visited them under most auspicious circumstances, being\r\nempowered by the Indian Office to conduct investigations of affairs at\r\nWhite Earth, and having at my command numerous interpreters and\r\nassistants. The old shaman, Bay-bah-dwun-gay-aush, Me-zhuck-ke-ge-shig,\r\nOjibwa,[13] Mah-een-gonce, and others with whom I talked a great deal,\r\nlaid the blame for their present deplorable condition on the\r\nunscrupulous French-Canadians, mixed-blood element, as well as covetous\r\nwhite men who sought timber and land. Gilfillan has pointed out in his\r\nletter the increase of drunkenness due to large financial rewards\r\noffered by the Government in pursuing a mistaken policy.\r\n\r\nFather Aloysius Hermanutz has been at White Earth since 1878. In his\r\ntestimony before the Graham Investigating Committee, he stated that the\r\nfull-blood Indians at that time were in good condition. Nearly everyone\r\nowned a team of oxen, a cow, and cultivated fields. Many of them raised\r\nvegetables and there was much weaving of rugs and small carpets. They\r\nhad an Agent, Mr. Charles Ruffey, who was kind to them but very strict.\r\nThe farmer was a competent man and knew how to make Indians work.\r\n\r\n“I met him one day on the road on horseback. He went to that Indian—to\r\nthat farm—I met him there and asked him where he was going, and he said:\r\n‘There are two Indians, Father, up beyond that church. They didn’t plow\r\ntheir field in order to put the seeds in, and the Agent ordered me to\r\ntell them if they don’t plow their fields now (it was in April) that the\r\nteam will be taken away from them.’ And of course they were oldtimers.\r\nThat was Saturday when I saw them, and on Sunday morning they started to\r\nplow. They were scared and they plowed their fields. At the time the\r\nIndians were in very good condition, and then afterwards it changed and\r\nthey went down again.”\r\n\r\nThe illustrations accompanying these chapters were taken during the\r\ninvestigation of 1909 and give some idea of conditions obtaining at that\r\ntime. So much has been said and written regarding the situation of the\r\nMinnesota Ojibwa, that the Government adopted heroic measures, and\r\nconditions are to a great extent ameliorated, but they are still far\r\nfrom satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOmitting the racial traits of the people the past sixty years, let us\r\nconsider their present condition and the causes leading up to it.\r\n\r\nThe 1889 bill (Congress) was known officially: “For the Relief and\r\nCivilization of the Chippewa Indians.” There is both sarcasm and irony\r\nin that phrase, which only those of us who know what kind of “relief and\r\ncivilization” the Chippewas have received since the bill was passed, can\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\nAt the time White Earth reservation was created, a treaty was made with\r\nthe Ojibwa bands, March 19th, 1867. It was the Government’s intention at\r\nthe time this solemn treaty was signed, to encourage progress in\r\nindustry, and to permanently locate the Ojibwa upon farms. With so\r\nlaudable a purpose in view, one of the provisions of this treaty was as\r\nfollows: Any Indian who brought under cultivation ten acres of land, was\r\nentitled to a fee simple patent, or deed, for forty acres additional,\r\nand so on up to 160 acres. This encouraged many Indians to become\r\nindustrious and they brought under cultivation many tracts of land. In\r\n1887, under the Dawes Act, the holdings of agricultural land were\r\nlimited to eighty acres. After the “Relief and Civilization” act of\r\n1889, Gus Beaulieu, a French-Canadian-Indian politician, and others\r\nbecame very active in and about White Earth reservation. A Mr. Darwin S.\r\nHall was appointed Chippewa Commissioner and became interested in Mr.\r\nBeaulieu’s projects.\r\n\r\nWhatever the original purpose of this act, it was used by venal white\r\nmen to get hold of the Indians’ land. Previously the land had all been\r\nin a reservation and could not be touched. Now it was coming under the\r\ncontrol of individual Indians and might be sold.\r\n\r\nThe Indians could not be thrown neck-and-heels off their reservation,\r\nalthough I suppose certain interested persons of northern Minnesota\r\nwould have adopted that happy expedient were it possible. Some kind of\r\nlegislation must be enacted whereby the wolves could enter the flock, if\r\nnot entirely disguised, at least so covered that the shepherd of the\r\nflock might have some difficulty in differentiating between the sheep\r\nand the wolves. So it came about that the “Clapp Amendment” was passed\r\nas a rider to the general Indian appropriation bill. The Clapp amendment\r\nin substance, provided that any mixed-blood Indian could dispose of his\r\nproperty, but full-bloods and minors could not.\r\n\r\nIf either Senator Clapp or Congressman Steenerson ever endeavored to put\r\nan end to the abuses resulting from the passage of this legislation\r\ntheir efforts have failed to accomplish results. I never heard that\r\nanyone in Congress tried to remedy the evils following the passage of\r\nthese bills. Two of the missionaries, Rev. Felix Nelles of Pine Point\r\nand Rev. Aloysius Hermanutz of White Earth, wrote to the Indian Office,\r\nprotesting that the Indians were being swindled out of their property.\r\nBut Father Felix reports to me by letter that so far as he is aware\r\nneither the protest of himself nor his superior, Father Aloysius, had\r\nany effect.\r\n\r\nWhen the Act of 1867, establishing White Earth reservation, and which\r\nJudge Burch has discussed, was put into effect, a great number of\r\nIndians by hard work, notably the chief of the entire five living bands\r\nof Chippewa, a grand old man, whose name is Me-zhuck-ke-ge-shig, took\r\nadvantage of this and earned many acres of land. This chief was looked\r\nup to by the Indians, was a good man himself, and many of his friends\r\nfollowed his example, worked hard and earned forty, eighty or one\r\nhundred and sixty acres. Imagine the surprise of these Indians when, at\r\nthe time the pine lumber was allotted, some one in Washington announced\r\nthat the Indians who had received farm lands could not participate in\r\nthe pine allotting. In other words, the French-Canadians, the\r\nmixed-bloods and such full-bloods as had not worked and were not\r\nindustrious, received pine tracts valued from few to many thousands of\r\ndollars, and those who had obeyed the wishes of the Indian Office, had\r\nadvanced by hard work along the “road to civilization,” were debarred\r\nfrom participation. It was precisely as if a college passed its drones\r\nand conditioned its honor-roll men. No wonder these White Earth Indians\r\ndo not care to work, and say they “cannot understand Washington.” If\r\nwhoever was responsible for such a ruling had sat down and deliberately\r\ntried to figure out the most certain way of injuring the Ojibwa Indians,\r\nhe could not have conceived a better plan.\r\n\r\nImmediately after I was appointed on the Board of Indian Commissioners,\r\na correspondent wrote me from Wisconsin that the Ojibwa Indians at White\r\nEarth were in bad condition. The Indian Rights Association had made a\r\nsimilar complaint. Rev. Charles Wright, Episcopal missionary at Cass\r\nLake, shortly after the scandals began to develop, on his own\r\nresponsibility borrowed money and in spite of the opposition of the\r\nIndian Agent, Simon Michelet, he went to Washington to lay the\r\ngrievances of the Indians before the President. He bore letters of\r\nintroduction from Governor John A. Johnson and United States Senator\r\nKnute Nelson. The lumber companies, it was supposed, wired the Indian\r\nCommissioner of Wright’s mission. He did not find favor at Washington,\r\nnever succeeded in seeing the President, and sorrowing and sick at heart\r\nhe was compelled to return to Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Indian Commissioners having no funds, I asked the Indian\r\nOffice to appoint me as Special Agent with full powers, and send me to\r\nWhite Earth. This was done about March 1st. I spent five weeks\r\ninvestigating conditions in the southern part of the reservation, Pine\r\nPoint, and returned to Washington the latter part of April, 1909. The\r\nfirst of July, Inspector E. B. Linnen and myself were sent to White\r\nEarth with full authority. We employed a total force of thirty-seven\r\npersons and made a complete investigation.\r\n\r\nDuring the first five weeks at White Earth, save for local employees, I\r\nwas entirely alone. The investigation soon developed that millions of\r\ndollars’ worth of pine timber and farm lands had been stolen from the\r\nIndians. As soon as it was ascertained that I was working in the\r\ninterests of the Indian, the lumber companies and the mixed-blood and\r\nFrench-Canadians attempted in every possible way to end the\r\ninvestigation. They first tried bribery, and later intimidation. They\r\nlured away several of my witnesses, and even some of the Government\r\nemployees informed me that it was hopeless to fight the great land and\r\ntimber interests back of the despoilation of 5,300 Indians. Matters went\r\nfrom bad to worse. Some idea of the physical strain may be had from the\r\nstatement that I lost fifteen pounds weight in five weeks. As the other\r\nInspectors and Special Agents had not reported on White Earth\r\nconditions, the Indian Office could not, at first, believe my story. At\r\nlast, I received a telegram asking me to come to Washington. I had at\r\nthat time one hundred and three affidavits representing more than a\r\nmillion dollars worth of property, and involving county officials,\r\nlumbermen and presidents of national banks. Ill feeling had developed in\r\nthe local towns. The nearest railway station, Park Rapids, was distant\r\neighteen miles. Ogema, on the “Soo Line,” lay forty-five miles to the\r\nnorth. Knowing that the enemy would attempt to prevent the affidavits\r\ngoing East, I started Doctor Isaac Stahlberg, Government physician, for\r\nPark Rapids at noon. He arrived there about half-past three o’clock and\r\nvolunteered the information that I would probably take the 5 o’clock\r\ntrain East.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at 7 o’clock that same morning, in three vehicles, nine of\r\nus, including five armed Indian policemen, started for Ogema to the\r\nnorth. We reached our destination without incident, and I delivered the\r\naffidavits to Commissioner Valentine in Washington two days later.\r\n\r\nHonorable Robert G. Valentine, then Commissioner, took great interest in\r\nthe White Earth affair, supported my contentions, and at his suggestion\r\na very experienced man, Inspector Linnen, returned with me to the scene\r\nof action, as has been stated. We had the hearty cooperation of\r\nSuperintendent John R. Howard, who was appointed early in 1908 and\r\nsucceeded Simon Michelet. Major Howard has filled one of the most\r\ndifficult positions in the entire Indian Service. He has been bitterly\r\nopposed by the mixed-blood element through Beaulieu’s newspaper.\r\nNeighboring towns have organized Boards of Trade, and these have\r\nappealed by committee and through the press to Congress, alleging that\r\nthe Interior Department and Department of Justice have interfered with\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHoward’s position has been no sinecure, and in addition to his other\r\ntroubles, he was given a chief clerk who happened to be a disputatious\r\nperson, who had caused trouble in California, and on arrival at White\r\nEarth became friendly with some of those who were opposing him. This\r\ntense situation was not brought to an end until vigorous protests were\r\nlodged by a number of us at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the great scandal at White Earth is interesting as well\r\nas dramatic. What I have to say in succeeding pages is not in the\r\nofficial language of the report made by Linnen and myself, but is drawn\r\nfrom departmental sources.\r\n\r\nI make this explanation, for I am well aware that what follows will\r\nsound to some readers as a page from Russian, or Turkish, history,\r\nrather than a leaf from the history of one of our own states in our own\r\ngreat and free country!\r\n\r\nThe 24th of April, 1905, was set as the date on which the white, Norway\r\nand other valuable pine tracts would be allotted to the Indians of White\r\nEarth. The word was passed throughout the reservation, and the\r\nFrench-Canadians, who are there in considerable numbers and most of whom\r\nshow very slight trace of Indian blood, were the first to appear.\r\nEducated mixed-blood Indians also arrived some days previous. A line was\r\nformed near the United States Government building door some time\r\nSaturday afternoon. The allotting was to begin Monday morning. It is\r\ninteresting to note that first in the line was Margaret Lynch, a young\r\nwhite girl, whose father and mother were white people, and who, the\r\nIndians properly maintained, had no right to an allotment. The girl\r\nreceived allotment number one, for which her father refused $22,000 cash\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nThe Agent at this time was Simon Michelet. He was possessed of a violent\r\ntemper, according to the sworn testimony of a policeman employed at the\r\nWhite Earth Agency for nearly ten years. Michelet was friendly with Gus\r\nH. Beaulieu, the Nichols-Chisolm Lumber Company and others who were\r\nequally interested in obtaining timber from the White Earth Indians. It\r\nwas bad form, to say the least, for the United States Agent to use his\r\noffice at this time to hold long conferences with the representatives of\r\nthe lumber companies.\r\n\r\nWhat was said behind the closed doors no one knows, but what occurred at\r\nthe time of the allotting sheds a little light on the situation. The\r\nchief clerk of agent Michelet was one J. T. Van Metre. As he resigned\r\nhis position after the timber was allotted and entered the real estate\r\nbusiness, this added another complication to the already confused\r\naffairs at White Earth.\r\n\r\nDuring the allotting of the pine timber there was such confusion, the\r\nline became broken and many people lost their places. My two\r\ninvestigations on the reservation, covering nearly seventeen weeks, lead\r\nme to believe that the most valuable tracts were selected in advance,\r\nand that the names of those who were to have them were entered on a list\r\nfor use at the allotment.\r\n\r\nIn support of this contention is the affidavit of Robert Henry, sworn to\r\nSeptember 24th, 1909, who came early to White Earth at the time of the\r\nallotment and passed into the agent’s office shortly after the allotting\r\nbegan. He held in his hand descriptions of forty or fifty different pine\r\ntracts, and yet was told that all had been selected and he could not\r\nhave a good pine allotment. Not enough people preceded Henry to have\r\ndrawn each of these allotments. The same is true of a woman who had in\r\nher hand fifty descriptions, and she was told that all of these had been\r\nselected. It early in the day became evident that the full-bloods were,\r\nif possible, to be kept from getting any land, for by the Clapp\r\namendment only the mixed-bloods could sell their land.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day when the full-blood Indians were clamoring for\r\nrecognition and insisting that the French-Canadians and white people be\r\nkept back, John St. Luke, the policeman, testifying under oath,\r\nSeptember 24th, 1909, says: “Agent Simon Michelet came out of his office\r\nin an excited manner, and told me to keep the Indians out and let the\r\nmixed-bloods in. There seemed to be confusion in the line. Michelet\r\npushed some of these Indians back, swearing at them, and told me to club\r\nthem if necessary, to keep them from crowding in.” St. Luke refused to\r\ndo this.\r\n\r\nAt last the full-bloods registered a protest, some of the Indians sent\r\nfor their guns, and things took on a serious aspect. Presently by way of\r\ncompromise it was agreed that for every mixed-blood that received a pine\r\nallotment a full-blood should also obtain one. This continued until all\r\nof the twenty or more miles of pine timber had been allotted in tracts\r\nof eighty acres each to the Indians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OJIBWA CHIEF, KE-WAY-DIN, PINE POINT, WHITE EARTH RESERVATION,\r\n    MINNESOTA, 1909\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pine timber allotted these Indians ranged all the way from tracts\r\nworth $2,000 or $3,000 to those valued as high as $25,000. Since the\r\nlands were allotted, iron ore has been found in quantities under certain\r\nparts of the reservation. How extensive are these bodies, no man may\r\nknow, and the value might be a few millions, or many hundreds of\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EVICTED INDIANS, TWIN LAKES, WHITE EARTH RESERVATION, MINNESOTA, 1909\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe effect of the allotment on the Whites near White Earth was\r\nimmediate. Mushroom banks sprang up in the surrounding small towns. The\r\nIndians in their affidavits (of which Linnen and myself took 505)\r\ntestified that lawyers, banks, county officials, and business men of\r\nprominence in Detroit, Ogema, Mahnomen, and other towns, joined in the\r\nscramble to secure their pine lands and farm tracts.\r\n\r\nAs few of these men spoke the language, it was necessary to have\r\ninterpreters, and the educated Indians were soon divided into two camps,\r\nthose who were willing for pay to interpret for the land-sharks and\r\ntimber thieves, and those who would not help in defrauding their own\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to note that in a hundred or more instances the Indians were\r\npurposely made drunk and their lands taken away from them while under\r\nthe influence of liquor. Many of the Indians do not remember what kind\r\nof papers they signed, whether deeds or mortgages, or whether any papers\r\nwere signed at all.\r\n\r\nWhile our investigation was in progress, and we had moved over to Rice\r\nRiver, Mr. J. Weston Allen visited us for three weeks. He came as a\r\nrepresentative of the Boston Indian Citizenship Committee, and because\r\nof his high standing in the legal profession, rendered valuable\r\nassistance in the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe key to the whole situation lay in the question of blood. As has been\r\nshown before, the mixed-bloods only could sell their land. The\r\nfull-bloods could not. Consequently we assembled the old record-keepers,\r\nmedicine men, chiefs, and Indians of prominence who knew their own\r\npeople. Some of these were more than eighty-five years of age and none\r\nof them under seventy. When an Indian appeared before us to give his\r\ntestimony, we first asked him whether he was a full-blood or a\r\nmixed-blood, and the names of his parents and grandparents. The old\r\nwitnesses, probably twelve or fifteen, might not all know the parents or\r\ngrandparents of the Indian testifying. But three, four, six, and\r\nsometimes eight of them would know the family history, and would be able\r\nto swear whether the Indian was a full-blood. If he was a mixed-blood,\r\nwe told him with regret that we could do nothing for him.\r\n\r\nOne affidavit of the Indian himself as to his blood relationship and\r\nparents was taken, another signed by the old witnesses to the same\r\neffect. A third affidavit related to the property possessed by the\r\nIndian, with number and description of allotments, and by careful\r\nquestioning we ascertained when and where he had disposed of his land.\r\nThe fourth affidavit was by the interpreters in which they solemnly\r\ndeclared that they had correctly interpreted our statements to the\r\nIndian and his answers to us, and that he understood the nature of the\r\npapers that he had signed. The interpreters also made further affidavit\r\nthat they had carefully interpreted to the old Indian witnesses the\r\npapers that they signed. In addition to all of the above, we frequently\r\ntook affidavits of Indians who were present during the swindling\r\noperations. Thus it will be seen that the evidence was very complete,\r\npositive and exact. So far as I know, no investigating force on a\r\nreservation had ever done more work in the same length of time. We\r\nlabored from eight o’clock to twelve, one to six, and frequently from\r\nseven until eleven at night.\r\n\r\nThe Indians took great interest in the investigation, and as we moved\r\nfrom one portion of the reservation to another we were accompanied by\r\nlarge numbers of these poor people. On one occasion over eighty Indians\r\nwere present, and we were compelled to turn two large school buildings\r\ninto dormitories.\r\n\r\nThese Indians had lost their property almost without exception. Whether\r\nthe term “swindle” is used or not is immaterial. They lost their\r\nproperty through many and devious ways. The affidavits indicated that in\r\nmany instances Indians appeared before the buyers either drunk or\r\nsomewhat under the influence of liquor. Not only did the interpreters\r\ngive the Indians liquor, but frequently the Indians drank of their own\r\naccord. Of course the bankers, lawyers, county officials and real estate\r\nmen knew that the ordinary code of business ethics would not countenance\r\ntheir dealings with drunken persons. But these land-owners being\r\nIndians, and the sentiment of the thirty-seven individuals and firms who\r\nin the affidavits are shown to be responsible for the conditions at\r\nWhite Earth being against Indians as land-owners, no discrimination was\r\nmade and Indians were permitted to “do business” whether drunk or sober.\r\nNext to drunkenness as a means of separating the Indian from his land,\r\nthe deliberate deceit practised by the buyers stands out conspicuously.\r\nScores of affidavits and statements were taken of Indians who owned two,\r\nthree, five, or even seven or eight trust patents. The trust patent was\r\npreliminary paper, but as trust patents would in the process of time\r\nbecome deeds, the white people did not differentiate and trust patents\r\nwere in most cases accepted the same as deeds. In order to be within the\r\nlaw it was necessary to prove the Indians mixed-bloods. Most of the\r\nIndians were therefore sworn as mixed-bloods. They frequently protested,\r\nstating that they were full-bloods, but were described in the papers as\r\nmixed-bloods just the same. Therefore few of the papers signed by these\r\nIndians were read or interpreted to them, and in the majority of cases,\r\nas the Indian could neither write nor read, he did not know whether he\r\nwas signing receipts, mortgages, deeds or releases. The favorite form of\r\nexpression used by the interpreter, according to affidavits, was “the\r\nbuyer says this is a legal document which you would not understand if\r\nread to you, and all you have to do is to sign your name and receive the\r\nmoney.” Very few Indians appear to have sworn to the papers they signed.\r\n\r\nWhen an Indian appeared with more than one trust patent he was usually\r\ntold that one of these would be purchased or mortgaged and the others\r\nwould be held for him and he could sign papers for all of them. Many of\r\nthe buyers were accustomed to say to the Indian, “You have no safe in\r\nyour cabin, and if these papers burn up you would lose your land. You\r\nhad better let me keep them in my safe.” Then the Indian signed and\r\nparted with the papers and we can imagine the result.\r\n\r\nAllotments acquired by inheritance are called by the Indians “dead\r\nallotments.” Such estates must be probated. In other communities the fee\r\nis anywhere from a few dollars to fifteen dollars or more, but in\r\nDetroit, Mahnomen, Ogema and Wauban, the usual charge varied from $50 to\r\nas high as $150, according to the credulity of the victim—and there were\r\nother charges. When the Indians reported to us that they had signed over\r\n“dead allotments” to be probated, we frequently discovered that it was\r\nnot clear in the Indian’s mind how so much money was necessary in order\r\nto settle these estates, but having surrendered the trust patent, he was\r\nwithout anything to show for his inheritance. Frequently little or\r\nnothing accrued to the Indian after the benevolent attorney or banker\r\nhad been paid for his efforts in directing the Indian’s footsteps along\r\nthe broad highway of civilization.\r\n\r\nInstances are not wanting where deceased Indians were actually\r\nresurrected long enough to dispose of land which they had neglected to\r\nconvey during life, and affidavits are not lacking which recite that\r\nso-and-so was an adult mixed-blood and competent to handle his affairs.\r\nI have in mind one case of a boy resting in his grave at Pine Point.\r\nCertain individuals made affidavit that this boy was alive, and was of\r\nage, and thereby they secured control of his valuable pine allotment.\r\n\r\nThe affidavits bristled with forgery and perjury.\r\n\r\nMen employed in the livery stables of Detroit and elsewhere told me that\r\nas soon as the lands were allotted all the available teams and drivers\r\nwere engaged by the buyers, and that night and day for many months these\r\nmen scoured the reservation and pursued the Indian men, women and\r\nchildren until they had secured the best farms and timber tracts\r\navailable. There is one man in particular whose history is interesting.\r\nHe walked into Detroit a tramp ten years ago and began washing dishes in\r\na hotel. Just how he got his start is under dispute, one man claiming\r\nthat a stranded theatrical company left several trunks of gaudy\r\nparaphernalia in Detroit, which this man traded to some drunken Indians\r\nfor a tract of land. Whether this is true or not, he was successful in\r\nIndian land speculation, and at present he is now a leading citizens of\r\nthe region. Some of the Indians call him, “the white wolf, with the gold\r\nteeth.”\r\n\r\nWhere was the United States Indian Bureau, while this disgraceful scene\r\nwas being enacted? Where was the Indian Agent, sworn to protect these\r\npeople? Where were the Inspectors and Special Agents? How was it that\r\nthe testimony of missionaries and others, and their warnings, produced\r\nno effect in Washington? These are questions I have repeatedly asked,\r\nand nobody has ever answered them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  According to Miss Densmore’s spelling: “Odjibwe”; “Maingans”;\r\n  “Meja-kigi-jig”. I have spelled the names as pronounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      CHAPTER VII. SOME INDIAN TESTIMONY AND AFFIDAVITS. SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the height of the pine and land purchases, crowds of Indians at\r\nWhite Earth were persuaded to visit Detroit and Park Rapids and Ogema.\r\nContrary to the law, whiskey was frequently sold them. They tell how at\r\nPark Rapids, in the little square in the centre of the village, drunken\r\nIndians were lying on the grass in numbers, and at Ogema a saloon keeper\r\nwas passing liquor in a bucket, and handing it out by the dipperful to\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nAfter the buyers had used persuasion to get the Indians to give up their\r\nallotments, they resorted to stronger measures in dealing with those who\r\nwould not sell. A wife of a policeman at Pine Point, Mrs. John Rock, was\r\nawakened at eleven o’clock in the night by Detroit buyers, who forcibly\r\nentered her cabin, and stayed until two o’clock in the morning until\r\nthey obtained one of her tracts of land.\r\n\r\nWhen Indians visited Detroit and partook of liquor they were arrested.\r\nOn being brought before the authorities and fined, they were told by the\r\nattorney who was supposed to defend them, or by the kind-hearted land\r\nbuyer, that they must sell or deed over a tract of land in order to pay\r\nthe fine. Sworn testimony in several cases is to this effect.\r\n\r\nWhen Indians were brought into the offices of the buyers and hesitated\r\nabout selling or mortgaging, more persuasive arguments were used. In the\r\ncase of Grace Rock, who visited E. G. Holmes’ bank, the testimony now in\r\nthe hands of the Government is to the effect that as she did not wish to\r\nsell at the price offered, and started into the hall, one of those\r\npresent cried to Interpreter Morrison, “Go and fetch her back, and if\r\nshe will not sell, we will throw her into the lake.”\r\n\r\nMe-zhuck-ke-gway-abe in affidavit No. 268, July 29, 1909, states that\r\none Fred Saunders got him to drink and then bought his land. A minor\r\nson, Willy Bassett, was told to sign papers, or he would be put in jail.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Mrs. Lawrence Roberts, her affidavit recites that she\r\nappeared before banker Anundensen with Interpreter Robert\r\nMorrison—“Anundensen asked if I was a mixed-blood and I said my parents\r\nare full-bloods. He said that is all right. We signed papers.”\r\n\r\nI quote this case because it is typical of nearly one hundred others.\r\nThe papers which she signed were not explained to this woman and may\r\nwell have recited that she was a mixed-blood Indian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROSE ELLIS\r\n\r\n  One of the interpreters serving during the investigation of 1909.\r\n    Carlisle graduate. Full-blood Ojibwa.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA number of Indians have stated that “If you are related to\r\nmixed-bloods, it is all right.” I make particular mention of this\r\nmixed-blood question because, before the Congressional Investigation\r\nCommittee Gus Beaulieu claimed that I endeavored to prove all Indians\r\nfull-bloods, and that these Indians, having previously sworn before the\r\nland buyers that they were mixed-bloods, should now be indicted for\r\nperjury. We were especially careful in all our evidence, and we\r\ndiscriminated against those who appeared to be mixed-bloods—if there was\r\nany discrimination at all. Only Indians who were undoubtedly full-bloods\r\nwere entered as such.\r\n\r\nThe fact that many Indians may have previously sworn that they were\r\nmixed-bloods does not prove them to be such. They were made to sign\r\nthese papers, the papers were not explained to them, and if there is any\r\nperjury, the white people are responsible, rather than the Indians who\r\nhave been duped.\r\n\r\nWhen the business of dealing in Indian lands was at its height, carloads\r\nof wild bronchos from South Dakota, and broken-down horses from St. Paul\r\nwere shipped up to the Indian country. The business was apparently\r\nconducted on a large scale, for several hundred Indians testified to\r\nhaving traded their allotments for a little cash and teams of horses,\r\nbuggies, harnesses and sleighs, not to mention old pianos, graphophones\r\nand other useless articles in the struggle of the aborigines for\r\nexistence. As the Ojibwa are woods or canoe Indians, and not “Horse\r\nIndians” as are the Sioux, very few of them understood the management of\r\nhorses. Even if the horses had been strong and active, it is doubtful if\r\nthey would have been of any considerable value to these Indians. Some of\r\nthe horses lived but a few weeks. Many of them were so old that their\r\nteeth were worn down. The broncho would run away and smash the old buggy\r\nor sleigh.\r\n\r\nFive interpreters, who confessed as to their part in these proceedings\r\nin order to escape prosecution, told how the bankers and real estate men\r\noften stood in their office doors and laughed heartily as the poor\r\nIndians drove away after conducting their business.\r\n\r\nOne young lady, who is a Carlisle graduate, told me that she and her\r\nsister, believing that the man who paid the Indians money for their land\r\nwas cheating, put on Indian costumes, painted up and passed before him.\r\nEach girl was to receive $750. He said, “Do you speak English?” She\r\nreplied, “kawin,” which is emphatic “no.” He then proceeded to count\r\nones and twos aloud until he had reached what would appear to an\r\nignorant Indian to be $750, but was in reality about $130. This girl\r\nstood aside and her sister then appeared. The man asked the same\r\nquestion, and she, waiting until he had counted the money, then said in\r\nEnglish, “Don’t you think you had better count that over?” He flushed\r\nand stammered and made good the full amount to each sister. A woman sold\r\na million feet of pine timber for $10,000 and came home with a thousand\r\none-dollar bills stuffed in a long stocking.\r\n\r\nOne of our old Indian witnesses at Pine Point, sold seventy thousand\r\nfeet of pine timber valued at nearly a thousand dollars, and all he\r\nreceived was ten dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the old woman O-mo-du-yea-quay, she testified she was\r\nvisited by interpreter Joe Flammand, who told her that Lawyer Beum would\r\npay her $500 for her eighty acres. “When I got there, they gave me a\r\nlittle less than forty dollars and bought me a house alongside the\r\nrailroad, containing one bedstead, two chairs, a small table and a\r\nlittle cook-stove. After that Flammand would come to my house and give\r\nme a dollar or a quarter. After a little while he told me that my money\r\nwas all gone.”\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest stories told me at White Earth will be found in\r\nOfficial Affidavit 359, that of O-nah-yah-wah-be-tung. This man had\r\nvaluable pine timber which, he states, he sold for $7000. The Indian\r\nhaving received the money, the grafters immediately got busy. One\r\nWilliam Lufkins, a mixed-blood, persuaded him to pay $1800 for a ranch\r\nbuilding. This was moved from some distance on the prairie to Ogema. A\r\nlarge sum was charged for moving the building. I heard that $400 was\r\ncharged for moving it across the railroad tracks, which procedure\r\noccupied less than an hour. After the house was established on a lot\r\nfronting on the main street of Ogema, the Indian was told that he should\r\ngo into business as do white people. It was suggested that he start a\r\nfeed store. He trusted one or two men to visit St. Paul and buy flour\r\nand feed in order to stock his store. These men squandered a thousand\r\ndollars in dissipation. He sent them three hundred more and they\r\nreturned with a small quantity of feed stock. Thus the man’s money\r\ndwindled until he was defrauded out of his entire $7000, and is today a\r\npauper.\r\n\r\nIn the following cases I have stated the facts briefly, without giving\r\nthe Indian’s name.\r\n\r\nIn the testimony on file in case numbered 382, it appears that a certain\r\nattorney and prominent man, had brought before him an Indian woman who\r\ndid not wish to sign papers, and the attorney said if she did not do so\r\nhe would have her arrested and put in jail. The proprietor of a lodging\r\nhouse at Detroit, according to this sworn statement, gave these Indians\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  State of Minnesota )\r\n                     )SS\r\n  County of Becker   )\r\n\r\n  On this 8th day of September, A.D. 1909, before me, E.

Inspector, Dept. of Interior.\r\n\r\n  Copy of Official Affidavit with thumb-print signatures, used by\r\n  Linnen-Moorehead Investigators\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to affidavit numbered eleven, banker M. J. Kolb at Ogema sent\r\nfor one of the Indians and stated that he wished to buy the pine on the\r\nminor son’s allotment. The minor was aged fourteen. The Indian went to\r\nKolb’s bank and found another man there, who stated that, although the\r\nchild was a minor, yet he would buy the timber and stand the risk. Kolb\r\npaid the Indian $100 and ten dollars of this was given to Jim Bunker,\r\nthe interpreter. A month later the banker sent for the Indian and\r\nstated, “You better bring your trust patent of your original allotment\r\nto me or you will probably be arrested.” Thus Kolb obtained the Indian’s\r\noriginal allotment in addition to the minor child’s pine. I might\r\ncontinue repeating similar instances.\r\n\r\nTwo important and shocking statements I reproduce here. Government\r\nofficial numbers, 247 and 92. They are self-explanatory.\r\n\r\n  STATE OF MINNESOTA } SS\r\n  COUNTY OF MAHNOMEN }\r\n\r\n  On this 23d day of August, A.D. 1909, before me, W. K. Moorehead,\r\n  Spec. U. S. Indian Agent, personally came Mayn-way-way-be-nace, who\r\n  being first duly sworn by me according to law, on oath deposes and\r\n  says:\r\n\r\n  Two years ago Mr. Waller of Waubun, Minn., came to my house\r\n  for the trust patent of my original allotment No. 2321 for\r\n  E2NE—Sec. 8, 144–40. This was hardwood timber. He gave me $20\r\n  cash. When he came he made this statement, “I have already\r\n  arranged at the Court House to have you arrested, and have\r\n  come over here to get your trust patent to take care of your\r\n  land for you.” My wife, Ah-be-dah-sah-mo-quay, and my\r\n  children, Antoine and Maggie (Mah-geed) were witnesses. Andrew\r\n  Vanoss came with Mr. Waller as interpreter. Vanoss gave me\r\n  whiskey and also presented me with a pint bottle of whiskey.\r\n  Mr. Waller took the trust patent and handed me $20 in cash. As\r\n  near as I can judge, my giving up the trust patent cancelled\r\n  the obligations incurred in the mortgage referred to in the\r\n  affidavit signed by my wife, Ah-be-dah-sah-mo-quay.\r\n\r\n  In the fall of 1908 I went to Mahnomen with the Trust Patent of my\r\n  additional allotment No. 1702 for N2SW—Sec. 36—145–38. This may be\r\n  timber land. I saw L. O. Johnson, of the Prairie Land Company. I\r\n  sold the land to Johnson for $364. He did not ask any questions as\r\n  to my blood relationship. I signed papers, my wife was present.\r\n  Willie Brunette was interpreter. I was drinking at the time.\r\n\r\n  Three years ago Fargo and Peake of Ogema, Minn., came to my house\r\n  and asked if I had any dead allotments to sell. I told them I had\r\n  three: Naysh-kah-we-gah-bow, age 36 yrs.; Mah-co-day-we-gwaince, and\r\n  Zo-zed, age about 4 yrs. Fargo and Peake said that they would take\r\n  these three trust patents of the dead allotments to be probated.\r\n  They also stated that when my grandchildren (who were also heirs)\r\n  come of age they would pay the value of these allotments. This\r\n  summer they paid me $130. This is all I have ever received. My wife\r\n  and I signed papers. Willie Lufkin, was interpreter. I paid him one\r\n  dollar ($1.00).\r\n\r\n  About the middle of June, 1909, I took the trust patent of my\r\n  deceased grandchild, Simon Smith, to J. T. Van Metre of Mahnomen,\r\n  Minn., to be probated. I have received no money. This was allotment\r\n  No. —— for ——\r\n\r\n  The allotment of Naysh-kah-we-gah-bow was No. 2323 for S2SE—Sec.\r\n  2—144–41; of Mah-co-day-we-gwaince was No. —— for ——; of Zo-zed was\r\n  No. 2326 for E2SE—Sec. 5—144–40.\r\n\r\n                                                            _His mark_\r\n                                          MAYN-WAY-WAY-BE-NACE.\r\n\r\n  Witness to mark\r\n  Georgia Lacy\r\n\r\n  Subscribed and sworn to before me this 23d day of August, A.D. 1909.\r\n\r\n                                        WARREN K.

K. Moorehead,\r\n  Spec. U. S. Indian Agent, personally came Margaret Colburne, who\r\n  being first duly sworn by me according to law, deposes and says:\r\n\r\n  That about two years ago, in August, 1907, a man named Ephraim\r\n  Budrow came to my house at Cloquet, Minn., and finding me there\r\n  alone and observing my crippled condition, said, “I am surprised to\r\n  see you in this condition. Why don’t you sell some of your land?” He\r\n  asked me how much land I had. This man seemed to know about my land.\r\n  He asked for the two trust patents of my deceased husband, Joe\r\n  Colburne, No. 2950 for SW|4 of SW|4, Sec. 32 & SE|4 of SE|4, Sec.\r\n  31, T 143—42, for my own trust patent, as above, and for that of my\r\n  child Joseph, No. 2953 for Lots 4 and 12, Sec. 30, Twp 143, R 42.\r\n  Said Budrow walked back and forth in the room in an excited and\r\n  nervous manner, and presently he went out before I could stop him,\r\n  taking the three trust patents with him. Because of my crippled\r\n  condition I could not run after him but managed to crawl to the\r\n  window and called to him to stop. He paid no attention to me.\r\n\r\n  My son-in-law came home about noon. His name is Frank Houle. He\r\n  asked me what I was crying about and I told him that said Budrow had\r\n  run off with the three trust patents belonging to my husband\r\n  (dec’d), myself and the boy. My son-in-law started at once for town\r\n  to hunt for Budrow but could not find him. That same evening,\r\n  however, my son-in-law caught hold of this Ephraim Budrow as Budrow\r\n  was boarding the train and told Budrow to give up the trust patents\r\n  he had taken from me. Budrow reached into a pocket and handed out\r\n  some papers to my son-in-law, which my son-in-law thought were the\r\n  three trust patents but which proved to be only the trust patent of\r\n  my child Joseph. Three days after, when we managed to get enough\r\n  money, my son-in-law went to Ephraim Budrow’s house at Fish Lake,\r\n  White Earth reservation and said Budrow promised to give up the\r\n  other two trust patents the next morning, but during the night\r\n  Budrow went away. My son-in-law waited for Budrow two days but\r\n  Budrow failed to turn up.\r\n\r\n  About two months ago, when I was in Waubun, I was taken sick and\r\n  needing some money, the lawyers were very insistent that I touch a\r\n  pen, and after I did so I received $400 for myself and $100 for my\r\n  son. They asked me if I was a mixed-blood and I told them no, that I\r\n  was a full-blood. I was not sworn to these papers. There was no\r\n  interpreter and I did not understand the papers.\r\n\r\n                                                          Her mark\r\n                                                    MARGARET COLBURNE.\r\n\r\n  Witness to mark\r\n      C. E. DENNIS.\r\n\r\n  Subscribed and sworn to before me this 6th day of September, A.D.\r\n  1909, at White Earth, Minn.\r\n\r\n                                         WARREN K. MOOREHEAD,\r\n                                           _Spec. U. S. Indian Agent_.\r\n\r\nIt should be clear to all persons that those in authority should have\r\ninformed these Indians that a trust patent lost did not mean the loss of\r\nproperty. By sending a small fee to Washington a duplicate trust patent\r\nwould be issued to any Indian who could prove that he had lost his.\r\nIndians were allowed to remain in ignorance of this, and were led to\r\nbelieve that the trust patent was everything. Therefore, when they lost\r\na trust patent they supposed they had lost their allotment.\r\n\r\nThe entire space assigned to this chapter could be devoted to a\r\ndiscussion of health conditions but it is too heart-rending to take up\r\nin detail. The Chippewa Indians are suffering from tuberculosis,\r\nscrofula, trachoma and other diseases. Thirty-two per cent of the\r\nchildren in the Government schools on examination by Government\r\nphysician, Dr. Edwards, were found to have trachoma; fifty per cent of\r\nthe Indians living at Pine Point have tuberculosis. Unless drastic\r\nremedies are adopted the Ojibwa will soon be a thing of the past. The\r\nIndian Office has built a hospital, and has rented of the Episcopal\r\nchurch a small one, yet these care for but a fraction of the sick.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic priest, Father Roman Homar, in charge of the Mission at\r\nRice River, reported to me under date of April 29, 1910, that there was\r\nmore suffering than ever before in his territory; that Indians died that\r\nwinter, that many of the Indians were compelled to hunt rabbits, not for\r\npleasure, but from necessity, and that practically all the rabbits on\r\nthe reservation were killed. He exhausted his little fund and much of\r\nhis own salary in caring for the unfortunate. Early in April he had\r\nutilized all the lumber at his disposal for the making of coffins, and\r\nfor the last Indian that he buried, just previous to writing the letter,\r\nhe made the coffin out of the church wood-box.\r\n\r\nRev. Father Felix, Catholic Missionary at Pine Point, and Rev. Wilkins\r\nSmith, Episcopal missionary at Twin Lakes, both wrote to me of the great\r\nsuffering and poverty, sickness and death, and how their resources were\r\ntaxed beyond their ability to meet the same, in order to relieve even\r\nsuch Indians as were connected with their various missions. The large\r\norphan school near White Earth village is crowded.\r\n\r\n                          _Ojibwa Squaw Dance_\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Sung during the dance at Rice River, August, 1909. Recorded by W. K.\r\n    Moorehead.\r\n\r\n  This is the favorite song of the squaw dance. During five evenings,\r\n    when I listened to the music, and observed the ceremony of the\r\n    dance, this song was rendered more frequently than any of those\r\n    reproduced in Miss Densmore’s book. There are no words. The\r\n    musicians, five to eight in number, sat around a large drum, beating\r\n    time thereon and singing at the top of their voices. The repetition\r\n    of the song continues for nearly an hour. After a short intermission\r\n    the singers change to another air, but soon return to the favorite.\r\n\r\n  Gifts or favors are bestowed by dancers on their partners, and\r\n    according to Indian etiquette the full value must be returned when\r\n    one asks a person who has “favored him” to dance. The Indians never\r\n    slight each other or return trinkets for valuables. That “right” is\r\n    reserved to the white participants who once in a while take part.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Government boarding school is now attended by about 300 pupils and\r\ndoes excellent work. At the time of our investigation, however, it was\r\nin a most unsatisfactory condition, and immediate reforms had to be\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Linnen-Moorehead investigation there was entirely too much\r\nswindling of school children. One would imagine that pupils in a\r\nGovernment school, and under the protection of the American flag, would\r\nbe safer than pupils in ordinary institutions not governmental in\r\ncharacter. Yet there are many cases on record where children, little and\r\nbig, have lost their allotments while attending school. For this the\r\nIndian Office does not seem so much to blame as the teachers and\r\nsuperintendents who should have refused admission to persons who came to\r\ntransact business with minors. It is gratifying to learn that the\r\nCommissioner has issued strict orders, and now it is impossible for\r\nstrangers, land sharks, or others to enter Government boarding schools\r\nand swindle minors out of their property. My only regret is that the\r\nstrong, right arm of the Government did not protect these poor people\r\nand their children prior to my arrival at White Earth.\r\n\r\nMiss Phillomea Donnell was a pupil in the school at Flandreau, South\r\nDakota, where many Indian children are assembled each year for\r\ninstruction. She lived as do the others, in large dormitories. She\r\ntestifies that while she was there, a prominent, educated Indian\r\nappeared and entered the music room without opposition on the part of\r\nany teacher or person in authority, and sent for Miss Donnell. She came\r\ndown from her room, and the man produced a folded paper and a fountain\r\npen. He said that there was a dispute as to how her name was spelled on\r\nthe Government roll. There was some discussion about it, and he secured\r\nher signature on each side of this paper in order, as he assured her, to\r\ncorrect any error in the record. So she signed the paper in both places,\r\nand he gave her a folded piece of paper, or an envelope, and told her it\r\nwas a present for her. Indians frequently make each other presents when\r\nvisiting, and so she did not look at this paper until she had been in\r\nher room some time, as he told her it was a surprise. When she looked at\r\nthe paper she found it was a check for $500. Then, realizing that her\r\nallotment of eighty acres, near the town of Mahnomen, was a valuable\r\nallotment, she concluded that probably he had made her sign a paper the\r\nresult of which would be the loss of her land. She immediately sought\r\nthe superintendent of that school and he referred the matter to\r\nInspector Linnen and myself. The Indian had come to the school in an\r\nautomobile to hasten matters. There were no witnesses to the signature,\r\nand he had no power of attorney in South Dakota, but only in Minnesota.\r\nYet in a few days the deed was recorded with the signature of witnesses.\r\n\r\nIn our capacity as Government officials we reported this outrageous\r\nproceeding to the Department, prepared carefully-drawn affidavits\r\ncovering the entire circumstances, and rushed them to Washington to\r\nenable the Commissioner to take immediate action. Up to the last that I\r\nheard from Miss Donnell, she had obtained no relief from the Government,\r\nbut has been compelled to pay $57 out of her own funds (which were\r\nlimited) to obtain her own land. The buyer would not have given it up\r\nbut for the fact that he knew we were ready to proceed against him. I\r\ncite the case of this girl in detail, although there are others which\r\ncould be mentioned where frauds were practised on minor children in the\r\nGovernment schools.\r\n\r\nWhen the Graham Committee hearings were published, the affidavits and\r\ncorrespondence were made public. The Indian is supposed to have\r\npersuaded Miss Donnell to speak in his favor. One of the Department of\r\nJustice officials told me that the case against him was dropped.\r\n\r\nWe learned that certain educated Indians made a practice of going to\r\nthese Government schools, calling the pupils into the parlor or the\r\nmusic-room or parade-ground, and transacting business with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VIII. THE ROLL. STORIES. RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHITE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago the employees at White Earth Agency made a roll of the\r\nChippewa Indians. One would suppose that so important a document as a\r\nregister of all the Indians would be accurate. But the original roll, as\r\non file at the White Earth office, in 1909, bristled with inaccuracies.\r\nFor instance, the name Mah-geed is the Ojibwa pronunciation of Maggie.\r\nMany of the Indian girls were named Mah-geed by the priests and\r\nmissionaries. Those who made the Government roll apparently thought that\r\nMah-geed was a distinguished Indian name, so they had entered up quite a\r\nnumber of Mah-geeds. No other name is added.\r\n\r\nThe Ojibwa name for old woman is Min-de-moi-yen. To the clerks who made\r\nthe roll this sounded like the name of an Indian, so they solemnly set\r\ndown many such names. “Young girl” is E-quay-zince. There are a large\r\nnumber of E-quay-zinces in the roll. Yet, mind you, this is the official\r\nroll, to which I objected, and to which the Indian Office employees\r\nreplied that if it was so entered on the roll it must be correct! When\r\nIndians are assembled together, if one would call for E-quay-zince or\r\nMah-geed, it would be precisely as if, in an audience of two or three\r\nhundred white persons, the speaker should ask for a “young girl” named\r\nMary to come forward, or request that “the lady” come to the platform.\r\n\r\nBy whom, aside from old Joe Pereault, an illiterate and troublesome\r\nFrench-Canadian, who was employed for some time in the Agent’s office at\r\nWhite Earth, this roll was made, I do not know.\r\n\r\nAs the roll we found in the Agent’s office in 1909 had been there for\r\nyears, I have often wondered how the authorities could differentiate\r\nbetween the various Mah-geeds. If annuity money is to be paid an Indian\r\nwoman, E-quay-zince; what E-quay-zince would receive said payment? And\r\nthe same is true with reference to Min-de-moi-yen. If on an occasion of\r\ngreat moment all the women of these names should appear at the agency\r\nsimultaneously, how would the employees be able to deal with them? The\r\nspectacle would be amusing, and complicated, to say the least.\r\n\r\nInspector Linnen and myself made an accurate roll of the full-blood\r\nIndians. We did not trouble ourselves concerning the mixed-bloods, who\r\nwere citizens, and under the law can dispose of their property. We were\r\nsent to Minnesota to make an investigation as to the full-blood Indians,\r\nand our work was confined to these Indians. If I remember correctly, we\r\nentered five hundred and fifteen names.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and most reliable men of the tribe were assembled at the\r\nvarious points where we investigated. These men knew all of the Indians\r\nliving in certain parts of the reservation, and their parents. In many\r\ninstances, they knew the grandparents and whether they were full-blood\r\nor mixed-blood Indians. Through the assistance of two or three\r\ninterpreters, we carefully examined the witnesses in the presence of\r\nthose old men. An affidavit was drawn, in accordance with the facts, and\r\neach witness attached his thumb-print thereto. On page 81 I present a\r\nphotographic copy of an affidavit taken by Mr. Linnen. It will be\r\nobserved by study of this that the testimony was exact in detail, and\r\nthe Indian proved to be a full-blood. If this plan were followed on all\r\nthe reservations in the United States, accurate lists of Indian\r\npopulation would result. The list was made on ethnological lines. The\r\ntrouble has been, that men who were not acquainted with Indian customs\r\nor descent, and who did not assemble together a sufficient number of the\r\nolder Indians, have attempted to make these rolls.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of our work at White Earth, the affidavits, the rolls,\r\nand other papers were given to the Indian Office, and submitted by them\r\nto the Department of Justice. The Department accepted our affidavits and\r\nput them in legal form and began prosecutions, which have extended down\r\nto the present time.\r\n\r\nWhen Hon. Marsden C. Burch had charge of the White Earth cases for the\r\nAttorney General, Mr. E. C. O’Brien served as his assistant. Hon. C. C.\r\nDaniels succeeded Judge Burch, and Mr. O’Brien is associated with him in\r\nthe prosecutions. Mr. O’Brien kindly read proofs of my White Earth\r\nchapters and offered suggestions. Mr. O’Brien says:—\r\n\r\n“All suits are based on the Linnen-Moorehead roll, except a few\r\nsuggested by Mr. Hinton. The Hinton roll includes all Indians on the\r\nreservation, and was prepared to determine who were entitled to fee\r\nsimple patents.”[14]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. John H. Hinton was appointed Special Agent and sent to White Earth\r\nto make a new roll of the Ojibwa. I was informed he added many names,\r\nbut Mr. O’Brien’s recent letter indicates that this is not correct. The\r\n“interests” responsible for the White Earth scandal, petitioned Congress\r\na year ago to make a new roll of the Ojibwa. This bill nearly passed. A\r\nCommission of two is now making a roll of allotments, which Mr. O’Brien\r\nassures me are not included in the suits.\r\n\r\nAll lovers of justice may pray that no new roll be attempted. The\r\nLinnen-Moorehead list is accurate and has stood the test.\r\n\r\nHaving assembled as our witnesses the most reliable old Indians, we were\r\nable to check up the many errors in the Government roll. Frequently\r\nthere would be as many as forty or fifty Ojibwa assembled in the\r\nschoolroom where our hearings were held. When the interpreter called out\r\nsuch a name as Min-de-moi-yen, or E-quay-zince, or Mah-geed, the other\r\nIndians would shout with laughter, and when they had recovered\r\nsufficiently they would state they did not know what individual Indian\r\nwas named as there were a score who might respond to that appellation.\r\n\r\nThe Ojibwa Indians have had a number of attorneys in the past twenty, or\r\ntwenty-five years. None of these men seem to have concerned themselves\r\nwith the prevention of the wholesale thefts of land and timber. The\r\ngentleman who acted as attorney at the time of our arrival, became\r\nactive toward the end of our investigation, and did what he could to\r\nsecure justice for the Indians. But he had done nothing previously along\r\nsuch lines, and his activities savored of a death-bed repentance. The\r\nSecretary of the Interior did not approve his re-election. The\r\nfull-blood Indians were against the employment of the attorney, and the\r\nmixed-blood Indians, headed by Gus Beaulieu, were very insistent that\r\nthe attorney be retained. During the three years prior to 1909, the\r\nattorney had received in salary and expenses about $20,000.\r\n\r\nA large council was called in July by the Indians to talk over the\r\nattorneyship. Mr. Linnen and myself were spectators, and while we could\r\nhave helped the poor, ignorant full-bloods, because of our official\r\nposition, we were compelled to sit in silence and see Gus Beaulieu and\r\nJohn Carl, Rev. Clement Beaulieu and others manipulate the meeting. The\r\nfirst morning, there were sufficient full-bloods to have outvoted the\r\nBeaulieu element, two to one. But Gus Beaulieu and his brother, Rev.\r\nClement Beaulieu, consumed the time in speech-making, while Ben\r\nFairbanks sent mixed-bloods in teams all over the reservation to bring\r\nin those who would vote according to Gus Beaulieu’s desires. At the\r\nafternoon session the full-blood Indians might have carried their point,\r\nbut they spent their time answering the arguments of the two Beaulieus\r\nand others, being cleverly heckled into making long speeches.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the council adjourned to a larger hall, in the center\r\nof White Earth village. By this time the mixed-blood element\r\npredominated and a very motley crowd was assembled, including a number\r\nof saloon-keepers of Ogema and other towns, and several interpreters who\r\nwere mentioned in the affidavits as having acted as go-betweens in land\r\nand timber deals. To shorten my story, the poor full-blood Indians were\r\noutvoted, they were asked to write out ballots (which they did not\r\nunderstand and most of them could not write) and the attorney was\r\nre-elected. We made a report against the council, and the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior sustained our objections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OJIBWA GRAVEYARD, WHITE EARTH MINNESOTA\r\n\r\n  Nearly all of these burials are those of consumptives the past few\r\n    years.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Chippewa attorney, there was also a Chippewa\r\nCommissioner. The Graham Investigating Committee considered him at some\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSenator Clapp asked that Darwin H. Hall be appointed Chippewa\r\nCommissioner. The history of this appointment is interesting, but must\r\nnot (at present) be related. Previous to that, Hall had been employed at\r\nvarious intervals until his employment totaled eight years and cost\r\n$31,845. In this connection it is well to remark that the investigation\r\nmade by Linnen and myself, including the employment of thirty-seven\r\npersons, and lasting all summer and part of the fall, cost for my part\r\n$3,066.64. Mr. Linnen’s expenses could not have been more than a third\r\nof that sum.\r\n\r\nHall came to White Earth while Linnen and I were investigating, and was\r\nof no value to us. He helped us in no way. He was detailed to move some\r\n200 or 300 Mille Lac Indians about one hundred miles (more or less). I\r\nhad offered to move these same Indians in sixty days, but my offer met\r\nwith no cordial response. During the twenty months that Hall was in\r\noffice he moved fifty Indians, according to my information, and\r\nfifty-one according to the Indian Office report. At that rate, his job\r\nwould have lasted nearly seven years! It cost him $167.50 per head to\r\nmove an Indian one hundred miles. It would have cost $33,500 to move 200\r\nIndians to White Earth!\r\n\r\nI met Hall at the Hiawatha Hotel, White Earth, prior to the arrival of\r\nMr. Linnen. We stepped out into the street in order not to be overheard\r\nand I told him of the dreadful situation of the Chippewa Indians and how\r\nthat he could help us right their wrongs. He informed me that he had no\r\nsympathy with the investigation, and I could see his attitude was\r\nhostile.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Bureau of Catholic Missions, Charles S. Lusk, wrote\r\nto the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in August, 1910, calling attention\r\nto the sad condition of these Indians, that the removal of a portion of\r\nthem to White Earth had brought them under the influence of one Gus\r\nBeaulieu and other politicians. They were promised houses, lands and\r\nfarming implements. In Washington three years ago I met a delegation of\r\nthe Ojibwa. Three of the members of this body were personally known to\r\nme, and the Chief Ah-bow-we-ge-shig well known. They told me that the\r\nlast thing that Darwin Hall did was to summon the Mille Lacs and\r\npersuade them to move a considerable distance from their homes. He left\r\nthem in camp, promising to return shortly and move them to White Earth.\r\nThese Indians waited two weeks. They had little food. Mr. Hall did not\r\nmove them, and they suffered privations, and at last returned to their\r\nformer homes. The story of the Mille Lacs reads as a page from Helen\r\nHunt Jackson’s “Century of Dishonor,” yet this scandal did not occur in\r\nthe old days, but is recent history. Who is responsible?\r\n\r\nAlmost any other body of men and women in the world would be utterly\r\ndiscouraged if they had passed through the same experience that fell to\r\nthe lot of the Ojibwa Indians of White Earth, Minnesota, during\r\ntwenty-five years. I am acquainted with no community in the East where,\r\nin the minds and hearts of the citizens, there would remain even a\r\nparticle of respect, or regard, or confidence, in any government, or\r\nculture, or civilization, responsible for such a condition. The sole\r\nsaving grace is the natural cheerfulness and optimism of the Ojibwa\r\npeople, as a whole. Many of them are discouraged, and most of them will\r\nnot farm or work, for the reason that the farming and working in the\r\npast resulted in those who were industrious being disciplined, (see page\r\n68) and those who were indolent being rewarded. No white man or woman\r\nwould work under similar circumstances. Yet, contrary to all precedents,\r\nthey are cheerful and optimistic. They have a keen sense of humor, they\r\nlaugh and joke among themselves. I desire to vary the monotony of this\r\nrecital of wrongs and sufferings, by illustrating a few incidents.\r\n\r\nThe old witnesses and the interpreters, after dinner one noon hour, were\r\nhaving an animated discussion. A number of us were lolling about on the\r\nground, smoking, and one of the officials happened at this moment to\r\nstretch and yawn. One of the old Indians immediately laughed and said\r\nsomething which caused the other Indians to shout with merriment. The\r\ninterpreter turned to me and said, “Mah-een-gonce says, that that is the\r\nfirst white man he has seen to open his mouth and a lie did not hop\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians were assembled in council on one occasion, a long\r\nletter from Washington arrived which was read by the clerk, and\r\ninterpreted by John Lufkins, a Carlisle graduate. At the conclusion of a\r\ntedious interpretation requiring an hour, a prominent Indian, whom we\r\ncalled “Shorty,” but whose correct name was Ah-bow-we-ge-shig, arose and\r\nuttered a few words not requiring more than fifteen or twenty seconds in\r\nutterance. His reply to the long, well-worded, indefinite Washington\r\nletter is worthy of preservation. “That letter is like the food that we\r\nIndians have today, all soup and no meat.”\r\n\r\nWhen some of the preliminary trials were heard at White Earth,\r\nprevious to action by the Department of Justice, the old Indian\r\nBay-bah-dwun-gay-aush, eighty-two years of age, and who was possessed\r\nof remarkable memory, was on the witness stand. This Indian knew the\r\nfamily history of several hundred persons and was entirely familiar\r\nwith all parts of the reservation. The lawyers, however, would ask him\r\nwhere was located a piece of land described as Township 4, Section 15,\r\nRange 142, and who owned it, instead of asking the Indian, “Who owns\r\nthe land at the head of Otter Creek?” or “Who used to live at the head\r\nof Otter Creek?” The attorneys purposely asked the Indian in a way to\r\nconfuse him, in order to substantiate their contention that Indian\r\ntestimony was not reliable.\r\n\r\nHaving stood this annoying and unfair grilling for a long time, old\r\nBay-bah-dwun-gay-aush said something to the interpreter which caused the\r\nother Indians to laugh. His remark was, “Why does the lawyer ask me\r\nwhere the Indian land is? The white lawyers know better than I, because\r\nthey now own most of the lands.” I believe that he added that they had\r\nstolen them, or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nInspector Linnen, Mr. Allen and myself were criticised by those who\r\nsought, unsuccessfully, to discredit our work; for the reason that we\r\nlooked on during a squaw dance. One reverend gentleman contended that we\r\nwere encouraging “pagan ceremonies”. In fact, he reproached one of the\r\nGovernment officials rather severely. The Government official denied\r\nhaving taken part in a pagan dance, whereupon the reverend gentleman\r\nasked him, “Have you seen many pagan dances?” “I can truthfully say,”\r\nreplied the official, “that I never observed but one dance which might\r\ntruly be called pagan.” The reverend gentleman seemed shocked, but made\r\nbold to inquire: “On what reservation?” “It was on no reservation. The\r\nonly real pagan dance I ever witnessed was the inaugural ball in\r\nWashington during Harrison’s administration.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, toward the end of the investigation, we were\r\nvisited by a reverend gentleman much concerned as to the welfare of the\r\nIndians, a most worthy person, but who seemed to concern himself with\r\ndetails, rather than the great important questions and problems of White\r\nEarth. There was a good deal of drinking among the Indians, and the\r\npolice made frequent arrests. The day following an arrest, when the\r\nIndians had become sober, they were brought into Major Howard’s office\r\nwhere a sort of “fatherly court” was held. These hearings might be\r\nroughly compared to police court affairs in other communities. Mr.\r\nLinnen and myself occasionally went in, but usually we were in the\r\nschoolroom taking testimony. Because we did not assume charge of all\r\nthose multitudinous details, the worthy gentleman from the East seemed\r\nto think that we were neglecting our duties. He thought we did not seem\r\nappalled by the laxity of morals, etc. Such was not the case, for we had\r\nalready made a lengthy report to the Secretary of the Interior and\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs on the whiskey curse and on immorality.\r\nHowever, he spoke to an educated Indian, and rather reprimanded us. The\r\nIndian’s answer was one of the best I have ever heard. He said, “Doctor,\r\nI will give you an Indian illustration. The shed, the stable and the\r\nhouse are all on fire. Linnen and Moorehead are trying to save the house\r\nfirst, and the stable next, but the shed is doomed. You want them to\r\nabandon work on the house and begin on the shed.”\r\n\r\nToday the Department of Justice has before it something like sixteen\r\nhundred cases involving lands at White Earth. Several times have I\r\nwritten the Honorable Attorney General for information. While some lands\r\nhave been returned, and some reforms instituted, it must be admitted\r\nthat there has not been the prompt, efficient “clean-up” for which we\r\nhoped. This has had a bad effect elsewhere on both Whites and Indians.\r\nIt is my firm conviction that white people are encouraged to defraud\r\nIndians, for the reason that they are willing to “take a chance.” That\r\nis, they know that the Indian property can be obtained in a short time,\r\nwhereas the procedure of recovery will drag through months, (and usually\r\nyears) and that the Government stands more than an even chance of being\r\ndefeated. It was defeated in the first White Earth cases.\r\n\r\nThe Indians take the point of view that the grafters are more powerful\r\nthan the Great Father at Washington. While this seems entirely\r\nillogical, nevertheless it is entirely true—from the Indians’ point of\r\nview. The Indian loses his property under such conditions as occurred at\r\nWhite Earth, by the removal of restrictions, in a few days, or a few\r\nweeks, elsewhere in a few months, or not more than a few years. He knows\r\nthat this is true and that it occurs all over the United States. The\r\nGovernment does not spend a few weeks, or a few months in recovering the\r\nproperty, save in very rare instances. Usually, the Government cases\r\ndrag on for years. The Indians write letters to the men who began the\r\ninvestigation, or the attorneys who tried the cases, and they receive\r\njust such replies as fill the files in my office: “I have the honor to\r\nadvise you that the Department is doing all it can to bring the cases to\r\ntrial. There was much testimony to be taken before they could be tried\r\non their merits.[15] Some are now almost ready for trial, and we hope to\r\nsubmit them before the close of the calendar year;” or, “The Department\r\nis doing all possible;” or, “The delays are due to the activity of the\r\nattorneys on the other side;” or, “It has been found that according to\r\nAct 462, 57th Congress, that these white persons are empowered”, etc.;\r\nor, “The information contained in your communication of the 13th has\r\nbeen submitted to our legal department,” etc., etc. From the Indian\r\npoint of view, there is anything and everything under the sun except the\r\nreturn of the property or the punishment of the guilty. This is strong\r\nlanguage, but it is absolutely true. So long as we permit Indians to\r\nlose their property without let or hindrance from us, our Indian\r\ncitizens will lose their property; and so long as we administer our\r\njustice in such a manner that the burden of the proof seems to rest on\r\nthe poor Indian rather than upon the white grafter, just so long will\r\nthe bulk of the Indians care neither for industry nor education, neither\r\nfor civilization nor Christianity. The Indian must have the same\r\nstanding and the same justice in court as the white man. Furthermore,\r\nthere must be a swift administration of justice, and some means devised\r\nwhereby the tricks of grafters’ lawyers may be overcome.\r\n\r\nThe Inspection Service, under the supervision of Honorable E. B. Linnen,\r\nis now what it should have been ten years ago. I went into this phase of\r\nthe White Earth situation in 1909, very thoroughly. There had been\r\nSpecial Agents and Inspectors at White Earth time and again.\r\n\r\nOne who had done real work was Mrs. Elsie E. Newton, one of the most\r\nable and conscientious women in the Indian Service. She had visited the\r\nsick and the suffering, had made recommendations, had done her part\r\ntoward remedying intolerable conditions.\r\n\r\nHow the others could have visited such a place as White Earth and not\r\nreported on actual conditions is incomprehensible, unless we accept Mr.\r\nValentine’s address at Lake Mohonk, in October, 1909, in which he stated\r\nthat too many of his Inspectors were blind and deaf! I talked with one\r\nor two men now out of the Service, who used to be Special Agents, and\r\nthey did not even know the names of all the places on the reservation! I\r\ndon’t know of one of them who went into the cabins and sat down and\r\ntalked to the Indians and heard their troubles. Most of them drove from\r\nthe railroad station at Ogema, over to the Agent’s office and talked\r\nwith Mr. Michelet, the agent preceding Howard.\r\n\r\nI would close this chapter on White Earth with an incident which\r\noccurred at Pine Point during the first investigation, March-April,\r\n1909.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of the Otter Tail Pilligers lives at Pine Point. One of the\r\nmost dramatic instances which occurred during the investigation happened\r\nin the latter part of March before the large party, employed during the\r\nsummer, had begun their labors. It was cold and we were compelled to\r\nhold our examinations indoors. Just opposite the office was a schoolroom\r\nin which some sixty Indian children were assembled under the charge of\r\nthree or four white teachers. The chief had lost a number of children\r\nand other relatives, and thus he and his wife were heirs to about eleven\r\nallotments. These were easily worth $45,000 or $50,000, being mostly\r\npine timber. With the exception of one or two others, this man had been\r\nrobbed of more property than anyone else, and it was pathetic to hear\r\nhim state how certain men in whom he trusted, had taken advantage of his\r\nignorance. When he had finished his long recital of wrongs, I remarked,\r\n“You must have lost entire faith in the white people and in the\r\nGovernment at Washington.” “Oh, no,” he replied, “I think that\r\nWashington would give me justice if only the men there could hear my\r\nstory.” Just as he completed this statement, the school session came to\r\nan end, and we heard through the thin partition the childish voices\r\nsinging in unison “My Country, ’Tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty”—and\r\nthis was the first time in my life that the words sounded in my ears\r\nlike a hollow mockery and a sham.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WHITE EARTH\r\n\r\n  Omitting ethnological reports and Warren’s book (see page 45) those\r\n  who desire to study conditions at White Earth, Leech Lake, Red Lake,\r\n  and Cass Lake, are referred to the reports of the Secretary of the\r\n  Interior, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the Board of Indian\r\n  Commissioners the past twenty years. These contain all\r\n  administrative details.\r\n\r\n  The legal aspect of the prosecution will be found in pamphlets\r\n  issued by the Department of Justice, and the U. S. Court of Claims.\r\n\r\n  White Earth has been the subject of much investigation on the part\r\n  of Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. The most\r\n  lengthy and exhaustive investigation, covering every phase of the\r\n  subject, is the report of the Committee on Expenditure in the\r\n  Interior Department, Honorable James M. Graham of Illinois,\r\n  Chairman. House Resolution No. 103; July 25, 1911–April, 1912; 2759\r\n  pp. Those who care to follow the subject further, will find in this\r\n  lengthy report an enormous amount of material.\r\n\r\n  A synopsis entitled “The Lesson of White Earth” will be found in the\r\n  report of the 30th Conference of Friends of the Indian and Other\r\n  Dependent Peoples held at Lake Mohonk, N. Y., October, 1912.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Letter of Dec. 2nd, 1914.

THE SIOUX AND THE MESSIAH CRAZE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sioux is one of our most famous Indian nations. As the Iroquois\r\nactivities two centuries ago placed them in the forerank of American\r\naborigines, so the Sioux from the days of Lewis and Clark down to the\r\npresent have been much in evidence. They are primarily a strong, hearty\r\nrace possessed of dominant spirit. Their reservations at Standing Rock,\r\nRosebud, Pine Ridge, etc., contain most of the 28,000 natives of this\r\nstock. Reference to Major Powell’s linguistic map will acquaint readers\r\nwith the enormous extent of territory they once occupied. The\r\nCommissioner’s map of 1913 shows that these people today own a small\r\nfraction of their original holdings.\r\n\r\nThe general progress of the Sioux, the famous men that they have\r\nproduced, I have covered in the chapters treating of Education, Red\r\nCloud, Sitting Bull, etc.\r\n\r\nThey were known to the army officers as Horse Indians, and to many\r\nothers as Plains Indians. The horse was to the Sioux what the birch bark\r\ncanoe was to the Ojibwa or the Penobscot. In early days their habitat\r\nwas almost entirely confined to the Great Plains, the foothills of the\r\nBlack Hills and the Missouri River. They were in Minnesota at an early\r\nperiod, but were driven westward and southward by the Ojibwa. The older\r\nOjibwa claim that the Sioux frequently surprised hunting parties of\r\nthese woods Indians, and that whenever the Ojibwa were caught out on the\r\nplain by the Sioux, they were invariably defeated with great loss. The\r\nOjibwa therefore resorted to the strategy of luring the Sioux into the\r\nwoods. Where this was possible, the expert woodcraft of the Ojibwa came\r\ninto play and they generally defeated their enemies with heavy\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\n1850 to 1868 found the Sioux supremacy on the Great Plains unquestioned.\r\nWith the coming of the railroad, and steamboat navigation on the\r\nMissouri, and the great influx of white traders, their powers declined\r\nas I have indicated in some detail on other pages.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Brulé, Miniconjou, Oglala, Teton and other divisions,\r\nso far as history is concerned, is pretty much the same. The buffalo was\r\ntheir chief support, in fact their very life was bound up in this\r\nanimal. The wild horse was a later acquisition. In order to understand\r\nthem thoroughly, the past fifty years, we should study in detail the\r\nlife of Red Cloud, that of Sitting Bull, and in addition the Messiah\r\ncraze, as previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the Pine Ridge of today and that of 1890 is almost\r\nbeyond belief. In 1890, one of the strangest ceremonies imaginable was\r\nin full swing. In 1909, when I visited Pine Ridge, exactly nineteen\r\nyears later, I found the Sioux working upon their allotments, farming,\r\ndigging irrigation ditches, and doing their best toward “taking the\r\nwhite man’s road.” On the plains where once clustered the tipis of the\r\nGhost dancers were the large, modern brick buildings of the Oglala\r\nschool, a most successful institution where young men and women are\r\ntrained in the arts. Certainly the progress of these Indians is more\r\nthan surprising—it is remarkable. And it is chiefly due to the fact that\r\nthey have had as their Superintendent or Agent a man who is in sympathy\r\nwith them and who has not been replaced through political influence.\r\nMajor John R. Brennan has supervised the famous old fighting Oglala\r\nSioux for more than fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe progress of these Indians is, as I have said, creditable, but they\r\nare still poor, there is much suffering, and the increase in stock has\r\nnot been as large as desired. Farming operations continue on a large\r\nscale, but the soil is more suited to grazing than farming, although the\r\nIndians do the best they can under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAll of the Sioux have so far progressed, that it is unthinkable that any\r\nfanaticism such as the Ghost dance will again overtake them. It is quite\r\nsafe to predict that since all of their children have been educated and\r\nnearly all of the Sioux of every reservation have been allotted land in\r\nseveralty, they will continue to progress, and if the ravages of\r\ntuberculosis are stayed, a large number of the descendants of the\r\nfull-bloods will survive and become useful citizens.\r\n\r\nThese Indians, after the surrender of Sitting Bull, were not much in the\r\npublic eye until occurred the famous Ghost dance, or Messiah craze, and\r\nthat being the chief event since the Custer fight we must needs devote\r\nconsiderable space to it.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions during the past two centuries, in this country,\r\nIndian shamans, or priests, have prophesied the coming of an Indian\r\nMessiah. We shall at some future time consider this interesting subject\r\nin detail, but within the period embraced in this book, that peculiar\r\ncraze which swept throughout the West and the South during the year\r\n1890, and known as the Ghost Dance, is the chief religious event.\r\n\r\nMr. James Mooney of the Bureau of Ethnology, published a very\r\ncomprehensive monograph, in 1896, entitled “The Ghost Dance Religion”,\r\nin the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. I shall draw\r\nthe information presented in this chapter partly from Mr. Mooney’s\r\naccount, but more especially from my own investigation made in the\r\nwinter of 1890 at Pine Ridge reservation, South Dakota, where among the\r\nOglala Sioux the Messiah craze reached its culmination.\r\n\r\nThe music of the Oglala dances was taken down at the time by Mr. George\r\nE. Bartlett (Husté) and myself. Our work was not copyrighted, and soon\r\nfound its way into various publications, and after being harmonized, our\r\nmusic was soon in general use. It is no more than fair to say that as I\r\nlay no claim to special skill as an ethnologist, Mr. Mooney, having more\r\ntraining and experience in such studies, was able to present the songs\r\nand their translations more accurately. I believe, in my original\r\narticles published in the _Illustrated American_ of New York in January\r\nand February, 1891, some of the Sioux word-syllables were not properly\r\nspaced, a number of accent marks omitted, and there were a few minor\r\nerrors. But in the main the account as published was correct, although\r\nit was a “popular”, rather than a technical paper.\r\n\r\nI did not investigate the Messiah in the West, although the new religion\r\nwas inaugurated by him. The Sioux told me a great deal concerning him.\r\nHe was known to them as Johnson, whereas Mooney gives as his proper\r\nname, Wovoka. In November, 1891, a year after the trouble at Pine Ridge,\r\nMr. Mooney set out for Pine Ridge, where he spent considerable time, and\r\nthen visited Walker Lake reservation in Nevada, where Wovoka (Johnson)\r\nlived. Here he obtained at first hand the information concerning the\r\norigin of the Messiah religion, and has presented us with a very\r\nvaluable and interesting account.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of all Messiahs or prophets, Wovoka was a dreamer. He\r\ninherited the spirit of prophecy, for his father before him was known as\r\na prophet. The young man at the time of Mooney’s visit, had never\r\nwandered beyond the valley wherein he resided—a small area, some thirty\r\nmiles in length. Wovoka belonged to the Paiute, and his religion may be\r\nsummed up in this statement which Mooney records.\r\n\r\n“When the sun died, I went up to heaven and saw God and all the people\r\nwho had died a long time ago. God told me to come back and tell my\r\npeople they must be good and love one another, and not fight, or steal,\r\nor lie. He gave me this dance to give to my people.”\r\n\r\nIf the missionaries and Government employees had seized upon the\r\nbeautiful sentiment uttered in this remarkable paragraph, the new\r\nreligion might have been turned to good account. Instead of that, as we\r\nshall see presently, an Agent utterly ignorant of Indians, saw in this\r\nsacred ceremony nothing beyond a “war dance” and he sent for troops—the\r\nvery worst possible thing he could have done.\r\n\r\nMooney spent many days conversing with this interesting person, Wovoka,\r\nwho told him that he had given to his people this dance about two years\r\npreviously. He seems to have talked very freely with Mr. Mooney,\r\npermitting him to take his photograph, and when Mooney left, the prophet\r\ngave him as souvenirs to exhibit to his friends, a blanket of rabbit\r\nskins, sacred paint endowed with miraculous powers and which plays an\r\nimportant part in the ritual of the Ghost dance religion, and other\r\ntrinkets.\r\n\r\nIn Oklahoma Mooney met with the Cheyennes and Arapahoes and they gave\r\nhim a written statement of the doctrine of Wovoka, which he was\r\npermitted to take to Washington to convince the authorities, “that there\r\nwas nothing bad or hostile in the new religion.”\r\n\r\nMooney traveled many months West and South and his excellent report is\r\nevidence that he studied every phase of the dance. My work was confined\r\nto Pine Ridge where I studied the dance while it was in progress. There\r\nit appeared in all its purity; there the white people made of it a\r\n“warlike” demonstration; there stupidity and ignorance transformed a\r\npeaceful, religious ceremony into a bloody tragedy—Wounded Knee.\r\n\r\nI employed three interpreters: the Weasel (Itonkasan,) George Bartlett\r\n(Husté), and a Frenchman, whose name I do not recall.\r\n\r\nDoctor Charles A. Eastman, the Sioux, some years after my account was\r\npublished, informed me that it was correct, and he was present before,\r\nduring and after the trouble at Pine Ridge, and knew all the actors\r\nintimately.\r\n\r\nSumming up Mr. Mooney’s conclusions in a few words, the Messiah craze of\r\n1890 was a mixture of Christianity and Indian religion.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the Messiah craze conformed to the sentiments of Jesus\r\nChrist. It was not expressed in His language, but the frequent\r\nrepetitions of such sentiments as “you must not fight”, and, “do injury\r\nto no one”; “give up the bad white man’s ways”; “live as brothers as you\r\ndid before the Whites came”; “Dance faithfully to the Great Spirit”;\r\n“Father and Mother are talking”; etc., indicate a belief in the better\r\nthings of life and of the hereafter. Instead of hostility, peace was\r\nproclaimed; instead of avarice, the communistic life was advocated.\r\n\r\nThere was only one discontented element, or discordant note, and that\r\nwas the stand taken by Sitting Bull and a few other Indians, who seized\r\nupon this craze to further their own personal aims. Major McLaughlin has\r\ncommented in full on Sitting Bull’s attitude in his book, pages 183–220.\r\nAnd while I do not entirely agree with him, it is beyond question that\r\nSitting Bull sought to gain through the Messiah craze. To a certain\r\nextent he advocated armed resistance, but the dominating desire in his\r\nmind, a careful review of events would indicate, was that Sitting Bull\r\ndesired above all things to see the Indians restored to their old-time\r\ndomination. Like the others, he prayed for the return of the buffalo,\r\nwithout which “the good old days” would be impossible. He probably\r\nbelieved that volcanic action (“wave of mud”, as the Oglala called it)\r\nwould sweep across the country, destroy the Whites and leave the red men\r\nhappy possessors of the Plains and countless herds of bison, elk and\r\ndeer. That was the belief of many of the Indians, and so expressed by\r\nthem during the Ghost dance.\r\n\r\nThe Ghost dance, or Messiah craze, was seized upon by all these Sioux as\r\na means of salvation out of their troubles. We must remember that these\r\nIndians had lived but a few years on the reservation at Pine Ridge. In\r\n1876, only fourteen years before, they killed Custer and wiped out\r\nseveral companies of the Seventh Cavalry. They had made some progress,\r\nbut they were still ration Indians, and the cutting down of the supply\r\nof beef, etc., hundreds of thousands pounds, before the Indians had\r\nbecome self-supporting, caused widespread suffering.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to repeat the troubles of the Sioux here. I have\r\nreferred to some of the treaties, Indian cause for dissatisfaction, in\r\nother pages of this book. In the spring of 1889, so I was informed at\r\nPine Ridge, Congress passed an act authorizing the purchase of a large\r\ntract of land from these people. Honorable Charles Foster, ex-Governor\r\nof Ohio, and several other gentlemen were appointed a committee to\r\nnegotiate with the Indians. According to the Indians’ version, many\r\ncouncils were held and a great deal of discussion ensued. Sometimes the\r\ndebates were rather strenuous and they all related to purchase of\r\nlands—to the further curtailing of the Sioux reservation—the same old\r\nstory. An intelligent educated Indian summed up their cause as follows:—\r\n\r\n“The lands secured by the treaty were divided into three classes. All\r\ntracts selected for farming or grazing purposes within a period of three\r\nyears from February 15, 1890, were to be sold at $1.25 per acre. Those\r\npurchased during the two years following were valued at seventy-five\r\ncents per acre. The portions remaining unsold after the expiration of\r\nfive years could be bought for fifty cents per acre. The money received\r\nfrom the sale of the land was to be placed in the United States\r\nTreasury, subject to interest, which was to be paid to the Indians at\r\nregular intervals.\r\n\r\n“Any Sioux whom his Agent considered qualified for supporting himself\r\nwas to be allowed to select for his own use a tract of land, the area of\r\nwhich was determined by the number of members in his family. Farming\r\nimplements and utensils, oxen or horses, seed, etc., and fifty dollars\r\nin cash were also to be given him. Notices to acquaint the Sioux with\r\nthis proposition were posted in conspicuous places in the agency\r\nbuildings, and every inducement was offered the people to take the land\r\nin severalty. So far, about one hundred at Rosebud, a smaller number at\r\nStanding Rock, and some two hundred at Pine Ridge have made applications\r\nto the Agents for allotments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MODERN SIOUX CABIN AND SUMMER TENT. PINE RIDGE, 1909\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Inquiries were made of many of the leading men on the reservation as to\r\nwhy more persons did not avail themselves of the Government’s liberal\r\noffer and become self-supporting. The Indians’ answers and their reasons\r\nfor not taking up land in severalty convinced all questioners not\r\nalready prejudiced that under the present condition of affairs it would\r\nbe impossible to interest more than a small percentage of the nation in\r\nagriculture.”[16]\r\n\r\nSome of the Indians’ statements may be denied in Washington. The Indians\r\nhave always maintained that many things are told them by Commissioners\r\nwhich are never carried into effect. I am quite aware that only the\r\nwritten recommendations are acted upon. That is, the report of a\r\nCommission may be quite different from the Indians’ ideas or\r\nunderstandings of the councils and the debates. Politicians will\r\ncultivate the good will of Indians just as they cultivate voters. The\r\npolitician frankly admits: “a platform is made to get in on.” The\r\nfailure to keep these promises, and the difference between the actual\r\nperformance and the words so freely uttered in the presence of the\r\nIndians, caused much dissatisfaction and paved the way for the Messiah\r\ncraze.\r\n\r\nAnother serious cause for complaint occurred after the Messiah craze\r\nstarted. Doctor Royer sent out the Indian police and brought in all the\r\nfriendly Indians, in order to differentiate them from the “hostiles.”\r\nThat is, he compelled all Indians who were not dancing, and those who\r\nwere lukewarm toward the Messiah doctrine, to move to the agency and\r\nlive in tents and canvas tipis under his direct supervision. When I\r\nreached Pine Ridge, these tents extended in little groups, here and\r\nthere, for two miles. As most of the Indians lived in log cabins, this\r\nfoolish order worked great hardship. Many of them lost stock, their\r\ncabins were broken into, and they were compelled to seek support from\r\nthe Government. Royer was forced to issue a great quantity of rations.\r\nAs the younger children, for the most part, were accustomed to living in\r\nthe log houses referred to, this change in winter to life in the open\r\nwas responsible for a heavy increase of diphtheria and other diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Indians bitterly complained and began to say they thought the\r\nGovernment had deliberately set about destroying the Pine Ridge Sioux.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the mismanagement, the ignorance, the suffering, and the\r\npresence of the troops, the progress of the Pine Ridge Sioux was delayed\r\nmany years, and much of the advancement of the previous ten years was\r\nforever lost. The only redeeming feature at Pine Ridge, in my opinion,\r\nwas the appointment of Major John R. Brennan as Agent. He took charge\r\nshortly after the military domination ended and after years of labor\r\nmanaged to inspire confidence in the Oglalas.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding pages describe the dance ceremonies as related to me at\r\nPine Ridge in November and December, 1890. I have left much of the\r\nnarrative in the present tense, as written then.\r\n\r\nThe Indians located in the Dakotas have been in the habit of visiting\r\nthe Utes and Arapahoes every summer for the purpose of trading. They\r\nalso hunted game en route. While the Sioux are unable to converse with\r\nthese tribes, means of communication is possible through the medium of\r\nthe sign-language, which was well understood by all Plains Indians. Most\r\nof the older Oglala, Miniconjou, and Brulé are able to use it at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOVERNMENT SCHOOL BUILDINGS; ON SITE OF “HOSTILES’ CAMP” OF 1890. PINE\r\n    RIDGE, 1909\r\n]\r\n\r\nKeeps-the-Battle (Kicizapi Tawa) told me a few days ago that it was\r\nduring the visit of the Pine Ridge Sioux last July that he first heard\r\nof the coming of the new Messiah. He related the following story:\r\n\r\n“Scarcely had my people reached the Ute village when we heard of a white\r\npreacher whom the Utes held in the highest esteem, who told a beautiful\r\ndream or vision of the coming of a great and good red man. This strange\r\nperson was to set aright the wrongs of my people; he could restore to us\r\nour game and hunting grounds, was so powerful that every wish or word he\r\ngave utterance to became fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“His teaching had a strange effect upon the Utes, and, in obedience to\r\nthe commands of this man, they began a Messiah dance.”\r\n\r\nKeeps-the-Battle further said that, immediately upon the arrival of the\r\nhunting-party at Pine Ridge, a small dance was held in imitation of the\r\nones they had seen while among the Utes, but that until the medicine men\r\nbegan to superintend the ceremonies nothing unusual occurred. The dances\r\nwere held every few days until the middle of August. Then, with scarcely\r\nany warning, a wild and general desire took possession of a large part\r\nof the nation to welcome the expected Messiah the moment he set foot\r\nupon earth. Mr. H. G. Galagher was then Agent, and, fearing that the\r\nenthusiasm of the Sioux under his charge might terminate in an outbreak,\r\nhe visited White Bird’s camp accompanied by fourteen Indian police. As\r\nhe approached the village, twenty warriors sprang out of the brush and,\r\ndrawing their Winchesters, called upon him to halt. They would not\r\npermit him to advance, and compelled the party to turn about and retrace\r\nits footsteps to the agency.\r\n\r\nThe news of this bold action spread like wildfire through the country,\r\nand being heralded and exaggerated by the daily press, caused many an\r\nuneasy and timid settler to prepare to remove to the nearest point upon\r\nthe railroad.\r\n\r\nThe news of the failure of the agent to stop the Messiah dance was\r\ncarried by couriers to the Indians at Rosebud and Standing Rock\r\nreservations, and the more susceptible persons became infatuated with\r\nthe new craze. Meetings and dances were arranged at points distant from\r\nthe agency posts, in order that no employee might interfere. Of course,\r\nboth the Sioux and the Whites were much excited. The former were ready\r\nand willing to throw off forever the odious yoke of oppression; the\r\nlatter, fearful for the safety of their homes and families.\r\n\r\nThe white people became frantic from fear, houses were barricaded and\r\nall Indians viewed with suspicion. A sensational press magnified events,\r\nand settlers accused many friendly Indians, who had joined the dance for\r\nno other purpose than worship, of hostile intentions. This accusation,\r\ncoupled with the arrival of some four or five times as many troops as\r\nwere necessary to subdue the small number of lodgers which later fled\r\ninto the borders of the Bad Lands, had the effect of turning the more\r\ntimid toward the agency, while the braver middle-aged and young men fled\r\nto the northward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SIOUX FARMING. WHITE CLAY CREEK, PINE RIDGE, 1909\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the mission of Agent Galagher last summer. It is quite\r\nnatural to suppose that the Agent was not a little frightened at his\r\nreception near “White Bird’s” camp, and, as subsequent events would seem\r\nto indicate, he feared to assert his authority and compel the Sioux to\r\ndiscontinue their dance. He hoped that in time the craze would die out\r\nwithout interference on his part. But instead of ceasing, the number\r\nparticipating increased, and really things began to assume a very\r\nthreatening aspect. Then came the change of Agents and Dr. D. F. Royer,\r\nof Alpina, South Dakota, succeeded Mr. Galagher. Royer was not the man\r\nfor so trying a post, and as both the Agents were political appointees,\r\ntrouble was certain to follow. And no sooner did Indians begin to dance\r\nthan Royer bombarded Washington with requests for troops. He sent a\r\nletter or telegram every day.\r\n\r\nThe dancers were not slow to take advantage of Galagher’s or Royer’s\r\nnon-interference, and a report gained wide circulation to the effect\r\nthat their Agent was afraid to command the police to arrest the\r\nprincipals in the dance. The medicine men and Indians of the same stamp\r\nas the late Sitting Bull, addressed the young men somewhat after the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n“Do you not see that the Whites on the reservation are afraid of you?\r\nWhy do you pray to great Wakantanka to send the Saviour on earth when\r\nthe remedy lies in your own hands? Be men, not children. You have a\r\nperfect right to dance upon your own reservation as much as you please,\r\nand you should exercise the rights, even if you find it necessary to use\r\nyour guns. Be brave, and the good and great Wakantanka will aid your\r\narms. Be cowards, and he will be ashamed of you.”\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the Messiah craze as it appeared in its purity.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all religious beliefs the candidate for admission to the\r\nchurch or body of worshippers is compelled to pass through certain\r\nceremonies. In our own day we maintain certain practices which have\r\nnothing whatever to do with one’s salvation, but which have been handed\r\ndown both by tradition and historical record, and on this account are\r\nsacredly preserved.\r\n\r\nThere do not appear to have been any special preparations on the part of\r\nthe candidates. The sweat-lodge was in frequent use, and many Indians\r\npurified themselves. The sweat-bath was common among the Sioux in\r\n1889–1890. But during the Messiah craze its use became widespread, and\r\nthe dancers thought it prepared them, or purified them, for the dance.\r\nThe pipe is also smoked during the sweat. When the young men issue from\r\ntheir bath the perspiration is fairly streaming from every pore. If it\r\nis not cold weather they plunge into a pool in the creek nearby, but if\r\nit is chilly they wrap blankets about their bodies. None of the Whites\r\nand half-breeds who have witnessed these things ever saw a Sioux rub\r\nhimself after issuing from the bath.\r\n\r\nThe largest camp of the dancers prior to the departure for the North was\r\nlocated upon Wounded Knee creek. Other camps of considerable extent\r\nexisted upon White Clay creek, four miles from the agency headquarters,\r\nupon Porcupine and Medicine Root streams. No Water’s camp became, later,\r\nthe general rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe shamans took the dance under their charge. One of them seemed to be\r\n“high priest,” or at least controlled the affair. Three or four\r\nassistants served, and had power to stop or start the dance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NO WATER’S CAMP OF GHOST DANCERS, 1890\r\n\r\n  A. Council Lodge. B. No Water’s Tipi\r\n  Sketch by Husté, Pine Ridge.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  Written in 1890, at Pine Ridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER X. THE DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral sweat-houses are erected in order to prepare the young men for\r\nthe dance. When a good number of young men, say fifty or sixty, have\r\ntaken the sweat-bath, and prepared themselves, the high priest and his\r\nassistants come forward. The high priest wears eagle-feathers in his\r\nhair, and a shirt reaching nearly to his knees. The assistants are\r\ndressed in similar manner, but wear no ornaments other than the\r\neagle-feathers. The dancers wear no ornaments whatsoever, and enter the\r\ncircle without their blankets.\r\n\r\nThat Indians should lay aside all ornaments and finery and dance without\r\nthe trappings which they so dearly love proves conclusively that some\r\npowerful religious influence is at work. In their other dances, (the\r\nOmaha, the Old Woman, the Sun) feathers and bangles; weapons, herbs or\r\npainted and plaited grasses; porcupine quills, horses’ tails and bits of\r\nfur-skins; necklaces, bells, silver discs, etc., are worn in great\r\nprofusion.\r\n\r\nAt Pine Ridge few candidates for “conversion” fasted. After they have\r\ncome forth from the sweat-house they are ready to enter the sacred\r\ncircle. The high priest runs quickly from the village to the open space\r\nof ground, five or six hundred yards distant, and, stationing himself\r\nnear the sacred tree, begins his chant as follows:\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear, all you persons!\r\n\r\n“Come, hurry up and dance, and when you have finished running in the\r\ncircle, tell these people what you have seen in the spirit land.\r\n\r\n“I myself have been in the spirit land and have seen many strange and\r\nbeautiful things, all of which my eyes tell me are good and true.”\r\n\r\nAs the speaker proceeds, the men and women crowd to the dance-ground.\r\nThey form two or three circles, according to the number of persons who\r\nwish to participate, and, grasping hands with fingers interlocked\r\n(“Indian grip”), the circles begin to move around toward the left.[17]\r\n\r\nIn the center, at No Water’s camp, stands the sacred tree. It is a\r\nnearly straight sapling thirty or forty feet high, trimmed of branches\r\nto a height of several feet. To the topmost twigs is attached a small\r\nwhite flag or canvas strip, supposed to be an emblem of purity, together\r\nwith some colored strips. The base of the tree is wrapped with rushes\r\nand flags to a thickness of some feet. Between the reeds the dancers\r\nfrom time to time thrust little gifts or peace-offerings. These\r\nofferings are supposed to allay the anger of the Great Spirit, and are\r\ngiven in perfectly good faith by the poor natives. They consist of small\r\npieces of calico, bags of tobacco, or pipes. During the height of\r\nexcitement, those worshippers most deeply affected cut small particles\r\nof flesh from their arms, and thrust these, also, between the rushes of\r\nthe holy tree.\r\n\r\nHenry Hunter (the Weasel, “Itonkasan”) informs me that after the dance\r\nhad been running some days, the rushes covering the base of the tree\r\nwere literally besmeared with human blood!\r\n\r\nAs the circle moves toward the left, the priest and his assistants cry\r\nout loudly for the dancers to stop a moment. As they pause he raises his\r\nhands toward the west, and upon all the people acting similarly, begins\r\nthe following remarkable prayer:\r\n\r\n“Great Spirit, look at us now. Grandfather and Grandmother have come.\r\nAll these good people are going to see Wakantanka, but they will be\r\nbrought safely back to earth. Everything that is good you will see\r\nthere, and you can have these things by going there. All things that you\r\nhear there will be holy and true, and when you return you can tell your\r\nfriends how spiritual it is.”\r\n\r\nAs he prays, the dancers cry aloud with all the fervor of religious\r\nfanatics. They moan and sob, many of them exclaiming: “Great Father, I\r\nwant you to have pity upon me.”\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely imagine the terrible earnestness of these people.\r\nGeorge E. Bartlett, and Mr. Sweeney, one of the agency school-teachers,\r\nthe chief herder, Mr. John Darr, and others, have informed me that\r\nduring their extended experience at the agency, of many years’ duration,\r\nthey have witnessed many different dances. They describe the scene of\r\nthe dance, especially at night, as most weird and ghostlike. The fires\r\nare very large, and shed a bright reflection all around; the breasts of\r\nthe worshippers heave with emotion; they groan and cry as if they were\r\nsuffering great agony, and the priest begs them to ask great Wakantanka\r\nto forgive their sins.\r\n\r\nAfter prayer and weeping, and offerings have been made to the sacred\r\npole, the dance is started again. The dancers go rather slowly at first,\r\nand as the priests in the center begin to shout and leap about, the\r\ndancers partake of the enthusiasm. Instead of moving with a regular\r\nstep, each person jumps backward and forward, up and down, as hard as he\r\nor she can without relinquishing their hold upon their neighbor’s hand.\r\nOne by one the dancers fall out of the ranks, some staggering like\r\ndrunken men, others wildly rushing here and there almost bereft of\r\nreason. Many fall upon the earth to writhe about as if possessed of\r\ndemons, while blinded women throw their clothes over their heads and run\r\nthrough brush or against trees. The priests are kept busy waving\r\neagle-feathers in the faces of the most violent worshippers. The feather\r\nis considered sacred, and its use, together with the mesmeric glance and\r\nmotion of the priest, soon causes the victim to fall into a trance or\r\ndeep sleep. Whether this sleep is real or feigned the writer does not\r\npretend to say, but sufficiently deep is it that Whites visiting the\r\ndance have been unable to rouse the sleepers by jest or blow.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the priests exercise an influence over the more\r\nsusceptible of the dancers akin to hypnotism. One of the young men, who\r\ndanced in the ghost circle twenty times, told me that the priest “Looked\r\nvery hard at us. Some of the young men and women could not withstand his\r\nsnake-like gaze, and did whatever he told them.”\r\n\r\nRegarding what is seen by the converts when in the spirit land, I have\r\nsecured interviews with three prominent Oglalas touching upon this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nLittle Wound said:\r\n\r\n“When I fell in the trance a great and grand eagle came and carried me\r\nover a great hill, where there was a village where the tipis were all of\r\nbuffalo hides, and we made use of the bow and arrow, there being nothing\r\nof white man’s manufacture in the beautiful land. Nor were any Whites\r\npermitted to live there. The broad and fertile lands stretched in every\r\ndirection, and were most pleasing to my eyes.\r\n\r\n“I was taken into the presence of the great Messiah, and he spoke to me\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n“‘My child, I am glad to see you. Do you want to see your children and\r\nrelations who are dead?’\r\n\r\n“I replied: ‘Yes, I would like to see my relations who have been dead a\r\nlong time. The God then called my friends to come up to where I was.\r\nThey appeared, riding the finest horses I ever saw, dressed in superb\r\nand most brilliant garments, and seeming very happy. As they approached,\r\nI recognized the playmates of my childhood, and I ran forward to embrace\r\nthem while the tears of joy ran down my cheeks.\r\n\r\n“We all went together to another village, where there were very large\r\nlodges of buffalo hide, and there held a long talk with the great\r\nWakantanka. Then he had some squaws prepare us a meal of many herbs,\r\nmeat, and wild fruits and ‘wasna’ (pounded beef and choke-cherries).\r\nAfter we had eaten, the Great Spirit prayed for our people upon the\r\nearth, and then we all took a smoke out of a fine pipe ornamented with\r\nthe most beautiful feathers and porcupine quills. Then we left the city\r\nand looked into a great valley where there were thousands of buffalo,\r\ndeer and elk feeding.\r\n\r\n“After seeing the valley, we returned to the city, the Great Spirit\r\nspeaking meanwhile. He told me that the earth was now bad and worn out;\r\nthat we needed a new dwelling-place where the rascally Whites could not\r\ndisturb us. He further instructed me to return to my people, the Sioux,\r\nand say to them that if they would be constant in the dance and pay no\r\nattention to the Whites he would shortly come to their aid. If the high\r\npriests would make for the dancers medicine-shirts and pray over them no\r\nharm could come to the wearer; that the bullets of any Whites that\r\ndesired to stop the Messiah dance would fall to the ground without doing\r\nanyone harm, and the person firing such shots would drop dead. He said\r\nthat he had prepared a hole in the ground filled with hot water and fire\r\nfor the reception of all white men and non-believers. With these parting\r\nwords I was commanded to return to earth.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GHOST DANCE AT NO WATER’S CAMP, 1890. Sketch by Husté.\r\n]\r\n\r\nJust after the dancers have been crying and moaning about their sins the\r\npriests strike up the first song, in which all join, singing with\r\ndeafening loudness. Some man or woman may be at this moment at the tree,\r\nwith his or her arms thrown about the rushes, sobbing as if their heart\r\nwould break; or another may be walking and crying, wringing his hands,\r\nor going through some motion to indicate the deepest sorrow for his\r\ntransgressions. So the singer cries aloud to his mother to be present\r\nand aid him. The appeal to the father refers, of course, to the Messiah,\r\nand its use in this connection is supposed to give emphasis to the\r\ndemand for the mother’s presence and hasten her coming.\r\n\r\n                              Ghost Dance\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  I na hé ku wó Mi sún ka la ché ya o ma’n i-ye Mi sún ka la ché ya\r\n\r\n  o ma’n i-ye I’ na hé ku wo i’ na hé ku wó A’ le hé ye lo a’ le hé ye\r\n\r\n  Mother come home. My little brother goes about always crying, my\r\n    little brother goes about always crying. Mother come home; Mother\r\n    come home. This the father says; this the father says.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                              Ghost Dance\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mi chínk shi nañ pe má yu za ye mi chink shi nañ pe má yu za ye\r\n\r\n  A’ le hé ye lo a’ le hé ye lo\r\n\r\n  My son, let me grasp your hand. My son, let me grasp your hand. This\r\n    the father says, This the father says.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second song requires a longer explanation. It expresses in brief the\r\ngoodness of the father. Some one of the dancers has come to life from\r\nthe trance, and has just related his or her experience in the other\r\nworld. The Messiah, or Father, has been very near to the subject, and\r\nthe high priest, enlarging upon the importance of this fact, runs about\r\nthe interior of the circle handing several pipes around, exclaiming that\r\nthese pipes were received direct from the Great Spirit, and that all who\r\nsmoke them will live. The people are worked up to such a pitch of\r\nreligious frenzy that their minds are now willing to receive any\r\nutterance as truth indisputable, so they pass around the pipes, singing\r\nthe song meanwhile. The repetition of the words, “This the Father says,”\r\nindicates that the God inspires all that is done.\r\n\r\nOne of the visions seen by a young woman when under the influence of the\r\ntrance, varied somewhat from the others. She told the following story:\r\n\r\n“I was carried into the beautiful land as others have been, and there I\r\nsaw a small but well-made lodge constructed entirely of rushes and\r\nreeds. These were woven closely together and resembled the fine\r\nbasket-work that many of our squaws make during the winter. The tipi was\r\nprovided with a stone wall, which was composed of small, flat stones\r\nlaid up against the walls to the height of three or four feet. In this\r\nlodge the great Wakantanka dwelt and would issue forth at noon. Promptly\r\nat the time when the sun was above me the lodge trembled violently and\r\nthen began its descent toward the earth. It landed near the\r\ndance-ground, and there stepped forth a man clothed in a blanket of\r\nrabbit-hides. This was the Messiah, and he had come to save us.”\r\n\r\nThe vision of Little Horse is still more remarkable. He said:\r\n\r\n“Two holy eagles transported me to the Happy Hunting Grounds. They\r\nshowed me the Great Messiah there, and as I looked upon his fair\r\ncountenance I wept, for there were nail-prints in his hands and feet\r\nwhere the cruel Whites had once fastened him to a large cross. There was\r\na small wound in his side also, but as he kept himself covered with a\r\nbeautiful mantle of feathers this wound could only be seen when he\r\nshifted his blanket. He insisted that we continue the dance, and\r\npromised me that no Whites should enter his city nor partake of the good\r\nthings he had prepared for the Indians. The earth, he said, was now worn\r\nout and it should be repeopled.\r\n\r\n“He had a long beard and long hair, and was the most handsome man I ever\r\nlooked upon.”\r\n\r\nBefore concluding my description of the dance as it appeared during the\r\nfirst few months of its existence at Pine Ridge, I would like to add\r\nthat the dances were held throughout the day usually, but that once in a\r\nwhile, when a village was especially devout, they were continued all\r\nnight. In that event food was prepared in large quantities, so that the\r\nworshippers could partake of refreshments when they desired.\r\n\r\nThe high priest frequently announces in a loud tone the visions related\r\nto him by the converts. His discourse is often interrupted by loud\r\ngrunts of approval on the part of the assembled natives. The personal\r\nexperience of the Weasel may be of interest:\r\n\r\n“While dancing I saw no visions, but the other Indians told me to not\r\nthink of anything in particular, but keep my eyes fastened upon the\r\npriests, and soon I would see all that they saw.\r\n\r\n“The first large dance held was on Wounded Knee Creek under the guidance\r\nof Big Road. I attended this one, but did not observe Two Strike in the\r\naudience. We had been dancing irregularly for several weeks when a\r\nrunner came into camp greatly excited, one night, and said that the\r\nsoldiers had arrived at Pine Ridge and were sent by the Great Father at\r\nWashington. The priests called upon the young men at this juncture not\r\nto become angry but to continue the dance, but have horses ready so that\r\nall could flee were the military to charge the village. So we mounted\r\nour ponies and rode around the hills all night singing our two songs.”\r\n\r\nI asked the Weasel: “Did you ever see the medicine-shirt worn?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they wore blessed shirts that night. The priests had said prayers\r\nover these garments, and they were bullet-proof. One girl tried to gash\r\nherself with a butcher-knife on the arm, but the blade was bent and the\r\nedge turned, so powerful was the medicine in the shirt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               CHAPTER XI. LOUIS SHANGRAUX AND THE TROOPS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout December 8th Louis Shangraux and some prominent Indians were sent\r\nout by the military to persuade the dancers to come in. December 15th we\r\nheard singing, and running out of our quarters, beheld thirty horsemen\r\nadvancing upon the agency. Following them were large numbers of the\r\n“hostiles”. Every man was superbly mounted and well armed. Six-shooters\r\nwere hung at their sides, while the gun-cases, neatly beaded and\r\nornamented, were strapped and hung along the saddles. The warriors drew\r\nup in front of the general’s (Brooke) headquarters, and as the last\r\nnotes of the song died away leaped from the animals’ backs. As they\r\ncrowded into the commanding officer’s presence, we who stood near had\r\nthe honor of shaking hands with these men. The general himself welcomed\r\nthem with words of commendation, for he thoroughly appreciated the\r\nefforts of the “friendlies” in the desire to prevent bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThat night, accompanied by my interpreter Bartlett, I visited the lodge\r\nof Scout Shangraux, and secured the following narrative regarding the\r\nexpedition and the intentions of the hostiles.\r\n\r\n“One week ago (the 8th) the general called me (Shangraux) into his\r\noffice, and told me he was very desirous of bringing in the hostiles\r\nwithout bloodshed. He said that the mission of Father Jutz had resulted\r\nin great good, that the Government scouts sent out had failed to reach\r\nthe campsite of Short Bull and Kicking Bear, and that all information\r\nregarding the strength of the hostiles was entirely unreliable.”\r\n\r\nLouis was given the power to select his party, and accordingly chose\r\nsome good, true men whom he knew could be depended upon in case of\r\ntrouble. No white man went with him, for it was believed the hostiles\r\nwould kill anyone not an Indian who should venture near the camp. From\r\nsubsequent events this was found to be true.\r\n\r\nThe camp is located on a plateau, 130 feet above the valley. But one\r\napproach is observed—a narrow path. Louis claimed the Indians had piled\r\nstones, or made breastworks. They possessed much ammunition and food;\r\ntwo springs afforded plenty of water, and their situation appears to\r\nhave been secure. Some little way off, in the valley, was a large\r\nvillage. “When we entered there were about 262 lodges present. One\r\nhundred and seventeen of these remained and 145 returned with us to the\r\nagency. The squaws and men came forward to greet us, and all seemed very\r\nfriendly. They supposed at first that we had come to join them, but when\r\nthey learned our true mission they seemed very suspicious, and refused\r\nfor some time to have anything to do with us. Just before we began the\r\ncouncil, which lasted the greater part of four days, the high-priest and\r\nhis helpers came forward and announced that there would be a\r\nGhost-dance. They formed a circle about the sacred tree and began their\r\nchant.\r\n\r\n“Of all the wild dancing I saw on Wounded Knee, this beat the record.\r\nPeople went into trances by the dozen, and the priests were kept busy\r\nrelating the experiences of the fainters. Several remained in trances as\r\nlong as twelve hours, and gave evidences of utter exhaustion when the\r\ndirectors aroused them.\r\n\r\n“Short Bull said: ‘I see the Messiah coming from the West. He is riding\r\nin a plain-wagon drawn by two mules and looks very much like a black\r\nman. If he is our Messiah we are greatly fooled. Now I see him again,\r\nand he is an Indian. Ah! wait; I see him the third time, and he is a\r\nwhite man. He tells me to send my children to school, to make large\r\nfarms, and not to fight any more. Do not fight, my children, unless the\r\nsoldiers first fire upon you.’\r\n\r\n“People were so excited they trembled all over, their eyes rolled, and\r\nthe muscles of their faces twitched. They were the most crazy Indians I\r\never beheld.”\r\n\r\nThe dancing continued for nearly thirty hours; then there was an\r\nintermission of several hours, during which a council was held in order\r\nto give audience to the friendlies. Short Bull and Two Strike (his real\r\nname is Nompagahpa, and a literal translation is, “Knocks down Two”),\r\naided by Crow Dog, championed the cause of the hostiles, while No Neck\r\nand Louis Shangraux spoke on behalf of the friendlies. Louis does not\r\nremember what he said in the first council, but the substance of his\r\nremarks could be put into one sentence:\r\n\r\n“The Agent will forgive you if you will return now, give you more\r\nrations, but not permit you to dance.”\r\n\r\nShort Bull’s (Tatankaptecelan) reply was so forcible as to remain in\r\nLouis’s memory in the exact words of the speaker, and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“I have risen today to tell you something of importance. You have heard\r\nthe words of the brothers from the agency camps, and if you have done as\r\nmyself, you have weighed them carefully. If the Great Father would\r\npermit us to continue the dance, would give more rations, and quit\r\ntaking away portions of the reservation, I would be in favor of\r\nreturning. But even if you (turning to Louis) say that he will, how can\r\nwe know whether you are telling the truth? We have been lied to so many\r\ntimes that we will not believe any words that your Agent sends to us. If\r\nwe return he will take away our guns and ponies, put some of us in jail\r\nfor stealing cattle and plundering houses. We prefer to stay here and\r\ndie, if necessary, to loss of liberty. We are free now and have plenty\r\nof beef, can dance all the time in obedience to the command of the Great\r\nWakantanka. We tell you to return to your Agent and say to him that the\r\nDakotas in the Bad Lands are not going to come in.”\r\n\r\nNo Neck rejoined:\r\n\r\n“Think, my people, how foolish is this action! Do come in, and all will\r\nbe well; remain out here and you will be killed.”\r\n\r\nShort Bull added:\r\n\r\n“It is better to die here as brave men, and in obedience to the commands\r\nof the Good Spirit, than to live like cowards at the agency on scanty\r\nrations, disarmed, without horses or guns. No, we will not return. If we\r\ndance, our Good Spirit will protect us, and if all dancers are sincere,\r\nthe bullets of the soldiers will fall harmlessly to the ground without\r\npower to hurt. There is no army so powerful that it can contend with\r\nWakantanka; therefore we are not afraid to remain here.”\r\n\r\nThe gathering broke up, and nearly every one continued in the\r\nGhost-dance. For two days the hostiles would not have further words with\r\nthe friendly scouts. Friday and Saturday, the 12th and 13th, the last\r\ncouncil was held. The scenes accompanying the closing of this gathering,\r\nSaturday afternoon, were very thrilling, and for a period of two hours\r\nit seemed as if a general battle would ensue between those who desired\r\nto return to the agency and the hostiles.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, Saturday, Two Strike—who had been one of the leaders in the\r\ndance—arose and announced his intention to return to the agency with the\r\nscouts, accompanied by about 145 lodges. Crow Dog (Kangisunka, the\r\nIndian who killed Spotted Tail about ten years ago) also announced his\r\nintention of returning. At this declaration from two such prominent men,\r\nShort Bull sprang to his feet and cried out, angrily:\r\n\r\n“At such a time as this we should all stick together like brothers. Do\r\nnot leave; remain with us. These men from the agency are not telling us\r\nthe truth; they will conduct you back to the agency and they will place\r\nyou in jail there. Louis is at the bottom of this affair.”\r\n\r\nAnd, running to the place where the guns were stacked, Short Bull\r\ngrasped his gun and, followed by many of his young men, surrounded\r\nShangraux. Louis’s situation was desperate. He knew these furious men\r\nmight kill him at the slightest resistance, so he laughed as\r\ngood-naturedly as possible under the circumstances and told them to put\r\nup their guns, as he was their friend instead of their enemy.\r\n\r\n“No, do not let the friendlies return,” cried the young men; “kill them,\r\nor compel them to remain with us. They will tell the Agent all they have\r\nseen and the soldiers will know how to enter our camp.”\r\n\r\nWith clubbed guns many of the desperate youths rushed upon the\r\nfriendlies and scouts, others cocked their Winchesters, and for a few\r\nmoments it looked as if poor Louis and No Neck, Two Strike and Crow Dog,\r\nwould lose their lives. Crow Dog sat upon the ground and drew his\r\nblanket over his head.\r\n\r\nThe wiser counsel prevailed, however, and after a great hubbub, in which\r\nseveral young men were knocked down, order was restored. One of the\r\nhorses and several of the dogs of the friendlies were shot during the\r\nmelee. When the 145 lodges started from the camp another difficulty\r\narose. It was during this trouble that Crow Dog made his famous, though\r\nbrief speech:\r\n\r\n“I am going back to White Clay (the location of the agency); you can\r\nkill me if you want to, now, and prevent my starting. The Agent’s words\r\nare true, and it is better to return than to stay here. I am not afraid\r\nto die.”\r\n\r\nSo, they started for home.\r\n\r\nImagine the surprise of the friendlies when, upon looking back from the\r\ntop of a ridge two miles distant, they saw the 117 lodges of hostiles\r\ncoming after them. They halted to wait for Short Bull to catch up, and\r\nthen the entire outfit moved toward the agency, all happy in the\r\nprospect of peace and forgiveness.\r\n\r\nBut the hopes of the friendlies were short-lived, for Short Bull became\r\nscared after having proceeded four miles farther, and together with his\r\nband, left the rear of the column and returned to the Bad Lands. Sunday\r\nand Monday morning the Indians moved along the trail, reaching Red\r\nCloud’s camp, in sight of the agency headquarters just before noon,\r\nMonday. Louis and the scouts had ridden ahead and reached the general’s\r\npresence as narrated in the forepart of this chapter.\r\n\r\nThese friendlies, added to the large number already in camp near the\r\nagency buildings, led all of us to hope the trouble was over. But during\r\nall the Pine Ridge excitement, up on the Missouri river, at Standing\r\nRock, Sitting Bull was in evidence, with some 150 followers.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the excitement, when Superintendent McLaughlin went to\r\nsee Sitting Bull at his camp on Grand River, and argued with him,\r\ncontending that the Messiah doctrine was false, Sitting Bull suggested\r\nthat both McLaughlin and himself together with attendants should visit\r\nthe Messiah in the far West. The truth or falsity of his doctrine would\r\nthen be apparent. If McLaughlin had agreed to this sensible proposition,\r\nmuch evil might have been avoided, but the Major refused to go, and\r\nthereby missed an opportunity of doing the Indians a service and\r\npreventing the subsequent massacre.\r\n\r\nIn November, the President ordered the Secretary of War to prepare for\r\naction, and Major John R. Brooke (now General) went to Pine Ridge. These\r\ntroops (of which we have seen there were a large number) were scattered\r\nabout through the Indian country.\r\n\r\nThe troops until the end of December, were either in camp near Pine\r\nRidge, or were scouting about in the country pursuing scattered bands of\r\nIndians. In the meantime, Sitting Bull was preparing to leave his\r\nreservation (Standing Rock) and flee into the Bad Lands to join the\r\nGhost dancers who had fled there from Pine Ridge. Both Mooney and Major\r\nMcLaughlin give accounts of what occurred at Sitting Bull’s. As\r\nMcLaughlin’s is the lengthier of the two, I shall reproduce that portion\r\nof it relating immediately to the death of Sitting Bull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE “INDIAN GATE,” PINE RIDGE, 1890\r\n\r\n  Down a ravine, to the right, the interpreter and myself used to creep\r\n    at night. Thus we reached the “hostiles’ camp” and obtained news.\r\n]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  This Chapter was written at Pine Ridge, December, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII: THE DEATH OF SITTING BULL, AND A TRAGEDY AT WOUNDED KNEE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Indian police brought Major McLaughlin information as\r\nto the intentions of the famous medicine man. The Major became convinced\r\nthat Sitting Bull must be arrested and confined, and he therefore sent a\r\nsquad of police under Lieutenant Bull Head. Among the thirty-nine Indian\r\npolicemen who made the arrest were four relatives. Aside from the\r\nofficer in charge, Bull Head, Red Tomahawk and Shave Head seem to have\r\nbeen the most prominent.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull’s settlement consisted of a number of houses stretched on\r\nthe banks of the Grand River for a distance of four or five miles. The\r\ngroup surrounding Sitting Bull’s cabin was comprised of half a dozen\r\nlog-cabins and a corral.\r\n\r\nThe police entered upon their mission in the night and arrived at\r\ndaylight. “Many of the houses were deserted, the Indians having been\r\nengaged in dancing the greater part of the previous night. The entrance\r\nof the policemen awakened the camp, but they saw no one, as Bull Head\r\nwheeled his men between the Sitting Bull houses and ordered them to\r\ndismount. Ten policemen, headed by Bull Head and Shave Head, entered one\r\nof the houses, eight policemen the other. In the house entered by Bull\r\nHead’s party they found the old medicine man, his two wives, and Crow\r\nFoot his son, a youth of seventeen years.\r\n\r\n“The women were very much frightened and began to cry. Sitting Bull sat\r\nup and asked what was the matter.\r\n\r\n“‘You are under arrest and must go to the agency,’ said Bull Head.\r\n\r\n“‘Very well,’ said Sitting Bull, ‘I will go with you.’ And he told one\r\nof his wives to go to the other house and bring him his best clothes. He\r\nshowed no concern at his arrest, but evidently wanted to make a good\r\nimpression and dressed himself with some care. He had also asked that\r\nhis best horse, a gray one, be saddled, and an Indian policeman had the\r\nanimal at the door by the time Sitting Bull was dressed and ready to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n“There had been no trouble in the house, and the police, when they\r\nwalked out, were surprised at the extent of the demonstration. They came\r\nout of the building in a little knot, Bull Head on one side of Sitting\r\nBull, Shave Head on the other, and Red Tomahawk directly behind. They\r\nhad been twenty minutes or more in Sitting Bull’s house, and it was in\r\nthe gray of the morning when they came out. They stepped out into a mass\r\nof greatly excited Ghost dancers, nearly all armed and crowding about\r\nthe main body of the police, who had held the way clear at the door. As\r\nSitting Bull stepped out with his captors he walked directly toward the\r\nhorse, with the evident intention of mounting and accompanying the\r\npolice. He was some distance from the door when his son, Crow Foot,\r\nseeing that the old man intended to make no resistance, began to revile\r\nhim:—\r\n\r\n“‘You call yourself a brave man and you have declared that you would\r\nnever surrender to a blue-coat, and now you give yourself up to Indians\r\nin blue uniforms,’ the young man shouted.\r\n\r\n“The taunt hit Sitting Bull hard. He looked into the mass of dark,\r\nexcited faces, and commenced to talk volubly and shrilly, and there was\r\na menacing movement in the crowd.\r\n\r\n“The last moment of Sitting Bull’s life showed him in a better light, so\r\nfar as physical courage goes, than all the rest of it. He looked about\r\nhim and saw his faithful adherents—about 160 crazed Ghost dancers—who\r\nwould have gone through fire at his bidding; to submit to arrest meant\r\nthe end of his power and his probable imprisonment; he had sure news\r\nfrom Pine Ridge that he, only, was needed to head the hostiles there in\r\na war of extermination against the white settlers. He made up his mind\r\nto take his chance, and screamed out an order to his people to attack\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\n“Instantly Catch-the-Bear and Strikes-the-Kettle, who were in the front\r\nrank of the crowd, fired at point-blank range, Catch-the-Bear mortally\r\nwounding First Lieutenant Bull Head, and Strikes-the-Kettle shooting\r\nFirst Sergeant Shave Head in the abdomen. Lieutenant Bull Head was a few\r\nyards to the left and front of Sitting Bull when hit, and immediately\r\nwheeling, he shot Sitting Bull through the body, and at the same instant\r\nSecond Sergeant Red Tomahawk, who with revolver in hand was rearguard,\r\nshot him in the right cheek, killing him instantly; the lieutenant, the\r\nfirst sergeant, and Sitting Bull falling together.\r\n\r\n“Sitting Bull’s medicine had not saved him, and the shot that killed him\r\nput a stop forever to the domination of the ancient regime among the\r\nSioux of the Standing Rock reservation.\r\n\r\n“The tale of the bloody fight that ensued has been told, and the world\r\nknows how those thirty-nine Indian policemen, with four of their\r\nrelatives who volunteered to accompany them,—a total of forty-three in\r\nall—fought off 160 Ghost dancers, eight of whom were killed and five\r\nwounded; how Second Sergeant Red Tomahawk, after the two higher ranking\r\npolice officers had been mortally wounded, took command and drove the\r\nIndians to the timber; how Hawk Man No. 1 ran through a hail of bullets\r\nto get the news to the cavalry detachment, and how six faithful friends\r\nof the Whites, policemen of the Standing Rock reservation, laid down\r\ntheir lives in doing their duty that morning. Two days later, on\r\nDecember 17, 1890, we buried Shave Head and four other Indian policemen\r\nwith military honors in the cemetery at Standing Rock, and, while\r\nCaptain Miner’s entire company of the Twenty-Second U. S. Infantry fired\r\nthree volleys over the graves of these red heroes, and a great concourse\r\nof the Sioux of the reservation stood in the chill bright sunlight of a\r\nfair winter’s day, mourning aloud for their dead, I quietly left the\r\nenclosure and joined a little burial-party in the military cemetery at\r\nFort Yates, situated about five hundred yards south of the agency\r\ncemetery. Four military prisoners dug the grave, and in the presence of\r\nA. R. Chapin, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A., H. M. Deeble, Acting\r\nAssistant Surgeon, U. S. A., Lieutenant P. G. Wood, U. S. A., Post\r\nQuartermaster, now Brigadier General, retired, and myself, the body of\r\nSitting Bull, wrapped in canvas and placed in a coffin, was lowered into\r\nthe grave.”[18]\r\n\r\nNaturally the death of Sitting Bull caused great commotion and many\r\nIndians joined the Ghost dancers. In spite of promises to the contrary,\r\nthey imagined that all those who had incurred the ill will of the\r\nauthorities were to be killed.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Major Brooke sent out American Horse with Two Strike and\r\nothers to persuade the rest of the Ghost dancers to come in. There were\r\na number of skirmishes in which a few persons were killed on each side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE CATHOLIC MISSION NEAR WOUNDED KNEE BATTLEFIELD, PINE RIDGE\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn December 28th, Major Whitside in charge of the Seventh Cavalry came\r\nup with Big Foot’s band. This same Indian, Big Foot, and his people were\r\ntraveling toward Pine Ridge agency. According to Mooney’s account,\r\nWhitside demanded unconditional surrender which was at once given. The\r\nIndians and the soldiers went into camp twenty miles northeast of Pine\r\nRidge agency. All of this was communicated to Major Brooke, who sent\r\nColonel Forsythe with four companies of the Seventh Cavalry to join\r\nWhitside. This gave Whitside a total of 470 men as against 106 warriors\r\nand a number of women and children, frequently estimated from 200 to\r\n250. The other Ghost dancers under Kicking Bear and Short Bull had been\r\npersuaded by American Horse and Little Wound to come in to the agency\r\nand were encamped at the Catholic mission, five miles out. December 29th\r\n(the next day) the officers ordered the Indians to be disarmed. In the\r\ncenter of the camp of the Indians a white flag had been erected. Early\r\nin the morning a battery of four Hotchkiss guns had been posted, and\r\nthese were trained on the Indian camp. The cavalry was placed in squads\r\nat various angles, almost entirely surrounding the Indians, or at least\r\non the flank. Chief Big Foot was ill with pneumonia, and the troops had\r\nprovided him with a tent warmed by a camp stove. About eight o’clock in\r\nthe morning the men were ordered to give up their guns. Following\r\nMooney’s account further, twenty of them came out with only two guns.\r\nThe Indians seemed unwilling to give them up, and some of the soldiers\r\nwere ordered to go into the tents and secure them. Mooney says that this\r\nsearch consumed time and created excitement. My information is to the\r\neffect that the soldiers threw things about in the tents and took guns\r\naway from those who had them; many children were badly frightened and\r\nbegan to cry, and the Indians were now told by the shaman, Yellow Bird,\r\nthat they were to be disarmed and then killed. I was told that the\r\nmedicine man threw dust high in the air and it broke like a little cloud\r\nand then the massacre began. Mooney presents the same idea, in a little\r\ndifferent form.\r\n\r\nWhile this searching had continued, a large part of the soldiers had\r\nbeen ordered up to within ten yards of the Indians, which further added\r\nto their terror and convinced them that Yellow Bird spoke the truth,\r\nthat they were all to be shot down.\r\n\r\nOne or two Indians drew revolvers or rifles and fired upon the soldiers,\r\nwho returned the fire, killing almost half the warriors at the first\r\ndischarge of their guns. Many sticks were afterwards set up at this\r\nplace by the Indians. The survivors sprang to their feet, seized knives,\r\nclubs or the few remaining guns, and fought desperately.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, other troops operated the Hotchkiss guns and\r\nsent a storm of shells and bullets among the women and children standing\r\nor running about the tipis. Mooney says “the guns poured in two-pound\r\nexplosive shells at the rate of fifty per minute, mowing down everything\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n“The terrible effect may be judged from the fact that one woman\r\nsurvivor, Blue Whirlwind, with whom the author conversed, received\r\nfourteen wounds, while each of her two little boys were also wounded by\r\nher side. In a few minutes 200 Indian men, women and children, with\r\nsixty soldiers, were lying dead and wounded on the ground, the tipis had\r\nbeen torn down by the shells and some of them were burning above the\r\nhelpless wounded, and the surviving handful of Indians were flying in\r\nwild panic to the shelter of the ravine, pursued by hundreds of maddened\r\nsoldiers and followed up by a raking fire from the Hotchkiss guns, which\r\nhad been moved into position to sweep the ravine.\r\n\r\n“There can be no question that the pursuit was simply a massacre, where\r\nfleeing women, with infants in their arms, were shot down after\r\nresistance had ceased and when almost every warrior was stretched dead\r\nor dying on the ground. On this point such a careful writer as Herbert\r\nWelsh says: ‘From the fact that so many women and children were killed,\r\nand that their bodies were found far from the scene of action, and as\r\nthough they were shot down while flying, it would look as though blind\r\nrage had been at work, in striking contrast to the moderation of the\r\nIndian police at the Sitting Bull fight when they were assailed by\r\nwomen.’ The testimony of American Horse and other friendlies is strong\r\nin the same direction. Commissioner Morgan in his official report says\r\nthat ‘Most of the men, including Big Foot, were killed around his tent,\r\nwhere he lay sick. The bodies of the women and children were scattered\r\nalong a distance of two miles from the scene of the encounter’.”\r\n\r\nI agree with Mooney, that a man should not criticize the soldiers of his\r\nown country. As for the shooting of armed warriors, we will all give\r\nassent. As to the murder of women and children, whose only thought was\r\nto escape with their lives, one may not trust himself to write in\r\nmoderation. The Indians told me that many of the Seventh Cavalry troops\r\ncried out, “Remember Custer,” as they pursued little boys and girls and\r\ndestroyed them. We might as well draw the veil of charity over the\r\nconcluding scene—the pursuit and the butchery.\r\n\r\nThere was one heroic character, Father Kraft, of the Catholic mission,\r\nPine Ridge. He spoke Sioux fluently and endeavored to stop the fight. He\r\nwas stabbed through the lungs, yet with bullets flying about him, he\r\nadministered the last rites of the church to the dying until he fell\r\nunconscious. Mooney pays him a deserved tribute. The Indians were so\r\nexcited that they did not recognize him, claiming that he had on a\r\nsoldier’s overcoat because of the cold. Mooney affirms this is not\r\ncorrect, but that he wore his priestly robes.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of the massacre of Wounded Knee was the stampeding\r\nof all the Indians into the hills. They believed that they were to be\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miles adopted harsh measures against the Indians and they soon\r\nsurrendered all their guns and came in to the agency.\r\n\r\nDoctor McGillicuddy, the former Agent at Pine Ridge, who was entirely\r\nfamiliar with the events, stated to Mooney on January 15, 1891, “Up to\r\ndate there has been neither a Sioux outbreak nor war. No citizen in\r\nNebraska or Dakota has been killed, molested, or can show the scratch of\r\na pin, and no property has been destroyed off the reservation. Only a\r\nsingle non-combatant was killed by the Indians, and that was close to\r\nthe agency. The entire time occupied by the campaign, from the killing\r\nof Sitting Bull to the surrender at Pine Ridge, was only thirty-two\r\ndays. The late hostiles were returned to their homes as speedily as\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\nThe Indians quit, but the white people did not. On January 11th, some\r\nwhite people led by three brothers named Culbertson,[19] pursued an aged\r\nOglala, who was a very friendly Indian, for many miles. His name was Few\r\nTails, and he was accompanied by his wife, another Indian named One\r\nFeather, his wife and two children. They had been hunting in the Black\r\nHills and had a pass from the agency. They were returning in two wagons\r\nloaded with meat. The Culbertson brothers and these other white men\r\nfired on Few Tails, killing that Indian and both ponies attached to that\r\nwagon. His wife jumped out and received two bullets, bringing her down.\r\nMooney says that the murderers then attacked the other wagon shooting\r\nthe wife of One Feather, but as she was not badly hurt, she drove away\r\nas rapidly as possible and the Indian leaped upon one of the spare\r\nponies and held off the white men for eight or ten miles. They again\r\ncame up, and he turned and fought them off while his wife drove ahead\r\nwith the wagon.\r\n\r\nThe senseless panic had seized upon all settlers in the country because\r\nof the Ghost dance and the Wounded Knee fight. This is illustrated by\r\nMooney’s concluding description of the first part of the fight.\r\n\r\n“As they drove they passed near a house, from which several other shots\r\nwere fired at the flying mother, when her husband again rode up and kept\r\noff the whole party until the wagon could get ahead. Finally, as the\r\nponies were tired out, this heroic man abandoned the wagon and put the\r\ntwo children on one of the spare ponies and his wounded wife and himself\r\nupon another and continued to retreat until the Whites gave up the\r\npursuit. He finally reached the agency with the wife and children.”\r\n\r\nTo give readers an adequate conception of what has too frequently\r\noccurred in the West, I desire to state that while One Feather and his\r\nfamily escaped, wounded, the wife of the other Indian, Few Tails, was\r\nshot twice, and lay helpless on the ground all night. In the morning she\r\nfound one of the ponies alive, and mounted it and reached a settler’s\r\nhouse fifteen miles away.\r\n\r\n“Instead of meeting help and sympathy, however, she was driven off by\r\nthe two men there with loaded rifles, and leaving her horse in her\r\nfright, she hurried away as well as she could with a bullet in her leg\r\nand another in her breast, passing by the trail of One Feather’s wagon\r\nwith the tracks of his pursuers fresh behind it, until she came near a\r\ntrader’s store about twenty miles farther south. Afraid to go near it on\r\naccount of her last experience, the poor woman circled around it, and\r\ncontinued, wounded, cold, and starving as she was, to travel by night\r\nand hide by day until she reached the Bad Lands. The rest may be told in\r\nher own words:\r\n\r\n“‘After that I traveled every night, resting daytime, until I got here\r\nat the beef corral. Then I was very tired, and was near the military\r\ncamp, and early in the morning a soldier came out and he shouted\r\nsomething back, and in a few minutes fifty men were there, and they got\r\na blanket and took me to a tent. I had no blanket and my feet were\r\nswelled, and I was about ready to die. After I got to the tent a doctor\r\ncame in—a soldier doctor, because he had straps on his shoulders—and\r\nwashed me and treated me well.”\r\n\r\n“A few of the soldiers camped near the scene of the attack had joined in\r\nthe pursuit at the beginning, on the representations of some of the\r\nmurderers, but abandoned it as soon as they found their mistake.\r\nAccording to all the testimony, the killing was a wanton, unprovoked,\r\nand deliberate murder, yet the criminals were acquitted in the local\r\ncourts. The apathy displayed by the authorities of Meade county, South\r\nDakota, in which the murder was committed, called forth some vigorous\r\nprotests. Colonel Shatter, in his statement of the case, concludes,\r\nreferring to the recent killing of Lieutenant Casey: ‘So long as Indians\r\nare being arrested and held for killing armed men under conditions of\r\nwar, it seems to me that the white murderers of a part of a band of\r\npeaceful Indians should not be permitted to escape punishment.’ The\r\nIndians took the same view of the case, and when General Miles demanded\r\nof Young-man-afraid-of-his-horses the surrender of the slayers of Casey\r\nand the herder Miller, the old chief indignantly replied: ‘No; I will\r\nnot surrender them, but if you will bring the white men who killed Few\r\nTails, I will bring the Indians who killed the white soldier and the\r\nherder; and right out here in front of your tipi I will have my young\r\nmen shoot the Indians and you have your soldiers shoot the white men,\r\nand we will be done with the whole business.”\r\n\r\n“In regard to the heroic conduct of One Feather, the officer then in\r\ncharge of the agency says: ‘The determination and genuine courage, as\r\nwell as the generalship he manifested in keeping at a distance the six\r\nmen who were pursuing him, and the devotion he showed toward his family,\r\nrisking his life against great odds, designate him as entitled to a\r\nplace on the list of heroes’.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “This monument is erected by surviving relatives and other Oglala and\r\n    Cheyenne River Sioux Indians in memory of the Chief Big Foot\r\n    Massacre, Dec. 29, 1890.\r\n\r\n  “Col. Forsythe in command of V. S. Troops.\r\n\r\n  “Big Foot was a great Chief of the Sioux Indians. He often said ‘I\r\n    will stand in peace till my last day comes.’ He did many good and\r\n    brave deeds for the White man and the Redman.\r\n\r\n  “Many innocent women and children who knew no wrong, died here.\r\n\r\n  “The erection of this monument is largely due to the financial\r\n    assistance of Joseph Horncloud, whose father was killed here.”\r\n\r\n         * * * * *\r\n\r\n  This was paid for, and put up by Indians—not white people.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI present as an illustration in this book, the little monument erected\r\non the Wounded Knee battlefield by the Sioux themselves some years after\r\nthe massacre. It was dedicated in the presence of a great concourse of\r\nIndians. The inscription is given in Sioux on one side of the shaft, in\r\nEnglish on the other. The War Department rather objected to it, so I was\r\ntold, but it still stands as a monument typifying our treatment of the\r\nIndian in these modern days.\r\n\r\nSome of the Sioux are still backward, and there are quite a number who\r\ndo not attend the Protestant or Catholic missions. If one will talk with\r\nthese so-called “non-progressives,” one may hear them say, “We have not\r\nforgotten Wounded Knee.”\r\n\r\nA few brief concluding statements are in order. A perusal of this long\r\nnarrative indicates that at the first the dance was a purely religious\r\nceremony. The Sioux were deadly in earnest, they were sincere. They\r\ndanced day and night until they dropped from exhaustion. There was\r\nnothing like it, so far as I can ascertain, in recent times in North\r\nAmerica. They were in a frenzy. Yet there was no thought of war.\r\nRevivals among Protestant denominations in this country (especially in\r\nremote districts) frequently develop religious mania. Many older persons\r\nremember the “Camp Meetings” of the West and South in which people “got\r\nreligion.” The interference of police or troops at such a gathering\r\nwould bring on a riot among the white Christians participating in the\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nNegroes of the South have been known to become insensible for hours—to\r\nenter a cataleptic state—and to relate visions on recovering. Hysteria\r\nat religious gatherings in the South is common among negroes.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, a religious mania is not surprising among\r\nIndians, who sought, as we have seen, salvation out of troubles. In fact\r\nthe craze was induced by their wretched condition.\r\n\r\nThere was no danger at any time at Pine Ridge. What we did, not once,\r\nbut on many nights, is proof of the assertion. There were a number of\r\nnewspaper men in the little log hotel at Pine Ridge, and they sent many\r\nsensational accounts to the Eastern papers. Not one of them ever left\r\nthe agency, until the battle of Wounded Knee had occurred, when a few\r\nwent out to look over the field. Mr. Bartlett, who spoke Sioux quite\r\nwell, and myself, were the only men to my knowledge who left the agency\r\nand visited the camps in the valley, one or two miles distant. The fact\r\nthat we were able to do so, is sufficient refutation of the statement\r\nthat the Indians desired to fight, or were savages. Both of us would\r\nhave been killed were this statement true. We never experienced the\r\nslightest trouble, but on the contrary were afforded every facility. We\r\noften felt guns and revolvers under the blankets on which we reclined in\r\nthe tipis. Force caused Wounded Knee. Humanity would have prevented it.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  My Friend the Indian, pages, 219–222.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  One had served time in the penitentiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                CHAPTER XIII. THE FIVE CIVILIZED TRIBES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the largest body of Indians in the United States. They reside in\r\nthe State of Oklahoma and number, according to the Commissioner’s\r\nreport,[20] 101,216. The Five Civilized Tribes are composed of southern\r\nIndians. A consideration of their tribal customs and ethnology will be\r\npresented in the next volume of my history. While the Indians follow\r\nsome of their ancient customs, the bulk of them have so far departed\r\nfrom the faith of their fathers, that it is advisable to consider their\r\npresent life and needs, rather than their past.\r\n\r\nThe report on these Indians for the year ending June 30th, 1913, and\r\nsigned by J. George Wright, Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes,\r\nDana H. Kelsey, Superintendent of Union Agency, and John B. Brown,\r\nSupervisor of Education, lies before me. According to this, they are\r\ndivided among the tribes as follows:—\r\n\r\n                      Cherokees            41,706\r\n                      Choctaws             24,973\r\n                      Creeks               18,700\r\n                      Chickasaws           10,989\r\n                      Seminoles             3,119\r\n                      Mississippi Choctaws  1,639\r\n\r\nThese Indians are known by ethnologists to belong to the great\r\nMuskhogean stock, and lived in the South, east of the Mississippi. They\r\nconstitute a third of our Indian population. As to why they were\r\nremoved—that is another story. Suffice it to say that the year 1850\r\nfound them in that region known as Indian Territory. Here they located\r\nupon large tracts of tribal land amounting to 19,475,614 acres.\r\n\r\nTreaties setting forth that they were to remain in undisturbed\r\npossession of their new homes were duly signed by the United States\r\nGovernment. Although the treaty of 1866 stipulated that they were\r\nentitled to send a delegate to our Congress, when Congress authorized\r\nthe admission of a representative from Indian Territory, and in spite of\r\nthe fact that some of the tribes made an effort to bring about this\r\nresult, nothing effectual was ever accomplished.\r\n\r\nMay 2, 1890, the laws of Arkansas were extended to cover Indian\r\nTerritory, and March 3, 1901, every Indian of the Territory was declared\r\nto be a citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nMarch 3, 1893, President Cleveland appointed the famous Dawes\r\nCommission. This undertook to allot to all the Indians of the Five\r\nCivilized Tribes lands in severalty. There were 200,000 claimants and\r\nabout 90,000 were allotted.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am tempted to present a mass of statistics and facts proving\r\nthat these most advanced Indians were robbed and despoiled, without let\r\nor hindrance, that the treaties made with them were cooly set aside,\r\nstatehood promises broken, and finally even the very farms and tracts,\r\non which they were to live as citizens and enjoy the blessings of\r\nliberty and equality, were taken away, I must confine myself to a\r\nconsideration of the subject in its broad aspect.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by apologists that Indian Territory became an impossible\r\ncountry in which to live, that crime was rampant, and that the Five\r\nNations included among their membership thousands of outlaws and\r\nrobbers. This is a gross exaggeration. There were some hundreds of\r\nundesirable citizens who made Indian Territory their habitat from just\r\nprevious to the Civil War to about the year 1880. Most of these were\r\nwhite men, although there was a sprinkling of mixed-bloods and that\r\nworst citizen, the individual whose blood is made up of a mixture of\r\nnegro, Indian and white. The older Indians, who are more competent to\r\njudge, and many of the white persons who long ago settled in Oklahoma,\r\nmaintain that while this class of citizens caused a good deal of\r\ntrouble, yet on the whole the Indians were vastly better off between the\r\nyears 1855 and 1900 than they are at the present time.[21] There was\r\nsome violence, murder, train robbing and attendant evils. As against\r\nthis, however, the great body of Indians were self-supporting, there was\r\nno general graft, and very little pauperism.[22] There is evidence of\r\nthe correctness of this statement even at the present time. In traveling\r\nthrough Oklahoma, overland, for 600 miles, I noticed in scores of places\r\nthe type of house erected by the Indians forty or fifty years ago either\r\nstill standing or in ruins. Their houses were superior, as a rule, to\r\nthe present flimsy, cheap structures erected either by the natives\r\nthemselves, or by Government or State employees for the Indians. The old\r\nhouses were of logs, or heavy boards, the walls being thick. They were\r\nthus cool in summer and warm in winter. Near every house was an orchard.\r\nThe tracts owned by the Indians were extensive, and cattle, horses and\r\nhogs had free range. Thus, every Indian family was assured necessary\r\nbeasts of burden and meat for winter use. Now that the allotments have\r\npassed into the hands of white persons, or are restricted in size, or\r\nare leased, practically everything is fenced, there are no ranges of\r\nconsequence; the old-style house is gone, the trees in the orchards have\r\ndecayed and fallen, or are cut down, most of the remaining orchards are\r\nthose of white people, although, of course, a few Indian orchards\r\nsurvive. The houses built for the Indians, or by them, are wretched\r\naffairs, small, the walls thin, and not substantial. They are hot in\r\nsummer and cold in winter.\r\n\r\nThe Indians having settled down in Oklahoma under their various tribal\r\ngovernments, made great progress.[23] They published papers in their own\r\nlanguage. The Cherokee capital at Talequah contained creditable\r\nbuildings—a good administration building and two fine Indian schools,\r\nwhich may be seen on pages 138 and 146. This school, by the way, built\r\nby the Cherokee Indians with their own money, is now occupied by white\r\npupils. It was the finest building I observed in all Oklahoma, and it is\r\na standing repudiation to the statement that the Indians were not\r\nprogressing and that they did not afford proper educational facilities\r\nto their own people.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Civil War, a number of outlaws belonging to guerilla\r\nbands, both North and South, came into the State. White persons migrated\r\nto the country and occupied it. The Indians complained, and our\r\nauthorities at Washington made a few abortive attempts to keep them out,\r\nbut, as inevitably, the whites dominated. The Dawes Commission was\r\nformed, and after years of negotiation and coercion, enrollment of the\r\nIndians began. The rolls are now completed and include the totals\r\nmentioned in my statistics upon a previous page.\r\n\r\nThere were a few Indians who held out against this arbitrary action on\r\nour part, and right here I wish to pay a compliment to a few old men and\r\nwomen, who were treated with contempt, who were called “Snakes” in the\r\nCreek and “Nighthawks” in the Cherokee nation by the unthinking. Why?\r\nFor the reason that they have a simple, a child-like faith in the great\r\nUnited States Nation. They believe that we will keep our pledged word.\r\nThey are not educated and therefore they cannot grasp the essentials of\r\nour civilization as it applies toward Indians; that when we execute a\r\nninety-nine year lease among ourselves, we keep it; but that a solemn\r\ncovenant entered into with the Indians is a very different matter. So\r\nthese poor old Snakes and Nighthawks refused to be enrolled and to\r\nreceive allotments, trusting in the honesty and integrity of the Great\r\nFather at Washington. One of the most pathetic sights I ever witnessed\r\nin my life, was when old Fixico Harjo and Okoskee Miller, and a few\r\nother fine old men, of the best type of American Indian, called my\r\nattention to our solemn covenant with these people, stating that they\r\nwere helpless, that allotments had been forced upon them, that they\r\nexpected to see even these little tracts taken away from them, that they\r\ncould not understand the speeches of the clever, shrewd, oily,\r\nforked-tongued lawyers and land-buyers who came among them; they asked\r\nnot charity but justice. The only thing in this world that was positive,\r\nthat was true, that was inevitable, was this fact: that every time they\r\ntouched a pen they lost something; that every promise made to them by a\r\nwhite man was broken; that they had abandoned all hope save one—that\r\nwhen they are gathered to their fathers, in the great beyond, they hope\r\nto find some place where they may live in peace and contentment, as in\r\nancient days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CRISIS IN OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\nWhenever a crisis arises in the affairs of the Nation, there are always\r\nmen to meet it, and while the forces of evil have conspired against the\r\nIndian, there have arisen a few champions, and we should not forget the\r\nservice such persons have rendered. Some of them have gone down to\r\nhonorable defeat induced by hatred, treachery, malice and the love of\r\ngain. Others continue in office, escaping the wiles of the enemy, not\r\nthrough a miracle, but through the arousing of the public conscience.\r\nToday there are some 2,000,000 people in the State of Oklahoma, and as\r\nin every other State, the great majority of them are upright citizens.\r\nThey have not taken a firm stand for the Indian in the past, for the\r\nreason that they did not realize what was going on in the eastern part\r\nof their State. The grafters controlled a tremendous and effective\r\npropaganda. The extent of this is surprising, and I have received scores\r\nof circulars, copies of speeches, etc., as evidence of the determined\r\naction of those who covet the oil, coal, gas, asphalt, farm lands, and\r\ntimber tracts of the Five Civilized Tribes. Every person who is\r\nendeavoring to bring about fair play in eastern Oklahoma was charged\r\nwith being “perniciously active in politics”, if he lived in the State\r\nof Oklahoma. If he happened to reside in the East, he was either a\r\n“sentimentalist”, unfamiliar with Indian affairs, or guilty of\r\nbesmirching the fair name of the State of Oklahoma. The better class of\r\ncitizens in the State of Oklahoma became, at last, aroused to the\r\ndeplorable conditions obtaining among these Indians and they succeeded\r\nin influencing not only the members of Congress but also the Secretary\r\nof the Interior and Commissioner of Indian Affairs to call a halt.\r\n\r\nThe lengths to which a few people went in order to despoil the Indians\r\nseems incredible in this day of Christianity and civilization. Some men\r\nmade contracts with Indians on a basis of fees of high percentage and\r\nsought to secure control of Indian moneys in the United States Treasury.\r\nOthers made contracts with thousands of Indians to represent them in the\r\nsale of vast tribal estates—tens of millions of dollars—on a liberal\r\ncommission basis. Others became guardians and administrators of estates;\r\nand there were thousands of these professional guardians. The thing\r\nbecame a national scandal. Covetousness overwhelmed eastern Oklahoma.\r\nNow and then some man sought to stem the tide. A judge was assaulted in\r\ncourt by a grafter. He called upon his court officers. They,\r\nsympathizing with the assailant, did not aid his honor, but merely\r\nlooked on while the grafter beat the judge into insensibility.\r\n\r\nAn editor commented upon a certain county judge, before whom guardians\r\nand administrators had appeared, and told some plain truths concerning\r\nthe manner in which minors’ estates were being dissipated. The judge\r\ndrew a knife and stabbed the editor. In neither of these cases were the\r\nguilty persons punished. What went on throughout the length and breadth\r\nof eastern Oklahoma seems incredible. I refer readers to the various\r\narticles cited in my bibliography at the conclusion of Chapter XVI for\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nMatters became so serious that Hon. M. L. Mott, attorney for the Creek\r\nIndians, decided to sacrifice his career in that country in order to\r\nobtain justice. He sent the facts concerning the despoilation of\r\nthousands of Creek minors and incompetents to Honorable Charles H.\r\nBurke, Representative from South Dakota. On December 13, 1912, Honorable\r\nMr. Burke made a speech in the House of Representatives which aroused\r\nthe good people of Oklahoma and Congress itself to immediate action.[24]\r\n\r\nRev. J. S. Murrow, in charge of a large and successful mission at Atoka,\r\nOklahoma, published a pamphlet, at his own expense, of thirty-nine pages\r\ncovering the present condition of the Five Civilized Tribes and pleading\r\nthat the ministers of the gospel residing in the State, without regard\r\nto denomination, do what they could to secure humane and just treatment\r\nfor the Indians.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate Barnard, Commissioner of Charities and Corrections for the\r\nState, also entered the righteous cause, exposing conditions among\r\norphan children, and pointed out how that thousands of paupers would\r\nhave to be supported by the National Government, or the State of\r\nOklahoma, if more restrictions to the alienation of Indian lands were\r\nremoved. As a reward for her faithful and humane efforts, Miss Barnard’s\r\noffice is virtually abolished, since appropriations are cut off.\r\n\r\nGrant Foreman is an attorney living in Muskogee. He has made particular\r\nstudy of the Indian situation and is entirely familiar with all the\r\nlegal aspects, as well as the Indians themselves. Mr. Foreman has\r\nrendered valuable assistance to Mr. Mott, but has never held office in\r\nthe State, or been employed in the Indian Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHEROKEE FEMALE SEMINARY AT TALEQUAH, OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n  Built with Indian money twenty years ago. Now used as a White Normal\r\n    School.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Department of Justice was represented by A. N. Frost, Esq., and J.\r\nE. Gresham, Esq. Both of these men proceeded against grafters, and both\r\nare out of the Service.\r\n\r\nThe Federal supervision of the Five Civilized Tribes has rested in\r\nCommissioner J. George Wright and Dana H. Kelsey, Superintendent of the\r\nUnion Agency. These men have been years in the Service. They have shown\r\nhigh integrity, tact and wisdom in handling a most delicate situation.\r\nUnder them are employed hundreds of persons—District Agents, teachers,\r\nclerks, farmers, matrons, etc. Because of the rapid expansion of the oil\r\nindustry in Oklahoma and the discovery of new fields, many of the Indian\r\nallotments have become very valuable. Naturally, these are coveted by\r\nwhite men who never seek Indian property unless it is valuable. In this\r\nconnection I wish to call attention to what, in Oklahoma, is considered\r\na great joke on certain white men. Before the discovery of oil, these\r\nmen secured, where possible, large tracts of rich agricultural land. The\r\nhilly sections were allotted to the more ignorant Indians, the shrewder\r\nselected the bottom-lands. Through the irony of fate, the richest\r\noilfields have been discovered in these same hilly or worthless tracts\r\npassed up by the first grafters. So, in spite of all that has been done\r\nto seize Indian lands, many of the incompetent Indians receive large\r\nroyalties from the oil wells.[25] As these incompetents are under\r\nGovernment supervision, bills to remove restrictions have been agitated.\r\nMany of the candidates for Congress ran upon a platform which may be\r\ndescribed as anti-Indian—contrary to all State promises, sacredly made.\r\nI have original handbills, such as are used in Oklahoma elections. Mr.\r\nJ. H. Maxey presents his portrait and says:\r\n\r\n“The Government Must Pay the Taxes on All Non-Taxable Indian Land”; “The\r\nAffairs of the Five Tribes Must Be Settled.” Mr. Reuben M. Roddie is\r\neven more frank. Over his picture appears in large letters:—“Pay the\r\nIndians Their Money and Remove all Restrictions.” Mr. Roddie was\r\ndefeated and the Hon. Wm. M. Murray, long a friend of the Indian, was\r\nreturned to Congress.\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman prepared for me a comprehensive statement of conditions in\r\nOklahoma. It is the best presentation of the subject that I have seen\r\nand I herewith include it, in the following eight pages.\r\n\r\n“The lands of the Indians were allotted to them with restrictions\r\nagainst alienation or encumbrance. The Creek land was restricted to\r\nAugust 8, 1907; the Choctaw and Chickasaw lands could be sold one-fourth\r\nin one year, one-fourth in three years and the remainder in five years\r\nfrom date of patent. The Cherokee land could not be sold for five years.\r\nOut of each allotment a homestead was reserved, which under the law\r\nallotting it, could not be sold or taxed for twenty-one years. This was\r\na condition agreed to by the Government in order to get the Indians to\r\nconsent to the allotment of their lands. The Creek, Seminole and\r\nCherokee homestead was 40 acres and the Choctaw and Chickasaw 160 acres.\r\nDirectly after the allotting began, a great clamor went up from the\r\nwhite people to Congress to remove the restrictions on the sale of a\r\npart of the lands allotted. In response to this demand, on April 21,\r\n1904, an act was passed removing the restrictions against the sale of\r\nthe lands except homesteads of the adult members of the Five Civilized\r\nTribes not of Indian blood, which included mainly freedmen citizens of\r\nthe tribes and affected 1,500,000 acres of land.\r\n\r\n“In the next month, May, 1904, President Roosevelt commissioned Mr. M.\r\nL. Mott of North Carolina to act as National Attorney for the Creek\r\nTribe of Indians. This appointment was important to the Indians of the\r\nFive Civilized Tribes, for Mr. Mott took a deep interest in their\r\ncondition and became a forceful advocate for them; he was instrumental\r\nin impressing enactments upon the Federal statutes and securing from the\r\nSupreme Court constructions of the statutes that are essential to the\r\nIndians’ welfare and that will secure to them their property rights for\r\nmany years beyond the time allotted by local consent.\r\n\r\n“Soon after Mr. Mott assumed his duties he observed that a large part of\r\nthe land made salable by the Act of April 21, 1904, almost immediately\r\nhad passed into the hands of white people and the grossly inadequate\r\nconsideration received by the allottees had been wasted. This was food\r\nfor serious thought.\r\n\r\n“In response to a popular demand Congress had removed the restriction\r\nagainst sale three years before the land was to become alienable\r\naccording to the agreements under which it was allotted. The land and\r\nmoney had been frittered away. Under the law, all restrictions on the\r\nsale of all lands of full-bloods and mixed-bloods, except homesteads, of\r\nthe Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws were to expire by\r\nlimitation within three or four years. In the light of the experience\r\nunder the Act of April 21, 1904, it was not difficult to foretell what\r\nwould happen when these restrictions expired under the impending\r\nstatehood regime.\r\n\r\n“To avert the calamity threatening the Indians, Mr. Mott bent all of his\r\nenergies to securing an amendment of the law, extending the restrictions\r\nagainst the sale of all Indians’ land. In the face of strong opposition\r\nhe failed to secure an extension as to mixed-bloods, but Congress was\r\nprevailed upon to pass a measure extending until 1931 the restrictions\r\nagainst the sale of all lands of full-blood Indians except under the\r\nsupervision of the Secretary of the Interior. This was part of an act of\r\nApril 26, 1906, entitled ‘An Act for the final disposition of the\r\naffairs of the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian Territory, and for\r\nother purposes,’ which was framed to adjust conditions for the\r\ninauguration of the new State of Oklahoma, then practically assured.\r\n\r\n“The section of the Act extending restrictions was known as the McCumber\r\namendment. In urging its passage Senator McCumber read to the Senate an\r\nargument by Mr. Mott in which he made the statement that within thirty\r\ndays after the Act of April 21, 1904, became effective, not ten per cent\r\nof the land made salable by that act remained in the hands of the\r\nallottees, and within sixty days not ten per cent of the allottees who\r\nhad sold possessed a dollar to show for the heritage so improvidently\r\ndisposed of. Senator McCumber and Senator Teller expressed doubt of the\r\nconstitutionality of the amendment, but impressed by the necessities of\r\nthe situation solved the doubt in favor of the Indians by voting for its\r\nenactment. The wisdom of this measure was vindicated and its\r\nconstitutionality was established by the United States Supreme Court on\r\nMay 15, 1911, in the Marchie Tiger case, reported in 221 U. S. Supreme\r\nCourt Reports, page 738.\r\n\r\n“This suit grew out of the fact that after August 8, 1907, conveyances\r\nwere taken from full-blood Creek Indians on the theory that the McCumber\r\namendment could not prevent it, in that Congress had not the power and\r\nhad not intended to extend the restrictions to land so purchased. On the\r\nadvice of Mr. Mott the Council of the Creek Nation made an appropriation\r\nfor the purpose of testing this contention and authorized the employment\r\nof Mr. W. L. Sturdevant of St. Louis, who was retained by Mr. Mott, with\r\nthe concurrence of the Interior Department, to aid in establishing in\r\nthe courts the binding force of the McCumber amendment.\r\n\r\n“The Oklahoma trial court held against the contention of the Indians and\r\nthe Supreme Court of Oklahoma said that as the lands involved in the\r\nTiger case were inherited, Congress did not intend to restrict the sale\r\nof them, and that therefore the constitutionality of the Act was not\r\ndrawn in question; but the attorneys were convinced that the local\r\ncourts did not see this Indian question in the light with which grave\r\nconsiderations of public policy and conscience illuminated it before the\r\nnation, and they appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court.\r\nThis court reversed the holding of the Oklahoma courts and established\r\nthe force and effectiveness of the McCumber amendment, for the\r\nmuch-needed protection of the 40,000 full-blood Indians of the Five\r\nCivilized Tribes as to all their lands; the court said that it rests\r\nwith Congress to say when its guardianship of the Indians shall cease\r\nand that it had not surrendered this right by creating the State of\r\nOklahoma. This decision established the power of Congress in the future\r\nto impose such additional safeguards for the protection of the Indians\r\nin Oklahoma as their necessities may require. On the strength of the\r\nprinciple established in this case, the Government in behalf of the\r\nIndians brought suits involving 30,000 causes of action against white\r\npeople who had taken deeds from Indians who were restricted under the\r\nMcCumber amendment, the most of which are now settled favorably to the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n“Oklahoma with 1,500,000 population, became a State on November 16,\r\n1907, upon a pledge contained in her constitution that she would never\r\nquestion the jurisdiction of the Federal Government over the Indians and\r\ntheir lands or its power to legislate by law or regulation concerning\r\ntheir rights or property. Immediately she had a delegation in Congress\r\nand at once began a determined campaign for further repeal of the laws\r\nenacted for the protection of the Indians. The main argument employed\r\nwas that the Indians were competent to care for their property and\r\nneeded no legislative protection against improvidence; that the State\r\ncould be trusted to afford them all the protection they required and\r\nthat Federal guardianship and supervision should cease, as an\r\ninterference with the personal privileges and rights of citizens of\r\nOklahoma. And they made much of the fact that among the mixed-bloods\r\nthere are a few individuals who are quite shrewd enough to look out for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“This fight was highly successful to the white contenders and resulted\r\nin the enactment of a law on May 27, 1908, executive July 27, 1908,\r\nrepealing the restrictions on the sale of a large class of land\r\nincluding all homesteads of freedmen and of mixed-bloods of less than\r\nhalf blood, freeing from restrictions all told, over 9,720,000 acres. It\r\nprovided also that all homesteads, as well as all other lands from which\r\nrestrictions against sale were removed, should become taxable the same\r\nas lands of white people, whether sold by the allottee or not. This late\r\nact violated the terms of the agreements made with the Indians under\r\nwhich the homesteads of the Creeks and the allotments, or parts thereof,\r\nof the Choctaw and other tribes were exempted from taxation for a given\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _by Rodman Wanamaker 1913_ _Chief Plenty Coups_]\r\n\r\n“While this measure was being opposed before the House Committee on\r\nIndian Affairs, in illustrating the disastrous policy toward the Indians\r\nthat Congress was entering upon, Mr. Mott referred to the 8th day of\r\nAugust, 1907, when restrictions automatically expired on all lands in\r\nthe Creek Nation, except homesteads, of all allottees of less than full\r\nblood. He stated that by one o’clock of the morning of the 8th day of\r\nAugust, deeds conveying one-half of the lands of the Creek Nation so\r\naffected were executed and delivered to well-organized land buyers, in\r\nmany cases for inadequate considerations, and that these considerations\r\nwere frittered away in a few weeks. This statement was not controverted.\r\n\r\n“The part of this Act which undertook to subject to taxation the\r\nhomesteads and other lands of the Indians was regarded as destructive of\r\ntheir property rights. The Indians had agreed to the allotment of their\r\nlands upon the condition contained in their treaties that certain\r\nexemptions from taxation should be observed. The Choctaw and Chickasaw\r\nlands were to be exempt while owned by the allottees. It was provided\r\nthat in the Creek, Cherokee and Seminole tribes, a homestead of forty\r\nacres should be reserved from each allotment, which should be\r\nnon-taxable for twenty-one years. This arrangement was favored by the\r\nGovernment as a wise policy of equalizing to the Indians the handicap\r\nunder which they were about to enter upon a new method of living. It was\r\nseen that the destruction of this safeguard would bring disaster to the\r\nIndians as it would introduce a most insidious agency for divesting the\r\nIndians of their land under the power to sell for delinquent taxes; and\r\nit was realized that withdrawing the exemption was the arbitrary taking\r\nof property without due process of law, which the courts should be asked\r\nto prevent.\r\n\r\n“These considerations were presented to the Creek Council by their\r\nattorney soon after the passage of the Act and upon his advice they\r\nagain took an advanced position and decided to test the power of\r\nCongress to take away from them the right of tax exemption. A resolution\r\nto that effect was passed by the Creek Council in October, 1908, but it\r\nneeded the approval of the President of the United States to make it\r\neffective. And here arose a peculiar situation.\r\n\r\n“When Mr. Mott presented the resolution to Mr. Garfield, the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, and the President, they stated that they had approved\r\nand the President had signed the bill removing restrictions and making\r\nthe unrestricted homesteads taxable. It was represented to the latter in\r\nreply that the Indians believed they were wronged by the Act, and that\r\nif the President refused to aid them in getting into court to have their\r\nrights measured and determined, the Indians would feel that the\r\nGovernment was not acting in good faith toward them and was afraid to\r\nhave its actions inquired into by the courts. President Roosevelt\r\nadmitted the force of their position and approved the resolution.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sturdevant again was retained to present this question to the\r\ncourts, together with a similar question arising in the Choctaw Nation,\r\nthe question being common to all the tribes. As in the Marchie Tiger\r\nrestriction case the Oklahoma trial and Supreme courts held against the\r\ncontention of the Indians. They decided that the Indians must pay taxes\r\non homesteads as well as on all other land from which restrictions\r\nagainst sale were removed. Mr. Sturdevant, confident of his position,\r\nappealed to the United States Supreme Court and argued the novel\r\nquestion to an interested bench which handed down an opinion on May 13,\r\n1912, reversing the courts below. It held that the Indians’ exemption\r\nfrom taxation was a property right that had become vested in exchange\r\nfor a valuable consideration, to wit, the consent of each allottee to\r\ntake his portion of land and yield any claim to all other tribal\r\nproperty, and that Congress had no more power to destroy, impair or\r\nwithdraw that exemption than it had to take the land itself.\r\n\r\n“In the opinion the Supreme Court stated a rule by which the rights of\r\nIndians should always be measured, whether in the courts or in Congress.\r\nIt was said that ‘_the construction_ (of statutes) _instead of being\r\nstrict, is liberal; doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in\r\nfavor of the United States, are to be resolved in favor of a weak and\r\ndefenseless people, who are wards of the nation, and dependent wholly\r\nupon its protection and good faith._’\r\n\r\n“Thus was settled a question of far-reaching importance to the Indians\r\nand particularly to those who have not sold their homesteads. Congress\r\ncannot take away from the Indians this right established by the Supreme\r\nCourt. But Congress can repeal all the restrictions on the sale of all\r\nIndians’ land and expose them to their own ignorance and improvidence;\r\nif the present tendency continues, this backward movement will be\r\ncompletely consummated in a few years, and at present there is nothing\r\nin sight to indicate a change of policy.\r\n\r\n“In a recent primary campaign in Oklahoma there were sixty candidates\r\nfor Congress of both parties, from whom eight members were to be\r\nselected. Nearly all of these aspirants for seats in Congress solicited\r\nsupport on the promise that if elected they would work for the removal\r\nof all restrictions on the sale of all Indian land of the Five Civilized\r\nTribes in Oklahoma, and for the ‘emancipation of eastern Oklahoma from\r\nFederal supervision.’ And they were all in earnest for they knew that to\r\nbe elected they must favor that policy, and the sentiment that sent the\r\nwinners to Congress would exact a strict compliance with that agreement.\r\n\r\n“It has been said by members of the Oklahoma delegation in Congress that\r\nthe Indian question is a local question with which the rest of the\r\ncountry has no concern, and that the people of Oklahoma should be\r\npermitted to work out their own policy toward the Indian and solve the\r\nquestion in their own way.\r\n\r\n“To a limited extent only is this true. The Indian question is a\r\nNational problem which we assumed when we as a nation appropriated their\r\nland, took them under our protection and arrogated the right to control\r\ntheir destinies. We made definite promises to them and mutual agreements\r\nwith them, in reliance upon which they consented to changes in their\r\nforms of living which the exigencies of our rapidly growing nation\r\ndemanded. If in the next six or eight years these 40,000 full-bloods and\r\nmore than 60,000 mixed-bloods and freedmen shall have frittered away\r\ntheir great estate and half of them are paupers, it will not be a State\r\nquestion merely—it will be a National scandal.\r\n\r\n“A prophet need not draw deeply for inspiration to see in 1919 the\r\nOklahoma delegation rising in Congress and demanding of the\r\nGovernment:—‘What of your stewardship of these Indians, these children\r\nof nature, whose vast property they entrusted to your protection?\r\nFifteen years ago they owned in fee simple—by the same title that we own\r\nour homes—an estate which today is worth a thousand million dollars, and\r\none-half of them are paupers. Look upon your work for just one\r\ngeneration. Their property was hedged about by every conceivable\r\nlegislative protection. Treaty after treaty and statute after statute\r\nwere enacted to secure the Indian against his own improvidence and\r\nhelplessness by you, the Government, the only power in the world which\r\ncould protect or despoil him at will. Then you began only a little while\r\nago to tear down this protection and to expose him to perils with which\r\nhe was inexperienced. You withdrew a little protection here, you tore\r\ndown something there, time after time, and by your own deliberate acts\r\nthe Indian was invited to pauperize himself until today he is a wanderer\r\nupon the earth. Did your previous one hundred years of experience with\r\nthe Indians teach you nothing, that you might avoid rewriting some of\r\nthe miserable chapters of history we have been trying to forget?\r\n\r\n“‘He who in 1904 was the independent owner of broad acres of hill and\r\nvalley, of billowing prairie, timbered mountain side and shady streams,\r\nhas not land enough on which to erect a shelter against the storm, nor\r\nmoney to build it. His land is making thousands of fortunes annually and\r\nsupporting millions of thrifty white people who know nothing of the\r\nIndian’s sacrifice and care less.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHEROKEE MALE ACADEMY NEAR TALEQUAH, OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n  Burned a few years ago. The contrast between this dignified structure,\r\n    and the glaring, modern school buildings has caused much comment.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“It seems clear that further removal of restrictions should be\r\ndiscouraged. Under the present law any land of the Five Civilized Tribes\r\nother than homesteads may be sold under the watchful eye of the\r\nSecretary of the Interior. There should be no objection to this method.\r\nTrue, before the Secretary will authorize a sale he investigates the\r\nproposed transaction and he must be satisfied that the Indian wants to\r\nsell, that he understands the deal, that the consideration offered is\r\nadequate and that it is actually paid to the Indian, or to the\r\nDepartment, for him—in other words, that the Indian is not defrauded.\r\n\r\n“To say in the face of the experience of the past eight years that this\r\nsupervision of the Indian is an unwarranted, unreasonable interference\r\nwith the rights of citizens of a sovereign State, is the shallowest\r\nsophistry. Under the wise policy of the Interior Department the\r\nconsideration paid for lands of a restricted Indian is received by the\r\nDepartment and expended in the construction of improvements on his\r\nhomestead and for farm implements, livestock and other necessities of\r\nlife. Or the money is turned over to the Indian in small instalments,\r\nthe exact course to be pursued in each case being determined by an\r\ninvestigation of the Indian’s capacity and needs. In this way his money\r\nis not foolishly spent and he is not cheated by unscrupulous white men\r\nwho too often take advantage of the Indian’s ignorance and improvidence.\r\nCertainly this cannot be objected to by the good people of Oklahoma who\r\nhave no desire to see the Indian plundered.\r\n\r\n“The decisions of the Supreme Court have established the right of\r\nCongress to pass all needful laws for the protection of these Indians\r\nand to impose necessary supervision of their affairs, and have hereby\r\nclearly shown that Congress alone is responsible for the fate of these\r\nfriendless people. The objective point of assault will be the next\r\nCongress. Will it be able to resist the pressure that will be brought to\r\ntear down the pitiful remnant of protection that remains to these wards\r\nof our country? The attitude of the Supreme Court and the Interior\r\nDepartment has placed the whole Nation under obligation to them, for\r\nthey have saved us as a people from standing pilloried before mankind as\r\nentirely faithless to our fair promises made to a weaker people. If\r\ntheir illustrious example shall awaken the legislative conscience, the\r\nIndians who are yet restricted need not view with despair the convening\r\nof another Congress. But if the present tendency is not arrested, within\r\nfive years these Indians will be stripped of every measure of protection\r\nagainst their own incompetency. Our wards who less than ten years ago\r\nwere in the full enjoyment of all their property rights will have\r\nexperienced a swift impoverishment without parallel in our history.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Report Commissioner Indian Affairs, 1913.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Indians of the Territory legislating wisely.

CAPTAIN GRAYSON’S VIEWS; MISS BARNARD’S WORK; THE MINORS’\r\n                                ESTATES\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain G. W. Grayson of Eufaula, who has served many years as official\r\ninterpreter to the Creeks, and who is frequently employed by the\r\nSmithsonian savants in their studies of Indians, read my Oklahoma\r\nmanuscript and commented as follows:—\r\n\r\n“It is proper to state that in the Creek Nation, excluding negroes, some\r\ndegree of protection and supervision should be extended over two-thirds\r\nof the people. Some time since, the inquiry was propounded to Mr. Kelsey\r\nas to why the Government officials found it necessary to withhold from\r\nthe allottee the proceeds of the sale of lands in which he is\r\ninterested, paying it out in small amounts from time to time to him as\r\nhis need required. He promptly replied that the experience of the office\r\nhad very decidedly indicated this to be the humane thing to do. That\r\nthere were many instances where a full-blood Indian was paid a\r\nconsiderable sum of royalty money accruing from oil wells on his lands,\r\nwho was taken in charge by bad white men as soon as he left the office,\r\nwho immediately conducted him to some convenient brothel where drink is\r\none of the allurements, and rob him of every penny of the money paid to\r\nhim. This happens usually during the night following the payment, when\r\non the morning after the robbery, appears the Indian pleading to be\r\nagain paid at least sufficient to pay his railroad fare so he can get\r\nout of town. To this officer of the Government, it appeared very clear\r\nthat it was the duty of the Agents of the Department who, in a large\r\nsense, had assumed the guardianship of these Indians, to adopt such\r\nprecautions as would prevent a recurrence of like enormities.\r\n\r\n“Another method adopted, and in many cases practiced, is that of\r\nallowing the visiting payee only sufficient money to purchase his\r\nimmediate necessities while in the city, advising him to call at the\r\npostoffice in his home town, where the rest of his money due him is sent\r\nto him in the form of a check.\r\n\r\n“The theory on which such action is based is, that the Indian receiving\r\nhis money at his home, where he is free from the influence of\r\nintoxicants and bad white men, he can wisely advise his wife as to what\r\nuse to which this money may be appropriated, and in these cool and sober\r\nmoments, plan and adopt ways of disbursement that will actually benefit\r\nthe family.”\r\n\r\nOn May 17th, 1912, the Chairman of the Board of Indian Commissioners,\r\nHonorable George Vaux, Jr., visited Oklahoma and spent some time\r\ntraveling through the Cherokee, Creek and Seminole countries. He was\r\naccompanied by Dana H. Kelsey, Esq., Superintendent of the Union Indian\r\nAgency, having in charge the Five Civilized Tribes. Mr. Vaux’s findings\r\nwere published in the 43rd Annual Report of the Board, 1912.\r\n\r\nDesiring to study the Oklahoma situation in its broader aspects, I\r\nvisited Oklahoma in March, 1913, in company with J. Weston Allen, Esq.,\r\nwho represented the Boston Indian Citizenship Committee and other\r\norganizations. We spent considerable time not only in consultation with\r\nvarious Government officials and private citizens, but also in driving\r\nover the Creek, Seminole and Cherokee countries.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen remained after I returned East, and drove many miles through\r\nthe region inhabited by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians, and made a\r\nreport to me on the situation as he found it.\r\n\r\nBoth of us took numerous photographs showing the actual conditions under\r\nwhich the Indians are living.\r\n\r\nI made a report on conditions and submitted recommendations to our\r\nChairman, Mr. Vaux, and to the Honorable Secretary of the Interior. This\r\nreport was criticised in Congress by Honorable Mr. Stephens,\r\nRepresentative from Texas. Apparently Mr. Stephens did not read the\r\nreport. He stated in his speech of July 27th, during discussion of the\r\nIndian appropriation bill:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Moorehead, the Commissioner mentioned by the gentleman from\r\nIllinois (Mr. Graham) a few moments ago, went to Oklahoma last year and\r\nby unjust criticism of Indian officials there stirred up more trouble\r\nfor the Indian Bureau than has ever before occurred in the settlement of\r\nthe matters of the Five Tribes.”\r\n\r\nMr. Stephens desired to see the Board of Indian Commissioners abolished.\r\nSpeaking for myself personally, and not for the Board, I desire to say\r\nthat a few years ago it was stated that the Board was not active.\r\nImmediately the Board extended its work and projected a number of\r\nimportant investigations, which were carried to a successful end. In the\r\nlast Congress the Board was criticised for being too active, especially\r\nin Oklahoma. Friends of the Board rallied to its support and the former\r\nappropriation of $4,000 was raised to the present amount of $10,000.\r\n\r\nThe past two years studies of Indian conditions by members of the Board\r\nhave been carried on in Wisconsin, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona.\r\nThis winter the Board intends to investigate conditions on the Pacific\r\nCoast, in the Northwest, Oklahoma, Montana and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Mr. Stephens’ two speeches, I wrote to him and pointed out\r\nwherein he was in error. No answer has been received to these letters.\r\nCareful reading of my report will convince any unprejudiced person of\r\nthis fact—that instead of criticising the Indian Office officials in\r\nOklahoma, I commended them. The only criticisms were those aimed at the\r\ngrafters, and in nearly fifty instances I gave names of guardians or\r\nadministrators, who had swindled Indians, giving details gleaned from\r\ncourt records. The report urged the Congressional delegation from\r\nOklahoma to take a firm stand in behalf of the Indians.\r\n\r\nMuch injury is done to the cause for which we are all striving by such\r\nspeeches as the one cited above. In closing my comments on this\r\nunfortunate matter, I desire to state that friendly relations exist\r\nbetween myself and all the Government officials, and that without\r\nexception, everyone of them has furnished, or offered, information for\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate Barnard last winter began a radical campaign on behalf of the\r\nOklahoma Indians. I am sorry space does not permit the recital of Miss\r\nBarnard’s dramatic story. It seems that for years she was in charge of\r\nthe Department of Charities and Corrections, for the State. She found in\r\nthe orphans’ homes and poorhouses, large numbers of small children,\r\nchiefly Indians. Investigation proved that these children were once\r\npossessed of valuable property, out of which guardians had swindled\r\nthem. After the robbery became complete, the guardians avoided personal\r\nresponsibility by persuading judges to declare the children homeless\r\npaupers; and placed them in State institutions, where they were\r\nsupported at public expense. The number of children declared paupers\r\nmounted into the thousands. The thing became a national scandal, and\r\nMiss Barnard soon found herself involved in a fight with the politicians\r\nand grafters who profited by these wholesale swindles. Miss Barnard’s\r\nofficial reports for the years 1909 to 1913 describe many of these cases\r\nin heart-rending detail. The appropriations for her department were\r\nwholly inadequate to care for more than a fraction of the State wards,\r\nand she was compelled to cooperate with the Federal authorities. This\r\nbrought her department in line with Mr. Mott, Mr. Kelsey and others who\r\nwere fighting to bring about similar reforms.\r\n\r\nNaturally, she aroused powerful opposition in her own State. The cry of\r\n“Eastern sentimentalism” could not be raised against her, she being a\r\nState employee. Her campaign seriously affected oil, land and other\r\ninterests. Hence, the Legislature cut off her appropriation, allowing\r\nher salary, but no funds for publication, employment of assistants,\r\ntravel or other necessary items, whereupon Miss Barnard visited Chicago\r\nand raised some thousands of dollars with which to wage a campaign of\r\neducation. She has organized eleven counties, and although hampered in\r\nevery way by the grafters, speaks to large gatherings throughout the\r\nState. At one meeting 8000 persons assembled to hear her.\r\n\r\nShe delivered a stirring address at the Lake Mohonk Conference October\r\n21st, this year, and through her efforts the Conference introduced a\r\nplank in its platform to the effect that if Oklahoma failed to properly\r\nprotect her restricted Indians, the Federal Government should resume\r\njurisdiction over them.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate Barnard is justly called the “Joan of Arc of Oklahoma”.\r\n\r\nOf slight figure—even frail—she is possessed of lion’s courage and is a\r\nmost direct, forceful and dramatic speaker. I asked her able assistant\r\nand attorney, Mr. Huson, “Where are all these big men of the West, the\r\nfellows of the big and courageous hearts, the men we read so much about?\r\nWhy are they not supporting this woman in her heroic fight?”\r\n\r\nHe replied: “Oh, they have hearts, all right, when it comes to other\r\nmatters. But so long as they can make millions out of the Indians, it’s\r\nno use to talk the humanities to them. They all follow David Harum’s\r\ngolden rule.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated July 23, 1912, Mr. H. Huson, Assistant Commissioner of\r\nthe State Department of Charities and Corrections, which was presented\r\nto Congress by President Taft in his veto of the bill attempting to\r\nvalidate inherited land titles, it was also said:\r\n\r\n“Armed with this authority Miss Barnard has intervened in behalf of\r\napproximately 3,000 orphans, nearly all of these Indian children whose\r\nestates were being exploited or disposed of by incompetent or grafting\r\nguardians. We have had many guardians removed, and we have saved for\r\nthese children since this law became operative something like $100,000\r\nin money and prevented the sale or return of something like 115,000\r\nacres of land.”\r\n\r\nYet in spite of her good work she is now compelled to fight for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Office decided to take a hand in the struggle, and Honorable\r\nCato Sells, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, visited Oklahoma early this\r\nyear, brought together all the probate judges and other officials and\r\nmade a plea for cooperation in the prevention of further despoiling of\r\nthe Indian. A set of rules, or method of procedure, was adopted, and the\r\nprobate judges of Oklahoma have agreed to follow them. Everyone hopes\r\nMr. Sells’ plan will work to the advantage of the minors and dependents.\r\n\r\nOf the thousands of cases where minors and incompetents were swindled\r\nout of property, I present but three or four typical of the larger\r\nnumber. These are from official records.\r\n\r\nOne man was guardian in thirty-one cases involving more than fifty\r\nminors. In all but one case this man as guardian had been dealing with\r\nhis brothers in the purchase of merchandise for his wards. There is but\r\none exception, that of a minor eighteen years old who was away at\r\nschool. A Government officer on behalf of these minors protested against\r\nsuch practice and asked to file exceptions and proceed in all of these\r\ncases. I am informed that the judge did nothing.\r\n\r\nA guardian had a ward, Sam Bighead, a full-blood Indian boy five years\r\nof age, who owned 560 acres of valuable land, much of which produced\r\noil. Eighty acres of this land was sold for the sum of $10,000.00 cash.\r\nAlthough this boy owned 480 acres of land and $10,000.00 cash, he was\r\nplaced in the Creek Orphan Asylum where he died May 18, 1910. This boy,\r\nentitled to proper care and treatment, was placed with the children of\r\npaupers. Why the guardian wished to have on hand such a large sum of\r\ncash, all of which was unnecessary for the maintenance of the ward,\r\nsince the ward was a public charge, passes comprehension.\r\n\r\nWhen the poor boy died, there was left of this $10,000.00, $2,884.30 in\r\ncash, and a $5,000.00 loan on first mortgage.\r\n\r\nDeath did not stay the actions of the guardian; he became appointed\r\nadministrator. As administrator he accounted for $11,424.30. He reported\r\nthat $6,074.96 was the balance on hand of the estate. Of this sum\r\n$5,627.00 was divided into four equal parts for four heirs. However, the\r\nGovernment special agent Farrar contends that in three of these cases\r\nattorney fees of 25% each were charged. So finally, out of the estate of\r\n$11,424.00, $4,405.85 was placed in the hands of the heirs. How can some\r\nOklahoma citizens clamor for withdrawal of Government supervision after\r\nreading this story?\r\n\r\nA man named Jerry Bunce was guardian of an Indian boy (Choctaw) named\r\nTonihka. Some of the inherited land of the boy had been sold by the\r\nguardian through the probate court, and there were in the possession of\r\nthe guardian funds belonging to his ward amounting to $1100. The\r\nguardian bought a cow and calf for the ward; the boy slipped the calf\r\naway and sold it and with the proceeds bought him some clothes. The\r\nguardian employed an attorney and had the boy arrested charging him with\r\nlarceny of the calf. Other attorneys were employed to defend the boy.\r\nThe guardian paid the attorneys on both sides of the case $900 of the\r\nboy’s money—one side for prosecuting and the other side for an alleged\r\ndefense; when the case came up for trial the attorney defending plead\r\nguilty for the boy, who was convicted without a word of evidence, and\r\nsent to the reform school. Bunce died, and his successor as guardian\r\ntold my informant the above facts, and said that when he talked with the\r\nattorneys involved they treated the matter as a great joke.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 a full-blood Choctaw Indian named Simon Wakaya was found dead\r\nand charred in the ashes of his cabin. An investigation showed that he\r\nhad been shot before the cabin was burned. This Indian had dealt in\r\ncattle and owned a small herd of stock in addition to his allotment. Two\r\nor three days after the death, there was filed in the county offices a\r\nbill of sale conveying all of his cattle to a man named Bill ——.[26] At\r\nthe same time there was filed for probate in the county court, a will\r\npurporting to have been executed by Wakaya conveying his allotment to\r\nHenry ——.[26] A Government representative satisfied himself that the\r\nwill was a forgery and induced a relative to contest the will. After a\r\npreliminary hearing occurred in the county court, the matter was\r\nappealed to the district court and full disclosure of all the facts was\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe judge issued a bench warrant, charging them all with murder,\r\nperjury, forgery and arson. These men gave bond at the time and for two\r\nyears they have been at liberty and have never been brought to trial.\r\nThis last remark merely illustrates the apathy of the white people of\r\nthis State in matters involving the welfare of the Indians. It is a fact\r\ndemonstrated a hundred times a day in this State that the white\r\npopulation cares very little about the rights of the Indians and it is\r\ndifficult to secure a conviction of white people for many felonies\r\ncommitted upon Indians. This is most frequently illustrated in the\r\nmatter of forgeries in the securing of pretended deeds from unrestricted\r\nIndians. Upon failure to secure a deed the white man is not yet at the\r\nend of his resources, for he can still either forge a deed or get some\r\nIndian or freedman to impersonate the owner of the land and execute a\r\nconveyance, acknowledge it before a notary and have it recorded.\r\n\r\nA full-blood Cherokee, now about twenty-six, was allotted valuable land\r\nin the vicinity of Bartlesville. She had no relatives, and at the age of\r\nfour years she was taken into the family of a white man, but not\r\nformally adopted. When the allotments were made he was appointed her\r\nguardian. When she became of age he was discharged. During his\r\nguardianship about $4500.00 came into the guardian’s hands as guardian.\r\nUpon a final accounting he filed receipts for over $2,000 as having been\r\npaid to his ward, but which it is claimed he admitted really never was\r\npaid to her.\r\n\r\nWhen this girl became of age a new oil lease was made with her for which\r\na bonus of $8,000 was paid, which money went into the hands of the\r\nguardian and which it is alleged he likewise admitted he diverted to his\r\nown use. It is also claimed that approximately $2500 royalty has been\r\nreceived by the guardian for this girl. It is claimed that the guardian\r\nhas admitted that he owed this girl approximately $20,000. The ward\r\nlived in the home of her guardian ostensibly as a servant. She is of\r\nweak mind and really an incompetent. In September, 1910, the guardian\r\nsecured a divorce from his wife, and afterwards, it is claimed,\r\ncontinued to live with his ward.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the extremes to which these grafters sometimes\r\nresort, my attention was called to a case of an adult who had died and\r\nleft a valuable property. In order to get large allowances from the\r\nestate padded expense accounts were put in for the burial robes,\r\nmetallic caskets, etc., although the relatives who attended the burial\r\nstoutly insisted that only a box, and the cheapest clothes were used. In\r\nthis instance, the grafters, knowing that an investigation was to be\r\nmade, exhumed the body and placed same in a metallic casket, and carried\r\noff and destroyed the pine box in which the burial had originally been\r\nmade!\r\n\r\nMiss Barnard found a pauper child in an almshouse. Investigation proved\r\nthat the guardian disposed of a valuable “oil allotment” for $50,000.\r\nInstead of using a part of this money for the child’s education, he\r\nappropriated it to his own use. A portion of the money was recovered and\r\nthe child placed in an educational institution.\r\n\r\nIndians about to become of age possessing valuable allotments, were\r\ntaken to remote points—Denver, Minneapolis, etc. Henry Purchase was\r\ntaken to St. Louis, and detained until he signed a deed to his property.\r\nMarcus Corey was found by Secret Service men in Southampton, England,\r\nand returned after much trouble to his parents. Marcus possessed\r\nproperty worth $40,000.\r\n\r\nCases are on record where Indians were poisoned, or confined in rooms in\r\nobscure hotels, until they signed away their property. The ignorant were\r\neasy prey to the grafters, as this newspaper clipping of 1913 attests:\r\n\r\n  Oklahoma City, June 25.—In an opinion handed down today by Associate\r\n  Justice Jesse Dunn, of the supreme court that body holds that two\r\n  Mississippi Choctaw Indian girls who were so ignorant that they\r\n  would have sold their allotments on which were valuable asphalt\r\n  deposits and which are worth $40,000 for $850 came under the\r\n  statutory terms of mentally incompetent persons and that the county\r\n  court of Marshall County should appoint a guardian for them. The\r\n  girls admitted that they could neither read nor write, did not know\r\n  when their mother died or how many $5 bills it would take to make a\r\n  hundred.\r\n\r\nIn most States guardian and administrator fees range from as low as 2%\r\nto as high as 5% or 6%. In Oklahoma, the administrators and guardians\r\ncharged from 3% to as high as 80% for service and costs in settling up\r\nthe affairs of these defenseless people. I present a random page from\r\nMr. Mott’s long report. This was included by the Honorable Mr. Burke in\r\nhis speech.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SHACK OF A POOR CREEK INDIAN, OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n  Photographed in 1913\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn defending such charges, one gentleman claimed that some of these\r\nestates consisted of small tracts, widely scattered. Therefore, the\r\ncharges must of necessity be high. This is true of very few cases,\r\nespecially since small tracts widely separated were rarely ever sought\r\nafter by the grafter guardians, who in some localities were\r\nopprobriously designated as _professional guardians_. The figures speak\r\nfor themselves, and should be considered by every thoughtful man and\r\nwoman in this country, as they tell a story of robbery unparalleled in\r\nAmerican history.\r\n\r\n  No. 626.

WHAT IS LEFT OF INDIAN PROPERTY IN OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have looked upon the dark side of Oklahoma Affairs, let us look on\r\nthe bright side for a moment. From last year’s report of J. George\r\nWright, Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes, it is learned that\r\nthere are 32,939 restricted Indians. These are still protected by the\r\nGovernment, and all own homesteads. Notwithstanding the thousands of\r\nIndians who have been swindled out of their property, or sold same at\r\nridiculously low prices, a great deal remains—sufficient to provide\r\nevery Indian of the tribes with a homestead and enough agricultural land\r\nto maintain himself and family, provided he is protected in his rights;\r\nall hinges upon that word _provided_.\r\n\r\nAs to the true value of this land, I shall not present the statistics,\r\nbut the entire 19,000,000 acres, held by Indians and Whites, because of\r\nthe great oilfields, coal and asphalt lands timber and farm lands, must\r\nbe worth at least $1,000,000,000. About half of this, or $500,000,000,\r\nit is claimed that the Indians still own, largely because of the\r\nrestrictions placed upon their property.\r\n\r\nMuch of this land is what is known as tribal land, and when sold the\r\namount is placed to the credit of the tribe. The tribal attorneys, the\r\nGovernment officials, and practically everyone believes that the lands\r\nshould be sold, and the money divided up among the Indians. The reasons\r\nfor this, I have briefly presented on page 28, when speaking of Indians\r\nin general. By this method, we will rid the Indians of an\r\never-increasing swarm of attorneys and remove all incentive to unwise\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nOf the number of Indians at work, the value of their crops and labor, no\r\nman may know. Estimates vary, but I suppose that it is no exaggeration\r\nto state that about a third of the males belonging to the Five Civilized\r\nTribes work—thousands of them regularly. The Government has encouraged\r\nthis through the District Agents, or field helpers, whose duty it is to\r\ninstruct the Indians in farming, to protect them in their rights and to\r\nexercise a general supervision over them. These field agents stood\r\nbetween the Indian and the grafter, and there was a determined effort on\r\nthe part of a few men to have the entire number dismissed from the\r\nService. However, Congress continued the appropriation and these worthy\r\nmen are assured of another year’s effort on behalf of the Indians.\r\n\r\nSome of the illustrations presented in these chapters are from\r\nphotographs taken by Mr. Allen and myself in Oklahoma and will give an\r\nidea of the homes of the Indians, and some of the farms they have\r\nbrought under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OLD-STYLE CABIN, 1850–1890\r\n\r\n  Cherokee, Oklahoma. Photographed, 1913\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe unallotted lands have usually been sold at auction and since\r\nNovember 1, 1910, 1,838,921 acres have been sold for $10,458,945, or an\r\naverage of $5.68 per acre. This seems rather low price, but as most of\r\nthe lands were not developed and many tracts had grown up to bushes, it\r\nis the best that could be obtained under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nOf immense value are the segregated coal and asphalt lands in Choctaw\r\nand Chickasaw nations. These total 455,303 acres. The value has been\r\nvariously estimated, and it is impossible to accurately or even\r\napproximately state the amount. Coal tracts, in the eastern part of the\r\nUnited States, have been known to sell as high as $1,000 an acre. The\r\nprice may vary from $50 for tracts wherein the veins are thin, to $500\r\nfor heavy vein of the best grades of bituminous coal. It will thus be\r\nseen that at the lowest estimate coal contained in this enormous area is\r\nof exceeding value, and this statement does not take into account the\r\ngreat asphalt deposit of undoubted value. Up to the present, the\r\nGovernment has successfully resisted attempts of those who would secure\r\ncontrol of this property. Commissioner Wright, on page 28 of his report,\r\nstates that there is in cash deposited to the credit of the Indians, in\r\nbanks in the State of Oklahoma, $4,474,189.45. The interest paid on this\r\nsum varies from 4% to 6%.\r\n\r\nSome of the coal and asphalt lands have been leased to mining companies\r\nand during the year ending June 30, 1913, 3,103,071 tons of coal and\r\n4,752 tons of asphalt were mined; the royalty on the coal being eight\r\ncents per ton and on crude asphalt ten cents, refined asphalt sixty\r\ncents per ton.\r\n\r\nThe tribal attorneys, acting for these Five Civilized Tribes, and\r\noccupying high positions of trust and responsibility, have, without\r\nexception, done what they could to further the interests of their\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Cherokee terminated June 30, 1914, and all tribal\r\noffices were abolished. Whether the Cherokees will prosper remains to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the totals presented, it must be recorded that\r\n$2,480,739.35 were distributed to individual Indians. This sum was\r\nreceived from oil royalties, lease privileges, mining royalties, rents,\r\nbonuses, etc.\r\n\r\nDana H. Kelsey, Superintendent of the Union Agency, and acting in\r\nconjunction with Commissioner Wright last year handled a grand total of\r\n$8,215,989.71. Some idea of the enormous amount of business transacted\r\nby his office may be gleaned from the statement that pieces of mail\r\nmatter (over half of which were letters) during the year totaled\r\n364,218. His office investigated about 18,000 leases, land cases,\r\ncomplaints and probate cases all relating to Indian property. The net\r\nsaving to the Indians by this governmental supervision was $667,352.25.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelsey states: “At the advent of statehood there were no ample\r\nfacilities to afford proper protection to the minor and incompetent\r\nIndians, the former of which number approximately 60,000.”\r\n\r\nSome of the difficulties with which his office has had to contend may be\r\nimagined from the following quotation:—\r\n\r\n“Many parties who sought to secure these lands either controlled the\r\nappointment of the guardian or connived with the guardian to purchase\r\nthe land at grossly inadequate prices, the difference between the\r\npurchase price and the actual price of the land being the profit\r\nrealized by the guardian and the purchaser. In other instances parents\r\nwho were appointed guardians of their children sold their children’s\r\nallotments and dissipated the proceeds. This work discloses many\r\ninstances where parties desiring to lease minor allotments secured the\r\nappointment of themselves or employees as guardian, and by so\r\ncontrolling the land sought they were able to profit to a considerable\r\nextent in subleasing lands for, in some instances, many times the amount\r\npaid. Many of these leases provided for the improvement of the land in\r\nlieu of cash rental, while none of the improvements were made. Many\r\ncomplaints lodged with the field clerks are from the unrestricted\r\nIndians, who, upon attaining their majority, find that their allotments\r\nhave been sold and the funds dissipated by the guardian, leaving them\r\npenniless.”\r\n\r\nI visited Mr. Kelsey’s office and spent a number of days there watching\r\nthe conduct of business. The tremendous activity in the oilfields, and\r\nthe thousands of applications for oil leases or purchase of Indian lands\r\npass, for the most part, through his hands and those of his able\r\nassistants. If it were not for his efforts and those of Commissioner\r\nWright, and the tribal attorneys (and not to omit Mr. Mott, Mr. Foreman\r\nand Miss Barnard), in other words, if there had not appeared before\r\nthose who sought to despoil the Indians this “stone wall defense”, there\r\nwould be little to record today beyond the fact that the Five Civilized\r\nTribes at one time possessed a great deal of property.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelsey served over ten years as Superintendent of the Union Agency\r\nand is thoroughly familiar with conditions in Oklahoma. His\r\nrecommendations, therefore, should carry weight. They are found on page\r\n93 of his report.\r\n\r\n“1. Continued and more practical care of the health and property of the\r\nolder, uneducated, full-blood Indian, and the disposition, under proper\r\nsupervision, of his excess land holdings.\r\n\r\n“2. The immediate placing of all mature, able-bodied Indians entirely\r\nupon their own resources when shown that they have had sufficient\r\nexperience or education to enable them to earn a livelihood.\r\n\r\n“3. Systematic and compulsory education of every Indian child, and\r\nconservation of his property in the meantime.”\r\n\r\nHe emphasizes the education of Indian children for the reason that back\r\nin the hills in Oklahoma there are several thousand children not\r\nofficially recognized as members of the tribes, for the reason that they\r\nhave been born since the rolls were closed. As no provision is made for\r\nthe education of these, he properly claims that these children\r\nconstitute one of the great problems in Oklahoma. He also states that\r\nmost of the adult Indians have remaining more or less property or money.\r\nI would add to his recommendations that this property and money must be\r\nwisely safeguarded else the Indians will become paupers. Already a few\r\nof them are living on the section lines, along the county roads. And\r\nthis number will increase rapidly, unless we make the citizenship real\r\nand effective.\r\n\r\nThe office held by Mr. Wright now being consolidated with that of Mr.\r\nKelsey, he acts as Supervisor. I wrote him a long letter concerning the\r\nOklahoma situation, and a portion of his reply should be included in\r\nthis book:—\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“So far as the consolidation of the two offices is concerned, I rather\r\nfeel that you were unduly anxious over its effect. I have had the\r\nresponsibility of the entire work now for nearly two months, and am more\r\nthan ever convinced that the time was ripe for it and it was good\r\nadministration to have it all under one head, provided that head is the\r\nright sort of a man, and that there will be no ill effects therefrom. It\r\nwas bound to come, and had better come while there was somebody here who\r\nknew how to do it than later. I am having such fun getting it working\r\nsmoothly that it will soon be only an incident. I am happy to say that\r\nthe good work to protect the Indians goes on I think better now than\r\never. We are getting excellent results from the new probate attorney\r\norganization, in cooperation with our former field force (which is still\r\nintact), and not only preventing new abuses, but, as time permits,\r\ndelving into and correcting many old and rotten ones affecting minors,\r\nand I think the cooperation of the probate courts—especially since the\r\nearnest entrance into the thing by the Commissioner personally—is a\r\nhundred per cent better than it was before, all of which I helped plan,\r\nand with which I feel I have had much to do.\r\n\r\n“Muskogee, Oct. 23rd, 1914.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll of the above is very encouraging, and I hope the consolidation and\r\nthe probate attorneys will work together for the result we all desire.\r\n\r\nIt would not be proper to close the Oklahoma affair without saying a few\r\nwords concerning Mr. Mott and Captain Grayson.\r\n\r\nCaptain George W. Grayson has served as official Creek interpreter for\r\nmany years. He understands the history of his tribe, is entirely in\r\nsympathy with their aims, and has done much to aid the various tribal\r\nattorneys in Oklahoma. With a fine Indian, Moty Tiger, Chief of the\r\nCreek Nation, he has frequently visited Washington. I asked Captain\r\nGrayson to read the manuscript of my Oklahoma section prior to\r\npublication, and am indebted to him for valuable suggestions and\r\ninformation. Captain Grayson as interpreter has been made use of by the\r\nSmithsonian Institution men in their investigations of Creek language,\r\nmythology and family life. There is no more able interpreter in all the\r\nState of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nMr. M. L. Mott has been referred to in previous pages of this chapter.\r\nIn closing, I would call attention to a remarkable scene which occurred\r\nin the office of the Secretary of the Interior in February, 1914. The\r\nOklahoma delegation in Congress from the state of Oklahoma, had opposed\r\nthe reappointment of Mott as attorney for the Creek Indians. As we have\r\nseen in previous pages, Mott put up a heroic fight on behalf of his\r\nclients, thereby incurring the ill will of many persons. Each afternoon\r\nfor five days, were arrayed against him all the Congressmen from\r\nOklahoma. At the conclusion of these lengthy sessions, in which the\r\nopponents were unable to prove anything of consequence against Mr. Mott,\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior issued him the following letter:\r\n\r\n                     THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\n                               WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n                                                    February 14, 1914.\r\n\r\n  My dear Mr. Mott:\r\n\r\n  Chief Moty Tiger and myself have agreed upon Judge Allen as your\r\n  successor as Attorney for the Creek Nation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I shall always take pleasure in contemplating the manner in which\r\n  you conducted yourself during the inquiry here. That you have been\r\n  honest under difficulties and fearless at all times in doing your\r\n  duty, seems to be admitted even by those to whom you have been most\r\n  antipathetic.\r\n\r\n  I am glad to know that you are going to return to Oklahoma and I\r\n  trust that by mingling freely with those people they will come to\r\n  see you as a man of ideals.\r\n\r\n                                       Cordially yours,\r\n                                             (Signed) FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n  M. L. Mott, Esq.,\r\n      Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nWe may search governmental records in vain for a parallel case. Here was\r\na faithful servant of the public, a loyal friend to the Indians. The\r\nCongressmen appeared against him in force and brought up every\r\nconceivable charge, in order to encompass his fall; striving to preserve\r\nofficial peace in Oklahoma, the Honorable Secretary was forced to\r\nreplace him, yet at the same time wrote a commendatory letter in Mott’s\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nThe night following his honorable defeat, I saw Mott in his room at the\r\nNational Hotel. With him were two staunch friends of the Creeks, Chief\r\nMoty Tiger and Captain G. W. Grayson. Mott uttered a remarkable\r\nprophecy: “Moorehead, they are rid of me. The next step will be to force\r\nout the Department of Justice men, Gresham and Frost; then Kelsey and\r\nWright will have to go; Kate Barnard must stop protecting minor heirs,\r\nor her board will be abolished; also your Indian Commissioners. Having\r\ncut off the real fighters, then they will remove restrictions. A few\r\nyears hence—and do not forget this—the Oklahoma Congressmen will ask the\r\nAmerican people to support Indian paupers, claiming that Federal\r\nnegligence has brought distress to thousands, and that the State of\r\nOklahoma must not be called upon to care for these indigents. Most\r\npeople who took Indian lands will not be compelled to return them, and\r\nthe Federal slate will be wiped clean of the 30,000 land suits now\r\npending.”\r\n\r\nIn eight months, nearly half of Mott’s prophecy has been verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHAPTER XVI. THE LEASING SYSTEM; CHOCTAW AND CHICKASAW; FINAL\r\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFew Indian matters in our honorable Congress have had more publicity\r\nthan the so-called McMurray contracts. Several chapters of this book\r\ncould be devoted to describing the propositions made by Mr. McMurray and\r\nhis associates and the far-reaching effects on the Indians of Oklahoma\r\nwere these carried into effect. But I must content myself with calling\r\nattention to the bibliography at the end of this chapter. The testimony\r\nand investigations cover hundreds of pages.\r\n\r\nMr. McMurray made contracts with thousands of Indians on a percentage\r\nbasis. P. J. Hurley, Esq., attorney for the Choctaw Indians, opposed the\r\nMcMurray contracts before Congressional Committees and in court. Hurley\r\ncontended that McMurray would receive at the least possible estimate\r\n$3,500,000 in fees, the undistributed portion of the Choctaw and\r\nChickasaw estate being $35,000,000 minimum valuation. The struggle for\r\nso large a stake has extended through a number of years. So far Mr.\r\nHurley, and other friends of the Indians, have succeeded in preventing\r\nMcMurray carrying his contracts into effect.\r\n\r\nThe Choctaw and Chickasaw affairs are both interesting and complicated,\r\nand tell a different story from that of the Creeks. Further reference to\r\nCherokees and Seminoles may be omitted, as their story is practically\r\nthat of the Creeks.\r\n\r\nA little more than two-thirds of the entire acreage—a vast domain over\r\n200 miles east and west, and an average of approximately 100 miles north\r\nand south—was allotted and sold for the benefit of these three classes\r\nof Indians, the Choctaws, Chickasaws and Mississippi Choctaws, about\r\n37,600 in number—a little more than one-third of the total Oklahoma\r\nenrollment.\r\n\r\nThe eastern third of this territory is especially rich in coal and\r\nhardwood timber. What is shown upon the map as the Choctaw Nation\r\ncontains the largest coal deposits in what is generally known as the\r\nMississippi valley, and when allotment of lands began in 1903, this\r\ncountry was practically covered with a rich growth of pine timber of the\r\nfinest quality.\r\n\r\nThe Chickasaw Nation comprised the greatest agricultural and\r\nstock-raising lands, some of which had been under cultivation for half a\r\ncentury. By the use of these vast estates, they became well-to-do and\r\nself-supporting. The richness of the country becoming known, Whites and\r\nnegroes flocked to Indian Territory with the idea prominent that they\r\nwere going to be permitted to homestead the surplus land, as had been\r\nthe custom in breaking up Indian reservations. With the opening of the\r\nCherokee strip, the Cheyenne and Arapaho and the Iowa and Comanche\r\nreservations on the west, comprising all of the western half of\r\nOklahoma, immigrants flocked to these openings. Some of the best of them\r\nremained as farmers in that great western country. The riff-raff, after\r\nexploiting those western and northern reservations, came back to Indian\r\nTerritory to ply their vocations at the various allotting agencies among\r\nthe Five Civilized Tribes.\r\n\r\nBy 1903 all kinds of land, livestock and timber companies were at work;\r\nskillful lawyers schemed to change the laws. More than one Indian,\r\ndisgusted with the “Christian” white man, stayed in the Choctaw hills\r\namong the pine forests and refused to come out and perform the duties\r\nnecessary under the laws made for him in order that he might receive his\r\nallotment. Each man, woman and child was to receive $1040 worth of land,\r\nappraised at from twenty-five cents to $6.50 per acre; also 320 acres of\r\naverage land. He was supposed to look it over, and being satisfied with\r\nit, come to the land office and file his “descriptions” with an\r\naffidavit that he owned such improvements, if any there were, and the\r\npossessary right to the land selected. He could not be induced to come.\r\nIt cost money to go 200 miles over into the Chickasaw Nation, or even to\r\nfind suitable land in the Choctaw Nation.\r\n\r\nUnder the allotment act the members of the tribes were given the right\r\nto alienate one-half their lands within five years from date of patents.\r\nThe more ignorant classes were more easily influenced, and runners were\r\nemployed to go over in the Choctaw Nation and “shell the woods” for\r\nIndians. Sufficient quantities of whiskey, an interpreter, and expense\r\nmoney were all that was necessary. Indians were brought into the\r\nallotting agencies by the score. He was taken out in a conveyance and\r\ndriven a few miles from the agency and shown the best improved farm in\r\nthe country, a deal made with him to lease the land for five years in\r\nconsideration of the purchase of the possessary right to the land. His\r\nplans were prepared for him. His allotment known as surplus which would\r\nbe alienable within five years, was plotted upon improved lands which he\r\nhad never seen and the balance of his land known as homestead selected\r\nfor him in some out of the way place, generally upon the hills. To this\r\nday most of these full-blood Indians have never seen nor set foot upon\r\ntheir several allotments.\r\n\r\nA case or two illustrating Choctaw and Chickasaw affairs is illuminating\r\nof general conditions. Addie B. Fasler was a minor full-blood Indian\r\nabout twelve years of age in 1907, and a certain man was made guardian\r\nfor her. Under a new act of Congress an additional judge had been\r\nappointed in the southern district, Judge J. T. Dickenson, and he had\r\nbeen assigned the northern half of the district by agreement between\r\nhimself and the other judge. This application was presented to him for\r\napproval. Judge Dickenson refused to appoint the one requested, but upon\r\nhis own motion selected a man by the name of Wright living at Sulphur.\r\nUp to this time such independence on the part of the judiciary was\r\nunusual and war from this time on existed between the old and the new\r\njudge. Wright found his ward in squalor. He found that she owned, by\r\nreason of the death of her family, four allotments besides her own—that\r\nthey consisted of something like a thousand acres of improved land, the\r\nlarger part in cultivation; that all of this land had been in the\r\npossession of a Mr. Mullen since allotment, and was at that time being\r\nrented out by Mr. Mullen for an average rental of $2.50 per acre per\r\nyear. Mr. Wright employed attorneys and began proceedings to recover\r\nthese lands for his ward. He was met at the hearing by a subsequently\r\nappointed guardian from the central district who had been appointed at\r\nthe instance of Mullen. The hearing was had before the old judge who\r\npromptly held that the domicile of the minor was in the central district\r\nand that the United States Court for the southern district had no\r\njurisdiction to appoint Mr. Wright guardian. What has become of Addie B.\r\nFasler or her vast estates? She is one of the many now “unknown” since\r\nher property is gone.\r\n\r\nAfter statehood, the Chocktaw and Chickasaw Nations were cut up into\r\nmany counties and probate matters transferred to the County Courts of\r\nthe counties which included the court towns. Provisions were made to\r\ntransfer probate cases to the county which would have had jurisdiction\r\nhad such case been inaugurated after statehood.\r\n\r\nLittle effort has been made to transfer these cases, because the Indians\r\nthemselves are ignorant of the fact that administrators and guardians\r\nhave been appointed elsewhere and only in those instances where the\r\ngrafter wants to sell or lease the land is any pretense made to have\r\neverything regular. This condition has resulted in the appointment of\r\nguardians in the counties of the residence of the minors to recover\r\nlands and rentals. Much litigation has grown out of these conflicts, and\r\nit is safe to say that in very few instances have the grafters\r\nsurrendered to the Indian lands allotted to him.\r\n\r\nCharles McKinney is an ignorant, easy-going quarter-blood Chickasaw with\r\nfour or five minor children. Their lands were scattered in Poulatre,\r\nJohnson, Marshall and Carter Counties. He was their guardian. He sold\r\nthese various allotments through the County Court of —— County and\r\nreceived something like $7000. The mayor of the city was on his bond. A\r\ncertain judge, the mayor and several other politicians decided to buy a\r\nlocal newspaper which was too independent for the good of the party.\r\nThis money was loaned to the mayor, who gave as security a mortgage upon\r\nseveral tracts of land which he did not own, and used the money in the\r\npurchase of the newspaper plant; the latter became insolvent and was\r\nsold by its creditors, and the guardian squandered the balance of the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi Choctaws are Indians of a low order of intelligence.\r\nThey were imported into this country in 1902 and 1903 by land companies,\r\namong which was the Choctaw Investment Company, now defunct, and J. E.\r\nArnold. They were herded in barracks around Ardmore and other places\r\nduring 1902, 1903 and 1904; the smallpox broke out among them and they\r\ndied like sheep. Before they left Mississippi, contracts were made with\r\nthem in which they agreed to prove up on their lands and sell them to\r\nthe promoters.\r\n\r\nThe stockholders of the Chocktaw Investment Company and other\r\nnon-residents furnished the money and have stood the loss, but J. E.\r\nArnold and Senator Owen are now pressing before the Court of Claims\r\nlarge accounts for allowance. To secure these claims if allowed, J. E.\r\nArnold has filed a lien upon almost every allotment of a Mississippi\r\nChoctaw in these two nations. Congress has recognized these claims by\r\npermitting them to be litigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\nExcept a few persons, everybody agrees that affairs in Oklahoma are in a\r\nbad shape. The Indian Office is doing all that it can through Mr. Sells’\r\nattorneys to bring about desired reforms and protection, but it is\r\nexceedingly slow work. We must adopt Miss Barnard’s plan if we desire to\r\nsave the remaining Indian peoples in Oklahoma. That is, briefly, to\r\narouse the conscience in hundreds of thousands of good citizens in\r\nOklahoma and persuade them to take a firm stand against further\r\ndespoilation of Indians. The grafters, through their newspapers, have\r\nexerted an influence out of all proportion to their strength. They have\r\ndominated in Oklahoma. They have even subsidized. One of the newspapers\r\nwhich attacked Hon. George Vaux, Jr., and afterwards was very bitter\r\ntoward Mr. Mott and myself, received thousands of dollars from an Indian\r\nminor child’s estate. This money was used to boom a political journal.\r\n\r\nAll who would save the Indian must stimulate the better class of\r\ncitizens into action. Attacking grafters, is not bringing into discredit\r\nthe good name of a great State. I mention this because the grafters\r\nraise the cry of State persecution. They do not, however, deny the\r\npauperizing of Indians, or the 30,000 specific cases of fraud. Miss\r\nBarnard well answers critics with the statement that we are merely\r\nattacking forces of evil. The people of Oklahoma themselves can solve\r\nthe problem promptly and satisfactorily, if they will assert their\r\nrights. All the protection and publicity, and legal procedures in the\r\nworld will not save the Oklahoma Indians, if the better class of\r\ncitizens (the great majority) do not take a firm stand for right and\r\njustice. The ministers, Miss Barnard claims, are already beginning to\r\npreach sermons against graft—all of which indicates a trend of healthy\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Foreman, who has worked along the same lines as Department of\r\nJustice officials, Miss Barnard and Mr. Kelsey, and has been associated\r\nwith Mr. Mott, takes a rather gloomy view. I present his paragraphs\r\nherewith:\r\n\r\n“In a few short years, Congress has removed the restrictions on the sale\r\nof nearly 70 per cent of the 100,000 Indians of the tribes—on all but\r\nthe full-bloods. The inevitable has overtaken these mixed-bloods from\r\nwhom Congress released its protecting supervision, and probably not one\r\nin ten of them retains even a considerable part of his original\r\nallotment of land.\r\n\r\n“The experiment of turning these mixed-blood Indians loose has been a\r\nlamentable mistake. But at least some good should be extracted from it.\r\nThe lesson should be employed to emphasize the need for protection of\r\nthe full-blood. The mixed-blood as a land owner is no more. He is gone\r\nand there is practically nothing to be done for his class except in the\r\nprotection of his minor children.\r\n\r\n“But the full-blood still has his land, for his restrictions have never\r\nbeen released. There is no obligation to these Indians so commanding as\r\nthe duty of seeing to it that they are protected in their property; this\r\nmeans that the restrictions against the sale of their lands must not be\r\nrelaxed except under the supervision of the Interior Department. To\r\npermit them to sell their lands without this protection would expose\r\nthem to their own inexperience and improvidence, to the cunning of the\r\nshameless horde of white land grafters.\r\n\r\n“It was claimed that at least the mixed-bloods are competent to handle\r\ntheir property, and developments have shown the fallacy of that claim.\r\nMany of the full-bloods are but little more fortunate. Totally\r\nunprepared they have had thrust upon them individual ownership of their\r\nlands. In 1906 Congress provided that full-blood Indians might sell\r\nlands inherited from deceased relatives. As the rate of mortality is\r\nhigh among these people, there are many such inheritances and many such\r\nsales have been made. In a great number of instances they have been\r\nswindled out of their inheritances for a pittance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _by Rodman Wanamaker, 1913_ _Chief Keen, Koon-Ta-Chy\r\naddressing the Council_]\r\n\r\n“Congress unwisely permitted these full-bloods to lease most of their\r\nland for five years without supervision. Thousands of them were induced\r\nby white speculators to lease their land, including their homes and\r\nlittle cultivated farms which were capable of making them comfortable.\r\nInexperienced in such transactions, they gave the white man their home\r\nfor five years for little or nothing, the consideration depending on the\r\nextent of fraud practiced on them. The speculator in turn sublets the\r\nland to a renter and makes a handsome profit on the transaction. The\r\nIndian was then forced to move on the land of a relative, or into the\r\nhills on unimproved land, with practically nothing to sustain his\r\nfamily. In many cases only the first year’s rent is paid the Indian and\r\nthe lessee refuses to pay more. The Indian in his helplessness knows no\r\nremedy and suffers almost a total loss of the consideration agreed upon.\r\nThis situation is particularly distressing in the Choctaw and Chickasaw\r\nNations.\r\n\r\n“These leases are extended by methods which the mind of the Indian\r\ncannot comprehend, and once out of possession it is practically\r\nimpossible for the Indian to get his land back. When the restrictions\r\nare removed from the sale of this class of land, which is looked forward\r\nto by the people holding them, they will make the most of their\r\nadvantage over the Indian, by making it practically impossible for the\r\nIndian to get any other buyers than the lessees, who will buy on their\r\nown terms. This mean advantage is evidenced now in another way. The\r\nIndian Department can sell part of the Indian’s allotment for the\r\nIndian’s benefit, but in many cases a sale for an adequate consideration\r\nis defeated by the presence of leases often taken by white speculators\r\nfor no other purpose than to prevent anyone else buying the land, or to\r\ndemand a heavy tribute for a surrender of the lease.\r\n\r\n“The newspapers and the court files of the eastern half of Oklahoma for\r\nseveral years have been filled with the stories of the Indians’ undoing\r\nwhich explains the swift impoverishment of the mixed-blood Indian. If\r\nthe mixed-bloods could not stand up against this condition, what chance,\r\nwould the full-bloods have?\r\n\r\n“When the hardy pioneer ventured within the domain of the aboriginal\r\nproprietors of this country he found himself among what are often\r\ndescribed as “hostile” people. It is a strange caprice of fortune that\r\nwith the coming of the white man’s civilizing influence, the description\r\n“hostile” should be shifted from the Indian to the white man, and the\r\nsubmissive red man, remaining upon his own land, should discover himself\r\nsurrounded by the perils of hostile white people. Perils less bloody but\r\nmore insidious and relentless; the thirst for blood supplanted by the\r\nthirst for the Indian’s property; the Indian’s ambush exchanged for the\r\nwhite man’s ambush of intrigue and deception; conquest of the stout of\r\nheart and arm routed by the conquest of the pen and deceit and of the\r\nbrain befuddled by the devastating alcohol.\r\n\r\n“The Indian is groping his way through the dusk of his day upon earth\r\nand soon he will pass from our sight and the sound of his footsteps will\r\ncease. As he proceeds falteringly, this shred of a great race is\r\ncomforted by no expressions of good will. The road is rough and the\r\nguideposts are far between and hard to read. The only light that would\r\nreveal his path to him shines distantly but faithfully. From this light,\r\nfrom the voices and counsels of a few distant friends unselfishly\r\nstriving for him, comes the only promise of amelioration.”\r\n\r\nMiss Barnard’s assistant, Mr. Huston, at Lake Mohonk, dictated to me the\r\nfollowing two paragraphs as indicative of the essential things for which\r\nthe Department of Charities and Corrections is fighting. It must be\r\nunderstood that the second paragraph from the end is not aimed at the\r\nIndian Office personnel. It is merely a statement of fact, that the new\r\nattorneys labor under disadvantage.\r\n\r\n1st. To elect a Legislature pledged to appropriate sufficient funds to\r\nmake effective the Department of Charities and Corrections,—the only arm\r\nof Government, Federal or State, which is clothed with legal authority\r\nto intervene in the probate courts of Oklahoma on behalf of Indian minor\r\nheirs.\r\n\r\n2nd. To enact a law embodying adequate probate procedure. The probate\r\nprocedure recently agreed to between the probate judges of Oklahoma and\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs is substantially the same procedure\r\nwhich was prepared by M. L. Mott and put into effect in five out of the\r\neight counties of the Creek Nation several years previous to the present\r\nadministration. Mr. Mott had this procedure embodied in a bill which\r\npassed the lower house of the Oklahoma Legislature two years ago, but\r\nwhich was defeated through the influence of grafters in the Senate. Mott\r\nknew that the probate procedure, depending for its force and effect\r\nmerely upon the personal agreement of county judges elected by a\r\nconstituency hostile to the Indians, would be ineffective to protect\r\nIndian minors, unless the same had the force of law, and provided\r\nadequate penalties for violation of same.\r\n\r\nFinally, all good citizens in the United States must rally to the\r\nsupport of those who are making a fight for simple justice and decency\r\nin Oklahoma. If the better element in that State is defeated by a\r\ncombination of oil, coal, gas, timber, land, and asphalt interests, the\r\ntaxpayers of this country will be called upon to support 100,000\r\nhomeless paupers. Nowhere else in the United States are 100,000 citizens\r\nto be dispossessed, and if this calamity is permitted to occur, the\r\nblackest page in all American history shall have been written. A\r\nhelpless, a trusting, and a dependent people look to us to keep the\r\nfinal one of all our promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PARTIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY ON OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n  Lengthy discussion of Indian Affairs.

THE GREATEST INDIAN OF MODERN TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nHe belonged to the Oglala division of Teton Sioux. He was born at the\r\nforks of the Platte River and died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, 1909.\r\n\r\nIt is said that he counted coups—that is, he touched the bodies of\r\nenemies—eighty times with his coup-stick.\r\n\r\nThe band of the Sioux to which he belonged is known as Iteshicha. As no\r\ncomprehensive account of his life has ever been published, I intend to\r\ndevote this entire chapter to him and his activities. He first comes\r\ninto prominence in 1865, when the Government undertook to build a road\r\nfrom Fort Laramie, Wyoming, to the gold regions of Montana. Red Cloud\r\ncaptured a detachment of troops and held same prisoners for two weeks\r\nand then released them without injury. Commissioners were sent out from\r\nWashington that fall to treat with him, and he refused to meet with\r\nthem.[27]\r\n\r\nOf the individuals who exerted an influence upon the various bands of\r\nSioux something can be learned by a search of the records. Perhaps\r\nSitting Bull and Red Cloud are more popularly known than others. Every\r\nplainsman worthy of the name has had an encounter at some time during\r\nthe past with Red Cloud’s warriors. Army officers stationed on the\r\nfrontier in the ’60’s or ’70’s testify to the courage and dash of these\r\nsons of the Plains. The War Department records contain more frequent\r\nmention of Red Cloud than of any other American Indian; and the\r\npictographic accounts made by the Sioux themselves upon tanned buffalo\r\nhides, many years ago, are filled with evidences of the prowess of this\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nMakh-ṕiya-lúta, or Red Cloud, has said in his pictographic history\r\nof his life, that he was born in the year 1822.[28] His\r\nparents were not prominent among the tribe. He calls this year\r\n“Star-passed-by-with-a-loud-noise-winter.” The Sioux, in their\r\nwinter-counts, designate each year by some particular or striking\r\noccurrence. For instance, in Red Cloud’s winter-counts, or census, one\r\nwinter is called “Winter-in-which-many-died-of-smallpox”; another,\r\n“Winter-we-killed-one-hundred-white-men.” There are several of these\r\nwinter-counts made by different chiefs in possession of the Government,\r\nwhich agree as to the naming of each year, and only vary in minor\r\ndetails. Two of them cover a surprisingly long period of time, from 1800\r\nto 1877. Both have been carefully studied by ethnologists and\r\ninterpreters, and accurate translations prove them of special value to\r\nhistory students.\r\n\r\nOf the extreme youth of Red Cloud we know nothing. An old Indian, when\r\nasked at Pine Ridge, shrugged his shoulders and said, “All great men\r\nwere once boys.” He was trained as became a young Lakota. All Indian\r\nchildren learn to ride when extremely young. General Dodge says that,\r\nwhether men or boys, the Plains tribes, or, as most officers call them,\r\n“Horse Indians,” produced the finest horsemen in the world. Red Cloud\r\nwas not a hereditary chief, but arose to distinction through merit.\r\n\r\nRed Cloud was about sixteen when he became a leader among the other\r\nboys, signalizing himself in skirmishes and battles with the Crows,\r\nPawnees, and other hereditary enemies of the Sioux. The various\r\nwinter-counts tell us that many severe engagements occurred between the\r\nCrows and the Sioux, and it is doubtless true that he charged and\r\nyelled, scalped and tortured just as energetically as his companions.\r\n\r\nMr. C. W. Allen, who is well acquainted with Red Cloud, prepared a\r\nmanuscript some years ago, before the chief’s memory failed. Because the\r\nchief presents his version of Plains history, the work is unique and\r\nmerits publication. Heretofore we have had only the white man’s\r\nnarratives.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1849 there were but few attacks against Whites on the\r\nPlains, and most of these occurred to the south, in Texas, or along the\r\nold Santa Fe trail. It was not until and during 1849 that extensive\r\nemigration set in towards California. As the wagon-trains increased, the\r\nhunting of the Indians was seriously interfered with. Expeditions, not\r\nonly of United States troops but of adventurers, buffalo hunters, and\r\nminers, penetrated to various parts of the great West. Among these\r\ntravelers were men who regarded an Indian no higher than a dog, and\r\nfired upon peaceful parties of hunting Indians without the slightest\r\nprovocation. Wagon-trains were often in charge of men from the East who\r\nknew nothing whatever of Indians or their habits, and becoming insanely\r\nfrightened at the approach of either friendly or hostile red men, opened\r\nfire without the slightest thought of consequences. It is therefore not\r\nsurprising that all the Plains Indians soon assumed a hostile attitude\r\ntoward any being with a white skin.\r\n\r\nI have talked with many old Indians of Pine Ridge, Red Cloud’s home, and\r\nthey have agreed that the destruction of the buffalo was the greatest\r\ncalamity ever brought upon their race. They could forgive the Whites for\r\nattacking their villages, and for the disregard of treaty promises, and\r\noverlook the seizure of their lands, but they could not forget that the\r\nAmericans made useless and unnecessary slaughter of that grand, majestic\r\nnative animal, typical of the “spirit of the Plains.” But few men\r\nappreciate what the buffalo was to the Indian. Thousands of men flocked\r\nwest to hunt buffalo solely for their hides. Most of them were\r\ninexperienced and destroyed many animals before they learned how to\r\nproperly prepare a robe for sale. The great Platte valley, the Arkansas,\r\nthe Niobrara and other Plains rivers, were in a few years lined with\r\nmillions of skeletons a pitiful spectacle—wretched relics of a once\r\nnoble creature. Complaints were made by the Indians, who depended solely\r\nupon the buffalo for existence, to the Government at Washington, but\r\nwithout avail. More butchers, attracted by the alluring and exciting\r\nlife of the hunter, flocked to the West. They strained every nerve to\r\nmake a “record” in destroying these animals. To be a buffalo-hunter\r\nbecame popular, and a number of persons have since carried through life\r\nnames distinguishing them from their fellows because of the exceeding\r\nslaughter which they made. Col. Dodge, who spent from 1819 to 1884 on\r\nthe frontier, blames the hunters, miners, and cowboys for the Indian\r\nwars. This class of people regarded the rights of no persons, save\r\nthemselves. While our Government was supposed to protect, it did little\r\nsave send out Peace Commissions and armies in rotation. The lawless\r\nwhite men were never controlled. But the day of retribution was at hand.\r\nThe Sioux held a great council, which was attended by the dissatisfied\r\nelement of other bands, and decided to drive out all the whites found in\r\ntheir hunting territory. They split up into small bands, attacked\r\nemigrant trains, killed hunters, and at the time of the Civil War were\r\ncarrying on a general warfare from the Black Hills to the frontiers of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RED CLOUD AND PROFESSOR MARSH\r\n\r\n  The illustration is reproduced from a photograph in the possession of\r\n    Miss Fannie Brown, of Andover. The date is uncertain, but supposed\r\n    to be 1874 or ’75\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter the terrible massacre of 1862 in Minnesota[29] the Indians became\r\nbolder, and having received recruits from the bands who had fled from\r\nMinnesota they held up several large wagon-trains, killed or captured\r\nthe escorts and appropriated the goods. When the news of this affair\r\nreached Washington, Colonels Carrington and Fetterman were ordered to\r\nsubdue the Plains Indians, and were sent to Wyoming, where they\r\nestablished Fort Phil. Kearny on the Piney fork of the Powder River. Not\r\nonly was this movement necessary on the part of the Government because\r\nof the hostility of the Sioux, but it was desired to open a road through\r\nthe Powder River country to Virginia City and other mining towns in the\r\nmountains, and also to the coast. Part of the territory was owned by the\r\nCrows, but the Dakotas had usurped most of it as hunting-grounds for\r\nthemselves. Several conferences between the authorities and the Indians\r\nwere held, but as dissatisfaction among the Indians was manifest, no\r\nsettlement could be effected. “We will lose,” said they, “all our best\r\nhunting territory if this route is established.” Red Cloud and other\r\nchiefs (Crazy Horse, American Horse, etc.) saw opportunity for war and\r\nopenly urged hostilities. Clouds of warriors flocked to his standard.\r\nDuring the long and tedious struggle he won great reputation as a\r\nleader. General Dodge said:[30] “Several forts were established, but\r\nthey only protected what was inside the palisades. A load of wood for\r\nfuel could not be cut outside without a conflict.”\r\n\r\nDuring these troublous times Fort Laramie was the center of importance,\r\npeace conferences, Indians coming and going, troops and supplies\r\narriving from the East. When Colonel Carrington and his troops left\r\nLaramie, June, 1866, they were constantly watched by Red Cloud, and a\r\nreliable report states that upon the visit of some Indians at\r\nheadquarters the commander was informed of his movements, in detail,\r\nduring the entire journey. With the troops was Capt. Frederick H. Brown,\r\nnoted for his bravery and contempt of Indians, and after the\r\nestablishment of the post he infused in Col. William J. Fetterman some\r\nof his own spirit. Both officers declared that a nervy White could put\r\nto flight a hundred Sioux. When calling one evening, Brown told Colonel\r\nCarrington’s wife that he must have Red Cloud’s scalp before he returned\r\nEast, but, instead, Red Cloud took his scalp on the day of the Fetterman\r\nfight, December 21, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe warriors harassed the garrison of Fort Phil. Kearny constantly,\r\nkilling small parties of wood-cutters. It became necessary to send out a\r\nguard of fifty to eighty men with every wood-train. Red Cloud drilled\r\nhis warriors daily, seeming to possess a system of signals equally as\r\ngood as those in use at the fort. Colonel Carrington, in his description\r\nof the events at the post, says on one occasion Red Cloud’s signals\r\ncovered a line of seven miles, and were rapidly and accurately\r\ndisplayed. Again, on December 6, a number of soldiers were killed. On\r\nthe 21st the picket signaled that the wagon-train was surrounded, and\r\nninety-seven men were sent to its relief. Afterward it was ascertained\r\nthat the train was threatened but not attacked; in fact, the teams and\r\nescort came in safely that night. Red Cloud had made a feint to draw\r\ntroops some distance from the post that he might engage them\r\nsuccessfully. The world knows the result, and it is not necessary for me\r\nto enter into details here. The entire command under Fetterman and Brown\r\nwas killed, including several citizens accompanying it. Col. H. B.\r\nCarrington, in his official report, says: “The officers who fell\r\nbelieved that no Indian force could overwhelm that number of troops well\r\nheld in hand.”\r\n\r\nRed Cloud’s name was heard throughout the land, and among his own people\r\nhe arose to be supreme chief; hundreds of recruits joined his camp, and\r\nhe was given an immense medicine dance and heralded as invincible.\r\n\r\nAugust 2, 1867, Major James Powell was attacked by a large force under\r\nthe command of Red Cloud and Spotted Tail. In this fight Red Cloud and\r\nhis warriors exhibited, with scarcely an exception, the greatest bravery\r\never shown by Indians in the history of the West. Unknown to the\r\nIndians, special wagon-beds, constructed of iron, were mounted on wheels\r\nby the Government blacksmiths. As soon as the attack began, the troops\r\nremoved these from the trucks and placed them in a small circle, the men\r\nconcealing themselves beneath. The iron was sufficiently heavy to stop\r\nor deflect bullets, and the men were armed with the first repeating\r\nrifles brought on the Plains. They were thus better equipped than their\r\nadversaries. Red Cloud charged no less than eight or ten times,\r\nfrequently coming within thirty or forty feet, many of his dead falling\r\nless than twenty or thirty yards from the improvised fortification. The\r\nIndians could not understand how so small a body of men could fire with\r\nsuch rapidity. Red Cloud said to Spotted Tail, as the two sat their\r\nhorses on a little knoll a few hundred yards distant, that he believed\r\nthe Americans had “medicine guns,” which never ceased firing. The entire\r\nforce of the Sioux and Cheyennes was hurled against the enemy, Red\r\nCloud’s nephew distinguishing himself by riding among the foremost and\r\nthe two chiefs accompanying the charge. One Indian fell near enough to\r\ntouch the beds with his coup-stick before he died. But for the\r\nprotection, the Whites would have been wiped out of existence, for\r\nnearly every spot on the outer surface of the iron as large as one’s\r\nhand showed a bullet mark. An Indian chief told Colonel Dodge afterwards\r\nthat they lost 1137 in the fight. A famous scout said to Major Powell\r\nthat at least a thousand were struck, and the most conservative estimate\r\nplaces the number at three or four hundred. Not only was great bravery\r\nmanifested in these charges, but after the battle many of the dead and\r\nwounded were recovered in spite of a heavy fire kept up by the troops.\r\nIn the Fetterman fight Red Cloud had been victorious. In the Powell\r\nengagement he was badly defeated.\r\n\r\nThese two fights, and the series of peace treaties held by the Indian\r\nPeace Commissioners August 13 to September 13, 1867, brought about what\r\nthe Sioux desired—the evacuation and destruction of several forts in\r\nfavorite hunting territory, the promise of extra annuities and rations,\r\nand paved the way for the great Dakota treaty of 1868.\r\n\r\nIn 1868–’69 Hon. William Blackmore of London, visited the Plains tribes\r\nand made a lasting friendship with Red Cloud. At that time Red Cloud\r\nscorned the “white man’s road” and refused to have his photograph taken;\r\nbut it is noteworthy that he made an exception in favor of Mr.\r\nBlackmore, and in the first portrait of this distinguished red man we\r\nsee him standing side by side with the patron of the great South\r\nKensington (Blackmore) museum. Why did he do this? Because he knew that\r\nthe British treated the Indians well, and that for a century Indians in\r\nCanada lived unmolested, whereas just over the American border bloodshed\r\nand robbery were rampant.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty Red Cloud himself went to war no more, but instead\r\nbecame distinguished as a councilman and treaty maker. He was, with\r\nSpotted Trail, uncompromising, and insisted upon the fulfillment of\r\nevery condition of the later treaties.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull, a shaman, had made “medicine” for most of the battles, and\r\nabout the year 1870 came into prominence. To the Indian “medicine” means\r\nmuch. Upon going into action he places implicit confidence in the\r\nefficacy of his medicine first, in his own courage second. Sitting Bull,\r\nbeing very crafty, a schemer and a politician, became known as the\r\n“battle-medicine maker” of the Dakotas. Before the Custer fight he made\r\nseveral dozen medicine sacks, filled them with the “mystery,” and\r\nhastily distributed them among the chief warriors and subchiefs. After\r\nthe fight he and his friends claimed the honor of the victory, saying\r\nthat it was through his miraculous medicine alone that the Sioux\r\nprevailed over the soldiers. Sitting Bull seldom was a warrior, claimed\r\nlittle distinction as a fighter, and owes his reputation among the\r\nWhites as the leader of the forces on the Little Big Horn to the\r\nmisdirected energy of the newspapers. Red Cloud was friendly with\r\nSitting Bull, but was seldom associated with him either in councils or\r\nupon the field. The two present marked contrasts. The latter was very\r\noutspoken in his hatred of the Whites, lacked the tact and judgment\r\ndisplayed by Red Cloud in his later years, and appears decidedly the\r\ninferior man of the two. Sitting Bull’s temper was easily ruffled, and\r\neven as late as 1890 (he was killed December 15, 1890) he persisted in\r\nopen censure of Government authorities. To give an idea of his language,\r\nhe told General Miles, upon the occasion of their first meeting, that\r\n“God Almighty made me; God Almighty did not make me an agency Indian,\r\nand I’ll fight and die fighting before any white man can make me an\r\nagency Indian.” His prophecy was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nSo when Red Cloud settled down upon his reservation near Fort Robinson,\r\nSitting Bull continued to range about the Plains and in the valleys of\r\nthe Tongue, Powder, Yellowstone and Big Horn Rivers. Some of the\r\nturbulent element in Red Cloud’s camp joined him, but by far the greater\r\nportion of those who followed Sitting Bull until after the Custer fight\r\nwere not Oglalas. In 1874–’75, when Professor Marsh of Yale, passed\r\nthrough the agency, he noted that there were some 13,000 Indians under\r\nthe care of the authorities. He reported that the provisions issued them\r\nwere of poor quality and insufficient, and tardily delivered. Lieutenant\r\nCarpenter also complained that the Indians were compelled to eat ponies,\r\ndogs and wolves to avoid starvation. Professor Marsh stated that the\r\ngoods purchased by the Government, carefully and honestly delivered and\r\ndistributed, would prevent all suffering. Eastern newspapers published\r\nMarsh’s charges, and the “Indian ring” of politicians was defeated.\r\nMarsh was well received by Red Cloud, who accompanied him East. The two\r\nwere photographed together, holding the peace-pipe in common. The Sioux\r\ncalled Professor Marsh the “Big Bone Chief,” because he hunted fossils\r\nin the Bad Lands. And while Bills and Dicks of frontier fame howled\r\nabout the “hostile Injuns” and engaged in frequent fights with the\r\nSioux, Marsh came and went in that wild country safe. The “murderers”\r\nknew he was to be trusted! (_See page 176_)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JACK RED CLOUD\r\n\r\n  Son of the War Chief of all the Sioux. Pine Ridge, 1909.

The war began August 18 and lasted about twelve\r\n  days. The number of white people killed was about 500. The whole or a\r\n  large part of some fifteen or twenty counties was fearfully desolated,\r\n  and for a time almost entirely depopulated. In one of the engagements\r\n  between the Indians and a company of regular troops, twenty-three\r\n  soldiers were killed and about sixty wounded, and also ninety-two\r\n  horses were killed. Chief Big Eagle makes a statement of the causes\r\n  which led up to the trouble. The Whites were constantly urging the\r\n  Indians to live like the white man. Some were willing, but others were\r\n  not and could not—the Indians were annoyed, and wanted to do as they\r\n  pleased. “Then,” he says, “some of the white men abused the Indian\r\n  women in a certain way and disgraced them, and surely there was no\r\n  excuse for that.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Our Wild Indians, pp. 83, 84, by Col. H. I. Dodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CHAPTER XVIII. RED CLOUD’S LATER YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that Red Cloud’s ponies were looked upon as legitimate\r\nprey by the Whites living near the reservation. One man told me he had\r\nseen a bunch of cattle driven around the beef corral twice in order to\r\nfigure in a double count, and corn and provisions had been passed twice\r\nthrough a certain building in order that some one might make just 100\r\nper cent off the Indians. During the early ’70’s horse-stealing was\r\ncarried on to a surprising extent, and Indian ponies were openly sold in\r\nfrontier towns. A deputy United States marshal, who had twenty years’\r\nexperience on the reservation of the Sioux, told me that some detectives\r\nand trailers employed by the Government were in league with the thieves\r\nand received two compensations—one from the Government and the other\r\nfrom their confederates. Stolen stock was seldom recovered. The\r\nwarriors, becoming desperate, would steal stock from some ranchman in\r\nretaliation. Another method of getting even was to complain to the\r\nofficers at Fort Robinson, who would give the Sioux an escort of troops.\r\nAlong the trail of the robbers the combined forces traveled as rapidly\r\nas possible, and, upon reaching any ranch or town where ponies were\r\nassembled in large numbers, the warriors would claim, and apparently\r\nidentify as their property, a number of horses. Protests on the part of\r\nthe Whites were of no avail, and the triumphant party would return with\r\nsome of the stolen stock, and, perhaps, some which had never been on\r\ntheir pastures. I asked an old Indian about this and he said it seldom\r\nhappened, but as they lost thousands of horses which were never\r\nrecovered, and as nearly all white men living near the reservation were\r\nthere to rob the Indians, and as every white man (whether he had or had\r\nnot Sioux ponies on hand) would deny knowledge of the location of stolen\r\nstock, he thought it was fair and just to seize everything in sight!\r\n\r\nIn spite of suffering, privation and thefts of every description, the\r\nRed Cloud tribe kept their faith. Would that white men had been as\r\nfaithful to their treaty promises. They complained to the Great Father\r\nthat they had been moved eight times since 1863. Exclaimed Red Cloud:\r\n“How can you expect us to take the white man’s road when you move us\r\nbefore we have time to plant and grow corn, to clear the ground and\r\nraise cattle?” In 1874 the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail reservations were\r\nin Western Nebraska, the nearest railroad point being Sidney, on the\r\nUnion Pacific. Except in spots the land was barren—absolutely worthless.\r\nRed Cloud said that the Whites gave it to his people because they could\r\nnot use it themselves. A delegation of Indians went to Washington, were\r\ntalked to in the usual patronizing manner, flattered, promised, and\r\nreturned to their agency. Some one suggested to the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs to remove the Indians to the Missouri River, where some\r\ngood soil assured corn and wheat. Red Cloud and Spotted Tail begged that\r\nthey be not sent there, for whisky was brought up the river and sold to\r\ntheir young men, to the injury of the entire tribe. Being assured that\r\ntheir supplies had all been sent to the old Ponca reservation, they\r\nconsented to go there provided they would be sent to a new reservation\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE HIDE HUNTER’S WORK. 40,000 BUFFALO HIDES AT DODGE CITY, KANSAS,\r\n    1876\r\n\r\n  Drawn from a print owned by R. M. Wright.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI can best describe what ensued by use of Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson’s\r\nwords:[31] “In the spring no orders came for the removal. March passed,\r\nApril passed—no orders. The chiefs sent word to their friend, General\r\nCrook, who replied to them with messages sent by swift runner, begging\r\nthem not to break away, but to wait a little longer. Finally, in May,\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs went himself to hold a council with\r\nthem. When he rose to speak, Chief Spotted Tail sprang up, walked toward\r\nhim, waving in his hand the paper containing the promise of the\r\nGovernment to return them to White Clay creek, and exclaimed: ‘All the\r\nmen who come from Washington are liars, and the bald-headed ones are the\r\nworst of all! I don’t want to hear one word from you—you are a\r\nbald-headed old liar! You have but one thing to do here, and that is to\r\ngive an order for us to return to White Clay Creek. Here are your\r\nwritten words, and if you don’t give this order, and everything here is\r\nnot on wheels inside of ten days, I’ll order my young men to tear down\r\nand burn everything in this part of the country! I don’t want to hear\r\nanything more from you, and I’ve got nothing more to say to you,’ and he\r\nturned his back on the Commissioner and walked away. Such language would\r\nnot have been borne from unarmed and helpless Indians; but when it came\r\nfrom a chief with 4000 armed warriors at his back, it was another affair\r\naltogether. The order was written. In less than ten days everything was\r\n‘on wheels’ and the whole body of these Sioux on the move to the country\r\nthey had indicated, and the Secretary of the Interior says, naively, in\r\nhis report: ‘The Indians were found to be quite determined to move\r\nwestward, and the promise of the Government in that respect was\r\nfaithfully kept’.” It had been decided in council that Spotted Tail\r\nwould do the talking, while Red Cloud and his followers held themselves\r\nin readiness for any emergency which might arise.\r\n\r\nCrazy Horse as war chief, and Sitting Bull as the most prominent of the\r\nshamans, engage our attention during 1875–’76. A continual warfare was\r\nkept up against the Whites. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills, and\r\nsettlers and miners flocked into the new territory, committing en route\r\ndepredations against the Sioux. They promptly retaliated, and our\r\nGovernment sent General Custer to remove the miners from the new\r\ngold-fields, and history records that he successfully scattered the\r\nobnoxious invaders. During his famous march not one shot was fired at\r\nIndians. Red Cloud had kept his treaty promise, but peace was not long\r\nto be maintained. The frontier towns began to fill up with outcasts of\r\ncivilization. Breeders of mischief, they instilled into the minds of the\r\nOglalas love of gain. “You should have more money, more rations,” said\r\nthey. “These lands to the north (Black Hills) are full of valuable mines\r\nwhich are yours. Drive out the miners and we will show you how to\r\ndevelop the country.” Custer had returned from his expedition and the\r\nminers flocked back to the gulches about Deadwood. Buffalo-hunters were\r\nfast destroying the great north and south herds, and Red Cloud beheld\r\nthe encroachments with a heavy heart. The death-knell of his people’s\r\nfreedom and prosperity on the Plains was sounded in the noise of the\r\ntrain, the blast in the mine, and the hum in the town. Civilization was\r\nadvancing, savagery must die! He could not go to war himself, he must\r\nlook after his people on the reservations; but he sent many of his best\r\nwarriors to join Crazy Horse and American Horse. Murders and robberies\r\nfollowed in rapid succession. Custer was ordered to the Little Big Horn\r\nto destroy the villages of the hostiles.\r\n\r\nAs to the battle which followed, the Bureau of Ethnology Report,\r\n1888–’89, gives a series of pictographic paintings made by Chief Red\r\nHorse, which are considered the most accurate we possess of the Sioux\r\nside of that unfortunate affair. I can only refer to it briefly. People\r\ndigging wild turnips saw a cloud of dust in the distance. Supposing it\r\nto be made by a herd of buffalo, they informed the end of the village\r\n(scattered for three miles along the river) nearest them. Before any\r\npersons were armed a runner came up in great excitement and said,\r\n“Soldiers are coming.” There was no time to hold a council. The chiefs\r\nshouted their orders. At first it seemed as if the whites would take the\r\nwhole village, but as warriors hastened up from the main body of the\r\ncamp, the flanks as well as the front were attacked, and the troops\r\nforced across the river. Red Horse says there were two men with long\r\nyellow hair. One wore a buckskin coat.\r\n\r\nCaptain French was the bravest man the Sioux ever fought. Red Horse says\r\nhe repeatedly covered the retreat of his men. Finally the soldiers\r\ngained the top of the hill and began to throw up little earthworks, but\r\nwere all killed. Red Horse said some of the soldiers became demoralized\r\nand begged the Sioux to take them prisoners but not to kill them.\r\n\r\nAt Pine Ridge agency I was told that Flat Hip, an Uncapapa Sioux,\r\nclaimed to have killed Custer. Flat Hip died of consumption a few years\r\nafter the battle. No one knew positively as to Custer’s manner of death,\r\nbut two men, dressed alike, were noticed for their bravery. Oglalas at\r\nPine Ridge said Sitting Bull was not in the fight, but made medicine\r\nwhile it was in progress. Eastman’s account is probably more correct.\r\n\r\nMany Sioux surrendered after the summer of 1876, and were returned to\r\ntheir respective agencies. Sitting Bull and his most faithful followers\r\nfled to Canada, where he remained some time. General MacKenzie took\r\nnearly all of Red Cloud’s horses shortly after the Custer battle, thus\r\neffectively preventing further hostilities.\r\n\r\nSeptember 3, 1877, a soldier ran a bayonet into Crazy Horse while the\r\nlatter was confined as a prisoner of war in the guard-house of Fort\r\nRobinson. The murder occasioned much talk among the Sioux, and, but for\r\nthe interference of Red Cloud, who counseled peace, would have resulted\r\nin a war of revenge. Crazy Horse was a desperate but withal, a brave\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of 1876 and 1877, Red Cloud gave General Crook a\r\nparty of young men to help him fight the Cheyennes, which was greatly to\r\nhis credit, considering his treatment at the hands of the Whites.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of his people to Pine Ridge agency he was somewhat\r\ndissatisfied because of the poor land given him as a reservation. He\r\nalso appealed to Washington for reimbursement for the ponies stolen by\r\nlawless men. There are voluminous reports, Congressional and Interior\r\nDepartment, filled with speeches of Red Cloud and his people, and all\r\nmore or less pathetic. They ask for fulfillment of treaty stipulations,\r\nfor money due, and for cattle and goods. At the time of the visit of the\r\nCongressional Committee in 1883 he had 8000 people under him. The flag\r\nfrom Fort Robinson agency was there, and, by the way, there is an\r\nincident regarding that flag. Their Agent had cut and hauled a long\r\npole, upon which he proposed to raise a flag. Red Cloud said he wanted\r\nno flag over his reservation, and so his men cut to pieces the\r\nflagstaff, but the Agent saved the colors and sent them to Pine Ridge.\r\n\r\nRed Cloud last achieved prominence in the Messiah craze of 1890.[32]\r\nWhether he believed in the coming of an Indian Savior is uncertain, but\r\nI know that he used his influence to preserve peace.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the Wounded Knee massacre reached Pine Ridge, a few\r\nmiles distant, most of the friendlies “stampeded,” tore down their\r\nlodges and fled north. Red Cloud and his daughter and son, in spite of\r\nprotests, were compelled to accompany them. Jack Red Cloud, his son,\r\nsmuggled him out of camp, and his daughter led him eighteen miles\r\nthrough a severe blizzard, back to Pine Ridge. I mention this incident\r\nto show the faithfulness of the man.\r\n\r\nRed Cloud was nearly blind and aged rapidly after 1890. Eighty-seven\r\nyears is a long time for an Indian to live. Continual exposure,\r\nuncertain food supply, and frail habitation, break down the\r\nconstitution, and one rarely sees an Indian more than sixty years of\r\nage. During the last years of his life Red Cloud enjoyed the comforts of\r\na two-story frame-house. It was given him by the Government as a special\r\nmark of honor. During the presence of the troops he kept a little\r\nAmerican flag and a white peace flag constantly floating above it. He\r\nbemoaned the fate of his race, and from his conversation one could\r\neasily discern that he had done his duty, had defended the claims of the\r\nDakotas in adversity as in prosperity. Over twenty years ago I had\r\nseveral conversations with him through the interpreter. He dwelt upon\r\nthe happy “buffalo days”, and the free life of the Plains sixty years\r\nago. We stepped outside the house and he told me to look about over the\r\nvalley, for his eyes were dim; but he knew its character. I cannot give\r\nthe exact words of his speech, but it was somewhat as follows: “You see\r\nthis barren waste. We have a little land along the creek which affords\r\ngood grazing, but we must use some of it for corn and wheat. There are\r\nother creeks which have bottoms like this, but most of the land is poor\r\nand worthless. Think of it! I, who used to own rich soil in a\r\nwell-watered country so extensive that I could not ride through it in a\r\nweek on my fastest pony, am put down here! Why, I have to go five miles\r\nfor wood for my fire. Washington took our lands and promised to feed and\r\nsupport us. Now I, who used to control 5000 warriors, must tell\r\nWashington when I am hungry. I must beg for that which I own. If I beg\r\nhard, they put me in the guard-house. We have trouble. Our girls are\r\ngetting bad. Coughing sickness every winter (consumption) carries away\r\nour best people. My heart is heavy, I am old, I cannot do much more.\r\nYoung man, I wish there was some one to help my poor people when I am\r\ngone.”\r\n\r\nIt is a singular anomaly that the character of an Indian should not be\r\ngauged by the same standards employed in measuring the virtues and worth\r\nof a white man. To my mind Red Cloud’s high character places him on an\r\nequality with prominent men of America, irrespective of color.\r\n\r\nIn considering the Indian, while most persons recognize the\r\ndisadvantages under which he has labored, yet I am persuaded that very\r\nfew realize the great, almost overwhelming difficulty, which must be\r\novercome before a truly strong and high character can be developed. With\r\nbut few exceptions, nearly every white man who went on the frontier as a\r\nscout, miner, trader, hunter or explorer, exhibited the worst side of\r\nhis character when among Indians. It is natural that when a man is in a\r\nnew and wild country, far from restraint, untrammeled by laws, unchecked\r\nby society or the refining influence of women, all that is bad in him\r\ncomes to the surface. Many men died in defense of a woman or child,\r\nunderwent great hardship to succor a comrade in danger, exhibited\r\npersonal bravery in the defense of claims, wagon-trains, ranches, etc.,\r\nbut, admitting all this in their favor, most of them were destitute of a\r\nregard for the rights of Indians. Such men inspired hatred in their\r\ndealings with the Sioux.\r\n\r\nThe Indian became acquainted with all that was bad, and saw but little\r\nof the real good of civilization. He heard more oaths than prayers, saw\r\nmore saloons than churches or schools. The men whom he met were not\r\ncalculated, by their acts, to inspire him with any confidence or respect\r\nfor the white race. If the Plains tribes had associated with a better\r\nclass of citizens before they had learned the vices of civilization, I\r\nam satisfied that the historian would not be compelled to write so dark\r\nand tragic a narrative; nor would he feel constrained to hold them up as\r\nfit subjects for pity and compassion.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Red Cloud came in contact with a class of white men\r\nwhose presence would not be tolerated in a respectable community; his\r\nhigh character, his forbearance, his submission to the unjust acts of\r\nhis conquerors, places him, in my opinion, among the great men of\r\nAmerica, regardless of color, birth or ancestry. His career exhibits a\r\ndegree of mental capacity, a knowledge of human nature and an\r\nacquaintance with the affairs of men which we would not expect in the\r\nmind of a savage. Red Cloud’s bearing towards the Government in the\r\nLeavenworth and Fort Robinson treaties, in having secured his end in\r\nboth instances, indicates a knowledge of diplomacy of no mean order.\r\n\r\nHis people were suddenly confronted with a high civilization which they\r\ncould neither understand nor follow. For centuries they had been\r\nschooled in the simple life of the Plains (and it ranked below the\r\nculture of the bronze age of man in Europe), unmolested by any extensive\r\nor exterminating war, content with their lot. To be suddenly brought\r\nface to face with a question, the issue of which was not a matter of\r\ntemporary supremacy, but involved the very existence of themselves as a\r\nnation—to have bravely met it, mustered every available young man and\r\nfought their superior forces for a period of nearly thirty years, and\r\nthen to have ceased only when resistance was no longer possible—presents\r\nan heroic spectacle. All through this stormy period, Red Cloud figures\r\nas a brave warrior, dignified counselor, and staunch advocate of the\r\nwelfare of his people.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty, he and his immediate followers, or those directly\r\nunder his control, observed their part of the agreement, although the\r\nwhite people gave them every pretext for violation. A weaker man, one of\r\nless character, would have taken his warriors, as Sitting Bull did, and\r\nhave fought until there was not a man left.\r\n\r\nRed Cloud possessed more human kindness than any of his red\r\ncontemporaries. It has been affirmed that after the Fetterman fight, he\r\nassisted the young men in scalping and mutilating the bodies of the\r\ndead. There is no direct evidence as to this. Red Cloud himself says he\r\nnever tortured a living person nor mutilated a dead body, and that those\r\nunder his control were no more cruel than the Colorado citizens at the\r\nSand Creek massacre, the soldiers in the battle of Washita, or the\r\nSeventh Cavalry at Wounded Knee. He cites the murder of Crazy Horse and\r\nseveral subchiefs after they had surrendered and were held as hostages\r\nin one of the forts. He also says that some Whites, many years ago,\r\nvisited the camps of the Sioux under the guise of friendship, and\r\npresented the Indians with whiskey which contained strychnine. Nineteen\r\nwho partook of it died in terrible agony. He claims that in all his\r\nfights and raids he never perpetrated cruelties like these; that he was\r\neither a staunch friend or a bitter enemy.\r\n\r\nIn his later years he rather inclined towards the faith of the\r\nCatholics, but when younger he was reported to have said that he\r\nbelieved in no white man’s God, but held to the Great Spirit,\r\nWakantanka, and propitiated the evil spirit also; that, if he tried to\r\ndo his duty, help his people and was a good man, he should not fear to\r\nmeet the Great Spirit in the hereafter. That so far he agreed with the\r\nmissionaries of different denominations, but because they were in\r\ndiscord among themselves as to just how the Great Spirit should be\r\nworshipped, he considered that not one of them was better than another;\r\nthat his religion was as good as theirs, and that he would do as his\r\nheart prompted him.\r\n\r\nHe has always been a little vainglorious, but not more so than other\r\nprominent men. His twenty years’ residence at Pine Ridge exhibited a\r\nquiet and gentle demeanor. He ever lamented the fate of his people, but\r\nthere was no bitterness, and his bearing was such as one might expect in\r\na man who has faced death upon the field of battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _by Rodman Wanamaker 1913_ _The Last Arrow_]\r\n\r\nAfter his removal to Pine Ridge, a petty Agent arrested this great man,\r\non a trivial charge, and confined him in the guardhouse. Immediately his\r\nwarriors armed, and a great number of Indians prepared to attack the\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nWhen some of the subchiefs after his release said, “Let us kill our\r\nwomen and children and fight until we are gone, that is preferable to\r\nstarvation here on the reservation,” he is reported to have made a\r\ndignified and manly speech, in which he maintained that the Almighty had\r\ndecreed that they should continue on the reservation, virtually as\r\nprisoners of their conquerors, and resistance would only result in\r\nsuffering and bloodshed, and could accomplish no good.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent savage, reared upon the Plains amidst surroundings not\r\ncalculated to develop other than the lowest desires, and possessing a\r\nprimitive idea of the true type of manhood, he has presented us with a\r\ncareer which shall endure in American history long after the\r\nfrontiersmen shall have been forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  War Dance\r\n\r\n  Sung by a party of Warm Spring Indians (Oregon) about 1889. A few of\r\n    these Indians traveled in the East and gave entertainments. This\r\n    song is repeated many times, rapidly.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI have no Sioux war-dance music, but the above is the most weird Indian\r\nsong ever brought to my attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              CHAPTER XIX. SITTING BULL—THE IRRECONCILABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other prominent Indians, this man presents a stern and dramatic\r\nfigure. He has been praised and censured, flattered and abhorred; called\r\nbrave by some, cowardly by others. He is an anomaly if we judge him by\r\nDepartmental standards. More properly, he typifies the Plains spirit of\r\n1840, and he was out of place in the reservation life of 1880–1890.\r\n\r\nHe bluntly told white people they lied; he refused to accept substitutes\r\nfor solemn treaties; he met falsehoods with trickery of his own. He\r\nlived and died a strong, resentful man—his hand against white\r\ndomination, even as white men’s hands were against him.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull (_Tata^nka Yota^nka_, “sitting buffalo bull”) was a noted\r\nmedicine man, or shaman, of the Sioux Indians. He belonged to the Tetons\r\nand was of the Hunkpapa division. According to the Handbook of American\r\nIndians,[33] he was born in 1834. He presents one of the most\r\npicturesque characters among all our Indians in any period of American\r\nhistory. He was called Jumping Badger as a boy and manifested a great\r\ndeal of ability in buffalo hunting in his extreme youth.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen he accompanied his father on the warpath against\r\nthe Crows, and counted his first coup on the enemy. His name (after\r\nboyhood) was Four Horn, but when he became a medicine man in 1857, his\r\nname was changed to Sitting Bull.\r\n\r\nThe Handbook presents a brief sketch, part of which I quote.\r\n\r\n“He rapidly acquired influence in his own band, being especially\r\nskillful in the character of peacemaker. He took an active part in the\r\nPlains wars of the ’60’s, and first became widely known to the whites in\r\n1866, when he led a memorable raid against Ft. Buford. Sitting Bull was\r\non the warpath with his band of followers from various tribes almost\r\ncontinuously from 1869 to 1876, either raiding the frontier posts or\r\nmaking war on the Crows or the Shoshoni, especially the former. His\r\nautographic pictorial record in the Army Medical Museum at Washington\r\nrefers chiefly to contests with the Crows and to horse-stealing. His\r\nrefusal to go upon a reservation in 1876 led General Sheridan to begin\r\nagainst him and his followers the campaign which resulted in the\r\nsurprise and annihilation of Custer’s troops on Little Big Horn River,\r\nMontana, in June. During this battle, in which 2,500 to 3,000 Indian\r\nwarriors were engaged, Sitting Bull was in the hills ‘making medicine,’\r\nand his accurate foretelling of the battle enabled him ‘to come out of\r\nthe affair with higher honor than he possessed when he went into it’\r\n(McLaughlin). After this fight the hostiles separated into two parties.\r\nSitting Bull, in command of the western party, was attacked by General\r\nMiles and routed; a large number of his followers surrendered, but the\r\nremainder of the band, including Sitting Bull himself, escaped to\r\nCanada, where they remained until 1881, when he surrendered at Ft.\r\nBuford under promise of amnesty and was confined at Ft. Randall until\r\n1883. Although he had surrendered and gone upon a reservation, Sitting\r\nBull continued unreconciled. It was through his influence that the Sioux\r\nrefused to sell their lands in 1888; and it was at his camp at Standing\r\nRock agency and at his invitation that Kicking Bear organized the Ghost\r\ndance on the reservation. The demand for his arrest was followed by an\r\nattempt on the part of some of his people to rescue him, during which he\r\nwas shot and killed. (_See page 124_). Although a chief by inheritance,\r\nit was rather Sitting Bull’s success as an organizer and his later\r\nreputation as a sacred dreamer that brought him into prominence.\r\nAccording to McLaughlin, “his accuracy of judgment, knowledge of men, a\r\nstudent-like disposition to observe natural phenomena, and a deep\r\ninsight into affairs among Indians and such white people as he came into\r\ncontact with, made his stock in trade, and he made ‘good medicine’. He\r\nstood well among his own people and was respected for his generosity,\r\nquiet disposition, and steadfast adherence to Indian ideals. He had two\r\nwives at the time of his death (one of whom was known as Pretty Plume),\r\nand was the father of nine children. His eldest son was called Louis.”\r\n\r\nThis in brief is an account of his life, but it fails to give a thorough\r\nconception of the man.\r\n\r\nHe is referred to in many of the War Department reports, between 1800\r\nand 1890. A Mr. W. F. Johnson wrote a book upon his career entitled,\r\n“The Life of Sitting Bull,” in 1891; Major McLaughlin has devoted a\r\ngreat deal of space to him, as has Mr. Mooney and others.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull’s favorite declaration which he was wont to inflict on\r\npeace commissions from Washington, is an index to the character of the\r\nman: “God Almighty made me. He never made me an agency Indian.”\r\n\r\nAttuned to this strong chord, was his whole life. He was not a pleasant\r\nman, and he incurred the dislike of his Agent, Major McLaughlin, and\r\nmany others. I do not agree with Major McLaughlin, that Sitting Bull was\r\naltogether a coward. If he had been such, we would not have found him\r\nassociated with the hostile element in the later sixties and all through\r\nthe seventies. Neither would he have opposed the authorities at the time\r\nof the Ghost dance. He knew that opposition must bring imprisonment, and\r\nprobably execution, and it did.\r\n\r\nHis boyhood, as was that of Red Cloud and other prominent Indians, was\r\nspent among his own people in the chase, about the village, and\r\noccasionally he accompanied war parties.\r\n\r\nI suppose that he was present during the Fetterman massacre in 1869, and\r\nthe fact that he is not mentioned by Colonel Carrington and other\r\nofficers does not necessarily imply that he was absent. Carrington would\r\nnaturally record the names of such Indians as he met, and Sitting Bull\r\nwas not a man to seek interviews until he became, against his will, a\r\nreservation Indian.\r\n\r\nAt the Custer fight he made the medicine. I have not presented an\r\naccount of the battle of the Little Big Horn, for the reason that\r\npractically every other writer of modern days has mentioned it at\r\nlength, and several have devoted chapters to the subject.[34]\r\n\r\nHe made the medicine for the fight, and I have understood from the Sioux\r\nat Pine Ridge that Sitting Bull sat on a hill, some distance from the\r\naction, and went through with his incantations in plain view of many of\r\nthe warriors. McLaughlin states that Sitting Bull and his family fled\r\nwhen the shooting began. Be that as it may, the success of the fight was\r\nattributed, in no small part, to the efficacy of Sitting Bull’s\r\nmedicine, and he became a great man thereafter.\r\n\r\nAfter the Custer fight the Indians separated into two parties, one soon\r\nsurrendering to the military, and the other, under Sitting Bull,\r\ncontinuing fighting. Various army officers pursued them, and Sitting\r\nBull continued his flight towards the north, to escape capture. The\r\npursuit by General Miles occupied some time and the Indians were\r\ncontinually harassed, and driven here and there, until finally they\r\nfound an asylum in Canada. Toward the close of the seventies a\r\nCommission was appointed to visit him, and persuade Sitting Bull and his\r\nfollowers to return to this country. In view of the dislike on the part\r\nof our authorities toward him, it is incomprehensible that they should\r\nseek his return. He was very abrupt in his treatment of the Commission,\r\nand publicly shook hands with Her Majesty’s representatives and declined\r\nto return to this country.\r\n\r\nHis later life was much embittered by his confinement at Fort Randall,\r\ncontrary to the promise made him.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull possessed a grim humor. He knew more of our ways than he\r\nadmitted, and always availed himself of the opportunity to get the\r\nbetter of white people. McLaughlin tells this story:—\r\n\r\n“He was not a nice character, Sitting Bull; he took what looked good to\r\nhim, whether it was a woman or property of other sort, and he was not in\r\nany sense typical of his people. I never heard that he had a\r\nlove-affair, and the measure of the man was shown when Bishop Marty\r\ntried to induce him to put away one of his wives. He went to see the\r\nBishop, who was visiting the missions. The Bishop pointed out to him the\r\nevil of his ways, and the bad influence he exerted among the people,\r\nfinally asking him if he would not put away one of his wives. Sitting\r\nBull was crafty.\r\n\r\n“‘You think that I should put away one wife and that would be good?’ he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“‘It would, and the woman would be taken care of. You should keep only\r\nyour first wife.’\r\n\r\n“‘But I cannot put one away; I like them both and would not like to\r\ntreat them differently.’\r\n\r\n“The Bishop admitted that it might be hard, but one should be put away;\r\nthe second wife.\r\n\r\n“‘But I could put them both away without injuring either one,’ said\r\nSitting Bull.\r\n\r\n“‘You could do that,’ was the reply of the good man, thinking he was\r\nmaking some headway.\r\n\r\n“‘The black gown is my friend,’ rejoined Sitting Bull, ‘and I will do\r\nthis for him; I will put away both my wives, and the black gown will get\r\nme a white wife.’\r\n\r\n“The Bishop gave him up as incorrigible, and the old chief retained both\r\nhis wives to the end.”[35]\r\n\r\nIn 1883 a Congressional Commission composed of Honorable H. L. Dawes,\r\nJohn A. Logan, Angus Cameron, John T. Morgan and George G. Vest, visited\r\nStanding Rock agency to investigate conditions. There had been great\r\ndiscontent because of the failure of the Government to fulfill the\r\nstipulations set forth in the treaty of 1808 (See pages 103–104.) Most\r\nof the Indians, while mindful of their rights, exhibited no ill will\r\ntoward the Government, although they were insistent that the cattle and\r\ngoods promised them be forthcoming and were rather against the further\r\ndivision of the reservation. After the conference had been in session a\r\nday or two, the Chairman said to the interpreter, “Ask Sitting Bull if\r\nhe has anything to say to the Committee.”\r\n\r\nThe Committee, having the services of excellent interpreters, we may\r\nassume that what followed is a literal translation of Sitting Bull’s\r\nwords. As they are very interesting, and the mind responsible for the\r\nutterance of these words was the mind of an Indian who lived in the\r\npast, I reproduce the conversation in full.\r\n\r\n  SITTING BULL: “Of course I will speak to you if you desire me to do\r\n  so. I suppose it is only such men as you desire to speak who must\r\n  say anything.”\r\n\r\n  THE CHAIRMAN: “We supposed the Indians would select men to speak for\r\n  them, but any man who desires to speak, or any man the Indians here\r\n  desire shall talk for them we will be glad to hear if he has\r\n  anything to say.”\r\n\r\n  SITTING BULL: “Do you not know who I am, that you speak as you do?”\r\n\r\n  THE CHAIRMAN: “I know that you are Sitting Bull, and if you have\r\n  anything to say we will be glad to hear you.”\r\n\r\n  SITTING BULL: “Do you recognize me; do you know who I am?”\r\n\r\n  THE CHAIRMAN: “I know you are Sitting Bull.”\r\n\r\n  SITTING BULL: “You say you know I am Sitting Bull, but do you know\r\n  what position I hold?”\r\n\r\n  THE CHAIRMAN: “I do not know any difference between you and the\r\n  other Indians at this agency.”\r\n\r\n  SITTING BULL: “I am here by the will of the Great Spirit, and by his\r\n  will I am a chief. My heart is red and sweet, and I know it is\r\n  sweet, because whatever passes near me puts out its tongue to\r\n  me;[36] and yet you men have come here to talk with us, and you say\r\n  you do not know who I am. I want to tell you that if the Great\r\n  Spirit has chosen anyone to be the chief of this country it is\r\n  myself.”\r\n\r\n  THE CHAIRMAN: “In whatever capacity you may be here today, if you\r\n  desire to say anything to us we will listen to you; otherwise we\r\n  will dismiss this council.”\r\n\r\n  SITTING BULL: “Yes; that is all right. You have conducted yourselves\r\n  like men who have been drinking whiskey, and I came here to give you\r\n  some advice.” (Here Sitting Bull waved his hand, and at once the\r\n  Indians left the room in a body).[37]\r\n\r\nA little later, some of the Indians having told Sitting Bull that he had\r\ntreated the Committee very harshly and should apologize, he appeared and\r\nmade a much longer speech. In this he asked for many things; he pointed\r\nout that the Whites were responsible for the destruction of the\r\nbuffalo—the Indians’ means of sustenance. He seemed to be aware that his\r\nspeech had caused ill feeling for his opening sentences are:—\r\n\r\n“I came in with a glad heart to shake hands with you, my friends, for I\r\nfeel that I have displeased you; and I am here to apologize to you for\r\nmy bad conduct and to take back what I said. I will take it back because\r\nI consider I have made your hearts bad. I heard that you were coming\r\nhere from the Great Father’s house some time before you came, and I have\r\nbeen sitting here like a prisoner waiting for some one to release me. I\r\nwas looking for you everywhere, and I considered that when we talked\r\nwith you it was the same as if we were talking with the Great Father;\r\nand I believe that what I pour out from my heart the Great Father will\r\nhear. What I take back is what I said to cause the people to leave the\r\ncouncil, and want to apologize for leaving myself. The people acted like\r\nchildren, and I am sorry for it. I was very sorry when I found out that\r\nyour intentions were good and entirely different from what I supposed\r\nthey were. Now I will tell you my mind and I will tell everything\r\nstraight. I know the Great Spirit is looking down upon me from above and\r\nwill hear what I say, therefore I will do my best to talk straight; and\r\nI am in hopes that some one will listen to my wishes and help me to\r\ncarry them out. I have always been a chief, and have been made chief of\r\nall the land. Thirty-two years ago I was present at councils with the\r\nwhite man, and at the time of the Fort Rice council I was on the prairie\r\nlistening to it, and since then a great many questions have been asked\r\nme about it, and I always said wait; and when the Black Hills council\r\nwas held, and they asked me to give up that land, I said they must wait.\r\nI remember well all the promises that were made about that land because\r\nI have thought a great deal about them since that time. Of course I know\r\nthat the Great Spirit provided me with animals for my food, but I did\r\nnot stay out on the prairie because I did not wish to accept the offers\r\nof the Great Father, for I sent in a great many of my people and I told\r\nthem that the Great Father was providing for them and keeping his\r\nagreements with them, and I was sending the Indians word all the time I\r\nwas out that they must remember their agreements and fulfill them, and\r\ncarry them out straight. When the English authorities were looking for\r\nme I heard that the Great Father’s people were looking for me too. I was\r\nnot lost. I knew where I was going all the time. Previous to that time,\r\nwhen a Catholic priest called ‘White Hair’ (meaning Bishop Marty) came\r\nto see me, I told him all these things plainly. I meant to fulfill, and\r\ndid fulfill; and when I went over into the British possessions he\r\nfollowed me, and I told him everything that was in my heart, and sent\r\nhim back to tell the Great Father what I told him; and General Terry\r\nsent me word afterwards to come in, because he had big promises to make\r\nme, and I sent him word that I would not throw my country away; that I\r\nconsidered it all mine still, and I wanted him to wait just four years\r\nfor me; that I had gone over there to attend to some business of my own,\r\nand my people were doing just as other people would do. If a man loses\r\nanything and goes back and looks carefully for it he will find it, and\r\nthat is what the Indians are doing now when they ask you to give them\r\nthe things that were promised them in the past; and I do not consider\r\nthat they should be treated like beasts, and that is the reason I have\r\ngrown up with the feelings I have. Whatever you wanted of me I have\r\nobeyed, and I have come when you called me. The Great Father sent me\r\nword that whatever he had against me in the past had been forgiven and\r\nthrown aside, and he would have nothing against me in the future, and I\r\naccepted his promises and came in; and he told me not to step aside from\r\nthe white man’s path, and I told him I would not, and I am doing my best\r\nto travel in that path. I feel that my country has gotten a bad name,\r\nand I want it to have a good name; it used to have a good name; and I\r\nsit sometimes and wonder who it is that has given it a bad name. You are\r\nthe only people now who can give it a good name, and I want you to take\r\ngood care of my country and respect it. When we sold the Black Hills we\r\ngot a very small price for it, and not what we ought to have received. I\r\nused to think that the size of the payments would remain the same all\r\nthe time, but they are growing smaller all the time. I want you to tell\r\nthe Great Father everything I have said, and that we want some benefit\r\nfrom the promises he has made us; and I don’t think I should be\r\ntormented with anything about giving up any part of my land until those\r\npromises are fulfilled—I would rather wait until that time, when I will\r\nbe ready to transact any business he may desire. I consider that my\r\ncountry takes in the Black Hills, and runs from the Powder River to the\r\nMissouri; and that all of this land belongs to me. Our reservation is\r\nnot as large as we want it to be, and I suppose the Great Father owes us\r\nmoney now for land he has taken from us in the past. You white men\r\nadvise us to follow your ways, and therefore I talk as I do. When you\r\nhave a piece of land, and anything trespasses on it, you catch it and\r\nkeep it until you get damages, and I am doing the same thing now; and I\r\nwant you to tell all this to the Great Father for me. I am looking into\r\nthe future for the benefit of my children, and that is what I mean, when\r\nI say I want my country taken care of for me. My children will grow up\r\nhere, and I am looking ahead for their benefit, and for the benefit of\r\nmy children’s children, too; and even beyond that again. I sit here and\r\nlook around me now, and I see my people starving, and I want the Great\r\nFather to make an increase in the amount of food that is allowed us now,\r\nso that they may be able to live.”[38]\r\n\r\nIn Sitting Bull’s speech, we have the thoughts and the desires of the\r\nnative Indian. It is the speech of a strong man. Omitting much that\r\nfollowed, I desire to state that General Logan replied in a severe\r\nmanner to Sitting Bull.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of good advice in Logan’s speech. It indicates the\r\ndomination the authorities wished to exercise over the Indians. On page\r\n82 of the report the following words occur:—“Here the interpreter said\r\nthat Two Bears desired to say a few words to the Committee, and\r\npermission was given.” This would indicate that the Committee dominated\r\nand had the right to designate such Indians as should speak, or withhold\r\npermission from those who desired to talk. Most white men’s councils are\r\nforeign to Indian methods of council. Where the white man sought to make\r\nof the council a one-sided affair, friction was quite certain to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commission did what it could for the Indians and made a\r\nvery voluminous report to Congress.\r\n\r\nThere were numberless peace conferences in the early days, and we do not\r\nlack Congressional committees at the present time, and with such an\r\nIndian as Sitting Bull, most any of them might have had trouble.\r\nMcLaughlin himself found Sitting Bull a pretty handful, and much of his\r\ndislike of the Indian is probably entirely justified.\r\n\r\nSitting Bull was never an agency Indian. He lived in the past. He was\r\ntolerant of the white man and his ways because he was compelled to\r\nsubsist on the bounty of the white man. His own son, Crow Foot, believed\r\nin his father’s medicine and died with him. Truly, greater proof of\r\nfaith could not be produced.\r\n\r\nIf Sitting Bull had been as cowardly as McLaughlin states, he would\r\nrather have surrendered. Instead, he fought his way to Canada. He would\r\nhave spent his days on the reservation, meekly accepting whatever the\r\nauthorities wished to dole out to him. But he was the incarnation of the\r\nfighting spirit of the Sioux. I think that a man possessed of the\r\nability of Sitting Bull, under different environment, would have become\r\nan Indian Bismarck. He was a man of blood and iron, and accustomed to\r\nscenes of bloodshed. He was unscrupulous—so was Bismarck—he tried to\r\nlead his followers into action; although the cause for which he fought\r\nwas well-nigh hopeless. He realized that one person cannot single-handed\r\nfight a regiment, yet he often fought when his support was meagre. He\r\nbrooded over the past greatness of his people. He saw little good in the\r\nwhite race. If we are to judge Sitting Bull by our standards, we must\r\nconsider him a “bad Indian.” If we are to analyze Sitting Bull as a\r\nSioux of the old type, a man who desires to have our Government fulfill\r\nits obligations, and having established certain Indians upon a tract of\r\nland the boundaries of which are definitely defined, expects them to\r\nlive there and enjoy peace, liberty and happiness, Sitting Bull was\r\nright. Sitting Bull could not fathom the intricacies and the duplicity\r\nof the average white man’s mind. During his stormy career, he had met\r\nmore bad than decent white men. He had faith in the medicine of his\r\nfathers, and he lived and died in that faith. He was consistent in his\r\nbelief and consistent in his hatred to the end.\r\n\r\nHe had been dissatisfied with life at Standing Rock, where those who\r\nsought to cultivate the good will of the Superintendent carried stories\r\nof his doings. Doubtless these lost none of their force in the\r\ntransmission. He could not dance, visit his relatives or friends at a\r\ndistance, because of continual espionage. To a man of strong feelings\r\nthis was intolerable and hastened the end. He believed all were against\r\nhim. “They have taken our game, our lands, our health, and now they take\r\nour religion.” Well might he have said these words—as did another\r\nprominent Indian.\r\n\r\nSo he broke his peace-pipe—deliberately. All his followers saw him. He\r\nhad kept it since his return from Canada in 1881. But now it was\r\ndestroyed. This was equivalent to saying to Washington, “I break with\r\nyou.” The word was carried to McLaughlin, and the police redoubled their\r\nwatch. The end came speedily and the curtain fell upon the last act of\r\nSitting Bull’s life.\r\n\r\nA parallel between Sitting Bull and Geronimo is easily drawn. They were\r\nnot pleasant persons. They rendered an eye for an eye and a tooth for a\r\ntooth, and by so doing they won more than did the leaders of the\r\nCalifornia, or the Chippewa bands, whose last days have been pathetic in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nThe times in which Sitting Bull lived, and the incidents surrounding him\r\nwere such as will produce an unscrupulous, crafty, and cruel man. Yet,\r\nwith all of that, we must admit that he was a great man and that the\r\nwords of his prediction were verified—he never became a reservation\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter writing this chapter, the proofs were sent to my friend Dr.\r\nEastman. His reply is interesting.\r\n\r\n                                        AMHERST, MASS., SEPT. 30, 1914\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Moorehead:\r\n\r\n  I have read with interest your chapter on Sitting Bull. You are\r\n  right in believing that he was present at the Fetterman fight. In\r\n  regard to the Custer fight, I have carefully compared many stories\r\n  of Indians who were there, including several of my own relatives.\r\n  Sitting Bull did not run away, neither was he “making medicine” at\r\n  the time. He was on the Reno side of the fight at the first, and\r\n  later, when Custer appeared, was heard in a loud voice urging the\r\n  young men to be steady, etc. Most certainly I agree with you that he\r\n  was no coward, and do not agree with Major McLaughlin in his\r\n  estimate of Sitting Bull’s character. According to all my\r\n  researches, he was no medicine man, but a statesman, one of the most\r\n  far-sighted we have had, and as such I have represented him in my\r\n  study of his career, which has not yet been published. In his early\r\n  days, he won distinction as a warrior. After he came in from Canada,\r\n  his character was ruined by the humiliation to which he was\r\n  subjected, followed by his exhibition all over this country and\r\n  Europe by “Buffalo Bill,” and being lionized and his photographs and\r\n  autographs sold, etc. Then he was brought back to the agency and\r\n  again humiliated, and crushed by the Agent until he was both spoiled\r\n  and embittered. The weakest thing he ever did was to take up the\r\n  Ghost dance craze, which led to his death.\r\n\r\n  As to Red Cloud’s warriors, it must be remembered that the number of\r\n  Indians engaged in a fight with U. S. troops is nearly always\r\n  exaggerated in the military reports. They have no means of counting\r\n  the warriors, and their estimates are more than liberal, for obvious\r\n  reasons. At the Custer fight, for example, not more than 1,400\r\n  warriors were probably present.\r\n\r\n  You are welcome to use any or all of this letter in your book. I\r\n  wish to say that I like the tone of your work very much and agree\r\n  with most of what you say. I do not desire to idealize Sitting Bull,\r\n  but what he did, and the conditions of the period, and the Indians’\r\n  own estimate of him at the time, will tell their own story. It is\r\n  not the story of an Indian Agent, or an Indian on the reservation\r\n  who is very apt to say things to soothe the savage white man’s ear\r\n  for the favor he may receive.\r\n\r\n                                       Yours sincerely,\r\n                                           CHARLES A. EASTMAN\r\n                                                             (OHIYESA)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Jackson’s “Century of Dishonor,” page 183.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Report 1890, page 49; 1891, pages 125,\r\n  410.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Handbook, Vol. II. p. 583.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Consult Writings of Doctor Eastman, Doctor Joseph K.

EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after 1850, it became apparent to our authorities that education\r\nof Indians was the most important service that our Government could\r\nrender them. Pursuing this policy, schools and appropriations, both\r\ngovernmental and sectarian (as well as nonsectarian) have increased\r\nuntil most of the Indians have been, or are, in school. I have referred\r\non page 25 to the Honorable Commissioner’s report in which there are but\r\n17,500 Indian children listed as out of school.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this tremendous activity on the part of all these good\r\npeople, has had an effect on the entire Indian body. If there have been\r\nretrogressions, it is not the fault of the educational system. This\r\nshould be understood in the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe subject is so comprehensive that this entire volume could be devoted\r\nto its consideration. But we must needs confine our observations to two\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nBetween 1850 and 1875 the education of Indian children was confined to\r\nvarious missionary and philanthropic organizations. Indians could avail\r\nthemselves of collegiate education in the East, notably at Dartmouth\r\nCollege, which was founded for the education of Indian youth. But there\r\nseems to have been no systematic, or persistent attempt to educate\r\nIndians until 1879, when Captain R. H. Pratt, U. S. A., began the\r\neducation of Indian boys and girls. In September that year, the Carlisle\r\nbarracks were transferred by the War Department to the Interior\r\nDepartment for Indian school purposes. By the end of October, General\r\nPratt gathered together 136 Indians. The number steadily increased; in\r\n1905 there were about a thousand; and at the present time the school\r\ncares for, during the course of a year, something like 1200 pupils. This\r\nremarkable school had up to 1905 admitted 5,170 Indians. Early in\r\nGeneral Pratt’s administration, an outing system was inaugurated. Most\r\nof the boys and girls were placed in families of prosperous citizens of\r\nPennsylvania, New York or Massachusetts during the summer months. This\r\nbrought them in direct contact with the best elements of the white race\r\nand served a double purpose. It not only taught them industry and proper\r\nmethods of living, but brought home to the youth of both sexes the vast\r\ndifference between the life of white citizens in Massachusetts,\r\nPennsylvania, New York, New Jersey or elsewhere, and the frontier\r\nelement with which so many of the Indians had come in contact. This does\r\nnot necessarily imply that all persons living near Indian reservations\r\nwere undesirable citizens. It means that entirely too many white persons\r\nby their example did not impress the Indian with any respect for the\r\nwhite race, and that such individuals set a very low standard. This\r\nfeature of Indian (or white) life has had a tremendous effect on the\r\nIndians. Other writers have not emphasized its importance, and its\r\npernicious effect. Beyond question the fact that the Indians came in\r\ncontact with those who were not “substantial citizens,” as we understand\r\nthe term, is responsible for many evils, and a general lack of progress,\r\nand a widespread inclination to accept merely the veneer of our\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pratt’s plans, therefore, were not only sound, but of great\r\nbenefit in the uplifting of the race. Other schools have followed the\r\nexcellent example set by Carlisle, and it is now pretty generally\r\nrecognized that the Indian youth must be made to realize that the\r\nmajority of American citizens are not of the type of the Indian trader,\r\nthe grafter, the squaw-man, etc.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations presented throughout this and the succeeding chapter\r\nwill give an idea of the various activities followed at Carlisle,\r\nChilocco, Haskell and other schools.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pratt remained in charge of Carlisle for about twenty-five\r\nyears, when he was succeeded by Major William A. Mercer, who was\r\nreplaced a few years ago by Mr. Moses Friedman. The present\r\nsuperintendent in charge, Oscar H. Lipps, Esq., has had years of\r\nexperience in the Indian Service, and is maintaining the high standard\r\nestablished by General Pratt and followed through the administrations of\r\nhis successors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DR. CHARLES A. EASTMAN, SIOUX (OHIYESA)\r\n\r\n  Educated at Dartmouth. Writer and Lecturer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor some years there was a leaning in this school toward the higher\r\neducation of Indians, but that policy was not carried to any extent and\r\nneed not be referred to in detail here. It is now recognized that the\r\nschools and colleges of the United States afford abundant opportunity\r\nfor any Indian who is sufficiently bright, and has the energy and\r\ndetermination to win scholastic honors. It is neither necessary nor\r\nadvisable that the Government should attempt the higher education of\r\nIndians. Most of the successful Indians today were originally trained in\r\nGovernment schools, and such as exhibited marked ability, left what\r\nmight be termed secondary schools and entered colleges. There occurs to\r\nme at this moment Henry Roe Cloud, a Sioux, who graduated from Yale a\r\nfew years ago; Doctor Charles A. Eastman, a distinguished author and\r\nlecturer, Dartmouth; Charles E. Dagenett, Supervisor of Employment,\r\nUnited States Indian Service, who graduated from Eastman Business\r\nCollege; Arthur C. Parker, State Archaeologist of New York, Albany, who\r\nstudied under Professor Putnam of Harvard; Rev. Sherman Coolidge,\r\nArapaho, graduate of Hobart College and Seabury Divinity School; Dr.\r\nCarlos Montezuma, Apache, University of Illinois; Howard E. Gainsworth,\r\nTuscarora, business expert, Princeton; Rev. Frank W. Wright, Revivalist,\r\nChoctaw, graduate of Union College; Doctor Olephant Wright, Choctaw,\r\nUnion College; Miss Bee Mayes (Pe-ahm-ees-queet), Ojibwa, educated in\r\nBoston, musician; Louis Shotrige, Chilkoot, Chief of his tribe,\r\ngraduated from the University of Pennsylvania; Nicholas Longfeather,\r\nPueblo, inventor and tree doctor, graduated from Syracuse; Marvin Jack,\r\nTuscarora, horticulturalist, Cornell; Rev. Philip B. Gordon, Chippewa,\r\npriest, graduate of St. Paul’s; Mrs. Marie L. Baldwin, Chippewa, lawyer,\r\ngraduate of Washington College of Law; Dennison Wheelock, Oneida,\r\nlawyer, Dickinson College; Thomas St. Germain, Chippewa, business, Yale;\r\nJohn M. Oskison, Cherokee, newspaper business, Harvard; William F.\r\nBourland, Chickasaw, lawyer, graduate of Berkley; Asa F. Hill, Mohawk,\r\nminister, Denison; Francis La Flesche, Omaha, author; Angel\r\nDeceva-Deetz, Winnebago, artist; Zit-kal-a-sa, Sioux, writer; Elmer La\r\nFouso, California, singer; Tscawina Redfeather, Creek, singer; Jeff. D.\r\nGoulett, Sioux, politician; Gabe E. Parker, Choctaw, Registrar of the\r\nTreasury, Washington; Charles D. Carter, Cherokee, Congressman; F. E.\r\nParker, Seneca, business expert in New York City.\r\n\r\nThese all availed themselves of advantages other than those afforded by\r\nthe Government schools. There is no reason why many Indians should not\r\noccupy high positions and become distinguished citizens. I include\r\nHonorable Senator Robert L. Owen and one or two people serving in\r\nCongress, although in them the white blood predominates. My list is\r\nconfined to those in whom Indian blood is in excess of white, with two\r\nor three exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe plant at Carlisle has been extended year after year until there are\r\nat present fifty buildings. There are upwards of one hundred\r\ninstructors, clerks, and other employees.\r\n\r\nCarlisle produced the first newspaper printed by Indian boys. This, _The\r\nIndian Helper_, became in later years _The Red Man_. The Indians are\r\ntrained in every conceivable industry necessary to the welfare of Indian\r\nmen and women. The following trades are taught in well-equipped\r\nbuildings: tailoring, carpentry, blacksmithing, wagon-making, printing,\r\ndairying, stock-raising, general agriculture, gardening, engineering,\r\nirrigation, brick-laying, plumbing, etc. There is also a shoe shop, tin\r\nshop, paint shop, etc.\r\n\r\nThere is instruction in music, and the Carlisle military band is a\r\nfeature of the parades and entertainments. There is a gymnasium, and\r\noutdoor recreation, exercises and athletics have had a beneficial effect\r\non the student body. The football and baseball teams, as well as the\r\ntrack squad, have made Carlisle a formidable rival of Harvard, the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Mercersburg and numerous colleges and\r\nschools. The famous athlete, James Thorpe (_See page 39_), was trained\r\nat Carlisle and at the time of the Olympic games in Stockholm, was\r\nawarded first prize as the ranking athlete in the world. The sturdy\r\nfootball eleven has on more than one occasion been pitted against the\r\nbest football material produced by Harvard, and the West Point eleven,\r\nduring the annual fall contests. Apropos of these games an interesting\r\nstory was told me by an interpreter in Minnesota. He had played on the\r\nCarlisle eleven many years ago. At that time most of the team was\r\ncomposed of Ojibwa (Chippewa) with a few Sioux and other Indians,\r\npractically all of whom understood more or less of the Ojibwa language.\r\nThe signals were, of course, called out by numbers, but during one of\r\nthe plays, the quarterback became confused. The play was misunderstood\r\nand the opponents gained. He became angry, dropped his numerical system\r\nand called out to the other players in Ojibwa what they should do. The\r\nsucceeding play was a success and from that until the end of the game,\r\nthe quarterback called out his signals in Indian, and the game was won.\r\n\r\nIn all schools girls are trained in the domestic arts, and this covers\r\nevery conceivable duty connected with home-life. Both boys and girls are\r\nthoroughly grounded in primary education which includes the common\r\nbranches, and a sufficient training in the handling of moneys and\r\naccounts, the buying and selling of produce, and general mercantile\r\naffairs to enable them to cope with the white people in managing their\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of Carlisle is also applicable to the great Chilocco school\r\nin Oklahoma. Chilocco Indian School was established May 17, 1882, and\r\nopened January 15, 1884, with 123 pupils from Kiowa, Comanche and\r\nWichita, and Cheyenne and Arapaho Agencies.\r\n\r\nThe school is located at Chilocco, Oklahoma, and was established\r\nprimarily for the Poncas and Pawnees and other Indians of Oklahoma,\r\nexclusive of the Five Civilized Tribes. However, the student body has\r\nfor years included youth from all parts of the country, and since 1910\r\nrestricted numbers of the Five Civilized Tribes have been admitted. W.\r\nJ. Hadley was the first superintendent. A dozen other men held this\r\noffice, and April, 1911, Edgar A. Allen, Esq., was appointed, and still\r\nremains. The school, under his management, has done excellent work.\r\n\r\nThe maximum attendance at any one time at this school during the past\r\nyear was 561 and the total attendance 692. Since the school was\r\nestablished in 1884 it is impossible to tell how many students have gone\r\nthrough it, but it is likely that the number would not be fewer than\r\n5000.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the non-reservation schools conducted by the Government,\r\nthere is the school at Hampton, Virginia, where both colored and Indian\r\nyouths are trained. The Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute was\r\nestablished in 1868 by General C. S. Armstrong. After ten years of\r\nsuccess in training negroes, Indians were included. Since that time\r\nabout 1500 boys and girls have been trained at this place. It is stated\r\nthat five-sixths of them are industrious and are a credit to the\r\ninstitution. The academic course covers four years. There are normal\r\ncourses, and business, agriculture, and the trades. In connection with\r\nthe school there is a stock farm of 600 acres, together with a model\r\nfarm, dairy, orchards, poultry yards, gardens, etc. The equipment is\r\nabout sixty buildings. The Government pays $167 a year for each of its\r\n120 Indian pupils. There never has been any discrimination against the\r\nIndian on account of his color. This is seen in many of our Eastern\r\ninstitutions where Indian boys are received on the same footing as\r\nWhites. But there is a feeling against the negro—not a feeling of\r\nhostility, but a general disinclination to associate with him on terms\r\nof equality. That is seen in some of the schools. The negro is received\r\nas a student, but not as a social equal. I have always thought that the\r\nmixing of negroes and Indians at Hampton was unnecessary. Hampton is not\r\na Government school, but is maintained by private subscription and the\r\nGovernment pays a certain sum per pupil for Indians who are there\r\neducated. The system has worked satisfactorily, and Hampton has turned\r\nout many excellent and worthy graduates. But it would be better, it\r\nseems to me, if the Indians and the negroes were educated in separate\r\nschools, just as today we do not consider it advisable to educate Whites\r\nand negroes in the same school. At Harvard University, colored students\r\nare admitted, and in the classes and through the general University\r\nlife, there is no discrimination made against them, and they are on an\r\nabsolute equality with the white students. But in the real life of the\r\nworld there is a line drawn between them, and no man or woman can blind\r\nhimself or herself to this fact.\r\n\r\nThe association of Indians and negroes in Oklahoma has not helped the\r\nIndian, and a careful study of the situation there would lead one to\r\nsuggest that the policy be discontinued in the best interests of both\r\nthe races. The union of the negro and the white is not to the advantage\r\nof either, and it is even more true of negro-Indian marriages, according\r\nto my way of thinking.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the boarding-school and the non-reservation school did\r\nnot entirely supply the needs of the Indians, and so was organized the\r\nday school. Mr. Leupp, who made a great improvement in the\r\nadministration of day schools, hit the nail on the head when he stated:—\r\n\r\n“To me the most pathetic sight in the world is a score of little red\r\nchildren of nature corralled in a close room, and required to recite\r\nlessons in concert and go through the conventional daily programme of\r\none of our graded common schools. The white child, born into a home that\r\nhas a permanent building for its axis, passing most of its time within\r\nfour solid walls, and breathing from its cradle days the atmosphere of\r\nwholesale discipline, is in a way prepared for the confinement and the\r\nmechanical processes of our system of juvenile instruction. The little\r\nIndian, on the other hand, is descended from a long line of ancestors\r\nwho have always lived in the open and have never done anything in mass\r\nroutine; and what sort of antecedents are these to fit him for the\r\nbodily restraints and the cut-and-dried mental exercises of his period\r\nof pupilage? Our ways are hard enough for him when he is pretty well\r\ngrown; but in his comparative babyhood—usually his condition when first\r\ncaptured for school purposes—I can conceive of nothing more trying.\r\n\r\n“My heart warmed toward an eminent educator who once told me that if he\r\ncould have the training of our Indian children he would make his\r\nteachers spend the first two years lying on the ground in the midst of\r\nthe little ones, and, making a play of study, convey to them from the\r\nnatural objects right at hand certain fundamental principles of all\r\nknowledge. I dare say that this plan, just as stated, would be\r\nimpracticable under the auspices of a Government whose purse-strings are\r\nslow to respond to the pull of any innovation. But I should like to see\r\nthe younger classes in all the schools hold their exercises in the open\r\nair whenever the weather permits. Indeed, during the last year of my\r\nadministration I established a few experimental schoolhouses, in regions\r\nwhere the climate did not present too serious obstacles, which had no\r\nside-walls except fly-screen nailed to studding, with flaps to let down\r\non the windward sides in stormy weather.”[39]\r\n\r\nThe day schools, for the most part, are of simple construction. The\r\nteachers’ quarters are built adjoining, or the teacher occupies the ell\r\nor detached cottage. There is usually attractive land large enough for a\r\ngarden. Except in the northern reservations, the day schools are more or\r\nless open-air affairs. In many of them the children are provided with a\r\nluncheon at noon. Among the poorer Indians, the school luncheon\r\nfurnished by the Government constitutes the only substantial meal the\r\nIndian children receive. Most observers agree that boys and girls six to\r\nthirteen years of age should not be separated from their homes during\r\nthe entire year. The day school surrounds the children during school\r\nhours with a wholesome environment and encourages them to work at home\r\nin the field and garden and promotes real education, culture and\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nThe boarding-schools on reservations were considered by Mr. Leupp to be\r\nan anomaly in the American educational system. He aptly states:—\r\n\r\n“They furnish gratuitously not only tuition, but food, clothing,\r\nlodging, and medical supervision during the whole period for which a\r\npupil is enrolled. In other words, they are simply educational\r\nalmshouses. Nay, though ostensibly designed to stimulate a manly spirit\r\nof independence in their beneficiaries, their charitable phase is\r\nobtrusively pushed forward as an attraction, instead of wearing the\r\nbrand which makes the almshouse so repugnant to Caucasian sentiment.\r\nThus is fostered in the Indian an ignoble willingness to accept unearned\r\nprivileges; from learning to accept them he gradually comes to demand\r\nthem as a right; with the result that in certain parts of the West the\r\nonly conception his white neighbors entertain of him is that of a beggar\r\nas aggressive as he is shameless. Was ever a worse wrong perpetrated\r\nupon a weaker by a stronger race?”[40]\r\n\r\nThe boarding-schools have somewhat changed their character, and they are\r\ncertainly reduced in numbers since Mr. Leupp’s administration. His\r\nsuccessor, Honorable Robert G. Valentine, recommended their restriction,\r\nand the present administration has still further curtailed them. The day\r\nschools are far preferable, also are the non-reservation schools.\r\nIndians who are exceptionally bright need not attend reservation\r\nboarding-schools, but will find opportunity to study under better\r\nconditions elsewhere; like Eastman at Dartmouth; Roe Cloud at Yale.\r\n\r\nOf Indian education at the present time there is little criticism to be\r\noffered. The tendency seems to be toward agricultural training with a\r\nsufficient grounding in primary and secondary education to enable the\r\npupils to write intelligent letters, keep accounts and become familiar\r\nwith American history, etc. This is all that need be expected of the\r\nGovernment schools, and advanced learning may be obtained in the\r\ncolleges.\r\n\r\nWhile all this is true, we must record, that in the early years of\r\nIndian education grievous mistakes were made. These have had their\r\neffect on the Indian body at large. Chief among these were the contract\r\nschools established years ago by act of Congress. These were schools\r\nlocated either on the reservations and known as boarding schools, or at\r\na distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CLASS IN AGRICULTURE JUDGING CORN, CHILACCO INDIAN SCHOOL\r\n]\r\n\r\nYears ago, when the Government was pushing allotting and educating of\r\nIndians to the exclusion of pretty much everything else, there sprang up\r\na pernicious system, which I am happy to say has been abolished. Schools\r\nwere erected in a number of localities, and agents were sent hither and\r\nthither to gather Indian pupils. The Government allowed quite a sum of\r\nmoney per head for the support and education of these Indian children. I\r\nhave forgotten whether it was $200 or $400 per capita, but it was quite\r\na sum. One of the reasons tuberculosis and trachoma became so prevalent\r\nwas on account of these schools and the crowding of the children into\r\nsmall quarters. The more children, the larger financial returns to those\r\nconducting the school. Extensive enrollments were regarded with great\r\nfavor at Washington and so, the system continued to expand until the\r\nGovernment officials awakened to its distressing effect.\r\n\r\nHonorable O. H. Lipps, supervisor in charge of the United States Indian\r\nSchool, Carlisle, writes me regarding these contract schools as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“Referring further to the inquiry in your former letter, I might add\r\nthat when I took charge of the contract boarding-schools in the Five\r\nCivilized Tribes four years ago, I found in some of those schools\r\nconditions that were almost shocking. For instance, in the school near\r\nOkmulgee, Oklahoma, not only were two and three sleeping in one bed, but\r\nthe beds were double-deckers and pupils were packed in almost like\r\nsardines in a can. The same was true in some of the other schools. It is\r\nneedless to state, however, that this condition was immediately remedied\r\nso that those schools are now among the best boarding-schools we have in\r\nthe service. The contract system was abolished and the superintendents\r\nare now bonded officers and under the direct supervision of the Indian\r\nOffice.”\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to go into details, and we should not blame the\r\nauthorities at Washington. The whole matter of education was largely an\r\nexperiment; and mistakes must needs be made.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the tuberculosis and trachoma is, beyond question, due\r\nto the crowding in these schools. There is absolutely no excuse for such\r\nsystem and it is surprising that it continued as long as it did. The\r\nfact that children came home from these schools to die, or to become\r\npermanently disabled, had a deterring effect on the Government’s\r\neducational policy. It was quite natural that Indian parents did decline\r\nto send their children to school under such conditions. No white parent\r\nwould send his son or daughter to a school if by so doing that child\r\ncontracted disease. Yet we were expecting the Indian to cheerfully\r\naccept a scheme of education which we would not countenance among\r\nourselves for a moment.\r\n\r\nI have tried to ascertain the number of children sent away to school who\r\ncame home and died. It has been impossible to secure any reliable\r\nstatistics. Miss Caroline W. Andrus of the Indian Record Office, Hampton\r\nNormal and Agricultural Institute, under date of September 2d, 1911,\r\nwrites me that:—\r\n\r\n“The death rate was high among our Indians for the first few years, but\r\nno physical examination was then required before they left their homes,\r\nand a good many died within a few weeks or months after they arrived.\r\nHomesickness probably had a good deal to do with it, but some were\r\ncertainly far gone with tuberculosis when they reached here. Any\r\nstatistics we might get together would be for so small a number that I\r\nthink they would be useless, particularly as we have never used large\r\ndormitories, but have an average of two students in a room, and\r\ntherefore no over-crowding.”\r\n\r\nIn a table of statistics presented in a later chapter will be observed\r\nthat under Question IV, “In your opinion has there been a high\r\npercentage of deaths among children suffering from tuberculosis sent\r\nfrom schools to their homes the past ten years?” we addressed a great\r\nmany persons, including teachers, and asked their opinion. Many of these\r\ncan give no accurate information, having been recently appointed. Others\r\nthink that the death rate has not been very high, whereas others claim\r\nthat many Indians returned from school merely to die from consumption or\r\nto become blind from trachoma. It would have surprised all of us, I\r\nthink, could statistics be compiled with any degree of accuracy. For\r\ninstance, during the long period that Carlisle has been maintained, it\r\nwould be illuminating to place before the public in tabulated form how\r\nmany of the Indians are living and how many have died. Charles F.\r\nLummis, Esq., of California, who has devoted a great many years to the\r\nstudy of Indian problems, is of the opinion that in the early years of\r\nour educational system we made almost as many consumptives as educated\r\nIndians. He has uttered this opinion in several of his articles in past\r\nyears. Be that as it may, at present the physicians in charge of the\r\nschools and physicians on the reservations are doing all humanly\r\npossible to end this evil.\r\n\r\nBut the opposite still obtains in some quarters. We have been properly\r\nambitious to keep the schools free from disease and we have promptly\r\nsent to their homes children who are not strong or healthy, with the\r\nresult that disease was disseminated on the reservations. While this was\r\ngood for the school, it was very bad for those who lived at home.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  The Indian and his Problem, page 126.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Leupp, page 137.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. WHY SOME INDIANS OBJECT TO SENDING CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, AND\r\n                     FURTHER COMMENTS ON EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is not a white parent of intelligence in America who would send\r\nchildren to school if in that school there was danger from disease. When\r\nCornell had a small epidemic of typhoid fever, the institution was\r\nclosed; the same is true of Milton Academy when a few pupils were taken\r\nwith scarlet fever. Phillips Academy, at Andover, closed its doors some\r\nyears ago when less than four per cent of the student body became\r\naffected with measles. Yet in past years these Indian schools have\r\ncontinued in the even tenor of their way, including among their\r\nmembership children suffering from some form of tuberculosis or\r\ntrachoma. I observed that with my own eyes in Minnesota in 1909.\r\n\r\nYou cannot expect the Indian—who is just as human as we are ourselves—to\r\nwax enthusiastic over education when such intolerable conditions obtain.\r\nAll the Indian knows is that the child comes home sick, and he having no\r\nfacilities for proper treatment, unless the child’s constitution is\r\nunusually strong, the child dies or is disabled.\r\n\r\nRight here I wish to pay a tribute to one of the leading Sioux, Chief\r\nWhite Horse. He said: “I sent my own boy to school first, as an example\r\nto the others. I sent my children to a nearby school until they were old\r\nenough, and then I was one of the first to send them to Hampton,\r\nVirginia, to school. They all came home and died of consumption.”[41]\r\n\r\nWhile we all believe in education, yet I affirm that there is neither a\r\nman nor a woman in all America who would willingly, and gladly, send one\r\nchild after another to a school so managed that the children contracted\r\ntuberculosis and died. The average white man and woman would refuse to\r\nsend other children to such a school, after the first one had died; and\r\na system of education productive of consumptives, would be indignantly\r\ndenounced in unmeasured terms. President Lincoln wrote a beautiful\r\nletter to Mrs. Bixby, when she gave to her country five sons who were\r\nkilled in battle during the Civil War. Mrs. Bixby was a white woman, and\r\nof some education. Lincoln’s letter to her is celebrated in the United\r\nStates. Poor old White Horse was an untutored Indian, and yet his faith\r\nin the white man and his ways rose to sublime heights. He deserves a\r\nplace among the heroes of peace. In return for his simple trust, we\r\nmurdered his sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nThere has been a wide diversity of opinion among persons as to the\r\nwisdom of our general educational policy for Indians. This is not\r\nconfined to those employed by the Interior Department, who serve as\r\nSuperintendents and teachers. It is more largely shared by missionaries\r\nand other observers.\r\n\r\nMany of the persons who furnished me with data for my table of\r\nstatistics also wrote out their views at considerable length. These are\r\nvaluable in that they are sincere; they come from men and women who are\r\nin direct contact with the people. We will omit all those who agree with\r\nour present policy. It may be summed up thus: to give the Indians\r\nvocational training; to ground them in the rudiments and to make of them\r\nfarmers, mechanics, carpenters, stockmen, lumbermen, weavers, etc.,\r\nrather than to attempt to fit so many of them for higher callings. It is\r\nwell to consider the opinions of several persons residing in separate\r\ncommunities in the great West, and I herewith append their statements,\r\nbut omit the names of the writers.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to make one more remark. As far as I can see, the fact that\r\nthe condition of the Indians is not satisfactory is due largely to the\r\nnature of the education provided for them. I think that the education\r\ngiven them is too high and far above their condition in life. It seems\r\nto me to be an attempt to make them leap from the bottom to the top rung\r\nof the ladder of civilization without having them touch those that lie\r\nbetween. They are not yet far enough advanced in civilization and\r\nculture to enable them to follow successfully the higher pursuits of\r\ncivilized social life, against which the present educational methods try\r\nto put them. Thus when leaving school, they are unable to compete with\r\nWhites of equal education, while they are unwilling and often\r\nunqualified to take up farming or mechanics.”\r\n\r\nNaturally they all will have to work for a living, and the proper and\r\nonly occupation that would make them self-supporting will be farming or\r\nother manual labor. But having passed ten or more years at Carlisle,\r\nHampton, etc., and coming home to the reservation, serious work is no\r\nlonger to their liking. Playing and spending money for amusement is\r\nabout the only thing they know and care for. If they get a position in\r\nthe Indian Service, they get along as long as they are able to hold it.\r\nBut the day they are discharged for any reason, they join the army of\r\ngrumblers and idlers, and help to raise the howl—the Indians are\r\ncheated, robbed and trodden under foot.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, as long as they go to school they are coddled and furnished\r\nwith everything, as only children of well-to-do parents are in a\r\nposition to enjoy. Then when they are finished, so that they have to\r\nstand on their own feet and make their own living, they are not able to\r\ndo it. Whatever has been used for their education is worn, then thrown\r\naway. It has been used to spoil and enervate them, has made honest work\r\nhateful to them, has certainly not fitted them for the task of earning\r\nan honest livelihood suited to their condition of life.\r\n\r\n“It is my opinion that a thorough eighth-grade common school education\r\nalong with a good training in industrial and economic habits would bring\r\nfar more satisfactory results. It would be more suited to their present\r\nstage in their advancement towards civilization, they would then more\r\neasily take to farming and other general work, and train them to be\r\nself-supporting. This would fill out the gap, which men have been trying\r\nto bridge over by forcing an intellectual education upon semi-barbaric\r\nIndian children. This is, however, not saying that a higher education\r\nshould be denied to those that show inclination, talent and character\r\nfor advancement.”\r\n\r\n                                       Correspondent, Keshena, Wisconsin\r\n\r\n“The white people will not allow the Indian children to go to the\r\ncountry schools. The Indians in some places have no schools for their\r\nown children, and are left without any opportunity to give their\r\nchildren the ordinary, elementary education of a grammar school. In two\r\nplaces under our care here the circumstances are as stated above.\r\n\r\n“What the Indians want is a public Government school. If you have any\r\ninfluence and can rouse the Government to action in this matter, I wish\r\nyou would use your influence. You would be doing a good work.\r\n\r\n“The Indian children do better when educated near home. The children\r\nwant to remain near home; and the parents also like to have them at\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\n                                        Correspondent, Ukiah, California\r\n\r\nThe next letter is from a full-blood Indian. Some of the sentences are a\r\ntrifle ambiguous. I know the man to be one who labors under\r\ndisadvantages. He is doing a good work among his more ignorant fellows.\r\n\r\n“Any Superintendent will say that, let a discovery of oil be made upon\r\nany child’s land and that boy or girl rises in distinction, develops\r\nrelatives, friends, and a fond guardian at an alarming rate. Then one of\r\nthe first moves, after this discovery, is to take the child from school.\r\nThey can’t bear that the searchlight of learning be turned into the\r\nblack corners of their schemes. The situation in Oklahoma is indeed\r\nalarming! I believe there are more lawyers and land men in Eufaula than\r\nin any other little town outside the State, in the United States, and we\r\nknow they have acquired and are acquiring, fortunes at the expense of\r\nthe benighted Indian and his allotments.\r\n\r\n“In time the ‘benighted Indian’ will be spoken of in the past tense. The\r\nrich Indian in this locality is truly an object of pity. The weight of\r\nhis fortune, the world of uncertainty, indecision and fear in which he\r\nlives, is pitiable indeed. If the Indian is sagacious at all, it has to\r\nbe brought out by the slow process of education and this ‘drawing out’\r\nprocess is worse than the ‘pouring in’. Eternal vigilance and a world of\r\npatience, all tempered with common sense and good judgment, are the\r\ntools with which to work against this grafting, and schools, schools.\r\nThese institutions should be continued indefinitely. As an illustration\r\nto the fact that the Creek tribe is waking to the possibilities these\r\nschools afford—our capacity is 125 and I venture to say we could have\r\nenrolled 300. It was pitiful to turn them away, yet our files were\r\nclosed early in August!”\r\n\r\n                                        Correspondent, Eufaula, Oklahoma\r\n\r\n“Those educated away from the reservation have too much done for them to\r\nmake life a pleasure—they learn and see the easy side of life and the\r\nmethods by which it can be obtained easily—but when they return home the\r\npicture is not so alluring, and when they find that they must depend\r\nupon themselves they also realize that they did not learn how to depend\r\nupon themselves, and they as a rule give up and go back to the old\r\nIndian life more or less, and in the majority of cases altogether.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion Indian Agents should have full control of their Agencies\r\nand Indians in order to push their people to the front. Indians like men\r\nwho can do things, but in so many cases the Agent must go to higher\r\nauthority and this delay has a bad effect in most cases. The Agent\r\nshould be strictly responsible to the Commissioner for his action—there\r\nshould be frequent and searching inspections of his work and if it is\r\nfound wanting, he should be removed.”\r\n\r\n                                       Correspondent, Anadarko, Oklahoma\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  IMPROVED INDIAN HOME IN THE SOUTHWEST\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne correspondent living in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, writes at length\r\nconcerning the immorality in Indian schools ten years ago. Happily, such\r\nthings are not possible at the present time. A number of correspondents\r\nhave referred to most distressing moral conditions (in past years) in\r\ncertain schools. It is incomprehensible that such conditions should have\r\nbeen permitted to obtain. The effect on the children was exceedingly\r\nbad, as it is impossible to keep such things a secret, especially in\r\ncommunities where two or three hundred persons are assembled together.\r\nThere are statistics available on this unpleasant subject, although I\r\nshall not refer to them. Suffice it to say that because immorality was\r\nnot prevented in past years, we cannot expect a high moral tone among\r\nall Indians. Too many of them have profited to their own detriment, by\r\nthe bad example set them.\r\n\r\nWhile these are varied and present a diversity of opinion as to detail,\r\nthey strike at the greater evil. Far too many of our Indians on\r\nreturning from such schools as Carlisle are inclined to look for\r\nclerkships or occupations in towns, and are not willing to perform tasks\r\nrequiring hard labor. They moved along the paths of least resistance.\r\nThis does not apply to all, but quite a number of them, which gives rise\r\nto the popular conception that educated Indians will not work. There is\r\nalso another problem to be considered. The Indian comes home and he\r\nfinds that he does not regard the community and people as he did\r\nprevious to his education. His case may be compared with the son of a\r\nsmall farmer in one of the eastern states, who, given advantages of a\r\nhigher education, comes home without determining in his own mind what he\r\nshall do and is dissatisfied with his surroundings. Formerly, the farm,\r\nthe home life and the neighborhood did not appear to him to bespeak a\r\nsmall and narrow world. He feels himself out of his environment. He\r\nbecomes dissatisfied. Such young white men become failures in life. It\r\nis similar with the Indians. He has seen all that is best in the East,\r\nand his eyes are opened to the poverty and the dull monotony of\r\nreservation, or Indian community life. Unless he is willing to put his\r\nhand to the plow and work for his living, he is pretty apt to fall into\r\nways of idleness, to draw inheritance money, or annuity, or sell a piece\r\nof land. One of the problems in Indian education is to overcome this. It\r\nis, to a great extent, due to the Indian himself, as one of the most\r\ncompetent workers in the United States Indian Service has pointed out.\r\nMrs. Elsie E. Newton in answering my circular at length says:—\r\n\r\n“For success in their home environment, the Indian educated at or near\r\nhome is better qualified, if the training has been good in itself. If\r\nhighly trained away from home, it is more difficult, just as in the case\r\nof Whites, to adapt themselves to home environment, the conservatism of\r\nthe old and a difficult economic state, or to struggle against such\r\nconditions where he should.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to all that has been said on the preceding pages, it must be\r\nremembered that there is yet another reason why some of the educated\r\nIndians do not progress as satisfactorily as we would desire. And this\r\nlatter is, perhaps, the most significant of all. With such, it is, it\r\nseems to me, after due deliberation, due to the impression that after\r\nall, our civilization holds little for the Indian. He has lost faith in\r\nus and in our institutions. This statement, let me repeat, applies only\r\nto the educated Indians who have been trained, or have been told year\r\nupon year what to do and how to do it, but still persist in the old\r\nways. This also has a direct bearing on the greater question, the lack\r\nof progress in the entire Indian body; for education, property, health,\r\ncitizenship and all the rest are but a part of this great problem. I\r\nshall further discuss it in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the long bibliography on Indian education presented in\r\nthe Handbook of American Indians, there are quite a number of articles,\r\nspeeches and reports mentioned in the following brief bibliography which\r\nstudents of educational problems among Indians will do well to consult.\r\nThese cover, in a general way, all phases of education, although in the\r\ngeneral references, in the chapters on agriculture, irrigation and\r\nindustries, there are many references which might apply to general\r\neducation.

THE DESERT INDIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nArizona, New Mexico and southern California, together with portions of\r\nNevada and Texas, were inhabited by the Yuman, Piman and Athapascan\r\nstocks. I have devoted an entire chapter to the Navaho, and shall\r\nconfine this to the Pima, Papago, Pueblo and Apache.\r\n\r\nThe past fifty years the population of these Indians has not varied to\r\nany appreciable extent. The enumeration of 1906 indicates that there are\r\nabout as many Pimas and Apaches as at the present time, although the\r\nPapago have increased.\r\n\r\nThese tribes are desert Indians, pure and simple. The Pima and the\r\nPapago present many characteristics in common, and remain long in the\r\nsame locality; the chief difference being that they belong to totally\r\ndistinct linguistic stocks. The Apaches, however, are far more nomadic\r\nin character, not given to agriculture, and were never known to\r\nconstruct irrigation ditches to any extent, and beyond raising a few\r\nvegetables and a little corn on restricted tracts, were not given to\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe chapter of our dealings with the Apaches is one of the bloodiest,\r\nconsidering the small number of persons engaged on each side, in\r\nAmerican history. Notwithstanding much said against them, they were not\r\nbeyond the pale of civilizing influences. Many of the outbreaks could\r\nhave been prevented, but our policy toward these Indians was vacillating\r\nand short-sighted.\r\n\r\nDoctor F. W. Hodge of the Smithsonian Institution, long a student of\r\nIndians in the Southwest, presented a sketch of the Apaches in the\r\nHandbook of American Indians.[42] This covers their complete history. I\r\nhere insert portions relating to Apache history the past sixty years. It\r\nwill be observed that the Apaches were frequently located on\r\nreservations, but because of change in management, or friction, or\r\nincompetency on our part, they were compelled to flee, and such flights\r\nwere merely to better their condition.\r\n\r\n“No group of tribes has caused greater confusion to writers, from the\r\nfact that the popular names of the tribes are derived from some local or\r\ntemporary habitat, owing to their shifting propensities, or were given\r\nby the Spaniards on account of some tribal characteristic; hence, some\r\nof the common names of apparently different Apache tribes or bands are\r\nsynonymous, or practically so; again, as employed by some writers, a\r\nname may include much more or much less than when employed by others.\r\nAlthough most of the Apache have been hostile since they have been known\r\nto history, the most serious modern outbreaks have been attributed to\r\nmismanagement on the part of civil authorities. The most important\r\nrecent hostilities were those of the Chiricahua under Cochise, and later\r\nVictorio, who, together with 500 Mimbrenos, Mogollones, and Mescaleros,\r\nwere assigned, about 1870, to the Ojo Caliente reserve in W. N. Mex.\r\nCochise, who had repeatedly refused to be confined within reservation\r\nlimits, fled with his band, but returned in 1871, at which time 1,200 to\r\n1,900 Apache were on the reservation. Complaints from neighboring\r\nsettlers caused their removal to Tularosa, 60 m. to the N.W., but 1,000\r\nfled to the Mescalero reserve on Pecos r., while Cochise went on another\r\nraid. Efforts of the military agent in 1873 to compel the restoration of\r\nsome stolen cattle caused the rest, numbering 700, again to decamp, but\r\nthey were soon captured. In compliance with the wishes of the Indians,\r\nthey were returned to Ojo Caliente in 1874. Soon afterward Cochise died,\r\nand the Indians began to show such interest in agriculture that by 1875\r\nthere were 1,700 Apache at Ojo Caliente, and no depredations were\r\nreported. In the following year the Chiricahua reserve in Arizona was\r\nabolished, and 325 of the Indians were removed to the San Carlos agency;\r\nothers joined their kindred at Ojo Caliente, while some either remained\r\non the mountains of their old reservation or fled across the Mexican\r\nborder. This removal of Indians from their ancestral homes was in\r\npursuance of a policy of concentration, which was tested in the\r\nChiricahua removal in Arizona. In April, 1877, Geronimo and other\r\nchiefs, with the remnant of the band left on the old reservation, and\r\nevidently the Mexican refugees, began depredations in S. Arizona and N.\r\nChihuahua, but in May 433 were captured and returned to San Carlos. At\r\nthe same time the policy was applied to the Ojo Caliente Apache of New\r\nMexico, who were making good progress in civilized pursuits; but when\r\nthe plan was put in action only 450 of 2,000 Indians were found, the\r\nremainder forming into predatory bands under Victorio. In September 300\r\nChiricahua mainly of the Ojo Caliente band, escaped from San Carlos, but\r\nsurrendered after many engagements. These were returned to Ojo Caliente,\r\nbut they soon ran off again. In February, 1878, Victorio surrendered in\r\nthe hope that he and his people might remain on their former\r\nreservation, but another attempt was made to force the Indians to go to\r\nSan Carlos, with the same result. In June the fugitives again appeared\r\nat the Mescalero agency, and arrangements were at last made for them to\r\nsettle there; but, as the local authorities found indictments against\r\nVictorio and others, charging them with murder and robbery, this chief,\r\nwith his few immediate followers and some Mescaleros, fled from the\r\nreservation and resumed marauding. A call was made for an increased\r\nforce of military, but in the skirmishes in which they were engaged the\r\nChiricahua met with remarkable success, while 70 settlers were murdered\r\nduring a single raid. Victorio was joined before April, 1880, by 350\r\nMescaleros and Chiricahua refugees from Mexico, and the repeated raids\r\nwhich followed struck terror to the inhabitants of New Mexico, Arizona,\r\nand Chihuahua. On April 13, 1,000 troops arrived, and their number was\r\nlater greatly augmented. Victorio’s band was frequently encountered by\r\nsuperior forces, and although supported during most of the time by only\r\n250 or 300 fighting men, this warrior usually inflicted severer\r\npunishment than he suffered. In these raids 200 citizens of New Mexico,\r\nand as many more in Mexico, were killed. At one time the band was\r\nvirtually surrounded by a force of more than 2,000 cavalry and several\r\nhundred Indian scouts, but Victorio eluded capture and fled across the\r\nMexican border, where he continued his bloody campaign. Pressed on both\r\nsides of the international boundary, and at times harassed by United\r\nStates and Mexican troops combined, Victorio finally suffered severe\r\nlosses and his band became divided. In October, 1880, Mexican troops\r\nencountered Victorio’s party, comprising 100 warriors, with 400 women\r\nand children, at Tres Castillos; the Indians were surrounded and\r\nattacked in the evening, the fight continuing throughout the night; in\r\nthe morning the ammunition of the Indians became exhausted, but although\r\nrapidly losing strength, the remnant refused to surrender until\r\nVictorio, who had been wounded several times, finally fell dead. This\r\ndisaster to the Indians did not quell their hostility. Victorio was\r\nsucceeded by Nana, who collected the divided force, received\r\nreinforcements from the Mescaleros and the San Carlos Chiricahua, and\r\nbetween July, 1881, and April, 1882, continued the raids across the\r\nborder until he was again driven back in Chihuahua. While these\r\nhostilities were in progress in New Mexico and Chihuahua, the Chiricahua\r\nof San Carlos were striking terror to the settlements of Arizona. In\r\n1880 Juh and Geronimo with 108 followers were captured and returned to\r\nSan Carlos. In 1881 trouble arose among the White Mountain Coyoteros on\r\nCibicu cr., owing to a medicine-man named Nakaidoklini, who pretended\r\npower to revive the dead. After paying him liberally for his services,\r\nhis adherents awaited the resurrection until August, when Nakaidoklini\r\navowed that his incantations failed because of the presence of Whites.\r\nSince affairs were assuming a serious aspect, the arrest of the prophet\r\nwas ordered; he surrendered quietly, but as the troops were making camp\r\nthe scouts and other Indians opened fire on them. After a sharp fight\r\nNakaidoklini was killed and his adherents were repulsed. Skirmishes\r\ncontinued the next day, but the troops were reinforced, and the Indians\r\nsoon surrendered in small bands. * * * *\r\n\r\n“In March, 1883, Chato with twenty-six followers made a dash into New\r\nMexico, murdering a dozen persons. Meanwhile the white settlers on the\r\nupper Gila consumed so much of the water of that stream as to threaten\r\nthe Indian crops; then coal was discovered on the reservation, which\r\nbrought an influx of miners, and an investigation by the Federal grand\r\njury of Arizona on Oct. 24, 1882, charged the mismanagement of Indian\r\naffairs on San Carlos res. to local civil authorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PIMA HOME, ARIZONA\r\n\r\n  Aboriginal house type.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Gen. G. H. Crook having been reassigned to the command, in 1882 induced\r\nabout 1,500 of the hostiles to return to the reservation and subsist by\r\ntheir own exertions. The others, about three-fourths of the tribe,\r\nrefused to settle down to reservation life and repeatedly went on the\r\nwarpath; when promptly followed by Crook they would surrender and agree\r\nto peace, but would soon break their promises. To this officer had been\r\nassigned the task of bringing the raiding Apache to terms in cooperating\r\nwith the Mexican troops of Sonora and Chihuahua. In May, 1883, Crook\r\ncrossed the boundary to the headwaters of the Rio Vaqui with 50 troops\r\nand 163 Apache scouts; on the 13th the camp of Chato and Bonito was\r\ndiscovered and attacked with some loss to the Indians. Through two\r\ncaptives employed as emissaries, communication was soon had with the\r\nothers, and by May 29, 354 Chiricahua had surrendered. On July 7 the War\r\nDepartment assumed police control of the San Carlos res., and on Sept. 1\r\nthe Apache were placed under the sole charge of Crook, who began to\r\ntrain them in the ways of civilization, with such success that in 1884\r\nover 4,000 tons of grain, vegetables, and fruits were harvested. In\r\nFeb., 1885, Crook’s powers were curtailed, an act that led to conflict\r\nof authority between the civil and military officers, and before matters\r\ncould be adjusted half the Chiricahua left the reservation in May and\r\nfled to their favorite haunts. Troops and Apache scouts were again sent\r\nforward, and many skirmishes took place, but the Indians were wary and\r\nagain Arizona and New Mexico were thrown into a state of excitement and\r\ndread by raids across the American border, resulting in the murder of 73\r\nwhite people and many friendly Apache. In Jan., 1886, the American camp\r\nunder Capt. Crawford was attacked through misunderstanding by Mexican\r\nirregular Indian troops, resulting in Crawford’s death. By the following\r\nMarch the Apache became tired of the war and asked for a parley, which\r\nCrook granted as formerly, but before the time for the actual surrender\r\nof the entire force arrived the wily Geronimo changed his mind and with\r\nhis immediate band again fled beyond reach. * * * *\r\n\r\n“Being a nomadic people, the Apache practised agriculture only to a\r\nlimited extent before their permanent establishment on reservations.\r\nThey subsisted chiefly on the products of the chase and on roots\r\n(especially that of the maguey) and berries. Although fish and bear were\r\nfound in abundance in their country they were not eaten, being tabooed\r\nas food. They had few arts, but the women attained high skill in making\r\nbaskets. Their dwellings were shelters of brush, which were easily\r\nerected by the women and were well adapted to their arid environment and\r\nconstant shifting. In physical appearance the Apache vary greatly, but\r\nare rather above the medium height. They are good talkers, are not\r\nreadily deceived, and are honest in protecting property placed in their\r\ncare, although they formerly obtained their chief support from plunder\r\nseized in their forays.”\r\n\r\nOf the other Indians in the southwest there are some 3800 Yuma, 4,000\r\nPima and nearly 6,000 Papago.\r\n\r\nThese three bands occupy the lower Colorado basin. At one time they\r\nconstructed extensive irrigation ditches and raised large crops. The\r\nhistory of the Pimas has been set forth at length by Mrs. Jackson and\r\nMr. Humphrey.\r\n\r\nAs the country settled up, white settlers appropriated the water from\r\nthe Gila, Salt and other streams and these Indians were much reduced.\r\nMany of them became paupers. The larger portion of the Papago left their\r\nancient homes and located on the public domain, seeking only to be\r\nremoved from white persons.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of all other Indians, the Government has established\r\nschools, and Agents, Superintendents, physicians, and employees may be\r\nfound wherever there are a considerable number of Indians congregated\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt became known that the very existence of the Pima and the Papago, as\r\nwell as the Yuma, was threatened because of the changed conditions, the\r\ninflux of Whites, and the haste on our part to make of these Indians\r\ncitizens in the full sense of the word. Water is the very life of all\r\ndesert Indians. With white people appropriating the bulk of it, very\r\nlittle was left for the Indians. Hence various irrigation schemes were\r\nset on foot. It would be very interesting to discuss how that we have\r\nimproved their condition and made available a large acreage in some\r\nplaces, yet in others we carelessly sank wells deep into alkali-bearing\r\nground and thus ruined unnumbered acres; but space forbids discussion of\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Indian Commissioners late last year, through its Chairman,\r\nHonorable George Vaux, Jr., commissioned Rev. William H. Ketcham,\r\nDirector of Catholic Missions, and Rev. Samuel A. Eliot, President of\r\nthe Unitarian Association, and both members of our Board, to visit these\r\nvarious Indians and recommend what should be done for them. Their\r\nfindings were published in pamphlet form, but merit wider circulation. I\r\nherewith append their remarks on the Papago.\r\n\r\n“_Land._ Approximately 5,000 Papago Indians are living, as they have\r\nlived since they were first known to history, on the public domain in\r\nPima and Pinal Counties. They are an industrious and self-supporting\r\npeople and maintain the habits of life that have been theirs for many\r\ngenerations. They know no other home than the desert and are able to\r\nsustain life under conditions which would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, for white people. These Indians on the public domain are\r\nmore or less nomadic, moving from two to four times each year from their\r\nfarms in the valleys to the ranges on the foothills. They are scattered\r\nin some fifty or sixty small villages over a vast tract of desert and\r\nmountain country. On their farms, which they break out of the desert\r\nwherever water can be obtained, they raise two crops a year, in summer\r\nraising beans, peas, squashes, melons and corn, and in winter wheat and\r\na little barley. Each family or village owns some cattle, horses and\r\nmules. Their tribal customs are good and the habits of family life,\r\nwhile exceedingly primitive, are excellent. The Franciscan Fathers have\r\nfor some time maintained missions and a few schools among these nomadic\r\nPapagoes and the Presbyterian Board of Missions has also several chapels\r\nand schools in the chief villages.\r\n\r\n“These Papagoes on the public domain have no title whatsoever to the\r\nlands where they have made their homes from time immemorial The desert\r\nnature of their country is such that thus far they have had little\r\ncontact with white settlers. The time is, however, fast approaching when\r\nthe better parts of the land which they occupy will be desired by white\r\nsettlers or prospectors. A railroad project, the Tucson-Ajo Railroad,\r\nhas already put a survey through the Santa Rosa Valley for the purpose\r\nof transporting the output of the Ajo Mines in Southern Arizona to\r\nmarket and opening the country to settlement. If this project is\r\ncompleted it will mean the coming of Whites into this territory and\r\ninevitably imperil the continued occupation by the Indians of the\r\nirrigable lands. In order to preserve the rights of these people it is\r\nour judgment that a number of Executive Order Reservations drawn upon\r\nlines to be recommended by the Department of the Interior should at once\r\nbe made. The reservations should contain the lands adjacent to the\r\nvillages which are needed for farming and grazing purposes and\r\nsufficient sources of water supply for irrigation, stock and domestic\r\nuse. The village sites and the water sources should be held in common.\r\nThe allotments heretofore made to Indians upon the public domain should\r\nthen be cancelled where actual residence has not been established. Any\r\ndelay will greatly imperil the character and prospects of these\r\nself-sustaining Indians, who have never had any trouble with white men,\r\nand who deserve the sympathy and protection of the Government.\r\n\r\n“An almost equally urgent situation exists on the Papago Reservation\r\nitself. The Indian population on the reservation is mostly centered\r\nabout the Agency at San Xavier. This is the only part of the reservation\r\nwhere there is water. The remainder is arid and uninhabitable. These\r\nIndians are also self-supporting and well governed by their own tribal\r\nlaws and chiefs. Their farms are productive, wherever water can be\r\nsecured, and they have good habits, so long as they remain beyond the\r\nevil influences of the neighboring city. Their continued welfare is\r\nobviously dependent upon the supply of water. The Tucson Farms Company\r\nhas acquired practically all the land between the Agency and the City of\r\nTucson, and is opening this land for cultivation. The Farms Company also\r\nowns the land bordering the reservation on the east and a considerable\r\ntract to the south of the reservation. There is naturally some conflict\r\nas to the water rights between the Farms Company and the Indians. The\r\nwelfare of the City of Tucson can evidently be promoted by increasing\r\nthe agricultural productiveness of the land held by the Farms Company\r\nand the plans by which the Farms Company hopes to encourage settlement\r\nare well-devised, but it must be borne in mind that the Indians, who\r\nhave lived at San Xavier for many generations, have the prior claim upon\r\nthe water supply. It is hoped and expected that there is in the Santa\r\nCruz Valley enough water for both the Indians and the incoming white\r\nsettlers, but the utmost vigilance will be necessary to protect the\r\nrights of the Indians to the water which is absolutely essential to\r\ntheir well-being.\r\n\r\n“The trust patents under which most of the Indians near the Agency hold\r\ntheir allotments will expire in the course of the next two or three\r\nyears. The officers of the Farms Company evidently expect at that time\r\nto acquire title to the Indian lands together with any improvements\r\nwhich the Indians or the Indian Service may have made. It is much to be\r\nfeared that the Indians will too readily yield to this temptation to\r\nsell their lands. We earnestly recommend that these trust patents be\r\nextended and the Indians thus protected. It appears that the lines of\r\nthe original allotments were badly surveyed, and the present fences or\r\nboundaries of the Indian allotments do not conform to the survey. If,\r\ntherefore, an Indian should sell his allotment, he will very probably be\r\nselling the land occupied by the homestead of another Indian. We\r\nrecommend, therefore, that new allotments be made to the Papago Indians\r\nliving at San Xavier, and that trust patents be dated from the time of\r\nthe new allotment. By the adoption of this plan not only the lines of\r\nthe allotments will be correctly adjusted, but also the Indians will be\r\nprotected in the possession of their lands.\r\n\r\n“We understand there is litigation pending between the Government and\r\nthe Tucson Farms Company in regard to the title to the Berger Ranch at\r\nSan Xavier. The Agency offices and residence have always been located in\r\nthe buildings of this ranch and it is obvious that the Government must\r\nown and control the property. The suit should be pressed to settlement\r\nand title established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _by Rodman Wanamaker 1913_ _The Voice of the Water\r\nSpirits_]\r\n\r\n“_Irrigation._ The plans for the irrigating of the Indian land at San\r\nXavier have been well studied and the report of the Superintendent of\r\nIrrigation is on file at the Indian Bureau (Senate Document No. 973, 62d\r\nCongress, 3rd Session). We recommend the adoption of the plan there\r\nsuggested, but only if the trust patents can first be extended. In other\r\nwords, it is obviously undesirable for the Government to expend a\r\nconsiderable sum of money for irrigating Indian lands which in the\r\ncourse of two years may become the property of the Tucson Farms Company.\r\nIt is true that better irrigation will increase the value of the Indian\r\nlands and the Indians will secure more for their property than they\r\notherwise would, but it is to be feared that this increase in price will\r\nsimply accrue to the benefit of the saloon keepers at Tucson and other\r\npersons eager to prey upon the Indians. In order to save these\r\nself-respecting, industrious and peaceful Indians from demoralization\r\nand vagabondage, we earnestly recommend: (1) The extension of the trust\r\npatents under which they now hold their lands, and (2) the prompt\r\nadoption and carrying out of the plans by which they will obtain an\r\nadequate and reliable supply of water.\r\n\r\n“_Schools._ The Government maintains only two small day schools for the\r\nPapagoes, whether living on the reservation or upon the public domain. A\r\nfew elementary schools are also maintained by the Catholic and\r\nPresbyterian Missions. It is not necessary for the Government to\r\nduplicate these schools. They cannot, however, reach more than a small\r\nproportion of the school population. Without further and more careful\r\nsurvey of the best centers of population, we do not wish to recommend\r\nthe establishment of any considerable number of Government day schools.\r\nThey will naturally be established where permanent water supplies can be\r\ndeveloped. We believe, however, that provisions should at once be made\r\nfor the opening of day schools at the villages known as Indian Oasis and\r\nCoyote, which are natural centers of population within the proposed new\r\nExecutive Order Reservations. We understand that plans have already been\r\nformed for the establishment of the first of these schools.\r\n\r\n“_Health._ The health conditions among the Papagoes are not different\r\nfrom those on other Indian reservations. There is a great deal of\r\ntuberculosis and trachoma, and there are no hospital provisions\r\nwhatever. We earnestly recommend the establishment of field hospitals at\r\nSan Xavier and at Indian Oasis. These hospitals should be of slight\r\nconstruction, but they are greatly needed for the welfare of the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n“_Liquor._ The Indians living on the Papago Reservation and on the\r\npublic domain seem to be well protected because of their remoteness from\r\nwhite settlements, their own good habits, the vigilance of the Agency\r\nofficers, and the influence of the missionaries. The Indians living near\r\nTucson, Casa Grande or Maricopa are much more exposed to temptation and\r\nare too often demoralized and vicious.\r\n\r\n“_Native Industries._ It is highly desirable that the Papagoes should be\r\nencouraged both in the industries by which they have always sustained\r\nthemselves and also in the arts which they practice. They are remarkably\r\nsuccessful desert cultivators. They have more to teach Whites about\r\ndesert farming than the Whites can teach them. Nevertheless, there are\r\ncertain methods of farming which can be brought to their attention by\r\nskilful and tactful Government farmers, and we commend the present\r\nactivity of these officers. In particular the Indians can be helped in\r\nthe use and conservation of water, and in the securing of water for\r\ndomestic purposes apart from its use for stock. The Superintendent of\r\nIrrigation has now at his disposal a small appropriation which he is\r\nusing to discover and develop new sources of water supply and in\r\nteaching the Indians to separate their own drinking-water from the water\r\nused for the stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN BUILDINGS OF RECENT CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n  On an allotment near Wewoka, Okla.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The Papago Indians are at present a primitive, but self-supporting\r\npeople. The Government does very little for them. Their livelihood is\r\nnow seriously threatened. A failure on the part of the Government to\r\nprotect them in their land and water rights, will be most disastrous.\r\nThe Indians will become homeless outcasts and a menace to all southern\r\nArizona. There is abundant evidence to justify the conviction that\r\nneglect of the Papagoes at this time will result in the corruption and\r\ndegradation of these worthy Indians, and write another chapter of\r\ndisgrace in the history of our dealings with our Indian wards. Now,\r\nbefore irreparable harm is done, is the time to act. An ounce of\r\nprevention now, will be worth pounds of cure later. To prevent the\r\nthreatening abuse, to protect these deserving Indians and to promote\r\ntheir permanent welfare, it is necessary; 1st, To establish Executive\r\nOrder Reservations on that part of the public domain where some 5000\r\nPapagoes have always made their homes, and provide for their efficient\r\nadministration. 2nd, To extend the trust patents of the Indians holding\r\nallotments at San Xavier and provide for the adequate irrigation of\r\ntheir lands. 3rd, To establish schools at Indian Oasis and Coyote, and\r\nhospitals at San Xavier and Indian Oasis.”\r\n\r\nThe Pueblos present a very interesting spectacle. Living as they do in a\r\nnumber of stone and adobe villages, carrying on a highly developed\r\ncommunistic life, practicing ceremonies the like of which does not exist\r\nelsewhere in America, if anywhere in the world—they have been the\r\nsubject of numerous ethnological investigations. Mrs. Matilda Stevenson\r\npublished a volume through the Bureau of American Ethnology relating to\r\nthe ethnology of these strange folk. The late Frank Hamilton Cushing\r\nlived for years in Zuni Pueblo, was adopted, mastered the language,\r\njoined the secret society, and presented us with a great deal of\r\nvaluable and technical information. After Cushing’s death, Doctor J.\r\nWalter Fewkes spent years in studying the various Pueblos. Mr. Charles\r\nL. Owen of the Field Museum, Chicago, and other investigators have\r\napproached the subject from various angles. We have, all told, a score\r\nof books relating to the life and beliefs of the Pueblos; their famous\r\nsnake dance has been repeatedly described until it would seem that not a\r\nsingle detail has escaped publication. Others have concerned themselves\r\nwith Pueblo arts, the origin of the Pueblo and the relation between the\r\nPueblo and the Cliff Dweller. Few tribes in America have been more\r\nthoroughly studied, and it is safe to say that the various departments\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution, the past thirty years, have published\r\n5,000 or more pages relating to these people. As the peculiar customs\r\nare handed down from antiquity, we shall study them in detail at some\r\nfuture time and adhere to our rule of confining this book to the modern\r\nPueblo. The following report submitted by Messrs. Eliot and Ketcham is\r\nself-explanatory and covers their activities, their needs, and warns us\r\nagainst the dangers with which they are threatened.\r\n\r\n“_Land._ The primary need of all the Pueblos is for a determination of\r\nthe boundaries of their grants. The encroachment of squatters on the\r\nIndian lands is constantly increasing and producing friction and\r\nlitigation. These trespassers are not always blameworthy because the\r\nlimits of the Indian lands are so indistinct. There is urgent need of\r\nsurveys and of definite marks or bounds with indestructible monuments.\r\nWhen these have been established, vigorous action should be taken for\r\nthe eviction of trespassers who have not established a legal right to\r\noccupancy. We earnestly recommend an appropriation for the immediate\r\nsurvey of all the Pueblo grants.\r\n\r\n“We recommend an Act of Congress prohibiting any Pueblo Indian from\r\nselling land. Such an Act will prevent endless misunderstandings and\r\nlitigation. All the land problems of the Pueblos would be settled by\r\naccepting the proposal of the Indians to place all their lands in trust\r\nwith the Department of the Interior. We believe this proposed course of\r\naction to be wise and just.\r\n\r\n“The liquor question is at the front in nearly every pueblo. Illegal\r\nselling and bootlegging are very prevalent and as a rule public opinion\r\namong the Indians does not condemn the use of liquor. In spite of the\r\nvigilance of the officers of the Government bad whiskey is demoralizing\r\nmany of these Indians. The efforts of the Superintendents and their\r\npolicemen for the suppression of this traffic should be heartily\r\nsupported by the Indian Office and the superintendents should be\r\nauthorized to employ additional policemen.\r\n\r\n“The prosecution and punishment of land thieves and liquor sellers put a\r\nvery heavy burden upon the attorney for the Indians. We particularly\r\ncommend the able, alert and disinterested service of Mr. Francis C.\r\nWilson, who with very small resources has been remarkably successful in\r\nprotecting the Indians and punishing those who would rob or degrade\r\nthem. We earnestly recommend that his salary be put at $3,000 and that\r\nat least $1,000 be allowed him for the prosecution of the suits now\r\npending.\r\n\r\n“We commend the good sense, vigor and assiduity of Superintendents\r\nPerry, Lonergan, Coggeshall and Mr. Snyder. They understand these\r\nIndians and without pampering or pauperizing them have their real\r\ninterests at heart.\r\n\r\n“_Irrigation._ Owing to the sandy nature of the soil of the Rio Grande\r\nValley the seepage from the irrigation canals is excessive. We recommend\r\nthat the canals at Isleta and Laguna, where conditions are particularly\r\nbad, be concreted. A reservoir is urgently needed at Taos.\r\n\r\n“_Health._ In spite of pernicious inbreeding and unsanitary conditions\r\nthe health of the Pueblos is comparatively good. Instruction is needed\r\nin elementary sanitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SOUTHERN UTE, COLORADO\r\n\r\n  Modern Indian pictographs in the rear. 1902. Photograph by E. R.\r\n    Forrest.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“_Education._ While heartily commending the work and efficiency of the\r\nboarding schools at Albuquerque and Santa Fe, we are clearly of the\r\nopinion that the best education for these Indians can be obtained in the\r\nday schools. Boarding schools are well adapted to nomadic Indians, but\r\nthe Pueblos have always lived in permanent villages and the best schools\r\nfor them are the day schools in or immediately adjoining the villages.\r\nThe new day schools are well planned, but there is urgent need of more\r\nof them. The school accommodations at Isleta are a disgrace to the\r\nGovernment. They are unsafe and unsanitary and there is not room for\r\nhalf the children of school age. New school buildings should also be\r\nprovided at Acoma, Acomita and Encinal. A farmer is greatly needed to\r\ngive agricultural instruction at Isleta and Laguna. The needs of the\r\nboarding schools have been sufficiently set forth in the recommendations\r\nof the superintendents. We especially commend the application for\r\nappropriations to buy additional land at Albuquerque and to build a\r\ndairy barn at Santa Fe.\r\n\r\n“We recommend the applications of Superintendents Lonergan and\r\nCoggeshall for additional policemen, and for authority to hire laborers\r\nwhen needed. It is absurd to have to request a physician to milk the cow\r\nor for a superintendent to personally have to carry the chain for his\r\nsurveyors.\r\n\r\n“The training of the Pueblo Indians for life in a civilized environment\r\nmust be slow. Their inherited habits and customs are exceedingly rigid\r\nand their prejudices are stubborn. The educated or progressive Indians\r\namong them have now a very hard road to travel. They need not only moral\r\nsupport, but sometimes actual physical protection. The superintendents\r\nshould be encouraged tactfully but firmly to break up the personal\r\ndespotism which often rules the villages, to protect the right of the\r\nindividual to personal liberty, to insist upon the gradual adaptation of\r\nthe pueblo life to its new environment. The Pueblos are now in a\r\ntransition stage. They cannot pass through it without some bitter\r\nfeelings and some hard experiences. They need the consistent,\r\nsympathetic, courageous leadership of their guardians, in whose good\r\nintentions they are beginning to trust.”\r\n\r\nIn closing the chapter on the desert Indians I desire to suggest that\r\nthe older Pueblos be permitted to continue their weaving and\r\npottery-making in their own way. It is perfectly proper to train the\r\nyoung in our arts, but the superb native arts of the old Indians should\r\nbe encouraged. With the death of these old people, the art will\r\ndeteriorate and disappear. I mention this particularly for the reason\r\nthat several well-meaning, but misguided persons sent one or two\r\nrepresentatives to Zuni and attempted to instruct the women in the\r\nmanufacture of pottery. They even persuaded them to glaze the pottery\r\nand to make tiles. The movement, if continued on a large scale, would\r\nresult in ruining an art which is fast disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe population is about stationary. The ceremonies of the antelope and\r\nsnake societies are becoming more and more public. Recent photographs of\r\nthem show hundreds of white persons, teams and automobiles, and\r\nadmission is now charged, for the dances and attendant ceremonies are\r\nfast becoming commercialized. They have persisted because of the curious\r\nlife of these people—a people who live, as it were, in a different\r\nworld. With the extension of education, the allotment system, and the\r\ncontinual effort of Government employees to break down the old and\r\ninsert the new, the real life of the Pueblos will soon pass away\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  Vol. I. pages 63–66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CHAPTER XXIII. THE CAREER OF GERONIMO\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fighting man was for many years feared and hated. He was not a\r\ndocile person, and his tribe did not tamely submit to kicks and\r\ncurses—the treatment meted out to his more gentle red brothers in\r\nCalifornia and Arizona. They were despised, trodden under foot, cast\r\naside; not so with the Apaches and Geronimo. It required more than two\r\nyears’ labor on the part of hundreds of our cavalry to catch him, and\r\nwhen he surrendered there were but seventy-four in his band.\r\n\r\nNow that everything regarding the Indian is being made public, I deem it\r\nimportant that the true history of Geronimo be set forth.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 this chief published the story of his life. His book is a\r\nremarkable production, and gives the Indian point of view, which is rare\r\nindeed.[43]\r\n\r\nMr. Barrett, who wrote the story at Geronimo’s dictation, had much\r\ntrouble with the War Department. Officers objected to the narrative, and\r\nhe was compelled to secure permission from President Roosevelt. Even\r\nthen the War Department advised against publication.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Apaches dates from the time of Coronado, who is\r\nsupposed to have penetrated their country in 1541–’43 when he marched\r\nnorth in search of the fabled “seven cities of Cibola.” There is no\r\nrecord of the Apaches, or any other Indians for that matter, beginning\r\nhostilities against the Spaniards. After Coronado, the Spaniards and the\r\nApaches were at war for three centuries. The Spaniards pursued their\r\nusual policy in dealing with these people, and the latter returned an\r\neye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. Geronimo and his people had\r\nabundant cause for their hatred of the Spaniards. It was a different\r\nstory in Arizona and northern Mexico from that of California and central\r\nMexico. Today the California Indians are paupers, and the gentle Aztecs\r\nhave long since perished, but the sturdy Apaches remain and live in more\r\nor less prosperity on their several reservations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GERONIMO\r\n\r\n  Photographed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, about 1905\r\n]\r\n\r\nGeronimo says he was born in Arizona in 1829.[44] On the death of his\r\nfather, Mangus-Colorado became chief of the Bedonkoke Apaches, to which\r\nband the subject of this sketch belonged. When a half-grown boy,\r\nGeronimo assumed the care of his mother, and in 1846 he joined the\r\ncouncil of the warriors. Soon after this he married Alope and three\r\nchildren were born during the next few years. In 1858, when he was\r\ntwenty-nine, his band went into Mexico to trade. One afternoon while\r\nGeronimo and the other men were returning from a visit, they were met by\r\ncrying women and children who told them that the Mexicans had attacked\r\nthe camp—a peaceful camp—and had massacred the men and most of the women\r\nand children. Geronimo lost his aged mother, his wife and his three\r\nsmall children.\r\n\r\nThey decided to retreat to Arizona and as the Mexicans were searching\r\nfor survivors in order to kill them, the remaining Apaches traveled all\r\nnight. The mourning period, according to Indian etiquette, prevented\r\nGeronimo, who had lost more relatives than anyone else, from eating or\r\nspeaking. He traveled two days and three nights without food and did not\r\nopen his mouth until the third day. I quote from his book:—\r\n\r\n“Within a few days we arrived at our own settlement. There were the\r\ndecorations that Alope had made—and there were the playthings of our\r\nlittle ones. I burned them all, even our tipi. I also burned my mother’s\r\nlodge and destroyed all her property.\r\n\r\n“I was never again contented in our quiet home. True, I could visit my\r\nfather’s grave, but I had vowed vengeance upon the Mexican troopers who\r\nhad wronged me, and whenever I came near his grave or saw anything to\r\nremind me of former happy days, my heart would ache for revenge upon\r\nMexico.”\r\n\r\nThe Apaches collected arms and supplies. Geronimo visited other bands of\r\nhis tribe, and in the summer of 1859, a year later, a large force (on\r\nfoot) entered Old Mexico. They went light, and without horses, for\r\nstrategic reasons. Knowing the country thoroughly—every water-hole,\r\nmountain and valley—they could trail unobserved. On horseback they must\r\nfollow certain known trails, whereas on foot the band could scatter,\r\ntravel singly and meet at a common rendezvous. It was well-nigh\r\nimpossible to follow unmounted Apaches, as all the military reports\r\nadmit. They invariably scattered and sought the most inaccessible,\r\nwaterless mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nGeronimo acted as guide, and near Arispe eight men came out from the\r\nvillage and were killed by the Apaches. The next day the Mexican troops\r\nattacked. Geronimo says that in one part of the field four Indians,\r\nincluding himself, were charged by four soldiers and in the final fight,\r\ntwo of the Indians were killed and the four troopers were slain, two of\r\nthem by Geronimo himself.\r\n\r\nThe art of trailing was developed among the Apaches and Comanches more\r\nthan among other Indians on this continent. Possibly a few Delawares\r\nmight be excepted. The success of Geronimo’s operations, as well as\r\nthose of his able lieutenants, Cochise, Naiche, Mangus-Colorado, was\r\nchiefly due to the fact that the trail was to them an open book. As an\r\nillustration of the skill of the desert Indians in this respect, I would\r\ncite the case of Pedro Espinosa, who, when nine years old was captured\r\nby the Comanche and for years lived with the Comanches and Apaches.\r\nColonel Dodge says of him that he was a marvel even to the Indians\r\nthemselves, and relates this incident:\r\n\r\n“I was once sent in pursuit of a party of murdering Comanches, who had\r\nbeen pursued, scattered, and the trail abandoned by a company of\r\nso-called Texas rangers. On the eighth day after the scattering,\r\nEspinosa took the trail of a single shod horse. When we were fairly into\r\nthe rough, rocky Guadalope Mountains, he stopped, dismounted, and picked\r\nup from the foot of a tree the four shoes of the horse ridden by the\r\nIndian. With a grim smile he handed them to me, and informed me that the\r\nIndian intended to hide his trail. For six days we journeyed over the\r\nroughest mountains, turning and twisting in apparently the most\r\nobjectless way, not a man in the whole command being able to discover,\r\nsometimes for hours, a single mark by which Espinosa might direct\r\nhimself. Sometimes I lost patience, and demanded that he show us what he\r\nwas following. ‘Poco tiempo,’ he would blandly answer, and in a longer\r\nor shorter time, show me the clear-cut footprints of the horse in the\r\nsoft bank of some mountain stream, or point with his long wiping-stick\r\nto most unmistakable ‘sign’ in the droppings of the horse. Following the\r\ndevious windings of this trail for nearly a hundred and fifty miles,\r\nscarcely ever at a loss, and only once or twice dismounting, more\r\nclosely to examine the ground, he finally brought me to where the\r\nIndians had reunited.”\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, the Indians had fired the prairie to hide their\r\ntrail. The officer in despair went to camp. Espinosa, after working over\r\nthe ground carefully on his hands and knees, blew away the light ashes\r\nuntil sufficient prints were found to show the direction of the trail.\r\nHe was compelled to make several circuits, covering a total of six or\r\nseven miles, and after weary hours spent in this work, the troops were\r\nable to pursue and capture the Indians. Espinosa and the Apaches once\r\nfound a trail after dark by feeling of the ground with their fingers.\r\nThis remarkable man, at the outbreak of the Civil War, was selected to\r\ncarry dispatches from Union men in San Antonio to Colonel Reeve. He was\r\ncaptured and shot to death. The account presented by Dodge of Espinosa\r\nis very interesting and indicates that this unknown man in Plains\r\nknowledge was far in advance of the white scouts of which we have heard\r\nso much. The Apaches recognized that their only weakness lay in their\r\ntrail, and they tried by every means to conceal it.\r\n\r\nThe next few years Geronimo led several expeditions into Mexico,\r\nsometimes being defeated, on other occasions returning with much plunder\r\nand many scalps. During his career as a fighting man he was wounded\r\nseven times. Once, he was left for dead, on the field.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the Mexicans attacked an Apache winter village, killing men,\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, while raiding in Mexico, Geronimo’s people captured a mule pack\r\ntrain. Some of the mules were loaded with mescal—an intoxicating drink\r\nof the Mexicans. The Apaches began drinking this and Geronimo, fearing\r\nthe consequences, poured out all of the liquor. On this occasion he\r\ncaptured a herd of cattle, drove the cattle to Arizona, killed them, and\r\ndried the meat for winter use.\r\n\r\nGeronimo emphasizes in his book something unknown to the general public.\r\nMany outlaws, both Americans and Mexicans, stole cattle and committed\r\nrobberies during these troublous years and the blame was always placed\r\non the Apaches. In spite of all that has been said, the latter were not\r\nwithout their virtues, as the following anecdote attests.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 two young men from the East, while prospecting in the mountains,\r\nsaw an old Apache and a young man, apparently his son. In attempting to\r\nretreat to camp, one of the white men fell and broke his leg. The old\r\nwarrior examined the broken limb, removed the shirt of the uninjured\r\nyouth, tore it up and carefully bound the broken member. Then the old\r\nwarrior, indicating the direction with his finger said:\r\n“Doctor—Lordsburg—three days,” and silently rode away.\r\n\r\nUp to 1870 the Apaches had had little trouble with the white people,\r\nalthough in 1841, according to testimony presented by Mrs. Jackson, they\r\nhad abundant grounds for hostility.[45]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 30th of April, 1871, that the real trouble began,\r\nThe massacre at Camp Grant, in Arizona, of several hundred friendly\r\nApaches, men, women and children, brought on hostilities.\r\n\r\nBeyond question, this and several subsequent raids on the part of white\r\npeople, were responsible for the attitude of Geronimo, Victorio and\r\nCochise. In 1873 and again in 1880 there was hard fighting in Mexico. In\r\n1884 Geronimo was head war chief, and fought his heaviest engagements.\r\nHow many men were killed in these actions is not stated.\r\n\r\nIn the early sixties United States troops invited the Apache chiefs into\r\na tent under promise, Geronimo states, that they were to be given a\r\nfeast. Geronimo says: “When in the tent they were attacked by soldiers.\r\nOur chief, Mangus-Colorado, and several other warriors, by cutting\r\nthrough the tent, escaped; but most of the warriors were killed or\r\ncaptured.” Heavy fighting followed. Such Apaches as spoke English\r\nvisited the officers and advised them where were located camps they\r\nsought, and while the soldiers hunted for these camps, Geronimo and his\r\nwarriors, “watched them from our hiding-places and laughed at their\r\nfailures.”\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the favorite chief, Mangus-Colorado, was put in the guardhouse.\r\nHe had been told by General West that he would be protected if he made\r\npeace. As the old chief entered he said: “This is my end.” During the\r\nnight some one threw a stone through the window and struck him in the\r\nbreast. He sprang up, and as he did so the guard shot and killed him.\r\n\r\nIn the seventies the United States troops sent for Victorio and\r\nGeronimo. As soon as they entered the camp they were taken to\r\nheadquarters and tried by court-martial. Victorio was released and\r\nGeronimo was put in chains, remaining in shackles four months.\r\n\r\nFor the next ensuing years there was considerable fighting, the Apaches\r\nbeing afraid to trust the United States authorities and the frontier\r\nelement anxious that the Apaches be exterminated. Our troops\r\noccasionally defeated the Indians but were more often repulsed. General\r\nCrook took away the Apaches’ cattle and horses, and as few of the\r\nApaches were horse Indians, preferring to fight or hunt on foot, and as\r\nthe cattle were an incentive to thrift and industry, this action of\r\nGeneral Crook’s was not a severe blow to the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe General followed the Apaches into Mexico and held an interview. I\r\nquote Geronimo’s description of what occurred.[46]\r\n\r\n“Said the General: ‘Why did you leave the reservation?’\r\n\r\n“I said: ‘You told me that I might live in the reservation the same as\r\nwhite people lived. One year I raised a crop of corn, and gathered and\r\nstored it, and the next year I put in a crop of oats, and when the crop\r\nwas almost ready to harvest, you told your soldiers to put me in prison,\r\nand if I resisted to kill me. If I had been let alone I would now have\r\nbeen in good circumstances, but instead of that you and the Mexicans\r\nwere hunting me with soldiers.’\r\n\r\n“He said: ‘I never gave any such orders; the troops at Fort Apache, who\r\nspread this report, knew that it was untrue.’\r\n\r\n“Then I agreed to go back with him to San Carlos.\r\n\r\n“It was hard for me to believe him at that time. Now I know that what he\r\nsaid was untrue, and I firmly believe that he did issue the orders for\r\nme to be put in prison, or to be killed in case I offered resistance.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  POMO WOMAN WEAVING A TWINED BASKET, CALIFORNIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the return march, the Indians left General Crook’s command and fled.\r\nGeronimo became “a bad Indian” in every sense of the word. He says: “We\r\nwere reckless of our lives, because we felt that every man’s hand was\r\nagainst us. If we returned to the reservation we would be put in prison\r\nand killed: if we stayed in Mexico they would continue to send soldiers\r\nto fight us; so we gave no quarter to anyone and asked no favors.”\r\n\r\nThe American troops in one action killed seven children, five women and\r\nfour men. Again, three Apache children were slain. Later, all Geronimo’s\r\nfamily was captured.\r\n\r\nNaiche, son of the famous fighting chief, Cochise, fought for years with\r\nGeronimo and surrendered when further resistance was useless.\r\n\r\nThe end came suddenly. Geronimo, driven from one side of the\r\nAmerican-Mexican border to the other, found no rest for his band, and\r\ntold Captain Lawton’s scouts that he would surrender to General Miles\r\nunder certain conditions. When Geronimo met General Miles, the\r\ninterpreter said, “General Miles is your friend.” Even in so critical a\r\nsituation his grim humor asserted itself. Geronimo retorted, “I never\r\nsaw him, but I have been in need of friends. Why has he not been with\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nAccording to the narrative of the Indian chief and other witnesses,\r\nGeronimo was to live with his family and be supported by the Government,\r\nunder certain restrictions. “I said to General Miles: ‘All the officers\r\nthat have been in charge of Indians have talked that way and it sounds\r\nlike a story to me; I hardly believe you.’\r\n\r\n“He said: ‘This time it is the truth.’”\r\n\r\nGeronimo gave up his arms saying:\r\n\r\n“‘I will quit the warpath and live at peace hereafter.’”\r\n\r\n“Then General Miles swept a spot of ground clear with his hand and said:\r\n\r\n“‘Your past deeds shall be wiped out like this, and you will start a new\r\nlife.’”\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that when the Apaches were taken East, not only the\r\nhostiles but also a few friendlies and some who had helped the troops,\r\nwere also deported. They were imprisoned in Florida, and Geronimo made\r\nto labor sawing large logs. One or two of the warriors committed\r\nsuicide. After some years the prisoners were removed to Fort Sill.\r\nGeronimo often complained that the Government did not keep the terms of\r\nthe Miles surrender. I have never heard that General Miles tried to\r\nright this wrong. If he did, I stand corrected.\r\n\r\nGeronimo did not see his family for two years—contrary to the terms of\r\nthe surrender.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sums up in a brief way the career of Geronimo. Under\r\nsimilar circumstances any white man of spirit and independence, and who\r\nwas not a coward, would become “a bad Indian.” After many appeals by the\r\nBoard of Indian Commissioners, the Indian Rights Association and others,\r\nthese Apache prisoners were removed to their ancient homes. About\r\nseventy elected to remain near Fort Sill, Okla., and have been given\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nPractically all of them are doing well—industrious and capable.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  Geronimo, the story of his life, Recorded by S.

The States of Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New\r\nMexico, southwestern Colorado, western Texas and southern California\r\nprior to 1860 were known as the “Great American Desert.” The Yuman,\r\nPiman and Athapascan, together with a few lesser stocks, inhabited this\r\ngreat region. Chief of the desert tribes is the Navaho. Doctor\r\nWashington Matthews has presented considerable literature in the\r\nAmerican Anthropologist and elsewhere on this interesting folk; Oscar H.\r\nLipps published a history of the Navaho in 1909; George Wharton James,\r\nEsq., refers to them at considerable length in his publications. The\r\nFranciscan Fathers, having a mission at St. Michaels, Arizona, published\r\nin 1910 a complete ethnologic dictionary of the Navaho customs, legends,\r\nand gave large numbers of sentences. This also contained a bibliography\r\nof some length. Doctor George W. Pepper of the University of\r\nPennsylvania Museum published a very interesting article on “The Making\r\nof a Navaho Blanket” in _Everybody’s Magazine_, January, 1902. A volume\r\ngiving details of blanket and wool industry among the Navaho has just\r\nbeen written by George Wharton James, Esq., entitled “Indian Blankets\r\nand Their Makers”. This volume of 213 large pages contains many colored\r\nplates and is the most comprehensive treatment of the Navaho\r\nblanket-weaving industry ever published.\r\n\r\nThe Navaho are the only really unspoiled Indians left in America, and I\r\ntrust that readers will pardon repetition, when I again urge that they\r\nbe let alone to work out their own salvation. That is, while certain\r\nsafeguards are necessary, we should realize our incompetency and\r\nignorance—not to use a stronger term—in handling the natives of\r\nOklahoma, Minnesota and California, and not repeat our blunders in the\r\n“benevolent assimilation” of these intelligent, industrious, and moral\r\npeople. Here is one splendid racial stock that has thus far escaped the\r\nblight of our bureaucracy. The Navaho still stands, frightened, gazing\r\nin at the threshold of our civilization. He sees the greed of the white\r\nsettler for his possessions.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of reports on the Navaho, in addition to the\r\nethnological and popular works cited. Any one of these will give readers\r\na fair conception of conditions among these Indians.\r\n\r\nRev. Anselm Weber of the Franciscan Mission published a pamphlet on July\r\n25, 1914. The Indian Rights Association has also taken up officially\r\nthese Indians in its annual reports, the past two or three years.\r\nHonorable F. H. Abbott, Secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners,\r\nvisited the Navaho and made specific recommendations as to allotment and\r\nirrigation plans. In December-January, 1913–14, Rev. Samuel A. Eliot and\r\nRev. William H. Ketcham, members of the Board of Indian Commissioners,\r\nofficially visited the Navaho and made a report to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior. Rev. W. R. Johnson, missionary located at Indian Wells,\r\nArizona, has repeatedly urged in public addresses at Lake Mohonk and\r\nelsewhere the need of proper protection of this, the finest body of\r\naboriginal men and women remaining in North America.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go back to 1850, to state that these Indians were\r\nin a satisfactory condition. They _are_ in a satisfactory condition\r\ntoday, and are the only band of Indians so situated in this country. The\r\nnumber of them is said by Father Weber to be about 25,000. Rev. Johnson,\r\nwho traveled extensively over the reservation, claims there are 28,000.\r\nTaking into consideration several thousand that live off the reservation\r\non the public domain, there are at least 30,000 Navaho today. The number\r\nof sheep they possess has been variously estimated from one million to\r\ntwo million head. The number of blankets the women wove last year, no\r\nman may know, but the value of the blanket industry is upwards of a\r\nmillion dollars per annum. A few years ago, Commissioner Valentine\r\nstated that the Navaho sold $800,000 worth of blankets. It must be\r\nremembered that many of their blankets are sold north of the San Juan\r\nriver and elsewhere off the reservation, and that traveling traders and\r\nbuyers continually penetrate beyond the borders of the reserve. The\r\ntotals obtained by superintendents, teachers and white employees, is\r\ndoubtless far below the actual volume of business.\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, the reservation is a part of our famous “painted\r\ndesert”. It is exceedingly diversified in character, the landscape\r\nvarying from high mesas to deep canons; from towering mountains to\r\nstretches of desert. Fortunately, no mineral deposits aside from coal\r\nhave been discovered. On three separate occasions, in the ’60’s, ’70’s\r\nand ’80’s, prospectors, in defiance of law, entered the Navaho\r\nreservation in search of gold, silver or copper. When I was conducting\r\nthe cliff-dweller expeditions along the San Juan in 1892 and again in\r\n1897, several of the “oldtimers” informed me that these prospectors were\r\nnever heard of afterward. Accompanying the last expedition, there were\r\nseveral men from north of Durango, Colorado, and their friends\r\nthreatened reprisals on the Navaho, alleging that the Indians had killed\r\nthese prospectors. However, aside from talk, nothing was done, the men\r\nnever returned, and the Indians remained in peaceful possession of their\r\nestate. It was considered, in the ’70’s and ’80’s “bad medicine” for\r\nwhite men to depart from certain Navaho trails!\r\n\r\nThe Navaho reservation embraces 11,887,793 acres, of which approximately\r\n719,360 acres belong to the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company, and\r\napproximately 55,400 acres to the State of Arizona, leaving 11,113,033\r\nacres. Consequently, if you take the very conservative figure of 25,000\r\nNavahos and 11,113,033 acres belonging to them, you would have 444 acres\r\nto the person. But as four-fifths is high, dry mesa or absolute desert,\r\nthe statement often made that each Indian might have 444 acres is\r\nmisleading. Each Indian could not have (average) more than twelve or\r\nfifteen acres of pasture land.\r\n\r\nThe Navaho are the only large body of Indians in the United States who\r\nkeep up ancient customs, arts and ceremonies. They not only enjoy a\r\ngreat variety of games and sports, but they are probably the best and\r\nstrongest long-distance runners in America. Mr. Lipps has given a very\r\nentertaining account of their games, etc., in his book, to which I have\r\nreferred on a previous page.\r\n\r\nThey are exceedingly adverse to burying their dead and are quite willing\r\nthat white people should perform this service for them. Of all the\r\nremaining Indian tribes, they furnish the best field for investigation\r\nat the present time. Much has been written concerning them, but it will\r\nrequire additional researches in order to complete a satisfactory study\r\nof their ethnology.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the head of the family, his property “descends to his\r\nbrothers, sisters, uncles and aunts to the exclusion of his wife and\r\nchildren, a custom which is often very harmful in its effects, since if\r\nthe wife should happen not to be possessed of some property in her own\r\nright she and her children are made to suffer penury and want.”[47]\r\n\r\nIn past years a number of the older men possessed two or three wives.\r\nPolygamy was to be expected, for the Mormons settled north of the San\r\nJuan, (Utah), long before white settlers came from the East. Although\r\nthe Navaho probably believed in polygamy long ago, only those who were\r\nwell-to-do had more than one wife, and the increase in polygamous\r\nmarriages was undoubtedly due to the example set by the Mormons.\r\n\r\nThe Government has taken steps to wipe out this practice and no more\r\nplural marriages are permitted. Men having more than one wife have been\r\nencouraged to give up their plural wives, and this has been done in some\r\ncases, mainly where there are no children by the marriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NAVAHO SILVERSMITH AND HIS OUTFIT\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Navaho are invariably kind and considerate to each other, and their\r\nfamily life is of higher plane than among most Indians. The children are\r\nseldom punished, for the good reason that they do not merit punishment.\r\nIn the case of very old persons, it is sometimes observed that the\r\nchildren do not love and protect them as completely as might be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe chief taboo of the Navaho is the fish. Under no circumstances will a\r\nNavaho eat fish. He believes that upon the death of a very evil person,\r\nthe spirit enters the body of a fish, hence his utter horror and hatred\r\nof the finny tribe. An Indian student entered Phillips Academy, Andover,\r\nsome years ago. He was employed in the dining hall and thus earned his\r\ntuition. He informed me that his most disagreeable duty, and that which\r\nhe loathed, was the preparation of fish for the weekly Friday dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in camp at Chaco canon in 1897, the Navaho came to us in\r\nlarge numbers at meal time. Our larder rapidly diminished. Something\r\nmust be done. The cook found that one of the packing boxes had a large\r\nblue codfish stamped on the side. He placed this box out in plain view\r\nand the Indians who had assembled to eat supper with us withdrew to\r\ntheir own camps.\r\n\r\nThe Navaho had carried on raids against the Mexicans and the frontier of\r\nTexas for many years. In 1863 a party of men led by the famous scout,\r\nKit Karson, invaded their territory and killed a large number of\r\nIndians. All of the Navaho that could be captured were taken East to the\r\nRio Pecos. Here they were kept until 1867 under military guard, when\r\nthey were restored to their country and given a large flock of sheep. In\r\n1869 the Government assembled all these Indians and having difficulty to\r\nenumerate them because of their nomadic habits, resorted to a novel\r\nstratagem. The people were crowded in an enormous corral, and counted as\r\nthey entered. The Handbook of American Indians states that there were\r\nsome fewer than 9,000. I cannot believe that this estimate was accurate,\r\nfor it would be impossible for troops to round up all the Navaho.\r\nDoubtless, many fled north of the San Juan, or west to the Colorado, on\r\nthe appearance of the troops.\r\n\r\nThey are very highly religious people and possess thousands of\r\nsignificant songs and prayers. The Handbook states that some of the\r\nceremonies continue for nine nights, and that it is necessary for the\r\nshamans to spend years of study in order to become perfectly familiar\r\nwith the complicated ritual.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were much crowded before permitted to settle upon public\r\nlands. To meet this need, Commissioner Leupp in 1908 extended the\r\nreservation. Father Weber covers all the details in his excellent\r\npamphlet. The white cattlemen and their friends set up a great\r\nuproar, indignation meetings were held, and Congress was importuned\r\nto prevent the Indians from living on the public domain. In fact,\r\nall sorts of pressure was brought to bear to reduce the size of the\r\nreservation—although it was manifestly too small. None of the\r\nMexicans and Americans, for whom the business men and politicians of\r\nthe southwest were so concerned, were living on the tracts they\r\nsought to control. On the contrary they lived in towns or\r\nsettlements removed from the Indian country, and simply ranged their\r\nsheep and cattle over these tracts in charge of herders and cowboys.\r\nThe Indians, the Navaho, against whom this hue and cry was raised,\r\nactually had their homes upon the tracts, and were dependent upon\r\nthem for their living. Many of them lived in the same place for two\r\nor three generations. During all the disputes, no one was shot, and\r\nno violence occurred. Yet all that was possible was done to mislead\r\nCongress, as the following speech attests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RED GOAT AND HIS MOTHER, NAVAHO, 1902\r\n\r\n  Photograph by E. R. Forrest.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“I want to say to the Senator (Bristow) that possibly he does not\r\nunderstand the conditions as they exist in our country. Possibly he is\r\nnot aware of the fact that every year, two or three times a year, these\r\nIndians are allowed to go from their immensely rich reserves to\r\ninterfere with white men, American citizens, on the public domain,\r\ncausing the killing of anywhere from one to a dozen people. This is an\r\nunfortunate condition of affairs. I can say to the Senator that we\r\npeople down in our section of the country can deal with these conditions\r\nif we are compelled to; but this sometimes becomes a question of all a\r\nman has—of his property rights, of protection to his family and his\r\nchildren. Any white man, any American citizen, will then use such force\r\nas is necessary in protecting his family. All that we seek to do is to\r\nrestrict the further location of these Indians upon the public domain\r\nuntil Congress can act again. The committee is being appointed, and I\r\npresume this matter will be investigated. It has been investigated\r\nbefore, and reports made, and no action taken. But this must cease; it\r\nmust stop; and I tell the Senator from Kansas that it will\r\nstop.”—(_Congressional Record_, June 17, 1913, page 2320).\r\n\r\nFather Weber’s comment on it is very apropos:—\r\n\r\n“I regret that a Senator made this statement. I have been among the\r\nNavaho for sixteen years, and I know of not one single instance where a\r\nwhite man was killed on account of Navahos leaving the reservation, or\r\non account of any grazing or land disputes. If every year the killing of\r\nfrom one to a dozen is occasioned by Navaho leaving their reserve, how\r\nis it that no one knows anything about it?”[48]\r\n\r\nIn past years I have traveled a good deal over the Navaho reservation.\r\nRecently one of my friends, J. Weston Allen, Esq., of Boston, on behalf\r\nof the Boston Indian Citizenship Committee, of which he is\r\nvice-chairman, made a tour of investigation through the Navaho country,\r\nand the conditions as he found them were incorporated in an able report\r\nto the Secretary of the Interior. Major William T. Shelton, the\r\nSuperintendent at Shiprock, who has long lived with these Indians, while\r\ndiffering in some details from the views of Mr. Sniffen, Rev. Johnson\r\nand Honorable F. H. Abbott, yet agrees with them in the main issue that\r\nthe Navaho should not be too much superintended. All he needs is\r\nprotection—not charity, suggestion, nor interference with his industry.\r\nDoctor W. W. Wallace, who has been a trader among the Navaho since 1890,\r\nwrites me that the Indians have steadily progressed, that they ask no\r\nfavors, and all they desire is to be permitted to continue on their\r\nsuccessful way. My own observation leads me to believe that the\r\nreservation should not be reduced; allotments must not be made in any\r\nevent until irrigation has disclosed the land values; more schools\r\nshould be established, and above all dams should be erected to store\r\nwater during the spring floods so that more acres may be brought under\r\ncultivation. There are vast possibilities for irrigation in the Navaho\r\ncountry, as Mr. Abbott has pointed out. The last investigation by two\r\nmembers of our Board (Ketcham and Eliot) was important, and I present\r\ntwo of the seven recommendations they strongly urged.\r\n\r\n“_Allotment._ We are thoroughly convinced that the time has not yet come\r\nfor the allotment of the Indians on the reservation. The Navaho is\r\nproceeding along the way of civilization as fast as he can safely\r\ntravel. He is independent and self-supporting. He is steadily improving\r\nhis dwelling, his stock and his method of farming. He is learning\r\nEnglish, sending his children to school, and increasingly following the\r\nadvice of the white physicians. He is developing his own water\r\nresources, forming good industrial habits and gradually adopting white\r\nstandards of domestic life. Following their own customs, the Indians\r\ndivide their common resources with remarkable fairness and live\r\npeaceably with one another and with the Whites. They must be permitted\r\nslowly to come into an understanding of our customs of private land\r\nownership and inheritance. There is nothing to be gained by hurrying\r\nthat process. Allotment on the reservation should not be thought of for\r\na good many years to come.\r\n\r\n“We are impressed with the exceptional opportunity of the Navaho\r\nreservation for the work of field matrons and recommend that an\r\nadditional force be provided for. The field matrons should work in close\r\ncooperation with superintendents, teachers and physicians.\r\n\r\n“In general we believe that the condition of the Navaho is promising.\r\nThe people are virile, industrious and independent. With the exercise of\r\nordinary good judgment, patience and tact, there need never be any\r\nserious problem in connection with their development.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Joseph K. Dixon, representing the Wanamaker Expedition, visited\r\nthe “painted desert”. He took some remarkable motion pictures of Navaho\r\nherders driving thousands of sheep down to the waterholes. As I observed\r\nthese pictures, portraying the peaceful, industrious life of these red\r\nnomads of the desert, I wished fondly that all men and women unable to\r\nobserve Indian life as it is in the Southwest, might see them. They\r\nrecalled many interesting days spent among these sturdy folk. The\r\nnatives living as do the Navaho, present an object lesson to all\r\n“reformers”, and it is to be devoutly hoped that we will heed the lesson\r\nand “let well enough alone.” To do otherwise will destroy the initiative\r\nof a self-supporting and upright people, and deprive the world of a\r\nprimitive stock of exceptional physical stamina and mental ability.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen’s report to the Secretary of the Interior and the Boston\r\nIndian Citizenship Committee cannot be reproduced at length, much to my\r\nregret, but I herewith append certain sections, as it is a splendid\r\npresentation of the Navaho situation and includes valuable\r\nrecommendations to meet the needs of these Indians.\r\n\r\n“Three obvious difficulties immediately present themselves when any plan\r\nof Navaho settlement is considered—(1) the great inequality of the land\r\nfor grazing purposes; (2) the scarcity of water, and the fact that much\r\nof the land is far distant from the nearest water supply; (3) the\r\nexistence of summer and winter ranges and the removal of the sheep from\r\nplace to place under the changing conditions of different seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n“Of the inequality of the land for grazing purposes, it is sufficient to\r\nsay that there are vast areas of rock and sand where an allotment of 160\r\nacres would not support a single sheep. Of the inaccessibility of water,\r\nit may be similarly stated that there are sections of land within the\r\nreservation which are so far from water during the dry season that sheep\r\nwould die from exhaustion before they could reach it. Of the necessity\r\nof moving the sheep from one part of the reservation to another, it is\r\nperhaps sufficient to point out that in the winter the sheep must have\r\nthe protection of the sheltered valleys and in the summer they are\r\ndriven by the heat and the scarcity of water into the mountains.\r\n\r\n“A matter of far greater importance in the consideration of any\r\nequitable allotment is the determination of the location and extent of\r\nthe land within the limitations of the reservation which can be claimed\r\nby irrigation.”\r\n\r\nMr. Allen points out the difficulties in allotting a nomadic people\r\npermanent homes. He is opposed to any allotment under existing\r\nconditions. It may have to come in time, doubtless prematurely as in the\r\ncase of other reservations, but on the Navaho reservation there are\r\ndifficulties which have not been encountered in our experience with\r\nother tribes.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen’s report may be summed up as follows:—There should be a\r\ncommission appointed composed of engineers and stockmen to thoroughly\r\ninvestigate the possibilities of the reservation, both through means of\r\nstorage dams to conserve the mountain freshets in the springtime, and\r\nalso to divert the water from the rivers as is being done along the San\r\nJuan river to the north. This stream carries a large volume of water,\r\nand although there are many white persons living north of the river in\r\nUtah and New Mexico and much water is used, the river is very high from\r\nMay 1st to July 1st. It therefore affords great possibilities in the way\r\nof water storage.\r\n\r\nHe recommends a detailed study of the coalbeds and timber tracts on the\r\nreservation, and the improvement of the Navaho sheep, by the\r\nintroduction of better stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NAVAHO WINTER HOGAN\r\n\r\n  Photographed by E. R. Forrest; 1902\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile tuberculosis is found in about 10% of the Navaho, trachoma is much\r\nmore prevalent, and he records the usual story of afflicted Indian\r\nchildren, men and women. The hospital facilities are totally inadequate.\r\nThere is a hospital at Indian Wells, Arizona, maintained by the National\r\nIndian Association, an Episcopal hospital near Fort Defiance, while\r\nanother is maintained by the Presbyterians at Ganado. The only large\r\nhospital with adequate equipment is at the Government school at Fort\r\nDefiance. Doctor Wigglesworth, physician in charge, who has won the\r\nconfidence of these Indians by long years of constant labor among them,\r\ndoes all in his power to alleviate distress, but the field is entirely\r\ntoo extensive to be covered by one man. Mrs. Mary L. Eldridge, for many\r\nyears in charge of a mission near Farmington, N. M., does medical work\r\namong the Indians. There is a small Government hospital at Shiprock.\r\n\r\nThe medicine men cause the Government officials and missionaries a great\r\ndeal of trouble. Mr. Allen presents a number of incidents in his reports\r\nexplaining their activities. Many Indians will not take treatment in the\r\nhospitals through fear of the shamans, and in more than one instance a\r\nsick Indian has been removed by his friends from the mission hospital\r\nduring the night, and carried off to the village where he might be\r\ntreated by the shaman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MODERN INDIAN HOUSE, SYLVIAN, OKLAHOMA\r\n\r\n  This type is inferior in construction to the houses built in\r\n    pre-statehood days.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEducational facilities are inadequate to care for half the children of\r\nschool age. In many of the schools, trachoma has afflicted numbers of\r\nthe children. When tuberculosis develops among the school children they\r\nare sent home from the school to die without medical attendance. Mr.\r\nAllen suggests that more physicians, qualified to treat trachoma and\r\ntuberculosis, be appointed to service among the Navaho, and that each\r\none be assigned a territory fifty miles square, with a field sanitarium\r\nlocated near the center of the territory. He also suggests that young\r\nNavaho women, selected from the larger boarding schools, be trained as\r\nnurses, since many of these Indians do not take kindly to treatment by\r\nwhite persons, and it is difficult to secure competent nurses who are\r\nwilling to remain long in the small frontier hospitals of the Navaho\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nAt Shiprock, Superintendent Shelton has developed a large school with\r\nextensive farms and industrial buildings. The settlement at Shiprock is\r\njustly considered one of the show places in the Indian Service. Here the\r\ndesert is made to blossom as the rose. Mr. Shelton admits few small\r\nchildren in his school and keeps his scholars until they reach adult\r\nage. He is thus able to make a better showing in his farms and gardens\r\nthan do those who receive the children at an earlier age, and return\r\nthem to their homes after four or five years of training. Mr. Shelton’s\r\nwork at Shiprock could now be carried on by some one else, and his\r\nrecognized ability used in a new field to develop another section of the\r\nreservation further west. By creating another Shiprock, he could do more\r\nto raise the standard of living among his people.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Paquette at Fort Defiance is extending education work\r\nthroughout his reservation, and reaches a larger percentage of children\r\nof school age than are being reached elsewhere in the Navaho country.\r\n\r\nIn concluding his report, Mr. Allen points out the failure of the\r\nreturned student to make good and the reasons for it.\r\n\r\n“The problem of the returned student is a serious one among the Navaho.\r\nThe boys and girls who have been for years in school come back to their\r\npeople without a training for taking care of the flocks, and are outdone\r\nby those who remain at home. They are for this reason more or less\r\nlooked down upon, with the result that they have no inclination to\r\ncontinue the habits of study and cleanliness which they have acquired at\r\nschool and which are not appreciated in the home. The effort of the old\r\nmen of the tribe is to keep the children who return from school from\r\nseeking any higher place than is enjoyed by other members of the family.\r\nIf the young men and the young women of the tribe, who have received an\r\neducation and who have acquired an appreciation of what they learned in\r\nschool, intermarried, the benefits of their education would be more\r\npermanent, but many of the girls upon their return from school are given\r\nin marriage by their parents to old men of the tribe, and many of the\r\nboys return only to find that they are required to marry old women, or\r\nat best, ‘camp girls’ as they are called—the uneducated girls of the\r\nhogan. The inevitable result is that they go back to the old life.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  “A Little History of the Navahos.” Oscar H.

INDIANS OF THE NORTHWEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the great Northwest, are today of many diversified and\r\nsmall bands, chief among which are the Crows, Utes, Nez Perces, Paiutes,\r\nNorthern Cheyennes, Blackfeet, and Yakimas, and various Columbia River\r\nbands. Linguistically they are Athapascan, Salishan and Shoshonean\r\nstocks with remnants of other stocks along the Pacific coast.\r\nPractically all of them live on reservations. As in the case of the\r\nother tribes described in this volume, the children have been educated,\r\nallotments have been granted to most of the individuals, irrigation\r\nschemes either projected or carried into effect, timber sold, or\r\nGovernment sawmills established, and the entire life of the Indians\r\nchanged. The narrative, therefore, must be along historical and\r\nphilanthropic lines rather than ethnologic. True, up to about 1880 many\r\nof these Indians lived in their original condition, and particularly is\r\nthis true of the Paiute and Modoc bands located far from the established\r\nroutes of travel. The Indians of the Northwest came in contact with the\r\ntrappers and gold-hunters flocking to the new country made familiar by\r\nthe Lewis and Clark expedition. As an inevitable result, a number of\r\nwars occurred in which all of the Indians were more or less engaged. The\r\nmost noted of these was the Nez Perce war of 1877, in which Chief Joseph\r\nled his Indians on a magnificent retreat through the mountains for\r\nupwards of 1100 miles to nearly the Canadian border. The story of our\r\nbroken faith with the Nez Perces is set forth in many documents and by\r\nGeneral Howard himself in his book, “Chief Joseph. His Pursuit and\r\nCapture.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the Nez Perce war, in 1878, the Bannock Indians, a numerous\r\ndivision of the Shoshonean stock, were so harassed by white people that\r\nthey went upon the warpath. A number of settlers and soldiers were\r\nkilled, and in September, 1878, the outbreak came to an end after the\r\nmilitary had killed all the women and children in a village of twenty\r\nlodges.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Modocs in southeastern Oregon had obtained a very unsavory\r\nreputation. This was due to their resenting the encroachments of the\r\nWhites. Many settlers, and also friendly Indians, were killed during\r\nvarious encounters. The trouble culminated in the famous siege of the\r\nlava beds, on the California frontier between Oregon and California.\r\nHere the Indians located in an almost impregnable stronghold and\r\nwithstood the attacks of troops from January to April, 1873. Some Peace\r\nCommissioners, headed by General Camby, were sent to treat with the\r\nIndians and these were treacherously murdered. After hard fighting the\r\nstronghold was taken and five of the leaders captured and hanged. Like\r\nother Northwest tribes (except larger bands) the Modocs have so dwindled\r\nin numbers that they now cease to be a factor in Indian life. The\r\nnorthern Cheyennes now located on a reservation at Lame Deer, Montana,\r\nhave long been known as a fighting people. Two generations ago the\r\nCheyennes were much in evidence with the Sioux and other tribes in an\r\nattempt to prevent the usurpation of their hunting grounds and grazing\r\nlands on the part of the Whites. One of the Department Inspectors\r\nrecently visited their reservation and under date of September 17th,\r\nwrites me as follows:\r\n\r\n“I am very busy and am finding conditions here about as bad as they were\r\nat White Earth except that these Indians have not been allotted and are\r\nnot losing their land, but they are just as poor and are eating dogs,\r\nhorseflesh, prairie dogs, porcupines and skunks. Conditions are\r\ndisgraceful but will be properly presented, you may be sure.”\r\n\r\nThe Crow Indians, an offshoot of the Siouan stock, in Montana, are\r\nnumerically the strongest of any of the mountain tribes. They possess a\r\nvery large reservation, abundant grazing lands, timber and agricultural\r\npossibilities. However, as in the case of the Cheyennes, they have been\r\nbackward in spite of all efforts on the part of the Government to\r\neducate them. The problem on their reservation relates chiefly to the\r\ngrazing privilege. The Indians were leasing a vast tract of land to\r\nwhite men for the pasturing of cattle and horses at so much per head.\r\nThe Whites took advantage of the Indians’ ignorance and it was necessary\r\nfor the Indian Rights Association to conduct a thorough investigation. I\r\nquote from the Association’s report as to former conditions among the\r\nCrows, and the present improvement.\r\n\r\n“The Crow Reservation, in Montana, had for years been controlled by a\r\nsmall ring of men, who boasted of strong political backing, and they\r\nused it for their private gain at the expense of those Indians, through\r\nthe connivance of the Agent, who had formerly been employed in a bank of\r\nwhich the leader of this ring was the principal stockholder. For three\r\nyears the Indian Rights Association sought to have a real investigation\r\nmade at that point by the Department, but instead of receiving any\r\nencouragement, its efforts were blocked at every turn. Secretary\r\nGarfield had said to us, ‘bring me facts, and I will investigate them,’\r\nbut he refused to give us a formal permit to enable us to go on to the\r\nreservation and get those facts. When our Secretary was sent there for\r\nthat purpose, a little later, he was promptly arrested and ordered off\r\nthe reservation at his earliest convenience.\r\n\r\n“When Commissioner Valentine assumed office, however, he promptly\r\nafforded our Secretary every courtesy and facility that were required to\r\ngo unmolested over the reservation; and when the result of a month’s\r\nsifting was brought to his attention, he not only ordered an immediate\r\ninvestigation, but Mr. Sniffen was requested to be present to represent\r\nthe Indians—an invitation that was, of course, accepted.\r\n\r\n“On the basis of the information gathered by our Secretary, the chief\r\nSupervisor of the Indian Office conducted an investigation during\r\nOctober and November, 1909, and his treatment of the Crow Indians was in\r\ndecided contrast to their experience with a former Inspector two years\r\nprevious, when, without provocation, their main witness was brutally\r\ncursed and ordered from the tent. When the Supervisor’s report was\r\nsubmitted, however, it proved to be one of ‘confession and avoidance.’\r\nHe made it plain, certainly in a number of respects, what some of the\r\nconditions were, but he avoided placing the responsibility where it\r\nbelonged—upon the then Superintendent. It was clearly proved that this\r\nSuperintendent knowingly and wilfully permitted the violation of a\r\nUnited States statute by the man he regarded as his real superior, who\r\nwas NOT an official of the Government, and that provisions of the\r\ngrazing permits had not been respected. In spite of this and more,\r\nhowever, the Supervisor recommended that the Superintendent be ‘assured\r\nof the confidence of the Indian Office in his integrity, business\r\nability and moral character.’ A few months later (in 1910), the\r\nSuperintendent was forced by pressure to resign, notwithstanding the\r\n‘confidence of the Indian Office in his integrity,’ etc. He was\r\nsucceeded by an honest and efficient high-grade man, and conditions on\r\nthe reservation have greatly improved. It is significant that the\r\nrevenue derived from the grazing privileges under the new management\r\nwill amount during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, to $160,000,\r\nwhereas under the former Superintendent it was $33,001.27.”\r\n\r\nAll of these tribes mentioned in this chapter still possess sufficient\r\nproperty for their maintenance, and some of them a great deal. The\r\nconditions are not intolerable as elsewhere, and most of the educated\r\nIndians have become self-supporting and are successful farmers,\r\nteachers, lumbermen, etc. Along the Columbia river the salmon industry\r\naffords employment to hundreds of men and women, and the vast extent of\r\norchards and vineyards presents an opportunity for other hundreds of\r\nIndians to earn money picking fruit and hops, harvesting grains and hay,\r\npicking apples, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRAIN, VEGETABLES AND FRUITS, BEADWORK AND BASKETS\r\n\r\n  This Exhibit took several prizes at the State Fair, Spokane, Wash.,\r\n    1913\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the richest reservations in point of natural resources is that\r\ninhabited by the Yakima of the same linguistic family as the Nez Perces\r\n(Shahaptian). A gentleman whom I have known for many years, L. V.\r\nMcWhorter, Esq., has a ranch adjoining the reservation, and has lived\r\namong these Indians until he has become entirely familiar with the\r\nsituation and their needs. The problem in the Northwest, being totally\r\ndifferent from that elsewhere in the United States, I herewith reprint a\r\nnumber of paragraphs from Mr. McWhorter’s recent pamphlet “The Crime\r\nAgainst the Yakimas.”\r\n\r\nIt indicates how that the white people have dispossessed these Indians\r\nand taken advantage of the wonderful agricultural, timber and\r\nwater-power resources. There are a number of other places in the United\r\nStates where at present similar conditions to that on the Yakima\r\nreservation face the Indians, and this may serve to illustrate other\r\nsections of the country where irrigation schemes on Indian lands are\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n“The Yakima Indian Reservation, Washington, was created at the Walla\r\nWalla Treaty in 1855, for the Fourteen Confederated Tribes, and covers\r\napproximately 1,000,000 acres of diversified country, including a vast\r\nbody of fine desert lands susceptible to irrigation, which last has been\r\nallotted in severalty to the Indians, numbering 3,046 souls. About\r\n42,000 acres of this is under a good system of irrigation, some private\r\nditches, the canals being paid for by the Indians and by special\r\nappropriations by the Government. Crops are produced on 10,000 acres\r\nadditional by sub-irrigation, while perhaps 20,000 acres of the allotted\r\nlands have been purchased by the Whites. This irrigable region, fertile\r\nbeyond conception when watered, has long been coveted by the white man.\r\nThe first attempt at irrigation on this reservation was in 1859.\r\n\r\n“In 1895 the Commercial Club of North Yakima, Wash., petitioned Congress\r\nto sell the surplus lands of the Yakimas, and to open the reservation\r\nfor settlement. Two years later Commissioners were sent to negotiate\r\nwith the tribe. It was estimated that 200,000 acres of land would\r\nsuffice for all allotments, and for the residue the Government offered\r\n$1,400,000, deferred payments to bear four per cent interest. The\r\nYakimas refused this offer.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Aside from the Jones Bill, December 21, 1904, which provides for the\r\nopening of the reservation and the sale and settlement of unallotted\r\ntribal lands, the next serious attempt to amputate the Yakimas from\r\ntheir lands culminated in the notorious Jones Bill, March 6, 1906, which\r\nprovides that the irrigable lands of the Reservation be cared for by the\r\nUnited States Reclamation Service. This bill, with the consent of the\r\nIndian, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to sell sixty acres of\r\neach eighty-acre allotment; the twenty acres retained by the Indian to\r\nbe furnished with a water right, to be paid for from the sale of the\r\nsixty acres. After the payment of such water right, ‘the balance, if\r\nany, shall be deposited in the treasury of the United States, to the\r\ncredit of the individual Indian, and may be paid to any of them, if, in\r\nthe opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, such payments will tend to\r\nimprove the condition and advance the progress of said Indian, but not\r\notherwise.’ Under this act the Wapato Project to water about 120,000\r\nacres, was launched. The estimated cost for a water right for the\r\nIndian’s twenty acres, including storage, is $30.00 per acre.”\r\n\r\nWe have no space for a full discussion of the attempt to rob the\r\nYakimas. Friends rallied to their support—notably the Indian Rights\r\nAssociation. McWhorter saw the fruits of his toil ripening, and it now\r\nappears that these Indians will be protected in part, if not entirely.\r\n\r\nJune 8th, 1912, the Indians themselves sent a long petition to Hon. J.\r\nH. Stephens, Chairman of the House Committee on Indian Affairs. The\r\nclosing paragraphs are characteristically Indian:—\r\n\r\n“On Ahtanum River divide of our reservation where white man have most\r\nland, the Secretary of the Interior gives three-fourths of water to\r\nwhite man. Now, when red man have most land to water, he gives nearly\r\nall water to white man. This was done and we could not help ourselves.\r\nWe want only what is right. God wants the white man and the red man to\r\nlive in peace. We try hard to do right and obey the white man’s laws. We\r\nwant you to help us.\r\n\r\n“Our friend in Congress introduced ‘House joint resolution 250’ for\r\nAttorney General to settle our water rights. This is good, but Secretary\r\nInterior hold up this resolution and try to make Jones bill 6693 law, so\r\nReclamation will own all water and have us flat. We want you to stop\r\nJones bill and make law the resolution 250. Then Attorney General will\r\nsettle all justly. If this is not done we are bringing suit in United\r\nStates court to settle our water rights. We want the white man to be\r\nhonest and treat us right. Our words are done.\r\n\r\n“Our friend, help us. We want to hear from you.\r\n\r\n“Your friends,\r\n  “(Signed)       WE-YAL-LUP WA-YA-CI-KA (his x mark),\r\n                    “_Chief Judge of the Yakima Tribal Courts_,\r\n                                    “_Clan Chief of the Ahtanum_.\r\n  “(Signed)       LOUIS MANN,\r\n                    “_Corresponding Secretary of the [Indian]\r\n                       Councils_.”\r\n\r\nThe Utes of Utah and Colorado never have been progressive, though some\r\nof them do work. They require special treatment. A Government employee\r\nremedied conditions among them in August, 1912, and wrote me, giving\r\nsensible advice, as follows:—\r\n\r\n“What good does it do to send out circulars on sanitary conditions and\r\ndairying, when some of these Indians are in destitute circumstances? The\r\npoor Utes down at Navaho Springs need something to eat and wear, and\r\nsome blankets to keep them warm. They sleep on sheepskins on the floors\r\nof their tipis. They get but little rations. They have been compelled to\r\nsell their ponies and buckskin suits, and beadwork, and Navaho blankets,\r\nto get something to eat for themselves and their children. They have no\r\nallotments, do not farm and have no way to make a dollar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN PACK-TRAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n  Photographed by E. R. Forrest, Washington, Pa.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Here at this reservation I have found that the Indians have been\r\ndefrauded in their lands and moneys. They sold their lands under\r\ndirection of the Agent, and then the scheme was to get their money away\r\nas soon as possible. It was done through the dishonest Indian trader in\r\nevery possible manner. Indians’ checks were drawn, of which the Indian\r\nknew nothing, in favor of some Indian trader for horses, wagons and\r\nother things of which the Indian had no knowledge and which he did not\r\nget. Although the checks are drawn in his name and charged to the\r\nIndian, no credit is given the Indian on the books of the trader. This\r\nis just a sample. One poor Indian who lives at Navaho Springs, had his\r\nallotment of 160 acres sold for $245. This was put on the books to his\r\ncredit. Then a check was drawn for a horse and saddle in favor of Mr.\r\nTrader for $165 to pay for same. He never bought same and never had this\r\nhorse and saddle. No credit for this check on the Trader’s books. Then\r\nanother check was drawn in the sum of $67 against this Indian account,\r\nof which he knows nothing, for a saddle, bridle, and tent. He never\r\nbought or got the bridle, saddle, or tent and knows nothing of the\r\ntransaction. He never put his thumb mark to either check. So out of the\r\nlittle pittance he got for his land, a little more than a dollar an\r\nacre, he has had stolen from him out of that $245, the sum of $232.”\r\n\r\nSeveral correspondents in the Northwest give their opinions on what\r\nshould be done, and I submit extracts from their letters.\r\n\r\n“The Government, in my judgment, should further strengthen its work in\r\nsuppressing the liquor traffic among the Indians. A large appropriation\r\nshould be asked for each year, and good, competent men should be\r\nemployed to break up the traffic. In my opinion, it is useless to\r\neducate the Indian to grow up and drink himself to death, and if the\r\nUnited States laws are too little enforced with relation to the liquor\r\ntraffic among Indians, it is not because they are not violated, but\r\nbecause the Government has not yet secured sufficient assistance to see\r\nthat the law-violators are punished.”\r\n\r\n                                        Correspondent, Pendleton, Oregon\r\n\r\n“I have always believed that unallotted Indians who have large grazing\r\nareas on their reservation should be the direct beneficiaries of their\r\nown grazing-lands and have continually urged that a reimbursable\r\nappropriation be made to stock this reservation. It has also occurred to\r\nme that the Indians should be encouraged by the use of large\r\nreimbursable appropriations to stock their allotments with tools and\r\nlivestock and I am glad that the above propositions are being actively\r\npushed as desirable propositions by the present Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs.”\r\n\r\n                                       Correspondent, Lame Deer, Montana\r\n\r\n“In my opinion, the reservation was opened seventy-five years too soon.\r\nWith the exception of a few half-breeds, they were absolutely unprepared\r\nfor the opening of the reservation. Humanly speaking, they are doomed to\r\nutter annihilation. In dealing with them, we forgot that they were\r\nsavages, and that, as it took centuries to polish our own ancestors who\r\nwere vastly more intelligent than these redmen, at least one century, or\r\none century and a half, would be required to make these people\r\ncivilized.”\r\n\r\n                                    Correspondent, St. Ignatius, Montana\r\n\r\n“When I took charge, nothing had been done for them by the Government. I\r\nat once issued agricultural implements, wire, seeds, etc., and organized\r\neach band and devoted the first efforts to agriculture on individual\r\ntracts, but worked all together as a community. By this means we raised\r\na good crop the first year, in one instance going from almost starvation\r\nto plenty in the short space of four months. Since that time not a\r\nsingle ration has been issued, and aside from supervisory work and\r\nteaching, which is given by myself and employees, all my Indians are\r\nentirely self-supporting. I am unqualifiedly and absolutely opposed to\r\nall ration and annuity distribution as it has been carried on in our\r\ndepartment. I am insisting upon all my Indians caring for and supporting\r\ntheir old people, and see that it is done. My method of helping Indians\r\nis to work both day and night to inaugurate methods and give\r\nopportunities to enable them to work out their own salvation.\r\n\r\n“I have had an unusual opportunity to work out my own ideas, by reason\r\nof beginning in a virgin field. So far I have been remarkably\r\nsuccessful. However, there is a strange characteristic apparent among\r\nall Indians, that they have apparently no sense of gratitude, and take\r\neverything that is done as a matter of course, and do not seem to have\r\nthe faculty of contrasting their situation from year to year and\r\nstriking a balance, as it were, to note their material progress.\r\n\r\n“I have no suggestions as to reforms, except those directed toward the\r\nIndian himself. In this State he is not discriminated against as in\r\nothers. Here he has nothing except his labor to tempt the cupidity of\r\nthe Whites. In the past he has been given many opportunities for\r\nimprovement through the Mormon Church, and he had the chance to become\r\njust as well off as the majority of the Mormon immigrants who came here\r\ninto the desert almost with their bare hands. So the fault, if fault it\r\nis, lies entirely with himself. He had the opportunity to observe and\r\nprofit by the example of the poor Whites who started on desert ground\r\nunder the same environment and made themselves homes; in addition to\r\nthis just as soon as the Mormon Church was able, the authorities\r\n‘called’ some of its members, sent them to each band, not as preaching\r\nmissionaries, but as farmers, and gave them tools and oxen and\r\ninstructed them how to use them. This was done with every band under my\r\njurisdiction. As these missionaries were sent without any pay, and were\r\npoor, they had their own families to support, and gradually returned to\r\nthe settlements, leaving the Indians to carry on their work themselves.\r\nThe Indians simply killed the oxen and kept up their nomadic life to a\r\ngreat extent, simply holding campgrounds on the water courses where\r\ntheir water rights have been protected by the church until I took all\r\nthe responsibilities over.”\r\n\r\n                                     Correspondent, Salt Lake City, Utah\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE CHALLENGE. NEZ PERCE WARRIOR\r\n\r\n  Copyright by L. V. McWhorter, who photographed the Indian, and permits\r\n    publication.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The immorality of our Indians, in my opinion is largely (probably\r\nseventy-five per cent) due to the presence of low Whites. Had the\r\nIndians been left alone seventy-five years longer; and had they been\r\nallowed to continue the time-honored custom of punishing crimes with the\r\nwhip—they would be today easily and surely seventy-five per cent better\r\nmen than they are. Here again we forgot that they were savages,\r\nabsolutely impervious to really noble feelings, such as honor, and that\r\nit takes time and careful training to raise them to a higher level.\r\nToday, they are incapable of feeling the shame of a prison or\r\npenitentiary. When they come back from either, they are treated as\r\nheroes. Twenty-five years ago, a whipping solemnly, modestly, and\r\nmoderately administered to those who had been guilty of thievery,\r\nadultery, fornication, gambling or drunkenness, was producing marvelous\r\nresults. Two years ago, a deputation of Kootenay Indians came to beg me\r\nto write in their name to the Great Father (the President) and ask him\r\nto allow again the use of the whip. They said, ‘Tell the Great Father\r\nthat our young men and women only laugh at the white punishments; it is\r\nthe whip and the whip alone that kept us straight, and the same\r\npunishment alone will correct the generation.’\r\n\r\n“Under the present circumstances I believe that the Government has at\r\nheart the welfare of its wards and is protecting them. There is only one\r\nflaw which I desire to bring to your notice. The real wards of the\r\nGovernment are the full-blood Indians, and they, more than the\r\nmixed-bloods, are entitled to the care of the Government, for many\r\nreasons, easy to understand; now, in point of fact, mostly all of them,\r\non this reservation, are helpless. They are, if in good health, unable\r\nto understand their real interest, and to work as they should. In\r\nmatters of business they are at the mercy of everyone who chooses to\r\ndeceive them. But the number of those who are in health is very limited.\r\nThe vast majority are old, crippled, blind or otherwise helpless. And\r\nthose, I am sorry to say, are practically left unaided. They need food,\r\nraiment, shelter, they should be supported. As it is, they are\r\npractically thrown on the charity of the white people. Though possessed\r\nof lands, they are unable to draw any profit from them. Some\r\nappropriation is made yearly for those; but it is insufficient to\r\nfurnish them with food, raiment and shelter. Means should be provided\r\nfor that purpose. They are doomed to disappear, and in justice their\r\nlast years should be made comfortable. The Government has been\r\ncollecting large sums of money from the white settlers; why not dispose\r\nof some of this money liberally for the impotent full-blood Indians who\r\nare left in destitution, instead of spending it in improving the\r\nirrigation of the reservation, which improvement will never benefit the\r\nfull-blood Indians who are disappearing, but will turn to the advantage\r\nof the mixed-bloods who have very little right to the land (some of them\r\nnone at all) and who, on account of their superior intelligence got the\r\nvery best part of the allotments at the time of the opening of the\r\nreservation. The condition of mostly all the full-bloods is pitiful. If\r\nthey have leased their lands, it takes them an age to receive their\r\nmoney, the local Agent having no authority to disburse it, and the\r\nIndian Bureau being very slow in granting it. It seems to me that\r\nprovision should be made in favor of destitute Indians to have them\r\nreceive monthly some food, and a small sum of money to provide\r\nthemselves with clothes, also to have them provided with decent houses\r\nand with fuel when they cannot get it themselves. No one but those who\r\nlive on the spot have any idea of the privations which this class of\r\nfull-bloods have to submit to, through no fault of theirs. It seems to\r\nme that this evil could easily be remedied. Some people seem to think\r\nthat a monthly sum of money, $20, should be paid to each destitute\r\nIndian, with which he could easily provide for his needs; but knowing\r\nthem as I do, I would prefer to see them receive only $10 or even $5\r\nwith rations, for if they get more money, they will spend it all in the\r\nfirst days of the month.”[49]\r\n\r\n                                   Correspondent, St. Augustins, Montana\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  NOTE—A very interesting book, “Life Among the Pai-utes,” was written\r\n  by Sarah Winnemucca in the early ’80’s. This presents an account of\r\n  the Nez Perce, Bannock and other wars from the Indian point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHAPTER XXVI. HEALTH OF THE INDIANS 1880 TO 1912\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Indians of the present time are in a deplorable condition as to\r\nhealth, no person familiar with Indian affairs will deny. It is\r\nincomprehensible to me that the appropriations for combatting disease\r\nare so meagre, and the appropriations for allotting and education so\r\nlavish. As a western friend of mine, who had observed Indians for more\r\nthan thirty years says, “Of what use is education to an Indian with\r\nconsumption? An Indian child learns to read and write, contracts\r\ntrachoma, is sent home and goes blind. How does education benefit the\r\nblind Indian?”\r\n\r\nDoctor Ales Hrdlicka of the Smithsonian Institution recently made an\r\ninvestigation of health conditions among the Indians. His report is\r\nstatistical in character, and will be found in Bulletin 42, Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, 1909.\r\n\r\nFollowing this, the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service made a\r\nthorough investigation in 1912–13 of health conditions among the Indians\r\nand published another statistical report, “Contagious and Infectious\r\nDiseases Among the Indians”, Document No. 1038, 62nd Congress, 3d\r\nSession. Investigations were conducted in twenty-five states by\r\ncompetent corps of medical observers. No trachoma was found in Florida.\r\nAmong the New York Indians there was but .2 of one per cent; Wisconsin\r\n6.86 per cent. In the other states the percentages rise rapidly,\r\nreaching 15.5 per cent in Minnesota; 22.38 per cent in New Mexico; 24.9\r\nper cent in Arizona; 68.72 per cent in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nAs to tuberculosis, but 1.27 per cent was observed among the New York\r\nIndians. But the investigation set forth in the Public Health report\r\nrelated mainly to trachoma and there were limitations placed on\r\ntuberculosis research.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SANATORIUM SCHOOL, FORT LAPWAI, IDAHO\r\n\r\n  No. 1.

In Minnesota alone, in 1909, I found the greater\r\nmajority of the Indians suffering from tuberculosis, trachoma, or some\r\nform of scrofulous disease. It is not necessary to go into this subject\r\nin any detail. That disease among these poor people is rampant, is\r\ninexcusable. It is heart-rending. It is a blot on our escutcheon, and\r\nshould have been removed long ago. Whether the delay in establishing\r\npreventive measures, until trachoma and tuberculosis became widespread,\r\nis due to ignorance, incompetency or carelessness, it is not my purpose\r\nto state. I have high respect for the personnel of the medical branch of\r\nthe Service. The fault is not theirs, but solely due to meagre\r\nappropriations, and lack of proper reports from the inspection corps. I\r\nsimply desire to cover this unpleasant subject with a blanket statement\r\nof facts that the condition is intolerable, and all of us have been\r\ncriminally negligent. We introduced tuberculosis, trachoma, smallpox,\r\nmeasles, diphtheria and most of the other diseases. If any man or woman\r\ndoubts the statement, let him or her read the narratives of travelers\r\namong Indians two centuries ago and compare the condition then, with\r\nthat today. There is no earthly excuse why instead of three or four,\r\nthere should not be fifteen or twenty doctors on every reservation.\r\nThere is no reason why our rich, powerful Government does not\r\nappropriate two or three million dollars a year to put an end to the\r\nmiseries we ourselves have introduced.\r\n\r\nPersons of prominence have called attention to the spread of disease in\r\npast years. Commissioner Leupp first noted that health conditions were\r\nbad, and increased his medical corps. But his successor, Honorable R. G.\r\nValentine, made a health campaign the chief thing of his administration.\r\nHe went before Congress and plead for increased appropriations. Great\r\ncredit is due him for his humane efforts, which are continued by the\r\npresent Service head, Mr. Sells.\r\n\r\nBefore the Government awoke to the need of health protection, a\r\ngentleman in California was a pioneer in the fight against disease. He\r\nhas lived to see the fruits of his planting, but for many years his\r\nvoice was that of one crying in the wilderness, and few there were who\r\nthought of repentance. I refer to Charles F. Lummis, Esq., an authority\r\nupon the Pueblo and California Indians. Mr. Lummis has written me a long\r\nletter in which he sets forth the difficulties under which he labored,\r\nand how that he was roundly denounced because he opposed the scheme of\r\ntaking children accustomed to open-air life, shipping them East,\r\ncrowding them into contract schools—thus making of strong, healthy boys\r\nand girls, consumptives. Lummis fought—not education, but this\r\npernicious and wicked policy. Some of his experiences were interesting.\r\nHe speaks of the former school conditions, and I take it that his\r\nstrictures do not apply to the past two or three years.\r\n\r\n“It is obvious that to take children from the high, dry climate of New\r\nMexico and the general Southwest, back to the Eastern winters and to\r\nsteam-heated halls, can have but one effect. That is no theory. I have\r\nseen the practical workings for more than a quarter of a century; and it\r\nis my sincere conviction that Carlisle and similar schools away from\r\nhome have graduated more consumptives and more sons and daughters\r\nforever alienated from their parents and kin, than they have produced of\r\nscholars or other people seriously useful in any walk of life.\r\n\r\n“I do know that thirty years ago consumption was almost unknown in most\r\nof the Pueblos in New Mexico. I do know that the first consumptive\r\nPueblo I ever saw was from Carlisle; and that most of the consumptive\r\nIndians that I have known in my thirty years acquaintance with New\r\nMexico have come back thus infected from these Eastern Government\r\nSchools”.\r\n\r\n“At a meeting of the National Educational Association in this city in\r\nJuly, 1899, I had a serious clash with a distinguished Indian educator.\r\nAn Indian convention was held in conjunction with the N. E. A. I was\r\nbusy; but seeing the daily reports finally became so incensed at the\r\ninhuman and stupid proceedings, that on the last day I went to the\r\nConvention and took the floor almost by force, after listening to most\r\nof the afternoon’s proceedings.\r\n\r\n“This man had with him two very charming and well-schooled Indians—a\r\nyoung man and a young woman, who were called up by him to answer some of\r\nmy strictures as to the Carlisle methods. And they made eloquent and\r\nloyal defences. The audience (being as unobservant as American audiences\r\ngenerally are) were very much surprised when in my reply I called\r\nattention to the fact that the two model students that Mr. Educator\r\nbrought with him were both consumptives, and I asked him point blank if\r\nthey were consumptive when they entered Carlisle.\r\n\r\n“Of course I got no answer—and I was lucky in getting out of the hall\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\n LOS ANGELES, SEPT. 14TH, 1914.\r\n\r\nDoctor Ales Hrdlicka, in the year 1908, acting for the Indian Office and\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution, investigated health conditions with\r\nreference to tuberculosis among five selected tribes of the United\r\nStates. On page 7 of the report Doctor Hrdlicka states:—\r\n\r\n“The investigations on which this report is based were pursued in five\r\nof the tribes, shown in the above-mentioned data to be most afflicted\r\nwith tuberculosis, and in one of the large non-reservation schools. The\r\ntribes in question are the Menominee in northeastern Wisconsin; the\r\nOglala Sioux in South Dakota; the Quinaielt on the seacoast and along\r\nthe river of the same name in northwestern Washington; the Hupa in\r\nnorthwestern California; and the Mohave, on the Colorado river between\r\nNeedles, Cal., and Yuma, Ariz. These tribes were selected not only\r\nbecause of the prevalence among them of tuberculosis, but also because\r\nthey live under widely differing conditions of climate, environment,\r\ncivilization, and contact with the Whites. The school visited is the one\r\nat Phoenix, Arizona. The investigation was carried on during the two\r\nmonths of midsummer when people everywhere are most free from the\r\nvarious bronchial and pulmonary affections that might complicate a\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\n“On account of the short time available, and the extensive ground to be\r\ncovered, the study had to be limited to what was most essential toward\r\nobtaining reliable statistics. In the smaller tribes, as the Hupa and\r\nthe Mohave, nearly all the dwellings were visited, and all the members\r\nof the tribe who were not far distant were studied. In the larger\r\ntribes, as the Menominee and the Oglala, the examinations were limited\r\nto one hundred families. Among the Oglala, these one hundred families\r\nincluded only full-bloods, who in this tribe suffer more from\r\ntuberculosis than do the half-breeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AGED WOMAN NEARLY BLIND FROM TRACHOMA\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The actual work consisted in visiting the dwellings consecutively and\r\nmaking a personal examination of each member of every family, healthy or\r\nnot healthy. In many families absent members were brought from many\r\nmiles away by the Indians themselves for examination. This examination\r\nembraced the lungs, heart, glands of the neck, and skeleton, and was\r\nsupplemented by inquiries. * * *\r\n\r\n“The investigation was everywhere promoted by the Indians themselves,\r\nwho welcomed an inquiry into the disease which is decimating them, the\r\ngravity of which they well appreciate, but against which they feel\r\nutterly helpless.” * * *\r\n\r\nHe found the Oglala Sioux, of Pine Ridge reservation, numbering 6,663,\r\nvery susceptible to tuberculosis; the number of individuals in a\r\nthousand affected with pulmonary tuberculosis being 30.8, bones and\r\njoints 6.8, and glandular 57.7. The highest number of persons suffering\r\nfrom this disease was found among the Hupa Indians of California, where\r\nthe number of individuals per thousand arose to 60.4, pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\n“In regard to civilization, the Oglala are in the transition period,\r\nwhich generally means partial degeneration. They live in small or\r\nfair-sized log houses of one room, each provided with one or two small\r\nwindows that are never opened. The houses have earthen floors and sod\r\nroofs. In summer almost every family constructs from poles and boughs,\r\nor from young pine trees, a more or less open shelter in which, while it\r\nis warm, they spend most of their time. Usually, each family has also a\r\nlight, easily portable tent, which represents the ancient tipi. These\r\ntents are erected near the house and are occupied by the aged, by some\r\nrelative or visitor of the family, or serve to sleep in. When the family\r\nleaves home, such a tent is packed, together with bedding, kitchen\r\nutensils, etc., into the wagon, and is pitched whenever a stop is made\r\nfor the night. Indeed, there will be at times one or more villages of\r\nthese tents near the agency, or about a house where some particular\r\nfeast is being given. In summer these tents are oppressively hot during\r\nthe day, though they become cool if the sides are raised. As they are\r\nmade of very light fabric, they are cold at night, and afford but poor\r\nprotection during a severe rain or hail storm, as the writer personally\r\nexperienced. * * *\r\n\r\n“As to clothing, the Oglala now dress like the Whites in most respects,\r\nthough the majority still persist in wearing moccasins. The women wear\r\nleggings and always a blanket or shawl when going about. A tendency to\r\nwear too much clothing, even on the hottest day, was again noticed and\r\nis very prevalent. This is due partly to ignorance and partly to vanity.\r\nThe garments are usually far from clean. The writer learned of several\r\ninstances in which the clothing of tuberculous persons was given or sold\r\nto others.\r\n\r\n“In diet the Sioux are chiefly meat eaters, the principal kind of meat\r\nconsumed being beef. They cook this fresh, or cut it into strips and dry\r\nit on cords stretched outside their dwellings. Other common articles of\r\ndiet are badly made wheat bread and large quantities of coffee. When\r\nthey have money they purchase crackers and canned foods. They eat very\r\nirregularly, both as to time and quantity. During feasts and when\r\nvisitors are present, they not infrequently use the same wooden spoon or\r\nother utensil, one after another, and eat from the same dish, the bones\r\nand other remnants being freely strewn over the floor.\r\n\r\n“In many of the dwellings it was seen that the denizens lack in both\r\nquantity and quality of food on account of their poverty. * * * Numerous\r\ncases were seen where the whole meal consisted of a few crackers and\r\nblack coffee. In several instances cattle which had died of disease had\r\nbeen consumed, both flesh and viscera. According to the resident\r\nphysician, Doctor Walker, the Oglala eat not only cattle but even horses\r\nand dogs that die of disease. The people are not emaciated; in fact,\r\nmany look well nourished. Yet there is no doubt that many do not\r\nreceive, except on rare occasions, all the nourishment they require.\r\nThis doubtless induces indolence and disease. It would also strongly\r\npromote the spread of alcoholism, but fortunately there are very few\r\nchances for obtaining liquor on or near the reservation.\r\n\r\n“Few of the Oglala men have any steady occupation. They do very little\r\nfarming. During the summer they cut some hay in the valleys, which\r\nbrings fair prices. Cattle and horses are being distributed by the\r\nGovernment to the different families, and stock-raising is being\r\nencouraged with some success. * * *\r\n\r\n“The people of this tribe are quite shrewd, tractable, and glad to be\r\ninstructed, though the instruction given does not always have practical\r\nresults. Their most striking peculiarities are the above-mentioned\r\ntendency to a seminomadic life and the disinclination to steady manual\r\nwork. They are very ignorant of all matters regarding hygiene. One of\r\nthe most reprehensible customs among them is the so-called ‘passing of\r\nthe pipe.’ Whenever a number of men have gathered in a house, there is\r\npassed from mouth to mouth a lighted pipe, the mouthpiece of which is\r\nnever cleaned. As there is often in such a group an individual in the\r\nearlier stages of consumption, the habit must be regarded as providing a\r\ndirect mode of infection with the disease.”[50]\r\n\r\nThis description of the Oglala Sioux by Doctor Hrdlicka, who is one of\r\nour most expert and competent scientists, might well be applied to other\r\nbands and tribes of Indians in the transition period. As has been\r\nsuggested elsewhere, it emphasizes the immediate need of larger\r\nappropriations, the employment of numerous physicians and sanitary\r\nofficials, if we would save the full-blood Indians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A TUBERCULOSIS PATIENT. BEDDING COVERED WITH FLIES\r\n]\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph A. Murphy is medical supervisor of the Indian Service, and a\r\nmore competent man cannot be found. I have received a number of reports\r\ncovering his activities the past two years. That the Indians are\r\nsuffering, is no fault of Dr. Murphy’s, or his assistants. He has\r\nrecently established hospitals and increased the medical corps. If the\r\npresent ratio of increase in physicians and buildings continues, much\r\nalleviation will result.\r\n\r\nDark as is our picture, recently it has become brighter. The past two\r\nyears conditions have greatly improved. There are more adequate\r\nappropriations. But this realization of our responsibilities at a late\r\nday, does not absolve us from past responsibility. We had been\r\nrepeatedly told—nay, warned of the consequences, yet we continued our\r\n“same old story, in the same old way,” until the white people living in\r\nIndian communities complained. Now, when Indians complain we pay little\r\nheed, but when the representatives of the white people cry, “menace to\r\npublic health”, we heed and we speedily send help to allay the fears of\r\nthe good and substantial citizens. The appeal from Macedonia is not\r\nuttered in vain.\r\n\r\nWe now have hospitals building, and they may take care of a third of the\r\nsick. We also enforce stricter sanitary laws. So we may look forward to\r\nsaving some of those who suffer from the “coughing sickness”, and as to\r\nthe other scourge, it is so contagious that heroic measures have been\r\nadopted, and the light will not go out forever from Indian children’s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nI present two field reports, sent by competent observers who traveled\r\nextensively in Wisconsin and Oklahoma, and both of whom have long\r\nresided among Indians there.\r\n\r\n“When I came to the Lake Superior country in 1878, I found the Indians\r\nof Lac Courte Oreille Reservation and of Lac du Flambeau, living almost\r\nentirely in birch-bark wigwams, also in Bad River Reserve, near Ashland,\r\nWis. In Courte Oreille, I counted about six log houses, mostly inhabited\r\nby French half-breeds. In Bad River Reserve (now Odanah) perhaps about\r\nthe same number; in Lac du Flambeau also about six log houses. But as\r\nsoon as the Indians got their pine-money and their allotments, they\r\nimmediately began to build houses, many of which were large and\r\ncommodious. Others were of hewn logs, rather small and low and very\r\nunhealthy on that account, as there was very little ventilation, and in\r\nthe winter they would be huddled together, most of them sleeping on the\r\nfloor in a blanket, or poor bedclothes. The stove was very hot until\r\nafter the fire went out, when, of course, towards morning they would be\r\nshivering with the cold. Cooking, smoking, living, in such a small room\r\nwould naturally cause colds, and consumption. This may be justly called\r\n_the Indian’s Disease_, as it is the most common sickness of which they\r\ndie; they generally die of consumption, brought on by their total\r\ndisregard of the laws of health. Sugar-making early in spring, when they\r\nused to gather the maple-sap in the woods, walking in the wet snow and\r\ncold water, shod with soft moccasins, made of deerskin, and not much\r\nbetter than common stockings; then went the whole day with wet feet—this\r\nno doubt laid for many, the seeds of future consumption. Then, gathering\r\ncranberries in swamps, wading in the water for hours and hours, was also\r\nhighly unhealthy. Their cooking was also very poor. Bread, tea, and pork\r\ntheir principal food, the bread badly made, hard and heavy. The Indian’s\r\nnatural home is the woods, like that of the deer; the white man’s\r\nnatural home is the clearing, in open country. Civilization is coming on\r\nthe Indian too fast—it effeminates and weakens him. The Indian woman is\r\nnaturally industrious, the Indian man is lazy; that’s about the way to\r\nput it.\r\n\r\n“The Franciscans in California solved the Indian problem in the best and\r\nmost practical way: they first made Christians—and then civilized the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\n                                           Correspondent, Bayfield, Wis.\r\n\r\n“Surrounded by wretched conditions, it is not surprising that the\r\nincidence of tuberculosis, trachoma, and other diseases is large among\r\nthese Indians. Although tuberculosis can hardly be considered as\r\nprevalent here as among some of the other reservation tribes, it\r\nnevertheless occurs to an alarming extent. It appears to be more\r\nprevalent in some localities than in others, and, in some sections,\r\nseems to be on the increase. The home conditions of many of these\r\nIndians are such that, if a case of tuberculosis or other infectious\r\ndisease occurs in a household, the probability is that the disease will,\r\nin time, go through the entire family.\r\n\r\n“During my drive among the Cherokee full-bloods, probably forty families\r\nwere visited, many of which either have, or have not, one or more cases\r\nof tuberculosis. In the vicinity of Barber, twenty miles from Talequah,\r\nthere occurred three deaths from tuberculosis within three weeks of the\r\ntime of my visit. Two of the cases, one a baby in the arms and the other\r\na woman, the head of the family, were seen by me. The latter case was\r\nparticularly pathetic and deserves special mention. The sick woman,\r\ndying of tuberculosis, was found in the one room of the house, which,\r\nthough small, illy ventilated, and poorly lighted, was occupied by nine\r\nother people, including six small children. Being wholly ignorant of the\r\ndangerous and infectious nature of the disease, this condition continued\r\nuntil the death of the patient, which occurred two weeks later. Another\r\nfamily visited, had lost three members from tuberculosis within the past\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\n“When the housing conditions encountered here are taken into\r\nconsideration, it seems remarkable that tuberculosis does not spread\r\namong the people even more rapidly than it does. This can be partially\r\nexplained, however, by the fact that they are sometimes widely\r\nscattered, the houses, in many instances, being several miles apart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NATIONAL INDIAN ASSOCIATION HOSPITAL AT INDIAN WELLS, ARIZONA\r\n]\r\n\r\n“In another family near the little village of Eucha, a girl fourteen or\r\nfifteen years of age was seen to wipe her trachomatous eyes with the end\r\nof a shawl, worn about her mother’s head. The mother held a young baby\r\nin her arms, and it would seem that a failure to infect the baby’s eyes\r\nwith the contaminated shawl would be nothing short of marvelous.\r\n\r\n“The civilizing influences that surround these people are far from good.\r\nThe class of people that are frequently found as neighbors are a\r\nshiftless, undesirable class. These Whites live amidst unsanitary,\r\nmeagre surroundings. It is due to this class of citizens that the use of\r\ncocaine has of recent years assumed alarming proportions. This habit has\r\nbecome quite common among the full-bloods in some sections, and I heard\r\nof several deaths that were attributed directly to this cause.\r\n\r\n“The use of alcoholic liquor is, no doubt, a positive detriment to the\r\nChoctaw Indians, particularly in those districts close to the Arkansas\r\nborder. Many crimes have been committed among the Indians that can be\r\nattributed directly to the use of liquor, given to them by unscrupulous\r\nbootleggers from across the border.\r\n\r\n“Trachoma appears to be even more universal among the Creeks and\r\nSeminoles than it is among the Indians farther south, and many cases are\r\nobserved. Trachoma is, no doubt, a positive menace to the usefulness and\r\nwell-being of many of these people, and should be met by a vigorous\r\ncampaign for its control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIAN CABIN, NORTH DAKOTA\r\n\r\n  Six of the seven inmates had trachoma.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The native medicine man appears to play a more important part among the\r\nCreeks and Seminoles than among the other Indians of the Five Civilized\r\nTribes. The full-blood Indians seldom call on the local white physician\r\nfor treatment, but depend almost entirely upon their own medicine men,\r\nand the use of patent remedies, purchased at the local country stores.\r\nSeveral bottles of a patent consumption “cure” were seen in a number of\r\nhomes visited.\r\n\r\n“After a careful survey of the conditions existing among the full-blood\r\nIndians of the Five Civilized Tribes, it seems highly important that\r\nthere should be a well-organized system of medical treatment provided.\r\nTuberculosis and trachoma, the two most important diseases to be\r\ncombatted among Indians generally prevail among these people to an\r\nalarming extent, and both appear to be steadily on the increase. It is\r\nunquestionably true that many of these Indians sicken and die without\r\nany medical aid whatever. Many of them are too poor to employ white\r\nphysicians, with the result that the physician is either not called at\r\nall, or only when it is too late to be of any avail.\r\n\r\n“Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the need for hospital\r\nfacilities for these Indians. There is, at present, no place available\r\nin which to place the needy sick except in local city hospitals. This\r\nnecessarily entails considerable expense on the individual and, in many\r\ninstances, there is a prejudice against going away from their homes to\r\nenter a strange hospital. The several sanitariums throughout the Service\r\nare usually already filled beyond their capacity, and it is seldom\r\npossible to secure their admission to the institutions.\r\n\r\n“In view of the extremely unsanitary conditions existing in many of the\r\nfull-blood homes throughout the Five Civilized Tribes, it would appear\r\nthat field matrons would here find a large field for usefulness. The\r\npeople with whom she comes in contact are easy of approach and\r\ntractable. They are also readily susceptible to teaching, and would, no\r\ndoubt, welcome the assistance that the field matron would be able to\r\ngive.”\r\n\r\n                                          Correspondent, Muskogee, Okla.\r\n\r\n  Five Civilized Tribes.

Pages\r\n  11–14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXVII. THE INDIAN’S RELIGION; HIS CHARACTER; PHILANTHROPIC\r\n                             ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1850, the Indian’s belief in the hereafter has undergone a very\r\nmarked change. It is extremely difficult to find individuals, among most\r\nof our tribes, who can give us any clear conception of the Indian’s\r\nreligious belief. The Navaho preserve much of their original religion,\r\nfor the reason that these Indians have been remote from contact with the\r\nWhites. As has been stated in this book, the greater part of the 28,000\r\nNavaho do not speak English and continue in the faith of their fathers.\r\nThere are also scattered tribes or bands of other Indians who keep up,\r\nto a greater or less degree, their religious belief, have confidence in\r\ntheir shamans, and resort to the white men’s ministers and doctors only\r\nunder compulsion. But while this is true, the vast bulk of our Indians\r\ntoday have adopted the God of our Bible, and recognize his opposite, the\r\nevil spirit. If one takes the pains to read a number of the reports of\r\ncompetent ethnologists who have studied the religious activities of\r\nvarious tribes recently, one is impressed with the complications\r\npresented. In fact, it is no reflection on these able and competent\r\nworkers and observers to state that it is extremely difficult (if not\r\nimpossible) to cover the Indian’s religious belief in one blanket\r\nparagraph or statement. Beliefs vary among different tribes, and we must\r\ngo far back of the year 1850 would we find primitive American religion,\r\npracticed in its purity. We cannot now affirm that the religious life of\r\nall tribes is the same; that the deities and spirits are alike.\r\n\r\nGenerally throughout the United States the tradition of the Thunder Bird\r\nobtains, and it typifies the supernatural. In the desert areas, water is\r\nmore precious than soil, or any other necessity. It is therefore quite\r\nnatural that the Earth Mother and Water Spirit enter very largely into\r\nthe religion of that region. Some of the older Sioux, even in recent\r\ntimes, believed in spirits, or ghosts, and any Sioux man or woman having\r\nheard the calling of the ghosts at night, prepared himself (or herself)\r\nto join his ancestors in the spirit world. Major McLaughlin presents one\r\nor two instances in his book[51] where Indians have actually given up,\r\ntaken to their beds and died, firm in the belief that the ghosts were\r\ncalling.\r\n\r\nDoctor Eastman in his remarkable book, “The Soul of the Indian,” defines\r\nthat indefinite thing, the belief in the supernatural, in a beautiful\r\nand striking manner.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of religion among Indian tribes comprehends mythology,\r\nshamanism, totemism, and the taboo. There is so great variance among the\r\ndifferent linguistic stocks as to belief in the supernatural, religious\r\nrites and incantations, that one must study extensively did one desire\r\nto obtain any clear conception of ancient Indian religion. In fact, the\r\nsubject is so beset by uncertainties that we may well omit a\r\nconsideration of it from this volume. Pure Indian religion—generally\r\nspeaking—does not exist in the transition period of today.\r\n\r\nWe may defer to scientific workers the conflicting beliefs among Indians\r\nof the present. The labors of the missionaries, both Catholic and\r\nProtestant, have instilled into the minds of the Indians the teaching of\r\nour Scriptures. Missionary labors, having continued for more than two\r\ncenturies, (and three centuries in some parts of the country) have had\r\ntheir effect, and as I stated above, the Indian today believes as do\r\nourselves. As I pointed out in referring to Miss Densmore’s excellent\r\nstudy of Ojibwa music (_page 20_) all the investigators invariably seek\r\nout the older Indians and glean from them such fragments as remain of\r\nthe Indians’ former faith. We never hear of ethnologists talking to\r\neducated Indians, and recording their opinions.\r\n\r\nAmong the Navaho, the taboo is more strongly pronounced than, possibly,\r\namong other tribes. The totem and the phratry doubtless had their origin\r\nin certain religious beliefs. But these are not observed today, to any\r\nappreciable extent outside of the Navaho and the scattered bands\r\nreferred to. We must consider, in studying the Indian of the transition\r\nperiod, not the exceptions, but that which predominates. This has been\r\nmy aim. Many of the lesser important customs and taboo (bordering upon\r\nthe religious side of the Indians’ nature) obtain. As an illustration,\r\nthe taboo against the mother-in-law is still in effect in many places.\r\nAlso, certain rites are performed when a death occurs. Such are clearly\r\nsurvivals of more primitive beliefs.\r\n\r\nIn a general review of the Indians’ religion it must be admitted that\r\nwhile our missionaries and teachers have converted thousands of Indians\r\nand these are today faithful members of churches and missions, it is\r\ndoubtful if the bulk of our 330,000 red brothers has been improved\r\nspiritually by contact with the white people. I have presented\r\nsufficient number of specific instances in this book to prove that where\r\nthey meet one missionary, priest or teacher, they come in contact with a\r\ndozen white persons ranking spiritually and morally far below American\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nAlong with the Indian’s religion, he possessed a high sense of honor, or\r\nresponsibility, and integrity. Judge Thomas, long a resident of\r\nOklahoma, informed me of cases wherein Indians under sentence of death,\r\nwere permitted by the authorities to visit distant villages for a few\r\ndays. There are a number of such instances on record. The Indians\r\ninvariably returned and were executed according to law. This occurred\r\nmany years ago. If any modern Indian, or white man under sentence of\r\ndeath, was released by the authorities, it is doubtful if he would\r\nconsider himself bound to keep his word.\r\n\r\nBecause the Indian was cruel to his enemies, it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that he was bad. Among every band there were bad and wild young\r\nmen who could not be restrained. This has been admitted in the testimony\r\nof Red Cloud, Spotted Tail, and many other prominent Indians. Red Cloud,\r\nfrom the Indian point of view, considered it no more cruel to kill his\r\nenemies than for us to compel people to work as slaves. He heard we made\r\nwomen and children labor from daylight to dark. This, as well as our\r\nlong hours for mill-hands and laborers, he considered cruelty. He\r\nindicated this in a conversation with me many years ago. One of the\r\nprominent Southwestern Indians, when asked by Colonel Dodge, “Why are\r\nyou Indians so cruel?” cited many things of common occurrence among\r\nwhite people which were considered perfectly proper by them, but which\r\nthe Indians would not tolerate. It all depends on one’s point of view.\r\nIn condemning Indians for cruelties, we must remember that the\r\npatriarchs of the Old Testament, in the name of religion, destroyed more\r\ninnocent persons in a few of their wars than have the Indians in all of\r\ntheir wars.\r\n\r\nI do not agree with the widespread belief that through our general\r\neducation of Indians, we have raised their moral and religious tone. We\r\nhave improved some thousands, but the greater number of Indians,\r\nobserving from the treatment accorded them that we do not practice what\r\nwe preach, have less realization of their responsibilities and exhibit\r\nless integrity than formerly. A letter addressed to the average Indian\r\ntrader who has done business with Indians more than twenty years, will\r\nbring a reply to the effect that their business obligations were more\r\nfaithfully kept in the past than at present.\r\n\r\nAs to missionary endeavor among the Indians during the past sixty years,\r\nI find that there are upwards of fifty Protestant denominations who\r\nmaintain mission stations in various parts of the Indian country. These\r\ninclude every denomination, but those most prominent are the\r\nPresbyterians, Baptists, Friends, Congregationalists, Methodists,\r\nEpiscopalians, Moravians, Lutherans. In addition there are the Home\r\nMissionary Associations (interdenominational) and the National Indian\r\nAssociation. It is impracticable to present details of their work. The\r\nNational Indian Association is one of the strongest of these bodies, and\r\nwas organized thirty-five years ago. It has fifty-two stations scattered\r\nthroughout the West, and some idea of its good work may be had by the\r\nillustration presented of the Good Samaritan hospital maintained at\r\nIndian Wells, Arizona. (_page 275_).\r\n\r\nThe educational and humanitarian work of the Association has been the\r\nhelping to right political wrongs; gathering of Indian children into\r\nschools; stimulating and preparing capable Indians for wise leadership\r\namong their people; loans of money to Indians to enable them to build\r\nhomes or to carry on business. The Association has done a large and\r\ninfluential educational work, and through its Home Building and Loan\r\nDepartment has enabled Indians to build homes which have become\r\ncivilizing centers of family life. It has also made loans to Indians for\r\nthe purchase of implements of labor or for stock needed to begin some\r\nuseful and paying industry. By such methods the Association seeks to put\r\nthe Indian in a position to earn his own living and to become\r\nself-supporting and self-reliant. It has maintained library, temperance,\r\nhospital, and other departments; trained Indian young women as nurses,\r\nand assisted Indian young men and women to obtain training as physicians\r\nand teachers, some of whom have long been working to help their own\r\npeople. The Cambridge (Mass.) branch of this organization is especially\r\nactive and has contributed generously. The work of the missions\r\nmaintained by the Congregationalists, Episcopalians, Baptists,\r\nMethodists, etc., comprehends general religious education and charitable\r\nwork among the Indians.\r\n\r\nRev. Thomas C. Moffett, Chairman of the committee on Indian work of the\r\n“home missions council”, has just published an interesting book\r\nentitled, “The American Indian on the New Trail.” This presents an\r\nexcellent review of missionary labors among Indians, including much of a\r\nstatistical character. The review is broad, and covers the entire United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Catholic Missions, Washington, has in charge the many\r\nmissions maintained by the Catholics. I have visited a number of these\r\nin various parts of the West, along with the Protestant missions, and\r\nfind most of them well equipped and doing splendid work.\r\n\r\nThe California Indian Association has concerned itself more with the\r\nsecuring of homes for dispossessed Indians. In Chapter XXXI, dealing\r\nwith California conditions, the secretary, Mr. C. E. Kelsey, has\r\ncommented on the work of the association.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Rights Association is the most famous of all the benevolent\r\norganizations. Organized in 1882, its work has grown and expanded until\r\nat the present time its activities cover most of the reservations of the\r\nUnited States. It has frequently been in sharp conflict with the Indian\r\nOffice, but at the present time the relations between Commissioner Sells\r\nand his able assistants and this and other organizations, are most\r\nfriendly and helpful. The pamphlet, covering the activities of the\r\norganization, the number of steals of land it has prevented, the reforms\r\ninstituted, dishonest employees forced out of the Service and all other\r\nrecommendations, covers some hundred or more instances and places.\r\n\r\nIts corresponding secretary, Mr. Mathew K. Sniffen, returned from Alaska\r\nin September of this year, after having spent three months investigating\r\nthe most deplorable condition of the Alaska Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Industries League of Boston was organized in 1901 and has\r\ndone much to encourage arts and industries among certain Indian tribes.\r\nIt does not attempt to do missionary work, although it has educated a\r\nnumber of Indians. In recent years the League has held fairs and\r\ndisposed of large quantities of blankets, baskets, bead work, etc., thus\r\naiding many old Indian women in New Mexico, California, Washington and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nI have always been a believer in the work of these organizations, and I\r\nhave no criticism, but rather a suggestion to offer. The missionary and\r\nother organizations had a great opportunity for good during the Messiah\r\ncraze, and with one accord they let it pass. At the Lake Mohonk\r\nConference this year, a minister from South Dakota spoke of the evil\r\neffects of the Messiah craze. In Chapters IX-XI I have described it.\r\nThere were no evil effects until the troops and Sitting Bull dominated.\r\nHad the missionaries seized upon the religious mania when it began, they\r\nmight have turned it to good account. It was, at first, a purely\r\nreligious ceremony of high and noble type.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indians of Oklahoma there is great religious activity. Last\r\nyear I met many native preachers, and heard of numerous meetings at\r\nvarious campgrounds. I was surprised at the extent of these, and the\r\nnumber of Indians attending such gatherings. The meetings may be a\r\ntrifle sentimental, but the intentions of the worshippers are excellent.\r\nHere is presented a great field for missionary labors, and if the good\r\npeople would take full advantage of it, a lasting impression and the\r\nfurtherance of religious activity would ensue.\r\n\r\nThe modern missionary spirit among most of the workers in the field has\r\nchanged in recent years. There is more medical activity, more endeavor\r\nto stimulate interest in fairs, school exhibitions, etc. Thus the\r\nIndians are brought nearer the real life and spirit of the missions,\r\nthan in the older days where on stated intervals they were assembled for\r\nworship. Aside from mere biblical instruction little was done for them.\r\nThis was all right and proper, but the Indian needed more.\r\n\r\nThe most potent influence in shaping public opinion, with reference to\r\nIndian affairs the past thirty years, has been the annual Conference of\r\nFriends of the Indian and Other Dependent Peoples held each year at Lake\r\nMohonk. This was begun in 1882 by Honorable Albert K. Smiley. Since Mr.\r\nSmiley’s death, the conferences are continued by Honorable Daniel\r\nSmiley.\r\n\r\nAt these conferences are assembled men and women from the United States,\r\nEurope and Canada interested in Indian affairs, the Philippines, etc.\r\nThe conference consists of addresses by persons familiar with Indian\r\ntopics, which are followed by general discussion. For two or three years\r\nthe conference seemed to its friends to be somewhat dominated by the\r\nIndian Office, but a few years ago it became again a real open\r\nparliament. Conflicting views are often expressed, and both the dark and\r\nthe bright sides of our Indian picture are presented. The conference\r\nlast year was devoted almost exclusively to a discussion of Oklahoma\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nAn annual report is published and circulated throughout the world. The\r\nmeetings have been productive of a great deal of good. Those who attend\r\nare invited as the personal guests of Mr. and Mrs. Smiley and enjoy the\r\nprivileges of their magnificent estate in the heart of the Catskills,\r\nwhile attending the conference.\r\n\r\nThe Society of American Indians was organized at Ohio State University\r\nin 1911. It came into being in response to a feeling on the part of the\r\neducated Indians of the country that the “Indian problem” could best be\r\nsolved through an awakening of the race itself, through its leaders, in\r\ncooperation with white friends.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the society is due to the efforts of Prof. F. A.\r\nMcKenzie of Ohio State University. The founders of the Society were such\r\nmen and women as Dr. Charles A. Eastman (Sioux), Dr. Carlos Montezuma\r\n(Apache), Rev. Sherman Coolidge (Arapaho), Laura Cornelius (Oneida),\r\nHenry Standing Bear (Sioux), Charles E. Dagenett (Peoria), Rosa B.\r\nLaFlesche (Chippewa), Arthur C. Parker (Seneca), Thomas L. Sloan\r\n(Omaha), Emma D. Goulette (Potawatomie), Marie L. Baldwin (Chippewa),\r\nHenry Roe-Cloud (Winnebago), and Hiram Chase (Omaha).\r\n\r\nThe high stand taken by the Society and its elimination of all selfish\r\nmotives led to an unqualified endorsement of its objects by the most\r\nearnest friends of the Indian in this country and in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Society though only four years old has a membership of about 1500.\r\nHundreds of the most progressive Indians in the country are members and\r\nalmost all trades and professions are represented. More than 500\r\ncitizens of the white race, including both men and women, are associate\r\nmembers of the Society. Most of them have for years demonstrated their\r\nearnest and unselfish interest in the welfare of the Indian and have now\r\nunited their interests with the Indian.\r\n\r\nThe Society is not connected with any other organization. It is governed\r\nentirely by its own membership and has no connection with the Indian\r\nBureau or the Government. Indians and their friends of every shade of\r\nopinion are members.\r\n\r\nThe Society of American Indians seeks to bring about better conditions\r\nso that the Indian may develop normally as an American people in\r\nAmerica. The Society has asserted that it believes that the full\r\nresponse to the duties of life is more important than constant demands\r\nfor rights; for with the performance of duties, rights will come as a\r\nmatter of course. The Society thus seeks to urge the Indian to avail\r\nhimself of every opportunity to learn the ways of “civilized” life, in\r\norder that he may become able to compete and cooperate successfully with\r\nother men. The members believe _Indian progress depends upon awakening\r\nthe abilities of every individual Indian to the realization of personal\r\nresponsibility, for self, for race and for country, and the duty of\r\nresponding to the call to activity_. When the nation remedies the laws\r\nnow hindering Indian progress, work, thrift, education and clean morals\r\nwill then secure for the Indian all the rights that may be given a man\r\nand a citizen.\r\n\r\nThe Society is not an organization devoted to complaining. Its aim is to\r\nsuggest and bring about better conditions wherein the old evils cannot\r\nexist. The Society does not seek to continually fight over local\r\nmatters; it does seek to abolish the cause of the misery and the\r\ndisability of the race. It strikes at the root of evil, yet it does not\r\nignore the individual case of injustice. Nearly one hundred applications\r\neach month come from Indians asking legal information.\r\n\r\nThe annual platform adopted by the Denver Conference and reaffirmed at\r\nthe Wisconsin University Conference in 1914 demands: First, the passage\r\nof the Carter Code Bill, by which a commission will draft a codified\r\nlaw, recommend new legislation and the abolition of laws no longer\r\noperative; and the establishment of the definite status of every tribe,\r\nband or group of Indians in the United States. The Indian cannot\r\nprogress until he knows his legal status and how he may advance from a\r\nlower to a higher civic status; Second, the Society demands the passage\r\nof the amended Stephens Bill, through which the Indians may place their\r\nclaims directly in the Court of Claims without specific permission of\r\nCongress in each instance. Indian progress will be retarded as long as\r\nreal or fancied claims against the Government are unsettled; Third, the\r\nSociety asks that the tribal funds be apportioned to each individual’s\r\npersonal account, so that each Indian may know exactly what the nation\r\nholds in trust for him. Individual effort and progress will come with an\r\nawakened interest in personal resources and personal property, as\r\nopposed to bulk holdings; Fourth, better educational advantages and\r\nbetter sanitary protection are demanded. An ignorant and a sick race\r\ncannot be an efficient, useful race. Wisdom, health and thrift will\r\nbring to the red man the greater rights he craves.\r\n\r\nThe Society publishes a _Quarterly Journal_ of unique interest. It\r\ncontains contributions from the pens of Indians who have the true\r\nwelfare of the race at heart, and from friends of the red man who have a\r\nconstructive message. All shades of thought are given. The discussion is\r\nopen, free and earnest. The editorial board consists of five Indians who\r\nare university graduates. The editor-general is connected officially\r\nwith the University of the State of New York. The _Quarterly Journal_ is\r\na high-grade publication, and is an epoch-making departure in the\r\nhistory of the race.\r\n\r\nThere are three general classes of membership, Active, Associate, and\r\nJunior. Active members are persons of Indian blood; Associates are\r\npersons not Indians; Juniors are persons less than twenty-one years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nEach year a national conference is held at some convenient point, and in\r\nconnection with some great university. Four successful conferences have\r\nbeen held. Each has been of great importance to the Indian race and has\r\nassisted materially in bringing the Indian problem to a point where it\r\nis nearer solution.\r\n\r\nThe old-time, non-English-speaking Indian was reverent towards the\r\n“unknown” or mystery. He did not blaspheme. “Why do the white men ask\r\nthe Great Spirit to curse them so often?” This was uttered by a pagan,\r\nWhite Head, a Cheyenne chief, in the presence of Col. Carrington at Fort\r\nPhil Kearney in 1866.\r\n\r\nThere were a vast number of good traits in the old Indian and we must\r\nnot overlook them. Mr. Wright (_page 314_) has referred to theft. They\r\nstole from other tribes—that was proper—but not from each other.\r\nFrankness was a trait everywhere apparent, and Indians spoke their minds\r\nfreely. Deceit was for the enemy—deceit as to trail, purpose, trade and\r\nso forth. Among themselves (in the tribe) there was no such thing as\r\ntrickery. Exaggerations were indulged in by story-tellers, of course.\r\nBut such deceit as white people practice upon each other was unknown in\r\nthe olden days.\r\n\r\nAll the writers, past and present, agree that the bulk of our Indians\r\nwere governed by certain moral codes. There never was a real degenerate\r\namong Indians, until white people came among them. In all our efforts to\r\nuplift the Indian during the present crucial transition period, we\r\nshould encourage those good qualities (even though they be tinged with\r\nsuperstition). We should build upon the natural foundation of Indian\r\ncharacter. If we utterly destroy the past, we cannot save the Indian.\r\n\r\nI am no idealist. I am quite aware that there are good Indians and bad\r\nIndians, as there are good white people and bad white people; but I\r\ncontend that if there is a general breaking down of the Indian\r\ncharacter—which may or may not be true—it is due to us and not to the\r\nIndian.\r\n\r\nAs to his sense of honor, and his morality, Leupp presents the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n“Has the Indian a basic sense of moral responsibility sufficiently\r\nrobust to be capable of high religious development? Let me tell you a\r\ntrue story. A number of years ago a group of twenty Indians who had been\r\nin controversy with the authorities in Washington entered into a solemn\r\npact not to accept certain money which the Government was preparing to\r\ndistribute among their tribe in three or four successive payments,\r\nbecause they believed that that would be a surrender of the principle\r\nfor which they had been contending. Later the questions at issue were\r\ncleared up by a judicial decision which left the Indians’ protest not a\r\nleg to stand on. Nineteen of the twenty, including a candidate for the\r\nchiefship who had led the party into their attempt at resistance, bowed\r\nto the inevitable, took the money offered them at the next payment, and\r\napplied for the instalments then in arrears. The twentieth man, whose\r\nEnglish name was Bill, stood out alone in his refusal to touch anything,\r\nbut refused to tell why. Soon afterward I visited the reservation on\r\nbusiness, and he sought me privately and opened his heart. He was poor,\r\nand his family were actually in need of some things the money would buy;\r\nso I tried to make him feel more comfortable by assuring him that the\r\nwithdrawal of the others from their mutual agreement left him free to do\r\nas he wished.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ he declared; adding, in a phraseology which I shall not try to\r\nimitate, ‘we are all bound by a vow. I swore that I would not take my\r\nshare of that money, and I must not. The others may change if they\r\nchoose, but they cannot release me from my oath.’\r\n\r\n“‘That is honorable, certainly,’ I answered; ‘but if you feel so\r\nstrongly about it, why did you come to me for advice?’\r\n\r\n“‘There is something you can tell me, and I am afraid to trust the\r\nothers. I vowed for myself and not for my family, though they have not\r\ndrawn their shares either. Now, can they get their money even if I don’t\r\ntouch mine?’\r\n\r\n“I said that I could get it for them.\r\n\r\n“‘What becomes of my money if I don’t take it?’\r\n\r\n“‘It will accumulate in the Treasury, and be paid to your heirs after\r\nyour death.’\r\n\r\n“‘You have made my heart glad,’ exclaimed Bill, laying his hand\r\naffectionately on my shoulder while his face beamed with satisfaction.\r\n‘That is the way I would have it. I felt right in standing out, but I\r\ndid not want my wife and children to suffer if I were wrong.’\r\n\r\n“A cynic might find the moral of this story to be that only one Indian\r\nin twenty is high-minded enough to hold his ground against such\r\ntemptation. But it would be fairer to temper that judgment with the\r\ninquiry, how the proportions would have arranged themselves in a like\r\nnumber of any other race?”[52]\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, when the Board of United States Indian Commissioners met\r\nin Washington, the representatives of practically all the missionary\r\norganizations appeared and a full and frank discussion ensued. It is no\r\nexaggeration to state that all of these persons representing varied\r\ninterests (and twenty years ago these very people might have been\r\nconsidered rivals) left with a resolve to carry on their work with due\r\nregard for the rights of others. It is quite clear that if the Catholics\r\nhave a successful mission on Reservation A, and the Presbyterians on\r\nReservation B, that the good work should continue, and those in charge\r\nof mission A should not seek to establish a post on Reservation B,\r\nunless it is perfectly clear that Mission B is unable to care for more\r\nthan a portion of the Indians. That where different denominations are\r\nlocated on the larger reservations, they should all work in harmony,\r\nlooking toward the great purpose for which such worthy organizations\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Indians in former years did not understand our\r\nreligion, and that confusion existed in the minds of the untutored\r\naborigines in the past for the very reason that representatives of\r\ndifferent sects worked at cross-purposes. This is said in no disrespect\r\nwhatsoever, it is merely a statement of facts. Mr. Leupp presents an\r\nilluminating illustration on this subject.\r\n\r\n“Indians are always greatly puzzled by the differences between the\r\nsects, and the appearance of hostility so often assumed by one toward\r\nanother. It has little effect to assure them that all the sects are but\r\nparts of one religious body, worshipping the same deity. Doctrinal\r\nsubtleties are of course beyond the reach of the ordinary Indian’s mind,\r\nbut in matters of discipline he discovers what seem to him serious\r\nincongruities. An old chief once expressed to me his deep concern\r\nbecause a missionary had warned his children that they would be punished\r\nafter death if they broke the Sabbath with their accustomed games, yet\r\nhe had seen with his own eyes a missionary playing tennis on Sunday.\r\nAnother raised in my presence, with a sly suggestion of satire in his\r\ntone, the question of marriage. One missionary, he told us—referring to\r\na visit from a Mormon apostle several years before—had four wives, and\r\nsaid it was good in the sight of the white man’s God; the missionary who\r\npreached at the agency school had only one wife, and said that that was\r\nall right, but it would be wicked for him to marry any more; but the\r\npriest who came once in a while to bless the children had no wife at\r\nall, and said that the white man’s God would be displeased with him if\r\nhe took even one.”[53]\r\n\r\nThe powerful missionary organizations, comprising as they do, hundreds\r\nof earnest workers, will accomplish much more for “Indian uplift” if\r\nthey devote their energies to “pagan Whites” as well as to the pagan\r\nIndians. The worst people I have met had white, and not red skins. These\r\nmen swarm about all Indian communities. Enough evidence against their\r\ncharacter has been brought before the benevolent organizations and\r\nWashington, to convince the most skeptical. Suppose the Indians of a\r\ncertain region were found to be swindling each other, importing whiskey,\r\ngambling, stealing and committing all sorts of crimes. Immediately half\r\na dozen organizations would raise funds and send their best workers to\r\n“lead the pagans from darkness into light.” It has been clearly shown\r\nthat the worst elements of our white race are responsible for the\r\ndeplorable condition of thousands of Indians. Yet, I fail to observe any\r\nconcerted effort to check this evil at its source. No one seems to\r\nrealize that the “pagan White” is vastly more in need of reformation\r\nthan his red brother. We have tried to save the Indian—meanwhile\r\npermitting whiskey and graft, immorality and greed, to continue\r\nvirtually unchecked. We tell him to be upright, yet we surround him by\r\nexamples of civilization, the antithesis of that which we preach. No\r\nwonder the Indian loses faith in us and our culture. Some wealthy man or\r\nwoman will do the Indian a great and good service by liberally endowing\r\na score of missions to labor among the “pagan Whites”, living near (or\r\nin) Indian communities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NAVAHO WOMAN WEAVING A BLANKET\r\n\r\n  From “Indian Blankets and their Makers,” by G.

IRRIGATION PROJECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Southwest in both ancient and modern times built\r\ndams, dug irrigation canals and watered certain tracts more or less\r\nextensive in area. The subject of agriculture as conducted in arid\r\nregions by the Indians is an exceedingly interesting one and has been\r\ntreated briefly by Doctor Hodge in the Handbook of American Indians.\r\nMany of the modern canals in Arizona, New Mexico and California follow\r\nthe old ditches dug by the Cliff Dwellers, Pueblos and other tribes.\r\nExcepting the Apaches and Comanches, probably all southwestern Indians\r\nunderstood and made use of irrigation in the raising of crops.\r\n\r\nSome of the military and scientific expeditions to the Southwest in\r\nearly times found the Pima, Maricopa, Papago, Pueblo and other Indians\r\nin possession of large, cultivated fields. With the influx of white\r\nsettlers in the later ’70’s and early ’80’s, not only was much of this\r\nland appropriated by the Whites, but the water was diverted, thus\r\ncausing the Indians great privations. I have referred elsewhere in this\r\nbook to the case of the Pimas, and that of the Maricopas, Yumas and\r\nPueblos, and it has been commented upon in a score of reports. Briefly\r\nsummed up, we have well-nigh destroyed (or rather appropriated) the\r\nentire irrigation zone formerly controlled by the Indians. Their fields\r\nand ditches have passed to us.\r\n\r\nA movement has been inaugurated to save what little remains. In this\r\nhumane work the Indian Rights Association and the Board of Indian\r\nCommissioners, as well as the Indian Office, have all played prominent\r\nparts. When Hon. F. H. Abbott became acting Commissioner he made a study\r\nof this subject, and later, as Secretary of the Board of Indian\r\nCommissioners, he prepared an exhaustive paper entitled, “Briefs on\r\nIndian Irrigation and Indian Forests.” This was presented to the Senate\r\nCommittee on Indian Affairs, February 9th, 1914. It covers the entire\r\nirrigation problem, and I insert most of it herewith.\r\n\r\n“The proposed amendment relating to Indian irrigation, you will observe,\r\nis sweeping in character. Its main and central purpose is to stop the\r\ngratuitous use of tribal and Government funds in the construction and\r\nmaintenance of irrigation projects, to charge the costs thereof against\r\nthe lands benefited or against the pro rata shares in the tribal funds,\r\nwhen distributed, of the individual Indians whose lands are benefited,\r\nand to give the Indians a voice in the expenditure of their own funds\r\nfor irrigation purposes and make them share the responsibility of\r\nmaintaining and operating the completed projects. If this amendment is\r\nenacted into law nearly $400,000 carried each year in the Indian\r\nappropriation acts as gratuity items will become reimbursable. The facts\r\nrelating to existing irrigation law and practice and arguments in\r\nsupport of the proposed amendment are fully elaborated in the brief\r\nsubmitted herewith, to which I invite your careful attention.\r\n\r\n“The proposed amendment relating to the care, protection, and sale of\r\nIndian timber is also supported by a carefully prepared statement,\r\nherewith submitted. This amendment, if enacted into law, will save the\r\nGovernment in the neighborhood of $75,000 a year. * * * *\r\n\r\n“The difficulties of the complex problems relating to the education and\r\ncivilization of the Indians of this country and to the handling of their\r\nvast property resources are increasing in direct ratio with the increase\r\nin the value of that property and the individualization thereof.\r\n\r\n“The eyes cannot be closed to the constantly increasing administrative\r\nburdens of the Indian Bureau. This increase can not be explained away on\r\nthe ground of alleged bad administration; it is due, in large part, to\r\nthe carrying out of laws enacted by Congress for the breaking up of the\r\nvast tribal estates of the Indians and to the establishment of the\r\npolicy of individualization in connection therewith. Before the volume\r\nof the business of the Indian Bureau will begin to grow less, it will\r\nbecome very much greater; and the value of Indian property over which\r\nthe Indian Bureau is required by law to exercise supervision, now\r\nestimated at nearly one billion dollars, will undoubtedly be very much\r\ngreater before it begins to grow less.\r\n\r\n“How is the Government going to meet this growing problem? Will Congress\r\nincrease appropriations to meet the increased demands imposed by law and\r\nchanging economic conditions upon the Indian Bureau? Is there any other\r\nway out?\r\n\r\n“Those who answer by saying, ‘Give the Indians immediate citizenship and\r\nfull control of their property and thus keep down the appropriations for\r\nIndian administration,’ offer a correct solution only for that class of\r\nIndians who are sufficiently educated and advanced in civilization to\r\naccept the full responsibility for handling their property. Accepting\r\nthis solution for that class of Indians—and it is undoubtedly the\r\ncorrect solution for this class—it still remains true that the\r\nincreasing value of the lands and minerals and forests on Indian\r\nreservations which are still closed to settlement, and of the property\r\nof individual Indians who are still unprepared to protect it, and the\r\nfuture individual allotment of lands to nearly 50 per cent of the\r\nIndians of the country, will make the administration of Indian Affairs\r\nfor some years to come one of increasing difficulty and expense. * * * *\r\n\r\n“The reclamation of arid lands on Indian reservations by irrigation, to\r\nprovide better homes for Indian families, and to bring to them the\r\nbenefits of civilized society through the agricultural development of\r\ntheir lands, is one of the most beneficent policies the Government has\r\never inaugurated in dealing with their affairs. Too much credit can not\r\nbe given to Senators and Congressmen and administrative officers of the\r\nGovernment who have had to do with the enactment of laws and the\r\nsecuring of appropriations to carry out this policy. The motives of\r\nlegislators have been benevolent and patriotic, and the work of the\r\nGovernment engineers and other officials who have constructed the\r\nprojects has been honest and comparatively efficient and economical.\r\nHowever, a careful examination of Indian irrigation laws and conditions\r\nprevailing in connection with their administration reveals defects which\r\nneed remedy. It is no reflection upon the high motives of those\r\nresponsible for present law and present conditions that these defects\r\nexist. It was a new legislative and administrative field. Irrigation\r\nlaws were not uniform in the several States. Conditions varied on\r\ndifferent Indian reservations. The legislation was necessarily\r\nexperimental. Nevertheless, the defects are serious, they should be\r\nfaced frankly, and the remedies needed should be applied promptly to\r\npreserve the good in the existing order of things and eliminate the bad\r\nbefore greater harm results.\r\n\r\n“Lack of uniformity in Indian irrigation laws, lack of utilization by\r\nIndians of their irrigated lands, lack of a voice on the part of the\r\nIndians in the expenditure of their funds for the construction and\r\nmaintenance of their irrigation projects, and failure to individualize\r\nthe reclamation costs by charging them against the lands benefited are\r\nthe most serious fundamental defects of the present situation.\r\n\r\n“Approximately nine million dollars have been expended for the\r\nirrigation of Indian lands. About seven millions of this amount have\r\nbeen charged to tribal funds and the balance expended from gratuity\r\nappropriations made by Congress. About 600,000 acres of irrigable Indian\r\nlands have been brought under ditch. Of this area less than 100,000\r\nacres are being irrigated by Indians, while a large part of the area\r\nthus irrigated is not farmed, but is used to produce hay crops. And,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that either tribal or Government funds have\r\nbeen used to irrigate these lands, on all except three reservations,\r\nwhen patents in fee are issued to Indian allottees, and in every case\r\nwhere their lands are sold under the supervision of the Government,\r\neither the individual Indian who sells the land or the purchaser thereof\r\nputs in his pocket the value of the water right for which the tribe or\r\nthe Government has paid; and not only are the members of the tribe not\r\nconsulted with respect to the expenditure of their money, which\r\nultimately passes in this manner either to the individual allottee or to\r\nthe white purchaser of his land, but the individual whose land is\r\nbenefited is given no opportunity to assume any responsibility in\r\nconnection therewith or to appreciate the value of the benefit\r\nconferred, while the free-water right thus secured by the individual\r\nIndian offers a constant inducement to him to part with his land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NAVAHO HOME, NEW MEXICO\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Some striking illustrations of the lack of utilization of irrigable\r\nIndian lands may be found on the following reservations: On the Crow\r\nReservation, where irrigation ditches have been completed for more than\r\nten years and where the total area under constructed ditches is\r\nestimated at 68,756 acres, only 11,376 acres are irrigated by Indians,\r\nand most of this is irrigated for hay crops; on the Flathead Reservation\r\nthe present irrigable area is estimated at 38,000 acres, but only 1,088\r\nacres are irrigated by Indians; on the Fort Belknap Reservation, out of\r\n22,000 acres under ditch, 7,670 acres are irrigated by Indians; on Fort\r\nHall Reservation Indians irrigate only 3,300 acres out of present\r\nirrigable area of 35,000 acres; on the Wind River Reservation the\r\nIndians are irrigating approximately 5,000 acres out of a total\r\nirrigable area of 35,000 acres, and most of this area is irrigated for\r\nhay crops; on the Uintah Reservation, out of a total irrigable area of\r\n87,880 acres the Indians are irrigating approximately 6,000 acres; on\r\nthe Yakima Reservation, where the present irrigable area is 54,000\r\nacres, the Indians are irrigating 5,350 acres; and at Yuma the Indians\r\nare irrigating approximately 200 acres out of an irrigable area of 4,000\r\nacres. In the reservations of the Southwest the showing of utilization\r\nof irrigable lands is very much better.\r\n\r\n“The lack of utilization noted in the foregoing paragraph is serious\r\nenough from an industrial standpoint, but it is fraught with peculiar\r\ndangers in the case of the reservations where the water rights are\r\nsubject to the operation of State law. On the Fort Hall Reservation\r\n(Idaho) beneficial use must be made of the water for the irrigable lands\r\nprior to the year 1916, in order to prevent the appropriation of the\r\nwater by other water users; on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming\r\nbeneficial use must likewise be made before 1916; and on the Uintah\r\nReservation (Utah) beneficial use must be made before 1919. The total\r\ninvestment in the construction of irrigation ditches and the purchase of\r\nwater rights on these three reservations amounts to approximately\r\n$2,000,000, and in the case of the Wind River and Uintah Reservations\r\nthe expenditure has been made from Indian funds.\r\n\r\n“Lack of proper utilization can not be charged to the indolence of the\r\nIndian. The present system is doubtless responsible for an undue lack of\r\ninterest and indifference on his part. He has not been consulted in\r\nadvance of the expenditure; the cost of the construction and the expense\r\nof maintenance on the basis of each acre irrigated have not been\r\nexplained and brought home to him; the money being taken out of a tribal\r\nfund which has never become a part of his individual possession, he has\r\nnot understood his intimate individual interest in its expenditure, nor\r\nhas he realized the value, in dollars and cents, of the benefit.\r\n\r\n“In many cases irrigation on Indian reservations has been provided for\r\nin response to a perfectly natural and normal demand of white settlers,\r\neither for the opening to settlement of irrigable lands on Indian\r\nreservations or for obtaining water from streams flowing through Indian\r\nreservations for the irrigation of their lands on the outside. As a\r\nresult, the construction of irrigation projects on Indian reservations\r\nhas often preceded the proper preparation of the Indians for such\r\nconstruction and often has preceded the development of transportation\r\nfacilities necessary to market the products of the land irrigated, and\r\nin the case of the large reservations in the Northwest irrigation has\r\nbeen brought to Indians unskilled in the art of irrigation, strangers to\r\nthe art of agriculture, trained for generations to the exciting life of\r\nthe chase, having no knowledge of any of the pursuits of modern\r\ncivilized life except a somewhat general knowledge of the raising of\r\ncattle and horses. Generally, however, this premature development of\r\nirrigation has had sufficient justification in the necessity of such\r\ndevelopment to preserve the rights of the Indians to the water.\r\n\r\n“One of the chief reasons for the failure of the Indians on the\r\nreservations mentioned to utilize their irrigable lands has been the\r\nfailure to provide appropriations necessary to enable them to buy teams\r\nand tools and other equipment, without which the utilization of their\r\nlands is impossible. The main thought apparently has been to build the\r\nditches, and with rare exceptions no provision has been made to use\r\ntribal funds for any other purpose than that of reimbursing the\r\nGovernment for the cost of construction of the project. At the same time\r\nthe Indian has lacked the credit which is available to the white settler\r\nliving under similar conditions necessary to help himself. Through the\r\npolicy of reimbursable appropriations established during the last few\r\nyears Congress has begun to prepare a remedy for these conditions. But\r\non a majority of the reservations mentioned above, Indians are still in\r\na position where they have to sit idly by and witness the expenditure of\r\ntheir own funds in the construction and maintenance of irrigation\r\nditches which, under present conditions, they cannot use and in which\r\nexpenditures they have no voice—helpless, though they have more than\r\nample resources in their undeveloped lands to secure money advances\r\nnecessary to make productive use thereof.\r\n\r\n“Another reason for the lack of adequate utilization of Indian lands may\r\nbe found in the failure to adjust the size of the allotment of irrigable\r\nland to the conditions of soil and climate and the industrial habits and\r\nneeds of the Indians. While in the Southwest, on the Colorado River and\r\nYuma Reservations and several others, allotments have been made in\r\n10–acre tracts, and in some cases smaller, suitable to the methods of\r\nintensive agriculture practiced in that section of country, this policy\r\nhas been lacking almost universally in the reservations of the\r\nNorthwest, where in most cases allotment has been made under the general\r\nallotment act, which did not take into consideration the question of\r\npossible irrigation. The allotment of 80 acres to each man, woman, and\r\nchild is found under the irrigation projects on the Yakima, Uintah,\r\nCrow, Wind River, Flathead, and Southern Ute (diminished) Reservations\r\nwhile on Blackfeet and Fort Peck the size of the allotment is 40 acres,\r\nand on Fort Hall 40 acres to each head of a family and 20 acres to each\r\nother member of the tribe. Take the Uintah and Wind River Reservations,\r\nfor example, where beneficial use is required by State law in order to\r\nprotect the water rights. The average family of five members would have\r\n400 acres of irrigable land. The average white family in the same\r\nsection of the country can not utilize satisfactorily over 80, or at the\r\nmost 160, acres of the same land. How can an Indian family unassisted,\r\nand especially without money or credit to buy tools and equipment, be\r\nexpected to reclaim 400 acres of land?\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RINCON RESERVATION, MISSION INDIANS, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n  Grandfather blind (trachoma). Both children infected.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“In striking contrast with the lack of agricultural development on\r\nirrigated Indian reservations, under the present system, is the marked\r\ndevelopment of agriculture during the last few years on a number of\r\nreservations in the regions of normal rainfall where Indians have had\r\ncontrol of their own funds and the responsibility of expending them in\r\nthe improvement and development of their lands, under the guidance of\r\npractical Indian Service farmers.\r\n\r\n“The remedies needed will be suggested briefly, as follows:\r\n\r\n“1. General legislation that will charge the individual land benefited\r\nwith the cost of construction and maintenance, payment to be made out of\r\nthe share in the tribal funds of the individual whose land in benefited\r\nor from the proceeds of the sale of the land when it passes from Indian\r\nownership where the share of the individual in the tribal fund is\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\n“2. The general legislation suggested in the above paragraph should\r\nprovide that the tribe whose funds it is proposed to use for the\r\nconstruction of irrigation projects shall be first consulted.\r\n\r\n“3. The proposed general legislation should also provide for charging of\r\ncosts of maintenance and operation against the lands under the project\r\nand should give the Indians whose lands are benefited a voice in said\r\nmaintenance and operation.\r\n\r\n“4. In order not to overburden irrigated Indian lands by the legislation\r\nsuggested, especially since the Indians have not heretofore been\r\nconsulted, the costs of supervisory engineering and of experimental\r\nconstruction and cost of investigations and preliminary surveys should\r\nbe excluded from the charges made against the lands and paid from\r\ngratuity appropriations.\r\n\r\n“5. Reimbursable appropriations from tribal funds should be made\r\nimmediately for all Indian reservations where the utilization of\r\nirrigable lands has not kept pace with the construction of irrigation\r\nprojects through lack of funds in the hands of individual Indians to\r\nmake such utilization possible.\r\n\r\n“6. Skilled irrigation farmers should be provided out of gratuity\r\nappropriations to give advice and assistance to Indians having irrigable\r\nlands.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHAPTER XXIX. THE BUFFALO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American bison, commonly called the buffalo, occupied an extended\r\narea of the United States in ancient times. About 1850, the range of the\r\nbuffalo extended from the Red River valley, Manitoba, to central Texas;\r\nthrough western and central Minnesota and as far west as the arid plains\r\nof Colorado, and to near the headwaters of the Missouri River in the\r\nNorthwest. As settlers pushed west of the Mississippi, the buffalo\r\ndisappeared from eastern Nebraska, Missouri and western Arkansas. The\r\nanimal does not appear to have ranged in eastern Arkansas or Louisiana,\r\npreferring the portion of the country known as the Great Plains, and the\r\nentire Missouri River valley. In the later sixties, when the Union\r\nPacific Railroad was built westward, hundreds of hunters were enabled to\r\nship East unnumbered thousands of robes and great quantities of meat.\r\nThe herds were further restricted, and by 1885, the buffalo almost\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf the numbers of these animals, none of the authorities seem to agree.\r\nRobert M. Wright of Dodge City, Kansas, one of the earliest pioneers,\r\nrecently published a book entitled “Dodge City, the Cowboy Capital.” He\r\ngives the estimates prepared by men living at the time, as to the number\r\nof buffalo. I present his remarks at some length as indicative of the\r\ndifference of opinion even among those familiar with the Great Plains,\r\nof their numerical extent. It is safe to assume, however, that there\r\nwere between 25,000,000 and 50,000,000 buffalo in the West in the year\r\n1850.\r\n\r\n“I wish here to assert a few facts concerning game, and animal life in\r\ngeneral, in early days, in the vicinity of Fort Dodge and Dodge\r\nCity.[54] There were wonderful herds of buffalo, antelope, deer, elk,\r\nand wild horses, big gray wolves and coyotes by the thousand, hundreds\r\nof the latter frequently being seen in bands and often from ten to fifty\r\ngray wolves in a bunch. There were also black and cinnamon bears,\r\nwildcats and mountain lions, though these latter were scarce and seldom\r\nseen so far from the mountains. General Sheridan and Major Inman were\r\noccupying my office at Fort Dodge one night, having just made a trip\r\nfrom Fort Supply, and called me in to consult as to how many buffaloes\r\nthere were between Dodge and Supply. Taking a strip fifty miles east and\r\nfifty miles west, they had first estimated it ten billion. General\r\nSheridan said, ‘That won’t do.’ They figured it again, and made it one\r\nbillion. Finally they reached the conclusion that there must be one\r\nhundred million; but said, they were afraid to give out these figures;\r\nnevertheless they believed them. This vast herd moved slowly toward the\r\nnorth when spring opened, and moved steadily back again from the north\r\nwhen the grass began to grow short, and winter was setting in.\r\n\r\n“Horace Greeley estimated the number of buffaloes at five million. I\r\nagree with him, only I think there were nearly five times that number.\r\nMr. Greeley passed through herds of them twice. I lived in the heart of\r\nthe buffalo range for nearly fifteen years. I am told that some recent\r\nwriter, who has studied the buffalo closely, has placed their number at\r\nninety million, and I think that he is nearer right than I. Brick Bond,\r\na resident of Dodge, an old, experienced hunter, a great shot, a man of\r\nconsiderable intelligence and judgment, and a most reliable man as to\r\ntruthfulness, says that he killed 1500 buffaloes in seven days, and his\r\nhighest killing was 250 in one day; and he had to be on the lookout for\r\nhostile Indians all the time. He had fifteen “skinners,” and he was only\r\none of many hunters.\r\n\r\n“Charles Rath and I shipped over 200,000 buffalo hides the first winter\r\nthe Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad reached Dodge City, and I\r\nthink there were at least as many more shipped from there, besides 200\r\ncars of hind-quarters and two cars of buffalo tongues.”\r\n\r\nA Kansas newspaper (_Dodge City Times_, August 18th, 1877) remarks:\r\n\r\n“Dickinson County has a buffalo hunter by the name of Mr. Warnock, who\r\nhas killed as high as 658 in one winter.—_Edwards County Leader._\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, what a mighty hunter! Ford County has twenty men who each\r\nhave killed five times that many in one winter. The best on record,\r\nhowever, is that of Tom Nickson, who killed 120 at one stand in forty\r\nminutes, and who, from the 15th of September to the 20th of October,\r\nkilled 2,173 buffaloes.”\r\n\r\nColonel Richard I. Dodge, who spent thirty years on the Plains,\r\ncommenting in 1880 on the value of the buffalo to the Indian, says:\r\n\r\n“It is almost impossible for a civilized being to realize the value to\r\nthe Plains Indians of the buffalo. It furnished him with home, food,\r\nclothing, bedding, house equipment, almost everything. Without it he is\r\npoor as poverty itself, and on the verge of starvation.\r\n\r\n“Some years, as in 1871, the buffalo appeared to move northward in one\r\nimmense column, oftentimes from twenty to fifty miles in width, and of\r\nunknown depth from front to rear. Other years the northward journey was\r\nmade in several parallel columns, moving at the same rate and with their\r\nnumerous flankers covering a width of a hundred or more miles.\r\n\r\n“During the three years 1872–73–74, at least five millions of buffaloes\r\nwere slaughtered for their hides.\r\n\r\n“This slaughter was all in violation of law, and in contravention of\r\nsolemn treaties made with the Indians, but it was the duty of no special\r\nperson to put a stop to it. The Indian Bureau made a feeble effort to\r\nkeep the white hunters out of Indian Territory, but soon gave it up, and\r\nthese parties spread all over the country, slaughtering the buffalo\r\nunder the very noses of the Indians.\r\n\r\n“Ten years ago the Plains Indians had an ample supply of food, and could\r\nsupport life comfortably without the assistance of the Government. Now\r\neverything is gone, and they are reduced to the condition of paupers,\r\nwithout food, shelter, clothing, or any of those necessaries of life\r\nwhich came from the buffalo; and without friends, except the harpies,\r\nwho, under the guise of friendship, feed upon them.”\r\n\r\nThe first trains on the Union Pacific Railway were frequently compelled\r\nto stop for one or two days until these immense herds had crossed the\r\ntracks. The Missouri River has been known to be filled with buffalo\r\nswimming across; a boat descending or ascending the river was compelled\r\nto wait a day or two for the herds to pass. Unnumbered thousands were\r\ndrowned at the time of these crossings. Prairie fires must have\r\ndestroyed multitudes of these animals.\r\n\r\nThe American bison was very easily approached and killed, and a careful\r\nreading of the accounts of buffalo-hunts indicates that there was about\r\nas much real sport in the slaughter of these animals as in killing\r\ndomesticated cattle. In fact, the long-horned Texas steer such as used\r\nto range the Southwest forty years ago, would probably afford more sport\r\nto men engaged in a “running hunt,” than the buffalo. The latter were\r\nheavy, ponderous animals and save when stampeded, could be shot down\r\nfrom ambush. An “oldtimer”, long on the Plains, told me that he\r\nfrequently killed from fifty to seventy-five buffalo from one stand. He\r\nwould secret himself on a little bluff, overlooking a ravine where the\r\ngrass was exceptionally good, and from this vantage-point, using a heavy\r\nSharpes rifle, he shot down one after another. He stated that the bulls\r\nwould walk up to a fallen animal, smell of the blood, paw the dirt, and\r\nperhaps bellow a little, but until the animals got scent of him, they\r\nwould not move away. Professor William T. Hornaday in the United States\r\nNational Museum Reports for 1887 and 1889 has given an extended account\r\nof the buffalo and its destruction. Catlin has presented us, in earlier\r\nyears, of a stirring account of a buffalo-hunt. Coming down to later\r\ntimes, General Custer, Colonel William F. Cody and others have pictured\r\nthe excitement of the buffalo-chase. Colonel Cody, in fifteen months,\r\naccording to his own admission, slaughtered 4280.[55] He thus obtained\r\nthe name “Buffalo Bill.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES CAVALRY ATTACKING BLACK KETTLE’S VILLAGE ON THE WASHITA,\r\n    NOVEMBER 27, 1868\r\n\r\n  Black Kettle was killed in the fight. Reproduced from Col. Dodge’s\r\n    “Our Wild Indians”\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe senseless slaughter of this magnificent creature by thousands of\r\nhunters, frontiersmen, Bills and Dicks, and others between 1850 and\r\n1880, soon brought about the near extinction of the species. A few were\r\nsaved by Messrs. Allard and Conrad of Montana, the Canadian Government,\r\nour own Government, Colonel W. A. Jones (Buffalo Jones) and others. The\r\nlate Senator Corbin secured a number of animals and shipped them to New\r\nHampshire where a tract of several thousand acres was set aside as a\r\npark. All of these herds increased, and at the present time in the\r\nUnited States and Canada there must be nearly, if not quite, 1500 head.\r\nThus the species is preserved. The Government had great difficulty in\r\npreventing poachers in Yellowstone Park from slaughtering the animals,\r\nand in the early nineties there were very few animals left alive. Public\r\nopinion has been aroused to the necessity of preserving this typically\r\nAmerican animal, and it is now certain that the species will not become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nBuffalo Bill, not content with his records of “big killings”, took\r\nnumbers of bison East during the ’80’s. Of these, twenty fine specimens\r\ndied of pleuro-pneumonia while his show was at Madison Square Garden,\r\nNew York City, during the winter of 1886–’87. The last survivors of this\r\nmagnificent creature were hauled about the country and exhibited before\r\ngaping crowds. At Newark, Ohio, in the early ’80’s, when a boy I\r\nattended Buffalo Bill’s “Wild West Show”. I shall ever remember my\r\nsensations when witnessing the “grand buffalo hunt”. Three or four poor,\r\nold, scarred bison were driven into the fair-ground enclosure by some\r\nwhooping cow-punchers. Buffalo Bill himself dashed up alongside the\r\nlumbering animals and from a Winchester repeater discharged numerous\r\n“blanks” into the already powder-burned sides of the helpless creatures.\r\nThe crowd roared with appreciation, and as the cow-punchers pursued, and\r\nrounded up the hapless bison before the grandstand, Buffalo Bill reined\r\nin his steed, and spurring the horse (so he would prance), bowed right\r\nand left.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hornady’s report, together with other information, indicates\r\nthat enough buffalo were carted about the East to have formed a very\r\nrespectable herd—had they been permitted to remain in some favored spot\r\nin the buffalo country.\r\n\r\nThe killing of the buffalo furnished employment for the type of men who\r\nusually flock to any frontier. There was more or less excitement in the\r\nchase, the animals were absolutely defenseless, the hides and meat could\r\nbe sold. But for the hostility of the Plains tribes, the buffalo would\r\nlong ago have disappeared. But when the Sioux, Pawnee, Cheyenne,\r\nArapaho, Kiowa, Omaha and others saw that the Whites would destroy their\r\nmeans of sustenance, they inaugurated a campaign of hostility throughout\r\nthe Great Plains and the Upper Missouri country, against the Whites.\r\n\r\nCertain communities where a large number of fearless men were assembled\r\n(such as Dodge City, Kansas,) became headquarters for the hunters, but\r\nthe ranging of hunting parties throughout the entire West was\r\nrestricted. This delayed the destruction of the buffalo. As I have\r\nstated, the coming of the railroad, and the subsequent building of other\r\nrailroads, and steamboat navigation upon the Missouri, brought about\r\ncurtailment of Indian activities and the ultimate destruction of the\r\nbuffalo. I present a drawing from Wright’s book in which are exhibited\r\nupwards of 40,000 buffalo hides stacked up in the corral at Dodge\r\nCity.[56] This was in 1876. So many hides were shipped to the eastern\r\nmarket that the price fell to a dollar. Unnumbered thousands were sold\r\nat $1.25. I entered a furrier’s store in Boston last winter and saw\r\nthree buffalo robes offered for sale. The ordinary one was $75, another\r\none was $100, and an extra fine robe was priced at $150. A few live\r\nbuffalo were recently sold and the price was, I have been told, $1,000\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThe hide-hunters killed the animal for the robe, as the name implies,\r\nand left the carcass to rot. Sometimes men took neither the hides nor\r\nthe tongues, but killed for the mere pleasure of slaughtering.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all difficult for us to reconstruct the “good old buffalo\r\ndays” among any of the tribes, from the Comanches of Texas to the Sioux\r\nof Minnesota. Many of the Indian bands followed the buffalo in its\r\nannual migration north or south, killing such of the animals as were\r\nneeded for use and permitting the greater number to escape. There is no\r\nauthentic account of early Indians slaughtering to satisfy a craving for\r\nblood. Indians sometimes killed enemies for the sheer love of slaughter,\r\nbut the buffalo was not an enemy. Having obtained sufficient meat or\r\nhides, they simply quit, for they had not become “civilized”.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine some village of the period between 1850 and 1865. There\r\nare numerous accounts of such, and we need read few of them to form an\r\naccurate, though composite picture. The camp is located in some favorite\r\nspot. Young men, out upon a scout, observe the approach of a great herd,\r\nand, lashing their ponies, speed back home with the welcome news. All is\r\nexcitement in the village some twenty miles to the east. Immediately the\r\nvillage crier gallops from one end of the encampment to the other\r\nannouncing that a buffalo dance is to be held that night. Everybody\r\nprepares for the festive occasion; the shamans make their medicine; the\r\nbuffalo dance paraphernalia is brought out, and until early morning\r\nhours the dance continues.\r\n\r\nGreat merriment is caused when the better dancers try to outdo each\r\nother. Much feasting follows—for are they not soon to possess an\r\nabundance of meat? An old shaman appears; the dancers pause; he informs\r\nthem that his medicine is “good.” No enemies are near; the dreadful\r\nwhite hunters are not at hand; every lodge will secure at least three\r\nbuffalo. Therefore, all must prepare and be ready to begin the hunt at\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\nShortly after sunrise a large portion of the Indians mounted on their\r\nmost reliable “buffalo horses” (which have been trained to skillfully\r\navoid the rushes of the bulls) pursue the herd. Each man selects a\r\nwell-proportioned beast, and with rifle, arrow or lance, he brings him\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nNow, hunting buffalo with the lance, or bow and arrow, was sport. The\r\nuse of a rifle required no skill. With the lance, the hunter must ride\r\nup close, thrust the lance in and swing his pony suddenly to avoid the\r\ncharge of any belligerent bull. The steel-pointed arrows must be shot at\r\nclose range, and when the beast was “on the jump”, in order that the\r\narrow penetrate between the ribs to a vital part. Much of the arrow’s\r\nforce was lost, if it struck a rib. Hence, great skill on the hunter’s\r\npart was required. He must shoot or thrust at the proper moment. This\r\nwas true sport—just the opposite of still hunting, the favorite pastime\r\nof the pot-and-hide hunters; far more exciting than the work of such men\r\nas Buffalo Bill, who killed in order to make “big records”. When Indians\r\nhunted, the women and children and older men followed along in the wake\r\nof the advance party, removed the hides and cut up the meat.\r\n\r\nOr, if the herd is a small one, it is surrounded by a large number of\r\nhorsemen and forced to a common center. “Milling”, the old frontiersmen\r\nused to call it. Indians ride furiously around the herd, making much\r\nnoise, and the animals seeking to escape, crowd toward the center of the\r\ncircle. Buffalo were often maimed or crushed as a result of this style\r\nof hunt. It afforded the Indians opportunity to shoot down a large\r\nnumber of animals before the buffalo ceased “milling” and fled in\r\nvarious directions.\r\n\r\nAgain, small herds were run over precipices, or into ravines having\r\nsteep sides. Sometimes they were pursued to the banks of the Missouri\r\nRiver and shot while swimming.\r\n\r\nOften from a village small parties of young men would go out on informal\r\nhunts, preceding which there was no special ceremony such as the buffalo\r\ndance. But as a rule, the hunts were more or less ceremonial affairs, or\r\nat least preceded by certain rites. The introduction of the Sharpes\r\nrifle, and later the Winchester, among the Indians, changed this style\r\nof hunt and many of the Indians followed the example of the white men\r\nand hunted individually, or in small groups, rather than tribally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE HIDE HUNTER\r\n]\r\n\r\nMiss Alice C. Fletcher is considered an authority upon the Omaha and\r\nrelated tribes. Of the buffalo she says:—\r\n\r\n“Tribal regulations controlled the cutting up of the animal and the\r\ndistribution of the parts. The skin and certain parts of the carcass\r\nbelonged to the man who had slain the buffalo; the remainder was divided\r\naccording to certain fixed rules among the helpers, which afforded an\r\nopportunity for the poor and disabled to procure food. Butchering was\r\ngenerally done by men on the field, each man’s portion being taken to\r\nhis tent and given to the women as their property.\r\n\r\n“The buffalo was hunted in the winter by small, independent but\r\norganized parties, not subject to the ceremonial exactions of the tribal\r\nhunt. The pelts secured at this time were for bedding and for garments\r\nof extra weight and warmth. The texture of the buffalo hide did not\r\nadmit of fine dressing, hence was used for coarse clothing, moccasins,\r\ntent covers, parfleche cases, and other articles. The hide of the heifer\r\nkilled in the fall or early winter made the finest robe.\r\n\r\n“The buffalo was supposed to be the instructor of doctors who dealt with\r\nthe treatment of wounds, teaching them in dreams where to find healing\r\nplants and the manner of their use. The multifarious benefits derived\r\nfrom the animal brought the buffalo into close touch with the people. It\r\nfigured as a gentile totem, its appearance and movements were referred\r\nto in gentile names, its habits gave designations to the months, and it\r\nbecame the symbol of the leader and the type of long life and plenty;\r\nceremonies were held in its honor, myths recounted its creation, and its\r\nfolk-tales delighted old and young.”[57]\r\n\r\nThere were many separate uses to which the entire buffalo carcass was\r\nput. I have grouped them thus:—\r\n\r\n                         FLESH\r\n                       Ordinary food\r\n                       Dried for winter\r\n                       use\r\n                       Mixed (pounded)\r\n                       with other foods\r\n\r\n                         HIDE\r\n                       House\r\n                       Bedding\r\n                       Lariat\r\n                       Trunk\r\n                       Boat\r\n                       Garments\r\n                       Leggins\r\n                       Footwear\r\n\r\n                         BONES\r\n                       Shovels of shoulder-blades\r\n                       Grooved adzes\r\n                       Scrapers\r\n                       Flint-chippers\r\n                       Spoons\r\n                       Needles\r\n                       Awls, etc.\r\n                       Skull for ceremonies\r\n                       Hoof-points for rattles\r\n\r\n                         HORNS\r\n                       Ornaments\r\n                       Cups\r\n                       Club-heads\r\n\r\n                         SINEWS\r\n                       Thread\r\n                       Bow-strings\r\n                       Ropes\r\n\r\n                         OTHER PARTS\r\n                       Tallow\r\n                       Pemmican\r\n                       Fuel\r\n                       Bladder (storage)\r\n                       Hair (Stuffings)\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that he meant to many of the Plains tribes their\r\nvery existence. The destruction of the buffalo meant the destruction of\r\nall. Indian chiefs were quick to foresee that if indiscriminate\r\nslaughter on the part of white people continued, the power of the Indian\r\nas a race was doomed. That is, of the Plains or “Horse” tribes. Our own\r\narmy officers also were aware of this fact, and Custer, Miles, Sherman,\r\nCrook and others have stated in their reports that in order to bring the\r\nPlains Indians into subjection and control them on reservations, it was\r\nnecessary to destroy the American bison. All the prominent Sioux,\r\nCheyenne and other chiefs inspired their followers to continue the war\r\nagainst the white people, using as an incentive the phrase—“They are\r\ndestroying the Indians’ means of livelihood.” Speeches of this character\r\nwere always made in councils, or preceding war dances, and never failed\r\nto rouse a militant spirit.\r\n\r\nAs the Indians became settled on reservations and attempted to provide\r\nthemselves with meat, robes, dwellings, etc., as formerly, they\r\nexperienced great difficulty on account of the scarcity of the buffalo.\r\nIt was very natural, therefore, for them to turn to the authorities at\r\nWashington for support, since the authorities had permitted the\r\nhide-hunters, frontiersmen and numerous persons who flocked to the\r\nfrontier at the close of the Civil War, to engage in lawless acts. These\r\nIndians were not agriculturalists, and yet they had always supported\r\nthemselves. Their inter-tribal wars, while at some times serious, never\r\nresulted in the total destruction of a large band. In fact, too much has\r\nbeen made of the wars between the Crows and the Sioux, or the Ojibwa and\r\nthe Sioux, or those between other bands. The existence that they led, in\r\nthe good old buffalo days, was to them ideal. And from their point of\r\nview we must admit that they speak truly when they so declare. Many an\r\nold Indian has told me he would rather “take chances on a piece of lead”\r\nin olden times, than live as he does today. The effect of this lawless\r\nelement on Indian life has been overlooked by other writers. They have\r\nminimized its pernicious effect. We know they were free from disease,\r\nuntil white men came among them; they desired nothing further than to be\r\nproperly fed, clothed and housed. The destruction of the buffalo put an\r\nend to all of this, and the presence of the military further curtailed\r\ntheir activities. Hence the reservation and ration system sprang up.\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me, we have all minimized one great truth. Having\r\ndestroyed that which was the very life of these Indians, we should have\r\ngiven them something in its place. The Indian frequently asked for\r\nstock, but it was not until years afterwards that stock in any numbers\r\nwas issued to them. The issue of cattle to the Plains Indians was much\r\ncurtailed because of reports from Agents and Superintendents, during the\r\neighties, that the Indians killed much of this stock for food. All the\r\nPlains tribes were meat-eaters and not vegetarians. We could not expect\r\nthem to live where there was no meat available, save their own cattle.\r\nAgriculture was (and among the Sioux, still is) in its infancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CREEK CHURCH AND CAMP-MEETING GROUND NEAR SYLVIAN, OKLAHOMA, 1913\r\n]\r\n\r\nA gentleman living in northern Nebraska, who has been familiar with the\r\nSioux for forty years, writes me on this point as follows:—\r\n\r\n“On the spring round-up of the year that Major Clapp left Pine Ridge,\r\n(thirty years ago) these Indians branded over 16,000 calves; and horses\r\ndotted the hills in herds of from fifty to several hundred head each. At\r\nthis time there are a few herds of small proportion, and the calves\r\nproduced by the entire four counties that originally comprised the\r\nreservation, is numbered by a paltry few hundred.”\r\n\r\nWhat the Government did was to permit the destruction of the buffalo,\r\ncorral the Indians, expect them to change from the chase to agriculture,\r\nor, it utterly destroyed their sustenance and commanded:—“Become as\r\nwhite men,” all within one or two decades. This was, manifestly,\r\nimpossible. The ration system was a necessity, not a mere gratuity, as\r\nso many of the writers have maintained. Without a ration system, these\r\nIndians would have starved to death. If large numbers of cattle had been\r\nissued them, and they had been compelled to save a certain portion of\r\nthese for breeding purposes, and thus increased their herds, we should\r\ncertainly have avoided a great deal of misery.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it is quite clear that the extinction of the bison\r\nworked a hardship not only to the Indians, but was a great monetary loss\r\nto our own nation. The frontier element responsible should have been\r\ncontrolled. Canada has not been cursed with the class of Bills and Dicks\r\nwho roamed at will the Great Plains in our own country between 1850 and\r\n1880. Canada had, and has, a great many Indians in her northwestern\r\npossessions. Her white population was, numerically, far weaker than our\r\nown between these periods of time. Such a united band as Red Cloud led\r\nagainst Fort Fetterman in 1866 could have utterly destroyed all the\r\nwhite settlers in western Canada were the chiefs so inclined. The very\r\nfact that they never attacked the Canadians, and that immediately south\r\nof the boundary between the two countries, bloodshed was rampant from\r\n1850 to 1880, indicates that the Canadian authorities adopted a much\r\nwiser policy than that followed by our easy-going officials at\r\nWashington. If we possessed a mounted police service such as that long\r\nago established in the Canadian northwest, roving hunters, and\r\nundesirable citizens responsible for most of the Indian wars, could have\r\nbeen held in check.\r\n\r\nAs time passes, and men view dispassionately the events of the Plains,\r\nour historians will record that most of the wars had their origin with\r\nourselves. The Indians never began them.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Pages 71–6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  U. S.

THE PLAINS INDIANS FIFTY YEARS AGO AND TODAY\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert M. Wright, Esq., of Dodge City, Kansas, located in that State\r\nwhen a boy, in the early ’50’s. There are few men living at the present\r\ntime who have had a more varied and interesting career.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Wright’s recent book, “Dodge City The Cowboy Capital”, I was\r\nstruck with its frankness. The book presents a true picture of life\r\namong buffalo-hunters, scouts, gamblers, stockmen and others. I wrote to\r\nthis aged frontiersman and asked him to give me an absolute, frank\r\nopinion as to the cause of the Indian wars, and his views upon our\r\nIndian policy. In return he sent me a lengthy communication which\r\nilluminates events on the Plains between the years 1855 and 1890.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright is one of the few living men who observed Indians from the\r\npioneer point of view. Mr. Wright’s observations, which he kindly\r\nfurnished me, are the more important in that they are offered by one who\r\nhas not held Indians in very high esteem. Mr. Wright saw some of his\r\nwarmest friends shot down during Indian raids. His narrative, if\r\nanything, should be rather prejudiced against the Indians. Yet it is not\r\nso, as will be observed by perusal of the following pages.\r\n\r\nBefore presenting quotations from his manuscript I shall sum up briefly\r\nhis general observations. Looking back upon a career of upwards of sixty\r\nyears throughout the West (chiefly in Kansas and Nebraska,) Mr. Wright\r\nconcludes that the Plains Indian was vastly better off when able to\r\nroam, unhampered by anyone, throughout the country, than at the present\r\ntime. He speaks of the great and interesting Kiowa village located some\r\ndistance from Dodge City about 1868. Living in central and southern\r\nKansas, he came in contact, not so much with the Sioux, but with the\r\nPawnees, who occupied the flat country, and the Horse Indians, which\r\nincluded the Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne, Arapaho and Prairie Apache. As\r\nto the wars among themselves, he thinks that the number of killed, or\r\ndamage inflicted upon villages has been exaggerated. Usually, there were\r\nfew casualties in these actions. Some writers might not agree with him,\r\nbut this is his opinion. Occasionally, one band would surprise a village\r\nand take many captives and scalps. He was impressed in the early days\r\nwith the good health of these Indians, their hardiness, and that they\r\nwere seldom visited by epidemics. Smallpox broke out along the Missouri\r\nRiver, and to the east and north, but seldom in southern Kansas and\r\nnorthern Texas. He declares that there was no tuberculosis or trachoma\r\nwhen he first went among these people. The general standard of character\r\nand virtue was much higher.\r\n\r\n“As has been said, the Indian was by nature a warrior and hunter, and\r\nwas trained as such from earliest childhood. It is taken for granted, by\r\nthe great mass of civilized peoples, that the uncivilized redskin had no\r\nidea of education. This is an error. For years, I was among the wild\r\nIndians of half a century ago, and I know from personal observation that\r\nthey had as thorough a system of education for their children, in their\r\nline, as that boasted by the civilized white race. From the time the\r\nIndian child was able to walk, his or her education began. The first\r\nlesson usually consisted in being strapped upon the back of a docile\r\npony and taking a little practice in riding. In the second step in\r\neducation he was made to become familiar with the bow and arrow, which\r\nwere the Indians’ favorite weapons, half a century ago. At the age of\r\nfive, perhaps, the father took the boy out upon the hills adjoining the\r\ncamp and admonished him to be observant of what he saw. Every ravine and\r\nhill, a buffalo skeleton, a rock or tree, a footprint in the sand or\r\ngrass, the displacement of a stick or stone—all these things and many\r\nmore a child must study and learn to notice. He must learn to readily\r\ndetect the different marks on bows, arrows, and moccasins,\r\ndistinguishing as to which tribe they belonged, as every tribe had a\r\npeculiar mark of its own for its manufactured articles. When the father\r\nand child came back to the tipi, after a day of observation, the child\r\nwas required to give a description of what he had seen during the long\r\ntramp, the father or teacher questioning him. The child must give an\r\nintelligent and comprehensive account of his observations, or be taken\r\nover the same ground again and again until he could do so and had\r\nacquired a thorough knowledge of the territory covered. As soon as the\r\nchild had familiarized himself minutely with one section of the country,\r\nhe was taken to another and yet another, until, finally he was\r\nintimately acquainted with all the territory adjacent to the camp. These\r\nsame methods were employed in familiarizing the young Indian with more\r\nextended ranges of country until, at last, he thoroughly understood his\r\nsurroundings for hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\n“But there were many other subjects in that course. For instance, the\r\nyoung Indian was expected to learn signalling, similar to that of our\r\nsignal corps. Indians well versed in signalling could communicate\r\naccurately with each other though many miles apart. This knowledge was\r\naugmented by detailed instruction and drill in matters of war, the\r\ntrail, and the chase. Some of the old-time scouts, who were with us, had\r\nbeen captured in childhood and raised and educated by the Indians. These\r\nwere as proficient in Indian tactics as the Indians themselves, and were\r\nvery valuable to have along with a command in Indian campaigns as scouts\r\nand guides. They could follow up a trail, tell the number of ponies,\r\ngive the number of Indians in the party being trailed, and, in fact, by\r\ntheir Indian lore, could know the movements of such a party about as\r\nwell as those comprising it knew them. The Indian was as fond of his\r\nboys as any white father could be, and took pride in their training.”\r\n\r\nOf the buffalo, he claims, as have all writers, that the very existence\r\nof the Plains Indians was threatened when that noble animal was\r\nexterminated. A great enmity sprang up between the Indians and the white\r\nhunters.\r\n\r\n“With this hatred and enmity, the Indian blended a certain fear of the\r\nwhite hunters, and to the credit of the redskin’s courage it can be said\r\nthat the hunters were the only class on earth that he did fear, while\r\nwith his fear was mixed also a sort of desperation. The Indian hunted\r\naltogether on horseback, with bow and arrow or lance, which they planted\r\nin the side of the animal by riding up alongside of him. The Indians\r\nclaimed they killed only for meat or robes, and, as soon as they had\r\nsufficient, they stopped and went home; whereas, the white hunters never\r\nknew when they had enough, and were continually harassing the buffaloes\r\nfrom every side, never giving the herds a chance to recover, but keeping\r\nup a continual pop-pop from their big guns. Only under the most\r\nfavorable circumstances would the Indians attack the hunters. They were\r\nafraid of the latter’s big guns, cool bravery, and, last but not least,\r\nof their unerring, deadly aim. The passing of the buffalo herds, because\r\nof the white men, was one of the prime causes of Indian hostility.\r\n\r\n“But the feeling over the buffalo was only one of the causes of the\r\nPlains wars. To understand other causes, one should consider the Indian\r\nas he was found by the first white men, and compare him with what he was\r\nafter his association with the Whites for a term of years. It can\r\nclearly be seen, by such a comparison, that a great change took place,\r\nin that time, in the Indian’s attitude and sentiments toward the Whites,\r\nand this change could not have been due to anything but the influence of\r\nassociation. The redskin acquired knowledge, also confidence in himself.\r\nThen followed hostile feelings awakened by the mismanagement and\r\nneedless cruelty of the Whites. The Indian seemed to learn and adopt\r\nevery vice of the Whites but not one of their virtues.\r\n\r\n“When I first crossed the Plains in 1859, we met several bands of\r\nIndians. In fact we struck about the first and much the biggest number\r\nat the great bend of the Arkansas River, a little east of where the town\r\nof Great Bend now stands and from there on we met them up to\r\nseventy-five miles west of old Fort Lyon in eastern Colorado. There was\r\nno military fort there then, nor any west of Fort Riley to Fort Garland\r\nin the mountains, and there was no need of any, for the Indians were\r\nsupposed to be friendly, which indeed they were. This part of the\r\ncountry was the chief resort of the Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes,\r\nArapahoes, and Prairie Apaches. Here, on the Arkansas River, near the\r\npresent site of Great Bend, is where they all congregated. Up to 1864,\r\nall the Indians mentioned were considered peaceable and were so to a\r\ngreat extent. When they caught parties of Whites south of the Arkansas\r\nRiver (which was sacred ground to them, where no trespassers were\r\nallowed) there was trouble. Only traders were allowed in that region,\r\nand they had to be well known and familiar with the Indians to be safe.\r\nIf an unknown trader ventured down there, he was stripped of his goods,\r\nwhipped severely, often killed, and his wagons burned. But along the\r\ngreat Santa Fe Trail small parties of Whites, and even single\r\nindividuals, went through without being molested, though I have seen\r\nthese peaceable Indians, at such times, treated with the utmost contempt\r\nand actual abuse by the white travelers.\r\n\r\n“The propensity to beg or steal seemed born in the original Plains\r\nIndian. They made away with any portable article at hand from seemingly\r\nsheer love of theft. And beg! they would beg one blind! They wanted\r\neverything in sight, yet in early days, they made no disturbance if they\r\nwere given nothing. It actually seemed as if an Indian could not help\r\nbegging or stealing, but, instead of accepting this as a fact and\r\ntreating it accordingly with wise leniency, the Whites made use of\r\nneedless cruelty. When an Indian picked up something and hid it under\r\nhis blanket to carry away, he was black-snaked, or kicked out of camp. I\r\nonce saw an Indian climb up on the hind wheel of a big freight wagon and\r\nlift up the wagon sheet. As he was peeping in, with his back bent and\r\nbody exposed much as if he were bent over a barrel, a bull-whacker, with\r\na big ox-whip, stood off ten feet and let him have it on the naked skin.\r\nThat Indian dropped as if he were shot, with a gash where the lash\r\nstruck as if a sharp knife had cut him. There were many other Indians in\r\ncamp, and they all jumped up and halloed and laughed uproariously at the\r\ndiscomfited one, who crept humbly out of camp. Many indignities like\r\nthis were given the Indians without their retaliating, even though there\r\nwere often many more Indians than Whites in the party, which\r\nconclusively proves the superior peacefulness of the redskin. This was\r\nas late as 1863. But soon there came a change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OGLALA WOMAN\r\n\r\n  Pine Ridge, 1909. Photographed by W. K. Moorehead.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The Indian wars of the Plains were more the result of a combination of\r\ncauses, added to those already mentioned. First, our Government\r\ncommenced a wishy-washy, desultory course with the Indians, instead of\r\ntaking a bold, firm stand with them, and bringing out enough soldiers to\r\noverawe and make them respect the Government by showing them how strong\r\nit was, thus making them understand what to expect if they did not\r\nbehave themselves. The Government policy was so weak at the beginning,\r\nthat the Indians actually laughed at it and said: ‘The Government is\r\nafraid of us; it dare not punish us’; and this was their real belief. I\r\nheard some Kiowas braggingly say, ‘Why, we can whip the United States,\r\nfor it has been fighting Texas for years and cannot whip her. We go and\r\nsweep down upon her settlements, kill, burn, and destroy, drive off\r\nstock, take women and children prisoners, and make the settlers glad to\r\nhide.’ This was at the time of the Civil War, and the Kiowas thought the\r\nGovernment was fighting only Texas.\r\n\r\n“Now then, as I have said, the Government began with the Indians in a\r\nvery feeble way and sent a few troops after them, which, of course, the\r\nIndians bested and forced to retreat. Then a large force was sent which\r\nalso was beaten, and, after repeated little fights and skirmishes, large\r\narmies were sent out. Usually, however, the Indians got the best of the\r\ntroops and were thus emboldened and given new confidence in themselves\r\nand their strength.\r\n\r\n“I have been a stockman all my life, and whenever my cattle became\r\n‘breachy’, if the break they made in my fence was poorly mended, it was\r\nbroken through again and again. Each time we repaired the fence a little\r\nbetter than before, but each time, also, the cattle acquired fresh skill\r\nand force in breaking down the fence. At last, it was impossible to fix\r\nthe fence in a way that my herds could not break through. If I had made\r\nthe fence good and strong when first repairing it, the trouble would\r\nhave been settled at once, and the cattle would never have broken it\r\ndown the second time. A comparison between my haphazard fence and\r\nbreachy cattle, and the Government’s Indian policy of years ago is the\r\nmost fitting I can make.”\r\n\r\nWright believes that the military authorities at Washington were rather\r\nresponsible for continuation of an unwise policy toward the Indians, and\r\nis somewhat critical as to the plans of campaign. It was a great mistake\r\nto send infantry against Indians, but this was repeatedly done. In the\r\nFetterman massacre, the troops were infantry. The cavalry horses of the\r\n’60’s and ’70’s were grain-fed, and extra large. Cavalry commands were\r\naccompanied by a wagon-train in which grain and hay were hauled. Hence,\r\nprior to Custer’s later campaigns, the American cavalry made little\r\nprogress as against Indians. The latter went very light, carrying a\r\nlittle dried buffalo meat, guns and ammunition. Each Indian warrior\r\nalways possessed an extra horse—his war pony—which was never ridden\r\nexcept in battle. He rode his ordinary pony, and led the other. In this\r\nway the Indian soldiers had an advantage over the white cavalry. Mr.\r\nWright says that the Indians feared winter attacks on their camps. They\r\nseldom made war during cold weather. The warriors endeavored to lead the\r\ntroops away from their permanent villages.\r\n\r\n“General Sully found this out, in 1868, when he supposed he was marching\r\nupon an Indian village from which the families had been removed and\r\nhidden in another direction, while the warriors led Sully on a\r\nwild-goose chase into the Wichita Mountains. It is a wonder his whole\r\ncommand was not annihilated, and if he had followed the Indians a little\r\nfurther, not a soldier would have escaped, the trap was so well set. But\r\nSully realized the danger just in time, turned around, got out of the\r\nmountains almost by a miracle, returning to Fort Dodge for\r\nreinforcements, with the Indians harassing him all the way back. This\r\nambush and defeat was a source of great mortification to General Sully.\r\nGeneral Custer then took the field with big reinforcements, and\r\nsurprised the Indian camp on the Wichita River; but, after the attack,\r\nCuster, too, was forced to beat a hasty retreat to Camp Supply, as he\r\nfound himself greatly outnumbered nearly ten to one. He inflicted on the\r\nIndians a severe punishment, taking nearly two hundred women and\r\nchildren prisoners, which greatly disheartened the Indians for a while.\r\nBut this success was in the dead of winter, and might have resulted\r\ndifferently had it happened in the summer season, with the Indian\r\nfighting according to his views of proper war tactics. (_See picture,\r\npage 302._)\r\n\r\n“It was a big mistake of the National Government to appoint civilians\r\nand representatives of different religious denominations as Government\r\nAgents. We should have appointed army officers instead, at a post where\r\nthere was also an agency. This was merely a necessity of the times and\r\nconditions, clearly visible to anybody in the least acquainted with the\r\nneeds of the situation. Soldiers were always stationed at an agency, the\r\ncommander of that post was always subject to the orders of the Agent, a\r\ncivilian often wholly unqualified to direct military movements or\r\nfrontier exploits, and the ideas of commander and Agent were nearly\r\nalways in conflict. The officer bitterly resented being subject to the\r\nAgent’s orders and certainly the former, familiar as he was with the\r\nborder and Indian, knew better than the Agent could know, coming as he\r\ndid, as a rule, direct from civilized centers. While treating them\r\nkindly and fairly, an army officer would have governed the Indian with a\r\nfirm hand, and with none of the little less than criminal weakness\r\ndisplayed by many of the Agents. Moreover, most of the Agents were not\r\ngood men, and not only robbed the Indian but starved him. I personally\r\nknew of graft practised by several Agents by which the Indian suffered\r\ngreatly. Let me cite one of many instances of weakness that fell under\r\nmy own observation. Mr. Darlington, Agent of the Cheyenne and Arapaho,\r\nwas a good old Quaker, but weak and unsophisticated to a marked degree.\r\nI was sutler for the soldiers at this agency, and these Indians had\r\nstolen a lot of horses and mules from me. One issue day, the Indians\r\nrode in, and I saw several of my horses and mules, bearing my brand,\r\namong their stock. Now, the Indians who had possession of my horses\r\nbelonged to Stone Calf’s band. Stone Calf was one of the head chiefs of\r\nthe Cheyennes, a man of more than ordinary intelligence, and a pretty\r\ntruthful Indian. I went to Mr. Darlington, told my story, and asked him\r\nto recover my stock for me. He promised to do so, sent for Stone Calf,\r\nand said to him: ‘This young man is truthful and honest, and he says you\r\nhave a lot of his stock (describing the brand). Now, Stone Calf, you are\r\na good, honest, truthful Indian, and I have always found you square;\r\ngive this young man back his stock.’ Stone Calf drew himself up with\r\nsuperb dignity and fairly breathed disdain at the Agent’s suggestion. ‘I\r\nhave no doubt that this stock did belong to the young man,’ he replied,\r\n‘but it belongs to me now. I took it when I was at war, and I never give\r\nback anything I take when I am at war.’ That settled the matter and I\r\nnever recovered my stock. An army officer in the Agent’s place would\r\nhave said: ‘This stock belongs to Wright; give it up to him at once!’\r\nand he would have been obeyed and nothing more would have come of it.\r\n\r\n“Again, had military instead of civilian Agents been appointed, the\r\nwholesale robbery of the Indians already mentioned, and system of graft\r\nin general that went on would have been largely avoided, the Indian\r\nbenefited, and trouble averted. Remote as he always was from\r\nsurveillance, with large quantities of Government supplies entrusted to\r\nhis care for the use of the Indians, the temptation to dishonest\r\npractices for private gain was great to every Agent. Mr. Darlington,\r\nalready mentioned as Agent of the Cheyennes, was as honest an old man as\r\never lived and, being so, seemed to think everyone else honest too, but\r\nhis employees stole from the Indians right and left, and robbed them\r\nright along, under his very eye, and he was not aware of what was going\r\non. The graft of the agencies was notoriously well-known on the\r\nfrontier, and many an Agent became actually rich from the spoils of his\r\noffice. The Indians realized the state of affairs and resented it, and\r\nadded it as another brand to the fire of their hostility against the\r\nWhites. The big old chief Red Cloud once said: ‘I don’t see why the\r\nGovernment changes our Agents. When one Agent gets rich at his trade of\r\nlooking after us and has about all he wants, he may stop his stealing\r\nand leave us the property which belongs to us, if he keeps his place.\r\nBut when one man grows fat at our expense, he is removed and a lean man\r\nsent to take his place, and we must fill his belly till he is fat also,\r\nand give way to another lean one!’”\r\n\r\nMr. Wright calls attention to the fact that the army officer was a\r\nbetter judge of human nature than the civilian and he further had the\r\nadvantage of discipline. Surrounded as he was by numerous associates\r\naspiring to promotion, he dared not steal Government supplies lest he be\r\nfound out, and drummed out of the army. With a civilian it was very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n“History gives no more striking example in proof of feeble Governmental\r\npolicy with the Plains Indians in combination with the pitiful\r\nincapacity of some of the civilian Agents, than the story of the last\r\nIndian raid through western Kansas and Nebraska in 1878. It seems that\r\nfor no better reason than that they wished to have all the Cheyenne\r\nIndians in one band, the Indian officials of the Government gave orders\r\nfor the removal of the Northern Cheyennes from their agency in Dakota,\r\nto that of the Southern Cheyennes at Fort Reno, in what is now Oklahoma.\r\nThe Northern Cheyennes did not wish to move and protested vigorously,\r\nbut in vain. Being unused to the southern climate, it was not long after\r\ntheir arrival at Fort Reno, before malaria appeared among them, numbers\r\nbecame sick and many died. Terror-stricken at this almost unknown\r\nexperience, they became possessed with the idea that the water they had\r\nto drink in the new country was poisoned, and that all would die if they\r\nremained. Going to the Agent, they begged to be allowed to return to\r\ntheir northern home, but were refused. Then provisions began to grow\r\nscarce. The Cheyennes applied to the Agent for permission to go on a\r\nbuffalo hunt to gain food. Permission was granted, but the buffalo had\r\nbeen practically exterminated in that locality, and, though they hunted\r\nfor days, not a buffalo could be found, and the poor savages were in\r\nworse condition than before. They were forced to kill their few scrawny\r\nponies for meat to sustain life until they could return to the agency,\r\nand there they killed their dogs and lived upon them for a while. Again\r\nthey begged to be permitted to return to the North, and again they were\r\nrefused. In pity for their distress, however, the Commander of the fort\r\ngave orders that a small ration should be distributed among them, but it\r\nis almost certain that a large portion of this was confiscated by\r\nunscrupulous assistants, and that very little of it ever reached the\r\nneedy Indians. Their condition rendered them fairly desperate. They\r\nresolved to return to Dakota at any cost. ‘We may as well die fighting,’\r\nsaid Dull Knife, the Cheyenne chief and leader, ‘as to stay here and die\r\nof starvation.’ They began stealing and concealing guns, ammunition, and\r\nwhat provisions they could spare from their scanty stock. When ready to\r\nstart, they stole horses, and, with a few mounted warriors, their\r\nforaging operations were rapidly extended until an abundance of mounts,\r\narms, and provisions were obtained. Women and children took part in the\r\nexodus, and the march was very leisurely, but notwithstanding this fact,\r\nthe troops sent in pursuit were defeated in battle about sixty miles\r\nfrom Reno, and afterwards proceeded in so careless a fashion, that the\r\nIndians were not again overtaken till they reached Sand Creek, about\r\nforty miles south of Dodge City. Here, however, the troops completely\r\nsurrounded the Indian camp and might have recaptured the fugitives with\r\nease, but the superior cunning and energy of the Indians were here again\r\nstrikingly apparent, for they managed to slip away in safety during the\r\nnight, the soldiers not discovering the escape until two days after it\r\noccurred. The flight and leisurely pursuit was resumed, but the Indians\r\nhad killed very few Whites until they reached White Woman creek in\r\nWestern Kansas. Here they were again overtaken by the soldiers and an\r\nengagement fought. If Colonel Lewis, who had joined the pursuing\r\ndetachment with reinforcements, had not been killed, it is probable the\r\nIndians would have been defeated and recaptured, but the troops,\r\ndeprived of a leader in Lewis’s death, showed the white feather, and\r\nonce more allowed the Cheyennes to slip away in safety. From thence\r\nonward, emboldened by success and filled with contempt for the Whites by\r\nthe indolence of the troops, the progress of the Indians was marked by\r\nhorrible bloodshed and devastation. Their course was practically\r\nunchecked, and they reached the northern agency, at length, thus\r\nattaining the object of their expedition.\r\n\r\n“It was the Indian’s nature to be cruel, and many of the conflicts\r\nbetween him and the Whites of the Plains were caused by the Whites’\r\nretaliatory measures for some atrocity born of Indian cruelty. On the\r\nother hand, as has already been hinted, many Indian cruelties arose from\r\nneedless, petty cruelties and indignities, inflicted upon the latter by\r\nthe Whites and afterwards avenged. These relations of hostility existed\r\nbetween the Indians and all classes of Whites on the Plains, excepting,\r\npossibly, the cowboy. He and the Indian had little to do with each\r\nother, therefore they had few encounters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BETTER CLASS OF FULL-BLOOD PLAINS INDIANS OF THIRTY YEARS AGO\r\n]\r\n\r\n“It is often asked—since the United States had so much trouble with her\r\nwestern Indians, why has Canada had no trouble with hers? There are\r\nseveral good reasons. First, Canada, from the start, had a better method\r\nof dealing with the Indians. She was firm with them, and never deviated\r\nin the least from this course. They were awed by the Canadian police,\r\nand it is a well-known fact that this mounted police really protected\r\nCanada’s frontier. Whiskey peddlers, as well as fugitive criminals, knew\r\nthis, and knew how firm and just these police were, and the Indians\r\nentertained the same feeling toward them. Second, the Canadian\r\nGovernment always strictly kept its word with the Indians and never\r\nbroke its agreements with them. It invited and warranted their\r\nconfidence. Moreover, the Indians claimed no land over in Canada, as\r\nthey did in the United States, and their best reason for keeping peace\r\nwith the former when at war with the latter, was that they might have a\r\nrefuge at hand, to which to fly in times of need. When they crossed the\r\nCanadian line, they knew they were safe from hostile pursuit. It was a\r\nhealthy country, well watered by clear, cold streams; mountainous, where\r\nIndians could easily hide when hard pressed. It had plenty of game to\r\nsustain them, and beautiful, warm valleys, full of nutritious grasses\r\nand plenty of wood, where they could winter comfortably and feel in\r\nsafety and at home. In summer it was an equally ideal place to live. It\r\nwas also a place where they found a ready market for stolen horses and\r\nsold them to advantage. One may ask why they could not have selected\r\nTexas for like purposes. Well, for just the opposite reasons from those\r\nwhich led them to select Canada. Texas was much more unhealthy; they had\r\nalways been at war with Texas, and besides, it was a glorious country\r\nupon which to forage. There they raided the frontier and not only got\r\nall the stock they wanted, but many other things that were useful to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“One should consider the natural propensities of the American Indian,\r\nand be convinced that he was better off in his original state than at\r\nthe present time, with all the so-called advantages civilization has\r\nbrought him. This was especially true of the Plains Indian. By nature he\r\nwas a nomad, a warrior, a hunter, living in the open air. Under\r\nconditions favoring this nature, he was a healthy, hardy, happy\r\nindividual, like any product of natural growth; under the absolute\r\nreversal from this to conditions imposed upon him by civilization, he\r\nbecame diseased, debilitated, and inferior; as might be expected from\r\nany unnatural growth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE PLAINS INDIANS OF TODAY\r\n\r\nDesiring to present a contrast between the past and present, in all its\r\ndetails, I wrote to numbers of missionaries among Indians, selecting\r\nthose who had served for a long time. One of the missionaries on a large\r\nreservation where are located thousands of Sioux, answered me at length,\r\nand I present some of his recommendations. He speaks Sioux fluently. I\r\nhave taken the liberty of changing a few expressions. His suggestions\r\nare brief, but contain much sound common sense. His letter was written\r\nin 1909, and some of the reforms he advocates have been inaugurated, but\r\nthey have not been made general. This worthy missionary presents an\r\naccurate picture of conditions among the larger bands of Plains Indians\r\n(with some exceptions) at the present time. These Indians were entirely\r\nself-supporting forty years ago, and for their present deplorable\r\ncondition, we, rather than they, are responsible.\r\n\r\n“What strikes one most of all is the great poverty of these people. The\r\nmajority suffer very much from hunger, because they do not know how to\r\nmake a living. But they could make a good living for themselves, we\r\nbelieve, if they would but plant a couple of acres, say one acre corn,\r\none acre potatoes. However, most of them will never do so unless they\r\nare held down to it. It is useless to treat with them as with white\r\nadults. They are nothing but grown-up children, not knowing what they\r\nwant, and above all not knowing what is good for them. For this reason\r\nwe ought to have more farmers who would see to it that these things are\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“The Indian is a great traveller. Sometimes he does so for work, most\r\ngenerally for pleasure. Of what use is it to go to the railroad and work\r\nthere for a few weeks, come back with little, find all his hay devoured\r\nby other people’s stock, his own cattle and horses scattered over the\r\ncountry, and several head missing?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“They should be supplied with seed in time; plenty but not many kinds,\r\nwith the distinct understanding that they must pay for it before the\r\nnext issue of money, or else it will be taken out of that. If they learn\r\nhow to grow potatoes, corn and pumpkins or turnips, they have enough to\r\nstart with. They ought to learn how to grind this corn and make\r\ncornbread. If they raise corn, they could easily keep chickens, pigs,\r\nmilk cows, and have butter and eggs and cheese, just what the\r\nconsumptive needs. Of course it may be necessary before the crops are\r\nmatured to issue rations until the harvest time comes, _i. e._, for a\r\nyear or two. After that they ought to have enough provisions to last\r\nthem the year around. Indians ought to have facilities for buying pigs\r\nand chickens at ordinary market prices. In fact, they ought to be able\r\nto buy all their groceries at market prices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Another hindrance is the habit of visiting. Some go away for months at\r\na time on a visit. Horses, cattle, and all are left to themselves or the\r\nwolves. When some one is sick, even if only a baby, work is quit,\r\nrelatives have to come from miles and miles, etc. Sometimes they will go\r\noff to the Crows, Arapahoes, etc., and get a present of horses. Chances\r\nare that the Crows will be back here next year getting another present.\r\n\r\n“A third hindrance is—to my mind—the method of work adopted here. (My\r\nintention is not to criticise but to offer a suggestion.) The Indians\r\nhave to leave their homes and work on the roads for $1.25 per day.\r\nConsequently, they cannot look after their places nor take care of\r\nanything else. In the long run it is a loss. One head of stock lost at\r\nhome, means one month’s wages gone. Why could the Indians not make their\r\nmoney at home? Let them do the work that has been suggested, to\r\ncultivate their fields, to plant, etc.; have the District farmers\r\ncontrol them and make payment for work done. Many of the thoughts above\r\nare the sentiments of the better class of Indians, so you may be sure\r\nthere will be little opposition on their part to putting these, or\r\nsimilar plans, into operation.\r\n\r\n“A fourth hindrance is the fact that so many go away to Buffalo Bill\r\nshows, etc., leaving wife, children and everything behind. When such an\r\nIndian gets back, some one else is liable to have his wife and\r\ncattle—not mentioning bad habits and shameful diseases he sometimes\r\nbrings back.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“But it is the old people that ought to arouse the sympathy of us all.\r\nThey lie around in the utmost filth and neglect, eating old scraps, or\r\nswill; starving and freezing in spite of the fact that they draw\r\nrations. If they get help from anyone, it is devoured by the neighbors,\r\nand the poor old people have little benefit from it.\r\n\r\n“The children’s lot is a hard one, too. If they live at home, they have\r\nto go through the rain, mud, cold, etc., to get to the day school. In\r\nmany cases, the family must camp near the day-school. Then they have to\r\nneglect their own home entirely.\r\n\r\n“At present, the prevailing idea seems to be that the best way to do\r\nwith the Indian now is to throw him upon his own resources. If the plan\r\noutlined above or something similar were carried out for a few years,\r\none could do so. To do so at present would mean, I think, a slaughter, a\r\nmassacre. Let a death come in his family and he may give away his last\r\nhoof. He may barter away every thing for a jug of whiskey. * * * * He is\r\nno match for the white man, especially when the latter is accompanied by\r\nwhat the Sioux call “Holy Water,” and therefore it would be nothing but\r\nmurder to mix up the Indians with Whites too rapidly on this\r\nreservation.\r\n\r\n“The civilizing of the Indians is a slow process. When some change is\r\ngoing to be made it ought to be announced long ahead, and then the red\r\nman can prepare for it. Otherwise he is simply carried off his feet,\r\ndazed, doesn’t know where to go, or what to do. It is all right to say,\r\nlet those who do not want to work starve, but what about the innocent\r\nfamily, what about his ‘sponging’ on the others as they call it? One\r\nIndian cannot refuse another anything (especially as they are all\r\nrelations) without being ostracized.\r\n\r\n“I note what you say about tuberculosis, and must say that the opposite\r\nought to be true, but it is not, for many reasons, most of which are\r\nmentioned above. Were it not for their careless and dirty habits, their\r\nlack of food and proper care, they ought to be the strongest race on the\r\nface of the earth. By proper treatment many cases could be cured. As it\r\nis they all die. Two physicians cannot tend to everybody on so large a\r\nreservation and with their limited means.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“These are a few things that I thought I should mention in order to\r\nfully answer your questions. By doing so, I did not in the least mean to\r\ncriticise anyone in the Service, for I know that much has been tried and\r\ndone in the past. Still I believe with the other missionaries, that the\r\nIndians can be saved if we try the methods suggested above or similar\r\nones.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                CHAPTER XXXI. THE INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n\r\nNo scientist has devoted more time and study to the California Indians\r\nthan Dr. A. L. Kroeber. In his description of California tribes and\r\nstocks, published in the Handbook of American Indians, he states that\r\nthe California natives are rather shorter than the majority of those in\r\neastern North America, and in the south, they are unusually dark. The\r\nastonishing characteristic of California Indians is their diversified\r\nlanguages. There are twenty-one distinct linguistic families. The larger\r\nstocks such as the Athapascan, Shoshonean and Yuman have forced their\r\nway into the State, whereas the great majority are small bands and may\r\nbe considered purely Californian.\r\n\r\nWhile pottery was practically unknown, textile arts (particularly\r\nbasket-making) were very highly developed. “Houses were often made of\r\ngrass, tule, or brush, or of bark, sometimes covered with earth. Only in\r\nthe northwest part of the State were small houses of planks in use. In\r\nthis region, as well as on the Santa Barbara islands, wooden canoes were\r\nalso made, but over the greater part of the State a raft of tules was\r\nthe only means of navigation. Agriculture was nowhere practised. Deer\r\nand small game were hunted, and there was considerable fishing; but the\r\nbulk of the food was vegetable. The main reliance was placed on numerous\r\nvarieties of acorns, and next to these, on seeds, especially of grasses\r\nand herbs. Roots and berries were less used.[58]\r\n\r\n“Both totemism and a true gentile organization were totally lacking in\r\nall parts of the State. The mythology of the Californians was\r\ncharacterized by unusually well-developed and consistent creation myths,\r\nand by the complete lack not only of migration but of ancestor\r\ntraditions. Their ceremonies were numerous and elaborate as compared\r\nwith the prevailing simplicity of life, but they lacked almost totally\r\nthe rigid ritualism and extensive symbolism that pervade the ceremonies\r\nof most of America. One set of ceremonies was usually connected with a\r\nsecret religious society; another, often spectacular, was held in\r\nremembrance of the dead.”\r\n\r\nWe are concerned in this book with the condition of the California\r\nIndians the past sixty years. Without an exception on the American\r\ncontinent, there is no area in which the native population has so\r\nsuddenly and generally diminished. The confiscation of the mission\r\nproperties by the Mexican Government, followed by the great influx of\r\ngold-hunters, adventurers and ranchmen from 1849–1860, are responsible\r\nfor the deplorable condition in which these Indians found themselves\r\nabout 1880. Prior to the influx of the Forty-niners, the Indians had\r\nbeen self-supporting (although the action of the Mexican government came\r\nnear bringing about their destruction). California people themselves\r\ntook little interest in the wretched condition of the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants and it was not until the United States Board of Indian\r\nCommissioners and the Indian Rights Association became active and sent\r\ncommissions or individuals to California, that reforms were inaugurated.\r\nHonorable Albert K. Smiley, a citizen of California (and founder of the\r\nLake Mohonk Conference) was especially active in this humanitarian work.\r\nA Mr. Painter was sent out by the Indian Rights Association in 1885.\r\nPainter made a thorough investigation and laid formal complaint, with\r\nthe backing of the Mohonk Conference, before the President of the United\r\nStates. The usual delays occurred. The President referred the matter to\r\nthe Attorney General, who in turn referred it to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior. The Indian Rights Association now assumed responsibility, and\r\nMr. Herbert Welsh, Secretary of that organization, sent his check for\r\n$3,300 to be held while the case of the Indians was pending before the\r\ncourt.[59]\r\n\r\nThe wrongs of the Indians were made public at Lake Mohonk by various\r\nspeakers, and through the country generally by Mrs. H. H. Jackson. The\r\ncase of the mission Indians, sustained by these various organizations\r\nand individuals, was heard in the courts and resulted in victory for the\r\nIndians of California.\r\n\r\nDuring the ’90’s the Indians were further evicted and became exceedingly\r\ndestitute. Many died of starvation. The Indians seemed utterly unable to\r\nprotect themselves and miners and ranchmen alike took every advantage of\r\nthem. As an illustration of the situation in California as compared with\r\nthat in the Black Hills, South Dakota, I will here relate a story told\r\nme at Deadwood in 1889.\r\n\r\nA miner, who had spent some ten years in California, came to the Black\r\nHills about 1875, when gold was discovered. He wore on his watch-chain,\r\nas a fob, two Indian teeth. In a Deadwood dance hall he informed some\r\nconvivial companions, that on one occasion he took a California Indian\r\nby the hair and struck him in the mouth with his six-shooter, knocking\r\nout several teeth. Two of these he had a jeweler drill and wire to his\r\nwatch-chain, as souvenirs. An old trapper, who happened to be present,\r\nsuggested that the miner procure one or two Sioux teeth, as they might\r\nbe different from “Digger teeth”, and would add to his collection. Out\r\nin the foothills in the course of a few days, the miner met a Sioux\r\nIndian, seized him and undertook to treat him as he had the poor\r\nCalifornia native. Instead of teeth, as a souvenir he received a\r\nknife-thrust between the ribs and was lucky to escape with his life.\r\n\r\nWhile interest in the California Indians seemed to lag, Charles F.\r\nLummis, Esq., a citizen of the State, and editor of a prominent western\r\npublication, _The Land of Sunshine_, began a campaign in the early 90’s\r\non behalf of the various tribes and bands, most of whom had been evicted\r\nfrom their ancient homes. I present a brief bibliography of Mr. Lummis’\r\narticles at the conclusion of this chapter, as they sum up in a masterly\r\nfashion the wrongs of the Indian, and the efforts of good citizens to\r\nright them. In all my reading, I have seen no stronger, more direct and\r\ninteresting appeals than these made by Mr. Lummis in his journal (now\r\npublished under the title, _Out West_.)\r\n\r\nThe National Indian Association through its Northern California Branch\r\nbecame active; there was formed the California Indian Association of\r\nwhich C. E. Kelsey, Esq., a prominent California attorney, was elected\r\nSecretary. This organization cooperated with the others and the Board of\r\nIndian Commissioners and should be credited with the salvation of the\r\nremaining few thousand California aborigines from pauperism.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelsey cooperated with Mr. Lummis and really represented the people\r\nof California. At last Congress was forced to act, the Indian Office\r\ninstituted reforms (which it should have inaugurated more than twenty\r\nyears ago) and satisfactory results were obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelsey at my request kindly prepared for me a summary of the\r\nCalifornia Indians and the work of rescue as projected by friends, and\r\ncarried to perfection through his intelligent and unselfish labors. He\r\nhas also written me a long letter and I take the liberty of appending in\r\nthe form of footnotes a number of extracts from his letter, in addition\r\nto the article.\r\n\r\n\r\n          MR. KELSEY’S BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal population of California was large, possibly equal to\r\nthat of all the rest of the United States. Powers, in his “Indians of\r\nCalifornia,” 1877, a work which has been liberally quoted by about\r\neveryone who has since written of the California Indians, estimates the\r\nnumber at 750,000. Barbour and Wozencraft, who traveled over the State\r\nin 1851 as members of the California Indian Commission, estimated the\r\nnative population to be between 200,000 and 300,000. C. Hart Merriam[60]\r\nestimates the numbers at the beginning of the nineteenth century at\r\n260,000. Dr. Kroeber estimates the number at not less than 150,000. The\r\nfigures of the Bureau of Indian Affairs for 1913 shows a little less\r\nthan 20,000, being slightly larger than the U. S. census for 1910. This\r\ndecrease is certainly extraordinary, being nearly 90% of the most\r\nconservative estimate of former population, and nearly all taking place\r\nwithin the memories of persons now living. The causes are variously\r\ngiven as war, famine, whiskey, disease, etc., and all doubtless played\r\ntheir parts in the decrease. Dr. Merriam states the causes as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LINGUISTIC STOCKS IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n  From Handbook of American Indians.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The principal cause of the appallingly great and rapid decrease in the\r\nIndians of California is not the number directly slain by the Whites, or\r\nthe number directly killed by whiskey or disease, but a much more subtle\r\nand dreadful thing: it is the gradual but progressive and resistless\r\nconfiscation of their lands and homes, in consequence of which they are\r\nforced to seek refuge in remote and barren localities, often far from\r\nwater, usually with an impoverished supply of food, and not\r\ninfrequently, in places where the winter climate is too severe for their\r\nenfeebled constitutions. Victims of the aggressive selfishness of the\r\nWhites, outcasts in the land of their fathers, outraged in their most\r\nsacred institutions, weakened in body, broken in spirit, and fully\r\nconscious of the hopelessness of their condition, must we wonder that\r\nthe wail for the dead is often heard in their camps?”\r\n\r\nThe Special Investigating Agent, appointed under the Act of March 3,\r\n1905, states it as largely due to the “progressive absorption by the\r\nwhite race of the Indians’ every means of existence.”[61] During the\r\nfamines to which all Indian bands were subject after the American\r\noccupation, the old people and especially the children would die.\r\n\r\nAfter California was fully American, the National Government at\r\nWashington, sent out a Commission of distinguished citizens, as it has\r\ndone many times in other parts of the country, to make treaties with the\r\nCalifornia Indians. This commission consisted of the Honorable George W.\r\nBarbour, Honorable Redick McKee and Honorable O. M. Wozencraft. They\r\ntraveled about with a military escort and made treaties with all Indians\r\nwest of the Sierra Nevada, about 90% of all in the State at that time.\r\nTwo treaties were made by the whole Commission. They then separated,\r\neach member taking a different part of the State. Four treaties were\r\nmade by Redick McKee, four by George W. Barbour and eight by O. M.\r\nWozencraft. John C. Fremont, E. D. Keyes, George Stoneman, and others\r\nafterward well known, signed as witnesses to some of these eighteen\r\ntreaties. The treaties were much alike and were all definite and simple.\r\nIn each treaty the Indians accepted the sovereignty of the United\r\nStates, agreed to keep the peace with Whites and with other Indians,\r\nceded to the United States their title to their lands and agreed to\r\naccept reservations, duly laid out by metes and bounds in the treaties.\r\nOn its part the United States reserved for Indian use forever the\r\nspecified reservations and agreed to pay for the lands ceded by the\r\nIndians, in goods, not cash. When these treaties went to Washington,\r\nthey were accompanied by a statement calling attention to the\r\nextraordinary cheapness of the lands acquired and congratulating\r\nthemselves and the country upon the fact that the Indians were too\r\nunsophisticated to demand annuities or money. The goods promised\r\nconsisted of thousands of beeves, thousands of sacks of flour, thousands\r\nof blankets, suits of clothes, dresses, tools, work animals, cloth,\r\niron, steel, etc., worth about $1,000,000 at that time. Teachers,\r\nschools, blacksmiths, farmers, etc., were also promised on a large\r\nscale. The reservations promised aggregate more than seven and a half\r\nmillion acres of land. The eighteen treaties were signed by 422 chiefs\r\nrepresenting 180 tribes, or bands. Some of the reservations were laid\r\nout in the mining districts and there was much opposition to the\r\ntreaties among the miners. At that time, 1851–’52, Indian treaties were\r\nsubmitted to the Senate of the United States for ratification. These\r\neighteen California treaties were duly brought before the Senate and\r\nwere not ratified. Nothing further was heard about them until, fifty-two\r\nyears later, they were discovered in the secret archives of the Senate,\r\nthe injunction of secrecy removed and the treaties published. The\r\nGovernment of the United States seems never to have made any attempt to\r\nmake any other or further treaties. The Government nevertheless has\r\ntaken the land and the reservations, as well, and every other benefit to\r\nbe derived from the eighteen treaties, but has not on its part paid the\r\nprice agreed or carried out any other engagement then made. It would\r\nseem that if the Government received the benefits of the treaties, it\r\nshould pay the price agreed, whether the treaties were ratified or not,\r\nand that the Government should have taken some steps to acquire the\r\nIndian right of occupancy, a right which has not been legally terminated\r\nto this day. The failure of the treaties and the ensuing period of\r\ninaction by the National Government, were disastrous to the Indians of\r\nCalifornia. Not a foot of land remained which they could call their own.\r\nThere was no source of aboriginal food supply which might not be\r\nappropriated by some white man any day, and most of the country was soon\r\nappropriated for mines or cattle or agriculture. The Indians were forced\r\ninto a hand-to-mouth existence, interspersed with periods of famine,\r\nduring which the rising generation perished. A great variety of\r\ndiseases, previously unknown, were introduced among the Indians, against\r\nwhich they had no inherited immunity. Diseases which among white people\r\nare considered of little consequence, such as whooping-cough, measles,\r\netc., are fatal to Indians, especially during periods of scarcity. The\r\nmore virulent diseases such as smallpox, tuberculosis, etc., also took\r\ntheir toll from the Indian camps, and whiskey claimed its thousands of\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nIn any other part of the United States, the failure of the treaties\r\nwould doubtless have resulted in a general Indian war. This was not\r\npossible in California. The extraordinary number of Indian dialects\r\n(over 135 are now known), belonging to some twenty diverse and\r\nantagonistic racial stocks, was enough in itself, to have prevented\r\nanything like united action. Within a year or so California was occupied\r\nby from 100,000 to 200,000 active, vigorous, masterful men, armed with\r\nthe best weapons of the day. The Indians could not have mustered 30,000\r\nwarriors in the mining districts and possibly not in all California, and\r\nthey were armed with bows and arrows and clubs.[62] The Indian cause was\r\nhopeless from the start. Nevertheless, there ensued a period of near\r\nwar, with occasional clashes between Indians and Whites, which was fully\r\nas disastrous to the Indians as an open campaign would have been. The\r\nencounters are referred to, locally, as “battles”, of which quite a\r\nlarge number are recorded. The Indians were usually surrounded and shot\r\ndown by posses of miners and citizens, in retaliation of some aggression\r\nby the Indians, or some alleged aggression. Some Indian bands are known\r\nto have been “wiped out” because their room was wanted by cattle men or\r\nsettlers. No action by the Federal Government for the protection of the\r\nIndians is recorded. In one case the difficulties resulted in actual\r\nborder warfare. The Hupa Indians, goaded into action by the influx of\r\nsettlers into their valley, went on the warpath, during the sixties.\r\nThey were joined by their neighbors, the Yurocs, or Lower Klamaths, and\r\na sharp frontier war ensued for a couple of years. The Government\r\nfinally bought out the squatters, restored the land to the Indians and\r\ngave the Hupas and Yurocs definite reservations. A similar trouble arose\r\nat Round Valley in the eighties, but war was averted by one of those\r\ncompromises well known in the West, under which the Indians received\r\none-quarter of their own land and the settlers received three-quarters.\r\n\r\nReports published from time to time at Washington show that the Indian\r\nOffice was not wholly without knowledge of Indian conditions in\r\nCalifornia, but little was attempted and less accomplished for Indian\r\nrelief. Several reservations were established, or attempted to be\r\nestablished by Executive order. One was invalidated by the Courts, which\r\nheld the land to be within a Mexican land grant. One was raided and\r\nseized by settlers, who had sufficient political influence to hold the\r\nland and secure the cancellation of the Executive order. One was laid\r\nout with fine timber included and another was desired by cattlemen and\r\nsufficient influence was concentrated upon Congress to secure their\r\n“opening to settlement”. Only one small reservation of that period\r\nremains to this day, and this one, Tule River, was diminished in size\r\nmore than half, without the knowledge or consent of the Indians. The few\r\nitems appearing in the Indian Office reports, or in reports to the Board\r\nof Indian Commissioners, were rather more optimistic than the situation\r\nwarranted, for the officers making those reports were at the same time\r\ngiving an account of their own stewardship and doubtless mentioned as\r\nmany favorable things as they could. The fact that favorable items were\r\nso few is eloquent of the conditions then existing. Dr. C. Hart Merriam\r\nestimates that the California Indians were decreasing at an average rate\r\nof 7,000 per annum[63], and this must have been under conditions\r\ninvolving an appalling amount of misery and suffering. It was well\r\nunderstood that the California Indians were “fading away” rapidly, yet\r\nit seems to have occurred to no one to look into the matter and see why\r\nthe Indians were decreasing in numbers or what the physical steps were\r\nby which the Indians were being faded. Commissioner Wozencraft, in the\r\nearly fifties, published an appeal to the people of California, but it\r\nmet with no particular response. The process of ejecting Indians from\r\nthe ownership or possession of anything considered of value to any white\r\nman went on without check, and the number of Indians who perished\r\ndiminished each year, simply because there were fewer Indians left to\r\ndie. It was hardly to be expected that the members of this savage race\r\ncould at once readjust themselves to the fierce civilization under which\r\nthey had been submerged so suddenly, and only a few Indians were able to\r\ndo so. Nor could it be expected, doubtless, that the new white\r\npopulation, so largely from the Middle West, with 200 years’ traditions\r\nof Indian fighting behind them, should show any particular consideration\r\nfor Indians who were unable to fight. The attitude of the great majority\r\nof white citizens was apathetic, rather than hostile, and the more\r\nactive minority were allowed their will with the Indians. For years no\r\nlocal church seems to have made any efforts on behalf of Indians, and\r\nthough there were not wanting distinguished instances where individuals\r\nbraved local public opinion by standing out for the rights of Indians,\r\nthe effect upon the times was small. The attitude of the Californians is\r\nreflected by the provisions of their early codes in regard to Indians.\r\nSee Act of the Legislature of California approved April 22, 1850, Ch.\r\n408, section 3650 et seq. of the California Code of that day. Indians\r\nwere placed under justices of the peace. Originally an Indian could not\r\nsue or be sued, but this was altered in 1855. Cruel treatment of Indian\r\nminors was punishable by a fine of $10. Any Indian who had fallen into\r\nthe clutches of the law upon a finable offense, had his labor sold to\r\nthe highest bidder, until his fine was worked out, the purchaser giving\r\na bond for the fine.[64] Any Indian could upon the complaint of any\r\ncitizen, be haled into a justice court, adjudged an “able-bodied Indian\r\nvagrant” and his labor sold to the highest bidder for four months.[65]\r\nThese laws were never enforced very oppressively and had become a dead\r\nletter long before they were finally repealed in 1883. Nor were State\r\nlaws the only ones of which Indians might complain. After the American\r\noccupation, for some forty years, there was no practical way in which an\r\nIndian could in California acquire title to land from the public domain.\r\nThe Indian was not a citizen and could not select land under the\r\nhomestead or other land acts. He was not an alien and could not be\r\nnaturalized as a citizen. There was no law under which a California\r\nIndian could become a citizen, until the passage of the general\r\nallotment Act in 1887.[66] The Indian homestead Acts of 1875 and 1883\r\nwere of little value, as the technical requirements were too onerous, no\r\none was designated to see that Indians were assisted and few Indians\r\never heard of the Acts. Under the general allotment Act and subsequent\r\nto 1891, some 1800 Indian allotments were made in California. This\r\nallotting was done by Special Agents sent from Washington, who were\r\nunfamiliar with local conditions, hence water rights, soil qualities,\r\ntimber, etc., were not looked after, and at least two-thirds of these\r\nallotments were of little or no value to the Indian allottees. About\r\n1400 of the 1800 allotments were made in the five northeastern counties\r\nof the State and in these counties the few allotments that were\r\ninhabitable have proved of great value to the Indians. In the remainder\r\nof the State there was little land unappropriated and the allotment laws\r\nbrought no relief to the larger number of Indians.[67]\r\n\r\nThe period of war, near war and oppression lasted rather less than\r\ntwenty years and was succeeded by a period of eviction of somewhat\r\nlonger duration. At first, when a white man filed on a tract of land and\r\nsummarily ejected any Indians he might find living there, the Indians\r\ncould move on to some adjoining tract, where the opportunities for\r\nstarvation were equally good. But as time went on, land became much\r\nscarcer and fewer land owners were willing to allow Indians to occupy\r\ntheir ranches even in small part. The evictions continued and as those\r\nrecently evicted could find no unoccupied tract to live on, they began\r\nto crowd into other settlements, which had not yet been summoned to\r\nmove. The result was that in many parts of the State, the Indians\r\ngradually concentrated in small settlements, locally known as\r\nrancherias, where they lived upon the sufferance of some kindly-disposed\r\nland owner. A change in ownership of the land usually meant eviction for\r\nthe Indians. In these rancherias the conditions were unspeakable, both\r\nas to sanitation and morals. The Indians felt they were in their last\r\nditch and that there was nothing for them to look forward to but\r\nextinction. The Indians were surrounded by civilization, but not of it.\r\nThey came in contact chiefly with the vices of civilization and the\r\nvicious white element. Forty years after the American occupation\r\nthree-fourths of the California Indians had still to learn what a\r\nmissionary might be and nine-tenths of them were still heathen. The\r\npriest and the Levite had passed by on the other side, and the good\r\nSamaritan had been unavoidably detained in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe first general awakening as to conditions among the Indians of\r\nCalifornia came with the publication of Helen Hunt Jackson’s “Century of\r\nDishonor” and “Ramona”, in the eighties, and by 1890 Congress had passed\r\nan act for the relief of the Indians of Southern California. This was\r\nmuch needed. The Smiley Commission appointed under this Act increased\r\nthe number of small reservations in Southern California from about\r\nseventeen to thirty-four and enlarged most of those formerly in\r\nexistence. They were able to give a fixed indefeasible title and these\r\nIndians were thenceforward secure in their homes. The Smiley Commission\r\nwas not given funds sufficient to develop water upon the tracts\r\nreserved, a most important matter, for the Indians had been crowded into\r\nthe mountains and on to barren tracts, which no white man at that time\r\nwanted. The Southern California Indians had to wait some fifteen to\r\ntwenty years longer before an attempt was made to put their lands into\r\nhabitable shape, where they could live with some approach to comfort.\r\nThe Indians of Northern and Central California, numbering more than\r\nthree-fourths of those in the State, received no benefit from the\r\nawakening as to Southern California. Their necessities were fully as\r\ngreat and they were as fully deserving, but interest in the California\r\nIndians died away largely before anything was accomplished north of\r\nTehachipi. Two things did follow, first sending some allotting agents to\r\nNorthern California, where they did some good, though they largely\r\nfailed to live up to their opportunities, and second, a branch of the\r\nNational Indian Association was established in Northern California and\r\nmission and school work was begun among the Indians. The policy of this\r\nAssociation has been to establish a school or a mission and when it is\r\nin good working order to turn it over to some church or society that\r\nwill agree to carry on the work. Then the Association establishes\r\nanother mission in the same manner. Some twenty missions and schools,\r\nreaching about 12,000 Indians, have been established in California,\r\ndirectly or indirectly through the efforts of the National Indian\r\nAssociation or of its Northern California branch. For some eight or ten\r\nyears after the founding of the Northern California branch in 1894,\r\ntheir efforts were largely confined to the establishment of missions and\r\nschools among the Indians and to relieving such cases of distress as\r\ncame to their knowledge. There were considerable difficulties. No church\r\nor other organization could afford to take over or begin work unless\r\nthere was some fixity of tenure for the Indians. Where the Indians were\r\nsubject to eviction at any time, as the majority were, no one could\r\nafford to begin work, for their work might be dissipated any day and the\r\nIndians scattered. Hence, for the first few years the efforts were\r\nconfined to those places where Indians held land in some form.\r\n\r\nThe second awakening began about 1903, when the Northern California\r\nIndian Association, or as it is often called, the California Indian\r\nAssociation, began its campaign for the relief of the homeless Indians\r\nof California, then supposed to number about 8,000 souls. Every avenue\r\nof assistance proposed seemed to lead back to the land question. Without\r\nsome security of tenure it seemed impossible to accomplish any lasting\r\nimprovement in Indian conditions, and inasmuch as the landless condition\r\nof the Indians was due to the acts and omissions of the National\r\nGovernment, the Indian Association appealed to the Congress of the\r\nUnited States for relief, in so far as land was necessary. The\r\nAssociation did not ask for reservations, believing that more Indian\r\nreservations in California would be detrimental to all concerned. They\r\ndid not ask that the Indians be given farms, or that they should be made\r\nrich; merely that they be given small allotments of land, where they\r\nwould be secure. The California Indians have always been\r\nself-sustaining. That is, they have received no aid from the Government\r\nor from anyone else. They have often been below the starvation line and\r\nusually not far above it, but such as their living was, it was their\r\nown. Most of the California Indians have in some measure adjusted\r\nthemselves to the industrial life about them and perform whatever labor\r\nthey can get. The Indian Association planned not to interfere in any\r\nmanner with their independence, or with their industrial position. Above\r\nall things they did not wish the Indians pauperized. Also, the Indian\r\nAssociation did not wish the Indians concentrated. Where too many\r\nIndians are concentrated in one place, there is not sufficient work and\r\nthe Indians themselves have their own reasons for remaining within their\r\nancestral districts, which we may call superstitious or sentimental. The\r\nold racial antagonism between the antagonistic racial stocks also\r\nrenders it inadvisable to concentrate. The Indian Association therefore\r\nproposed that in places where no land for allotment could be secured\r\nfrom the public domain, small tracts should be purchased, in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of the Indians, where they have friends and\r\nemployers.[68]\r\n\r\nThe Indian Association then, 1904, began a vigorous campaign in\r\nCalifornia, largely educational, for the purpose of securing from\r\nCongress the land necessary as a basis for further work on behalf of the\r\nCalifornia Indians. In this effort nearly all of the societies working\r\nfor the benefit of Indians joined. In Southern California matters had\r\nbeen nearing a crisis, with the Indians there, owing to lack of water on\r\nmost reservations, indefinite boundaries, etc., and they were also\r\nasking for relief. The Sequoya League, of which Charles F. Lummis, Esq.,\r\nwas the leading spirit, was the most active body in Southern California.\r\nIn 1905 Congress directed an investigation of the whole Indian situation\r\nin California, and C. E. Kelsey, General Secretary of the Northern\r\nCalifornia Indian Association, was selected to make the investigation.\r\nThe report of this investigation was published by the Indian Office\r\nMarch 21, 1906. Congress soon made an appropriation of $100,000 for the\r\nrelief of the California Indians and $50,000 was further appropriated\r\ntwo years later. Some further sums were also given for fencing,\r\nsurveying and other such items. The plan presented by the Indian\r\nAssociation met favor with the Board of Indian Commissioners and the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs and was adopted almost _in toto_. Mr.\r\nKelsey was appointed to have charge of purchasing and allotting such\r\nlands as were required and served until the appropriations were\r\nexhausted. The need for water upon the Southern California reservations\r\nwas met chiefly from direct appropriations for the Irrigation Service\r\nand a large share of this work is already completed. The vexing boundary\r\nquestions in Southern California have all been settled and some\r\nconsiderable additions made to the reservations from the public domain\r\nand from purchase. In Northern California the work of getting all\r\nIndians on their own small fraction of land is not quite so far along,\r\nbut is nearing completion. When, in 1903, the Northern California Indian\r\nAssociation began its movement to secure land for the landless Indians\r\nof California, the land situation of the California Indians was\r\nestimated about as follows:\r\n\r\n  On reservations, So. Calif.                                    3,500\r\n  On reservations, No. Calif.                                    1,700\r\n  On allotments, So. Calif.                                        250\r\n  On allotments, No. Calif.                                      2,800\r\n  On land owned by churches, societies, etc., and by themselves  1,100\r\n  Estimated to be landless                                       8,000\r\n                                                                ——————\r\n                                                                17,350\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that about 2,000 could be given homes from the public\r\ndomain. The above estimates proved inadequate in some respects. There\r\nwere some 2,000 more Indians in the State than had been estimated and\r\nfewer Indians had land of their own than was supposed. Still as it\r\nproved possible to take care of 4,200 from the public domain and within\r\nthe National Forests, the number from whom land must be purchased was\r\nnot increased.\r\n\r\nCongress has recently appropriated $10,000 more for the purchase of land\r\nfor these Indians, but this will not be enough to take care of one-half\r\nof those remaining. When this appropriation shall have been used, nearly\r\n10,000 of the California Indians will have been given homes. The others\r\nshould be provided for immediately. It should be understood that all\r\nthis has been done without the establishment of reservations or agencies\r\nand with practically no expense for maintenance. In comparison with the\r\nmagnitude of the work, the expense has been small and it must be\r\nconceded that the debt which the Government owes the California Indians\r\nis by no means extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe present land situation (1914) in California is about as follows:\r\n\r\n           On reservations, No. Calif.                 1,944\r\n           On reservations, So. Calif.                 3,416\r\n           On allotments, No. Calif. (Old)             2,800\r\n           On allotments, So. Calif. (Old)               250\r\n           On allotments, No. Calif. (New)               400\r\n           On allotments, So. Calif. (New)               238\r\n           On National Forests                         3,000\r\n           On newly purchased lands                    4,800\r\n           Allotments arranged for                       600\r\n           On land owned by Indians                      300\r\n           On land owned by churches, societies, etc.    250\r\n           Not yet taken care of                       1,841\r\n                                                      ——————\r\n                                                      19,839\r\n\r\nThe awakening in regard to the California Indians was by no means\r\nconfined to land. The Indian Association has been working upon public\r\nsentiment from the first. After the land purchases were under way, the\r\nAssociation began efforts to secure schools and school privileges and to\r\nurge religious and other organizations to take up various phases of\r\nIndian work. The Indian Office established some eight day schools and\r\nincreased the capacity of others. Also an increased number of field\r\nmatrons were appointed. In 1904 it was estimated that only 1000 Indian\r\nchildren of school age in Northern California were in any kind of a\r\nschool, out of 2800. By 1914 it is estimated that less than 1000 were\r\nnot in school. The increase in school attendance is largely in the\r\npublic schools of the State. Racial prejudice against Indians in\r\nCalifornia in the earlier days was intense and the idea of allowing an\r\nIndian child in school was considered preposterous. As the Indians\r\ndecreased in numbers all fear of them passed away, and in time a\r\nkindlier feeling arose. For many years this racial prejudice prevented\r\nthe greater number of Indians from getting an adequate amount of work.\r\nWith increased population and the increased development of California\r\ncame an increased demand for labor with a diminished prejudice against\r\nIndians. The industrial position of the Indians has therefore improved.\r\nIn some parts of the State the Indians are fairly well employed at fair\r\npay. In others there is little work for anyone and in these portions of\r\nthe State Indians have to go many miles for a little work. They cut\r\nwood, put up hay, cultivate and pick hops, pick grapes and other fruit\r\nand do all kinds of odd jobs. As their employment is still largely\r\nseasonal, it is not wholly satisfactory. One excellent thing about the\r\nmore recent revival of interest in the California Indians is that it is\r\nlargely in California itself.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 there were five Protestant missions to the Indians of Northern\r\nCalifornia and two or three Roman Catholic missions. By 1914 the\r\nProtestant missions have increased to seventeen, with twenty\r\nmissionaries. The Catholic work has also been extended. There are now\r\nmissionaries in the field for about 14,000 of the California Indians and\r\nquite a number of local churches have interested themselves in the\r\nIndians in their own neighborhoods. The number of converts probably does\r\nnot exceed 4,000.\r\n\r\nIn California a considerable number of Indians, some 3,600, were found\r\nliving within the National Forests, of whom some 600 had allotments made\r\nbefore the forests were established. Further legislation was necessary\r\nbefore the 3,000 could be given their own homes. This was accomplished\r\nin 1910. (36 Stat. L. 855)\r\n\r\nThe California Indian, often termed “Digger”, has been considerably\r\nmaligned. Statements are not wanting that the California Indians were of\r\ndeficient mentality, little above the brutes and about the lowest of all\r\nhuman beings. Such statements are entitled to no credence. Kroeber,\r\nBarrett, Goddard, Merriam, Powers, Lummis, and all writers having actual\r\nacquaintance with the California Indians, place them as equal to any of\r\nthe other American tribes. Teachers in the California Indian schools say\r\nthat the California Indian children are as intelligent and capable as\r\nany Indians they have ever taught. Nearly one thousand Indian children\r\nare in the public schools of California and their scholarship is in no\r\nwise inferior to that of the white children of the same age, though it\r\nmust be admitted that few Indian children attend after adolescence. A\r\nfew of those in better financial circumstances have graduated from high\r\nschools with honors. Employers of Indian labor, without exception,\r\npronounce them honest, reliable and capable. They can be trusted to work\r\nalone, which cannot be done with Oriental labor or floating Whites.\r\nConviction of an Indian for theft is almost unheard of. Statistics\r\ngathered in 1909 showed twenty-eight Indians in the prisons of\r\nCalifornia for crimes of violence, mostly committed when under the\r\ninfluence of liquor, and not one Indian for theft or robbery or crimes\r\nagainst property. This is remarkable when we consider the straits under\r\nwhich the Indians are often placed.\r\n\r\nPresent conditions look favorable for the California Indians. In\r\nSouthern California the most harassing troubles have been settled, and\r\nwater is being supplied wherever possible. Southern California is\r\nover-schooled. The Government schools have a capacity for about 1200\r\npupils and there are about 800 Indian children of school age in that\r\ndistrict. In Northern California seven-eighths of the Indians have been\r\nsupplied with minute amounts of land. The California white people seem\r\naroused to the need for other forms of assistance and it seems unlikely\r\nthat matters will ever revert to former conditions. The new\r\nappropriation will take care of a part of the Indians still homeless.\r\nMore has been accomplished in this “spurt” than all others put together.\r\nThis may be attributed to the fact that the external influences lasted\r\nlonger. That is, an outsider from the Indian Association was in charge\r\nof the work for some eight years. The last one hundred years tend to\r\nshow that the Indian Office has not within itself the power to initiate\r\nany movement for the relief of Indians. The spirit that compels redress\r\nhas not resided in the Indian Office. The Indian Office has received at\r\nall times sufficient reports from the field and may be presumed to have\r\nhad knowledge of conditions at all times and yet every movement for\r\nrelief has come from the outside, from individuals, or more often from\r\nassociations who have compelled an unwilling bureau to act, or, often an\r\nunwilling Congress to act. This is doubtless always the case with\r\nbureaucracy. I am inclined to think this results largely from the manner\r\nof organization. As it is, the authority to decide questions lies with\r\npersons who seldom or never see the field and are without personal\r\nknowledge of that they are doing. The men who know the field have no\r\npower and the men who have the power do not know the field.\r\n\r\nBureaucracy has one curious result and I am inclined to think more so in\r\nthe Indian Service than in others. The employees seem to lose all power\r\nof initiative and all sense of individuality. They soon learn to resent\r\nany but routine work. This is probably why the reports of conditions in\r\nCalifornia and elsewhere have fallen into deaf pigeonholes.\r\n\r\n  My Brother’s Keeper.—_Charles F. Lummis_, 1899.

In one case the reservation patented\r\n  was six miles away from the land selected for the Indians in an\r\n  entirely different township. In most cases the boundaries were not\r\n  marked at all and the adjoining owners moved the lines over onto the\r\n  Indians.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  When Kelsey took charge he found on no reservation was there an\r\n  adequate supply of water for irrigation and on most of them none at\r\n  all.

On no\r\n  reservation was there any attempt made to protect the water supply,\r\n  and land which controlled the water was carefully left out of the\r\n  reservations in most cases. I think the surveyors must have done so\r\n  knowingly. This meant fifteen or twenty years’ slow starvation for the\r\n  Indians, and greatly increased difficulties later when we tried to\r\n  correct things. I presume I have spent one-third of my time during the\r\n  last ten years in fighting for things for the Southern California\r\n  Indians, which ought to have been settled twenty years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XXXII. A STATISTICAL TABLE. PREPARED BY MEN AND WOMEN IN THE\r\n                                 FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe past forty years we have had statistics on Indian advancement in the\r\nSecretary of the Interior and Indian Office reports. Until late years,\r\nthese were not detailed, but presented in condensed form the opinions of\r\nAgents, Superintendents and employees.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the United States Board of Indian Commissioners published a\r\ntable containing answers to twenty-six questions. The information is\r\nvaluable and was of service to the Government in handling Indian\r\nproblems. I do not reproduce the table here for the reason that\r\nexcellent though it was, it omits protection of property, and vital\r\nstatistics. Under my chapter devoted to health I have discussed, in a\r\ngeneral way, the health of the Indians, but have not presented tables\r\nfor the reason that I do not wish this book to become too statistical in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nFeeling that none of the statistical and other reports submitted by\r\nSuperintendents, Special Agents, Inspectors—or even the Honorable\r\nCommissioner himself—emphasized the phase of the situation which in my\r\neyes seemed the most important, I have prepared a table of my own.\r\n\r\nTwo general questions might be asked every man and woman in the Indian\r\nService, every educated Indian, and every person living in, or near,\r\nIndian communities. These are:\r\n\r\n_First._ “Is the Indian citizen treated as the white citizen, or is he\r\ndiscriminated against?”\r\n\r\n_Second._ “Has his moral, physical, financial and general well being\r\nincreased or diminished, the past twenty years?”\r\n\r\nOn these two very pertinent and important questions hang the entire\r\nfuture of the American Red Race.\r\n\r\nAfter some thought, I decided to obtain opinions from those who knew at\r\nfirst hand how our wards were progressing. The information I desired\r\nmust cover all of the United States, where Indians now live. Naturally,\r\nit was confined to the region west of the Mississippi, with the\r\nexception of tracts in Wisconsin and Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe excellent table prepared by Commissioner Sells in his report of 1913\r\nis based upon statistics sent in by Superintendents, teachers and\r\nphysicians. Of necessity, it could not include statements or opinions of\r\nmissionaries and other observers. It presents the views of employees in\r\nthe Department.\r\n\r\nAfter deliberation, a series of fourteen questions were prepared and\r\naddressed to upward of 300 men and women representing every reservation,\r\nIndian community, or school. Nearly half of these replied, and on pages\r\n345 to 358 I have presented their comments grouped under these various\r\nquestions. I have tried to make the questions sufficiently elastic to\r\ncover every phase of the subject. Specific requests applied to one\r\nsection of the country, might be out of place in another. For instance,\r\na series of questions concerning the Navaho, might not be answered\r\nintelligently if applied to the Ojibwa of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn studying the table of statistics, one observes that the answers\r\nindicate a wide difference of opinion. This is quite natural. As an\r\nillustration; at Pine Ridge, Major Brennan—a competent Superintendent,\r\nwho has been in charge of the fighting Sioux for many years—thinks that\r\nthere is less sickness and more progress than formerly; whereas a\r\nprominent missionary takes the opposite view. Another missionary offers\r\na compromise as between Major Brennan’s view, and the opinion of his\r\nworthy co-laborer. This difference does not reflect on the report of\r\nMajor Brennan, but is an honest difference of opinion. Missionaries and\r\ntheir assistants go about among the Indians of a certain part of the\r\nreservation more than does the Agent, who is engrossed in many official\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the answers are lengthy, and extremely interesting. Were it\r\npossible, all of them should be reproduced in this chapter.\r\n\r\nA number of answers were received promptly, others have come to hand a\r\nfew at a time, the past four months. Others are still arriving. It must\r\nbe remembered that these people are all earnest workers, whether\r\nemployed by the Government or benevolent organizations—hence the delays.\r\nBeyond question, many will reach me too late to be included in the\r\ntable. There is also a class of excessively timid persons, who seem to\r\nthink that to answer the questions, may involve them in controversy, or\r\ncast reflection on the Interior Department. It is quite surprising that\r\nso many correspondents should take this view.\r\n\r\nThe differences of opinion in nowise affect the table as a whole. On a\r\nlarge reservation, the Indians in one section may be rather backward.\r\nFor instance, there will be more sickness at Pine Point, White Earth\r\nreservation, than about White Earth agency. Hence, the priest at Pine\r\nPoint would report a worse condition among his Indians than the Agent at\r\nWhite Earth. In the great Indian area of eastern Oklahoma, near the\r\nschools conditions are satisfactory, whereas back in the hills, there is\r\nmuch suffering and distress. Also in Oklahoma, near the towns will live\r\nIndians who drink and gamble. Therefore, if such facts are taken into\r\nconsideration, many of the apparent discrepancies in my table will be\r\nreadily understood by readers. Upwards of a hundred of my correspondents\r\nhave been very frank, and many of their recommendations and suggestions\r\nare purposely omitted for the reason that to incorporate them would seem\r\nlike criticizing the present administration. This is not my purpose, as\r\nhas been frequently pointed out in this book. All I desire to do is to\r\npresent facts, and include sensible remedies suggested by correspondents\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  From “_Indian Blankets and Their Makers_”\r\n  by George Wharton James.\r\n  A. C. McClurg & Co., Publishers.\r\n\r\n  OLD BAYETA SADDLE BLANKET\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf we average up the entire table and allow for the progress in the\r\nsections wherein are located schools; where Superintendents, through\r\nefficient farmers and teachers, have brought about advance of Indians,\r\nwe will find that in many parts of the country there is a distinct\r\nadvance. In other portions of the United States the natives are either\r\nat a standstill, or have retrograded. The best showing is in the Navaho\r\ncountry, where good work has been done by all the Superintendents and\r\nmissionaries, by Rev. Johnson, and by the Agent at Shiprock, Mr. W. T.\r\nShelton—where now the desert blossoms like the rose. The general policy\r\nas carried out by Major Peter Parquette, Superintendent of the Navaho,\r\nand his able assistants, has been to let them alone and permit them to\r\nwork out their own salvation under a slight supervision. As the Navaho\r\nare today the largest body of Indians speaking the same language, and\r\nchiefly full-bloods, in this country, the Navaho statistics are\r\nsufficiently strong in the point of progress to appreciably raise the\r\nentire tone of Indians in the United States. This should be a lesson not\r\nlost on our Congress. While this is true and other communities, such as\r\nTulalip Agency, Washington, show a marked gain, the general tone of\r\nIndian communities as to advance in the arts, health, etc., is not\r\nsatisfactory. The table clearly indicates this. We must take into\r\naccount two important factors in studying the reports of my\r\ncorrespondents. First, the Superintendents, very naturally, wish to\r\npresent their wards in as creditable a manner as possible. They do not\r\nexaggerate, for they are all honest and competent observers. But they\r\nrather minimize the sad side of the story. The teachers, missionaries,\r\npriests, and the doctors rather lean toward a pessimistic view of\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn our final analysis we find that a majority of the correspondents\r\nrealize the difficulties under which the Indians labor, being\r\ndiscriminated against in their respective communities. That is, that\r\nalthough we claim citizenship for the Indians, all the facts point to\r\nthe conclusion that the citizenship is not effective. While we claim to\r\ncare for the health of the Indians, we have an insufficient number of\r\ndoctors and hospitals. While we build many irrigation plants, prepare\r\nmodel farms, etc., we do not provide the Indians with sufficient seed,\r\nstock, implements, wagons, etc., whereby they may become\r\nself-supporting. Most important of all, where we have given the Indians\r\ndeeds to their property, the majority of them lose the property. It is\r\nnot pertinent in the table of statistics to enter into the question\r\nwhether the Indian or the white man is at fault in this respect. The\r\nbald facts are to the effect that Indians lose their property.\r\n\r\nThe statistics indicate that education is advancing, and allotting of\r\nlands has far advanced. In education alone, the Indians certainly have\r\nadvanced to a marked degree. Practically all Indians under fifty (save\r\nthose referred to on page 27) have had some schooling.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons the names of the correspondents are omitted,\r\nalthough their original communications are preserved in my files. In\r\nvarious chapters throughout the book, I have incorporated partial or\r\ncomplete statements from these same correspondents. In the table, the\r\nanswers to the questions have been presented in a few words. Many of the\r\nsentences are actual quotations, but others present in condensed form\r\nthe opinions of the writers. Many correspondents have devoted an entire\r\npage to answering one question. Frequently, after answering the\r\nquestions, the correspondent has written several pages in order to\r\npresent his views concerning the Indian problem. Others have selected\r\nsuch questions as appeared to them to be of primary importance, and have\r\nanswered these at considerable length. A majority of the correspondents\r\nrealize that the protection of the Indian’s property, the safeguarding\r\nof his health, and the relation between the two races constitute the\r\nessentials of the Indian problem, and that all other considerations are\r\nsecondary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TABLE OF STATISTICS\r\n\r\n ═════════════════╤═════════════════╤═════════════════╤═════════════════\r\n Correspondent    │Is there more    │Are children     │Have many\r\n                  │tuberculosis and │discharged from  │children the past\r\n                  │trachoma among   │the schools      │ten years, been\r\n                  │your Indians now │because of       │dismissed from\r\n                  │than ten years   │diseases,        │the schools?\r\n                  │ago?             │properly treated │\r\n                  │                 │at home?         │\r\n                  │                 │                 │\r\n                  │                 │                 │\r\n                  │                 │                 │\r\n                  │                 │                 │\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n      ALASKA      │                 │                 │\r\n                  │                 │                 │\r\n No. 1.

FARMING AND STOCK-RAISING INDIAN FAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissioner Sells has made the “gospel of work” the chief aim of his\r\nadministration. That is, he has emphasized and encouraged farming and\r\nstock-raising. Before quoting from the Commissioner’s reports and\r\ncirculars on this subject, it should not be taken amiss if the statement\r\nis made that during the administrations of Commissioners Morgan and\r\nJones, this important feature of Indian education was not sufficiently\r\nemphasized. Many of the central, northern and mountain Indians took\r\nnaturally to stock-raising. With the care of the horse, they were\r\nfamiliar. It was but a step from horse-raising to cattle-raising, as has\r\nbeen illustrated in the case of the Sioux (page 309). Truly, a number of\r\ntribes possessed more cattle a generation ago than at the present time.\r\n\r\nFrom information received, I take it that under the administrations of\r\nMessrs. Leupp and Valentine, a serious effort was made to encourage\r\nfarming and stock-raising, on a larger scale. While this new movement\r\nmay have been inaugurated by either Mr. Leupp or Mr. Valentine, when Mr.\r\nAbbott became acting Commissioner, he encouraged and expanded efforts in\r\nthis direction. Orders were issued to Superintendents, giving greater\r\ndiscretion in supervising individual Indian moneys; the leasing policy\r\nwas simplified and self-supporting Indians permitted to lease their\r\nsurplus lands and to a greater extent handle their own funds; a higher\r\nstandard with larger salary was established for the Indian Service\r\nfarmer, who was expected to do house to house work among the Indians\r\nunder his supervision, giving practical advice and securing definite\r\nresults in the way of increased production from Indian land; active\r\ncooperation between the Bureaus of Plant and Animal Industry of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture was promoted; the Civil Service Commission\r\nprovided tests for farmers intended to secure men with more experience\r\nand practical equipment, and the United States was divided into four\r\nCivil Service districts in order that eligible farmers might be secured\r\nfor that part of the Indian country where their farming experience had\r\nbeen obtained. The possibilities of the working out of this policy in\r\nall its phases was demonstrated particularly on the Winnebago\r\nreservation in Nebraska, where in three years while Albert H. Kneale was\r\nSuperintendent, this tribe of Indians was practically transformed into\r\none of the most sober and industrious groups of Indians to be found on\r\nany allotted Indian reservation in the United States. From 3000 acres of\r\nIndian-farmed land, in the first year, under the new program, which gave\r\nthe Superintendent freedom to act without discouraging delays in\r\nWashington, there were 12,000 acres farmed by Indians at the end of\r\nthree years, and so many of the Indians had moved to their allotments\r\nthat the Dutch Reformed Church had to build a new church and locate an\r\nadditional missionary out in the heart of the reservation in order to\r\nreach its Indian adherents.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Mr. Sells, as has been stated, the Department\r\nrealized that if the Indian is to be saved, much more should be done\r\nthan the mere issuance of instructions to Superintendents. Assistant\r\nCommissioner, Edgar B. Meritt has, the past few years, been very active\r\nin advocating reimbursable appropriations for Indians in order that they\r\nmight purchase live stock and farming implements to improve their large\r\nareas of agricultural lands.\r\n\r\nMr. Sells’ official instructions, under date of September 2, 1914, to\r\nall Superintendents are as follows:—\r\n\r\n“I am not satisfied that we are making the greatest use of our school\r\nfarms. They usually consist of large tracts of fertile land capable of\r\nraising every crop that the climate in which the school is located will\r\npermit. In some cases these farms are well irrigated.\r\n\r\n“In every case the schools have been or can be furnished with all the\r\nequipment necessary to till their farms to the fullest extent, and they\r\ncan be furnished with stock with which to make a substantial showing in\r\nstock-raising.\r\n\r\n“The agricultural training of the boy pupils in our schools furnishes\r\nample opportunity for intensive farming. If this training is to be of\r\nreal value and be effective in accomplishing its purpose, the farming\r\noperations should be financially successful and at the same time\r\nconducted in accordance with modern methods.\r\n\r\n“I am convinced that there is a large field for improvement in the\r\nhandling of these farms, and I want every field officer who has charge\r\nof such a farm to see that its management is of such a nature as will\r\ninsure its development to the highest degree of productiveness,\r\npractical usefulness and object lesson.\r\n\r\n“The constantly increasing demands on the various appropriations for the\r\nIndian Service make it necessary not only to exercise the most careful\r\neconomy consistent with the end sought, but at the same time to see that\r\nevery resource in connection with Indian education and industry is\r\ndeveloped to the highest obtainable degree.\r\n\r\n“See that employees in charge of your farms are men capable of rendering\r\nproper and efficient service, carefully determine the suitable crops for\r\nthe particular soil of the tillable land of your farm, giving the best\r\nattention to the raising and use of these crops.\r\n\r\n“Our farms should grow corn, oats, wheat, and raise alfalfa, clover,\r\ntimothy, etc. You should raise all the potatoes and other vegetables\r\nconsumed. We should not be satisfied with raising feed for the school\r\nlivestock, but we should raise everything the farm, garden and orchard\r\nwill produce.\r\n\r\n“I want you to raise livestock to the fullest of your capacity; raise\r\ncolts from the school mares; let your calves grow into beef for your\r\nschool. Grow a good herd of hogs to follow the cattle that you feed and\r\nuse the waste from the table at the school. Make your dairy amply large\r\nand of such kind that there will be plenty of milk, cream and butter.\r\nFeed the skim-milk to the hogs and grow your pork meat. Where\r\npracticable cure your own bacon and ham, make your own sausage and dry\r\nand corn your own beef.”\r\n\r\nThere is more, but this will indicate the earnest effort of the\r\nCommissioner to improve conditions.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Indian fairs have become very popular, and are held on\r\nmost reservations, or at schools. The old “Wild West” feature has been\r\neliminated. At Red Lake, Minn., September 19th, 1914, the Ojibwa fair\r\nwas attended by 2000 persons. The published account in the _New York\r\nWorld_ stated:—\r\n\r\n“Exhibits of grain grown by the Indians included specimens of oats,\r\nbarley and wheat that would average twenty-five bushels to the acre, and\r\nyellow dent corn fully matured.\r\n\r\n“What was perhaps next in importance was the stock display, which\r\nincluded blooded animals, the registered Holstein and Durham cattle\r\nbeing most numerous. The judging of the stock was done by Supt. C. G.\r\nSelvig, of the Crookston School.\r\n\r\n“There was also a fine display of vegetables and fruit, all of which\r\nwere raised by the Indians. The exhibits included cantaloupes and\r\nsugar-sweet watermelons. There were also crab apples and displays of\r\nother apples and fruits.\r\n\r\n“The women and girls had exhibits of bread, pies, cakes, jellies,\r\npreserves, pickles, and other dainties. But probably the most artistic\r\nand beautiful display ever seen at a county fair was found in the\r\ndisplay of beaded work. These exhibits not only were done neatly, but\r\nthe beaded designs and colorings were gorgeous. The exhibit included\r\namong other things head dress, sacques, moccasins, dresses, belts, hat\r\nbands, banners, buckskin leggings, and jackets. All were new, having\r\nbeen made by the Chippewas the past year for display at the fair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEUPP HALL—STUDENTS’ DINING ROOM\r\n\r\n  Domestic Science, Bakery, Domestic Art, etc., Chilocco Indian School,\r\n    Oklahoma.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“There was no disorder nor intoxication.”\r\n\r\nCommissioner Sells seized upon the fair proposition as a means of\r\nextending industry. A portion of his sensible address to Superintendents\r\nis:—\r\n\r\n“You should now be arranging for your Indian fair, and I desire to\r\nimpress upon you my idea of the purpose and possibilities of these\r\nexhibitions.\r\n\r\n“I want these fairs so conducted as to open to the Indians the vision of\r\nthe industrial achievements to which they should aspire. I want them to\r\nbe an inspiration in arousing in the Indian a clear appreciation of the\r\ngreat opportunity before him for real industrial advancement.\r\n\r\n“The ownership of land always has been and always must be the principal\r\nbasis of man’s wealth. A wise development of the vast natural resources\r\nof the Indian reservations has tremendous possibilities. The Indian’s\r\nrich agricultural lands, his vast areas of grass land, his great forests\r\nand his practically untouched mineral resources should be so utilized as\r\nto become a powerful instrument for his civilization.\r\n\r\n“I hold it to be an economic and social crime, in this age and under\r\nmodern conditions, to permit thousands of acres of fertile lands\r\nbelonging to the Indians and capable of great industrial development to\r\nlie in unproductive idleness.\r\n\r\n“With keen appreciation of these conditions Congress in the current\r\nappropriation bill has made available for the Indians over $600,000 as a\r\nreimbursable fund, and $250,000 additional for general and specific\r\nindustrial use, all for the purchase of stock and farm equipment, as\r\nwell as about $800,000 of the funds of the Confederated Bands of Utes\r\nfor the civilization and support of those Indians.\r\n\r\n“I feel that a serious obligation rests upon me and upon every employee\r\nof the Indian Service to see that no effort is spared to make the most\r\nof the great opportunity which the Indian’s property and the action of\r\nCongress now presents to the Indian. It is my duty to require that every\r\nsupervising officer, every Superintendent, every farmer, every stockman,\r\nand in fact every employee of the Indian Service meets this obligation\r\nin full measure.\r\n\r\n“The political conditions of the world will make the next few years a\r\nperiod of great prosperity for the American farmer. Let us see that the\r\nIndian with his broad acres is in truth an American farmer and that he\r\nproperly participates in this unusual opportunity.\r\n\r\n“I desire that our Indian fairs this year be made the opening of an\r\nintelligent and determined campaign for the industrial advancement of\r\nthe Indian. Let this year’s fair mark the start of the Indian along the\r\nroad, the purpose of which is self-support and independence—hereafter\r\nlet your fair each year be a milestone fixing the stages of the Indian’s\r\nprogress toward that goal.\r\n\r\n“It is the primary duty of all Superintendents to understand the Indians\r\nunder their charge, to study the resources of the reservation for which\r\nthey are responsible, its climate, the character of its land, the type\r\nof cattle owned by the Indians, their horses, their sheep and their\r\nother stock.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIANS RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN PLUMBING. HASKELL INSTITUTE, KANSAS\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Former widespread negligence and mismanagement in the cultivation of\r\nthe soil, the breeding of stock, and the handling of grazing land is no\r\nexcuse for the continuance of such conditions, and they will not be\r\npermitted to exist on an Indian reservation during my administration.\r\n\r\n“Be continually at the fair yourself with your farmers and all of your\r\nindustrial employees.\r\n\r\n“Let the exhibits emphasize in an impressive manner the difference\r\nbetween inferior and high-grade agricultural products, and let them\r\ndemonstrate in no uncertain way that greater profit results from raising\r\nthe best and the most of everything produced on the farm or ranch.\r\nEncourage the Indian to take the progressive view. This should not be\r\ndifficult where he has before him a clear object lesson such as is\r\nemphasized by placing his horses, cattle and sheep, his corn, oats,\r\nwheat, alfalfa and forage on exhibition in legitimate rivalry with those\r\nof his neighbor at the Indian fair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NAVAHO SUMMER HOGAN\r\n\r\n  From G. W. James’ “Indian Blankets and their Makers”\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The improvement of stock should be aggressively advocated and impressed\r\nupon the mind of every Indian farmer and stock-raiser. He should be\r\nbrought to understand that the thousands of well-bred bulls, stallions\r\nand rams were purchased during the last few months to do away with the\r\nevils of lack of sufficient and well-bred male stock and the inbreeding\r\nalmost universal in the past. He should understand that in order to\r\nsecure the best results the male stock must not only be improved but\r\nthat the old and worse than useless male animals which have heretofore\r\nbeen so destructive to the Indian’s success as a stock-raiser must be\r\ndisposed of.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Carlisle school farms this summer were quite prosperous, as were\r\nfarms at all the educational centers. _The Carlisle Arrow_ of September\r\n4th, says:—\r\n\r\n                             THE FIRST FARM\r\n\r\n  “The forty-eight cows and the six head of young cattle are in fine\r\n  condition, as are also 70 hogs, averaging 125 pounds; 30 shoats,\r\n  averaging 30 pounds; 22 small pigs, and 12 brood sows.\r\n\r\n  “The average amount of milk produced during the summer months was\r\n  eighty gallons a day, and butter, eighty pounds a week.\r\n\r\n  “There is material for hundreds of tons of ensilage.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            THE SECOND FARM\r\n\r\n  “The wheat and oats were unusually good and the yield was abundant.\r\n  There are thirty acres of fine potatoes. The large flocks of turkeys\r\n  and chickens are thriving. The number of eggs gathered have kept the\r\n  hospital well supplied throughout the summer.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “The school garden crop exceeds, in quantity of production, any on\r\n  record. The farms also have yielded abundantly, making this a\r\n  record-breaking year for Carlisle in the fruition of agricultural\r\n  products.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Indian fairs, now so popular on many reservations, will play no\r\nsmall part in solving the Indian problem. It does not matter which one\r\nof the Commissioners inaugurated this most excellent incentive to work\r\nand progress. Whoever was responsible for it, hit upon a most happy\r\nexpedient. Manifestly, the Indians should be encouraged to continue\r\nthese fairs and to engage in honest competition. Everyone will heartily\r\napprove of the scheme to abandon, or curtail, the “Wild West” feature—of\r\nwhich we have had entirely too much the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Indian farms, formerly under cultivation, had grown up\r\nto bushes in Minnesota and Oklahoma. If the plans of the Indian Office,\r\nas outlined above, are carried to a successful termination, most of\r\nthese tracts will again come under cultivation. The Indian will feel\r\nencouraged to labor, especially so since the fruits of his toil will\r\naccrue to him rather than to the white man. The reimbursable\r\nappropriations and the encouragement of industry are two of the most\r\nhopeful signs of Indian progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CHAPTER XXXIV. FOUR IMPORTANT BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I write this page there lie before me four important Indian books,\r\nand I would that every reader possessed them in his library, for the\r\nvery good reason that all of them treat of the Indian of today. Two of\r\nthem are strictly historical, and the other two sufficiently accurate to\r\nbe included in that category.\r\n\r\nThese books are: Helen Hunt Jackson’s “Century of Dishonor,” published\r\nin 1886; Seth K. Humphrey’s “The Indian Dispossessed,” published in\r\n1906; Honorable Francis E. Leupp’s “The Indian and His Problem,”\r\npublished in 1910; and Honorable James McLaughlin’s “My Friend the\r\nIndian,” 1910.\r\n\r\nThe authors of these books are all familiar with the Indian problem and\r\nIndian conditions, but approach the subject from somewhat different\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\nHonorable F. E. Leupp was for years Commissioner of Indian Affairs.\r\nMajor McLaughlin has served in the Indian Service forty-two years, and\r\nwas on the frontier among the Sioux prior to that time. Helen Hunt\r\nJackson was a noble woman who became interested, first in the Mission\r\nIndians of California, and afterwards in all Indians of the United\r\nStates. She wrote her “Century of Dishonor” and lived to see its\r\ninfluence spread throughout the English-speaking world. A number of\r\neditions were published. S. K. Humphrey, Esq., a Bostonian, who has long\r\nbeen a staunch friend of Indians, presents in his book the legal point\r\nof view of the breaking of treaties and agreements, and the despoilation\r\nof the following tribes:—Mission Indians, Poncas, Nez Perces, Umatillas,\r\netc. Each of these authors treats of the modern Indian, and I desire to\r\ncall attention in my plea for him, to the testimony of these competent\r\nwitnesses—“Lest we forget.”\r\n\r\nMajor McLaughlin has been United States Indian Inspector during more\r\nyears than any other man in the inspection corps. He visited all the\r\nreservations in the United States, and he understands the Indian.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the early days on the Plains, he relates his personal\r\nexperiences, and gives sound advice in the handling of Indian affairs.\r\nFrom all I can gather from reading accounts of, or talking with\r\nfrontiersmen, who fought against Indians; officers of our troops in\r\nIndian wars; former Indian Agents; and after study of Government and\r\nMissionary reports, I think McLaughlin is correct when he says\r\nconcerning the Indians of forty years ago—\r\n\r\n“And they were a very different body of men, physically, from the\r\nIndians of today. They wore an air of sturdy independence. They were\r\nequipped according to their natural requirements. Their minds were\r\ngenerally attuned to magnificent ideas of time and distance. They\r\nabhorred the limitations that the white man accepts as affecting his\r\ndwelling-place. They were foes to be reckoned with, or they might be\r\nconverted into friends worth the having. It is a matter of profound\r\nregret that the Indian of that day could not have been advanced to his\r\npresent knowledge of, and capacity for, civilized pursuits without being\r\nsubjected to the debasing and degenerating physical and moral conditions\r\nthat were inseparable from the process of transmutation.”\r\n\r\nMajor McLaughlin is perfectly correct in his chapter “Give the Red Man\r\nHis Portion” when he states that the enormous sums of money, tribal and\r\nindividual, now held by the United States should be divided among them.\r\nOtherwise, the swarm of shyster lawyers, feasting on Indian claims, will\r\ncontinue to increase. Congress should act immediately and provide for\r\nthe division of this money, even though some of the Indians squander it.\r\nSo long as fully $48,848,744 remains in the United States Treasury, just\r\nso long will we have this continual fight with “claim attorneys”, and\r\nthe Indians will not work pending the distribution of this great wealth.\r\nThe Scriptural quotation which was somewhat changed by one of the\r\nspeakers at the Lake Mohonk Conference last year, expresses this view\r\nmost admirably—“Where the Indian money lies, there will the grafters be\r\ngathered together.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing Major McLaughlin is still a valued employee\r\nof the United States Indian Service. Undoubtedly he could have written a\r\ngreat deal stronger than he did. Reading between the lines of his book,\r\nI take it that the Major now realizes that the chief reason for the\r\nalmost utter failure of our Indian policy is because of lack of proper\r\nprotection of Indian property rights and health, and further, that the\r\ncitizenship we handed the Indian, and of which our orators in Congress\r\nand in benevolent organizations had so much to say, has proved a hollow\r\nmockery and a sham.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that Mr. Humphrey lays claim to legal training, but his\r\nbook presents in a masterly fashion, exactly what has been done to the\r\nIndians who have accepted the pledged word of our civilized country. It\r\nis not a sentimental book, but a carefully prepared narrative drawn from\r\nofficial documents, and should have had an effect on our Congress and\r\nInterior Department long ago.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of “The Indian and His Problem”, Mr. Leupp pays the\r\nIndian a merited tribute and sets forth his independence, his many\r\nvirtues and his character. He emphasizes a trait of the oldtime Indian\r\nnot generally understood—his honesty.\r\n\r\n“Old, experienced traders among the Indians have repeatedly informed me\r\nthat they had lost less money on long-standing Indian accounts,\r\naggregating large sums, than in their comparatively small dealings with\r\nthe white people in their neighborhoods. One successful trader among the\r\nSioux who, in the early nineties, lent some $30,000 to the Indians near\r\nhim in anticipation of a payment they were soon to receive, said\r\nafterward: ‘I did not lose more than $150 on the whole transaction, and\r\nthat I lost from a half-breed who did not live on the reservation.’ The\r\nsame testimony is borne on all sides, and the universal comment is that,\r\nuntil they were taught how to cheat in a trade, very few of them ever\r\nthought of doing so. I have seen Indians at a Government pay-table,\r\nafter receiving their annuities, walk up to the Agent or some employee\r\nwith so many dollars held out in their palms, to repay a loan which the\r\ncreditor had forgotten all about. These instances, I ought to add, were\r\nobserved among Indians of a pretty backward class, who were acting\r\nsimply in obedience to their natural impulses.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leupp states frankly in his preface:—\r\n\r\n“The Indian problem has now reached a stage where its solution is almost\r\nwholly a matter of administration.”\r\n\r\nBecause he served in various Indian capacities for almost twenty-five\r\nyears with organizations as well as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and\r\nas in that latter office it was his duty and privilege to regard the\r\nsubject in its broad aspect, an extended review of his book is entirely\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nUnder Chapter II, “What Happened to the Indian,” he discusses what we\r\nall know, the end of the “buffalo days”, and the beginning of the ration\r\nsystem. He maintains that this encouraged idleness. Along with the\r\nration and reservations systems sprang up the educational plan for the\r\nbenefit of Indians. At first there were few government schools, and many\r\ndenominational. The Government increased its appropriations to support\r\nthese sectarian schools until in 1870 it was $100,000, and later the\r\namounts were much larger. This brought about an unfortunate and\r\nunnecessary dispute between the denominations, the Protestant and the\r\nCatholic. Hard feelings were engendered, and instead of working together\r\nin amity to Christianize and educate the Indians, all these worthy\r\npeople were engaged in a dispute as to who should receive the most money\r\nfrom the United States Treasury! We may imagine the feelings and\r\nopinions of the brighter Indians as they viewed this unchristian and\r\nuncharitable dispute. The Government had to withdraw support from all\r\ndenominational schools and as a result many closed their doors while\r\nothers struggled along. Comparing the Government school system and the\r\ndenominational, Leupp says:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A FULL-BLOOD SIOUX GIRL, 1888\r\n]\r\n\r\n“In dimensions, in scholastic scope, and in material equipment, the\r\nGovernment school system as it stands today is an enormous advance on\r\nthe old mission school system; but in real accomplishment as\r\nproportioned to outlay it does not begin to equal the latter, and in\r\nvital energy it must always be lacking. The reason for these differences\r\nis not far to seek. At the base of everything lies the fact that, except\r\nin magnificence, no governmental enterprise can compare with the same\r\nthing in private hands. The Government’s methods are ponderous, as must\r\nalways be the movements of so gigantic a machine. Its expenditures are\r\nfrom money belonging to the public, and therefore demand a more\r\nelaborate arrangement of checks and balances and final accounting than\r\nexpenditures made from the funds of voluntary contributors. In spite of\r\nthe now universal application of civil service rules, the whole business\r\nis under political control in the sense that the appropriations and the\r\nlaws governing their use must be obtained from Congress, and that the\r\nschool system is only a branch of one of the executive departments. This\r\ncircumstance, while not necessitating the intrusion of partisan\r\nconsiderations into the settlement of any vexed question, does militate\r\nagainst the highest efficiency, because it requires that a great deal of\r\nground shall be traversed two, three or a dozen times on the way to a\r\nclearly visible conclusion, involves harassing delays and temporary\r\ndiscouragements, calls for tedious consultations over petty details\r\nwhich one mind could dispose of more satisfactorily, and keeps the\r\nadministrative staff always in a state of preparation to repel\r\ngratuitous interference.”\r\n\r\nOf the four books, the one that appeals to me most of all is that\r\nwritten by Helen Hunt Jackson. Bishop Whipple, long a friend of the\r\nIndian, wrote the preface to the edition of 1880. Page 7 is worthy of\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n“All this while Canada has had no Indian wars. Our Government has\r\nexpended for the Indians a hundred dollars to their one. They recognize,\r\nas we do, that the Indian has a possessory right to the soil. They\r\npurchase this right, as we do, by treaty; but their treaties are made\r\nwith _the Indian subjects_ of Her Majesty. They set apart a _permanent_\r\nreservation for them; they seldom remove Indians; they select Agents of\r\nhigh character, who receive their appointments for life; they make fewer\r\npromises, but they fulfil them; they give the Indians Christian\r\nmissions, which have the hearty support of Christian people, and all\r\ntheir efforts are toward self-help and civilization. An incident will\r\nillustrate the two systems. The officer of the United States Army who\r\nwas sent to receive Alaska from the Russian Government stopped in\r\nBritish Columbia. Governor Douglas had heard that an Indian had been\r\nmurdered by another Indian. He visited the Indian tribe; he explained to\r\nthem that the murdered man was a subject of Her Majesty; he demanded the\r\nculprit. The murderer was surrendered, was tried, was found guilty, and\r\nwas hanged. On reaching Alaska the officer happened to enter the Greek\r\nchurch, and saw on the altar a beautiful copy of the Gospels in a costly\r\nbinding studded with jewels. He called upon the Greek bishop, and said,\r\n‘Your Grace, I called to say you had better remove that copy of the\r\nGospels from the church, for it may be stolen.’ The bishop replied, ‘Why\r\nshould I remove it? It was the gift of the mother of the Emperor, and\r\nhas lain on the altar seventy years.’ The officer blushed, and said,\r\n‘There is no law in the Indian country, and I was afraid it might be\r\nstolen.’ The bishop said, ‘The book is in God’s house, and it is His\r\nbook, and I shall not take it away.’ The book remained. The country\r\nbecame ours, and the next day the Gospel was stolen.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Jackson takes up in detail the despoiling of the Indians even more\r\nthoroughly than Mr. Humphrey. She treats of the Delawares, Cheyennes,\r\nNez Perces, Sioux, Poncas, Winnebagoes, Cherokees, California Indians,\r\netc. She devotes a gruesome chapter to the massacre of Indians by white\r\npeople. She devotes an appendix of 171 pages (small type), to a\r\nnarration of outrages perpetrated by white people on Indians, broken\r\ntreaties, and outrageous treatment of Indians by Whites. The appendix\r\nincludes a spirited correspondence with Secretary of the Interior, Hon.\r\nCarl Schurz. There are also several letters to the _Rocky Mountain\r\nNews_, a Denver paper, edited by Mr. W. N. Byers. The letters were\r\nwritten in 1880. Schurz was Secretary, it should be remembered, when the\r\nfamous Ponca case occurred. A tribe of Indians had been forcibly taken\r\nfrom their homes. Through friends in Boston and Philadelphia, who had\r\ntheir case brought before the courts and were sustained in their\r\ncontentions, these Poncas were returned to their reservation. As to the\r\nByers correspondence, the citizens of Denver had attacked and killed a\r\nlarge number of Indian men, women and children located in a village on\r\nSand Creek, some distance from the mining camps. Mrs. Jackson clearly\r\nhas the better of both arguments.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the present condition of some of the Indian bands\r\ndoes not arouse the same interest as did the case of the Poncas. The\r\nChippewas of Minnesota suffered far greater wrongs than fell to the lot\r\nof the Poncas, and yet there has been no outburst of righteous\r\nindignation because of what happened to them.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, near Camp Grant, Arizona Territory, there were a number of\r\nApaches encamped under the jurisdiction of the United States authorities\r\nand these Indians did not wish to join Geronimo and others in their\r\nraids in the Southwest and Old Mexico. By the 11th of March, 1871, there\r\nwere over 300 Indians assembled near the camp. They had brought in, in a\r\nshort time, more than 300,000 pounds of hay which the officer in command\r\npurchased. In view of the hostility of Geronimo and his band, that the\r\nApaches should desire peace, and be willing to work, seemed\r\nincomprehensible in the Southwest. The frontier element—always hostile\r\nto Indians—resented their presence. The Indians continued to come in and\r\npresently there were 510 in the camp.\r\n\r\nThe 30th of April, these Indians were attacked by a large force of white\r\nmen from Tucson, Arizona. The gentleman who furnished Mrs. Jackson with\r\nthe information was C. B. Brierley, Acting Assistant Surgeon, United\r\nStates Army. Mrs. Jackson presents Surgeon Brierley’s report in detail.\r\nWe need not present particulars, save to say that a large number of the\r\nIndians were surprised and killed while in camp and that the white\r\npeople of Tucson, not satisfied with killing the men, mutilated the dead\r\nbodies of women and children.\r\n\r\nA Mr. J. H. Lyman of Northampton, Mass., was a pioneer in Arizona in\r\n1810 and 1841. He made a report to the Board of Indian Commissioners in\r\n1871 which explains the hostility in later years of the Apaches toward\r\nthe white people, as to how one Johnson agreed with the Governor of\r\nSenora to procure Indian scalps at an ounce of gold each. Johnson killed\r\nlarge numbers of women and children—and a few warriors. Mrs. Jackson\r\nreprints most of his report.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jackson’s book, as I have previously stated, created a profound\r\nimpression in this country and in England. None of the hundreds of facts\r\nand incidents contained in her “Century of Dishonor” were ever\r\nsuccessfully denied. Many of the recommendations offered by her are\r\nsound and could be applied with profit at the present time, although\r\nthirty years have elapsed since she laid down her pen.\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey may be said to have carried her work down to present times\r\n(1906), although there is much to our discredit since he wrote.\r\n\r\nAs to the irrigation problems, he says:—\r\n\r\n“Whether he were the defenseless beginner of the Northwest, or the\r\nskilful agriculturalist of the Southwest desert with ancient systems of\r\nirrigation, the Indian was never regarded as a man. The forceful settler\r\ndispossessed the irrigating Indian with even less than usual formality\r\nbecause his highly-cultivated lands were the more valuable,—either by\r\ndriving him into the desert and pre-empting his land, or by diverting\r\nhis water, thus making his land a desert. Typical of these Indians were\r\nthe four thousand Pimas of Arizona. They had practised agriculture by\r\nirrigation along the Gila River for more than three centuries. In the\r\nlanguage of the early records, ‘they are farmers and live wholly by\r\ntilling the soil, and in the earlier days of the American history of the\r\nterritory they were the chief support of both the civil and military\r\nelements of this section of the country.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SEMINOLE INDIAN HOUSES AND CYCLONE CELLAR. WEWOKA, OKLAHOMA, 1913\r\n]\r\n\r\n“In 1886 the Whites began to divert the waters of the Gila River. A suit\r\nin the federal court was talked of to maintain the clear rights of the\r\nIndians, but never pressed. No district attorney who would prosecute\r\nsuch a case against voting white men could expect to live politically.\r\nWithin seven years the Pimas were reduced from independence to the\r\nhumiliation of calling for rations, while the white settlers used the\r\nIndians water undisturbed.\r\n\r\n“‘Enough has been written about the need of water for the starving\r\nIndians to fill a volume,’ wrote the discouraged Agent, after ten years.\r\n‘It has been urgently presented to your honorable office time and again,\r\nand yet the need of water is just as great and the supply no greater.’\r\nSo the years went on. In 1900 came the cry from the desert, ‘This water,\r\ntheir one resource, their very life, has been taken from them, and they\r\nare, perforce, lapsing into indolence, misery, and vice.’ Thirty\r\nthousand dollars was appropriated for more rations.\r\n\r\n“Finally, after eighteen years, the suit to recover the Indians’ rights\r\nreceived its final quietus. The district attorney reported in 1904:\r\n‘There is no doubt but that the case could be taken up and prosecuted to\r\na favorable ending, but ... _it would be impossible for the court to\r\nenforce its decree_, and the expense of prosecuting such suit would cost\r\nbetween twenty and thirty thousand dollars.’\r\n\r\n“This Government long ago lost the right to say that it _could not_\r\nenforce a federal law against less than a thousand of its agricultural\r\ncitizens. Its officials _would not_ disturb the political balance of\r\nArizona.”\r\n\r\nAs to the opposing forces—the uplift, and its antithesis—he writes:—\r\n\r\n“But there is another side to this picture. During all these years of\r\ntrouble, the Indian was faithfully attended by a great Unselfishness,\r\nalways striving to re-establish him, to educate and enlighten him. The\r\nGovernment met with no opposition in administering this portion of its\r\ntrust, and the workers were granted its most generous and intelligent\r\nsupport; for the high ideals of the people have always been the\r\nGovernment’s inspiration, even though it be often led to action by a\r\nselfish few.\r\n\r\n“It is not within the scope of this book to recount the great good that\r\nhas come to the Indian through this branch of the Indian Service, save\r\nto make full acknowledgment here of its greatness. It has done much more\r\nthan attend the Indian’s education. Many a tribe, and many individual\r\nIndians have had saved to them tracts of _good land_, upon which they\r\nhave worked their way toward civilization. Indeed, had it not been for\r\nthe constant presence of these among the Indians who labored for their\r\ngood, little good land would have been left to any Indians.\r\n\r\n“These are the two great influences which have shaped the Indian’s\r\ndestiny; one, steadily hewing away the foundation—his land; the other,\r\nfaithfully moulding the superstructure—his education; both generously\r\nsupported by a vote-seeking Congress.\r\n\r\n“Where the first has failed, the Indian is coming into full citizenship\r\nthrough agriculture, education, and Christian teaching. Where both have\r\nsucceeded in their opposing efforts, we find the Indian figuratively,\r\nand often literally, on the rocks; educated, saved, and\r\nforlorn,—amiable, but aimless, in his arrested development. He has\r\nmissed the fundamental lesson of mankind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Humphrey’s conclusions may here be reproduced in part.\r\n\r\n“When we hear of dark injustice among the natives of Africa, or in\r\nRussia’s Siberian wastes, we turn in horror from the oppressed to vent\r\nindignation upon the oppressor. But when the tale of our own Poor Lot is\r\ntold, we lift our eyes to Heaven—not being so well able to see ourselves\r\nas to see others—and murmur, reverently, ‘’Tis the Survival of the\r\nFittest!’ Those who think lightly are wont to exclaim impatiently, that\r\nthe Indian’s story is a closed book. It is—nearly so; but the book of\r\nhistory is never closed except by those who think lightly. * * * * *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INDIANS’ COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT. HASKELL INSTITUTE\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Bishop Whipple of Minnesota, who gave the best part of his life to the\r\nIndian cause, declared, after recounting the acts of broken faith which\r\nled up to the great Sioux massacre of 1863, ‘I submit to every man the\r\nquestion whether the time has not come for a nation to hear the cry of\r\nwrong, if not for the sake of the heathen, for the sake of the memory of\r\nour friends whose bones are bleaching on our prairies.’ This bookful of\r\nwrongs, and volumes more, have been perpetrated since. * * * *\r\n\r\n“Col.

Dodge, after thirty-three years on the Plains as Indian\r\nfighter, displays in his ‘A Living Issue,’ this same confiding hope: ‘It\r\nis too much to expect any one of these (politicians) to risk the loss of\r\nvotes and thus jeopardize his future career for a miserable savage.\r\nPoliticians will do nothing unless forced to it by the great, brave,\r\nhonest, human heart of the American people. To that I appeal! To the\r\npress; to the pulpit; to every voter in the land; to every lover of\r\nmankind. For the honor of our common country; for the sake of suffering\r\nhumanity; force your representative to meet this issue’.” * * * * *\r\n\r\n“Thirty years ago a Commissioner of Indian Affairs delivered himself of\r\na fervent opinion which should become classic. The miserable story of\r\nthe California Indians had dragged itself through twenty-five years;\r\nevery measure of relief had been blocked in Congress by the interested\r\nfew—the Vociferous Few in the Indian country. ‘This class of Indians,’\r\nconcludes the Commissioner, ‘seems forcibly to illustrate the truth that\r\nno man has a place or a fair chance to exist under the Government of the\r\nUnited States who has not a part in it.’ A more illuminating commentary\r\non the Indian’s unhappy status in the land of the Free can hardly be\r\nwritten in one sentence. The Indian’s story does not argue that the\r\nIndian should have been at any time given the protection of the\r\nfranchise; but it _does_ argue that in a loose-jointed republic where\r\nnational legislation is at the beck and call of every little coterie of\r\nirresponsible voters, the Indian has been subjected to more devilish\r\nvariations of human caprice than if he were at the mercy of an openly\r\noppressive, but more consistent and centralized style of government.\r\nThere is no despotism more whimsically cruel than that of men unused to\r\npower, who suddenly find themselves in absolute control of a people\r\nwhose one vital interest—an advantageous foothold on _good land_—is in\r\ncontinual conflict with their own chief desire—the possession of that\r\nsame good land.”\r\n\r\nI have reprinted from these books for a definite purpose. All four\r\nauthors had practical experience with Indian affairs; all knew their\r\nsubjects—not one was visionary. Our historians and public officials have\r\ndenied none of the statements contained in these books. Since the abuses\r\ncontinue, and we have forgotten the lessons of the past, it now remains\r\nfor us to change our Indian policy—to do so absolutely. We have been\r\nrepeatedly warned, we cannot escape our responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           CHAPTER XXXV. OFFICIAL VIEWS OF INDIAN CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCommissioner Sells very kindly instructed a number of his Supervisors\r\nand Superintendents to reply to my fourteen questions covering the\r\npresent condition of our Indians. The questions need not be repeated as\r\nthey are given in the table, Chapter XXXII.\r\n\r\nThese replies present the administration point of view, and I herewith\r\nappend such of the answers as are already not repetitions. Those that do\r\nnot convey special information are omitted.\r\n\r\nHonorable H. B. Peairs, Supervisor of Schools, Washington, D.C.,\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\nVI. “From extended observations during the past five years, I am\r\nconfident that there has been very marked progress and that the general\r\ncondition of the Indians is very much better than it was ten years ago.\r\nI had the opportunity of doing one full year’s work in the field in\r\n1897, during which time I traveled in all sections of the country and\r\nvisited more than one-half of the reservations and schools. The past\r\nfour years have given me an opportunity to visit practically all of the\r\nreservations and schools, and I unhesitatingly say that there is a\r\nmarked improvement.”\r\n\r\nVIII. “The mixed-blood. They are an English-speaking people, more\r\nintelligent and more capable in every way, considering the average\r\nmixed-blood. Their homes are far superior and they are more ambitious to\r\nimprove conditions. The fact that they are unwilling to remain as they\r\nare in many instances results in their being somewhat troublesome, but\r\nthis only emphasizes a desire for better conditions.”\r\n\r\nXIII. “I believe the Government is making a conscientious effort to\r\nprotect the Indian in all of his interests, both property and human.\r\nUndoubtedly there are instances where, through bad legislation, weak\r\nadministration, or both, great injustice has been done. There is great\r\ndifference of opinion as to what is best to do in many instances for the\r\nIndians. What might be considered by some to be an injustice, might be\r\nconsidered by others as being the best possible thing for the Indian.\r\nFor instance, some oppose very positively the taxation of Indian lands\r\nof any class. Personally, I believe that all productive inherited Indian\r\nlands should be taxed in order that funds might become available for the\r\nsupport of local institutions, such as public schools, and for the\r\nproper maintenance of public roads, bridges, etc. On the other hand,\r\nthere are those who believe that there should be greater freedom in the\r\nmatter of issuing patents in fee for allotted lands and to the allottee.\r\nPersonally, I believe that the original allottee should not be permitted\r\nto dispose of his allotment and thus be without a permanent home. In\r\ninstances it might be well to permit the allottee to sell a portion of\r\nhis allotment, the receipts therefrom to be used in improving the\r\nremaining portion.\r\n\r\n“I give these illustrations simply to show that differences of opinion\r\nwith reference to what is best for the Indian and what is not best, may\r\ngive color to the answer to the seventh question.”\r\n\r\nHonorable John B. Brown, Supervisor of Education, Muskogee, Oklahoma,\r\nsays:—\r\n\r\nVII. “The morality of the Indians in the Five Civilized Tribes is\r\nbelieved to be as good as the average of their community, which is\r\nreasonably high, except possibly in some full-blood communities where\r\nliving conditions are not conducive to the best moral status.”\r\n\r\nX. “The opinion on this subject is divided. I have made careful inquiry\r\nat every Agency visited, both within and adjoining the Five Civilized\r\nTribes. I believe that more depends upon the home conditions and\r\nefficiency of Government employees on the reservation than any other one\r\npoint except the individual peculiarities of the young Indian in\r\nquestion. Given the same quality of manhood in the Indian under\r\nconsideration, and the same efficiency on the part of officials in\r\ncharge of the reservation, I have not been able to detect any marked\r\nchange in favor of either the reservation or non-reservation system of\r\neducation.”\r\n\r\nVIII. “My judgment is that under the more recent practices of our\r\nDepartment, the Indians are being as fully protected as it is\r\npracticable to do; that is, that every reasonable effort is honestly\r\nbeing put forth for such protection.”\r\n\r\nHonorable O. H. Lipps (at the time Mr. Lipps wrote he was in charge of\r\nCoeur D’Alene, Flathead and other Indians in the northwest.) Briefly\r\nsummed up, his opinion is to the effect that the full-bloods are in the\r\nbest condition; that white people are taking advantage of the Flatheads,\r\nbut not of other Indians in his region. Few white men marry full-blood\r\nIndian women, but white men marry mixed-bloods for their property.\r\n\r\nXIII. “I believe the Indian Department is doing all in its power to\r\nprotect the Indians’ property; more could be done to protect his\r\nhealth.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Elsie E. Newton is one of the Supervisors in charge of health of\r\nthe Indians. She has served for many years in the Indian Office, and is\r\none of the most competent employees. I quote at considerable length from\r\nher letter.\r\n\r\nVI. “I cannot answer this with precision as my knowledge of the Indian\r\ncountry, except in one or two localities, is less than ten years old.\r\n\r\n“It can be said, however, that even in five years there has been a great\r\nchange in the environment of the Indian, with few exceptions. The Whites\r\nhave settled pretty well in and around him and have diffused ideas which\r\nin time he is bound to adopt in more or less degree. I speak of matters\r\nof dress, food, shelter, etc. The superficial aspect of his life is\r\nchanging. In like manner, his attitude toward law, morals, etc., are\r\nbeing modified. It appears that he is going through that period of\r\ntransition, forgetting the old code of life, or at least not regarding\r\nit, and yet not dominated by the new. This transition period is always\r\none of distinct loss both in moral force, and achievement. From this\r\npoint of view, he is not as well off today as he was ten years ago, but\r\nuntil he has passed through the critical period, it is unfair to make\r\ncomparison by years merely.”\r\n\r\nVII. “Immorality is a relative term. Certain Indian tribes had moral\r\ncodes under which they lived and lived acceptably, or morally. Those\r\ncodes differed and the difference in them marks the diversity of the\r\ngeneral condition of those tribes today. Thus we find the Crows\r\ndeteriorating while the Northern Cheyennes, living practically next\r\ndoor, are still good stock. The sexual morality of the former is low\r\ncompared to that of the latter.\r\n\r\n“Few Indians practice monogamy after the Anglo-Saxon ideal—one partner\r\nonly, and one partner for life. Divorces are common and frequent; even\r\nso, one finds few prostitutes among the best tribes, and promiscuity is\r\nnot common. Even in the lower tribes where promiscuity is common, the\r\nprostitute is not. Such tribes have still the remnants of phallicism in\r\ntheir ceremonies.\r\n\r\n“The state of morals is not due so much to the presence of low Whites,\r\ngenerally speaking, as it is to the fact mentioned above, that the\r\ntribal authority has become loosened, their own social restraints have\r\ndisappeared, and there is no definite code, or its enforcement\r\nsucceeding. The Federal law has never covered the ground on reservations\r\nwhere it retained jurisdiction and where the Indians are citizen\r\nallottees, the State does not exert itself to exercise control; local\r\njudicial machinery is reluctant to punish infractions of the law, partly\r\nbecause the community concerns itself very little with offences of the\r\nkind among Indians themselves, and partly because of the expense\r\ninvolved in prosecutions, in which Indians bear no share by taxation.\r\n\r\n“As regards that morality which is designated honesty, I hardly believe\r\nthat the word of an Indian today is as good, man for man, as in the\r\nprevious generation. Traders would be more competent to give testimony\r\non this point, because in their business they have learned whom to trust\r\nand whom to suspect.\r\n\r\nIX. “The white man is more likely than not to take advantage of an\r\nIndian where his own advantage is concerned. This is due as much to the\r\ninnate pushing quality of the Whites, as the corresponding retiring\r\nquality of the Indian. It is frequently a racial rather than a moral\r\nmatter. It is often a matter of mere competition between Whites. For\r\ninstance, I once had a conversation with a bank official in an Indian\r\ncountry, where banks were discounting Indian notes at an impossible\r\nusurious rate. The man was highly respected in the community, well\r\nregarded for honesty, a church worker, and in my own opinion a good,\r\ntypical American. We discussed the matter reasonably, and he concluded\r\nby saying, ‘I suppose this sort of thing seems unpardonable to you,’ and\r\nwhen I acquiesced, he continued, ‘We look at it about this way,—if we do\r\nnot get the Indian’s money, some one else will.’ The Indian makes no\r\nresistance to such treatment, partly through inability, partly through\r\nunambition.\r\n\r\nXIII. “In general, it is; in some instances it is too paternalistic; in\r\nothers, it is sometimes crowded to an issue contrary to distinctly good\r\nIndian policy by interests which bear upon general public policy. In\r\nother words, the Indian interest must frequently be sacrificed for\r\ngeneral and broader interest.\r\n\r\n“I might say that the Government is protecting the Indian, and\r\nprotecting him well, but the public is not. If the public would be more\r\njust, the Government might exert less paternalism, with great advantage\r\nto the individual Indian.\r\n\r\n“It should be added that often the Indian stands in the attitude of\r\nfinding Government protection irksome, just as a child often feels\r\ntoward parental authority. As one Government official aptly said, ‘It is\r\nhard to protect the Indian when he doesn’t want to be protected’.”\r\n\r\nHonorable Horace G. Wilson, Supervisor of Indians, Rosebud, Oregon,\r\nreplies to the questions rather briefly. He believes that the general\r\ncondition of the Indians is better than ten years ago; that the Indian\r\nis naturally immoral, but his wickedness increases through contact with\r\nlow Whites; that the mixed-bloods are in the best condition; white\r\npeople are taking advantage of the Indians; Indians should be educated\r\nnear at home; white men are marrying Indian women to secure property.\r\nFinally, that the Government is protecting the Indians.\r\n\r\nHonorable Charles F. Peirce, Superintendent of the Flandreau school,\r\nSouth Dakota, says he has in charge a large number of pupils each year.\r\nHe considers the condition more satisfactory than ten years ago; that\r\nthe moral condition of Flandreau Indians compares favorably with that of\r\nwhite people in the surrounding community under same conditions; that\r\nthere is little drunkenness; that the observance of marriage relations\r\nis as good as among white people; that most of the Indians are\r\nfull-bloods; that the mixed-bloods are more industrious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CLASS IN DOMESTIC ART. HASKELL INDIAN SCHOOL. KANSAS\r\n]\r\n\r\n“The Flandreau Indians have been citizens of the State of South Dakota,\r\nvoting and otherwise taking part in municipal affairs for twenty years,\r\nand while the Government is nominally holding jurisdiction over them,\r\nthey need but very little protection, and that is being exercised by the\r\nGovernment as necessity demands.”\r\n\r\nHonorable Frank A. Thackery is Superintendent of the Pima Indian School,\r\nSacaton, Arizona. As to the prevalence of trachoma and tuberculosis ten\r\nyears ago as compared with the present, he cannot give much information.\r\nHe admits that there is a high percentage of deaths from tuberculosis,\r\nand recommends inexpensive hospital camps.\r\n\r\nVI. “Speaking for the Pimas alone, the matter of their water rights is\r\nthe principal factor to be considered in connection with their\r\nadvancement in the past ten years, as upon their right to the water of\r\nthe Gila River rests their sole opportunity for industrial independence.\r\nThe Pimas are victims of circumstances beyond their control in so far as\r\nthe irrigation problem is concerned and the Indian Office is now taking\r\nvery active steps to protect the rights of these Indians wherever the\r\nencroaching whites have jeopardized them.\r\n\r\nVII. “The Pima Indians have a high standard of morality for a primitive\r\npeople, but I believe such deviations as occur are due to the Indian’s\r\nown nature, which is, after all, human nature, and as liable to err as\r\nhis white brother, whose example we will all agree leaves much to be\r\ndesired if set up as the standard to which other races should aspire.”\r\n\r\nIX. “Yes, in so far as appropriating river water to which the Pimas have\r\na prior right.\r\n\r\nX. “Again speaking of the Pimas only, I believe the peculiar climatic\r\nconditions here make it desirable that the boys and girls shall receive\r\ntheir training in this locality. It is safe to say that 95% of the boys\r\nwill be farmers, and such training as they receive along agricultural\r\nlines should correlate with their home conditions and this it is not\r\nlikely to do if obtained in a locality where climatic conditions vary\r\ngreatly from southern Arizona.\r\n\r\nXIII. “I believe the administration is taking every possible step to\r\nsafeguard the interests of the Indians within the limits allowed by the\r\nlaws governing and the funds at its disposal, hampered as it is by the\r\npolitical intriguers who now, as always, seek to control the management\r\nof Indian Affairs for their personal benefit and gain. Your true\r\nreformer is first, and always an extremist; to him a thing is either\r\nblack or white, good or evil, a crime or a virtue. He knows no gradation\r\nof color, no perception of proportions, no knowledge of values. To him\r\nthe world is made up of entirely unrelated antitheses, and all acts of\r\nwhich he does not himself approve are evil. It is easy for such a person\r\nto contend that the Indians have been imposed upon by those entrusted\r\nwith the management of their affairs and to find evidence to support\r\ntheir contentions. But the broad-minded investigator will recognize the\r\npeculiar racial problems with which those interested in the Indians’\r\nadvancement have had to deal, will give due consideration to the\r\nenormity of the task set them, will weigh carefully the intricacy of the\r\nmachinery with which the workers have been forced to labor and will\r\nhesitate to judge adversely where superficial observation would appear\r\nto warrant such a judgment justifiable.”\r\n\r\nI regret that I could not produce these lengthy communications in full.\r\nBut the quotations will give an idea of the Departmental point of view,\r\nand that the dangers are fully appreciated, and every effort made to\r\novercome them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       PAST COMMISSIONERS’ VIEWS\r\n\r\nHonorable T. J. Morgan, appointed Indian Commissioner in June, 1889,\r\nmight be said to have crystalized the policy having as its chief aim,\r\nthe allotting, and the educating of Indians. He was followed by\r\nHonorable D. M. Browning, who served for four years. Honorable W. A.\r\nJones, appointed in May, 1897, served until December, 1904, when Mr.\r\nLeupp succeeded to the office. We may dismiss the careers of the\r\nCommissioners preceding Mr. Leupp, with a blanket statement that they\r\ndid not foresee that a policy emphasizing allotting and educating, and\r\nminimizing protection, would bring about disastrous results. Mr. Leupp’s\r\nadministration felt the full force of the evil effects of policies\r\ninaugurated by his predecessors. We have already discussed Mr. Leupp’s\r\nviews, and further comment is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nComing down to Mr. Valentine’s appointment, June, 1909, we find that Mr.\r\nValentine recognized in the full sense the dangers confronting the\r\nIndian and strove to combat them. At the Lake Mohonk Conference,\r\nOctober, 1909, he delivered a splendid address entitled, “What the\r\nPublic Should Know About the Indian Bureau.” In this he admits that his\r\ninspection service has been weak and that much of the trouble is due to\r\nincomplete, or faulty reports. I have commended elsewhere in this book\r\nMr. Valentine’s health propaganda—for it is largely due to his efforts\r\nthat Congress became aroused to the necessity of increased\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nThe acting Commissioner, Honorable F. H. Abbott, who served from\r\nSeptember, 1912, to Mr. Sells’ appointment in June, 1913, carried out\r\nthe policies inaugurated by his former chief. Abbott opposed wholesale\r\nallotments hastily made, as in the past. He took a firm stand against\r\nthe allotment schemes proposed for the Navaho Indians at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Sells’ policy has been referred to at length on previous pages of\r\nthis book. He was fortunate in his selection of Honorable E. B. Meritt\r\nas Assistant Commissioner, who entered the Bureau in 1910 as chief law\r\nofficer. It was due to Mr. Meritt’s efforts that the application of a\r\nrailroad for the granting of a right of way for the construction of a\r\nline through the San Carlos Indian Reservation, Arizona, was prevented.\r\nHis work on behalf of the Yakima Indians, in protecting their water\r\nrights, was especially effective. He has delivered a number of addresses\r\nat Lake Mohonk, setting forth the aims of the Department under the\r\npresent administration, and cooperates with the Indian Rights\r\nAssociation in its excellent work.\r\n\r\nThe inspection service is now under a new chief, Honorable E. B. Linnen.\r\nAs a practical field-man of wide experience, he has selected a corps of\r\ncompetent men. Investigations are now carried on in a thorough manner,\r\nand incompetent persons removed, and not simply transferred, as in\r\nformer times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MOURNING THE DEAD\r\n\r\n  Photographed by Rev.

STUDENTS AT DENVER, COLORADO\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   CHAPTER XXXVI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM FIELD WORKERS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the many correspondents who aided in the preparation of the table of\r\nstatistics, there were large numbers who made most excellent\r\nrecommendations. I have selected some thirty of these and herewith\r\npresent them in order that they may be preserved. The writers are all\r\npersons of experience in Indian affairs. It will be observed that in\r\nmany details, they do not agree, and yet they suggest, for the most\r\npart, sensible reforms. Practically every one of the entire\r\ncorrespondents had no criticisms to offer of the intentions of the\r\nGovernment, or Indian Office officials. A few criticized local officials\r\nwith whom they came in contact. The following recommendations are not\r\noffered in controversial spirit, nor as a reflection on our able men at\r\nWashington. They are presented as the result of years of experience on\r\nthe part of unselfish men and women, whose only aim is to see the Indian\r\nsaved out of his troubles; simple justice meted out to him, and that he\r\nshould take his place in American life as a real citizen.\r\n\r\n  “I never did in my private opinion approve of the allotment plan and\r\n  never will. I am in favor of the old Roman style of civilizing; give\r\n  the race or nation, for themselves, a large enough tract of land,\r\n  facility for commercial opportunity, let them wrestle with their\r\n  fate, pay a small tribute to the crown; if fit they will survive.\r\n\r\n  “Time will show the merits and demerits of the allotment system. The\r\n  condition of the reservations was much better before this plan was\r\n  inaugurated. Those who have tried to civilize any race or nation\r\n  within twenty-four hours, figuratively speaking, have invariably\r\n  failed. All history will support this statement.”\r\n\r\n                                        Correspondent, Beaulieu, Minn.\r\n\r\n  “I believe the Government made a serious mistake in allowing the\r\n  Indians to sell their land. They could be much helped by the leasing\r\n  of their lands, but when the lands are gone there is no further\r\n  help.”\r\n\r\n                                  Correspondent, Greenwood, So. Dakota\r\n\r\n  “They have better homes than they had ten years ago, have better\r\n  clothing and more to eat. They have advanced too in farming. But\r\n  their lands are going, dead claims are sold often before the Indian\r\n  owner is buried. Their lands rent better now, bringing more money to\r\n  them than they did ten years ago.\r\n\r\n  “I think our Government is doing all it can do for the Indians’\r\n  interest. And I think it has been for several years trying harder\r\n  and harder each year to do its full duty by these people. The\r\n  restrictions on their lands, their perfect system of schools, their\r\n  vigilance to keep whiskey from them, their eagerness to protect\r\n  them; all these things go to show that the heart of the Government\r\n  has a soft spot for the Indian and it will be a sad day for the\r\n  Indian when the Government turns him loose.”\r\n\r\n                                         Correspondent, Hugo, Oklahoma\r\n\r\n  “The Government should do more to secure justice for citizen Indians\r\n  in the local courts. Conditions are very bad.”\r\n\r\n                                       Correspondent, Santee, Nebraska\r\n\r\n  “Too much red tape.”\r\n\r\n                                      Correspondent, Odanah, Wisconsin\r\n\r\n  “If the U. S. Government laws, protecting the Indians, could be only\r\n  enforced, the Indians would be well protected.”\r\n\r\n                                        Correspondent, Beaulieu, Minn.\r\n\r\n  “The best protection to the Indians would be the giving to each man\r\n  the portion of goods and lands that belong to him as an individual,\r\n  or to his family, and then for a very brief period exercise an elder\r\n  brotherly control of his affairs, rather by way of suggestion. This\r\n  is my opinion as to the Indians in this region at the present time.”\r\n\r\n                                     Correspondent, Rosebud, S. Dakota\r\n\r\n  “When I came here, over eighteen years ago, many lived on their\r\n  farms, miles away from town, wore citizens’ clothes, talked English,\r\n  were industrious in a way. When they were allotted, they were\r\n  allowed to have Indian villages and in consequence they left their\r\n  farms, flocked together, returned to the blanket, Osage language,\r\n  old customs, etc. In northeastern Oklahoma, where they were\r\n  allotted, they were forced to live on their allotments and became\r\n  industrious.\r\n\r\n  “In conclusion, I would say turn the Indians loose entirely, place\r\n  them on a par with the Whites, as soon as possible, and that should\r\n  be very soon.”\r\n\r\n                                        Correspondent, Pawhuska, Okla.\r\n\r\n  “The Government is doing something in the way of intellectual and\r\n  industrial training of the young, but fails to stir up an ambition\r\n  to carry these things into life; the Government has established a\r\n  hospital for the sick, and has several physicians who are paid for\r\n  caring for the sick; yet disease and death are on the increase; the\r\n  Government recognizes the Indians as wards, and says that no liquor\r\n  shall be sold to them, yet will sell a license to a man that he may\r\n  open a saloon on a reservation. The saloons may not sell liquor to\r\n  Indians, yet drunken Indians are as common as dandelions on a lawn.\r\n  I need not say more. The Government is too big; it is ineffective.\r\n  The whole problem should be put into the hands of a Commission made\r\n  up of men with hearts that are something more than pumping-stations,\r\n  and who are experts in this matter. I say this without any criticism\r\n  of individuals but of the system as a whole. We must get the Indian\r\n  problem out of politics; we must give the Commission power to act\r\n  within certain limits.\r\n\r\n  “Had we had men of heart and of vision, what might not have been\r\n  done for the Indians on the White Earth Reservation? A study of the\r\n  Indian would have revealed him as a social creature; of choice he\r\n  lived in a settlement surrounded by his friends. This would have\r\n  suggested the gathering of Indians into villages rather than\r\n  scattering them upon allotments of land without any knowledge of, or\r\n  taste for farming. In these villages might have been built houses on\r\n  one-acre tracts for 150 families, and there might have been provided\r\n  a school, hospital, store, etc. The school would be a day-school,\r\n  and the children left in the homes of their parents. Two field\r\n  matrons could visit every home at least once each week, and from\r\n  time to time gather the women for instructions in care of the home,\r\n  care of children, etc. The physician could easily look after the\r\n  sick.”\r\n\r\n                                   Correspondent, Cass Lake, Minnesota\r\n\r\n  “In the town of Yerington, Nevada, having a white population of 682\r\n  (last census), there are at least fifteen places where liquor is\r\n  sold. Yerington is situated in Mason’s valley about twenty-five\r\n  miles from the reservation, and is surrounded by a farming section\r\n  and in the outlying hills are many mining prospectors and a few\r\n  mines in operation. Occasionally a stranded prospector drifts into\r\n  the town, and readily learns that the easiest way to get another\r\n  ‘grubstake’ is to bootleg whiskey to Indians, and so there is\r\n  considerable of this work done. Also, in the town of Yerington are\r\n  many places where ‘yen-chee’ is sold, and a good per cent. of these\r\n  Indians are opium users.\r\n\r\n  “Since the Agent took charge of the agency in June he has made some\r\n  regulations restricting the Indians from leaving their land\r\n  (allotments) at any and all seasons, by requiring each Indian to get\r\n  a pass from the office before leaving the reservation, and this\r\n  regulation has cut down the revenue of some of these towns, so much\r\n  so that an attorney of low caliber and an ex-judge made and\r\n  circulated a petition among both Indians and Whites, requesting an\r\n  investigation of the Agent’s disciplining the Indians be made, which\r\n  was supplemented by a request that he be removed. Their charges were\r\n  heard by an officer at Yerington and the testimony submitted in a\r\n  way that was more amusing than many theatrical comedies; one of the\r\n  witnesses even turned to the attorney and asked what it was he told\r\n  him to say! The smell of whiskey on the attorney and some of the\r\n  witnesses was very noticeable.\r\n\r\n  “The so-called Medicine Men are, I think, the greatest hindrance\r\n  among the tribal evils that the Paiute Indians have to conquer; when\r\n  they are ‘doctoring’ a sick person and are convinced that the\r\n  patient is going to die, they accuse some progressive Indian of\r\n  being a ‘witch’ and claim the sickness is due to a spell cast over\r\n  them by the ‘witch’.\r\n\r\n  “I think it would be better if the Indian children were not forced\r\n  to go to school at such a very early age (five to six years). The\r\n  change from a free life at home to a strict routine school life is\r\n  hard, especially at such a tender age. I do not doubt that in a\r\n  number of cases it weakens the constitution and makes them far more\r\n  susceptible to tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n  “I also am convinced it would be far more to the benefit of the\r\n  Indians if a great percentage of the money which is yearly spent in\r\n  large non-reservation schools, would be used on the reservation in\r\n  order to develop more water and to improve more land, so that every\r\n  Indian could get enough agricultural land, so as to make it possible\r\n  for him to make a living on his farm. A part of said money could\r\n  even be spent to assist him in fencing his land, procuring farm\r\n  implements and the like. With such a start and well-meaning\r\n  officers, who, when necessary, even would strictly insist that all\r\n  cultivate their lands properly, most of the Indians would, within a\r\n  few years, become self-supporting and also support their children.\r\n  These children, as they grow up, in turn should be made to assist\r\n  their parents in their home duties.\r\n\r\n  “Reservation day-schools, as a rule, should suffice also for the\r\n  Indian children. In these they could surely receive such an\r\n  education as is necessary for an honest and happy living. Most of\r\n  the white children in country districts have no better opportunity.”\r\n\r\n                                       Correspondent, Phoenix, Arizona\r\n\r\n  (_Formerly lived at Yerington, Nev._)\r\n\r\n  “Competent Indians should be given control of their business;\r\n  full-bloods or near full-bloods educated by the retention of coal\r\n  royalties, or schools maintained by direct Congressional action.\r\n  Oklahoma needs schools for Indians more than it needs Federal\r\n  buildings or battleships.”\r\n\r\n                                     Correspondent, Muskogee, Oklahoma\r\n\r\n  “The general tendency of the Government to take away the safeguards\r\n  over the Indians’ property and person, while of course in line with\r\n  the generally agreed plan for ultimate citizenship is proving very\r\n  destructive at the present stage of advancement.

INDIAN MEN AND WOMEN OF\r\n                          PROMINENCE. MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was much of the old Indian life, beyond the Mississippi, in the\r\nyears preceding 1880, that was picturesque if not beautiful. Contrary to\r\npopular belief, the Indians were not continually at war. Certain\r\norganizations of young men among some bands did make warfare their chief\r\naim of life until reaching middle age. But the average Indian at home\r\nwas just as different from the Indian on the warpath, as are our troops\r\nin action, the opposite of the same men as citizens. Entirely too much\r\nemphasis has been placed upon the Indian as a warrior.\r\n\r\nThe communistic life was in vogue in many places west of the Mississippi\r\nbetween 1850 and 1878. The communistic sentiment, evinced in nearly\r\nevery village and clan-group, was so different from our life today, that\r\nI find myself compelled to illustrate it through the following incident.\r\n\r\nThe old blind medicine man of the Otter-tail Pillagers,\r\nBay-bah-dwun-gay-aush, was found by me helpless, living in a wretched\r\nshack on the edge of a swamp at Pine Point, Minnesota. He had been\r\nswindled out of his property. Commissioner Valentine, on my\r\nrecommendation, kindly issued orders that old Bay-bah-dwun-gay-aush and\r\nhis friend, the aged May-cud-day-wub, be rationed every Wednesday as\r\nlong as they lived. Out of gratitude, the old man gave me the original\r\nbirch-bark roll of the Mid-di-we-win, or Grand Medicine Society. He was\r\nthe roll-keeper. In 1909, when received, the roll was 102 years old. It\r\ncontains five degrees, which have been translated, but the old shaman\r\nrequested that publication be deferred until his death. I desire to\r\npresent in abridged form the fourth, or the Beaver degree, illustrating\r\nthat phase of Indian character to which I have referred. In a general\r\nway, the sentiment is expressed as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The beavers live together in harmony. They occupy one village. They\r\n  do not take advantage of each other as do white people. They share\r\n  everything in common. They strike the water at night, and thus\r\n  signal to each other when danger is near. Their storehouses of food\r\n  are open to all. They help each other, build the dams together, care\r\n  for the young and support the old. Thus we Ojibwa should live as do\r\n  the beavers and as did our grandfathers, who learned this from the\r\n  beaver clan.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between this beautiful sentiment and that obtaining in most\r\nIndian communities today is very marked. With the passing away of the\r\ncommunistic life, and the adoption of the more selfish point of view of\r\nthe white man, Indian character was not greatly improved.\r\n\r\nThe begging dance, quite common two or three generations ago, survives\r\nhere and there in spite of efforts of the Government and the\r\nmissionaries to extinguish it. This same begging, or gift dance, has\r\nbeen persistently misunderstood. Originally, a Sioux, Pawnee, Cheyenne,\r\nor other Indian, who assembled his friends together and distributed in\r\naddition to food, even his blankets and ponies, became a famous man. He\r\nhad done a good thing. His act was prompted by generosity, and a love of\r\nhis fellowman. The Agent and missionary, however, told him that one\r\nshould not give gifts, but on the contrary he must accumulate and hoard.\r\nAll of this was very confusing to the Indians of the transition period.\r\nThe older Indians (_page 324_) cannot refuse their friends food, and\r\nsuch as still continue in the faith of their fathers feed those less\r\nfortunate than themselves, although by so doing they deprive themselves\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nThe absolute change from these communistic ideas, from the general\r\nbrotherhood of the red man, to the more practical (if not sordid) views\r\nof the white man, had a curious effect on many of the Indians. The\r\nsharper Indians soon observed that among the white people there were\r\nrich and poor. The missionary, unselfishly laboring to uplift the\r\naborigines, was very poor in this world’s goods. Yet he was\r\nself-sustaining and endeavored to persuade the Indians to become so.\r\nBoth the Government teacher and the missionary impressed upon the\r\naborigine ideas of thrift. Soon after allotments were issued, and the\r\nIndians received same, appeared other white men—bankers, real estate men\r\nand merchants. All of these secured Indian land or timber, and thus\r\nbecame well-to-do or rich. A certain class of half-educated Indians\r\nshrewdly observing that although the missionary pleaded, and the Agent\r\nand lawyer of the Great Father talked and blustered much, one hard, cold\r\nfact stood out indisputably: the missionary waxed poor, the Indian\r\npoorer, but the man in the frontier town waxed rich. It was\r\nincomprehensible to the old Indian, who clung to communistic ideals, but\r\nperfectly clear to the educated Indian. The latter realized that certain\r\nwhite men did not practice what the good missionary preached. To such,\r\nthe word _theft_ sounded very much the same as _thrift_. So the\r\nIndian—in many cases—drifted into evil ways, and like the white man of\r\nthe frontier town, he scorned the old communistic life of his father,\r\nand to his ear there appeared practically no difference between the two\r\nwords I have mentioned: thrift and theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          INDIAN MEN AND WOMEN\r\n\r\nOf those representing the olden days, there were a large number who\r\nachieved more or less prominence. I am very sorry that space forbids a\r\nconsideration of their careers in this book. I present a partial list of\r\ntheir names, and if readers will consult the _Handbook of American\r\nIndians_, short biographical sketches of most of these will be found.\r\nThe negro has produced far fewer great men than the Indian, yet the\r\nnegro has always vastly outnumbered the former. During forty years there\r\nhas been practically no discrimination against the black man save in the\r\nSouth. His educational advantages in the North have been many, and his\r\nopportunities multitudinous. Slavery retarded him in a sense, yet\r\nslavery taught him enforced industry—which the Indian has never had. We\r\nwould therefore, expect a larger proportion of prominent negro men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nOmitting those previously mentioned in this book, we have: American\r\nHorse, Oglala Sioux; Big Mouth, Brulé Sioux; Black Beaver, Delaware;\r\nBlack Kettle, Cheyenne; Bloody Knife, Arikara; Chas.

Eastman—than whom there is no more competent judge of\r\nthe Plains Indians of 1850–1890—has informed me that next to Red Cloud\r\nand Sitting Bull, he considers Spotted Tail and Crazy Horse (Sioux) two\r\nof the greatest Indians of modern times.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Indians, both educated and not, whose names have been\r\npresented in this Indian History, there occur two who were particularly\r\nprominent in helping their own people.\r\n\r\nBright Eyes (Susette La Flesche) was born in Nebraska about 1850. She\r\nwas educated at a mission school on the Omaha reservation, and later at\r\na private school in Elizabeth, N. J. In 1877–78 the Ponca were forcibly\r\nremoved to Indian Territory from their home on Niobrara reservation,\r\nSouth Dakota. In order to bring Indian removals before the public,\r\nStanding Bear, accompanied by Susette La Flesche and her brother,\r\nvisited the principal cities of the United States, where her appeals for\r\nhumanity toward her race aroused the interest of thousands. As a result,\r\na request was urged on the Government that there be no more removals of\r\ntribes, and this request has been respected, when practicable. She was\r\nvery active with her pen until her death in 1902. She was considered one\r\nof the brightest Indian women of modern times.\r\n\r\nSarah Winnemucca, a Paiute, was born in Nevada in 1844. She became\r\ninterpreter to Government officials, and served General O. O. Howard as\r\nscout in the Bannock War of 1877, when no Indian man would penetrate the\r\ncountry occupied by the hostiles. She lectured in the East in the\r\neighties, and wrote a book on the Paiute’s wrongs. She died in 1891,\r\nafter a remarkable career.\r\n\r\nA score of others might be included as worthy of a place in an Indian\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\nMr. Leupp in his book stated that people were continually asking him\r\nthis question: “Will the Indians produce a Booker T. Washington?”\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible for the Indians to produce a national character.\r\nThere is a splendid work to be done by such a person. For more than a\r\ncentury we have labored in educating Indians, yet we have not produced a\r\nsingle great man or woman. Do not misunderstand me. I mean a truly great\r\nIndian, one of the stamp of Tecumseh, Chief Joseph, Red Cloud,\r\nSacagawea, or Sequoya. The latter was trained and educated fifty years\r\nbefore we devoted any attention to Indian progress, and his alphabet,\r\nhis attainments, and his reputation are due to his own efforts rather\r\nthan to us. What woman have we of the fame of Sacagawea, the poor\r\nShoshoni, who guided Lewis and Clark to the Pacific ocean? Not one.\r\nExcepting Clara Barton, the noble Civil War nurse, and a few other\r\nAmerican women, we have no person, even among white women, who underwent\r\nsuch dangers and privations, or stood forth more clearly as a brave and\r\nheroic character than this same Sacagawea. We have produced a great many\r\nnoble Indians, men and women, prominent, but not to be considered truly\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _by Rodman Wanamaker 1918_ _The Last Outpost_]\r\n\r\nOne may not misrepresent, if one claims that the Indian great men and\r\nwomen are of the past. There will not arise a Booker Washington, unless\r\nsome strong, able Indian champions the cause of his people in the large\r\nsense. There are a number of young, bright Indians, chief among whom is\r\nMr. Henry Roe-Cloud, and one or two others. But most of the educated\r\nIndians are concerned with other than Indian matters. None of them may\r\nbe said to have entered the public arena as a dominant figure. If an\r\neducated Indian should give up his entire time to working for his\r\npeople, as Doctor Grenfell works for the fishermen of Labrador, he would\r\nbecome famous. It has always been a surprise to me that the educated\r\nIndians have not seen this opportunity and availed themselves of it.\r\nHundreds of the educated Indians are teachers, ministers, or Government\r\nemployees. All of them are, as everybody knows, upright and able. But\r\nthere is a vast difference between a position held by these excellent\r\ngentlemen, and a position that might be held by one of their own in\r\nstanding as a true sponsor for the Red Race in America, and in an\r\nintelligent and forceful manner presenting the needs and aims of his\r\nrace. Such a man should present an uncompromising front against graft\r\nand incompetency. A mediocre man could not attain to this position, but\r\ngiven the opportunity, there is no reason under the sun why some\r\neducated Indian should not go down into history as a truly great man.\r\n\r\nIt is quite incomprehensible that so many of our educated Indians are\r\ntimid. All of them realize the dreadful situation of many of their\r\nbrothers in the West. A few have referred, in a more or less guarded\r\nfashion, to the wrongs of Indians. Dr. Eastman is especially frank upon\r\nthis subject—as is Dr. Montezuma. Admitting so much, it remains to be\r\nsaid that not one has come before the American public as a stern, able,\r\nuncompromising fighter for the rights of his race.\r\n\r\nThe Indians need a national character. The moment that an Indian of\r\nexceptional ability, presence and strength appears on the platform, and\r\nthrough the press, becomes the champion of his race, the American people\r\nwill rally to his support. But if such an Indian is chiefly concerned in\r\nfurthering the interests of some society, or missionary organization, or\r\nof a single tribe of Indians; and if he presents mere denunciations and\r\ndoes not suggest proper remedies, he will achieve no great success.\r\n\r\nThe Society of American Indians is doing a good work, but in my humble\r\nopinion, it might accomplish far greater results if in addition to its\r\nadvocacy of new laws, the division of Indian money, etc., its powerful\r\norganization began a fight through the medium of some selected champion,\r\nfor the full protection of Indian rights and an effective, and not a\r\npaper citizenship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LARGE INDIAN HOUSE, FORT BERTHOLD RESERVATION. FAMILY OF SIX\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INDIAN MORALITY\r\n\r\nOn page 380, Mrs. Elsie E. Newton stated that morality was a relative\r\nterm, or depended on one’s point of view. This is entirely true. The\r\noldtime Indians were not immoral, although some of them were unmoral.\r\nImmorality came with the white man. There was an abundance of cruelty\r\namong Indians, and I have alluded to it elsewhere. Many Indians would\r\nnot do things which we consider proper, or at least do not forbid in our\r\nmoral code. As against this, some Indian customs are considered by us to\r\nbe immoral. Drinking, while practiced in Mexico and among Apaches, and\r\nin some Southwest tribes, was practically unknown throughout the rest of\r\nthe United States prior to the landing of our respected ancestors on the\r\nshores of Virginia, New York, and Massachusetts. The black drink of the\r\nCreeks was ceremonial, and not indulged in as an intoxicant. I have\r\nreferred elsewhere to plural marriages. These do not seem to have been\r\nconsidered by the Indians any more immoral than they were by the\r\npatriarchs of the Old Testament. Indians usually supported their wives,\r\neven after separation. The modern method of easy divorce, followed by\r\nthe usual suit for alimony, is reserved to polite white society. I once\r\nheard a worthy gentleman lamenting plural marriages among the Navaho. An\r\neducated Indian happened to be present, and he mentioned the names of\r\ntwo prominent white persons (to be found in _Who’s Who in America_).\r\nBoth occupy high positions, and one has had six wives and the other five\r\nhusbands. The educated Indian ventured to remark to the worthy\r\n“uplifter” that a careful search of the Navaho reservation would fail to\r\nproduce (even among the so-called pagans) two polygamists equal to these\r\nrepresentatives of the white man’s civilization!\r\n\r\nI have never seen a really immoral dance among Indians. I have heard\r\nmany addresses at various public gatherings in which the immorality of\r\nthe Indians during these dances was denounced. Although witnessing\r\nthirty or forty dances on different reservations, all the performers I\r\nobserved were properly dressed. Even in the Sioux Omaha dance, the men\r\nwore quite as much as do college students during a track meet. In the\r\nsquaw dance, in which both sexes take part, the partners do not even\r\nhold each other. Yet, a minister once denounced me for taking part in so\r\ninnocent a pastime. The very next evening the white employees on that\r\nreservation gave a dance, all of us attended, and I had the pleasure of\r\ndancing with the reverend gentleman’s daughter. He saw nothing wrong in\r\nthe waltz or two-step in which partners hold each other—and there is no\r\nharm in such dances. Yet he objected to the squaw dance in which the\r\nparticipants scarcely look at their partners. I mention this merely to\r\nindicate how inconsistent many people are with reference to Indian\r\ndances. I am informed that some of the educated Indians now take part in\r\nthe maxixe and the fox-trot. If the reverend gentleman, to whom I have\r\nreferred, was scandalized in observing a squaw-dance, what must be his\r\nfeelings when he observes educated young men and women lapsing into the\r\npaganism of Paris and New York!\r\n\r\nThe Government’s taboo of the begging dance, and the curtailment of the\r\nordinary Indian dances, leave no amusements in which the older Indians\r\nmay participate. Consequently, they are quite likely to gamble and\r\nengage in far more harmful pastimes. Ordinary dances should be\r\npermitted, and the gift dance regulated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             CHAPTER XXXVIII. TWO STORIES. UNWISE PURCHASES\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one should write a book devoted to stories of Indian heroism, the\r\nfulfilment of promises and kindred subjects. There is much material of\r\nthis character available on many of our reservations. I do not mean\r\nfolk-lore, or traditions, but stories of actual happenings, most of\r\nwhich are quite unknown to the average white citizen.\r\n\r\nDuring the White Earth investigation in Minnesota, I frequently joined a\r\ngroup of Indians and through interpreters, Mr. John Lufkins, or Mrs.\r\nRose Ellis, persuaded the old men and women to relate some of their\r\nexperiences. The first story, that of Ojibwa, was told by a man bearing\r\nthe same name as the tribe. He was a famous warrior, noted for his\r\nbravery in action against the Sioux. His friend, No-de-na-qua-um (the\r\nTemperance Chief), also a famous warrior, had been shot through the\r\nright lung, and proudly exhibited to us the scars in his chest and back.\r\n\r\nThe story of Ojibwa is presented as taken down at the time, without\r\nexplanations or additions, being a literal translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OJIBWA’S STORY\r\n\r\n“When I was young, long ago, there were three Sioux who went into a home\r\nand assaulted a white woman, near Fort Snelling. The white woman\r\nscreamed, and her husband ran up, took one of the three guns left\r\noutside the door by the Indians, shot one of the Indians, and the other\r\ntwo killed the white man. During this summer the soldiers tried to get\r\nthe two Sioux who did this and could not find them.\r\n\r\n“About a year afterwards, while at war, I killed a Sioux myself, and\r\nabout the middle of the winter when we were camping at Little Rock Lake\r\nwe heard that the soldiers were coming. The soldiers came and sent for\r\nHole-in-the-Day, who was head chief. After he had been with them a\r\nlittle while the soldiers sent for me. I went over and found them eating\r\ndinner. As soon as I was there, they told me to eat, which I did. The\r\nCaptain sat near me. The Captain said, ‘Did you kill the Sioux?’ and I\r\nreplied, ‘I am the man.’ Then he asked me how I killed him, and I said I\r\nused my gun.\r\n\r\n“He said, ‘What did you put in your gun?’ I told him, ‘I put in powder\r\nand bullet. Then I shot him and scalped him.’\r\n\r\n“Then the Captain said, ‘I am sent to come after you.’ I said, ‘I will\r\ngo along with you.’ He said, ‘Have you made up your mind fully to go\r\nalong with me?’ I again said, ‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n“Hole-in-the-Day then stood up and said, ‘You cannot take him until I\r\ngive my consent. I will bring him myself after the ice goes out.’\r\n\r\n“The Captain said, ‘You are a chief and you can bring him down when\r\nconvenient.’ The Captain shook hands with me and said to\r\nHole-in-the-Day, ‘Bring your son down to the fort in the spring.’\r\nHole-in-the-Day told our hunters not to go out but to go to Fort\r\nSnelling, and about forty of us went down there in canoes. When we got\r\nnear there, we sent a letter by the interpreter saying we would arrive\r\nabout noon the next day. When we arrived at the landing a soldier tried\r\nto shove our canoes back. Hole-in-the-Day jumped out and kept the\r\nsoldier from hurting us and sent word to the General that we were there.\r\nThen some officers came down and Hole-in-the-Day tore all my clothes\r\noff, leaving me naked. Hole-in-the-Day made himself naked and painted\r\nhimself red. We walked up the hill together, the Ojibwa back of us. We\r\nwere led to the flagpole. The General came out and shook hands with us.\r\nHole-in-the-Day said to the General, ‘I am here. I am Hole-in-the-Day. I\r\npromised you I would be here at this time and bring my son. I am giving\r\nmy son to you. If you want to hang him, hang him; if you wish to punish\r\nhim, do so; if you care to place him in the guardhouse, put him there. I\r\ngive him to you.’\r\n\r\n“I did not speak.\r\n\r\n“‘Just a minute, Hole-in-the-Day,’ said the General. ‘I’ll wait until\r\nthe Sioux arrive and you tell me then the same words in their presence.’\r\nThen the Sioux came. The General was in the center and 400 Sioux back of\r\nhim, with head men scattered in front. Then the General said,\r\n‘Hole-in-the-Day, speak.’ And my chief repeated the same words he had\r\nsaid before. Then the General spoke to the Sioux: ‘Hole-in-the-Day is\r\nhead chief here today and he has given me his son to punish as I see fit\r\nand I shall do so accordingly.’\r\n\r\n“After the General said this, the Sioux head man said, ‘Turn this man\r\nover to us and we will punish him as we see fit.’ The General said, ‘No;\r\nhe was given me to be punished.’\r\n\r\n“Then the soldiers came up and put handcuffs on me while all the Indians\r\nlooked on. The soldiers took me to the guardhouse and put me inside.\r\nThey let me look through a small window and see what was going on.\r\n\r\n“The Sioux would speak and then Hole-in-the-Day would answer, and they\r\nkept at it all day long. About evening I saw the soldiers with two Sioux\r\non whom they had fastened balls and chains, and they led them to the\r\nguardhouse. The guards unlocked my door and brought me down to where the\r\ntwo Sioux were. We were put in the same room and guarded there. Then the\r\nguard took me back upstairs. Then I saw the Sioux march out of the fort\r\nand the Ojibwa stayed.\r\n\r\n“After the Sioux were out of sight my guard came, unlocked my door, took\r\noff the handcuffs and hung them on the wall and brought me out. He took\r\nme to the General and when I got there the General was laughing and held\r\nout his arm and shook hands with me.\r\n\r\n“The General patted me on the shoulder and said, ‘Thank you, thank you.\r\nYou have helped me capture the men I wanted.’ He said, ‘If ever you get\r\nin trouble my authority will protect you.’ He wrote a paper and sent me\r\nto a store nearby where I was clothed Then I returned to the General,\r\nwho had me shown about the fort, and we camped all day and were guarded\r\nby soldiers so the Sioux would not bother us. Next day a steamer\r\narrived. We saw the Sioux prisoners march down and get on the steamer\r\nand go away.\r\n\r\n“After some time we went home and reached our country safely, being\r\nguarded part way by the soldiers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE STORY OF MAH-EEN-GONCE\r\n\r\nMah-een-gonce, or Little Wolf, was a rather small Ojibwa Indian about\r\nfifty years of age. He was an inmate of the Indian boarding-house at\r\nWhite Earth, Minnesota, in 1909. I observed that this Indian had lost\r\nboth legs at the knee, and walked about with great difficulty. On\r\nSundays, he arrayed himself in his best garments and strapped to his\r\nknees two cork legs, on the feet of which he wore laced shoes. He\r\nmanaged to walk fairly well when he had on what he called his “white\r\nman’s legs”. I asked him how he happened to lose his feet and he told me\r\na remarkable story of his own suffering, and sacrifice on the part of\r\nhis grandfather.\r\n\r\n“When I was twelve years old, I happened to be in camp with my parents\r\nnear Crow-wing, Minnesota. At this place there were four large wigwams\r\nin which lived thirty or more Indians. One of the head men called us\r\ntogether and made announcement that he would move the camp to a place\r\ncalled Hackensack. Some of the Indians did not wish to go there, as it\r\nwas snowing heavily and we were comfortably located. But Say-kash-e-gay,\r\nthe head man, started in one direction with the main party, and my\r\nmother, grandmother, grandfather and myself went in another direction.\r\nGrandfather said that game was very scarce and food short in the\r\nHackensack region, and that he thought he could take us to a small lake\r\nwhere we would be able to pass the winter without suffering.\r\n\r\n“You must know that this was the winter of the great blizzard in\r\nnorthern Minnesota, when some people died, many suffered, and much stock\r\nof the white people froze to death.\r\n\r\n“As we walked along, my grandmother said she did not feel well. It grew\r\nexceedingly cold and the wind blew very hard. We traveled along slowly,\r\neach helping the other through the drifting snow. We came to a little\r\ncreek, and my grandfather said, ‘Let us stop here’. Near this creek, my\r\ngrandmother sank down exhausted. Grandfather broke dry wood and made a\r\nlarge fire. We put grandmother by the fire and she lay down while the\r\nrest of us moved about to warm ourselves. During the night grandmother\r\ndied and grandfather carried her over the side of a big rock and placed\r\nher there. We passed a hard night; it was bitterly cold and the wind\r\nhowled through the trees. Grandfather said the evil spirits in the pines\r\nwere laughing at us. In the morning I felt pains in my feet and spoke to\r\nmy grandfather and said, ‘Grandpa, my feet hurt very much. There is\r\nsomething the matter with them.’ He built up a big fire and helped me to\r\nremove my leggings and we warmed them by the fire, but I could not keep\r\nmy feet near the heat, because of the pain I suffered.\r\n\r\n“We had eaten the last of our food the previous evening. It continued to\r\nsnow and was so cold that the limbs of the trees snapped with loud\r\nnoises. My mother died of the cold about noon. After she died, we\r\nchanged our position to the side of a sheltered hill and grandpa built\r\nanother fire. All that afternoon and night it continued to snow.\r\nGrandfather lay down about dark near the fire, and he lay partly doubled\r\nup with his face toward the fire, and his back away from it. He put me\r\ninside the hollow his body formed, so that the fire warmed me, and his\r\nbody protected my back from the cold. I felt that I was freezing.\r\nGrandfather could not keep up the fire, for he began to get stiff and he\r\ntold me to throw on the wood. He held me close to him all night and\r\nsaid, now and then, ‘Are you warm?’\r\n\r\n“The snow continued to bank up all of the next day. Grandpa could not\r\nmove about, but I managed to get wood enough to keep the fire burning.\r\nThe third day we were too weak to travel. Then the sun came out, it was\r\na beautiful day, and we heard a bell ringing in the distance.\r\n\r\n“Grandpa said, ‘That must be the bell of the Mission church. We can hear\r\nit because the air is still and cold.’\r\n\r\n“After a long silence, grandfather said, ‘My son, I cannot live. Try to\r\nget up and save your life.’\r\n\r\n“I replied, ‘No, I will not leave you. I will die with you.’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ commanded my grandfather, ‘you must go. You must not stay here.\r\nYou are too young to die.’ And he gave me his papers, for he was a chief\r\nand had papers from Washington and a medal, and other things. I shook\r\nhands with him and told him goodbye, and started in the direction of the\r\nbell. I cut two sticks for canes to help hold me up, as my legs were\r\nlike wood. I was very weak and hungry. Grandfather raised his body a\r\nlittle—he was half sitting up, raising himself with his hands—when I\r\nlooked back at him, he looked at me and then put his head down. I went\r\nalong slowly for some time. I heard some one singing. Then I thought\r\nthat people were calling me. About noon I was weak and sleepy and could\r\nnot go on. My legs were heavy, like logs. But it had become much warmer,\r\nso I cut down some small bushes, made a bed and lay down, very tired.\r\nWhile lying there my grandfather seemed to come and stand by me, and I\r\nsaid to him, ‘Are you going along?’ and he replied, ‘Yes, yes, don’t lie\r\nhere. Get up and exert yourself like a man.’\r\n\r\n“When I woke up it was morning and I was very stiff and cold. I had to\r\nroll over and get my feet and legs down a hill in order to stand up. I\r\ncut two more canes with which to hold me up. I struggled on most of that\r\nday and in the afternoon reached some cabins of my people. They carried\r\nme in and gave me soup and afterwards some meat chopped fine. Then my\r\nlegs began to hurt me. They rubbed them with snow but that did no good.\r\nOh, what pain I suffered! In a few days my feet began to decay, and they\r\ntook me to a doctor, and he cut off both my legs. For many months\r\nafterwards I suffered tortures and wished to die.\r\n\r\n“A few weeks later, the people went out and found my grandfather dead by\r\nthe ashes of our little fire. They also recovered the bodies of my\r\ngrandmother and my mother. If grandfather had not held me next to the\r\nfire, and protected me with his own body that long, cold night, I, too,\r\nwould today be in the Land of the Spirits.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            UNWISE PURCHASES\r\n\r\nThe educated Indians should take a more positive stand in the matter of\r\nprotecting their more unfortunate brethren. Far be it from me to cast\r\nreflections on these persons, but truth compels the statement that a\r\nnumber who should have been foremost in safeguarding the interests of\r\nignorant aborigines availed themselves of close association with their\r\nfellowmen to secure property. At White Earth, of the thirty-seven men\r\nand women mentioned in the Government affidavits as securing lands, at\r\nleast a dozen were educated Indians. This sad fact impressed Inspector\r\nLinnen and myself, and we often talked regarding it. The temptation on\r\nthe part of some educated Indians is to follow the example set by white\r\nmen. Let me present an illustration. In Oklahoma I met Joe B——. He\r\ninformed me that forty acres of land were enough for any Indian. I said,\r\n“Joe, how many acres do you own?” “Oh, about 2,000.” Joe was red, as to\r\ncolor, but he had the heart of the white man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL—THE CAMPUS\r\n]\r\n\r\nYears ago the Department of Justice began an investigation of land cases\r\nin the State of Oklahoma. Honorable A. N. Frost acted as Special\r\nAssistant to the Attorney General. Mr. Frost was asked to resign from\r\nhis office a short time ago. He delivered a stirring address at the Lake\r\nMohonk Conference this year. In this address (of which I present a part)\r\nMr. Frost referred to the 30,000 Oklahoma land suits before the\r\nDepartment of Justice. According to his published statement, Senator\r\nOwen is concerned in 154 of these suits. I present excerpts from Mr.\r\nFrost’s remarks herewith.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Lake Mohonk Conference, Wednesday evening, October 14, 1914_\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Immediately subsequent to the removal of the restrictions act of 1908 a\r\nveritable Saturnalia of deed-taking from the unrestricted allottees was\r\ncarried on by the hungry land-buyers, white, red, and black. The man who\r\nhas secured a prior deed from the now unrestricted allottee had the best\r\nchance to secure a new one, and he did so in thousands of cases. Many\r\nsuch had been secured by Senator Owen of Oklahoma, or by his agents for\r\nhim. There are today pending in these bills 154 so-called cases against\r\nhim for recovery of Indian lands, most of them involving restricted\r\nallottees and many now unrestricted.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Under the law a deed taken in pursuance of an illegal contract is as\r\nvoid as the illegal contract is; in the absence of a new and completely\r\nvalid consideration. If the prior deed was invalid, if it was a\r\nviolation of the restrictions against alienation imposed by an act of\r\nCongress and therefore totally and completely void, and if that\r\nsubsequent deed was in pursuance and in furtherance of that invalid\r\ncontract, then it is my firm belief that the second deed is as totally\r\nand absolutely invalid as the first. Involved in this proposition is\r\nnecessarily the question of adequacy of consideration. Using the Owen\r\nunrestricted cases again solely as an illustration, I do not know\r\nwhether an adequate consideration was paid or not, though an attempt was\r\nmade to secure from him the necessary information to determine it,\r\nwithout success. If such was paid, of course, in his, as in all other\r\ncases, no further action ought to be taken by the Government. I\r\npresented this proposition of law to the Court; the Court said, that may\r\nbe so, you may be right in the principle of law which you have stated,\r\nbut the Government itself, the allottee being unrestricted, is without\r\nany power to bring a suit on his behalf to have that second deed\r\ncancelled. I urged upon the Department an authorization to appeal from\r\nthe decision of the Court for the reason that a remedy left to the\r\nvolition of the incompetent allottee is no remedy at all. Up to the time\r\nof my ceasing to be connected with the work in Oklahoma, no appeal had\r\nbeen authorized. I do not know why.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A word in conclusion. It seems evident that there has been of late,\r\nupon the part of the Washington departments dealing with Indian affairs,\r\na susceptibility to political influence in connection with Indian\r\nmatters. I want to lift my voice in emphatic protest against the\r\nintroduction of the spoils system into Indian activities. As an\r\nillustration: Mr. Mott, than whom there was no more faithful servant of\r\nthe Indian people, and who has accomplished wonders in their behalf in\r\nthe matter of minors’ estates, was removed; he was replaced by Judge\r\nAllen as counsel for the Creek tribe of Indians. At the time, there were\r\nin the litigation I conducted some sixty odd cases to cancel deeds taken\r\nby him personally, or by a company in which he was interested, from\r\nmembers of the Creek tribe of which he was appointed counsel. Mr. Owen,\r\nthe United States Senator, as I have said before, is involved in some\r\n154 cases, covering full-blood and mixed-blood lands, taken from the\r\nCherokee people. In charge of the litigation has been placed an official\r\ncommonly reputed to be a personal appointee of Senator Owen, the United\r\nStates attorney who was at one time himself a defendant in the suits. I\r\ndo not mean by this to imply that any one, or all of these gentlemen,\r\nhave not or will not accomplish much good for these people, but I do\r\nwish to contend most emphatically for the utmost singleness of purpose\r\nand freedom from all possible entanglements which might even\r\nunconsciously warp judgment in the men selected to deal with these and\r\nall Indian matters. I cite these illustrations, not for the purpose of\r\nstriking at anybody in high places. It is farthest from my thoughts and\r\nI sincerely wish for them all the highest degree of success in their\r\nefforts in behalf of the Indian. What I have said with reference to them\r\nis true to an all too great degree among many other men of prominence in\r\nOklahoma. I wish to repeat that there should be selected in connection\r\nwith the litigation, in connection with all Indian affairs in the State\r\nof Oklahoma, men absolutely free from all suspicion of influence, of any\r\nkind, in order that their efforts and their work may be devoted, singly\r\nand solely, to that which will benefit the Indian allottee; and in this\r\nconnection I want to say, too, that no man ever had associated with him\r\nin public work a more loyal, efficient and devoted set of men than it\r\nhas been my privilege to have had in the years of my activity in Indian\r\nmatters in Oklahoma. I am not among those who decry the people of the\r\nState of Oklahoma as a whole; I have lived among that people for a\r\nperiod of six years; I have learned to love and respect them, and to\r\nadmire their enterprise and spirit of progress amid necessarily adverse\r\ncircumstances, not a little of which was caused by the work I was\r\nengaged in, necessary as I believe it was.\r\n\r\n“Arouse the citizenship of Oklahoma as you would the citizens of the\r\nState of New York or of my own State of Massachusetts, and you will find\r\nthat it is composed of the same class and type of men, ready to respond\r\nat once to the call of duty to suppress wrong.\r\n\r\n“That there exists the other class is beyond question, just as it exists\r\nelsewhere. The existence of the conditions which called forth the\r\nlitigation is proof of this; but, mark you, since the institution of\r\nthese suits, and as a consequence thereof, because of the work of the\r\nCommissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes and the Superintendent of\r\nIndian Affairs in the administration of their offices and in connection\r\nwith these suits, a much better feeling has existed among the citizens\r\nof Oklahoma, and today you will find that except among such as have\r\nheretofore taken widespread and universally of these lands and are\r\ntherefore interested personally, there are many who deprecate the wrongs\r\nas much as you or I.\r\n\r\n“Another wrong impression I want to attempt to correct. In consequence\r\nof the litigation and other causes among them, too much generality in\r\nthe discussion of these matters, statements have been made that titles\r\nin eastern Oklahoma are unsafe. Based upon my years of experience in\r\nconnection with this work, necessitating the reviewing of more titles\r\nprobably than ordinarily falls to the lot of any one man, I confidently\r\nmake the assertion that nowhere in the United States can there be found\r\nany better titles than those in eastern Oklahoma once they have been\r\nproperly acquired.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AN OJIBWA WOMAN DYING OF CONSUMPTION\r\n\r\n  After hearing her story, I drew an affidavit containing her testimony,\r\n    to the effect that she was swindled out of $20,000 worth of\r\n    property, and left to die in poverty. Unable to sit up, she\r\n    requested that I take her hand and affix her thumb print to the\r\n    paper.

Minn.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHAPTER XXXIX. GENERAL COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some general observations which I desire to make prior to my\r\nconclusions. Any one of these might be expanded into an entire chapter,\r\nbut since that is impracticable, it is necessary in the following pages\r\nto refer to a number of subjects both related and unrelated.\r\n\r\nAn illuminating comment as to affairs on the Great Plains between 1850\r\nand 1880 is found in the Mormon records of their great migration from\r\nthe East to Salt Lake City. There is no authentic narrative indicating a\r\nserious clash between these Mormons and the thousands of Indians whom\r\nthey encountered. After their location in Salt Lake City and vicinity\r\nthey preserved friendly relations with the Indians. Brigham Young made a\r\nstatement, embodying the above facts, to Honorable J. V. Farwell, one of\r\nthe original members of the Board of Indian Commissioners, in 1869.\r\n\r\nPeople interested in Indians would do well to consult the early reports\r\nof the Board of Indian Commissioners. The first one was written in 1869\r\nand published in 1870. Contrary to general belief, the Five Civilized\r\nTribes, living in what was then Indian Territory, were working, building\r\nhouses, fencing lands, and progressing. In other sections of the country\r\nas well there was progress to be noted. We do not need to confine our\r\nobservations to the Apache country, Oklahoma or California in order to\r\nprove that the disinclination of many Indians to work, was entirely due\r\nto the fact that the Indian was suddenly removed from savagery and\r\nplaced in civilization. Practically all Indians were self-supporting,\r\nprior to white domination. Otherwise, they would have soon died of\r\nstarvation. The deterioration of the Indian was caused not entirely by\r\nremoval of the means of livelihood (lands, game, irrigation, etc.,) but\r\nbecause of unwise, not to say foolish and incompetent, handling of\r\nIndian affairs. Washington is not so much to blame as is the entire\r\ncountry. Let us consider a specific instance at some length. Mr. John H.\r\nSeger went among the Cheyenne Indians in 1872. From Darlington,\r\nOklahoma, he ran a stage to Fort Elliot, Texas, 160 miles. In 1884 the\r\ncattle men leased all the Cheyenne and Arapaho reservation west of the\r\nSouth Canadian River. They paid $100,000 per year, cash rent. As these\r\nIndians were drawing blankets, rations and clothing from the Government,\r\nso large a sum of money nearly ruined them. Captain J. M. Lee was\r\nappointed Agent, and after two years the Government cancelled the\r\nleasing privilege. These Indians, who formerly raised corn and hauled\r\nfreight (thus earning money in addition to their free sustenance)\r\ncomplained, and desired to continue the leasing privilege in order that\r\nthey might loaf. Captain Lee concluded that Mr. Seger was the only man\r\nable to persuade the Indians to return to their former mode of life.\r\nSeger was given to understand that if he learned the language, and gave\r\nup his life to the care of this band of Indians, he would be continued\r\nin the Service. He moved the Indians sixty miles to the Washita River\r\nand founded what is known as Seger’s Colony. The story of his work among\r\nthese Indians and the many difficulties he overcame makes very\r\ninteresting reading. Seger established a school and later the place was\r\nknown as Seger township. Indians soon constructed twenty-eight houses.\r\nHe labored for more than twelve years, persuaded a missionary\r\norganization to establish a mission and the last year he was in charge\r\nthe net profits of the industries carried on at his school amounted to\r\n$6,993. The story of his removal and the subsequent purchase of much of\r\nthe Indians’ land would be a repetition of what has occurred elsewhere\r\nin this country. I never could understand why competent men are not\r\nretained. Frequent removals, or changes in Washington, are of less\r\nmoment, but in Indian communities much is lost and very little gained\r\nwhen a faithful employee, who has perfected himself in a study of his\r\npeople, is removed from office and some stranger placed in his stead.\r\n\r\nSeveral thousand Indians owning farms protect themselves and hold their\r\nown against white people. They do this notwithstanding changes of men or\r\nof laws. Such need no protection, and I have said little concerning them\r\nin this book. I would that all Indians were so satisfactorily placed in\r\nour body politic. As an illustration of this class of Indians, I present\r\nthe following incident.\r\n\r\nWhen travelling with Major Brennan across Pine Ridge reservation, I\r\nobserved on the cabin of an educated Indian, who wished to protect his\r\nallotment, a large board sign which read as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 NOTICE\r\n                     NO TRESPASSING WILL BE ALLOWED\r\n                     ON MY ALLOTMENT UNDER PENALTY\r\n                               OF THE LAW\r\n\r\n                              JOHN T. BEAR\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of references in this book to Canada. Mr.\r\nDuncan C. Scott, who holds that office in Canada corresponding to our\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, attended the Lake Mohonk Conference this\r\nyear. He showed us a few thin pamphlets—all the regulations, laws,\r\nstatements, methods of procedure, etc., necessary in the management of\r\nCanadian Indian affairs. With us we employ skilled lawyers to fathom the\r\nintent of our legislators. They must needs delve into thousands of pages\r\nof conflicting laws, rules and statutes. And after one set of attorneys\r\nhave presented their views, the mass of legal rulings is so enormous and\r\ncomplicated that other attorneys assigned the same task usually arrive\r\nat exactly opposite conclusions from those presented by the first corps!\r\n\r\nMr. Scott also informed us that when a white man marries an Indian woman\r\nin Canada, he has no part in tribal or individual property. The\r\nGovernment issues no deeds to the Indians, but they live on their farms\r\nas do ours. All incentive to graft is removed. The simple, effective\r\nCanadian management of Indian affairs, compared with our ponderous,\r\ncomplicated and ignorant handling of the same class of people in this\r\ncountry, points a very strong moral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEDAL PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT GRANT TO CHIEF RED CLOUD IN 1871\r\n\r\n  Secured from Mrs. Red Cloud and Jack Red Cloud for the Trustees of\r\n    Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass., in 1909, by W. K. Moorehead. Solid\r\n    silver. Full size.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf those who have done much on behalf of the Indian, I neglected to\r\nemphasize the work of Honorable James M. Graham, Congressman from\r\nIllinois, and Honorable Henry George, Jr., of New York.\r\n\r\nThese two gentlemen served on the Congressional Committee referred to in\r\nChapters IV-VIII. There were other members on this same Committee, who\r\ndid good work, but I believe Messrs. Graham and George were the only two\r\nwho attended all of the sessions. Omitting the members of Congress\r\nalready mentioned in the book, those who have been especially active in\r\nprotecting Indians are Honorable Senators LaFollette, Townsend, Ashurst,\r\nLane, Page and Gronna; and Honorable Congressmen Konop, Church,\r\nCampbell, McGuire, Miller, Lenroot, Murdock and Stevens (Nebraska).\r\n\r\nI have tried to indicate in a number of places in this book why so many\r\nof our Indian tribes are practically at a standstill, so far as progress\r\nalong lines of civilization is concerned. Put into one concrete\r\nstatement, the reason for the unsatisfactory condition of many of our\r\nIndians is due to the following:—First, we have hurried them into\r\ncitizenship before they were qualified to assume full responsibility.\r\nSecond, many of the farms and tracts improved by Indians, after much\r\nlabor, have been taken away.\r\n\r\nCertain of the missions were very successful, and numbers of them are so\r\nat the present day. The famous Riggs family of missionaries among the\r\nSioux, succeeded in building up communities of Christian Indians and\r\npromoting thrift and industry. Rev. Gilfillan’s missions in Minnesota,\r\nand the Catholic mission near Pine Ridge are illustrations of what can\r\nbe done with Indians when one has secured their confidence. So long as\r\nthere is no change in management, and the Indians are not hurried, much\r\nprogress on their part is sure to result. But, unfortunately, as has\r\nbeen indicated, we have no more than persuaded a band of Indians to\r\nbecome progressive than we destroy all incentive to further progress.\r\nThis was done in the case of the Pima and Papago, in addition to other\r\ntribes frequently mentioned. Indians develop farms and become\r\nself-supporting only to see the result of their labor swept away. Beyond\r\nquestion, we have hurried the Indian, and forced allotments and\r\ncitizenship upon him far too rapidly. We should have moved slowly, as\r\nthey do in Canada, and avoid the dreadful scandals and the increase of\r\ndisease and pauperism. The Indians are more or less confused by our\r\nnumerous rulings, changes of officials, etc. An Indian said to me in\r\nMinnesota: “We used to live in the open air and were healthy. You told\r\nus to live in houses. We became sick. Now you tell us to again live in\r\nthe open air. The white man has many minds.”\r\n\r\nThe old method of gradual extension of civilizing influences was\r\ngenerally successful. And, in all sections of the country where such a\r\nplan is followed, the Indians are doing quite well. Indians can be led,\r\nor persuaded, far more satisfactorily than driven. The Navaho have never\r\nbeen driven, but were permitted to slowly, yet satisfactorily, progress\r\nalong certain lines. An educated Indian once summed up to me our general\r\npolicy with reference to the average Indian in Oklahoma:—“You put a few\r\nwords of English in his mouth, a coat on his back, thrust a deed to\r\nvaluable property in his hands, and send him out among shrewder white\r\nmen, expecting him to hold his own.”\r\n\r\nEven the wildest Indians might have been led along the path to\r\ncivilization had we approached the subject in the proper manner. Setting\r\naside temporarily my rule not to refer to affairs prior to 1850, permit\r\nme to indicate what Rev. Zeisberger and Rev. Heckewelder accomplished in\r\nthe Ohio wilderness before the American Revolution. They established\r\nmissions on the Muskingum River and conducted these successfully, in\r\nspite of the fact that all the Ohio and Indiana Indians were at war with\r\nthe settlers of Kentucky, Virginia and Pennsylvania. These men dealt\r\nwith, and worked among, a class of Indians as hostile as many of those\r\nin the West. At the time the missions were destroyed by one Williamson\r\nand other white murderers, the chapels, houses, fenced fields, and other\r\nevidences of civilization were in advance of that exhibited in any white\r\ncommunity lying between central Pennsylvania and the Spanish missions.\r\nThe reason for the success of the Moravian mission lay in this fact:\r\nthat the missionaries were permitted to labor unhampered in a remote\r\nsection of the country, there were no white people near, no demoralizing\r\ninfluences. They did not force industry upon the natives suddenly, but\r\nby a slow and persistent policy of training and education, brought about\r\nthe desired result. With us, in these modern days, in far too many\r\nplaces, we have not only exhibited undue haste in preparing our Indians\r\nfor citizenship, but we have shown a general incompetence in managing\r\ntheir affairs.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another and equally important reason so many of our Indians\r\nare discouraged, or backward, or indolent. Most nations, or tribes of\r\nmen, learn the lessons of life in the hard school of adversity. The\r\nIndian had his school of adversity, but the curriculum was totally\r\ndifferent from that observed in any other institution of similar\r\ncharacter. He had, on the one hand what Mr. Humphrey has called “the\r\ngreat Unselfishness” (_page 375_), and on the other the exact opposite\r\nof “the great Unselfishness.” The “great Selfishness” destroyed the\r\nIndian—nothing else. The Indian found it exceedingly difficult to adapt\r\nhimself to the new conditions. Through education, he was able to fathom\r\nthe inconsistencies of the white man’s teachings and practices. Being\r\nhuman, he refused to develop his property, if by so doing he merely\r\nfattened the pocketbook of some covetous white man. His vast tribal\r\nestates furnished him with moneys at stated occasions, and, relying too\r\nmuch upon these, he drifted into indolent habits. The unlettered\r\naborigine, as well as the educated Indian, observed that we were\r\ncontinually concerned with the Indian rather than with white people\r\nresponsible for the Indians’ condition. This to them was inexplicable.\r\nThe illustration presented me on this score by a certain educated Indian\r\npresents the thought quite forcibly. “Suppose a ranchman owned a large\r\ntract of land on which grazed some thousands of sheep. Around his ranch\r\nranged hundreds of coyotes. The wolves frequently destroy the sheep. The\r\nranchman is continually changing the sheep from one pasture to another,\r\nin order to avoid the wolves. He devotes all his energies to the sheep,\r\ninstead of destroying the wolves.”\r\n\r\nConsider the whiskey problem, about which so much has been printed.\r\nThere are laws and regulations sufficient to control this evil. Yet\r\neveryone seems concerned in preventing Indians from drinking whiskey, or\r\narresting drunken Indians. So long as the State authorities do not\r\nenforce the laws against white men who introduce whiskey, it will be\r\nimpossible to prevent Indians from drinking. Equally applicable are the\r\nlaws against theft from Indians. In spite of all our investigations, few\r\nwhite men are ever sent to the penitentiary for swindling Indians. As in\r\nthe case of whiskey, there are ample laws for the protection of Indian\r\nproperty and the punishment of grafters, yet they are seldom enforced.\r\nHonorable William H. Taft, ex-President of the United States, has in his\r\npublic addresses frequently called attention to our lax enforcement of\r\nlaws and our apparent disrespect of the courts, as compared with the\r\nhigh regard in which the English hold their legal machinery, and the\r\nimpartial manner in which they administer justice.\r\n\r\nAll these things, in their ensemble, discourage the average Indian, just\r\nas they would affect the average white man. Prison sentences, instead of\r\nsmall fines, would put an end to graft and drunkenness, and would have a\r\nfar-reaching effect in raising the Indian to a real citizenship. We have\r\ntried moral suasion and it has failed absolutely. Let us now employ\r\nforce against the guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CHAPTER XL. CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn studying Indians, the scientist deals with facts. The historian is a\r\nscientist in that he records facts; the sociologists and persons\r\ninterested in political economy and government, draw conclusions from\r\nfacts. Manifestly, we should formulate our Indian policy upon scientific\r\nprinciples. We should be governed solely and absolutely by facts and\r\npast experiences. Yet, although our Government in all other branches of\r\nits great Service profits by human experience in our own country and\r\nelsewhere, in our handling of the Indian, it is safe to affirm that we\r\nhave not heeded the lessons of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Indian policy the past two or three years has appreciably changed\r\nfor the better. If the reforms instituted by Honorable Cato Sells can be\r\ncarried out as planned, we shall conserve much of the Indian property\r\nthat remains. The Indians still possess vast estates, and with economy\r\nand protection, there is sufficient land to care for all of them, save\r\non a few reservations. In Oklahoma and Minnesota it will be necessary to\r\neither buy farms, or permit Indians to continue as paupers, or move them\r\nto Montana, Idaho or Nevada. The great Navaho tract, including a portion\r\nof the Public Domain, is now crowded. There can be no further increase\r\nof Navaho population in the present area. Either the Indians must have\r\nmore land, or suffer. Omitting all other reservations and Indian areas,\r\nand classifying them as satisfactory (although some of them are not) the\r\nsituation confronting us today may be bluntly stated as follows:—You can\r\ntake no more land away from the Indians, unless you desire to make of\r\nthem paupers. You cannot expect them to hold their own with the white\r\npeople, unless you change their status from a paper citizenship to a\r\nreal citizenship. Making of them citizens, without the ordinary\r\nprotection enjoyed by other Americans, produces instead of citizens,\r\npaupers. The detailed evidence of this has been presented in previous\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nWe all admit that we owe the Indian much. Nobody denies that we have\r\ndone the individual Indian a service, through our education and\r\ncivilizing influences. Why, then, is it that there is not more land\r\nunder cultivation today than in 1871? Because of the conflicting rulings\r\nand laws, the breaking of treaties, the cancelling of agreements entered\r\ninto by States, and, finally, the taking of individual farms. This has\r\ndiscouraged the average Indian.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to be disloyal to my own Government, but I express the\r\nfirm conviction that our particular form of government is such that\r\nadministration of Indian Affairs is rendered extremely difficult. Put\r\nplainly (if not bluntly), our form of government is not conducive to\r\nsatisfactory management or supervision of a dependent people. The\r\nreason, as every thinking man and woman knows, is because we make the\r\nhigh office of Indian Affairs a political appointment. The Commissioner\r\nno more than learns his duties, and becomes competent and efficient,\r\nthan he is removed and another installed in his place. Since 1834 there\r\nhave been thirty-one Commissioners, and the average tenure of office is\r\na trifle over two and one-half years. The same is true of Indian\r\nSuperintendents—formerly called Agents. I never could understand why\r\nthey changed the name, for the Superintendent is still an Agent. I am\r\nperfectly willing to accept the shrewd Indian’s definition—“It is the\r\nsame man, only he wears a different coat.”\r\n\r\nThe frequent changes in the office of Commissioner has not worked to the\r\nadvantage of the Indians. Since 1907 we have had three Commissioners and\r\nan acting Commissioner—F. E. Leupp, R. G. Valentine, F. H. Abbott, and\r\nCato Sells. All of these men have been energetic and intelligent, as\r\nwere their predecessors, but they have been removed, or they resigned\r\nunder political pressure; and as a result those who are fighting for the\r\nIndians’ rights must go over the same old story, again and again, submit\r\nand resubmit the same evidence as one appointee succeeds another. This\r\nis even true of the Honorable Secretary of the Interior himself. As an\r\nillustration, I would cite the case of French-Canadians of northern\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nAfter the White Earth investigation, we begged Secretary Garfield to\r\nstrike from the White Earth rolls the French-Canadian element—headed by\r\none Gus H. Beaulieu. It was contended that those persons had come down\r\nfrom Canada and settled themselves on the Ojibwa, and were a continual\r\nsource of trouble. Enough evidence was presented to make our position\r\nimpregnable. Secretary Garfield hesitated to act, and passed the matter\r\nto his successor, Mr. Ballinger, who in turn transferred it to Mr.\r\nFisher, and it is now before Secretary Lane. If the Honorable Secretary,\r\nMr. Garfield, had acted in the first place heroically and promptly, he\r\nwould have placed the burden of proof on the shoulders of the\r\nFrench-Canadian element (where it properly belonged), and several pages\r\nof unpleasant American Indian history would not have been written.\r\n\r\nBe these things as they may, they exist, and until our Congress appoints\r\na national and paid commission to take over the entire Indian body and\r\ntheir property—so long as the Indian, and the Indian Office, remain\r\npolitical footballs, just so long will the games continue played in the\r\nold way, with no new rules, and since coaching from the side-lines is\r\npermitted, the strongest and the most brutal teams will win.\r\n\r\nThe freest and most varied opinions regarding Indian affairs are\r\nexpressed at the Lake Mohonk Conferences. I have referred to them\r\nelsewhere, but I desire to repeat that at the conferences, where\r\nhundreds of missionaries, philanthropists, sociologists, Government\r\nemployees and others assemble, we obtain the facts, hear\r\nrecommendations, and debate on the policy concerning our wards.\r\n\r\nThe addresses delivered at these remarkable gatherings carry great\r\nweight throughout the country, for the reason that those who address the\r\naudiences have made extended observations in various parts of the field.\r\nA summary of these many opinions delivered during the past five years,\r\nindicates one general trend of thought. And that is that the end of the\r\ntribal system among the Indians is not so much at hand, as already\r\naccomplished. It requires no prophetic vision to observe the setting of\r\nthe Indians’ sun. All agree to this general proposition. The many\r\nscientists of our research institutions, both large and small, are\r\nenergetically seeking out what little remains of tribal and aboriginal\r\ncustoms and beliefs. They know that in a few years it will be too late\r\nto make scientific researches among Indians. They employ patient search\r\nand much discrimination to here and there discover a smouldering ember\r\nof the ancient council fire. And, I think, it requires further energy\r\nand patience on the part of the ethnologists to fan the feeble ember\r\nuntil it bursts forth into flame!\r\n\r\nThe Government employee is pushing his educational problem, persuading\r\nmost of the Indians to work, and improving the daily life of these\r\npeople. The doctors and the field matrons use their best endeavor to\r\nestablish sanitary measures, and proper home life. The great Indian\r\nschools are discharging hundreds of competent graduates; the Congressmen\r\nare removing restrictions, according citizenship, selling surplus lands,\r\nand doing all that they can to hasten the end of the Indian as a\r\ndependent body. And last of all, comes the undesirable class—the grafter\r\nand the bootlegger—one taking away the Indian property in many sections\r\nof our country, and the other debauching all Indians who have not the\r\nmoral stamina to resist. The good people, and the majority, are\r\nuplifting, saving and preparing the Indian for citizenship. Working\r\ntogether, they are acting in the best interests of that great and new\r\nmovement, known as “Social Service.” Fighting against them is the\r\nundesirable element—that class responsible for the pauperizing of the\r\nIndians of Oklahoma, Minnesota, California and elsewhere. I have pointed\r\nout in previous chapters of this book both the good and the evil. The\r\nreal workers—whether in the Government Service, employed by missions,\r\nmembers of philanthropic organizations, state officials, or private\r\ncitizens—are doing their part. We may criticize some of their rulings or\r\nmethods of procedure, for we all make mistakes, and no man or woman\r\nengaged in the real work of the world can avoid error. Frequently we\r\nmake enemies—particularly so if we stand up for the rights of the\r\nIndian. But while this is true, the general trend is in favor of just\r\ntreatment of the Indian, and the great object in view is his absorption\r\ninto the body politic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MISS KATE BARNARD, OF OKLAHOMA. See pages 137, 150, and 170\r\n\r\n  She is waging battle for the protection of Indian minors and orphans.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhether this shall be accomplished depends entirely upon the relative\r\nstrength between those who build up, and those who destroy. The issue is\r\nbetween the grafter and bootlegger, and the respectable citizen. The\r\ngreat Navaho is as yet unspoiled. The Sioux, the Apache, the Crow and\r\nothers are doing very well. If we permit foolish or unwise legislation\r\nto dominate in the region inhabited by the tribes I have named, we shall\r\ndestroy the best of that which is left, even as we have destroyed in\r\nOklahoma and Minnesota. I have clearly pointed out the high character of\r\nthe Ojibwa and the Five Civilized Tribes forty years ago as compared\r\nwith the present, and that the responsibility for this decline rests\r\nwith us, rather than with the Indians themselves, or the Indian Office.\r\n\r\nSince 1834, we have gone on in a well-meaning but stupid and blundering\r\nway. We have persuaded scores of bands to take the white man’s road, and\r\nby foolish legislation, wars, the crowding by Whites, etc., destroyed\r\ntheir original confidence in us. As if these were not sufficient, in the\r\ngreat State of Oklahoma, where one-third of the entire Indian body is\r\nlocated, we have had brought before us through reports of Commissions\r\nand individuals and a cloud of witnesses, the result of our policy. In\r\nspite of this, we have recently deliberately removed, or forced to\r\nresign, some of the persons most competent and longest in the Service in\r\nthat State—Messrs. Mott, Gresham, Frost, Kelsey and Wright. What was the\r\nreal reason? Did the great majority of citizens of Oklahoma—the\r\nlaw-abiding and upright—desire that faithful servants, who understood\r\ntheir duties, should be forced out? No! Because a relatively small\r\nnumber of oil, coal, land, timber and stock men wished to become rich.\r\nPublic sentiment through the newspapers has been influenced, persons who\r\nwere not interested in politics have been accused of the very thing\r\nwhich dominated their accusers. Politics is at the bottom of it all.\r\n\r\nThe agitation in Oklahoma, begun by the small coterie referred to, and,\r\nat the insistence of interested persons and newspapers, and not\r\nprevented by Congressmen from that State, has resulted in the present\r\nremoval from office of the men best able to protect the Indians. Does\r\nall of this indicate that the Commissioner, Mr. Sells, will not protect\r\nthe Indians? By no means. As I have said, he and his able assistant, Mr.\r\nMeritt, and all the officials are honorable and upright men. But they\r\ncannot stand against the wishes of Congress. The Congressmen are all\r\nhonest and upright in their intentions—although two or three of them are\r\non record as dealing in Indian lands—but they are compelled to act in\r\naccordance with the desires of their constituents. Witness the statement\r\nthat the candidates for office, with very few exceptions, ran on the\r\nplatform that all restrictions were to be removed and federal safeguards\r\nwithdrawn (_pages 139 and 144_.)\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner, although he may prepare a method of procedure for the\r\nJudges handling Indian cases in the Probate Court (as Mr. Sells has\r\ndone), is really powerless, if Congress decides to remove the few\r\nremaining safeguards in Oklahoma, or to divide up any other reservation.\r\nAll Commissioners have said practically the same thing: that they stood\r\nback of the Indian, protected his rights, were in favor of progress and\r\neducation, etc., etc. Statements embodying this sentiment are found in\r\nevery public address of the various Commissioners during thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner may spend years in upbuilding industry among a certain\r\nband of Indians. The moment the reservation is thrown open to\r\nsettlement, most of the Indians are speedily dispossessed. If he desires\r\nto protect the water rights of the Pimas and the white people living\r\nalong the Gila River wash the water, all the Inspector’s reports, and\r\nall the Commissioner’s speeches, and all the Agent’s protests, are in\r\nvain. The Congressmen from any of the affected districts must agree with\r\ntheir constituents, else they will be defeated at the next election.\r\nThere are many exceptions, such as Honorable W. N. Murray of Oklahoma,\r\nHonorable Charles H. Burke of South Dakota, Honorable James M. Graham\r\nand others, who have, in spite of popular clamor, stood for the rights\r\nof the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe lack of true publicity in Indian Affairs, is also a factor working\r\npowerfully against the Indian. Between 1900 and 1909 we were given the\r\nimpression that the Indian generally in the United States was in\r\nsplendid condition. This had a very evil effect, in that there was no\r\npublic agitation outside of the Indian Rights and the California Indian\r\nAssociations for protection. The very best thing that ever happened to\r\nthe Indian was the making public of dreadful conditions in California,\r\nMinnesota, Arizona, and Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis aroused both the officials and Congress. Victor Locke, Chief of the\r\nChoctaws, said regarding the Oklahoma exposé:—“The very day after\r\nCommissioner Moorehead’s report was made public, I saw one of the county\r\njudges in the Choctaw country going from a printing-office with 750\r\nprinted notices to guardians with respect to settlement with their\r\nIndian wards.”\r\n\r\nIf we had such publicity applied to every reservation, while it would be\r\nunpleasant, the taxpayers of the United States would soon realize that,\r\nunless our policy is radically changed, they will be called upon to\r\nsupport a vast number of homeless paupers. Beyond question, either the\r\nnation, or the respective States, will soon assume this burden. I desire\r\nto go on record as making this prophecy.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete illustration of how those high in authority have misled\r\nthe public, I desire to state that Honorable James S. Sherman,\r\nVice-President of the United States, and for some years Chairman of the\r\nHouse Committee on Indian Affairs, in a public address before the Lake\r\nMohonk Conference in October, 1911, stated that the United States\r\nGovernment had kept all its treaties and obligations with the Indians.\r\nRespect for the high office he occupied, prevented anyone replying to\r\nthis amazing and preposterous utterance. The audience was composed of\r\n400 or more persons of prominence, and Mr. Sherman’s address was\r\nreported in many newspapers, with the result that the average reader\r\nnaturally concluded that those who were seeking to better the condition\r\nof the Indians were sentimentalists, and that the Government had done\r\nits full duty. If the Committee of which he was chairman took that view,\r\nwe have the explanation of many of the evils of the past fifteen years.\r\nFor every agreement or promise, faithfully kept by the Government, I can\r\ncite a score which the authorities either ignored or made no effort to\r\nfulfill.\r\n\r\n“The treaties with the Indians have been gathered and published in a\r\nsingle volume. It may be said with confidence, that leaving out the\r\nmerely formal ratifications of existing friendly relations, there is not\r\none treaty that was negotiated in good faith by the United States.”\r\n\r\nAs the final proofs of this chapter were struck, the announcement came\r\nfrom Washington to the effect that the Honorable Secretary of the\r\nInterior intended to grant the Indians more freedom. In Mr. Lane’s\r\nreport, just issued, he takes the position that as many of our Indians\r\nare intelligent, the Government should hasten the day of removal of\r\nrestrictions, or withdrawal of supervision over individual Indians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHIEF PEO-PEO-TOLEKT. NEZ PERCE WARRIOR. CHIEF JOSEPH’S WAR, 1877\r\n\r\n  Photographed and copyrighted by L. V. McWhorter, 1911\r\n]\r\n\r\nA careful study of the field, indicates that somewhere between one-third\r\nand one-half of our Indians might be immediately merged into the body\r\npolitic. As against this statement, the evidence is indisputable that\r\nthe remaining two-thirds (or one-half) if made free, in the full sense\r\nthat term implies, will be in the same condition as the Indians of\r\nCalifornia, Minnesota, and Oklahoma. If all of our Indians were made\r\nfree, and permitted to progress as the Cherokees did, prior to their\r\nremoval west of the Mississippi, and until about the year 1900 in the\r\nState of Oklahoma, the Secretary’s plan would succeed. But so long as\r\nthe white people discriminate against Indian citizens, and the\r\ncitizenship of the Indian is different from that enjoyed by ourselves,\r\nthe setting free of all our Indians at this time will end in certain\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n               TWO PLANS FOR INDIAN ADMINISTRATION REFORM\r\n\r\nOn page 26 I have referred to the great and efficient machinery of the\r\nUnited States Indian Office. This tremendous institution is composed of\r\nmany and complicated parts, and they run smoothly. Frequently certain\r\nparts are replaced. But is this great machine operated in the best\r\ninterests of the Indian and of the public? The brain responsible for the\r\nguidance, or management of this plant, and the officers in charge of its\r\nvarious Departments desire to produce a finished product of real value\r\nto the world. How can they do so when they must needs change their\r\noperation often, not in the real interests of a finished product, but\r\nbecause of political expediency?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there are two, and only two ways, by which we may solve\r\nsatisfactorily the Indian problem. Granted that a proper man is secured\r\nto occupy the position of Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that man\r\nshould remain in office ten or fifteen years. England seldom makes\r\nmistakes in her management of a dependent people. When a good man is\r\nfound, he is continued in office until he understands his people\r\nthoroughly. With us the reverse is true. The Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs has no real advisory body with whom to consult, except the\r\ncommittees in Congress. Naturally, more or less politics creep into the\r\nOffice through such arrangement. Thirty years ago the United States\r\nBoard of Indian Commissioners consulted and advised with the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs. There is no reason why such a sensible\r\narrangement is not carried into effect today. If the Board stood between\r\nthe Commissioner and the Congressional Committees, a Commissioner would\r\nnot be forced to accept decisions which he believed were inimical to the\r\nbest interests of the Indians. Assuming that the Commissioner was\r\ncontinued in office ten or fifteen years, and that the Board frequently\r\nmet with him, unwise legislative acts would not be common—as at present.\r\n\r\nWhile the first suggestion has its merits, it seems to me that the plan\r\nproposed in the Lake Mohonk platform October, 1913, presents the most\r\npractical solution of the Indian problem. One of the speakers advocated\r\na paid National Commission to take the place of the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs and the Board of Indian Commissioners. In view of the\r\nfact that the welfare of 330,000 human beings and $1,200,000,000 worth\r\nof property are involved, he proposed the National Commission idea. This\r\nhas caused considerable discussion. Some critics contended that nine\r\nwere too many, that the Commission should be composed of seven. Others\r\nthought that five would be sufficient. Honorable Senator Joe Robinson of\r\nArkansas, last winter, having heard of the Mohonk platform, introduced a\r\nbill appointing a Commission of three. Mr. Sells and Mr. Meritt were to\r\nbe two of the Commissioners, and some one else would be selected as\r\nthird member. This would not solve the problem, since such a commission\r\nwould be political—although the members were all personally above\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Indian Commissioners, serving in honorary capacity, cannot\r\ndevote sufficient time for investigation of conditions on the\r\nreservations, and in Indian communities. Its members are all exceedingly\r\nbusy men. They have given much time, in spite of their other callings,\r\nto the work, as I have indicated in previous pages.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner himself, able though he be, in my humble opinion is\r\nbeset by political considerations—which is no fault of his own.\r\n\r\nA high Commission in charge of our Philippine affairs with the work\r\ndifferentiated, and responsibilities placed upon each Commissioner, has\r\nresulted in a development of the Islands which has attracted the\r\nattention of the world during the brief period since the Spanish War. A\r\nsimilar commission of men of recognized qualifications, is entirely\r\npracticable in Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Mohonk recommendation is absolutely sound. The seven men would\r\ndivide the work between them, one having charge of education, another of\r\nhealth, a third of citizenship, a fourth irrigation, a fifth finance—and\r\nso on through the list. Having assumed control, the office of\r\nCommissioner and that of the honorary Board would be abolished. The\r\nhearings of this Commission would be open, quarterly reports would be\r\npublished, and its findings made public. Its first duty would be to\r\ncompile a roll, based on ethnological lines, of the full-blood and\r\nmixed-blood Indians. All competent educated Indians could be immediately\r\neliminated from Government supervision. They would thus become citizens\r\nand cease to be included in the Indian body. The property of every\r\nignorant full-blood, minor child, or incompetent would be restricted for\r\ntwenty-five years, thus enabling all Indians to have reached adult age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: © _by Rodman Wanamaker 1913_ _The Fading Sunset_]\r\n\r\nWe owe it to the American Indian that the Commission idea be carried\r\ninto effect. Politics would not interfere with the Commission, for the\r\nreason that its public hearings would be reported in the papers, the\r\ngood citizens, as well as the undesirable class, would either attend the\r\nhearings or familiarize themselves with the quarterly reports. Thus a\r\ngeneral steal would be impossible. A single Commissioner cannot make all\r\nof his business public, and much that he does never reaches the light of\r\npublicity. In fact, I believe that because the Commissioner cannot take\r\nthe public into his confidence, abuses are bound to occur. Often it\r\nremains for the Indian Rights Association, or other organizations, to\r\nappeal to the public and do that which the Indian Office should\r\nestablish without outside influence. There would be far less incentive\r\nto dishonesty, were covetous white men compelled to deal with a\r\nCommission instead of an individual. The publication of the Board’s\r\nhearings and findings would have a deterrent effect on certain men who\r\notherwise appeal to Senators or Congressmen.\r\n\r\nI have often contrasted the work of Dr. W. T. Grenfell in Labrador with\r\nthat of organizations laboring among our Indians. We are not responsible\r\nfor the condition of the fishermen in Labrador, and they are numerically\r\nbut a fraction as compared with our total Indian population. Yet Dr.\r\nGrenfell, through his lectures and publications has aroused such an\r\ninterest in this country that he can collect for his Labrador work a sum\r\nfar greater than that expended in support of six Indian missions. People\r\nare interested in him and his work because of the appeal he makes. The\r\nLabrador fishermen suffer no wrongs compared with our Indians, and their\r\ncondition is far better than that of the average aborigine. Similar\r\npublicity given to Indian affairs through the reports and hearings of a\r\nNational Commission, would arouse the American people, and a brighter\r\nday for the Indian would certainly dawn.\r\n\r\nNo matter what is said, the Commissioner must fight alone and\r\nsingle-handed with the members of Congress. His is a great\r\nresponsibility. Both Mr. Leupp and Mr. Valentine, in conversations with\r\nme, have admitted that the chief difficulty in handling the Indian\r\nproblem is found in the word “politics”. The Commissioner is dependent\r\non Congress for his appropriations. He may be sustained or opposed by\r\nmembers of Congress, and the public will remain in ignorance. He may not\r\nappeal save to the Secretary of the Interior. He must keep in mind the\r\nwishes of his political party. He will not admit political pressure when\r\nin office, but after leaving the Service, he may tell his story of\r\ntrouble with politicians, as Mr. Leupp has in his book. Mr. Valentine\r\ncould enlighten us further on “The Indian Office in Politics”, did he\r\ncare to speak. A paid National Commission would be dominated by _no_\r\npolitical party. Ten years’ service would enable it to become entirely\r\nfamiliar with the needs of the Indians, whereas the average\r\nCommissioner, serving less than three years, barely becomes acquainted\r\nwith the problem when he is succeeded by a new appointee.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the earnest consideration of the American people the\r\nCommission idea, as the only means of salvation of the American Indian.\r\nIt will be said by critics that many of the tribes are making\r\nsatisfactory progress and need no Commission; that the present\r\norganization of the Indian Office is sufficient. This is partly true,\r\nbut a study of the table of statistics, and reference to the testimony\r\nsubmitted in this book, establishes the sad fact, that the majority of\r\nthe Indians must lose unless we make a radical change in our policy. It\r\nis useless to blind our eyes to hard facts; and these are that we\r\ndevelop a certain area after painstaking labor, and then through unwise\r\nacts (or legislation) we destroy the very tracts we have improved.\r\n\r\nThe Indian must ultimately be merged into the body politic, as has been\r\naffirmed. But in bringing about this desideratum, it is not necessary to\r\ncrush all happiness out of his life. For fifty years the Indian has\r\nfollowed a devious and uncertain trail, in the fond hope that he might\r\nreach his journey’s end. If men and women, who through unintentional\r\nignorance have given no heed to the welfare of our red Americans, will\r\ninterest their Representatives in Congress, and also help to crystallize\r\npublic opinion against further harmful legislation, it is quite possible\r\nthat the National Commission plan may be carried into effect. After many\r\nyears of study of the subject, I firmly believe that the welfare of the\r\nIndian depends upon the creation of such a Commission as has been\r\nindicated—one composed not of those interested in political parties, but\r\non the contrary of competent men who understand Indians and their needs,\r\nof men who are willing to devote the best years of their lives to\r\ntransforming the rough, uncertain trail along which the Indian has\r\ntoiled, into a broad highway, upon which the Red Man may safely travel\r\nto his ultimate destination—the civilized community. And having reached\r\nthe end of his journey, the Indian will live henceforth peacefully, and\r\nenjoy to the full the blessings of liberty, equality and justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abbott, F.H., 13, 242, 247, 248, 291, 359, 384, 424.\r\n\r\n Affidavits, 71, 74, 75, 77, 81, 82, 83, 84, 90, 91.\r\n\r\n Agricultural lands cultivated, 24, 27, 29, 66.\r\n\r\n Ah-bow-we-ge-shig, 93, 94.\r\n\r\n Ali-yah-baince, 81.\r\n\r\n Alabama, 33.\r\n\r\n Alaska Indians, 283.\r\n\r\n Allen, Edgar A., 13, 204.\r\n\r\n Allen, C.
