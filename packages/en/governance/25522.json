I am greatly indebted to the\r\nEditor of that paper for his courteous and ready permission to reprint\r\nthem. The \"Freedom\" dealt with in these essays is political freedom, and\r\nthe \"Service\" advocated is universal military service. These limitations\r\nare due to the fact that the original newspaper articles were\r\ncontributions to the controversy respecting methods of enlistment which\r\ntook place during the autumn of 1915.\r\n\r\nThe remaining three essays appear now for the first time. They have a\r\nmore general scope, although they are vitally connected with the theme\r\nof their predecessors. The essay on Passive Resistance has special\r\nreference to the opposition offered by the No-Conscription Fellowship to\r\nthe principle of compulsory military service; but its argument applies\r\nequally well to the older antagonists of the authority of the State.\r\nThe essay on Christianity and War tries to meet those conscientious\r\nobjections to military service which form the basis of the propaganda of\r\nthe Fellowship of Reconciliation; but it deals with the problem in the\r\nbroadest manner possible within the limits of its space. The concluding\r\nessay, on the State and its Rivals, emphasizes the imperative need that\r\nthe authority of the Democratic National State should be recognized and\r\naccepted if internal anarchy is to be avoided, and if the peace and\r\nwell-being of the World are to be secured.\r\n\r\n                                                 F.

UNIVERSAL OBLIGATION TO SERVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The military system of the Anglo-Saxons is based upon universal\r\nservice, under which is to be understood the duty of every freeman to\r\nrespond in person to the summons to arms, to equip himself at his own\r\nexpense, and to support himself at his own charge during the\r\ncampaign.\"[2]\r\n\r\nWith these words Gneist, the German historian of the English\r\nConstitution, begins his account of the early military system of our\r\nancestors. He is, of course, merely stating a matter of common knowledge\r\nto all students of Teutonic institutions. What he says of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon is equally true of the Franks, the Lombards, the Visigoths,\r\nand other kindred peoples.[3] But it is a matter of such fundamental\r\nimportance that I will venture, even at the risk of tedious repetition,\r\nto give three parallel quotations from English authorities. Grose, in\r\nhis _Military Antiquities_, says: \"By the Saxon laws every freeman of an\r\nage capable of bearing arms, and not incapacitated by any bodily\r\ninfirmity, was in case of a foreign invasion, internal insurrection, or\r\nother emergency obliged to join the army.\"[4] Freeman, in his _Norman\r\nConquest_, speaks of \"the right and duty of every free Englishman to be\r\nready for the defence of the Commonwealth with arms befitting his own\r\ndegree in the Commonwealth.\"[5] Finally, Stubbs, in his _Constitutional\r\nHistory_, clearly states the case in the words: \"The host was originally\r\nthe people in arms, the whole free population, whether landowners or\r\ndependents, their sons, servants, and tenants. Military service was a\r\npersonal obligation ... the obligation of freedom\"; and again: \"Every\r\nman who was in the King's peace was liable to be summoned to the host at\r\nthe King's call.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThere is no ambiguity or uncertainty about these pronouncements. The Old\r\nEnglish \"fyrd,\" or militia, was the nation in arms. The obligation to\r\nserve was a personal one. It had no relation to the possession of land;\r\nin fact it dated back to an age in which the folk was still migratory\r\nand without a fixed territory at all. It was incumbent upon all\r\nable-bodied males between the ages of sixteen and sixty. Failure to obey\r\nthe summons was punished by a heavy fine known as \"fyrdwite.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThere is another point of prime significance. Universal service was, it\r\nis true, an obligation. But it was more: it was the _mark of freedom_.\r\nNot to be summoned stamped a man as a slave, a serf, or an alien. The\r\nfamous \"Assize of Arms\" ends with the words: \"_Et praecepit rex quod\r\nnullus reciperetur ad sacramentum armorum nisi liber homo._\"[8] A\r\nsummons was a right quite as much as a duty. The English were a brave\r\nand martial race, proud of their ancestral liberty. Not to be called to\r\ndefend it when it was endangered, not to be allowed to carry arms to\r\nmaintain the integrity of the fatherland, was a degradation which\r\nbranded a man as unfree.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This chapter has been issued as a pamphlet by the National Service\r\nLeague, 72, Victoria Street, S.W.\r\n\r\n[2] Gneist, R. _Englische Verfassungsgeschichte_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[3] Cf. the Frankish Edict of A.D. 864: \"Ad defensionem patriæ omnes\r\nsine ulla excusatione veniant.\" (Let all without any excuse come for the\r\ndefence of the fatherland.)\r\n\r\n[4] Grose, F. _Military Antiquities_, vol. i, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[5] Freeman, E. _Norman Conquest_, vol. iv, p. 681.\r\n\r\n[6] Stubbs, W. _Const.

THE OLD ENGLISH MILITIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThis primitive national militia was not, it must be admitted, a very\r\nefficient force. It lacked coherence and training; it was deficient both\r\nin arms and in discipline; it could not be kept together for long\r\ncampaigns. The Kings, therefore, from the first supplemented it by means\r\nof a band of personal followers, a bodyguard of professional warriors,\r\nwell and uniformly armed, and practised in the art of war. Nevertheless,\r\nthe main defence of the country rested with the \"fyrd.\" The Danish\r\ninvasions put it to the severest test and revealed its military defects.\r\nIt was one of the most notable achievements of Alfred to reorganize and\r\nreconstitute it. Thus reformed, with the support of an ever-growing body\r\nof King's thegns, it wrought great deeds in the days of Alfred, Edward\r\nand Athelstan, and recovered for England security and peace. In the days\r\nof their weaker successors, however, all the forces that England could\r\nmuster failed to keep out Sweyn and Canute, and, above all, failed to\r\nhold the field at Hastings.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest might have been expected to involve the extinction\r\nof the English militia. For feudalism as developed by William I was\r\nstrongest on its military side, and William's main force was the levy of\r\nhis feudal tenants. But quite the contrary happened. The Norman monarchs\r\nand their Angevin successors were, as a matter of fact, mortally afraid\r\nof their great feudal tenants, the barons and knights through whom the\r\nConquest had been effected. Hence, as English kings, they assiduously\r\nmaintained and fostered Anglo-Saxon institutions, and particularly the\r\n\"fyrd,\" which they used as a counterpoise to the feudal levy. They even\r\ncalled upon it for Continental service and took it across the Channel to\r\ndefend their French provinces.[9] Thus in 1073 it fought for William I\r\nin Maine; in 1094 William II summoned it to Hastings for an expedition\r\ninto Normandy; in 1102 it aided Henry I to suppress the formidable\r\nrevolt of Robert of Belesme, Earl of Shrewsbury; in 1138 it drove back\r\nthe Scots at the Battle of the Standard; and in 1174 it defeated and\r\ncaptured William the Lion at Alnwick. So valuable, indeed, did it prove\r\nto be that Henry II resolved to place it upon a permanent footing and\r\nclearly to define its position. With that view he issued in 1181 his\r\n\"Assize of Arms.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[9] Stubbs, W. _Select Charters_, p. 83; and _Const. Hist._, vol. i, p.\r\n469.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. MEDIÆVAL REGULATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nInto the details of the \"Assize of Arms\" it is unnecessary here to\r\nenter. Are they not written in every advanced text-book of English\r\nhistory? Three things, however, are to be noted. First, that the duty\r\nand privilege of military service are still bound up with freedom; no\r\nunfree man is to be admitted to the oath of arms. Secondly, that upon\r\nfreemen the obligation is still universal: \"all burgesses and the whole\r\ncommunity of freemen (_tota communa liberorum hominum_) are to provide\r\nthemselves with doublets, iron skullcaps, and lances.\" Thirdly, that,\r\nclosely as freedom had during the centuries of feudalism become\r\nassociated with tenancy of land, the national militia had not been\r\ninvolved in feudal meshes: the obligation of service remained still\r\npersonal, not territorial.\r\n\r\nIn 1205 John, fearing an invasion of the Kingdom, called to arms all the\r\nmilitia sworn and equipped under the Assize, _i.e._, all the freemen of\r\nthe realm. Short-shrift was to be given to any who disobeyed the\r\nsummons: \"_Qui vero ad summonitionem non venerit habeatur pro capitali\r\ninimico domini regis et regni_\" (He who does not come in response to the\r\nsummons shall be regarded as a capital enemy of the king and kingdom.)\r\nThe penalty was to be the peculiarly appropriate one of reduction to\r\nperpetual servitude. The disobedient and disloyal subject who made the\r\ngreat refusal would _ipso facto_ divest himself of the distinguishing\r\nmark of his freedom.[10]\r\n\r\nHenry III in 1223 and 1231 made similar levies. In 1252, in a notable\r\nwrit for enforcing Watch and Ward and the Assize of Arms, he extended\r\nthe obligation of service to villans and lowered the age limit to\r\nfifteen. Edward I reaffirmed these new departures in his well-known\r\nStatute of Winchester (1285), in which it is enacted that \"every man\r\nhave in his house harness for to keep the peace after the ancient\r\nassize, that is to say, every man between fifteen years of age and sixty\r\nyears.\" Further, he enlarged the armoury of the militiaman by including\r\namong his weapons the axe and the bow.[11]\r\n\r\nThe long, aggressive wars of Edward I in Wales and Scotland, and the\r\nstill longer struggles of the fourteenth century in France, could not,\r\nof course, be waged by means of the national militia. Even the feudal\r\nlevy was unsuited to their requirements. They were waged mainly by means\r\nof hired professional armies. Parliament--a new factor in the\r\nConstitution--took pains in these circumstances to limit by statute the\r\nliabilities of the old national forces. An Act of 1328 decreed that no\r\none should be compelled to go beyond the bounds of his own county,\r\nexcept when necessity or a sudden irruption of foreign foes into the\r\nrealm required it.[12] Another Act, 1352, provided that the militia\r\nshould not be compelled to go beyond the realm in any circumstances\r\nwhatsoever without the consent of Parliament.[13] Both these Acts were\r\nconfirmed by Henry IV in 1402.[14] But the old obligation of universal\r\nservice for home defence remained intact. It was, in fact, enforced by\r\nEdward IV in 1464, when, on his own authority, he ordered the Sheriffs\r\nto proclaim that \"every man from sixteen to sixty be well and defensibly\r\narrayed and ... be ready to attend on his Highness upon a day's warning\r\nin resistance of his enemies and rebels and the defence of this his\r\nrealm.\"[15] This notable incident carries us to the end of the Middle\r\nAges, and shows us the Old English principle in vigorous operation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Gervase of Canterbury. _Gesta Regum_, vol. ii, p. 97.\r\n\r\n[11] _Statutes of the Realm_, vol. i, pp. 96-8.\r\n\r\n[12] 1 Ed.

TUDOR AND STUART DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wars of the Roses, so fatal to the feudal nobility, left the\r\nnational militia the only organized force in the country. The Tudor\r\nperiod, it is true, saw the faint foreshadowing of a regular army in\r\nHenry VII's Yeomen of the Guard, and the nucleus of a volunteer force in\r\nthe Honourable Artillery Company, established in London under Henry\r\nVIII. But these at the time had little military importance, and England\r\nremained dependent for her defence throughout the sixteenth century,\r\nthat age of unprecedented prosperity and glory, upon her militant\r\nmanhood. Hence the Tudor monarchs paid great attention to the\r\nmaintenance and equipment of the militia. The practice (which had grown\r\nup in the later Middle Ages) of limiting the normal call to arms to a\r\ncertain quota of men from each county was revived. If the required\r\nnumbers were not forthcoming compulsion was employed. Statutes were\r\npassed making discipline more rigid. Lords Lieutenant were instituted to\r\ntake over the command, with added powers, from the Sheriffs. An\r\nimportant Mustering Statute (1557) was enacted, graduating afresh the\r\nuniversal liability to service, and making new provision for weapons and\r\norganization.[16] William Harrison, writing in 1587, said: \"As for able\r\nmen for service, thanked be God! we are not without good store; for by\r\nthe musters taken 1574-5 our numbers amounted to 1,172,674, and yet were\r\nthey not so narrowly taken but that a third part of this like multitude\r\nwas left unbilled and uncalled.\"[17] This from a population estimated at\r\nless than six million all told! Such was the host on which England\r\nrelied for safety in 1588, if by chance the galleons of Spain should\r\nelude the vigilance of Drake and should land Parma's hordes upon our\r\nshores. Well might the country feel at ease behind such a fleet and with\r\nsuch a virile race of men to second it.\r\n\r\nThe Stuarts did not take kindly to the English militia. It was too\r\ndemocratic, too free. James I, in the very first year of his reign,\r\nconferred upon its members the seductive but fatal gift of exemption\r\nfrom the burden of providing their own weapons.[18] As he himself took\r\ncare not to provide them too profusely, the force speedily lost both in\r\nefficiency and independence. The Civil War hopelessly divided it, as it\r\ndid the nation, into hostile factions. The Royalist section was\r\nultimately crushed, while the Parliamentary section was gradually\r\nabsorbed into that first great standing army which this country ever\r\nknew, the New Model of 1645. For fifteen years the people groaned under\r\nthe dominance of this arbitrary, conscientious, and very expensive\r\nforce. Then, in 1660, came the Restoration, and with it the disbanding\r\nof the New Model and the re-establishment of the militia. The country\r\nwent wild with joy at the recovery of its freedom.\r\n\r\nCharles II, however, was bent on securing for his own despotic purposes\r\na standing army. Hence he obtained permission from Parliament to have a\r\npermanent bodyguard, and he gradually increased its numbers until he had\r\nsome 6,000 troops regularly under his command. James II increased them\r\nto 15,000, and by their means tried to overthrow the religion and the\r\nliberties of the nation. He was defeated and driven out; but his effort\r\nto establish a military despotism made the name of \"standing army\" stink\r\nin the nostrils of the nation. \"It is indeed impossible,\" said one of\r\nthe leading statesmen of the early eighteenth century, \"that the\r\nliberties of the people can be preserved in any country where a numerous\r\nstanding army is kept up.\"[19] The national militia continued, as of\r\nold, to stand for freedom and self-government. The voluntarily enlisted\r\nstanding army was regarded as the engine and emblem of tyranny.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] 4-5 P. and M., c. 2.\r\n\r\n[17] Harrison, W. _Elizabethan England_, chap. xxii.\r\n\r\n[18] 1 Jac. I, c. 25.\r\n\r\n[19] Speech by Pulteney, A.D. 1732: See _Parl. Hist._, vol. viii, p.\r\n904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE LAST TWO CENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century saw a constant struggle on the part of\r\nconstitutionalists to get rid of the standing army altogether. Army\r\nActs, which recognized and regulated the new force, were limited in\r\ntheir operation to a year at a time, and were passed under incessant\r\nprotest. Grants to maintain the army were similarly restricted. Every\r\ninterval of peace witnessed the rapid reduction of the regulars. But the\r\ntimes were adverse. Wars were frequent, and on an ever-increasing scale\r\nof magnitude and duration. The standing army had to be maintained, and,\r\nindeed, steadily enlarged.\r\n\r\nBut the militia for home defence was never allowed to become extinct,\r\nand it enjoyed an immense popularity. In 1757 it was carefully\r\nreorganized by statute.[20] The number of men to be raised was settled,\r\nand each district was compelled to provide a certain proportion. The\r\nselection was to be made by ballot, to the complete exclusion of the\r\nvoluntary principle. During the Napoleonic war, when invasion seemed\r\nimminent, the militia was several times called out and embodied. In 1803\r\nan actual levy _en masse_ of all men between the ages of seventeen and\r\nfifty-five was made. In 1806 the principle of universal obligation on\r\nwhich it was based was clearly stated by Castlereagh in the House of\r\nCommons. He spoke of \"the undoubted prerogative of the Crown to call\r\nupon the services of all liege subjects in case of invasion.\"[21]\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he spoke, however, the imminent fear of invasion had\r\nbeen removed--removed, indeed, for a century--by Nelson's crowning\r\nvictory at Trafalgar. From that time forward the military forces of the\r\nCrown were required not so much for the defence of the United Kingdom\r\nitself as for the provision of garrisons for the vast Empire which had\r\ngrown up during the eighteenth century. These imperial garrisons had\r\nnecessarily to be drawn from professional troops voluntarily enlisted.\r\nThus the militia declined. An effort was made in 1852 to revive it, and\r\nagain the underlying principle of compulsion was explicitly recognized.\r\nThe Militia Act of that year[22] contains the provision: \"In case it\r\nappears to H.M. ---- that the number of men required ... cannot be raised\r\nby voluntary enlistment ... or in case of actual invasion or imminent\r\ndanger thereof, it shall be lawful for H.M. ---- to order and direct\r\nthat the number of men so required ... shall be raised by ballot as\r\nherein provided.\" The effort at revival was unfortunately vain, and when\r\nin 1859 international trouble again seemed to be brewing, instead of\r\nappealing once more to the immemorial defence of the country, the\r\nGovernment weakly and with most deplorable results allowed the formation\r\nof a new body, the volunteers--a body whose patriotism was noble, whose\r\nintentions were admirable, but whose inefficiency became and remained a\r\nbyword.[23] The militia continued ingloriously, mainly as a nursery for\r\nthe regular army.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1908, Mr. (now Lord) Haldane absorbed both volunteers and\r\nmilitia into the new Territorial and Reserve Forces, the militia\r\nbecoming a Special Reserve.[24] It is much to be regretted that the Act\r\nof 1908 did not expressly reaffirm the continued validity of the\r\ncompulsory principle of service which from the earliest times had been\r\nthe basis of the militia. But, though it did not expressly reaffirm it,\r\nit left it absolutely unimpaired and intact. Said Mr. Haldane himself in\r\nthe House of Commons on April 13th, 1910: \"The Militia Ballot Acts and\r\nthe Acts relating to the local militia are still unrepealed, and could\r\nbe enforced if necessary.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] 31 Geo.

The principle of\r\ncompulsory military service, obligatory upon every able-bodied male\r\nbetween the ages of sixteen and sixty, is still the fundamental\r\nprinciple of English Law, both Common Law and Statute Law. It has been\r\nobscured by the pernicious voluntary principle, which, in the\r\nmuch-abused name of Liberty, has shifted a universal national duty upon\r\nthe shoulders of the patriotic few. But it has never been revoked or\r\nrepudiated.\r\n\r\nIt is not National Service, but the Voluntary System, that is\r\nun-English and unhistoric. The Territorial Army dates from 1908; the\r\nVolunteers from 1859; the Regular Army itself only from 1645. But for a\r\nmillennium before the oldest of them the ancient defence of England was\r\nthe Nation in Arms. When will it be so again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCOMPULSORY SERVICE AND LIBERTY\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Reprinted, with the addition of References, from the _Morning\r\n     Post_ of September 28th, 1915.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE PLEA OF FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opponents of national service pursue two lines of argument, the one\r\nhistorical, the other theoretical. Along the line of history they try to\r\nshow that compulsory military duty is alien from the English\r\nConstitution, and that the voluntary system is the good old system by\r\nmeans of which Great Britain has maintained her independence, achieved\r\nher glories, and founded her Empire. Along the line of political theory\r\nthey contend that the demand for national service is contrary to the\r\nspirit of liberty, that freedom is an essential characteristic of the\r\nEnglish genius, that Britons may be persuaded but not coerced, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding study I have shown the utter baselessness of the\r\nhistorical argument, pointed out that compulsory service was the very\r\nfoundation of the Anglo-Saxon system of defence, and concluded that\r\nwhereas \"the Territorial Army dates from 1908, the Volunteers from 1859,\r\nthe Regular Army itself only from 1645, for a millennium before the\r\noldest of them the ancient defence of England was the Nation in Arms.\" I\r\nnow turn to the theoretical argument, and propose to consider what is\r\nmeant by the term \"liberty,\" and ask whether the compulsion involved in\r\nnational service is incompatible with liberty properly understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE TERM \"LIBERTY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that in this country, as in America, the term\r\n\"liberty\" enjoys much popularity. Sir John Seeley has remarked that just\r\nas \"its unlimited generality\" makes it \"delightful to poets,\" so its\r\nharmonious sound is so grateful to the ears of the public at large that\r\n\"if a political speech did not frequently mention liberty,\" no one would\r\n\"know what to make of it or where to applaud.\"[25] Matthew Arnold goes\r\nso far as to speak of \"our worship of freedom,\" and to depict liberty\r\nas the object of a fanatical semi-religious adoration.[26] But as a rule\r\nwhere an Englishman adores he does not define, and if one asks the\r\ncommon devotee of liberty what he understands by the abstraction before\r\nwhich he prostrates himself, one generally requires but a small portion\r\nof the dialectic subtlety of Socrates to involve him in a hopeless\r\ntangle of contradictions. He can no more define liberty than he can\r\nlocate his soul. Mr. D. G. Ritchie truly says: \"Many crimes have been\r\ndone, and a still greater amount of nonsense talked in the name of\r\nliberty.\"[27] Seeley, with as much justice as pungency, asserts that\r\nsome writers \"teach us to call by the name of liberty whatever in\r\npolitics we want,\" and so lead us to disguise our selfishness and\r\ncowardice in the stolen garb of moral principle.[28] At any rate, there\r\nis urgent need that before we either support or oppose any practical\r\npolitical measure in the name of liberty, we should clear our minds of\r\nconfusion, and should reach an understanding of what precisely we mean\r\nby this vast and vague expression. It will be found, I think, upon\r\nexamination, that the term \"liberty,\" as employed in the sphere of\r\npolitics, has four distinct connotations. I hope to show that in no one\r\nof these four senses is liberty incompatible with the compulsory element\r\nimplicit in the principle of national service.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Seeley. _Introduction to Political Science_, pp. 103-4.\r\n\r\n[26] Arnold. _Culture and Anarchy_, chap. ii.\r\n\r\n[27] Ritchie. _Natural Rights_, p. 135.\r\n\r\n[28] Seeley: _op. cit._, p. 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LIBERTY AS FREEDOM FROM FOREIGN CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A free nation,\" says Sir William Temple, \"is that which has never been\r\nconquered, or thereby entered into any condition of subjection.\"[29] In\r\nthis sense of freedom from foreign domination liberty is the immemorial\r\nboast of Britons. They never have been, or will be, slaves. They are,\r\nand they are determined to remain--so they proudly sing--free as the\r\nwaves that wash their shores, free as the winds that sweep their hills.\r\nThey are resolved that no alien tyrant shall plant his foot upon their\r\nnecks. As in the Middle Ages they repudiated the claim of German\r\nEmperors and Ultramontane Popes to exercise political sovereignty over\r\nthem; as in more modern times they resisted conquest by the Spaniard\r\nPhilip and the Corsican Napoleon; even so would they resist to the\r\nextreme limit of endurance any attempt to-day to reduce them to\r\nservitude. The proposition that freedom in this sense of national\r\nindependence is consistent with compulsory military service needs no\r\ndemonstration at all. So far from there being any incompatibility\r\nbetween the two, it is probable that only by means of a manhood\r\nuniversally trained to the use of arms can the freedom of Britain and\r\nthe integrity of the Empire be ultimately maintained. We shall almost\r\ncertainly have to choose, not between national service and liberty, but\r\nbetween national service and destruction.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[29] Temple. _Works_ ii, p. 87.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. LIBERTY AS SYNONYMOUS WITH RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a second and somewhat looser sense \"Liberty is regarded as the\r\nequivalent of Parliamentary government.\"[30] We speak of one type of\r\nConstitution as \"free\" and of another type as \"unfree.\" The so-called\r\n\"free\" type of government is that in which political power rests in the\r\nhands of the Democracy, whereas in \"unfree\" States the people are in\r\nsubjection to a ruling person or class. From the point of view of the\r\nindividual subject this distinction has no meaning at all. For the laws\r\npassed by a Democratic Parliament are coercive and compulsory in\r\nprecisely the same manner and degree as are the laws of a despotic\r\nmonarchy or a close oligarchy. There is, indeed, a \"tyranny of the\r\nmajority\" which can be quite as oppressive to the individual as the\r\ntyranny of the one or the few, and much less easy to evade. From the\r\npoint of view of the enfranchised community, however, the term \"free\"\r\nhas a meaning, and its use can be defended. For if the electorate be\r\nregarded as a unit, akin to an organism, government becomes\r\nself-government, and any obligations which the community places upon\r\nitself by means of laws can be looked upon as self-limitations, imposed\r\nby free-will and capable of removal at any moment by the unfettered\r\nexercise of the power which imposed them. From this communal point of\r\nview, however, it is evident that national service involves no\r\ndiminution of liberty. The community becomes not one whit less free\r\nbecause it decides to train itself in the use of arms and to mobilize\r\nall its resources for military purposes. It retains its capacity to\r\ndemobilize any time it likes, to lay aside its arms, to pension off its\r\ndrill sergeants, and to return to the paths of pacificism whenever it\r\nseems safe to do so.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[30] Seeley: _op. cit._, p. 114.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. LIBERTY AS ABSENCE OF RESTRAINT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied, however, that compulsory military service does\r\ninterfere with the power of the _individual_ to do as he likes. He is\r\nforced, whether he wants to or not, to undergo certain discipline in\r\ntime of peace, and to face uncertain danger in time of war. National\r\nservice, then, is a restriction of his liberty, if by liberty is meant\r\nthe absence of all restraint. Now this is precisely the sense in which\r\nthe term is most frequently used. \"Quid est libertas?\" (What is\r\nliberty?), asked Cicero, and he replied: \"Potestas vivendi ut velis\"\r\n(The power of living as you like).[31] \"Freedom,\" said Sir Robert\r\nFilmer, \"is the liberty for everyone to do what he lists, to live as he\r\npleases, and not to be tied by any laws.\"[32] Even Locke, Filmer's great\r\nopponent, admitted that \"the natural liberty of man is to be free from\r\nany superior power on earth.\" But who is the man who possesses this\r\nunlimited natural liberty to live as he likes, and to act as he pleases,\r\nsubject to no superior power on earth? He is either a Robinson Crusoe,\r\nexisting alone on a desert island, or he is an anarchist living in the\r\nmidst of anarchists, and acknowledging no civil government whatsoever.\r\nIn the latter case his career is likely to be as \"poor, nasty, brutish,\r\nand short\" as that of the primitive savage depicted by Hobbes. For if\r\none man is free to live as he likes, subject to no superior power, so\r\nare all. Hence in such a society of absolute freemen, human law is\r\ntotally abrogated, no life is protected, no property safeguarded.\r\nEveryone, so far as his power avails, does what he pleases, takes what\r\nhe covets, slays whom he hates. When his power ceases to avail, that is\r\nwhen a stronger than he appears upon the scene, he is himself liable to\r\nbe despoiled and killed. Such is the state of society in which absolute\r\nliberty obtains. It is a chaos of incessant civil war, where \"every man\r\nis enemy to every man.\" Its unfortunate victims, the possessors of\r\nunrestricted liberty, find that there is\r\n\r\n\r\n     War among them, and despair\r\n     Within them, raging without truce or term.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from this intolerable condition of perfect freedom that\r\ngovernment saves a man. But it saves him--and in no other way can it\r\npossibly do so--by taking away from both himself and his fellows alike\r\nand in equal measure, part of their insufferable birthright of liberty.\r\nThe very essence of government is restriction, compulsion, law. Under\r\ngovernment, then, whatever may be its form, no man is free in the sense\r\nof being exempt from restraint. Natural liberty gives place in organized\r\nsociety to civil liberty, which is a much more modest and limited thing.\r\n\"Civil liberty,\" says Blackstone, \"is no other than natural liberty so\r\nfar restrained by human laws as is necessary and expedient for the\r\ngeneral advantage of the public.\"[34] In the same sense Austin defines\r\nit as \"the liberty from legal obligation which is left or granted by a\r\nsovereign government to any of its own subjects.\"[35] But the most\r\nluminous definition is that of Montesquieu, who says: \"La liberté est\r\nle droit de faire tout ce que les lois permettent.\"[36] Those who would\r\nunderstand what true civil or political liberty is, and what are its\r\nnecessary limitations, should imprint this profound utterance upon their\r\nmemories, and employ it as a universal test of sound thinking on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"Liberty is the right to do all that the laws allow\"--no more, and no\r\nless. Liberty, then, in the sphere of politics, is not the absence of\r\nall restraint whatsoever, but only the absence of all restraint except\r\nthat of the law. Thus the freedom of which Britons boast--\"English\r\nliberty\"--is not a licence to anyone to do as he likes, but is merely\r\nthe right of everyone to do what the laws of England permit, and it is a\r\nsplendid possession merely because the laws of England are eminent for\r\njustice and equity. \"English liberty\" is perfectly consistent, as we all\r\nadmit, with compulsory registration, vaccination, education, taxation,\r\ninsurance, inspection, and countless other legal coercions. From our\r\ncradles to our graves we are beset behind and before by government\r\nregulations; yet we rightly assert that we are free. If then the laws of\r\nEngland add one more coercion, and proclaim anew the duty of universal\r\nmilitary service, not only will they do a thing consonant with justice\r\nand equity, they will also do a thing which does not in the smallest\r\ndegree diminish any individual's civil liberty.[37]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] Cicero. _Parad._, v, 1.\r\n\r\n[32] Filmer. _Patriarcha_, quoted and criticized by Locke, _On\r\nGovernment_, book ii, chap. iv.\r\n\r\n[33] Shelley. _Ode to Liberty_, Canto 2. Compare the description of\r\n_Huriyeh_ (Liberty) given by Sir Mark Sykes in _The Caliphs' Last\r\nHeritage_. I quote the following from a review in _The Spectator_, of\r\nNovember 27th, 1915: Sir Mark Sykes saw _Huriyeh_ (Liberty) at work in\r\nthe distant provinces of the Empire. \"What, O father of Mahmud,\" he said\r\nto an old Arab acquaintance, \"is this _Huriyeh_?\" The \"father of Mahmud\"\r\nreplied without hesitation \"that there is no law and each one can do all\r\nhe likes.\" Neither was this lawless interpretation of liberty confined\r\nto Moslems. The Greek Christians in the neighbourhood of Hebron were\r\n\"armed to the teeth and glad of _Huriyeh_, for they say they can now\r\nraid as well as other men.\" In Anatolia, a muleteer who had been\r\ndischarged from Sir Mark Sykes's service \"spent all his time singing\r\n'Liberty--Equality--Fraternity,' the reason being that the Committee at\r\nSmyrna released him from prison, where he was undergoing sentence for\r\nhis third murder.\"\r\n\r\n[34] Blackstone. _Commentaries_, i, 140.\r\n\r\n[35] Austin. _Jurisprudence_, p. 274.\r\n\r\n[36] Montesquieu. _Esprit des Lois_, p. 420.\r\n\r\n[37] _Cf._ Philip Snowden, _Socialism and Syndicalism_, p. 175. \"When\r\nall submit to law imposed by the common will for the common good, the\r\nlaw is not slavery, but true liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. LIBERTY AS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nLiberty as absence of restraint is, however, a merely negative thing; it\r\nis a \"being let alone.\" Some great writers, John Stuart Mill for\r\nexample, treat it as though it had only this negative character, and as\r\nthough to be let alone were necessarily and in itself a good thing. But\r\nothers have truly and forcefully shown, first, that to be let alone may\r\nsometimes be a doubtful blessing, and, secondly, that liberty has a\r\nfurther and positive aspect not less important than the negative. Sir J.\r\nF. Stephen, in his _Liberty, Equality, Fraternity_, vigorously\r\ncriticizes Mill's negative theory. Matthew Arnold in _Culture and\r\nAnarchy_ (a work which well repays perusal at the present time) pours\r\ndelightful but destructive ridicule upon \"our prevalent notion that it\r\nis a most happy and important thing for a man merely to be able to do as\r\nhe likes.\" Thomas Carlyle, in _Past and Present_ and elsewhere,\r\nvehemently expounds a positive ideal of liberty which involves strenuous\r\nwork for the good of man and for social advancement. \"If liberty be not\r\nthat,\" he concludes, \"I for one have small care about liberty.\" But\r\nfirst in eminence among the exponents of the positive aspect of liberty\r\nstands Thomas Hill Green, of Oxford. In his works he contends that\r\nliberty is more than absence of restraint, just as beauty is more than\r\nabsence of ugliness.[38] He holds that it includes also \"a positive\r\npower or capacity of doing or enjoying something worth doing or\r\nenjoying.\" He agrees with Mazzini that complete freedom is \"found only\r\nin that satisfying fulfilment of civic duties to which rights, however\r\nprecious, are but the vestibule.\"[39] He looks at freedom, that is to\r\nsay, from the communal and not from the individual point of view. Man is\r\na political animal, and only in an organized society can he attain his\r\nhighest development. It is not good for man to be alone; each individual\r\nneeds the companionship and co-operation of his fellows; no one in\r\nsolitude can attain even to self-realization. Hence, government is more\r\nthan a restraining power; it is also an organizing power. It not only\r\nprevents its subjects from injuring one another; it places them where\r\nthey can most effectively aid one another and work together for the\r\ncommon weal. It frees their faculties from the impotence of isolation,\r\nand opens up to them the unbounded possibilities of corporate activity.\r\nHence, liberty on its positive side becomes merged in national service,\r\nin the broad sense of the fulfilment of the duties of citizenship. Thus\r\nhe is an enemy of freedom who holds himself aloof from his fellows and\r\ndeclines to bear his share in the general burden. If, then, the State\r\ncalls upon all its subjects to join together in undertaking the supreme\r\ntask of national defence, every true lover of liberty must respond \"Here\r\nam I.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Green, _Principles of Political Obligation_, p. 110-5.\r\n\r\n[39] _Cf._ MacCunn, _Six Radical Thinkers_, p. 259.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE VOLUNTARY PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Reprinted from the _Morning Post_ of December 28th, 1915.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE IDEA OF VOLUNTARISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that Britons are a common-sense and practical\r\npeople, but a people impervious to ideas; that they are quick at the\r\ninvention of expedients, but slow to recognize and follow general\r\nprinciples. This statement may be true of the nation as a whole; but it\r\nis lamentably untrue in respect of our politicians. They do somehow now\r\nand again get ideas into their heads, and when once they are there it\r\nseems as though nothing on earth or from heaven can eradicate them. I\r\nsuppose that the explanation of this steadfast consistency, or\r\nunteachable obstinacy, is that their ideas soon pass out of their own\r\ncontrol. Principles once professed are formulated into programmes,\r\nprogrammes are solidified into platforms, and platforms are planted\r\nupon the insensate rock of party organization. Hence, to abandon an idea\r\n(even when it is found to be erroneous) or to repudiate a principle\r\n(even when it is proved to be false and pernicious) involves a political\r\nupheaval akin to a revolution. It is easier to continue to stand on an\r\nobsolete platform and watch a nation drift to disaster than to abandon\r\nthe platform and endanger the party organization--euphemistically termed\r\nfor the occasion \"national unity.\" An excellent case in point is the\r\npathetic devotion of successive Governments to the voluntary principle\r\nof military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ITS ESTABLISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the voluntary principle--a comparatively modern\r\nnovelty--is one which established itself in our constitution during the\r\nlong period of peace that followed the Battles of Trafalgar and\r\nWaterloo, and it had its _raison d'être_ in the circumstances of the\r\ntime. Our Navy had secured the undisputed command of the sea. Our shores\r\nand the shores of our distant Dominions were secure from invasion. All\r\nthat we had to fear was an occasional Chartist riot, or Irish rebellion,\r\nor Indian mutiny, or petty Colonial war. To suppress these sporadic\r\ndisorders a small professional army was incomparably the best\r\ninstrument, and it was, of course, best secured and maintained by the\r\nsystem of voluntary enlistment. Thus in the halcyon Georgian and\r\nVictorian days the right inherent in every sovereign Government to call\r\nupon its subjects for national service sank into forgetfulness, the\r\nancient military obligations of Englishmen fell into desuetude, and\r\nvoluntarism held the field.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, however, _i.e._, soon after the present\r\nGerman Emperor came to the throne, circumstances radically changed.\r\nGermany obtained Heligoland and began to convert it into a naval base;\r\nshe developed marked colonial activity and threatened British ascendancy\r\nin many parts of the world; she formulated a maritime programme and\r\ncommenced the construction of a formidable navy. Nor was she alone.\r\nOther Powers also--Powers at that time regarded as less friendly to\r\nBritain than Germany was supposed to be--started in the race for\r\noverseas dominions, international commerce, and strong fleets. It became\r\nevident to the most casual observer that sooner or later British command\r\nof the sea might be challenged, Britain and the Dominions attacked, and\r\nthe future of the Empire put to the issue of war. Hence prudent\r\npatriots, who in course of time organized themselves into the National\r\nService League under the guidance of Lord Roberts--_clarum atque\r\nvenerabile nomen_--urged the revival of the old-time duty of universal\r\nmilitary training in preparation for, and as the best safeguard against,\r\nthe growing peril. But no! Politicians had committed themselves to the\r\nvoluntary principle. The party caucuses would not risk the sacrifice of\r\nplace and power that might ensue from the preaching of the unpalatable\r\ndoctrine of duty and discipline to their masters, the electors. Hence,\r\namid dangers daily growing greater in magnitude, the defence of the\r\nEmpire on land (the garrisoning of one-fifth part of the land-area of\r\nthe globe) was left to the diminutive professional force established\r\nmerely for Imperial police purposes--a force smaller than that which\r\nSerbia felt necessary to guard her independence, or Switzerland to\r\nassure her neutrality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE RESULT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the result? It was this: that the British Empire, the richest\r\nprize that the world has ever displayed, spread out its treasures before\r\nthe envious eyes of militant nations, practically undefended, save for\r\nits slender ring of circling ships. There it lay, a constant and\r\nirresistible lure, especially to that parvenu and predatory Germanic\r\nPower which had appeared upon the European scene, as the offspring of\r\ntreachery and violence, in 1871. Thus those politicians--they were to be\r\nfound in all parties--who refused to face the new conditions, who\r\npersisted in maintaining that the voluntary principle, which sufficed to\r\npolice an Empire externally secure, would also guard it against a world\r\nin arms, did their unwitting best to render an attack inevitable, and to\r\nensure that when it burst upon us it should do us the maximum of damage.\r\n\r\nIn due time, that is, when Germany thought that \"the day\" had dawned,\r\nthe war came. Then the voluntary principle manifested its proper fruits.\r\nWe found ourselves suddenly called upon to confront the supreme crisis\r\nof our fate with a gigantic proletariat untrained and unarmed, and with\r\na diminutive army (below even its nominal strength), wholly inadequate\r\nto the magnitude of its tasks. What were the consequences? They were\r\nthese: First, that our devoted Expeditionary Force, insufficient and\r\nunsupported, was sent across the Channel to almost certain and complete\r\nannihilation; secondly, that masses of reserves urgently needed on the\r\nContinent had to be kept in these islands to counter the risks of\r\ninvasion; thirdly, that the mobility of our Navy had to be sacrificed to\r\nthe same necessity of domestic defence (hence the disaster to Admiral\r\nCradock); and, finally, that Belgium and North-East France had to be\r\nabandoned to the enemy--to be recovered later, if possible, at the cost\r\nof tens of thousands of lives.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought that at such a crisis of destiny our politicians\r\nwould have faced the facts, would have realized that the time had come\r\nto summon the nation, as a disciplined whole, to front its peril and do\r\nits duty. If they had but had the courage to do so, who can doubt the\r\nloyalty of the response? But, once more, No! All sorts of irrelevant\r\nconsiderations of petty domestic politics--matters of votes and seats\r\nand party prejudices--determined the issue. The voluntary principle must\r\nat any cost be maintained sacrosanct and intact. Hence, to get the\r\nnecessary men--or, rather, far fewer than the necessary men--every\r\nvariety of extravagant and humiliating expedient had to be adopted.\r\nHundreds of thousands of pounds of public money were squandered in\r\nadvertisement and appeal, and a chaos of indiscriminate enlistment was\r\ninaugurated. Again, with what results? With these results: First, that\r\nmyriads of middle-aged men with families have been taken while unmarried\r\nslackers have been left; secondly, that invaluable war-workers have been\r\ndrawn from necessary tasks while useless wastrels have remained at\r\nlarge; thirdly, that the rate of recruiting has been spasmodic and\r\nwholly incalculable, that our armies have never been quite strong enough\r\nfor the successive operations assigned to them, and that consequently a\r\nvast, needless, and largely fruitless sacrifice of the very cream of our\r\nnation's manhood has taken place. To the idol of voluntarism a veritable\r\nholocaust of victims has been offered up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE PRESENT SITUATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voluntary principle, after seventeen months of inconceivably\r\ndestructive war, still nominally holds the field.[40] Our sovereign\r\npoliticians have up to the present remained verbally true to it; but at\r\nwhat a price! They have indefinitely postponed victory; they have\r\nallowed the sphere of operations to be immensely enlarged; they have\r\nbeen compelled through sheer military feebleness to witness neutral\r\nnations being drawn on to the side of the enemy; they have been unable\r\nto strike a decisive blow anywhere. Thus the war drags on inconclusively\r\nat a cost of £5,000,000 and 2,000 casualties every day. But the\r\nvoluntary principle has been respected and vindicated! Has it? True it\r\nis that there has been a magnificent response to the Government's\r\nappeals. The patriotism and devotion of one half of the nation have\r\neffectively enabled the other half to evade its duty. But the time has\r\nagain come when the demand for more men is imperative. Voluntarism is\r\nmaking its last efforts. Its devotees in their desperate endeavours to\r\nprevent its formal abandonment are eliminating from it every element of\r\nfree will, and are introducing every device of veiled compulsion.\r\nCanvassers and recruiting-sergeants have brought immense pressure to\r\nbear upon every eligible man, under threats that unless he \"volunteers\"\r\nhe will shortly be fetched, and fetched on less favourable terms than\r\nthose now offered. Moreover, all sorts of other kinds of pressure are\r\nadded. The papers are full of instances. For example, the Foreign Office\r\nis refusing passports to men of military age; the great shipping lines\r\nare declining to take eligible emigrants; employers are refusing work\r\nto applicants who they think might serve. Finally, Mr. Asquith, in the\r\nHouse of Commons, gives the whole case away, and from the voluntarist\r\npoint of view perpetrates the great apostasy, by admitting that our\r\nvoluntary system of recruiting is \"haphazard, capricious, and unjust,\"\r\nand by protesting that he has \"no abstract or _a priori_ objection of\r\nany sort or kind to compulsion in time of war,\" adding that he has no\r\nintention whatever to go to the stake \"in defence of what is called the\r\nvoluntary principle.\"[41] Poor \"voluntary principle\"! Already abandoned\r\nin practice, and now thrown over by its former high-priest!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] This was written in December, 1915. A few weeks later the Military\r\nService Bill became law. Compulsion is to be applied from March 1st,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n[41] House of Commons debate, November 2nd, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any shred or remnant of this deserted and discredited voluntary\r\nprinciple that is worth saving? There is not. It is the last\r\ndisreputable relic of the extreme individualism of the Manchester School\r\nof the early nineteenth century, which taught a political theory that\r\nhas been abandoned by all serious thinkers. Everyone now admits that it\r\nis the function of the State to secure as far as it can the conditions\r\nof the good life to its citizens. It is the logical and inevitable\r\ncorollary that it is the duty of every citizen to support and safeguard\r\nthe State. It has long been one of the gravest weaknesses of our modern\r\ndemocracy that, while it has insisted vehemently upon its claims against\r\nthe State--claims to education, employment, office, insurance, pension,\r\nand so on--it has remained comparatively oblivious to its\r\nresponsibilities. Its so-called political leaders, who too often are but\r\nself-seeking flatterers fawning for its favour, have persistently\r\nencouraged it to concentrate its efforts upon getting without giving. It\r\nhas been taught that it is proper to use political power in pursuit of\r\nselfish aims and to employ all manner of compulsion therein; but in the\r\nmatter of national service it has received soothing lessons on the\r\nsurpassing glories of the voluntary principle. It is the State which is\r\nto be coerced by threats of passive resistance or general strikes; but\r\nif the State attempts coercion in the exercise of its functions it is\r\nmet by the passionate proclamation of the rights of personal freedom.\r\nSimilarly, we have the amazing spectacle of Trade Unionists meeting in\r\ncongress to condemn \"conscription\" and at the same time sanctioning the\r\nmost extreme measures of illegal persecution to drive non-Unionists into\r\nthe ranks of their own organizations. It is a monstrous and intolerable\r\nperversion of all sound political principles. The whole sorry business\r\nis a flagrant example of the subtle way in which a democracy can be\r\ncajoled, corrupted, and depraved.\r\n\r\nI elaborated this point in a letter to the _Observer_ which the Editor\r\nkindly allows me to reprint here. It will be found in the issue of\r\nJanuary 17th, 1915:\r\n\r\n\r\n     One of the most curious phenomena of present-day politics is the\r\n     opposition offered by collectivists to conscription--under which\r\n     term they persistently and disingenuously include both the\r\n     compulsory service of the German army and the very different\r\n     universal military training of the Swiss citizen.\r\n\r\n     Even Mr. Herbert Spencer and the extreme individualists of his\r\n     school admitted that national defence is a proper function of the\r\n     State, and that a government may rightly use compulsory powers to\r\n     safeguard the community from attack.\r\n\r\n     But Mr. Arnold Bennett and the semi-socialists of the _Daily\r\n     Chronicle_ and the _Daily News_--although they are filled with\r\n     horror and indignation if it is suggested that an artisan should be\r\n     allowed to choose whether or not he will enjoy the advantages of\r\n     the Insurance Act; or that a collier, if he wishes to do so, should\r\n     be permitted to work for more than eight hours a day; or that a\r\n     labourer should be exempted from persecution as a blackleg if he\r\n     prefers to remain outside the fold of a trade union--are fired\r\n     with a long-dormant zeal for individual liberty, if it is urged\r\n     that a young man's citizenship is incomplete until he has been\r\n     called and prepared to defend his home and his country in case of\r\n     need.\r\n\r\n     Their collectivism is, in fact, a peculiarly perverted or inverted\r\n     type of individualism. It insists on the right of the individual,\r\n     if unemployed, to come to the State for work; if in poverty, to\r\n     come to the State for relief; if ignorant, to come to the State for\r\n     education: but it strenuously resists the exercise by the State of\r\n     its reciprocal claim on the service of the individual. It is\r\n     engrossed by the contemplation of the rights of the individual and\r\n     the duties of the State; it ignores the rights of the State and the\r\n     duties of the individual.\r\n\r\n     It is true that our voluntary system of military service has done\r\n     wonders in this war, far more indeed than could ever have been\r\n     expected of it; but this does not alter the fact that it is _wrong\r\n     in principle_. It is quite conceivable that a similar voluntary\r\n     system of monetary contributions would, if compulsory taxation were\r\n     abolished, supply the necessities of government; but it would be a\r\n     most iniquitous system, pressing heavily on the generous, and\r\n     allowing the niggardly to escape. We all, in fact, admit that it\r\n     would be entirely improper to replace the income-tax form by the\r\n     begging-letter. For precisely the same reasons it is entirely\r\n     improper that enlistment for home defence should depend on the\r\n     voluntary sacrifice of the patriotic minority, while the careless\r\n     and worthless majority elude their duty.\r\n\r\n     It is, moreover, deeply humiliating to the national pride to see\r\n     the protection of our shores, and the existence of our Empire,\r\n     dependent on the response made to advertisements, to platform\r\n     appeals, to music-hall songs, and to the kisses so generously\r\n     proffered by popular actresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be no small compensation for the immeasurable losses of this war\r\nif the lofty old-English ideals of duty and service are restored to\r\ntheir rightful place in our political system, and if in respect of the\r\nessentials of national existence, viz., defence of the realm and\r\nobedience to law, we completely eliminate and frankly repudiate--as we\r\nhave already done in the sphere of taxation--the enervating one-sided\r\nindividualism of the voluntary principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPASSIVE RESISTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE NEW PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time past there has existed in this country a sort of\r\nsmouldering rebellion known as passive resistance. It is difficult to\r\nsay when it had its origin; but probably it could be traced back to the\r\nReformation. For it is merely a veiled manifestation of that anarchic\r\nindividualism and that morbid conscientiousness--the extremes of\r\nqualities admirable in moderation--which first became formidable in\r\nEngland on the break-up of mediæval Christendom. In recent times it has\r\ndisplayed itself in many new forms, and on an increasingly large scale,\r\nuntil now, in this great crisis of our fate, it has grown to be a\r\nserious menace to the national unity, and a grave danger to the very\r\nexistence of the State. We have in our midst at the present day--to\r\nmention only the leading specimens--Ritualists who refuse to obey\r\njudgments of the Privy Council, or to heed injunctions issued by bishops\r\nappointed by the Crown; Anti-Vivisectionists who resist regulations\r\nregarded as essential by the health authorities; Undenominationalists\r\nwho decline to pay rates necessary to maintain the system of education\r\nestablished by law; Christian Scientists whose criminal neglect in the\r\ncase of dangerous diseases not only renders them guilty of homicide, but\r\nalso imperils the welfare of the whole community; Suffragists who defy\r\nall law comprehensively, on the ground that the legislature from which\r\nit emanates is not constituted as they think it ought to be; Trade\r\nUnionists who combine to stultify any Act of Parliament which conflicts\r\nwith the rules of their own organizations; and finally, a\r\nNo-Conscription Fellowship whose members expressly \"deny the right of\r\nGovernment to say, 'You _shall_ bear arms,'\" and threaten to \"oppose\r\nevery effort to introduce compulsory military service into Great\r\nBritain.\"[42] Here is a pretty collection of aliens from the\r\ncommonwealth! It contains examples of almost every variety of\r\nanti-social eccentricity. So diverse and conflicting are the types of\r\npassive resistance represented that there is only one thing that can be\r\npredicated of all the members of all the groups, and it is this--that\r\nthey are rebels.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[42] No-Conscription Manifesto printed in full in the _Morning Post_,\r\nMay 31st, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PASSIVE RESISTANCE AS REBELLION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essential preliminary to any useful discussion of passive resistance\r\nis the clear recognition of the fact that it is rebellion, and nothing\r\nless. To say, or admit, this is not necessarily to condemn it; for there\r\nare few persons to-day, I suppose, who would contend that rebellion is\r\nnever justifiable. All it asserts is that passive resistance has to be\r\njudged by the same measures and according to the same standards as any\r\nother kind of revolt against constituted political authority. It is all\r\nthe more needful to make this plain because some of the milder but more\r\nmuddled among the resisters try to shut their eyes to the fact that they\r\nare rebels. They claim to be sheep and not goats. They call themselves\r\nSocialists; they profess an abnormal loyalty to the idea of the State;\r\nthey protest their devotion to the Great Society; they ask to be allowed\r\nto make all sorts of sacrifices to the community; they announce their\r\nwillingness to do anything--except the one thing which the Government\r\nrequires them to do. The exception is fatal to their claim. \"To obey is\r\nbetter than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.\" The State\r\ndoes not and cannot submit the validity of its enactments to the private\r\njudgment of its subjects. It expresses and enforces the general will,\r\nand it dare not leave to the choice, or even to the conscience, of the\r\nindividual an option as to which of its commands shall be obeyed, and\r\nwhich not. To do so would be to loose the bands of society, to bring to\r\nan end the reign of law, and to plunge the community once again into\r\nthat primal chaos of anarchy from which in the beginning it painfully\r\nemerged. The State demands, and must necessarily demand, implicit\r\nobedience. From the loyal it receives it. Those from whom it does not\r\nreceive it are rebels, no matter how conscientious they may be, how\r\nlofty their moral elevation, how sublimely passive their resistance. So\r\nfar as their disobedience extends they are the enemies of organized\r\nsociety, disrupters of the commonwealth, subverters of government, the\r\nallies and confederates of criminals and anarchists. It is worth noting,\r\nmoreover, how easily their passive resistance develops into more active\r\nforms of rebellion. Not for long was the Suffragist content to remain\r\nmerely defensive in revolt; soon she emerged with whips for Cabinet\r\nMinisters, hammers for windows, and bombs for churches. Resistant Trade\r\nUnionists rapidly and generally slide into sabotage and personal\r\nviolence. The No-Conscriptionists of Ireland threaten through Mr.\r\nByrne, M.P., for Dublin, that \"if Conscription is forced on Ireland, it\r\nwill be resisted by drilled and armed forces\"[43]--a delightfully\r\nHibernian type of anti-militarism, which, nevertheless, throws a lurid\r\nlight on the real meaning of the movement. It is seen to be rebellion,\r\nopen, naked and unashamed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[43] See _Times_, November 22nd, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE RIGHT OF REBELLION\r\n\r\n\r\nPassive resistance, then, is rebellion; but, as has already been\r\nadmitted, it is not on that account necessarily unjustifiable. An\r\nestablished government may be so hopelessly iniquitous that it ought to\r\nbe overthrown; an organized society may be so irremediably corrupt that\r\nit merits disruption; duly enacted laws may, when judged by moral\r\nstandards, be so flagrantly unjust as to demand the resistance of all\r\ngood men. There is no need to labour the point: actual examples crowd\r\nupon the mind. Who would condemn the revolt of the Greeks against\r\nTurkish rule? Who would contend that the degenerate society of the later\r\nBourbon monarchy did not deserve dissolution? Who would maintain that\r\nJohn Hampden and Oliver Cromwell had no moral warrant for their\r\nresistance to Charles I, or their successors to James II. We may freely\r\nallow that in these cases, and in many similar ones, there existed on\r\nethical grounds a right, or more strictly a communal duty, to rebel. Few\r\nwould now proclaim with Filmer the divine right of any government to\r\nexact obedience quite irrespective of the wishes or the interests of its\r\nsubjects. Still fewer would agree with Hobbes that an original contract\r\nprecludes for ever all opposition to sovereign political authority. The\r\nground on which political obligation is asserted has been shifted. The\r\nState is recognized as \"an institution for the promotion of the common\r\ngood,\" and it is admitted that if it ceases to promote the common good\r\nthe obligation to obey it is transformed into an obligation to reform\r\nit, or even to\r\n\r\n\r\n     Shatter it to bits--and then\r\n     Remould it nearer to the heart's desire.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, viewed thus, the right of rebellion assumes an aspect of awful\r\nresponsibility, perhaps the most tremendous within the sphere of\r\npolitics that the mind can conceive. For rebellion means the breaking-up\r\nof the existing order, the throwing of institutions into the\r\nmelting-pot, the letting loose of incalculable forces of discord and\r\ndestruction, the suspension of law, the return to chaos, in the hope\r\nthat out of the welter a new and better cosmos--one more fitted to\r\npromote the common good--may be evolved. Every rebel, or prospective\r\nrebel, whether of the passive or the active type, ought to ponder well\r\nthe logical consequences of his revolt against authority, ought to\r\nconsider the inevitable results that would flow from the general\r\nadoption of the principles which he professes, ought to decide whether\r\nor not he really desires to overthrow the polity under which he lives,\r\nought to ask if he and his fellows are able to face with any serious\r\nhope of success the colossal task of constructing a new society on the\r\nruins of the old. Now the historic rebels to whom I have referred above\r\nby way of example--the Greek Nationalists, the French Revolutionists,\r\nthe English Puritans and Whigs--did not hesitate to acknowledge the\r\nnature of their acts, and were not unprepared to face their\r\nconsequences. They did not deceive themselves, or attempt to deceive\r\nothers, by false professions of loyalty. The Greeks proclaimed their\r\nundying hostility to the Turks, fought them, shook off their yoke, and\r\nerected a national kingdom on the ruins of Turkish tyranny. The French\r\nRevolutionists openly declared war upon the old regime, eradicated it\r\nby means of the guillotine, and established a republic where it had\r\nbeen. Similarly the English Puritans repudiated allegiance to Charles I,\r\nbrought him to the block, and instituted the Commonwealth in his place;\r\nwhile the Whigs drove out James II and set up the constitutional\r\nmonarchy of William and Mary. One can respect heroic rebels of these\r\ntypes. They were honest and open; they attacked great abuses; they took\r\ngreat risks, and they achieved notable results. Very different are our\r\nmodern rebels. They profess with nauseating unction loyalty to the State\r\nwhose dominion they are undermining; they claim to be exceptionally\r\nvirtuous members of the Society whose unity they are destroying; above\r\nall they continue to demand with insolent effrontery the protection of\r\nthe very law and the very courts whose authority they are denying and\r\ndefying. They can be freed from the charge of the most revolting\r\nhypocrisy only on the plea that \"they know not what they do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. REBELLION AGAINST A DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is granted, then, that rebellion may sometimes be not only a\r\njustifiable act, but also a bounden public duty. Three examples have\r\nbeen given which perhaps may be allowed to have illustrated and\r\nconfirmed this view. It will be noted, however, that in each of the\r\ncases cited the revolt was that of an oppressed community against a\r\ngovernment in which it had no part or lot, and over which it had no\r\nconstitutional control. Rebellion against a democracy on the part of\r\nmembers of that democracy stands on a widely different footing. It is\r\ntreachery as well as insurrection. One can, indeed, conceive\r\ncircumstances which would justify it; but they would be rare and\r\nexceptional, and that for two reasons. First, in a democracy\r\nconstitutional means are provided for the alteration of law and even for\r\nthe remodelling of the form of government. Secondly, if a democratic\r\ngovernment is undermined by disobedience, discredited by successful\r\ndefiance, destroyed by treasonable betrayal on the part of its own\r\nprofessed supporters, there is nothing to take its place; the community\r\nis bound either to drift into anarchy, or to revert to some sort of\r\ntyranny. Let us consider these two points in turn. (1) The essence of\r\ndemocracy is government according to the will of the majority. This\r\nalmost necessarily implies government in opposition to the will of one\r\nor more minorities. But democratic minorities have a remedy--and it is\r\nthe peculiar virtue of democracy to provide it. It is this: by means of\r\nargument, persuasion, and appeal; by press agitation and platform\r\ncampaign; through organization and combination, to convert themselves\r\ninto a majority. The whole of our English political system, the very\r\nexistence of our democratic constitution, depends upon the recognition\r\nand acceptance of this rule of the game. If the will of the majority is\r\nnot to be regarded as authoritative, measures for reform of the\r\nfranchise, extension of the suffrage, and adjustment of the electoral\r\nmachine have no rational meaning at all. They are merely vanity and\r\nvexation of spirit. What matter who makes the laws, or what laws are\r\nmade, if laws are not to be implicitly obeyed? Our extremists want to\r\nhave it both ways: they want to enforce law with majestic severity as\r\n\"the Will of the People,\" when they are in a majority; but they also\r\nwant to defy law with conscientious obstinacy as a violation of personal\r\nfreedom when they are in a minority. Some members of \"The Union of\r\nDemocratic Control\" are also members of the \"No-Conscription\r\nFellowship\"! Could inconsistency or muddle-headedness go further? Those\r\nwho wish to rule as part of a majority must be prepared to be overruled\r\nas part of a minority. If minorities, instead of employing the\r\nconstitutional machinery placed at their disposal to secure the repeal\r\nof obnoxious laws, are going to resist and rebel whenever the majority\r\ndoes something of which they strongly disapprove, there is an end of\r\ndemocratic government altogether, and a reversion to the state of\r\nnature. T. H. Green in his _Principles of Political Obligation_ puts the\r\ncase clearly and well. He asks this very question, What shall an\r\nindividual do when he is faced by a command of a democratic government\r\nwhich he believes to be wrong? He replies: \"In a country like ours with\r\na popular government and settled methods of enacting and repealing laws,\r\nthe answer of common sense is simple and sufficient. He should do all he\r\ncan by legal methods to get the command cancelled, but till it is\r\ncancelled, he should conform to it. The common good must suffer more\r\nfrom resistance to a law or to the ordinance of a legal authority than\r\nfrom the individual's conformity to the particular law or ordinance that\r\nis bad, until its repeal can be obtained.\"[44] Here we have the true\r\nground of the duty of obedience. The antagonistic principle of passive\r\nresistance provides a charter for criminals and anarchists.\r\n\r\n(2) The second point needs little enlargement. It is clear from many\r\nexamples in both ancient and modern history that if a monarchy is\r\noverthrown an aristocracy can take its place, and that if an aristocracy\r\nis dispossessed of power, room is made for a democracy. But what do our\r\nrebels against democracy propose to substitute for the sovereign will of\r\nthe majority, if they succeed by resistance in reducing it to impotence?\r\nPossibly they hope that their own exalted will may prevail. Let them not\r\nflatter themselves by any such vain dream. Even assuming what is\r\nimprobable, viz., that they remain united among themselves, can they\r\nsuppose that their example of successful revolt will remain without\r\nimitators, or that their anti-social doctrines will never be applied\r\nagain? If they will not render obedience when they are in a minority,\r\nwho will obey them even if they have a majority behind them? Government\r\nwill cease; the reign of order will be at an end; Society will be\r\ndissolved amid \"red ruin and the breaking-up of laws.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[44] Green. _Principles of Political Obligation_, p. 111. _Cf._ Ritchie,\r\nNatural Rights, p. 243.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE DUTY OF THE STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case seems clear. Passive resistance is rebellion, and it is\r\nentirely inconsistent with loyalty to any form of government. In\r\nrelation to democratic government it is, moreover, on the part of\r\nmembers of the democracy, treachery of a peculiarly heinous type, since\r\nit is a betrayal of the sovereign community by those within its own\r\nranks. If the sovereign community does (as it easily may) by the vote of\r\nits majority make enactments which seem to any one of its subjects to be\r\nmorally wrong, that subject has two legitimate courses open to him. He\r\nmay either obey under protest, and meantime use all lawful influence at\r\nhis disposal to convince the majority of the error of their ways, and\r\nconvert them to his way of thinking; or he may withdraw from the\r\ncommunity and its territories altogether, and go to some other part of\r\nthe wide world where the obnoxious enactment is not in force. What he\r\nmay _not_ do, is to remain within the community, enjoy all the\r\nadvantages of its ordered life, exercise its franchises, receive the\r\nprotection of its forces, claim the securities of its courts and the\r\nliberties of its constitution, and at the same time refuse to render it\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nIf in his misguided perversity he adopts this last-named course, the\r\nduty of the State is plain. It is to call him to submission, or to\r\nwithdraw its protection from him. The person who will not recognize the\r\nState's sovereignty, has no claim upon the services of the State. The\r\nfirst essential of a government is that it should govern. It should, of\r\ncourse, exercise the utmost care in issuing commands to avoid as far as\r\npossible the giving of offence to tender consciences; but when once its\r\ndeliberate commands are issued, and so long as they remain unrepealed,\r\nit should enforce them with calm but inexorable determination. Nothing\r\nis more fatal to the very foundations of political society, than the\r\nspectacle of a government that can be defied with impunity.[45] That\r\ndemoralizing spectacle has been seen far too often during recent years,\r\nand at the moment when the war broke out it had led us to the verge of\r\nnational disaster. The war has brought us into closer touch with\r\nrealities than we had been for many a long year before, and it has\r\ntaught us how ruinous it is in fatuous complacency to \"wait and see\"\r\nwhither disorder, disloyalty, and disobedience will conduct us. If,\r\nhowever, there are still in our midst ministers who tremble before\r\nrebellion, and do not know how to act in the presence of organized\r\npassive resistance, let me commend to them the worthy example of Edward\r\nI, who in 1296 was faced by a general refusal on the part of the clergy\r\nto pay taxes. He simply excluded them from the protection of the laws,\r\nand closed his courts to their pleas. A few weeks of well-merited\r\noutlawry brought to an end their ill-advised experiment in passive\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[45] Maine (_Popular Government_, p. 64) emphasizes this point. \"If,\" he\r\nsays, \"any government should be tempted to neglect, even for a moment,\r\nits function of compelling obedience to law--if a Democracy, for\r\nexample, were to allow a portion of the multitude of which it consists\r\nto set some law at defiance which it happens to dislike--it would be\r\nguilty of a crime which hardly any other virtue could redeem, and which\r\ncentury upon century might fail to repair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCHRISTIANITY AND WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. A CONFLICT OF CONVICTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nFew of those who lived through the critical ten days that culminated in\r\nthe outbreak of the Great War in August, 1914, will ever forget the\r\nconflict of emotions which the events of that dramatic period called\r\nforth. If I may speak of myself--though I think that I am merely one of\r\na large class--I was torn by the contending convictions, first, that\r\nevery consideration of honour and policy made it necessary for Britain\r\nto go to the aid of Serbia, Belgium, France, and Russia in their\r\nstruggle against the wanton attack of the Central Empires; but,\r\nsecondly, that war is a relic of barbarism, wholly incompatible with\r\ncivilization, and entirely antagonistic to the Christian ideal. On the\r\none hand I realized the magnitude of the German menace to the\r\nCommonwealth of Europe; recognized that the Teutonic race had long\r\nplotted conquest, and that it was out for world-dominion; perceived the\r\nsignificance of its monstrous demands on Serbia, and its shameless\r\nviolations of its treaty obligations to Luxemburg and Belgium; saw that\r\nthe triumph of the imperial militants would involve the disruption of\r\nthe concert of the nations, the abrogation of International Law\r\n(laboriously instituted through three centuries of painful effort) and\r\nthe collapse of the democratic order; and felt, finally, that upon\r\nBritish intervention depended the very existence of the British Empire\r\nwith all that it means of good to one-fifth part of the human race. Over\r\nagainst this group of convictions I was confronted on the other hand by\r\na vision of the cosmopolitan and pacific Kingdom of God as proclaimed in\r\nthe Sermon on the Mount, and exemplified by Christ and His disciples in\r\nPalestine, long ago--a Kingdom whose law is love; whose fundamental\r\nprinciples are inexhaustible goodwill, meekness, gentleness,\r\nbrotherly-kindness and charity; whose administration works along the\r\ngracious lines of sacrifice, unselfish devotion, and untiring\r\nbeneficence. Obviously, within the limits of such a Kingdom war is\r\ninconceivable. Under such a regime, if it were universally established,\r\nthe one service which could never be demanded would be military\r\nservice. How can the consecrated servant of the Prince of Peace in any\r\ncircumstances become a man of war?\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation of the contradiction is, I think, not impossible. It\r\nis to be effected, it seems to me, by recognizing that unflinching\r\nresistance to evil is the supreme duty of the present, while the\r\nrealization of the ideal, pacific, and world-wide Kingdom of God is the\r\ngoal of the future; and, further, that the attainment of the goal\r\ndepends upon the performance of the duty. At the moment our high task is\r\nto defend our homes, our rights, our liberties, our institutions, our\r\nstandards of justice, our hopes for humanity, against the diabolical\r\naggressor. In a happier day and a freer world we may hope that, as one\r\nof the results of our present struggle and sacrifice, beneath the sway\r\nof restored and vindicated law, a larger scope may be given for the\r\nspread of the divine realm of love. The vindication of law must precede\r\nthe proclamation of peace. The goodwill that shall put an end to strife\r\nmust be based on triumphant justice and sovereign righteousness. As yet\r\nwe see not law supreme, or justice and righteousness in the ascendant.\r\nSo long as violence is rampant, and evil stalks abroad, we must be\r\nprepared to fight even to the death. It is vain--it is worse than vain;\r\nit is treasonable--to cry \"Peace, peace,\" when there is no peace, and\r\nwhen the conditions of peace do not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE RELIGION OF THE BIBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of the religion of the Bible is its indissoluble\r\nconnection with righteousness. Other primitive cults have been either\r\ndomestic, or economic, or political. Thus the Lares and Penates\r\nsafeguarded the pious Latin family irrespective of its ethical\r\ncharacter; the Greek deities, such as Dionysus and Aphrodite, were\r\nfrankly immoral, but if propitiated they gave plenty and prosperity; the\r\ngreat gods of Rome were political personages who had no regard for\r\nprivate virtues, and their proper worship was performed by State\r\nofficials whose functions strictly fell within the department of foreign\r\naffairs. But the religion of the Chosen People, under both the Old and\r\nthe New Covenant, was, and still is, a faith whose keynote is divine\r\nlaw. The standard which has led the hosts of Jehovah to victory\r\nthroughout the ages has been the lofty ethical code which it has\r\ndisplayed and maintained. The Bible begins with the story of man's fall\r\nfrom righteousness, and it ends with a vision of his restoration to\r\nideal holiness. The prime purpose of the religion of the Bible is the\r\nconquest of sin, the defeat of the devil, the redemption of humanity,\r\nthe recovery of the lost paradise, and the re-establishment of the\r\nKingdom of Heaven. Milton made no mistake when he chose this as the\r\ncentral theme of his two immortal epics. Everything else is secondary.\r\n\r\nNow the means which the Bible describes and recognizes for the\r\nattainment of its supreme end are broadly two, viz., the persuasion of\r\nlove, and the compulsion of force. In the case of all those who can be\r\nreached thereby the gentler means are employed. With what infinite\r\npatience were the Children of Israel led throughout their chequered\r\ncareer; with what divine compassion were the faltering disciples guided\r\nalong the way of salvation! But where gentler means fail or are\r\ninapplicable, sterner measures are unhesitatingly sanctioned. The Bible\r\nknows nothing of the pernicious Manichæan objection to the use of\r\nphysical force to attain moral ends. In the beginning the rebellious\r\nangels were overthrown in battle by Michael and his hosts. The\r\nconsummation of all things is to be reached as the result of the field\r\nof Armageddon. The Old Testament history is a long record of wars\r\nundertaken at the divine command, and to the Children of Israel Jehovah\r\nwas peculiarly the God of Battles. Nor does the New Testament, with all\r\nits insistence on the power of love, ever condemn the Old Testament\r\ntheology as false, ever repudiate force as a moral agent, ever denounce\r\nwar as necessarily evil. On the contrary, it celebrates the achievements\r\nof the heroes of Israel who \"waxed valiant in fight\"; it announces\r\nirremediable destruction to the impenitent and unyielding wicked; it\r\nrecognizes to the fullest degree the civil authorities who wield the\r\nsword of justice, and make themselves a terror to evil-doers; it\r\nproclaims that those who take the sword shall perish by the sword; it\r\nadmits centurions and soldiers to the company of the elect without\r\nsuggesting that they should forsake their military duties; it tells how\r\non one notable occasion Christ Himself used force to cleanse the temple,\r\nand so for ever sanctified its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church as a whole during the long and varied course of her history\r\nhas been true to the general Biblical principle that evil should, where\r\npossible, be overcome by gentle means which give the evildoer room for\r\nrepentance, but that it should be stamped out by the force of inexorable\r\njustice where gentle means have failed. No one can contend, I fear, that\r\nthe Church has always been wise or Christly in her application of this\r\nsound Scriptural doctrine. She has, it must be admitted, sometimes\r\nencouraged premature resort to force, and has given her blessing to\r\ncountless wanton wars. She has at other times treated as evils to be\r\nsuppressed by violent means offences which have been mere deviations\r\nfrom her own arbitrary standards, and not violations of the eternal laws\r\nof truth and right. Nevertheless, however imperfect her practice, all\r\nher great teachers from Athanasius to Aquinas, and from Aquinas to the\r\npresent day, have rightly recognized the legitimacy of the employment of\r\nforce for moral purposes in the last resort, have admitted the\r\ncompatibility of Christianity with military service, and have confessed\r\nthat, evil as war is, there are evils still greater, and that the duty\r\nof every Christian man may be to fight lest the cause of righteousness\r\nand justice should suffer defeat. If the Church had taught otherwise--if\r\nshe had been captured by the Gnostic heresy of non-resistance--Mediæval\r\nChristendom and Western Civilization would inevitably have been\r\ndestroyed by the assaults of Huns and Saracens, Magyars and Tartars,\r\nVikings and Turks; while within the borders of Christendom itself law\r\nand order would have perished at the hands of wicked and violent men.\r\nSimilarly in modern times common Christian opinion has agreed that there\r\nare causes worth fighting for and worth dying for. The English Puritans,\r\nfor instance, including the early Quakers, considered that political\r\nfreedom and religious liberty were ideals that justified and indeed\r\ndemanded armed resistance to tyranny. During the last three centuries\r\nthere have been few who, on religious grounds, have condemned the revolt\r\nof Christian peoples against Turkish misrule. In the American Civil War\r\nmany professed pacificists felt that for the abolition of slavery they\r\nmust need take arms. In our own recent history men like Havelock,\r\nGordon, and Roberts have regarded as sacred trusts the tasks of saving\r\nwomen and children from massacre, of suppressing fanatical and cruel\r\ntyranny, of preventing intolerable wrong. The Church with confident\r\nconsistency has rightly sanctioned and sanctified their heroic\r\nenterprises. While condemning wars of ambition, conquest, or revenge,\r\nshe has taught that those who take arms to defend from murderous\r\nviolence the weak and helpless, to maintain the priceless heritage of\r\nfreedom, and to vindicate the majesty of law, may with humble assurance\r\nand firm faith pray for and expect the benediction of the Lord of Hosts.\r\nThe Christian doctrine of war is admirably summarized by Burke in the\r\nwords:--\"The blood of man is well shed for our family, for our friends,\r\nfor our God, for our country, for our kind; the rest is vanity; the rest\r\nis crime.\"[46]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[46] Burke. _Regicide Peace_, vi, 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. FORCE AS A MORAL INSTRUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nForce, in short, has a proper and necessary place in the ethical sphere.\r\nIt is an indispensable instrument of the will to righteousness. The good\r\nman and the good government resolve, in the spirit of the Lord, that\r\ncertain abominations shall not take place. They express their will in a\r\nlaw. That law remains futile, it is a mockery and a fraud, unless they\r\nare prepared to enforce it by all the means in their power, even if need\r\nbe by the shedding of blood. Much, no doubt, can and will be done to\r\nsecure obedience by education, by persuasion, and by appeal. Every\r\neffort will be made to prevent the evildoer, and to convert him to the\r\ngood way. But the fact has to be faced that there are in the world\r\ninsensate scoundrels and hardened malefactors wholly beyond the reach of\r\neducation, persuasion, and appeal; men who have deliberately chosen evil\r\nto be their good, and have made a binding compact with the powers of\r\ndarkness. With them force is the only possible argument. Unless it is\r\napplied, there is nothing to prevent them from dominating the earth,\r\ndefying all law, and establishing the kingdom of the devil. At the back\r\nof all effective law there is, in fact, physical force. Behind the\r\npolice stands the army. The magistrate would be wholly ineffective\r\nwithout the soldier. The criminal population would laugh civilian\r\nrestraints to scorn, if it did not know that out of sight, but never far\r\naway, are the bayonets and the guns of the ultimate defenders of the\r\npeace. The salvation of the criminal is not everything: the salvation of\r\nSociety is more. Society would perish in a day if the basis of force\r\nwere removed from beneath the fabric of law. One of the falsest of false\r\ngeneralizations is that which says that \"force is no remedy.\" It is in\r\nmany cases the only remedy. In other cases it is better than a remedy;\r\nit is a sovereign preventive of wrong. Force is the very essence of\r\ngovernment. By its means countless evils have been suppressed in the\r\npast, such as highway-robbery, private war, duelling, piracy,\r\nslave-trading. Only through fear of it is their recrudescence obviated.\r\nIf a man sees wrongs being perpetrated which he has strength to\r\nprevent--if, for instance, he sees a child being tortured, a woman being\r\noutraged, a helpless fellow-man being set upon and murdered--if he sees\r\nthese things and does not intervene with all his might, then he is not a\r\npacificist but a traitor to humanity, not a man but a contemptible or\r\ninfatuated worm. Similarly if a State stands on one side inactive while\r\nsmall nations are wantonly stamped out of existence, while treaties are\r\nviolated, while International Law is defied, while unprecedented\r\nbarbarities are perpetrated, it sinks to the level of an accomplice in\r\ncrime, and proves itself worthy of the perdition which awaits those who\r\nmake \"the great refusal.\"\r\n\r\nThe days of universal and enduring peace, for whose dawning we all\r\nardently look, will not be ushered in by any diminution of the forces\r\nwielded by the powers of goodness in the world, but rather by their\r\nimmense increase. Just as in our own country the King's Peace became\r\nthe secure possession of every Englishman only when the King's might\r\nbecame irresistible, so in the larger sphere of the Society of Nations\r\nthe world's peace will be firmly established only when it is maintained\r\nby the united forces of all the federated Peoples of goodwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE IDEAL OF THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, then, at the present moment are in the throes of a conflict from\r\nwhich we had no honourable means of escape. Not to have taken our place\r\nby the side of our Allies would have been to break our word, to violate\r\nour faith, to betray the righteous cause. We are doing, at the cost of\r\nawful sacrifice, our high duty; we have before us the noblest of\r\npurposes; we are fighting with hands that are clean, with consciences\r\nthat are clear, and with hearts that are inspired by the courage of\r\nconviction. It is our fervent hope and our faithful belief that if, in\r\nspite of our wicked lack of preparation and our subsequent incredible\r\nfollies, Heaven grants us a good victory, we shall use it to further the\r\nadvance of humanity towards the goal of the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nWhat that kingdom is we are shown in that matchless mosaic of\r\nutterances attributed to Christ, known as the Sermon on the Mount. It is\r\nthe kingdom of righteousness, justice, love, and peace. When, however,\r\nwe study the details of the polity of that kingdom, as they are set\r\nforth in the evangelical picture, we perceive (as the Church Universal\r\nhas always perceived and taught) that they are capable of realization\r\nonly in a Christian society cut off from the world, or in a world become\r\ndominantly Christian. To give to all who ask, to lend indiscriminately\r\nwithout expecting any return, would in society as at present constituted\r\nnot only speedily reduce ourselves to destitution; it would also\r\npauperize and demoralize those into whose hands our squandered wealth\r\nshould pass. To take no thought for the morrow, and to refuse to lay up\r\ntreasure on earth, would under existing economic conditions simply mean\r\nthat we should become useless burdens upon a thrifty and prudent\r\ncommunity. To ignore the legal and judicial institutions of our country\r\nby neither judging nor going to law in cases where wrong has been\r\ninflicted would be to foster the perpetration of crime in a world whose\r\nvery propensity towards crime has necessitated the establishment of the\r\ncourts. Similarly to decline to resist evil, where evil is rampant and\r\naggressive, would be to play the part of a traitor and to surrender the\r\nworld to the devil. The precepts of the Sermon on the Mount, however\r\nliberally they may be interpreted, are, in short, the negation of civil\r\ngovernment; that is to say, they assume the existence of a community of\r\nsanctified persons among whom civil government is unnecessary. The\r\nirreducible minimum of civil government--as even the administrative\r\nnihilists of the school of Herbert Spencer admit--involves three things,\r\nviz., defence of life, protection of property, and enforcement of\r\ncontract. With these three things the precepts of the Sermon on the\r\nMount are, as they stand, incompatible.\r\n\r\nAll this is very obvious, and the consecrated common-sense of the Church\r\nin every age has clearly perceived it. The political science of the\r\nApostles and the Early Fathers, and still more expressly that of their\r\nsuccessors, recognized the authority of kings, the jurisdiction of\r\ncourts, the justice of taxation, the rights of property, the majesty of\r\nhuman law, the protective function of soldiers, and the necessity of\r\nmilitary service. All these were accepted as inevitable in society in\r\nits present state of imperfect development; although it was proclaimed\r\nthat none of them would be required in the ideal Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\nIn the Sermon on the Mount itself, however, the truth as to the\r\nrelativity of Christian institutions is obscured by the faith of the\r\ncompiler that, when he wrote, the second advent of Christ was at hand,\r\nand that the Kingdom of Heaven was immediately to be established. For\r\nhim there was no terrestrial future worthy of consideration; the reign\r\nof the Messiah had already begun; the consummation of all things was\r\nimpending. Hence he did not feel it necessary, or indeed possible, to\r\ndistinguish between the ideal of the perfect day and the practical\r\npolicy of the actual moment. His citizenship already was in Heaven: to\r\nhim present and future were one. The eschatological hopes of the\r\nevangelist were of course speedily dispelled, partly by mere lapse of\r\ntime, partly by the growing wisdom and experience of the Church. The\r\nChurch learned that its early expectation of the speedy and triumphant\r\nreturn of its Lord was ill-founded, and that its task was to convert the\r\nworld to righteousness, not to preside over its immediate dissolution.\r\nHence it accommodated its doctrines and its institutions to the changed\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\nThis fact causes no difficulty to those who believe in the\r\nprogressiveness of revelation. Such as admit that New Testament ethics\r\nshow an advance on those of the Old, will hardly contend that in\r\npolitics any New Testament writer said the last word. What Tolstoy and\r\nhis literalist school call the corruption and secularization of the\r\nChurch was to no small degree a simple recognition of the facts that the\r\nEarth continued to exist, and that the Roman Empire and not the New\r\nJerusalem was the dominant power therein. But though the Church as a\r\nwhole was guided safely through the crisis of disillusionment, it\r\nnevertheless remains unfortunate that the compiler of the Sermon on the\r\nMount should have made the false assumption. For the picture which he\r\npresents of the perfect man and the ideal society is so fascinating and\r\nmagnificent that it is not marvellous that saints and visionaries, in a\r\nlong and pathetic succession, should have repeated his error, should\r\nhave ignored the distinction between present and future, should have\r\nassumed the actual existence of the Divine Kingdom towards which, as a\r\nmatter of fact, mankind has still a weary and protracted pilgrimage to\r\nmake; should have proclaimed the celestial anarchy, and should as a\r\nresult have been overwhelmed in tragic or ludicrous disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE PACIFICIST SUCCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have asserted the present applicability of the full detailed\r\nprogramme of the Sermon on the Mount, and have endeavoured to carry it\r\ninto immediate effect, have been scanty in numbers, and obscure. A few\r\nearly Christian communities, soon extinct; a few hermits isolated from\r\ntheir fellows; a few monks in secluded cloisters; a few friars\r\nrepudiated by their own orders; a few small antinomian Protestant sects\r\nspringing up and vanishing with gourd-like rapidity; a few groups of\r\nSlavonic dreamers forming the innocent extreme of the Nihilist\r\nfraternity--such have been the leading professors of Gospel Anarchy. One\r\ncan, even while condemning them, respect them for their purity of\r\npurpose, their lofty idealism, their sincerity, and their consistency in\r\nfollowing their false premiss to its logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nMuch more numerous, but far less worthy of regard, are those who have\r\npicked and chosen among the precepts of the Lord, have accepted what\r\nseemed good to them and have explained away the rest. It would be easy,\r\ndid space allow, to present a motley succession of fanatics and heretics\r\nfrom apostolic days to the present who have developed fantastic theories\r\nand have maintained them by means of passages drawn from the Sermon on\r\nthe Mount.\r\n\r\n\r\n     No damned error, but some sober brow\r\n     Will bless it, and approve it with a text.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one group, however, now concerns us, and that is the group of\r\nanti-militarists who, for the most part arbitrarily ignoring or\r\nrepudiating the other commands of their authority, fasten on those\r\nprecepts that seem to inculcate the doctrine of non-resistance, and on\r\nthe strength of these erect the visionary superstructure of pacificism.\r\nThey form a strange and suspicious company. Among their early\r\nrepresentatives stand prominent the able advocate, but furious\r\nschismatic, Tertullian; the amiable scholar, but heretically Gnostic,\r\nOrigen; the accomplished stylist, but bigoted and ignorant\r\nspecial-pleader, Lactantius. It would not be a harsh judgment to say\r\nthat most of the early pacificists had some twist of mind or character\r\nthat disturbed the perfect balance of their sanity.\r\n\r\nThe later sects who have included pacificism in fleeting religious\r\nsystems of varying degrees of impossibility and absurdity are still more\r\nopen to suspicion on mental and moral grounds. The Cathari, the\r\nWaldenses, the Anabaptists, and the \"Family of Love,\" not only\r\ndeveloped monstrous doctrines: they also boasted of an antinomian\r\nfreedom from legal restraint which led some of their devotees into such\r\nwild excesses of conduct as made their destruction inevitable. The\r\nFranciscan Tertiaries, who never wholly abjured war, became involved in\r\nthe conflict between the Empire and the Papacy, and departed from their\r\nideal. The more recent Nazarenes in Hungary and Doukhobors in Russia and\r\nCanada have shown themselves, by their refusal to recognize and obey any\r\nform of government, a hopeless nuisance to any community that is\r\nunfortunate enough to be afflicted by their presence. It surely must\r\ngive the present-day pacificists pause, if anything can do so, to find\r\nthemselves mixed up with such a throng. If men are to be judged by their\r\ncompany, they can hardly hope to escape certification.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Society of Friends has a more respectable history.\r\nBut the Society of Friends has for the most part consisted of sensible\r\npersons who have accepted the common Christian interpretation of the\r\nSermon on the Mount, and so have been pacificists of an unusually\r\nmoderate type--by no means unconditional non-resisters. Just as they do\r\nnot give indiscriminately, or lend (especially such of them as are\r\nprosperous bankers) expecting no return, or refrain from judging, or\r\ngoing to law, or laying up treasure on earth, or taking thought for the\r\nmorrow, so they do not interpret literally the command \"resist not\r\nevil.\" They accept the constitution of the country, the government of\r\nwhich is based on force; they pay taxes for the maintenance of the army\r\nand the navy, and admit their necessity; they support the police, and\r\ncall it in if their persons or property are threatened; many of them, to\r\ntheir infinite credit, actually join the fighting forces when they feel\r\nthat great moral issues are at stake. George Fox himself, the founder of\r\nthe Society, was an extremely belligerent and even truculent individual.\r\nHe supported the militant Cromwellian regime, and it was only after the\r\ncollapse of the Puritan Commonwealth, which was based on the force of\r\nthe New Model army, that he abjured all weapons of offence, except his\r\ntongue. Isaac Pennington, his contemporary and friend, was actually a\r\nchaplain in the New Model (which contained many Quakers), and to the\r\nvery end he was engaged in stirring it up to repeat its early exploits\r\nagainst \"Babylon.\" His writings contain the passage: \"I speak not\r\nagainst any magistrates or peoples defending themselves against foreign\r\ninvasions, or making use of the sword to suppress the violent and\r\nevil-doers within their borders; for this the present state of things\r\nmay and doth require.\"[47] A sounder and saner statement of good\r\nChristian teaching on the matter of police and military service one\r\ncould not desire. With this admission in one's mind, one can view with\r\nunqualified admiration the efforts of the Friends to eliminate war, and\r\nto perfect the methods of peace in the intercourse of men. More than\r\nmost Christian people have they laboured effectively to hasten the\r\nadvent of the Kingdom of God. It is true that their attempts in\r\nPennsylvania and elsewhere to establish a pacificist regime have\r\nfailed--it was inevitable that they should fail--but this does not in\r\nany way lessen the debt which the world owes to them for their powerful\r\nand far-reaching influence in favour of love and gentleness and peace.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[47] I quote from J. W. Graham, _War from a Quaker Point of View_, p.\r\n71. See also my review of this book in _Hibbert Journal_, No. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sum of the matter seems to be this. Government is necessary in this\r\npresent evil world. Only by means of sovereign political authority,\r\nbased upon physical as well as moral force, can there be effective\r\n\"punishment of wickedness and vice\" or \"maintenance of true religion\r\nand virtue.\" This is clearly recognized in the Bible, which proclaims\r\nthat \"the powers that be are ordained of God,\" which enjoins obedience\r\nto kings and governors as a religious duty, and which sees in the sword\r\nof justice carried by the secular ruler a weapon directed against the\r\nsame enemies as oppose the establishment of the Kingdom of God. It is\r\nessential for the well-being and even for the existence of society, that\r\ncrime should be suppressed. Hence, in addition to moralists and\r\nministers who seek to educate and convert, there must be police and\r\nsoldiers--in short, the full organized force of the community--ready to\r\nstamp out incorrigible villainy, if need be with blood and iron.\r\nSimilarly, it is essential for the well-being and even for the existence\r\nof the polity of peoples--the growing society of nations--that\r\naggression should be prevented, that treacherous intrigues should be\r\nfrustrated, that treaty engagements should be enforced, that the reign\r\nof law should be confirmed. But, in order to realize this end, there is\r\nneed not only of pacific missions and cosmopolitan congresses, but also\r\nof an armed might sufficient to prevent or to punish with irresistible\r\ncertainty breaches of international conventions and violations of the\r\nWorld's peace. Hence, whether we have regard to internal good\r\ngovernment, or the maintenance of international justice, the need of\r\nmilitary force is imperative. Not only does there exist what the\r\nRussians quaintly call a \"Christ-serving and worthy militancy,\" there\r\nare occasions, of which the present is one, when military service\r\nbecomes the highest form of Christian duty. To hold aloof is not to\r\ndisplay a superior form of Christianity; it is to be an apostate. As\r\nSolovyof has impressively shown in his notable conversations on _War and\r\nChristianity_, pacificism under present conditions is that very sort of\r\nreligious imposture with which is associated the abominable name of\r\nAntichrist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AND ITS RIVALS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE IDEA OF THE STATE IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our recent political troubles are attributable to what Fortescue\r\nin the fifteenth century called \"lack of governance.\" We are all of us\r\npainfully aware of the fact; but we are not all of us equally conscious\r\nthat the feebleness and inefficiency of our supreme administration are\r\nto no small extent due to the absence among our people as a whole of any\r\nadequate idea of the position and function of the State. For if it is\r\ntrue generally that every nation has the sort of government that it\r\ndeserves, it is specially true of a nation with democratic institutions.\r\nWeaknesses of intellect, infirmities of will, and faults of character in\r\nthe sovereign representative assembly are but reproductions on a\r\nmagnified scale of the same defects in the electorate. It is the failure\r\nof our people as a whole to realize the idea of the State that has\r\nresulted in the filling of the House of Commons with men who stand, not\r\nfor the Nation in its unity and the Empire in its integrity, but for all\r\nsorts of limited and conflicting sectional interests--parties, leagues,\r\nfellowships, unions, cliques, schools, churches, orders, classes,\r\ntrusts, syndicates, and so on. No wonder that in times of national and\r\nimperial crisis such representatives prove totally unequal to the duty\r\nof strong, corporate, and patriotic administration.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the idea of the State among the peoples of the British\r\nIsles is explicable on geographical and historical grounds. For the idea\r\nof the State--that is to say, the idea of society politically organized\r\nas an indivisible unit under a sovereign government--although it has\r\nother and deeper sources of vitality, is specially fostered by a sense\r\nof national danger, but tends to languish when complete immunity from\r\nexternal peril can be postulated. Never has the realization of \"the\r\ncommonwealth of this realm of England\" been so strong as it was in the\r\ndays when Spanish invasion threatened. The splendid patriotism of that\r\ngreat age is portrayed for all time in the immortal glory of\r\nShakespeare's historical plays. Not far short, however, rose the\r\npatriotic realization of national unity during the crisis of the\r\nNapoleonic struggle. Wordsworth's magnificent _Sonnets dedicated_ to\r\nLiberty remain as the enduring memorial of the heights which British\r\nState-consciousness then attained:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       In our halls is hung\r\n     Armoury of the invincible knights of old:\r\n     We must be free or die, who speak the tongue\r\n     That Shakespeare spoke; the faith and morals hold\r\n     Which Milton held. In everything we are sprung\r\n     Of Earth's first blood, have titles manifold.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, except at rare intervals, Britain's insular position has given her\r\npeople so soothing a sense of security that they have allowed the\r\nconception of the commonwealth to droop, and have tended to regard the\r\nState as, under normal conditions, a nuisance which should as far as\r\npossible be abated, as an intruder into the sphere of private enterprise\r\nwhich should be extruded, as an enemy to liberty which should be\r\nsuppressed. It may readily be admitted that in days before the State had\r\nbeen democratized this hostile attitude was not without justification.\r\nIn the early seventeenth century, for instance, the State meant the\r\nStuart monarch--_L'État c'est Moi_--and the interests of the Stuart\r\nmonarch were by no means those of any of the nations that he governed.\r\nIn the early eighteenth century the State meant the Whig oligarchy, and\r\nits members only too easily came to regard the welfare of the Empire as\r\nidentical with their own prosperity. In the early nineteenth century the\r\nState meant the landed and moneyed magnates of the Tory aristocracy, and\r\nthey had an extremely inadequate apprehension of the needs and\r\naspirations of the rapidly increasing millions over whom they exercised\r\nauthority. Hence one can understand that opposition to the policy of\r\nStuart king, or Whig nobility, or Tory plutocracy, readily took the form\r\nof antagonism to the State as such. Thus the political theory of Milton\r\nand the Puritans not only justified resistance to Charles I, it also\r\nproclaimed a doctrine of the natural rights of the individual fatal to\r\nall types of government. Similarly the political theory of Adam Smith\r\nand the _laissez-faire_ economists, together with that of their\r\ncontemporaries, Bentham and the utilitarian philosophers, not only\r\nattacked the restrictive regulations of the Whig oligarchy, but showed\r\non general principles the strongest dislike of what it called \"State\r\ninterference\" in all circumstances. So, too, Herbert Spencer and the\r\nnineteenth century school of scientific individualists not only\r\ndemonstrated (as they did with extraordinary pungency and success) the\r\nextreme folly and incompetence of the main government departments of\r\ntheir own day; they also sought to establish the eternal and inevitable\r\nantagonism of Man versus the State, and to limit universally the\r\nfunctions of government to the irreducible minimum.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of hostility, however, ceased to have its old\r\njustification with the advent of democracy. The Reform Acts of 1832,\r\n1867, and 1884 have so enlarged the electorate as to convert government\r\ninto something approaching self-government, and the State has become the\r\norganized form of democracy itself. Hence the individualism of Milton,\r\nAdam Smith, Bentham, and Spencer is an anachronism. It is not\r\nremarkable, then, that, following Parliamentary Reform, the idea of the\r\nState revived in Britain with new force and in a new form--no longer\r\nstimulated by the pressure of extreme peril, but excited by the new\r\npossibilities of corporate democratic activity. The young lions of the\r\nFabian Society in their optimistic infancy were filled with the idea of\r\nthe State, and advocated State action in wide spheres of industrial\r\norganization, municipal enterprise, and social reform. The Imperial\r\nFederation League gloried anew in the name of Britain, and strove to\r\nbring the four quarters of the earth within the circle of a\r\nself-conscious Empire. Later on, the Tariff Reform League demanded\r\nState-control and regulation of our world-wide commerce.\r\n\r\nBut the revival of the idea of the State, under the stimulus of\r\nSocialists, Imperialists, Protectionists, and others, was short lived.\r\nAll these enthusiasts became disappointed and disgusted with democracy\r\nand with the State which it controls. Democracy did not move fast enough\r\nfor them, nor always in the direction that they desired. Hence--and most\r\nmarkedly since the dawn of the twentieth century--a reaction against the\r\nState has set in. There has been, as we have already seen, an epidemic\r\nof passive resistance. Individualists of all sorts, together with Trade\r\nUnionists, Syndicalists, Clericals, Suffragists, No-Conscriptionists,\r\nUlstermen, Nationalists, and other bodies, giving up the attempt to\r\nconvert democracy and to secure their ends through the sovereign agency\r\nof the democratic State, are taking direct action, are proclaiming rival\r\nauthorities to the State, and are threatening the very existence of the\r\nbody politic. The outlook is ominous, and it needs to be steadily faced.\r\nThe present moment, moreover, is peculiarly favourable for its\r\nconsideration. For the sudden and unexpected return of extreme national\r\ndanger has once again quickened in our midst the idea of the State, has\r\nrevived the spirit of patriotism, has restored the national unity, and\r\nhas reenforced the principle of civic service. We can see under the\r\nrevealing searchlight of the war the anarchy towards which we have been\r\ndrifting during the past ten or more years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE RIVALS OF THE STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first rival of the State that calls for consideration is the\r\nIndividual. His rights as against the government are still loudly\r\nproclaimed. \"The chief message of 1915,\" says one of our leading\r\nindividualists, Rev. Dr. Clifford, in a New Year's oration to his\r\nflock,[48] \"is a clarion call to guard our personal and democratic\r\nliberties against the attacks of State absolutism.\" The idea of guarding\r\n\"democratic liberties\" against democracy itself is, of course, mere\r\nnonsense--one of those point-blank contradictions in terms which, though\r\nfull of sound and fury, signify nothing. It is, however, unfortunately,\r\ntypical of much of the loose thinking and vague talking indulged in by\r\nthe leaders of those pestilent anti-patriotic unions and fellowships\r\nwhich infest and harass the country at the present moment. The idea of\r\nguarding \"personal liberties\" against democracy is not so palpably\r\nabsurd; it does not involve a contradiction in terms. Moreover, it\r\nappears to have some relation to the admitted fact that the rule of a\r\ndemocracy may press very heavily upon some or all of its constituent\r\nmembers. Nevertheless, it is equally fallacious. It rests upon a false\r\nantithesis between the individual and the community to which he belongs.\r\nNo such antithesis exists. \"The individual,\" rightly says Mr. W. S.\r\nMcKechnie, \"apart from all relations to the community is a\r\nnegation.\"[49] In similar strain, Mr. E. Barker contends that \"a full\r\nand just conception of the individual abolishes the supposed opposition\r\nbetween the Man and the State.\"[50] Long ago Hegel exclaimed: \"Our life\r\nis hid with our fellows in the common life of our people,\" and his true\r\nand fruitful conception forms the basis of the political philosophy of\r\nT. H. Green, F. H. Bradley, and Bernard Bosanquet. It is, also, the\r\nfoundation of all that is good and enduring in present-day Socialism.\r\nThe individual apart from society is a mere abstraction, like the\r\n\"economic man\" of the old economists.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are these so-called \"personal liberties\" which the\r\nindividual is supposed to possess in virtue of his humanity and\r\nindependently of any authority external to himself? If it is said that\r\nthey are freedom of thought, freedom of emotion, and freedom of will,\r\nthe criticism is that these are not \"liberties\" at all, but merely\r\nmovements of the mind which no power whatsoever external to the\r\nindividual can possibly control, and with which no political authority\r\nin the country would ever dream of attempting to interfere. If, however,\r\nit is said that they include further such things as freedom of speech,\r\nfreedom of writing, freedom of public meeting, freedom to act generally\r\nas conscience dictates, the criticism is that such liberties as these\r\nare not \"personal\" merely, or even primarily: they are liberties that\r\nprofoundly affect the community. Regarded from the communal point of\r\nview, in fact, they are not \"personal liberties\" at all, if by that term\r\nis meant individual rights. They are rights derived from the community;\r\nthey are concessions to be granted or withheld according to the\r\nrequirements of public policy; they are matters of regulation by the\r\ncommon will. Society does not, and cannot, recognize the existence,\r\nindependent of its own consent, of any such so-called \"personal\r\nliberties.\" It does not, and cannot, admit the possession by individuals\r\nof any rights, inherent and indefeasible, to do as they like in matters\r\nthat concern the interests of the community generally. Still less can\r\nthe State be expected to protect individuals in the exercise of\r\nactivities which it regards as detrimental, or in the neglect of duties\r\nwhich it regards as essential, to the general well-being. It cannot\r\nrestrain anyone's conscience; but it must control everyone's conduct.\r\nAll this, of course, is the commonplace of political theory, and it is\r\ncurious that at this late day one should have to repeat Burke's\r\ndestructive criticism of metaphysic liberties, or Bentham's damning\r\nexposure of the \"anarchic fallacy\" of the Rights of Man, or Mr. D. L.\r\nRitchie's quite recent dissipation of the errors underlying the idea of\r\nNatural Rights. But it is still more curious that many of the men who\r\nrevive against the modern democratic State this long-laid ghost of\r\neighteenth-century individualism call themselves Socialists, and invoke\r\nthe State (when it suits them to do so) to embark on all manner of\r\nanti-individualistic enterprises. This anomaly, however, is merely one\r\namong many flagrant instances of that ignorance of precedent which\r\nrevives long-buried heresies, that incapacity for thought which seems\r\nunaware of inconsistencies, or that shameless perversity which seeks out\r\nand proclaims any sort of general principle which happens to suit the\r\nexigencies of the moment.\r\n\r\nA second rival to the State is Political Party. At the present juncture\r\nthere are four important political parties in existence in the British\r\nIsles, viz., Liberal, Conservative, Nationalist, Labour, beside various\r\nincipient ones. The two old parties, Liberal and Conservative, stand for\r\nmore or less clearly defined and sharply opposed general principles.\r\nHallam has described them as the party of progress and the party of\r\norder respectively; and he (followed by Macaulay and other writers) has\r\ndevoted a good deal of care to the elucidation of the fundamental\r\ndifferences between them. These old parties are by far the most vital\r\nand powerful political entities in the United Kingdom. They have\r\ndeep-rooted traditions, efficient organizations, large funds secretly\r\nraised and administered, formulated programmes, and all the\r\nparaphernalia of habitations, catchwords, and badges calculated to\r\nexcite loyalty and stimulate zeal. They secure in alternation the\r\ncontrol of the State, and administer in the name of the nation as a\r\nwhole the vast affairs of the British Empire. It may be at once\r\nadmitted that parties such as these are inevitable in any system of\r\nrepresentative government. For so long as fundamental differences of\r\nopinion exist among electors, it is only by means of organizations based\r\non the primary opposing principles that any working constitution can be\r\nframed. To attack party-government as such is vain and even absurd.\r\nNevertheless, party has become the rival of the State; and its rivalry\r\nis all the more dangerous and insidious because it always professes to\r\nact in the interests of the State and on behalf of the nation as a\r\nwhole. Its professions, however, have become false and hypocritical. In\r\nthe name of the People it seeks its own gain. It has ceased to be a\r\nmeans to good democratic government, and has grown to be an end in\r\nitself. In its rivalry to other parties, in its struggle for power, in\r\nits scramble for the spoils of office, in its eagerness to secure votes,\r\nit has debased political ideals, it has corrupted citizenship, it has\r\nabandoned truth, it has proclaimed smooth lies, it has betrayed the\r\nState, it has almost destroyed the nation. Happy indeed will it be if\r\nthis war, which is revealing to us the hideousness and deadliness of the\r\nparty-spirit, enables us to reduce the old parties to their proper place\r\nof subordination to the State.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two old parties, however, there are two\r\ncomparatively new ones which occupy places of importance in the world of\r\npolitics. These are the Nationalist and the Labour parties. Neither of\r\nthese professes to make the interests of the State its prime concern.\r\nThe one concentrates its energies upon a struggle to advance the cause\r\nof a single nation from among the four that constitute the United\r\nKingdom; the other devotes itself to the affairs of a single social\r\nclass. The existence of these powerful sectional organizations is a\r\ndisastrous portent. They stand, not as the old parties do for divergent\r\nviews concerning the interests of the State as a whole, but for mortal\r\nschism in the body politic. Never can there be a full return to healthy\r\nnational life until means have been found for reabsorbing these and\r\nother incipient schismatic organizations into the unity of the Great\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nA third rival to the State has recently come into prominence in the\r\nshape of a number of various non-political corporations which claim to\r\npossess an organic existence independent of, and co-ordinate with, the\r\nState, and thus deny the right of the State to intrude within the\r\nspheres of their operations. The most important are the Syndicalists,\r\nwho proclaim the autonomy of the industrial union or guild, and the\r\nEcclesiastics, who assert the autonomy of the denationalized church.\r\nBoth agree in repudiating political control, and in abjuring the use of\r\npolitical instruments. They rely upon \"direct action\" of their own, the\r\none employing the terrors of the general strike to overawe the\r\ncommunity, the other the horrors of hell. Now it may be freely granted\r\nthat one of the most notable advances in modern political theory has\r\nbeen the recognition of the fact that men naturally organize themselves\r\ninto groups--families, clans, tribes; sects, societies, churches;\r\nguilds, trade unions, clubs, and so on--and that the State is rather a\r\nfederation of groups than an association of isolated individuals. It may\r\nbe granted, secondly, that some of these organizations are anterior to\r\nthe State in point of time, and that they deal with matters that are not\r\nappropriate for direct State control. Finally, it may be granted that\r\nthe State will be well advised to leave some or all of them in\r\npossession of large powers of self-administration. Nevertheless, when\r\nonce the Great Society has come into existence, and has organized itself\r\nas the National State, they must, if anarchy is to be avoided, all take\r\ntheir places as constituent members of the community, and recognize that\r\nthey exercise such autonomous powers as they possess in virtue of the\r\npermission of the general will. The State, however prudently it may\r\nemploy its powers, must be, and must be universally admitted to be, in\r\nall causes, civil or ecclesiastical, throughout all its dominions, in\r\nthe last resort, supreme. In the interests of the common good it cannot\r\ntolerate any rivals.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] Reported in _Daily Chronicle_, January 4th, 1916.\r\n\r\n[49] McKechnie. _The State and the Individual_, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[50] Barker. _Political Thought from Spencer to the Present-Day_, p.\r\n108.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. WHAT THE STATE IS AND DOES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the purification and exaltation of the Democratic National State\r\nrests the one hope of the salvation of Britain and the Empire. In a\r\nfederation of Democratic National States resides the best prospect of\r\nthe future peaceful and well-ordered government of the world. The\r\nindividualism of Dr. Clifford leads straight to anarchy; the unchecked\r\ndevelopment of the party-system means the corrupt tyranny of the caucus;\r\nthe triumph of Syndicalism would involve the tragedy of class war; the\r\ndream of the reunion of humanity in the bosom of a cosmopolitan church\r\nis a vain revival of a mediæval illusion. The individual must be brought\r\nto recognize that politically he has no separate existence, and must\r\nlearn to limit his operations to his proper share in the constitution\r\nand determination of the general will; party must be remorselessly\r\nreduced to its legitimate subordination to the interests of the\r\ncommunity as a whole; syndicates and trade unions must be prevented from\r\ncutting themselves loose from the body of the nation, must be compelled\r\nto recognize the supremacy of the law of the land, and must be deprived\r\nof any inequitable privileges which they may have secured; ecclesiastics\r\nof all orders must be persuaded to rest content with such autonomy as\r\nthe general will may grant them, and must strive to become, not a\r\nseparate corporation, but the indwelling and directing conscience of the\r\npeople. The State must be supreme.\r\n\r\nWhat is the State which is thus exalted above all rivals? Let Mr.\r\nBernard Bosanquet answer. \"The State,\" he says, \"is not merely the\r\npolitical fabric. The term 'State' accents indeed the political aspect\r\nof the whole, and is opposed to the notion of an anarchic society. But\r\nit includes the entire hierarchy of institutions by which life is\r\ndetermined, from the family to the trade, and from the trade to the\r\nchurch and the university. It includes all of them, not as the mere\r\ncollection of the growths of the country, but as the structures which\r\ngive life and meaning to the political whole, while receiving from it\r\nmutual adjustment, and therefore expansion and a more liberal air.\"[51]\r\nIn a similar strain T. H. Green says: \"The State is for its members, the\r\nsociety of societies, the society in which all their claims upon each\r\nother are mutually adjusted.\"[52] The keynote of both of these profound\r\nutterances is \"adjustment.\" They recognize the fact that the convictions\r\nand opinions of individuals differ, that the purposes of parties\r\nconflict, that the interests of racial units and social classes diverge\r\nfrom one another, that the demands of churches are mutually\r\nirreconcilable. They recognize further that unless individuals, parties,\r\nraces, classes, churches agree in acknowledging the adjusting authority\r\nof the general will of the community to which all belong, endless\r\nstruggle and hopeless chaos must supervene. No pretension is made that\r\nthe State is of supernatural origin; no claim to divine right is\r\nadvanced. It is admitted that the State at one time did not exist. It is\r\nforeseen that a day may come when it will be merged in a still larger\r\ncommunity. But for the present it is the only possible organ by means of\r\nwhich the common will can operate in the interests of the common good.\r\nThe basis of its claim for obedience rests upon the facts, first, that\r\nevery individual subject, and every organized group of subjects, owes to\r\nthe State, and to it alone, the conditions that make existence possible,\r\nand secondly, that only as a member of the State can the individual\r\nattain to his full development, and only under the protection of the\r\nState can the group achieve its purposes. The attainment of the common\r\ngood, as that good is conceived of by the common intelligence, and by\r\nmeans which the common will determines--such is the ideal of the\r\nDemocratic National State. Here surely is a sphere in which every man\r\ncan find the fullness of life.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[51] Bosanquet. _Philosophical Theory of the State_, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[52] Green. _Principles of Political Obligation_, p. 146.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE SPHERE OF NATIONAL SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above statement of the ideal of the Democratic National State brings\r\nhome to the mind a realization of the magnitude of the sphere which lies\r\nopen to National Service in the broad sense of the term. Democracy is\r\nsovereign; although it is flouted by individuals, deluded and debauched\r\nby parties, and challenged by separatist syndicates. It must remain\r\nsovereign, and its sovereignty must be made a more real, more conscious,\r\nand more effective thing than it has ever been before. Rarely, however,\r\nhas there been a sovereign less adequately equipped than democracy for\r\nits gigantic responsibilities. One of its most enthusiastic modern\r\nsupporters, Professor John MacCunn, gravely admits that \"Democracy,\r\nstill raw to its work, whether in politics or industry, may blunder--may\r\nblunder fatally.\"[53] Long ago it was pointed out by Plato that\r\ndemocracy is the cult of incompetence. In more recent times Mill has\r\nemphasized the possibility that democracy may govern badly and\r\noppressively; Maine has warned us that the dominance of the commonalty\r\nmay end in the triumph of the mediocre, and a more than Chinese\r\nstagnation; Carlyle has denounced democracy as powerful for destruction,\r\nbut impotent for building up, as helpless in the face of great\r\nemergencies, as incapable of choosing good leaders; Lecky has\r\ndemonstrated the danger of the corruption of the democracy by evil\r\npoliticians; Belloc has shown how it tends to develop, and then become a\r\nslave to, a bureaucracy; Graham Wallas has portrayed the psychological\r\nperil of its hypnotization by colours and claptrap. All the dangers thus\r\nenumerated are real and formidable. They have, however, to be faced and\r\novercome by men of goodwill: for there is now no alternative to\r\ndemocracy but anarchy. Fortunately they may be faced in confidence and\r\nhope. For the British democracy--as the revealing crisis of this great\r\nwar has shown--is sound at heart, is eager to be delivered from its\r\nbetrayers, and is longing to learn. It calls pathetically for those who\r\nknow to teach it, and for those who can to lead it. Here, then, is the\r\nsphere of National Service. Who will not come forward to help democracy\r\nto become conscious of its power and its dignity; to aid it in\r\nestablishing its authority over all rebels and rivals; to teach it how\r\nto use its omnipotence gently, so as to leave to those beneath its sway\r\nthe largest possible room for freedom consistent with the common good;\r\nto make it aware of its responsibilities for its vast dominions across\r\nthe seas and their teeming populations; to awaken it to a realization of\r\nthe extent to which the whole future of the human race rests upon the\r\nsuccess of its experiment in government? It is in the service of such a\r\nsovereign as this, and in the pursuit of such an ideal, that faithful\r\nsouls attain that self-realization which is perfect freedom.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[53] MacCunn. _Six Radical Thinkers_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN CITY PRESS LTD., LETCHWORTH, ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBOOKS ON THE ORIGINS & PROGRESS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n+MY YEAR OF THE WAR.+ Including an account of experiences with the troops\r\nin France, and the record of a visit to the Grand Fleet, which is here\r\ngiven for the first time in complete form.
