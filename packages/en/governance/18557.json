Democracy,\r\nlike a beautiful civilization, is sweeping over all the earth. From\r\nPortugal comes the news of a monarchy that is taking on democratic\r\nforms. Turkey has announced the liberty of the printing press, Russia is\r\nplanning a new system of popular education, China is in process of\r\nadopting a constitutional government, with a cabinet responsible to the\r\npeople. Unless one reads the newspapers in many languages, the observer\r\nwill miss daily some new victory for democracy. Great changes are on\r\nalso for the Republic. Now that the Civil War is fifty years away, the\r\nnew North and the new South represent a solid nation. Indeed, if every\r\nNorthern soldier were to die to-day, not one interest or liberty of this\r\nRepublic would be permitted to suffer by the sons of the Confederate\r\nsoldiers, who would defend the nation unto blood as bravely as men born\r\nnorth of Mason and Dixon's line--indeed, who fought gallantly for it in\r\nthe Cuban war. The North has entered upon a new industrial epoch, but\r\nthe South also is in the midst of its greatest industrial movement, and\r\nin sight of its enlargement, by reason of the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nThe Western Continent is not large, but it holds more than half the farm\r\nland of the planet, and it is already evident that the United States and\r\nCanada, with their free institutions, will indirectly and directly\r\ncontrol the thousand millions of people that will soon live between the\r\nAleutian Islands of Alaska, and Cape Horn. The one question of the hour\r\nis how to make all the coming millions patriots towards their country,\r\nscholars towards the intellect, obedient citizens towards the laws of\r\nnature and God. Our national peril is Mammonism, and the sordid pursuit\r\nof gold. Our fathers came hither in pursuit of God and liberty,--not\r\ngold and territory. Sixty of our present ninety millions of people have\r\nentered the earthly scene since the Civil War. Our young men and women,\r\nand the children of foreign born peoples need to open the pages of\r\nhistory, setting forth the great men and events of the Anti-Slavery\r\nepoch in this land.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for the teachers in the schoolroom and the preachers\r\nin their pulpits to assemble the youth of the nation, and drill them in\r\nthe history of industrial democracy, and of political liberty. If our\r\nyouth are to make the twentieth century glorious, they must realize the\r\ncontinuity of our institutions, and often return to the nineteenth\r\ncentury and the Anti-Slavery epoch. The phrase, \"For God, home and\r\nnative land,\" is often on the lips of our teachers. Love towards God\r\ngives religion; the love of home gives marriage; the love of country,\r\npatriotism. But patriotism is a fire that must be fed with the fuel of\r\nideas. These chapters are written in the belief that the youth of to-day\r\nwill find in the history of their fathers a storehouse filled with seed\r\nfor a world sowing, an armoury filled with weapons for to-morrow's\r\nbattle, a library rich with wisdom for the morrow's emergency, a\r\ncathedral, bright with memorials of yesterday's heroes, its soldiers and\r\nscholars, its statesmen, and above all, its martyred President.\r\n\r\n                       NEWELL DWIGHT HILLIS.\r\n\r\n  _Plymouth Church,\r\n   Brooklyn, N.

That war was fought,\r\nnot in the interest of territory or of national honour,--it was fought\r\nby the white race for the enfranchisement of the black race, and to show\r\nthat a democratic government, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal, could permanently endure.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, the Great Rebellion seems the mightiest battle and the\r\nmost glorious victory in the annals of time. The battle-field was a\r\nthousand miles in length; the combatants numbered two million men; the\r\nstruggle was protracted over four years; the hillsides of the whole\r\nSouth were made billowy with the country's dead; a million men were\r\nkilled or wounded in the two thousand two hundred battles; thousands of\r\ngifted boys who might have permanently enriched the North and South\r\nalike, through literature, art or science, were cut off as unfulfilled\r\nprophecies in the beginning of their career, and what is more pathetic,\r\nanother million women, desolate and widowed, remained to look with\r\naltered eyes upon an altered world, while alone they walked their Via\r\nDolorosa. In the physical realm the black shadow of the sun's eclipse\r\nremains but for a few minutes, but through four awful years the nation\r\ndwelt in blackness and dreadful night, while fifty more years passed,\r\nand the shadow has not yet disappeared fully from the land.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the Civil War began with the debate between Daniel\r\nWebster and Calhoun in 1830. These intellectual giants set the battle\r\nlines in array in the halls of the Senate. The warfare that began with\r\narguments in Congress was soon transferred to the lyceum and lecture\r\nhall, then to the pulpit and press, then to the assembly rooms of State\r\nlegislatures, until finally it was submitted to the soldiers. At last\r\nGrant, Sherman and Thomas witnessed to the truth of Webster's argument,\r\nthat the Union is one and inseparable, that it should endure now and\r\nforever, but the endorsement was written with the sword's point, and in\r\nletters of blood. The conflict raged, therefore, for thirty-five years,\r\nand some of the most desperate battles were fought not with guns and\r\ncannon, but with arguments, in the presence of assembled thousands, who\r\nlistened to the intellectual attack and defense. In their famous debate,\r\nLincoln and Douglas were over against one another like two fortresses,\r\nbristling with bayonets, and with cannon shotted to the muzzle.\r\n\r\nThe many millions of people in the United States, born or immigrated\r\nhere since the Civil War, busied with many things during this rich,\r\ncomplex and prosperous era, have suffered a grievous loss, through the\r\nweakening of their patriotism. Multitudes have forgotten that with great\r\nprice their fathers bought our industrial liberty for white and black\r\nalike. The study of no era, perhaps, is so rewarding to the youth of the\r\ncountry as the study of the Anti-Slavery epoch. It was an era of\r\nintellectual giants and moral heroes. Great men walked in regiments up\r\nand down the land. It was the age of our greatest statesmen of the North\r\nand South,--Webster and Calhoun; of our greatest soldiers,--Grant,\r\nSherman, Thomas and Sheridan, and of Lee and Stonewall Jackson. It was\r\nthe era of our greatest orators, Phillips and Beecher; of our greatest\r\neditors, led by Greeley and Raymond; of our greatest poets and scholars,\r\nWhittier and Lowell and Emerson; and of our greatest President, the\r\nMartyr of Emancipation. So wonderful are those scenes named Gettysburg,\r\nAppomattox, and the room where the Emancipation Act was signed, that\r\neven the most skeptical have felt that the issues of liberty and life\r\nfor millions of slaves justified the entrance of a Divine Figure upon\r\nthe human battle-field. This Unseen Leader and Captain of the host had\r\ndipped His sword in heaven, and carried a blade that was red with\r\ninsufferable wrath against oppression, cruelty and wrong.\r\n\r\nNow that fifty years have passed since the Civil War, the events of that\r\nconflict have taken on their true perspective, and movements once\r\nclouded have become clear. For great men and nations alike, the\r\nsuggestive hours are the critical hours and epochs. That was a critical\r\nepoch for Athens, when Demosthenes plead the cause of the republic, and\r\ninsisted that Athens must defend her liberties, her art, her laws, her\r\nsocial institutions, and in the spirit of democracy resist the tyrant\r\nPhilip, who came with gifts in his hands. That was a critical hour for\r\nbrave little Holland, dreaming her dreams of liberty,--when the burghers\r\nresisted the regiments of bloody Alva, and, clinging to the dykes with\r\ntheir finger-tips, fought their way back to the fields, expelled Philip\r\nof Spain, and, having no fortresses, lifted up their hands and\r\nexclaimed, \"These are our bayonets and walls of defense!\" Big with\r\ndestiny also for this republic was that critical hour when Lincoln, in\r\nhis first inaugural, pleaded with the South not to destroy the Union,\r\nnor to turn their cannon against the free institutions that seemed \"the\r\nlast, best hope of men.\" But the eyes of the men of the South were\r\nholden, and they were drunk with passion. They lighted the torch that\r\nkindled a conflagration making the Southern city a waste and the rich\r\ncotton-field a desolation.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning, the founders and fathers of the nation were under\r\nthe delusion that it was possible to unite in one land two antagonistic\r\nprinciples,--liberty and slavery. It has been said that the Republic,\r\nfounded in New England, was nothing but an attempt to translate into\r\nterms of prose the dreams that haunted the soul of John Milton his long\r\nlife through. The founders believed that every man must give an account\r\nof himself to God, and because his responsibility was so great, they\r\nfelt that he must be absolutely free. Since no king, no priest, and no\r\nmaster could give an account for him, he must be self-governing in\r\npolitics, self-controlling in industry, and free to go immediately into\r\nthe presence of God with his penitence and his prayer. The fathers\r\nsought religious and political freedom,--not money or lands. But the new\r\ntemple of liberty was to be for the white race alone, and these builders\r\nof the new commonwealth never thought of the black man, save as a\r\nservant in the house. For more than two centuries, therefore, the wheat\r\nand the tares grew together in the soil. When the tares began to choke\r\nout the wheat, the uprooting of the foul growth became inevitable.\r\nPerhaps the Civil War was a necessity,--for this reason, the disease of\r\nslavery had struck in upon the vitals of the nation and the only cure\r\nwas the surgeon's knife. Therefore God raised up soldiers, and anointed\r\nthem as surgeons, with \"the ointment of war, black and sulphurous.\"\r\n\r\nBy a remarkable coincidence, the year that brought a slave ship to\r\nJamestown, Virginia, brought the _Mayflower_ and the Pilgrim fathers to\r\nPlymouth Rock. It is a singular fact that the star of hope and the orb\r\nof night rose at one and the same hour upon the horizon. At first the\r\nrich men of London counted the Virginia tobacco a luxury, but the weed\r\nsoon became a necessity, and the captain of the African ship exchanged\r\none slave for ten huge bales of tobacco. A second cargo of slaves\r\nbrought even larger dividends to the owners of the slave ship. Soon the\r\nstory of the financial returns of the traffic began to inflame the\r\navarice of England, Spain and Portugal. The slave trade was exalted to\r\nthe dignity of commerce in wheat and flour, coal and iron. Just as ships\r\nare now built to carry China's tea and silk, India's indigo and spices,\r\nso ships were built in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for the\r\nkidnapping of African slaves, and the sale of these men to the sugar and\r\ncotton planters of the West Indies and of America. Even the stories of\r\nthe gold and diamond fields of South Africa and Alaska have had less\r\npower to inflame men's minds than the stories of the black men in the\r\nforests of Africa, every one of whom was good for twenty guineas.\r\n\r\nThe London of 1700 experienced a boom in slave stocks as the London of\r\n1900 in rubber stocks. Merchants and captains, after a few years'\r\nabsence, returned to London to buy houses, carriages and gold plate, and\r\nby their political largesses to win the title of baronet, and even seats\r\nin the House of Lords. This illusion of gold finally fell upon the\r\nthrone itself, and King William and Queen Mary lent the traffic royal\r\npatronage. At the very time when men in Boston, exultant over the\r\nsuccess of their experiment in democracy, were writing home to London\r\nabout this ideal republic of God that had been set up at Plymouth, and\r\nthe orb of liberty began to flame with light and hope for New England,\r\nthis other orb began to fling out its rays of sorrow, disease and death\r\nacross Africa and the southern sands.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1713, Queen Anne, in the Treaty of Utrecht, after a long\r\nand arduous series of diplomatic negotiations, secured for the English\r\nthrone a monopoly of the slave traffic, and the writers of the time\r\nspoke of this treaty as an event that would make the queen's name to be\r\neulogized as long as time should last. But two hundred years have\r\nreversed the judgment of the civilized world. History now recalls Queen\r\nAnne's monopoly of the slave traffic as it recalls the Black Death in\r\nEngland, the era of smallpox in Scotland,--for one such treaty is\r\nprobably equal to two bubonic plagues, or three epidemics of cholera and\r\nyellow fever.\r\n\r\nFinally, an informal agreement was entered upon between the English\r\nslave dealers, the Spaniards and Portuguese,--an agreement that was\r\nliterally a \"covenant with death and a compact with hell.\" The\r\nPortuguese became the explorers of the interior, the advance agents of\r\nthe traffic, who reported what tribes had the tallest, strongest men,\r\nand the most comely women. The Spaniards maintained the slave stations\r\non the coast, and took over from the Portuguese the gangs of slaves who\r\nwere chained together and driven down to the coast; the English slave\r\ndealers owned the ships, bought the slaves at wholesale, transported the\r\nwretches across the sea, and retailed the poor creatures to the planters\r\nof the various colonies. Between 1620 and 1770 three million slaves were\r\ndriven in gangs down to the African seacoast, and transported to the\r\ncolonies. At this time some of the greatest houses in London, Lisbon and\r\nMadrid were founded, and some of the greatest family names were\r\nestablished during these one hundred and fifty years when the slave\r\ntraffic was most prosperous. De Bau thinks that another 250,000 slaves\r\nperished during the voyages across the sea. For the eighteenth century\r\nwas a century of cruelty as well as gold,--of crime and art,--of\r\nmurderous hate and increasing commerce. If the prophet Daniel had been\r\ndescribing the Spain, Portugal and England of that time, he would have\r\nportrayed them as an image of mud and gold,--but chiefly mud. Little\r\nwonder that Thomas Jefferson, in his \"Notes on Virginia,\" treating of\r\nthe influence and possible consequences of slavery, wrote, \"Indeed, I\r\ntremble for my country when I reflect that God is just.\" As England\r\nanchored war-ships in the harbour of Shanghai, and forced the opium\r\ntraffic upon China, so she forced the slave traffic upon the American\r\ncolonies by gun and cannon. The story of the English kings who crowded\r\nslavery upon the South makes up one of the blackest pages in the history\r\nof a country that has been like unto a sower who went forth to sow with\r\none hand the good seed of liberty and justice, while with the other she\r\nsowed the tares of slavery and oppression.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, the climate and the general atmosphere of the\r\nNorth was unfriendly to slavery, just as the cotton, sugar and indigo,\r\nas well as the warm climate of the South encouraged slave labour. At\r\nfirst, neither Boston nor New York associated wrong with the custom of\r\nbuying and using slave labour. And when, after a short time, opposition\r\nbegan to develop, this antagonism to slavery was based upon economic,\r\nrather than upon moral considerations.\r\n\r\nJonathan Edwards was our great theologian, but at the very time that\r\nJonathan Edwards was writing his \"Freedom of the Will\" and preaching his\r\nrevival sermons on \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\" he was the\r\nowner of slaves. When that philosopher, whose writings had sent his name\r\ninto all Europe, died, he bequeathed a favourite slave to his\r\ndescendants. Whitefield was the great evangelist of that era, but\r\nWhitefield during his visit to the colonies purchased a Southern\r\nplantation, stocked it with seventy-five slaves, and when he died\r\nbequeathed it to a relative, whom he characterizes as \"an elect lady,\"\r\nwho, notwithstanding she was \"elect,\" was quite willing to derive her\r\nlivelihood from the sweat of another's brow.\r\n\r\nAnd yet even in the Providence plantations, where more slaves were\r\nbought and sold than in any other of the Northern colonies, the traffic\r\nsoon began to wane. The simple fact is that the rigour of the climate\r\nand the severity of the winters of New England made the life of the\r\nAfrican brief. The slave was the child of a tropic clime, unaccustomed\r\nto clothing, and the January snows and the March winds soon developed\r\nconsumption and chilled to death the child of the tropics. It was found\r\nimpracticable to use the black man in either the forests or fields, and\r\nin a short time slaves were purchased only as domestic servants.\r\n\r\nBut about 1750 the conscience of New England awakened. Men in the pulpit\r\ntook a strong position against the traffic. The Congregational churches\r\nof Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut declared against slavery and\r\nasked the legislatures to adopt the Jewish law, emancipating all slaves\r\nwhatsoever at the end of the tenth year of servitude. A little later,\r\nslavery was made illegal in all the New England colonies, Pennsylvania\r\nat length remembered William Penn, who had freed all his slaves in his\r\nwill, while the German churches of that State began to expel all members\r\nwho were known to have bought or held a slave. When, therefore, the\r\nconvention met in Philadelphia, in 1776, preparatory to the Declaration\r\nof Independence, the delegates were able to say that as a whole the\r\nNorthern colonies had cleansed their borders of the abuse, and had\r\ndecided to build their institutions and civilization upon free labour,\r\nas the sure foundation of individual and social prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut the antagonism to slavery in the Southern colonies was only less\r\npronounced, and this, not because of economic reasons, but because of\r\nmoral considerations. The Southern climate was friendly to cotton and\r\ntobacco, indigo and rice. These products made heavy demands upon labour,\r\nbut white labour was unequal to the intense heat of the Southern summer\r\nand workmen were scarce. During the revolutions under King Charles I and\r\nCharles II and the wars at the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nEngland needed every man at home. Virginia offered high wages and large\r\nland rewards, but it was well-nigh impossible for her to secure\r\nimmigrants and the labour she needed. In that hour the captain of a\r\nslave ship appeared in the House of Burgesses and offered to supply the\r\nneed, but the people of Virginia instructed the delegates to the\r\nassembly to protest against the traffic. Finally, the colony imposed a\r\nduty upon each slave landing, and made the duty so high as to destroy\r\nthe profits of the slave trade. King George was furious with anger, and\r\nsent out a royal proclamation forbidding all interference with the slave\r\ntraffic under heavy penalty, and affirming that this trade was \"highly\r\nbeneficial to the colonies, as well as remunerative to the throne.\"\r\nGrowing more antagonistic to slavery, the planters of Fairfax County\r\ncalled a convention at which Washington presided. Later, in\r\nPhiladelphia, Benjamin Franklin brought in the resolutions condemning\r\nslavery as \"a wicked, cruel and unjustifiable trade.\" Soon the leading\r\nmen of the Southern colonies sent a formal protest to England. Lord\r\nMansfield supported them in a decision that in English countries,\r\ngoverned by English laws, freedom was the rule, and slavery illegal,\r\nunless the colony, through its assembly, expressly legalized the slave\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nWhen the first convention met in Philadelphia, Jefferson included among\r\nthe articles of indictment against George the Third this paragraph: \"He\r\nhas waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most\r\nsacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who\r\nnever offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery or to\r\nincur a miserable death in the transportation thither.\" This passage,\r\nhowever, was struck out of the Declaration in compliance with the wishes\r\nof the delegates from two colonies, who desired to continue slavery. But\r\nin 1784 Jefferson reopened the question by reporting an ordinance\r\nprohibiting slavery after the year 1800 in the territory that afterwards\r\nbecame Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as the\r\nterritory north of the Ohio River. This anti-slavery clause was lost in\r\nthe convention by only a single vote. \"The voice of a single\r\nindividual,\" wrote Jefferson, \"would have prevented this abominable\r\ncrime. But Heaven will not always be silent. The friends to the rights\r\nof human nature will in the end prevail.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, in the Southern States up to the very beginning of the Civil War\r\nthere was a strong anti-slavery sentiment. When the first meeting was\r\nheld in Baltimore to organize the Abolition Society, eighty-five\r\nabolition societies in various counties of Southern States sent\r\ndelegates to the convention. It is a striking fact that the South can\r\nclaim as much credit for the organization of the Abolition Society as\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison and his friends in the North. For the real\r\nresponsibility for slavery does not rest upon Virginia, the Carolinas or\r\nGeorgia, but upon the mother-land, upon the avarice of the throne, the\r\ncupidity of English merchants and the power of English guns and cannon.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1790, therefore, slavery in the North had either died of\r\ninanition, or had been rendered illegal by the action of State\r\nlegislatures, and the chapter was closed. There are the best of reasons\r\nalso for believing that in the South slavery was waning, while the\r\ninfluence of planters who believed free labour more economical was\r\nwaxing. Suddenly an unexpected event changed the whole situation. The\r\ncommerce of the world rests upon food and clothing. The food of the\r\nworld is in wheat and corn, the clothing in cotton and wool. But wool\r\nwas so expensive that for the millions in Europe cotton garments were a\r\nnecessity. England had the looms and the spindles, but she could not\r\nsecure the cotton, and the Southern planters could not grow it. The\r\ncotton pod, as large as a hen's egg, bursts when ripe and the cotton\r\ngushes out in a white mass. Unfortunately, each pod holds eight or ten\r\nseeds, each as large as an orange seed. To clean a single pound of\r\ncotton required a long day's work by a slave. The production of cotton\r\nwas slow and costly, the acreage therefore small, and the profits\r\nslender. The South was burdened with debt, the plantations were\r\nmortgaged, and in 1792 the outlook for the cotton planters was very\r\ndark, and all hearts were filled with foreboding and fear. One winter's\r\nnight Mrs. General Greene, wife of the Revolutionary soldier, was\r\nentertaining at dinner a company of planters. In those days the planters\r\nhad but one thought--how to rid their plantations of their mortgages. It\r\nhappened that the conversation turned upon some possible mechanism for\r\ncleaning the cotton. Mrs. Greene turned to her guests, and, reminding\r\nEli Whitney, a young New Englander who was in her home teaching her\r\nchildren, that he had invented two or three playthings for her children,\r\nsuggested that he turn his attention to the problem.\r\n\r\nYoung Whitney had no tools, but he soon made them; had no wire, but he\r\ndrew his own wire, and within a few months he perfected the cotton gin.\r\nWhen the cat climbs upon the crate filled with chickens, it thrusts its\r\npaw between the laths and pulls off the feathers, leaving the chicken\r\nbehind the laths. Young Whitney substituted wires for laths, and a\r\ntoothed wheel for the cat's paw, and soon pulled all the cotton out at\r\nthe top, leaving the seeds to drop through a hole in the bottom of the\r\ngin. Within a year every great planter had a carpenter manufacturing\r\ngins for the fields. With Whitney's machine one man in a single day\r\ncould clean more cotton than ten negroes could clean in an entire\r\nwinter. Planters annexed wild land, a hundred acres at a time. For the\r\nfirst time the South was able to supply all the cotton that England's\r\nmanufacturers desired. The cities in England awakened to redoubled\r\nindustry. Southern cotton lands jumped from $5 to $50 an acre. Whitney\r\nfound the South producing 10,000 bales in 1793. Sixty years later it\r\nproduced 4,000,000 bales. Historians affirm that this single invention\r\nadded $1,000,000,000 as a free gift to the planters of the South.\r\n\r\nAlthough Eli Whitney took out patents, every planter infringed them.\r\nWhole States organized movements to fight Whitney before the courts. In\r\n1808, when his patent expired, he was poorer than when he began. Feeling\r\nthat the Southern planters had robbed him of the legitimate reward of\r\nhis invention, Whitney came North and gave himself to the study of\r\nfirearms. He invented what is now known as the Colt's revolver, the\r\nRemington rifle and the modern machine gun. Beginning with the feeling\r\nthat he had been robbed of his just rights by Southern planters, Whitney\r\nended by inventing the very weapons that deprived the planters of their\r\nslaves and preserved the Union.\r\n\r\nBut the new prosperity and the increased acreage for cotton in the South\r\ncreated an enormous market for slaves, and soon the sea swarmed with\r\nslave ships. Prices advanced five hundred per cent, until a slave that\r\nhad brought $100 brought $500, and some even $1,000. What made slavery\r\nno scourge, but a great religious moral blessing? The answer is, the\r\ncotton gin and the cotton interest that gave a new desire to promote\r\nslavery, to spread it, and to use its labour. For Eli Whitney had made\r\ncotton to be king. Cotton encouraged slavery; slavery at last\r\nthreatened the Union and so brought on the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe value of the slave as an economic machine depended upon his\r\nphysique, health and general endurance. The slave hunters were\r\nPortuguese, Spaniards and Arabs, who drove the negroes in gangs down to\r\nthe coast, where they were loaded upon the slave ships. When the trade\r\nwas brisk and prices high, the hold of the ship was crowded to\r\nsuffocation, and intense suffering was inevitable. Landing at Savannah\r\nor Charleston, Mobile or New Orleans, the slaves were sold at wholesale,\r\nin the auction place. Later, the slave dealer drove them in gangs\r\nthrough the villages, where they were sold at retail. The cost of a\r\nslave varied with the price of cotton. Of the three million one hundred\r\nthousand slaves living in the South in 1850, one million eight hundred\r\nthousand were raising cotton. That was the great export, the basis of\r\nprosperity. So great was the demand in England for Southern cotton that\r\nprofits were enormous. The Secretary of the Treasury in Buchanan's time\r\npublished a list of forty Southern planters in Louisiana and\r\nMississippi. One of them had five hundred negroes and sold the cotton\r\nfrom his plantation at a net profit of one hundred thousand dollars.\r\nEach negro, therefore, netted his master that year five hundred dollars.\r\nThe working life of a slave was short, scarcely more than seven years,\r\nand for that reason the ablest negro was never worth more than from a\r\nthousand to twelve hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nBut if the cost of free labour was high, the cost of supporting the\r\nslave under the Southern climate was very low. The climate of the Gulf\r\nStates is gentle, soft and propitious. Of forty planters who published\r\ntheir statements, the average cost of clothing and feeding a slave for\r\none year was thirty dollars. One Louisiana planter, however, showed that\r\none hundred slaves on his plantation had cost him in cash outlay seven\r\nhundred and fifty dollars for the entire year. This planter states that\r\nhis slaves raised their own corn, converted it into meal and bread,\r\nraised their own sugar-cane, made their own molasses, built their own\r\nhouses out of the forest hard by. The slaves also raised their own\r\nbacon, but unfortunately the price of meat was so high as to make its\r\nuse only an occasional luxury. North Carolina passed a law commanding\r\nthe planters to give their slaves meat at certain intervals, but the\r\nlaw remained a dead letter. Other states, by legal enactment, fixed the\r\namount of meal that should be given to slaves.\r\n\r\nWhen Fanny Kemble, the English actress, retired from the stage, it was\r\nto marry a Southern planter, and her autobiography and private letters\r\nthrow a flood of light upon the life of the slaves upon a typical\r\nplantation in the cotton States. She says that the planter expected that\r\nabout once in seven years he must buy a new set of hands; that the\r\nslaves did little in the winter, but they worked fifteen hours a day in\r\nthe spring, and often eighteen hours a day in the summer until the\r\ncotton was picked. She adds that the negro children used to beg her for\r\na taste of meat, just as English children plead for a little candy. She\r\nstates that on her husband's estate slave breeding was most important\r\nand remunerative, and that the increase and the young slaves sold made\r\nit possible for the plantation to pay its interest. \"Every negro child\r\nborn was worth two hundred dollars the moment it drew breath.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this separation of families that touched the heart of Fanny\r\nKemble Butler, and stirred the indignation of Harriet Martineau, who at\r\nthe end of her year at the South wrote that she would rather walk\r\nthrough a penitentiary or a lunatic asylum than through the slave\r\nquarters that stood in the rear of the great house where she was\r\nentertained. It is this element that explains the statement of John\r\nRandolph of Virginia. Conversing one evening about the notable orations\r\nto which he had listened, the great lawyer said that the most eloquent\r\nwords he had ever heard were \"spoken on the auction block by a slave\r\nmother.\" It seemed that she pleaded with the auctioneer and the\r\nspectators not to separate her from her children and her husband, and\r\nshe made these men, who were trafficking in human life, realize the\r\nmeaning of Christ's words, \"Woe unto him that doth offend one of My\r\nlittle ones; it were better for him that a millstone were placed about\r\nhis neck and that he were cast into the depths of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nIn this era of industrial education for the coloured race it is\r\ninteresting to note that five of the slave States imposed heavy\r\npenalties upon any one who should teach the slaves to read or write.\r\nVirginia, however, permitted the owner to teach his slave in the\r\ninterest of better management of the plantation. North Carolina finally\r\nconsented to arithmetic. After 1831 and the Nat Turner negro\r\ninsurrection more stringent laws were passed to prevent the slaves\r\nlearning how to read, lest they chance upon abolition documents. A\r\nGeorgian planter said that \"The very slightest amount of education\r\nimpairs their value as slaves, for it instantly destroys their\r\ncontentedness; and since you do not contemplate changing their\r\ncondition, it is surely doing them an ill service to destroy their\r\nacquiescence in it.\" In spite of the law, however, domestic servants\r\nwere frequently taught to read. Frederick Douglass found a teacher in\r\nhis mistress, where he was held as a domestic slave, and Douglass in\r\nturn taught his fellow slaves on the plantation by stealth. The\r\nadvertisements of slaves that mention the slave's ability to read and\r\ncipher, as a reason for special value, prove that the more intelligent\r\nslaves had at least the rudiments of knowledge. Olmstead, in his \"Cotton\r\nKingdom,\" says he visited a plantation in Mississippi, where one of the\r\nnegroes had, with the full permission of his master, taught all his\r\nfellows how to read.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the influence of slavery upon the poorer whites shows\r\nthat two-thirds of the white population suffered hardly less than did\r\nthe coloured people. The slaveholding class formed an aristocracy, who\r\ndominated and ruled as lords. When the war broke out, there were about\r\nfour hundred thousand slave-holders, and nine and a half million people.\r\nBut of these four hundred thousand slave-holders, only about eight\r\nthousand owned more than fifty slaves each, and it was this mere handful\r\nwho lived in splendid homes, surrounded with luxury, beauty, and\r\nrefinement. Travellers who have thrown the veil of romance and\r\nenchantment about the Southern home, with a great house embowered in\r\nmagnolia trees, its rooms stored with art treasures, its walls lined\r\nwith marbles and bronzes, and its banqueting room at night crowded with\r\nbeautiful women and handsome men--these travellers speak of what was as\r\na matter of fact exceptional. We must remember that these men\r\nrepresented a small aristocracy; that their mode of life, so charmingly\r\npictured by many accomplished writers, was the life of a select group,\r\nand that the great slave plantations numbered not more than eight\r\nthousand in that vast area.\r\n\r\nFrom the hour of the organization of the Abolition Society, these\r\nSouthern planters assumed an aggressive position. Their editors,\r\npoliticians and lawyers began to publish briefs, in support of the\r\npeculiar institution. The usual argument began with ridicule of Thomas\r\nJefferson's famous statement that all men are born equal. The second\r\nargument was an economic one, based on the value of the slaves. Three\r\nmillion slaves would average a value of five hundred dollars each, and\r\nthis meant a billion five hundred millions of property, that had to be\r\nconsidered as so much property in ships, factories, engines, reapers,\r\npastures, meadows, herds and flocks. All planters invoked the words of\r\nMoses, permitting the Hebrews to hold slaves, and therefore exhibiting\r\nslavery as a divine institution. Statesmen justified the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw by triumphantly quoting Paul's letter, sending Onesimus back to his\r\nrich master, Philemon. Jefferson Davis rested his argument upon the\r\ncurse that God pronounced upon Canaan, and asserted that slavery was\r\nestablished by a decree of Almighty God and that through the portal of\r\nslavery alone the descendant of the graceless son of Noah entered the\r\ntemple of civilization. Once a year the Southern minister preached from\r\nthe text, \"Cursed be Canaan, the son of Ham. A servant of servants shall\r\nhe be unto his brethren.\"\r\n\r\nA few scholars grounded themselves on the scientific argument. These men\r\nheld that the black man was separated from the Saxon by a great chasm,\r\nthat if freed he was not equal to self-government, that he was a mere\r\nchild when placed in competition with the white man, and that the strong\r\nowed it to the weak, that it was the duty of every superior man to take\r\ncharge of the inferior, and impose government from without.\r\n\r\nThe politician had a stronger argument in defense of slavery. He held\r\nthat the nation that was strong, educated, prosperous, with an army and\r\nnavy, had not only the right but the duty of imposing government upon a\r\ncolony that was ignorant, poor, and degraded, and that this example of\r\nthe nation governing a colony by force of arms proved that the white\r\nman, as master, should impose government from without upon the slave.\r\n\r\nNot until years after the war was over did men fully realize that\r\nslavery was weight and free labour wings to the people. The North\r\nbelieved that the working man should be free, that he should be\r\neducated in the public schools, and that the only way to increase his\r\nwage was to increase his intelligence. Each new knowledge, therefore,\r\nbrought a new economic hunger, and made the free labourer a good buyer\r\nin the market, thus supporting factories and shops. Contrariwise the\r\nslave was a poor buyer. The negro picking cotton out of the pod had few\r\nwants,--one garment about his loins, a pone of corn bread, a husk\r\nmattress,--no more. For that reason the slave starved the factory and\r\nshop. Invention in the South perished. Every attempt to found a factory\r\nwas attended with failure. Of necessity, the North grew steadily richer\r\nstraight through the war, while the South grew steadily poorer. The war\r\nclosed with Northern factories and shops and trade at the high tide of\r\nprosperity. The free working man asked many forms of clothing for the\r\nbody, books and magazines for the mind, pictures for the walls,\r\nsewing-machine, the reed organ, every conceivable comfort and\r\nconvenience for his family, and these many forms of hunger nourished\r\ninvention, made the towns centres of manufacturing life, and built a\r\nrich nation. The Northern working man put his head into his task, the\r\nslave, his heel. When the war was over, the South was like a crushed\r\negg, impoverished by slavery. The peculiar institution had served well\r\neight thousand slave planters, each of whom owned more than fifty\r\nslaves. But slavery had starved the remaining millions.\r\n\r\nNow that the new era has come, no statesman, no scholar, no editor, has\r\never indicted slavery as the costliest possible form of production, with\r\nhalf the skill, eloquence and conviction of Southern writers. What\r\nNorthern men believe, the Southerner knows. Unconsciously the Southern\r\nyouth was handicapped in the commercial race. His Northern brother was\r\nan athlete, stripped to the skin, while he dragged a fetter, invisible.\r\nThat he should have come so near to winning the race is a tribute to his\r\ncourage, endurance, and a mental resource that can never be praised too\r\nhighly. If the rest of the world could only fight for good causes, with\r\nhalf the ability, chivalry and bravery that the South fought for a bad\r\neconomic system, the world would soon enter upon the millennium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWEBSTER AND CALHOUN: THE BATTLE LINE IN ARRAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year was 1830; the scene, the Senate Chamber in Washington; the\r\ncombatants, Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun. Two hundred and ten\r\nyears had now passed since the ship of liberty had come to New England,\r\nand the ship of slavery had landed in Virginia. These centuries had\r\ngiven ample time for the development of the real genius and influence of\r\nliberty and free labour in the civilization of the North, and of slave\r\nlabour upon the institutions of the South. Little by little the\r\nmerchants, manufacturers and professional classes of the North had come\r\nto feel that a free and educated working class produces wealth more\r\ncheaply and rapidly than slave labour, and that the working people of\r\nAmerica must be educated and free, if they were to compete with the free\r\nworking people of Great Britain and Europe. Contrariwise, the South\r\nbelieved that manual labour was a task for slaves, that cotton, rice\r\nand sugar were produced more rapidly by slave labour than by free\r\nlabour. The Southern civilization was built on the plan of producing raw\r\ncotton, and exchanging it for manufactured goods. It did not escape the\r\nnotice of Southern leaders, however, that under free labour the North\r\nhad nearly double the population and wealth of the South. But Senator\r\nHayne explained this by saying that the biggest nations had never been\r\nthe greatest, and that the renowned peoples had been like Athens,--small\r\nstates, elect and patrician.\r\n\r\nBut darkness and light, summer and winter, liberty and slavery cannot\r\nexist side by side, in peace and tranquility. Unite hydrogen and\r\nchlorine, and the chemist has an explosion that takes off the roof of\r\nthe house. And because liberty and slavery were antagonistic, and\r\nmutually destructive, whenever the representatives of both came together\r\nthere was inevitably an explosion either on the platform or through the\r\npress. It could not have been otherwise. In Palestine two opposing\r\ncivilizations came into collision,--one the Hebrew and the other the\r\nPhilistine,--and the Philistine went down. In Holland the Dutchmen,\r\nworking towards democracy, collided with the Spaniards, working towards\r\nautocracy, and the Spaniard went down. In England, Hampden and Pym came\r\ninto collision with Charles the First and Archbishop Laud. The two\r\nleaders of democracy wished to increase the privileges of the common\r\npeople by diffusing property, liberty, office and honours, while Charles\r\nthe First and Laud wished to lessen the powers of the people, and to\r\nincrease the privileges of the throne; democracy won, and autocracy\r\nlost. And now in this republic, a civilization based upon the freedom\r\nand education of the working classes came into collision with the\r\nSouthern civilization, based upon ignorant slave labour, and there were\r\nupheavals and political outbreaks everywhere. In vain Abraham tried to\r\nhouse Isaac, the son of the free woman, and Ishmael, the son of the\r\nslave woman, under one and the same roof. Slowly the men in the North\r\nand the manufacturers of England came to feel that slavery was\r\ninterfering with the commerce and prosperity, not simply of the people\r\nof this republic, but of Europe also. Slavery was an economic\r\nobstruction, lying directly in the path of progress.\r\n\r\nThe two men who marked out the lines of struggle and precipitated the\r\nconflict were Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun. Daniel Webster, the\r\ndefender of the Constitution, affirmed that the Union was one and\r\ninseparable, now and forever. John C. Calhoun said, \"The State is\r\nsovereign and supreme, and the Union secondary.\" In effect Webster said,\r\n\"The central government is the sun, and the States are planets, moving\r\nround about the central orb.\" Calhoun answered, \"There is no central sun\r\nin our political system, but only planets, each revolving in any orbit\r\nit elects for itself.\" Webster said, \"In the cosmic and political system\r\nalike, it is the central sun that causes the States like planets to move\r\nin order and harmony, without collision, and with rich harvests.\"\r\nCalhoun answered that every planet should be its own sun, and, if it\r\nchoose, be a runaway orb, and collide with whom it will.\r\n\r\nFinally, the argument of Webster and Calhoun was submitted to armies.\r\nGrant and Sherman said, \"Webster is right; the Union must be\r\nmaintained.\" Lee and Jackson answered, \"Calhoun is right; the Union must\r\ngo, and the sovereign State remain.\" At Bull Run, Calhoun's doctrine\r\nseemed to be in the ascendancy; at Gettysburg, Webster's argument seemed\r\nto have the more cogency; at Appomattox Lee withdrew his support from\r\nCalhoun, and allowed Daniel Webster's plea that the Union must abide and\r\nbe now and forever, one and inseparable.\r\n\r\nThe Northern statesman, Daniel Webster, was probably the greatest\r\npolitical genius our country has produced. He was born in New Hampshire,\r\nin 1782, and was seven years old when his father gave him a copy of the\r\nnewly-adopted Constitution, which he soon committed to memory. His\r\nfather belonged to the farmer class, who read by night and brooded upon\r\nhis reading by day. In an era of privation for the colonists, by stern\r\ndenial he put his son through Phillips Exeter Academy and Dartmouth\r\nCollege. While still a young man, Daniel Webster leaped into fame by a\r\nsingle argument before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, and became\r\nthe competitor of jurists like Rufus Choate. His orations on \"Bunker\r\nHill Monument,\" the \"Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers,\" the \"Death of\r\nAdams and Jefferson,\" are among the really sublime passages in the\r\nhistory of eloquence. In the Girard College case Webster established the\r\npoint that Christianity is a part of the common law of the land.\r\nCriminal lawyers quote Webster's argument in the great Knapp murder\r\ntrial, that the voice of conscience is the voice of God, as the world's\r\nbest statement of the moral imperative, and the automatic judgment seat\r\nGod has set up in the city of man's soul.\r\n\r\nEven from the physical view-point he deserved his epithet, \"the godlike\r\nDaniel.\" Not so tall as Calhoun or Clay, he was more solidly built than\r\neither of the Southern orators. His head was so large and beautiful,\r\nthat Crawford, the sculptor, thought Webster his ideal model for a\r\nstatue of Jupiter. His skin was a deep bronze and copper hue, but when\r\nexcited his face became luminous, and translucent as a lamp of\r\nalabaster. His opponents say that Webster had the finest vocal\r\ninstrument of his generation, and that he was a master of all possible\r\neffects through speech. His voice was mellow and sweet, with an\r\nextraordinary range, extending from the ringing clarion tenor note, to\r\nthe bass of a deep-toned organ. The historian tells us \"Webster had the\r\nfaculty of magnifying a word into such prodigious volume that it was\r\ndropped from his lips as a great boulder might drop into the sea, and it\r\njarred the Senate Chamber like a clap of thunder.\" The Kentucky lawyer,\r\nThomas Marshall, said when Webster came to his peroration in his reply\r\nto Hayne, that he \"listened as to one inspired.\" He finally thought he\r\nsaw a halo around the orator's head, like the one seen in the old\r\nmasters' depictions of saints.\r\n\r\nWebster's opponent was John C. Calhoun, senator from South Carolina.\r\nCalhoun was the first Southern statesman to mark out the lines of battle\r\nand indicate the methods of attack and defense for the supporters of\r\nslavery. Graduating with high honours at Yale, in the class of 1802,\r\nCalhoun studied law for three years at Litchfield, Connecticut, and then\r\ndecided to enter politics. In the lecture halls and class rooms, he\r\nstood at the very forefront, as orator and logician. One day, in Yale\r\nCollege, Calhoun delivered a speech on an apparently absurd proposition,\r\nwhich he defended with great acuteness. When he had finished, President\r\nDwight said, \"Calhoun, that is a brilliant piece of logic, and if I ever\r\nwant any one to prove that shad grow upon apple trees, I shall appoint\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the lines of broad patriotism, with reference to the interests of\r\nthe country as a whole, Calhoun supported the war with England in 1812.\r\nFrom city to city the young lawyer journeyed, travelling all the way\r\nfrom Charleston and Savannah to Boston and Portland, urging the right\r\nand the duty of the Republic to resist England's claim to the right of\r\nsearch of American vessels. Calhoun was widely read in history, he was\r\nfull of intense patriotism, his arguments were clear, he had unity,\r\norder and movement in his thinking, he had the art of putting things,\r\nand was a perfect master of his audience. At thirty years of age Calhoun\r\nwas as popular in Boston as he was later in Savannah and Charleston. In\r\n1824, he was elected Vice-President,--the only man on the ticket to be\r\nchosen by popular vote. From that hour until his death he remained a\r\nmember of the triumvirate that controlled the destinies of the Republic,\r\nsharing honours with Henry Clay and Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nIn the South Calhoun was all but idolized. He was tall and slender of\r\nperson, refined and elegant in manners, carrying with him great personal\r\ncharm. He was a puritan in his morals, maintained a spotless reputation,\r\nand escaped all criticism with reference to private life that was\r\nvisited upon his competitors. Many a Northern man who went to Congress\r\nhating the very name of Calhoun, the arch-secessionist, was compelled\r\nto confess that he had to steel his heart against the charm of Calhoun's\r\nspeech and personality. The simplicity of his character, the clearness\r\nof his thinking, the sincerity and moral earnestness of his nature, all\r\nunited to lend him the influence that he exerted over men like Oliver\r\nDyer, Webster's friend, who said of Calhoun, \"He was by all odds the\r\nmost fascinating man in private intercourse that I have ever met.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Webster and Clay came into collision, it was over a subject\r\napparently far removed from the bondage of slaves. If slavery was the\r\nspark that fired the magazine for the great explosion in 1861, the\r\ntariff furnished the powder. The South produced raw material, and\r\nimported all her tools, comforts and conveniences, while the North had\r\nfree labour, and her educated working classes were good purchasers, and\r\nlent generous support to manufacturers. Exporting its raw cotton to\r\nEngland, the South sent its leaders to Congress to ask for free trade\r\nwith foreign countries, or in any event, a lower tariff. The Northern\r\nmanufacturers sent their leaders to Congress to ask for protection\r\nagainst foreign woollens, cottons, and all English tools and French\r\nsilks, and luxuries. Therefore the interests of the North antagonized\r\nthe interests of the South. In the South the anti-slavery sentiment had\r\ndisappeared because of Whitney's cotton gin. As Beecher wittily put it\r\nin his Manchester speech: \"Slaves that before had been worth three to\r\nfour hundred dollars began to be worth six hundred. That knocked away\r\none-third of adherence to the moral law. Then they became worth seven\r\nhundred dollars, and half the law went; then eight or nine hundred\r\ndollars, and there was no such thing as moral law; then one thousand or\r\ntwelve hundred dollars, and slavery became one of the beatitudes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Southern leaders, therefore, wanted free trade with England; the\r\nNorth urged protection, in the interest of the whole country, rather\r\nthan a group of States. The South believed that Northern politics was\r\nselfish; the North believed that the Southern leaders were building up\r\nEnglish manufacturers, and weakening their own country! The people\r\nbecame one great debating club, and the dispute waxed more bitter day by\r\nday. Every new event seemed to widen the breach. The war of the\r\nRevolution made for unity between North and South, just as the hammer\r\nwelds together two pieces of red hot iron. The soldiers of the\r\nRevolution had marched under the same flag, supported the same\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and fought for the same Constitution.\r\nSlavery in the North had died through inanition, and during the\r\neighteenth century in the South also slavery seemed in process of\r\nextinction. But now, in 1830, slavery had become a great source of\r\nimmeasurable wealth to the South, just as manufacturing had built up the\r\nprosperity of the North.\r\n\r\nThe tariff discussion came to a climax in 1828, through the passing of a\r\ncustoms act, known as the Tariff of Abominations. Sparks falling on ice\r\ncarry no peril, but sparks falling on the dry prairie cause\r\nconflagrations. The news of the passing of the protective tariff created\r\nintense excitement in South Carolina. Public meetings were called in all\r\nthe towns in the land, and protests were made against the execution of\r\nthe new law. Legislators in the State capital, orators on the platform,\r\neditors through their columns, urged nullification. There were two\r\nreasons for this growing hostility to protection on the part of the\r\ncitizens of Calhoun's State; first the belief that as England was the\r\nlargest purchaser of cotton, it was to South Carolina's best interest to\r\nhave English goods brought in free; second the conviction that the\r\ntariff was a strictly sectional movement in the interest of the\r\nmanufacturing North, as opposed to the South with her raw cotton and\r\nslave labour.\r\n\r\nAs a candidate for the vice-presidency in 1828 on the same ticket as\r\nGeneral Jackson, Calhoun took no definite step until after the election,\r\nwhen he published a paper showing the evil which the protective tariff\r\nwas doing the Southern states, and asserting the right to interpose a\r\nveto. In January, 1830, having broken with Jackson and abandoned all\r\nhope of later obtaining the presidency by his aid, Calhoun decided to\r\ntest the theory of nullification upon the national theatre. Accordingly,\r\nunder his direction, Senator Hayne inserted in his speech on the Foote\r\nResolution on the public lands the defense of what was to be known later\r\nas the South Carolina Doctrine,--that, if a State considered a law of\r\nCongress unconstitutional (as South Carolina asserted the recent tariff\r\nact to be) the State had the right to nullify the law, and, if\r\nobedience was sought to be enforced, the right to secede from the Union.\r\n\r\nHis position has been stated by no one so clearly as by himself, for he\r\nspent the next three years perfecting and elaborating his argument. As\r\nthe basis of his structure he employed a distinction between \"a nation\"\r\nand \"a union.\" England was a nation--the United States was a union.\r\nRussia, Austria and Turkey were nations--this republic a union of\r\nsovereign states. Prussia was presided over by a king and was a\r\nnation--the United States was a republic and the citizens ruled\r\nthemselves. Calhoun distinguished also between sovereignty and\r\ngovernment; sovereignty is a birthright, a natural and inalienable right\r\nvouchsafed by God; government is an artificial right established by law.\r\nSovereignty is an inexpungable and inherent privilege; government is a\r\nsecondary and artificial privilege. When any sovereign State is injured,\r\nit has not only the right but the duty to withdraw from the compact that\r\nhas been broken. The popular notion is that this idea of _Secession_ was\r\noriginated by Calhoun and was a South Carolina heresy; as a matter of\r\nfact, it was first presented in Congress by Josiah Quincy, and should\r\nbe called \"A Massachusetts heresy.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1811, as one of the results of the purchase of Louisiana by\r\nJefferson, a bill had been offered providing for the reception of the\r\nState of Orleans into the Union. The people of New Orleans spoke the\r\nFrench language, lived under the code of Napoleon, were monarchial in\r\ntheir sympathy, and Quincy opposed the bill, just as many men to-day\r\nwould oppose the reception into the Union of the Philippines, the\r\nHawaiians or the Porto Ricans. Mr. Quincy declared that if Orleans were\r\nadmitted, the several States would be freed from the federal bonds and\r\nthat \"as it will be the right of all States, so it will be the duty of\r\nsome, to prepare definitely for separation, amicably if they can,\r\nviolently if they must.\" When the speaker ruled out of order these\r\nremarks, Quincy appealed, and the House of Representatives sustained his\r\nappeal by a vote of fifty-six to fifty-three. Congress, under the lead\r\nof Massachusetts, went on record that \"it was permissible to discuss a\r\ndissolution of the Union, amicably if we can--forcibly if we must.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Henry Clay taunted the Massachusetts leaders with this\r\nthreat to dismember the Union. In 1844, Charles Francis Adams, in a\r\nspeech opposing the annexation of Texas, affirmed the right of the\r\nNorthern States to dissolve the Union. Even Charles Sumner and Horace\r\nGreeley held the same views in 1861. The editor was anxious to \"let the\r\nerring sisters go,\" believing that the withdrawal was parliamentary;\r\nwhile Charles Sumner said: \"If they will only go, we will build a bridge\r\nof gold for them to go over on.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was Calhoun who carried the doctrine of _Nullification_ to its\r\nfull development, and who worked out the theory of sovereignty. In the\r\ndebate with Webster, on the Force Bill, he stated his argument as\r\nfollows: \"The people of Carolina believe that the Union is a union of\r\nStates and not of individuals; that it was formed by the States, and\r\nthat the citizens of the several States were bound to it through the\r\nacts of their several States; that each State ratified the Constitution\r\nfor itself, and that it was only by such ratification of the States that\r\nany obligation was imposed upon its citizens.... On this principle the\r\npeople of the State [South Carolina] have declared by the ordinance that\r\nthe Acts of Congress which imposed duties under the authority to lay\r\nimposts, were acts not for revenue, as intended by the Constitution, but\r\nfor protection, and therefore null and void.\" \"The terms union, federal,\r\nunited, all imply a combination of sovereignties, a confederation of\r\nStates. The sovereignty is in the several States, and our system is a\r\nunion of twenty-four sovereign powers, under a constitutional compact,\r\nand not of a divided sovereignty between the States severally and the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nHis attitude towards slavery is illustrated by the remarks he delivered\r\nin the Senate. \"This agitation has produced one happy effect at least;\r\nit has compelled us of the South to look into the nature and character\r\nof this great institution of slavery, and correct many false impressions\r\nthat even we had entertained in relation to it. Many in the South once\r\nbelieved that it was a moral and political evil. That folly and delusion\r\nare gone. We see it now in its true light, and regard it as a most safe\r\nand stable basis for free institutions in the world. It is impossible\r\nwith us that the conflict can take place between labour and capital,\r\nwhich makes it so difficult to establish and maintain free institutions\r\nin all wealthy and highly civilized nations, where such institutions as\r\nours do not exist.\"\r\n\r\nCalhoun's attempt to have his doctrine set forth on the floor of the\r\nSenate Chamber met a crushing blow. When the hour came, he chose, to\r\npresent his view, Hayne of South Carolina, who defended the doctrine of\r\nnullification with great brilliancy and energy. Hayne took the ground\r\nthat nullification was the old view always held by Virginia, that it was\r\nthe doctrine of Thomas Jefferson, and had been urged by Josiah Quincy of\r\nMassachusetts itself. He was a most gifted orator. After a century of\r\npreparation, at length slavery had chosen its strategic position and\r\ndrawn the battle line. From that moment it was certain that slavery must\r\ngo, or that the Union must go. A feeling of apprehension spread over the\r\nland. Fear fell upon the hearts of the people. The one question of the\r\nhour was whether Webster could answer the Southern orator and sweep away\r\nthe fog with which Hayne had enveloped the discussion, and make the old\r\nConstitution stand out as firm as a mountain, with principles as bright\r\nas the stars.\r\n\r\nBy universal consent Webster's reply is our finest example of forensic\r\neloquence. The essence of the argument was the right of the majority to\r\ncontrol the minority. That one State could nullify and secede whenever\r\nthe majority outvoted it, practically destroyed the jury system which is\r\nembedded in Saxon history, destroyed the right of the majority of the\r\naldermen to control the great city, destroyed the right of the majority\r\nof the supreme justices to make their decision. Webster's argument\r\ncrushed the doctrine of secession, and made the Republic a nation. Thus\r\nCalhoun and Webster marked out the line of battle, for when the men in\r\ngray and the men in blue met at Gettysburg and Appomattox it was to\r\ndetermine whether Calhoun or Webster was right. Grant's final victory\r\nsimply stamped with a seal of blood the great charter that Webster's\r\ngenius had formulated.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect the wonderful thing about Webster's reply is that his\r\nnotes were confined to a sheet of letter paper. Afterwards Webster said\r\nthat it had been carefully prepared, for while there is such a thing as\r\nextemporaneous delivery, there is \"no extemporaneous acquisition.\" Not\r\nuntil he entered the Senate Chamber and saw the crowds did he feel the\r\nslightest trepidation. \"A strange sensation came. My brain was free.\r\nAll that I had ever read or thought or acted, in literature, in history,\r\nin law, in politics, seemed to unroll before me in glowing panorama, and\r\nthen it was easy, if I wanted a thunderbolt, to reach out and take it,\r\nas it went smoking by.\" When Lyman Beecher had read Webster's reply to\r\nHayne, he turned to a friend and exclaimed, \"It makes me think of a\r\nred-hot cannon-ball going through a bucket of empty egg-shells.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that hour patriotism rose like a flood. For two generations the\r\nreply has been to Americans what Demosthenes on the Crown was to the\r\nAthenians. Webster placed the nation above the union, made the Nation,\r\nin its constitutionally specified sphere of action, sovereign and\r\nprimary, the States secondary and subordinate. He thus made possible a\r\nworld-wide victory for free institutions, by which, to-day, democracy\r\nand self-government are making thrones totter and tyrants tremble, and\r\ngiving us the assurance that no government is so stable as a government\r\nconceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are\r\nfree and equal. Webster made logical use of \"government of the people,\r\nby the people, and for the people.\" The soldiers of Gettysburg\r\nexhibited their willingness to defend such a government, to live for\r\nfree institutions, and if necessary to die for them.\r\n\r\nNow that long time has passed, Southerners and Northerners alike concede\r\nthat Calhoun made three mistakes. He fought against progress and\r\ncivilization that has destroyed slavery on moral grounds. He also failed\r\nto see that slavery was the worst possible system of production, for if\r\nthe South produced under slavery 4,000,000 bales of cotton in 1861, now\r\nthat the coloured man is free she produces 15,000,000 bales of cotton\r\nper year. His theory of the right of the minority as a sovereign right\r\nof secession has broken down at the bar of civilization. If South\r\nCarolina or any State has the right to withdraw, whenever the majority\r\nof other States outvote it, it means that the minority always has a\r\nright to disobey the majority, which means not simply the withdrawal of\r\nthe one State from the many States, but later, the withdrawal of a few\r\ncounties from a majority of the counties in that State, giving an\r\nendless series of confusions. If any single doctrine is established\r\namong civilized nations to-day it is this one, under democratic\r\ninstitutions--the right of the majority to rule.\r\n\r\nThree years later Webster once more marked out the basis of the North's\r\nposition for all time in a debate with Calhoun himself. Without the\r\nmagnificent flights of eloquence which distinguished the Reply to Hayne,\r\nthis speech of February 16, 1833, was filled with close and powerful\r\nreasoning. Once and for all he maintained:\r\n\r\n\"1. That the Constitution of the United States is not a league,\r\nconfederacy, or compact between the people of the several States, in\r\ntheir sovereign capacities, but a government proper, founded on the\r\nadoption of the people, and creating direct relations between itself and\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\"2. That no State authority has power to dissolve these relations; that\r\nnothing can dissolve them but revolution. And that consequently there\r\ncan be no such thing as secession without revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of that argument in the history of our country cannot be\r\noverestimated. As James Ford Rhodes has put it: \"The justification\r\nalleged by the South for her secession in 1861 was based on the\r\nprinciples enunciated by Calhoun; the cause was slavery. Had there been\r\nno slavery, the Calhoun theory of the Constitution would never have been\r\npropounded, or had it been, it would have been crushed beyond\r\nresurrection by Webster's speeches of 1830 and 1833. The South could not\r\nin 1861 justify her right to revolution, for there was no oppression nor\r\ninvalidation of rights. She could, however, proclaim to the civilized\r\nworld what was true, that she went to war to extend slavery. Her defense\r\ntherefore is that she made the contest for her constitutional rights,\r\nand this attempted vindication is founded on the Calhoun theory. On the\r\nother hand, the ideas of Webster waxed strong with the years; and the\r\nNorthern people, thoroughly imbued with these sentiments, and holding\r\nthem as sacred truths, could not do otherwise than resist the\r\ndismemberment of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe great crisis that broke Mr. Webster's health and perhaps his heart\r\ncame through a misunderstanding. In 1850 the discussion over the Wilmot\r\nproviso was stirring the Senate; Henry Clay had brought in his series of\r\ncompromise resolutions, based on the sober belief that the Union was in\r\nimminent danger, and that once again the skillful hand that had penned\r\nthe Missouri Compromise might turn the country back into the path of\r\npeace and prosperity. Calhoun, the second of the great Triumvirate, was\r\nalready within a month of death. Too weak to read his speech, he was\r\nwheeled into the Senate Chamber, to sit with closed eyes while his last\r\nhaughty, arrogant defense of the South's rights was read by Senator\r\nMason. But the greatest of them all was yet to speak. Webster had the\r\nforesight of Civil War, with rivers of blood, and a man on horseback.\r\nInfluenced by what we now see was the broadest patriotism, he delivered\r\nhis \"Seventh of March Speech,\"--the opening words of which disclose a\r\nmotive and a purpose too often overlooked by his critics. \"I speak\r\nto-day for the preservation of the Union. 'Hear me for my cause.'\"\r\nBriefly, his position was this:--that the Union was primary, dealing\r\nwith the liberties of fifty and later one hundred millions of\r\npeople,--white men as well as black,--and that the slavery question was\r\nsecondary, involving an artificial, less important and less permanent\r\ninstitution. He discussed slavery from the view-point of history, with\r\narguments of the philosopher rather than those of the orator. He\r\ndefended the compromise measures, with their clause in favour of strict\r\nenforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law, on the ground that the Government\r\nwas solemnly pledged by law and contract, and, indeed, \"had been pledged\r\nto it again and again.\" He closed with that famous paragraph\r\ndemonstrating the impossibility of peaceable secession. \"Sir, he who\r\nsees these States now revolving in harmony around a common centre, and\r\nexpects them to quit their places, and fly off without convulsion, may\r\nlook the next hour to see the heavenly bodies rush from their spheres,\r\nand jostle against each other in the realms of space, without causing\r\nthe wreck of the universe.\"\r\n\r\nBut he had defended the Fugitive Slave Law!--Therefore Abolitionists\r\nburned Webster in effigy. Wendell Phillips called him a second Judas\r\nIscariot. Whittier wrote \"Ichabod\" across his forehead. Horace Mann\r\ndescribed him as a \"fallen star--Lucifer descending from heaven!\" Every\r\narrow was barbed and poisoned. Webster suffered like a great eagle with\r\na dart through its heart, beating its bloody wings upward through the\r\npathless air.\r\n\r\nBut now that long time has passed, thoughtful men realize that Webster\r\nhad studied the fundamental question more deeply, knew the facts better,\r\nand saw clearer than his detractors. It is true that he erred when he\r\ncriticized the Abolitionists on the ground that in the last twenty years\r\nthey had \"produced nothing good or valuable,\"--that his words were\r\nchosen in a way that irritated the North unduly,--and, more important\r\nstill, that in his remarks on the Fugitive Slave Law he swerved from the\r\nbroad statesmanship which distinguished the rest of the speech. But\r\ntwelve years later Abraham Lincoln read Daniel Webster's Seventh of\r\nMarch Speech, and said Webster was right and Boston was wrong. Lincoln\r\nput Webster's position into his letter to Greeley: \"My paramount object\r\nin this struggle is to save the Union, and not either to save or to\r\ndestroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I\r\nwould do it; if I could save the Union by freeing all the slaves, I\r\nwould do it, and if I could save the Union by freeing some, and leaving\r\nothers alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery I do because\r\nI believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear I forbear\r\nbecause I do not believe it would help to save the Union.\" And to-day,\r\nafter sixty years, our foremost writers are agreeing that \"from the\r\nhistorical view-point Webster's position was one of the highest\r\nstatesmanship.\" But the recognition of Webster unfortunately came too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nAs time passed Webster felt more and more keenly the injustice done him.\r\nBitterness poisoned his days, and sorrow shortened his life. When the\r\nautumn came, he made ready for the end, knowing he would not survive\r\nanother winter. One October morning Webster said to his physician, \"I\r\nshall die to-night.\" The physician, an old friend, answered, \"You are\r\nright, sir.\" When the twilight fell, and all had gathered about his\r\nbedside, Mr. Webster, in a tone that could be heard throughout the\r\nhouse, slowly uttered these words, \"My general wish on earth has been to\r\ndo my Master's will. That there is a God, all must acknowledge. I see\r\nHim in all these wondrous works, Himself how wondrous! What would be the\r\ncondition of any of us if we had not the hope of immortality? What\r\nground is there to rest upon but the Gospel? There were scattered hopes\r\nof the immortality of the soul, especially among the Jews. The Jews\r\nbelieved in a spiritual origin of creation; the Romans never reached it;\r\nthe Greeks never reached it. It is a tradition that communication was\r\nmade to the Jews by God Himself through Moses. There were intimations\r\ncrepuscular, but--but--but--thank God! the Gospel of Jesus Christ\r\nbrought immortality to light, rescued it, brought it to light.\"\r\n\r\nThen, while all knelt in his death chamber and wept, Webster, in a\r\nstrong, firm voice, repeated the whole of the Lord's Prayer, closing\r\nwith these words: \"Peace on earth and good will to men. That is the\r\nhappiness, the essence--good will to men.\" And so the defender of the\r\nConstitution, the greatest reasoner on political matters of the\r\nRepublic, fell upon death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReflecting upon Webster's unconscious influence as set forth in the\r\nwords, \"I still live,\" one of his eulogists says that when Rufus Choate\r\ntook ship for that port where he died, a friend exclaimed: \"You will be\r\nhere a year hence.\" \"Sir,\" said the lawyer, \"I shall be here a hundred\r\nyears hence, and a thousand years hence.\" With his biographer let us\r\nalso believe that Daniel Webster is still here; that he watches with\r\nintense interest the spread of democracy; that he now perceives our free\r\ninstitutions extending their influence around the globe, beneficently\r\nvictorious in many a foreign state; that he rejoices as he beholds \"the\r\ngorgeous ensign of the Republic, now known and honoured throughout the\r\nworld, bearing that sentiment dear to every true American heart, liberty\r\nand union, now and forever, one and inseparable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nGARRISON AND PHILLIPS: ANTI-SLAVERY AGITATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, historians make a large place for the eloquence of the\r\nanti-slavery epoch, as a force explaining the abolition movement. Every\r\ngreat movement must have its advocate and voice. Garrison was the pen\r\nfor abolition, Emerson its philosopher, Greeley its editor, and in\r\nWendell Phillips abolition had its advocate. Political kings are\r\noftentimes artificial kings. The orator is God's natural king, divinely\r\nenthroned. Back of all eloquence is a great soul, a great cause and a\r\ngreat peril. Our history holds three supreme moments in the story of\r\neloquence--the hour of Patrick Henry's speech at Williamsburg, Wendell\r\nPhillips' at Faneuil Hall and Lincoln's at Gettysburg. The great hour\r\nand the great crisis, the great cause and the great man, all met and\r\nmelted together at a psychologic moment. In retrospect Phillips seems\r\nlike a special gift of God to the anti-slavery period. Webster had more\r\nweight and majesty, Everett a higher polish, Douglas more pathos,\r\nBeecher was more of an embodied thunder-storm, but John Bright was\r\nprobably right when he pronounced Wendell Phillips one of the first\r\norators of his century, or of any century.\r\n\r\nThe man back of Wendell Phillips and the abolition movement was William\r\nLloyd Garrison. This reformer began his career in 1825, as a practical\r\nprinter and occasional writer of articles for the daily press. Among\r\nGarrison's friends were two Quakers, one a young farmer, John Greenleaf\r\nWhittier; the other was Benjamin Lundy, who for several years had spent\r\nhis time and fortune protesting against the slave traffic. Lundy had\r\nvisited Hayti, to examine the conditions of negro life there,--had\r\nreturned to Baltimore, where he had been brutally beaten by a slave\r\ndealer, and had finally come to Boston to test out the anti-slavery\r\nsentiment in New England. He held a meeting in a Baptist church, only to\r\nhave it broken up by the pastor, who refused to allow Lundy to continue\r\nhis remarks, on the ground that his position could only be offensive to\r\nthe South, and therefore dangerous. But Lundy succeeded in having a\r\ncommittee appointed to consider the problem, and young Garrison was one\r\nof its members. A few months later, Garrison was made the editor of a\r\njournal in Bedford, where he began to advance more and more radical\r\ntheories, until a rival editor was irritated to the point of charging\r\nhim with \"the pert loquacity of a blue jay.\" But Garrison's fidelity to\r\nhis own convictions, and his courage in airing them in public, had won\r\nthe respect of the Quaker enthusiast, Lundy, and the old man walked all\r\nthe way from Baltimore to Bedford to ask Garrison to join him in his\r\nwork of agitation. A year later the two men, one old and discouraged,\r\nthe other young and hopeful, both being practically penniless,--started\r\nwork in Baltimore. Troubles came thick and fast. The slave dealer who\r\nhad beaten Lundy now attacked young Garrison. Carelessly worded\r\ncriticisms of a Northern slave dealer from Garrison's own town of\r\nNewburyport led to a suit for libel, and a fine of fifty dollars;\r\nneither man could raise the money to pay the fine, and Garrison went to\r\njail for forty-nine days. But the youth was full of courage and faith,\r\nand in 1831 we find him once more in Boston, starting a new paper, that\r\nwas, if possible, more radical than ever.\r\n\r\nIn this second venture he was alone, his office was a garret, his only\r\nhelper a negro boy whom he had freed. His paper was called the\r\n_Liberator_, and the first edition appeared in January, 1831. Garrison\r\nregistered his sublime vow in his opening editorial: \"I will be as harsh\r\nas truth and as uncompromising as justice.... I am in earnest,--I will\r\nnot equivocate,--I will not excuse,--I will not retract a single\r\ninch,--and I will be heard.\" His battle cry was \"Immediate,\r\nunconditional emancipation on the soil.\"\r\n\r\nNo movement that wrought so great a national convulsion ever had a more\r\nfeeble origin. The Revolutionary fathers had three million colonists as\r\nsupporters. The leaders of the Home Rule movement had four millions of\r\nIrishmen to back them. Cobden and Bright were supported and cheered on\r\nby the manufacturers of Central England. But young Garrison stood alone,\r\nwith empty hands, a slave boy to support, a hand-press printing a sheet\r\ntwelve inches square, never knowing where the money for the next edition\r\nwas to come from. His motto was \"Our country is the world, and our\r\ncountrymen all men, black or white.\" The genius of his message was\r\nunmistakable: \"Is slavery wrong anywhere? Then it is wrong everywhere.\r\nWas it wrong once in Palestine? Then it is wrong in all lands. Is a\r\nwrongdoer bound to do right at any time? Then he is bound to do right\r\ninstantly.\" He distributed his sheets among the merchants of Boston.\r\nBeacon Street shook with laughter, for a new Don Quixote had arisen. But\r\nfrom the first the South was alarmed, for that little sheet from the\r\nprinting-press fell upon the South like the stroke and tread of armed\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe _Liberator_ soon brought friends to this unknown youth. But in\r\nAugust of this same year, 1831, an event occurred which lifted\r\nGarrison,--almost without his being aware of it,--into truly national\r\nprominence. This was the Nat Turner rebellion in Virginia,--a negro\r\nuprising under the leadership of a genuine African slave who knew the\r\nBible by heart, who claimed to have communication with the Holy Spirit,\r\nand who finally employed an eclipse of the sun as a sign to his\r\nfollowers that they were to arise and slay their masters. The massacre\r\nwhich resulted lasted forty-eight hours, and sixty-one white people on\r\nthe neighbouring plantations lost their lives. Retribution followed\r\nswiftly, and where the slightest suspicion of guilt was to be found,\r\nnegroes were shot at sight or burned against the nearest tree.\r\nSouthampton County saw a veritable reign of terror. A storm of\r\nindignation swept over the South; thousands of slave owners living on\r\ntheir great estates, miles from the nearest military station, feared\r\nthemselves victims of a servile insurrection. The cause of the uprising\r\nwas at once sought for, and a hundred writers laid the blame at the door\r\nof the Boston _Liberator_. Garrison was indicted for felony in North\r\nCarolina. The legislature of Georgia offered a reward for $5,000 to any\r\none who would kidnap him and deliver his body within the limits of the\r\nstate. With one voice the entire South cried out that the _Liberator_\r\nmust be suppressed.\r\n\r\nLater it became clear that Garrison's part in the Nat Turner rebellion\r\nwas nil. The _Liberator_ had not a single subscriber in the South; Nat\r\nTurner had never seen a copy of the paper,--and Garrison had been\r\nspecific in his statements that he did not believe in active resistance\r\nto authority, or in the use of force of any kind. But the storm had\r\nbroken, and Garrison had to fight his way through it.\r\n\r\nEven in Boston Garrison had to face the mob, and meet the scorn of the\r\nruling classes of the city. His movement had no popular support, in the\r\ntrue sense of the word, as it had twenty years later, when Wendell\r\nPhillips led the forces of abolition. Cotton was king, and the fear of\r\nlosing the Southern trade sent the mercantile classes into a panic of\r\nfear. Garrison's enemies were by no means confined to the South. He was\r\nlike David with his sling; and slavery, with all its vassals, North as\r\nwell as South, was Goliath armed with steel. But for Garrison there were\r\nonly two words, Right and Wrong, and he would not compromise concerning\r\neither.\r\n\r\nWithin two years he succeeded in organizing in Philadelphia the American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society; by 1835 he convinced William Ellery Channing that\r\nthe time had fully come for an active crusade, and this old minister,\r\nwith a literary reputation in Europe almost as great as that of\r\nWashington Irving, published an abolition book called \"Slavery,\" which\r\nis said to have been read by every prominent man in public life. In 1840\r\nthe society numbered not less than 200,000, and the hardest of\r\nGarrison's work was done.\r\n\r\nBut he was to have a potent ally in Wendell Phillips, the explanation of\r\nwhose career is in his birth gifts. One of his ancestors was a Cambridge\r\ngraduate, who rebelled against the tyranny of Charles, and exchanged\r\nwealth and position for a New England wilderness. It was one of his\r\nforefathers who was the first mayor of Boston. Another founded Phillips\r\nExeter Academy. Wendell Phillips himself began his career at the moment\r\nwhen Madison's State Papers had won him the presidency, when John Adams\r\nwas the glory of the city, when Channing was the light of the pulpit,\r\nand Lyman Beecher was the idol of orthodox Boston. He was in his early\r\nteens when he waited four hours on a Boston wharf to see Lafayette's\r\nboat come in. He was thirteen when he heard Daniel Webster's oration on\r\nAdams and Jefferson. He was sixteen when he entered Harvard College, and\r\nformed his lifelong friendship with his roommate, John Lothrop Motley.\r\nHe studied law with Charles Sumner, in the office of Judge Story, a\r\nlegal star of the first magnitude. He was counted one of the handsomest\r\nyouths in Boston. There was nothing too bright or too hard for Wendell\r\nPhillips to aspire to, or hope for. At the critical moment, when he had\r\nto decide upon his future career, ambition sang to him, as to every\r\nnoble youth. George William Curtis represents Phillips as sometimes\r\nforecasting the future, as he saw himself \"succeeding Ames, and Otis and\r\nWebster, rising from the bar to the Legislature, from the Legislature to\r\nthe Senate, from the Senate--who knows whither? He was already the idol\r\nof society, the applauded orator, the brilliant champion of the eloquent\r\nrefinement and the conservatism of Massachusetts. The delight of social\r\nease, the refined enjoyment of taste and letters and art, opulence,\r\nleisure, professional distinction, gratified ambition, all offered\r\nbribes to the young student.\" The measure of his manhood is in the way\r\nhe thrust aside all honours and emoluments that stood in the path of\r\nduty. Only he who knows what he renounces gains the true blessing of\r\nrenunciation.\r\n\r\nThe young orator's attitude towards slavery was determined by the\r\nmobbing of Garrison. One October afternoon in 1835 Wendell Phillips sat\r\nreading by an open window in his office on Court Street. Suddenly his\r\nattention was diverted from the page by voices, angry and profane,\r\nrising from the street without. Looking down he saw a multitude moving\r\nup the street, and soon found that the multitude had become a mob. Five\r\nthousand men were collected in front of the anti-slavery office, and\r\nwere trying to crowd their way up the stairs in search of Garrison. In\r\nanother room thirty women were assembled to organize a woman's abolition\r\nsociety. When the women found that the mob wanted to put them out also,\r\nthey sent a message to Mayor Lyman asking protection. When the mayor\r\narrived with the police, instead of dispelling the mob and protecting\r\nliberty of speech, the mayor dispelled the women and protected the mob.\r\nDiscovering that they had the sympathy of the mayor and would be\r\nprotected by the police, the lawless element rushed upon the office of\r\nthe _Liberator_, smashed in the doors and windows, and dragged Garrison\r\nforth. Bareheaded, with a rope about his waist, his coat torn off, but\r\nwith erect head, set lips, flashing eyes, Garrison was dragged down the\r\nstreet to the City Hall. On every side rose the shout \"Kill him! Lynch\r\nhim! ---- the abolitionist!\" Asking who the man was, Phillips was told\r\nthat this was Garrison, the editor of the _Liberator_. Meeting the\r\ncommander of the Boston regiment, of which he was a member, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Why does not the mayor call out the troops? This is\r\noutrageous!\" \"Why,\" answered the officer, \"don't you see that our\r\nmilitia are also the mob?\" It was all too true. The mob was made up of\r\nmen of property and standing. In that hour Wendell Phillips had his\r\ncall. In the person of that man dragged down the street with a rope\r\naround his waist, the most gifted speaker in Boston had found his\r\nclient; in the crusade against slavery he found his cause, and soon his\r\nclarion voice was heard sounding the onset.\r\n\r\nTo Garrison's organized agitation, begun in 1832, that soon spread all\r\nover the country, must be added a second cause for anti-slavery\r\nsentiment,--the murder of Lovejoy. This was on the night of November 7,\r\n1837. The Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy was a young Presbyterian minister, a\r\ngraduate of Princeton Seminary. He began his career as pastor of a\r\nlittle church in St. Louis and editor of the _Presbyterian Observer_. At\r\nthat time he was not an abolitionist, and, perhaps because he had\r\nmarried the daughter of a slave owner, he had taken no strong position\r\neither for or against slavery. One day an officer arrested a black man\r\nin St. Louis who resisted arrest, and in the mêlée the officer was\r\nkilled. His friends claimed that the negro was a freeman, and that there\r\nwas a plot to kidnap him and sell him into the Southern cotton fields,\r\nand that he had a right to resist. The real facts will, doubtless, never\r\nbe known. To slave owners, however, it was intolerable that a black man\r\nshould resist an officer under any circumstances. A mob collected, the\r\nnegro was bound to a stake, wood piled round about, and the prisoner was\r\nburned to death.\r\n\r\nEfforts were made to punish the murderers. In the irony of events the\r\nname of the judge was Lawless, and he charged the grand jury\r\nsubstantially as follows: \"When men are hurried by some mysterious\r\nmetaphysical electric frenzy to commit a deed of violence they are\r\nabsolved from guilt. If you should find that such was the fact in this\r\ncase, then act not at all. The case transcends your jurisdiction, and is\r\nbeyond the reach of human law.\" Of course all the murderers went free.\r\nWhen Mr. Lovejoy commented editorially upon this outrageous charge,\r\nencouraging lynch law, once again the \"mysterious, metaphysical\r\nelectric frenzy\" broke forth, only this time it destroyed his printing\r\noffice. The young minister decided to leave the slave State, and crossed\r\nto Alton, Illinois, where there was not only liberty of speech but\r\nliberty of the printing-press. But a mob crossed over from Missouri and\r\ndestroyed his press. Determined to maintain his rights, Lovejoy then\r\nbrought another press down the Ohio River from Cincinnati. A group of\r\nhis friends carried the type from the steamboat to the warehouse, but\r\nthe next night a second mob collected, and when Lovejoy stepped from the\r\nbuilding he was riddled with bullets, the warehouse burned, and the\r\npress, for the third time, flung into the Mississippi. The news of this\r\nmurder aroused the continent, filling the South with exultation, and the\r\nNorth with alarm. Slavery, a subject which had long been tabooed,\r\nsuddenly became the one topic of conversation in the home, the store,\r\nthe street-car. All editors wrote about it; all Northern pulpits began\r\nto preach on the subject. More faggots had been flung upon the fire, and\r\noil added to the fierce flames.\r\n\r\nEvery explosion asks for powder, but also a spark. Falling on ice, a\r\nspark is impotent, falling on powder, an explosion is inevitable.\r\nWendell Phillips had already been aroused to sympathy with Garrison and\r\nhatred of slavery, and news of the murder of Lovejoy fell upon his heart\r\nlike a spark on a powder magazine. When Boston heard that Lovejoy had\r\nbeen shot by the mob in Alton, Illinois, while defending his\r\nprinting-press, the leading men of Boston came together in Faneuil Hall.\r\nWilliam Ellery Channing made the opening address, and asked that the\r\nmeeting go on record through an indignant protest against this assault\r\nupon the rights of free citizens. James T. Austin, attorney-general of\r\nthe commonwealth, replied in a bitter and insulting reference to\r\nChanning, asserting that a clergyman with a gun in his hand, or mingling\r\nin the debate of a popular assembly in Faneuil Hall, was marvellously\r\nout of place. Austin compared the slaves of the South to a menagerie of\r\nwild beasts, and asserted that Lovejoy in defending them was\r\npresumptuous, and died as a fool dieth. He added that the rioters in\r\nAlton killed Lovejoy and flung his press into the river in the spirit of\r\nthe Boston mob that boarded the British ships in 1773, and threw the\r\ntea overboard on the night of the \"Boston Tea Party.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a great moment in the history not only of liberty, but also in\r\nthat of eloquence. Wendell Phillips, then but six years out of Harvard\r\nCollege, rose to reply. \"A comparison has been drawn between the events\r\nof the Revolution and the tragedy at Alton. We have heard it asserted\r\nhere in Faneuil Hall that Great Britain had a right to tax the colonies.\r\nAnd we have heard the mob at Alton, drunken murderers of Lovejoy,\r\ncompared to those patriot fathers who threw the tea overboard! Fellow\r\ncitizens, is this Faneuil Hall doctrine? The mob at Alton were met to\r\nwrest from a citizen his just rights,--met to resist the laws. Lovejoy\r\nhad stationed himself within constitutional bulwarks. He was not only\r\ndefending the freedom of the press, but he was under his own roof, in\r\narms with the sanction of the civil authority. The men who assailed him\r\nwent against and over the laws. The mob, as the gentleman terms it (mob,\r\nforsooth!--certainly we sons of the tea-spillers are a marvellously\r\npatient generation!), the 'orderly mob' which assembled in the Old South\r\nto destroy the tea were met to resist, not the laws, but illegal\r\nexactions. Shame on the American who calls the tea tax and Stamp Act\r\nlaws! Our fathers resisted, not the king's prerogative, but the king's\r\nusurpation. To find any other account you must read our revolutionary\r\nhistory upside down. To draw the conduct of our ancestors into a\r\nprecedent for mobs is an insult to their memory. They were the people\r\nrising to sustain the laws and constitution of the province. The rioters\r\nof our day go for their own wills, right or wrong. Sir, when I heard the\r\ngentleman lay down principles which place the murderers of Alton side by\r\nside with Otis and Hancock, with Quincy and Adams, I thought those\r\npictured lips [pointing to the portraits in the hall] would have broken\r\ninto voice to rebuke the recreant American,--the slanderer of the dead.\r\nSir, for the sentiments he has uttered, on soil consecrated by the\r\nprayers of Puritans and the blood of patriots, the earth should have\r\nyawned and swallowed him up. Imprudent to defend the liberty of the\r\npress! Why? Because the defense was unsuccessful? Does success gild\r\ncrime into patriotism, and the want of it change heroic self-devotion\r\ninto imprudence? Was Hampden imprudent when he drew the sword and threw\r\naway the scabbard?\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning young Phillips, like Lord Byron, awoke to find himself\r\nfamous. Merchants, politicians, who had long been staggering like\r\ndrunken men, indifferent to their rights, and confused in their\r\nfeelings, were stunned into sobriety, and began to discuss principles,\r\nand weigh characters, and analyze public leaders, and wakening, men\r\nfound that they had been standing on the edge of a precipice. Phillips,\r\nalready devoted to the slave, became now his tireless champion through\r\nmany years, till the emancipation of 1863.\r\n\r\nOne evening in May, 1854, a negro was seen skulking in the shadows near\r\na dock in Boston. This coloured man, Anthony Burns by name, was a slave,\r\nwho had escaped from his Southern master, and after weeks had reached\r\nPhiladelphia, where a Quaker had stowed him away in a ship bound for\r\nBoston. A Boston policeman who caught sight of the negro recalled the\r\nrewards offered for the capture of slaves, and soon ran the fugitive\r\ndown, and had him before United States Commissioner Loring. The next\r\nmorning Theodore Parker hastened to the court-room to say that he was\r\nthe chaplain of the Abolition Society, and had come to offer counsel.\r\nBut the fugitive was afraid to accept the overture, lest his master\r\npunish him the more severely.\r\n\r\nThe news spread quickly throughout the city, and two nights later a\r\nmeeting in Faneuil Hall was attended by an enormous gathering, aroused\r\nto the highest pitch of excitement. Hand-bills had been put out, stating\r\nthat kidnappers were in the city. The people were in a frenzy. Theodore\r\nParker delivered one of his most impassioned addresses. \"I am an old\r\nman; I have heard hurrahs and cheers for liberty many times; I have not\r\nseen a great many _deeds_ done for liberty. I ask you, Are we to have\r\ndeeds as well as words?\" Parker moved that, when the meeting adjourned,\r\nit should be to meet the following morning in the square before the\r\ncourt-house. But he had raised too great a storm to control; a rumour\r\nthat a mob of negroes was at that very moment trying to rescue Burns was\r\nall that was needed to empty the room; and the crowd rushed out to the\r\ncourt-house square. There they discovered a small party of men, led by\r\nThomas W. Higginson, trying to batter down the court-house doors. The\r\ncrowd lent them willing hands. But the marshall defended the\r\nbuilding,--shots were fired,--Higginson wounded, and several of his\r\nfollowers arrested. Two companies of artillery were at once ordered out\r\nby the mayor, and the attempt to rescue the negro met with complete and\r\ndisastrous failure. Wendell Phillips and Parker were the leaders in the\r\nfight. When asked what he would regard as grounds for the return of\r\nBurns to his master, Phillips answered, \"Nothing short of a bill of sale\r\nfrom Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nThe day of the transfer of the slave to the United States revenue cutter\r\nfound Boston in a state of siege. Twenty-two companies of Massachusetts\r\nsoldiers patrolled the city; two rows of soldiers, armed with muskets,\r\nshotted to kill, stood on either side of the street through which Burns\r\nwas to be led to the vessel. The windows were filled with people, the\r\nhouses hung in black, the United States flags were draped in mourning.\r\nFrom a window near the court-house hung a coffin, with the legend: \"The\r\nfuneral of liberty.\" The procession itself was composed of a battalion\r\nof United States artillery, one of United States marines, the\r\nmarshall's posse of 125 men guarding the fugitive, and a small cannon,\r\nwith two more platoons of marines to guard it. To such a pass had come\r\nBoston, with its respect for law, and its reputation for obedience to\r\nthose clothed in authority. A Charleston paper spoke of the return of\r\nBurns as a Southern victory, but added that two or three such victories\r\nwould ruin the cause. For the movement against slavery was now rising,\r\nwith all the advance of a tidal wave and a mighty storm.\r\n\r\nThe public excitement was greatly increased by the Fugitive Slave\r\nlegislation of 1850 and 1854. Many Northern men who were opposed to\r\nslavery in the North condoned slavery in the South. Just as Demetrius\r\nurged that by the making of images of Diana \"we have our gain,\" so timid\r\ncapital in the North bowed like a suitor at the feet of the imperial\r\nSouth, and advised silence, remembering that through the money of\r\nSouthern planters it had its livelihood. Wendell Phillips went up and\r\ndown the land stirring up opinion against the law. He spoke three\r\nhundred times in one year and two hundred and seventy-five times in\r\nanother year. Phillips rose upon the opposition like a war eagle\r\nagainst an advancing storm. Brave men defied the law, organized the\r\nUnderground Railroad, and in every way possible defeated the purpose of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law. So in 1854 when Senator Douglas engineered\r\nthrough Congress the famous Kansas-Nebraska Bill, repealing the Missouri\r\nCompromise, the North refused to accept what was so palpably pro-slavery\r\nlegislation. This was revolutionary. Instantly the North divided into\r\ntwo camps. The one question of the hour was \"Shall a fugitive slave be\r\nfurnished with weapons with which to defend his person, and has he the\r\nright of self-defense?\" The whole land became a debating society, and\r\nheaved with excitement, like the heaving of an earthquake. The merchant\r\npointed to his ledger, and urged caution. But liberty was stronger than\r\nthe ledger, and the heaving emotion burst through the statutes and rent\r\nthe laws asunder. Soon the Fugitive Slave Law, had become a dead letter.\r\nThe South had gone one step too far. Abolition stood suddenly in a new\r\nlight; \"More abolitionists had been made by this single piece of hostile\r\nlegislation,\" said Greeley, \"than Garrison and Phillips could have made\r\nin half a century.\"\r\n\r\nFor thirty years Wendell Phillips was the crowned king of the lecture\r\nplatform. It was the golden age of the lyceum. Men had more leisure than\r\nto-day. Our era of the drama, music, and travel pictures had not yet\r\ncome. The winter nights were long, books few, magazines had not yet\r\ndeveloped, and the people were hungry for instruction and eloquence.\r\nWendell Phillips achieved the astonishing feat of speaking three hundred\r\ntimes a year. Eloquence is born of a great theme like the woes and\r\nwrongs of three million slaves. It is sometimes said that oratory is\r\ndying out in our Congress. But Congress is now a board of trade,\r\ndiscussing duties, protective tariffs on wool, cotton, and hides.\r\nBeecher and Phillips had a great theme--liberty, the emancipation of\r\nmillions of slaves. The modern orator in the Senate discusses the\r\nmathematics of woolen goods. It is hard to be eloquent over one salt\r\nbarrel and two piles of cowhides. A sermon or a lecture on topics that\r\nfifty years ago would have crowded the greatest room and the street\r\noutside would not to-day draw a corporal's guard.\r\n\r\nBut in those heroic days, there was a great opportunity, and the\r\nopportunity was matched by the man. Phillips was handsome as an Apollo.\r\nHis voice was sweet as a harp. No man ever studied the art of public\r\nspeech more scientifically. He played upon an audience as a skillful\r\nmusician upon the banks of keys in an organ. A Southern slaveholder\r\nheard him in the Academy of Music, hating him, but paying him this\r\ntribute, \"That man is an infernal machine set to music.\" His method was\r\npractically the memoriter method. A gentleman, who heard him give his\r\n\"Daniel O'Connell\" four times in succession, found that the lecture was\r\nrepeated without the slightest variation whatsoever, in ideas,\r\nsentences, inflection of the voice, or even gesture. Phillips prepared\r\nhis lectures with the greatest care, and then repeated them hundreds of\r\ntimes. From the moment when he came upon the platform his presence\r\nfilled the eye and satisfied it. His very ease and poise begat\r\nconfidence and delight. He carved each sentence out of solid sunshine.\r\nHe stood quietly, made few gestures, adopted the conversational tone and\r\ntook the audience into his confidence.\r\n\r\nSome of his finest effects were produced by the injection of a\r\nparenthesis. Once in an evening sermon in Plymouth Church, when Beecher\r\nwas urging the reëlection of Lincoln and defending the Republican party,\r\na disputatious individual called out from the congregation, \"What about\r\nWendell Phillips?\" To which Mr. Beecher made the instant answer,\r\n\"Wendell Phillips is not a Republican. Wendell Phillips is a radical and\r\nan independent. What this country needs is not a man of words but a man\r\nof deeds.\" A few nights later Wendell Phillips was lecturing in the\r\nBrooklyn Academy of Music before the St. Patrick's Society, and made his\r\nreply in the form of a parenthesis, barbing his shaft with an exquisite\r\ninflection of his voice. \"Mr. Beecher said last Sunday night\r\n(_forgetting his own vocation_), 'Wendell Phillips is a man of words,\r\ninstead of a man of deeds.'\"\r\n\r\nNot that the two men were ever unfriendly, for they were co-workers,\r\nstanding side by side in the great movement. Once when the trustees of\r\nyonder Academy refused to allow Mr. Phillips to speak, Mr. Beecher made\r\nit a point of honour with his trustees to let Wendell Phillips speak in\r\nPlymouth Church, and ran the risk of the mob destroying the building.\r\nThe tumultuous scenes of that night, when bricks came through the\r\nwindows, and the police were stationed in Cranberry and Orange Streets,\r\nwere repeated all over the land. Again and again Wendell Phillips was\r\nmobbed. Once, at the very beginning of his career as an abolitionist, he\r\nspoke with an old Quaker. People waited to greet the old Quaker and\r\nasked him home for the night; but they pelted Wendell Phillips with\r\nrotten eggs as he went down the street in the dark. Afterwards Wendell\r\nPhillips said to the old Quaker, \"I said just what you did, and yet you\r\nwere invited home to fried chicken and a bed, while I received raw eggs\r\nand stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell thee the difference, Wendell. Thou said, 'If thou art a\r\nholder of slaves, thou wilt go to hell.' I said, 'If thou dost not hold\r\nslaves, thou wilt not go to hell.'\"\r\n\r\nBut Wendell Phillips would not butter parsnips with fine words. Once in\r\nBoston four hundred men surrounded him, got possession of the hall, and\r\njeered him for an hour and a half. Finally he leaned over the desk and\r\nshouted down to a reporter, \"Thank God there is no manacle for the\r\nprinting-press.\" Armed friends rescued him, guarded him home, and for a\r\nweek, night and day, the Boston police guarded the house. Those were\r\ntumultuous days. But this great man braved and outlived the storm.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emancipation Proclamation was declared, William Lloyd Garrison\r\nsaid nothing remained now but to die. But Phillips opposed the\r\ndissolution of the Anti-Slavery Society, because he saw that when the\r\nphysical fetters were broken, there still remained the fetters of the\r\nmind and heart that must be destroyed. So far from ending his labours,\r\nPhillips now redoubled his activities. He threw himself into the labour\r\nmovement and helped organize the working classes into a solid force\r\nagainst capitalism. He took up the cause of suffrage and the higher\r\neducation of woman, gave himself to the temperance problem and\r\nprohibition. He lectured oftentimes two hundred nights a year in the\r\ngreat cities of the land, seeking always to manufacture manhood of a\r\ngood quality. He became himself our finest example of the power and\r\ninfluence of the scholar in the Republic. And when the end came, he\r\nreceived from his fellow countrymen the admiration and the love that he\r\nhad deserved. And the friends who knew him best were not surprised that\r\nthe last words on his lips were the words of his friend James Russell\r\nLowell, that summarized the ideal that Wendell Phillips had pursued for\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\n  \"New occasions teach new duties; Time makes ancient good uncouth;\r\n  They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast of Truth;\r\n  Lo, before us gleam her camp-fires! we ourselves must Pilgrims be,\r\n  Launch our _Mayflower_, and steer boldly through the desperate winter\r\n      sea,\r\n  Nor attempt the Future's portal with the Past's blood-rusted key.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER: THE APPEAL TO EDUCATED MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every country and time, the era of national peril has been the\r\ncreative era for the intellect. The eloquence of Greece was at its best\r\nwhen Philip attacked Athens and Demosthenes defended its liberties.\r\nDante's poems were born of the collision between the despots who sought\r\nto enslave Florence, and the patriots who dreamed of democracy. Milton's\r\nsongs were written during the English Revolution, when the Puritan,\r\nseeking to diffuse the good things of life, and the Cavalier, who wished\r\nto monopolize the earth's treasure, came into a deadly collision.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with that principle it seems natural to expect that the\r\nscholars of the Republic should do their best work during the era of\r\nagitation, when the national intellect was white hot, and public\r\nexcitement burned by day and night. The anti-slavery epoch, therefore,\r\nwas the Augustan Era of American literature, when the historians, poets\r\nand philosophers lent distinction to American literature. At that time\r\nMotley was writing his \"History of the Netherlands\"; Prescott, his\r\n\"History of Mexico and Spain\"; Whittier, his songs of slavery and\r\nfreedom; Lowell was the satirist of the debate, and was writing his\r\n\"Biglow Papers,\" and Emerson, the philosopher, was undermining the\r\nfoundations and shaking the principles of slavery, even as Samson pulled\r\ndown the temple of the olden time.\r\n\r\nEmerson, the philosopher, did the thinking, and furnished the\r\nintellectual implements to the abolitionists. Beginning his career as a\r\npreacher, he resigned his position, moved to Concord, and dwelt apart\r\nfrom men, but \"as he mused, the fire burned.\" Easily our first man of\r\nAmerican letters, he is among the first essayists of all ages and\r\nclimes. Essentially, however, he was a man of intellect, an American\r\nPlato, \"a Greek head screwed upon Yankee shoulders,\" to use Holmes'\r\nexpression. His essay upon \"The American Scholar,\" and his book on\r\n\"Nature,\" brought him fame in England, and invitations to lecture before\r\ntheir colleges. Early in his career he won the friendship of Arnold of\r\nRugby, of Matthew Arnold the son, of Arthur Hugh Clough, and of Thomas\r\nCarlyle. He returned from his honours in England to find himself the\r\ncentre of the intellectual movement of New England. A number of younger\r\nmen gathered around him, until Emerson's group at Concord became like\r\nunto Goethe's group at Weimar, and Coleridge's in London. During the\r\nlate forties American educators, orators and statesmen began to quote\r\nthe striking sentences from Emerson. Little by little it came about that\r\nthe fighters went to Emerson as to an arsenal for their intellectual\r\nweapons. His first notable contribution to abolitionism was his \"Story\r\nof the West India Emancipation.\" Then came his \"Essay on the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law,\" his speech on the Assault on Mr. Sumner, his writings on\r\nKansas, and on John Brown. Few men have had such power to condense a\r\nstatement of philosophy into a single epigram. Grant once said of his\r\nsoldiers that while each man took aim for himself, Winchester slew all\r\nthe thousands. Not otherwise, hundreds of orators and reformers went up\r\nand down the land attacking slavery, but while the voices were many,\r\nthe argument was one, and Emerson for a time did the speaking for the\r\nabolitionists.\r\n\r\nWhat Emerson stated in pure white light, Whittier made popular through\r\nhis poems of Slavery and Freedom. By way of preëminence he was the poet\r\nof the abolition movement, and the Sir Galahad among our singers. Reared\r\namong the Friends, he had the simplicity of the Quaker, but the solidity\r\nand massiveness of the fighting Puritan. Strange as it may seem, he was\r\nat once the poet of peace, insisting upon the crime of war, and the poet\r\nof freedom, insisting upon the destruction of slavery. The fire and\r\nglow, the moral earnestness, the spiritual passion of Whittier, are best\r\nillustrated in his \"Lost Occasion,\" and \"Ichabod.\" At length the\r\nnewspapers of the North took up his work. For some years before the war\r\nbroke out, scarcely a month passed by without a new poem of liberty by\r\nWhittier. Soon these poems that were published in the newspapers were\r\nrecited in the schools by the children, quoted in the pulpits by the\r\npreachers, and used by the orators as feathers for their arrows. Once\r\nWendell Phillips concluded an impassioned oration by reciting one of\r\nWhittier's stanzas, when a man in the audience shouted, \"That arrow\r\nwent home!\" to which Wendell Phillips answered, \"Yes, and I have a\r\nquiver full of arrows, every one of which was made by a man of\r\npeace,--John Greenleaf Whittier.\" If Emerson's philosophy was like the\r\ndiffused white daylight that makes clear the landscape for an army,\r\nWhittier's occasional poems like \"Ichabod\" were thunderbolts that\r\nblasted forever all compromise and expediency.\r\n\r\nSometimes what the essayist fails to achieve ridicule easily\r\naccomplishes. James Russell Lowell was the satirist of the abolition\r\nmovement. With biting scorn and irony he laughed men out of narrowness,\r\nignorance, and selfishness. During the last epoch in his career Lowell\r\nachieved world-wide fame as a diplomat, and was universally admired as\r\nthe all round man of letters. But now that he has gone, in retrospect,\r\nthe historian perceives that the first era of Lowell's career was the\r\ninfluential era. He was the Milton of the anti-slavery epoch, as Lincoln\r\nwas its Cromwell. His influence in England, in developing an\r\nanti-slavery sentiment there, was, if possible, more influential than in\r\nthe home country. The great English editor, William Stead, tells us\r\nthat he owes to Lowell's message the influences that made him an editor\r\nand a reformer. In the critical moments of his life he found in Lowell\r\nthe inspiration and support that he found in no other books, save in\r\nCarlyle's \"Cromwell\" and the Bible. \"In Russia, in Ireland, in Rome, and\r\nin prison, Lowell's poems have been my constant companions.\" The poet\r\nused the story of Moses emancipating the Hebrew slaves as an\r\nillustration of the abolitionist as the unknown leader whom God would\r\nraise up to lead the three million black men out of Southern slavery.\r\n\"What God did for the Egyptian bondsmen, he believed God would do;\r\nbecause what God was, God is. He goes on:--\r\n\r\n\"From what a Bible can a man choose his text to-day! A Bible which needs\r\nno translation; and which no priestcraft can close from the laity,--the\r\nopen volume of the world, upon which, with a pen of sunshine and\r\ndestroying fire, the inspired Present is even now writing the annals of\r\nGod. Methinks the editor who should understand his calling, and be equal\r\nthereto, would truly deserve that title that Homer bestows upon princes.\r\nHe would be the Moses of our nineteenth century; and whereas the old\r\nSinai, silent now, is but a common mountain, stared at by the elegant\r\ntourist, and crawled over by the hammer of the geologist, he must find\r\nhis tables of the new law here among factories and cities in this\r\nwilderness of sin, called the progress of civilization, and be the\r\ncaptain of our exodus into the Canaan of a truer social order.\"\r\n\r\nCertain stanzas of Lowell, also, were quoted even more widely, and were\r\never upon the lips of college students. Many a soldier boy who went to\r\nbattle from the forest and factory, the fields and the mines, scarcely\r\nknew that his inspiration--like Phillip's oratory--was embodied in\r\nLowell's poem, \"The Present Crisis\":--\r\n\r\n  \"Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,\r\n  In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;\r\n  Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight,\r\n  Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the right,\r\n  And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light.\r\n\r\n  \"Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record\r\n  One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the Word;\r\n  Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne,--\r\n  Yet that scaffold sways the future, and, behind the dim unknown,\r\n  Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own.\"\r\n\r\nThen came Charles Sumner, the scholar in politics, to make practical the\r\nstudent's message. Daniel Webster's defense of Massachusetts in his\r\nreply to Hayne, and his wonderful eloquence in the years which followed\r\nthat first great address, lifted the old Bay State into unique\r\npreëminence in the Senate: when, therefore, Webster left the Senate and\r\nentered the cabinet of Millard Fillmore, the North and the South alike\r\nasked, with intense interest, who should succeed the defender of the\r\nConstitution. That no dramatic interest might be lacking when, in 1851,\r\nCharles Sumner entered the Senate chamber to take the oath of office, it\r\ncame about that Henry Clay, the great Compromiser, left the Senate,\r\ngoing out at one door, on the very day that Conscience, in the person of\r\nthis Puritan, entered it by the other door. John C. Calhoun, inflexible,\r\niron to the end, adhering tenaciously to his doctrine of secession, had\r\njust died, quite unconscious of the fact that his speeches held the\r\nexplosives that were to shatter the South and destroy half a million of\r\nhis beloved people. Clay, too, was death-stricken, and with great pathos\r\nreferred to himself as \"a stag scarred by spears, worried by wounds,\r\ndragging his mutilated body to his lair to lie down and die.\" Webster\r\nwas now gray and broken, with the shadow of the eclipse already drawing\r\nnear. In such a moment Charles Sumner began his career by an appeal to\r\nthe \"everlasting yea\" and the \"everlasting nay.\"--\"I desire to speak\r\nto-day of some laws greater than any passed in this capital or this\r\ncountry; older than America, older than India--I mean the laws of God.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto slavery had been the aggressor, crowding into Texas, edging\r\ninto Missouri, with bullets forcing its way into Kansas. Freedom had\r\nalways been on the defensive. Now all was changed, with the coming of a\r\nman whose watchword was \"Slavery must be destroyed; liberty must be\r\npreserved.\" That cold body called the Senate became immediately\r\nconscious of the new influence that entered into the very being of the\r\ngovernment, like iron into the rich blood of the physical system.\r\nCharles Sumner made it clear from the beginning that the movement\r\nagainst slavery was from the Everlasting Arm. With expediency he had\r\nnothing to do, but only with eternal right and eternal wrong. One day\r\nDaniel Webster reminded his young successor of the importance of looking\r\non the other side, indicating that a shield that was gold on one side\r\nmight at least be silver on the other, to which Sumner replied, \"There\r\nis no other side.\" This Boston scholar became a voice for law, \"whose\r\nseat is the bosom of God, and whose speech is the melody of the world.\"\r\nThese eternal laws of God rose up to stay the progress of slavery like\r\nthe beetling granite cliffs of Maine, that send forth their voice to the\r\nonrushing tides, saying, \"Here stay your proud waves--thus far, and no\r\nfarther.\"\r\n\r\nAncestry, opportunity and events all conspired to equip Charles Sumner\r\nwith those implements that make man great. Like Phillips, he was a\r\ndescendant of the early settlers of Boston. His father led the men who\r\ndelivered Garrison out of the hands of the mob, and who told the excited\r\npopulace that unless Boston was careful \"our children's heads will be\r\nbroken by cannon-balls.\" The plastic, critical hours of his youth were\r\nspent in Harvard College and in the law office of Judge Story. Never\r\ninterested in philosophy and metaphysics, he was surpassed by few as a\r\nmaster of the humanities, general literature, and the story of the rise\r\nand progress of democracy and free institutions. Not a man of genius,\r\nCharles Sumner was gifted with talent of a very high order. He had, what\r\nis perhaps better than genius, a capacity for sustained labour and\r\nprodigious industry. He did nothing by halves. In his chosen realm he\r\nbecame a master of the details of every movement related to free\r\ninstitutions, since the days of the republics of Greece and Switzerland,\r\nHolland and England. Long after other students had blown out their\r\nlights, Charles Sumner's window was still flaming. At a very early epoch\r\nhe exhibited his tenacity of will and his constitutional inability to\r\nchange his mind. Once he planned with a companion to walk to Boston on\r\nSaturday morning, starting at half-past seven. When the hour struck, a\r\nsnow-storm was raging. But having decided to go to Boston, to Boston the\r\nstudent went alone, floundering through the blizzard. Snow-drifts were\r\nlittle things, but changing his plan was an impossible thing. The\r\ncentre of his character, about which all else revolved, was a certain\r\naxis of pride and self-esteem, which may be pardoned, perhaps, in view\r\nof the fact that the world takes a man largely upon his own estimate of\r\npersonal worth.\r\n\r\nIn those days the atmosphere of Boston was charged with enthusiasm for\r\neducation and the humanities. Among young Sumner's friends were\r\nPrescott, who was writing the history of Spain and Mexico; Bancroft, who\r\nwas outlining his history of the United States; Story, the jurist;\r\nHorace Mann, the educator; Dr. Howe, the father of the movement for the\r\neducation of the deaf and dumb; Emerson, Longfellow, Channing and\r\nWhittier--all were not simply friends but correspondents of Charles\r\nSumner.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget the Boston of earlier days, the Boston of Adams, and\r\nOtis, of Warren and Quincy. In such a city, surrounded by the noblest\r\ntraditions of patriotism, stimulated by the greatest group of scholars\r\nthat the Republic has produced, Charles Sumner passed his early manhood.\r\nThen, remembering that Edward Everett had fitted himself for his work in\r\nHarvard University by four years abroad, Sumner, in his twenty-seventh\r\nyear, went to Europe. He spent five months in Germany, where the spirits\r\nof Goethe, Richter and Luther lingered upon the scene. In Paris he\r\nstudied French, French art, French literature, French philosophy, and\r\nfinally attended the debates in the French Parliament, examining the\r\nproblems with all the care of a member. He lingered long in England,\r\nwhere he was welcomed and lionized by the foremost men of letters,\r\nscience, philosophy, as well as by the leading clergymen and statesmen\r\nof London. He was an honoured guest not at some, but \"at most of the\r\ncountry seats of England and Scotland.\" He travelled the circuits as the\r\ncompanion of the greatest English judges, Vaughan, Parke and Alderson.\r\nHe met on a familiar footing Macaulay and Grote, Carlyle and Jeffrey,\r\nSidney Smith and Wordsworth. But his great year was in Italy, in the\r\nEternal City, the city of Cæsar and Cicero, the city of Horace and\r\nVirgil. In all, Sumner spent thirty years in preparation for his labour.\r\nFew men in American politics have had a wider horizon, a better\r\nequipment in history and literature, or have known so intimately all the\r\ngreat men in the world of his own generation who were worth knowing. He\r\nwent away to Europe an American; he returned a universal man, a citizen\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nNot until 1845, when he was thirty-four years of age, did a really great\r\nopportunity come to Sumner. Boston at that far-off day made much of the\r\nFourth of July, and looked forward to the holiday as the great event of\r\nthe year. During the previous autumn the mayor and aldermen of the city\r\ninvited Sumner to deliver the oration. Webster made John Adams say,\r\n\"When we are in our graves, our children will celebrate the day with\r\nsong and story, with oration and pageant, and the explosion of cannon,\r\nand greet it with tears of joy and exultation.\" But unfortunately the\r\nspeeches of that time had degenerated into false rhetoric, full of\r\ninsincerity. In his oration, Sumner left the beaten track and plunged\r\ninto an unknown way. His theme was the crime of war. He attacked his\r\ncity and his country for spending millions upon fortifications in the\r\nharbour. He affirmed that the best protection of a nation was not dead\r\nstones but living patriots and heroes. He called the roll of the great\r\nwars of history, and found only one or two, like our Revolution, that\r\nwere really justifiable. He defined war as the temporary repeal of all\r\nthe ten commandments, and an enthronement of all the crimes.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect we know that Sumner overstated his case. His argument\r\nagainst physical force would forbid the police in great cities, the\r\nmilitia on the frontier, and would leave communities exposed to the\r\nravages of brigands on land and pirates by sea. But for the most part,\r\nSumner's argument in favour of peace was sound. To-day all civilized\r\ncountries are coming to recognize war as a blunder, since questions of\r\njustice cannot be settled by brute force.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that France is an armed camp, Germany and Austria\r\ncountries of bristling bayonets, that three years at the most critical\r\nepoch of the boy's life are consumed in a camp exposed to all manner of\r\ntemptations and dangers, at the very time when the youth should be\r\nmastering his trade or his profession, war seems the capitalization of\r\nall the possible follies and wastes. The peasants of Europe plough, each\r\ncarrying a soldier upon his back. The brick-mason builds, but staggers\r\nup the ladder with a heavier load than bricks,--the soldier upon his\r\nback. The symbols of nations are still the lion, the eagle and the wolf.\r\nSome political leaders even yet talk about the necessity of an\r\noccasional war to put boys upon their mettle, as if invention, the\r\nbuilding of railways, the founding of cities, the fighting of economic\r\nand social wrongs would not put a man upon his mettle! To put a German\r\non one side of a fence and a Frenchman on the other, and have one\r\npeasant empty his shotgun into the bowels of the other is about as noble\r\nas going out into a yard and shooting a Jersey cow. The best way to\r\nprotect a nation is to build boys into men, through the processes of\r\nproductive industry. Machine gun and dreadnought will soon be as\r\nobsolete in the presence of arbitration and the court at the Hague as an\r\nox-cart is obsolete in the presence of a Pullman palace car.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips once said that Lord Bacon had a right to lay his hand\r\non the steam engine and say to Watt: \"This engine is mine; I gave you\r\nthe method.\" So Charles Sumner, after sixty-five years, has a right to\r\nstand yonder at the entrance of the Parliament House of Peace, now being\r\ncompleted in the capital of Holland, and say: \"I laid the foundation\r\nstones of this structure and started a war against war.\" This oration\r\nof Sumner's on \"The True Grandeur of Nations\" made him a most unpopular\r\nfigure at home, but Europe soon called for his speech. It was translated\r\ninto many languages, two hundred and fifty-thousand copies were\r\npublished and sold, and for the time Sumner was the most talked of man\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nNow the one man who was not on the defensive, who was not content to\r\nmerely stay the forward progress of slavery, but insisted on driving it\r\nback into the Gulf and ultimately into the sea, to be drowned forever,\r\nwas Charles Sumner, with his \"Carthago est delenda.\" His favourite\r\nphrase was \"freedom is national, slavery is sectional.\" Burke himself,\r\ndepicting the sufferings of India, scarcely surpassed Sumner's speech on\r\nthe devastation of Kansas by outlaws and guerrillas. Commenting upon the\r\nfact that a company of armed slave owners had crossed the borders at\r\nnight, and destroyed the homes of a group of Northern settlers, Sumner\r\nsaid: \"Border incursions, which in barbarous lands fretted and harried\r\nan exposed people, are here renewed, with this peculiarity, that our\r\nborder robbers do not simply levy blackmail and drive off a few cattle,\r\nthey do not seize a few persons and sweep them away into captivity, like\r\nthe African slave-traders whom we brand as tyrants, but they commit a\r\nsuccession of deeds in which border sorrows and African wrongs are\r\nrevived together on American soil, while the whole territory is\r\nenslaved. I do not dwell on the anxieties of families exposed to sudden\r\nassault, and lying down to rest with the alarms of war ringing in the\r\nears, not knowing that another day may be spared them. Throughout this\r\nbitter winter, with the thermometer thirty degrees below zero, the\r\ncitizens of Lawrence have slept under arms, with sentinels pacing. In\r\nvain do we condemn the cruelties of another age--the refinement of\r\ntorture, the rack and thumbscrew of the Inquisition; for kindred\r\noutrages disgrace these borders. Murder stalks, assassination skulks in\r\nthe tall grass; where a candidate for the Legislature was gashed with\r\nknives and hatchets, and after weltering in blood on the snow-clad\r\nearth, trundled along with gaping wounds to fall dead before the face of\r\nhis wife.\"\r\n\r\nWith speeches like these, Sumner attacked slavery. The edge of his\r\nargument was keen, but his blows had also the power of sledgehammers.\r\nThe Southern leaders were in a frenzy of anger. Harriet Martineau said\r\nof the situation that from 1830 to 1850, by general agreement, men in\r\nCongress referred to slavery under their breath, believing that only by\r\nsilence could the Union be preserved. Now came a man who believed that\r\nsilence was criminal, who would not be bullied, and would be heard, who\r\nbelieved in the Golden Rule, insisted on the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and who, in the name of freedom that was national, wished\r\nto destroy the Fugitive Slave Law and bring about the immediate and\r\nunconditional emancipation of all slaves on the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen two opposing gases come together, an explosion is inevitable. One\r\nday in 1856, after the adjournment of the Senate, a Southern member of\r\nCongress entered the Chamber, and finding Sumner seated, with his legs\r\nunder an iron desk screwed to the floor, and, therefore, helpless for\r\ndefense, with a heavy walking-stick the assailant beat the powerless man\r\ninto insensibility, two of his friends protecting him from those who\r\nwould interfere in his murderous assault. Having lost enough blood to\r\nsoak through the carpet and stain the very floor, unconscious, and\r\nhovering between life and death, Sumner was carried to a sofa, thence to\r\nhis hotel. From that time on the scholar endured a living death. He was\r\ncarried to Paris, where Dr. Brown-Sequard tried \"the fire cure\" upon the\r\nspine. But for years his desk was vacant. Massachusetts insisted that\r\nthe empty seat should proclaim to the world her abhorrence of the\r\nbarbarism that, unequal to intellectual debate, betakes itself to clubs\r\nand murder. Later on Sumner did return to his seat, but he was broken in\r\nhealth, and to the end was tortured with pain. Nevertheless, despite all\r\nthe physical distresses, he remained the Puritan in politics, adhering\r\ninflexibly to his old ideals of liberty. The great lesson of Sumner's\r\nlife is the importance of fidelity to conviction and singleness of\r\npurpose. All Sumner's speeches in Congress, all his lectures on the\r\nplatform, his appeals to the people of the North during the years when\r\nhe travelled incessantly, addressing great crowds all over the land, had\r\na single theme, \"Liberty is national, Slavery is sectional; Liberty must\r\nbe established, Slavery must be destroyed.\" He had his faults and\r\nlimitations, but men without faults are generally men without force.\r\nLimitations are like banks to a river; they increase the strength of the\r\ncurrent for a mill wheel. Sumner's concentration made his enemies call\r\nhim a narrow man and a fanatic. But Paul was narrow when he said, \"This\r\none thing I do.\" Luther was narrow when he nailed his theses to the door\r\nof the church in Wittenberg. Garrison was narrow and a fanatic when he\r\nsaid, \"I will not equivocate, I will not retreat a single inch, and I\r\nwill be heard.\" Rushing between the cliffs of its banks, the Rhine has\r\npower through confinement; spreading out over the plains of North\r\nGermany, the Rhine becomes a mere marsh, laden with miasm, blown to and\r\nfro with the winds.\r\n\r\nThe tallow candle is small, while the summer lightning flashes across\r\nthe midnight sky. But for the purpose of studying a guide book in the\r\ndark, one lucifer match is worth a sky full of lightning.\r\n\r\nSumner had the courage of his convictions; he was brave as a lion.\r\nHaving no physical fear, he was devoid also of moral fear. He had the\r\nforesight of far-off things, and could look beyond to-day's defeat to\r\nthe coming victory for his cause. He had many bitter enemies. His\r\nintolerance and intellectual arrogance offended men. When a friend said\r\nto President Grant, \"Sumner is a skeptic; I fear he does not believe in\r\nthe Bible,\" Grant's instant retort was, \"Certainly he does not; he did\r\nnot write it.\"\r\n\r\nBut we can forgive much to a man who sacrificed much, and endured the\r\nmurderous cross of cruelty, obloquy and shame. A lonely and\r\ncompanionless man, at the end, he trod the wine-press of sorrow in\r\nsolitude and isolation. He had no woman's love to heal his wounded\r\nspirit. His one support was the cause he loved. To this cause he clung\r\nwith a tenacity that was as sublime as it was pathetic. The last time he\r\nopened his eyes it was to repeat unconsciously the dearest thoughts of\r\nhis life, \"All humanity is my country.\" \"Take care of my civil rights\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\nWhen long time has passed, many other great names will pass out of view\r\nlike tapers that have burned down to the socket. But the name and memory\r\nof this Puritan will probably survive, as the highest type of the\r\nscholar toiling in the heroic age of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHORACE GREELEY: THE APPEAL TO THE COMMON PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the work of the statesmen and jurists, the agitators and orators,\r\nmust now be added the contribution of the editors. A loaf of bread\r\nrepresents many elements united in a single body. The sun lends heat,\r\nthe clouds lend rain, the soil its chemical elements, the air its rich\r\ndust, and the result is the wheaten loaf. Not otherwise is it with the\r\nmoral and political treasure named the Union and the Emancipation of\r\nslaves. The soldier boys at the front stayed the advancing tide of\r\nrebellion, and flung back from Pennsylvania waves all tipped with fire.\r\nWith not less heroism farmer boys at home toiled in the fields to feed\r\nand support the boys in blue. Physicians in the hospitals, nurses at the\r\nfront, lived also and died, caring for crippled heroes. Mothers and\r\ndaughters, sisters, sweethearts and wives wrought innumerable garments\r\nand hospital supplies, while from full hearts giving inspiration or\r\ncourageously bearing the miseries of bereavement. Orators went forth to\r\nincite, ministers brought divine sanctions to inspire men towards\r\npatriotism and self-sacrifice. Statesmen supported the leaders by war\r\nmeasures, manufacturers and bankers stood behind the government. But to\r\nall these workers must be added the work of the correspondents at the\r\nfront, with the editors who consecrated the press to liberty.\r\n\r\nThe power and wealth of the newspaper of to-day is explained, in no\r\nsmall measure, by the battles of the Civil War, that kindled the\r\ninterest of millions who had never before read the daily newspaper, but\r\nwho became after the first battle students of God's book of daily\r\nevents. During those terrible days men slept in dread and wakened in\r\nfear as to what might have happened on the Potomac or the Mississippi.\r\nOut of these tumultuous conditions the Sunday newspaper was born. Before\r\nthe battle of Bull Run people of New York and Chicago frowned upon the\r\nSunday newspaper, just as the people of London and Edinburgh to-day will\r\nhave none of it. But when there were a million men in arms and the whole\r\nland trembled with the thunder of cannon and the stroke of battle,\r\nanxious parents, fearful wives, knowing that the conflict was on, when\r\nSaturday's sun set felt that they could not wait till Monday morning for\r\nnews from the front.\r\n\r\nBut if the war did much for the press, newspaper men did much for\r\nliberty. To supply the people of the country with news from the field, a\r\nveritable army of war correspondents was organized, a telegraphic\r\nservice was organized and built up, plans were laid that developed into\r\nthe Associated Press. This telegraphic service became a vast and shining\r\nweb lying all over this land, with wires that trembled by night and day,\r\nflashing out now despair, and now hope, to innumerable hearts. Liberty\r\nowes a great debt to the press, for it assembled all the people in one\r\nvast speaking chamber, and told them how events were going with the\r\nslave and the Union.\r\n\r\nIf we are to appreciate fully the place of the press during the\r\nanti-slavery epoch, we must recall the conditions of American life in\r\nthe olden time. When the colonies revolted and published their\r\nDeclaration there were in the United States only forty-three newspapers,\r\nmost of them weeklies. There were fourteen papers in New England, four\r\nin New York State, two in Virginia, two in Carolina and nine in\r\nPennsylvania. The entire forty-three papers, however, held less printed\r\nmatter than any ten pages of our morning journals. The papers of that\r\ntime contained no editorials, and were strictly purveyors of the gossip\r\nand news of the week, with rude advertisements--now a cut of a horse\r\nthat had strayed, an apprentice that had escaped, a slave that had run\r\naway, enlivened, indeed, by frantic and pathetic appeals for the\r\nsubscribers to pay up their dues. There were no public libraries, no\r\nreading rooms, no inns where men could go on winter evenings and read\r\nthe papers.\r\n\r\nThat which starved the newspaper was the lack of facilities for\r\ndistribution. It cost twenty-five cents to send a letter. Most of the\r\ncorrespondents were widely separated lovers. Romeo, knowing that Juliet\r\nwould not be able to pay twenty-five cents for his weekly effusion,\r\nlearned the use of the cypher, and by means of a large circle on the\r\noutside of the letter and a pink spot within it succeeded in conveying\r\ncertain mystic symbols of osculation, that told the story of undying\r\nfidelity without paying the postman for the letter that was left in his\r\nhands. The old postman who jogged along between Philadelphia and New\r\nYork spent three days on the trip, and put in his time knitting\r\nstockings. John Adams tells us that it took him six days on the coach\r\nfrom Boston to New York, and that he rose every morning long before day,\r\ntook his seat in the cold, dark coach, and listened to the creaking of\r\nthe wheels on the snow until two hours after dark until late Saturday\r\nnight, cold and exhausted, he entered the little inn near Castle Garden.\r\nFor these reasons no newspaper had any circulation beyond its own\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe first railroads that helped distribute the newspapers began to be\r\nbuilt about 1836, and the first ship to carry our newspapers to England\r\nsailed in 1838. The first telegraphic message was sent from Washington\r\nto Baltimore in 1844. The first cablegram in the interest of the press\r\nwas sent in 1858. Meanwhile the people were isolated, starved, being\r\nfully conscious that they were like peasants shut in between mountain\r\nwalls, while they longed to be citizens of the universe. A single\r\nillustration from history will explain the isolation of communities at\r\nthat time:--the news that Jackson had been elected President in early\r\nNovember did not reach his own State of Tennessee until after New Year's\r\nDay!\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley entered the scene at a great crisis for the people, and\r\nwas raised up to fill a national need. God had prepared the soldiers to\r\nfight for the people, the orators to speak to the people, the physicians\r\nto heal the people, the educators to instruct the people. He had raised\r\nup the statesmen to make the laws, but the world waited for men to cause\r\nknowledge to run up and down the land. The common people found a friend\r\nin Horace Greeley. He was born in 1811, in Amherst, Massachusetts, near\r\nthe very cabin in which his forefathers had settled. God gave him a\r\nhungry mind, which literally consumed facts of nature and life. Not John\r\nStuart Mill himself was more precocious than Horace Greeley. He was\r\nreading without difficulty at three years of age, and read any ordinary\r\nbook at five. There never was an hour when he was not the best scholar\r\nin the little log schoolhouse, where he suffered the long winter\r\nthrough, scorched if he was on the inside circle next to the fire, or\r\nfreezing if he was on the outer rim.\r\n\r\nReading was the boy's master passion. Like the locust, he consumed every\r\ndry twig and green branch of knowledge. Before he was ten years of age\r\nhe believed he had read every book that could be borrowed within a\r\nradius of six miles. He read the Bible through, every word, when he was\r\nfive years old; at eleven he had read Shakespeare and Byron. Spelling\r\nwas at once a taste and an acquisition. The people of his neighbourhood\r\nput the child up against other crack spellers in the school districts.\r\nIt is said that in the old evening spelling-bees, his school-teacher,\r\nwho had him in charge, had to wake the child up when his turn came\r\naround to spell. The trustees of Bedford Academy passed a resolution\r\npermitting Horace Greeley, although outside of the district, to enter\r\ntheir school, while a few teachers raised a purse, and made an offer to\r\nhis father to send the boy to Phillips Exeter Academy. But pride\r\nprevented. Horace Greeley's childhood fell on evil days. Men were\r\nmiserably poor. It was one long warfare with hunger and cold. The\r\nravages of disease among children were really the result of insufficient\r\nfood in those poverty-stricken times. Although the mortgage on the farm\r\nwas a mere bagatelle, the father lost the homestead, and became a hired\r\nman on fifty cents a day, on which amount he had to feed and clothe his\r\nfamily. This boy worked by day and studied by night. History and\r\npolitics, poetry and science, formed the staples of his reading and\r\nreflection. For two years he pleaded with his father to apprentice him\r\nto a printer; the day that the printer refused the boy and showed the\r\npoor farmer and his son the door, brought black gloom to his heart, for\r\nwhen the door of the printing office closed before him, the gates of\r\nparadise seemed shut forever.\r\n\r\nTrained in the school of experience, and a graduate of the university of\r\nhard-knocks, at twenty years of age the boy determined to seek his\r\nfortune in New York. There are few scenes more pathetic than the\r\nspectacle of this friendless boy starting to walk from Erie, Pa., to\r\nthis metropolis, then a city of only two hundred thousand people. He had\r\na tow head, a bent form, a singular dress, and carried his entire\r\nbelongings in a little bundle, supported by a walking stick thrown over\r\nhis shoulder. Partly on foot, partly on the wagon of some farmer, who\r\ngave the traveller a lift, partly on the canal boats, Horace Greeley\r\nmade his way until, after many days, in August, 1831, he landed at the\r\nfoot of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nNot Benjamin Franklin, landing on the wharves of Philadelphia, and\r\nbuying a fresh roll on which he breakfasted while he went about looking\r\nfor work, is so fascinating a figure as this simple-hearted, unworldly,\r\nartless, unsophisticated youth, with the step of a clodhopper and the\r\nface of an angel. Counting his coin, the boy found he had ten dollars\r\nleft, and straightway took lodgings on West Street, for which he\r\npromised to pay two dollars and a half a week. He soon found a job and\r\nbegan to set type on an edition of the New Testament, with marginal\r\nnotes in Greek and Latin. In two years he had his own printing office,\r\nand in 1834 the youth found his place as the editor of the _New Yorker_,\r\na weekly that first of all took stories and the name of Charles Dickens\r\nto the people of New York. He soon carried the newspaper up to nine\r\nthousand subscribers, and a gross income of $25,000. Genius makes its\r\nown way. The world is always looking for unique ability. Horace Greeley\r\nhad the art of putting things. He could make a statement that would go\r\nto the intellect like an arrow to the bull's-eye. There is always\r\nplenty of room for the man who has a gift and can do a thing better than\r\nany one else.\r\n\r\nBut the panic of 1837 bankrupted Greeley, who knew nothing about the\r\nbusiness end of his enterprise. He had 9,000 subscribers, but none of\r\nthem would pay their bills, and the more his paper grew the worse off he\r\nwas. One day he struck from the roll the names of 2,500 subscribers. A\r\nlittle later he offered to give the entire establishment to a friend,\r\nand pay him $2,000 for taking it off his hands, agreeing to work out by\r\ntypesetting the large debt. Then came an overture from Thurlow Weed and\r\nBenedict, and Greeley founded the _Log Cabin_, a campaign paper\r\nadvocating the election of General Harrison as president, and sent out\r\nthe slogan \"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too.\" Politics was his passion and\r\ndelight. An ardent Whig, he loved Henry Clay as an enthusiast, and\r\nworshipped him like a disciple. The death of Harrison in 1841,\r\ntherefore, brought another crisis into Greeley's life. Then he founded\r\nthe _New York Tribune_. In later years Horace Greeley used to say that\r\nthe first half of his life was preparatory to founding the _Tribune_,\r\nand the other half to building up the newspaper that was his pride.\r\n\r\nOn April 3, 1841, the _Log Cabin_ contained an announcement of the\r\nappearance of \"a morning journal of politics, literature and general\r\nintelligence.\" It was to be sold for one penny, was to be free from all\r\nimmoral reports, to be accurate in its statements, impartial in its\r\njudgments, unbiassed and unfettered in its opinions. The _New Yorker_\r\nand the _Log Cabin_ were merged in the new journal. The expenses for the\r\nfirst week of the _Tribune's_ existence were $525, and its income $92.\r\nGreeley was thirty years old, full of health and vigour, pluck and\r\ndetermination. He never knew when he was defeated, and when events\r\nknocked him down, he quietly got up again. In seven weeks the _Tribune_\r\nhad a circulation of 11,000. Fertile in resources, full of plans to\r\nadvertise his journal, he gained 20,000 during a single political\r\ncampaign. Later he sent carrier pigeons to Halifax to bring home special\r\nnews. When Daniel Webster was to make an important speech in Albany, he\r\nsent a case of type up by the night boat, and when the Albany boat\r\nreached New York the report of the speech was all ready to be locked up\r\nfor the press. When the heart sings, the hand works easily. Work for the\r\n_Tribune_ was literally food and medicine for Greeley. His daily stint\r\nwas three or four columns, besides his correspondence, lectures and\r\naddresses. For twenty years he had no vacation and no rest. His one\r\nideal was to make the _Tribune_ an accurate and trustworthy guide for\r\nthe political thinking of the common people.\r\n\r\nWhat literature was to Burke, what patriotism was to Webster, what all\r\nmankind was to Paul, that politics and political writing were to Horace\r\nGreeley. Dr. Bacon once said of a secretary of the State Association of\r\nConnecticut that he was \"possessed of a statistical devil.\" And Horace\r\nGreeley's _Tribune Almanac_ became so great a power that an envious\r\ncompetitor once said that Horace Greeley was possessed of a political\r\ndevil, who helped him in his statistics on Protection. At last the\r\n_Tribune_ became a national organ, an acknowledged power. Horace Greeley\r\nbegan to make history, and in 1860 prevented Seward's nomination for the\r\npresidency. It was Greeley's personal preference for Governor Bates of\r\nMissouri that made possible the nomination of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAs a reformer, Greeley was an extremist in politics. Whatever he wanted,\r\nhe wanted on the moment, and had no patience in waiting. He was as\r\nuncompromising as Garrison, as insistent as Wendell Phillips, and as\r\nbitter in his criticism of Lincoln for postponing emancipation as\r\nTheodore Parker himself could have been. When the South seceded Greeley\r\nsaid that we must \"let the erring sisters go.\" He thought that the North\r\ncould do without the South quite as well as the South could do without\r\nthe North; that is no true marriage that binds husband and wife together\r\nwith chains when love has fled away. He urged that if any six States\r\nwould send their representatives to Washington and say: \"We wish to\r\nwithdraw from the Union,\" the North had better let those States depart.\r\nIt was not that Greeley felt it was best to dissolve the Union, but that\r\nhe loathed the idea of compelling States by force to remain in it.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he carried the head-lines \"On to Richmond\" and roused\r\nthe North into such a frenzy of feeling that he goaded the President,\r\nthe Cabinet and General Winfield Scott into action before they were\r\nready. Scott was at the head of the army. He was a Virginian, and loved\r\nthe Old Dominion State with every drop of blood in his veins. The great\r\nmen of the South on their knees begged Scott to join the South and lead\r\nthe host of rebellion. Scott answered that he had sworn a solemn oath to\r\ndefend the Constitution and the country, and made himself an outcast\r\nthat he might be true to God and the Union. But the cry \"On to Richmond\"\r\nbecame the cry of an unreasoning multitude of editors and their readers.\r\nAll unprepared, the advance was ordered and Bull Run was the result.\r\nGreeley, being the leading editor of the land, was made the\r\nscapegoat--the target of universal criticism. The barbed arrows found\r\nhis brain, and becoming excited, sleepless and overwrought, Greeley went\r\ninto an attack of brain fever, from which he recovered only after long\r\ntime, to register a vow that he would never again discuss the management\r\nof the army. Then came his editorials urging emancipation, illustrated\r\nby \"The prayer of twenty millions,\" and Lincoln's wonderful reply,\r\nwritten to Greeley, \"in deference to an old friend whose heart I have\r\nalways found to be right.\" It is honour enough for any editor to have\r\ncalled out Lincoln's letter (August 22, 1862), a letter that placed the\r\nPresident in the first rank as a master of epigrammatic speech, and put\r\nin a nutshell the whole position of the government in relation to the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nGreeley was wrong again in 1864, when he met certain representatives of\r\nthe South at Niagara Falls and suggested a plan of adjustment for the\r\nending of the war. These so-called peace commissioners, without doubt,\r\nused Greeley as a convenient tool, and exhibited him as Don Quixote,\r\nriding forth upon a windmill enterprise. But Greeley had the courage of\r\nhis opinions; threats could not cow him nor blows terrify him, nor scorn\r\nand hate drive him from a position which he had taken upon grounds of\r\nconscience and sound reasoning.\r\n\r\nDuring the draft riots, in 1863, the mob attacked the _Tribune_,\r\nsmashing the windows and doors, and it seemed a miracle that Greeley was\r\nnot killed. When his friends rescued him the great editor seemed quite\r\nunwilling to be forced into a place of safety. \"Well, it doesn't matter;\r\nI have done my work; I may as well be killed by the mob as die in my\r\nbed; between now and the next time is only a little while.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1867, Greeley signed the bail bond for Jefferson Davis,\r\nex-president of the Confederacy. Burning with anger his friends in the\r\nUnion League Club of New York called a meeting to expel him. He returned\r\na defiant answer: \"Gentlemen, I shall not attend your meeting; I have an\r\nengagement out of town and I shall keep it. I do not recognize you as\r\ncapable of judging me. You evidently regard me as a weak sentimentalist,\r\nmisled by a maudlin philosophy. I arraign you as narrow-minded\r\nblockheads, who would like to be useful to a great and good cause but\r\ndon't know how. Your attempt to base a great and enduring party on the\r\nhate and wrath engendered by a bloody civil war is as though you should\r\nplant a colony on an iceberg which had somehow drifted into a tropical\r\nocean. I tell you here that out of a life earnestly devoted to the good\r\nof human kind, your children will select my going to Richmond and\r\nsigning that bail bond as the wisest act of my life, and will feel that\r\nit did more for freedom and humanity than all of you were competent to\r\ndo though you lived to the age of Methuselah. Understand, once for all,\r\nthat I dare you and defy you. So long as any man was seeking to\r\noverthrow our government he was my enemy; from the hour when he laid\r\ndown his arms he was my formerly erring countryman.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1872, Greeley became the Republican who was a candidate of the\r\nDemocratic party for the presidency, and was defeated by Grant.\r\nDoubtless he was actuated by the highest sense of duty. He took the\r\nstump and spoke in every great city in the North and South, without\r\nswerving a hair's breadth in his pacific attitude towards the South, or\r\nin his championship of the coloured race. His great work, \"The American\r\nConflict,\" on which he spent ten hours a day for many, many months, had\r\nmade Greeley a master of all the facts bearing upon the reconciliation\r\nof the North and South. He showed almost superhuman endurance during\r\nthat intense campaign. But Grant had captured the imagination of the\r\npeople. The old soldiers voted as one solid band, the Republican party\r\nwas looked upon as the saviour of the nation, and the people doubted Mr.\r\nGreeley's fitness for the presidency in a national crisis. He was\r\ndefeated in November, and went home to watch over his wife during her\r\nillness and death. Just before she died, he wrote a friend saying: \"I am\r\na broken old man; I have not slept one hour in twenty-four; if she\r\nlasts, poor soul, another week, I shall go before her.\" Sleeplessness\r\nbrought on brain fever, his old enemy, and on November 29th, the\r\nworn-out editor fell on sleep.\r\n\r\nHis fellow countrymen wakened to realize that the great tribune of the\r\npeople had left the country poor. His own city rose as one man, in mood\r\nof profound grief and affectionate admiration and sympathy. His body lay\r\nin state in our city hall the long day through. The poor poured by in\r\nunending column, to pay their last tribute to a man who had never\r\nbetrayed the people. The funeral services were attended by the president\r\nand vice-president of the United States, the president-elect, and\r\nnumerous officials and citizens of distinction. Mr. Beecher made one\r\naddress and then Greeley's pastor, Dr. Chapin, spoke. Men forgot the\r\nwreck of his political fortunes and the tragedy of his later career. He\r\nexpressed the ambition of his life in the wish \"that the stone which\r\ncovers my ashes may bear to future eyes the still intelligible\r\ninscription: 'Founder of the New York Tribune.'\"\r\n\r\nA Universalist in his religious faith, Horace Greeley believed that\r\nright was stronger than wrong, good more powerful than evil, and that\r\nthere will be in eternal ages no endless perdition for the evil ones of\r\nearth, but that God and all the resources of His power and love will\r\nhere or there compel every knee to bow and every will surrender to the\r\nwill divine. He earned the right to say at the end of his noble career,\r\n\"I have been spared to see the end of giant wrongs that I once deemed\r\ninvincible in this country, and to note the silent upspringing and\r\ngrowth of principles and influences which I hail as destined to root out\r\nsome of the most flagrant and pervading influences that remain. So,\r\nlooking calmly, yet humbly, for that close of my mortal career which\r\ncannot be far distant, I reverently thank God for the blessings\r\nvouchsafed me in the past; and with an awe that is not fear, and a\r\nconsciousness of demerit which does not exclude hope, await the opening\r\nbefore my steps of the gates of the Eternal World.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHARRIET BEECHER STOWE; JOHN BROWN: THE CONFLICT PRECIPITATED\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 1850, as the result of the long agitation of the editors and\r\norators, preachers and poets, the people of this country entered upon a\r\nheated mood, when excitement dwelt like fire in the intellect and\r\nconscience. For thinking men, it was becoming clear that civil war was\r\ninevitable, and that commercial relations between North and South would\r\nsoon be broken off. But the North had goods to sell, and the South had\r\nmoney with which to buy; so the word was passed that every one must keep\r\nsilence about slavery, lest discussion bring on a financial panic. It\r\nwas the era of imprisoned moral sense. In the ocean, some waves are\r\ntidal waves, and on land sometimes the soil is heaved by an earthquake;\r\nat this time God began to heave the conscience of the people as the full\r\nmoon heaves the sea. And although we now see that God was behind the\r\nmovement, foolish men then tried to stay these moral forces. Northern\r\nmerchants and politicians cried, \"Peace!\" and the Southern successors of\r\nCalhoun lifted the old club, the threat of secession; but the agitation\r\nwent on all over the North. Toombs, the Southern senator, tried sheer\r\nbombast, and said he would call the roll of his slaves at the foot of\r\nBunker Hill monument. Timid men in the North began to cry: \"Conciliate,\r\nconciliate!\" But there can be warfare, and only warfare between darkness\r\nand light, between sickness and health, between wrong and right. At\r\nlength Phillips and Greeley took up the cry: \"Let the South go!\" But the\r\nanswer was: \"Shall a strong man who has hold of a mad dog let the beast\r\ngo into a crowd of little children?\" Compromise did something for a\r\ntime, as a safety valve, relieving men's pent-up feelings. But God had\r\nHis own counsels. Plainly, \"every drop of blood shed by the lash was to\r\nbe paid for by blood shed by the sword,\" for \"the judgments of God are\r\ntrue and righteous altogether.\"\r\n\r\nDuring those heated days of 1850, when the men of light and leading\r\nbegan to see their way clearly, the masses were still timid, hesitant\r\nand vacillating in their judgments on slavery. Scholars and thinking men\r\nhad already been reached by poets, authors and editors, while the\r\npreachers and lecturers had driven their message home to the conviction\r\nof the ruling classes. Later on was to come the revival of 1857 that\r\nshould stir the conscience, but preparatory to that movement it was\r\nnecessary to inform the intellect and rouse the affections of the\r\nmillions. Then it was that God raised up an author to touch the heart of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nWonderful the power of the novel in social reform! The novels of \"Oliver\r\nTwist,\" and \"Dombey and Son,\" were what roused the English people to a\r\nrealization of the woes and wrongs of chimney sweeps, of children in the\r\nfactories and mines of Great Britain. It was a novel, \"All Sorts and\r\nConditions of Men,\" that later built People's Palace in the Whitechapel\r\ndistrict of London. And it was a novel, named \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" that\r\ncreated the atmosphere of sympathy in which the flowers of\r\nself-sacrifice and heroism unfolded.\r\n\r\nThe authoress was the daughter of Lyman Beecher, who had seven sons and\r\nfour daughters, each one of whom was either a preacher or reformer in\r\nsome field. His daughter, Harriet, married Prof. Calvin E. Stowe, of\r\nLane Seminary in Cincinnati, where, on the border between the free soil\r\nof Ohio and the slave soil of Kentucky, people were in a state of\r\nconstant excitement and upheaval. The old Blue Grass State exhibited\r\nslavery in its very best condition and also in its worst form. The\r\nharrowing tales and incidents that were afterwards worked up into\r\nliterary form by the gifted authoress were all matters of observation,\r\nconversation and experience. One of the earliest incidents of the\r\nStowes' life in Cincinnati was an experience of Professor Stowe with one\r\nof the Beecher boys. While travelling in Kentucky, the two young men\r\nwitnessed the flight of a negro woman, who was running away with her\r\nlittle child, whom they helped across the Ohio River, to be sent on by\r\nthe Underground Railway to Oberlin, on the shore of Lake Erie. And the\r\nsimilar incident, Eliza's flight across the ice, her son Charles[1]\r\nwrites in his recent story of her life, \"was an actual occurrence. She\r\nhad known and had often talked with the very man who helped Eliza up the\r\nbank of the river.\"\r\n\r\nLater during their Cincinnati residence, Mrs. Stowe conducted a small\r\nprivate school and made a practice of allowing a few coloured children\r\nto attend it. One evening the mother of one of these coloured children\r\ncame to the Stowes' house in a frenzy of terror, saying that her little\r\ngirl had been seized and carried to the river, to be sold as a slave in\r\nKentucky. Mrs. Stowe raised the money to ransom the beautiful child.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that the Kentucky editor, Bailey, moved across\r\nthe river and began to publish a paper in Cincinnati. One night the\r\neditor knocked at the door of the Stowe home, seeking refuge from a mob\r\nthat had smashed in his doors and windows, looted his printing-office,\r\nand flung his type into the river.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a Kentuckian named Van Zandt freed his slaves and\r\ncarried them across the river into Ohio. His old friends counted him a\r\ntraitor, and charges were trumped up that he had used his new home in\r\nOhio as an underground station for the receiving of runaway slaves.\r\nProfessor Stowe was asked to assist in Van Zandt's defense. When other\r\nlawyers were afraid of the mob spirit, a young attorney named Salmon P.\r\nChase volunteered his services without pay. As the courts were then\r\nentirely under the influence of the Fugitive Slave law, young Chase lost\r\nhis case; but that no dramatic note might be wanting, this young\r\nattorney later became chief justice of the United States Supreme Court\r\nand wrote a decision that reversed the former action. All these and many\r\nother facts and events went into Mrs. Stowe's mind as raw silk, and came\r\nout tapestry and brocade. The fuel of events fed the flames of\r\nenthusiasm. It was a great age, when men had to speak. The time was\r\nripe, the soil was ready, God gave the good seed of liberty, and the\r\nsower went forth to sow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stowe tells us how she came to write the last chapter of the book,\r\nthe death of \"Uncle Tom.\" She had a coloured woman in her family whose\r\nhusband was a slave, living in Kentucky. This black man had invented a\r\nsimple tool, was a good salesman, and was permitted to travel from town\r\nto town, and even to cross the river into the Ohio, under no bond save\r\nhis solemn pledge to his master not to run away. Mrs. Stowe wrote the\r\nletters for her servant, to this black man in Covington, Ky. One day,\r\nwhile visiting his wife, in the Stowe home, he said that he would rather\r\ncut off his right hand than break the word he had given to his master.\r\nWhat white man could boast a more delicate sense of truth? How keen and\r\ndelicate the conscience! What weight of manhood in a slave! What\r\nreserves of morality! What latent heroism! The slave's story captured\r\nthe imagination of the authoress, and kindled her mind into a creative\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nOut of the incident Mrs. Stowe evolved the character of \"Uncle Tom.\" One\r\nSunday morning, as she sat at the communion table, the picture of Tom's\r\ndeath rose and passed before her mind. \"At the same time,\" writes her\r\nson, \"the words of Jesus were sounding in her ears: 'Inasmuch as ye have\r\ndone it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto\r\nMe.' It seemed as if the crucified but now risen and glorified Christ\r\nwere speaking to her through the poor black man, cut and bleeding under\r\nthe blows of the slave whip.\" Long afterwards some one asked Mrs. Stowe\r\nhow she came to write the death of Uncle Tom, and she answered that she\r\ndid not write it, that God gave it to her in a vision, that she saw the\r\noverseer flog him to death, and heard his dying words, and merely wrote\r\ndown the vision as she saw it. At the time, she had no idea of writing\r\nmore: it was a year later when she began the tale of which this incident\r\nbecame the crisis.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two years the story ran in the _National Era_, published in\r\nWashington. The book was completed on March 20, 1852, and in spite of\r\nMrs. Stowe's despondency and apprehension of failure, it sold 3,000\r\ncopies the first day, 10,000 in a week, and 300,000 in a year. Save\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" alone, perhaps no book ever had a wider\r\ncirculation, the Bible, of course, and \"The Imitation of Christ,\" by à\r\nKempis, always excepted. \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" was translated into German,\r\nFrench, Italian and Spanish, and later appeared in almost every known\r\nlanguage. Written for the people at large, the book struck a chord of\r\nuniversal human nature, and aroused the learned as well as the simple.\r\nSoon letters began to pour in from the most distinguished men in foreign\r\ncountries. Charles Dickens wrote that he had read \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\"\r\nwith the deepest interest and sympathy. Lord Carlisle sent a message of\r\n\"deep and solemn thanks to Almighty God, who has enabled you to write\r\nthis book.\" Charles Kingsley expressed the judgment that the story would\r\ntake away the reproach of slavery from the great and growing nation. Men\r\nlike Shaftesbury, Arthur Helps, women like George Sand and Frederika\r\nBremer added their tribute of praise. Eighteen different publishing\r\nhouses in England were issuing the book at one time, and a million and a\r\nhalf copies were sold in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nEven Heinrich Heine, the poet, the cynic, who carried more power of\r\nsarcasm and irony than any man of his generation, was so moved by the\r\nbook that he seems to have returned to the reading of the Bible, and to\r\nChrist the Consoler, in the hour when night and death were falling.\r\n\"Astonishing! That after I have whirled about all my life, over all the\r\ndance floors of philosophy, and yielded myself to all the orgies of the\r\nintellect, and paid my addresses to all possible systems, without\r\nsatisfaction, like Messalina after a licentious night, I now find myself\r\non the same standpoint where poor Uncle Tom stands--on that of the\r\nBible. I kneel down by my black brother in the same prayer. What a\r\nhumiliation! With all my sense I have come no farther than the poor\r\nignorant negro who has just learned to spell. Poor Tom indeed seems to\r\nhave seen deeper things in the holy book than I, but I, who used to make\r\ncitations from Homer, now begin to quote the Bible as Uncle Tom does!\"\r\nPraise can go no farther than this, that \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" has shown\r\nhow the love of God can support a slave, under the lash, in the hour\r\nwhen he is flogged to death, and fill his heart with pity while he\r\ncries, \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!\" It was\r\nthis that conquered the intellect of the scholar, and broke his heart,\r\nand flooded his eyes with tears.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking testimony to the influence of \"Uncle Tom's\r\nCabin\" grew out of a suggestion of Lord Shaftesbury's that the women of\r\nEngland and Europe send their signatures to a testimonial to be\r\npresented to Mrs. Stowe, for, when this testimonial came in, it filled\r\ntwenty-six thick folio volumes, solidly bound in morocco, and it held\r\nthe names of 562,448 women, representing every rank, from the throne of\r\nEngland to the wives of the humblest artisans in Wales or the peasants\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\nThe message of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" is so simple that he who runs may\r\nread. It was not written for literary critics, for scholars or for\r\ncollege graduates. George Eliot wrote her \"Romola\" with the historian\r\nand the philosopher and the editor of reviews ever in mind. Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe wrote \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" for farmers, factory men,\r\nmerchants and clerks, the miscellaneous mass that make up the millions,\r\nto rouse them to the wrongs of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn it she tried to prove two things. First, that slavery, as a system,\r\nreacted upon the loftiest natures, distorting and injuring them. Witness\r\nthe Kentucky gentleman, Mr. Shelby. His wife was a patrician, the very\r\nembodiment of courtesy and good-will, affection and sympathy. Her\r\nhusband was a man of honour, a representative of the bluest blood of the\r\nold Lexington families, with a heart so gentle that the sight of a young\r\nbird that had fallen out of the nest in the tree moved him to tears;\r\nbut, little by little, pressed by his necessities and hardened by the\r\nspectacle of slaves bought and slaves sold, he himself sells the woman\r\nwho has been a nurse to his children, and Uncle Tom who has been like a\r\nsaviour to his own boys in the hour of their peril in forest and river,\r\nsends both of the slaves into the cotton plantations of Louisiana,\r\nbreaking his solemn pledge to his wife and his family, in the hope that\r\nhe could escape from debt, that like a millstone weighed him into the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nThen, the book tries to show how slavery develops the worst men, of the\r\nstamp of Simon Legree, the brutal overseer. Legree pours out the vials\r\nof his wrath upon the slaves about him, debauching a young octaroon to\r\nthe level of his mistress, hunting his slaves with bloodhounds, killing\r\nthem without trial before a jury. Power is dangerous; there is the czar\r\nspirit in every man. Slavery made a brute still more brutal--made the\r\nsensual man more sensual, and finally debased Legree to the level of the\r\ndemon.\r\n\r\nIt is a book full of pathos and tears. Remembering that the book was\r\nwritten for the miscellaneous millions, to rouse the nation at large to\r\nmoral indignation, it is doubtful whether any book was ever more\r\nperfectly adapted to the end aimed at. Literary artists have criticized\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" and contrasted it with \"Henry Esmond,\" \"Vanity\r\nFair\" and \"Adam Bede.\" But if Thackeray, Dickens and George Eliot\r\nachieved unique success in creating books that should reach their set,\r\none thing is certain,--the boys, who afterwards became the soldiers of\r\nthe Civil War, read \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" with dim eyes and indignant\r\nhearts, because the book found their judgment and their conscience, and\r\nlifted them to the point where they were made ready in the day of God's\r\npower, to fight the battle for freedom.\r\n\r\nWhen all the school children had read the death of little Eva and of\r\nUncle Tom, and all the farmers and working men--the dwellers in city and\r\ncountry, from seaboard to mountains and prairie--had followed the career\r\nof these slaves to the end, and the people of the North were fully awake\r\nto the horror of the slave traffic, the multitudes began to look with\r\nquestioning eyes into each other's faces, asking, \"What can be done?\r\nWhat is the next step?\" And then it was that a fanatic entered the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nHis name was John Brown, descended from Peter Brown, a Pilgrim of the\r\n_Mayflower_. He had been cattle-drover, tanner and wool-merchant. When\r\nabout forty years of age he was living in Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\nOne night, in 1849, a runaway slave knocked at his door and told Brown\r\nthe story of his flight, of the weeks he had spent hiding in the swamps,\r\nof his escape to the fastnesses of the mountains, of his life in the\r\nforest, and how he finally reached New York and Springfield. It was a\r\nstory of starvation, hunger, cold, blows and piercing anguish. Long\r\nafter the children had gone to bed at midnight, while the slave was\r\nsleeping in a blanket beside the fire, John Brown sat musing over the\r\nnational infamy. All the next day and night the conference continued\r\nwith this runaway, who was also a negro preacher. The following night\r\nJohn Brown assembled his sons. He closed the door and told his family\r\nhis decision. He was a tall man, over six feet, straight and lithe,\r\nslightly gray, with thin lips and smooth face. The Bible was almost the\r\nonly book in the house, and no sound was so familiar as the voice of\r\nprayer. Brown was lifted into the prophetic mood. He told his family\r\nthat he had decided to give himself, and to consecrate them, to\r\nrighting the wrongs of the slaves; that he had heard a voice calling him\r\nto the work of the deliverer; that he would be killed, and that they\r\nmust expect also to die the martyr's death, and that henceforth they\r\nmust expect only crusts, wounds, bitter enmity, and finally martyrdom. A\r\nlittle later and Brown had moved the younger children of his family to\r\nNorth Elba, in the Adirondack woods, that the slaves on the underground\r\nroute might be able to hide in the forest, in the event of the pursuers\r\novertaking them. Brown then began to travel along Mason and Dixon's line\r\nfrom the city of Washington through to Topeka, Kan. From time to time he\r\nwould cross the line, take charge of a little group of slaves, and\r\nhiding by day and travelling by night, carry them from one underground\r\nstation to another. It was said that he had personally conducted runaway\r\nslaves along every route for a thousand miles from East to West, between\r\nthe Atlantic and the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nOne of the friends of Brown's childhood was the Hon. James B. Grinnell,\r\nwho founded the town and college in Iowa. This congressman loved to tell\r\nthe story of the night when John Brown knocked at his door. Outside was\r\na wagon, packed with slaves, whom Brown had carried across the line from\r\nMissouri. He had driven four horses at their limit of speed for a\r\nhundred miles and had no defenders, save two or three men and as many\r\nguns. \"I am a dealer in wool,\" said the stranger, \"and my name is\r\nCaptain John Brown of Kansas.\" The first thing Mr. Grinnell did was to\r\nfind a shelter for these slaves, with food and beds. The next thing was\r\nto hide the wagon and the horses in the thick grove near by. Early the\r\nnext morning the news spread like wild-fire, and the settlers began to\r\npour in. John Brown made a speech to the farmers and justified his act.\r\nThe villagers were terrified lest the pursuers come any moment and burn\r\ntheir houses. The three Congregational ministers offered prayers, asked\r\nfor help, and started out to raise money. When the night fell the slaves\r\nwere rushed to the terminus of the railway and carried through to\r\nChicago, being shipped in a freight car as sheep, to distinguish their\r\nwoolly heads from the goats, named white men.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 John Brown led his five sons and their families into Kansas, to\r\nhelp preëmpt the State for freedom. When at length the free state\r\nvoters won an election and enthroned their governor, two thousand\r\npro-slavery men from Missouri crossed the State line, burned the little\r\ntown of Lawrence, and at the point of the pistol compelled the State\r\nofficials to resign; issued writs for a new election, put in a slavery\r\ngovernor, captured the government, and started back into Missouri. On\r\ntheir way they passed through Pottawatamie. It was a guerrilla warfare.\r\nWhen John Brown reached his son's cabin, he found the settlers preparing\r\nfor flight. He denounced them as cowards, and when one urged caution,\r\nanswered, \"I am tired of that word Caution. It is nothing but\r\ncowardice!\" Either the border ruffians had to go, or else the settlers\r\nmust leave without striking a single blow in defense of their homes. A\r\nman's cabin was his castle. Without waiting for the next attack to be\r\nmade, John Brown pointed the settlers to the smoking ashes of cabins\r\nalready burned and to the bodies that the Missouri guerrillas had left\r\non the ground, and took the aggressive himself. He seized five of the\r\noutlaws and killed them for their crime.\r\n\r\nThe deed fired Kansas, some say freed Kansas, while others think it\r\nopened the Civil War. Withdrawing to the forest, hiding in the\r\ncottonwood swamps, John Brown organized his company. A reporter of the\r\n_New York Tribune_ finally penetrated the thicket. \"Near the edge of the\r\ncreek a dozen horses were tied, already saddled for a ride for life. A\r\ndozen rifles were stacked against the trees. In an open space was a\r\nblazing fire with a pot above it. Three or four armed men were lying on\r\nred and blue blankets on the grass. John Brown himself stood near the\r\nfire with his shirt sleeves rolled up and a piece of pork in his hand.\r\nHe was poorly clad, and his toes protruded from his boots. The old man\r\nreceived me with great cordiality, and the little band gathered about\r\nme. He respectfully, but firmly, forbade conversation on the\r\nPottawatamie affair. After the meal, thanks were returned to the\r\nbountiful Giver. Often, I was told, the old man would retire to the\r\ndensest solitudes to wrestle with his God in prayer. He said he was\r\nfighting God's battles for his children's sake: 'Give me men of good\r\nprinciples, God-fearing men, men who respect themselves, and with a\r\ndozen of them I will oppose a hundred such men as these border\r\nruffians.' I remained in the camp about an hour. Never before had I met\r\nsuch a band of men. They were not earnest, but earnestness incarnate.\"\r\n\r\nAfter several years of bloody conflict and political struggles between\r\nthe pro-slavery and anti-slavery parties, in 1859 the Constitution\r\nprohibiting slavery was passed, and freedom had won in Kansas. In\r\nJanuary of that year John Brown returned to the mountains of Virginia,\r\nand \"The Great Black Way,\" and the dark shadows of the night following\r\nthe North Star to liberty. For many years he had been planning an\r\nuprising of the slaves, and an attack upon Virginia. Some biographers\r\nthink he conceived the plan as early as 1849. Away back in 1834 Brown\r\nwrote to his brother his determination to war on slavery; but at first\r\nonly through educating the blacks. As time went on he came into sterner\r\nconflict with it.\r\n\r\nBrown, in fact, became a fanatic who really believed that the millions\r\nof slaves would rise at his call, and that he could lead his host as a\r\nnew Moses, out of the land of bondage. He intended to operate in the\r\nBlue Ridge Mountains, because the paths into the black belt of slavery\r\nwere easily followed. Men like Douglas and other escaped slaves who\r\nwere living in the North did not see their way clear to join the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October 16, 1859, John Brown, with sixteen men, started out\r\nto capture Harper's Ferry and redeem three million slaves. Brown rode in\r\na one-horse wagon, that held provisions, pikes, one sledge-hammer and\r\none crowbar; his sixteen men, with guns, followed on foot. Without a\r\nsingle shot they captured the armoury and the rifle factory, and at\r\ndaylight, without the snap of a gun or any violence whatsoever, they\r\nwere in possession of Harper's Ferry. On Monday morning the panic spread\r\nlike wild-fire. The rumour went abroad of an uprising of all the slaves\r\nof the South. In a few hours the governor called out the militia,\r\nJefferson guards marched down the Potomac, and two local companies took\r\npositions on the heights. The assault began in the afternoon. One by one\r\nBrown's handful were killed, his two sons, Oliver and Watson, were shot\r\ndown, and Brown, badly wounded, was captured.\r\n\r\nThe trial and examination of the old fanatic makes a fascinating story.\r\nAt noon of Tuesday, the governor of Virginia bent over him as he lay\r\nwounded and blood-stained upon the floor. \"Who are you?\" asked the\r\ngovernor. \"My name is John Brown; I have been well known as old John\r\nBrown of Kansas. Two of my sons were killed here to-day, and I am dying\r\ntoo. I came here to liberate slaves, and was to receive no reward. I\r\nhave acted from a sense of duty, and am content to await my fate. I am\r\nan old man. If I had succeeded in running off slaves this time, I could\r\nhave raised twenty times as many men as I have now for a similar\r\nexpedition; but I have failed.\"\r\n\r\nThen Governor Wise said, \"The silver of your hair is reddened by the\r\nblood of crime. You should think upon eternity.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Brown replied, \"Governor, I have not more than fifteen or twenty\r\nyears the start of you to that eternity, and I am prepared to go. There\r\nis an eternity behind and an eternity before, and this little speck in\r\nthe centre is but a minute. The difference between your time and mine is\r\ntrifling, and I therefore tell you--be prepared. I am prepared--you have\r\na heavy responsibility. It behooves you to prepare, and more than it\r\ndoes me.\"\r\n\r\nFriends in the North tried to secure Brown's release, but he answered\r\nthem: \"I think I cannot now better serve the cause I love so much than\r\nto die for it, and in my death I may do more than in my life. I believe\r\nthat for me, at this time, to seal my testimony for God and humanity\r\nthrough my blood will do vastly more towards advancing the cause I have\r\nearnestly endeavoured to promote than all I have done in my life\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the court asked Brown if he had any reason why he should not be\r\nhung, he answered: \"This court acknowledges the validity of the law of\r\nGod. I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible. That book\r\nteaches me to remember them that are in bonds as bound with them. I\r\nendeavoured to act up to that instruction. I believe that to interfere\r\nas I have done, in behalf of God's poor, was not wrong, but right. I am\r\nquite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged\r\naway but with blood. If it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my\r\nlife for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood\r\nfurther with the blood of my children, and with the blood of millions in\r\nthis slave country, whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel and\r\nunjust enactments, I submit. So let it be done.\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his hanging he visited his doomed companions, and then\r\nkissed his wife good-bye. A thousand soldiers stood round about his\r\nscaffold. \"This is a beautiful land,\" said Brown, as he rode, looking\r\nacross the landscape. As he climbed the steps of the scaffold a negro\r\nchild stood between some black men, and some say he stooped and kissed\r\nthe child. And this was his prayer:\r\n\r\n\"My love to all who love their neighbours. I have asked to be spared\r\nfrom having any weak or hypocritical prayers said over me when I am\r\npublicly murdered, and that my only religious attendants be poor,\r\nlittle, dirty, ragged, bareheaded, and barefooted slave boys and girls,\r\nled by some gray-headed slave mother.... Farewell, farewell.\" He died in\r\nthe spirit of the letter written the day before, when he said, \"I think\r\nI feel as happy as Paul did when he lay in prison, for men cannot chain\r\nor hang the soul.\"\r\n\r\nHis deed puzzled the world. For multitudes it is still an enigma. To\r\nmany, John Brown seems not only a fanatic but a lunatic. To others, now\r\nthat long time has passed, this white-haired old man, weltering in his\r\nblood, which he had spilled for a broken and despised race, seems\r\nright, and he seems to have died, not as a fool dies, but as martyrs\r\ndie. That his enterprise was doomed to failure in advance, all knew.\r\nThat it was not the wisest plan, Brown's best friends must grant. But\r\nthat its fanaticism was overruled by God to release the great South from\r\nthe incubus of slavery, Brown's friends and Brown's enemies alike must\r\nconcede.\r\n\r\nWhat other men had been writing about, John Brown did in action. The\r\nattack on Harper's Ferry was the first blow struck during the Civil War.\r\nOther men and women assembled the explosives, but John Brown dropped the\r\nspark in the magazine, which finally blew up that hindrance to progress,\r\nslavery--the Hell Gate obstruction in the passageway of the South and of\r\nall civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nLINCOLN AND DOUGLAS: INFLUENCE OF THE GREAT DEBATE\r\n\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, there were three stages in the development of the\r\nanti-slavery sentiment leading up to the Civil War. There was the period\r\nof indifference, from 1759 to 1830, when the North winked at slavery,\r\nignored the traffic and avoided the whole subject. There was the epoch\r\nof agitation, from 1831 to 1850, when Garrison and his friends insisted\r\nupon \"the immediate and unconditional emancipation of the slaves on the\r\nsoil,\" and the agitation was kept up by men who \"would not retreat, who\r\nwould not equivocate, who would not be silent and who would be heard.\"\r\nThen came the stage when men tried legislative palliatives; when all\r\nmanner of political medicaments and poultices were tried as cures, which\r\nwere about as effective in destroying the poison as a porous plaster\r\nwould be to draw out the fire from a volcano. For more than sixty years\r\na veil had hung before men's minds, and it was as if they saw slaves as\r\ntrees walking, in an unreal world. The sea captain fears a fog more than\r\nan equinoctial storm. When the mist falls, and obscures the glass, and\r\nthe ship is surrounded with white darkness, and the surf is thundering\r\non some Nantucket, as a graveyard of the sea, the captain longs for a\r\ncold, sharp wind out of the North, to cut the fog and bring out the\r\nstars and sun. And not otherwise was it with the great debate between\r\nLincoln and Douglas--it lifted the veil from men's eyes, it swept the\r\nfog out of the air, it made the issue clear. Then it was that for the\r\nfirst time the North saw that the conflict was inevitable, because the\r\nUnion could not endure permanently, half slave and half free; saw that\r\nliberty and slavery were as irreconcilable as day and night.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the influence of Lincoln's clear thinking and\r\nspeaking upon the eternal principles of right, we must note the general\r\nreawakening of the popular intelligence which preceded it, and which was\r\ndue to two causes, the panic of 1857 and the religious revival which\r\nswept over the land during the same year. As the Northern merchant\r\nbegan to see that the South had determined to secede and try her fate\r\nalone, he became afraid to sell his goods to Southern customers. The\r\nNorthern manufacturer, in turn, was overstocked, and if the banker\r\ncalled his loans there was no response, for the chain was broken; the\r\nresult was the panic of 1857. Hunger and Want stalked through the\r\nland--Winter and Poverty became bosom friends. Black despair fell upon\r\nthe people and in the hour of need they cried unto God, and God heard\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen a nation prospers and grows rich, religion languishes. When nations\r\nenter upon disaster and peril, the people turn unto God. Abundance\r\nenervates. Morals always sink to a low level when men's eyes stand out\r\nwith fatness.\r\n\r\nWhat agitation, what the liberator and the lecture platform, what\r\nstatesmen and compromisers could not achieve, was accomplished by the\r\nspirit of God working upon the hearts of men, clarifying the intellect,\r\ndeepening the sympathy and lending vigour to the will.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the leader of an orchestra does is to see to it that the\r\ninstruments are all unified and brought up to concert pitch, and the\r\nrevival of religion made the people one in self-sacrifice and their\r\nwillingness to live and die for their convictions.\r\n\r\nMultitudes returned to the churches. Thoughtless youth discovered that\r\nthere are only two great things in the universe--God and the soul.\r\nPersonal religion became the supreme interest of the hour. Men went into\r\nthe crucible commonplace; they came out of it heroic stuff. All over the\r\ncountry the churches were open every night in the week. Moving across\r\nthe country the traveller saw the candles burning in the little\r\nschoolhouses, while the farmers assembled to pray and read God's word.\r\nThe Fulton Street prayer-meeting in New York attracted the interest of\r\nthe nation. The morning newspapers of 1858 carried columns concerning\r\nthe business men's noon prayer-meeting, just as to-day they carry the\r\ncolumn on the stock news and the stock market. In his \"History of the\r\nUnited States\" Rhodes calls attention to the fact that 230 persons\r\njoined Plymouth Church on profession of faith on a single Sunday\r\nmorning. That revival all over the land put its moral stamp upon boys\r\nand girls who afterwards became the leaders of the generation.\r\n\r\nNow every reform and every great war for principle proceeds along\r\nintellectual lines clearly laid out. Twenty-seven years before the\r\nLincoln-Douglas debates, the \"Tariff of Abominations\" had brought up the\r\nquestion of the right of the Southern states to secede. Calhoun had set\r\nup his famous doctrine, and Webster, in his \"Second Reply to Hayne,\" had\r\nknocked it down. The feeling had been intense, but Webster's wonderful\r\noration in defense of the Constitution and the Union had succeeded in\r\nmeeting the crisis, and settling for a time the vexing problem. Yet the\r\nevil of slavery continued its fatal gnawing at the heart of the nation.\r\nBy 1855-6 the old question was up again in much the same form. The\r\natmosphere was clouded, the black shroud of the approaching storm\r\nalready discernible on the horizon. A hundred minor problems united in\r\ncomplicating the discussion of the one all-important thing. Another\r\nleader was wanted to set the battle in array, to mark out the lines of\r\nconflict. Webster and Calhoun were gone, but another was to come to\r\npreserve \"liberty and union, one and inseparable.\" This man was Abraham\r\nLincoln, and the opponent who was to call out his clearest expositions\r\nof the situation, and spur him on to his greatest arguments, was\r\nStephen A. Douglas of Illinois.\r\n\r\nDouglas was born in 1813, in Brandon, Vermont. His father was a\r\nphysician of great promise, who fell with a stroke of apoplexy at a\r\nmoment when he was carrying the child Stephen in his arms. The ambitions\r\nof the father for intellectual leadership were fulfilled in the son, who\r\nat fifteen years of age had attracted the notice of the best minds in\r\nhis region. Strong men became interested in the boy, and advised his\r\nmother to take him to a relative in Canandaigua, N. Y., where there was\r\nan excellent academy. At seventeen he entered a lawyer's office,\r\nattended every trial before the justice of the peace or the county\r\nclerk, and made a local reputation as a student of politics and law. At\r\ntwenty years of age, he started West, to make his fortune, but fell ill\r\nin Cleveland, O., and all but lost his life. A few months later he\r\nentered the town of Winchester, Ill., a stranger, in a strange land. He\r\ncarried his coat on one arm and a little bundle of clothes on the other.\r\nThere was a crowd on the corner of the street, where an auctioneer was\r\nselling the personal effects and live stock of some settler, and within\r\na few minutes Douglas was engaged as clerk at the auction. At the end of\r\nthree days he found himself the possessor of six dollars, which was the\r\nfirst money he had ever earned, and what was far more important, he had\r\nby his accuracy, good nature and kindliness won the hearts of the\r\npurchasers, and attracted the attention of the two or three leading men\r\nof the town. That winter he opened a private school, in which forty\r\nscholars were enrolled, while he continued his studies of law during the\r\nlong evenings. Ten crowded and successful years soon swept by, and those\r\nyears held remarkable achievements. He was admitted to the bar, elected\r\nto the Legislature, made Secretary of State, judge of the Supreme Court,\r\nand at thirty was sent to Congress. He spent three years in Congress; at\r\nthirty-six was chosen to fill out an unexpired term in the Senate, was\r\nreëlected to represent Illinois, and a third time was chosen senator--a\r\ncareer of uniform and splendid success from the material view-point.\r\n\r\nBut the career of Douglas in Washington was the career of an\r\nopportunist, at once full of good and full of evil, full of right and\r\nfull of wrong. He was a born politician, an expert manager of men and a\r\nnatural machine builder. Many others outranked Douglas in set speeches,\r\nbut few equalled him in \"catch as catch can\" methods of the politician.\r\nWhat Douglas prided himself upon was his skill in getting through the\r\ncommittee measures that were difficult to pass. When it became necessary\r\nto get a man's vote for his measure, Douglas would put that man up as a\r\nleader, give him the glory, obliterate himself, and after the bill was\r\npassed, hop up like a jack in the pulpit, as the real manager who\r\nmanoeuvred the bill through the Senate. He spent two years on the\r\nlegislation that brought about the Illinois Central Railroad, and as\r\nlong a time in founding the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nOften Douglas did things that he believed to be morally wrong because he\r\ndiscovered that they were politically necessary. For example, a reaction\r\nfollowed upon the election of the Democrat, James K. Polk, to the\r\npresidency. When his leadership was imperilled, Polk cast about for some\r\nissue that would bring together the remnants of his party, and restore\r\nleadership, and he hit upon the device of the Mexican War. No party was\r\never defeated that was fighting a war for the defense of the country.\r\nDouglas criticized Polk most sharply, charged the war upon Polk as a\r\ncrime against the people, and yet, under the whip of party policy,\r\nDouglas supported Polk. Slowly he deteriorated in his moral fibre. One\r\nby one the moral lights seem to have gone out. He was intoxicated by his\r\nown success. Ambition deluded him. He began to follow the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp, the light that rises from putrescence and decay in the\r\nswamp, and forgot the eternal stars in God's sky. In 1854 he entered the\r\nvalley of decision, and like the rich young ruler made the great\r\nrefusal, and chose compromise instead of principle. Later Douglas led\r\nhis party along a false route, and became a mistaken leader.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were these; the compromise measures of 1850 had\r\nsucceeded apparently in achieving the aim of their author, Henry Clay.\r\nThe close of the year 1853 was marked by political repose and calm. The\r\nslavery question seemed practically settled. As President Pierce\r\nexpressed it in his message, \"A sense of security\" had been \"restored to\r\nthe public mind throughout the Confederacy.\" Prosperity was blessing the\r\ncountry, times were good, the future bright with the promise of immense\r\nindustrial achievements. In Congress, a bill for the organization of the\r\nterritory of Nebraska had passed the House at the previous session, and\r\nwas being reported to the Senate, but the bill was in the usual form and\r\ncontained no reference to slavery. Suddenly the press announced that\r\nSenator Douglas had read a report on this bill, purporting to show that\r\nthe compromise measures of 1850 had established a great principle; that\r\nthis principle stated the perpetual right of the residents of new States\r\nto decide all questions pertaining to slavery; and that therefore,\r\ncontrary to the old Missouri Compromise, ruling slavery out of that\r\nNorthwest territory, it left the slavery question entirely in the hands\r\nof the residents of the new territory of Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe announcement created a profound sensation. Twelve days later a\r\nKentucky senator by the name of Dixon introduced an amendment to the\r\nNebraska Act, providing for the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The\r\ndaring of this move startled even Douglas, but within a few days the\r\nIllinois senator had decided to support the Dixon Amendment. With all\r\nthe skill and political engineering at his command, he steered the bill\r\nthrough the tempest which immediately rose against it like a tidal wave;\r\nand on the third of March, in spite of protests which poured in from\r\nevery State in the North, in spite of indignation meetings held in New\r\nYork, Boston and Philadelphia, in spite of the opposition of the leaders\r\nlike Seward, Chase and Sumner, he actually succeeded in persuading the\r\nSenate to pass the bill. That he was able to do this, is a great tribute\r\nto his powers as a politician and as an orator. He spoke from midnight\r\nuntil dawn, employing every possible trick of rhetoric and logic to\r\ncarry his point, and showing a courtesy and restraint in his attack\r\nwhich won the sympathy even of his opponents. \"Never had a bad cause\r\nbeen more splendidly advocated.\"\r\n\r\nBut the victory was a costly one; he had made the Fugitive Slave Law a\r\ndead letter in the North; he had introduced a new term, \"popular\r\nsovereignty,\" which was to rouse the nation as a red rag rouses a bull.\r\nHe had started a storm, wrote Seward, \"such as this country has never\r\nyet seen.\" Every great newspaper editor in the North,--Greeley, Dana,\r\nRaymond, Webb, Bigelow, Weed,--broke into violent protest against the\r\nbill. Not since the fight at Lexington had such a fierce and universal\r\ncry of reproach arisen in the land.\r\n\r\nAnd for what had he done all this? Simply that he might increase his\r\nchances of obtaining the presidential nomination in 1856. The \"solid\r\nSouth\" had just begun to be spoken of. Douglas was an acute observer,\r\nand he saw that if he could secure the backing of the South, he would\r\nhave an immense advantage over his rival Cass. It is said that his\r\nobjection to the Dixon Amendment was overborne solely by the fear that\r\nCass would be before him in supporting it, and thus win the favour of\r\nthe South. It is the old story of the mess of pottage. Douglas\r\nafterwards tried to defend himself on the ground that he was offering to\r\nthe Democratic party \"fresh ammunition,\" but all knew, and none better\r\nthan Douglas, that the Democratic party was in no need of a fresh issue.\r\nHe had ruthlessly destroyed the peace of the whole nation, for the sake\r\nof promoting his own selfish interests,--and that, in vain; as in 1853,\r\nDouglas failed to secure the Democratic nomination for the presidency in\r\n1856, which was won by Buchanan.\r\n\r\nThe bill cost Douglas his prestige, and lost him the confidence of one\r\nhalf the people of Chicago and Illinois. His friends called him home in\r\nthe hope that he might win back the popularity he had lost. But Chicago\r\nwould have none of him. He entered the city unwelcomed, had to hire a\r\nbuilding in which to speak, advertised his own meeting, and on the day\r\nof the meeting found the flags at half-mast, while the church bells\r\ntolled the funeral of liberty, where hitherto the bells had pealed the\r\nnotes of joy.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to admire Douglas's courage in that trying ordeal.\r\nHe found the hall filled with his opponents, yet he began by saying, \"My\r\nfellow citizens, I appear before you to vindicate the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill.\" The words evoked a perfect tumult, which continued for half an\r\nhour. He appealed to their sense of fair play and honour, but they asked\r\nhim whether he had played fair with liberty in Washington. Growing\r\nangry, he tried to denounce them as cowards, afraid to listen to a\r\ndiscussion, and they answered that it was cowardly to desert a slave who\r\nneeded a defender. At eleven o'clock he flung his arms in the air and\r\ndared them to shoot, because a man had waved a pistol. The crowd\r\nanswered with a shower of eggs, while a man shouted that bullets were\r\ntoo valuable to be wasted on traitors. At twelve o'clock the bells rang\r\nout the midnight. Douglas pulled out his watch and shouted, \"It is\r\nmidnight. I am going home and to church, and you may go to Hades!\"\r\nDouglas met a mob in Chicago, just as Beecher met a mob in England. But\r\nBeecher conquered his mob in Manchester; the mob in Chicago conquered\r\nDouglas. Beecher won, because he was right and the mob was wrong;\r\nDouglas lost, because he was wrong and the mob was right. \"You can fool\r\nall of the people some of the time, and you can fool some of the people\r\nall the time; you cannot fool all of the people all of the time\" on the\r\ngreat principles of liberty. Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska Bill brought on\r\nan era of civil war in Kansas, sent the guerrillas over the Sunflower\r\nState, burned Lawrence, destroyed the State government and filled the\r\nwhole land with tumult and bitterness. And it cost Douglas his fame and\r\nplace among the great men of the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn that critical hour for liberty, Abraham Lincoln entered upon the\r\nscene, and challenged Douglas to a debate. It was in the summer of 1858.\r\nBoth men were candidates for the Senate--Lincoln, the leader of the new\r\nRepublican party State ticket; Douglas, the best known figure in the\r\nland since the death of Clay and Webster. No contrast between two men\r\ncould have been greater. Lincoln was tall, angular, lanky, awkward, six\r\nfeet four inches in height. Douglas was short, thick-set, graceful,\r\npolished, a man of fine presence, with a great, beautiful head, a high\r\nforehead, square chin, perfectly at home on the platform, a master of\r\nall the tricks of debate, a born king of assemblies. Lincoln was the\r\nstronger man, Douglas the more polished. Lincoln was the better thinker,\r\nDouglas the better orator. Lincoln relied upon fundamental principles,\r\nDouglas wanted to win his case. Lincoln's mind was analytical, and he\r\nloved to take a theme and unfold it, peeling it like an onion, layer by\r\nlayer. For Douglas, an oration was a pile of ideas, three hours high.\r\nLincoln's voice was a high dusty tenor, with small range, and\r\nmonotonous; Douglas's voice was a magnificent vocal instrument,\r\nextending from the flute-like tone to the deepest roar. Lincoln lacked\r\nevery grace of the great orator; Douglas had every art that makes the\r\nspeaker master of his audience. Morally, Lincoln's essential qualities\r\nwere his honesty, fairness, and his spirit of good will. Intellectually,\r\nhe was a thinker, slow, intense, profound, always trying to find a\r\nmother principle that would explain a concrete fact. He was reared in\r\nchildhood on three works--the Bible, Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress\" and\r\nthe Constitution of the United States. The style of the parable of Jesus\r\nand the simple words of the \"Pilgrim's Progress\" entered into his\r\nthinking like iron into the rich blood of the physical system. His\r\nthought was as clear as crystal, his language the simple home words,\r\nfull of music and old associations. Lincoln knew what he wanted to say,\r\nsaid it, and sat down. Douglas stormed, threatened, cajoled, bribed, and\r\ncould not stop until he had carried his audience. Lincoln wanted to get\r\nthe truth out; Douglas wanted to win a crowd over. The one was a\r\nstatesman, the other was an opportunist, struggling for place.\r\nPrinciples are eternal, and because Lincoln loved principles, Lincoln\r\nbelongs to the ages. Douglas wanted office, and because the longest\r\noffice is six years, when the six years were over, the people put\r\nanother man in his niche; Douglas practically disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the people in the seven great joint debates arranged\r\nfor this senatorial campaign was beyond all description. Douglas\r\ntravelled in a special train and car, with a flat car carrying a cannon\r\nthat boomed the announcement of his arrival. He had the wealth and\r\nprestige of the Illinois Central Railroad to support him. Lincoln\r\ntrusted to some friend to drive him across country, or had to be\r\ncontented with a seat in a caboose of a freight train, waiting on a\r\nswitch at a siding, while Douglas's special went whizzing by. The people\r\nof each county made the day of the debate a great holiday. From daylight\r\nuntil noon all the converging roads were crowded with wagons, carts and\r\nbuggies, loaded with people, while other thousands hurried on foot along\r\nthe dusty road to the meeting place. From the first Douglas knew his\r\nperil, in that the eyes of the nation were fixed upon his platform, and\r\nthat if Lincoln won the debate he won everything. He paid Lincoln the\r\ncompliment of saying, \"He is the strong man of his party, full of wit,\r\nfacts, dates, and the best stump-speaker, with his droll ways and his\r\ndry jokes, in the West. He is as honest as he is shrewd, and if I beat\r\nhim my victory will be hardly won.\"\r\n\r\nVery different was the praise that Lincoln gave Douglas, as he\r\ncontrasted the dazzling fame of the great senator with his own unknown\r\nname. \"With me,\" said Lincoln, \"the race of ambition has been a failure,\r\na flat failure; with him it has been one of splendid success. I affect\r\nno contempt for the high eminence he has reached; ... I would rather\r\nstand on that eminence than wear the richest crown that ever pressed a\r\nmonarch's brow.\" Douglas's speeches do not read well, and there are no\r\nnuggets, proverbs, bright sayings or brilliant epigrams which one can\r\nquote. The substance of his speeches was one and the same, for he\r\ntraversed the same ground in each of the seven debates, urging ever that\r\nthe new Republican party was simply disguised abolitionism, that Lincoln\r\nwanted to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law, establish the equality of the\r\nblacks, that this was a threat of war against the South, and therefore\r\nrevolutionary and sectional. Over against this mark consider the clarity\r\nof Lincoln's method of thinking and speaking.\r\n\r\nIn his address to the convention, accepting the senatorial nomination,\r\nhe had said: \"If we could first know where we are and whither we are\r\ntending, we could better judge what to do and how to do it. We are now\r\nfar into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed\r\nobject and confident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation.\r\nUnder the operation of that policy that agitation has not only not\r\nceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease\r\nuntil a crisis has been reached and passed. A house divided against\r\nitself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently\r\nhalf slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved; I\r\ndo not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be\r\ndivided. It will become all one thing or all the other.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the campaign opened he challenged Douglas to the debate, and the\r\ncritical contest began.\r\n\r\nAfter several meetings, in which the senator proved himself a slippery\r\nwrestler, Lincoln determined to force Douglas into a corner. He wrote a\r\nquestion, and with such skill that Douglas was compelled to answer one\r\nway or the other, either answer being fatal to his political ambition.\r\nWhen Lincoln read this question to his advisers, Medill, Washburne and\r\nJudd, all begged him not to ask it, saying that it would cost him the\r\nsenatorship. \"Yes, but my loss of the senatorship is nothing. Later on\r\nit will cost Douglas the presidency. I am killing bigger game. The\r\nbattle of 1860 is worth a hundred of 1858.\" The question with which\r\nDouglas was confronted was this: \"Can the people of any United States\r\nterritory, in any lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the\r\nUnited States, exclude slavery from its limit prior to the formation of\r\na State constitution?\"\r\n\r\nWhat a path perilous was this for Douglas's feet! The path up the edge\r\nof the Matterhorn is a foot wide, yet it is granite, even if the climber\r\ndoes look down thousands of feet upon his right and thousands of feet\r\nupon his left. But Lincoln made Douglas walk not upon a narrow granite\r\nway, but on a sharp sword. He who tries to walk a tight rope across\r\nNiagara has two alternatives--he either arrives, or he does not. Yonder\r\nis Stephen Douglas, trying to walk a tight rope over the Niagara.\r\n\r\nForced to an answer, Douglas finally spoke:\r\n\r\n\"It matters not what way the Supreme Court may hereafter decide as to\r\nthe abstract question whether slavery may or may not go into any\r\nterritory under a constitution. The people have the lawful means to\r\nexclude it if they please, for the reason that slavery cannot exist a\r\nday or an hour anywhere unless it is supported by local police\r\nlegislation. Those police regulations can only be established by the\r\nlocal legislature; and if the people are opposed to slavery they will\r\nelect representatives to that body who will by unfriendly legislation\r\neffectually prevent its introduction into their midst; if, on the\r\ncontrary, they are for it, their legislation will favour its extension.\"\r\nDouglas had decided. Southern newspapers took up his statement and the\r\ntide of anger rose against the \"little giant\" that cost him the\r\npresidency. Lincoln had digged a pitfall for unwary feet, and the great\r\nopportunist fell therein.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Douglas became bitter, excited, and increasingly angry, for\r\nthe tide was plainly beginning to run against him. Lincoln's speeches\r\nfairly blazed with quotable sentences. \"If you think you can slander a\r\nwoman into loving you, or a man into voting for you, try it till you are\r\nsatisfied.\" Again: \"Has Douglas the exclusive right in this country to\r\nbe on all sides of all questions?\" Again: \"The plainest print cannot be\r\nread through a gold eagle.\" Again: \"Douglas shirks the responsibility of\r\npulling the national house down, but he digs under it, that it may fall\r\nof its own weight.\"\r\n\r\nTo the astonishment of the country, when the debate was over, Lincoln\r\ncarried Illinois on the popular vote, although he lost the senatorship\r\nthrough the arrangement of legislative districts that gave the election\r\nto the Democrats. Disappointed, Lincoln retained his good humour, and\r\nlaughed over what he called the little episode. \"I feel,\" said Lincoln,\r\n\"like the boy who stubbed his toe; it hurt too hard to laugh, and he was\r\ntoo big to cry. But I have been heard on the great subject of the age,\r\nand though I now sink out of view and shall be forgotten, I believe I\r\nhave made some marks which will tell for the cause of civil liberty long\r\nafter I am gone.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln had now become a national figure. In February, 1860, Mr. Beecher\r\nand Henry C. Bowen invited him to speak in New York. The first plan was\r\nfor him to speak in Plymouth Church, but later considerations led to a\r\nchange to Cooper Institute. Lincoln arrived in the city late in the\r\nweek; on Sunday morning he heard Mr. Beecher preach. He sat in the Bowen\r\npew, just back of the Beecher pew, in the morning; in the evening he\r\narrived very late, and sat in a front pew, in the gallery, with Mr.\r\nBowen and a friend who had waited in the hall for Mr. Lincoln's arrival.\r\nLincoln spent the afternoon at the Sunday-school mission, over in Five\r\nPoints. As the superintendent of the mission was always casting about\r\nfor somebody to talk to his ragamuffins, he asked the tall stranger if\r\nhe would say a few words. When they reached the platform, the\r\nsuperintendent asked Lincoln by what name he should introduce him, to\r\nwhich Lincoln gave the answer, \"Tell them Abraham Lincoln of Illinois,\"\r\nwhich was answer enough. The meeting the next day in Cooper Institute\r\nwas perhaps the most memorable assembly ever held in New York. William\r\nCullen Bryant presided, Horace Greeley sat on Lincoln's right, Peter\r\nCooper close by. \"No man,\" said the _Tribune_, \"since the days of Clay\r\nand Webster, spoke to a larger assemblage of the intellect and mental\r\nculture of our city. The speech was packed with reason, facts, but\r\nstripped bare of rhetorical flourish. Its keynote was, 'Let us have\r\nfaith that right makes might, and in that faith let us to the end dare\r\nto do our duty as we understand it.'\" Four morning newspapers reported\r\nthe speech in full, and Greeley called him the Great Convincer, saying\r\nno man ever before made such an impression in his first appeal to a New\r\nYork audience. That speech probably made Lincoln President.\r\n\r\nBy universal consent, Lincoln's nomination in 1860 is one of the\r\nmysteries of politics. Every man of light and leading conceded Seward's\r\nnomination in advance, and two-thirds of the delegates went to the\r\nconvention pledged, while eight of the Illinois delegates were against\r\nLincoln in his own State. The East could not believe that the sceptre\r\ncould pass from their hands. Special trains from New York carried\r\nbrilliant banners, and New York bands and drilled clubs marched and\r\ncountermarched up and down the streets of Chicago. A great wooden wigwam\r\nset up for the occasion held 10,000 spectators. The placing of Seward in\r\nnomination was wildly applauded. But, to the surprise of everybody, the\r\nnaming of Lincoln was the signal of an outburst of such enthusiasm as\r\nhad never been known. Men held their breath as the votes were\r\nregistered. Seward had 1731/2 against Lincoln's 102. As noted in a\r\nformer chapter, it has been thought that Horace Greeley's standing out\r\nfor Governor Bates of Missouri made possible the shifting of votes for\r\nanother Western man. At all events, on the third ballot Lincoln was\r\nnominated. Now hundreds of correspondents began to write stories of this\r\ngreat unknown. The next day Wendell Phillips demanded from Boston: \"Who\r\nis this county court advocate?\" But there was a man in Washington who\r\ncould speak intelligently concerning the great unknown--his name was\r\nStephen A. Douglas.\r\n\r\nIn that hour Douglas knew the great mistake he had made. The Democratic\r\nconvention of that year at Charleston split their party asunder; the\r\nSoutherners clamoring for secession should Lincoln be elected, and\r\nnominating John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky; the Northerners standing\r\nfast for the Union and compromise, and nominating Stephen A. Douglas;\r\nwhile a \"Constitutional Union\" party of old-line Whigs nominated John\r\nBell of Tennessee. Lincoln's election was the signal for secession.\r\n\r\nIn all the subsequent turmoil, Douglas vigorously sustained the Union\r\nand the Constitution, both in Congress and before the people. When\r\nSumter was fired upon, he hastened to pledge his influence to Lincoln as\r\nwell as to the Union. \"There are no neutrals in this war--only patriots\r\nand traitors.\" Douglas hurried back to Illinois to unify the state for\r\nthe Union; he had borrowed $80,000 for his campaign, and he staggered\r\nunder the burden of debt. Also he had injured his constitution by\r\nexcess, and burned the candle at both ends by overwork. But above all\r\nelse was the thought that he had made the great mistake, and lost his\r\nplace in history, in saying that he did not care whether a new State\r\nvoted slavery up or voted slavery down. During his last sickness he\r\nmurmured incessantly, \"Failure--I have failed.\" His last words were:\r\n\"Telegraph to the President and let the columns move on.\"\r\n\r\nDouglas died on June 3, 1861, at the age of forty-eight. The lesson of\r\nhis life is the danger of compromise, the peril of refusing adherence to\r\nthe highest ideals of principle, and the failure of expediency and\r\nopportunism.\r\n\r\nAs Douglas's star went down, Lincoln's star began to climb the sky. It\r\nwas Douglas himself who held Lincoln's hat while he made his first\r\ninaugural address. By the irony of fate it was Chief Justice Taney of\r\nthe Dred Scott Decision who inaugurated Lincoln into office, that\r\nLincoln might later make Taney's decision forever null and void.\r\n\r\nAnd that no dramatic note might be wanted, both Taney and Douglas heard\r\nLincoln plead with indescribable pathos, majesty and beauty, for the\r\nvery Union whose existence their words had threatened. \"Physically\r\nspeaking, we [the North and South] cannot separate. We cannot remove our\r\nrespective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r\nbetween them. Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make\r\nlaws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws\r\ncan among friends? Suppose you go to war? You cannot fight always, and\r\nafter much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting,\r\nthe identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon\r\nyou. In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine,\r\nis the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail\r\nyou. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.\r\nYou have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it. I am\r\nloath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.\r\nThough passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of\r\naffection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattle-field and patriotic grave to every living heart and hearthstone\r\nall over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when\r\nagain touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nBut the great debate through arguments was ended. Henceforth, the appeal\r\nwas to arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR SECESSION: SOUTHERN LEADERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas convinced both the North\r\nand the South: but, confirming the one for union and liberty, it\r\nconfirmed the other for independence and slavery. Lincoln convinced the\r\nNorth that the Union could not endure permanently half slave and half\r\nfree; on the other hand, the South saw just as clearly that the Union,\r\nif it endured, must become all free or all slave. When the men of\r\nlight and leading in the North fully understood Lincoln's\r\n\"House-divided-against-itself\" speech, they went over to the Republican\r\nparty, and nominated and elected Lincoln president, that he might put\r\nslavery in a position of gradual extinction, by forbidding its future\r\ngrowth. The South acted with even greater energy and decision, by making\r\nready to secede, and arming her citizens for the defense of slavery. The\r\ngreat debate, through words, had lasted thirty years; now the South\r\nmade its appeal to regiments of armed men.\r\n\r\nAt that moment slavery controlled the President, the Cabinet, the Senate\r\nand the House. And yet immediately after the election, and before the\r\ninauguration of Lincoln, the Secretary of War, Floyd, secretly began the\r\ntransfer of munitions of war from the nation's arsenals to the Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nLate one December day in 1860, a Southern gentleman hastened to the\r\nWhite House. On the steps he met an old friend who had just left\r\nBuchanan. Waving his hat, he shouted, \"This is a glorious day! South\r\nCarolina has seceded!\" That night an impromptu banquet was held in\r\nWashington, at which the Southern leaders drank to the success of the\r\nslave empire that was to be founded, and talked about a Southern army, a\r\nSouthern navy, the annexation of Mexico and the West India Islands. Then\r\nswiftly followed the secession of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas\r\nand Florida.\r\n\r\nAlmost every week during the winter of 1861 witnessed the spectacle of\r\nSouthern Senators and Representatives saying good-bye to Congress and\r\nannouncing the withdrawal of their State from the Union. Those were\r\ndays of thick darkness at Washington. Gloom fell upon the North. Already\r\nthe shadow of the great eclipse was stealing across the face of Abraham\r\nLincoln. It seemed as if the government, \"conceived in liberty and\r\ndedicated to the proposition that all men were created equal,\" was about\r\nto \"perish from the earth.\" Hamilton had called the Republic \"the last,\r\nbest hope of earth.\" Burke had characterized the Constitution \"an event\r\nas wonderful as if a new star had arisen on the horizon to shine as\r\nbright as the planets.\" Now the star was to fall out of the sky! Up to\r\nthe day of his inauguration Lincoln could not believe the South would\r\never fire on the flag, or take up arms against the Union. \"We are\r\nfriends, and not enemies--we must not be enemies.\" But it was not to be\r\nas Lincoln wished. There are some diseases so terrible that they must be\r\ncured by the knife and the cautery. Slavery had fastened on the very\r\nvitals of the South. Therefore, God permitted the surgery of war.\r\n\r\nLincoln's inaugural address on March 4, 1861, caused a certain solemn\r\nhush to fall upon the land. Its logic, the facts it contained, the\r\nprinciples it presented, were so convincing for the intellect and yet\r\nso suffused with pathos and beauty and majesty, that the people, North\r\nand South alike, stood uncertain and expectant.\r\n\r\nBut the silence was premonitory. In summer, after a hot, sultry day,\r\nwhen the great city has exhaled poisonous gases, the clouds are piled\r\nmountain high on the horizon. Then a hush comes. Not a leaf stirs. It is\r\nhard to breathe. Suddenly one bolt leaps from the east to the west--the\r\nprecursor of ten thousand fiery darts that are to burn the poison away,\r\nand of the heavy rains and winds that will wash the air and make it\r\nsweet and clean. On the 12th of April the silence for the nation was\r\nbroken by the shot fired at Fort Sumter. The bomb that went shrieking\r\nthrough the air was the precursor of a million men in arms, the most\r\nfrightful carnage, the most terrible war in history, when brother took\r\nup arms against brother, and the whole land became one vast cemetery.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that South Carolina fired on Fort Sumter and began an\r\naggressive war to destroy the Union, before the South was ready.\r\nProbably the fact in the case is that South Carolina was trying to \"fire\r\nthe Southern heart,\" and force the State of Virginia into the secession\r\nmovement. The Old Dominion State was naturally a Union State. It was a\r\nVirginian who uttered the most impassioned words in the history of\r\nliberty--Patrick Henry at Williamsburg. It was a Virginian who led the\r\ncolonial armies to victory--Washington. It was a Virginian who wrote the\r\nDeclaration of Independence--Thomas Jefferson. He too, a Virginian\r\ngovernor, made the great protest to King George against the further\r\nimposition of slavery by force of arms. He too, a Virginian, the founder\r\nof Washington and Jefferson College, had called upon the men of the\r\nDominion State to rise up and destroy the curse of slavery. But from the\r\nmoment when that shell rose through the pathless air, curved slightly\r\nand burst above Sumter, the die was cast. Five days later, Virginia\r\npassed her ordinance of secession.\r\n\r\nOh, if the veil could have been lifted from Beauregard's eyes when he\r\nbegan that bombardment! If he could but have seen the riches become\r\npoverty, cities become a waste, happy homes a desolation, the Southern\r\nhillsides covered with graves, the Southern plantations grown up with\r\nweeds, and the whole secession movement futile, what a vision would\r\nhave fallen upon the soldier!\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, President Lincoln called for 75,000 troops. If he had asked\r\nfor a million, the President would have had them. That shot had kindled\r\na fire of patriotism that swept across the North like a prairie fire. In\r\none day the college students deserted the lecture halls, the students of\r\nlaw and medicine and theology closed their books, the farmer left his\r\nplow in the furrow, the woodsman dropped his ax, the carpenter his\r\nhammer, and the young men of twenty-three States sprang to arms. What\r\nastonished the South most of all was the attitude of Douglas, and the\r\nNorthern Democrats, who had been confidently counted upon to stand by\r\nsecession. One Southern fire-eater had said that \"Douglas and the\r\nDemocrats will fight Lincoln and the Republicans, and it will be another\r\ncase of the Kilkenny cats, leaving the South in peace to build up a\r\ngreat empire.\" But the first thing that Stephen A. Douglas did was to go\r\nto the White House and pledge his support to Lincoln, as did the leading\r\nDemocrats of the North. \"The attack upon Sumter,\" said Douglas, \"leaves\r\nus but two parties--patriots and traitors.\" And now the war was\r\non,--the one side fighting for the Federal Union and liberty for all\r\nmen, and the other side fighting for State sovereignty and slavery.\r\n\r\nThese great events bring us front to front with the question as to how\r\nSouthern men justified their firing upon the old flag and attacking the\r\nUnion. Let us confess that men do not make martyrs of themselves unless\r\nthey have a cause that commands the intellect and conquers the will.\r\n\r\nSkeptics used to say that the apostles invented the character of Jesus.\r\nAs if men first of all invent a lie and inflate a bubble myth, and then\r\ngo out in support of it to get themselves mobbed, kicked through the\r\nstreets, thrown from windows, tortured on the rack, crucified and burned\r\nalive after incredible heroism for thirty years! To say that the\r\ndisciples invented the story of Jesus and then martyred themselves for\r\ntheir falsehood is as intellectually stupid and silly as it is morally\r\nmonstrous! Not otherwise these leading men of the South were men of the\r\nloftiest character, of great personal worth, patriotic, high-minded, and\r\nthey did not devastate their land and martyr themselves for idle\r\nabstractions. Here is John C. Calhoun, ranked by all as one of the\r\ntriumvirate--Webster, Calhoun and Clay. Here is Gen. Robert E. Lee, of\r\nwhom Lord Wolsey said that for one State to have given birth to two such\r\nmen as Washington and Lee was to have lent it immortal renown. Lincoln\r\nand Grant and our Northern generals understood the Southern men,\r\nsympathized with them, and therefore because the intellect grasped their\r\nposition, Grant's heart forgave Lee, and made the two friends. To\r\nunderstand this, go to-day to a great battle-field of that conflict and\r\nhear the Northern generals and the Southern generals rehearse the story\r\nof the Civil War, and you will understand the magnanimity of the\r\nNorthern leader and the argument of the Southern soldier. History has\r\ndestroyed the old delusion that secession was a conspiracy, organized by\r\na few malignant leaders. All historians to-day, Northern and Southern\r\nalike, concede that it was a great popular uprising of the Southern\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was not altogether a contest between Northern blood on the\r\none side, and Southern blood on the other.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one of the Southern generals who fought for the Rebellion were\r\nborn in New York and New England. Eighty distinguished Confederate\r\nofficers were born north of Mason and Dixon's line, were graduates of\r\nWest Point, yet these Northern soldiers rejected Webster's argument for\r\nthe Union, and accepted Calhoun's theory of State sovereignty. On the\r\nother hand, many of our greatest Union leaders were Southern men by\r\nbirth and education, but as Southerners they rejected Calhoun's\r\nphilosophy, and accepted Webster's. Virginia gave us the\r\ncommander-in-chief of our army, Gen. Winfield Scott; gave us George H.\r\nThomas, the Rock of Chickamauga. The South gave us Farragut, our\r\ngreatest admiral. Twelve of the commanders of our battle-ships that\r\ncaptured the Mississippi River and made it possible for Lincoln to say,\r\n\"Once more the Father of Waters goes unvexed to the sea,\" were Southern\r\nmen. The South also, through Kentucky, gave us the great President,\r\nAbraham Lincoln. It was, therefore, in large measure, a philosophic\r\ncontest. The Union forces were the disciples of Daniel Webster, whose\r\nspirit invisible rode upon the wings of the wind, and whose arm bore the\r\ngorgeous ensign, on which were written the words, \"Liberty _and_ Union.\"\r\nOn the other hand, the Confederate forces were made up of the disciples\r\nof John C. Calhoun, who followed a banner on which the great citizen of\r\nSouth Carolina had inscribed these words, \"Sovereignty is natural and\r\ninalienable; government is secondary and artificial and can be changed\r\nat the will of the people.\" In terms of cannon and gun, Grant and Lee\r\nwere the leaders of the two opposing armies, but fundamentally the two\r\narmies were led by Daniel Webster on the one side and John C. Calhoun on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nFurther, Calhoun's influence explains the attitude of the\r\nnon-slaveholding South towards secession. Of the six million white\r\npeople in the South, two millions of them did not own slaves, and most\r\nof these were opposed to the slave traffic. Thousands of Southerners\r\nfreed their slaves before the war, and moved into Ohio and Pennsylvania.\r\nOther thousands declined to participate in the traffic. A North\r\nCarolinian named Hinton Rowan Helper published in 1857 a very striking\r\nvolume called \"The Impending Crisis in the South, and How to Meet It.\"\r\nDedicated to the non-slaveholding whites, and not on behalf of the\r\nblacks, its theme was slavery as a blight upon Southern white people\r\nand their institutions, and a political peril. Not Garrison himself ever\r\nmade so vigorous and powerful an arraignment of slavery as did this\r\nSoutherner. Helper pronounced slavery the enemy of invention, the foe of\r\nmanufacturing plants, an obstacle to the development of the land, a\r\nbarrier to the progress of the sons of white men. He held that slavery\r\nstarves to death masters in the long run, while for the moment it\r\nseemingly enriches them. Slavery was like sin, it wore the garb of an\r\nangel of light; while secretly it sharpened a dagger, with which to stab\r\nto the heart the angel of civilization. Within two years this book sold\r\nover 150,000 copies, and set the whole South in a fever of unrest.\r\nNevertheless, when the storm broke, the large non-slaveholding element\r\nin the South took up arms for the doctrine of State sovereignty. If they\r\nresented interference with slavery, it was because slavery was a\r\nSouthern domestic institution. But this was only an incident; the one\r\nthing they wished was the vindication of the sovereignty of each State\r\nof the Union, and the right of its people to govern themselves without\r\nregard to other States who had the same right of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Southern leaders throws light upon Calhoun's\r\nprinciple. Than Robert E. Lee, what general has been more idolized by\r\nthose who knew him best? His first ancestor in America was a cavalier\r\nwho left England rather than endure the tyranny of Charles II. The son\r\nof \"Light Horse Harry\" of Revolutionary fame, he loved the Union.\r\nEducated at West Point, he left the institution after four years without\r\na demerit, and won distinction both in the army during the Mexican War,\r\nand later as an engineer. He was a man of such probity, purity and lofty\r\ncharacter that his followers loved him to the point of worship. He was\r\ndeeply religious, and the best expression we can use is that Lee,\r\nlike Enoch, walked with God. He was offered the position of\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Northern forces. But he could not bear to lead\r\nan invading army against his old college, his ancestral homestead, and\r\nagainst Washington's house at Mount Vernon, or become the enemy of his\r\nown people in Virginia. On April 17th, Virginia passed her ordinance of\r\nsecession, and on the 20th, Lee resigned his commission in the United\r\nStates army, because he could not take part against his native\r\nState,--\"in whose behalf alone,\" he said, \"will I ever again draw my\r\nsword.\" By the Calhoun doctrine, Virginia was his country, and no one\r\nhas ever doubted his sincerity. Lee is the Sir Philip Sidney of the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nWellington, the Iron Duke, is reported to have said, \"A man of fine\r\nChristian sensibilities is totally unfit for the position of soldier.\"\r\nBut Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. Jackson prayed as they fought; in\r\nvictory and in defeat alike they turned towards God. Jackson, who won\r\nthe name of \"Stonewall,\" might have been the son of old Ironsides\r\nhimself. During his entire career he turned his camps into revival\r\nmeetings when he was on the Potomac and the Rappahannock, and was a\r\nPuritan of Puritans. It is said that literally hundreds of men who\r\nentered his regiments, careless, profane, drinking boys, went home to\r\njoin churches on profession of their faith in Christ. After the battle\r\nof Bull Run, Jackson sent a letter home to his Presbyterian minister at\r\nLexington, Va. The people assembled to hear the minister read the letter\r\nthat would give an account of the conflict. It contained only one\r\nsentence: \"I forgot to send you my contribution for the coloured\r\nSunday-school of which I am superintendent.\" When Jackson lost his left\r\narm, General Lee wrote to him, \"You have lost your left arm, but I have\r\nlost the right arm of my army.\" Eight days after, Jackson lay dying,\r\nhaving been accidentally shot by his own men at Chancellorsville.\r\nSuddenly he cried out, \"Let us cross over the river and rest under the\r\nshade of the trees;\" a companion had just read the great general that\r\nverse in the Psalm, \"There is a river whose streams make glad the city\r\nof God.\" These two men have been a fountain of inspiration to Southern\r\nyouth, and their story makes a bright chapter in the history of all\r\nheroism.\r\n\r\nSouthern leaders there were also who opposed secession as inexpedient\r\nand wrong. One of the finest exponents of this group was Alexander H.\r\nStephens, a self-made man, inured in childhood to hardship, and made\r\nsympathetic through his own struggles. Orphaned at fifteen, he worked\r\nhis way through college; admitted to the bar at twenty-two, he achieved\r\nfame as a lawyer; elected to Congress, he was one of the noted figures\r\nin the House of Representatives for sixteen years. His slight physique\r\nand his frail health were sad handicaps. He was dyspeptic, sleepless, a\r\nnervous wreck. He ordinarily weighed seventy-two pounds, and during the\r\nbest years of his life only ninety-two. When in February, 1865, Lincoln\r\nmet Stephens for a peace conference, he saw the commissioner take off a\r\ngreat outer coat, and unwrap layer after layer of tippet from his\r\nthroat, peeling down and down, until finally there stood this tiny man.\r\nLincoln whispered to his friend, \"Did you ever see so small a nubbin\r\nthat had so much husk on it?\"\r\n\r\nWithin ten days after the election of Lincoln, Stephens began his\r\ncampaign against secession. He urged that Lincoln was friendly to the\r\nSouth; that he had neither the desire nor the power to destroy slavery;\r\nthat John Brown's attack represented the individual and not the millions\r\nof the North; that nothing could be gained by haste nor lost by delay,\r\nand that the Southern people should heed Lincoln's inaugural. Finally,\r\nhe despaired; he wrote Toombs that \"the South was wild with frenzy and\r\npassion--that whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.\" He\r\nafterwards explained his later acquiescence with secession by the\r\nstatement that when two trains were running under full steam towards a\r\nhead-on collision, he got off at the first station.\r\n\r\nAs vice-president of the Confederacy, Stephens was not always in\r\nsympathy with Jefferson Davis; he was very frank in his criticism of the\r\nConfederate leader. \"While I never have regarded Davis as a great man,\r\nor statesman on a large scale, or a man of any marked genius, yet I have\r\nregarded him as a man of good intentions; weak and vacillating, timid,\r\npetulant, peevish, obstinate, but not firm.\"\r\n\r\nTo understand Jefferson Davis, however, we must take a broader outlook.\r\n\r\nRhodes ventures the judgment that if the Pilgrim Fathers had settled in\r\nSouth Carolina they might have held slaves by 1850, and might have\r\nfought to maintain slavery; while if the cavalier had settled in Boston,\r\nwhere the snow and the winter are unfriendly to the coloured man, the\r\ncavalier would have founded abolition societies. If all scholars do not\r\nsee their way clear to fully accept Rhodes' statement, they must confess\r\nthat the Scotch-Irish soldiers that followed Cromwell, and after the\r\nrestoration of Charles II moved to North Carolina, at last became\r\nslave-holders; while many Southerners, young men who were educated in\r\nNorthern colleges and married Northern girls, finally freed their slaves\r\nand moved North, becoming abolitionists. Circumstances, environment, and\r\nassociation, modify men so profoundly that Buckle believed that climate\r\nand grains determine men's civilization.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1820, Northern leaders became alarmed at the invasion by\r\nslavery of the Northern and Western territories, and Northern\r\nrepresentatives threatened to withdraw from the Union if slavery was\r\nextended, just as in 1861 the Southern leaders not only threatened but\r\nwithdrew,--the only difference being this, that the North would rather\r\nwithdraw from the Union than have slavery, while the South preferred to\r\nsecede rather than have free labour enforced.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget that Calhoun's principle of the absolute independence\r\nof each State in political government is freely accepted by all\r\nCongregationalists in church government. In 1875, when a Congregational\r\nAssociation tried to interfere with Mr. Beecher and the government of\r\nPlymouth Church, Plymouth told them plainly that every church is an\r\nindependent and self-governing organization, that sovereignty is\r\nnatural and government artificial, and that government by the\r\nAssociation might be transferred but had not been so transferred. The\r\nCongregational principle in church government is pure democracy.\r\n\r\nBut the United States were a federal representative republic, under a\r\nconstitution; and, to recur again to ecclesiastical illustration, the\r\nPresbyterian form of government is representative and federal. The\r\nPresbyterians base their government on our political institutions. For\r\nthe political township, they have a Presbyterian church; for the county,\r\nthey set up the Presbytery; for the State, they organized a synod; for\r\ncongress, they organized the General Assembly; for the president, they\r\nsubstituted a moderator.\r\n\r\nIn politics we believe in representative government, but as to the\r\nchurch, Congregationalists believe in pure democracy, and the\r\nindependent principle.\r\n\r\nNow John C. Calhoun took this Congregational principle and translated it\r\ninto terms of politics, and called it the States' rights or State\r\nsovereignty theory. If John C. Calhoun had been struggling, not for a\r\npolitical theory, but for an ecclesiastical one, Henry Ward Beecher\r\nwould have backed him to a finish. If there is any one group of people\r\non earth, therefore, who ought not only to understand but to appreciate\r\nJohn C. Calhoun's argument, they are the Independents. Now for twenty\r\nyears John C. Calhoun went up and down the South, analyzing his\r\nargument, explaining and enforcing it. At the very time Northern boys\r\nwere reading in their readers Webster's speech for the Union, Southern\r\nboys were reciting Calhoun's speech for the independence of the States.\r\n\r\nNot in consequence of the Calhoun doctrine but in harmony with it,\r\nhaving always held that the Union was subordinate to the sovereignty of\r\nthe States, Jefferson Davis, United States senator from Mississippi,\r\nbecame the chief organizer of secession after Lincoln's election. A West\r\nPoint graduate, a brilliant officer in Indian fights and the Mexican\r\nWar, a governor of Mississippi, United States senator, a singularly\r\nefficient Secretary of War under President Pierce, and again an\r\ninfluential senator, a man of charming personality with many friends,\r\nMr. Davis was so prominent in the secession movement that he was the\r\nfree choice of the Southern people for president of their Confederacy.\r\nAnd, despite Mr. Stephens' opinion, he probably did as well in that\r\ndifficult place as another could have done. To the end of his life he\r\nheld to the doctrine of State sovereignty.\r\n\r\nBut one question persistently forces itself into the foreground. Why was\r\nit that the people of the North did not \"let the erring sisters go,\" to\r\nuse Horace Greeley's expression? Just across the Northern line dwells\r\nanother nation--Canada. Why should there not have been a second nation\r\nto the south of Mason and Dixon's line, with Mobile or New Orleans for a\r\ncapital--a great slave empire, that would have included Texas, Mexico\r\nand Central America? The answer is very simple. The Constitution stood\r\nin the way. Men saw clearly that if this republic, conceived in liberty\r\nand dedicated to the proposition that all men were created equal, could\r\nbe destroyed by the minority, that would not respect the rights of the\r\nmajority, there was no hope for civilization save in the revival of\r\ndespotism, with a monarch ruling the people by military force. The North\r\nby a majority of States and votes had chosen Lincoln, with his statement\r\nthat the Union could not permanently endure, half slave and half free.\r\nThe minority then answered: \"If we cannot have our way, we will destroy\r\nthe government.\" Analyzed, this is seen to be sheer anarchy.\r\n\r\nIn that hour men remembered what their fathers had endured to found the\r\nRepublic and free institutions. When the news came of the attack upon\r\nFort Sumter, the better angels of men's natures did touch \"the mystic\r\nchords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and patriot grave\r\nto every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land,\" and the\r\ntones swelled the chorus of the Union. What other land offered poor men\r\nan opportunity for office, wealth and honours, with full liberty of\r\nthought and speech? Had not the fathers lived and died to make education\r\ndemocratic through the public schools? Had not the fathers given life\r\nitself to establish the freedom of the printing-press and freedom of\r\ndiscussion? Had not the fathers bought at great price their political\r\nliberty, and the rights of the ballot? Was not the land dedicated to\r\ntoleration and charity in religion? Was the work of Washington and\r\nJefferson and Hamilton to go down in ruin and nothingness? While the old\r\nworld, with her tyrannies, scoffed at the failure of the Republic, men\r\nthought of Bunker Hill and Valley Forge and Yorktown. They thought of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. They recalled the\r\ntribute of one of the greatest of English statesmen, who characterized\r\nthe American Constitution as \"the greatest political instrument ever\r\nstruck off by the unaided genius of man.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the Republic was to be destroyed, the Constitution torn into\r\nshreds and stamped under foot, the Declaration of Independence made a\r\nthing of jibes and scorn in the palaces of Madrid and Constantinople,\r\nwhile slavery, with black fingers, was to knit its claws into the throat\r\nof the angel of liberty and choke the life out. Suddenly men saw that\r\nthe only way to insure liberty for the white race was to destroy slavery\r\nfor the black races. Men determined that the majority had their rights,\r\nand that these rights should not be wrested away by the minority,\r\nfighting in the interests of slavery. Democracy, the \"last, best hope of\r\nearth,\" should not fail! In that moment Liberty stretched forth her\r\nsceptre of justice, \"red with insufferable wrath,\" and her clarion voice\r\nrang to the outermost corners of the land. Three millions of men\r\nassembled to swear fealty to God and country. Then they marched away,\r\nthrough the towns and across the prairies, into thickets and swamps, to\r\nbe pierced by bullets, torn by shells, to eat crusts, wear rags, shiver\r\nin the cold, burn in the heat, famish in the prison, welter in the\r\nbloody trench, above them a fiery hail, beside them their dying comrades\r\nfalling into the arms of death. It is a strange, wild, chivalrous,\r\ndivine story of the world's greatest enthusiasm, our fathers' enthusiasm\r\nfor liberty and democracy! What God thinks of freedom, is written in the\r\nprice that people paid for it! What God thinks of slavery is in the woe\r\nand sorrow and wreckage it has always brought upon those who have sought\r\nto live on the sweat of other men's faces!\r\n\r\nThe Russian would not fight against the Japanese because the Russian\r\npeasant owned no lands, had no schoolhouse, no ballot box, no free\r\nprinting-press, no religious liberty. The Russian stood sullenly in the\r\ntrenches and had to be flogged into the battle. If the Russian peasant\r\nlost, he lost nothing, because he had nothing to lose; if the peasant\r\nwon, he gained nothing, because the Russian aristocrat and the baron\r\ntook all of the treasure; therefore he would not fight. But the Northern\r\nsoldier had everything to fight for. No such treasures were ever thrown\r\non the earth to be struggled for. Liberty and the Union were worth a\r\nthousand lives and ten thousand deaths.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful and a gallant fight, waged by the finest of the world's\r\nmanhood on both sides. The Southerner fought for local self-government\r\nand the right to enslave and govern other men; the Northerner fought for\r\nuniversal self-government and the institutions which had made that\r\npossible without injustice to other men. There can be no choice as\r\nbetween the splendid qualities that entered into the contest--of\r\nsincerity, earnestness, devotion and fidelity on either side: but the\r\nSouth lost because slavery had eaten out the enduring vigour of its\r\nresources; the North won because free labour and the rights of man had\r\ngiven it the greater effective power. At last, the theory on which the\r\nSouth stood for self-justification crumbled under the supreme test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nHENRY WARD BEECHER: THE APPEAL TO ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOne November morning in the White House, Abraham Lincoln kept his\r\nCabinet waiting while he finished reading a newspaper, containing an\r\naccount of Beecher's speeches in England. At last he laid the paper on\r\nthe table before them, and in substance said to Stanton, \"When this war\r\nis fought to a successful issue, this man, Henry Ward Beecher, will have\r\nearned the right to lift the old flag back to its place on Fort Sumter,\r\nfor without these speeches England might have recognized the\r\nConfederacy, and then there might have been no flag to raise.\"\r\n\r\nLong time has passed since that Friday morning in the capital, and now\r\nall men recognize the justice of the words of the martyred President.\r\nHistory is a stern judge, and the centuries have given opportunity for\r\ncontrast. When a great country, a great emergency, a critical hour, and\r\na great man meet, a spark is struck out, called great eloquence. Such a\r\nconjunction of city, peril and man once met in Athens, and for\r\ntwenty-four centuries boys have been translating Demosthenes' oration\r\nagainst Philip. Demosthenes spoke, but Philip marched on. Greece bowed\r\nher neck to the yoke, and became subject to Macedonia; Demosthenes\r\nfailed. Another crisis came in Westminster Hall, in London, when Edmund\r\nBurke made his plea for the millions of outraged folk in India pillaged\r\nby Warren Hastings. But Hastings became a lord; he died honoured in his\r\npalace; India was left to stagger onward; Burke's splendid oratory\r\nfailed. That was a great hour in the history of eloquence when Patrick\r\nHenry and Fisher Ames and Josiah Quincy became voices for liberty and\r\nthe new republic. But these orators spoke to sympathetic hearers, and\r\nsimply returned to the multitude in a flood what they had received from\r\nthe people in dew and rain.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher spoke to mobs, pleaded with unfriendly critics, and\r\nwas asked to change hate to love, ice to fire, weapons for attack into\r\nweapons for defense. He went against the English mob as one goes up\r\nagainst a castle that is locked, barred and bristling with arms, and he\r\ngave sops to Cerberus, charmed the keys out of him who kept the fortress\r\ngate, cast a spell upon those who guarded the walls, stole all the\r\nweapons, and, single handed, at last lifted the banner of victory above\r\nthe ramparts of granite. The history of eloquence holds no other\r\nachievement of the same rank and class. What a volume, that contains the\r\nspeech delivered within the limit of nine days, with the introduction at\r\nManchester, the three great arguments at Glasgow, Edinburgh and\r\nLiverpool, and the peroration in Exeter Hall, London! What physical\r\nreserves as the basis of sustained public speech! What mastery of all\r\nthe facts of liberty and democracy, not less than slavery! What\r\nfamiliarity with English law not less than American! The orator moves\r\nacross the scene in history like some refulgent planet in the sky. The\r\nstory of those nine wonderful days makes illustrious forever the history\r\nof eloquence and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1862 and '63, with its high-wrought excitements, brought\r\nBeecher the peril of a nervous breakdown. His exhaustion illustrates the\r\nfact that some men who stayed at home endured as much as others who\r\nwent to the front. Generals and their marching regiments often suffered\r\nmuch, but they were not alone in their fortitude and faith. Women who\r\ntoiled on farm or in hospital, working men who laboured to support the\r\nboys at the front, orators who went up and down the land inciting\r\npatriotism in the people, preachers who realized that the breakdown of\r\nconscience meant the breakdown of the cause--these all were citizen\r\nsoldiers who defended the Union and kept the faith.\r\n\r\nAmong them all no man poured out his life more generously than Henry\r\nWard Beecher. Since 1850, through the intensities of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, the Fremont campaign, the Kansas troubles, the Lincoln election,\r\nthe era of secession and the first two years of the war, he had been\r\npreaching, writing, lecturing, making public addresses, attending to his\r\ngreat pastorate, and active in every civic and national interest. And\r\nduring the war, back and forth, across the land, from city to city, in\r\nchurch, hall and armoury, he lifted up his voice in the presence of\r\nmultitudes, telling the story of the founding of the Republic, showing\r\nthat the Republic, with its self-government, was the last, best hope of\r\nman, reminding boys that they must fight and live for the Union that\r\ntheir fathers had died to found. When at length Antietam was won, and\r\nLincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, and the rebellion\r\nstaggered like a giant stunned by a crushing blow, Beecher was lifted\r\ninto the seventh heaven of hope, and had the vision of coming victory.\r\nIn that hour he told his people that he was ready to die, that God might\r\npeel him, and strip away all the leaves of life, and do with him as He\r\npleased; that he had lived fifty years, that he had had a good time,\r\nthat he had \"hit the devil many blows and square in the face, that it\r\nwas joy enough to have uttered some words because they were incorporated\r\ninto the lives of men and could not die.\"\r\n\r\nBut we all know that it is possible to stretch the strings of the mental\r\nharp too tightly. Excitement burns the nerve as an electric current\r\nconsumes a wire. During those days Beecher wore a garment whose warp and\r\nwoof was fiery enthusiasm, and fierce flaming patriotism. The human body\r\nis like a cask of precious liquor. One way to drain off the treasure is\r\nto knock out the bung-hole, and in a few minutes drain the rich\r\nfountain dry; another way is to bore innumerable apertures, that drop by\r\ndrop the liquor may waste. And so it was with Beecher, during those\r\nexciting days, with this difference, that sometimes it seemed as if one\r\ngreat event would drain out all his life in a tumultuous flood, while at\r\nthe same time innumerable petitioners taxed his life, drawing away his\r\nstrength, drop by drop. Alarmed, the officers and friends in Plymouth\r\nChurch insisted upon rest and vacation. They determined to put the sea\r\nbetween the preacher and his task, planning to lose him for a little\r\ntime that they might have him for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe popular opinion is that Beecher went to England, not openly, but\r\nsecretly as a messenger of the government. Like other myths, the fable\r\ngrew slowly, but is now well entrenched in the minds of multitudes.\r\nThere is no foundation for the story. Indeed, Mr. Beecher is on record\r\nplainly, stating that no request, no suggestion, no hint, even, came\r\nfrom Washington. At the time, his relations with the Cabinet were\r\nstrained. Seward was unfriendly. Stanton was hurt by his insistence,\r\nthrough the _Independent_, upon immediate emancipation. For a time even\r\nLincoln classed him with Horace Greeley, as extremist. His editorials\r\nduring the spring of 1862 had one thought, \"Carthago delenda est.\" It\r\nwas only after Lincoln came around by a gunboat into New York Harbour,\r\nand secretly met General Winfield Scott in a friend's house, and had\r\nanother secret interview with Henry Ward Beecher, and returned (letters\r\nexist from Secretary Hay, following an interview with him over the\r\nrecords in Washington, which establish this trip to New York to see\r\nScott and Beecher), that Beecher changed the tone of his editorials, and\r\nwent over to Lincoln's position,--that the Union was first, and the\r\ndestruction of slavery the secondary thing. The Great Emancipator loved\r\nand trusted Beecher, but the Cabinet was critical, and Lincoln, as he\r\nsaid, \"did not have much influence with the administration.\"\r\n\r\nThe only power and the whole power behind Beecher was that of Plymouth\r\nChurch, that gave him the money for all of his expenses, and took from\r\nhim a pledge that if he spoke at all he was to speak at their expense,\r\nbut under no circumstances to either preach or lecture until he had\r\nrecovered his strength. He was ill during the entire voyage, and was\r\nnot able to appear on deck until the vessel entered the Mersey. The news\r\nof Beecher's coming had preceded him, and on opening the papers he found\r\neven church leaders antagonistic. They deplored his coming, lest he\r\nincrease the excitement. The nobility was in favour of the South, as\r\nwere the ship-builders, the mill-owners, the bankers and all who had\r\ninvestments or loans in the cotton industry of England and of the South.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty Congregational ministers greeted Beecher with a\r\nbreakfast in London. They asked him to preach and speak on religious\r\ntopics, but to avoid all reference to slavery on account of the inflamed\r\ncondition of the English mind. The man who introduced him deplored the\r\nwar, and described the patience of God in permitting the North to go on.\r\nWhen Beecher arose to speak he was in a towering rage. He told them that\r\nhe would neither preach nor lecture nor speak in a mother land that was\r\nopenly hostile to her own daughter, and unfriendly to every principle of\r\nliberty that was dear to England and embedded in English tradition and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn substance, he said: \"Your conscience here in England is very\r\nsensitive on the subject of war, providing some one else is fighting the\r\nwar, but England has no conscience at all as to war when she is\r\nprosecuting the campaign.\" At that very hour England was fighting a war\r\nin Japan, and a war in China, and a war in New Zealand for territory.\r\nThree wars being quite proper, if England fought them, but oh, the\r\npatience of God in permitting the North to exist even for one moment,\r\nwhile fighting for liberty, the Union and the emancipation of slaves! He\r\ntold them that they thought it was a crime for the North to have a war\r\nfor emancipation, but quite proper for England to threaten a war over\r\ntwo men named Mason and Slidell! Beecher understood Old England. No\r\nnation in history ever conducted so many wars. No other nation's\r\nstatesmen ever had such skill to invent moral excuses for seizing\r\nterritory, in Africa, Egypt, India, Thibet, Australia, New Zealand and\r\nall the islands of the sea. He best described it in his final speech in\r\nLondon, when returned from the Continent: \"On what shore has not the\r\nprow of your ships dashed? What land is there with a name and a people\r\nwhere your banner has not led your soldiers? And when the great\r\n_reveillé_ shall sound, it will muster British soldiers from every clime\r\nand people under the whole heaven.\" What? \"Speak in England on religion\r\nand keep still on slavery, and the North and the South?\" When an engine\r\nis full of steam, it is a bad thing to sit on its safety-valve.\r\nFiguratively speaking, the chairman and the hundred and fifty ministers,\r\nwho were trying to get Beecher to speak on religion and keep still on\r\nslavery, sat passively and serenely on the safety-valve for about five\r\nminutes, but finally the engine blew up. Mr. Beecher was not the man to\r\nstifle his convictions in the name of peace, for he knew that in an evil\r\nworld a good man has no right to dwell at peace with the devil and his\r\nminions. So he declared his hostility, turned his back on England, and\r\nwent to the Continent; and thus ended the first chapter in the European\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nLooking backward, it is easy to discover the explanation of England's\r\nattitude towards slavery and the Southern leaders. During the early\r\nforties England had herself passed through an industrial revolution.\r\nBecause she had little agricultural land, and thirty millions of\r\npeople, the cost of living was high. When the cry of the people for\r\nbread became bitter, Cobden, Bright and their associates inaugurated and\r\ncarried through the Free Corn Movement. With the incoming of free raw\r\nmaterials England became the great manufacturing centre. What her\r\nfarmers lost through free trade in selling grain they gained in the\r\nlowered price on which they bought. Within ten years after the victory\r\nof free trade England became a hive of industry, filled with clustering\r\ncities, while the whole land resounded with the stroke of engines.\r\nAbundance succeeded to poverty and work trod closely upon the heels of\r\nwant. So prosperous had England become that by 1860 she was importing\r\ntwo million bales of cotton from Southern States. The shipyards of\r\nGlasgow built ships to carry cotton, the bankers in London made loans to\r\nSouthern planters, the mill-owners in Manchester bought shares in the\r\nSouthern cotton fields. The rich men of the South were constant guests\r\nof the mill-owners in Central England and of the bankers in London.\r\nLittle by little England was drawn in through financial channels, and\r\ncast her lot in with the production of cotton,--and slavery.\r\n\r\nThen came the Civil War. The planters went to the front with Lee's army;\r\nthe slaves freed from overseers would not work. The production of cotton\r\nwas halved. The Northern navy blockaded the exit of cotton ships from\r\nthe Southern ports. English ships hung around the Southern shores trying\r\nin vain to find access, hoping to run the gauntlet and obtain a cargo of\r\ncotton. One by one the great English mills shut down for want of raw\r\nmaterial, and when two winters had passed, and the autumn of 1863 had\r\ncome, and the English working people fronted a third winter, the\r\nspectacle became pathetic and terrible. Gaunt Famine stalked the land.\r\nThe skeleton Want stood in the shadow of the poor man's house. But the\r\ncourage and fidelity of the English cotton spinners held out for two\r\nyears. The poor always love the poor. The classes have always been\r\nwrong, the masses have always been right. Luxury puts wax into the ears\r\nof the aristocrats, but want makes the hearing of the poor very\r\nsensitive to a sob of pain. The sympathy of the cotton spinner was with\r\nthe Northern working man. An English working man did not want to be put\r\nin the same class with a Southern slave. He saw that any law that\r\nriveted fetters on black slaves in the South helped forge a manacle for\r\nthe cotton spinner's wrist in the mother land. These poor English folk\r\nbelieved in the dignity of labour, in the right to a good wage, and in\r\nthe necessity for all working people standing together.\r\n\r\nBut the mill-owner wanted raw cotton. The banker wanted the mill-owner\r\nto have his cotton that his loans might be paid. The ship-builders\r\nwanted Southern cotton that their industry might thrive. Investors who\r\nfor two years had had no interest on their Southern loans sympathized\r\nwith the South; the politicians, controlled by their financial\r\ninterests, wanted the South to succeed. In that hour of temptation\r\nAvarice drew near and choked Justice. Greed offered bribes to\r\nConscience. Old England's ruling classes, with the full sympathy of men\r\nlike Gladstone and hundreds of others, favoured the speedy recognition\r\nof the Southern Confederacy in the hope that that would end the war and\r\nrestore England's prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the situation was this: The North had to fight the South, and\r\nEngland with her influence as well. For here was the North, struggling\r\nfor the principles of the Pilgrim Fathers, for liberty, for democracy\r\nand for the slaves, and just in the darkest hour of the struggle, when\r\nshe was burying her dead and the whole North was hung with funeral\r\ncrape, England, with ships on every sea, England, strong and powerful,\r\ntaking advantage of the capture of two Southern emissaries--Mason and\r\nSlidell--from the British ship _Trent_ on the high seas, declared she\r\nwould send an army to Canada and ships to batter down our Northern\r\ncities. Even Gladstone bought Southern bonds, but later Gladstone deeply\r\nlamented his sympathy with slavery and the South, and asked the world to\r\nforgive and forget it. Yet if the North has long ago forgiven England,\r\nit must be a hard thing for England to forgive herself that she gave to\r\nslavery every ounce of influence she had, her threats, her frowns, her\r\ndiplomacy and her ships. Long afterwards a court of arbitration in\r\nGeneva punished England with an enormous fine for the American shipping\r\nthat she helped destroy in her effort to help break down the North and\r\ndefeat liberty in a war that her own statesman, John Bright, has\r\ncharacterized as one of the few wars not only justifiable but glorious\r\nin all history.\r\n\r\nNow this was the attitude of England. Her upper classes and financial\r\ninterests were all on the side of slavery and the South. Her great\r\nmiddle class were largely in favour of liberty. Her working people were\r\nnaturally on the side of free labour and the North, but they were\r\nweakened by starvation till their endurance and fortitude were almost\r\ngone. And then it was that Beecher entered the scene, returning from the\r\nContinent to England. Recognition of the Confederacy and other\r\nunfriendly official acts were trembling in the balance; yet there was\r\nhesitation, on account of the common people, who sympathized with the\r\nNorth. In telling of this afterwards, Mr. Beecher said: \"To my amazement\r\nI found that the unvoting English possessed great power in England; a\r\ngreat deal more power, in fact, than if they had a vote. The aristocracy\r\nand the government felt, 'These men know they have no political\r\nprivileges, and we must administer with the strictest regard to their\r\nfeelings or there will be a revolution.'\" There were many noble\r\nexceptions among the higher classes, and the Queen, doubtless under the\r\ninfluence of the Prince Consort Albert, who died in 1861, and had been\r\na firm friend of America, was also friendly to the North; but her\r\nGovernment was not.\r\n\r\nThe argument finally used to persuade Beecher to speak was that the\r\nEnglish Anti-Slavery Society was already discredited, unpopular, and\r\nfrowned upon by the nobility and the upper classes, and that if Beecher\r\nwould not recognize them by at least one speech their cause and ours\r\nwould be still further weakened.\r\n\r\nHe began his work with a speech at Manchester, the very centre of the\r\ncotton spinning industry. For weeks the streets had been placarded\r\nagainst him. On his way to the Free Trade Hall he found, not a\r\nmultitude, but a mob, filling the streets. The meeting had been packed\r\nin advance. Within five minutes after his introduction the storm let\r\nloose its fury. There were two or three centres of conflict that became\r\nveritable whirlpools of excitement. All the rest of the audience climbed\r\non their chairs to see what was going on in the tumultuous centres.\r\nEverybody seemed to be yelling, some for order, and others with the\r\npurpose of breaking up the meeting. Mr. Beecher saw that many were\r\ndetermined that he should not speak, and he realized that if they broke\r\nhim down, other cities would withdraw their invitation, and it would\r\nappear that all England was unalterably opposed to the North, so that\r\nthe recognition of the Confederacy might follow. When his enemies began\r\nto wear themselves out and the tumult to subside, Mr. Beecher shot a few\r\nsentences into the noise. \"I have registered a vow that I will not leave\r\nyour country until I have spoken in your great cities. I am going to be\r\nheard, and my country shall be vindicated.\"\r\n\r\nThe orator soon found that about one-quarter of the audience were\r\nbitterly hostile. Another quarter applauded his sentiment. The great\r\nmass was hesitant, undecided, unconvinced, and he determined to conquer\r\nthat undecided class, and add them to that portion that was friendly. He\r\nscornfully reminded them that he had before met men whose cause could\r\nnot bear the light of free speech. He roused them by saying that\r\nAmerican institutions were the fruit of English ideas, and that the\r\nfruit of American liberty was from seed corn that was English.\r\n\r\nWhen some one shouted that he was harsh and unfair, he answered, What if\r\nsome exquisite dancing master should stand on the edge of a\r\nbattle-field where a hero lifted his battle-axe, and criticize him by\r\nsaying that \"his gestures and postures violated the proprieties of\r\npolite life!\" He added, \"When dandies fight they think how they look;\r\nwhen men fight, they think only of deeds.\" He said that what the North\r\ndesired was not material aid, but simply that England should keep hands\r\noff, and that France should keep hands off. He affirmed that even if\r\nthey both interfered, the North would fight on, that slavery must be\r\ndestroyed, and that liberty must be established on the American\r\ncontinent; that the victory of democracy and liberty in the North would\r\nmean their victory over the North and South American continent, and that\r\nif the day ever should come when the old flag should wave again over\r\nevery state in the South, and the atrocious crime of slavery should be\r\ndestroyed, there should be liberty for the press, and liberty for the\r\npoor in the schoolhouse; if plantations should be broken up and\r\ndistributed among the poor farmers, and the privileges of civil liberty\r\nbe won, that it would be worth all the blood and tears and woe.\r\n\r\nWhen he said that Great Britain had frowned upon the North, but hastened\r\nto fling her arms around the neck of the imperious South, one\r\nEnglishman waved his arms and shouted: \"She doesn't!\" and the six\r\nthousand people began to cheer the disclaimer of England's being Romeo.\r\nTo which Beecher answered: \"I have only to say that she has been caught\r\nin very suspicious circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nBeecher's unshakable good humour, his witty, lightning-like answers to\r\ntheir questions and contradictions, his solid sense and--when he got the\r\nchance--his flaming eloquence, finally quelled and captured them. Then\r\nhe traversed the entire history of slavery in its relation to the\r\nColonies, the States, and the different forms of legislation up to the\r\nKansas and Nebraska Bill. When he concluded his speech, and the\r\nsentiment of the audience was called for, to the astonishment of his\r\nfriends, men lifted up their voices with a sound like the sound of many\r\nwaters, and lined up for the North and liberty. The enthusiasm was\r\noverwhelming. Within three hours January's frost had turned to the bloom\r\nof June, and the moment was radiant with hope. The London _Times_\r\ncontained four columns of this speech, and the address became the topic\r\nof the hour in every club in England. And either of these facts in\r\nthose days meant that Henry Ward Beecher was famous in England.\r\n\r\nHis speeches in Glasgow and Edinburgh took up the second and third steps\r\nin the development of slavery and liberty on the American continent. He\r\ntold these ship-builders in Glasgow how the providence of God seemed to\r\nbe exhibiting to all the peoples of the world the reflex influence of\r\nslavery upon the strongest people and the richest resources, and how\r\nslavery cursed whatever it touched. That the lesson might be the clearer\r\nHe gave liberty an unfriendly clime, and gave slavery a rich arena. To\r\nthe North He gave short summers, bleak skies, the rocks of New England\r\nhills, the thin soil of New York, the sand dunes of Michigan. To the\r\nSouth He gave sunny Virginia, the riches of the Gulf States, the\r\nfruitful skies, the abundant rains, the treasures of the cotton, the\r\nsugar and the rice. Above all, God sifted all the nations of the Old\r\nWorld to find blood rich enough to people the Southern States. The men\r\nwho laid the foundations of the great South were people of a heroic\r\ntype, giants and heroes of fortitude. God brought the Huguenots, and\r\nthe very flower of French chivalry into Florida and Georgia. He sifted\r\nall Scotland and North Ireland for outstanding men for South Carolina.\r\nHe took the best blood of England for Virginia. These Southern founders\r\nand fathers had fought in France, endured for their convictions in\r\nScotland, conquered their enemies in England and North Ireland, and God\r\nrewarded them with the richest, choicest meadows and valleys of the\r\nsunny South. And yet Slavery wrought weakness, while Liberty made the\r\nbleak North to blossom like the rose.\r\n\r\nIt is said that plants exude poison from the roots, and soon destroy the\r\nsoil unless there is a rotation of crops. Slavery was a noxious plant,\r\ndeadlier than the nightshade, and it poisoned the South. The longer\r\nslavery existed, the weaker the Southern giant became, until, toiling\r\non, the South became bankrupt through slavery, and toiling on, every\r\nyear of the war under free labour found the North growing ever richer\r\nand stronger. Liberty is a giant that when it touches the soil renews\r\nits strength.\r\n\r\nOh, if the South had but had a better cause! History affords nothing\r\nfiner than the bravery of Southern soldiers and their leaders; had they\r\nbeen fighting for liberty, or some great cause that would have supported\r\nthem during the struggle instead of bankrupting them as slavery did, it\r\nis doubtful whether any army could have defeated their soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn Liverpool Beecher literally fought with the lions of Ephesus. The\r\nbill-boards were posted with placards in red type. All men in England\r\nwho had investments in the South and wanted to break Beecher and his\r\ncause seemed to have assembled. From the moment he entered the room the\r\ngreat audience became a mob, and with groans, hisses, cat-calls,\r\nepithets, men interrupted the orator with cheers for the South. Speaking\r\nwas like lifting up one's voice in the midst of a hurricane, or trying\r\nto speak while a typhoon was raging on the sea. For one hour the tumult\r\nraged. From time to time the police would succeed in carrying out some\r\nobstreperous individual but there were enough men scattered through the\r\nhall, each bellowing like a bull of Bashan, to make hearing impossible.\r\nTo add to the tumult, from time to time, an Englishman would climb on\r\nhis chair and shout, \"I am ashamed of Liverpool and my country,\" and the\r\nconfusion would break out afresh. It took one hour to wear the voices\r\nout. When Beecher told the reporters that he would speak slowly so they\r\ncould hear, and thus he could reach all England, the audience grew\r\nquieter.\r\n\r\nBeecher urged three arguments,--first, that the national prosperity is\r\ndependent upon the production of wealth, and this meant independence for\r\nthe producer; second, that prosperity depends upon manufacturing and\r\nthat means a high quality of educated workman; third, that prosperity is\r\ndependent upon commerce and the exchange of commodities between nations,\r\nand that means brotherhood. He urged that the more intelligent and\r\nprosperous the workman, the higher his wage, and, therefore, the better\r\nhe supports as a buyer. A slave uses his feet and hands, and produces a\r\nfew cents a day. A poor white labourer uses his hands and his lower\r\nhead, and earns fifty cents a day. An intelligent Northern working man\r\nuses his hands and his creative intellect, and he produces a dollar a\r\nday. A highly educated worker becomes an inventor as well as a freeman,\r\nand earns five dollars a day. With this wage he buys comforts, tools,\r\nproducts of the loom, builds up manufactures, and promotes prosperity.\r\nFor that reason a few patricians only in the South buy in the English\r\nmarket, while the millions of slaves demand from Sheffield only whips\r\nand manacles. Therefore slavery starves English trade.--And at last\r\nLiverpool heard him.\r\n\r\nIn Exeter Hall in London, Beecher closed his argument: \"Shall we let the\r\nSouth go, and carry slavery with her? If a Northern working man has a\r\nmad dog by the throat shall he let that animal go to spread death?\r\nLetting the South go as a free nation is one thing, but letting her go\r\nto spread slavery over Mexico and Central America is another thing. When\r\nwe kill the mad dog we will talk about letting the South go.\"\r\n\r\nBeecher returned home to find himself the hero of the hour. In Plymouth\r\nChurch, on Sunday morning, the audience stood for five minutes, and with\r\ntheir tears and silence told him of their gratitude and love. From that\r\nhour Stanton asked for his friendship, and was weekly and even daily in\r\ncorrespondence. He promised Beecher that immediately upon the receipt of\r\nany news from the battle-field he would send him a telegram. Indeed, the\r\nfirst news that the country had from Stanton of one of the great\r\nvictories came to Beecher's pulpit and was read over his desk. Other\r\ngreat men, the President, secretaries, the generals, the statesmen,\r\neditors, lecturers, preachers, did their part, but high among co-workers\r\nranks Henry Ward Beecher. God gave him a great task, and armed him for\r\nthe battle. He loved the poor, he broke the shackles from the slave, he\r\ndiscovered to the world the love of God, and dying he flung his helmet\r\ninto the thick of the enemy. It is for us and our children to fight our\r\nway forward to that helmet, and fling our own at last into some new\r\nfight for the emancipation of the mind and heart of earth's troubled\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the aristocracy of England and her upper\r\nmiddle class, in the main, still sympathized with the South, while the\r\nEnglish cabinet tried to maintain neutrality. Four-fifths of the House\r\nof Lords were \"no well-wishers of anything American, and most of the\r\nHouse of Commons voted in sympathy with the South.\"\r\n\r\nBut the attitude of the \"classes\" of England was only the reflection of\r\nher scholars. Carlyle, whose early books had no sale in England, and who\r\nwrote Emerson that he had received his first money to keep him from\r\nstarvation from Boston and New York, \"when not a penny had been realized\r\nin England,\" had no sympathy with liberty and the North. As soon as his\r\nown physical wants were supplied by the American check which Emerson\r\nsent him, Carlyle began to call the war \"a smoky chimney that had taken\r\nfire.\" \"No war ever waged in my time was to me more profoundly foolish\r\nlooking.\" (Slovenly English, contradictory thinking, and poor morals!)\r\n\"Neutral I am to a degree.\" Then Carlyle tried to sum up his view of the\r\nsituation: \"Now speaks the Northern Peter to the Southern Paul: 'Paul,\r\nyou unaccountable scoundrel! I find you hire your servants for life, not\r\nby the month or year as I do. You are going straight to hell.' Paul:\r\n'Good words, Peter; the risk is my own. Hire you your servants by the\r\nmonth or day, and go straight to heaven. Leave me to my own method.'\r\nPeter: 'No, I won't. I will beat your brains out.' And he's trying\r\ndreadfully ever since, but cannot quite manage it.\"\r\n\r\nNo one knew better than Carlyle that there is a world diameter between\r\nthe South hiring a man for life, and by force holding him in slavery.\r\nBut Carlyle for three years poured out such vapid humbug, cant and\r\nhypocrisy as this, and never once was sound in his thinking or fair in\r\nhis view-point during the entire war.\r\n\r\nEven Charles Dickens, who had written denouncing slavery in his\r\n\"American Notes,\" returned to England in the spring of 1863 to predict\r\nthe overwhelming victory of the South, and to characterize the hopes of\r\nLincoln as \"a harmless hallucination.\" But little by little, English\r\nsentiment began to change. Goldwin Smith, of Oxford University,\r\nconsented to speak at a meeting in Manchester to protest against the\r\nbuilding and sending out of piratical ships in support of the Southern\r\nConfederacy. He affirmed boldly that \"no nation ever inflicted upon\r\nanother more flagrant or more maddening wrong\" [in permitting the\r\n_Alabama_ to escape]. No nation with English blood in its veins had ever\r\nborne such a wrong without resentment.\r\n\r\nRichard Cobden wrote to Mr. Beecher as to the feeling in England: \"In\r\nevery other instance ... the popular sympathy of this country has always\r\nleaped to the side of the insurgents the moment a rebellion has broken\r\nout. In the present case, our masses have an instinctive feeling that\r\ntheir cause is bound up in the prosperity of the United States. It is\r\ntrue that they have not much power in the direct form of a vote; but\r\nwhen the millions of this country are led by the religious middle class\r\nthey can together prevent the government from pursuing a policy hostile\r\nto their sympathies.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Beecher appeared and spoke, he aroused, intensified, unified, and\r\nmade effective this great underlying force of English popular feeling,\r\nand the unfriendly purposes of the governmental and \"upper-class\"\r\nelement were paralyzed.\r\n\r\nBeecher himself was very modest about his achievement. Said he: \"When in\r\nOctober you go to a tree and give it a jar, and the fruit rains down all\r\nabout you, it is not you that ripened and sent down the fruit; the whole\r\nsummer has been doing that. It was my good fortune to be there when it\r\nwas needed that some one should jar the tree; the fruit was not of my\r\nripening.\"\r\n\r\nBeecher returned home in November of 1863, conscious that he had risked\r\neverything in the service of his imperilled country. He found the entire\r\nNorth had constituted itself a Committee of Reception to welcome him\r\nhome. A great public meeting was arranged in the Academy of Music in New\r\nYork, and the Music Hall was crowded from pit to dome with the leaders\r\nof the city and of the North. Mr. Beecher entered the room at eight\r\no'clock, and the whole audience rose to its feet to greet him, but not\r\nuntil many minutes had passed in tumultuous cheering did he have an\r\nopportunity to speak. From that hour his influence in the country was\r\nsecond only to that of the President, two or three members of his\r\ncabinet, and General Grant. Abraham Lincoln wrote to Mr. Beecher words\r\nof warmest gratitude and invited him to the White House. \"Often and\r\noften,\" wrote Secretary Stanton, \"in the dark hours you have come to me,\r\nand I have longed to hear your voice, feeling that above all other men\r\nyou could cheer, strengthen, quiet and uplift me in this great battle,\r\nwhere by God's providence it has fallen upon me to hold a part, and\r\nperform a duty beyond my own strength.\" When therefore Lee surrendered,\r\nand the war came to a close, President Lincoln and the cabinet felt that\r\nBeecher's service to the cause of liberty had earned for him the most\r\nunique distinction granted to any man during the war. And so it came\r\nabout that four years after Beauregard fired upon Fort Sumter, and the\r\nflag of the Union was lowered to give place to the flag of Secession,\r\nthat not a general nor an admiral, but that a minister, Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, was selected to lift into its place again the old flag, that\r\nproclaimed to all the nations of the earth that government of the\r\npeople, by the people and for the people, shall not perish from the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nHEROES OF BATTLE: AMERICAN SOLDIERS AND SAILORS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the wariest and most capable of the Confederate commanders was\r\nGeneral Joseph E. Johnston. In his report of the battle of Kenesaw\r\nMountain in Northwestern Georgia, in June, 1864, when Sherman had at\r\nlast driven him to bay, he thus describes the attack and the repulse:\r\n\"The Federal troops pressed forward with the resolution always displayed\r\nby the American soldier when properly led. After maintaining the contest\r\nfor three-quarters of an hour, they retired unsuccessful, because they\r\nhad encountered entrenched infantry, unsurpassed by that of Napoleon's\r\nOld Guard, or that which followed Wellington into France, out of Spain.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a more soldierly appreciation of both\r\nofficers and men of those two American armies. And in a recent\r\ninteresting book on Grant and Lee[2] is cited a remark of Charles\r\nFrancis Adams when American Minister to Great Britain in the early years\r\nof our Civil War. Some one sarcastically asked him his opinion of the\r\nConfederate victories of that time. He quietly replied, \"I think they\r\nhave been won by my countrymen.\" In all those four strenuous years,\r\nheroic qualities--enterprise, resolution, valour, self-control, exercise\r\nof judgment amid dangers, endurance and fidelity in disaster--were\r\nplentifully developed throughout both parties of the then divided\r\nAmerican people. The lonely picket-duty, the toilsome march, the endless\r\nduties of the soldier, were a constant drain upon enduring faithfulness,\r\nharder to bear, often, than the crashing excitement of the battle, while\r\nthe deadly suffering of camp and hospital were at times easily worse\r\nthan all.\r\n\r\nMost fascinating the story of the leaders of the two armies. The career\r\nof two preëminent military leaders of the South, Lee and Jackson, has\r\nalready been reviewed--cursorily, as must be the case in all the\r\nreferences to example--and we have noted them especially as to\r\ncharacter. But it should be said further that in the opinion of military\r\ncritics and soldiers, both American and foreign, Robert E. Lee was one\r\nof the most masterly strategists in warlike annals. In his defense of\r\nRichmond as the vital point of the Confederacy he did have the advantage\r\nof operating on interior lines; but when that is said all is said, for\r\nin numbers of men, equipment and military resources, he was always more\r\nmeagrely supplied than his Federal opponents. His available means were\r\nmostly in his fertile brain, his prompt judgment, and his dauntless\r\nheart, together with the spirited support of his officers and the\r\nindomitable marching and fighting energy of his soldiers. The intense\r\nand tireless Jackson was indeed the chief's \"right arm,\" and more than\r\nthat, a keen intelligence, instant to see and seize the right way, and\r\nto follow it so swiftly that his rarely defeated infantry earned the\r\nproud nickname of \"foot-cavalry.\"\r\n\r\nOut of the many gallant officers of the Southern armies were some others\r\nwhose names became familiar throughout the North. Among them were:\r\nGenerals Pierre G. T. Beauregard, prominent in service from Bull Run to\r\nthe end; the brilliant Albert Sidney Johnston, killed at Pittsburg\r\nLanding in 1862; J. E. B. Stuart, renowned as a fearless cavalry\r\nofficer; James Longstreet, a leader of great distinction; the two\r\nHills--Daniel H. and Ambrose P., both renowned fighters, the latter\r\nimmortalized by Stonewall Jackson's last words, \"A. P. Hill, prepare for\r\naction!\" Another was Richard S. Ewell--not, like all the foregoing, a\r\nWest Point graduate, with training and notable service in United States\r\narmies and wars, but, like many Federal generals, a volunteer, who\r\nachieved high rank by efficient activity.\r\n\r\nIn naval affairs, naturally, the South had little chance to show her\r\nmettle, having neither navy-yards nor navy, and all her ports being\r\nblockaded. The chief attempts on the water were the iron-plated ram\r\n_Merrimac_, commanded by Commodore Franklin Buchanan, which after\r\nsinking several wooden men-of-war in Hampton Roads was defeated by the\r\nnew iron-turreted _Monitor_ under Lieutenant (later Admiral) John L.\r\nWorden; the iron-clad ram _Albemarle_, which damaged Northern shipping\r\nuntil blown up by Lieutenant W. B. Cushing, U. S. Navy, in a daring\r\npersonal adventure; and the British built, equipped and manned\r\n_Alabama_, under Commodore Raphael Semmes of the Confederacy, which\r\ndestroyed millions of dollars in Northern ships on the high seas in\r\n1862-1864, until sunk by the war-steamer _Kearsarge_ under Captain\r\n(later Admiral) John A. Winslow, off Cherbourg, in June, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe principal naval activities of the Federals during the war were in\r\nthe reduction of fortified places on land in cooperation with the\r\narmies, and in blockading ports of the South to keep in their cotton and\r\nto keep out foreign supplies. One of the earliest feats was the\r\neffective use by Captain Andrew H. Foote in February, 1862, of the\r\ngunboats built in 1861 by Frémont for river warfare, when Foote daringly\r\nshelled Forts Donelson and Henry on the Cumberland River, enabling Grant\r\nto attack and summon them to \"unconditional surrender.\" And on the long\r\nseaboard, the North soon had a line of battle-ships stretching from Cape\r\nHatteras around to Florida, New Orleans and the further coast of Texas.\r\nBesides its few original war-ships, out of coasters, steamers and old\r\njunk the Navy Department constructed a fleet. But it was the man behind\r\nthe gun who maintained the blockade, starved the Confederacy, and\r\ncleared the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nThe story of men like Farragut and his boys is like a chapter out of a\r\nwonder book. In April, 1862, with a fleet of wooden frigates,\r\nmortar-schooners, and half-protected boats he entered the mouth of the\r\nMississippi below New Orleans. The bottom of the river bristled with\r\ntorpedoes--kegs filled with powder, and surrounded with long prongs that\r\nrested upon percussion caps. When a ship struck a prong it exploded the\r\ncap and the powder, and again and again a boat went to the bottom. The\r\nforts that protected the Mississippi thirty miles below the city were\r\nsheathed with sand bags, and mounted a hundred guns; while a boom of\r\nlogs and chains crossed the river, and a fleet of fifteen vessels\r\nincluding an armed ram and a floating battery were there to dispute\r\nfurther progress. But Farragut lashed himself into the rigging of his\r\nflag-ship, and his fleet stormed the passage, raked with chains and\r\nshell. From the 18th to the 25th of April, a battle royal was waged with\r\nsplendid valour on both sides; but the forts were passed, the boom was\r\nbroken, the defensive fleet defeated, and Farragut had won New Orleans.\r\nFarragut, David D. Porter and other heroes had their full share of war\r\nand of glory not only here but later in Mobile Bay, and in 1863 with\r\nGrant and Sherman at Vicksburg, and at Port Hudson on the Mississippi,\r\nand Porter at Fort Fisher in December, 1864-January, 1865. Of absolute\r\nmaritime warfare there was none, except Winslow's sinking of the\r\n_Alabama_, but in all the river and harbour fighting, against both\r\nfleets and forts, there was endless demand for intrepidity, ingenuity,\r\nlarge intelligence, and heroism--demands never failing of response.\r\n\r\nThe greatest soldiers of the North were McClellan, Sherman, Thomas and\r\nSheridan, and, towering above all, Grant. We may not linger in detail\r\nupon them all, and can but mention George H. Thomas, the \"Rock of\r\nChickamauga,\" stern as war, firm as granite, the bravest of knights;\r\nWilliam T. Sherman, audacious, fertile, perhaps the most brilliant of\r\nthem all; and Philip H. Sheridan, an organized thunder-storm, with the\r\nswiftness of the war eagle, impetuous, loving adventure, the idol of his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIf at last Grant was the brain of the army, Sherman was, like Jackson to\r\nLee, its \"right arm.\" From the beginning of his military career, Sherman\r\nwon the admiration and confidence of the government and the people of\r\nthe North. He achieved honours at Vicksburg, and from that hour on to\r\nhis victory at Atlanta and his march to the sea, his name and fame\r\nsteadily increased. His victories were won, not only by enthusiasm and\r\nbrilliancy, but by a mastery in advance of all the facts in the case.\r\nHis knowledge was microscopic, to the last degree, as to the roads,\r\nbridges, and resources of the country through which he was marching. On\r\napproaching Atlanta he came to a region through which he had ridden on\r\nhorseback twenty years before. That night in his tent, his guides, spies\r\nand advance scouts spread out their maps before Sherman, and to the\r\nastonishment of all, the soldier corrected and amplified them. It seemed\r\nthat a score of years before he had formed the habit of making a\r\ndetailed study of each region through which he travelled, and of working\r\nout campaigns of attack and defense. His old notes were so accurate as\r\nto prove the basis of an actual campaign for a great army. His contest\r\nwith Johnston represented what has been called an inch by inch struggle,\r\nand although Sherman was victorious, when he passed away, the aged\r\nSouthern soldier, Johnston, made the long journey to New York to act as\r\npall-bearer and to testify to the splendid qualities of his great\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nIt was Grant himself who called Sheridan \"the left arm of the Union.\" By\r\nuniversal consent \"little Phil\" was the most brilliant campaigner of the\r\ngroup of soldiers of the first class. The story of his victory at\r\nWinchester captured the imagination of the North. The poem describing\r\nthat achievement became the most popular poem of the year, and was\r\nrecited by all the schoolboys on Friday afternoons, and quoted by all\r\nthe politicians on the platform. The North had suffered so many defeats\r\nin the Shenandoah Valley that Sheridan's victory put new heart into the\r\nUnion forces, and helped unite the Republican party, making certain the\r\nelection of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a great German soldier once expressed the judgment that Sheridan\r\nranked not only with Grant, but with the greatest soldiers of all time.\r\n\r\nThe work of George H. McClellan was the work of the pioneer and\r\npathfinder. It is one thing to take a sword, a Damascus blade, and use\r\nit in leadership, and quite another thing to take raw metal and on the\r\nanvil hammer out the blade for a hero's hand. McClellan made the sword;\r\nGrant used it. There is a pathetic passage in Dante's \"Vita Nuova\": \"It\r\nis easier to sing a song than to create a harp.\" Dante meant that he had\r\nto create the Italian language before he could write the \"Paradiso.\" Now\r\nMcClellan's task was to create an army. He took a body of raw recruits\r\nand drilled them; he organized a system of supplies and built up a\r\npurchasing, transporting and storing department; he tested out all the\r\nguns, the cannons, powder and explosives; he compacted a body of\r\nengineers, weeding out poor ones and educating good ones; he took\r\nofficers who at the beginning had their appointments through political\r\ninfluence and trained them until he had a body of men well knit\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBut McClellan had to contend with jealousy and insubordination. He was a\r\ncommander early in the war, and he had competitors and detractors. It\r\nwas charged against him that he was more anxious to make than to use a\r\nsplendid army, and possibly his ideals of efficiency were too high for\r\nthose early days. Yet \"Little Mac\" was idolized by his soldiers, with\r\nwhom he fought and won bloody battles, and even the indeterminate ones\r\nare held in doubt as to his responsibility. Had Hooker obeyed his\r\ncommand, and crossed the bridge at Antietam and occupied the heights\r\nbeyond, soldiers think to-day that Lee would have been crushed. Another\r\nfact was against him. The North was not ready to behold nor strong\r\nenough to endure the slaughter to which later on they became accustomed.\r\nAfter one of McClellan's first campaigns, Burnside wrote home that\r\nMcClellan could have fought his way to Richmond, but it would have cost\r\nten thousand men, and that would have been butchery. Later on, Grant, in\r\na single brief campaign, lost twenty-five thousand men! But if Grant had\r\nsuffered such losses in 1861 or 1862, he would have been dropped by\r\nWashington as unfitted for a military campaign.\r\n\r\nHistory will rank Grant as the foremost soldier of the Republic. His\r\nstory is full of romance. He was of Scotch Covenanter stock that settled\r\nin New England, and made its way to Ohio and Illinois. Like all the most\r\nsuccessful generals on both sides in our Civil War, he was a graduate of\r\nWest Point, showed talent in mathematics and engineering, and made an\r\nhonourable name in the Mexican War. Scott praised him for his work as\r\nquartermaster and officer. The two maps that Grant made by questioning\r\nranchmen and farmers as he went through Texas, and the information he\r\ncollected from men who had been in and knew the roads and resources of\r\nMexico, were later on invaluable. Grant was in every Mexican battle save\r\none.\r\n\r\nFort Sumter fell on April 14, 1861. On the 15th Lincoln called for\r\n75,000 troops. On the 19th Grant organized a little company in\r\nSpringfield, Illinois. Two days later Governor Yates made him colonel.\r\nOn the 31st of July he was in command at Mexico, Missouri. On the 7th of\r\nAugust his victory at Columbus won him the rank of brigadier-general. On\r\nthe 10th of February, 1862, he was made major-general; on the 23d of\r\nMarch, 1864, he was made lieutenant-general of the armies of the United\r\nStates. It was one long uninterrupted series of victories, for it has\r\nbeen said that it will never be known if Grant could conduct a retreat,\r\nbecause he never was defeated. From the beginning his supreme qualities\r\nas a military commander were fully evidenced.\r\n\r\nColumbus was called the Gibraltar of the Mississippi. Halleck had\r\nordered Grant to feel the strength of the enemy. But Grant was\r\nresourceful, fertile in expedients, a believer in offensive tactics.\r\nHurling his forces upon Columbus, he won a signal victory. At Fort\r\nDonelson, Grant showed his iron endurance and untiring patience. When it\r\ncame to the critical hour of the assault, a cold sleet-storm fell upon\r\nhis army; the ground was a sheet of glass, the trees encased in ice.\r\nGrant himself spent half the night under a tree, standing upright,\r\nreceiving reports and working out his plans. When a spy brought word\r\nthat the Confederates had packed their knapsacks with three days'\r\nrations, Grant said: \"They are preparing to retreat; we must assault the\r\nworks,\" and, despite the storm, made an immediate attack. When Halleck\r\nreceived the news of the fall of Fort Donelson, in announcing the\r\nvictory to Washington he did not even mention the name of Grant, but\r\nasked Lincoln to promote Smith, a subordinate commander.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1863, after months of siege by river and by land, came the\r\ncapture of Vicksburg, coincident with the Battle of Gettysburg, that was\r\nthe high-water mark of the war. The announcement of these two victories,\r\non July 4, 1863, intoxicated the North with joy.\r\n\r\nBy this time Grant's name was upon all lips, and he stood forth the one\r\ngeneral fitted for command of all the armies--in the West, in the South,\r\nand on the Potomac. Just as some men have the gift of inventing, the\r\ngift of singing, the gift of carving, so Grant had the gift of strategy.\r\nOne glance, and Grant had the whole situation in hand--the weak points\r\nto be attacked, the weak points of his own position to be safeguarded,\r\nthe danger point for the enemy. Obedient himself, he expected instant\r\nobedience from others. Willing to risk his own life, he expected the\r\nsame self-sacrifice on the part of his fellow officers. One biographer\r\ncalls him \"a master quartermaster,\" telling us that he knew how to feed\r\nand supply an army. Another calls Grant a great drillmaster, exhibiting\r\nhim as the teacher of his own generals. Another terms Grant a natural\r\nengineer, with great gifts, but without detailed training. Another\r\nspeaks of him as the greatest soldier in history in the way of attack.\r\nBut when all these statements are combined, they tell us that Grant is\r\nthe great, all-round soldier of the war, who by natural gifts and long\r\nexperience could do many things, and all equally well. It is this that\r\nexplains the tributes to his military genius by foreign soldiers, and\r\nthe great masters of war in every land.\r\n\r\nGrant's last campaign was against the capital of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, as the key to the Atlantic coast, for until Richmond should\r\nbe taken and the Confederate government put to flight, the war would not\r\nbe broken. Therefore Grant concentrated all his forces upon that:--\"I\r\nwill fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" In those awful\r\ncampaigns Grant came to be called \"the butcher,\" for he was as pitiless\r\nas fate, as unyielding as death. One outpost after another fell; one\r\nSouthern regiment after another surrendered. Battles became mere\r\nslaughter-pits. Men went down like forest leaves; the army surgeons, at\r\nthe spectacle, grew sick; it seemed more like murder than war. The\r\nWilderness, Spottsylvania, Chickahominy, Petersburg, were names to make\r\none shudder. But Lee would not yield, and Grant had one watchword,\r\n\"Unconditional surrender.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, without food, without equipment, without arms, Southern\r\nsoldiers began to desert by thousands. Lee's army was reduced, his\r\nsupplies were cut off, his retreat to the mountains and any chance of\r\njoining with Johnston from the Carolinas were blocked. Grant demanded\r\nsurrender to save further bloodshed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 9, 1865, Grant and Lee met in peace conference.\r\nGrant had on an old suit splashed with mud, and was without his sword;\r\nLee wore a splendid new uniform that had just been sent by admirers in\r\nBaltimore. Lee asked upon what terms Grant would receive the surrender.\r\nGrant answered that officers and men \"Shall not hereafter serve in the\r\narmies of the Confederate States or in any military capacity against the\r\nUnited States of America, or render aid to the enemies of the latter,\r\nuntil properly exchanged,\"--all being then freed on parole. The horses\r\nof the cavalry were the property of the men. And Grant said: \"I know\r\nthat men--and indeed the whole South--are impoverished; I will instruct\r\nmy officers to allow the men to retain their horses and take them home\r\nto work their little farms.\" Lee's final request was for rations for his\r\nstarving men. Grant and Lee shook hands, after which the Virginian\r\nmounted his horse and rode off to his army. The Confederates met their\r\nbeloved general with tumultuous shouts. With eyes swimming in tears, Lee\r\nsaid, in substance: \"I have done what I thought to be best and what I\r\nthought was right; go back to your homes, conduct yourselves like good\r\ncitizens and you will not be molested.\"\r\n\r\nWhen certain Northern soldiers were preparing to fire salutes to\r\ncelebrate the victory, Grant stopped the demonstration. \"The best sign\r\nof rejoicing after victory will be to abstain from all demonstrations in\r\nthe field.\" All men in the North felt that the fall of Lee's army meant\r\nthe fall of the Confederacy. Indeed, it did practically end the war. The\r\nfinal sheaf of victory is reaped when the commander, at the head of his\r\ntroops, marches into the enemy's capital and makes the palace of his foe\r\nto shelter his own horses. The whole South expected Grant to lead his\r\nArmy of the Potomac into Richmond. But Grant remembered Lee's sorrow,\r\nand had no desire for a dramatic triumph. He sent a subordinate to\r\noccupy Richmond, and quietly began the work of disbanding the army.\r\nSending his regiments back to the fields and factories, he said, \"Let us\r\nhave peace.\" From that sentiment issued the new South and the new North.\r\n\r\nBut the man who had fought the war through to a successful issue became\r\nthe most beloved man in the North, and soon the people bore him to the\r\nWhite House. The task was one for a giant. Four million slaves, newly\r\nemancipated, had to be cared for. Their fidelity to the families of\r\ntheir absent masters during the war was beautiful; while, towards the\r\nend of the strife, the enrollment and gallant fighting of 150,000\r\ncoloured men (Northern and Southern) in the Federal armies showed their\r\nmanfulness. And now their Southern millions were free. They had the\r\nsuffrage, but could not read the names of the men for whom they were\r\nvoting. They were free men, but they had no land, no plough, no cabin,\r\nno anything. Pitiful their plight! In retrospect, no race has ever made\r\nsuch wonderful progress in fifty years. With President Eliot we may say\r\nthat \"their industrial achievements are the wonder of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe second task that confronted President Grant was the reconstruction\r\nof the South. It was the era of the carpet-bagger. Northern regiments\r\ndwelt in Southern cities. Men were talking about hanging Jefferson\r\nDavis, and trying to decide whether or not the Confederate soldiers and\r\nofficers should receive again the suffrage. Designing whites and\r\nignorant coloured men gained control of legislatures. Corruption was\r\nrife. The whole South was prostrated. Ten thousand questions arose in\r\nCongress, bewildering, intricate, and the whole land was divided in\r\nopinion as to the proper courses. Finally, all the Confederate officers,\r\nsaving perhaps Jefferson Davis alone, and some who refused to accept,\r\nreceived again their political rights at the hands of the magnanimous\r\nNorth. Slowly chaos became cosmos.\r\n\r\nScarcely less heavy were the financial troubles of Grant's\r\nadministration. An era of war is an era of extravagance. When hard times\r\ncame, men were tempted by the dreams of cheap money, and the greenback\r\ncraze was abroad. But Grant stood for honest money, and attacked lying\r\nmeasures with the zeal of a Hebrew prophet.\r\n\r\nAfter two presidential terms came two years of foreign travel (1877-79),\r\nand wherever the great soldier went he exhibited his confidence in\r\ndemocracy, his interest in the working people and the poor. He returned\r\nhome to receive such an ovation as no American citizen has ever had. Six\r\nyears of private life were followed by a financial disaster that\r\nthreatened to destroy his good name itself. Grant was one who made\r\nill-advised haste to become rich. Scandalized by the deceit and\r\nimpoverished by the failure of men he had trusted as partners, the great\r\nsoldier was now assaulted by worry and fear. Our best physicians believe\r\nthat fear, whether related to property or the loss of name, or grievous\r\ndisappointment, is in some way related to cancer. And within a few\r\nmonths after that awful wreckage, Grant knew that his life was coming to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nThe soldier became an author. Stricken with death, in the hope of\r\nsafeguarding his family against poverty Grant decided to write his\r\nmemoirs. It was an astonishing literary achievement. His style is simple\r\nas sunshine. Grant knew what he wanted to say, said it, and had done.\r\nYet all the time a shadow was falling upon the page,--the shadow made by\r\nthe messenger of death, who stood by Grant's shoulder, ready to claim\r\nhis own. Slowly the soldier wrote the story of his youth, his campaigns\r\nin the West, his battles in the Wilderness, while every day the hand\r\ngrew feebler.\r\n\r\nReared in a religious atmosphere, Grant's nature was essentially moral\r\nand religious. He possessed all the big essential virtues--honesty,\r\njustice, truth, honour, good will. He loved the truth. He felt that he\r\nhad done what he could. Southern soldiers and generals as well as\r\nNorthern comrades and friends brought to his bedside messages of\r\naffection and good cheer. At length he fell asleep. His tomb on the\r\nheight above the Hudson has become a Mecca for innumerable multitudes.\r\n\r\nTo the end of time, perhaps, Lincoln will be remembered as the Martyr\r\nPresident, the best loved of all our leaders, the great Emancipator, the\r\ngentlest memory of our world; but side by side with Lincoln will stand\r\nGrant, the man of oak and rock, the man of iron will, who fought the war\r\nto a successful issue, and will be known in history as the greatest\r\nsoldier of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE AT HOME WHO SUPPORTED THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a proverb that nothing moves men like tales of eloquence and\r\nheroism. Historians and poets alike believe that stories of bravery and\r\nanecdotes of heroes exert a profound influence upon young hearts. Here\r\nis Socrates. His judges condemn him to the jail and poison. Socrates\r\nquails not, and says: \"At what price would one not estimate one night of\r\nnoble conference with Homer and Hesiod? You, my judges, go home to your\r\nbanquets--I to hemlock and death; but whether it is better for you than\r\nfor me, God knoweth.\" It is a moving story. Here is the early missionary\r\nmartyr, fettered and brought before a cruel tyrant, to be condemned to\r\ndeath. The missionary lifts his chains, calls the roll of the king's\r\ncrimes, flashes the sword of justice, coerces the monarch from his\r\nthrone, makes him crawl, beg, plead, and beseech the missionary's pity\r\nand prayers, for speech has made a prisoner king, and turned a monarch\r\ninto a captive. It is a moving tale. And here are the stories of war:\r\nXenophon's ten thousand young Greeks, lost in the heart of the great\r\nnation, a thousand miles from home, without maps, without food,\r\noutnumbered daily ten to one, living off the country, fighting all day,\r\nsurrounded by a fresh army each night, steadily pursuing their famous\r\nretreat. See, too, the handful at Thermopylæ, defending the Pass, and\r\nevery one of them giving his life. And here are the Dutch, driven by the\r\nBloody Alva into the North Sea, clinging to the dykes by their\r\nfinger-tips, and fighting their way back to their homes and altars. And\r\nhere are the American boys confined to the prison ship, the _Jersey_,\r\nstarved victims of scurvy and fever, without food, without medicine,\r\nwith the corpses of their brothers floating in the water just outside,\r\nboys whose monument stands yonder in Fort Greene. What a tale of\r\nmartyrdom is theirs!\r\n\r\nYet the history of heroism holds no more thrilling story than that of\r\nthe soldiers of our Civil War. Every other passage, every other\r\nincident, that we have passed in review can be more than duplicated by\r\nsoldier boys who have lent new meaning to patriotism and martyrdom. As\r\nmany men died in Southern prisons as fell on both sides at the battle of\r\nGettysburg. This is their story--they counted life not dear unto\r\nthemselves; they struggled unto blood, striving against oppression, and\r\nthe world itself, with all its beauty, was not worthy of them.\r\n\r\nOur prosperous generation, threatened with effeminacy and softness,\r\nneeds to re-open the pages of history and to linger long upon the\r\nportraits of our heroic leaders. Theirs was the greatest war that ever\r\nshook the earth. A million Northern men, and over against them a million\r\nSouthern men, and a battle line a thousand miles in length! Including\r\nthe long-term men and the short-term service, 3,000,000 men engaged in\r\nthe conflict! Two thousand two hundred and sixty-one battles fought--if\r\nwe mention conflicts in which there were more than five hundred engaged\r\non each side. When Lee surrendered, his land was desolate. Armies upon\r\narmies of cripples came home to suffer! There were a million widows and\r\nover three million orphan children! Men who at Lincoln's call for troops\r\nleft the college and the university discovered, when it was all over,\r\nthat it was too late to take up their studies, and lived on like\r\nunfulfilled prophecies. Others, who during those four years poured out\r\nall the vital nerve forces, brought so little strength out of the long,\r\nbitter struggle that they might better have died, and for years have\r\nbeen in the invalid's chair, looking with wistful eyes on the great\r\nprocession of society moving on to industrial victories! The war all\r\nover? The war has been continued in its influences throughout the entire\r\ngeneration! It never will be over until the last cripple has dropped his\r\nmaimed body, until the last child, robbed of a dead father's care, has\r\nrecovered his losses, and the last woman who has lived alone through the\r\nyears has found her beloved!\r\n\r\nThe courage and endurance of the Southern women, who took full charge of\r\nthe cotton plantations and helped support Lee's army, stirs the sense of\r\nwonder. There were many Northern women who had no relatives at the\r\nfront, but there was scarcely a Southern home where the father, husband\r\nor sons were not on the battle line. For that reason the Southern women\r\nwere always in a state of suspense. Homes were entirely broken up during\r\nthe four years. The men were at the front, and all the women were\r\neither at work at home or were in the hospitals as nurses. During 1862\r\nand 1863 practically every church in Richmond was a hospital, and there\r\nwere twenty-five other buildings used by surgeons. Physicians had no\r\nmorphine and no quinine. For coffee they used parched corn. Tea rose to\r\n$500 a pound. For sugar they steeped watermelon rind. For soda these\r\nwomen burned corncobs and mixed the ashes with their corn-meal. They had\r\nneither ice nor salt. They tore up their ingrain carpets to make\r\ntrousers for the soldiers. Women wore coarse hemp and calico. Having no\r\nleather, one little factory turned out five hundred pairs of wooden\r\nshoes a month in Richmond.\r\n\r\nWhen Lee needed bullets, a minister tore the lead pipe out of his house\r\nin Richmond to send the lead to Lee. Flour rose to $400 a barrel. In one\r\nlittle town iron became so scarce that tenpenny nails were used for\r\nmoney. No tale more pitiful than that of the women who took charge of\r\nthe slaves on the plantation, comforted their little children, buried\r\ntheir dead, smiled, wept, prayed, worked, compelled their lips to\r\nsilence, staggered on, groaned inly while they taught men peace, and\r\ndied while others were smiling. Whether or not men are made in the image\r\nof God, these women certainly were. And it was because they believed\r\nwith all their mind and soul that independence for the State was the\r\nsovereign gift of God; and they died for independence, just as the boys\r\nin blue lived and died for the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was this moral earnestness and intensity of conviction that made the\r\nwar so terrible. When England hired Hessians to fight Washington's\r\ntroops, and they fought for so much a week, the hired soldiers were slow\r\nto begin attack and quick to retreat. Mercenaries have to be scourged\r\ninto battle. Stonewall Jackson's men believed in their cause and\r\nthirsted for the excitement of the attack and onslaught. And yet all the\r\ntime the two opposing armies maintained mutual respect and even\r\ndeveloped a new sense of brotherhood as the desperate struggle went on.\r\nNever was there a war carried on with such intensity by day and such a\r\nsense of mutual respect at night. Once when the Rappahannock separated\r\nthe two armies, and it was evident that there was no campaign beyond, a\r\nrevival broke out in one of Stonewall Jackson's regiments and there were\r\nprayer-meetings in almost every tent every night. Becoming acquainted,\r\na number of boys in blue by previous arrangement crossed the river, and\r\nknelt in the prayer service. One night the sound of the regiments\r\nsinging, \"Nearer My God to Thee,\" rolled through the air across the\r\nriver, and finally the boys in the Northern army joined in, until at the\r\nlast verse, the two regiments, opposed in arms, were one in voice and\r\nheart, as they poured out their souls to God in the old hymn they had\r\nlearned at their mother's knee. For the soldier knew that any moment a\r\nshot might bring the end.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of men in prisons touch the note of horror. The national\r\ngovernment is planning a monument for those who died in Andersonville.\r\nGettysburg slew 26,000, Andersonville 32,000. The stockade included\r\ntwenty-six acres, but three acres were marsh. Incredible as it may seem,\r\nthere was no shelter, no beds, no cook-house, no hospital, no nothing.\r\nJust the cold rain in winter chilling men to death, just the pitiless\r\nglare of the August sun scorching them to death. There was no\r\nsanitation, and when it rained the little stream backed up the sewage,\r\nand after each shower men died by scores. Wirtz wrote Jefferson Davis\r\nthat one-fifth of the meal was bran, and that he had no meat, no\r\nmedicine, no clothing. Men burrowed in the ground, dug caves like rats,\r\nand not infrequently fifty bodies were carried out in a single day.\r\nWirtz destroyed men faster than did General Lee. The men imprisoned in\r\nAndersonville urge that there were thousands of cords of wood just\r\noutside the stockade, miles upon miles of forests all about, that the\r\nprisoners could have built their own shanties and hospitals, and\r\ncookhouses. To which Wirtz's friends answer that he did not have weapons\r\nor Confederate soldiers enough to guard the prisoners on parole. While\r\nthey also answer that the prisoners in Andersonville had as much food\r\nand the same kind as Lee's army was then enjoying. The plain fact is\r\nthat the South was out of medicine, clothing and food, and was itself on\r\nthe edge of starvation.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful thing is that these Union boys, 32,000 of them, who died\r\nat Andersonville, could at any moment have obtained release by taking\r\nthe oath not to renew arms against the South. Some few did escape by\r\ndigging under the stockade--but what perils they endured to escape from\r\nthe enemy's country! They slept in leaves by day, and travelled by\r\nnight. They were pursued by bloodhounds, lay in water and swamps, with\r\nonly their lips above the filth until the peril had passed by. They wore\r\nrags, ate roots, shivered in the rains, sweltered in the heat, grew more\r\nemaciated, until more dead than alive they reached the Northern lines.\r\n\r\nNow that it is all over, Confederate soldiers like General John B.\r\nGordon have said on a hundred lecture platforms in Northern cities that,\r\nhaving done what he could for States' rights and to destroy the Union,\r\nhe thanked God above all things else that he was not successful. In the\r\nspirit of Abraham Lincoln, that great Southern soldier wrote the last\r\nwords of his life, in the hope that they would help cement the Union\r\nbetween the North and the South:--\"The issues that divided the sections\r\nwere born when the Republic was born, and were forever buried in an\r\nocean of fraternal blood. We shall then see that, under God's\r\nprovidence, every sheet of flame from the blazing rifles of the\r\ncontending armies, every whizzing shell that tore through the forests at\r\nShiloh and Chancellorsville, every cannon shot that shook Chickamauga's\r\nhills or thundered around the heights of Gettysburg, and all the blood\r\nand the tears that were shed are yet to become contributions for the\r\nupbuilding of American manhood and for the future defense of American\r\nfreedom. The Christian Church received its baptism of pentecostal power\r\nas it emerged from the shadows of Calvary, and went forth to its\r\nworld-wide work with greater unity and a diviner purpose. So the\r\nRepublic, rising from its baptism of blood with a national life more\r\nrobust, a national union more complete, and a national influence ever\r\nwidening, shall go forever forward in its benign mission to humanity.\"\r\n\r\nNor must we forget the work of nurses, the members of the Sanitary\r\nCommission, and the Christian Commission Movement. The events of the\r\nRussian-Japanese war show what is a wonderful progress of science. Japan\r\nsent along with her army experts on the water, the food, and the placing\r\nof tents, that made typhoid, cholera and the usual diseases impossible.\r\nHer surgeons used antiseptic methods, and gangrene was practically\r\nunknown in the Japanese hospitals. But the situation was different in\r\n1861. Modern sanitation, surgery, antiseptic methods, chloroform and\r\nether are comparatively recent discoveries. Such anesthetics as the\r\nsurgeons had were poor in quality and insufficient in quantity. In the\r\ncamps fever was prevalent. Smallpox, measles and lesser diseases became\r\nmalignant and wrought terrible ravages. Tents became more dangerous than\r\nbattle-fields. What the bullet began, the hospitals completed. More men\r\ndied through disease than through leaden hail. But the noble army of\r\nphysicians and nurses wrought wonders. Think of it! Twenty-six thousand\r\nmen dead or dying on the field of Gettysburg!\r\n\r\nHere is a page torn from the journal of one of the nurses there: \"We\r\nbegin the day with the wounded and sick by washing and freshening them.\r\nThen the surgeons and dressers make their rounds, open the wounds, apply\r\nthe remedies and replace the bandages. This is the awful hour. I put my\r\nfingers in my ears this morning. When it is over we go back to the men\r\nand put the ward in order once more, remaking the beds and giving clean\r\nhandkerchiefs with a little cologne or bay water upon them, so prized in\r\nthe sickening atmosphere of wounds. Then we keep going round and round,\r\nwetting the bandages, going from cot to cot almost without stopping,\r\ngiving medicine and brandy according to orders. I am astonished at the\r\nwhole-souled and whole-bodied devotion of the surgeons. Men in every\r\ncondition of horror, shattered and shrieking, are brought in on\r\nstretchers and dumped down anywhere.\" Men shattered in the thigh, and\r\neven cases of amputation were shovelled into berths without blanket,\r\nwithout thought or mercy. It could not have been otherwise. Other\r\nhundreds and thousands were out on the field of Gettysburg bleeding to\r\ndeath, and every minute was precious.\r\n\r\nNo page can ever describe the service of nurses, sisters of mercy,\r\nchaplains, brave men and kind women, who took train and went to the\r\nfront upon news of the battle and remained there for weeks.\r\n\r\nBut while the soldier boys were striving unto blood for their\r\nconvictions, what about the people at home who loved them? How did they\r\ncarry their burdens and fulfill their task that was not less important?\r\nFortunately, during the war, the North was blessed with four bountiful\r\nharvests that were rich enough, not only to support the people at home,\r\nand the soldiers at the front, but also to furnish an excess of food\r\nthat could be sold abroad to obtain money with which to help support the\r\nwar. It seemed as if the sun, the rain, and the soil had entered into a\r\nconspiracy to support the North and liberty. The largest crop of wheat\r\nand corn ever garnered before the war was in 1859. At that time, men\r\nthought the harvest would never be surpassed. But strangely enough, that\r\nbumper crop of 1859 was surpassed four times in succession during the\r\nCivil War. Meanwhile the herds of cattle and the flocks of sheep more\r\nthan doubled during the conflict, and all of the land that was not\r\nyellow with grain became a rich pasture and meadow, covered with cattle,\r\nsheep and horses.\r\n\r\nEven the losses of sugar and cotton usually purchased from the South\r\nwere made up to the North. Threatened with the loss of the Southern\r\nsugar, sorghum cane was imported from China, and the people scarcely\r\nmissed the Southern sugar. When the cotton failed, the unwonted increase\r\nof the flocks furnished wool for raiment. It stirs wonder to reflect\r\nthat one poor crop of wheat and corn might have changed the issue, and\r\ndefeated the North. Singularly enough also, the failure of crops in\r\nEurope not only offered a market for the unexpected Northern surplus,\r\nbut yielded the highest price ever known, thus bringing in a golden\r\nriver to enrich the Northern people. Jefferson Davis had said at the\r\nbeginning of the war that \"grass would soon be growing not simply in the\r\nstreets of the villages of the North, but in Broadway and Wall Street.\"\r\nDavis believed that the withdrawal of every fourth man would make our\r\nproblem of food and clothing impossible of solution. But at that moment\r\nthe invention of the reaper enabled one harvester to do the work of ten\r\nmen, and the new tools actually more than took the place of the Northern\r\nsoldiers who were at the front.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the spirit of patriotism and self-sacrifice descended upon\r\nthe Northern women. On the little farms where the farmer's wife was too\r\npoor to buy a reaper, the mother and the daughters went into the field\r\nto plough the corn and thrash the wheat and milk the cows. In many\r\ncounties in Iowa and Kansas one-half of the men were at the front, and\r\nin harvest time it is said that there were more women working in the\r\nwheat and corn fields than men.\r\n\r\nOne other element fought for liberty and the North. A strange unrest\r\nfell upon Europe. Foreign peoples became discontented and began to\r\nmigrate. In the summer of 1862 a vast multitude landed upon the shores\r\nin New York, at the very time when there was a scarcity of labour in the\r\nshops and factories. At the very hour when Lincoln was afraid that it\r\nmight become impossible to clothe the army and equip it, the providence\r\nof God raised up foreigners who stepped into the place made vacant by\r\nthe newly enlisted soldier; thereafter the North throughout the war\r\nactually increased in population, in wealth, in manufacturing interests.\r\nThe Civil War ended with the North richer and more prosperous than when\r\nit began; while in 1861 slavery had impoverished the South, and war left\r\nthe Confederacy crushed to the very earth, peeled and stripped, famished\r\nand utterly broken. For the South never yielded until she had cast in\r\nthe last earthly possession, and knew that only life and breath were\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nDespite the abundant harvests, during the early part of the war the\r\nNorthern people passed through gloom, anxiety and bitter disappointment.\r\nAt first the colleges and universities were empty, because the students\r\nhad all gone to the front, but the common schools were as full as usual.\r\nThe churches were better attended than formerly, while the newspapers\r\nwere more widely read than ever before. The crisis sobered the people.\r\nThe serious note was manifest. One by one luxuries were given up,\r\namusements seemed paltry, and people forgot their usual diversions.\r\nAfter Bull Run came a succession of calamities. Longfellow writes:\r\n\"Sumner came to dine last night, but the evening was most gloomy, and\r\nall went away in tears.\" Governor Morton of Indiana wrote Lincoln,\r\n\"Another three months like the last six, and we are lost.\" Robert\r\nWinthrop of Boston came down to New York, and spoke of three scenes that\r\nhe had witnessed. The first was a group of soldiers on their way home,\r\nin charge of friends, some crippled, some emaciated, gaunt and broken,\r\nand the rest carried on stretchers. At another station he saw a group of\r\nyoung soldiers, intelligent, athletic and sturdy, climbing on the car to\r\nstart to the front, but on the platform was a group of pale-cheeked and\r\nweeping women, wives, mothers and sweethearts. \"Oh, it was terrible! It\r\nis all black, black, black!\" said Winthrop.\r\n\r\nBut after the battle of Gettysburg, the high-water mark of the war,\r\nmen's spirits began to rise. The North became inured to excitement. The\r\nemotion was converted into hard work and endurance, and that dogged\r\ndetermination to produce the raiment, the weapons and the food to\r\nsupport the army, or die in the attempt. Depositors took risks and\r\nloaned their money to the banks. Bankers took their courage in their\r\nhands and loaned the money to the manufacturers; manufacturers\r\nadvertised for labour in Europe and started up their factories by night\r\nas well as by day. Wages rose, the balance of trade was largely in\r\nfavour of the North, the oil regions began to prosper, and industry,\r\ncommerce and finance all waxed mighty. In 1864 the whole land was in the\r\nfull sweep of industrial prosperity. The debts incident to the panic of\r\n1857 were fully liquidated. Iron is the barometer, and the country\r\ndoubled its consumption of iron. An editor writing of his city says,\r\n\"Old Hartford seems fat and rich and cozy, and everything is as tranquil\r\nas if there were no war.\"\r\n\r\nBut the industrial conditions of life in the South were very different.\r\nBe it remembered that the North was a self-supporting region, both as\r\nto foods and manufactured articles, while the South, under slavery,\r\nproduced raw material, and used that raw stuff to build up factories in\r\nEngland. When the war came the South found herself without the means of\r\nsupplying her own wants. Within six months the South discovered that\r\nevery axe and saw and steam-engine and iron rail and bolt and nail had\r\ncome from the North. Davis sent out men to scurry the country for old\r\nstoves and every iron scrap was picked up to be melted into weapons. At\r\nthe close of the war tenpenny nails were used as five-cent pieces and\r\ncurrency in North Carolina. To crown all other disasters came the\r\ndebasement of the currency. Macaulay says that the world has suffered\r\nless from bad kings than from bad shillings and sixpences. The\r\nConfederacy issued one billion dollars of paper money, States issued\r\nanother flood of promises to pay, cities put out municipal currency,\r\nfire and life insurances their shin-plasters, and they kept pouring out\r\npaper money until finally all the printing presses broke down. A month\r\nbefore the collapse, a Confederate soldier, returning to his little\r\ncabin, paid $10,000 for a fifteen-year-old mule, knee sprung in front\r\nand spavined behind, and $7,500 for the shoes for shoeing the mule.\r\n\r\nLee's army would have collapsed but for the marvellous heroism,\r\nresourcefulness and courage of the Southern women. They took charge of\r\nthe fields, planted the crops, gathered the harvests, and staggered on\r\nto the end. Not one Northern home in five was death-stricken through the\r\nwar, but practically every Southern home had lost one or two members of\r\nthe family, through father, son or brother.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget what Lee owed to the fidelity of the negroes. Instead\r\nof insurrection, arson, pillage and murder in Southern towns and old\r\nhomesteads, the Southern slave remained true to his mistress, and was\r\nthe very soul of fidelity. Yet when the war was over, the town had\r\nbecome a wilderness, the plantation a desolation, and where there had\r\nbeen prosperity and even luxury, famine and want and disease had set up\r\ntheir abiding places. Verily secession sowed the wind and reaped the\r\nwhirlwind of destruction.\r\n\r\nThat the war influenced some people for good and influenced others for\r\nevil is beyond all doubt. During the first two years it was a distinct\r\ntonic to the intellect and conscience of the people. The sense of\r\nnational peril quickened the dull and lethargic, steadied the weak\r\ndrifters, furnished ballast to all the people, made the strong stronger,\r\nmade the brave more heroic. The first sign of national decay is the note\r\nof frivolity. The sure sign of greatness in a generation is the note of\r\nseriousness. In the middle of 1863 James Russell Lowell wrote Bancroft\r\nthat the war had been a great, a divine and a wholly unmixed blessing,\r\nand that all of the people were exalted to new levels. Had the war\r\nceased with the battle of Gettysburg, probably Lowell's statement would\r\nhave held true, but later came the reaction towards graft and\r\ncorruption, intemperance, profligacy and gambling. Within four years the\r\nrepresentatives of the government expended from seven to eight billions\r\nof dollars. Government contractors bought at a single time 50,000 suits\r\nof clothes, 100,000 rifles, 200,000 blankets. The temptation to graft\r\nwas strong for all and irresistible to a few. The government records\r\nspeak of one horse-trader in St. Louis who bought his horses and mules\r\nat $75 and sold them to the government for $150, and made enough to buy\r\nMississippi steamboats for $65,000. He then rented these boats to the\r\ngovernment for one year for $295,000, and at the end of the year still\r\nowned the boats. To what extent charges of graft were made is indicated\r\nby the fact that one claim was reduced from fifty millions to\r\nthirty-three millions. A cartoon of that time with strange exaggeration\r\nrepresents one man saying to his friend, \"So-and-so has obtained a third\r\ncontract from the government.\" To which his friend answers, \"Well, well!\r\nA couple of more contracts and he will die worth a million.\" For any\r\nmanufacturer to obtain a government contract was for that man to be on\r\nthe highroad to wealth.\r\n\r\nYet the historians who analyze these reports find a large amount of\r\nexaggeration in the statements. Some waste there was, but the\r\nauthorities seem to think that it was the waste of inexperience for the\r\nmost part. When the war opened the Navy Department was spending\r\n$1,000,000 a year. By 1862 it was spending $145,000,000, and with no\r\norganization to handle such enormous interests. In general, in view of\r\nthe sudden emergency thrust upon the people, the marvel is not that\r\nthere was so much corruption among government contractors, but that\r\nthere were so many honest contractors, and that there was so little\r\nwaste through inexperience.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that the moral and religious sentiment of both\r\nNorth and South alike steadily strengthened during the conflict. After\r\nGettysburg, the Southern people and army, always deeply religious, in\r\ntheir distress turned to their fathers' God for support. Jackson and\r\nLee's men fought by day, and held prayer-meetings by night. In the\r\nNorth, during 1861 and '62 and '63, religious meetings were held all\r\nover the land. When the winter twilight fell, the candles began to burn\r\nin the little schoolhouses, where the farmers assembled and prayed to\r\nGod. In the small towns and tiny villages the little churches were\r\npacked with worshippers, not simply on Sundays but during the evenings\r\nof the week. During this interval the layman became as influential as\r\nthe ordained preachers. At this time, the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation took its rise, all of the old men saw visions, and all of\r\nthe young men dreamed dreams, and many a Saul was found among the\r\nprophets. Poets like Lowell were moved by deeply religious\r\ninspirations. During the war Whittier wrote his loftiest songs and his\r\nnoblest and most exalted prayers. The influence of the great conflict\r\nupon philosophers like Emerson is easily traced. American literature\r\nlost its note of unreality. Preaching became practical. There was a\r\nrevival of ethics in politics. The war cleared the atmosphere of the\r\ncountry by sweeping away slavery with all its foundation of lies.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips once said the French Revolution was the greatest and\r\nmost unmixed blessing of the last one thousand years. Now that it is all\r\nover, and the slain soldiers and the brave women who went down in the\r\nconflict have had all their hard questions asked before the throne of\r\nGod, perhaps these heroes and heroines who now live unto God look back\r\nupon this era as an era of sorrow overruled for justice and liberty. The\r\nconclusion of the whole matter is this: a good house must be founded\r\nupon a rock, and no government or civilization can be permanent that is\r\nnot based on the freedom, property and intelligence of the working\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nTo-day the leaders of thought in the South believe that Lee and Gordon\r\nwere right in the statement that they \"thanked God that they failed to\r\nestablish States' rights, and that Northern men had succeeded in\r\nmaintaining the Union.\" Time has cleared the air of misunderstandings.\r\nAt last the North and South understand Lincoln's last words regarding\r\nthe Civil War: \"Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and\r\neach invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men\r\nshould dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from\r\nthe sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not\r\njudged. The prayers of both could not be answered--that of neither has\r\nbeen answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. 'Woe unto the\r\nworld because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come; but\r\nwoe to that man by whom the offense cometh.' If we shall suppose that\r\nAmerican slavery is one of those offenses which, in the Providence of\r\nGod, must needs come, but which having continued through His appointed\r\ntime, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South\r\nthis terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came,\r\nshall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes\r\nwhich the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we\r\nhope--fervently do we pray--that this mighty scourge of war may speedily\r\npass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled\r\nby the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall\r\nbe sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paid\r\nby another drop of blood drawn by the sword, as was said three thousand\r\nyears ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of the Lord are true\r\nand righteous altogether.' With malice towards none; with charity for\r\nall; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let\r\nus strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's\r\nwounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his\r\nwidow and orphan; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and\r\nlasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN: THE MARTYRED PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the heroes who helped save the Republic, the last, best hope of\r\nearth, in that it gives liberty to the slaves, that it might assure\r\nfreedom to the free, stands Abraham Lincoln, the emancipator and martyr.\r\nTake him all in all, Abraham Lincoln is the greatest thing the Republic\r\nhas achieved. History tells of no child who passed from a cradle so\r\nhumble to a grave so illustrious. The institutions of the Republic were\r\nfounded for the manufacture of a good quality of soul. In the presence\r\nof the greatest men of history we can point with pride to Lincoln,\r\nsaying, \"This is the kind of man the institutions of the Republic can\r\nproduce.\" For Lincoln's most striking characteristic was his\r\nAmericanism. At best, Washington was a patrician, the fine product of\r\naristocratic institutions, so that England claimed him. Washington was\r\nthe richest man of his era, his home an old manor house, his estate\r\nwide inherited acres, his relative an English baronet, his brother the\r\nchild of Oxford University. The books he read were English books, the\r\nteachers he had were English tutors. The root was planted in English\r\nsoil, though it fruited under American skies. But Americanism is the\r\nvery essence of Lincoln's thoughts, Lincoln's enthusiasm, Lincoln's\r\nutterances, and Lincoln's character. One of the golden words of the\r\nRepublic is the word \"opportunity.\" Here, all the highways that lead to\r\noffice, land and honour must be open unto all young feet. A banker's son\r\nmay climb to the governor's mansion, or the White House, but so may the\r\nwasherwoman's. The widow's son practices eloquence in the corn fields of\r\nVirginia, but he has ability and patriotism, and we bring Henry Clay to\r\nthe Senate chamber. A child out in Ohio goes barefooted over the October\r\ngrass, driving an old red cow to the barn lot, but we bring McKinley to\r\nthe White House.\r\n\r\nYonder stands the Temple of Fame. The door is open by day and by night,\r\nand a tall, thin, sallow boy turns his back upon a log cabin in Illinois\r\nand seeks entrance. But the angel at the threshold asks hard questions:\r\n\"Can you eat crusts? Can you wear rags? Can you sleep in a garret? Can\r\nyou endure sleepless nights and days of toil? Can you bear up against\r\nevery wind that assails your bark? Can you live for liberty and God's\r\ntruth, and can you die for them?\" And that boy bowed his assent.\r\nWashington climbed hand over hand up the golden rounds of the ladder of\r\nsuccess; Lincoln built the ladder up which he climbed out of the fence\r\nrails which his own hands had split. Like his Divine Master, he touched\r\ntwo or three crusts and turned them into bread for the hungry\r\nmultitudes.\r\n\r\nHis little log cabin shames our palaces. His three books, the Bible, the\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" and \"Æsop's Fables\" eclipse our libraries. His six\r\nmonths in a log schoolhouse were more than equal to our eight years in\r\nlecture hall and university. His fidelity to the great convictions\r\nshames our shifting politicians. For fifty years he walked forward under\r\nclouded skies. Like Dante, he held heart-break at bay. During one brief\r\nepoch only did his sun clear itself of clouds. He died without full\r\nrecognition or reward. In retrospect he stands forth the saddest and\r\nsweetest, the strongest and gentlest, the most picturesque and the most\r\npathetic figure in our history. The Saviour of the world was born in a\r\nstable and cradled in a manger, and went by the Via Dolorosa towards the\r\nworld's throne. Not otherwise Abraham Lincoln was born in a cabin, more\r\nsuited for herds and flocks than for a young mother and a little child;\r\nand by the way of poverty and adversity the great emancipator travelled\r\ntowards his throne of influence and world supremacy.\r\n\r\nHistory holds a few deeds so great that they can be done but once. There\r\nare some laws, some reforms and some liberties that once achieved are\r\nalways achieved. Thus, Columbus discovered this new world, but his\r\nachievement reduced all the other explorers to the level of imitators.\r\nThus Isaac Newton discovered gravity, and in a moment every other\r\nastronomer became a pupil and a disciple. There never can be but one\r\nJames Watt, for, though a thousand inventors improve his engine, their\r\nnames are little tapers, shining over against the sun. The last century\r\noffered men of genius two signal opportunities, and there were a\r\nthousand eager aspirants for the honour. Charles Darwin discovered the\r\ngolden key that unlocked the kingdom of nature and life, and carried\r\noff the honours of science. Abraham Lincoln, in an hour when some would\r\nmeanly lose it, planned to nobly save the Union, emancipated three\r\nmillion slaves, and carried off the honours in the realm of reform and\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nHow great was the work done by this man and how supreme was the man\r\nhimself, we can best understand by comparison and contrast. Among small\r\nmen it is easy to be great. In Patagonia, where everybody eats blubber,\r\na boy in the first reader is a prodigy of learning.\r\n\r\nAnybody can be a giant in heroism and reform among Hottentots and South\r\nSea savages. But the era of the Civil War was an era of heroes. Great\r\nmen walked in regiments up and down the land. It was the age of Daniel\r\nWebster, whose genius is so wonderful that he achieved the four supreme\r\nthings of four realms,--the greatest legal argument we have, the\r\nDartmouth College case; the greatest plea before a judge and jury, the\r\nKnapp murder case; our finest outburst of inspirational eloquence, the\r\noration at Bunker Hill; the greatest argument in defense of the\r\nConstitution, his reply to Hayne. It was the age of John C. Calhoun, a\r\nstatesman whose political theories led half a continent to deeds of\r\ndaring war. It was the era of Seward, the all-round scholar, of Chase\r\nthe greatest secretary of treasury since Alexander Hamilton, a man who\r\nstruck the rock with the rod of his genius, and made the waters of\r\nfinance flow forth from the desert. It was the age of our greatest\r\norators, for then Wendell Phillips and Beecher were at their best. It\r\nwas the era of Emerson, the philosopher; of Theodore Parker, the\r\nreformer; of Garrison, the abolitionist; of Lovejoy, the martyr; of\r\nLowell and Whittier, the poets of freedom; of Greeley, the editor; it\r\nwas also the age of the greatest soldiers, Grant and Sherman, and\r\nSheridan and Lee. The great man is a form of fruit ripened in an\r\natmosphere made warm and genial, and the climate that nurtured Lincoln\r\nunfolded the talents that represented also other forms of mental fruit.\r\nAmong these men Lincoln lived and wrote and spoke, and suffered and\r\ndied;--but he stands forth a master among men, an indisputable genius,\r\none of the five supreme statesmen of all history.\r\n\r\nNow if we are to understand the unique place of Abraham Lincoln in our\r\nhistory we must recall again for a moment the men who set the battle\r\nlines in array. Unfortunately, most of our histories tell our children\r\nand youth that the Civil War raged about the slave. As a matter of fact,\r\nslavery was the occasion of the war, but not the cause. Slavery was the\r\nsulphur match that exploded the powder magazine, though the powder\r\nmagazine could have been set off by a spark from the flint and steel, or\r\na hundred other methods.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was really fought over the question whether a\r\nconstitutionally formed nation dedicated to the proposition that all men\r\nare created equal could permanently endure. The whole period from 1789\r\nto 1865 was a critical period, during which the Constitution was being\r\ntested and tried out.\r\n\r\nDuring this testing many forms of secession were planned, and several\r\nactual rebellions took place. In 1787 there was a Massachusetts\r\nrebellion under Shays, over the question of taxation. In 1794 there was\r\nwhat was known as the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania. In 1830 to 1835\r\nthere was a secession movement on in South Carolina, and President\r\nJackson put down that rebellion over the tariff. Then Daniel Webster\r\nmarked out the final lines of battle, entrenching the Constitution\r\nagainst rebellious attempts. Webster fired the first shot of the war,\r\nwhose last shot was fired at Appomattox. Webster carried the flag that\r\nGrant followed at Vicksburg, and shook out the folds of the banner that\r\nwas crimsoned with blood at Gettysburg. It was Webster's banner that\r\nAnderson pulled down at Fort Sumter, under the stress of fire, and it\r\nwas Webster's banner that, four years later to an hour, the same General\r\nAnderson pulled up on the same flagstaff at the same Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the thirties and the forties, the conflict was a\r\nconflict of words and arguments between men like Webster and Calhoun and\r\nGarrison and Phillips. Later, the strife took on the form of a guerrilla\r\nwarfare, and here and there leaders like Lovejoy were martyred. At last\r\nthe strife entered into politics, when Douglas and Lincoln struggled for\r\nthe supremacy of their principles,--but always it was a question of\r\nConstitutional interpretation, against whatever interest attacked the\r\n\"supreme law.\"\r\n\r\nSoon the conflict entered the Church, and the American Tract Society,\r\nto hold the gifts of slave owners, forbade the distributions of\r\nTestaments to slaves, while the Bishop of New Jersey destroyed an\r\nedition of the Prayer Book because it contained a picture of Ary\r\nScheffer's picture of \"Christ the Emancipator,\" who was engaged in\r\nstriking the shackles from slaves. The bishop was quite willing that\r\nChrist should open the eyes of the blind, make the deaf to hear and the\r\nlame to walk, but as for Jesus freeing the slaves--well, that was too\r\nmuch. Over the question of the Constitutional power of Congress to\r\nresist the further extension of slavery in newly opened territories, the\r\nwhole land rocked with excitement. Liberty and Slavery, like two giants,\r\ngrappled for the death struggle. In such an era God raised up Abraham\r\nLincoln, to lead the people out of the wilderness, and into the Promised\r\nLand of Union, of Liberty, and of Peace.\r\n\r\nNever was a candidate for universal fame born under so unfriendly a sky.\r\nHis annals are \"the short and simple annals of the poor.\" His home was a\r\nlog cabin that had but three sides, the fourth one being a buffalo robe,\r\nswaying to and fro in the wind. When the biting wind of poverty became\r\nunbearable in Kentucky, the scant possessions were loaded upon a horse,\r\ncarried across the Ohio, and the child walked barefooted through the\r\nforests of Indiana, where a new shack was built in the wilderness. There\r\nLincoln's \"angel mother\" sickened and died--that mother to whom Lincoln\r\nsaid he owed all that he was or hoped to be. Then when the winter of\r\npoverty and discontent settled down blacker than ever, the father\r\nremoved to another State, where the mud was deeper, and the winters\r\ncolder, where nature was less propitious. Lying on his face, before\r\nblazing logs, the boy committed to memory the four Gospels, \"Æsop's\r\nFables,\" and Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" At nineteen he went to New\r\nOrleans, and standing in the slave market saw a young girl sold at\r\npublic auction, and told his brother, Dennis Hanks, that if he ever had\r\na chance he would hit slavery the hardest blow he could. At twenty he\r\nsplit 1,200 rails for a farmer, whose wife wove for him three yards of\r\ncloth, dyed in walnut juice, with which he had a new suit of clothes. He\r\nstarted a little store, failed in business, became a surveyor, bought a\r\ncopy of the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; was made postmaster; several years later returned to the\r\ngovernment agent the exact silver quarters and copper cents that he had\r\nkept tied up in a bag, because honesty meant that the identical coins\r\nmust be returned to the government; entered upon the study and the\r\npractice of the law; was elected to the legislature, and reflected; was\r\nsent to Congress, and on a second campaign for the United States\r\nsenatorship from Illinois met his competitor, Stephen A. Douglas, in the\r\ngreat debate. Beginning this contest, he delivered the \"house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand\" speech; and in the course of his marvellous\r\ndebate made the issue between liberty and slavery so clear that a\r\nwayfaring man, though a fool, could not misunderstand; declared that if\r\nslavery was not wrong, there was nothing that was wrong. Soon he came to\r\nbe looked upon as one who each year would coin the happy phrase and the\r\nrhythmical watchword that would be taken upon the lips of 30,000,000 of\r\npeople; was made the leader of the new \"party of freedom,\" and\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nNow, with infinite skill and patience, he entered upon the task of\r\nproving that he was the strongest man in his Cabinet, the strongest man\r\nin the North, the strongest man in the country, and the only man who had\r\nthe last fact in the case, and therefore had the right to rule. Seward,\r\nexperienced politician and statesman that he was, began by delicately\r\nhinting to Lincoln that if he felt himself unequal to emergencies, he\r\ncould rely upon his Secretary of State for guidance, and that he,\r\nSeward, would not evade the responsibility. Lincoln answered by reading\r\nSeward's statement of a possible measure, and then placing beside it a\r\nstatement of his own that reduced Seward to the level of a schoolboy\r\nstanding up beside a giant. Then Stanton entered the lists as\r\ncompetitor, and quietly Lincoln asserted himself until Stanton's\r\nattitude became one of almost reverent worship, as he said of Lincoln,\r\n\"Henceforth he belongs with the immortals.\" Then Greeley put in his\r\nclaim for supremacy, and after Lincoln had published his answer to\r\nHorace Greeley, in lines as clear as crystal, and in words as gentle as\r\nsunbeams, not a man in the land but saw that Lincoln was intellectually\r\nhead and shoulders above Horace Greeley. One by one and step by step he\r\nascended the hills of difficulty. Round by round he climbed the ladder\r\nof fame. Naturally, therefore, his centennial was observed by a week's\r\ncelebration, when all the wheels were still, and all the stores and\r\nfactories were silent, when ninety millions of people were gathered into\r\none vast audience chamber, when one name was upon all lips--the name of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, the emancipator of the slaves, the acknowledged master\r\nof men, who gave liberty to the slaves that he might assure freedom to\r\nthe free.\r\n\r\nThoughtless writers have talked Lincoln's ancestry down, and careless\r\nbiographers have defamed him. Superficial students speak of him as a\r\nmiracle, and say that his genius is surrounded with silence and mystery.\r\nBut all that Abraham Lincoln was he had at the hands of his fathers and\r\nhis mothers. Although their greatness was latent, his parents had as\r\nmuch ability in their way as their distinguished son had in his way. How\r\ndo we know? Because when God wants to call a strong man He begins by\r\ncalling his father and mother. There never was a great man who did not\r\nhave a great ancestry, even though the greatness may have been latent\r\nand unconscious.\r\n\r\nEvery strong man stands upon the shoulders of his ancestors. When you\r\nstart for the top of Pike's Peak you start at Omaha. When you reach\r\nDenver you are six thousand feet in the air, and Pike's Peak is\r\nshouldered up on the foot-hills. Socrates is a great teacher, but look\r\nat Sphroniscus, the sculptor, his father. Paganini is a great musician,\r\nbut Paganini was born of musicians whose wrists had muscles that stood\r\nout like whip-cords. Bach is a great musician, but there were forty\r\npeople of the name of Bach mentioned in musical dictionaries. Charles\r\nDarwin is the great scientist, but there were four generations of\r\nscientists who had made ready for Darwin, just as there were seven\r\ngenerations of scholars that culminated in Emerson. And standing in the\r\nshadow behind Abraham Lincoln are half a dozen generations of men and\r\nwomen who handed forward to him a perfect logic engine, a sound mind, in\r\na sound body; a mental instrument that worked without fever and without\r\nfriction and without flaw. At the hands of Stradivarius one piece of\r\napple wood is fashioned into a violin. If Stradivarius passes by the\r\nother board because he has not time, let no man say the board that was\r\nundeveloped was not full of latent music. The Divine Artist and\r\nArchitect shaped Abraham Lincoln's nature into a world instrument, but\r\nthe same quality and the stuff were in his father and mother, who lived\r\nand died a bundle of roots that were never planted, a handful of\r\nblossoms that never fruited.\r\n\r\nLincoln's father and mother were like the crystal caves in their own\r\nKentucky. There the traveller is led through a cave of crystals, newly\r\ndiscovered. One day a farmer ploughing thought the ground sounded hollow\r\nunder his feet. Going to the barn, he brought a spade and opened up an\r\naperture. Flinging down a rope, his friends let the explorer down, and\r\nwhen the torches were lighted, lo, a cave as of amethysts, sapphires and\r\ndiamonds! For generations the cave had been undiscovered and the jewels\r\nunknown. Wild beasts had wandered above these flashing gems, and still\r\nmore savage men had lived and fought and died there. And yet just\r\nbeneath was this cave of splendid beauty. Oh, pathetic illustration of\r\nmen who are big with talent, of women full of latent gifts, of fathers\r\nand mothers like Thomas Lincoln and his young wife, who struggle on\r\nwithout opportunity, who are denied their chance, who are imprisoned by\r\npoverty, and fettered by circumstance, who are like birds beating bloody\r\nwings against the bars of an iron cage, who die unfulfilled prophecies,\r\nand dying, transfer their ambitions to their gifted children, believing\r\nthat their son shall behold what the father and mother must die without\r\nseeing. God worked no miracle in Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThere is a photograph of the signature of the grandfather upon a title\r\ndeed in Culpeper County in Virginia. Now, place that signature side by\r\nside with the signature of Abraham Lincoln on the emancipation\r\nproclamation, and the strong, sinewy sweep in the signature of the\r\ngrandfather comes down and repeats itself in the strong, steady\r\nclearness of the grandson. And perhaps the strong, sinewy sentence came\r\ndown and repeated itself also, for all fine thinking stands with one\r\nfoot on fine brain fibre. The time has come for men with a sharp knife\r\nand a hot iron to expunge from two or three of the otherwise best\r\nbiographies of Abraham Lincoln these false, superficial and ignorant\r\nstatements about his ancestry. Science, observation, experience, history\r\nand sifted facts all unite to tell us that whatever was great in its\r\nunfolding in the talent of Abraham Lincoln was great in the seed form in\r\nhis father and mother.\r\n\r\nWhere were the hidings of his power? Why is Lincoln revered above his\r\nfellows, the orators, the soldiers, and the statesmen and editors and\r\nsecretaries of his time? A line of contrast with the other great men who\r\nwere his competitors for fame will make Lincoln's supremacy to stand\r\nforth as clear in outline as the mountains, and as bright as the stars.\r\nFor example, Wendell Phillips was the agitator and orator of the\r\nabolitionists. Phillips said, \"Emancipation is the essential thing. The\r\nUnion secondary. If the Southern States will not emancipate the slaves,\r\nforce them out of the Union.\" Horace Greeley was the editor of the war\r\nepoch. Greeley said, \"Emancipation is first, the Union secondary. If\r\nthey prefer slavery to liberty let the erring sisters go.\" Beecher was\r\nthe all-round man of genius. His great speech in England began with an\r\nexordium at Manchester; he stated the arguments at Edinburgh, Glasgow\r\nand Liverpool; he pronounced the peroration at Exeter Hall, in London,\r\nand no such peroration and eloquence has been heard since Demosthenes'\r\nphilippic against the tyrant of Macedon. But Beecher's criticisms of\r\nLincoln in the New York _Independent_ during April and May of 1862 led\r\nLincoln to exclaim after reading one of them, \"Is Thy servant a dog that\r\nhe should do this thing?\" If these great men did not appreciate the\r\nnational crisis, Lincoln understood it perfectly. Now, over against the\r\neditorials of Beecher and Horace Greeley and the lectures of Phillips,\r\nstands Lincoln, and to these three men he sent words addressed only to\r\nHorace Greeley, explaining to them why the time had not come for the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation. And although a part of this we have quoted in\r\ndefense of Webster's position in 1850, that and yet more of the famous\r\nletter may well be repeated here:--\r\n\r\n     \"I would save the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could\r\n     at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\n     \"My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and not\r\n     either to save or destroy slavery.\r\n\r\n     \"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"If I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it.\r\n\r\n     \"And if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I\r\n     would also do that.\r\n\r\n     \"What I do about slavery and the coloured race I do because I\r\n     believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear\r\n     because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall do less whenever I believe that what I am doing hurts the\r\n     cause.\r\n\r\n     \"And I shall do more whenever I believe that doing more will help\r\n     the Union.\"\r\n\r\nHow wonderfully does this publish the supremacy of Abraham Lincoln!\r\nLincoln saw clearly, where others had an indistinct vision. As to\r\ngravity, Isaac Newton's vote outweighs all the other millions of men,\r\nand from the hour that Lincoln published this letter to Horace Greeley\r\nthe people saw that Abraham Lincoln had the last fact in the case, saw\r\nthe whole truth, saw it through and through. By sheer power, clarity of\r\nthought, strength of statement and fairness, Abraham Lincoln finally won\r\nover not only a lukewarm North, but a bitter South, until to-day he\r\nbelongs to the ninety millions. If every Northerner should die, the\r\nbrave and patriotic men of the South living now would defend everything\r\nfor which Abraham Lincoln lived and died. For at last it is true of both\r\nNorth and South, in Lincoln's own pathetic words, that the mystic chords\r\nof memory, stretching from every battle-field and patriot grave to every\r\nliving heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell\r\nthe chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by\r\nthe better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\nThe most striking characteristic of Lincoln's character was his honesty.\r\nSome men are naturally secretive: Lincoln was naturally open as\r\nsunshine. The exact fact, truth in the hidden parts, openness, these\r\nwere the innermost fibre of his being. Machiavelli laid out the\r\ndiplomat's career on the line of deceit, and concealing the cards.\r\nLincoln would have made a poor diplomat,--he spread all his cards out on\r\nthe table. He won from his opponent, Stephen A. Douglas, the tribute,\r\n\"Lincoln was the fairest and most honest man I ever knew.\" If there ever\r\nlived an absolutely honest lawyer, Lincoln was the man. In his work\r\nbefore the jury Lincoln never misrepresented his opponent's position,\r\nnever twisted the testimony of the witness, never made biassed\r\nstatements to win a verdict. Once a young lawyer who was opposing\r\nLincoln made a poor plea for his client, and overlooked in his argument\r\nbefore the jury two most important considerations. Lincoln was restless,\r\nand greatly disturbed. He seemed to think that the lawyer's client had\r\nbeen badly used, and that his attorney had not given him a fair chance,\r\nor guarded his rights. When Lincoln arose, therefore, he began by saying\r\nthat the opposing counsel had overlooked the most important point. He\r\nthen stated his opponent's position far more strongly than his lawyer\r\nhad, and made the best possible statement for his opponent, to the\r\nastonishment and indignation of his own client, whom he was defending.\r\nThen Lincoln turned to answer these arguments,--with the result that for\r\nthe first time the two litigants understood the exact facts of both\r\nsides, and at Lincoln's request settled the case, withdrawing it from\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nThis love of the exact truth and of fair play and of essential justice\r\nshone from the man's face, dominated his arguments, explained his\r\nview-point, revealed his character. The nickname, \"Honest Old Abe,\"\r\ntells the whole story. Lincoln's final judgment partook of the nature\r\nof a final decree and law. At length his pronouncements became like a\r\ndivine fiat. Take the truth out of Lincoln's character, and it would be\r\nlike taking the warmth out of a sunbeam. He _was_ truth, he thought\r\ntruth, loved the truth, surrendered himself to the truth. Under that\r\ninfluence he refused to play politics, or fence for position with\r\nDouglas. Once Lincoln won a case so easily that he returned one-half of\r\nthe retainer's fee, because he felt that he had not earned it.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, is found the secret of Lincoln's unbounded popularity.\r\nThe common people know their friends, and--what with Lincoln's\r\ngentleness, his justice, his boundless kindness, his sympathy with the\r\npoor and the unfortunate, and his honesty--he became the most beloved\r\nman in the Illinois circuit.\r\n\r\nWonderful, too, his literary achievements. His great passages read like\r\nthe Bible, and have almost the moral authority thereof. If preachers\r\never wear the old Bible out, Lincoln's Second Inaugural, and his speech\r\nat Gettysburg, and certain other passages, will furnish texts for\r\nanother hundred years. One thing is certain,--if Chinese students in\r\ntheir universities two thousand years from now translate any oration out\r\nof the English language, as we now translate the speeches of\r\nDemosthenes, these Chinese students will translate Lincoln's speech at\r\nGettysburg, and his Second Inaugural Address. Contrary to the usual\r\nidea, it may be confidently affirmed that Lincoln was a well equipped\r\nman, and had the best possible training for literary style. During the\r\nplastic years of memory, Lincoln had three books to study, and two of\r\nthese are the finest models for style in all literature,--King James'\r\nVersion of the Bible, and Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" These are the\r\nworld's great literary masterpieces, these are the wells of English,\r\npure and undefiled. Upon these two books Robert Burns was reared. To the\r\nfact that his mother made him commit to memory forty chapters of the\r\nBible before he was seven years old, John Ruskin attributed his mastery\r\nin English style. Second rate men know something about everything.\r\nLincoln was a first rate man who knew everything about some one thing.\r\nIf you want to make a versatile man, turn a boy loose in a library. If\r\nyou want a boy to have the note of distinction upon his pages, lock him\r\nout of a library, and send him into solitude, with the English Bible,\r\nwith John Bunyan, and with Æsop's Fables, and let him take these three\r\nbooks into his intellect, as he takes meat and bread into the rich blood\r\nof the physical system.\r\n\r\nLiterary style is the shadow that the soul flings across the page. Style\r\nis simply the intellect rushing into exhibition and verbal form.\r\nTherefore style is the balance of faculty, symmetry of development. A\r\nman is healthy when he does not know that he has a single organ in his\r\nbody, and a page has style when you do not know where to find the note\r\nof distinction. There is a world of difference between \"style,\" and \"a\r\nstyle.\" Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural has style. Carlyle's French\r\nRevolution has a style. A perfect Kentucky horse has style. A\r\nknee-sprung horse has a style. Down the track comes this perfect horse,\r\neyes flashing, head up, neck arched, feet dancing, not a flaw, not a\r\nblemish, upon leg or body. Looking at the glorious creature you exclaim,\r\n\"That horse has style!\" For a horse's style is born of perfect health,\r\nperfect lungs and perfect legs, one power balancing another, and all\r\nunited to produce an absolutely perfect horse. Now comes a horse that\r\nrepresents a collection of ringbones, and glanders, and poll-evil. The\r\none horse limping in front has \"a style.\" Thomas Carlyle's sentences are\r\nknee-sprung in front and his phrases are spavined behind, and,\r\ntherefore, Carlyle has \"a style\" but not \"style.\" You would know one of\r\nhis sentences if you saw its skeleton lying in the desert on the road to\r\nKhartoum. But on the other hand, Lincoln has \"style,\"--that\r\nindescribable bloom and beauty, born of balance, development and\r\nsymmetrical growth. Samuel Johnson bulged on the side of Latinity.\r\nDaniel Webster is an example of the magnificent, illustrating\r\ngorgeousness, opulence, and tropic splendour. Lincoln's sentences are\r\nlike the Bible and Bunyan,--they are plate-glass windows through which\r\nyou look to see the jewelled thought beyond.\r\n\r\nLincoln tells us how he made his style. One day he heard a man use the\r\nword \"demonstrate.\" For days he cudgelled his brains to find out just\r\nwhat it was to demonstrate a statement. He tells us that when he was\r\nabout eight years old, he began to be irritated when men used long\r\nwords that he could not understand. He began the habit of thinking over\r\nin the dark before he went to sleep any story he had heard, any\r\nstatement that had been made, and he tried to substitute for the long\r\nhard words little short simple words, that a boy could understand.\r\nDuring those early years, he learned that the rich, racy, homey words\r\nare steeped and perfumed with beautiful associations. He knew that words\r\nare fossil poetry. What would one not give for the old cloak that Paul\r\nhad from Troas, a piece of the marble by Phidias, the old threshold worn\r\nby the feet of Socrates, an old missal illuminated by Bellini, an old\r\nnote-book in which Shakespeare wrote the first outline of Hamlet! And\r\nthe old, sweet, home words with which a mother soothes her babe, with\r\nwhich a lover woos his bride, the old words of God, and home and native\r\nland, are the words that are rich in association and in power to move\r\nthe heart. A bird lines its nest with feathers plucked from its own\r\nbreast, and the heart steeps the dear, simple speech of home life in\r\nsacred associations. So Lincoln cut out all the long Latin words, and\r\nsubstituted the short Saxon ones. Schooled in the two great master books\r\nthat are the precious life spirit of earth's greatest souls treasured\r\nup, he developed his style.\r\n\r\nNor must we overlook the fact that the apparent narrowness of his\r\nculture represents a real concentration that made for richness and\r\ndepth. If one must choose, take the upper Rhine that is a river deep and\r\npure and sweet, and strong for bearing the fleets of war and peace\r\nbecause it is confined between banks and narrowed. But when the Rhine\r\ncomes down to the flats and approaches the sea and casts off all\r\nrestraints, and tries to include everything, it turns into a swamp, a\r\nmorass, losing its power for commerce, and becoming a source of disease\r\nand death. Lincoln's culture was limited to the English, and to a\r\nmastery of the Constitution--the principles of fundamental justice, to\r\none country--the Republic, to one topic--the Union, and to one\r\nreform--Slavery. Beyond all doubt, this concentration of study during\r\nthe critical years of his career made up a much better preparation than\r\nif he had gone to a college, studied half a dozen languages, and fifty\r\nor sixty different subjects, and come out well smattered, but poorly\r\neducated. It may be doubted whether Lincoln would have been much better\r\noff had he been able to read Latin and Greek, and speak French and\r\nGerman. Many people can say \"It is a little yellow dog\" in Greek, and\r\nGerman, and French, and Italian, and English, but after all it is only a\r\nlittle yellow dog. What educates is the idea, and not the half dozen\r\nnames of a thing without an idea.\r\n\r\nThe important thing about a cistern is water, and not many mouths to the\r\npump. Having spent many years learning to express one idea in five ways,\r\none might be glad to trade the five ways of expression for five ideas to\r\nbe expressed in one way. Edward Everett, once President of Harvard\r\nUniversity, could talk in five languages, and at Gettysburg spoke for\r\ntwo hours. Lincoln could speak in one language, and did so for two\r\nminutes. But the next morning Mr. Everett wrote to the President: \"I\r\nshould be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the\r\ncentral idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes.\"\r\nLincoln's one language shames our knowledge of four languages, his three\r\nbooks shame our libraries, and our four years of college culture.\r\n\r\nNor must we overlook the influence upon Lincoln's style of the parables\r\nof Jesus and the fables of Æsop. There are two invariable signs of\r\ngenius in a boy,--one is the serious note, and the other is the\r\npicture-making note. All the great things represent serious thinking.\r\nThe greatest artist of the last century was the most serious one,--Watt,\r\nwith his Love and Life, and Love and Death, and Mammon, and Hope. The\r\ngreat poems have been the serious poems, the In Memoriam, and the\r\nIntimations of Immortality, the Hamlet and the Lear. The great orators\r\nhave been the serious orators.\r\n\r\nThe next sign of genius is the picture-making faculty. Men of talent\r\nevolve arguments, men of genius create emblems, parables and pictures.\r\nMinds oftentimes called profound use long abstractions, and are called\r\ndeep thinkers, because nobody can understand them. But along comes a man\r\nof genius, and he squeezes the juice out of the abstract argument, and\r\nflings the rind away, and tells you what it is like.\r\n\r\nMeasured in terms of genius, the parables of Jesus are the greatest\r\nliterary achievements in history. Æsop's fables teach by pictures.\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" is pictorial.\r\n\r\nLincoln was exceedingly fortunate in his generation in that the three\r\ngreat books of pictures were in his hands during the imaginative epoch.\r\nOf course he was born with the talent for parable, because genius is\r\none-half nature and the other half nurture. It was this natural gift and\r\nthe training that taught him how when he had completed an argument and\r\nmastered the principle, to say, Now what is this great principle like,\r\nand how can I condense it into a picture and put it in a happy phrase\r\nthat will sing itself across the land? This picture-making gift inspired\r\nhim to quote the keen wisdom of that expression of Jesus, \"The house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand.\" This skill in parables gave him\r\nthe expression, \"Better not swap horses in the middle of the stream,\"\r\nthat gave him his second election. This vision power gave him that\r\nsentence equal to anything in Shakespeare, when Vicksburg fell, \"Once\r\nmore the Father of Waters goes unvexed to the sea.\" This faculty enabled\r\nhim to sweep into one illustration a thousand arguments, so that the\r\npeople could never forget the mother principle that explained the facts.\r\n\r\nNor may we forget what the great cause did for him. The era of the war\r\nwas a great era, because God heaved society as the winds heave the\r\nwaves, and men were swept forward with irresistible power upon the great\r\nmovement of liberty. Great movements make great epochs and great men. A\r\ngreat ideal of God and righteousness and liberty lifts Savonarola and\r\nFlorence to new levels; a great cathedral inspires Michael Angelo's\r\ngreat dome; a Divine Saviour and His transfiguration exalt Raphael;\r\nParadise explains Dante; listening to the sevenfold Hallelujah chorus of\r\nGod arouses the sweep and majesty of Milton's epic; the woes of three\r\nmillion slaves made eloquence possible for Phillips and Beecher. The\r\nsaving of a Union, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition\r\nthat all men were created equal, represented a cause into which Lincoln\r\ncould fling himself. The thought of meanly losing or nobly saving the\r\nlast, best hope of earth, exalted, transformed, and armed the men,\r\nmaking feeblings strong, and strong men to be giants.\r\n\r\nEloquence and heroism wane during the commercial era. No man can be\r\neloquent upon the duty on hides, or salt, or the digging of mud out of a\r\nriver. But dumb lips will break into glorious speech at the thought of\r\nfreeing millions of slaves, and saving free institutions, and handing\r\nliberty forward to other lands, and to generations yet unborn. The era\r\nof Fort Sumter and Gettysburg, when liberty and slavery were in their\r\ndeath grapple, was an era so great that the ordinary issues of avarice,\r\nself-interest, fame, luxury, became contemptible, and men were exalted\r\nto the point where they spake, and suffered, and marched, and died, more\r\nlike gods than men. The great battles to be fought, the great armies to\r\nbe moved, the great navies to be directed, the great orators and editors\r\nwith whom he counselled, the many slaves for whom he became a voice, the\r\ngreat days on which he felt that he was making history, the great future\r\ninto which he hoped to send the great liberties unimpaired and purified,\r\nthe great God over all,--lent greatness to Abraham Lincoln, clothed him\r\nwith pathos, with sorrow, with dignity and majesty, as with garments.\r\n\r\nLike every giant, he was gentle. The truly great are always sensitive\r\nand sympathetic. In proportion as the mountain goes upward in size does\r\nit gain in power to return the strong man's shout, or the sigh of the\r\nlost child, echoing and reëchoing the cry of need. Sympathy is the soul\r\njourneying abroad, to bind up the wounds of him who has fallen among\r\nthieves. Sympathy cannot feast in a palace while the poor famish.\r\nSelfishness can stop its ears with wax lest it hear the groan of the\r\npoor, but sympathy is knitted in with its kind. Lincoln worked as hard\r\nto help men as slave masters did to recover a fugitive to bondage. It\r\nhas been beautifully said that he did kind deeds stealthily, as if he\r\nwere afraid of being found out. He became a shield above the fallen; he\r\nstood between the soldier, condemned for the sleep of exhaustion, and\r\nthe hangman's noose. He refused to attend a cabinet meeting because he\r\nwas trying to find a reason for reprieving a soldier. \"It is butchery\r\nday,\" he said one Friday morning, and he denied himself to a committee\r\nbecause he did not think that hanging would help the boy who was\r\ncondemned to die. \"They said he was homely,\" said a poor woman, going\r\naway from the White House with a reprieve for her son; \"he is the\r\nhandsomest man I ever saw.\" It is this sympathy that runs through his\r\nletter to that mother, whose five sons had died gloriously on the field\r\nof battle. For he squeezed the purple clusters of the heart, and let the\r\ncrimson tide flow down upon the page, as he prayed that the mother\r\nmight carry through the years \"only the cherished memory of the loved\r\nand the lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so\r\ncostly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nMore striking still, Lincoln's trust in God and His overruling\r\nprovidence. Mr. Herndon in his biography and Dr. Abbott in an editorial\r\nand an oration at Cooper Institute emphasize the agnosticism of Lincoln.\r\nThe one says that in his youth he wrote an article against Christianity,\r\nand the other that he was not a technical Christian. Dr. Abbott thinks\r\nall this so important that he places the agnosticism of Lincoln at the\r\nforefront. But too much has been made of the schoolboy article of\r\nLincoln on doubt and infidelity. In his youth Gladstone was a Tory, but\r\nhe outgrew it. In the outset Paul was against Christianity. Tennyson and\r\nWordsworth in their teens wrote puerile verse, just as Lincoln in his\r\nteens wrote a foolish paper. But it is cruelly unfair not to allow\r\nAbraham Lincoln the full benefit of what he came to be, and not to take\r\nthe man at his best. It is unfair to say that a man is what he is at his\r\nworst and lowest point; a man is what he is at his best and highest\r\npoint. Stephen A. Douglas said Lincoln was the most honest man he ever\r\nknew. Well, if Lincoln was an honest man in his character, he must have\r\nbeen honest in talking about his religion and his faith in God. Was\r\nAbraham Lincoln an agnostic in that hour when he spoke his farewell\r\nwords to his neighbours in Springfield, about starting on the memorable\r\njourney to his inauguration? He said: \"I feel that I cannot succeed\r\nwithout the same divine aid that sustained Washington, and on the same\r\nAlmighty Being I place my reliance for support; and I hope you, my\r\nfriends, will all pray that I may receive that divine assistance without\r\nwhich I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain.\" Was Abraham\r\nLincoln without faith, and did he play to the gallery, when he set apart\r\na day of fasting and prayer after the defeat at Bull Run? Having said\r\nthat Abraham Lincoln was an honest man, why not remember it, when these\r\ncritics read his First Inaugural, in which he declares that\r\n\"intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who\r\nhas never yet forsaken this favoured land, are still competent to adjust\r\nin the best way all our present difficulty.\" When Abraham Lincoln wrote\r\nthe mother, Mrs. Bixby, \"I pray that the heavenly Father may assuage the\r\nanguish of your bereavement,\" he meant that he believed in God, in a God\r\nwho answered prayer, in a God who cared for the mother living, and the\r\nfive brave boys dead. \"The Almighty has His own purposes,\" said Lincoln,\r\nin the Second Inaugural, an address that is steeped in religion, that\r\nexhales trust in God. Take God out of that Second Inaugural, and it\r\nwould be like taking health out of the body, wisdom out of the book,\r\nsweetness out of the song, culture out of the intellect, life out of the\r\nbody. You cannot in one breath say that Lincoln was an agnostic, and\r\nthen in the next one say that Lincoln was an honest man. I care not one\r\nwhit what Mr. Herndon says. I care everything about what Abraham Lincoln\r\nsays about himself in his greatest speeches, in his noblest hours, when\r\nhe gave his countrymen his latest, deepest, profoundest thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn trying to explain the character of Lincoln we therefore make our\r\nfinal appeal unto God, for God alone is equal to the making of this\r\ngreat man. When long time has passed, the name of Lincoln will probably\r\nbe mentioned with Moses, Julius Cæsar, Paul, Shakespeare. Men will read\r\na few of his paragraphs as a kind of Bible of Patriotism. Washington's\r\nname will not be less, but Lincoln's will certainly be more and more,\r\nand then still more. God and Sorrow made the man great.\r\n\r\nAnd this is his life story. In the darkest hour of the Republic, when\r\nliberty and slavery were struggling to see which should rule the old\r\nhomestead, it became evident that slavery would turn the garden into a\r\ndesert, and the house into a ruin. And seeking a deliverer and a\r\nsaviour, the great God, in His own purpose, passed by the palace with\r\nits silken delights. He took a little babe in His arms, and called to\r\nHis side His favourite angel, the angel of Sorrow. Stooping, he\r\nwhispered, \"Oh, Sorrow, thou well-beloved teacher, take thou this little\r\nchild of Mine and make him great. Take him to yonder cabin in the\r\nwilderness; make his home a poor man's house; plant his narrow path\r\nthick with thorns, cut his little feet with sharp and cruel rocks; as he\r\nclimbs the hills of difficulty, make each footprint red with his own\r\nlife-blood; load his little back with burdens; give to him days of toil\r\nand nights of study and sleeplessness; wrest from his arms whatever he\r\nloves; make his heart, through sorrow, as sensitive to the sigh of a\r\nslave as a thread of silk in a window is sensitive to the slightest wind\r\nthat blows; and when you have digged lines of pain in his cheeks, and\r\nmade his face more marred than the face of any man of his time, bring\r\nhim back to me, and with him I will free three million slaves.\" That is\r\nhow God made Abraham Lincoln great.\r\n\r\nAnd then,--we slew him. For that is the way our ignorant, sinful earth\r\nhas always rewarded its greatest souls. Ours is a world where we crucify\r\nthe Saviour in Jerusalem, where we poison Socrates in Athens, where we\r\nexile Dante in Italy, and burn Savonarola in Florence, and starve\r\nCervantes in Madrid, and jail Bunyan in Bedford,--for the greatest\r\nmanhood is always rewarded with martyrdom. And what better thing for\r\nAbraham Lincoln than assassination, because he has emancipated three\r\nmillion slaves and saved the Union, as the last, best hope of earth?\r\n\r\nBut, lo, who are these in bright array, looking over the battlements of\r\nheaven, while the forces of liberty and slavery in other forms struggle\r\ntogether on these earthly plains beneath? These with radiant faces\r\nunstained by tears, that seem never to have known the mark of pain or\r\nsorrow? Ah! these are they who have come out of great tribulation,\r\nanguish and martyrdom; Paul from the stones; Homer from his blindness;\r\nSocrates from his cup of poison; Milton from his heart-break; Savonarola\r\nfrom his fagots, and Lincoln from his long martyrdom--the least part of\r\nwhich was the shot that freed his spirit in the hour of triumph and\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abolition Societies in the South, 25\r\n\r\n  Abominations, tariff of, 50, 163\r\n\r\n  Æsop's Fables, 290, 297,316\r\n\r\n  \"Adam Bede,\" 148\r\n\r\n  Adams, Charles F., 54, 243\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, 83, 121\r\n\r\n  Alabama, secession, 189\r\n\r\n  _Alabama_, the, 225, 238, 245\r\n\r\n  _Albemarle_, the, 245\r\n\r\n  Albert, Prince Consort, 226\r\n\r\n  Aldersen, Judge, 107\r\n\r\n  Alva, Duke of, 15, 264\r\n\r\n  American Tract Society, 296\r\n\r\n  Ames, Fisher, 213\r\n\r\n  Andersonville, 269, 270\r\n\r\n  Anne, Queen, 18\r\n\r\n  Anti-Slavery epoch, importance of, 6, 7, 13\r\n\r\n  Arab slave-hunters, 30\r\n\r\n  Athens, 14, 41, 212\r\n\r\n  Atlanta and Sherman, 249\r\n\r\n  Austin, James T., 81\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bach, John S., 301\r\n\r\n  Bacon, Lord, 110\r\n\r\n  Bailey, Kentucky editor, 140\r\n\r\n  Bancroft, George, 104, 282\r\n\r\n  Bates, Edward, 184\r\n\r\n  Beauregard, P.
